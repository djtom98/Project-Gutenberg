Therefore the characters\r\ninclude women and children, a young boy--the apprentice--some\r\nimprovers, journeymen in the prime of life, and worn-out old men.\r\n\r\nI designed to show the conditions relating from poverty and\r\nunemployment: to expose the futility of the measures taken to deal with\r\nthem and to indicate what I believe to be the only real remedy,\r\nnamely--Socialism.  I intended to explain what Socialists understand by\r\nthe word \'poverty\': to define the Socialist theory of the causes of\r\npoverty, and to explain how Socialists propose to abolish poverty.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that, considering the number of books dealing with\r\nthese subjects already existing, such a work as this was uncalled for.\r\nThe answer is that not only are the majority of people opposed to\r\nSocialism, but a very brief conversation with an average anti-socialist\r\nis sufficient to show that he does not know what Socialism means.  The\r\nsame is true of all the anti-socialist writers and the \'great\r\nstatesmen\' who make anti-socialist speeches: unless we believe that\r\nthey are deliberate liars and imposters, who to serve their own\r\ninterests labour to mislead other people, we must conclude that they do\r\nnot understand Socialism.  There is no other possible explanation of\r\nthe extraordinary things they write and say.  The thing they cry out\r\nagainst is not Socialism but a phantom of their own imagining.\r\n\r\nAnother answer is that \'The Philanthropists\' is not a treatise or\r\nessay, but a novel.  My main object was to write a readable story full\r\nof human interest and based on the happenings of everyday life, the\r\nsubject of Socialism being treated incidentally.\r\n\r\nThis was the task I set myself.  To what extent I have succeeded is for\r\nothers to say; but whatever their verdict, the work possesses at least\r\none merit--that of being true.  I have invented nothing.  There are no\r\nscenes or incidents in the story that I have not either witnessed\r\nmyself or had conclusive evidence of.  As far as I dared I let the\r\ncharacters express themselves in their own sort of language and\r\nconsequently some passages may be considered objectionable.  At the\r\nsame time I believe that--because it is true--the book is not without\r\nits humorous side.\r\n\r\nThe scenes and characters are typical of every town in the South of\r\nEngland and they will be readily recognized by those concerned.  If the\r\nbook is published I think it will appeal to a very large number of\r\nreaders.  Because it is true it will probably be denounced as a libel\r\non the working classes and their employers, and upon the\r\nreligious-professing section of the community. But I believe it will be\r\nacknowledged as true by most of those who are compelled to spend their\r\nlives amid the surroundings it describes, and it will be evident that\r\nno attack is made upon sincere religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nAn Imperial Banquet.  A Philosophical Discussion.  The Mysterious\r\nStranger.  Britons Never shall be Slaves\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house was named \'The Cave\'.  It was a large old-fashioned\r\nthree-storied building standing in about an acre of ground, and\r\nsituated about a mile outside the town of Mugsborough.  It stood back\r\nnearly two hundred yards from the main road and was reached by means of\r\na by-road or lane, on each side of which was a hedge formed of hawthorn\r\ntrees and blackberry bushes.  This house had been unoccupied for many\r\nyears and it was now being altered and renovated for its new owner by\r\nthe firm of Rushton & Co., Builders and Decorators.\r\n\r\nThere were, altogether, about twenty-five men working there,\r\ncarpenters, plumbers, plasterers, bricklayers and painters, besides\r\nseveral unskilled labourers.  New floors were being put in where the\r\nold ones were decayed, and upstairs two of the rooms were being made\r\ninto one by demolishing the parting wall and substituting an iron\r\ngirder.  Some of the window frames and sashes were so rotten that they\r\nwere being replaced. Some of the ceilings and walls were so cracked and\r\nbroken that they had to be replastered.  Openings were cut through\r\nwalls and doors were being put where no doors had been before. Old\r\nbroken chimney pots were being taken down and new ones were being taken\r\nup and fixed in their places.  All the old whitewash had to be washed\r\noff the ceilings and all the old paper had to be scraped off the walls\r\npreparatory to the house being repainted and decorated.  The air was\r\nfull of the sounds of hammering and sawing, the ringing of trowels, the\r\nrattle of pails, the splashing of water brushes, and the scraping of\r\nthe stripping knives used by those who were removing the old wallpaper.\r\nBesides being full of these the air was heavily laden with dust and\r\ndisease germs, powdered mortar, lime, plaster, and the dirt that had\r\nbeen accumulating within the old house for years.  In brief, those\r\nemployed there might be said to be living in a Tariff Reform\r\nParadise--they had Plenty of Work.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock Bob Crass--the painters\' foreman--blew a blast upon a\r\nwhistle and all hands assembled in the kitchen, where Bert the\r\napprentice had already prepared the tea, which was ready in the large\r\ngalvanized iron pail that he had placed in the middle of the floor. By\r\nthe side of the pail were a number of old jam-jars, mugs, dilapidated\r\ntea-cups and one or two empty condensed milk tins.  Each man on the\r\n\'job\' paid Bert threepence a week for the tea and sugar--they did not\r\nhave milk--and although they had tea at breakfast-time as well as at\r\ndinner, the lad was generally considered to be making a fortune.\r\n\r\nTwo pairs of steps, laid parallel on their sides at a distance of about\r\neight feet from each other, with a plank laid across, in front of the\r\nfire, several upturned pails, and the drawers belonging to the dresser,\r\nformed the seating accommodation.  The floor of the room was covered\r\nwith all manner of debris, dust, dirt, fragments of old mortar and\r\nplaster.  A sack containing cement was leaning against one of the\r\nwalls, and a bucket containing some stale whitewash stood in one corner.\r\n\r\nAs each man came in he filled his cup, jam-jar or condensed milk tin\r\nwith tea from the steaming pail, before sitting down.  Most of them\r\nbrought their food in little wicker baskets which they held on their\r\nlaps or placed on the floor beside them.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no attempt at conversation and nothing was heard but\r\nthe sounds of eating and drinking and the drizzling of the bloater\r\nwhich Easton, one of the painters, was toasting on the end of a pointed\r\nstick at the fire.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think much of this bloody tea,\' suddenly remarked Sawkins, one\r\nof the labourers.\r\n\r\n\'Well it oughter be all right,\' retorted Bert; \'it\'s been bilin\' ever\r\nsince \'arf past eleven.\'\r\n\r\nBert White was a frail-looking, weedy, pale-faced boy, fifteen years of\r\nage and about four feet nine inches in height.  His trousers were part\r\nof a suit that he had once worn for best, but that was so long ago that\r\nthey had become too small for him, fitting rather tightly and scarcely\r\nreaching the top of his patched and broken hob-nailed boots. The knees\r\nand the bottoms of the legs of his trousers had been patched with\r\nsquare pieces of cloth, several shades darker than the original fabric,\r\nand these patches were now all in rags.  His coat was several sizes too\r\nlarge for him and hung about him like a dirty ragged sack. He was a\r\npitiable spectacle of neglect and wretchedness as he sat there on an\r\nupturned pail, eating his bread and cheese with fingers that, like his\r\nclothing, were grimed with paint and dirt.\r\n\r\n\'Well then, you can\'t have put enough tea in, or else you\'ve bin usin\'\r\nup wot was left yesterday,\' continued Sawkins.\r\n\r\n\'Why the bloody \'ell don\'t you leave the boy alone?\' said Harlow,\r\nanother painter.  \'If you don\'t like the tea you needn\'t drink it. For\r\nmy part, I\'m sick of listening to you about it every damn day.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all very well for you to say I needn\'t drink it,\' answered\r\nSawkins, \'but I\'ve paid my share an\' I\'ve got a right to express an\r\nopinion.  It\'s my belief that \'arf the money we gives \'him is spent on\r\npenny \'orribles: \'e\'s always got one in \'is hand, an\' to make wot tea\r\n\'e does buy last, \'e collects all the slops wot\'s left and biles it up\r\nday after day.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I don\'t!\' said Bert, who was on the verge of tears.  \'It\'s not me\r\nwot buys the things at all.  I gives the money I gets to Crass, and \'e\r\nbuys them \'imself, so there!\'\r\n\r\nAt this revelation, some of the men furtively exchanged significant\r\nglances, and Crass, the foreman, became very red.\r\n\r\n\'You\'d better keep your bloody thruppence and make your own tea after\r\nthis week,\' he said, addressing Sawkins, \'and then p\'raps we\'ll \'ave a\r\nlittle peace at meal-times.\'\r\n\r\n\'An\' you needn\'t ask me to cook no bloaters or bacon for you no more,\'\r\nadded Bert, tearfully, \'cos I won\'t do it.\'\r\n\r\nSawkins was not popular with any of the others.  When, about twelve\r\nmonths previously, he first came to work for Rushton & Co., he was a\r\nsimple labourer, but since then he had \'picked up\' a slight knowledge\r\nof the trade, and having armed himself with a putty-knife and put on a\r\nwhite jacket, regarded himself as a fully qualified painter.  The\r\nothers did not perhaps object to him trying to better his condition,\r\nbut his wages--fivepence an hour--were twopence an hour less than the\r\nstandard rate, and the result was that in slack times often a better\r\nworkman was \'stood off\' when Sawkins was kept on.  Moreover, he was\r\ngenerally regarded as a sneak who carried tales to the foreman and the\r\n\'Bloke\'.  Every new hand who was taken on was usually warned by his new\r\nmates \'not to let the b--r Sawkins see anything.\'\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant silence which now ensued was at length broken by one of\r\nthe men, who told a dirty story, and in the laughter and applause that\r\nfollowed, the incident of the tea was forgotten.\r\n\r\n\'How did you get on yesterday?\' asked Crass, addressing Bundy, the\r\nplasterer, who was intently studying the sporting columns of the Daily\r\nObscurer.\r\n\r\n\'No luck,\' replied Bundy, gloomily. \'I had a bob each way on Stockwell,\r\nin the first race, but it was scratched before the start.\'\r\n\r\nThis gave rise to a conversation between Crass, Bundy, and one or two\r\nothers concerning the chances of different horses in the morrow\'s\r\nraces.  It was Friday, and no one had much money, so at the suggestion\r\nof Bundy, a Syndicate was formed, each member contributing threepence\r\nfor the purpose of backing a dead certainty given by the renowned\r\nCaptain Kiddem of the Obscurer.  One of those who did not join the\r\nsyndicate was Frank Owen, who was as usual absorbed in a newspaper. He\r\nwas generally regarded as a bit of a crank: for it was felt that there\r\nmust be something wrong about a man who took no interest in racing or\r\nfootball and was always talking a lot of rot about religion and\r\npolitics.  If it had not been for the fact that he was generally\r\nadmitted to be an exceptionally good workman, they would have had\r\nlittle hesitation about thinking that he was mad.  This man was about\r\nthirty-two years of age, and of medium height, but so slightly built\r\nthat he appeared taller.  There was a suggestion of refinement in his\r\nclean-shaven face, but his complexion was ominously clear, and an\r\nunnatural colour flushed the think cheeks.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain amount of justification for the attitude of his\r\nfellow workmen, for Owen held the most unusual and unorthodox opinions\r\non the subjects mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the world are ordered in accordance with orthodox\r\nopinions.  If anyone did not think in accordance with these he soon\r\ndiscovered this fact for himself.  Owen saw that in the world a small\r\nclass of people were possessed of a great abundance and superfluity of\r\nthe things that are produced by work.  He saw also that a very great\r\nnumber--in fact the majority of the people--lived on the verge of want;\r\nand that a smaller but still very large number lived lives of\r\nsemi-starvation from the cradle to the grave; while a yet smaller but\r\nstill very great number actually died of hunger, or, maddened by\r\nprivation, killed themselves and their children in order to put a\r\nperiod to their misery.  And strangest of all--in his opinion--he saw\r\nthat people who enjoyed abundance of the things that are made by work,\r\nwere the people who did Nothing: and that the others, who lived in want\r\nor died of hunger, were the people who worked.  And seeing all this he\r\nthought that it was wrong, that the system that produced such results\r\nwas rotten and should be altered.  And he had sought out and eagerly\r\nread the writings of those who thought they knew how it might be done.\r\n\r\nIt was because he was in the habit of speaking of these subjects that\r\nhis fellow workmen came to the conclusion that there was probably\r\nsomething wrong with his mind.\r\n\r\nWhen all the members of the syndicate had handed over their\r\ncontributions, Bundy went out to arrange matters with the bookie, and\r\nwhen he had gone Easton annexed the copy of the Obscurer that Bundy had\r\nthrown away, and proceeded to laboriously work through some carefully\r\ncooked statistics relating to Free Trade and Protection. Bert, his eyes\r\nstarting out of his head and his mouth wide open, was devouring the\r\ncontents of a paper called The Chronicles of Crime.  Ned Dawson, a poor\r\ndevil who was paid fourpence an hour for acting as mate or labourer to\r\nBundy, or the bricklayers, or anyone else who wanted him, lay down on\r\nthe dirty floor in a corner of the room and with his coat rolled up as\r\na pillow, went to sleep.  Sawkins, with the same intention, stretched\r\nhimself at full length on the dresser.  Another who took no part in the\r\nsyndicate was Barrington, a labourer, who, having finished his dinner,\r\nplaced the cup he brought for his tea back into his dinner basket, took\r\nout an old briar pipe which he slowly filled, and proceeded to smoke in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nSome time previously the firm had done some work for a wealthy\r\ngentleman who lived in the country, some distance outside Mugsborough.\r\nThis gentleman also owned some property in the town and it was commonly\r\nreported that he had used his influence with Rushton to induce the\r\nlatter to give Barrington employment.  It was whispered amongst the\r\nhands that the young man was a distant relative of the gentleman\'s, and\r\nthat he had disgraced himself in some way and been disowned by his\r\npeople.  Rushton was supposed to have given him a job in the hope of\r\ncurrying favour with his wealthy client, from whom he hoped to obtain\r\nmore work.  Whatever the explanation of the mystery may have been, the\r\nfact remained that Barrington, who knew nothing of the work except what\r\nhe had learned since he had been taken on, was employed as a painter\'s\r\nlabourer at the usual wages--fivepence per hour.\r\n\r\nHe was about twenty-five years of age and a good deal taller than the\r\nmajority of the others, being about five feet ten inches in height and\r\nslenderly though well and strongly built.  He seemed very anxious to\r\nlearn all that he could about the trade, and although rather reserved\r\nin his manner, he had contrived to make himself fairly popular with his\r\nworkmates.  He seldom spoke unless to answer when addressed, and it was\r\ndifficult to draw him into conversation.  At meal-times, as on the\r\npresent occasion, he generally smoked, apparently lost in thought and\r\nunconscious of his surroundings.\r\n\r\nMost of the others also lit their pipes and a desultory conversation\r\nensued.\r\n\r\n\'Is the gent what\'s bought this \'ouse any relation to Sweater the\r\ndraper?\' asked Payne, the carpenter\'s foreman.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s the same bloke,\' replied Crass.\r\n\r\n\'Didn\'t he used to be on the Town Council or something?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E\'s bin on the Council for years,\' returned Crass.  \'\'E\'s on it now.\r\n\'E\'s mayor this year.  \'E\'s bin mayor several times before.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s see,\' said Payne, reflectively, \'\'e married old Grinder\'s\r\nsister, didn\'t \'e?  You know who I mean, Grinder the greengrocer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I believe he did,\' said Crass.\r\n\r\n\'It wasn\'t Grinder\'s sister,\' chimed in old Jack Linden.  \'It was \'is\r\nniece.  I know, because I remember working in their \'ouse just after\r\nthey was married, about ten year ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, I remember now,\' said Payne.  \'She used to manage one of\r\nGrinder\'s branch shops didn\'t she?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Linden.  \'I remember it very well because there was a\r\nlot of talk about it at the time.  By all accounts, ole Sweater used to\r\nbe a regler \'ot un: no one never thought as he\'d ever git married at\r\nall: there was some funny yarns  about several young women what used to\r\nwork for him.\'\r\n\r\nThis important matter being disposed of, there followed a brief\r\nsilence, which was presently broken by Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Funny name to call a \'ouse, ain\'t it?\' he said.  \'"The Cave."  I\r\nwonder what made \'em give it a name like that.\'\r\n\r\n\'They calls \'em all sorts of outlandish names nowadays,\' said old Jack\r\nLinden.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s generally some sort of meaning to it, though,\' observed Payne.\r\n\'For instance, if a bloke backed a winner and made a pile, \'e might\r\ncall \'is \'ouse, "Epsom Lodge" or "Newmarket Villa".\'\r\n\r\n\'Or sometimes there\'s a hoak tree or a cherry tree in the garding,\'\r\nsaid another man; \'then they calls it "Hoak Lodge" or "Cherry Cottage".\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, there\'s a cave up at the end of this garden,\' said Harlow with a\r\ngrin, \'you know, the cesspool, what the drains of the \'ouse runs into;\r\npraps they called it after that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Talking about the drains,\' said old Jack Linden when the laughter\r\nproduced by this elegant joke had ceased.  \'Talking about the drains, I\r\nwonder what they\'re going to do about them; the \'ouse ain\'t fit to live\r\nin as they are now, and as for that bloody cesspool it ought to be done\r\naway with.\'\r\n\r\n\'So it is going to be,\' replied Crass.  \'There\'s going to be a new set\r\nof drains altogether, carried right out to the road and connected with\r\nthe main.\'\r\n\r\nCrass really knew no more about what was going to be done in this\r\nmatter than did Linden, but he felt certain that this course would be\r\nadopted.  He never missed an opportunity of enhancing his own prestige\r\nwith the men by insinuating that he was in the confidence of the firm.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s goin\' to cost a good bit,\' said Linden.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I suppose it will,\' replied Crass, \'but money ain\'t no object to\r\nold Sweater.  \'E\'s got tons of it; you know \'e\'s got a large wholesale\r\nbusiness in London and shops all over the bloody country, besides the\r\none \'e\'s got \'ere.\'\r\n\r\nEaston was still reading the Obscurer; he was not about to understand\r\nexactly what the compiler of the figures was driving at--probably the\r\nlatter never intended that anyone should understand--but he was\r\nconscious of a growing feeling of indignation and hatred against\r\nforeigners of every description, who were ruining this country, and he\r\nbegan to think that it was about time we did something to protect\r\nourselves.  Still, it was a very difficult question: to tell the truth,\r\nhe himself could not make head or tail of it.  At length he said aloud,\r\naddressing himself to Crass:\r\n\r\n\'Wot do you think of this \'ere fissical policy, Bob?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ain\'t thought much about it,\' replied Crass.  \'I don\'t never worry my\r\n\'ed about politics.\'\r\n\r\n\'Much better left alone,\' chimed in old Jack Linden sagely, \'argyfying\r\nabout politics generally ends up with a bloody row an\' does no good to\r\nnobody.\'\r\n\r\nAt this there was a murmur of approval from several of the others. Most\r\nof them were averse from arguing or disputing about politics.  If two\r\nor three men of similar opinions happened to be together they might\r\ndiscuss such things in a friendly and superficial way, but in a mixed\r\ncompany it was better left alone.  The \'Fissical Policy\' emanated from\r\nthe Tory party.  That was the reason why some of them were strongly in\r\nfavour of it, and for the same reason others were opposed to it.  Some\r\nof them were under the delusion that they were Conservatives:\r\nsimilarly, others imagined themselves to be Liberals. As a matter of\r\nfact, most of them were nothing.  They knew as much about the public\r\naffairs of their own country as they did of the condition of affairs in\r\nthe planet of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nEaston began to regret that he had broached so objectionable a subject,\r\nwhen, looking up from his paper, Owen said:\r\n\r\n\'Does the fact that you never "trouble your heads about politics"\r\nprevent you from voting at election times?\'\r\n\r\nNo one answered, and there ensued a brief silence.  Easton however, in\r\nspite of the snub he had received, could not refrain from talking.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t go in for politics much, either, but if what\'s in this\r\n\'ere paper is true, it seems to me as we oughter take some interest in\r\nit, when the country is being ruined by foreigners.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you\'re going to believe all that\'s in that bloody rag you\'ll want\r\nsome salt,\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\nThe Obscurer was a Tory paper and Harlow was a member of the local\r\nLiberal club.  Harlow\'s remark roused Crass.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s the use of talkin\' like that?\' he said; \'you know very well that\r\nthe country IS being ruined by foreigners.  Just go to a shop to buy\r\nsomething; look round the place an\' you\'ll see that more than \'arf the\r\ndamn stuff comes from abroad.  They\'re able to sell their goods \'ere\r\nbecause they don\'t \'ave to pay no dooty, but they takes care to put\r\n\'eavy dooties on our goods to keep \'em out of their countries; and I\r\nsay it\'s about time it was stopped.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' said Linden, who always agreed with Crass, because the\r\nlatter, being in charge of the job, had it in his power to put in a\r\ngood--or a bad--word for a man to the boss.  \'\'Ear, \'ear!  Now that\'s\r\nwot I call common sense.\'\r\n\r\nSeveral other men, for the same reason as Linden, echoed Crass\'s\r\nsentiments, but Owen laughed contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it\'s quite true that we gets a lot of stuff from foreign\r\ncountries,\' said Harlow, \'but they buys more from us than we do from\r\nthem.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now you think you know a \'ell of a lot,\' said Crass.  \'\'Ow much more\r\ndid they buy from us last year, than we did from them?\'\r\n\r\nHarlow looked foolish: as a matter of fact his knowledge of the subject\r\nwas not much wider than Crass\'s.  He mumbled something about not having\r\nno \'ed for figures, and offered to bring full particulars next day.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re wot I call a bloody windbag,\' continued Crass; \'you\'ve got a\r\n\'ell of a lot to say, but wen it comes to the point you don\'t know\r\nnothin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, even \'ere in Mugsborough,\' chimed in Sawkins--who though still\r\nlying on the dresser had been awakened by the shouting--\'We\'re overrun\r\nwith \'em!  Nearly all the waiters and the cook at the Grand Hotel where\r\nwe was working last month is foreigners.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said old Joe Philpot, tragically, \'and then thers all them\r\nHitalian horgin grinders, an\' the blokes wot sells \'ot chestnuts; an\'\r\nwen I was goin\' \'ome last night I see a lot of them Frenchies sellin\'\r\nhunions, an\' a little wile afterwards I met two more of \'em comin\' up\r\nthe street with a bear.\'\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the disquieting nature of this intelligence, Owen again\r\nlaughed, much to the indignation of the others, who thought it was a\r\nvery serious state of affairs.  It was a dam\' shame that these people\r\nwere allowed to take the bread out of English people\'s mouths: they\r\nought to be driven into the bloody sea.\r\n\r\nAnd so the talk continued, principally carried on by Crass and those\r\nwho agreed with him.  None of them really understood the subject: not\r\none of them had ever devoted fifteen consecutive minutes to the earnest\r\ninvestigation of it.  The papers they read were filled with vague and\r\nalarming accounts of the quantities of foreign merchandise imported\r\ninto this country, the enormous number of aliens constantly arriving,\r\nand their destitute conditions, how they lived, the crimes they\r\ncommitted, and the injury they did to British trade.  These were the\r\nseeds which, cunningly sown in their minds, caused to grow up within\r\nthem a bitter undiscriminating hatred of foreigners.  To them the\r\nmysterious thing they variously called the \'Friscal Policy\', the\r\n\'Fistical Policy\', or the \'Fissical Question\' was a great Anti-Foreign\r\nCrusade.  The country was in a hell of a state, poverty, hunger and\r\nmisery in a hundred forms had already invaded thousands of homes and\r\nstood upon the thresholds of thousands more.  How came these things to\r\nbe?  It was the bloody foreigner!  Therefore, down with the foreigners\r\nand all their works.  Out with them.  Drive them b--s into the bloody\r\nsea!  The country would be ruined if not protected in some way.  This\r\nFriscal, Fistical, Fissical or whatever the hell policy it was called,\r\nWAS Protection, therefore no one but a bloody fool could hesitate to\r\nsupport it.  It was all quite plain--quite simple.  One did not need to\r\nthink twice about it.  It was scarcely necessary to think about it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThis was the conclusion reached by Crass and such of his mates who\r\nthought they were Conservatives--the majority of them could not have\r\nread a dozen sentences aloud without stumbling--it was not necessary to\r\nthink or study or investigate anything.  It was all as clear as\r\ndaylight.  The foreigner was the enemy, and the cause of poverty and\r\nbad trade.\r\n\r\nWhen the storm had in some degree subsided,\r\n\r\n\'Some of you seem to think,\' said Owen, sneeringly, \'that it was a\r\ngreat mistake on God\'s part to make so many foreigners.  You ought to\r\nhold a mass meeting about it: pass a resolution something like this:\r\n"This meeting of British Christians hereby indignantly protests against\r\nthe action of the Supreme Being in having created so many foreigners,\r\nand calls upon him to forthwith rain down fire, brimstone and mighty\r\nrocks upon the heads of all those Philistines, so that they may be\r\nutterly exterminated from the face of the earth, which rightly belongs\r\nto the British people".\'\r\n\r\nCrass looked very indignant, but could think of nothing to say in\r\nanswer to Owen, who continued:\r\n\r\n\'A little while ago you made the remark that you never trouble yourself\r\nabout what you call politics, and some of the rest agreed with you that\r\nto do so is not worth while.  Well, since you never "worry" yourself\r\nabout these things, it follows that you know nothing about them; yet\r\nyou do not hesitate to express the most decided opinions concerning\r\nmatters of which you admittedly know nothing. Presently, when there is\r\nan election, you will go and vote in favour of a policy of which you\r\nknow nothing.  I say that since you never take the trouble to find out\r\nwhich side is right or wrong you have no right to express any opinion.\r\nYou are not fit to vote.  You should not be allowed to vote.\'\r\n\r\nCrass was by this time very angry.\r\n\r\n\'I pays my rates and taxes,\' he shouted, \'an\' I\'ve got as much right to\r\nexpress an opinion as you \'ave.  I votes for who the bloody \'ell I\r\nlikes.  I shan\'t arst your leave nor nobody else\'s!  Wot the \'ell\'s it\r\ngot do with you who I votes for?\'\r\n\r\n\'It has a great deal to do with me.  If you vote for Protection you\r\nwill be helping to bring it about, and if you succeed, and if\r\nProtection is the evil that some people say is is, I shall be one of\r\nthose who will suffer.  I say you have no right to vote for a policy\r\nwhich may bring suffering upon other people, without taking the trouble\r\nto find out whether you are helping to make things better or worse.\'\r\n\r\nOwen had risen from his seat and was walking up and down the room\r\nemphasizing his words with excited gestures.\r\n\r\n\'As for not trying to find out wot side is right,\' said Crass, somewhat\r\noverawed by Owen\'s manner and by what he thought was the glare of\r\nmadness in the latter\'s eyes, \'I reads the Ananias every week, and I\r\ngenerally takes the Daily Chloroform, or the Hobscurer, so I ought to\r\nknow summat about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Just listen to this,\' interrupted Easton, wishing to create a\r\ndiversion and beginning to read from the copy of the Obscurer which he\r\nstill held in his hand:\r\n\r\n  \'GREAT DISTRESS IN MUGSBOROUGH.\r\n  HUNDREDS OUT OF EMPLOYMENT.\r\n  WORK OF THE CHARITY SOCIETY.\r\n  789 CASES ON THE BOOKS.\r\n\r\n  \'Great as was the distress among the working classes last year,\r\n  unfortunately there seems every prospect that before the winter\r\n  which has just commenced is over the distress will be even more\r\n  acute.\r\n\r\n  Already the Charity Society and kindred associations are relieving\r\n  more cases than they did at the corresponding time last year.\r\n  Applications to the Board of Guardians have also been much more\r\n  numerous, and the Soup Kitchen has had to open its doors on Nov. 7th\r\n  a fortnight earlier than usual.  The number of men, women and\r\n  children provided with meals is three or four times greater than\r\n  last year.\'\r\n\r\nEaston stopped: reading was hard work to him.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s a lot more,\' he said, \'about starting relief works: two\r\nshillings a day for married men and one shilling for single and\r\nsomething about there\'s been 1,572 quarts of soup given to poor\r\nfamilies wot was not even able to pay a penny, and a lot more.  And\r\n\'ere\'s another thing, an advertisement:\r\n\r\n  \'THE SUFFERING POOR\r\n\r\n  Sir: Distress among the poor is so acute that I earnestly ask you\r\n  for aid for The Salvation Army\'s great Social work on their behalf.\r\n  Some 600 are being sheltered nightly.

Our Social Work for men, women\r\n  and children, for the characterless and the outcast, is the largest\r\n  and oldest organized effort of its kind in the country, and greatly\r\n  needs help.

Balance Sheets and Reports upon application.\r\n          \'BRAMWELL BOOTH.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that\'s part of the great \'appiness an\' prosperity wot Owen makes\r\nout Free Trade brings,\' said Crass with a jeering laugh.\r\n\r\n\'I never said Free Trade brought happiness or prosperity,\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'Well, praps you didn\'t say exactly them words, but that\'s wot it\r\namounts to.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never said anything of the kind.  We\'ve had Free Trade for the last\r\nfifty years and today most people are living in a condition of more or\r\nless abject poverty, and thousands are literally starving.  When we had\r\nProtection things were worse still.  Other countries have Protection\r\nand yet many of their people are glad to come here and work for\r\nstarvation wages.  The only difference between Free Trade and\r\nProtection is that under certain circumstances one might be a little\r\nworse that the other, but as remedies for Poverty, neither of them are\r\nof any real use whatever, for the simple reason that they do not deal\r\nwith the real causes of Poverty.\'\r\n\r\n\'The greatest cause of poverty is hover-population,\' remarked Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said old Joe Philpot.  \'If a boss wants two men, twenty goes\r\nafter the job: ther\'s too many people and not enough work.\'\r\n\r\n\'Over-population!\' cried Owen, \'when there\'s thousands of acres of\r\nuncultivated land in England without a house or human being to be seen.\r\nIs over-population the cause of poverty in France?  Is over-population\r\nthe cause of poverty in Ireland?  Within the last fifty years the\r\npopulation of Ireland has been reduced by more than half.  Four\r\nmillions of people have been exterminated by famine or got rid of by\r\nemigration, but they haven\'t got rid of poverty.  P\'raps you think that\r\nhalf the people in this country ought to be exterminated as well.\'\r\n\r\nHere Owen was seized with a violent fit of coughing, and resumed his\r\nseat.  When the cough had ceased he sat wiping his mouth with his\r\nhandkerchief and listening to the talk that ensued.\r\n\r\n\'Drink is the cause of most of the poverty,\' said Slyme.\r\n\r\nThis young man had been through some strange process that he called\r\n\'conversion\'.  He had had a \'change of \'art\' and looked down with pious\r\npity upon those he called \'worldly\' people.  He  was not \'worldly\', he\r\ndid not smoke or drink and never went to the theatre. He had an\r\nextraordinary notion that total abstinence was one of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Christian religion.  It never occurred to what he\r\ncalled his mind, that this doctrine is an insult to the Founder of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Crass, agreeing with Slyme, \'an\' thers plenty of \'em wot\'s\r\ntoo lazy to work when they can get it.  Some of the b--s who go about\r\npleading poverty \'ave never done a fair day\'s work in all their bloody\r\nlives.  Then thers all this new-fangled machinery,\' continued Crass.\r\n\'That\'s wot\'s ruinin\' everything.  Even in our trade ther\'s them\r\nmachines for trimmin\' wallpaper, an\' now they\'ve brought out a paintin\'\r\nmachine.  Ther\'s a pump an\' a \'ose pipe, an\' they reckon two men can do\r\nas much with this \'ere machine as twenty could without it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Another thing is women,\' said Harlow, \'there\'s thousands of \'em\r\nnowadays doin\' work wot oughter be done by men.\'\r\n\r\n\'In my opinion ther\'s too much of this \'ere eddication, nowadays,\'\r\nremarked old Linden.  \'Wot the \'ell\'s the good of eddication to the\r\nlikes of us?\'\r\n\r\n\'None whatever,\' said Crass, \'it just puts foolish idears into people\'s\r\n\'eds and makes \'em too lazy to work.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington, who took no part in the conversation, still sat silently\r\nsmoking.  Owen was listening to this pitiable farrago with feelings of\r\ncontempt and wonder.  Were they all hopelessly stupid?  Had their\r\nintelligence never developed beyond the childhood stage?  Or was he mad\r\nhimself?\r\n\r\n\'Early marriages is another thing,\' said Slyme: \'no man oughtn\'t to be\r\nallowed to get married unless he\'s in a position to keep a family.\'\r\n\r\n\'How can marriage be a cause of poverty?\' said Owen, contemptuously. \'A\r\nman who is not married is living an unnatural life.  Why don\'t you\r\ncontinue your argument a little further and say that the practice of\r\neating and drinking is the cause of poverty or that if people were to\r\ngo barefoot and naked there would be no poverty?  The man who is so\r\npoor that he cannot marry is in a condition of poverty already.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot I mean,\' said Slyme, \'is that no man oughtn\'t to marry till he\'s\r\nsaved up enough so as to \'ave some money in the bank; an\' another\r\nthing, I reckon a man oughtn\'t to get married till \'e\'s got an \'ouse of\r\n\'is own.  It\'s easy enough to buy one in a building society if you\'re\r\nin reg\'lar work.\'\r\n\r\nAt this there was a general laugh.\r\n\r\n\'Why, you bloody fool,\' said Harlow, scornfully, \'most of us is walkin\'\r\nabout \'arf our time.  It\'s all very well for you to talk; you\'ve got\r\nalmost a constant job on this firm.  If they\'re doin\' anything at all\r\nyou\'re one of the few gets a show in.  And another thing,\' he added\r\nwith a sneer, \'we don\'t all go to the same chapel as old Misery,\'\r\n\r\n\'Old Misery\' was Ruston & Co.\'s manager or walking foreman.  \'Misery\'\r\nwas only one of the nicknames bestowed upon him by the hands: he was\r\nalso known as \'Nimrod\' and \'Pontius Pilate\'.\r\n\r\n\'And even if it\'s not possible,\' Harlow continued, winking at the\r\nothers, \'what\'s a man to do during the years he\'s savin\' up?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, he must conquer hisself,\' said Slyme, getting red.\r\n\r\n\'Conquer hisself is right!\' said Harlow and the others laughed again.\r\n\r\n\'Of course if a man tried to conquer hisself by his own strength,\'\r\nreplied Slyme, \'\'e would be sure to fail, but when you\'ve got the Grace\r\nof God in you it\'s different.\'\r\n\r\n\'Chuck it, fer Christ\'s sake!\' said Harlow in a tone of disgust. \'We\'ve\r\nonly just \'ad our dinner!\'\r\n\r\n\'And wot about drink?\' demanded old Joe Philpot, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' cried Harlow.  \'That\'s the bleedin\'  talk.  I wouldn\'t\r\nmind \'avin \'arf a pint now, if somebody else will pay for it.\'\r\n\r\nJoe Philpot--or as he was usually called, \'Old Joe\'--was in the habit\r\nof indulging freely in the cup that inebriates.  He was not very old,\r\nbeing only a little over fifty, but he looked much older.  He had lost\r\nhis wife some five years ago and was now alone in the world, for his\r\nthree children had died in their infancy.  Slyme\'s reference to drink\r\nhad roused Philpot\'s indignation; he felt that it was directed against\r\nhimself.  The muddled condition of his brain did not permit him to take\r\nup the cudgels in his own behalf, but he knew that although Owen was a\r\ntee-totaller himself, he disliked Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no need for us to talk about drink or laziness,\' returned\r\nOwen, impatiently, \'because they have nothing to do with the matter.\r\nThe question is, what is the cause of the lifelong poverty of the\r\nmajority of those who are not drunkards and who DO work?  Why, if all\r\nthe drunkards and won\'t-works and unskilled or inefficient workers\r\ncould be by some miracle transformed into sober, industrious and\r\nskilled workers tomorrow, it would, under the present conditions, be so\r\nmuch the worse for us, because there isn\'t enough work for all NOW and\r\nthose people by increasing the competition for what work there is,\r\nwould inevitably cause a reduction of wages and a greater scarcity of\r\nemployment.  The theories that drunkenness, laziness or inefficiency\r\nare the causes of poverty are so many devices invented and fostered by\r\nthose who are selfishly interested in maintaining the present states of\r\naffairs, for the purpose of preventing us from discovering the real\r\ncauses of our present condition.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, if we\'re all wrong,\' said Crass, with a sneer, \'praps you can\r\ntell us what the real cause is?\'\r\n\r\n\'An\' praps you think you know how it\'s to be altered,\' remarked Harlow,\r\nwinking at the others.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; I do think I know the cause,\' declared Owen, \'and I do think I\r\nknow how it could be altered--\'\r\n\r\n\'It can\'t never be haltered,\' interrupted old Linden.  \'I don\'t see no\r\nsense in all this \'ere talk.  There\'s always been rich and poor in the\r\nworld, and there always will be.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot I always say is there \'ere,\' remarked Philpot, whose principal\r\ncharacteristic--apart from thirst--was a desire to see everyone\r\ncomfortable, and who hated rows of any kind.  \'There ain\'t no use in\r\nthe likes of us trubblin our \'eds or quarrelin about politics.  It\r\ndon\'t make a dam bit of difference who you votes for or who gets in.\r\nThey\'re hall the same; workin the horicle for their own benefit.  You\r\ncan talk till you\'re black in the face, but you won\'t never be able to\r\nalter it.  It\'s no use worrying.  The sensible thing is to try and make\r\nthe best of things as we find \'em: enjoy ourselves, and do the best we\r\ncan for each other.  Life\'s too short to quarrel and we\'ll hall soon be\r\ndead!\'\r\n\r\nAt the end of this lengthy speech, the philosophic Philpot abstractedly\r\ngrasped a jam-jar and raised it to his lips; but suddenly remembering\r\nthat it contained stewed tea and not beer, set it down again without\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\n\'Let us begin at the beginning,\' continued Owen, taking no notice of\r\nthese interruptions.  \'First of all, what do you mean by Poverty?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, if you\'ve got no money, of course,\' said Crass impatiently.\r\n\r\nThe others laughed disdainfully.  It seemed to them such a foolish\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s true enough as far as it goes,\' returned Owen, \'that is,\r\nas things are arranged in the world at present.  But money itself is\r\nnot wealth: it\'s of no use whatever.\'\r\n\r\nAt this there was another outburst of jeering laughter.\r\n\r\n\'Supposing for example that you and Harlow were shipwrecked on a\r\ndesolate island, and YOU had saved nothing from the wreck but a bag\r\ncontaining a thousand sovereigns, and he had a tin of biscuits and a\r\nbottle of water.\'\r\n\r\n\'Make it beer!\' cried Harlow appealingly.\r\n\r\n\'Who would be the richer man, you or Harlow?\'\r\n\r\n\'But then you see we ain\'t shipwrecked on no dissolute island at all,\'\r\nsneered Crass.  \'That\'s the worst of your arguments.  You can\'t never\r\nget very far without supposing some bloody ridclus thing or other.\r\nNever mind about supposing things wot ain\'t true; let\'s \'ave facts and\r\ncommon sense.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' said old Linden.  \'That\'s wot we want--a little common\r\nsense.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do YOU mean by poverty, then?\' asked Easton.\r\n\r\n\'What I call poverty is when people are not able to secure for\r\nthemselves all the benefits of civilization; the necessaries, comforts,\r\npleasures and refinements of life, leisure, books, theatres, pictures,\r\nmusic, holidays, travel, good and beautiful homes, good clothes, good\r\nand pleasant food.\'\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed.  It was so ridiculous.  The idea of the likes of\r\nTHEM wanting or having such things!  Any doubts that any of them had\r\nentertained as to Owen\'s sanity disappeared.  The man was as mad as a\r\nMarch hare.\r\n\r\n\'If a man is only able to provide himself and his family with the bare\r\nnecessaries of existence, that man\'s family is living in poverty. Since\r\nhe cannot enjoy the advantages of civilization he might just as well be\r\na savage: better, in fact, for a savage knows nothing of what he is\r\ndeprived.  What we call civilization--the accumulation of knowledge\r\nwhich has come down to us from our forefathers--is the fruit of\r\nthousands of years of human thought and toil.  It is not the result of\r\nthe labour of the ancestors of any separate class of people who exist\r\ntoday, and therefore it is by right the common heritage of all.  Every\r\nlittle child that is born into the world, no matter whether he is\r\nclever or full, whether he is physically perfect or lame, or blind; no\r\nmatter how much he may excel or fall short of his fellows in other\r\nrespects, in one thing at least he is their equal--he is one of the\r\nheirs of all the ages that have gone before.\'\r\n\r\nSome of them began to wonder whether Owen was not sane after all.  He\r\ncertainly must be a clever sort of chap to be able to talk like this.\r\nIt sounded almost like something out of a book, and most of them could\r\nnot understand one half of it.\r\n\r\n\'Why is it,\' continued Owen, \'that we are not only deprived of our\r\ninheritance--we are not only deprived of nearly all the benefits of\r\ncivilization, but we and our children are also often unable to obtain\r\neven the bare necessaries of existence?\'\r\n\r\nNo one answered.\r\n\r\n\'All these things,\' Owen proceeded, \'are produced by those who work. We\r\ndo our full share of the work, therefore we should have a full share of\r\nthe things that are made by work.\'\r\n\r\nThe others continued silent.  Harlow thought of the over-population\r\ntheory, but decided not to mention it.  Crass, who could not have given\r\nan intelligent answer to save his life, for once had sufficient sense\r\nto remain silent.  He did think of calling out the patent paint-pumping\r\nmachine and bringing the hosepipe to bear on the subject, but abandoned\r\nthe idea; after all, he thought, what was the use of arguing with such\r\na fool as Owen?\r\n\r\nSawkins pretended to be asleep.\r\n\r\nPhilpot, however, had suddenly grown very serious.\r\n\r\n\'As things are now,\' went on Owen, \'instead of enjoying the advantages\r\nof civilization we are really worse off than slaves, for if we were\r\nslaves our owners in their own interest would see to it that we always\r\nhad food and--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I don\'t see that,\' roughly interrupted old Linden, who had been\r\nlistening with evident anger and impatience.  \'You can speak for\r\nyourself, but I can tell yer I don\'t put MYSELF down as a slave.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor me neither,\' said Crass sturdily.  \'Let them call their selves\r\nslaves as wants to.\'\r\n\r\nAt this moment a footstep was heard in the passage leading to the\r\nkitchen.  Old Misery! or perhaps the bloke himself!  Crass hurriedly\r\npulled out his watch.\r\n\r\n\'Jesus Christ!\' he gasped.  \'It\'s four minutes past one!\'\r\n\r\nLinden frantically seized hold of a pair of steps and began wandering\r\nabout the room with them.\r\n\r\nSawkins scrambled hastily to his feet and, snatching a piece of\r\nsandpaper from the pocket of his apron, began furiously rubbing down\r\nthe scullery door.\r\n\r\nEaston threw down the copy of the Obscurer and scrambled hastily to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe boy crammed the Chronicles of Crime into his trousers pocket.\r\n\r\nCrass rushed over to the bucket and began stirring up the stale\r\nwhitewash it contained, and the stench which it gave forth was simply\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\nConsternation reigned.\r\n\r\nThey looked like a gang of malefactors suddenly interrupted in the\r\ncommission of a crime.\r\n\r\nThe door opened.  It was only Bundy returning from his mission to the\r\nBookie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nNimrod: a Mighty Hunter before the Lord\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Hunter, as he was called to his face and as he was known to his\r\nbrethren at the Shining Light Chapel, where he was superintendant of\r\nthe Sunday School, or \'Misery\' or \'Nimrod\'; as he was named behind his\r\nback by the workmen over whom he tyrannized, was the general or walking\r\nforeman or \'manager\' of the firm whose card is herewith presented to\r\nthe reader:\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RUSHTON & CO.\r\n                             MUGSBOROUGH\r\n                               -------\r\n            Builders, Decorators, and General Contractors\r\n                         FUNERALS FURNISHED\r\n        Estimates given for General Repairs to House Property\r\n              First-class Work only at Moderate Charges\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were a number of sub-foremen or \'coddies\', but Hunter was THE\r\nforeman.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, thin man whose clothes hung loosely on the angles of his\r\nround-shouldered, bony form.  His long, thin legs, about which the\r\nbaggy trousers draped in ungraceful folds, were slightly knock-kneed\r\nand terminated in large, flat feet.  His arms were very long even for\r\nsuch a tall man, and the huge, bony hands were gnarled and knotted.\r\nWhen he removed his bowler hat, as he frequently did to wipe away with\r\na red handkerchief the sweat occasioned by furious bicycle riding, it\r\nwas seen that his forehead was high, flat and narrow.  His nose was a\r\nlarge, fleshy, hawklike beak, and from the side of each nostril a deep\r\nindentation extended downwards until it disappeared in the dropping\r\nmoustache that concealed his mouth, the vast extent of which was\r\nperceived only when he opened it to bellow at the workmen his\r\nexhortations to greater exertions.  His chin was large and\r\nextraordinarily long.  The eyes were pale blue, very small and close\r\ntogether, surmounted by spare, light-coloured, almost invisible\r\neyebrows, with a deep vertical cleft between them over the nose.  His\r\nhead, covered with thick, coarse brown hair, was very large at the\r\nback; the ears were small and laid close to the head.  If one were to\r\nmake a full-face drawing of his cadaverous visage it would be found\r\nthat the outline resembled that of the lid of a coffin.\r\n\r\nThis man had been with Rushton--no one had ever seen the \'Co.\'--for\r\nfifteen years, in fact almost from the time when the latter commenced\r\nbusiness.  Rushton had at that period realized the necessity of having\r\na deputy who could be used to do all the drudgery and running about so\r\nthat he himself might be free to attend to the more pleasant or\r\nprofitable matters.  Hunter was then a journeyman, but was on the point\r\nof starting on his own account, when Rushton offered him a constant job\r\nas foreman, two pounds a week, and two and a half per cent of the\r\nprofits of all work done.  On the face of it this appeared a generous\r\noffer.  Hunter closed with it, gave up the idea of starting for\r\nhimself, and threw himself heart and mind into the business.  When an\r\nestimate was to be prepared it was Hunter who measured up the work and\r\nlaboriously figured out the probably cost.  When their tenders were\r\naccepted it was he who superintended the work and schemed how to scamp\r\nit, where possible, using mud where mortar was specified, mortar where\r\nthere ought to have been cement, sheet zinc where they were supposed to\r\nput sheet lead, boiled oil instead of varnish, and three coats of paint\r\nwhere five were paid for.  In fact, scamping the work was with this man\r\na kind of mania.  It grieved him to see anything done properly.  Even\r\nwhen it was more economical to do a thing well, he insisted from force\r\nof habit on having it scamped.  Then he was almost happy, because he\r\nfelt that he was doing someone down.  If there were an architect\r\nsuperintending the work, Misery would square him or bluff him.  If it\r\nwere not possible to do either, at least he had a try; and in the\r\nintervals of watching, driving and bullying the hands, his vulture eye\r\nwas ever on the look out for fresh jobs.  His long red nose was thrust\r\ninto every estate agent\'s office in the town in the endeavour to smell\r\nout what properties had recently changed hands or been let, in order\r\nthat he might interview the new owners and secure the order for\r\nwhatever alterations or repairs might be required.  He it was who\r\nentered into unholy compacts with numerous charwomen and nurses of the\r\nsick, who in return for a small commission would let him know when some\r\npoor sufferer was passing away and would recommend Rushton & Co. to the\r\nbereaved and distracted relatives.  By these means often--after first\r\ncarefully inquiring into the financial position of the stricken\r\nfamily--Misery would contrive to wriggle his unsavoury carcass into the\r\nhouse of sorrow, seeking, even in the chamber of death, to further the\r\ninterests of Rushton & Co. and to earn his miserable two and a half per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nIt was to make possible the attainment of this object that Misery\r\nslaved and drove and schemed and cheated.  It was for this that the\r\nworkers\' wages were cut down to the lowest possible point and their\r\noffspring went ill clad, ill shod and ill fed, and were driven forth to\r\nlabour while they were yet children, because their fathers were unable\r\nto earn enough to support their homes.\r\n\r\nFifteen years!\r\n\r\nHunter realized now that Rushton had had considerably the best of the\r\nbargain.  In the first place, it will be seen that the latter had\r\nbought over one who might have proved a dangerous competitor, and now,\r\nafter fifteen years, the business that had been so laboriously built\r\nup, mainly by Hunter\'s energy, industry and unscrupulous cunning,\r\nbelonged to Rushton & Co.  Hunter was but an employee, liable to\r\ndismissal like any other workman, the only difference being that he was\r\nentitled to a week\'s notice instead of an hour\'s notice, and was but\r\nlittle better off financially than when he started for the firm.\r\n\r\nFifteen years!\r\n\r\nHunter knew now that he had been used, but he also knew that it was too\r\nlate to turn back.  He had not saved enough to make a successful start\r\non his own account even if he had felt mentally and physically capable\r\nof beginning all over again, and if Rushton were to discharge him right\r\nnow he was too old to get a job as a journeyman.  Further, in his zeal\r\nfor Rushton & Co. and his anxiety to earn his commission, he had often\r\ndone things that had roused the animosity of rival firms to such an\r\nextent that it was highly improbable that any of them would employ him,\r\nand even if they would, Misery\'s heart failed him at the thought of\r\nhaving to meet on an equal footing those workmen whom he had tyrannized\r\nover and oppressed.  It was for these reasons that Hunter was as\r\nterrified of Rushton as the hands were of himself.\r\n\r\nOver the men stood Misery, ever threatening them with dismissal and\r\ntheir wives and children with hunger.  Behind Misery was Rushton, ever\r\nbullying and goading him on to greater excesses and efforts for the\r\nfurtherance of the good cause--which was to enable the head of the firm\r\nto accumulate money.\r\n\r\nMr Hunter, at the moment when the reader first makes his acquaintance\r\non the afternoon of the day when the incidents recorded in the first\r\nchapter took place, was executing a kind of strategic movement in the\r\ndirection of the house where Crass and his mates were working.  He kept\r\nto one side of the road because by so doing he could not be perceived\r\nby those within the house until the instant of his arrival. When he was\r\nwithin about a hundred yards of the gate he dismounted from his\r\nbicycle, there being a sharp rise in the road just there, and as he\r\ntoiled up, pushing the bicycle in front, his breath showing in white\r\nclouds in the frosty air, he observed a number of men hanging about.\r\nSome of them he knew; they had worked for him at various times, but\r\nwere now out of a job.  There were five men altogether; three of them\r\nwere standing in a group, the other two stood each by himself, being\r\napparently strangers to each other and the first three. The three men\r\nwho stood together were nearest to Hunter and as the latter approached,\r\none of them advanced to meet him.\r\n\r\n\'Good afternoon, sir.\'\r\n\r\nHunter replied by an inarticulate grunt, without stopping; the man\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\'Any chance of a job, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'Full up,\' replied Hunter, still without stopping.  The man still\r\nfollowed, like a beggar soliciting charity.\r\n\r\n\'Be any use calling in a day or so, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t think so,\' Hunter replied.  \'Can if you like; but we\'re full up.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, sir,\' said the man, and turned back to his friends.\r\n\r\nBy this time Hunter was within a few yards of one of the other two men,\r\nwho also came to speak to him.  This man felt there was no hope of\r\ngetting a job; still, there was no harm in asking.  Besides, he was\r\ngetting desperate.  It was over a month now since he had finished up\r\nfor his last employer.  It had been a very slow summer altogether.\r\nSometimes a fortnight for one firm; then perhaps a week doing nothing;\r\nthen three weeks or a month for another firm, then out again, and so\r\non.  And  now it was November.  Last winter they had got into debt;\r\nthat was nothing unusual, but owing to the bad summer they had not been\r\nable, as in other years, to pay off the debts accumulated in winter.\r\nIt was doubtful, too, whether they would be able to get credit again\r\nthis winter.  In fact this morning when his wife sent their little girl\r\nto the grocer\'s for some butter the latter had refused to let the child\r\nhave it without the money.  So although he felt it to be useless he\r\naccosted Hunter.\r\n\r\nThis time Hunter stopped: he was winded by his climb up the hill.\r\n\r\n\'Good afternoon, sir.\' Hunter did not return the salutation; he had not\r\nthe breath to spare, but the man was not hurt; he was used to being\r\ntreated like that.\r\n\r\n\'Any chance of a job, sir?\'\r\n\r\nHunter did not reply at once.  He was short of breath and he was\r\nthinking of a plan that was ever recurring to his mind, and which he\r\nhad lately been hankering to put into execution.  It seemed to him that\r\nthe long waited for opportunity had come.  Just now Rushton & Co. were\r\nalmost the only firm in Mugsborough who had any work.  There were\r\ndozens of good workmen out.  Yes, this was the time.  If this man\r\nagreed he would give him a start.  Hunter knew the man was a good\r\nworkman, he had worked for Rushton & Co. before.  To make room for him\r\nold Linden and some other full-price man could be got rid of; it would\r\nnot be difficult to find some excuse.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' Hunter said at last in a doubtful, hesitating kind of way, \'I\'m\r\nafraid not, Newman.  We\'re about full up.\'\r\n\r\nHe ceased speaking and remained waiting for the other to say something\r\nmore.  He did not look at the man, but stooped down, fidgeting with the\r\nmechanism of the bicycle as if adjusting it.\r\n\r\n\'Things have been so bad this summer,\' Newman went on.  \'I\'ve had\r\nrather a rough time of it.  I would be very glad of a job even if it\r\nwas only for a week or so.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.  After a while, Hunter raised his eyes to the\r\nother\'s face, but immediately let them fall again.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said he, \'I might--perhaps--be able to let you have a day or\r\ntwo.  You can come here to this job,\' and he nodded his head in the\r\ndirection of the house where the men were working.  \'Tomorrow at seven.\r\nOf course you know the figure?\' he added as Newman was about to thank\r\nhim.  \'Six and a half.\'\r\n\r\nHunter spoke as if the reduction were already an accomplished fact. The\r\nman was more likely to agree, if he thought that others were already\r\nworking at the reduced rate.\r\n\r\nNewman was taken by surprise and hesitated.  He had never worked under\r\nprice; indeed, he had sometimes gone hungry rather than do so; but now\r\nit seemed that others were doing it.  And then he was so awfully hard\r\nup.  If he refused this job he was not likely to get another in a\r\nhurry.  He thought of his home and his family.  Already they owed five\r\nweeks\' rent, and last Monday the collector had hinted pretty plainly\r\nthat the landlord would not wait much longer.  Not only that, but if he\r\ndid not get a job how were they to live?  This morning he himself had\r\nhad no breakfast to speak of, only a cup of tea and some dry bread.\r\nThese thoughts crowded upon each other in his mind, but still he\r\nhesitated.  Hunter began to move off.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' he said, \'if you like to start you can come here at seven in\r\nthe morning.\'  Then as Newman still hesitated he added impatiently,\r\n\'Are you coming or not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' said Newman.\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Hunter, affably.  \'I\'ll tell Crass to have a kit\r\nready for you.\'\r\n\r\nHe nodded in a friendly way to the man, who went off feeling like a\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nAs Hunter resumed his march, well pleased with himself, the fifth man,\r\nwho had been waiting all this time, came to meet him.  As he\r\napproached, Hunter recognized him as one who had started work for\r\nRushton & Co early in the summer, but who had left suddenly of his own\r\naccord, having taken offence at some bullying remark of Hunter\'s.\r\n\r\nHunter was glad to see this man.  He guessed that the fellow must be\r\nvery hard pressed to come again and ask for work after what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\'Any chance of a job, sir?\'\r\n\r\nHunter appeared to reflect.\r\n\r\n\'I believe I have room for one,\' he said at length.  \'But you\'re such\r\nan uncertain kind of chap.  You don\'t seem to care much whether you\r\nwork or not.  You\'re too independent, you know; one can\'t say two words\r\nto you but you must needs clear off.\'\r\n\r\nThe man made no answer.\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t tolerate that kind of thing, you know,\' Hunter added.  \'If we\r\nwere to encourage men of your stamp we should never know where we are.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, Hunter moved away and again proceeded on his journey.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived within about three yards of the gate he noiselessly\r\nlaid his machine against the garden fence.  The high evergreens that\r\ngrew inside still concealed him from the observation of anyone who\r\nmight be looking out of the windows of the house.  Then he carefully\r\ncrept along till he came to the gate post, and bending down, he\r\ncautiously peeped round to see if he could detect anyone idling, or\r\ntalking, or smoking.  There was no one in sight except old Jack Linden,\r\nwho was rubbing down the lobby doors with pumice-stone and water.\r\nHunter noiselessly opened the gate and crept quietly along the grass\r\nborder of the garden path.  His idea was to reach the front door\r\nwithout being seen, so that Linden could not give notice of his\r\napproach to those within.  In this he succeeded and passed silently\r\ninto the house.  He did not speak to Linden; to do so would have\r\nproclaimed his presence to the rest.  He crawled stealthily over the\r\nhouse but was disappointed in his quest, for everyone he saw was hard\r\nat work.  Upstairs he noticed that the door of one of the rooms was\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nOld Joe Philpot had been working in this room all day, washing off the\r\nold whitewash from the ceiling and removing the old papers from the\r\nwalls with a broad bladed, square topped knife called a stripper.\r\nAlthough it was only a small room, Joe had had to tear into the work\r\npretty hard all the time, for the ceiling seemed to have had two or\r\nthree coats of whitewash without ever having been washed off, and there\r\nwere several thicknesses of paper on the walls.  The difficulty of\r\nremoving these papers was increased by the fact that there was a dado\r\nwhich had been varnished.  In order to get this off it had been\r\nnecessary to soak it several times with strong soda water, and although\r\nJoe was as careful as possible he had not been able to avoid getting\r\nsome of this stuff on his fingers.  The result was that his nails were\r\nall burnt and discoloured and the flesh round them cracked and\r\nbleeding.  However, he had got it all off at last, and he was not\r\nsorry, for his right arm and shoulder were aching from the prolonged\r\nstrain and in the palm of the right hand there was a blister as large\r\nas a shilling, caused by the handle of the stripping knife.\r\n\r\nAll the old paper being off, Joe washed down the walls with water, and\r\nhaving swept the paper into a heap in the middle of the floor, he mixed\r\nwith a small trowel some cement on a small board and proceeded to stop\r\nup the cracks and holes in the walls and ceiling.  After a while,\r\nfeeling very tired, it occurred to him that he deserved a spell and a\r\nsmoke for five minutes.  He closed the door and placed a pair of steps\r\nagainst it.  There were two windows in the room almost opposite each\r\nother; these he opened wide in order that the smoke and smell of his\r\npipe might be carried away.  Having taken these precautions against\r\nsurprise, he ascended to the top of the step ladder that he had laid\r\nagainst the door and sat down at ease.  Within easy reach was the top\r\nof a cupboard where he had concealed a pint of beer in a bottle.  To\r\nthis he now applied himself.  Having taken a long pull at the bottle,\r\nhe tenderly replaced it on the top of the cupboard and proceeded to\r\n\'hinjoy\' a quiet smoke, remarking to himself:\r\n\r\n\'This is where we get some of our own back.\'\r\n\r\nHe held, however, his trowel in one hand, ready for immediate action in\r\ncase of interruption.\r\n\r\nPhilpot was about fifty-five years old.  He wore no white jacket, only\r\nan old patched apron; his trousers were old, very soiled with paint and\r\nragged at the bottoms of the legs where they fell over the\r\nmuch-patched, broken and down-at-heel boots.  The part of his waistcoat\r\nnot protected by his apron was covered with spots of dried paint.  He\r\nwore a coloured shirt and a \'dickey\' which was very soiled and covered\r\nwith splashes of paint, and one side of it was projecting from the\r\nopening of the waistcoat.  His head was covered with an old cap, heavy\r\nand shining with paint.  He was very thin and stooped slightly.\r\nAlthough he was really only fifty-five, he looked much older, for he\r\nwas prematurely aged.\r\n\r\nHe had not been getting his own back for quite five minutes when Hunter\r\nsoftly turned the handle of the lock.  Philpot immediately put out his\r\npipe and descending from his perch opened the door.  When Hunter\r\nentered Philpot closed it again and, mounting the steps, went on\r\nstripping the wall just above.  Nimrod looked at him suspiciously,\r\nwondering why the door had been closed.  He looked all round the room\r\nbut could see nothing to complain of.  He sniffed the air to try if he\r\ncould detect the odour of tobacco, and if he had not been suffering a\r\ncold in the head there is no doubt that he would have perceived it.\r\nHowever, as it was he could smell nothing but all the same he was not\r\nquite satisfied, although he remembered that Crass always gave Philpot\r\na good character.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like to have men working on a job like this with the door\r\nshut,\' he said at length.  \'It always gives me the idear that the man\'s\r\n\'avin a mike.  You can do what you\'re doin\' just as well with the door\r\nopen.\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot, muttering something about it being all the same to him--shut\r\nor open--got down from the steps and opened the door.  Hunter went out\r\nagain without making any further remark and once more began crawling\r\nover the house.\r\n\r\nOwen was working by himself in a room on the same floor as Philpot. He\r\nwas at the window, burning off with a paraffin torch-lamp those parts\r\nof the old paintwork that were blistered and cracked.\r\n\r\nIn this work the flame of the lamp is directed against the old paint,\r\nwhich becomes soft and is removed with a chisel knife, or a scraper\r\ncalled a shavehook.  The door was ajar and he had opened the top sash\r\nof the window for the purpose of letting in some fresh air, because the\r\natmosphere of the room was foul with the fumes of the lamp and the\r\nsmell of the burning paint, besides being heavy with moisture. The\r\nceiling had only just been water washed and the walls had just been\r\nstripped.  The old paper, saturated with water, was piled up in a heap\r\nin the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\nPresently, as he was working he began to feel conscious of some other\r\npresence in the room; he looked round.  The door was open about six\r\ninches and in the opening appeared a long, pale face with a huge chin,\r\nsurmounted by a bowler hat and ornamented with a large red nose, a\r\ndrooping moustache and two small, glittering eyes set very close\r\ntogether.  For some seconds this apparition regarded Owen intently,\r\nthen it was silently withdrawn, and he was again alone.  He had been so\r\nsurprised and startled that he had nearly dropped the lamp, and now\r\nthat the ghastly countenance was gone, Owen felt the blood surge into\r\nhis own cheeks.  He trembled with suppressed fury and longed to be able\r\nto go out there on the landing and hurl the lamp into Hunter\'s face.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the landing outside Owen\'s door, Hunter stood thinking.\r\nSomeone must be got rid of to make room for the cheap man tomorrow. He\r\nhad hoped to catch somebody doing something that would have served as\r\nan excuse for instant dismissal, but there was now no hope of that\r\nhappening.  What was to be done?  He would like to get rid of Linden,\r\nwho was now really too old to be of much use, but as the old man had\r\nworked for Rushton on and off for many years, Hunter felt that he could\r\nscarcely sack him off hand without some reasonable pretext. Still, the\r\nfellow was really not worth the money  he was getting. Sevenpence an\r\nhour was an absurdly large wage for an old man like him. It was\r\npreposterous: he would have to go, excuse or no excuse.\r\n\r\nHunter crawled downstairs again.\r\n\r\nJack Linden was about sixty-seven years old, but like Philpot, and as\r\nis usual with working men, he appeared older, because he had had to\r\nwork very hard all his life, frequently without proper food and\r\nclothing.  His life had been passed in the midst of a civilization\r\nwhich he had never been permitted to enjoy the benefits of.  But of\r\ncourse he knew nothing about all this.  He had never expected or wished\r\nto be allowed to enjoy such things; he had always been of opinion that\r\nthey were never intended for the likes of him.  He called himself a\r\nConservative and was very patriotic.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Boer War commenced, Linden was an enthusiastic\r\njingo: his enthusiasm had been somewhat damped when his youngest son, a\r\nreservist, had to go to the front, where he died of fever and exposure.\r\nWhen this soldier son went away, he left his wife and two children,\r\naged respectively four and five years at that time, in his father\'s\r\ncare.  After he died they stayed on with the old people.  The young\r\nwoman earned a little occasionally by doing needlework, but was really\r\ndependent on her father-in-law.  Notwithstanding his poverty, he was\r\nglad to have them in the house, because of late years his wife had been\r\ngetting very feeble, and, since the shock occasioned by the news of the\r\ndeath of her son, needed someone constantly with her.\r\n\r\nLinden was still working at the vestibule doors when the manager came\r\ndownstairs.  Misery stood watching him for some minutes without\r\nspeaking.  At last he said loudly:\r\n\r\n\'How much longer are you going to be messing about those doors?  Why\r\ndon\'t you get them under colour?  You were fooling about there when I\r\nwas here this morning.  Do you think it\'ll pay to have you playing\r\nabout there hour after hour with a bit of pumice stone?  Get the work\r\ndone!  Or if you don\'t want to, I\'ll very soon find someone else who\r\ndoes!  I\'ve been noticing your style of doing things for some time past\r\nand I want you to understand that you can\'t play the fool with me.\r\nThere\'s plenty of better men than you walking about.  If you can\'t do\r\nmore than you\'ve been doing lately you can clear out; we can do without\r\nyou even when we\'re busy.\'\r\n\r\nOld Jack trembled.  He tried to answer, but was unable to speak.  If he\r\nhad been a slave and had failed to satisfy his master, the latter might\r\nhave tied him up somewhere and thrashed him.  Hunter could not do that;\r\nhe could only take his food away.  Old Jack was frightened--it was not\r\nonly HIS food that might be taken away.  At last, with a great effort,\r\nfor the words seemed to stick in his throat, he said:\r\n\r\n\'I must clean the work down, sir, before I go on painting.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not talking about what you\'re doing, but the time it takes you to\r\ndo it!\' shouted Hunter.  \'And I don\'t want any back answers or argument\r\nabout it.  You must move yourself a bit quicker or leave it alone\r\naltogether.\'\r\n\r\nLinden did not answer: he went on with his work, his hand trembling to\r\nsuch an extent that he was scarcely able to hold the pumice stone.\r\n\r\nHunter shouted so loud that his voice filled all the house.  Everyone\r\nheard and was afraid.  Who would be the next? they thought.\r\n\r\nFinding that Linden made no further answer, Misery again began walking\r\nabout the house.\r\n\r\nAs he looked at them the men did their work in a nervous, clumsy, hasty\r\nsort of way.  They made all sorts of mistakes and messes. Payne, the\r\nforeman carpenter, was putting some new boards on a part of the\r\ndrawing-room floor: he was in such a state of panic that, while driving\r\na nail, he accidentally struck the thumb of his left hand a severe blow\r\nwith his hammer.  Bundy was also working in the drawing-room putting\r\nsome white-glazed tiles in the fireplace.  Whilst cutting one of these\r\nin half in order to fit it into its place, he inflicted a deep gash on\r\none of his fingers.  He was afraid to leave off to bind it up while\r\nHunter was there, and consequently as he worked the white tiles became\r\nall smeared and spattered with blood.  Easton, who was working with\r\nHarlow on a plank, washing off the old distemper from the hall ceiling,\r\nwas so upset that he was scarcely able  to stand on the plank, and\r\npresently the brush fell from his trembling hand with a crash upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nEveryone was afraid.  They knew that it was impossible to get a job for\r\nany other firm.  They knew that this man had the power to deprive them\r\nof the means of earning a living; that he possessed the power to\r\ndeprive their children of bread.\r\n\r\nOwen, listening to Hunter over the banisters upstairs, felt that he\r\nwould like to take him by the throat with one hand and smash his face\r\nin with the other.\r\n\r\nAnd then?\r\n\r\nWhy then he would be sent to gaol, or at the best he would lose his\r\nemployment: his food and that of his family would be taken away.  That\r\nwas why he only ground his teeth and cursed and beat the wall with his\r\nclenched fist.  So! and so! and so!\r\n\r\nIf it were not for them!\r\n\r\nOwen\'s imagination ran riot.\r\n\r\nFirst he would seize him by the collar with his left hand, dig his\r\nknuckles into his throat, force him up against the wall and then, with\r\nhis right fist, smash! smash! smash! until Hunter\'s face was all cut\r\nand covered with blood.\r\n\r\nBut then, what about those at home?  Was it not braver and more manly\r\nto endure in silence?\r\n\r\nOwen leaned against the wall, white-faced, panting and exhausted.\r\n\r\nDownstairs, Misery was still going to and fro in the house and walking\r\nup and down in it.  Presently he stopped to look at Sawkins\' work. This\r\nman was painting the woodwork of the back staircase.  Although the old\r\npaintwork here was very dirty and greasy, Misery had given orders that\r\nit was not to be cleaned before being painted.\r\n\r\n\'Just dust it down and slobber the colour on,\' he had said.\r\nConsequently, when Crass made the paint, he had put into it an extra\r\nlarge quantity of dryers.  To a certain extent this destroyed the\r\n\'body\' of the colour: it did not cover well; it would require two\r\ncoats.  When Hunter perceived this he was furious.  He was sure it\r\ncould be made to do with one coat with a little care; he believed\r\nSawkins was doing it like this on purpose.  Really, these men seemed to\r\nhave no conscience.\r\n\r\nTwo coats! and he had estimated for only three.\r\n\r\n\'Crass!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come here!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\nCrass came hurrying along.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the meaning of this?  Didn\'t I tell you to make this do with\r\none coat?  Look at it!\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s like this, sir,\' said Crass.  \'If it had been washed down--\'\r\n\r\n\'Washed down be damned,\' shouted Hunter.  \'The reason is that the\r\ncolour ain\'t thick enough.  Take the paint and put a little more body\r\nin it and we\'ll soon see whether it can be done or not.  I can make it\r\ncover if you can\'t.\'\r\n\r\nCrass took the paint, and, superintended by Hunter, made it thicker.\r\nMisery then seized the brush and prepared to demonstrate the\r\npossibility of finishing the work with one coat.  Crass and Sawkins\r\nlooked on in silence.\r\n\r\nJust as Misery was about to commence he fancied he heard someone\r\nwhispering somewhere.  He laid down the brush and crawled stealthily\r\nupstairs to see who it was.  Directly his back was turned Crass seized\r\na bottle of oil that was standing near and, tipping about half a pint\r\nof it into the paint, stirred it up quickly.  Misery returned almost\r\nimmediately: he had not caught anyone; it must have been fancy.  He\r\ntook up the brush and began to paint.  The result was worse than\r\nSawkins!\r\n\r\nHe messed and fooled about for some time, but could not make it come\r\nright.  At last he gave it up.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose it\'ll have to have two coats after all,\' he said,\r\nmournfully.  \'But it\'s a thousand pities.\'\r\n\r\nHe almost wept.\r\n\r\nThe firm would be ruined if things went on like this.\r\n\r\n\'You\'d better go on with it,\' he said as he laid down the brush.\r\n\r\nHe began to walk about the house again.  He wanted to go away now, but\r\nhe did not want them to know that he was gone, so he sneaked out of the\r\nback door, crept around the house and out of the gate, mounted his\r\nbicycle and rode away.\r\n\r\nNo one saw him go.\r\n\r\nFor some time the only sounds that broke the silence were the noises\r\nmade by the hands as they worked.  The musical ringing of Bundy\'s\r\ntrowel, the noise of the carpenters\' hammers and saws and the\r\noccasional moving of a pair of steps.\r\n\r\nNo one dared to speak.\r\n\r\nAt last Philpot could stand it no longer.  He was very thirsty.\r\n\r\nHe had kept the door of his room open since Hunter arrived.\r\n\r\nHe listened intently.  He felt certain that Hunter must be gone: he\r\nlooked across the landing and could see Owen working in the front room.\r\nPhilpot made a little ball of paper and threw it at him to attract his\r\nattention.  Owen looked round and Philpot began to make signals: he\r\npointed downwards with one hand and jerked the thumb of the other over\r\nhis shoulder in the direction of the town, winking grotesquely the\r\nwhile.  This Owen interpreted to be an inquiry as to whether Hunter had\r\ndeparted.  He shook his head and shrugged his shoulders to intimate\r\nthat he did not know.\r\n\r\nPhilpot cautiously crossed the landing and peeped furtively over the\r\nbanisters, listening breathlessly.  \'Was it gorn or not?\' he wondered.\r\n\r\nHe crept along on tiptoe towards Owen\'s room, glancing left and right,\r\nthe trowel in his hand, and looking like a stage murderer.  \'Do you\r\nthink it\'s gorn?\' he asked in a hoarse whisper when he reached Owen\'s\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know,\' replied Owen in a low tone.\r\n\r\nPhilpot wondered.  He MUST have a drink, but it would never do for\r\nHunter to see him with the bottle: he must find out somehow whether he\r\nwas gone or not.\r\n\r\nAt last an idea came.  He would go downstairs to get some more cement.\r\nHaving confided this plan to Owen, he crept quietly back to the room in\r\nwhich he had been working, then he walked noisily across the landing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\'Got a bit of stopping to spare, Frank?\' he asked in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' replied Owen.  \'I\'m not using it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I suppose I\'ll have to go down and get some.  Is there anything I\r\ncan bring up for you?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, thanks,\' replied Owen.\r\n\r\nPhilpot marched boldly down to the scullery, which Crass had utilized\r\nas a paint-shop.  Crass was there mixing some colour.\r\n\r\n\'I want a bit of stopping,\' Philpot said as he helped himself to some.\r\n\r\n\'Is the b--r gorn?\' whispered Crass.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know,\' replied Philpot.  \'Where\'s his bike?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E always leaves it outside the gate, so\'s we can\'t see it,\' replied\r\nCrass.\r\n\r\n\'Tell you what,\' whispered Philpot, after a pause.  \'Give the boy a\r\nhempty bottle and let \'im go to the gate and look to the bikes there.\r\nIf Misery sees him \'e can pretend to be goin\' to the shop for some\r\nhoil.\'\r\n\r\nThis was done.  Bert went to the gate and returned almost immediately:\r\nthe bike was gone.  As the good news spread through the house a chorus\r\nof thanksgiving burst forth.\r\n\r\n\'Thank Gord!\' said one.\r\n\r\n\'Hope the b--r falls orf and breaks \'is bloody neck,\' said another.\r\n\r\n\'These Bible-thumpers are all the same; no one ever knew one to be any\r\ngood yet,\' cried a third.\r\n\r\nDirectly they knew for certain that he was gone, nearly everyone left\r\noff work for a few minutes to curse him.   Then they again went on\r\nworking and now that they were relieved of the embarrassment that\r\nMisery\'s presence inspired, they made better progress.  A few of them\r\nlit their pipes and smoked as they worked.\r\n\r\nOne of these was old Jack Linden.  He was upset by the bullying he had\r\nreceived, and when he noticed some of the others smoking he thought he\r\nwould have a pipe; it might steady his nerves.  As a rule he did not\r\nsmoke when working; it was contrary to orders.\r\n\r\nAs Philpot was returning to work again he paused for a moment to\r\nwhisper to Linden, with the result that the latter accompanied him\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Philpot\'s room the latter placed the step-ladder near the\r\ncupboard and, taking down the bottle of beer, handed it to Linden with\r\nthe remark, \'Get some of that acrost yer, matey; it\'ll put yer right.\'\r\n\r\nWhile Linden was taking a hasty drink, Joe kept watch on the landing\r\noutside in case Hunter should suddenly and unexpectedly reappear.\r\n\r\nWhen Linden was gone downstairs again, Philpot, having finished what\r\nremained of the beer and hidden the bottle up the chimney, resumed the\r\nwork of stopping up the holes and cracks in the ceiling and walls.  He\r\nmust make a bit of a show tonight or there would be a hell of a row\r\nwhen Misery came in the morning.\r\n\r\nOwen worked on in a disheartened, sullen way.  He felt like a beaten\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nHe was more indignant on poor old Linden\'s account than on his own, and\r\nwas oppressed by a sense of impotence and shameful degradation.\r\n\r\nAll his life it had been the same: incessant work under similar more or\r\nless humiliating conditions, and with no more result than being just\r\nable to avoid starvation.\r\n\r\nAnd the future, as far as he could see, was as hopeless as the past;\r\ndarker, for there would surely come a time, if he lived long enough,\r\nwhen he would be unable to work any more.\r\n\r\nHe thought of his child.  Was he to be a slave and a drudge all his\r\nlife also?\r\n\r\nIt would be better for the boy to die now.\r\n\r\nAs Owen thought of his child\'s future there sprung up within him a\r\nfeeling of hatred and fury against the majority of his fellow workmen.\r\n\r\nTHEY WERE THE ENEMY.  Those who not only quietly submitted like so many\r\ncattle to the existing state of things, but defended it, and opposed\r\nand ridiculed any suggestion to alter it.\r\n\r\nTHEY WERE THE REAL OPPRESSORS--the men who spoke of themselves as \'The\r\nlikes of us,\' who, having lived in poverty and degradation all their\r\nlives considered that what had been good enough for them was good\r\nenough for the children they had been the cause of bringing into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nHe hated and despised them because they calmly saw their children\r\ncondemned to hard labour and poverty for life, and deliberately refused\r\nto make any effort to secure for them better conditions than those they\r\nhad themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was because they were indifferent to the fate of THEIR children that\r\nhe would be unable to secure a natural and human life for HIS. It was\r\ntheir apathy or active opposition that made it impossible to establish\r\na better system of society under which those who did their fair share\r\nof the world\'s work would be honoured and rewarded. Instead of helping\r\nto do this, they abased themselves, and grovelled before their\r\noppressors, and compelled and taught their children to do the same.\r\nTHEY were the people who were really responsible for the continuance of\r\nthe present system.\r\n\r\nOwen laughed bitterly to himself.  What a very comical system it was.\r\n\r\nThose who worked were looked upon with contempt, and subjected to every\r\npossible indignity.  Nearly everything they produced was taken away\r\nfrom them and enjoyed by the people who did nothing.  And then the\r\nworkers bowed down and grovelled before those who had robbed them of\r\nthe fruits of their labour and were childishly grateful to them for\r\nleaving anything at all.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the rich despised them and looked upon them as dirt.  They\r\nWERE despicable.  They WERE dirt.  They admitted it and gloried in it.\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts were seething in Owen\'s mind, his fellow workmen\r\nwere still patiently toiling on downstairs.  Most of them had by this\r\ntime dismissed Hunter from their thoughts.  They did not take things so\r\nseriously as Owen.  They flattered themselves that they had more sense\r\nthan that.  It could not be altered.  Grin and bear it.  After all, it\r\nwas only for life!  Make the best of things, and get your own back\r\nwhenever you get a chance.\r\n\r\nPresently Harlow began to sing.  He had a good voice and it was a good\r\nsong, but his mates just then did not appreciate either one of the\r\nother.  His singing was the signal for an outburst of exclamations and\r\ncatcalls.\r\n\r\n\'Shut it, for Christ\'s sake!\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s enough of that bloody row!\'\r\n\r\nAnd so on.  Harlow stopped.\r\n\r\n\'How\'s the enemy?\' asked Easton presently, addressing no one in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t know,\' replied Bundy.  \'It must be about half past four.  Ask\r\nSlyme; he\'s got a watch.\'\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter past four.\r\n\r\n\'It gets dark very early now,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Bundy.  \'It\'s been very dull all day.  I think it\'s\r\ngoin\' to rain.   Listen to the wind.\'\r\n\r\n\'I \'ope not,\' replied Easton.  \'That means a wet shirt goin\' \'ome.\'\r\n\r\nHe called out to old Jack Linden, who was still working at the front\r\ndoors:\r\n\r\n\'Is it raining, Jack?\'\r\n\r\nOld Jack, his pipe still in his mouth, turned to look at the weather.\r\nIt was raining, but Linden did not see the large drops which splashed\r\nheavily upon the ground.  He saw only Hunter, who was standing at the\r\ngate, watching him.  For a few seconds the two men looked at each other\r\nin silence.  Linden was paralysed with fear.  Recovering himself, he\r\nhastily removed his pipe, but it was too late.\r\n\r\nMisery strode up.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t pay you for smoking,\' he said, loudly.  \'Make out your time\r\nsheet, take it to the office and get your money.  I\'ve had enough of\r\nyou!\'\r\n\r\nJack made no attempt to defend himself: he knew it was of no use.  He\r\nsilently put aside the things he had been using, went into the room\r\nwhere he had left his tool-bag and coat, removed his apron and white\r\njacket, folded them up and put them into his tool-bag along with the\r\ntools he had been using--a chisel-knife and a shavehook--put on his\r\ncoat, and, with the tool-bag slung over his shoulder, went away from\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nWithout speaking to anyone else, Hunter then hastily walked over the\r\nplace, noting what progress had been made by each man during his\r\nabsence.  He then rode away, as he wanted to get to the office in time\r\nto give Linden his money.\r\n\r\nIt was now very cold and dark within the house, and as the gas was not\r\nyet laid on, Crass distributed a number of candles to the men, who\r\nworked silently, each occupied with his own gloomy thoughts.  Who would\r\nbe the next?\r\n\r\nOutside, sombre masses of lead-coloured clouds gathered ominously in\r\nthe tempestuous sky.  The gale roared loudly round the old-fashioned\r\nhouse and the windows rattled discordantly.  Rain fell in torrents.\r\n\r\nThey said it meant getting wet through going home, but all the same,\r\nThank God it was nearly five o\'clock!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nThe Financiers\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night as Easton walked home through the rain he felt very\r\ndepressed.  It had been a very bad summer for most people and he had\r\nnot fared better than the rest.  A few weeks with one firm, a few days\r\nwith another, then out of a job, then on again for a month perhaps, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nWilliam Easton was a man of medium height, about twenty-three years\r\nold, with fair hair and moustache and blue eyes.  He wore a stand-up\r\ncollar with a coloured tie and his clothes, though shabby, were clean\r\nand neat.\r\n\r\nHe was married: his wife was a young woman whose acquaintance he had\r\nmade when he happened to be employed with others painting the outside\r\nof the house where she was a general servant.  They had \'walked out\'\r\nfor about fifteen months.  Easton had been in no hurry to marry, for he\r\nknew that, taking good times with bad, his wages did no average a pound\r\na week.  At the end of that time, however, he found that he could not\r\nhonourably delay longer, so they were married.\r\n\r\nThat was twelve months ago.\r\n\r\nAs a single man he had never troubled much if he happened to be out of\r\nwork; he always had enough to live on and pocket money besides; but now\r\nthat he was married it was different; the fear of being \'out\' haunted\r\nhim all the time.\r\n\r\nHe had started for Rushton & Co. on the previous Monday after having\r\nbeen idle for three weeks, and as the house where he was working had to\r\nbe done right through he had congratulated himself on having secured a\r\njob that would last till Christmas; but he now began to fear that what\r\nhad befallen Jack Linden might also happen to himself at any time.  He\r\nwould have to be very careful not to offend Crass in any way.  He was\r\nafraid the latter did not like him very much as it was. Easton knew\r\nthat Crass could get him the sack at any time, and would not scruple to\r\ndo so if he wanted to make room for some crony of his own.  Crass was\r\nthe \'coddy\' or foreman of the job.  Considered as a workman he had no\r\nvery unusual abilities; he was if anything inferior to the majority of\r\nhis fellow workmen.  But although he had but little real ability he\r\npretended to know everything, and the vague references he was in the\r\nhabit of making to \'tones\', and \'shades\', and \'harmony\', had so\r\nimpressed Hunter that the latter had a high opinion of him as a\r\nworkman.  It was by pushing himself forward in this way and by\r\njudicious toadying to Hunter that Crass managed to get himself put in\r\ncharge of work.\r\n\r\nAlthough Crass did as little work as possible himself he took care that\r\nthe others worked hard.  Any man who failed to satisfy him in this\r\nrespect he reported to Hunter as being \'no good\', or \'too slow for a\r\nfuneral\'.  The result was that this man was dispensed with at the end\r\nof the week.  The men knew this, and most of them feared the wily Crass\r\naccordingly, though there were a few whose known abilities placed them\r\nto a certain extent above the reach of his malice.  Frank Owen was one\r\nof these.\r\n\r\nThere were others who by the judicious administration of pipefuls of\r\ntobacco and pints of beer, managed to keep in Crass\'s good graces and\r\noften retained their employment when better workmen were \'stood off\'.\r\n\r\nAs he walked home through the rain thinking of these things, Easton\r\nrealized that it was not possible to foresee what a day or even an hour\r\nmight bring forth.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had arrived at his home; it was a small house, one of a\r\nlong row of similar ones, and it contained altogether four rooms.\r\n\r\nThe front door opened into a passage about two feet six inches wide and\r\nten feet in length, covered with oilcloth.  At the end of the passage\r\nwas a flight of stairs leading to the upper part of the house. The\r\nfirst door on the left led into the front sitting-room, an apartment\r\nabout nine feet square, with a bay window.  This room was very rarely\r\nused and was always very tidy and clean.  The mantelpiece was of wood\r\npainted black and ornamented with jagged streaks of red and yellow,\r\nwhich were supposed to give it the appearance of marble. On the walls\r\nwas a paper with a pale terra-cotta ground and a pattern consisting of\r\nlarge white roses with chocolate coloured leaves and stalks.\r\n\r\nThere was a small iron fender with fire-irons to match, and on the\r\nmantelshelf stood a clock in a polished wood case, a pair of blue glass\r\nvases, and some photographs in frames.  The floor was covered with\r\noilcloth of a tile pattern in yellow and red.  On the walls were two or\r\nthree framed coloured prints such as are presented with Christmas\r\nnumbers of illustrated papers.  There was also a photograph of a group\r\nof Sunday School girls with their teachers with the church for the\r\nbackground.  In the centre of the room was a round deal table about\r\nthree feet six inches across, with the legs stained red to look like\r\nmahogany.  Against one wall was an old couch covered with faded\r\ncretonne, four chairs to match standing backs to wall in different\r\nparts of the room.  The table was covered with a red cloth with a\r\nyellow crewel work design in the centre and in each of the four\r\ncorners, the edges being overcast in the same material.  On the table\r\nwere a lamp and a number of brightly bound books.\r\n\r\nSome of these things, as the couch and the chairs, Easton had bought\r\nsecond-hand and had done up himself.  The table, oilcloth, fender,\r\nhearthrug, etc, had been obtained on the hire system and were not yet\r\npaid for.  The windows were draped with white lace curtains and in the\r\nbay was a small bamboo table on which reposed a large Holy Bible,\r\ncheaply but showily bound.\r\n\r\nIf anyone had ever opened this book they would have found that its\r\npages were as clean as the other things in the room, and on the flyleaf\r\nmight have been read the following inscription: \'To dear Ruth, from her\r\nloving friend Mrs Starvem with the prayer that God\'s word may be her\r\nguide and that Jesus may be her very own Saviour.  Oct. 12. 19--\'\r\n\r\nMrs Starvem was Ruth\'s former mistress, and this had been her parting\r\ngift when Ruth left to get married.  It was supposed to be a keepsake,\r\nbut as Ruth never opened the book and never willingly allowed her\r\nthoughts to dwell upon the scenes of which it reminded her, she had\r\nforgotten the existence of Mrs Starvem almost as completely as that\r\nwell-to-do and pious lady had forgotten hers.\r\n\r\nFor Ruth, the memory of the time she spent in the house of \'her loving\r\nfriend\' was the reverse of pleasant.  It comprised a series of\r\nrecollections of petty tyrannies, insults and indignities.  Six years\r\nof cruelly excessive work, beginning every morning two or three hours\r\nbefore the rest of the household were awake and ceasing only when she\r\nwent exhausted to bed, late at night.\r\n\r\nShe had been what is called a \'slavey\' but if she had been really a\r\nslave her owner would have had some regard for her health and welfare:\r\nher \'loving friend\' had had none.  Mrs Starvem\'s only thought had been\r\nto get out of Ruth the greatest possible amount of labour and to give\r\nher as little as possible in return.\r\n\r\nWhen Ruth looked back upon that dreadful time she saw it, as one might\r\nsay, surrounded by a halo of religion.  She never passed by a chapel or\r\nheard the name of God, or the singing of a hymn, without thinking of\r\nher former mistress.  To have looked into this Bible would have\r\nreminded her of Mrs Starvem; that was one of the reasons why the book\r\nreposed, unopened and unread, a mere ornament on the table in the bay\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nThe second door in the passage near the foot of the stairs led into the\r\nkitchen or living-room: from here another door led into the scullery.\r\nUpstairs were two bedrooms.\r\n\r\nAs Easton entered the house, his wife met him in the passage and asked\r\nhim not to make a noise as the child had just gone to sleep.  They\r\nkissed each other and she helped him to remove his wet overcoat.  Then\r\nthey both went softly into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThis room was about the same size as the sitting-room.  At one end was\r\na small range with an oven and a boiler, and a high mantelpiece painted\r\nblack.  On the mantelshelf was a small round alarm clock and some\r\nbrightly polished tin canisters.  At the other end of the room, facing\r\nthe fireplace, was a small dresser on the shelves of which were neatly\r\narranged a number of plates and dishes.  The walls were papered with\r\noak paper.  On one wall, between two coloured almanacks, hung a tin\r\nlamp with a reflector behind the light.  In the middle of the room was\r\nan oblong deal table with a white tablecloth upon which the tea things\r\nwere set ready.  There were four kitchen chairs, two of which were\r\nplaced close to the table.  Overhead, across the room, about eighteen\r\ninches down from the ceiling, were stretched several cords upon which\r\nwere drying a number of linen or calico undergarments, a coloured\r\nshirt, and Easton\'s white apron and jacket.  On the back of a chair at\r\none side of the fire more clothes were drying.  At the other side on\r\nthe floor was a wicker cradle in which a baby was sleeping. Nearby\r\nstood a chair with a towel hung on the back, arranged so as to shade\r\nthe infant\'s face from the light of the lamp.  An air of homely comfort\r\npervaded the room; the atmosphere was warm, and the fire blazed\r\ncheerfully over the whitened hearth.\r\n\r\nThey walked softly over and stood by the cradle side looking at the\r\nchild; as they looked the baby kept moving uneasily in its sleep.  Its\r\nface was very flushed and its eyes were moving under the half-closed\r\nlids.  Every now and again its lips were drawn back slightly, showing\r\npart of the gums; presently it began to whimper, drawing up its knees\r\nas if in pain.\r\n\r\n\'He seems to have something wrong with him,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'I think it\'s his teeth,\' replied the mother.  \'He\'s been very restless\r\nall day and he was awake nearly all last night.\'\r\n\r\n\'P\'r\'aps he\'s hungry.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, it can\'t be that.  He had the best part of an egg this morning and\r\nI\'ve nursed him several times today.  And then at dinner-time he had a\r\nwhole saucer full of fried potatoes with little bits of bacon in it.\'\r\n\r\nAgain the infant whimpered and twisted in its sleep, its lips drawn\r\nback showing the gums: its knees pressed closely to its body, the\r\nlittle fists clenched, and face flushed.  Then after a few seconds it\r\nbecame placid: the mouth resumed its usual shape; the limbs relaxed and\r\nthe child slumbered peacefully.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you think he\'s getting thin?\' asked Easton.  \'It may be fancy,\r\nbut he don\'t seem to me to be as big now as he was three months ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, he\'s not quite so fat,\' admitted Ruth.  \'It\'s his teeth what\'s\r\nwearing him out; he don\'t hardly get no rest at all with them.\'\r\n\r\nThey continued looking at him a little longer.  Ruth thought he was a\r\nvery beautiful child: he would be eight months old on Sunday.  They\r\nwere sorry they could do nothing to ease his pain, but consoled\r\nthemselves with the reflection that he would be all right once those\r\nteeth were through.\r\n\r\n\'Well, let\'s have some tea,\' said Easton at last.\r\n\r\nWhilst he removed his wet boots and socks and placed them in front of\r\nthe fire to dry and put on dry socks and a pair of slippers in their\r\nstead, Ruth half filled a tin basin with hot water from the boiler and\r\ngave it to him, and he then went to the scullery, added some cold water\r\nand began to wash the paint off his hands.  This done he returned to\r\nthe kitchen and sat down at the table.\r\n\r\n\'I couldn\'t think what to give you to eat tonight,\' said Ruth as she\r\npoured out the tea.  \'I hadn\'t got no money left and there wasn\'t\r\nnothing in the house except bread and butter and that piece of cheese,\r\nso I cut some bread and butter and put some thin slices of cheese on it\r\nand toasted it on a place in front of the fire.  I hope you\'ll like it:\r\nit was the best I could do.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s all right: it smells very nice anyway, and I\'m very hungry.\'\r\n\r\nAs they were taking their tea Easton told his wife about Linden\'s\r\naffair and his apprehensions as to what might befall himself.  They\r\nwere both very indignant, and sorry for poor old Linden, but their\r\nsympathy for him was soon forgotten in their fears for their own\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\nThey remained at the table in silence for some time: then,\r\n\r\n\'How much rent do we owe now?\' asked Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Four weeks, and I promised the collector the last time he called that\r\nwe\'d pay two weeks next Monday.  He was quite nasty about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I suppose you\'ll have to pay it, that\'s all,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'How much money will you have tomorrow?\' asked Ruth.\r\n\r\nHe began to reckon up his time: he started on Monday and today was\r\nFriday: five days, from seven to five, less half an hour for breakfast\r\nand an hour for dinner, eight and a half hours a day--forty-two hours\r\nand a half.  At sevenpence an hour that came to one pound four and\r\nninepence halfpenny.\r\n\r\n\'You know I only started on Monday,\' he said, \'so there\'s no back day\r\nto come.  Tomorrow goes into next week.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know,\' replied Ruth.\r\n\r\n\'If we pay the two week\'s rent that\'ll leave us twelve shillings to\r\nlive on.\'\r\n\r\n\'But we won\'t be able to keep all of that,\' said Ruth, \'because there\'s\r\nother things to pay.\'\r\n\r\n\'What other things?\'\r\n\r\n\'We owe the baker eight shillings for the bread he let us have while\r\nyou were not working, and there\'s about twelve shillings owing for\r\ngroceries.  We\'ll have to pay them something on account.  Then we want\r\nsome more coal; there\'s only about a shovelful left, and--\'\r\n\r\n\'Wait a minnit,\' said Easton.  \'The best way is to write out a list of\r\neverything we owe; then we shall know exactly where we are.  You get me\r\na piece of paper and tell me what to write.  Then we\'ll see what it all\r\ncomes to.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean everything we owe, or everything we must pay tomorrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think we\'d better make a list of all we owe first.\'\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking the baby was sleeping restlessly, occasionally\r\nuttering plaintive little cries.  The mother now went and knelt at the\r\nside of the cradle, which she gently rocked with one hand, patting the\r\ninfant with the other.\r\n\r\n\'Except the furniture people, the biggest thing we owe is the rent,\'\r\nshe said when Easton was ready to begin.\r\n\r\n\'It seems to me,\' said he, as, after having cleared a space on the\r\ntable and arranged the paper, he began to sharpen his pencil with a\r\ntable-knife, \'that you don\'t manage things as well as you might.  If\r\nyou was to make a list of just the things you MUST have before you went\r\nout of a Saturday, you\'d find the money would go much farther. Instead\r\nof doing that you just take the money in your hand without knowing\r\nexactly what you\'re going to do with it, and when you come back it\'s\r\nall gone and next to nothing to show for it.\'\r\n\r\nHis wife made no reply: her head was bent over the child.\r\n\r\n\'Now, let\'s see,\' went on her husband.  \'First of all there\'s the rent.\r\nHow much did you say we owe?\'\r\n\r\n\'Four weeks.  That\'s the three weeks you were out and this week.\'\r\n\r\n\'Four sixes is twenty-four; that\'s one pound four,\' said Easton as he\r\nwrote it down.  \'Next?\'\r\n\r\n\'Grocer, twelve shillings.\'\r\n\r\nEaston looked up in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\'Twelve shillings.  Why, didn\'t you tell me only the other day that\r\nyou\'d paid up all we owed for groceries?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you remember we owed thirty-five shillings last spring?  Well,\r\nI\'ve been paying that bit by bit all the summer.  I paid the last of it\r\nthe week you finished your last job.  Then you were out three weeks--up\r\ntill last Friday--and as we had nothing in hand I had to get what we\r\nwanted without paying for it.\'\r\n\r\n\'But do you mean to say it cost us three shillings a week for tea and\r\nsugar and butter?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not only them.  There\'s been bacon and eggs and cheese and other\r\nthings.\'\r\n\r\nThe man was beginning to become impatient.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' he said, \'What else?\'\r\n\r\n\'We owe the baker eight shillings.  We did owe nearly a pound, but I\'ve\r\nbeen paying it off a little at a time.\'\r\n\r\nThis was added to the list.\r\n\r\n\'Then there\'s the milkman.  I\'ve not paid him for four weeks.  He\r\nhasn\'t sent a bill yet, but you can reckon it up; we have two penn\'orth\r\nevery day.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s four and eight,\' said Easton, writing it down.  \'Anything else?\'\r\n\r\n\'One and seven to the greengrocer for potatoes, cabbage, and paraffin\r\noil.\'\r\n\r\n\'Anything else?\'\r\n\r\n\'We owe the butcher two and sevenpence.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, we haven\'t had any meat for a long time,\' said Easton.  \'When was\r\nit?\'\r\n\r\n\'Three weeks ago; don\'t you remember?  A small leg of mutton,\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes,\' and he added the item.\r\n\r\n\'Then there\'s the instalments for the furniture and oilcloth--twelve\r\nshillings.   A letter came from them today.  And there\'s something\r\nelse.\'\r\n\r\nShe took three letters from the pocket of her dress and handed them to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\'They all came today.  I didn\'t show them to you before as I didn\'t\r\nwant to upset you before you had your tea.\'\r\n\r\nEaston drew the first letter from its envelope.\r\n\r\n                        CORPORATION OF MUGSBOROUGH\r\n                    General District and Special Rates\r\n                               FINAL NOTICE\r\n\r\n  MR W.

It was also a Final Notice and was worded in\r\nalmost exactly the same way as the other, the principal difference\r\nbeing that it was \'By order of the Overseers\' instead of \'the Council\'.\r\nIt demanded the sum of \xa31 1s 5-1/2d for Poor Rate within fourteen days,\r\nand threatened legal proceedings in default.\r\n\r\nEaston laid this down and began to read the third letter--\r\n\r\n                           J. DIDLUM & CO LTD.\r\n                        Complete House Furnishers\r\n                       QUALITY STREET, MUGSBOROUGH\r\n\r\n  MR W. EASTON,\r\n\r\n  SIR:\r\n  We have to remind you that three monthly payments of four shillings\r\n  each (12/- in all) became due on the first of this month, and we\r\n  must request you to let us have this amount BY RETURN OF POST.\r\n\r\n  Under the terms of your agreement you guaranteed that the money\r\n  should be paid on the Saturday of every fourth week.  To prevent\r\n  unpleasantness, we must request you for the future to forward the\r\n  full amount punctually upon that day.\r\n\r\n                                              Yours truly,\r\n                                           J. DIDLUM & CO. LTD\r\n\r\nHe read these communications several times in silence and finally with\r\nan oath threw them down on the table.\r\n\r\n\'How much do we still owe for the oilcloth and the furniture?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know exactly.  It was seven pound odd, and we\'ve had the\r\nthings about six months.  We paid one pound down and three or four\r\ninstalments.  I\'ll get the card if you like.\'\r\n\r\n\'No; never mind.  Say we\'ve paid one pound twelve; so we still owe\r\nabout six pound.\'\r\n\r\nHe added this amount to the list.\r\n\r\n\'I think it\'s a great pity we ever had the things at all,\' he said,\r\npeevishly.  \'It would have been better to have gone without until we\r\ncould pay cash for them: but you would have your way, of course.  Now\r\nwe\'ll have this bloody debt dragging on us for years, and before the\r\ndam stuff is paid for it\'ll be worn out.\'\r\n\r\nThe woman did not reply at once.  She was bending down over the cradle\r\narranging the coverings which the restless movements of the child had\r\ndisordered.  She was crying silently, unnoticed by her husband.\r\n\r\nFor months past--in fact ever since the child was born--she had been\r\nexisting without sufficient food.  If Easton was unemployed they had to\r\nstint themselves so as to avoid getting further into debt than was\r\nabsolutely necessary.  When he was working they had to go short in\r\norder to pay what they owed; but of what there was Easton himself,\r\nwithout knowing it, always had the greater share.  If he was at work\r\nshe would pack into his dinner basket overnight the best there was in\r\nthe house.  When he was out of work she often pretended, as she gave\r\nhim his meals, that she had had hers while he was out.  And all the\r\ntime the baby was draining her life away and her work was never done.\r\n\r\nShe felt very weak and weary as she crouched there, crying furtively\r\nand trying not to let him see.\r\n\r\nAt last she said, without looking round:\r\n\r\n\'You know quite well that you were just as much in favour of getting\r\nthem as I was.  If we hadn\'t got the oilcloth there would have been\r\nillness in the house because of the way the wind used to come up\r\nbetween the floorboards.  Even now of a windy day the oilcloth moves up\r\nand down.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m sure I don\'t know,\' said Easton, as he looked alternatively\r\nat the list of debts and the three letters.  \'I give you nearly every\r\nfarthing I earn and I never interfere about anything, because I think\r\nit\'s your part to attend to the house, but it seems to me you don\'t\r\nmanage things properly.\'\r\n\r\nThe woman suddenly burst into a passion of weeping, laying her head on\r\nthe seat of the chair that was standing near the cradle.\r\n\r\nEaston started up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'s the matter?\' he said.\r\n\r\nThen as he looked down upon the quivering form of the sobbing woman, he\r\nwas ashamed.  He knelt down by her, embracing her and apologizing,\r\nprotesting that he had not meant to hurt her like that.\r\n\r\n\'I always do the best I can with the money,\' Ruth sobbed.  \'I never\r\nspend a farthing on myself, but you don\'t seem to understand how hard\r\nit is.  I don\'t care nothing about having to go without things myself,\r\nbut I can\'t bear it when you speak to me like you do lately.  You seem\r\nto blame me for everything.  You usen\'t to speak to me like that before\r\nI--before--Oh, I am so tired--I am so tired, I wish I could lie down\r\nsomewhere and sleep and never wake up any more.\'\r\n\r\nShe turned away from him, half kneeling, half sitting on the floor, her\r\narms folded on the seat of the chair, and her head resting upon them.\r\nShe was crying in a heartbroken helpless way.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sorry I spoke to you like that,\' said Easton, awkwardly.  \'I\r\ndidn\'t mean what I said.  It\'s all my fault.  I leave things too much\r\nto you, and it\'s more than you can be expected to manage.  I\'ll help\r\nyou to think things out in future; only forgive me, I\'m very sorry.  I\r\nknow you try your best.\'\r\n\r\nShe suffered him to draw her to him, laying her head on his shoulder as\r\nhe kissed and fondled her, protesting that he would rather be poor and\r\nhungry with her than share riches with anyone else.\r\n\r\nThe child in the cradle--who had been twisting and turning restlessly\r\nall this time--now began to cry loudly.  The mother took it from the\r\ncradle and began to hush and soothe it, walking about the room and\r\nrocking it in her arms.  The child, however, continued to scream, so\r\nshe sat down to nurse it: for a little while the infant refused to\r\ndrink, struggling and kicking in its mother\'s arms, then for a few\r\nminutes it was quite, taking the milk in a half-hearted, fretful way.\r\nThen it began to scream and twist and struggle.\r\n\r\nThey both looked at it in a helpless manner.  Whatever could be the\r\nmatter with it?  It must be those teeth.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly as they were soothing and patting him, the child vomited\r\nall over its own and its mother\'s clothing a mass of undigested food.\r\nMingled with the curdled milk were fragments of egg, little bits of\r\nbacon, bread and particles of potato.\r\n\r\nHaving rid his stomach of this unnatural burden, the unfortunate baby\r\nbegan to cry afresh, his face very pale, his lips colourless, and his\r\neyes red-rimmed and running with water.\r\n\r\nEaston walked about with him while Ruth cleaned up the mess and got\r\nready some fresh clothing.  They both agreed that it was the coming\r\nteeth that had upset the poor child\'s digestion.  It would be a good\r\njob when they were through.\r\n\r\nThis work finished, Easton, who was still convinced in his own mind\r\nthat with the aid of a little common sense and judicious management\r\ntheir affairs might be arranged more satisfactorily, said:\r\n\r\n\'We may as well make a list of all the things we must pay and buy\r\ntomorrow.  The great thing is to think out exactly what you are going\r\nto do before you spend anything; that saves you from getting things you\r\ndon\'t really need and prevents you forgetting the things you MUST have.\r\nNow, first of all, the rent; two weeks, twelve shillings.\'\r\n\r\nHe took a fresh piece of paper and wrote this item down.\r\n\r\n\'What else is there that we must pay or buy tomorrow?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you know I promised the baker and the grocer that I would begin\r\nto pay them directly you got a job, and if I don\'t keep my word they\r\nwon\'t let us have anything another time, so you\'d better put down two\r\nshillings each for them.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve got that,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Two and seven for the butcher.  We must pay that.  I\'m ashamed to pass\r\nthe shop, because when I got the meat I promised to pay him the next\r\nweek, and it\'s nearly three weeks ago now.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve put that down.  What else?\'\r\n\r\n\'A hundred of coal: one and six.\'\r\n\r\n\'Next?\'\r\n\r\n\'The instalment for the furniture and floor-cloth, twelve shillings.\'\r\n\r\n\'Next?\'\r\n\r\n\'We owe the milkman four weeks; we\'d better pay one week on account;\r\nthat\'s one and two.\'\r\n\r\n\'Next?\'\r\n\r\n\'The greengrocer; one shilling on account.\'\r\n\r\n\'Anything else?\'\r\n\r\n\'We shall want a piece of meat of some kind; we\'ve had none for nearly\r\nthree weeks.  You\'d better say one and six for that.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s down.\'\r\n\r\n\'One and nine for bread; that\'s one loaf a day.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I\'ve got two shillings down for bread already,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know, dear, but that\'s to go towards paying off what we owe,\r\nand what you have down for the grocer and milkman\'s the same.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, go on, for Christ\'s sake, and let\'s get it down,\' said Easton,\r\nirritably.\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t say less than three shillings for groceries.\'\r\n\r\nEaston looked carefully at his list.  This time he felt sure that the\r\nitem was already down; but finding he was mistaken he said nothing and\r\nadded the amount.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ve got that.  What else?\'\r\n\r\n\'Milk, one and two.\'\r\n\r\n\'Next?\'\r\n\r\n\'Vegetables, eightpence.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Paraffin oil and firewood, sixpence.\'\r\n\r\nAgain the financier scrutinized the list.  He was positive that it was\r\ndown already.  However, he could not find it, so the sixpence was added\r\nto the column of figures.\r\n\r\n\'Then there\'s your boots; you can\'t go about with them old things in\r\nthis weather much longer, and they won\'t stand mending again.  You\r\nremember the old man said they were not worth it when you had that\r\npatch put on a few weeks ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I was thinking of buying a new pair tomorrow.  My socks was wet\r\nthrough tonight.  If it\'s raining some morning when I\'m going out and I\r\nhave to work all day with wet feet I shall be laid up.\'\r\n\r\n\'At that second-hand shop down in High Street I saw when I was out this\r\nafternoon a very good pair just your size, for two shillings.\'\r\n\r\nEaston did not reply at once.  He did not much fancy wearing the\r\ncast-off boots of some stranger, who for all he knew might have\r\nsuffered from some disease, but then remembering that his old ones were\r\nliterally falling off his feet he realized that he had practically no\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\'If you\'re quite sure they\'ll fit you\'d better get them.  It\'s better\r\nto do that than for me to catch cold and be laid up for God knows how\r\nlong.\'\r\n\r\nSo the two shillings were added to the list.\r\n\r\n\'Is there anything else?\'\r\n\r\n\'How much does it all come to now?\' asked Ruth.\r\n\r\nEaston added it all up.  When he had finished he remained staring at\r\nthe figures in consternation for a long time without speaking.\r\n\r\n\'Jesus Christ!\' he ejaculated at last.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s it come to?\' asked Ruth.\r\n\r\n\'Forty-four and tenpence.\'\r\n\r\n\'I knew we wouldn\'t have enough,\' said Ruth, wearily.  \'Now if you\r\nthink I manage so badly, p\'raps you can tell me which of these things\r\nwe ought to leave out.\'\r\n\r\n\'We\'d be all right if it wasn\'t for the debts,\' said Easton, doggedly.\r\n\r\n\'When you\'re not working, we must either get into debt or starve.\'\r\n\r\nEaston made no answer.\r\n\r\n\'What\'ll we do about the rates?\' asked Ruth.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I don\'t know: there\'s nothing left to pawn except my black\r\ncoat and vest.  You might get something on that.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'ll have to be paid somehow,\' said Ruth, \'or you\'ll be taken off to\r\njail for a month, the same as Mrs Newman\'s husband was last winter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you\'d better take the coat and vest and see what you can get on\r\n\'em tomorrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Ruth; \'and there\'s that brown silk dress of mine--you know,\r\nthe one I wore when we was married--I might get something on that,\r\nbecause we won\'t get enough on the coat and vest.  I don\'t like parting\r\nwith the dress, although I never wear it; but we\'ll be sure to be able\r\nto get it out again, won\'t we?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\nThey remained silent for some time, Easton staring at the list of debts\r\nand the letters.  She was wondering if he still thought she managed\r\nbadly, and what he would do about it.  She knew she had always done her\r\nbest.  At last she said, wistfully, trying to speak plainly for there\r\nseemed to be a lump in her throat: \'And what about tomorrow? Would you\r\nlike to spend the money yourself, or shall I manage as I\'ve done\r\nbefore, or will you tell me what to do?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know, dear,\' said Easton, sheepishly.  \'I think you\'d better\r\ndo as you think best.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'ll manage all right, dear, you\'ll see,\' replied Ruth, who seemed\r\nto think it a sort of honour to be allowed to starve herself and wear\r\nshabby clothes.\r\n\r\nThe baby, who had been for some time quietly sitting upon his mother\'s\r\nlap, looking wonderingly at the fire--his teeth appeared to trouble him\r\nless since he got rid of the eggs and bacon and potatoes--now began to\r\nnod and doze, which Easton perceiving, suggested that the infant should\r\nnot be allowed to go to sleep with an empty stomach, because it would\r\nprobably wake up hungry in the middle of the night. He therefore woke\r\nhim up as much as possible and mashed a little of the bread and toasted\r\ncheese with a little warm milk.  Then taking the baby from Ruth he\r\nbegan to try to induce it to eat.  As soon, however, as the child\r\nunderstood his object, it began to scream at the top of its voice,\r\nclosing its lips firmly and turning its head rapidly from side to side\r\nevery time the spoon approached its mouth.  It made such a dreadful\r\nnoise that Easton at last gave in.  He began to walk about the room\r\nwith it, and presently the child sobbed itself to sleep. After putting\r\nthe baby into its cradle Ruth set about preparing Easton\'s breakfast\r\nand packing it into his basket.  This did not take very long, there\r\nbeing only bread and butter--or, to be more correct, margarine.\r\n\r\nThen she poured what tea was left in the tea-pot into a small saucepan\r\nand placed it on the top of the oven, but away from the fire, cut two\r\nmore slices of bread and spread on them all the margarine that was\r\nleft; then put them on a plate on the table, covering them with a\r\nsaucer to prevent them getting hard and dry during the night.  Near the\r\nplate she placed a clean cup and saucer and the milk and sugar.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Easton would light the fire and warm up the tea in the\r\nsaucepan so as to have a cup of tea before going out.  If Ruth was\r\nawake and he was not pressed for time, he generally took a cup of tea\r\nto her in bed.\r\n\r\nNothing now remained to be done but to put some coal and wood ready in\r\nthe fender so that there would be no unnecessary delay in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe baby was still sleeping and Ruth did not like to wake him up yet to\r\ndress him for the night.  Easton was sitting by the fire smoking, so\r\neverything being done, Ruth sat down at the table and began sewing.\r\nPresently she spoke:\r\n\r\n\'I wish you\'d let me try to let that back room upstairs: the woman next\r\ndoor has got hers let unfurnished to an elderly woman and her husband\r\nfor two shillings a week.  If we could get someone like that it would\r\nbe better than having an empty room in the house.\'\r\n\r\n\'And we\'d always have them messing about down here, cooking and washing\r\nand one thing and another,\' objected Easton; \'they\'d be more trouble\r\nthan they way worth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, we might try and furnish it.  There\'s Mrs Crass across the road\r\nhas got two lodgers in one room.  They pay her twelve shillings a week\r\neach; board, lodging and washing.  That\'s one pound four she has coming\r\nin reglar every week.  If we could do the same we\'d very soon be out of\r\ndebt.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the good of talking?  You\'d never be able to do the work even\r\nif we had the furniture.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, the work\'s nothing,\' replied Ruth, \'and as for the furniture,\r\nwe\'ve got plenty of spare bedclothes, and we could easily manage\r\nwithout a washstand in our room for a bit, so the only thing we really\r\nwant is a small bedstead and mattress; we could get them very cheap\r\nsecond-hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'There ought to be a chest of drawers,\' said Easton doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think so,\' replied Ruth.  \'There\'s a cupboard in the room and\r\nwhoever took it would be sure to have a box.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, if you think you can do the work I\'ve no objection,\' said\r\nEaston.  \'It\'ll be a nuisance having a stranger in the way all the\r\ntime, but I suppose we must do something of the sort or else we\'ll have\r\nto give up the house and take a couple of rooms somewhere.  That would\r\nbe worse than having lodgers ourselves.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s go and have a look at the room,\' he added, getting up and taking\r\nthe lamp from the wall.\r\n\r\nThey had to go up two flights of stairs before arriving at the top\r\nlanding, where there were two doors, one leading into the front\r\nroom--their bedroom--and the other into the empty back room.  These two\r\ndoors were at right angles to each other.  The wallpaper in the back\r\nroom was damaged and soiled in several places.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s nearly a whole roll of this paper on the top of the cupboard,\'\r\nsaid Ruth.  \'You could easily mend all those places.  We could hang up a\r\nfew almanacks on the walls; our washstand could go there by the window;\r\na chair just there, and the bed along that wall behind the door.  It\'s\r\nonly a small window, so I could easily manage to make a curtain out of\r\nsomething.  I\'m sure I could make the room look quite nice without\r\nspending hardly anything.\'\r\n\r\nEaston reached down the roll of paper.  It was the same pattern as that\r\non the wall.  The latter was a good deal faded, of course, but it would\r\nnot matter much if the patches showed a little.  They returned to the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think you know anyone who would take it?\' asked Ruth.  Easton\r\nsmoked thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' he said at length.  \'But I\'ll mention it to one or two of the\r\nchaps on the job; they might know of someone.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I\'ll get Mrs Crass to ask her lodgers: p\'raps they might have a\r\nfriend what would like to live near them.\'\r\n\r\nSo it was settled; and as the fire was nearly out and it was getting\r\nlate, they prepared to retire for the night.  The baby was still\r\nsleeping so Easton lifted it, cradle and all, and carried it up the\r\nnarrow staircase into the front bedroom, Ruth leading the way, carrying\r\nthe lamp and some clothes for the child.  So that the infant might be\r\nwithin easy reach of its mother during the night, two chairs were\r\narranged close to her side of the bed and the cradle placed on them.\r\n\r\n\'Now we\'ve forgot the clock,\' said Easton, pausing.  He was half\r\nundressed and had already removed his slippers.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll slip down and get it,\' said Ruth.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, I\'ll go,\' said Easton, beginning to put his slippers on\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\'No, you get into bed.  I\'ve not started undressing yet.  I\'ll get it,\'\r\nreplied Ruth who was already on her way down.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know as it was worth the trouble of going down,\' said Ruth\r\nwhen she returned with the clock.  \'It stopped three or four times\r\ntoday.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I hope it don\'t stop in the night,\' Easton said.  \'It would be a\r\nbit of all right not knowing what time it was in the morning.  I\r\nsuppose the next thing will be that we\'ll have to buy a new clock.\'\r\n\r\nHe woke several times during the night and struck a match to see if it\r\nwas yet time to get up.  At half past two the clock was still going and\r\nhe again fell asleep.  The next time he work up the ticking had ceased.\r\nHe wondered what time it was?  It was still very dark, but that was\r\nnothing to go by, because it was always dark at six now.  He was wide\r\nawake: it must be nearly time to get up.  It would never do to be late;\r\nhe might get the sack.\r\n\r\nHe got up and dressed himself.  Ruth was asleep, so he crept quietly\r\ndownstairs, lit the fire and heated the tea.  When it was ready he went\r\nsoftly upstairs again.  Ruth was still sleeping, so he decided not to\r\ndisturb her.  Returning to the kitchen, he poured out and drank a cup\r\nof tea, put on his boots, overcoat and hat and taking his basket went\r\nout of the house.\r\n\r\nThe rain was still falling and it was very cold and dark.  There was no\r\none else in the street.  Easton shivered as he walked along wondering\r\nwhat time it could be.  He remembered there was a clock over the front\r\nof a jeweller\'s shop a little way down the main road.  When he arrived\r\nat this place he found that the clock being so high up he could not see\r\nthe figures on the face distinctly, because it was still very dark.  He\r\nstood staring for a few minutes vainly trying to see what time it was\r\nwhen suddenly the light of a bull\'s-eye lantern was flashed into his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re about very early,\' said a voice, the owner of which Easton\r\ncould not see.  The light blinded him.\r\n\r\n\'What time is it?\' said Easton.  \'I\'ve got to get to work at seven and\r\nour clock stopped during the night.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where are you working?\'\r\n\r\n\'At "The Cave" in Elmore Road.  You know, near the old toll gate.\'\r\n\r\n\'What are you doing there and who are you working for?\' the policeman\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nEaston explained.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said the constable, \'it\'s very strange that you should be\r\nwandering about at this hour.  It\'s only about three-quarters of an\r\nhour\'s walk from here to Elmore Road.  You say you\'ve got to get there\r\nat seven, and it\'s only a quarter to four now.  Where do you live?\r\nWhat\'s your name?\'  Easton gave his name and address and began\r\nrepeating the story about the clock having stopped.\r\n\r\n\'What you say may be all right or it may not,\' interrupted the\r\npoliceman.  \'I\'m not sure but that I ought to take you to the station.\r\nAll I know about you is that I find you loitering outside this shop.\r\nWhat have you got in that basket?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only my breakfast,\' Easton said, opening the basket and displaying its\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m inclined to believe what you say,\' said the policeman, after a\r\npause.  \'But to make quite sure I\'ll go home with you.  It\'s on my\r\nbeat, and I don\'t want to run you in if you\'re what you say you are,\r\nbut I should advise you to buy a decent clock, or you\'ll be getting\r\nyourself into trouble.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the house Easton opened the door, and after making\r\nsome entries in his note-book the officer went away, much to the relief\r\nof Easton, who went upstairs, set the hands of the clock right and\r\nstarted it going again.  He then removed his overcoat and lay down on\r\nthe bed in his clothes, covering himself with the quilt. After a while\r\nhe fell asleep, and when he awoke the clock was still ticking.\r\n\r\nThe time was exactly seven o\'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nThe Placard\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Owen was the son of a journeyman carpenter who had died of\r\nconsumption when the boy was only five years old.  After that his\r\nmother earned a scanty living as a needle-woman.  When Frank was\r\nthirteen he went to work for a master decorator who was a man of a type\r\nthat has now almost disappeared, being not merely an employer but a\r\ncraftsman of a high order.\r\n\r\nHe was an old man when Frank Owen went to work for him.  At one time he\r\nhad had a good business in the town, and used to boast that he had\r\nalways done good work, had found pleasure in doing it and had been well\r\npaid for it.  But of late years the number of his customers had\r\ndwindled considerably, for there had arisen a new generation which\r\ncared nothing about craftsmanship or art, and everything for cheapness\r\nand profit.  From this man and by laborious study and practice in his\r\nspare time, aided by a certain measure of natural ability, the boy\r\nacquired a knowledge of decorative painting and design, and graining\r\nand signwriting.\r\n\r\nFrank\'s mother died when he was twenty-four, and a year afterwards he\r\nmarried the daughter of a fellow workman.  In those days trade was\r\nfairly good and although there was not much demand for the more\r\nartistic kinds of work, still the fact that he was capable of doing\r\nthem, if required, made it comparatively easy for him to obtain\r\nemployment.  Owen and his wife were very happy.  They had one child--a\r\nboy--and for some years all went well.  But gradually this state of\r\nthings altered: broadly speaking, the change came slowly and\r\nimperceptibly, although there were occasional sudden fluctuations.\r\n\r\nEven in summer he could not always find work: and in winter it was\r\nalmost impossible to get a job of any sort.  At last, about twelve\r\nmonths before the date that this story opens, he determined to leave\r\nhis wife and child at home and go to try his fortune in London.  When\r\nhe got employment he would send for them.\r\n\r\nIt was a vain hope.  He found London, if anything, worse than his\r\nnative town.  Wherever he went he was confronted with the legend: \'No\r\nhands wanted\'.  He walked the streets day after day; pawned or sold all\r\nhis clothes save those he stood in, and stayed in London for six\r\nmonths, sometimes starving and only occasionally obtaining a few days\r\nor weeks work.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that time he was forced to give in.  The privations he\r\nhad endured, the strain on his mind and the foul atmosphere of the city\r\ncombined to defeat him.  Symptoms of the disease that had killed his\r\nfather began to manifest themselves, and yielding to the repeated\r\nentreaties of his wife he returned to his native town, the shadow of\r\nhis former self.\r\n\r\nThat was six months ago, and since then he had worked for Rushton & Co.\r\nOccasionally when they had no work in hand, he was \'stood off\' until\r\nsomething came in.\r\n\r\nEver since his return from London, Owen had been gradually abandoning\r\nhimself to hopelessness.  Every day he felt that the disease he\r\nsuffered from was obtaining a stronger grip on him.  The doctor told\r\nhim to \'take plenty of nourishing food\', and prescribed costly\r\nmedicines which Owen had not the money to buy.\r\n\r\nThen there was his wife.  Naturally delicate, she needed many things\r\nthat he was unable to procure for her.  And the boy--what hope was\r\nthere for him?  Often as Owen moodily thought of their circumstances\r\nand prospects he told himself that it would be far better if they could\r\nall three die now, together.\r\n\r\nHe was tired of suffering himself, tired of impotently watching the\r\nsufferings of his wife, and appalled at the thought of what was in\r\nstore for the child.\r\n\r\nOf this nature were his reflections as he walked homewards on the\r\nevening of the day when old Linden was dismissed.  There was no reason\r\nto believe or hope that the existing state of things would be altered\r\nfor a long time to come.\r\n\r\nThousands of people like himself dragged out a wretched existence on\r\nthe very verge of starvation, and for the greater number of people life\r\nwas one long struggle against poverty.  Yet practically none of these\r\npeople knew or even troubled themselves to inquire why they were in\r\nthat condition; and for anyone else to try to explain to them was a\r\nridiculous waste of time, for they did not want to know.\r\n\r\nThe remedy was so simple, the evil so great and so glaringly evident\r\nthat the only possible explanation of its continued existence was that\r\nthe majority of his fellow workers were devoid of the power of\r\nreasoning.  If these people were not mentally deficient they would of\r\ntheir own accord have swept this silly system away long ago.  It would\r\nnot have been necessary for anyone to teach them that it was wrong.\r\n\r\nWhy, even those who were successful or wealthy could not be sure that\r\nthey would not eventually die of want.  In every workhouse might be\r\nfound people who had at one time occupied good positions; and their\r\ndownfall was not in every case their own fault.\r\n\r\nNo matter how prosperous a man might be, he could not be certain that\r\nhis children would never want for bread.  There were thousands living\r\nin misery on starvation wages whose parents had been wealthy people.\r\n\r\nAs Owen strode rapidly along, his mind filled with these thoughts, he\r\nwas almost unconscious of the fact that he was wet through to the skin.\r\nHe was without an overcoat, it was pawned in London, and he had not yet\r\nbeen able to redeem it.  His boots were leaky and sodden with mud and\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nHe was nearly home now.  At the corner of the street in which he lived\r\nthere was a newsagent\'s shop and on a board outside the door was\r\ndisplayed a placard:\r\n\r\n                       TERRIBLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY\r\n                       DOUBLE MURDER AND SUICIDE\r\n\r\nHe went in to buy a copy of the paper.  He was a frequent customer\r\nhere, and as he entered the shopkeeper greeted him by name.\r\n\r\n\'Dreadful weather,\' he remarked as he handed Owen the paper.  \'It makes\r\nthings pretty bad in your line, I suppose?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' responded Owen, \'there\'s a lot of men idle, but fortunately I\r\nhappen to be working inside.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re one of the lucky ones, then,\' said the other.  \'You know,\r\nthere\'ll be a job here for some of \'em as soon as the weather gets a\r\nlittle better.  All the outside of this block is going to be done up.\r\nThat\'s a pretty big job, isn\'t it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' returned Owen.  \'Who\'s going to do it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Makehaste and Sloggit.  You know, they\'ve got a place over at Windley.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know the firm,\' said Owen, grimly.  He had worked for them once\r\nor twice himself.\r\n\r\n\'The foreman was in here today,\' the shopkeeper went on.  \'He said\r\nthey\'re going to make a start Monday morning if it\'s fine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I hope it will be,\' said Owen, \'because things are very quiet\r\njust now.\'\r\n\r\nWishing the other \'Good night\', Owen again proceeded homewards.\r\n\r\nHalf-way down the street he paused irresolutely: he was thinking of the\r\nnews he had just heard and of Jack Linden.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became generally known that this work was about to be\r\nstarted there was sure to be a rush for it, and it would be a case of\r\nfirst come, first served.  If he saw Jack tonight the old man might be\r\nin time to secure a job.\r\n\r\nOwen hesitated: he was wet through: it was a long way to Linden\'s\r\nplace, nearly twenty minutes\' walk.  Still, he would like to let him\r\nknow, because unless he was one of the first to apply, Linden would not\r\nstand such a good chance as a younger man.  Owen said to himself that\r\nif he walked very fast there was not much risk of catching cold.\r\nStanding about in wet clothes might be dangerous, but so long as one\r\nkept moving it was all right.\r\n\r\nHe turned back and set off in the direction of Linden\'s house: although\r\nhe was but a few yards from his own home, he decided not to go in\r\nbecause his wife would be sure to try to persuade him not to go out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs he hurried along he presently noticed a small dark object on the\r\ndoorstep of an untenanted house.  He stopped to examine it more closely\r\nand perceived that it was a small black kitten.  The tiny creature came\r\ntowards him and began walking about his feet, looking into his face and\r\ncrying piteously.  He stooped down and stroked it, shuddering as his\r\nhands came in contact with its emaciated body.  Its fur was saturated\r\nwith rain and every joint of its backbone was distinctly perceptible to\r\nthe touch.  As he caressed it, the starving creature mewed pathetically.\r\n\r\nOwen decided to take it home to the boy, and as he picked it up and put\r\nit inside his coat the little outcast began to purr.\r\n\r\nThis incident served to turn his thoughts into another channel.   If,\r\nas so many people pretended to believe, there was an infinitely loving\r\nGod, how was it that this helpless creature that He had made was\r\ncondemned to suffer?  It had never done any harm, and was in no sense\r\nresponsible for the fact that it existed.  Was God unaware of the\r\nmiseries of His creatures?  If so, then He was not all-knowing.  Was\r\nGod aware of their sufferings, but unable to help them?  Then He was\r\nnot all-powerful.  Had He the power but not the will to make His\r\ncreatures happy?  Then He was not good.  No; it was impossible to\r\nbelieve in the existence of an individual, infinite God..  In fact, no\r\none did so believe; and least of all those who pretended for various\r\nreasons to be the disciples and followers of Christ.  The anti-Christs\r\nwho went about singing hymns, making long prayers and crying Lord,\r\nLord, but never doing the things which He said, who were known by their\r\nwords to be unbelievers and infidels, unfaithful to the Master they\r\npretended to serve, their lives being passed in deliberate and\r\nsystematic disregard of His teachings and Commandments.  It was not\r\nnecessary to call in the evidence of science, or to refer to the\r\nsupposed inconsistencies, impossibilities, contradictions and\r\nabsurdities contained in the Bible, in order to prove there was no\r\ntruth in the Christian religion.  All that was necessary was to look at\r\nthe conduct of the individuals who were its votaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nThe Clock-case\r\n\r\n\r\nJack Linden lived in a small cottage in Windley.  He had occupied this\r\nhouse ever since his marriage, over thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nHis home and garden were his hobby: he was always doing something;\r\npainting, whitewashing, papering and so forth.  The result was that\r\nalthough the house itself was not of much account he had managed to get\r\nit into very good order, and as a result it was very clean and\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAnother result of his industry was that--seeing the improved appearance\r\nof the place--the landlord had on two occasions raised the rent.  When\r\nLinden first took the house the rent was six shillings a week.  Five\r\nyears after, it was raised to seven shillings, and after the lapse of\r\nanother five years it had been increased to eight shillings.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty years of his tenancy he had paid altogether nearly\r\nsix hundred pounds in rent, more than double the amount of the present\r\nvalue of the house.  Jack did not complain of this--in fact he was very\r\nwell satisfied.  He often said that Mr Sweater was a very good\r\nlandlord, because on several occasions when, being out of work, he had\r\nbeen a few weeks behind with his rent the agent acting for the\r\nbenevolent Mr Sweater had allowed Linden to pay off the arrears by\r\ninstalments.  As old Jack was in the habit of remarking, many a\r\nlandlord would have sold up their furniture and turned them into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nAs the reader is already aware, Linden\'s household consisted of his\r\nwife, his two grandchildren and his daughter-in-law, the widow and\r\nchildren of his youngest son, a reservist, who died while serving in\r\nthe South African War.  This man had been a plasterer, and just before\r\nthe war he was working for Rushton & Co.\r\n\r\nThey had just finished their tea when Owen knocked at their front door.\r\nThe young woman went to see who was there.\r\n\r\n\'Is Mr Linden in?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  Who is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'My name\'s Owen.\'\r\n\r\nOld Jack, however, had already recognized Owen\'s voice, and came to the\r\ndoor, wondering what he wanted.\r\n\r\n\'As I was going home I heard that Makehaste and Sloggit are going to\r\nstart a large job on Monday, so I thought I\'d run over and let you\r\nknow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are they?\' said Linden.  \'I\'ll go and see them in the morning.  But\r\nI\'m afraid I won\'t stand much chance, because a lot of their regular\r\nhands are waiting for a job; but I\'ll go and see \'em all the same.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you know, it\'s a big job.  All the outside of that block at the\r\ncorner of Kerk Street and Lord Street.  They\'re almost sure to want a\r\nfew extra hands.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, there\'s something in that,\' said Linden.  \'Anyhow, I\'m much\r\nobliged to you for letting me know; but come in out of the rain.  You\r\nmust be wet through.\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I won\'t stay,\' responded Owen.  \'I don\'t want to stand about any\r\nlonger than I can help in these wet clothes.\'\r\n\r\n\'But it won\'t take you a minit to drink a cup of tea,\' Linden insisted.\r\n\'I won\'t ask you to stop longer than that.\'\r\n\r\nOwen entered; the old man closed the door and led the way into the\r\nkitchen.  At one side of the fire, Linden\'s wife, a frail-looking old\r\nlady with white hair, was seated in a large armchair, knitting. Linden\r\nsat down in a similar chair on the other side.  The two grandchildren,\r\na boy and girl about seven and eight years, respectively, were still\r\nseated at the table.\r\n\r\nStanding by the side of the dresser at one end of the room was a\r\ntreadle sewing machine, and on one end of the dresser was a a pile of\r\nsewing: ladies\' blouses in process of making.  This was another\r\ninstance of the goodness of Mr Sweater, from whom Linden\'s\r\ndaughter-in-law obtained the work.  It was not much, because she was\r\nonly able to do it in her spare time, but then, as she often remarked,\r\nevery little helped.\r\n\r\nThe floor was covered with linoleum: there were a number of framed\r\npictures on the walls, and on the high mantelshelf were a number of\r\nbrightly polished tins and copper utensils.  The room had that\r\nindescribably homelike, cosy air that is found only in those houses in\r\nwhich the inhabitants have dwelt for a very long time.\r\n\r\nThe younger woman was already pouring out a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nOld Mrs Linden, who had never seen Owen before, although she had heard\r\nof him, belonged to the Church of England and was intensely religious.\r\nShe looked curiously at the Atheist as he entered the room.  He had\r\ntaken off his hat and she was surprised to find that he was not\r\nrepulsive to look at, rather the contrary.  But then she remembered\r\nthat Satan often appears as an angel of light.  Appearances are\r\ndeceitful.  She wished that John had not asked him into the house and\r\nhoped that no evil consequences would follow.  As she looked at him,\r\nshe was horrified to perceive a small black head with a pair of\r\nglistening green eyes peeping out of the breast of his coat, and\r\nimmediately afterwards the kitten, catching sight of the cups and\r\nsaucers on the table, began to mew frantically and scrambled suddenly\r\nout of its shelter, inflicting a severe scratch on Owen\'s restraining\r\nhands as it jumped to the floor.\r\n\r\nIt clambered up the tablecloth and began rushing all over the table,\r\ndarting madly from one plate to another, seeking something to eat.\r\n\r\nThe children screamed with delight.  Their grandmother was filled with\r\na feeling of superstitious alarm.  Linden and the young woman stood\r\nstaring with astonishment at the unexpected visitor.\r\n\r\nBefore the kitten had time to do any damage, Owen caught hold of it\r\nand, despite its struggles, lifted it off the table.\r\n\r\n\'I found it in the street as I was coming along,\' he said.  \'It seems\r\nto be starving.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor little thing.  I\'ll give it something.\' exclaimed the young woman.\r\n\r\nShe put some milk and bread into a saucer for it and the kitten ate\r\nravenously, almost upsetting the saucer in its eagerness, much to the\r\namusement of the two children, who stood by watching it admiringly.\r\n\r\nTheir mother now handed Owen a cup of tea.  Linden insisted on his\r\nsitting down and then began to talk about Hunter.\r\n\r\n\'You know I HAD to spend some time on them doors to make \'em look\r\nanything at all; but it wasn\'t the time I took, or even the smoking\r\nwhat made \'im go on like that.  He knows very well the time it takes.\r\nThe real reason is that he thinks I was gettin\' too much money.  Work\r\nis done so rough nowadays that chaps like Sawkins is good enough for\r\nmost of it.  Hunter shoved me off just because I was getting the top\r\nmoney, and you\'ll see I won\'t be the only one.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid you\'re right,\' returned Owen.  \'Did you see Rushton when\r\nyou went for your money?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Linden.  \'I hurried up as fast as I could, but Hunter\r\nwas there first.  He passed me on his bike before I got half-way, so I\r\nsuppose he told his tale before I came.  Anyway, when I started to\r\nspeak to Mr Rushton he wouldn\'t listen.  Said he couldn\'t interfere\r\nbetween Mr Hunter and the men.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  They\'re a bad lot, them two,\' said the old woman, shaking her\r\nhead sagely.  \'But it\'ll all come \'ome to \'em, you\'ll see.  They\'ll\r\nnever prosper.  The Lord will punish them.\'\r\n\r\nOwen did not feel very confident of that.  Most of the people he knew\r\nwho had prospered were very similar in character to the two worthies in\r\nquestion.  However, he did not want to argue with this poor old woman.\r\n\r\n\'When Tom was called up to go to the war,\' said the young woman,\r\nbitterly, \'Mr Rushton shook hands with him and promised to give him a\r\njob when he came back.  But now that poor Tom\'s gone and they know that\r\nme and the children\'s got no one to look to but Father, they do THIS.\'\r\n\r\nAlthough at the mention of her dead son\'s name old Mrs Linden was\r\nevidently distressed, she was still mindful of the Atheist\'s presence,\r\nand hastened to rebuke her daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\n\'You shouldn\'t say we\'ve got no one to look to, Mary,\' she said. \'We\'re\r\nnot as them who are without God and without hope in the world. The Lord\r\nis our shepherd.  He careth for the widow and the fatherless.\'\r\n\r\nOwen was very doubtful about this also.  He had seen so many badly\r\ncared-for children about the streets lately, and what he remembered of\r\nhis own sorrowful childhood was all evidence to the contrary.\r\n\r\nAn awkward silence succeeded.  Owen did not wish to continue this\r\nconversation: he was afraid that he might say something that would hurt\r\nthe old woman.  Besides, he was anxious to get away; he began to feel\r\ncold in his wet clothes.\r\n\r\nAs he put his empty cup on the table he said:\r\n\r\n\'Well, I must be going.  They\'ll be thinking I\'m lost, at home.\'\r\n\r\nThe kitten had finished all the bread and milk and was gravely washing\r\nits face with one of its forepaws, to the great admiration of the two\r\nchildren, who were sitting on the floor beside it.  It was an\r\nartful-looking kitten, all black, with a very large head and a very\r\nsmall body.  It reminded Owen of a tadpole.\r\n\r\n\'Do you like cats?\' he asked, addressing the children.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said the boy.  \'Give it to us, will you, mister?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, do leave it \'ere, mister,\' exclaimed the little girl.  \'I\'ll look\r\nafter it.\'\r\n\r\n\'So will I,\' said the boy.\r\n\r\n\'But haven\'t you one of your own?\' asked Owen.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; we\'ve got a big one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, if you have one already and I give you this, then you\'d have two\r\ncats, and I\'d have none.  That wouldn\'t be fair, would it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you can \'ave a lend of our cat for a little while if you give us\r\nthis kitten,\' said the boy, after a moment\'s thought.\r\n\r\n\'Why would you rather have the kitten?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because it would play: our cat don\'t want to play, it\'s too old.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps you\'re too rough with it,\' returned Owen.\r\n\r\n\'No, it ain\'t that; it\'s just because it\'s old.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know cats is just the same as people,\' explained the little girl,\r\nwisely.  \'When they\'re grown up I suppose they\'ve got their troubles to\r\nthink about.\'\r\n\r\nOwen wondered how long it would be before her troubles commenced.  As\r\nhe gazed at these two little orphans he thought of his own child, and\r\nof the rough and thorny way they would all three have to travel if they\r\nwere so unfortunate as to outlive their childhood.\r\n\r\n\'Can we \'ave it, mister?\' repeated the boy.\r\n\r\nOwen would have liked to grant the children\'s request, but he wanted\r\nthe kitten himself.  Therefore he was relieved when their grandmother\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\'We don\'t want no more cats \'ere: we\'ve got one already; that\'s quite\r\nenough.\'\r\n\r\nShe was not yet quite satisfied in her mind that the creature was not\r\nan incarnation of the Devil, but whether it was or not she did not want\r\nit, or anything else of Owen\'s, in this house.  She wished he would go,\r\nand take his kitten or his familiar or whatever it was, with him. No\r\ngood could come of his being there.  Was it not written in the Word:\r\n\'If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema\r\nMaran-atha.\'  She did not know exactly what Anathema Maran-atha meant,\r\nbut there could be no doubt that it was something very unpleasant.  It\r\nwas a terrible thing that this blasphemer who--as she had heard--did\r\nnot believe there was a Hell and said that the Bible was not the Word\r\nof God, should be here in the house sitting on one of their chairs,\r\ndrinking from one of their cups, and talking to their children.\r\n\r\nThe children stood by wistfully when Owen put the kitten under his coat\r\nand rose to go away.\r\n\r\nAs Linden prepared to accompany him to the front door, Owen, happening\r\nto notice a timepiece standing on a small table in the recess at one\r\nside of the fireplace, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a very nice clock.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it\'s all right, ain\'t it?\' said old Jack, with a touch of pride.\r\n\'Poor Tom made that: not the clock itself, but just the case.\'\r\n\r\nIt was the case that had attracted Owen\'s attention.  It stood about\r\ntwo feet high and was made of fretwork in the form of an Indian mosque,\r\nwith a pointed dome and pinnacles.  It was a very beautiful thing and\r\nmust have cost many hours of patient labour.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said the old woman, in a trembling, broken voice, and looking at\r\nOwen with a pathetic expression.  \'Months and months he worked at it,\r\nand no one ever guessed who it were for.  And then, when my birthday\r\ncame round, the very first thing I saw when I woke up in the morning\r\nwere the clock standing on a chair by the bed with a card:\r\n\r\n           \'To dear mother, from her loving son, Tom.\r\n               Wishing her many happy birthdays.\'\r\n\r\n\'But he never had another birthday himself, because just five months\r\nafterwards he were sent out to Africa, and he\'d only been there five\r\nweeks when he died.  Five years ago, come the fifteenth of next month.\'\r\n\r\nOwen, inwardly regretting that he had unintentionally broached so\r\npainful a subject, tried to think of some suitable reply, but had to\r\ncontent himself with murmuring some words of admiration of the work.\r\n\r\nAs he wished her good night, the old woman, looking at him, could not\r\nhelp observing that he appeared very frail and ill: his face was very\r\nthin and pale, and his eyes were unnaturally bright.\r\n\r\nPossibly the Lord in His infinite loving kindness and mercy was\r\nchastening this unhappy castaway in order that He might bring him to\r\nHimself.  After all, he was not altogether bad: it was certainly very\r\nthoughtful of him to come all this way to let John know about that job.\r\nShe observed that he had no overcoat, and the storm was still raging\r\nfiercely outside, furious gusts of wind frequently striking the house\r\nand shaking it to its very foundations.\r\n\r\nThe natural kindliness of her character asserted itself; her better\r\nfeelings were aroused, triumphing momentarily over the bigotry of her\r\nreligious opinions.\r\n\r\n\'Why, you ain\'t got no overcoat!\' she exclaimed.  \'You\'ll be soaked\r\ngoin\' \'ome in this rain.\'  Then, turning to her husband, she continued:\r\n\'There\'s that old one of yours; you might lend him that; it would be\r\nbetter than nothing.\'\r\n\r\nBut Owen would not hear of this: he thought, as he became very\r\nconscious of the clammy feel of his saturated clothing, that he could\r\nnot get much wetter than he already was.  Linden accompanied him as far\r\nas the front door, and Owen once more set out on his way homeward\r\nthrough the storm that howled around like a wild beast hungry for its\r\nprey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nIt is not My Crime\r\n\r\n\r\nOwen and his family occupied the top floor of a house that had once\r\nbeen a large private dwelling but which had been transformed into a\r\nseries of flats.  It was situated in Lord Street, almost in the centre\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nAt one time this had been a most aristocratic locality, but most of the\r\nformer residents had migrated to the newer suburb at the west of the\r\ntown.  Notwithstanding this fact, Lord Street was still a most\r\nrespectable neighbourhood, the inhabitants generally being of a very\r\nsuperior type: shop-walkers, shop assistants, barber\'s clerks, boarding\r\nhouse keepers, a coal merchant, and even two retired jerry-builders.\r\n\r\nThere were four other flats in the house in which Owen lived.  No. 1\r\n(the basement) was occupied by an estate agent\'s clerk.  No. 2--on a\r\nlevel with the street--was the habitat of the family of Mr Trafaim, a\r\ncadaverous-looking gentleman who wore a top hat, boasted of his French\r\ndescent, and was a shop-walker at Sweater\'s Emporium.  No. 3 was\r\ntenanted by an insurance agent, and in No. 4 dwelt a tallyman\'s\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\nLord Street--like most other similar neighbourhoods--supplied a\r\nstriking answer to those futile theorists who prate of the equality of\r\nmankind, for the inhabitants instinctively formed themselves into\r\ngroups, the more superior types drawing together, separating themselves\r\nfrom the inferior, and rising naturally to the top, while the others\r\ngathered themselves into distinct classes, grading downwards, or else\r\nisolated themselves altogether; being refused admission to the circles\r\nthey desired to enter, and in their turn refusing to associate with\r\ntheir inferiors.\r\n\r\nThe most exclusive set consisted of the families of the coal merchant,\r\nthe two retired jerry-builders and Mr Trafaim, whose superiority was\r\ndemonstrated by the fact that, to say nothing of his French extraction,\r\nhe wore--in addition to the top hat aforesaid--a frock coat and a pair\r\nof lavender trousers every day.  The coal merchant and the jerry\r\nbuilders also wore top hats, lavender trousers and frock coats, but\r\nonly on Sundays and other special occasions.  The estate agent\'s clerk\r\nand the insurance agent, though excluded from the higher circle,\r\nbelonged to another select coterie from which they excluded in their\r\nturn all persons of inferior rank, such as shop assistants or barbers.\r\n\r\nThe only individual who was received with equal cordiality by all\r\nranks, was the tallyman\'s traveller.  But whatever differences existed\r\namongst them regarding each other\'s social standing they were unanimous\r\non one point at least: they were indignant at Owen\'s presumption in\r\ncoming to live in such a refined locality.\r\n\r\nThis low fellow, this common workman, with his paint-bespattered\r\nclothing, his broken boots, and his generally shabby appearance, was a\r\ndisgrace to the street; and as for his wife she was not much better,\r\nbecause although whenever she came out she was always neatly dressed,\r\nyet most of the neighbours knew perfectly well that she had been\r\nwearing the same white straw hat all the time she had been there.  In\r\nfact, the only tolerable one of the family was the boy, and they were\r\nforced to admit that he was always very well dressed; so well indeed as\r\nto occasion some surprise, until they found out that all the boy\'s\r\nclothes were home-made.  Then their surprise was changed into a\r\nsomewhat grudging admiration of the skill displayed, mingled with\r\ncontempt for the poverty which made its exercise necessary.\r\n\r\nThe indignation of the neighbours was increased when it became known\r\nthat Owen and his wife were not Christians: then indeed everyone agreed\r\nthat the landlord ought to be ashamed of himself for letting the top\r\nflat to such people.\r\n\r\nBut although the hearts of these disciples of the meek and lowly Jewish\r\ncarpenter were filled with uncharitableness, they were powerless to do\r\nmuch harm.  The landlord regarded their opinion with indifference.  All\r\nhe cared about was the money: although he also was a sincere Christian,\r\nhe would not have hesitated to let the top flat to Satan himself,\r\nprovided he was certain of receiving the rent regularly.\r\n\r\nThe only one upon whom the Christians were able to inflict any\r\nsuffering was the child.  At first when he used to go out into the\r\nstreet to play, the other children, acting on their parents\'\r\ninstructions, refused to associate with him, or taunted him with his\r\nparents\' poverty.  Occasionally he came home heartbroken and in tears\r\nbecause he had been excluded from some game.\r\n\r\nAt first, sometimes the mothers of some of the better-class children\r\nused to come out with a comical assumption of superiority and dignity\r\nand compel their children to leave off playing with Frankie and some\r\nother poorly dressed children who used to play in that street.  These\r\nfemales were usually overdressed and wore a lot of jewellery.  Most of\r\nthem fancied they were ladies, and if they had only had the sense to\r\nkeep their mouths shut, other people might possibly have shared the\r\nsame delusion.\r\n\r\nBut this was now a rare occurrence, because the parents of the other\r\nchildren found it a matter of considerable difficulty to prevent their\r\nyoungsters from associating with those of inferior rank, for when left\r\nto themselves the children disregarded all such distinctions.\r\nFrequently in that street was to be seen the appalling spectacle of the\r\nten-year-old son of the refined and fashionable Trafaim dragging along\r\na cart constructed of a sugar box and an old pair of perambulator\r\nwheels with no tyres, in which reposed the plebeian Frankie Owen, armed\r\nwith a whip, and the dowdy daughter of a barber\'s clerk: while the\r\nnine-year-old heir of the coal merchant rushed up behind...\r\n\r\nOwen\'s wife and little son were waiting for him in the living room.\r\nThis room was about twelve feet square and the ceiling--which was low\r\nand irregularly shaped, showing in places the formation of the\r\nroof--had been decorated by Owen with painted ornaments.\r\n\r\nThere were three or four chairs, and an oblong table, covered with a\r\nclean white tablecloth, set ready for tea.  In the recess at the right\r\nof fireplace--an ordinary open grate--were a number of shelves filled\r\nwith a miscellaneous collection of books, most of which had been bought\r\nsecond-hand.\r\n\r\nThere were also a number of new books, mostly cheap editions in paper\r\ncovers.\r\n\r\nOver the back of a chair at one side of the fire, was hanging an old\r\nsuit of Owen\'s, and some underclothing, which his wife had placed there\r\nto air, knowing that he would be wet through by the time he arrived\r\nhome...\r\n\r\nThe woman was half-sitting, half lying, on a couch by the other side of\r\nthe fire.  She was very thin, and her pale face bore the traces of much\r\nphysical and mental suffering.  She was sewing, a task which her\r\nreclining position rendered somewhat difficult.  Although she was\r\nreally only twenty-eight years of age, she appeared older.\r\n\r\nThe boy, who was sitting on the hearthrug playing with some toys, bore\r\na strong resemblance to his mother.  He also, appeared very fragile and\r\nin his childish face was reproduced much of the delicate prettiness\r\nwhich she had once possessed. His feminine appearance was increased by\r\nthe fact that his yellow hair hung in long curls on his shoulders.  The\r\npride with which his mother regarded this long hair was by no means\r\nshared by Frankie himself, for he was always entreating her to cut it\r\noff.\r\n\r\nPresently the boy stood up and walking gravely over to the window,\r\nlooked down into the street, scanning the pavement for as far as he\r\ncould see: he had been doing this at intervals for the last hour.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder wherever he\'s got to,\' he said, as he returned to the fire.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I don\'t know,\' returned his mother.  \'Perhaps he\'s had to\r\nwork overtime.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know, I\'ve been thinking lately,\' observed Frankie, after a pause,\r\n\'that it\'s a great mistake for Dad to go out working at all.  I believe\r\nthat\'s the very reason why we\'re so poor.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nearly everyone who works is more or less poor, dear, but if Dad\r\ndidn\'t go out to work we\'d be even poorer than we are now.  We should\r\nhave nothing to eat.\'\r\n\r\n\'But Dad says that the people who do nothing get lots of everything.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and it\'s quite true that most of the people who never do any work\r\nget lots of everything, but where do they get it from?  And how do they\r\nget it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I don\'t know,\' replied Frankie, shaking his head in a puzzled\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n\'Supposing Dad didn\'t go to work, or that he had no work to go to, or\r\nthat he was ill and not able to do any work, then we\'d have no money to\r\nbuy anything.  How should we get on then?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I don\'t know,\' repeated Frankie, looking round the room in a\r\nthoughtful manner, \'The chairs that\'s left aren\'t good enough to sell,\r\nand we can\'t sell the beds, or your sofa, but you might pawn my velvet\r\nsuit.\'\r\n\r\n\'But even if all the things were good enough to sell, the money we\'d\r\nget for them wouldn\'t last very long, and what should we do then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I suppose we\'d have to go without, that\'s all, the same as we\r\ndid when Dad was in London.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how do the people who never do any work manage to get lots of\r\nmoney then?\' added Frankie.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, there\'s lots of different ways.  For instance, you remember when\r\nDad was in London, and we had no food in the house, I had to sell the\r\neasy chair.\'\r\n\r\nFrankie nodded.  \'Yes,\' he said, \'I remember you wrote a note and I\r\ntook it to the shop, and afterwards old Didlum came up here and bought\r\nit, and then his cart came and a man took it away.\'\r\n\r\n\'And do you remember how much he gave us for it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Five shillings,\' replied Frankie, promptly.  He was well acquainted\r\nwith the details of the transaction, having often heard his father and\r\nmother discuss it.\r\n\r\n\'And when we saw it in his shop window a little while afterwards, what\r\nprice was marked on it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Fifteen shillings.\'\r\n\r\nWell, that\'s one way of getting money without working.\r\n\r\nFrankie played with his toys in silence for some minutes.  At last he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\'What other ways?\'\r\n\r\n\'Some people who have some money already get more in this way: they\r\nfind some people who have no money and say to them, "Come and work for\r\nus."  Then the people who have the money pay the workers just enough\r\nwages to keep them alive whilst they are at work.  Then, when the\r\nthings that the working people have been making are finished, the\r\nworkers are sent away, and as they still have no money, they are soon\r\nstarving.  In the meantime the people who had the money take all the\r\nthings that the workers have made and sell them for a great deal more\r\nmoney than they gave to the workers for making them.  That\'s another\r\nway of getting lots of money without doing any useful work.\'\r\n\r\n\'But is there no way to get rich without doing such things as that?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not possible for anyone to become rich without cheating other\r\npeople.\'\r\n\r\n\'What about our schoolmaster then?  He doesn\'t do any work.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you think it\'s useful and and also very hard work teaching all\r\nthose boys every day?  I don\'t think I should like to have to do it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I suppose what he does is some use,\' said Frankie thoughtfully.\r\n\'And it must be rather hard too, I should think.  I\'ve noticed he looks\r\na bit worried sometimes, and sometimes he gets into a fine old wax when\r\nthe boys don\'t pay proper attention.\'\r\n\r\nThe child again went over to the window, and pulling back the edge of\r\nthe blind looked down the deserted rain washed street.\r\n\r\n\'What about the vicar?\' he remarked as he returned.\r\n\r\nAlthough Frankie did not go to church or Sunday School, the day school\r\nthat he had attended was that attached to the parish church, and the\r\nvicar was in the habit of looking in occasionally.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, he really is one of those who live without doing any necessary\r\nwork, and of all the people who do nothing, the vicar is one of the\r\nvery worst.\'\r\n\r\nFrankie looked up at his mother with some surprise, not because he\r\nentertained any very high opinion of clergymen in general, for, having\r\nbeen an attentive listener to many conversations between his parents,\r\nhe had of course assimilated their opinions as far as his infant\r\nunderstanding permitted, but because at the school the scholars were\r\ntaught to regard the gentleman in question with the most profound\r\nreverence and respect.\r\n\r\n\'Why, Mum?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'For this reason, dearie.  You know that all the beautiful things which\r\nthe people who do nothing have are made by the people who work, don\'t\r\nyou?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you know that those who work have to eat the very worst food, and\r\nwear the very worst clothes, and live in the very worst homes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Frankie.\r\n\r\n\'And sometimes they have nothing to eat at all, and no clothes to wear\r\nexcept rags, and even no homes to live in.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' repeated the child.\r\n\r\n\'Well, the vicar goes about telling the Idlers that it\'s quite right\r\nfor them to do nothing, and that God meant them to have nearly\r\neverything that is made by those who work.  In fact, he tells them that\r\nGod made the poor for the use of the rich.  Then he goes to the workers\r\nand tells them that God meant them to work very hard and to give all\r\nthe good things they make to those who do nothing, and that they should\r\nbe very thankful to God and to the idlers for being allowed to have\r\neven the very worst food to eat and the rags, and broken boots to wear.\r\nHe also tells them that they mustn\'t grumble, or be discontented\r\nbecause they\'re poor in this world, but that they must wait till\r\nthey\'re dead, and then God will reward them by letting them go to a\r\nplace called Heaven.\'\r\n\r\nFrankie laughed.\r\n\r\n\'And what about the Idlers?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'The vicar says that if they believe everything he tells them and give\r\nhim some of the money they make out of the workers, then God will let\r\nthem into heaven also.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s not fair doos, is it, Mum?\' said Frankie with some\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\'It wouldn\'t be if it were true, but then you see it\'s not true, it\r\ncan\'t be true.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why can\'t it, Mum?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, for many reasons: to begin with, the vicar doesn\'t believe it\r\nhimself: he only pretends to.  For instance, he pretends to believe the\r\nBible, but if we read the Bible we find that Jesus said that God is our\r\nfather and that all the people in the world are His children, all\r\nbrothers and sisters.  But the vicar says that although Jesus said\r\n"brothers and sisters" He really ought to have said "masters and\r\nservants".  Again, Jesus said that His disciples should not think of\r\ntomorrow, or save up a lot of money for themselves, but they should be\r\nunselfish and help those who are in need.  Jesus said that His\r\ndisciples must not think about their own future needs at all, because\r\nGod will provide for them if they only do as He commands.  But the\r\nvicar says that is all nonsense.\r\n\r\n\'Jesus also said that if anyone tried to do His disciples harm, they\r\nmust never resist, but forgive those who injured them and pray God to\r\nforgive them also.  But the vicar says this is all nonsense too.  He\r\nsays that the world would never be able to go on if we did as Jesus\r\ntaught.  The vicar teaches that the way to deal with those that injure\r\nus is to have them put into prison, or--if they belong to some other\r\ncountry--to take guns and knives and murder them, and burn their\r\nhouses.  So you see the vicar doesn\'t really believe or do any of the\r\nthings that Jesus said: he only pretends.\'\r\n\r\n\'But why does he pretend, and go about talking like that, Mum?  What\r\ndoes he do it for?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because he wishes to live without working himself, dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'And don\'t the people know he\'s only pretending?\'\r\n\r\n\'Some of them do.  Most of the idlers know that what the vicar says is\r\nnot true, but they pretend to believe it, and give him money for saying\r\nit, because they want him to go on telling it to the workers so that\r\nthey will go on working and keep quiet and be afraid to think for\r\nthemselves.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what about the workers?  Do they believe it?\r\n\r\n\'Most of them do, because when they were little children like you,\r\ntheir mothers taught them to believe, without thinking, whatever the\r\nvicar said, and that God made them for the use of the idlers.  When\r\nthey went to school, they were taught the same thing: and now that\r\nthey\'re grown up they really believe it, and they go to work and give\r\nnearly everything they make to the idlers, and have next to nothing\r\nleft for themselves and their children.  That\'s the reason why the\r\nworkers\' children have very bad clothes to wear and sometimes no food\r\nto eat; and that\'s how it is that the idlers and their children have\r\nmore clothes than they need and more food than they can eat.  Some of\r\nthem have so much food that they are not able to eat it.  They just\r\nwaste it or throw it away.\'\r\n\r\n\'When I\'m grown up into a man,\' said Frankie, with a flushed face, \'I\'m\r\ngoing to be one of the workers, and when we\'ve made a lot of things, I\r\nshall stand up and tell the others what to do.  If any of the idlers\r\ncome to take our things away, they\'ll get something they won\'t like.\'\r\n\r\nIn a state of suppressed excitement and scarcely conscious of what he\r\nwas doing, the boy began gathering up the toys and throwing them\r\nviolently one by one into the box.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll teach \'em to come taking our things away,\' he exclaimed,\r\nrelapsing momentarily into his street style of speaking.\r\n\r\n\'First of all we\'ll all stand quietly on one side.  Then when the\r\nidlers come in and start touching our things, we\'ll go up to \'em and\r\nsay, "\'Ere, watcher doin\' of?  Just you put it down, will yer?"  And if\r\nthey don\'t put it down at once, it\'ll be the worse for \'em, I can tell\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\nAll the toys being collected, Frankie picked up the box and placed it\r\nnoisily in its accustomed corner of the room.\r\n\r\n\'I should think the workers will be jolly glad when they see me coming\r\nto tell them what to do, shouldn\'t you, Mum?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know dear; you see so many people have tried to tell them, but\r\nthey won\'t listen, they don\'t want to hear.  They think it\'s quite\r\nright that they should work very hard all their lives, and quite right\r\nthat most of the things they help to make should be taken away from\r\nthem by the people who do nothing.  The workers think that their\r\nchildren are not as good as the children of the idlers, and they teach\r\ntheir children that as soon as ever they are old enough they must be\r\nsatisfied to work very hard and to have only very bad good and clothes\r\nand homes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I should think the workers ought to be jolly ashamed of\r\nthemselves, Mum, don\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, in one sense they ought, but you must remember that that\'s what\r\nthey\'ve always been taught themselves.  First, their mothers and\r\nfathers told them so; then, their schoolteachers told them so; and\r\nthen, when they went to church, the vicar and the Sunday School teacher\r\ntold them the same thing.  So you can\'t be surprised that they now\r\nreally believe that God made them and their children to make things for\r\nthe use of the people who do nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you\'d think their own sense would tell them!  How can it be right\r\nfor the people who do nothing to have the very best and  most of\r\neverything thats made, and the very ones who make everything to have\r\nhardly any.  Why even I know better than that, and I\'m only six and a\r\nhalf years old.\'\r\n\r\n\'But then you\'re different, dearie, you\'ve been taught to think about\r\nit, and Dad and I have explained it to you, often.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know,\' replied Frankie confidently.  \'But even if you\'d never\r\ntaught me, I\'m sure I should have tumbled to it all right by myself;\r\nI\'m not such a juggins as you think I am.\'\r\n\r\n\'So you might, but you wouldn\'t if you\'d been brought up in the same\r\nway as most of the workers.  They\'ve been taught that it\'s very wicked\r\nto use their own judgement, or to think.  And their children are being\r\ntaught so now.  Do you remember what you told me the other day, when\r\nyou came home from school, about the Scripture lesson?\'\r\n\r\n\'About St Thomas?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  What did the teacher say St Thomas was?\'\r\n\r\n\'She said he was a bad example; and she said I was worse than him\r\nbecause I asked too many foolish questions.  She always gets in a wax\r\nif I talk too much.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, why did she call St Thomas a bad example?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because he wouldn\'t believe what he was told.\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly: well, when you told Dad about it what did he say?\'\r\n\r\n\'Dad told me that really St Thomas was the only sensible man in the\r\nwhole crowd of Apostles.  That is,\' added Frankie, correcting himself,\r\n\'if there ever was such a man at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'But did Dad say that there never was such a man?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; he said HE didn\'t believe there ever was, but he told me to just\r\nlisten to what the teacher said about such things, and then to think\r\nabout it in my own mind, and wait till I\'m grown up and then I can use\r\nmy own judgement.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, now, that\'s what YOU were told, but all the other children\'s\r\nmothers and fathers tell them to believe, without thinking, whatever\r\nthe teacher says.  So it will be no wonder if those children are not\r\nable to think for themselves when they\'re grown up, will it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you think it will be any use, then, for me to tell them what to\r\ndo to the Idlers?\' asked Frankie, dejectedly.\r\n\r\n\'Hark!\' said his mother, holding up her finger.\r\n\r\n\'Dad!\' cried Frankie, rushing to the door and flinging it open.  He ran\r\nalong the passage and opened the staircase door before Owen reached the\r\ntop of the last flight of stairs.\r\n\r\n\'Why ever do you come up at such a rate,\' reproachfully exclaimed\r\nOwen\'s wife as he came into the room exhausted from the climb upstairs\r\nand sank panting into the nearest chair.\r\n\r\n\'I al-ways-for-get,\' he replied, when he had in some degree recovered.\r\nAs he lay back in the chair, his face haggard and of a ghastly\r\nwhiteness, and with the water dripping from his saturated clothing,\r\nOwen presented a terrible appearance.\r\n\r\nFrankie noticed with childish terror the extreme alarm with which his\r\nmother looked at his father.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re always doing it,\' he said with a whimper.  \'How many more times\r\nwill Mother have to tell you about it before you take any notice?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all right, old chap,\' said Owen, drawing the child nearer to him\r\nand kissing the curly head.  \'Listen, and see if you can guess what\r\nI\'ve got for you under my coat.\'\r\n\r\nIn the silence the purring of the kitten was distinctly audible.\r\n\r\n\'A kitten!\' cried the boy, taking it out of its hiding-place.  \'All\r\nblack, and I believe it\'s half a Persian.  Just the very thing I\r\nwanted.\'\r\n\r\nWhile Frankie amused himself playing with the kitten, which had been\r\nprovided with another saucer of bread and milk, Owen went into the\r\nbedroom to put on the dry clothes, and then, those that he had taken\r\noff having been placed with his boots near the fire to dry, he\r\nexplained as they were taking tea the reason of his late homecoming.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid he won\'t find it very easy to get another job,\' he\r\nremarked, referring to Linden.  \'Even in the summer nobody will be\r\ninclined to take him on.  He\'s too old.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a dreadful prospect for the two children,\' answered his wife.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Owen bitterly.  \'It\'s the children who will suffer most.\r\nAs for Linden and his wife, although of course one can\'t help feeling\r\nsorry for them, at the same time there\'s no getting away from the fact\r\nthat they deserve to suffer.  All their lives they\'ve been working like\r\nbrutes and living in poverty.  Although they have done more than their\r\nfair share of the work, they have never enjoyed anything like a fair\r\nshare of the things they have helped to produce. And yet, all their\r\nlives they have supported and defended the system that robbed them, and\r\nhave resisted and ridiculed every proposal to alter it.  It\'s wrong to\r\nfeel sorry for such people; they deserve to suffer.\'\r\n\r\nAfter tea, as he watched his wife clearing away the tea things and\r\nrearranging the drying clothing by the fire, Owen for the first time\r\nnoticed that she looked unusually ill.\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t look well tonight, Nora,\' he said, crossing over to her and\r\nputting his arm around her.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t feel well,\' she replied, resting her head wearily against his\r\nshoulder.  \'I\'ve been very bad all day and I had to lie down nearly all\r\nthe afternoon.  I don\'t know how I should have managed to get the tea\r\nready if it had not been for Frankie.\'\r\n\r\n\'I set the table for you, didn\'t I, Mum?\' said Frankie with pride; \'and\r\ntidied up the room as well.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, darling, you helped me a lot,\' she answered, and Frankie went\r\nover to her and kissed her hand.\r\n\r\n\'Well, you\'d better go to bed at once,\' said Owen.  \'I can put Frankie\r\nto bed presently and do whatever else is necessary.\'\r\n\r\n\'But there are so many things to attend to.  I want to see that your\r\nclothes are properly dry and to put something ready for you to take in\r\nthe morning before you go out, and then there\'s your breakfast to pack\r\nup--\'\r\n\r\n\'I can manage all that.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t want to give way to it like this,\' the woman said, \'because I\r\nknow you must be tired out yourself, but I really do feel quite done up\r\nnow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m all right,\' replied Owen, who was really so fatigued that he\r\nwas scarcely able to stand.  \'I\'ll go and draw the blinds down and\r\nlight the other lamp; so say good night to Frankie and come at once.\'\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t say good night properly, now, Mum,\' remarked the boy, \'because\r\nDad can carry me into your room before he puts me into bed.\'\r\n\r\nA little later, as Owen was undressing Frankie, the latter remarked as\r\nhe looked affectionately at the kitten, which was sitting on the\r\nhearthrug watching the child\'s every movement under the impression that\r\nit was part of some game:\r\n\r\n\'What name do you think we ought to call it, Dad?\'\r\n\r\n\'You may give him any name you like,\' replied Owen, absently.\r\n\r\n\'I know a dog that lives down the road,\' said the boy, \'his name is\r\nMajor.  How would that do?  Or we might call him Sergeant.\'\r\n\r\nThe kitten, observing that he was the subject of their conversation,\r\npurred loudly and winked as if to intimate that he did not care what\r\nrank was conferred upon him so long as the commisariat department was\r\nproperly attended to.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know, though,\' continued Frankie, thoughtfully.  \'They\'re all\r\nright names for dogs, but I think they\'re too big for a kitten, don\'t\r\nyou, Dad?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, p\'raps they are,\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'Most cats are called Tom or Kitty, but I don\'t want a COMMON name for\r\nhim.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, can\'t you call him after someone you know?\'\r\n\r\n\'I know; I\'ll call him after a little girl that comes to our school; a\r\nfine name, Maud!  That\'ll be a good one, won\'t it Dad?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Dad,\' said Frankie, suddenly realizing the awful fact that he\r\nwas being put to bed.  \'You\'re forgetting all about my story, and you\r\npromised that you\'d have a game of trains with me tonight.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hadn\'t forgotten, but I was hoping that you had, because I\'m very\r\ntired and it\'s very late, long past your usual bedtime, you know.  You\r\ncan take the kitten to bed with you tonight and I\'ll tell you two\r\nstories tomorrow, because it\'s Saturday.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, then,\' said the boy, contentedly; \'and I\'ll get the railway\r\nstation built and I\'ll have the lines chalked on the floor, and the\r\nsignals put up before you come home, so that there\'ll be no time\r\nwasted.  And I\'ll put one chair at one end of the room and another\r\nchair at the other end, and tie some string across for telegraph wires.\r\nThat\'ll be a very good idea, won\'t it, Dad?\' and Owen agreed.\r\n\r\n\'But of course I\'ll come to meet you just the same as other Saturdays,\r\nbecause I\'m going to buy a ha\'porth of milk for the kitten out of my\r\npenny.\'\r\n\r\nAfter the child was in bed, Owen sat alone by the table in the draughty\r\nsitting-room, thinking.  Although there was a bright fire, the room was\r\nvery cold, being so close to the roof.  The wind roared loudly round\r\nthe gables, shaking the house in a way that threatened every moment to\r\nhurl it to the ground.  The lamp on the table had a green glass\r\nreservoir which was half full of oil.  Owen watched this with\r\nunconscious fascination.  Every time a gust of wind struck the house\r\nthe oil in the lamp was agitated and rippled against the glass like the\r\nwaves of a miniature sea.  Staring abstractedly at the lamp, he thought\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the future had seemed a region of wonderful and\r\nmysterious possibilities of good, but tonight the thought brought no\r\nsuch illusions, for he knew that the story of the future was to be much\r\nthe same as the story of the past.\r\n\r\nThe story of the past would continue to repeat itself for a few years\r\nlonger.  He would continue to work and they would all three continue to\r\ndo without most of the necessaries of life.  When there was no work\r\nthey would starve.\r\n\r\nFor himself he did not care much because he knew that at the best--or\r\nworst--it would only be a very few years.  Even if he were to have\r\nproper food and clothing and be able to take reasonable care of\r\nhimself, he could not live much longer; but when that time came, what\r\nwas to become of THEM?\r\n\r\nThere would be some hope for the boy if he were more robust and if his\r\ncharacter were less gentle and more selfish.  Under the present system\r\nit was impossible for anyone to succeed in life without injuring other\r\npeople and treating them and making use of them as one would not like\r\nto be treated and made use of oneself.\r\n\r\nIn order to succeed in the world it was necessary to be brutal, selfish\r\nand unfeeling: to push others aside and to take advantage of their\r\nmisfortunes: to undersell and crush out one\'s competitors by fair means\r\nor foul: to consider one\'s own interests first in every case,\r\nabsolutely regardless of the wellbeing of others.\r\n\r\nThat was the ideal character.  Owen knew that Frankie\'s character did\r\nnot come up to this lofty ideal.  Then there was Nora, how would she\r\nfare?\r\n\r\nOwen stood up and began walking about the room, oppressed with a kind\r\nof terror.  Presently he returned to the fire and began rearranging the\r\nclothes that were drying.  He found that the boots, having been placed\r\ntoo near the fire, had dried too quickly and consequently the sole of\r\none of them had begun to split away from the upper: he remedied this as\r\nwell as he was able and then turned the wetter parts of the clothing to\r\nthe fire.  Whilst doing this he noticed the newspaper, which he had\r\nforgotten, in the coat pocket.  He drew it out with an exclamation of\r\npleasure.  Here was something to distract his thoughts: if not\r\ninstructive or comforting, it would at any rate be interesting and even\r\namusing to read the reports of the self-satisfied, futile talk of the\r\nprofound statesmen who with comical gravity presided over the working\r\nof the Great System which their combined wisdom pronounced to be the\r\nbest that could possibly be devised.  But tonight Owen was not to read\r\nof those things, for as soon as he opened the paper his attention was\r\nriveted by the staring headline of one of the principal columns:\r\n\r\n                     TERRIBLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY\r\n                   Wife And Two Children Killed\r\n                      Suicide of the Murderer\r\n\r\nIt was one of the ordinary poverty crimes.  The man had been without\r\nemployment for many weeks and they had been living by pawning or\r\nselling their furniture and other possessions.  But even this resource\r\nmust have failed at last, and when one day the neighbours noticed that\r\nthe blinds remained down and that there was a strange silence about the\r\nhouse, no one coming out or going in, suspicions that something was\r\nwrong were quickly aroused.  When the police entered the house, they\r\nfound, in one of the upper rooms, the dead bodies of the woman and the\r\ntwo children, with their throats severed, laid out side by side upon\r\nthe bed, which was saturated with their blood.\r\n\r\nThere was no bedstead and no furniture in the room except the straw\r\nmattress and the ragged clothes and blankets which formed the bed upon\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nThe man\'s body was found in the kitchen, lying with outstretched arms\r\nface downwards on the floor, surrounded by the blood that had poured\r\nfrom the wound in his throat which had evidently been inflicted by the\r\nrazor that was grasped in his right hand.\r\n\r\nNo particle of food was found in the house, and on a nail in the wall\r\nin the kitchen was hung a piece of blood-smeared paper on which was\r\nwritten in pencil:\r\n\r\n\'This is not my crime, but society\'s.\'\r\n\r\nThe report went on to explain that the deed must have been perpetrated\r\nduring a fit of temporary insanity brought on by the sufferings the man\r\nhad endured.\r\n\r\n\'Insanity!\' muttered Owen, as he read this glib theory.  \'Insanity! It\r\nseems to me that he would have been insane if he had NOT killed them.\'\r\n\r\nSurely it was wiser and better and kinder to send them all to sleep,\r\nthan to let them continue to suffer.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he thought it very strange that the man should have\r\nchosen to do it that way, when there were so many other cleaner, easier\r\nand more painless ways of accomplishing the same object.  He wondered\r\nwhy it was that most of these killings were done in more or less the\r\nsame crude, cruel messy way.  No; HE would set about it in a different\r\nfashion.  He would get some charcoal, then he would paste strips of\r\npaper over the joinings of the door and windows of the room and close\r\nthe register of the grate.  Then he would kindle the charcoal on a tray\r\nor something in the middle of the room, and then they would all three\r\njust lie down together and sleep; and that would be the end of\r\neverything.  There would be no pain, no blood, and no mess.\r\n\r\nOr one could take poison.  Of course, there was a certain amount of\r\ndifficulty in procuring it, but it would not be impossible to find some\r\npretext for buying some laudanum: one could buy several small\r\nquantities at different shops until one had sufficient.  Then he\r\nremembered that he had read somewhere that vermillion, one of the\r\ncolours he frequently had to use in his work, was one of the most\r\ndeadly poisons: and there was some other stuff that photographers used,\r\nwhich was very easy to procure.  Of course, one would have to be very\r\ncareful about poisons, so as not to select one that would cause a lot\r\nof pain.  It would be necessary to find out exactly how the stuff acted\r\nbefore using it.  It would not be very difficult to do so.  Then he\r\nremembered that among his books was one that probably contained some\r\ninformation about this subject.  He went over to the book-shelf and\r\npresently found the volume; it was called The Cyclopedia of Practical\r\nMedicine, rather an old book, a little out of date, perhaps, but still\r\nit might contain the information he wanted.  Opening it, he turned to\r\nthe table of contents.  Many different subjects were mentioned there\r\nand presently he found the one he sought:\r\n\r\nPoisons: chemically, physiologically and pathologically considered.\r\n    Corrosive Poisons.\r\n    Narcotic Poisons.\r\n    Slow Poisons.\r\n    Consecutive Poisons.\r\n    Accumulative Poisons.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the chapter indicated and, reading it, he was astonished\r\nto find what a number of poisons there were within easy reach of\r\nwhoever wished to make use of them: poisons that could be relied upon\r\nto do their work certainly, quickly and without pain.  Why, it was not\r\neven necessary to buy them: one could gather them from the hedges by\r\nthe road side and in the fields.\r\n\r\nThe more he thought of it the stranger it seemed that such a clumsy\r\nmethod as a razor should be so popular.  Why almost any other way would\r\nbe better and easier than that.  Strangulation or even hanging, though\r\nthe latter method could scarcely be adopted in that house, because\r\nthere were no beams or rafters or anything from which it would be\r\npossible to suspend a cord.  Still, he could drive some large nails or\r\nhooks into one of the walls.  For that matter, there were already some\r\nclothes-hooks on some of the doors.  He began to think that this would\r\nbe an even more excellent way than poison or charcoal; he could easily\r\npretend to Frankie that he was going to show him some new kind of play.\r\n\r\nHe could arrange the cord on the hook on one of the doors and then\r\nunder pretence of play, it would be done.  The boy would offer no\r\nresistance, and in a few minutes it would all be over.\r\n\r\nHe threw down the book and pressed his hands over his ears: he fancied\r\nhe could hear the boy\'s hands and feet beating against the panels of\r\nthe door as he struggled in his death agony.\r\n\r\nThen, as his arms fell nervelessly by his side again, he thought that\r\nhe heard Frankie\'s voice calling.\r\n\r\n\'Dad!  Dad!\'\r\n\r\nOwen hastily opened the door.\r\n\r\n\'Are you calling, Frankie?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I\'ve been calling you quite a long time.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you want?\'\r\n\r\n\'I want you to come here.  I want to tell you something.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, what is it dear?  I thought you were asleep a long time ago,\'\r\nsaid Owen as he came into the room.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just what I want to speak to you about: the kitten\'s gone to\r\nsleep all right, but I can\'t go.  I\'ve tried all different ways,\r\ncounting and all, but it\'s no use, so I thought I\'d ask you if you\'d\r\nmind coming and staying with me, and letting me hold you hand for a\r\nlittle while and them p\'raps I could go.\'\r\n\r\nThe boy twined his arms round Owen\'s neck and hugged him very tightly.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Dad, I love you so much!\' he said.  \'I love you so much, I could\r\nsqueeze you to death.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid you will, if you squeeze me so tightly as that.\'\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed softly as he relaxed his hold.  \'That WOULD be a funny\r\nway of showing you how much I love you, wouldn\'t it, Dad?  Squeezing\r\nyou to death!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I suppose it would,\' replied Owen huskily, as he tucked the\r\nbedclothes round the child\'s shoulders.  \'But don\'t talk any more,\r\ndear; just hold my hand and try to sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Frankie.\r\n\r\nLying there very quietly, holding his father\'s hand and occasionally\r\nkissing it, the child presently fell asleep.  Then Owen got up very\r\ngently and, having taken the kitten out of the bed again and arranged\r\nthe bedclothes, he softly kissed the boy\'s forehead and returned to the\r\nother room.\r\n\r\nLooking about for a suitable place for the kitten to sleep in, he\r\nnoticed Frankie\'s toy box, and having emptied the toys on to the floor\r\nin a corner of the room, he made a bed in the box with some rags and\r\nplaced it on its side on the hearthrug, facing the fire, and with some\r\ndifficulty persuaded the kitten to lie in it.  Then, having placed the\r\nchairs on which his clothes were drying at a safe distance from the\r\nfire, he went into the bedroom.  Nora was still awake.\r\n\r\n\'Are you feeling any better, dear?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I\'m ever so much better since I\'ve been in bed, but I can\'t help\r\nworrying about your clothes.  I\'m afraid they\'ll never be dry enough\r\nfor you to put on the first thing in the morning.  Couldn\'t you stay at\r\nhome till after breakfast, just for once?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I mustn\'t do that.  If I did Hunter would probably tell me to stay\r\naway altogether.  I believe he would be glad of an excuse to get rid of\r\nanother full-price man just now.\'\r\n\r\n\'But if it\'s raining like this in the morning, you\'ll be wet through\r\nbefore you get there.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s no good worrying about that dear: besides, I can wear this old\r\ncoat that I have on now, over the other.\'\r\n\r\n\'And if you wrap your old shoes in some paper, and take them with you,\r\nyou can take off your wet boots as soon as you get to the place.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, all right,\' responded Owen.  \'Besides,\' he added, reassuringly,\r\n\'even if I do get a little wet, we always have a fire there, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I hope the weather will be a little better than this in the\r\nmorning,\' said Nora.  \'Isn\'t it a dreadful night!  I keep feeling\r\nafraid that the house is going to be blown down.\'\r\n\r\nLong after Nora was asleep, Owen lay listening to the howling of the\r\nwind and the noise of the rain as it poured heavily on the roof...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nThe Exterminating Machines\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Come on, Saturday!\' shouted Philpot, just after seven o\'clock one\r\nMonday morning as they were getting ready to commence work.\r\n\r\nIt was still dark outside, but the scullery was dimly illuminated by\r\nthe flickering light of two candles which Crass had lighted and stuck\r\non the shelf over the fireplace in order to enable him to see to serve\r\nout the different lots of paints and brushes to the men.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it do seem a \'ell of a long week, don\'t it?\' remarked Harlow as\r\nhe hung his overcoat on a nail and proceeded to put on his apron and\r\nblouse.  \'I\'ve \'ad bloody near enough of it already.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wish to Christ it was breakfast-time,\' growled the more easily\r\nsatisfied Easton.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary as it may appear, none of them took any pride in their\r\nwork: they did not \'love\' it.  They had no conception of that lofty\r\nideal of \'work for work\'s sake\', which is so popular with the people\r\nwho do nothing.  On the contrary, when the workers arrived in the\r\nmorning they wished it was breakfast-time.  When they resumed work\r\nafter breakfast they wished it was dinner-time.  After dinner they\r\nwished it was one o\'clock on Saturday.\r\n\r\nSo they went on, day after day, year after year, wishing their time was\r\nover and, without realizing it, really wishing that they were dead.\r\n\r\nHow extraordinary this must appear to those idealists who believe in\r\n\'work for work\'s sake\', but who themselves do nothing but devour or use\r\nand enjoy or waste the things that are produced by the labour of those\r\nothers who are not themselves permitted to enjoy a fair share of the\r\ngood things they help to create?\r\n\r\nCrass poured several lots of colour into several pots.\r\n\r\n\'Harlow,\' he said, \'you and Sawkins, when he comes, can go up and do\r\nthe top bedrooms out with this colour.  You\'ll find a couple of candles\r\nup there.  It\'s only goin\' to \'ave one coat, so see that you make it\r\ncover all right, and just look after Sawkins a bit so as \'e doesn\'t\r\nmake a bloody mess of it.  You do the doors and windows, and let \'im do\r\nthe cupboards and skirtings.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a bit of all right, I must say,\' Harlow said, addressing the\r\ncompany generally.  \'We\'ve got to teach a b--r like \'im so as \'e can do\r\nus out of a job presently by working under price.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I can\'t \'elp it,\' growled Crass.  \'You know \'ow it is: \'Unter\r\nsends \'im \'ere to do paintin\', and I\'ve got to put \'im on it.  There\r\nain\'t nothing else for \'im to do.\'\r\n\r\nFurther discussion on this subject was prevented by Sawkins\' arrival,\r\nnearly a quarter of an hour late.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you \'ave come, then,\' sneered Crass.  \'Thought p\'raps you\'d gorn\r\nfor a \'oliday.\'\r\n\r\nSawkins muttered something about oversleeping himself, and having\r\nhastily put on his apron, he went upstairs with Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Now, let\'s see,\' Crass said, addressing Philpot.  \'You and Newman \'ad\r\nbetter go and make a start on the second floor: this is the colour, and\r\n\'ere\'s a couple of candles.  You\'d better not both go in one room or\r\n\'Unter will growl about it.  You take one of the front and let Newman\r\ntake one of the back rooms.  Take a bit of stoppin\' with you: they\'re\r\ngoin\' to \'ave two coats, but you\'d better putty up the \'oles as well as\r\nyou can, this time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only two coats!\' said Philpot.  \'Them rooms will never look nothing\r\nwith two coats--a light colour like this.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s only goin\' to get two, anyway,\' returned Crass, testily. \'\'Unter\r\nsaid so, so you\'ll \'ave to do the best you can with \'em, and get \'em\r\nsmeared over middlin\' sudden, too.\'\r\n\r\nCrass did not think it necessary to mention that according to the copy\r\nof the specification of the work which he had in his pocket the rooms\r\nin question were supposed to have four coats.\r\n\r\nCrass now turned to Owen.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s that drorin\'-room,\' he said.  \'I don\'t know what\'s goin\' to be\r\ndone with that yet.  I don\'t think they\'ve decided about it. Whatever\'s\r\nto be done to it will be an extra, because all that\'s said about it in\r\nthe contract is to face it up with putty and give it one coat of white.\r\nSo you and Easton \'ad better get on with it.\'\r\n\r\nSlyme was busy softening some putty by rubbing and squeezing it between\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose I\'d better finish the room I started on on Saturday?\' he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' replied Crass.  \'Have you got enough colour?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Slyme.\r\n\r\nAs he passed through the kitchen on the way to his work, Slyme accosted\r\nBert, the boy, who was engaged in lighting, with some pieces of wood, a\r\nfire to boil the water to make the tea for breakfast at eight o\'clock.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s a bloater I want\'s cooked,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' replied Bert.  \'Put it over there on the dresser along of\r\nPhilpot\'s and mine.\'\r\n\r\nSlyme took the bloater from his food basket, but as he was about to put\r\nit in the place indicated, he observed that his was rather a larger one\r\nthan either of the other two.  This was an important matter.  After\r\nthey were cooked it would not be easy to say which was which: he might\r\npossibly be given one of the smaller ones instead of his own.  He took\r\nout his pocket knife and cut off the tail of the large bloater.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere it is, then,\' he said to Bert.  \'I\'ve cut the tail of mine so as\r\nyou\'ll know which it is.\'\r\n\r\nIt was now about twenty minutes past seven and all the other men having\r\nbeen started at work, Crass washed his hands under the tap. Then he\r\nwent into the kitchen and having rigged up a seat by taking two of the\r\ndrawers out of the dresser and placing them on the floor about six feet\r\napart and laying a plank across, he sat down in front of the fire,\r\nwhich was now burning brightly under the pail, and, lighting his pipe,\r\nbegan to smoke.  The boy went into the scullery and began washing up\r\nthe cups and jars for the men to drink out of.\r\n\r\nBert was a lean, undersized boy about fifteen years of age and about\r\nfour feet nine inches in height.  He had light brown hair and hazel\r\ngrey eyes, and his clothes were of many colours, being thickly\r\nencrusted with paint, the result of the unskillful manner in which he\r\ndid his work, for he had only been at the trade about a year.  Some of\r\nthe men had nicknamed him \'the walking paint-shop\', a title which Bert\r\naccepted good-humouredly.\r\n\r\nThis boy was an orphan.  His father had been a railway porter who had\r\nworked very laboriously for twelve or fourteen hours every day for many\r\nyears, with the usual result, namely, that he and his family lived in a\r\ncondition of perpetual poverty.  Bert, who was their only child and not\r\nvery robust, had early shown a talent for drawing, so when his father\r\ndied a little over a year ago, his mother readily assented when the boy\r\nsaid that he wished to become a decorator.  It was a nice light trade,\r\nand she thought that a really good painter, such as she was sure he\r\nwould become, was at least always able to earn a good living.\r\nResolving to give the boy the best possible chance, she decided if\r\npossible to place him at Rushton\'s, that being one of the leading firms\r\nin the town.  At first Mr Rushton demanded ten pounds as a premium, the\r\nboy to be bound for five years, no wages the first year, two shillings\r\na week the second, and a rise of one shilling every year for the\r\nremainder of the term.  Afterwards, as a special favour--a matter of\r\ncharity, in fact, as she was a very poor woman--he agreed to accept\r\nfive pounds.\r\n\r\nThis sum represented the thrifty savings of years, but the poor woman\r\nparted with it willingly in order that the boy should become a skilled\r\nworkman.  So Bert was apprenticed--bound for five years--to Rushton &\r\nCo.\r\n\r\nFor the first few months his life had been spent in the paint-shop at\r\nthe yard, a place that was something between a cellar and a stable.\r\nThere, surrounded by the poisonous pigments and materials of the trade,\r\nthe youthful artisan worked, generally alone, cleaning the dirty\r\npaint-pots brought in by the workmen from finished \'jobs\' outside, and\r\noccasionally mixing paint according to the instructions of Mr Hunter,\r\nor one of the sub-foremen.\r\n\r\nSometimes he was sent out to carry materials to the places where the\r\nmen were working--heavy loads of paint or white lead--sometimes pails\r\nof whitewash that his slender arms had been too feeble to carry more\r\nthan a few yards at a time.\r\n\r\nOften his fragile, childish figure was seen staggering manfully along,\r\nbending beneath the weight of a pair of steps or a heavy plank.\r\n\r\nHe could manage a good many parcels at once: some in each hand and some\r\ntied together with string and slung over his shoulders. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, there were more than he could carry; then they were put into a\r\nhandcart which he pushed or dragged after him to the distant jobs.\r\n\r\nThat first winter the boy\'s days were chiefly spent in the damp,\r\nevil-smelling, stone-flagged paint-shop, without even a fire to warm\r\nthe clammy atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBut in all this he had seen no hardship.  With the unconsciousness of\r\nboyhood, he worked hard and cheerfully.  As time went on, the goal of\r\nhis childish ambition was reached--he was sent out to work with the\r\nmen!  And he carried the same spirit with him, always doing his best to\r\noblige those with whom he was working.\r\n\r\nHe tried hard to learn, and to be a good boy, and he succeeded, fairly\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nHe soon became a favourite with Owen, for whom he conceived a great\r\nrespect and affection, for he observed that whenever there was any\r\nspecial work of any kind to be done it was Owen who did it.  On such\r\noccasions, Bert, in his artful, boyish way, would scheme to be sent to\r\nassist Owen, and the latter whenever possible used to ask that the boy\r\nmight be allowed to work with him.\r\n\r\nBert\'s regard for Owen was equalled in intensity by his dislike of\r\nCrass, who was in the habit of jeering at the boy\'s aspirations.\r\n\'There\'ll be plenty of time for you to think about doin\' fancy work\r\nafter you\'ve learnt to do plain painting,\' he would say.\r\n\r\nThis morning, when he had finished washing up the cups and mugs, Bert\r\nreturned with them to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\'Now let\'s see,\' said Crass, thoughtfully, \'You\'ve put the tea in the\r\npail, I s\'pose.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'And now you want a job, don\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\'Well, get a bucket of water and that old brush and a swab, and go and\r\nwash off the old whitewash and colouring orf the pantry ceiling and\r\nwalls.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Bert.  When he got as far as the door leading into\r\nthe scullery he looked round and said:\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve got to git them three bloaters cooked by breakfast time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind about that,\' said Crass.  \'I\'ll do them.\'\r\n\r\nBert got the pail and the brush, drew some water from the tap, got a\r\npair of steps and a short plank, one end of which he rested on the\r\nbottom shelf of the pantry and the other on the steps, and proceeded to\r\ncarry out Crass\'s instructions.\r\n\r\nIt was very cold and damp and miserable in the pantry, and the candle\r\nonly made it seem more so.  Bert shivered: he would like to have put\r\nhis jacket on, but that was out of the question at a job like this. He\r\nlifted the bucket of water on to one of the shelves and, climbing up on\r\nto the plank, took the brush from the water and soaked about a square\r\nyard of the ceiling; then he began to scrub it with the brush.\r\n\r\nHe was not very skilful yet, and as he scrubbed the water ran down over\r\nthe stock of the brush, over his hand and down his uplifted arm,\r\nwetting the turned-up sleeves of his shirt.  When he had scrubbed it\r\nsufficiently he rinsed it off as well as he could with the brush, and\r\nthen, to finish with, he thrust his hand into the pail of water and,\r\ntaking out the swab, wrung the water out of it and wiped the part of\r\nthe ceiling that he had washed.  Then he dropped it back into the pail,\r\nand shook his numbed fingers to restore the circulation.  Then he\r\npeeped into the kitchen, where Crass was still seated by the fire,\r\nsmoking and toasting one of the bloaters at the end of a pointed stick.\r\nBert wished he would go upstairs, or anywhere, so that he himself might\r\ngo and have a warm at the fire.\r\n\r\n\'\'E might just as well \'ave let me do them bloaters,\' he muttered to\r\nhimself, regarding Crass malignantly through the crack of the door.\r\n\'This is a fine job to give to anybody--a cold mornin\' like this.\'\r\n\r\nHe shifted the pail of water a little further along the shelf and went\r\non with the work.\r\n\r\nA little later, Crass, still sitting by the fire, heard footsteps\r\napproaching along the passage.  He started up guiltily and, thrusting\r\nthe hand holding his pipe into his apron pocket, retreated hastily into\r\nthe scullery.  He thought it might be Hunter, who was in the habit of\r\nturning up at all sorts of unlikely times, but it was only Easton.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve got a bit of bacon I want the young \'un to toast for me,\' he said\r\nas Crass came back.\r\n\r\n\'You can do it yourself if you like,\' replied Crass affably, looking at\r\nhis watch.  \'It\'s about ten to eight.\'\r\n\r\nEaston had been working for Rushton & Co. for a fortnight, and had been\r\nwise enough to stand Crass a drink on several occasions: he was\r\nconsequently in that gentleman\'s good books for the time being.\r\n\r\n\'How are you getting on in there?\' Crass asked, alluding to the work\r\nEaston and Owen were doing in the drawing-room.  \'You ain\'t fell out\r\nwith your mate yet, I s\'pose?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; \'e ain\'t got much to say this morning; \'is cough\'s pretty bad.  I\r\ncan generally manage to get on orl right with anybody, you know,\'\r\nEaston added.\r\n\r\n\'Well, so can I as a rule, but I get a bit sick listening to that\r\nbloody fool.  Accordin\' to \'im, everything\'s wrong.  One day it\'s\r\nreligion, another it\'s politics, and the next it\'s something else.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it is a bit thick; too much of it,\' agreed Easton, \'but I don\'t\r\ntake no notice of the bloody fool: that\'s the best way.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course, we know that things is a bit bad just now,\' Crass went on,\r\n\'but if the likes of \'im could \'ave their own way they\'d make \'em a\r\nbloody sight worse.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just what I say,\' replied Easton.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve got a pill ready for \'im, though, next time \'e start yappin\',\'\r\nCrass continued as he drew a small piece of printed paper from his\r\nwaistcoat pocket.  \'Just read that; it\'s out of the Obscurer.\'\r\n\r\nEaston took the newspaper cutting and read it: \'Very good,\' he remarked\r\nas he handed it back.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think that\'ll about shut \'im up.  Did yer notice the other day\r\nwhen we was talking about poverty and men bein\' out of work, \'ow \'e\r\ndodged out of answerin\' wot I said about machinery bein\' the cause of\r\nit?   \'e never answered me!  Started talkin\' about something else.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I remember \'e never answered it,\' said Easton, who had really no\r\nrecollection of the incident at all.\r\n\r\n\'I mean to tackle \'im about it at breakfast-time.  I don\'t see why \'e\r\nshould be allowed to get out of it like that.  There was a bloke down\r\nat the "Cricketers" the other night talkin\' about the same thing--a\r\nchap as takes a interest in politics and the like, and \'e said the very\r\nsame as me.  Why, the number of men what\'s been throwed out of work by\r\nall this \'ere new-fangled machinery is something chronic!\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' agreed Easton, \'everyone knows it.\'\r\n\r\n\'You ought to give us a look in at the "Cricketers" some night. There\'s\r\na lot of decent chaps comes there.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think I will.\'\r\n\r\n\'What \'ouse do you usually use?\' asked Crass after a pause.\r\n\r\nEaston laughed.  \'Well, to tell you the truth I\'ve not used anywhere\'s\r\nlately.  Been \'avin too many \'ollerdays.\'\r\n\r\n\'That do make a bit of difference, don\'t it?\' said Crass.  \'But you\'ll\r\nbe all right \'ere, till this job\'s done.  Just watch yerself a bit, and\r\ndon\'t get comin\' late in the mornin\'s.  Old Nimrod\'s dead nuts on that.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll see to that all right,\' replied Easton.  \'I don\'t believe in\r\nlosing time when there IS work to do.  It\'s bad enough when you can\'t\r\nget it.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know,\' Crass went on, confidentially.  \'Between me an\' you an\' the\r\ngatepost, as the sayin\' is, I don\'t think Mr bloody Owen will be \'ere\r\nmuch longer.  Nimrod \'ates the sight of \'im.\'\r\n\r\nEaston had it in his mind to say that Nimrod seemed to hate the sight\r\nof all of them: but he made no remark, and Crass continued:\r\n\r\n\'\'E\'s \'eard all about the way Owen goes on about politics and religion,\r\nan\' one thing an\' another, an\' about the firm scampin\' the work.  You\r\nknow that sort of talk don\'t do, does it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course not.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Unter would \'ave got rid of \'im long ago, but it wasn\'t \'im as took\r\n\'im on in the first place.  It was Rushton \'imself as give \'im a start.\r\nIt seems Owen took a lot of samples of \'is work an\' showed \'em to the\r\nBloke.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is them the things wot\'s \'angin\' up in the shop-winder?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes!\' said Crass, contemptuously.  \'But \'e\'s no good on plain work. Of\r\ncourse \'e does a bit of grainin\' an\' writin\'--after a fashion--when\r\nthere\'s any to do, and that ain\'t often, but on plain work, why,\r\nSawkins is as good as \'im for most of it, any day!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I suppose \'e is,\' replied Easton, feeling rather ashamed of\r\nhimself for the part he was taking in this conversation.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had for the moment forgotten the existence of Bert, Crass\r\nhad instinctively lowered his voice, but the boy--who had left off\r\nworking to warm his hands by putting them into his trousers\r\npockets--managed, by listening attentively, to hear every word.\r\n\r\n\'You know there\'s plenty of people wouldn\'t give the firm no more work\r\nif they knowed about it,\' Crass continued.  \'Just fancy sendin\' a b--r\r\nlike that to work in a lady\'s or gentleman\'s \'ouse--a bloody Atheist!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it is a bit orf, when you look at it like that.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know my missis--for one--wouldn\'t \'ave a feller like that in our\r\nplace.  We \'ad a lodger once and she found out that \'e was a\r\nfreethinker or something, and she cleared \'im out, bloody quick, I can\r\ntell yer!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, by the way,\' said Easton, glad of an opportunity to change the\r\nsubject, \'you don\'t happen to know of anyone as wants a room, do you?\r\nWe\'ve got one more than we want, so the wife thought that we might as\r\nwell let it.\'\r\n\r\nCrass thought for a moment.  \'Can\'t say as I do,\' he answered,\r\ndoubtfully.  \'Slyme was talking last week about leaving the place \'e\'s\r\nlodging at, but I don\'t know whether \'e\'s got another place to go to.\r\nYou might ask him.  I don\'t know of anyone else.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll speak to \'im,\' replied Easton.  \'What\'s the time? it must be\r\nnearly on it.\'\r\n\r\n\'So it is: just on eight,\' exclaimed Crass, and drawing his whistle he\r\nblew a shrill blast upon it to apprise the others of the fact.\r\n\r\n\'Has anyone seen old Jack Linden since \'e got the push?\' inquired\r\nHarlow during breakfast.\r\n\r\n\'I seen \'im Saterdy,\' said Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'Is \'e doin\' anything?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know: I didn\'t \'ave time to speak to \'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, \'e ain\'t got nothing,\' remarked Philpot.  \'I seen \'im Saterdy\r\nnight, an\' \'e told me \'e\'s been walkin\' about ever since.\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot did not add that he had \'lent\' Linden a shilling, which he\r\nnever expected to see again.\r\n\r\n\'\'E won\'t be able to get a job again in a \'urry,\' remarked Easton.\r\n\'\'E\'s too old.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know, after all, you can\'t blame Misery for sackin\' \'im,\' said\r\nCrass after a pause.  \'\'E was too slow for a funeral.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder how much YOU\'LL be able to do when you\'re as old as he is?\'\r\nsaid Owen.\r\n\r\n\'P\'raps I won\'t want to do nothing,\' replied Crass with a feeble laugh.\r\n\'I\'m goin\' to live on me means.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should say the best thing old Jack could do would be to go in the\r\nunion,\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Yes: I reckon that\'s what\'ll be the end of it,\' said Easton in a\r\nmatter-of-fact tone.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a grand finish, isn\'t it?\' observed Owen.  \'After working hard\r\nall one\'s life to be treated like a criminal at the end.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what you call bein\' treated like criminals,\' exclaimed\r\nCrass.  \'I reckon they \'as a bloody fine time of it, an\' we\'ve got to\r\nfind the money.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, for God\'s sake don\'t start no more arguments,\' cried Harlow,\r\naddressing Owen.  \'We \'ad enough of that last week.  You can\'t expect a\r\nboss to employ a man when \'e\'s too old to work.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course not,\' said Crass.\r\n\r\nPhilpot said--nothing.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see no sense in always grumblin\',\' Crass proceeded.  \'These\r\nthings can\'t be altered.  You can\'t expect there can be plenty of work\r\nfor everyone with all this \'ere labour-savin\' machinery what\'s been\r\ninvented.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said Harlow, \'the people what used to be employed on the\r\nwork what\'s now done by machinery, has to find something else to do.\r\nSome of \'em goes to our trade, for instance: the result is there\'s too\r\nmany at it, and there ain\'t enough work to keep \'em all goin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' cried Crass, eagerly.  \'That\'s just what I say.  Machinery is\r\nthe real cause of the poverty.  That\'s what I said the other day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Machinery is undoubtedly the cause of unemployment,\' replied Owen,\r\n\'but it\'s not the cause of poverty: that\'s another matter altogether.\'\r\n\r\nThe others laughed derisively.\r\n\r\n\'Well, it seems to me to amount to the same thing,\' said Harlow, and\r\nnearly everyone agreed.\r\n\r\n\'It doesn\'t seem to me to amount to the same thing,\' Owen replied. \'In\r\nmy opinion, we are all in a state of poverty even when we have\r\nemployment--the condition we are reduced to when we\'re out of work is\r\nmore properly described as destitution.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poverty,\' continued Owen after a short silence, \'consists in a\r\nshortage of the necessaries of life.  When those things are so scarce\r\nor so dear that people are unable to obtain sufficient of them to\r\nsatisfy all their needs, those people are in a condition of poverty. If\r\nyou think that the machinery, which makes it possible to produce all\r\nthe necessaries of life in abundance, is the cause of the shortage, it\r\nseems to me that there must be something the matter with your minds.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, of course we\'re all bloody fools except you,\' snarled Crass. \'When\r\nthey were servin\' out the sense, they give you such a \'ell of a lot,\r\nthere wasn\'t none left for nobody else.\'\r\n\r\n\'If there wasn\'t something wrong with your minds,\' continued Owen, \'you\r\nwould be able to see that we might have "Plenty of Work" and yet be in\r\na state of destitution.  The miserable wretches who toil sixteen or\r\neighteen hours a day--father, mother and even the little\r\nchildren--making match-boxes, or shirts or blouses, have "plenty of\r\nwork", but I for one don\'t envy them.  Perhaps you think that if there\r\nwas no machinery and we all had to work thirteen or fourteen hours a\r\nday in order to obtain a bare living, we should not be in a condition\r\nof poverty?  Talk about there being something the matter with your\r\nminds! If there were not, you wouldn\'t talk one day about Tariff Reform\r\nas a remedy for unemployment and then the next day admit that Machinery\r\nis the cause of it!  Tariff Reform won\'t do away with the machinery,\r\nwill it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Tariff Reform is the remedy for bad trade,\' returned Crass.\r\n\r\n\'In that case Tariff Reform is the remedy for a disease that does not\r\nexist.  If you would only take the trouble to investigate for yourself\r\nyou would find out that trade was never so good as it is at present:\r\nthe output--the quantity of commodities of every kind--produced in and\r\nexported from this country is greater than it has ever been before.\r\nThe fortunes amassed in business are larger than ever before: but at\r\nthe same time--owing, as you have just admitted--to the continued\r\nintroduction and extended use of wages-saving machinery, the number of\r\nhuman beings being employed is steadily decreasing.  I have here,\'\r\ncontinued Owen, taking out his pocket-book, \'some figures which I\r\ncopied from the Daily Mail Year Book for 1907, page 33:\r\n\r\n\'"It is a very noticeable fact that although the number of factories\r\nand their value have vastly increased in the United Kingdom, there is\r\nan absolute decrease in the number of men and women employed in those\r\nfactories between 1895 and 1901.  This is doubtless due to the\r\ndisplacement of hand labour by machinery!"\r\n\r\n\'Will Tariff Reform deal with that?  Are the good, kind capitalists\r\ngoing to abandon the use of wages-saving machinery if we tax all\r\nforeign-made goods?  Does what you call "Free Trade" help us here?  Or\r\ndo you think that abolishing the House of Lords, or disestablishing the\r\nChurch, will enable the workers who are displaced to obtain employment?\r\nSince it IS true--as you admit--that machinery is the principal cause\r\nof unemployment, what are you going to do about it? What\'s your remedy?\'\r\n\r\nNo one answered, because none of them knew of any remedy: and Crass\r\nbegan to feel sorry that he had re-introduced the subject at all.\r\n\r\n\'In the near future,\' continued Owen, \'it is probable that horses will\r\nbe almost entirely superseded by motor cars and electric trams.  As the\r\nservices of horses will be no longer required, all but a few of those\r\nanimals will be caused to die out: they will no longer be bred to the\r\nsame extent as formerly.  We can\'t blame the horses for allowing\r\nthemselves to be exterminated.  They have not sufficient intelligence\r\nto understand what\'s being done.  Therefore they will submit tamely to\r\nthe extinction of the greater number of their kind.\r\n\r\n\'As we have seen, a great deal of the work which was formerly done by\r\nhuman beings is now being done by machinery.  This machinery belongs to\r\na few people: it is worked for the benefit of those few, just the same\r\nas were the human beings it displaced.  These Few have no longer any\r\nneed of the services of so many human workers, so they propose to\r\nexterminate them!  The unnecessary human beings are to be allowed to\r\nstarve to death!  And they are also to be taught that it is wrong to\r\nmarry and breed children, because the Sacred Few do not require so many\r\npeople to work for them as before!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and you\'ll never be able to prevent it, mate!\' shouted Crass.\r\n\r\n\'Why can\'t we?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because it can\'t be done!\' cried Crass fiercely.  \'It\'s impossible!\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re always sayin\' that everything\'s all wrong,\' complained Harlow,\r\n\'but why the \'ell don\'t you tell us \'ow they\'re goin\' to be put right?\'\r\n\r\n\'It doesn\'t seem to me as if any of you really wish to know.  I believe\r\nthat even if it were proved that it could be done, most of you would be\r\nsorry and would do all you could to prevent it.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E don\'t know \'isself,\' sneered Crass.  \'Accordin\' to \'im, Tariff\r\nReform ain\'t no bloody good--Free Trade ain\'t no bloody good, and\r\neverybody else is wrong!  But when you arst \'im what ought to be\r\ndone--\'e\'s flummoxed.\'\r\n\r\nCrass did not feel very satisfied with the result of this machinery\r\nargument, but he consoled himself with the reflection that he would be\r\nable to flatten out his opponent on another subject.  The cutting from\r\nthe Obscurer which he had in his pocket would take a bit of answering!\r\nWhen you have a thing in print--in black and white--why there it is,\r\nand you can\'t get away from it!  If it wasn\'t right, a paper like that\r\nwould never have printed it.  However, as it was now nearly half past\r\neight, he resolved to defer this triumph till another occasion.  It was\r\ntoo good a thing to be disposed of in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nThe Cap on the Stairs\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, when they were working together in the drawing-room,\r\nEaston, desiring to do Owen a good turn, thought he would put him on\r\nhis guard, and repeated to him in a whisper the substance of the\r\nconversation he had held with Crass concerning him.\r\n\r\n\'Of course, you needn\'t mention that I told you, Frank,\' he said, \'but\r\nI thought I ought to let you know: you can take it from me, Crass ain\'t\r\nno friend of yours.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve know that for a long time, mate,\' replied Owen.  \'Thanks for\r\ntelling me, all the same.\'\r\n\r\n\'The bloody rotter\'s no friend of mine either, or anyone else\'s, for\r\nthat matter,\' Easton continued, \'but of course it doesn\'t do to fall\r\nout with \'im because you never know what he\'d go and say to ol\' \'Unter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, one has to remember that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course we all know what\'s the matter with \'im as far as YOU\'RE\r\nconcerned,\' Easton went on.  \'He don\'t like \'avin\' anyone on the firm\r\nwot knows more about the work than \'e does \'imself--thinks \'e might git\r\nworked out of \'is job.\'\r\n\r\nOwen laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\'He needn\'t be afraid of ME on THAT account.  I wouldn\'t have his job\r\nif it were offered to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'But \'e don\'t think so,\' replied Easton, \'and that\'s why \'e\'s got \'is\r\nknife into you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe that what he said about Hunter is true enough,\' said Owen.\r\n\'Every time he comes here he tries to goad me into doing or saying\r\nsomething that would give him an excuse to tell me to clear out.  I\r\nmight have done it before now if I had not guessed what he was after,\r\nand been on my guard.\'\r\n\r\nMeantime, Crass, in the kitchen, had resumed his seat by the fire with\r\nthe purpose of finishing his pipe of tobacco.  Presently he took out\r\nhis pocket-book and began to write in it with a piece of black-lead\r\npencil.  When the pipe was smoked out he knocked the bowl against the\r\ngrate to get rid of the ash, and placed the pipe in his waistcoat\r\npocket.  Then, having torn out the leaf on which he had been writing,\r\nhe got up and went into the pantry, where Bert was still struggling\r\nwith the old whitewash.\r\n\r\n\'Ain\'t yer nearly finished?  I don\'t want yer to stop in \'ere all day,\r\nyer know.\'\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t got much more to do now,\' said the boy.  \'Just this bit under\r\nthe bottom shelf and then I\'m done.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and a bloody fine mess you\'ve made, what I can see of it!\'\r\ngrowled Crass.  \'Look at all this water on the floor!\'\r\n\r\nBert looked guiltily at the floor and turned very red.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll clean it all up\', he stammered.  \'As soon as I\'ve got this bit of\r\nwall done, I\'ll wipe all the mess up with the swab.\'\r\n\r\nCrass now took a pot of paint and some brushes and, having put some\r\nmore fuel on the fire, began in a leisurely way to paint some of the\r\nwoodwork in the kitchen.  Presently Bert came in.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve finished there,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'About time, too.  You\'ll \'ave to look a bit livelier than you do, you\r\nknow, or me and you will fall out.\'\r\n\r\nBert did not answer.\r\n\r\n\'Now I\'ve got another job for yer.  You\'re fond of drorin, ain\'t yer?\'\r\ncontinued Crass in a jeering tone.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, a little,\' replied the boy, shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Crass, giving him the leaf he had torn out of the\r\npocket-book, \'you can go up to the yard and git them things and put \'em\r\non a truck and dror it up \'ere, and git back as soon as you can. Just\r\nlook at the paper and see if you understand it before you go.  I don\'t\r\nwant you to make no mistakes.\'\r\n\r\nBert took the paper and with some difficulty read as follows:\r\n\r\n    I pare steppes 8 foot\r\n    1/2 gallon Plastor off perish\r\n    1 pale off witewosh\r\n    12 lbs wite led\r\n    1/2 gallon Linsede Hoil\r\n    Do. Do. turps\r\n\r\n\'I can make it out all right.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'d better bring the big truck,\' said Crass, \'because I want you to\r\ntake the venetian blinds with you on it when you take it back tonight.\r\nThey\'ve got to be painted at the shop.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right.\'\r\n\r\nWhen the boy had departed Crass took a stroll through the house to see\r\nhow the others were getting on.  Then he returned to the kitchen and\r\nproceeded with his work.\r\n\r\nCrass was about thirty-eight years of age, rather above middle height\r\nand rather stout.  He had a considerable quantity of curly black hair\r\nand wore a short beard of the same colour.  His head was rather large,\r\nbut low, and flat on top.  When among his cronies he was in the habit\r\nof referring to his obesity as the result of good nature and a\r\ncontented mind.  Behind his back other people attributed it to beer,\r\nsome even going to far as to nickname him the \'tank\'.\r\n\r\nThere was no work of a noisy kind being done this morning.  Both the\r\ncarpenters and the bricklayers having been taken away, temporarily, to\r\nanother \'job\'.  At the same time there was not absolute silence:\r\noccasionally Crass could hear the voices of the other workmen as they\r\nspoke to each other, sometimes shouting from one room to another.  Now\r\nand then Harlow\'s voice rang through the house as he sang snatches of\r\nmusic-hall songs or a verse of a Moody and Sankey hymn, and\r\noccasionally some of the others joined in the chorus or interrupted the\r\nsinger with squeals and catcalls.  Once or twice Crass was on the point\r\nof telling them to make less row: there would be a fine to do if Nimrod\r\ncame and heard them.  Just as he had made up his mind to tell them to\r\nstop the noise, it ceased of itself and he heard loud whispers:\r\n\r\n\'Look out!  Someone\'s comin\'.\'\r\n\r\nThe house became very quiet.\r\n\r\nCrass put out his pipe and opened the window and the back door to get\r\nrid of the smell of the tobacco smoke.  Then he shifted the pair of\r\nsteps noisily, and proceeded to work more quickly than before.  Most\r\nlikely it was old Misery.\r\n\r\nHe worked on for some time in silence, but no one came to the kitchen:\r\nwhoever it was must have gone upstairs.  Crass listened attentively.\r\nWho could it be?  He would have liked to go to see whom it was, but at\r\nthe same time, if it were Nimrod, Crass wished to be discovered at\r\nwork.  He therefore waited a little longer and presently he heard the\r\nsound of voices upstairs but was unable to recognize them.  He was just\r\nabout to go out into the passage to listen, when whoever it was began\r\ncoming downstairs.  Crass at once resumed his work.  The footsteps came\r\nalong the passage leading to the kitchen: slow, heavy, ponderous\r\nfootsteps, but yet the sound was not such as would be made by a man\r\nheavily shod.  It was not Misery, evidently.\r\n\r\nAs the footsteps entered the kitchen, Crass looked round and beheld a\r\nvery tall, obese figure, with a large, fleshy, coarse-featured,\r\nclean-shaven face, and a great double chin, the complexion being of the\r\ncolour and appearance of the fat of uncooked bacon.  A very large\r\nfleshy nose and weak-looking pale blue eyes, the slightly inflamed lids\r\nbeing almost destitute of eye-lashes.  He had large fat feet cased in\r\nsoft calfskin boots, with drab-coloured spats.  His overcoat, heavily\r\ntrimmed with sealskin, reached just below the knees, and although the\r\ntrousers were very wide they were filled by the fat legs within, the\r\nshape of the calves being distinctly perceptible.  Even as the feet\r\nseemed about to burst the uppers of the boots, so the legs appeared to\r\nthreaten the trousers with disruption.  This man was so large that his\r\nfigure completely filled up the doorway, and as he came in he stooped\r\nslightly to avoid damaging the glittering silk hat on his head.  One\r\ngloved hand was thrust into the pocket of the overcoat and in the other\r\nhe carried a small Gladstone bag.\r\n\r\nWhen Crass beheld this being, he touched his cap respectfully.\r\n\r\n\'Good morning, sir!\'\r\n\r\n\'Good morning.  They told me upstairs that I should find the foreman\r\nhere.  Are you the foreman?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see you\'re getting on with the work here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ho yes sir, we\'re beginning to make a bit hov a show now, sir,\'\r\nreplied Crass, speaking as if he had a hot potato in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\'Mr Rushton isn\'t here yet, I suppose?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, sir: \'e don\'t horfun come hon the job hin the mornin, sir; \'e\r\ngenerally comes hafternoons, sir, but Mr \'Unter\'s halmost sure to be\r\n\'ere presently, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s Mr Rushton I want to see: I arranged to meet him here at ten\r\no\'clock; but\'--looking at his watch--\'I\'m rather before my time.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'ll be here presently, I suppose,\' added Mr Sweater.  \'I\'ll just\r\ntake a look round till he comes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' responded Crass, walking behind him obsequiously as he went\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\nHoping that the gentleman might give him a shilling, Crass followed him\r\ninto the front hall and began explaining what progress had so far been\r\nmade with the work, but as Mr Sweater answered only by monosyllables\r\nand grunts, Crass presently concluded that his conversation was not\r\nappreciated and returned to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nMeantime, upstairs, Philpot had gone into Newman\'s room and was\r\ndiscussing with him the possibility of extracting from Mr Sweater the\r\nprice of a little light refreshment.\r\n\r\n\'I think,\' he remarked, \'that we oughter see-ise this \'ere tuneropperty\r\nto touch \'im for an allowance.\'\r\n\r\n\'We won\'t git nothin\' out of \'IM, mate,\' returned Newman.  \'\'E\'s a\r\nred-\'ot teetotaller.\'\r\n\r\n\'That don\'t matter.  \'Ow\'s \'e to know that we buys beer with it?  We\r\nmight \'ave tea, or ginger ale, or lime-juice and glycerine for all \'e\r\nknows!\'\r\n\r\nMr Sweater now began ponderously re-ascending the stairs and presently\r\ncame into the room where Philpot was.  The latter greeted him with\r\nrespectful cordiality:\r\n\r\n\'Good morning, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good morning.  You\'ve begun painting up here, then.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir, we\'ve made a start on it,\' replied Philpot, affably.\r\n\r\n\'Is this door wet?\' asked Sweater, glancing apprehensively at the\r\nsleeve of his coat.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' answered Philpot, and added, as he looked meaningly at the\r\ngreat man, \'the paint is wet, sir, but the PAINTERS is dry.\'\r\n\r\n\'Confound it!\' exclaimed Sweater, ignoring, or not hearing the latter\r\npart of Philpot\'s reply.  \'I\'ve got some of the beastly stuff on my\r\ncoat sleeve.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that\'s nothing, sir,\' cried Philpot, secretly delighted.  \'I\'ll\r\nget that orf for yer in no time.  You wait just \'arf a mo!\'\r\n\r\nHe had a piece of clean rag in his tool bag, and there was a can of\r\nturps in the room.  Moistening the rag slightly with turps he carefully\r\nremoved the paint from Sweater\'s sleeve.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all orf now, sir,\' he remarked, as he rubbed the place with a dry\r\npart of the rag.  \'The smell of the turps will go away in about a\r\nhour\'s time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thanks,\' said Sweater.\r\n\r\nPhilpot looked at him wistfully, but Sweater evidently did not\r\nunderstand, and began looking about the room.\r\n\r\n\'I see they\'ve put a new piece of skirting here,\' he observed.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' said Newman, who came into the room just then to get the\r\nturps.  \'The old piece was all to bits with dry-rot.\'\r\n\r\n\'I feel as if I \'ad a touch of the dry-rot meself, don\'t you?\' said\r\nPhilpot to Newman, who smiled feebly and cast a sidelong glance at\r\nSweater, who did not appear to notice the significance of the remark,\r\nbut walked out of the room and began climbing up to the next floor,\r\nwhere Harlow and Sawkins were working.\r\n\r\n\'Well, there\'s a bleeder for yer!\' said Philpot with indignation.\r\n\'After all the trouble I took to clean \'is coat!  Not a bloody stiver!\r\nWell, it takes the cake, don\'t it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I told you \'ow it would be, didn\'t I?\' replied Newman.\r\n\r\n\'P\'raps I didn\'t make it plain enough,\' said Philpot, thoughtfully. \'We\r\nmust try to get some of our own back somehow, you know.\'\r\n\r\nGoing out on the landing he called softly upstairs.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Harlow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hallo,\' said that individual, looking over the banisters.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow are yer getting on up there?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, all right, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pretty dry job, ain\'t it?\' Philpot continued, raising his voice a\r\nlittle and winking at Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it is, rather,\' replied Harlow with a grin.\r\n\r\n\'I think this would be a very good time to take up the collection,\r\ndon\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it wouldn\'t be a bad idear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ll put me cap on the stairs,\' said Philpot, suiting the action\r\nto the word.  \'You never knows yer luck.  Things is gettin\' a bit\r\nserious on this floor, you know; my mate\'s fainted away once already!\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot now went back to his room to await developments: but as Sweater\r\nmade no sign, he returned to the landing and again hailed Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'I always reckon a man can work all the better after \'e\'s \'ad a drink:\r\nyou can seem to get over more of it, like.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that\'s true enough,\' responded Harlow.  \'I\'ve often noticed it\r\nmeself.\'\r\n\r\nSweater came out of the front bedroom and passed into one of the back\r\nrooms without any notice of either of the men.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid it\'s a frost, mate,\' Harlow whispered, and Philpot, shaking\r\nhis head sadly, returned to work; but in a little while he came out\r\nagain and once more accosted Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'I knowed a case once,\' he said in a melancholy tone, \'where a chap\r\ndied--of thirst--on a job just like this; and at the inquest the doctor\r\nsaid as \'arf a pint would \'a saved \'im!\'\r\n\r\n\'It must \'ave been a norrible death,\' remarked Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'\'Orrible ain\'t the work for it, mate,\' replied Philpot, mournfully.\r\n\'It was something chronic!\'\r\n\r\nAfter this final heartrending appeal to Sweater\'s humanity they\r\nreturned to work, satisfied that, whatever the result of their efforts,\r\nthey had done their best.  They had placed the matter fully and fairly\r\nbefore him: nothing more could be said: the issue now rested entirely\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nBut it was all in vain.  Sweater either did not or would not\r\nunderstand, and when he came downstairs he took no notice whatever of\r\nthe cap which Philpot had placed so conspicuously in the centre of the\r\nlanding floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nWho is to Pay?\r\n\r\n\r\nSweater reached the hall almost at the same moment that Rushton entered\r\nby the front door.  They greeted each other in a friendly way and after\r\na few remarks concerning the work that was being done, they went into\r\nthe drawing-room where Owen and Easton were and Rushton said:\r\n\r\n\'What about this room?  Have you made up your mind what you\'re going to\r\nhave done to it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Sweater; \'but I\'ll tell you about that afterwards. What\r\nI\'m anxious about is the drains.  Have you brought the plans?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s it going to cost?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just wait a minute,\' said Rushton, with a slight gesture calling\r\nSweater\'s attention to the presence of the two workmen.  Sweater\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\'You might leave that for a few minutes, will you?\' Rushton continued,\r\naddressing Owen and Easton.  \'Go and get on with something else for a\r\nlittle while.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone, Rushton closed the door and remarked: \'It\'s\r\nalways as well not to let these fellows know more than is necessary.\'\r\n\r\nSweater agreed.\r\n\r\n\'Now this \'ere drain work is really two separate jobs,\' said Rushton.\r\n\'First, the drains of the house: that is, the part of the work that\'\r\nactually on your ground.  When that\'s done, there will \'ave to be a\r\npipe carried right along under this private road to the main road to\r\nconnect the drains of the house with the town main.  You follow me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Perfectly.  What\'s it going to cost for the lot?\'\r\n\r\n\'For the drains of the house, L25.0.0. and for the connecting pipe\r\nL30.0.0.  L55.0.0. for the lot.\'\r\n\r\n\'Um!  That the lower you can do it for, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the lowest.  I\'ve figured it out most carefully, the time and\r\nmaterials, and that\'s practically all I\'m charging you.\'\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter was that Rushton had had nothing whatever to do\r\nwith estimating the cost of this work: he had not the necessary\r\nknowledge to do so.  Hunter had drawn the plans, calculated the cost\r\nand prepared the estimate.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been thinking over this business lately,\' said Sweater, looking\r\nat Rushton with a cunning leer.  \'I don\'t see why I should have to pay\r\nfor the connecting pipe.  The Corporation ought to pay for that.  What\r\ndo you say?\'\r\n\r\nRushton laughed.  \'I don\'t see why not,\' he replied.\r\n\r\n\'I think we could arrange it all right, don\'t you?\' Sweater went on.\r\n\'Anyhow, the work will have to be done, so you\'d better let \'em get on\r\nwith it.  L55.0.0. covers both jobs, you say?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, all right, you get on with it and we\'ll see what can be done with\r\nthe Corporation later on.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t suppose we\'ll find \'em very difficult to deal with,\' said\r\nRushton with a grin, and Sweater smiled agreement.\r\n\r\nAs they were passing through the hall they met Hunter, who had just\r\narrived.  He was rather surprised to see them, as he knew nothing of\r\ntheir appointment.  He wished them \'Good morning\' in an awkward\r\nhesitating undertone as if he were doubtful how his greeting would be\r\nreceived.  Sweater nodded slightly, but Rushton ignored him altogether\r\nand Nimrod passed on looking and feeling like a disreputable cur that\r\nhad just been kicked.\r\n\r\nAs Sweater and Rushton walked together about the house, Hunter hovered\r\nabout them at a respectable distance, hoping that presently some notice\r\nmight be taken of him.  His dismal countenance became even longer than\r\nusual when he observed that they were about to leave the house without\r\nappearing even to know that he was there.  However, just as they were\r\ngoing out, Rushton paused on the threshold and called him:\r\n\r\n\'Mr Hunter!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\nNimrod ran to him like a dog taken notice of by his master: if he had\r\npossessed a tail, it is probable that he would have wagged it. Rushton\r\ngave him the plans with an intimation that the work was to be proceeded\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nFor some time after they were gone, Hunter crawled silently about the\r\nhouse, in and out of the rooms, up and down the corridors  and the\r\nstaircases.  After a while he went into the room where Newman was and\r\nstood quietly watching him for about ten minutes as he worked.  The man\r\nwas painting the skirting, and just then he came to a part that was\r\nsplit in several places, so he took his knife and began to fill the\r\ncracks with putty.  He was so nervous under Hunter\'s scrutiny that his\r\nhand trembled to such an extent that it took him about twice as long as\r\nit should have done, and Hunter told him so with brutal directness.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind about puttying up such little cracks as them!\' he shouted.\r\n\'Fill \'em up with the paint.   We can\'t afford to pay you for messing\r\nabout like that!\'\r\n\r\nNewman made no reply.\r\n\r\nMisery found no excuse for bullying anyone else, because they were all\r\ntearing into it for all they were worth.  As he wandered up and down\r\nthe house like an evil spirit, he was followed by the furtively\r\nunfriendly glances of the men, who cursed him in their hearts as he\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nHe sneaked into the drawing-room and after standing with a malignant\r\nexpression, silently watching Owen and Easton, he came out again\r\nwithout having uttered a word.\r\n\r\nAlthough he frequently acted in this manner, yet somehow today the\r\ncircumstance worried Owen considerably.  He wondered uneasily what it\r\nmeant, and began to feel vaguely apprehensive.  Hunter\'s silence seemed\r\nmore menacing than his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nThe Long Hill\r\n\r\n\r\nBert arrived at the shop and with as little delay as possible loaded up\r\nthe handcart with all the things he had been sent for and started on the\r\nreturn journey.  He got on all right in the town, because the roads\r\nwere level and smooth, being paved with wood blocks.  If it had only\r\nbeen like that all the way it would have been easy enough, although he\r\nwas a small boy for such a large truck, and such a heavy load.  While\r\nthe wood road lasted the principal trouble he experienced was the\r\ndifficulty of seeing where he was going, the handcart being so high and\r\nhimself so short.  The pair of steps on the cart of course made it all\r\nthe worse in that respect.  However, by taking great care he managed to\r\nget through the town all right, although he narrowly escaped colliding\r\nwith several vehicles, including two or three motor cars and an\r\nelectric tram, besides nearly knocking over an old woman who was\r\ncarrying a large bundle of washing.  From time to time he saw other\r\nsmall boys of his acquaintance, some of them former schoolmates. Some\r\nof these passed by carrying heavy loads of groceries in baskets, and\r\nothers with wooden trays full of joints of meat.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the wood paving ceased at the very place where the\r\nground began to rise.  Bert now found himself at the beginning of a\r\nlong stretch of macadamized road which rose slightly and persistently\r\nthroughout its whole length.  Bert had pushed a cart up this road many\r\ntimes before and consequently knew the best method of tackling it.\r\nExperience had taught him that a full frontal attack on this hill was\r\nliable to failure, so on this occasion he followed his usual plan of\r\nmaking diagonal movements, crossing the road repeatedly from right to\r\nleft and left to right, after the fashion of a sailing ship tacking\r\nagainst the wind, and halting about every twenty yards to rest and take\r\nbreath.  The distance he was to go was regulated, not so much by his\r\npowers of endurance as by the various objects by the wayside--the\r\nlamp-posts, for instance.  During each rest he used to look ahead and\r\nselect a certain lamp-post or street corner as the next stopping-place,\r\nand when he start again he used to make the most strenuous and\r\ndesperate efforts to reach it.\r\n\r\nGenerally the goal he selected was too distant, for he usually\r\noverestimated his strength, and whenever he was forced to give in he\r\nran the truck against the kerb and stood there panting for breath and\r\nfeeling profoundly disappointed at his failure.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, during one of these rests, it flashed upon him\r\nthat he was being a very long time: he would have to buck up or he\r\nwould get into a row: he was not even half-way up the road yet!\r\n\r\nSelecting a distant lamp-post, he determined to reach it before resting\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe cart had a single shaft with a cross-piece at the end, forming the\r\nhandle: he gripped this fiercely with both hands and, placing his chest\r\nagainst it, with a mighty effort he pushed the cart before him.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to get heavier and heavier every foot of the way.  His whole\r\nbody, but especially the thighs and calves of his legs, pained\r\nterribly, but still he strained and struggled and said to himself that\r\nhe would not give in until he reached the lamp-post.\r\n\r\nFinding that the handle hurt his chest, he lowered it to his waist, but\r\nthat being even more painful he raised it again to his chest, and\r\nstruggled savagely on, panting for breath and with his heart beating\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\nThe cart became heavier and heavier.  After a while it seemed to the\r\nboy as if there were someone at the front of it trying to push him back\r\ndown the hill.  This was such a funny idea that for a moment he felt\r\ninclined to laugh, but the inclination went almost as soon as it came\r\nand was replaced by the dread that he would not be able to hold out\r\nlong enough to reach the lamp-post, after all.  Clenching his teeth, he\r\nmade a tremendous effort and staggered forward two or three more steps\r\nand then--the cart stopped.  He struggled with it despairingly for a\r\nfew seconds, but all the strength had suddenly gone out of him: his\r\nlegs felt so weak that he nearly collapsed on to the ground, and the\r\ncart began to move backwards down the hill.  He was just able to stick\r\nto it and guide it so that it ran into and rested against the kerb, and\r\nthen he stood holding it in a half-dazed way, very pale, saturated with\r\nperspiration, and trembling.  His legs in particular shook so much that\r\nhe felt that unless he could sit down for a little, he would FALL down.\r\n\r\nHe lowered the handle very carefully so as not to spill the whitewash\r\nout of the pail which was hanging from a hook under the cart, then,\r\nsitting down on the kerbstone, he leaned wearily against the wheel.\r\n\r\nA little way down the road was a church with a clock in the tower.  It\r\nwas five minutes to ten by this clock.  Bert said to himself that when\r\nit was ten he would make another start.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was resting he thought of many things.  Just behind that\r\nchurch was a field with several ponds in it where he used to go with\r\nother boys to catch effets.  If it were not for the cart he would go\r\nacross now, to see whether there were any there still.  He remembered\r\nthat he had been very eager to leave school and go to work, but they\r\nused to be fine old times after all.\r\n\r\nThen he thought of the day when his mother took him to Mr Rushton\'s\r\noffice to \'bind\' him.  He remembered that day very vividly: it was\r\nalmost a year ago.  How nervous he had been!  His hand had trembled so\r\nthat he was scarcely able to hold the pen.  And even when it was all\r\nover, they had both felt very miserable, somehow.  His mother had been\r\nvery nervous in the office also, and when they got home she cried a lot\r\nand called him her poor little fatherless boy, and said she hoped he\r\nwould be good and try to learn.  And then he cried as well, and\r\npromised her that he would do his best.  He reflected with pride that\r\nhe was keeping his promise about being a good boy and trying to learn:\r\nin fact, he knew a great deal about the trade already--he could paint\r\nback doors as well as anybody! and railings as well.  Owen had taught\r\nhim lots of things and had promised to do some patterns of graining for\r\nhim so that he might practise copying them at home in the evenings.\r\nOwen was a fine chap.  Bert resolved that he would tell him what Crass\r\nhad been saying to Easton.  Just fancy, the cheek of a rotter like\r\nCrass, trying to get Owen the sack!  It would be more like it if Crass\r\nwas to be sacked himself, so that Owen could be the foreman.\r\n\r\nOne minute to ten.\r\n\r\nWith a heavy heart Bert watched the clock.  His legs were still aching\r\nvery badly.  He could not see the hands of the clock moving, but they\r\nwere creeping on all the same.  Now, the minute hand was over the edge\r\nof the number, and he began to deliberate whether he might not rest for\r\nanother five minutes?  But he had been such a long time already on his\r\nerrand that he dismissed the thought.  The minute hand was now upright\r\nand it was time to go on.\r\n\r\nJust as he was about to get up a harsh voice behind him said:\r\n\r\n\'How much longer are you going to sit there?\'\r\n\r\nBert started up guiltily, and found himself confronted by Mr Rushton,\r\nwho was regarding him with an angry frown, whilst close by towered the\r\ncolossal figure of the obese Sweater, the expression on his greasy\r\ncountenance betokening the pain he experienced on beholding such as\r\nappalling example of juvenile depravity.\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean by sich conduct?\' demanded Rushton, indignantly. \'The\r\nidear of sitting there like that when most likely the men are waiting\r\nfor them things?\'\r\n\r\nCrimson with shame and confusion, the boy made no reply.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve been there a long time,\' continued Rushton, \'I\'ve been watchin\'\r\nyou all the time I\'ve been comin\' down the road.\'\r\n\r\nBert tried to speak to explain why he had been resting, but his mouth\r\nand his tongue had become quite parched from terror and he was unable\r\nto articulate a single word.\r\n\r\n\'You know, that\'s not the way to get on in life, my boy,\' observed\r\nSweater lifting his forefinger and shaking his fat head reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\'Get along with you at once!\' Rushton said, roughly.  \'I\'m surprised at\r\nyer!  The idear!  Sitting down in my time!\'\r\n\r\nThis was quite true.  Rushton was not merely angry, but astonished at\r\nthe audacity of the boy.  That anyone in his employment should dare to\r\nhave the impertinence to sit down in his time was incredible.\r\n\r\nThe boy lifted the handle of the cart and once more began to push it up\r\nthe hill.  It seemed heavier now that ever, but he managed to get on\r\nsomehow.  He kept glancing back after Rushton and Sweater, who\r\npresently turned a corner and were lost to view: then he ran the cart\r\nto the kerb again to have a breathe.  He couldn\'t have kept up much\r\nfurther without a spell even if they had still been watching him, but\r\nhe didn\'t rest for more than about half a minute this time, because he\r\nwas afraid they might be peeping round the corner at him.\r\n\r\nAfter this he gave up the lamp-post system and halted for a minute or\r\nso at regular short intervals.  In this way, he at length reached the\r\ntop of the hill, and with a sigh of relief congratulated himself that\r\nthe journey was practically over.\r\n\r\nJust before he arrived at the gate of the house, he saw Hunter sneak\r\nout and mount his bicycle and ride away.  Bert wheeled his cart up to\r\nthe front door and began carrying in the things.  Whilst thus engaged\r\nhe noticed Philpot peeping cautiously over the banisters of the\r\nstaircase, and called out to him:\r\n\r\n\'Give us a hand with this bucket of whitewash, will yer, Joe?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly, me son, with the greatest of hagony,\' replied Philpot as he\r\nhurried down the stairs.\r\n\r\nAs they were carrying it in Philpot winked at Bert and whispered:\r\n\r\n\'Did yer see Pontius Pilate anywheres outside?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E went away on \'is bike just as I come in at the gate.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did \'e?  Thank Gord for that!  I don\'t wish \'im no \'arm,\' said\r\nPhilpot, fervently, \'but I \'opes \'e gets runned over with a motor.\'\r\n\r\nIn this wish Bert entirely concurred, and similar charitable sentiments\r\nwere expressed by all the others as soon as they heard that Misery was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nJust before four o\'clock that afternoon Bert began to load up the truck\r\nwith the venetian blinds, which had been taken down some days\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder who\'ll have the job of paintin\' \'em?\' remarked Philpot to\r\nNewman.\r\n\r\n\'P\'raps\'s they\'ll take a couple of us away from ere.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shouldn\'t think so.  We\'re short-\'anded \'ere already.  Most likely\r\nthey\'ll put on a couple of fresh \'ands.  There\'s a \'ell of a lot of\r\nwork in all them blinds, you know: I reckon they\'ll \'ave to \'ave three\r\nor four coats, the state they\'re in.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  No doubt that\'s what will be done,\' replied Newman, and added\r\nwith a mirthless laugh:\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t suppose they\'ll have much difficulty in getting a couple of\r\nchaps.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, you\'re right, mate.  There\'s plenty of \'em walkin\' about as a\r\nweek\'s work would be a Gordsend to.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come to think of it,\' continued Newman after a pause, \'I believe the\r\nfirm used to give all their blind work to old Latham, the venetian\r\nblind maker.  Prap\'s they\'ll give \'im this lot to do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very likely,\' replied Philpot, \'I should think \'e can do \'em cheaper\r\neven than us chaps, and that\'s all the firm cares about.\'\r\n\r\nHow far their conjectures were fulfilled will appear later.\r\n\r\nShortly after Bert was gone it became so dark that it was necessary to\r\nlight the candles, and Philpot remarked that although he hated working\r\nunder such conditions, yet he was always glad when lighting up time\r\ncame, because then knocking off time was not very far behind.\r\n\r\nAbout five minutes to five, just as they were all putting their things\r\naway for the night, Nimrod suddenly appeared in the house.  He had come\r\nhoping to find some of them ready dressed to go home before the proper\r\ntime.  Having failed in this laudable enterprise, he stood silently by\r\nhimself for some seconds in the drawing-room.  This was a spacious and\r\nlofty apartment with a large semicircular bay window. Round the ceiling\r\nwas a deep cornice.  In the semi-darkness the room appeared to be of\r\neven greater proportions than it really was.  After standing thinking\r\nin this room for a little while, Hunter turned and strode out to the\r\nkitchen, where the men were preparing to go home. Owen was taking off\r\nhis blouse and apron as the other entered.  Hunter addressed him with a\r\nmalevolent snarl:\r\n\r\n\'You can call at the office tonight as you go home.\'\r\n\r\nOwen\'s heart seemed to stop beating.  All the petty annoyances he had\r\nendured from Hunter rushed into his memory, together with what Easton\r\nhad told him that morning.  He stood, still and speechless, holding his\r\napron in his hand and staring at the manager.\r\n\r\n\'What for?\' he ejaculated at length.  \'What\'s the matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll find out what you\'re wanted for when you get there,\' returned\r\nHunter as he went out of the room and away from the house.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone a dead silence prevailed.  The hands ceased their\r\npreparations for departure and looked at each other and at Owen in\r\nastonishment.  To stand a man off like that--when the job was not half\r\nfinished--and for no apparent reason: and of a Monday, too.  It was\r\nunheard of.  There was a general chorus of indignation.  Harlow and\r\nPhilpot especially were very wroth.\r\n\r\n\'If it comes to that,\' Harlow shouted, \'they\'ve got no bloody right to\r\ndo it!  We\'re entitled to an hour\'s notice.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course we are!\' cried Philpot, his goggle eyes rolling wildly with\r\nwrath.  \'And I should \'ave it too, if it was me.  You take my tip,\r\nFrank: CHARGE UP TO SIX O\'CLOCK on yer time sheet and get some of your\r\nown back.\'\r\n\r\nEveryone joined in the outburst of indignant protest.  Everyone, that\r\nis, except Crass and Slyme.  But then they were not exactly in the\r\nkitchen: they were out in the scullery putting their things away, and\r\nso it happened that they said nothing, although they exchanged\r\nsignificant looks.\r\n\r\nOwen had by this time recovered his self-possession.  He collected all\r\nhis tools and put them with his apron and blouse into his tool-bag with\r\nthe purpose of taking them with him that night, but on reflection he\r\nresolved not to do so.  After all, it was not absolutely certain that\r\nhe was going to be \'stood off\': possibly they were going to send him on\r\nsome other job.\r\n\r\nThey kept all together--some walking on the pavement and some in the\r\nroad--until they got down town, and then separated.  Crass, Sawkins,\r\nBundy and Philpot adjourned to the \'Cricketers\' for a drink, Newman\r\nwent on by himself, Slyme accompanied Easton who had arranged with him\r\nto come that night to see the bedroom, and Owen went in the direction\r\nof the office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nHands and Brains\r\n\r\n\r\nRushton & Co.\'s premises were situated in one of the principal streets\r\nof Mugsborough and consisted of a double-fronted shop with plate glass\r\nwindows.  The shop extended right through to the narrow back street\r\nwhich ran behind it.  The front part of the shop was stocked with\r\nwall-hangings, mouldings, stands showing patterns of embossed wall and\r\nceiling decorations, cases of brushes, tins of varnish and enamel, and\r\nsimilar things.\r\n\r\nThe office was at the rear and was separated from the rest of the shop\r\nby a partition, glazed with muranese obscured glass.  This office had\r\ntwo doors, one in the partition, giving access to the front shop, and\r\nthe other by the side of the window and opening on to the back street.\r\nThe glass of the lower sash of the back window consisted of one large\r\npane on which was painted \'Rushton & Co.\' in black letters on a white\r\nground.\r\n\r\nOwen stood outside this window for two or three seconds before\r\nknocking.  There was a bright light in the office.  Then he knocked at\r\nthe door, which was at once opened from the inside by Hunter, and Owen\r\nwent in.\r\n\r\nRushton was seated in an armchair at his desk, smoking a cigar and\r\nreading one of several letters that were lying before him.  At the back\r\nwas a large unframed photograph of the size known as half-plate of the\r\ninterior of some building.  At another desk, or rather table, at the\r\nother side of the office, a young woman was sitting writing in a large\r\nledger.  There was a typewriting machine on the table at her side.\r\n\r\nRushton glanced up carelessly as Owen came in, but took no further\r\nnotice of him.\r\n\r\n\'Just wait a minute,\' Hunter said to Owen, and then, after conversing\r\nin a low tone with Rushton for a few minutes, the foreman put on his\r\nhat and went out of the office through the partition door which led\r\ninto the front shop.\r\n\r\nOwen stood waiting for Rushton to speak.  He wondered why Hunter had\r\nsneaked off and felt inclined to open the door and call him back.  One\r\nthing he was determined about: he meant to have some explanation: he\r\nwould not submit tamely to be dismissed without any just reason.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished reading the letter, Rushton looked up, and,\r\nleaning comfortably back in his chair, he blew a cloud of smoke from\r\nhis cigar, and said in an affable, indulgent tone, such as one might\r\nuse to a child:\r\n\r\n\'You\'re a bit of a hartist, ain\'t yer?\'\r\n\r\nOwen was so surprised at this reception that he was for the moment\r\nunable to reply.\r\n\r\n\'You know what I mean,\' continued Rushton; \'decorating work, something\r\nlike them samples of yours what\'s hanging up there.\'\r\n\r\nHe noticed the embarrassment of Owen\'s manner, and was gratified.  He\r\nthought the man was confused at being spoken to by such a superior\r\nperson as himself.\r\n\r\nMr Rushton was about thirty-five years of age, with light grey eyes,\r\nfair hair and moustache, and his complexion was a whitey drab.  He was\r\ntall--about five feet ten inches--and rather clumsily built; not\r\ncorpulent, but fat--in good condition.  He appeared to be very well fed\r\nand well cared for generally.  His clothes were well made, of good\r\nquality and fitted him perfectly.  He was dressed in a grey Norfolk\r\nsuit, dark brown boots and knitted woollen stockings reaching to the\r\nknee.\r\n\r\nHe was a man who took himself very seriously.  There was an air of\r\npomposity and arrogant importance about him which--considering who and\r\nwhat he was--would have been entertaining to any observer gifted with a\r\nsense of humour.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Owen at last.  \'I can do a little of that sort of work,\r\nalthough of course I don\'t profess to be able to do it as well or as\r\nquickly as a man who does nothing else.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no, of course not, but I think you could manage this all right.\r\nIt\'s that drawing-room at the \'Cave\'.  Mr Sweater\'s been speaking to me\r\nabout it.  It seems that when he was over in Paris some time since he\r\nsaw a room that took his fancy.  The walls and ceiling was not papered,\r\nbut painted: you know what I mean; sort of panelled out, and decorated\r\nwith stencils and hand painting.  This \'ere\'s a photer of it: it\'s done\r\nin a sort of JAPANESE fashion.\'\r\n\r\nHe handed the photograph to Owen as he spoke.  It represented a room,\r\nthe walls and ceiling of which were decorated in a Moorish style.\r\n\r\n\'At first Mr Sweater thought of getting a firm from London to do it,\r\nbut \'e gave up the idear on account of the expense; but if you can do\r\nit so that it doesn\'t cost too much, I think I can persuade \'im to go\r\nin for it.  But if it\'s goin\' to cost a lot it won\'t come off at all.\r\n\'E\'ll just \'ave a frieze put up and \'ave the room papered in the\r\nordinary way.\'\r\n\r\nThis was not true: Rushton said it in case Owen might want to be paid\r\nextra wages while doing the work.  The truth was that Sweater was going\r\nto have the room decorated in any case, and intended to get a London\r\nfirm to do it.  He had consented rather unwillingly to let Rushton &\r\nCo. submit him an estimate, because he thought they would not be able\r\nto do the work satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nOwen examined the photograph closely.\r\n\r\n\'Could you do anything like that in that room?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think so,\' replied Owen.\r\n\r\n\'Well, you know, I don\'t want you to start on the job and not be able\r\nto finish it.  Can you do it or not?\'\r\n\r\nRushton felt sure that Owen could do it, and was very desirous that he\r\nshould undertake it, but he did not want him to know that.  He wished\r\nto convey the impression that he was almost indifferent whether Owen\r\ndid the work or not.  In fact, he wished to seem to be conferring a\r\nfavour upon him by procuring him such a nice job as this.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tell you what I CAN do,\' Owen replied.  \'I can make you a\r\nwatercolour sketch--a design--and if you think it good enough, of\r\ncourse, I can reproduce it on the ceiling and the walls, and I can let\r\nyou know, within a little, how long it will take.\'\r\n\r\nRushton appeared to reflect.  Owen stood examining the photograph and\r\nbegan to feel an intense desire to do the work.\r\n\r\nRushton shook his head dubiously.\r\n\r\n\'If I let you spend a lot of time over the sketches and then Mr Sweater\r\ndoes not approve of your design, where do I come in?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, suppose we put it like this: I\'ll draw the design at home in the\r\nevenings--in my own time.  If it\'s accepted, I\'ll charge you for the\r\ntime I\'ve spent upon it.  If it\'s not suitable, I won\'t charge the time\r\nat all.\'\r\n\r\nRushton brightened up considerably.  \'All right.  You can do so,\' he\r\nsaid with an affectation of good nature, \'but you mustn\'t pile it on\r\ntoo thick, in any case, you know, because, as I said before, \'e don\'t\r\nwant to spend too much money on it.  In fact, if it\'s going to cost a\r\ngreat deal \'e simply won\'t \'ave it done at all.\'\r\n\r\nRushton knew Owen well enough to be sure that no consideration of time\r\nor pains would prevent him from putting the very best that was in him\r\ninto this work.  He knew that if the man did the room at all there was\r\nno likelihood of his scamping it for the sake of getting it done\r\nquickly; and for that matter Rushton did not wish him to hurry over it.\r\nAll that he wanted to do was to impress upon Owen from the very first\r\nthat he must not charge too much time.  Any profit that it was possible\r\nto make out of the work, Rushton meant to secure for himself. He was a\r\nsmart man, this Rushton, he possessed the ideal character: the kind of\r\ncharacter that is necessary for any man who wishes to succeed in\r\nbusiness--to get on in life.  In other words, his disposition was very\r\nsimilar to that of a pig--he was intensely selfish.\r\n\r\nNo one had any right to condemn him for this, because all who live\r\nunder the present system practise selfishness, more or less.  We must\r\nbe selfish: the System demands it.  We must be selfish or we shall be\r\nhungry and ragged and finally die in the gutter.  The more selfish we\r\nare the better off we shall be.  In the \'Battle of Life\' only the\r\nselfish and cunning are able to survive: all others are beaten down and\r\ntrampled under foot.  No one can justly be blamed for acting\r\nselfishly--it is a matter of self-preservation--we must either injure\r\nor be injured.  It is the system that deserves to be blamed. What those\r\nwho wish to perpetuate the system deserve is another question.\r\n\r\n\'When do you think you\'ll have the drawings ready?\' inquired Rushton.\r\n\'Can you get them done tonight?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid not,\' replied Owen, feeling inclined to laugh at the\r\nabsurdity of the question.  \'It will need a little thinking about.\'\r\n\r\n\'When can you have them ready then?  This is Monday.  Wednesday\r\nmorning?\'\r\n\r\nOwen hesitated.\r\n\r\n\'We don\'t want to keep \'im waiting too long, you know, or \'e may give\r\nup the idear altogether.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, say Friday morning, then,\' said Owen, resolving that he would\r\nstay up all night if necessary to get it done.\r\n\r\nRushton shook his head.\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t you get it done before that?  I\'m afraid that if we keeps \'im\r\nwaiting all that time we may lose the job altogether.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t get them done any quicker in my spare time,\' returned Owen,\r\nflushing.  \'If you like to let me stay home tomorrow and charge the\r\ntime the same as if I had gone to work at the house, I could go to my\r\nordinary work on Wednesday and let you have the drawings on Thursday\r\nmorning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, all right,\' said Rushton as he returned to the perusal of his\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nThat night, long after his wife and Frankie were asleep, Owen worked in\r\nthe sitting-room, searching through old numbers of the Decorators\'\r\nJournal and through the illustrations in other books of designs for\r\nexamples of Moorish work, and making rough sketches in pencil.\r\n\r\nHe did not attempt to finish anything yet: it was necessary to think\r\nfirst; but he roughed out the general plan, and when at last he did go\r\nto bed he could not sleep for a long time.  He almost fancied he was in\r\nthe drawing-room at the \'Cave\'.  First of all it would be necessary to\r\ntake down the ugly plaster centre flower with its crevices all filled\r\nup with old whitewash.  The cornice was all right; it was fortunately a\r\nvery simple one, with a deep cove and without many enrichments.  Then,\r\nwhen the walls and the ceiling had been properly prepared, the\r\nornamentation would be proceeded with.  The walls, divided into panels\r\nand arches containing painted designs and lattice-work; the panels of\r\nthe door decorated in a similar manner. The mouldings of the door and\r\nwindow frames picked out with colours and gold so as to be in character\r\nwith the other work; the cove of the cornice, a dull yellow with a bold\r\nornament in colour--gold was not advisable in the hollow because of the\r\nunequal distribution of the light, but some of the smaller mouldings of\r\nthe cornice should be gold.  On the ceiling there would be one large\r\npanel covered with an appropriate design in gold and colours and\r\nsurrounded by a wide margin or border.  To separate this margin from\r\nthe centre panel there would be a narrow border, and another\r\nborder--but wider--round the outer edge of the margin, where the\r\nceiling met the cornice.  Both these borders and the margin would be\r\ncovered with ornamentation in colour and gold.  Great care would be\r\nnecessary when deciding what parts were to be gilded because--whilst\r\nlarge masses of gilding are apt to look garish and in bad taste--a lot\r\nof fine gold lines are ineffective, especially on a flat surface, where\r\nthey do not always catch the light.  Process by process he traced the\r\nwork, and saw it advancing stage by stage until, finally, the large\r\napartment was transformed and glorified.  And then in the midst of the\r\npleasure he experienced in the planning of the work there came the fear\r\nthat perhaps they would not have it done at all.\r\n\r\nThe question, what personal advantage would he gain never once occurred\r\nto Owen.  He simply wanted to do the work; and he was so fully occupied\r\nwith thinking and planning how it was to be done that the question of\r\nprofit was crowded out.\r\n\r\nBut although this question of what profit could be made out of the work\r\nnever occurred to Owen, it would in due course by fully considered by\r\nMr Rushton.  In fact, it was the only thing about the work that Mr\r\nRushton would think of at all: how much money could be made out of it.\r\nThis is what is meant by the oft-quoted saying, \'The men work with\r\ntheir hands--the master works with his brains.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nThe Letting of the Room\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that when the men separated, Owen going to the\r\noffice to see Rushton, and the others on their several ways, Easton and\r\nSlyme went together.\r\n\r\nDuring the day Easton had found an opportunity of speaking to him about\r\nthe bedroom.  Slyme was about to leave the place where he was at\r\npresent lodging, and he told Easton that although he had almost decided\r\non another place he would take a look at the room.  At Easton\'s\r\nsuggestion they arranged that Slyme was to accompany him home that\r\nnight.  As the former remarked, Slyme could come to see the place, and\r\nif he didn\'t like it as well as the other he was thinking of taking,\r\nthere was no harm done.\r\n\r\nRuth had contrived to furnish the room.  Some of the things she had\r\nobtained on credit from a second-hand furniture dealer.  Exactly how\r\nshe had managed, Easton did not know, but it was done.\r\n\r\n\'This is the house,\' said Easton.  As they passed through, the gate\r\ncreaked loudly on its hinges and then closed of itself rather noisily.\r\n\r\nRuth had just been putting the child to sleep and she stood up as they\r\ncame in, hastily fastening the bodice of her dress as she did so.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve brought a gentleman to see you,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\nAlthough she knew that he was looking out for someone for the room,\r\nRuth had not expected him to bring anyone home in this sudden manner,\r\nand she could not help wishing that he had told her beforehand of his\r\nintention.  It being Monday, she had been very busy all day and she was\r\nconscious that she was rather untidy in her appearance.  Her long brown\r\nhair was twisted loosely into a coil behind her head.  She blushed in\r\nan embarrassed way as the young man stared at her.\r\n\r\nEaston introduced Slyme by name and they shook hands; and then at\r\nRuth\'s suggestion Easton took a light to show him the room, and while\r\nthey were gone Ruth hurriedly tidied her hair and dress.\r\n\r\nWhen they came down again Slyme said he thought the room would suit him\r\nvery well.  What were the terms?\r\n\r\nDid he wish to take the room only--just to lodge? inquired Ruth, or\r\nwould he prefer to board as well?\r\n\r\nSlyme intimated that he desired the latter arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn that case she thought twelve shillings a week would be fair.  She\r\nbelieved that was about the usual amount.  Of course that would include\r\nwashing, and if his clothes needed a little mending she would do it for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSlyme expressed himself satisfied with these terms, which were as Ruth\r\nhad said--about the usual ones.  He would take the room, but he was not\r\nleaving his present lodgings until Saturday.  It was therefore agreed\r\nthat he was to bring his box on Saturday evening.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Easton and Ruth stood looking at each other in\r\nsilence.  Ever since this plan of letting the room first occurred to\r\nthem they had been very anxious to accomplish it; and yet, now that it\r\nwas done, they felt dissatisfied and unhappy, as if they had suddenly\r\nexperienced some irreparable misfortune.  In that moment they\r\nremembered nothing of the darker side of their life together.  The hard\r\ntimes and the privations were far off and seemed insignificant beside\r\nthe fact that this stranger was for the future to share their home.  To\r\nRuth especially it seemed that the happiness of the past twelve months\r\nhad suddenly come to an end.  She shrank with involuntary aversion and\r\napprehension from the picture that rose before her of the future in\r\nwhich this intruder appeared the most prominent figure, dominating\r\neverything and interfering with every detail of their home life.  Of\r\ncourse they had known all this before, but somehow it had never seemed\r\nso objectionable as it did now, and as Easton thought of it he was\r\nfilled an unreasonable resentment against Slyme, as if the latter had\r\nforced himself upon them against their will.\r\n\r\n\'Damn him!\' he thought.  \'I wish I\'d never brought him here at all!\'\r\n\r\nRuth did not appear to him to be very happy about it either.\r\n\r\n\'Well?\' he said at last.  \'What do you think of him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, he\'ll be all right, I suppose.\'\r\n\r\n\'For my part, I wish he wasn\'t coming,\' Easton continued.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just what I was thinking,\' replied Ruth dejectedly.  \'I don\'t\r\nlike him at all.  I seemed to turn against him directly he came in the\r\ndoor.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve a good mind to back out of it, somehow, tomorrow,\' exclaimed\r\nEaston after another silence.  \'I could tell him we\'ve unexpectedly got\r\nsome friends coming to stay with us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Ruth eagerly.  \'It would be easy enough to make some excuse\r\nor other.\'\r\n\r\nAs this way of escape presented itself she felt as if a weight had been\r\nlifted from her mind, but almost in the same instant she remembered the\r\nreasons which had at first led them to think of letting the room, and\r\nshe added, disconsolately:\r\n\r\n\'It\'s foolish for us to go on like this, dear.  We must let the room\r\nand it might just as well be him as anyone else.  We must make the best\r\nof it, that\'s all.\'\r\n\r\nEaston stood with his back to the fire, staring gloomily at her.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I suppose that\'s the right way to look at it,\' he replied at\r\nlength.  \'If we can\'t stand it, we\'ll give up the house and take a\r\ncouple of rooms, or a small flat--if we can get one.\'\r\n\r\nRuth agreed, although neither alternative was very inviting.  The\r\nunwelcome alteration in their circumstances was after all not\r\naltogether without its compensations, because from the moment of\r\narriving at this decision their love for each other seemed to be\r\nrenewed and intensified.  They remembered with acute regret that\r\nhitherto they had not always fully appreciated the happiness of that\r\nexclusive companionship of which there now remained to them but one\r\nweek more.  For once the present was esteemed at its proper value,\r\nbeing invested with some of the glamour which almost always envelops\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\nPenal Servitude and Death\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday--the day after his interview with Rushton--Owen remained at\r\nhome working at the drawings.  He did not get them finished, but they\r\nwere so far advanced that he thought he would be able to complete them\r\nafter tea on Wednesday evening.  He did not go to work until after\r\nbreakfast on Wednesday and his continued absence served to confirm the\r\nopinion of the other workmen that he had been discharged. This belief\r\nwas further strengthened by the fact that a new hand had been sent to\r\nthe house by Hunter, who came himself also at about a quarter past\r\nseven and very nearly caught Philpot in the act of smoking.\r\n\r\nDuring breakfast, Philpot, addressing Crass and referring to Hunter,\r\ninquired anxiously:\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow\'s \'is temper this mornin\', Bob?\'\r\n\r\n\'As mild as milk,\' replied Crass.  \'You\'d think butter wouldn\'t melt in\r\n\'is mouth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Seemed quite pleased with \'isself, didn\'t \'e?\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' remarked Newman.  \'\'E said good morning to me!\'\r\n\r\n\'So \'e did to me!\' said Easton.  \'\'E come inter the drorin\'-room an\' \'e\r\nses, "Oh, you\'re in \'ere are yer, Easton," \'e ses--just like that,\r\nquite affable like.  So I ses, "Yes, sir."  "Well," \'e ses, "get it\r\nslobbered over as quick as you can," \'e ses, "\'cos we ain\'t got much\r\nfor this job: don\'t spend a lot of time puttying up.  Just smear it\r\nover an\' let it go!"\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E certinly seemed very pleased about something,\' said Harlow.  \'I\r\nthought prap\'s there was a undertaking job in: one o\' them generally\r\nputs \'im in a good humour.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe that nothing would please \'im so much as to see a epidemic\r\nbreak out,\' remarked Philpot.  \'Small-pox, Hinfluenza, Cholery morbus,\r\nor anything like that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: don\'t you remember \'ow good-tempered \'e was last summer when\r\nthere was such a lot of Scarlet Fever about?\' observed Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Crass with a chuckle.  \'I recollect we \'ad six children\'s\r\nfunerals to do in one week.  Ole Misery was as pleased as Punch,\r\nbecause of course as a rule there ain\'t many boxin\'-up jobs in the\r\nsummer.  It\'s in winter as hundertakers reaps their \'arvest.\'\r\n\r\n\'We ain\'t \'ad very many this winter, though, so far,\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Not so many as usual,\' admitted Crass, \'but still, we can\'t grumble:\r\nwe\'ve \'ad one nearly every week since the beginning of October. That\'s\r\nnot so bad, you know.\'\r\n\r\nCrass took a lively interest in the undertaking department of Rushton &\r\nCo.\'s business.  He always had the job of polishing or varnishing the\r\ncoffin and assisting to take it home and to \'lift in\' the corpse,\r\nbesides acting as one of the bearers at the funeral.  This work was\r\nmore highly paid for than painting.\r\n\r\n\'But I don\'t think there\'s no funeral job in,\' added Crass after a\r\npause.  \'I think it\'s because \'e\'s glad to see the end of Owen, if yeh\r\nask me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Praps that \'as got something to do with it,\' said Harlow.  \'But all\r\nthe same I don\'t call that a proper way to treat anyone--givin\' a man\r\nthe push in that way just because \'e \'appened to \'ave a spite against\r\n\'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s wot I call a bl--dy shame!\' cried Philpot.  \'Owen\'s a chap wots\r\nalways ready to do a good turn to anybody, and \'e knows \'is work,\r\nalthough \'e is a bit of a nuisance sometimes, I must admit, when \'e\r\ngets on about Socialism.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose Misery didn\'t say nothin\' about \'im this mornin\'?\' inquired\r\nEaston.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' replied Crass, and added: \'I only \'ope Owen don\'t think as I\r\nnever said anything against \'im.  \'E looked at me very funny that night\r\nafter Nimrod went away.  Owen needn\'t think nothing like that about ME,\r\nbecause I\'m a chap like this--if I couldn\'t do nobody no good, I\r\nwouldn\'t never do \'em no \'arm!\'\r\n\r\nAt this some of the others furtively exchanged significant glances, and\r\nHarlow began to smile, but no one said anything.\r\n\r\nPhilpot, noticing that the newcomer had not helped himself to any tea,\r\ncalled Bert\'s attention to the fact and the boy filled Owen\'s cup and\r\npassed it over to the new hand.\r\n\r\nTheir conjectures regarding the cause of Hunter\'s good humour were all\r\nwrong.  As the reader knows, Owen had not been discharged at all, and\r\nthere was nobody dead.  The real reason was that, having decided to\r\ntake on another man, Hunter had experienced no difficulty in getting\r\none at the same reduced rate as that which Newman was working for,\r\nthere being such numbers of men out of employment.  Hitherto the usual\r\nrate of pay in Mugsborough had been sevenpence an hour for skilled\r\npainters.  The reader will remember that Newman consented to accept a\r\njob at sixpence halfpenny.  So far none of the other workmen knew that\r\nNewman was working under price: he had told no one, not feeling sure\r\nwhether he was the only one or not.  The man whom Hunter had taken on\r\nthat morning also decided in his mind that he would keep his own\r\ncounsel concerning what pay he was to receive, until he found out what\r\nthe others were getting.\r\n\r\nJust before half past eight Owen arrived and was immediately assailed\r\nwith questions as to what had transpired at the office.  Crass listened\r\nwith ill-concealed chagrin to Owen\'s account, but most of the others\r\nwere genuinely pleased.\r\n\r\n\'But what a way to speak to anybody!\' observed Harlow, referring to\r\nHunter\'s manner on the previous Monday night.\r\n\r\n\'You know, I reckon if ole Misery \'ad four legs, \'e\'d make a very good\r\npig,\' said Philpot, solemnly, \'and you can\'t expect nothin\' from a pig\r\nbut a grunt.\'\r\n\r\nDuring the morning, as Easton and Owen were working together in the\r\ndrawing-room, the former remarked:\r\n\r\n\'Did I tell you I had a room I wanted to let, Frank?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think you did.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ve let it to Slyme.  I think he seems a very decent sort of\r\nchap, don\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I suppose he is,\' replied Owen, hesitatingly.  \'I know nothing\r\nagainst him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course, we\'d rather \'ave the \'ouse to ourselves if we could afford\r\nit, but work is so scarce lately.  I\'ve been figuring out exactly what\r\nmy money has averaged for the last twelve months and how much a week do\r\nyou think it comes to?\'\r\n\r\n\'God only knows,\' said Owen.  \'How much?\'\r\n\r\n\'About eighteen bob.\'\r\n\r\n\'So you see we had to do something,\' continued Easton; \'and I reckon\r\nwe\'re lucky to get a respectable sort of chap like Slyme, religious and\r\nteetotal and all that, you know.  Don\'t you think so?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I suppose you are,\' said Owen, who, although he intensely\r\ndisliked Slyme, knew nothing definite against him.\r\n\r\nThey worked in silence for some time, and then Owen said:\r\n\r\n\'At the present time there are thousands of people so badly off that,\r\ncompared with them, WE are RICH.  Their sufferings are so great that\r\ncompared with them, we may be said to be living in luxury.  You know\r\nthat, don\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s true enough, mate.  We really ought to be very thankful:\r\nwe ought to consider ourselves lucky to \'ave a inside job like this\r\nwhen there\'s such a lot of chaps walkin\' about doin\' nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Owen: \'we\'re lucky!  Although we\'re in a condition of\r\nabject, miserable poverty we must consider ourselves lucky that we\'re\r\nnot actually starving.\'\r\n\r\nOwen was painting the door; Easton was doing the skirting.  This work\r\ncaused no noise, so they were able to converse without difficulty.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think it\'s right for us to tamely make up our minds to live for\r\nthe rest of our lives under such conditions as that?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; certainly not,\' replied Easton; \'but things are sure to get better\r\npresently.  Trade hasn\'t always been as bad as it is now.  Why, you can\r\nremember as well as I can a few years ago there was so much work that\r\nwe was putting in fourteen and sixteen hours a day.  I used to be so\r\ndone up by the end of the week that I used to stay in bed nearly all\r\nday on Sunday.\'\r\n\r\n\'But don\'t you think it\'s worth while trying to find out whether it\'s\r\npossible to so arrange things that we may be able to live like\r\ncivilized human beings without being alternately worked to death or\r\nstarved?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see how we\'re goin\' to alter things,\' answered Easton.  \'At\r\nthe present time, from what I hear, work is scarce everywhere.  WE\r\ncan\'t MAKE work, can we?\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think, then, that the affairs of the world are something like\r\nthe wind or the weather--altogether beyond our control?  And that if\r\nthey\'re bad we can do nothing but just sit down and wait for them to\r\nget better?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t see \'ow we can odds it.  If the people wot\'s got the\r\nmoney won\'t spend it, the likes of me and you can\'t make \'em, can we?\'\r\n\r\nOwen looked curiously at Easton.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose you\'re about twenty-six now,\' he said.  \'That means that you\r\nhave about another thirty years to live.  Of course, if you had proper\r\nfood and clothes and hadn\'t to work more than a reasonable number of\r\nhours every day, there is no natural reason why you should not live for\r\nanother fifty or sixty years: but we\'ll say thirty.  Do you mean to say\r\nthat you are able to contemplate with indifference the prospect of\r\nliving for another thirty years under such conditions as those we\r\nendure at present?\'\r\n\r\nEaston made no reply.\r\n\r\n\'If you were to commit some serious breach of the law, and were\r\nsentenced next week to ten years\' penal servitude, you\'d probably think\r\nyour fate a very pitiable one: yet you appear to submit quite\r\ncheerfully to this other sentence, which is--that you shall die a\r\npremature death after you have done another thirty years\' hard labour.\'\r\n\r\nEaston continued painting the skirting.\r\n\r\n\'When there\'s no work,\' Owen went on, taking another dip of paint as he\r\nspoke and starting on one of the lower panels of the door, \'when\r\nthere\'s no work, you will either starve or get into debt.  When--as at\r\npresent--there is a little work, you will live in a state of\r\nsemi-starvation.  When times are what you call "good", you will work\r\nfor twelve or fourteen hours a day and--if you\'re VERY\r\nlucky--occasionally all night.  The extra money you then earn will go\r\nto pay your debts so that you may be able to get credit again when\r\nthere\'s no work.\'\r\n\r\nEaston put some putty in a crack in the skirting.\r\n\r\n\'In consequence of living in this manner, you will die at least twenty\r\nyears sooner than is natural, or, should you have an unusually strong\r\nconstitution and live after you cease to be able to work, you will be\r\nput into a kind of jail and treated like a criminal for the remainder\r\nof your life.\'\r\n\r\nHaving faced up the cracks, Easton resumed the painting of the skirting.\r\n\r\n\'If it were proposed to make a law that all working men and women were\r\nto be put to death--smothered, or hung, or poisoned, or put into a\r\nlethal chamber--as soon as they reached the age of fifty years, there\r\nis not the slightest doubt that you would join in the uproar of protest\r\nthat would ensue.  Yet you submit tamely to have your life shortened by\r\nslow starvation, overwork, lack of proper boots and clothing, and\r\nthough having often to turn out and go to work when you are so ill that\r\nyou ought to be in bed receiving medical care.\'\r\n\r\nEaston made no reply: he knew that all this was true, but he was not\r\nwithout a large share of the false pride which prompts us to hide our\r\npoverty and to pretend that we are much better off than we really are.\r\nHe was at that moment wearing the pair of second-hand boots that Ruth\r\nhad bought for him, but he had told Harlow--who had passed some remark\r\nabout them--that he had had them for years, wearing them only for best.\r\nHe felt very resentful as he listened to the other\'s talk, and Owen\r\nperceived it, but nevertheless he continued:\r\n\r\n\'Unless the present system is altered, that is all we have to look\r\nforward to; and yet you\'re one of the upholders of the present\r\nsystem--you help to perpetuate it!\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow do I help to perpetuate it?\' demanded Easton.\r\n\r\n\'By not trying to find out how to end it--by not helping those who are\r\ntrying to bring a better state of things into existence.  Even if you\r\nare indifferent to your own fate--as you seem to be--you have no right\r\nto be indifferent to that of the child for whose existence in this\r\nworld you are responsible.  Every man who is not helping to bring about\r\na better state of affairs for the future is helping to perpetuate the\r\npresent misery, and is therefore the enemy of his own children. There\r\nis no such thing as being neutral: we must either help or hinder.\'\r\n\r\nAs Owen opened the door to paint its edge, Bert came along the passage.\r\n\r\n\'Look out!\' he cried, \'Misery\'s comin\' up the road.  \'E\'ll be \'ere in a\r\nminit.\'\r\n\r\nIt was not often that Easton was glad to hear of the approach of\r\nNimrod, but on this occasion he heard Bert\'s message with a sigh of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' added the boy in a whisper to Owen, \'if it comes orf--I mean\r\nif you gets the job to do this room--will you ask to \'ave me along of\r\nyou?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, all right, sonny,\' replied Owen, and Bert went off to warn the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\'Unaware that he had been observed, Nimrod sneaked stealthily into the\r\nhouse and began softly crawling about from room to room, peeping around\r\ncorners and squinting through the cracks of doors, and looking through\r\nkeyholes.  He was almost pleased to see that everybody was very hard at\r\nwork, but on going into Newman\'s room Misery was not satisfied with the\r\nprogress made since his last visit.  The fact was that Newman had been\r\nforgetting himself again this morning.  He had been taking a little\r\npains with the work, doing it something like properly, instead of\r\nscamping and rushing it in the usual way.  The result was that he had\r\nnot done enough.\r\n\r\n\'You know, Newman, this kind of thing won\'t do!\' Nimrod howled.  \'You\r\nmust get over a bit more than this or you won\'t suit me!  If you can\'t\r\nmove yourself a bit quicker I shall \'ave to get someone else.  You\'ve\r\nbeen in this room since seven o\'clock this morning and it\'s dam near\r\ntime you was out of it!\'\r\n\r\nNewman muttered something about being nearly finished now, and Hunter\r\nascended to the next landing--the attics, where the cheap man--Sawkins,\r\nthe labourer--was at work.  Harlow had been taken away from the attics\r\nto go on with some of the better work, so Sawkins was now working\r\nalone.  He had been slogging into it like a Trojan and had done quite a\r\nlot.  He had painted not only the sashes of the window, but also a\r\nlarge part of the glass, and when doing the skirting he had included\r\npart of the floor, sometimes an inch, sometimes half an inch.\r\n\r\nThe paint was of a dark drab colour and the surface of the newly\r\npainted doors bore a strong resemblance to corduroy cloth, and from the\r\nbottom corners of nearly every panel there was trickling down a large\r\ntear, as if the doors were weeping for the degenerate condition of the\r\ndecorative arts.  But these tears caused no throb of pity in the bosom\r\nof Misery: neither did the corduroy-like surface of the work grate upon\r\nhis feelings.  He perceived them not.  He saw only that there was a Lot\r\nof Work done and his soul was filled with rapture as he reflected that\r\nthe man who had accomplished all this was paid only fivepence an hour.\r\nAt the same time it would never do to let Sawkins know that he was\r\nsatisfied with the progress made, so he said:\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want you to stand too much over this up \'ere, you know,\r\nSawkins.  Just mop it over anyhow, and get away from it as quick as you\r\ncan.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, sir,\' replied Sawkins, wiping the sweat from his brow as\r\nMisery began crawling downstairs again.\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s Harlow go to, then?\' he demanded of Philpot.  \'\'E wasn\'t \'ere\r\njust now, when I came up.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E\'s gorn downstairs, sir, out the back,\' replied Joe, jerking his\r\nthumb over his shoulder and winking at Hunter.  \'\'E\'ll be back in \'arf\r\na mo.\'  And indeed at that moment Harlow was just coming upstairs again.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere, we can\'t allow this kind of thing in workin\' hours, you know.\'\r\nHunter bellowed.  \'There\'s plenty of time for that in the dinner hour!\'\r\n\r\nNimrod now went down to the drawing-room, which Easton and Owen had\r\nbeen painting.  He stood here deep in thought for some time, mentally\r\ncomparing the quantity of work done by the two men in this room with\r\nthat done by Sawkins in the attics.  Misery was not a painter himself:\r\nhe was a carpenter, and he thought but little of the difference in the\r\nquality of the work: to him it was all about the same: just plain\r\npainting.\r\n\r\n\'I believe it would pay us a great deal better,\' he thought to himself,\r\n\'if we could get hold of a few more lightweights like Sawkins.\'  And\r\nwith his mind filled with this reflection he shortly afterwards sneaked\r\nstealthily from the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\nThree Children. The Wages of Intelligence\r\n\r\n\r\nOwen spent the greater part of the dinner hour by himself in the\r\ndrawing-room making pencil sketches in his pocket-book and taking\r\nmeasurements.  In the evening after leaving off, instead of going\r\nstraight home as usual he went round to the Free Library to see if he\r\ncould find anything concerning Moorish decorative work in any of the\r\nbooks there.  Although it was only a small and ill-equipped institution\r\nhe was rewarded by the discovery of illustrations of several examples\r\nof which he made sketches.  After about an hour spent this way, as he\r\nwas proceeding homewards he observed two children--a boy and a\r\ngirl--whose appearance seemed familiar.  They were standing at the\r\nwindow of a sweetstuff shop examining the wares exposed therein.  As\r\nOwen came up the children turned round and they recognized each other\r\nsimultaneously.  They were Charley and Elsie Linden.  Owen spoke to\r\nthem as he drew near and the boy appealed to him for his opinion\r\nconcerning a dispute they had been having.\r\n\r\n\'I say, mister.  Which do you think is the best: a fardensworth of\r\neverlasting stickjaw torfee, or a prize packet?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d rather have a prize packet,\' replied Owen, unhesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\'There!  I told you so!\' cried Elsie, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t care.  I\'d sooner \'ave the torfee,\' said Charley,\r\ndoggedly.\r\n\r\n\'Why, can\'t you agree which of the two to buy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, it\'s not that,\' replied Elsie.  \'We was only just SUPPOSING\r\nwhat we\'d buy if we \'ad a fardin; but we\'re not really goin\' to buy\r\nnothing, because we ain\'t got no money.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I see,\' said Owen.  \'But I think _I_ have some money,\' and putting\r\nhis hand into his pocket he produced two halfpennies and gave one to\r\neach of the children, who immediately went in to buy the toffee and the\r\nprize packet, and when they came out he walked along with them, as they\r\nwere going in the same direction as he was: indeed, they would have to\r\npass by his house.\r\n\r\n\'Has your grandfather got anything to do yet?\' he inquired as they went\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\'No.  \'E\'s still walkin\' about, mister,\' replied Charley.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Owen\'s door he invited them to come up to see the\r\nkitten, which they had been inquiring about on the way.  Frankie was\r\ndelighted with these two visitors, and whilst they were eating some\r\nhome-made cakes that Nora gave them, he entertained them by displaying\r\nthe contents of his toy box, and the antics of the kitten, which was\r\nthe best toy of all, for it invented new games all the time: acrobatic\r\nperformances on the rails of chairs; curtain climbing; running slides\r\nup and down the oilcloth; hiding and peeping round corners and under\r\nthe sofa.  The kitten cut so many comical capers, and in a little while\r\nthe children began to create such an uproar, that Nora had to interfere\r\nlest the people in the flat underneath should be annoyed.\r\n\r\nHowever, Elsie and Charley were not able to stay very long, because\r\ntheir mother would be anxious about them, but they promised to come\r\nagain some other day to play with Frankie.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m going to \'ave a prize next Sunday at our Sunday School,\' said\r\nElsie as they were leaving.\r\n\r\n\'What are you going to get it for?\' asked Nora.\r\n\r\n\'\'Cause I learned my text properly.  I had to learn the whole of the\r\nfirst chapter of Matthew by heart and I never made one single mistake!\r\nSo teacher said she\'d give me a nice book next Sunday.\'\r\n\r\n\'I \'ad one too, the other week, about six months ago, didn\'t I, Elsie?\'\r\nsaid Charley.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Elsie and added: \'Do they give prizes at your Sunday\r\nSchool, Frankie?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t go to Sunday School.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ain\'t you never been?\' said Charley in a tone of surprise.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' replied Frankie.  \'Dad says I have quite enough of school all the\r\nweek.\'\r\n\r\n\'You ought to come to ours, man!\' urged Charley.  \'It\'s not like being\r\nin school at all!  And we \'as a treat in the summer, and prizes and\r\nsometimes a magic lantern \'tainment.  It ain\'t \'arf all right, I can\r\ntell you.\'\r\n\r\nFrankie looked inquiringly at his mother.\r\n\r\n\'Might I go, Mum?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, if you like, dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I don\'t know the way.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s not far from \'ere,\' cried Charley.  \'We \'as to pass by your\r\n\'ouse when we\'re goin\', so I\'ll call for you on Sunday if you like.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s only just round in Duke Street; you know, the "Shining Light\r\nChapel",\' said Elsie.  \'It commences at three o\'clock.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Nora.  \'I\'ll have Frankie ready at a quarter to\r\nthree.  But now you must run home as fast as you can.  Did you like\r\nthose cakes?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, thank you very much,\' answered Elsie.\r\n\r\n\'Not \'arf!\' said Charley.\r\n\r\n\'Does your mother make cakes for you sometimes?\'\r\n\r\n\'She used to, but she\'s too busy now, making blouses and one thing and\r\nanother,\' Elsie answered.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose she hasn\'t much time for cooking,\' said Nora, \'so I\'ve\r\nwrapped up some more of those cakes in this parcel for you to take home\r\nfor tomorrow.  I think you can manage to carry it all right, can\'t you,\r\nCharley?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think I\'d better carry it myself,\' said Elsie.  \'Charley\'s SO\r\ncareless, he\'s sure to lose some of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t no more careless than you are,\' cried Charley, indignantly.\r\n\'What about the time you dropped the quarter of butter you was sent for\r\nin the mud?\'\r\n\r\n\'That wasn\'t carelessness: that was an accident, and it wasn\'t butter\r\nat all: it was margarine, so there!\'\r\n\r\nEventually it was arranged that they were to carry the parcel in turns,\r\nElsie to have first innings.  Frankie went downstairs to the front door\r\nwith them to see them off, and as they went down the street he shouted\r\nafter them:\r\n\r\n\'Mind you remember, next Sunday!\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' Charley shouted back.  \'We shan\'t forget.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thursday Owen stayed at home until after breakfast to finish the\r\ndesigns which he had promised to have ready that morning.\r\n\r\nWhen he took them to the office at nine o\'clock, the hour at which he\r\nhad arranged to meet Rushton, the latter had not yet arrived, and he\r\ndid not put in an appearance until half an hour later.  Like the\r\nmajority of people who do brain work, he needed a great deal more rest\r\nthan those who do only mere physical labour.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you\'ve brought them sketches, I suppose,\' he remarked in a surly\r\ntone as he came in.  \'You know, there was no need for you to wait: you\r\ncould \'ave left \'em \'ere and gone on to your job.\'\r\n\r\nHe sat down at his desk and looked carelessly at the drawing that Owen\r\nhanded to him.  It was on a sheet of paper about twenty-four by\r\neighteen inches.  The design was drawn with pencil and one half of it\r\nwas coloured.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s for the ceiling,\' said Owen.  \'I hadn\'t time to colour all of\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\nWith an affectation of indifference, Rushton laid the drawing down and\r\ntook the other which Owen handed to him.\r\n\r\n\'This is for the large wall.  The same design would be adapted for the\r\nother walls; and this one shows the door and the panels under the\r\nwindow.\'\r\n\r\nRushton expressed no opinion about the merits of the drawings.  He\r\nexamined them carelessly one after the other, and then, laying them\r\ndown, he inquired:\r\n\r\n\'How long would it take you to do this work--if we get the job?\'\r\n\r\n\'About three weeks: say 150 hours.  That is--the decorative work only.\r\nOf course, the walls and ceiling would have to be painted first: they\r\nwill need three coats of white.\'\r\n\r\nRushton scribbled a note on a piece of paper.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' he said, after a pause, \'you can leave these \'ere and I\'ll see\r\nMr Sweater about it and tell \'im what it will cost, and if he decides\r\nto have it done I\'ll let you know.\'\r\n\r\nHe put the drawings aside with the air of a man who has other matters\r\nto attend to, and began to open one of the several letters that were on\r\nhis desk.  He meant this as an intimation that the audience was at an\r\nend and that he desired the \'hand\' to retire from the presence. Owen\r\nunderstood this, but he did not retire, because it was necessary to\r\nmention one or two things which Rushton would have to allow for when\r\npreparing the estimate.\r\n\r\n\'Of course I should want some help,\' he said.  \'I should need a man\r\noccasionally, and the boy most of the time.  Then there\'s the gold\r\nleaf--say, fifteen books.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you think it would be possible to use gold paint?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is there anything else?\' inquired Rushton as he finished writing down\r\nthese items.\r\n\r\n\'I think that\'s all, except a few sheets of cartridge paper for\r\nstencils and working drawings.  The quantity of paint necessary for the\r\ndecorative work will be very small.\'\r\n\r\nAs soon as Owen was gone, Rushton took up the designs and examined them\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\'These are all right,\' he muttered.  \'Good enough for anywhere.  If he\r\ncan paint anything like as well as this on the walls and ceiling of the\r\nroom, it will stand all the looking at that anyone in this town is\r\nlikely to give it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s see,\' he continued.  \'He said three weeks, but he\'s so anxious\r\nto do the job that he\'s most likely under-estimated the time; I\'d\r\nbetter allow four weeks: that means about 200 hours: 200 hours at\r\neight-pence: how much is that?  And say he has a painter to help him\r\nhalf the time.  100 hours at sixpence-ha\'penny.\'\r\n\r\nHe consulted a ready reckoner that was on the desk.\r\n\r\n\'Time, L9.7.6.  Materials: fifteen books of gold, say a pound.  Then\r\nthere\'s the cartridge paper and the colours--say another pound, at the\r\noutside.  Boy\'s time?  Well, he gets no wages as yet, so we needn\'t\r\nmention that at all.  Then there\'s the preparing of the room. Three\r\ncoats of white paint.  I wish Hunter was here to give me an idea what\r\nit will cost.\'\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to his wish, Nimrod entered the office at that moment,\r\nand in reply to Rushton\'s query said that to give the walls and ceiling\r\nthree coats of paint would cost about three pounds five for time and\r\nmaterial.  Between them the two brain workers figured that fifteen\r\npounds would cover the entire cost of the work--painting and decorating.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I reckon we can charge Sweater forty-five pounds for it,\' said\r\nRushton.  \'It isn\'t like an ordinary job, you know.  If he gets a\r\nLondon firm to do it, it\'ll cost him double that, if not more.\'\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at this decision, Rushton rung up Sweater\'s Emporium on\r\nthe telephone, and, finding that Mr Sweater was there, he rolled up the\r\ndesigns and set out for that gentleman\'s office.\r\n\r\nThe men work with their hands, and the masters work with their brains.\r\nWhat a dreadful calamity it would be for the world and for mankind if\r\nall these brain workers were to go on strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nThe Undeserving Persons and the Upper and Nether Millstones\r\n\r\n\r\nHunter had taken on three more painters that morning.  Bundy and two\r\nlabourers had commenced the work of putting in the new drains; the\r\ncarpenters were back again doing some extra work, and there was also a\r\nplumber working on the house; so there was quite a little crowd in the\r\nkitchen at dinner-time.  Crass had been waiting for a suitable\r\nopportunity to produce the newspaper cutting which it will be\r\nremembered he showed to Easton on Monday morning, but he had waited in\r\nvain, for there had been scarcely any \'political\' talk at meal-times\r\nall the week, and it was now Thursday.  As far as Owen was concerned,\r\nhis thoughts were so occupied with the designs for the drawing-room\r\nthat he had no time for anything else, and most of the others were only\r\ntoo willing to avoid a subject which frequently led to unpleasantness.\r\nAs a rule Crass himself had no liking for such discussion, but he was\r\nso confident of being able to \'flatten out\' Owen with the cutting from\r\nthe Obscurer that he had several times tried to lead the conversation\r\ninto the desired channel, but so far without success.\r\n\r\nDuring dinner--as they called it--various subjects were discussed.\r\nHarlow mentioned that he had found traces of bugs in one of the\r\nbedrooms upstairs and this called forth a number of anecdotes of those\r\nvermin and of houses infested by them.  Philpot remembered working in a\r\nhouse over at Windley; the people who lived in it were very dirty and\r\nhad very little furniture; no bedsteads, the beds consisting of\r\ndilapidated mattresses and rags on the floor.  He declared that these\r\nragged mattresses used to wander about the rooms by themselves.  The\r\nhouse was so full of fleas that if one placed a sheet of newspaper on\r\nthe floor one could hear and see them jumping on it.  In fact, directly\r\none went into that house one was covered from head to foot with fleas!\r\nDuring the few days he worked at that place, he lost several pounds in\r\nweight, and of evenings as he walked homewards the children and people\r\nin the streets, observing his ravaged countenance, thought he was\r\nsuffering from some disease and used to get out of his way when they\r\nsaw him coming.\r\n\r\nThere were several other of these narratives, four or five men talking\r\nat the top of their voices at the same time, each one telling a\r\ndifferent story.  At first each story-teller addressed himself to the\r\ncompany generally, but after a while, finding it impossible to make\r\nhimself heard, he would select some particular individual who seemed\r\ndisposed to listen and tell him the story.  It sometimes happened that\r\nin the middle of the tale the man to whom it was being told would\r\nremember a somewhat similar adventure of his own, which he would\r\nimmediately proceed to relate without waiting for the other to finish,\r\nand each of them was generally so interested in the gruesome details of\r\nhis own story that he was unconscious of the fact that the other was\r\ntelling one at all.  In a contest of this kind the victory usually went\r\nto the man with the loudest voice, but sometimes a man who had a weak\r\nvoice, scored by repeating the same tale several times until someone\r\nheard it.\r\n\r\nBarrington, who seldom spoke and was an ideal listener, was\r\nappropriated by several men in succession, who each told him a\r\ndifferent yarn.  There was one man sitting on an up-ended pail in the\r\nfar corner of the room and it was evident from the movements of his\r\nlips that he also was relating a story, although nobody knew what it\r\nwas about or heard a single word of it, for no one took the slightest\r\nnotice of him...\r\n\r\nWhen the uproar had subsided Harlow remembered the case of a family\r\nwhose house got into such a condition that the landlord had given them\r\nnotice and the father had committed suicide because the painters had\r\ncome to turn \'em out of house and home.  There were a man, his wife and\r\ndaughter--a girl about seventeen--living in the house, and all three of\r\n\'em used to drink like hell.  As for the woman, she COULD shift it and\r\nno mistake!  Several times a day she used to send the girl with a jug\r\nto the pub at the corner.  When the old man was out, one could have\r\nanything one liked to ask for from either of \'em for half a pint of\r\nbeer, but for his part, said Harlow, he could never fancy it.  They\r\nwere both too ugly.\r\n\r\nThe finale of this tale was received with a burst of incredulous\r\nlaughter by those who heard it.\r\n\r\n\'Do you \'ear what Harlow says, Bob?\' Easton shouted to Crass.\r\n\r\n\'No.  What was it?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E ses \'e once \'ad a chance to \'ave something but \'e wouldn\'t take it\r\non because it was too ugly!\'\r\n\r\n\'If it \'ad bin me, I should \'ave shut me bl--y eyes,\' cried Sawkins. \'I\r\nwouldn\'t pass it for a trifle like that.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Crass amid laughter, \'and you can bet your life \'e didn\'t\r\nlose it neither, although \'e tries to make \'imself out to be so\r\ninnocent.\'\r\n\r\n\'I always though old Harlow was a bl--y liar,\' remarked Bundy, \'but now\r\nwe knows \'e is.\'\r\n\r\nAlthough everyone pretended to disbelieve him, Harlow stuck to his\r\nversion of the story.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not their face you want, you know,\' added Bundy as he helped\r\nhimself to some more tea.\r\n\r\n\'I know it wasn\'t my old woman\'s face that I was after last night,\'\r\nobserved Crass; and then he proceeded amid roars of laughter to give a\r\nminutely detailed account of what had taken place between himself and\r\nhis wife after they had retired for the night.\r\n\r\nThis story reminded the man on the pail of a very strange dream he had\r\nhad a few weeks previously: \'I dreamt I was walkin\' along the top of a\r\n\'igh cliff or some sich place, and all of a sudden the ground give way\r\nunder me feet and I began to slip down and down and to save meself from\r\ngoing over I made a grab at a tuft of grass as was growin\' just within\r\nreach of me \'and.  And then I thought that some feller was \'ittin me on\r\nthe \'ead with a bl--y great stick, and tryin\' to make me let go of the\r\ntuft of grass.  And then I woke up to find my old woman shouting out\r\nand punchin\' me with \'er fists.  She said I was pullin\' \'er \'air!\'\r\n\r\nWhile the room was in an uproar with the merriment induced by these\r\nstories, Crass rose from his seat and crossed over to where his\r\novercoat was hanging on a nail in the wall, and took from the pocket a\r\npiece of card about eight inches by about four inches.  One side of it\r\nwas covered with printing, and as he returned to his seat Crass called\r\nupon the others to listen while he read it aloud.  He said it was one\r\nof the best things he had ever seen: it had been given to him by a\r\nbloke in the Cricketers the other night.\r\n\r\nCrass was not a very good reader, but he was able to read this all\r\nright because he had read it so often that he almost knew it by heart.\r\nIt was entitled \'The Art of Flatulence\', and it consisted of a number\r\nof rules and definitions.  Shouts of laughter greeted the reading of\r\neach paragraph, and when he had ended, the piece of dirty card was\r\nhanded round for the benefit of those who wished to read it for\r\nthemselves.  Several of the men, however, when it was offered to them,\r\nrefused to take it, and with evident disgust suggested that it should\r\nbe put into the fire.  This view did not commend itself to Crass, who,\r\nafter the others had finished with it, put it back in the pocket of his\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bundy stood up to help himself to some more tea.  The cup he\r\nwas drinking from had a large piece broken out of one side and did not\r\nhold much, so he usually had to have three or four helpings.\r\n\r\n\'Anyone else want any\' he asked.\r\n\r\nSeveral cups and jars were passed to him.  These vessels had been\r\nstanding on the floor, and the floor was very dirty and covered with\r\ndust, so before dipping them into the pail, Bundy--who had been working\r\nat the drains all morning--wiped the bottoms of the jars upon his\r\ntrousers, on the same place where he was in the habit of wiping his\r\nhands when he happened to get some dirt on them.  He filled the jars so\r\nfull that as he held them by the rims and passed them to their owners\r\npart of the contents slopped over and trickled through his fingers.  By\r\nthe time he had finished the floor was covered with little pools of tea.\r\n\r\n\'They say that Gord made everything for some useful purpose,\' remarked\r\nHarlow, reverting to the original subject, \'but I should like to know\r\nwhat the hell\'s the use of sich things as bugs and fleas and the like.\'\r\n\r\n\'To teach people to keep theirselves clean, of course,\' said Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a funny subject, ain\'t it?\' continued Harlow, ignoring Slyme\'s\r\nanswer.  \'They say as all diseases is caused by little insects.  If\r\nGord \'adn\'t made no cancer germs or consumption microbes there wouldn\'t\r\nbe no cancer or consumption.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s one of the proofs that there ISN\'T an individual God,\' said\r\nOwen.  \'If we were to believe that the universe and everything that\r\nlives was deliberately designed and created by God, then we must also\r\nbelieve that He made his disease germs you are speaking of for the\r\npurpose of torturing His other creatures.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t tell me a bloody yarn like that,\' interposed Crass, roughly.\r\n\'There\'s a Ruler over us, mate, and so you\'re likely to find out.\'\r\n\r\n\'If Gord didn\'t create the world, \'ow did it come \'ere?\' demanded Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'I know no more about that than you do,\' replied Owen.  \'That is--I\r\nknow nothing.  The only difference between us is that you THINK you\r\nknow.  You think you know that God made the universe; how long it took\r\nHim to do it; why He made it; how long it\'s been in existence and how\r\nit will finally pass away.  You also imagine you know that we shall\r\nlive after we\'re dead; where we shall go, and the kind of existence we\r\nshall have.  In fact, in the excess of your "humility", you think you\r\nknow all about it.  But really you know no more of these things than\r\nany other human being does; that is, you know NOTHING.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s only YOUR opinion,\' said Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'If we care to take the trouble to learn,\' Owen went on, \'we can know a\r\nlittle of how the universe has grown and changed; but of the beginning\r\nwe know nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just my opinion, matey,\' observed Philpot.  \'It\'s just a bloody\r\nmystery, and that\'s all about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t pretend to \'ave no \'ead knowledge,\' said Slyme, \'but \'ead\r\nknowledge won\'t save a man\'s soul: it\'s \'EART knowledge as does that. I\r\nknows in my \'eart as my sins is all hunder the Blood, and it\'s knowin\'\r\nthat, wot\'s given \'appiness and the peace which passes all\r\nunderstanding to me ever since I\'ve been a Christian.\'\r\n\r\n\'Glory, glory, hallelujah!\' shouted Bundy, and nearly everyone laughed.\r\n\r\n\'"Christian" is right,\' sneered Owen.  \'You\'ve got some title to call\r\nyourself a Christian, haven\'t you?  As for the happiness that passes\r\nall understanding, it certainly passes MY understanding how you can be\r\nhappy when you believe that millions of people are being tortured in\r\nHell; and it also passes my understanding why you are not ashamed of\r\nyourself for being happy under such circumstances.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, well, you\'ll find it all out when you come to die, mate,\' replied\r\nSlyme in a threatening tone.  \'You\'ll think and talk different then!\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just wot gets over ME,\' observed Harlow.  \'It don\'t  seem right\r\nthat after living in misery and poverty all our bloody lives, workin\'\r\nand slavin\' all the hours that Gord A\'mighty sends, that we\'re to be\r\nbloody well set fire and burned in \'ell for all eternity!  It don\'t\r\nseem feasible to me, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s my belief,\' said Philpot, profoundly, \'that when you\'re dead,\r\nyou\'re done for.  That\'s the end of you.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s what _I_ say,\' remarked Easton.  \'As for all this religious\r\nbusiness, it\'s just a money-making dodge.  It\'s the parson\'s trade,\r\njust the same as painting is ours, only there\'s no work attached to it\r\nand the pay\'s a bloody sight better than ours is.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s their livin\', and a bloody good livin\' too, if you ask me,\' said\r\nBundy.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Harlow; \'they lives on the fat o\' the land, and wears the\r\nbest of everything, and they does nothing for it but talk a lot of\r\ntwaddle two or three times a week.  The rest of the time they spend\r\ncadgin\' money orf silly old women who thinks it\'s a sorter fire\r\ninsurance.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s an old sayin\' and a true one,\' chimed in the man on the upturned\r\npail.  \'Parsons and publicans is the worst enemies the workin\' man ever\r\n\'ad.  There may be SOME good \'uns, but they\'re few and far between.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I could only get a job like the Harchbishop of Canterbury,\' said\r\nPhilpot, solemnly, \'I\'d leave this firm.\'\r\n\r\n\'So would I,\' said Harlow, \'if I was the Harchbishop of Canterbury, I\'d\r\ntake my pot and brushes down the office and shy \'em through the bloody\r\nwinder and tell ole Misery to go to \'ell.\'\r\n\r\n\'Religion is a thing that don\'t trouble ME much,\' remarked Newman; \'and\r\nas for what happens to you after death, it\'s a thing I believe in\r\nleavin\' till you comes to it--there\'s no sense in meetin\' trouble\r\n\'arfway.  All the things they tells us may be true or they may not, but\r\nit takes me all my time to look after THIS world.  I don\'t believe I\'ve\r\nbeen to church more than arf a dozen times since I\'ve been\r\nmarried--that\'s over fifteen years ago now--and then it\'s been when the\r\nkids \'ave been christened.  The old woman goes sometimes and of course\r\nthe young \'uns goes; you\'ve got to tell \'em something or other, and\r\nthey might as well learn what they teaches at the Sunday School as\r\nanything else.\'\r\n\r\nA general murmur of approval greeted this.  It seemed to be the almost\r\nunanimous opinion, that, whether it were true or not, \'religion\' was a\r\nnice thing to teach children.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve not been even once since I was married,\' said Harlow, \'and I\r\nsometimes wish to Christ I \'adn\'t gorn then.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see as it matters a dam wot a man believes,\' said Philpot, \'as\r\nlong as you don\'t do no \'arm to nobody.  If you see a poor b--r wot\'s\r\ndown on \'is luck, give \'im a \'elpin\' \'and.  Even if you ain\'t got no\r\nmoney you can say a kind word.  If a man does \'is work and looks arter\r\n\'is \'ome and \'is young \'uns, and does a good turn to a fellow creature\r\nwhen \'e can, I reckon \'e stands as much chance of getting into\r\n\'eaven--if there IS sich a place--as some of there \'ere Bible-busters,\r\nwhether \'e ever goes to church or chapel or not.\'\r\n\r\nThese sentiments were echoed by everyone with the solitary exception of\r\nSlyme, who said that Philpot would find out his mistake after he was\r\ndead, when he would have to stand before the Great White Throne for\r\njudgement!\r\n\r\n\'And at the Last Day, when yer sees the moon turned inter Blood, you\'ll\r\nbe cryin\' hout for the mountings and the rocks to fall on yer and \'ide\r\nyer from the wrath of the Lamb!\'\r\n\r\nThe others laughed derisively.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m a Bush Baptist meself,\' remarked the man on the upturned pail.\r\nThis individual, Dick Wantley by name, was of what is usually termed a\r\n\'rugged\' cast of countenance.  He reminded one strongly of an ancient\r\ngargoyle, or a dragon.\r\n\r\nMost of the hands had by now lit their pipes, but there were a few who\r\npreferred chewing their tobacco.  As they smoked or chewed they\r\nexpectorated upon the floor or into the fire.  Wantley was one of those\r\nwho preferred chewing and he had been spitting upon the floor to such\r\nan extent that he was by this time partly surrounded by a kind of\r\nsemicircular moat of dark brown spittle.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m a Bush Baptist!\' he shouted across the moat, \'and you all knows\r\nwot that is.\'\r\n\r\nThis confession of faith caused a fresh outburst of hilarity, because\r\nof course everyone knew what a Bush Baptist was.\r\n\r\n\'If \'evven\'s goin\' to be full of sich b--r\'s as Hunter,\' observed\r\nEaton, \'I think I\'d rather go to the other place.\'\r\n\r\n\'If ever ole Misery DOES get into \'eaven,\' said Philpot, \'\'e won\'t stop\r\nthere very long.  I reckon \'e\'ll be chucked out of it before \'e\'s been\r\nthere a week, because \'e\'s sure to start pinchin\' the jewels out of the\r\nother saints\' crowns.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, if they won\'t \'ave \'im in \'eaven, I\'m sure I don\'t know wot\'s to\r\nbecome of \'im,\' said Harlow with pretended concern, \'because I don\'t\r\nbelieve \'e\'d be allowed into \'ell, now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\' demanded Bundy.  \'I should think it\'s just the bloody place\r\nfor sich b--r\'s as \'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'So it used to be at one time o\' day, but they\'ve changed all that now.\r\nThey\'ve \'ad a revolution down there: deposed the Devil, elected a\r\nparson as President, and started puttin\' the fire out.\'\r\n\r\n\'From what I hears of it,\' continued Harlow when the laughter had\r\nceased, \'\'ell is a bloody fine place to live in just now.  There\'s\r\nunderground railways and \'lectric trams, and at the corner of nearly\r\nevery street there\'s a sort of pub where you can buy ice-cream, lemon\r\nsquash, four ale, and American cold drinks; and you\'re allowed to sit\r\nin a refrigerator for two hours for a tanner.\'\r\n\r\nAlthough they laughed and made fun of these things the reader must not\r\nthink that they really doubted the truth of the Christian religion,\r\nbecause--although they had all been brought up by \'Christian\' parents\r\nand had been \'educated\' in \'Christian\' schools--none of them knew\r\nenough about Christianity to either really believe it or disbelieve it.\r\nThe imposters who obtain a comfortable living by pretending to be the\r\nministers and disciples of the Workman of Nazareth are too cunning to\r\nencourage their dupes to acquire anything approaching an intelligent\r\nunderstanding of the subject.  They do not want people to know or\r\nunderstand anything: they want them to have Faith--to believe without\r\nknowledge, understanding, or evidence.  For years Harlow and his\r\nmates--when children--had been \'taught\' \'Christianity\' in day school,\r\nSunday School and in church or chapel, and now they knew practically\r\nnothing about it!  But they were \'Christians\' all the same.  They\r\nbelieved that the Bible was the word of God, but they didn\'t know where\r\nit came from, how long it had been in existence, who wrote it, who\r\ntranslated it or how many different versions there were. Most of them\r\nwere almost totally unacquainted with the contents of the book itself.\r\nBut all the same, they believed it--after a fashion.\r\n\r\n\'But puttin\' all jokes aside,\' said Philpot, \'I can\'t believe there\'s\r\nsich a place as \'ell.  There may be some kind of punishment, but I\r\ndon\'t believe it\'s a real fire.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor nobody else, what\'s got any sense,\' replied Harlow, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\'I believe as THIS world is \'ell,\' said Crass, looking around with a\r\nphilosophic expression.  This opinion was echoed by most of the others,\r\nalthough Slyme remained silent and Owen laughed.\r\n\r\n\'Wot the bloody \'ell are YOU laughin\' at?\' Crass demanded in an\r\nindignant tone.\r\n\r\n\'I was laughing because you said you think this world is hell.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t see nothing to laugh at in that,\' said Crass.\r\n\r\n\'So it IS a \'ell,\' said Easton.  \'There can\'t be anywheres much worse\r\nthan this.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' said the man behind the moat.\r\n\r\n\'What I was laughing at is this,\' said Owen.  \'The present system of\r\nmanaging the affairs of the world is so bad and has produced such\r\ndreadful results that you are of the opinion that the earth is a hell:\r\nand yet you are a Conservative!  You wish to preserve the present\r\nsystem--the system which has made the world into a hell!\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought we shouldn\'t get through the dinner hour without politics if\r\nOwen was \'ere,\' growled Bundy.  \'Bloody sickenin\' I call it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be \'ard on \'im,\' said Philpot.  \'\'E\'s been very quiet for the\r\nlast few days.\'\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll \'ave to go through it today, though,\' remarked Harlow\r\ndespairingly.  \'I can see it comin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'M not goin\' through it,\' said Bundy, \'I\'m orf!\'  And he accordingly\r\ndrank the remainder of his tea, closed his empty dinner basket and,\r\nhaving placed it on the mantelshelf, made for the door.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll leave you to it,\' he said as he went out.  The others laughed.\r\n\r\nCrass, remembering the cutting from the Obscurer that he had in his\r\npocket, was secretly very pleased at the turn the conversation was\r\ntaking.  He turned roughly on Owen:\r\n\r\n\'The other day, when we was talkin\' about the cause of poverty, you\r\ncontradicted everybody.  Everyone else was wrong!  But you yourself\r\ncouldn\'t tell us what\'s the cause of poverty, could you?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think I could.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, of course, you think you know,\' sneered Crass, \'and of course you\r\nthink your opinion\'s right and everybody else\'s is wrong.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Owen.\r\n\r\nSeveral men expressed their abhorrence of this intolerant attitude of\r\nOwen\'s, but the latter rejoined:\r\n\r\n\'Of course I think that my opinions are right and that everyone who\r\ndiffers from me is wrong.  If I didn\'t think their opinions were wrong\r\nI wouldn\'t differ from them.  If I didn\'t think my own opinions right I\r\nwouldn\'t hold them.\'\r\n\r\n\'But there\'s no need to keep on arguin\' about it day after day,\' said\r\nCrass.  \'You\'ve got your opinion and I\'ve got mine.  Let everyone enjoy\r\nhis own opinion, I say.\'\r\n\r\nA murmur of approbation from the crowd greeted these sentiments; but\r\nOwen rejoined:\r\n\r\n\'But we can\'t both be right; if your opinions are right and mine are\r\nnot, how am I to find out the truth if we never talk about them?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, wot do you reckon is the cause of poverty, then?\' demanded\r\nEaston.\r\n\r\n\'The present system--competition--capitalism.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all very well to talk like that,\' snarled Crass, to whom this\r\nstatement conveyed no meaning whatever.  \'But \'ow do you make it out?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I put it like that for the sake of shortness,\' replied Owen.\r\n\'Suppose some people were living in a house--\'\r\n\r\n\'More supposin\'!\' sneered Crass.\r\n\r\n\'And suppose they were always ill, and suppose that the house was badly\r\nbuilt, the walls so constructed that they drew and retained moisture,\r\nthe roof broken and leaky, the drains defective, the doors and windows\r\nill-fitting and the rooms badly shaped and draughty.  If you were asked\r\nto name, in a word, the cause of the ill-health of the people who lived\r\nthere you would say--the house.  All the tinkering in the world would\r\nnot make that house fit to live in; the only thing to do with it would\r\nbe to pull it down and build another.  Well, we\'re all living in a\r\nhouse called the Money System; and as a result most of us are suffering\r\nfrom a disease called poverty.  There\'s so much the matter with the\r\npresent system that it\'s no good tinkering at it. Everything about it\r\nis wrong and there\'s nothing about it that\'s right.  There\'s only one\r\nthing to be done with it and that is to smash it up and have a\r\ndifferent system altogether.  We must get out of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'It seems to me that that\'s just what you\'re trying to do,\' remanded\r\nHarlow, sarcastically.  \'You seem to be tryin\' to get out of answering\r\nthe question what Easton asked you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes!\' cried Crass, fiercely.  \'Why don\'t you answer the bloody\r\nquestion?  Wot\'s the cause of poverty?\'\r\n\r\n\'What the \'ell\'s the matter with the present system?\' demanded Sawkins.\r\n\r\n\'Ow\'s it goin\' to be altered?\' said Newman.\r\n\r\n\'Wot the bloody \'ell sort of a system do YOU think we ought to \'ave?\'\r\nshouted the man behind the moat.\r\n\r\n\'It can\'t never be altered,\' said Philpot.  \'Human nature\'s human\r\nnature and you can\'t get away from it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind about human nature,\' shouted Crass.  \'Stick to the point.\r\nWot\'s the cause of poverty?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, b--r the cause of poverty!\' said one of the new hands.  \'I\'ve \'ad\r\nenough of this bloody row.\'  And he stood up and prepared to go out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThis individual had two patches on the seat of his trousers and the\r\nbottoms of the legs of that garment were frayed and ragged.  He had\r\nbeen out of work for about six weeks previous to having been taken on\r\nby Rushton & Co.  During most of that time he and his family had been\r\nexisting in a condition of semi-starvation on the earnings of his wife\r\nas a charwoman and on the scraps of food she brought home from the\r\nhouses where she worked.  But all the same, the question of what is the\r\ncause of poverty had no interest for him.\r\n\r\n\'There are many causes,\' answered Owen, \'but they are all part of and\r\ninseparable from the system.  In order to do away with poverty we must\r\ndestroy the causes: to do away with the causes we must destroy the\r\nwhole system.\'\r\n\r\n\'What are the causes, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, money, for one thing.\'\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary assertion was greeted with a roar of merriment, in\r\nthe midst of which Philpot was heard to say that to listen to Owen was\r\nas good as going to a circus.  Money was the cause of poverty!\r\n\r\n\'I always thought it was the want of it!\' said the man with the patches\r\non the seat of his trousers as he passed out of the door.\r\n\r\n\'Other things,\' continued Owen, \'are private ownership of land, private\r\nownership of railways, tramways, gasworks, waterworks, private\r\nownership of factories, and the other means of producing the\r\nnecessaries and comforts of life.  Competition in business--\'\r\n\r\n\'But \'ow do you make it out?\' demanded Crass, impatiently.\r\n\r\nOwen hesitated.  To his mind the thing appeared very clear and simple.\r\nThe causes of poverty were so glaringly evident that he marvelled that\r\nany rational being should fail to perceive them; but at the same time\r\nhe found it very difficult to define them himself.  He could not think\r\nof words that would convey his thoughts clearly to these others who\r\nseemed so hostile and unwilling to understand, and who appeared to have\r\nmade up their minds to oppose and reject whatever he said.  They did\r\nnot know what were the causes of poverty and apparently they did not\r\nWANT to know.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ll try to show you one of the causes,\' he said nervously at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nHe picked up a piece of charred wood that had fallen from the fire and\r\nknelt down and began to draw upon the floor.  Most of the others\r\nregarded him, with looks in which an indulgent, contemptuous kind of\r\ninterest mingled with an air of superiority and patronage.  There was\r\nno doubt, they thought, that Owen was a clever sort of chap: his work\r\nproved that: but he was certainly a little bit mad.\r\n\r\nBy this time Owen had drawn a circle about two feet in diameter. Inside\r\nhe had drawn two squares, one much larger than the other. These two\r\nsquares he filled in solid black with the charcoal.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s it all about?\' asked Crass with a sneer.\r\n\r\n\'Why, can\'t you see?\' said Philpot with a wink.  \'\'E\'s goin\' to do some\r\nconjurin\'!  In a minit \'e\'ll make something pass out o\' one o\' them\r\nsquares into the other and no one won\'t see \'ow it\'s done.\'\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished drawing, Owen remained for a few minutes awkwardly\r\nsilent, oppressed by the anticipation of ridicule and a sense of his\r\ninability to put his thoughts into plain language.  He began to wish\r\nthat he had not undertaken this task.  At last, with an effort, he\r\nbegan to speak in a halting, nervous way:\r\n\r\n                             .......\r\n                          ...       ...\r\n                        ..             ..\r\n                       .       ###       .\r\n                      .        ###        .\r\n                     .                     .\r\n                     .   ###############   .\r\n                    .    ###############    .\r\n                    .    ###############    .\r\n                    .    ###############    .\r\n                     .   ###############   .\r\n                     .   ###############   .\r\n                      .                   .\r\n                       ..               ..\r\n                         ...         ...\r\n                            .........\r\n\r\n\'This circle--or rather the space inside the circle--is supposed to\r\nrepresent England.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I never knowed it was round before,\' jeered Crass.  \'I\'ve heard\r\nas the WORLD is round--\'\r\n\r\n\'I never said it was the shape--I said it was supposed to REPRESENT\r\nEngland.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I see.  I thought we\'d very soon begin supposin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'The two black squares,\' continued Owen, \'represent the people who live\r\nin the country.  The small square represents a few thousand people.\r\nThe large square stands for the remainder--about forty millions--that\r\nis, the majority.\'\r\n\r\n\'We ain\'t sich bloody fools as to think that the largest number is the\r\nminority,\' interrupted Crass.\r\n\r\n\'The greater number of the people represented by the large black square\r\nwork for their living: and in return for their labour they receive\r\nmoney: some more, some less than others.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t think they\'d be sich bloody fools as to work for nothing, do\r\nyou?\' said Newman.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose you think they ought all to get the same wages!\' cried\r\nHarlow.  \'Do you think it\'s right that a scavenger should get as much\r\nas a painter?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not speaking about that at all,\' replied Owen.  \'I\'m trying to\r\nshow you what I think is one of the causes of poverty.\'\r\n\r\n\'Shut up, can\'t you, Harlow,\' remonstrated Philpot, who began to feel\r\ninterested.  \'We can\'t all talk at once.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know we can\'t,\' replied Harlow in an aggrieved tone: \'but \'e takes\r\nsich a \'ell of a time to say wot \'e\'s got to say.  Nobody else can\'t\r\nget a word in edgeways.\'\r\n\r\n\'In order that these people may live,\' continued Owen, pointing to the\r\nlarge black square, \'it is first necessary that they shall have a PLACE\r\nto live in--\'\r\n\r\n\'Well!  I should never a thought it!\' exclaimed the man on the pail,\r\npretending to be much impressed.  The others laughed, and two or three\r\nof them went out of the room, contemptuously remarking to each other in\r\nan audible undertone as they went:\r\n\r\n\'Bloody rot!\'\r\n\r\n\'Wonder wot the bloody \'ell \'e thinks \'e is?  A sort of schoolmaster?\'\r\n\r\nOwen\'s nervousness increased as he continued:\r\n\r\n\'Now, they can\'t live in the air or in the sea.  These people are land\r\nanimals, therefore they must live on the land.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot do yer mean by animals?\' demanded Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'A human bean ain\'t a animal!\' said Crass indignantly.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, we are!\' cried Harlow.  \'Go into any chemist\'s shop you like and\r\nask the bloke, and \'e\'ll tell you--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, blow that!\' interrupted Philpot.  \'Let\'s \'ear wot Owen\'s sayin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'They must live on the land: and that\'s the beginning of the trouble;\r\nbecause--under the present system--the majority of the people have\r\nreally no right to be in the country at all!  Under the present system\r\nthe country belongs to a few--those who are here represented by this\r\nsmall black square.  If it would pay them to do so, and if they felt so\r\ndisposed, these few people have a perfect right--under the present\r\nsystem--to order everyone else to clear out!\r\n\r\n\'But they don\'t do that, they allow the majority to remain in the land\r\non one condition--that is, they must pay rent to the few for the\r\nprivilege of being permitted to live in the land of their birth.  The\r\namount of rent demanded by those who own this country is so large that,\r\nin order to pay it, the greater number of the majority have often to\r\ndeprive themselves and their children, not only of the comforts, but\r\neven the necessaries of life.  In the case of the working classes the\r\nrent absorbs at the lowest possible estimate, about one-third of their\r\ntotal earnings, for it must be remembered that the rent is an expense\r\nthat goes on all the time, whether they are employed or not.  If they\r\nget into arrears when out of work, they have to pay double when they\r\nget employment again.\r\n\r\n\'The majority work hard and live in poverty in order that the minority\r\nmay live in luxury without working at all, and as the majority are\r\nmostly fools, they not only agree to pass their lives in incessant\r\nslavery and want, in order to pay this rent to those who own the\r\ncountry, but they say it is quite right that they should have to do so,\r\nand are very grateful to the little minority for allowing them to\r\nremain in the country at all.\'\r\n\r\nOwen paused, and immediately there arose a great clamour from his\r\nlisteners.\r\n\r\n\'So it IS right, ain\'t it?\' shouted Crass.  \'If you \'ad a \'ouse and let\r\nit to someone, you\'d want your rent, wouldn\'t yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose,\' said Slyme with resentment, for he had some shares in a\r\nlocal building society, \'after a man\'s been careful, and scraping and\r\nsaving and going without things he ought to \'ave \'ad all \'is life, and\r\nmanaged to buy a few \'ouses to support \'im in \'is old age--they ought\r\nall to be took away from \'im?  Some people,\' he added, \'ain\'t got\r\ncommon honesty.\'\r\n\r\nNearly everyone had something to say in reprobation of the views\r\nsuggested by Owen.  Harlow, in a brief but powerful speech, bristling\r\nwith numerous sanguinary references to the bottomless pit, protested\r\nagainst any interference with the sacred rights of property.  Easton\r\nlistened with a puzzled expression, and Philpot\'s goggle eyes rolled\r\nhorribly as he glared silently at the circle and the two squares.\r\n\r\n\'By far the greatest part of the land,\' said Owen when the row had\r\nceased, \'is held by people who have absolutely no moral right to it.\r\nPossession of much of it was obtained by means of murder and theft\r\nperpetrated by the ancestors of the present holders.  In other cases,\r\nwhen some king or prince wanted to get rid of a mistress of whom he had\r\ngrown weary, he presented a tract of our country to some \'nobleman\' on\r\ncondition that he would marry the female.  Vast estates were also\r\nbestowed upon the remote ancestors of the present holders in return for\r\nreal or alleged services.  Listen to this,\' he continued as he took a\r\nsmall newspaper cutting from his pocket-book.\r\n\r\nCrass looked at the piece of paper dolefully.  It reminded him of the\r\none he had in his own pocket, which he was beginning to fear that he\r\nwould not have an opportunity of producing today after all.\r\n\r\n\'Ballcartridge Rent Day.\r\n\r\n\'The hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Ballcartridge occurred\r\nyesterday and in accordance with custom the Duke of Ballcartridge\r\nhanded to the authorities the little flag which he annually presents to\r\nthe State in virtue of his tenure of the vast tract of this country\r\nwhich was presented to one of his ancestors--the first Duke--in\r\naddition to his salary, for his services at the battle of Ballcartridge.\r\n\r\n\'The flag--which is the only rent the Duke has to pay for the great\r\nestate which brings him in several hundreds of thousands of pounds per\r\nannum--is a small tricoloured one with a staff surmounted by an eagle.\r\n\r\n\'The Duke of Blankmind also presents the State with a little coloured\r\nsilk flag every year in return for being allowed to retain possession\r\nof that part of England which was presented--in addition to his\r\nsalary--to one of His Grace\'s very remote ancestors, for his services\r\nat the battle of Commissariat--in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n\'The Duke of Southward is another instance,\' continued Owen.  \'He\r\n"owns" miles of the country we speak of as "ours".  Much of his part\r\nconsists of confiscated monastery lands which were stolen from the\r\nowners by King Henry VIII and presented to the ancestors of the present\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n\'Whether it was right or wrong that these parts of our country should\r\never have been given to those people--the question whether those\r\nancestor persons were really deserving cases or not--is a thing we need\r\nnot trouble ourselves about now.  But the present holders are certainly\r\nnot deserving people.  They do not even take the trouble to pretend\r\nthey are.  They have done nothing and they do nothing to justify their\r\npossession of these "estates" as they call them.  And in my opinion no\r\nman who is in his right mind can really think it\'s just that these\r\npeople should be allowed to prey upon their fellow men as they are\r\ndoing now.  Or that it is right that their children should be allowed\r\nto continue to prey upon our children for ever!  The thousands of\r\npeople on those estates work and live in poverty in order that these\r\nthree men and their families may enjoy leisure and luxury.  Just think\r\nof the absurdity of it!\' continued Owen, pointing to the drawings.\r\n\'All those people allowing themselves to be overworked and bullied and\r\nstarved and robbed by this little crowd here!\'\r\n\r\nObserving signs of a renewal of the storm of protests, Owen hurriedly\r\nconcluded:\r\n\r\n\'Whether it\'s right or wrong, you can\'t deny that the fact that this\r\nsmall minority possesses nearly all the land of the country is one of\r\nthe principal causes of the poverty of the majority.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that seems true enough,\' said Easton, slowly.  \'The rent\'s the\r\nbiggest item a workin\' man\'s got to pay.  When you\'re out of work and\r\nyou can\'t afford other things, you goes without \'em, but the rent \'as\r\nto be paid whether you\'re workin\' or not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s true enough,\' said Harlow impatiently; \'but you gets value for\r\nyer money: you can\'t expect to get a \'ouse for nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Suppose we admits as it\'s wrong, just for the sake of argyment,\' said\r\nCrass in a jeering tone.  \'Wot then?  Wot about it?  \'Ow\'s it agoin\' to\r\nbe altered.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes!\' cried Harlow triumphantly.  \'That\'s the bloody question!  \'Ow\'s\r\nit goin\' to be altered?  It can\'t be done!\'\r\n\r\nThere was a general murmur of satisfaction.  Nearly everyone seemed\r\nvery pleased to think that the existing state of things could not\r\npossibly be altered.\r\n\r\n\'Whether it can be altered or not, whether it\'s right or wrong,\r\nlandlordism is one of the causes of poverty,\' Owen repeated.  \'Poverty\r\nis not caused by men and women getting married; it\'s not caused by\r\nmachinery; it\'s not caused by "over-production"; it\'s not caused by\r\ndrink or laziness; and it\'s not caused by "over-population".  It\'s\r\ncaused by Private Monopoly.  That is the present system.  They have\r\nmonopolized everything that it is possible to monopolize; they have got\r\nthe whole earth, the minerals in the earth and the streams that water\r\nthe earth.  The only reason they have not monopolized the daylight and\r\nthe air is that it is not possible to do it.  If it were possible to\r\nconstruct huge gasometers and to draw together and compress within them\r\nthe whole of the atmosphere, it would have been done long ago, and we\r\nshould have been compelled to work for them in order to get money to\r\nbuy air to breathe.  And if that seemingly impossible thing were\r\naccomplished tomorrow, you would see thousands of people dying for want\r\nof air--or of the money to buy it--even as now thousands are dying for\r\nwant of the other necessities of life. You would see people going about\r\ngasping for breath, and telling each other that the likes of them could\r\nnot expect to have air to breathe unless they had the money to pay for\r\nit.  Most of you here, for instance, would think and say so.  Even as\r\nyou think at present that it\'s right for so few people to own the\r\nEarth, the Minerals and the Water, which are all just as necessary as\r\nis the air.  In exactly the same spirit as you now say: "It\'s Their\r\nLand," "It\'s Their Water," "It\'s Their Coal," "It\'s Their Iron," so you\r\nwould say "It\'s Their Air," "These are their gasometers, and what right\r\nhave the likes of us to expect them to allow us to breathe for\r\nnothing?"  And even while he is doing this the air monopolist will be\r\npreaching sermons on the Brotherhood of Man; he will be dispensing\r\nadvice on "Christian Duty" in the Sunday magazines; he will give\r\nutterance to numerous more or less moral maxims for the guidance of the\r\nyoung.  And meantime, all around, people will be dying for want of some\r\nof the air that he will have bottled up in his gasometers.  And when\r\nyou are all dragging out a miserable existence, gasping for breath or\r\ndying for want of air, if one of your number suggests smashing a hole\r\nin the side of one of the gasometers, you will all fall upon him in the\r\nname of law and order, and after doing your best to tear him limb from\r\nlimb, you\'ll drag him, covered with blood, in triumph to the nearest\r\nPolice Station and deliver him up to "justice" in the hope of being\r\ngiven a few half-pounds of air for your trouble.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose you think the landlords ought to let people live in their\r\n\'ouses for nothing?\' said Crass, breaking the silence that followed.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly,\' remarked Harlow, pretending to be suddenly converted to\r\nOwen\'s views, \'I reckon the landlord ought to pay the rent to the\r\ntenant!\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course, Landlordism is not the only cause,\' said Owen, ignoring\r\nthese remarks. \'The wonderful system fosters a great many others.\r\nEmployers of labour, for instance, are as great a cause of poverty as\r\nlandlords are.\'\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary statement was received with astonished silence.\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean to say that if I\'m out of work and a master gives me a\r\njob, that \'e\'s doin\' me a injury?\' said Crass at length.\r\n\r\n\'No, of course not,\' replied Owen.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what the bloody \'ell DO yer mean, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'I mean this: supposing that the owner of a house wishes to have it\r\nrepainted.  What does he usually do?\'\r\n\r\n\'As a rule, \'e goes to three or four master painters and asks \'em to\r\ngive \'im a price for the job.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; and those master painters are so eager to get the work that they\r\ncut the price down to what they think is the lowest possible point,\'\r\nanswered Owen, \'and the lowest usually gets the job.  The successful\r\ntenderer has usually cut the price so fine that to make it pay he has\r\nto scamp the work, pay low wages, and drive and sweat the men whom he\r\nemploys.  He wants them to do two days\' work for one day\'s pay.  The\r\nresult is that a job which--if it were done properly--would employ say\r\ntwenty men for two months, is rushed and scamped in half that time with\r\nhalf that number of men.\r\n\r\n\'This means that--in one such case as this--ten men are deprived of one\r\nmonth\'s employment; and ten other men are deprived of two months\'\r\nemployment; and all because the employers have been cutting each\r\nother\'s throats to get the work.\'\r\n\r\n\'And we can\'t \'elp ourselves, you nor me either,\' said Harlow.\r\n\'Supposing one of us on this job was to make up \'is mind not to tear\r\ninto it like we do, but just keep on steady and do a fair day\'s work:\r\nwot would \'appen?\'\r\n\r\nNo one answered; but the same thought was in everyone\'s mind.  Such a\r\none would be quickly marked by Hunter; and even if the latter failed to\r\nnotice it would not be long before Crass reported his conduct.\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t \'elp ourselves,\' said Easton, gloomily.  \'If one man won\'t do\r\nit there\'s twenty others ready to take \'is place.\'\r\n\r\n\'We could help ourselves to a certain extent if we would stand by each\r\nother.  If, for instance, we all belonged to the Society,\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t believe in the Society,\' observed Crass.  \'I can\'t see as it\'s\r\nright that a inferior man should \'ave the same wages as me.\'\r\n\r\n\'They\'re a drunken lot of beer-swillers,\' remarked Slyme.  \'That\'s why\r\nthey always \'as their meetings in public \'ouses.\'\r\n\r\nHarlow made no comment on this question.  He had at one time belonged\r\nto the Union and he was rather ashamed of having fallen away from it.\r\n\r\n\'Wot good \'as the Society ever done \'ere?\' said Easton.  \'None that I\r\never \'eard of.\'\r\n\r\n\'It might be able to do some good if most of us belonged to it; but\r\nafter all, that\'s another matter.  Whether we could help ourselves or\r\nnot, the fact remains that we don\'t.  But you must admit that this\r\ncompetition of the employers is one of the causes of unemployment and\r\npoverty, because it\'s not only in our line--exactly the same thing\r\nhappens in every other trade and industry.  Competing employers are the\r\nupper and nether millstones which grind the workers between them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose you think there oughtn\'t to be no employers at all?\' sneered\r\nCrass.  \'Or p\'raps you think the masters ought to do all the bloody\r\nwork theirselves, and give us the money?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see \'ow its goin\' to be altered,\' remarked Harlow.  \'There\r\nMUST be masters, and SOMEONE \'as to take charge of the work and do the\r\nthinkin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whether it can be altered or not,\' said Owen, \'Landlordism and\r\nCompeting Employers are two of the causes of poverty.  But of course\r\nthey\'re only a small part of the system which produces luxury,\r\nrefinement and culture for a few, and condemns the majority to a\r\nlifelong struggle with adversity, and many thousands to degradation,\r\nhunger and rags.  This is the system you all uphold and defend,\r\nalthough you don\'t mind admitting that it has made the world into a\r\nhell.\'\r\n\r\nCrass slowly drew the Obscurer cutting from his waistcoat pocket, but\r\nafter a moment\'s thought he replaced it, deciding to defer its\r\nproduction till a more suitable occasion.\r\n\r\n\'But you \'aven\'t told us yet \'ow you makes out that money causes\r\npoverty,\' cried Harlow, winking at the others.  \'That\'s what I\'M\r\nanxious to \'ear about!\'\r\n\r\n\'So am I,\' remarked the man behind the moat.  \'I was just wondering\r\nwhether I \'adn\'t better tell ole Misery that I don\'t want no wages this\r\nweek.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think I\'ll tell \'im on Saterday to keep MY money and get \'imself a\r\nfew drinks with it,\' said Philpot.  \'It might cheer \'im up a bit and\r\nmake \'im a little more sociable and friendly like.\'\r\n\r\n\'Money IS the principal cause of poverty,\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow do yer make it out?\' cried Sawkins.\r\n\r\nBut their curiosity had to remain unsatisfied for the time being\r\nbecause Crass announced that it was \'just on it\'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\nTrue Freedom\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout three o\'clock that afternoon, Rushton suddenly appeared and began\r\nwalking silently about the house, and listening outside the doors of\r\nrooms where the hands were working.  He did not succeed in catching\r\nanyone idling or smoking or talking.  The nearest approach to what the\r\nmen called \'a capture\' that he made was, as he stood outside the door\r\nof one of the upper rooms in which Philpot and Harlow were working, he\r\nheard them singing one of Sankey\'s hymns--\'Work! for the night is\r\ncoming\'.  He listened to two verses and several repetitions of the\r\nchorus.  Being a \'Christian\', he could scarcely object to this,\r\nespecially as by peeping through the partly open door  he could see\r\nthat they were suiting the action to the word.  When he went into the\r\nroom they glanced around to see who it was, and stopped singing.\r\nRushton did not speak, but stood in the middle of the floor, silently\r\nwatching them as they worked, for about a quarter of an hour.  Then,\r\nwithout having uttered a syllable, he turned and went out.\r\n\r\nThey heard him softly descend the stairs, and Harlow, turning to\r\nPhilpot said in a hoarse whisper:\r\n\r\n\'What do you think of the b--r, standing there watchin\' us like that,\r\nas if we was a couple of bloody convicts?  If it wasn\'t that I\'ve got\r\nsomeone else beside myself to think of, I would \'ave sloshed the bloody\r\nsod in the mouth with this pound brush!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; it does make yer feel like that, mate,\' replied Philpot, \'but of\r\ncourse we mustn\'t give way to it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Several times,\' continued Harlow, who was livid with anger, \'I was on\r\nthe point of turnin\' round and sayin\' to \'im, "What the bloody \'ell do\r\nyou mean by standin\' there and watchin\' me, you bloody, psalm-singin\'\r\nswine?"  It took me all my time to keep it in, I can tell you.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rushton was still going about the house, occasionally\r\nstanding and watching the other men in the same manner as he had\r\nwatched Philpot and Harlow.\r\n\r\nNone of the men looked round from their work or spoke either to Rushton\r\nor to each other.  The only sounds heard were the noises made by the\r\nsaws and hammers of the carpenters who were fixing the frieze rails and\r\ndado rails or repairing parts of the woodwork in some of the rooms.\r\n\r\nCrass placed himself in Rushton\'s way several times with the hope of\r\nbeing spoken to, but beyond curtly acknowledging the \'foreman\'s\'\r\nservile \'Good hafternoon, sir,\' the master took no notice of him.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour spent in this manner Rushton went away, but as no\r\none saw him go, it was not until some considerable time after his\r\ndeparture that they knew that he was gone.\r\n\r\nOwen was secretly very disappointed.  \'I thought he had come to tell me\r\nabout the drawing-room,\' he said to himself, \'but I suppose it\'s not\r\ndecided yet.\'\r\n\r\nJust as the \'hands\' were beginning to breathe freely again, Misery\r\narrived, carrying some rolled-up papers in his hand.  He also flitted\r\nsilently from one room to another, peering round corners and listening\r\nat doors in the hope of seeing or hearing something which would give\r\nhim an excuse for making an example of someone.  Disappointed in this,\r\nhe presently crawled upstairs to the room where Owen was working and,\r\nhanding to him the roll of papers he had been carrying, said:\r\n\r\n\'Mr Sweater had decided to \'ave this work done, so you can start on it\r\nas soon as you like.\'\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe, without appearing to exaggerate, the\r\nemotions experienced by Owen as he heard this announcement.  For one\r\nthing it meant that the work at this house would last longer than it\r\nwould otherwise have done; and it also meant that he would be paid for\r\nthe extra time he had spent on the drawings, besides having his wages\r\nincreased--for he was always paid an extra penny an hour when engaged\r\non special work, such as graining or sign-writing or work of the\r\npresent kind.  But these considerations did not occur to him at the\r\nmoment at all, for to him it meant much more.  Since his first\r\nconversation on the subject with Rushton he had though of little else\r\nthan this work.\r\n\r\nIn a sense he had been DOING it ever since.  He had thought and planned\r\nand altered the details of the work repeatedly.  The colours for the\r\ndifferent parts had been selected and rejected and re-selected over and\r\nover again.  A keen desire to do the work had grown within him, but he\r\nhad scarcely allowed himself to hope that it would be done at all.  His\r\nface flushed slightly as he took the drawings from Hunter.\r\n\r\n\'You can make a start on it tomorrow morning,\' continued that\r\ngentleman.  \'I\'ll tell Crass to send someone else up \'ere to finish\r\nthis room.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shan\'t be able to commence tomorrow, because the ceiling and walls\r\nwill have to be painted first.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: I know.  You and Easton can do that.  One coat tomorrow, another\r\non Friday and the third on Saturday--that is, unless you can make it do\r\nwith two coats.  Even if it has to be the three, you will be able to go\r\non with your decoratin\' on Monday.\'\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t be able to start on Monday, because I shall have to make some\r\nworking drawings first.\'\r\n\r\n\'Workin\' drorins!\' ejaculated Misery with a puzzled expression.  \'Wot\r\nworkin\' drorins?  You\'ve got them, ain\'t yer?\' pointing to the roll of\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\'Yes: but as the same ornaments are repeated several times, I shall\r\nhave to make a number of full-sized drawings, with perforated outlines,\r\nto transfer the design to the walls,\' said Owen, and he proceeded to\r\nlaboriously explain the processes.\r\n\r\nNimrod looked at him suspiciously.  \'Is all that really necessary?\' he\r\nasked.  \'Couldn\'t you just copy it on the wall, free-hand?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; that wouldn\'t do.  It would take much longer that way.\'\r\n\r\nThis consideration appealed to Misery.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, well,\' he sighed.  \'I s\'pose you\'ll \'ave to do it the way you\r\nsaid; but for goodness sake don\'t spend too much time over it, because\r\nwe\'ve took it very cheap.  We only took it on so as you could \'ave a\r\njob, not that we expect to make any profit out of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I shall have to cut some stencils, so I shall need several sheets\r\nof cartridge paper.\'\r\n\r\nUpon hearing of this addition expense, Misery\'s long visage appeared to\r\nbecome several inches longer; but after a moment\'s thought he\r\nbrightened up.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tell you what!\' he exclaimed with a cunning leer, \'there\'s lots\r\nof odd rolls of wallpaper down at the shop.  Couldn\'t you manage with\r\nsome of that?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid it wouldn\'t do,\' replied Owen doubtfully, \'but I\'ll have a\r\nlook at it and if possible I\'ll use it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, do!\' said Misery, pleased at the thought of saving something.\r\n\'Call at the shop on your way home tonight, and we\'ll see what we can\r\nfind.  \'Ow long do you think it\'ll take you to make the drorins and the\r\nstencils?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, today\'s Thursday.  If you let someone else help Easton to get\r\nthe room ready, I think I can get them done in time to bring them with\r\nme on Monday morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot do yer mean, "bring them with you"?\' demanded Nimrod.\r\n\r\n\'I shall have to do them at home, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do \'em at \'ome!  Why can\'t you do \'em \'ere?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, there\'s no table, for one thing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but we can soon fit you out with a table. You can \'ave a pair of\r\npaperhanger\'s tressels and boards for that matter.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have a lot of sketches and things at home that I couldn\'t very well\r\nbring here,\' said Owen.\r\n\r\nMisery argued about it for a long time, insisting that the drawings\r\nshould be made either on the \'job\' or at the paint-shop down at the\r\nyard.  How, he asked, was he to know at what hour Owen commenced or\r\nleft off working, if the latter did them at home?\r\n\r\n\'I shan\'t charge any more time than I really work,\' replied Owen.  \'I\r\ncan\'t possibly do them here or at the paint-shop.  I know I should only\r\nmake a mess of them under such conditions.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I s\'pose you\'ll \'ave to \'ave your own way,\' said Misery,\r\ndolefully.  \'I\'ll let Harlow help Easton paint the room out, so as you\r\ncan get your stencils and things ready.  But for Gord\'s sake get \'em\r\ndone as quick as you can.  If you could manage to get done by Friday\r\nand come down and help Easton on Saturday, it would be so much the\r\nbetter.  And when you do get a start on the decoratin\', I shouldn\'t\r\ntake too much care over it, you know, if I was you, because we \'ad to\r\ntake the job for next to nothing or Mr Sweater would never \'ave \'ad it\r\ndone at all!\'\r\n\r\nNimrod now began to crawl about the house, snarling and grumbling at\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\n\'Now then, you chaps.  Rouse yourselves!\' he bellowed, \'you seem to\r\nthink this is a \'orspital.  If some of you don\'t make a better show\r\nthan this, I\'ll \'ave to \'ave a Alteration!  There\'s plenty of chaps\r\nwalkin\' about doin\' nothin\' who\'ll be only too glad of a job!\'\r\n\r\nHe went into the scullery, where Crass was mixing some colour.\r\n\r\n\'Look \'ere, Crass!\' he said.  \'I\'m not at all satisfied with the way\r\nyou\'re gettin\' on with the work.  You must push the chaps a bit more\r\nthan you\'re doin\'.  There\'s not enough being done, by a long way.  We\r\nshall lose money over this job before we\'re finished!\'\r\n\r\nCrass--whose fat face had turned a ghastly green with fright--mumbled\r\nsomething about getting on with it as fast as he could.\r\n\r\n\'Well, you\'ll \'ave to make \'em move a bit quicker than this!\' Misery\r\nhowled, \'or there\'ll \'ave to be a ALTERATION!\'\r\n\r\nBy an \'alteration\' Crass understood that he might get the sack, or that\r\nsomeone else might be put in charge of the job, and that would of\r\ncourse reduce him to the ranks and do away with his chance of being\r\nkept on longer than the others.  He determined to try to ingratiate\r\nhimself with Hunter and appease his wrath by sacrificing someone else.\r\nHe glanced cautiously into the kitchen and up the passage and then,\r\nlowering his voice, he said:\r\n\r\n\'They all shapes pretty well, except Newman.  I would \'ave told you\r\nabout \'im before, but I thought I\'d give \'im a fair chance.  I\'ve spoke\r\nto \'im several times myself about not doin\' enough, but it don\'t seem\r\nto make no difference.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve \'ad me eye on \'im meself for some time,\' replied Nimrod in the\r\nsame tone.  \'Anybody would think the work was goin\' to be sent to a\r\nExhibition, the way \'e messes about with it, rubbing it with glasspaper\r\nand stopping up every little crack!  I can\'t understand where \'e gets\r\nall the glasspaper FROM.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E brings it \'isself!\' said Crass hoarsely.  \'I know for a fact that\r\n\'e bought two \'a\'penny sheets of it, last week out of \'is own money!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, \'e did, did \'e?\' snarled Misery.  \'I\'ll give \'im glasspaper! I\'ll\r\n\'ave a Alteration!\'\r\n\r\nHe went into the hall, where he remained alone for a considerable time,\r\nbrooding.  At last, with the manner of one who has resolved on a\r\ncertain course of action, he turned and entered the room where Philpot\r\nand Harlow were working.\r\n\r\n\'You both get sevenpence an hour, don\'t you?\' he said.\r\n\r\nThey both replied to the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve never worked under price yet,\' added Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Nor me neither,\' observed Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Well, of course you can please yourselves,\' Hunter continued, \'but\r\nafter this week we\'ve decided not to pay more than six and a half.\r\nThings is cut so fine nowadays that we can\'t afford to go on payin\'\r\nsevenpence any longer.  You can work up till tomorrow night on the old\r\nterms, but if you\'re not willin\' to accept six and a half you needn\'t\r\ncome on Saturday morning.  Please yourselves.  Take it or leave it.\'\r\n\r\nHarlow and Philpot were both too much astonished to say anything in\r\nreply to this cheerful announcement, and Hunter, with the final remark,\r\n\'You can think it over,\' left them and went to deliver the same\r\nultimatum to all the other full-price men, who took it in the same way\r\nas Philpot and Harlow had done.  Crass and Owen were the only two whose\r\nwages were not reduced.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Newman was one of those who were already\r\nworking for the reduced rate.  Misery found him alone in one of the\r\nupper rooms, to which he was giving the final coat.  He was at his old\r\ntricks.  The woodwork of the cupboard be was doing was in a rather\r\ndamaged condition, and he was facing up the dents with white-lead putty\r\nbefore painting it.  He knew quite well that Hunter objected to any but\r\nvery large holes or cracks being stopped, and yet somehow  or other he\r\ncould not scamp the work to the extent that he was ordered to; and so,\r\nalmost by stealth, he was in the habit of doing it--not properly but as\r\nwell as he dared.  He even went to the length of occasionally buying a\r\nfew sheets of glasspaper with his own money, as Crass had told Hunter.\r\nWhen the latter came into the room he stood with a sneer on his face,\r\nwatching Newman for about five minutes before he spoke.  The workman\r\nbecame very nervous and awkward under this scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\'You can make out yer time-sheet and come to the office for yer money\r\nat five o\'clock,\' said Nimrod at last.  \'We shan\'t require your\r\nvaluable services no more after tonight.\'\r\n\r\nNewman went white.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'s wrong?\' said he.  \'What have I done?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s not wot you\'ve DONE,\' replied Misery.  \'It\'s wot you\'ve not\r\ndone.  That\'s wot\'s wrong!  You\'ve not done enough, that\'s all!\'  And\r\nwithout further parley he turned and went out.\r\n\r\nNewman stood in the darkening room feeling as if his heart had turned\r\nto lead.  There rose before his mind the picture of his home and\r\nfamily.  He could see them as they were at this very moment, the wife\r\nprobably just beginning to prepare the evening meal, and the children\r\nsetting the cups and saucers and other things on the kitchen table--a\r\nnoisy work, enlivened with many a frolic and childish dispute.  Even\r\nthe two-year-old baby insisted on helping, although she always put\r\neverything in the wrong place and made all sorts of funny mistakes.\r\nThey had all been so happy lately because they knew that he had work\r\nthat would last till nearly Christmas--if not longer.  And now this had\r\nhappened--to plunge them back into the abyss of wretchedness from which\r\nthey had so recently escaped.  They still owed several weeks\' rent, and\r\nwere already so much in debt to the baker and the grocer that it was\r\nhopeless to expect any further credit.\r\n\r\n\'My God!\' said Newman, realizing the almost utter hopelessness of the\r\nchance of obtaining another \'job\' and unconsciously speaking aloud. \'My\r\nGod!  How can I tell them?  What WILL become of us?\'\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished the objects of his visit, Hunter shortly afterwards\r\ndeparted, possibly congratulating himself that he had not been hiding\r\nhis light under a bushel, but that he had set it upon a candlestick and\r\ngiven light unto all that were within that house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they knew that he was gone, the men began to gather into\r\nlittle groups, but in a little while they nearly all found themselves\r\nin the kitchen, discussing the reduction.  Sawkins and the other\r\n\'lightweights\' remained at their work.  Some of them got only fourpence\r\nhalfpenny--Sawkins was paid fivepence--so none of these were affected\r\nby the change.  The other two fresh hands--the journeymen--joined the\r\ncrowd in the kitchen, being anxious to conceal the fact that they had\r\nagreed to accept the reduced rate before being \'taken on\'.  Owen also\r\nwas there, having heard the news from Philpot.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of furious talk.  At first several of them spoke of\r\n\'chucking up\', at once; but others were more prudent, for they knew\r\nthat if they did leave there were dozens of others who would be eager\r\nto take their places.\r\n\r\n\'After all, you know,\' said Slyme, who had--stowed away somewhere at\r\nthe back of his head--an idea of presently starting business on his own\r\naccount: he was only waiting until he had saved enough money, \'after\r\nall, there\'s something in what \'Unter says.  It\'s very \'ard to get a\r\nfair price for work nowadays.  Things IS cut very fine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes! We know all about that!\' shouted Harlow.  \'And who the bloody\r\n\'ell is it cuts \'em?  Why, sich b--rs as \'Unter and Rushton!  If this\r\nfirm \'adn\'t cut this job so fine, some other firm would \'ave \'ad it for\r\nmore money.  Rushton\'s cuttin\' it fine didn\'t MAKE this job, did it?\r\nIt would \'ave been done just the same if they \'adn\'t tendered for it at\r\nall!  The only difference is that we should \'ave been workin\' for some\r\nother master.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t believe the bloody job\'s cut fine at all!\' said Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Rushton is a pal of Sweater\'s and they\'re both members of the Town\r\nCouncil.\'\r\n\r\n\'That may be,\' replied Slyme; \'but all the same I believe Sweater got\r\nseveral other prices besides Rushton\'s--friend or no friend; and you\r\ncan\'t blame \'im: it\'s only business.  But pr\'aps Rushton got the\r\npreference--Sweater may \'ave told \'im the others\' prices.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and a bloody fine lot of prices they was, too, if the truth was\r\nknown!\' said Bundy.  \'There was six other firms after this job to my\r\nknowledge--Pushem and Sloggem, Bluffum and Doemdown, Dodger and\r\nScampit, Snatcham and Graball, Smeeriton and Leavit, Makehaste and\r\nSloggitt, and Gord only knows \'ow many more.\'\r\n\r\nAt this moment Newman came into the room.  He looked so white and upset\r\nthat the others involuntarily paused in their conversation.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what do YOU think of it?\' asked Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Think of what?\' said Newman.\r\n\r\n\'Why, didn\'t \'Unter tell you?\' cried several voices, whose owners\r\nlooked suspiciously at him.  They thought--if Hunter had not spoken to\r\nNewman, it must be because he was already working under price. There\r\nhad been a rumour going about the last few days to that effect.\r\n\r\n\'Didn\'t Misery tell you?  They\'re not goin\' to pay more than six and a\r\nhalf after this week.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not what \'e said to me.  \'E just told me to knock off. Said  I\r\ndidn\'t do enough for \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Jesus Christ!\' exclaimed Crass, pretending to be overcome with\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nNewman\'s account of what had transpired was listened to in gloomy\r\nsilence.  \'Those who--a few minutes previously--had been talking loudly\r\nof chucking up the job became filled with apprehension that they might\r\nbe served in the same manner as he had been.  Crass was one of the\r\nloudest in his expression of astonishment and indignation, but he\r\nrather overdid it and only succeeded in confirming the secret suspicion\r\nof the others that he had had something to do with Hunter\'s action.\r\n\r\nThe result of the discussion was that they decided to submit to\r\nMisery\'s terms for the time being, until they could see a chance of\r\ngetting work elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs Owen had to go to the office to see the wallpaper spoken of by\r\nHunter, he accompanied Newman when the latter went to get his wages.\r\nNimrod was waiting for them, and had the money ready in an envelope,\r\nwhich he handed to Newman, who took it without speaking and went away.\r\n\r\nMisery had been rummaging amongst the old wallpapers, and had got out a\r\ngreat heap of odd rolls, which he now submitted to Owen, but after\r\nexamining them the latter said that they were unsuitable for the\r\npurpose, so after some argument Misery was compelled to sign an order\r\nfor some proper cartridge paper, which Owen obtained at a stationer\'s\r\non his way home.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Misery went to the \'Cave\', he was in a fearful\r\nrage, and he kicked up a terrible row with Crass.  He said that Mr\r\nRushton had been complaining of the lack of discipline on the job, and\r\nhe told Crass to tell all the hands that for the future singing in\r\nworking hours was strictly forbidden, and anyone caught breaking this\r\nrule would be instantly dismissed.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the following days Nimrod called at Owen\'s flat to\r\nsee how the work was progressing and to impress upon him the necessity\r\nof not taking too much trouble over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Starr\r\n\r\n\r\n\'What time is it now, Mum?\' asked Frankie as soon as he had finished\r\ndinner on the following Sunday.\r\n\r\n\'Two o\'clock.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hooray!  Only one more hour and Charley will be here!  Oh, I wish it\r\nwas three o\'clock now, don\'t you, Mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, dear, I don\'t.  You\'re not dressed yet, you know.\'\r\n\r\nFrankie made a grimace.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re surely not going to make me wear my velvets, are you, Mum?\r\nCan\'t I go just as I am, in my old clothes?\'\r\n\r\nThe \'velvets\' was a brown suit of that material that Nora had made out\r\nof the least worn parts of an old costume of her own.\r\n\r\n\'Of course not: if you went as you are now, you\'d have everyone staring\r\nat you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I suppose I\'ll have to put up with it,\' said Frankie, resignedly.\r\n\r\n\'And I think you\'d better begin to dress me now, don\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, there\'s plenty of time yet; you\'d only make yourself untidy and\r\nthen I should have the trouble all over again.  Play with your toys a\r\nlittle while, and when I\'ve done the washing up I\'ll get you ready.\'\r\n\r\nFrankie obeyed, and for about ten minutes his mother heard him in the\r\nnext room rummaging in the box where he stored his collection of\r\n\'things\'.  At the end of that time, however, he returned to the\r\nkitchen.  \'Is it time to dress me yet, Mum?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, dear, not yet.  You needn\'t be afraid; you\'ll be ready in plenty\r\nof time.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I can\'t help being afraid; you might forget.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I shan\'t forget.  There\'s lots of time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you know, I should be much easier in my mind if you would dress\r\nme now, because perhaps our clock\'s wrong, or p\'r\'aps when you begin\r\ndressing me you\'ll find some buttons off or something, and then\r\nthere\'ll be a lot of time wasted sewing them on; or p\'r\'aps you won\'t\r\nbe able to find my clean stockings or something and then while you\'re\r\nlooking for it Charley might come, and if he sees I\'m not ready he\r\nmightn\'t wait for me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, dear!\' said Nora, pretending to be alarmed at this appalling list\r\nof possibilities.  \'I suppose it will be safer to dress you at once.\r\nIt\'s very evident you won\'t let me have much peace until it is done,\r\nbut mind when you\'re dressed you\'ll have to sit down quietly and wait\r\ntill he comes, because I don\'t want the trouble of dressing you twice.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I don\'t mind sitting still,\' returned Frankie, loftily.  \'That\'s\r\nvery easy.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind having to take care of my clothes,\' said Frankie as his\r\nmother--having washed and dressed him, was putting the finishing\r\ntouches to his hair, brushing and combing and curling the long yellow\r\nlocks into ringlets round her fingers, \'the only thing I don\'t like is\r\nhaving my hair done.  You know all these curls are quite unnecessary.\r\nI\'m sure it would save you a lot of trouble if you wouldn\'t mind\r\ncutting them off.\'\r\n\r\nNora did not answer: somehow or other she was unwilling to comply with\r\nthis often-repeated entreaty.  It seemed to her that when this hair was\r\ncut off the child would have become a different individual--more\r\nseparate and independent.\r\n\r\n\'If you don\'t want to cut it off for your own sake, you might do it for\r\nmy sake, because I think it\'s the reason some of the big boys don\'t\r\nwant to play with me, and some of them shout after me and say I\'m a\r\ngirl, and sometimes they sneak up behind me and pull it.  Only\r\nyesterday I had to have a fight with a boy for doing it: and even\r\nCharley Linden laughs at me, and he\'s my best friend--except you and\r\nDad of course.\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t you cut it off, Mum?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am going to cut it as I promised you, after your next birthday.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I shall be jolly glad when it comes.  Won\'t you?  Why, what\'s the\r\nmatter, Mum?  What are you crying for?\'  Frankie was so concerned that\r\nhe began to cry also, wondering if he had done or said something wrong.\r\nHe kissed her repeatedly, stroking her face with his hand. What\'s the\r\nmatter, Mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'I was thinking that when you\'re over seven and you\'ve had your hair\r\ncut short you won\'t be a baby any more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, I\'m not a baby now, am I? Here, look at this!\'\r\n\r\nHe strode over to the wall and, dragging out two chairs, he placed them\r\nin the middle of the room, back to back, about fifteen inches apart,\r\nand before his mother realized what he was doing he had climbed up and\r\nstood with one leg on the back of each chair.\r\n\r\n\'I should like to see a baby who could do this,\' he cried, with his\r\nface wet with tears.  \'You needn\'t lift me down.  I can get down by\r\nmyself.  Babies can\'t do tricks like these or even wipe up the spoons\r\nand forks or sweep the passage.  But you needn\'t cut it off if you\r\ndon\'t want to.  I\'ll bear it as long as you like.  Only don\'t cry any\r\nmore, because it makes me miserable.  If I cry when I fall down or when\r\nyou pull my hair when you\'re combing it you always tell me to bear it\r\nlike a man and not be a baby, and now you\'re crying yourself just\r\nbecause I\'m not a baby.  You ought to be jolly glad that I\'m nearly\r\ngrown up into a man, because you know I\'ve promised to build you a\r\nhouse with the money I earn, and then you needn\'t do no more work.\r\nWe\'ll have a servant the same as the people downstairs, and Dad can\r\nstop at home and sit by the fire and read the paper or play with me and\r\nMaud and have pillow fights and tell stories and--\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all right, dearie,\' said Nora, kissing him.  \'I\'m not crying now,\r\nand you mustn\'t either, or your eyes will be all red and you won\'t be\r\nable to go with Charley at all.\'\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished dressing him, Frankie sat for some time in\r\nsilence, apparently lost in thought.  At last he said:\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t you get a baby, Mother?  You could nurse it, and I could\r\nhave it to play with instead of going out in the street.\'\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t afford to keep a baby, dear.  You know, even as it is,\r\nsometimes we have to go without things we want because we haven\'t the\r\nmoney to buy them.  Babies need many things that cost lots of money.\'\r\n\r\n\'When I build our house when I\'m a man, I\'ll take jolly good care not\r\nto have a gas-stove in it.  That\'s what runs away with all the money;\r\nwe\'re always putting pennies in the slot.  And that reminds me: Charley\r\nsaid I\'ll have to take a ha\'penny to put in the mishnery box. Oh, dear,\r\nI\'m tired of sitting still.  I wish he\'d come. What time is it now,\r\nMother?\'\r\n\r\nBefore she could answer both Frankie\'s anxiety and the painful ordeal\r\nof sitting still were terminated by the loud peal at the bell\r\nannouncing Charley\'s arrival, and Frankie, without troubling to observe\r\nthe usual formality of looking out of the window to see if it was a\r\nrunaway ring, had clattered half-way downstairs before he heard his\r\nmother calling him to come back for the halfpenny; then he clattered up\r\nagain and then down again at such a rate and with so much noise as to\r\nrouse the indignation of all the respectable people in the house.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the bottom of the stairs he remembered that he had\r\nomitted to say goodbye, and as it was too far to go up again he rang\r\nthe bell and then went into the middle of the road and looked up at the\r\nwindow that Nora opened.\r\n\r\n\'Goodbye, Mother,\' he shouted.  \'Tell Dad I forgot to say it before I\r\ncame down.\'\r\n\r\nThe School was not conducted in the chapel itself, but in a large\r\nlecture hall under it.  At one end was a small platform raised about\r\nsix inches from the floor; on this was a chair and a small table.  A\r\nnumber of groups of chairs and benches were arranged at intervals round\r\nthe sides and in the centre of the room, each group of seats\r\naccommodating a separate class.  On the walls--which were painted a\r\npale green--were a number of coloured pictures: Moses striking the\r\nRock, the Israelites dancing round the Golden Calf, and so on.  As the\r\nreader is aware, Frankie had never been to a Sunday School of any kind\r\nbefore, and he stood for a moment looking in at the door and half\r\nafraid to enter.  The lessons had already commenced, but the scholars\r\nhad not yet settled down to work.\r\n\r\nThe scene was one of some disorder: some of the children talking,\r\nlaughing or playing, and the teachers alternately threatening and\r\ncoaxing them.  The girls\' and the very young children\'s classes were\r\npresided over by ladies: the boys\' teachers were men.\r\n\r\nThe reader already has some slight knowledge of a few of these people.\r\nThere was Mr Didlum, Mr Sweater, Mr Rushton and Mr Hunter and Mrs\r\nStarvem (Ruth Easton\'s former mistress).  On this occasion, in addition\r\nto the teachers and other officials of the Sunday School, there were\r\nalso present a considerable number of prettily dressed ladies and a few\r\ngentlemen, who had come in the hope of meeting the Rev. John Starr, the\r\nyoung clergyman who was going to be their minister for the next few\r\nweeks during the absence of their regular shepherd, Mr Belcher, who was\r\ngoing away for a holiday for the benefit of his health.  Mr Belcher was\r\nnot suffering from any particular malady, but was merely \'run down\',\r\nand rumour had it that this condition had been brought about by the\r\nrigorous asceticism of his life and his intense devotion to the arduous\r\nlabours of his holy calling.\r\n\r\nMr Starr had conducted the service in the Shining Light Chapel that\r\nmorning, and a great sensation had been produced by the young\r\nminister\'s earnest and eloquent address, which was of a very different\r\nstyle from that of their regular minister.  Although perhaps they had\r\nnot quite grasped the real significance of all that he had said, most\r\nof them had been favourably impressed by the young clergyman\'s\r\nappearance and manner in the morning: but that might have arisen from\r\nprepossession and force of habit, for they were accustomed, as a matter\r\nof course, to think well of any minister.  There were, however, one or\r\ntwo members of the congregation who were not without some misgivings\r\nand doubts as to the soundness of his doctrines.  Mr Starr had promised\r\nthat he would look in some time during the afternoon to say a few words\r\nto the Sunday School children, and consequently on this particular\r\nafternoon all the grown-ups were looking forward so eagerly to hearing\r\nhim again that not much was done in the way of lessons.  Every time a\r\nlate arrival entered all eyes were directed towards the door in the\r\nhope and expectation that it was he.\r\n\r\nWhen Frankie, standing at the door, saw all the people looking at him\r\nhe drew back timidly.\r\n\r\n\'Come on, man,\' said Charley.  \'You needn\'t be afraid; it\'s not like a\r\nweekday school; they can\'t do nothing to us, not even if we don\'t\r\nbehave ourselves.  There\'s our class over in that corner and that\'s our\r\nteacher, Mr Hunter.  You can sit next to me. Come on!\'\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Frankie followed Charley over to the class, and both\r\nsat down.  The teacher was so kind and spoke so gently to the children\r\nthat in a few minutes Frankie felt quite at home.\r\n\r\nWhen Hunter noticed how well cared for and well dressed he was he\r\nthought the child must belong to well-to-do, respectable parents.\r\nFrankie did not pay much attention to the lesson, for he was too much\r\ninterested in the pictures on the walls and in looking at the other\r\nchildren.  He also noticed a very fat man who was not teaching at all,\r\nbut drifted aimlessly about he room from one class to another.  After a\r\ntime he came and stood by the class where Frankie was, and, after\r\nnodding to Hunter, remained near, listening and smiling patronizingly\r\nat the children.  He was arrayed in a long garment of costly black\r\ncloth, a sort of frock coat, and by the rotundity of his figure he\r\nseemed to be one of those accustomed to sit in the chief places at\r\nfeasts.  This was the Rev. Mr Belcher, minister of the Shining Light\r\nChapel.  His short, thick neck was surrounded by a studless collar, and\r\napparently buttonless, being fastened in some mysterious way known only\r\nto himself, and he showed no shirt front.\r\n\r\nThe long garment beforementioned was unbuttoned and through the opening\r\nthere protruded a vast expanse of waistcoat and trousers, distended\r\nalmost to bursting by the huge globe of flesh they contained.  A gold\r\nwatch-chain with a locket extended partly across the visible portion of\r\nthe envelope of the globe.  He had very large feet which were carefully\r\nencased in soft calfskin boots.  If he had removed the long garment,\r\nthis individual would have resembled a balloon: the feet representing\r\nthe car and the small head that surmounted the globe, the safety valve;\r\nas it was it did actually serve the purpose of a safety valve, the\r\nowner being, in consequence of gross overfeeding and lack of natural\r\nexercise, afflicted with chronic flatulence, which manifested itself in\r\nfrequent belchings forth through the mouth of the foul gases generated\r\nin the stomach by the decomposition of the foods with which it was\r\ngenerally loaded. But as the Rev. Mr Belcher had never been seen with\r\nhis coat off, no one ever noticed the resemblance.  It was not\r\nnecessary for him to take his coat off: his part in life was not to\r\nhelp to produce, but to help to devour the produce of the labour of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAfter exchanging a few words and grins with Hunter, he moved on to\r\nanother class, and presently Frankie with a feeling of awe noticed that\r\nthe confused murmuring sound that had hitherto pervaded the place was\r\nhushed.  The time allotted for lessons had expired, and the teachers\r\nwere quietly distributing hymn-books to the children. Meanwhile the\r\nballoon had drifted up to the end of the hall and had ascended the\r\nplatform, where it remained stationary by the side of the table,\r\noccasionally emitting puffs of gas through the safety valve. On the\r\ntable were several books, and also a pile of folded cards. These latter\r\nwere about six inches by three inches; there was some printing on the\r\noutside: one of them was lying open on the table, showing the inside,\r\nwhich was ruled and had money columns.\r\n\r\nPresently Mr Belcher reached out a flabby white hand and, taking up one\r\nof the folded cards, he looked around upon the under-fed, ill-clad\r\nchildren with a large, sweet, benevolent, fatherly smile, and then in a\r\ndrawling voice occasionally broken by explosions of flatulence, he said:\r\n\r\n\'My dear children.  This afternoon as I was standing near Brother\r\nHunter\'s class I heard him telling them of the wanderings of the\r\nChildren of Israel in the wilderness, and of all the wonderful things\r\nthat were done for them; and I thought how sad it was that they were so\r\nungrateful.\r\n\r\n\'Now those ungrateful Israelites had received many things, but we have\r\neven more cause to be grateful than they had, for we have received even\r\nmore abundantly than they did.\'  (Here the good man\'s voice was stilled\r\nby a succession of explosions.)  \'And I am sure,\' he resumed, \'that\r\nnone of you would like to be even as those Israelites, ungrateful for\r\nall the good things you have received.  Oh, how thankful you should be\r\nfor having been made happy English children. Now, I am sure that you\r\nare grateful and that you will all be very glad of an opportunity of\r\nshowing your gratitude by doing something in return.\r\n\r\n\'Doubtless some of you have noticed the unseemly condition of the\r\ninterior of our Chapel.  The flooring is broken in countless places.\r\nthe walls are sadly in need of cleansing and distempering, and they\r\nalso need cementing externally to keep out the draught.  The seats and\r\nbenches and the chairs are also in a most unseemly condition and need\r\nvarnishing.\r\n\r\n\'Now, therefore, after much earnest meditation and prayer, it has been\r\ndecided to open a Subscription List, and although times are very hard\r\njust now, we believe we shall succeed in getting enough to have the\r\nwork done; so I want each one of you to take one of these cards and go\r\nround to all your friends to see how much you can collect.  It doesn\'t\r\nmatter how trifling the amounts are, because the smallest donations\r\nwill be thankfully received.\r\n\r\n\'Now, I hope you will all do your very best.  Ask everyone you know; do\r\nnot refrain from asking people because you think that they are too poor\r\nto give a donation, but remind them that if they cannot give their\r\nthousands they can give the widow\'s mite.  Ask Everyone!  First of all\r\nask those whom you feel certain will give: then ask all those whom you\r\nthink may possibly give: and, finally, ask all those whom you feel\r\ncertain will not give: and you will be surprised to find that many of\r\nthese last will donate abundantly.\r\n\r\n\'If your friends are very poor and unable to give a large donation at\r\none time, a good plan would be to arrange to call upon them every\r\nSaturday afternoon with your card to collect their donations.  And\r\nwhile you are asking others, do not forget to give what you can\r\nyourselves.  Just a little self-denial, and those pennies and\r\nhalf-pennies which you so often spend on sweets and other unnecessary\r\nthings might be given--as a donation--to the good cause.\'\r\n\r\nHere the holy man paused again, and there was a rumbling, gurgling\r\nnoise in the interior of the balloon, followed by several escapes of\r\ngas through the safety valve.  The paroxysm over, the apostle of\r\nself-denial continued:\r\n\r\n\'All those who wish to collect donations will stay behind for a few\r\nminutes after school, when Brother Hunter--who has kindly consented to\r\nact as secretary to the fund--will issue the cards.\r\n\r\n\'I would like here to say a few words of thanks to Brother Hunter for\r\nthe great interest he has displayed in this matter, and for all the\r\ntrouble he is taking to help us to gather in the donations.\'\r\n\r\nThis tribute was well deserved; Hunter in fact had originated the whole\r\nscheme in the hope of securing the job for Rushton & Co., and\r\ntwo-and-a-half per cent of the profits for himself.\r\n\r\nMr Belcher now replaced the collecting card on the table and, taking up\r\none of the hymn-books, gave out the words and afterwards conducted the\r\nsinging, flourishing one fat, flabby white hand in the air and holding\r\nthe book in the other.\r\n\r\nAs the last strains of the music died away, he closed his eyes and a\r\nsweet smile widened his mouth as he stretched forth his right hand,\r\nopen, palm down, with the fingers close together, and said:\r\n\r\n\'Let us pray.\'\r\n\r\nWith much shuffling of feet everyone knelt down.  Hunter\'s lanky form\r\nwas distributed over a very large area; his body lay along one of the\r\nbenches, his legs and feet sprawled over the floor, and his huge hands\r\nclasped the sides of the seat.  His eyes were tightly closed and an\r\nexpression of the most intense misery pervaded his long face.\r\n\r\nMrs Starvem, being so fat that she knew if she once knelt down she\r\nwould never be able to get up again, compromised by sitting on the\r\nextreme edge of her chair, resting her elbows on the back of the seat\r\nin front of her, and burying her face in her hands.  It was a very\r\nlarge face, but her hands were capacious enough to receive it.\r\n\r\nIn a seat at the back of the hall knelt a pale-faced, weary-looking\r\nlittle woman about thirty-six years of age, very shabbily dressed, who\r\nhad come in during the singing.  This was Mrs White, the caretaker,\r\nBert White\'s mother.  When her husband died, the committee of the\r\nChapel, out of charity, gave her this work, for which they paid her six\r\nshillings a week.  Of course, they could not offer her full employment;\r\nthe idea was that she could get other work as well, charing and things\r\nof that kind, and do the Chapel work in between. There wasn\'t much to\r\ndo: just the heating furnace to light when necessary; the Chapel,\r\ncommittee rooms, classrooms and Sunday School to sweep and scrub out\r\noccasionally; the hymn-books to collect, etc. Whenever they had a tea\r\nmeeting--which was on an average about twice a week--there were the\r\ntrestle tables to fix up, the chairs to arrange, the table to set out,\r\nand then, supervised by Miss Didlum or some other lady, the tea to\r\nmake.  There was rather a lot to do on the days following these\r\nfunctions: the washing up, the tables and chairs to put away, the floor\r\nto sweep, and so on; but the extra work was supposed to be compensated\r\nby the cakes and broken victuals generally left over from the feast,\r\nwhich were much appreciated as a welcome change from the bread and\r\ndripping or margarine that constituted Mrs White\'s and Bert\'s usual\r\nfare.\r\n\r\nThere were several advantages attached to the position: the caretaker\r\nbecame acquainted with the leading members and their wives, some of\r\nwho, out of charity, occasionally gave her a day\'s work as charwoman,\r\nthe wages being on about the same generous scale as those she earned at\r\nthe Chapel, sometimes supplemented by a parcel of broken victuals or\r\nsome castoff clothing.\r\n\r\nAn evil-minded, worldly or unconverted person might possibly sum up the\r\nmatter thus: these people required this work done: they employed this\r\nwoman to do it, taking advantage of her poverty to impose upon her\r\nconditions of price and labour that they would not have liked to endure\r\nthemselves.  Although she worked very hard, early and late, the money\r\nthey paid her as wages was insufficient to enable her to provide\r\nherself with the bare necessaries of life.  Then her employers, being\r\ngood, kind, generous, Christian people, came to the rescue and bestowed\r\ncharity, in the form of cast-off clothing and broken victuals.\r\n\r\nShould any such evil-minded, worldly or unconverted persons happen to\r\nread these lines, it is a sufficient answer to their impious and\r\nmalicious criticisms to say that no such thoughts ever entered the\r\nsimple mind of Mrs White herself: on the contrary, this very afternoon\r\nas she knelt in the Chapel, wearing an old mantle that some years\r\npreviously had adorned the obese person of the saintly Mrs Starvem, her\r\nheart was filled with gratitude towards her generous benefactors.\r\n\r\nDuring the prayer the door was softly opened: a gentleman in clerical\r\ndress entered on tiptoe and knelt down next to Mr Didlum.  He came in\r\nvery softly, but all the same most of those present heard him and\r\nlifted their heads or peeped through their fingers to see who it was,\r\nand when they recognized him a sound like a sigh swept through the hall.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the prayer, amid groans and cries of \'Amen\', the balloon\r\nslowly descended from the platform, and collapsed into one of the\r\nseats, and everyone rose up from the floor.  When all were seated and\r\nthe shuffling, coughing and blowing of noses had ceased Mr Didlum stood\r\nup and said:\r\n\r\n\'Before we sing the closin\' \'ymn, the gentleman hon my left, the Rev.\r\nMr John Starr, will say a few words.\'\r\n\r\nAn expectant murmur rippled through the hall.  The ladies lifted their\r\neyebrows and nodded, smiled and whispered to each other; the gentlemen\r\nassumed various attitudes and expressions; the children were very\r\nquiet.  Everyone was in a state of suppressed excitement as John Starr\r\nrose from his seat and, stepping up on to the platform, stood by the\r\nside of the table, facing them.\r\n\r\nHe was about twenty-six years of age, tall and slenderly built.  His\r\nclean-cut, intellectual face, with its lofty forehead, and his air of\r\nrefinement and culture were in striking contrast to the coarse\r\nappearance of the other adults in the room: the vulgar, ignorant,\r\nuncultivated crowd of profit-mongers and hucksters in front of him. But\r\nit was not merely his air of good breeding and the general comeliness\r\nof his exterior that attracted and held one.  There was an indefinable\r\nsomething about him--an atmosphere of gentleness and love that seemed\r\nto radiate from his whole being, almost compelling confidence and\r\naffection from all those with whom he came in contact. As he stood\r\nthere facing the others with an inexpressibly winning smile upon his\r\ncomely face, it seemed impossible that there could be any fellowship\r\nbetween him and them.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in his appearance to give anyone even an inkling of\r\nthe truth, which was: that he was there for the purpose of bolstering\r\nup the characters of the despicable crew of sweaters and slave-drivers\r\nwho paid his wages.\r\n\r\nHe did not give a very long address this afternoon--only just a Few\r\nWords; but they were very precious, original and illuminating.  He told\r\nthem of certain Thoughts that had occurred to his mind on his way there\r\nthat afternoon; and as they listened, Sweater, Rushton, Didlum, Hunter,\r\nand the other disciples exchanged significant looks and gestures.  Was\r\nit not magnificent!  Such power!  Such reasoning!  In fact, as they\r\nafterwards modestly admitted to each other, it was so profound that\r\neven they experienced great difficulty in fathoming the speaker\'s\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nAs for the ladies, they were motionless and dumb with admiration. They\r\nsat with flushed faces, shining eyes and palpitating hearts, looking\r\nhungrily at the dear man as he proceeded:\r\n\r\n\'Unfortunately, our time this afternoon does not permit us to dwell at\r\nlength upon these Thoughts.  Perhaps at some future date we may have\r\nthe blessed privilege of so doing; but this afternoon I have been asked\r\nto say a Few Words on another subject.  The failing health of your dear\r\nminister has for some time past engaged the anxious attention of the\r\ncongregation.\'\r\n\r\nSympathetic glances were directed towards the interesting invalid; the\r\nladies murmured, \'Poor dear!\' and other expressions of anxious concern.\r\n\r\n\'Although naturally robust,\' continued Starr, \'long, continued\r\nOverwork, the loving solicitude for Others that often prevented him\r\ntaking even necessary repose, and a too rigorous devotion to the\r\npractice of Self-denial have at last brought about the inevitable\r\nBreakdown, and rendered a period of Rest absolutely imperative.\'\r\n\r\nThe orator paused to take breath, and the silence that ensued was\r\ndisturbed only by faint rumblings in the interior of the ascetic victim\r\nof overwork.\r\n\r\n\'With this laudable object,\' proceeded Starr, \'a Subscription List was\r\nquietly opened about a month ago, and those dear children who had cards\r\nand assisted in the good work of collecting donations will be pleased\r\nto hear that altogether a goodly sum was gathered, but as it was not\r\nquite enough, the committee voted a further amount out of the General\r\nFund, and at a special meeting held last Friday evening, your dear\r\nShepherd was presented with an illuminated address, and a purse of gold\r\nsufficient to defray the expenses of a month\'s holiday in the South of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\'Although, of course, he regrets being separated from you even for such\r\na brief period he feels that in going he is choosing the lesser of two\r\nevils.  It is better to go to the South of France for a month than to\r\ncontinue Working in spite of the warnings of exhausted nature and\r\nperhaps be taken away from you altogether--to Heaven.\'\r\n\r\n\'God forbid!\' fervently ejaculated several disciples, and a ghastly\r\npallor overspread the features of the object of their prayers.\r\n\r\n\'Even as it is there is a certain amount of danger.  Let us hope and\r\npray for the best, but if the worst should happen and he is called upon\r\nto Ascend, there will be some satisfaction in knowing that you have\r\ndone what you could to avert the dreadful calamity.\'\r\n\r\nHere, probably as a precaution against the possibility of an\r\ninvoluntary ascent, a large quantity of gas was permitted to escape\r\nthrough the safety valve of the balloon.\r\n\r\n\'He sets out on his pilgrimage tomorrow,\' concluded Starr, \'and I am\r\nsure he will be followed by the good wishes and prayers of all the\r\nmembers of his flock.\'\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentleman resumed his seat, and almost immediately it\r\nbecame evident from the oscillations of the balloon that Mr Belcher was\r\ndesirous of rising to say a Few Words in acknowledgement, but he was\r\nrestrained by the entreaties of those near him, who besought him not to\r\nexhaust himself.  He afterwards said that he would not have been able\r\nto say much even if they had permitted him to speak, because he felt\r\ntoo full.\r\n\r\n\'During the absence of our beloved pastor,\' said Brother Didlum, who\r\nnow rose to give out the closing hymn, \'his flock will not be left\r\nhentirely without a shepherd, for we \'ave arranged with Mr Starr to\r\ncome and say a Few Words to us hevery Sunday.\'\r\n\r\nFrom the manner in which they constantly referred to themselves, it\r\nmight have been thought that they were a flock of sheep instead of\r\nbeing what they really were--a pack of wolves.\r\n\r\nWhen they heard Brother Didlum\'s announcement a murmur of intense\r\nrapture rose from the ladies, and Mr Starr rolled his eyes and smiled\r\nsweetly.  Brother Didlum did not mention the details of the\r\n\'arrangement\', to have done so at that time would have been most\r\nunseemly, but the following extract from the accounts of the chapel\r\nwill not be out of place here: \'Paid to Rev. John Starr for Sunday,\r\nNov. 14--L4.4.0 per the treasurer.\'  It was not a large sum considering\r\nthe great services rendered by Mr Starr, but, small as it was, it is to\r\nbe feared that many worldly, unconverted persons will think it was far\r\ntoo much to pay for a Few Words, even such wise words as Mr John\r\nStarr\'s admittedly always were.  But the Labourer is worthy of his hire.\r\n\r\nAfter the \'service\' was over, most of the children, including Charley\r\nand Frankie, remained to get collecting cards. Mr Starr was surrounded\r\nby a crowd of admirers, and a little later, when he rode away with Mr\r\nBelcher and Mr Sweater in the latter\'s motor car, the ladies looked\r\nhungrily after that conveyance, listening to the melancholy \'pip, pip\'\r\nof its hooter and trying to console themselves with the reflection that\r\nthey would see him again in a few hours\' time at the evening service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18\r\n\r\nThe Lodger\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his arrangement with Hunter, Owen commenced the work\r\nin the drawing-room on the Monday morning.  Harlow and Easton were\r\ndistempering some of the ceilings, and about ten o\'clock they went down\r\nto the scullery to get some more whitewash.  Crass was there as usual,\r\npretending to be very busy mixing colours.\r\n\r\n\'Well, wot do you think of it?\' he said as he served them with what\r\nthey required.\r\n\r\n\'Think of what?\' asked Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Why, hour speshul hartist,\' replied Crass with a sneer.  \'Do you think\r\n\'e\'s goin\' to get through with it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Shouldn\'t like to say,\' replied Easton guardedly.\r\n\r\n\'You know it\'s one thing to draw on a bit of paper and colour it with a\r\npenny box of paints, and quite another thing to do it on a wall or\r\nceiling,\' continued Crass.  \'Ain\'t it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; that\'s true enough,\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Do you believe they\'re \'is own designs?\' Crass went on.\r\n\r\n\'Be rather \'ard to tell,\' remarked Easton, embarrassed.\r\n\r\nNeither Harlow nor Easton shared Crass\'s sentiments in this matter, but\r\nat the same time they could not afford to offend him by sticking up for\r\nOwen.\r\n\r\n\'If you was to ast me, quietly,\' Crass added, \'I should be more\r\ninclined to say as \'e copied it all out of some book.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just about the size of it, mate,\' agreed Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'It would be a bit of all right if \'e was to make a bloody mess of it,\r\nwouldn\'t it?\' Crass continued with a malignant leer.\r\n\r\n\'Not arf!\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\nWhen the two men regained the upper landing on which they were working\r\nthey exchanged significant glances and laughed quietly.  Hearing these\r\nhalf-suppressed sounds of merriment, Philpot, who was working alone in\r\na room close by, put his head out of the doorway.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s the game?\' he inquired in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\'Ole Crass ain\'t arf wild about Owen doin\' that room,\' replied Harlow,\r\nand repeated the substance of Crass\'s remarks.\r\n\r\n\'It is a bit of a take-down for the bleeder, ain\'t it, \'avin\' to play\r\nsecond fiddle,\' said Philpot with a delighted grin.\r\n\r\n\'\'E\'s opin\' Owen\'ll make a mess of it,\' Easton whispered.\r\n\r\n\'Well, \'e\'ll be disappointed, mate,\' answered Philpot.  \'I was workin\'\r\nalong of Owen for Pushem and Sloggem about two year ago, and I seen \'im\r\ndo a job down at the Royal \'Otel--the smokin\'-room ceilin\' it was--and\r\nI can tell you it looked a bloody treat!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve heard tell of it,\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no doubt Owen knows \'is work,\' remarked Easton, \'although \'e\r\nis a bit orf is onion about Socialism.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know so much about that, mate,\' returned Philpot.  \'I agree\r\nwith a lot that \'e ses.  I\'ve often thought the same things meself, but\r\nI can\'t talk like \'im, \'cause I ain\'t got no \'ead for it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I agree with some of it too,\' said Harlow with a laugh, \'but all the\r\nsame \'e does say some bloody silly things, you must admit.  For\r\ninstance, that stuff about money bein\' the cause of poverty.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes. I can\'t exactly see that meself,\' agreed Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'We must tackle \'im about that at dinner-time,\' said Harlow.  \'I should\r\nrather like to \'ear \'ow \'e makes it out.\'\r\n\r\n\'For Gord\'s sake don\'t go startin\' no arguments at dinner-time,\' said\r\nEaston.  \'Leave \'im alone when \'e is quiet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; let\'s \'ave our dinner in peace, if possible,\' said Philpot.\r\n\'Sh!!\' he added, hoarsely, suddenly holding up his hand warningly. They\r\nlistened intently.  It was evident from the creaking of the stairs that\r\nsomeone was crawling up them.  Philpot instantly disappeared.  Harlow\r\nlifted up the pail of whitewash and set it down again noisily.\r\n\r\n\'I think we\'d better \'ave the steps and the plank over this side,\r\nEaston,\' he said in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I think that\'ll be the best way,\' replied Easton.\r\n\r\nWhile they were arranging their scaffold to do the ceiling Crass\r\narrived on the landing.  He made no remark at first, but walked into\r\nthe room to see how many ceilings they had done.\r\n\r\n\'You\'d better look alive, you chaps, he said as he went downstairs\r\nagain.  \'If we don\'t get these ceilings finished by dinner-time,\r\nNimrod\'s sure to ramp.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Harlow, gruffly.  \'We\'ll bloody soon slosh \'em over.\'\r\n\r\n\'Slosh\' was a very suitable word; very descriptive of the manner in\r\nwhich the work was done.  The cornices of the staircase ceilings were\r\nenriched with plaster ornaments.  These ceilings were supposed to have\r\nbeen washed off, but as the men who were put to do that work had not\r\nbeen allowed sufficient time to do it properly, the crevices of the\r\nornaments were still filled up with old whitewash, and by the time\r\nHarlow and Easton had \'sloshed\' a lot more whitewash on to them they\r\nwere mere formless unsightly lumps of plaster.  The \'hands\' who did the\r\n\'washing off\' were not to blame.  They had been hunted away from the\r\nwork before it was half done.\r\n\r\nWhile Harlow and Easton were distempering these ceilings, Philpot and\r\nthe other hands were proceeding with the painting in different parts of\r\nthe inside of the house, and Owen, assisted by Bert, was getting on\r\nwith the work in the drawing-room, striking chalk lines and measuring\r\nand setting out the different panels.\r\n\r\nThere were no \'political\' arguments that day at dinner-time, to the\r\ndisappointment of Crass, who was still waiting for an opportunity to\r\nproduce the Obscurer cutting.  After dinner, when the others had all\r\ngone back to their work, Philpot unobtrusively returned to the kitchen\r\nand gathered up the discarded paper wrappers in which some of the men\r\nhad brought their food.  Spreading one of these open, he shook the\r\ncrumbs from the others upon it.  In this way and by picking up\r\nparticles of bread from the floor, he collected a little pile of crumbs\r\nand crusts.  To these he added some fragments that he had left from his\r\nown dinner.  He then took the parcel upstairs and opening one of the\r\nwindows threw the crumbs on to the roof of the portico.  He had\r\nscarcely closed the window when two starlings fluttered down and began\r\nto eat.  Philpot watching them furtively from behind the shutter.  The\r\nafternoon passed uneventfully. From one till five seemed a very long\r\ntime to most of the hands, but to Owen and his mate, who were doing\r\nsomething in which they were able to feel some interest and pleasure,\r\nthe time passed so rapidly that they both regretted the approach of\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\'Other days,\' remarked Bert, \'I always keeps on wishin\' it was time to\r\ngo \'ome, but today seems to \'ave gorn like lightnin\'!\'\r\n\r\nAfter leaving off that night, all the men kept together till they\r\narrived down town, and then separated.  Owen went by himself: Easton,\r\nPhilpot, Crass and Bundy adjourned to the \'Cricketers Arms\' to have a\r\ndrink together before going home, and Slyme, who was a teetotaler, went\r\nby himself, although he was now lodging with Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t wait for me,\' said the latter as he went off with Crass and the\r\nothers.  \'I shall most likely catch you up before you get there.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' replied Slyme.\r\n\r\nThis evening Slyme did not take the direct road home.  He turned into\r\nthe main street, and, pausing before the window of a toy shop, examined\r\nthe articles displayed therein attentively.  After some minutes he\r\nappeared to have come to a decision, and entering the shop he purchased\r\na baby\'s rattle for fourpence halfpenny.  It was a pretty toy made of\r\nwhite bone and coloured wool, with a number of little bells hanging\r\nupon it, and a ring of white bone at the end of the handle.\r\n\r\nWhen he came out of the shop Slyme set out for home, this time walking\r\nrapidly.  When he entered the house Ruth was sitting by the fire with\r\nthe baby on her lap.  She looked up with an expression of\r\ndisappointment as she perceived that he was alone.\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s Will got to again?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s gone to \'ave a drink with some of the chaps.  He said he wouldn\'t\r\nbe long,\' replied Slyme as he put his food basket on the dresser and\r\nwent upstairs to his room to wash and to change his clothes.\r\n\r\nWhen he came down again, Easton had not yet arrived.\r\n\r\n\'Everything\'s ready, except just to make the tea,\' said Ruth, who was\r\nevidently annoyed at the continued absence of Easton, \'so you may as\r\nwell have yours now.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m in no hurry.  I\'ll wait a little and see if he comes.  He\'s sure\r\nto be here soon.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you\'re sure you don\'t mind, I shall be glad if you will wait,\' said\r\nRuth, \'because it will save me making two lots of tea.\'\r\n\r\nThey waited for about half an hour, talking at intervals in a\r\nconstrained, awkward way about trivial subjects.  Then as Easton did\r\nnot come, Ruth decided to serve Slyme without waiting any longer. With\r\nthis intention she laid the baby in its cot, but the child resented\r\nthis arrangement and began to cry, so she had to hold him under her\r\nleft arm while she made the tea.  Seeing her in this predicament, Slyme\r\nexclaimed, holding out his hands:\r\n\r\n\'Here, let me hold him while you do that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you?\' said Ruth, who, in spite of her instinctive dislike of the\r\nman, could not help feeling gratified with this attention.  \'Well, mind\r\nyou don\'t let him fall.\'\r\n\r\nBut the instant Slyme took hold of the child it began to cry even\r\nlouder than it did when it was put into the cradle.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s always like that with strangers,\' apologized Ruth as she took him\r\nback again.\r\n\r\n\'Wait a minute,\' said Slyme, \'I\'ve got something upstairs in my pocket\r\nthat will keep him quiet.  I\'d forgotten all about it.\'\r\n\r\nHe went up to his room and presently returned with the rattle.  When\r\nthe baby saw the bright colours and heard the tinkling of the bells he\r\ncrowed with delight, and reached out his hands eagerly towards it and\r\nallowed Slyme to take him without a murmur of protest.  Before Ruth had\r\nfinished making and serving the tea the man and child were on the very\r\nbest of terms with each other, so much so indeed that when Ruth had\r\nfinished and went to take him again, the baby seemed reluctant to part\r\nfrom Slyme, who had been dancing him in the air and tickling him in the\r\nmost delightful way.\r\n\r\nRuth, too, began to have a better opinion of Slyme, and felt inclined\r\nto reproach herself for having taken such an unreasonable dislike of\r\nhim at first.  He was evidently a very good sort of fellow after all.\r\n\r\nThe baby had by this time discovered the use of the bone ring at the\r\nend of the handle of the toy and was biting it energetically.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a very beautiful rattle,\' said Ruth.  \'Thank you very much for\r\nit.  It\'s just the very thing he wanted.\'\r\n\r\n\'I heard you say the other day that he wanted something of the kind to\r\nbite on to help his teeth through,\' answered Slyme, \'and when I\r\nhappened to notice that in the shop I remembered what you said and\r\nthought I\'d bring it home.\'\r\n\r\nThe baby took the ring out of its mouth and shaking the rattle\r\nfrantically in the air laughed and crowed merrily, looking at Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'Dad! Dad! Dad!\' he cried, holding out his arms.\r\n\r\nSlyme and Ruth burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not your Dad, you silly boy,\' she said, kissing the child as\r\nshe spoke.  \'Your dad ought to be ashamed of himself for staying out\r\nlike this.  We\'ll give him dad, dad, dad, when he does come home, won\'t\r\nwe?\'\r\n\r\nBut the baby only shook the rattle and rang the bells and laughed and\r\ncrowed and laughed again, louder than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 19\r\n\r\nThe Filling of the Tank\r\n\r\n\r\nViewed from outside, the \'Cricketers Arms\' was a pretentious-looking\r\nbuilding with plate-glass windows and a profusion of gilding.  The\r\npilasters were painted in imitation of different marbles and the doors\r\ngrained to represent costly woods.  There were panels containing\r\npainted advertisements of wines and spirits and beer, written in gold,\r\nand ornamented with gaudy colours.  On the lintel over the principal\r\nentrance was inscribed in small white letters:\r\n\r\n\'A. Harpy.  Licensed to sell wines, spirits and malt liquor by retail\r\nto be consumed either on or off the premises.\'\r\n\r\nThe bar was arranged in the usual way, being divided into several\r\ncompartments.  First there was the \'Saloon Bar\': on the glass of the\r\ndoor leading into this was fixed a printed bill: \'No four ale served in\r\nthis bar.\'  Next to the saloon bar was the jug and bottle department,\r\nmuch appreciated by ladies who wished to indulge in a drop of gin on\r\nthe quiet.  There were also two small \'private\' bars, only capable of\r\nholding two or three persons, where nothing less than fourpennyworth of\r\nspirits or glasses of ale at threepence were served. Finally, the\r\npublic bar, the largest compartment of all.  At each end, separating it\r\nfrom the other departments, was a wooden partition, painted and\r\nvarnished.\r\n\r\nWooden forms fixed across the partitions and against the walls under\r\nthe windows provided seating accommodation for the customers.  A large\r\nautomatic musical instrument--a \'penny in the slot\'\r\npolyphone--resembling a grandfather\'s clock in shape--stood against one\r\nof the partitions and close up to the counter, so that those behind the\r\nbar could reach to wind it up.  Hanging on the partition near the\r\npolyphone was a board about fifteen inches square, over the surface of\r\nwhich were distributed a number of small hooks, numbered.  At the\r\nbottom of the board was a net made of fine twine, extended by means of\r\na semi-circular piece of wire.  In this net several india-rubber rings\r\nabout three inches in diameter were lying.  There was no table in the\r\nplace but jutting out from the other partition was a hinged flap about\r\nthree feet long by twenty inches wide, which could be folded down when\r\nnot in use.  This was the shove-ha\'penny board.  The coins--old French\r\npennies--used in playing this game were kept behind the bar and might\r\nbe borrowed on application.  On the partition, just above the\r\nshove-ha\'penny board was a neatly printed notice, framed and glazed:\r\n\r\n                                 NOTICE\r\n\r\n              Gentlemen using this house are requested to\r\n                 refrain from using obscene language.\r\n\r\nAlongside this notice were a number of gaudily-coloured bills\r\nadvertising the local theatre and the music-hall, and another of a\r\ntravelling circus and menagerie, then visiting the town and encamped on\r\na piece of waste ground about half-way on the road to Windley.  The\r\nfittings behind the bar, and the counter, were of polished mahogany,\r\nwith silvered plate glass at the back of the shelves.  On the shelves\r\nwere rows of bottles and cut-glass decanters, gin, whisky, brandy and\r\nwines and liqueurs of different kinds.\r\n\r\nWhen Crass, Philpot, Easton and Bundy entered, the landlord, a\r\nwell-fed, prosperous-looking individual in white shirt-sleeves, and a\r\nbright maroon fancy waistcoat with a massive gold watch-chain and a\r\ndiamond ring, was conversing in an affable, friendly way with one of\r\nhis regular customers, who was sitting on the end of the seat close to\r\nthe counter, a shabbily dressed, bleary-eyed, degraded, beer-sodden,\r\ntrembling wretch, who spent the greater part of every day, and all his\r\nmoney, in this bar.  He was a miserable-looking wreck of a man about\r\nthirty years of age, supposed to be a carpenter, although he never\r\nworked at that trade now.  It was commonly said that some years\r\npreviously he had married a woman considerably his senior, the landlady\r\nof a third-rate lodging-house.  This business was evidently\r\nsufficiently prosperous to enable him to exist without working and to\r\nmaintain himself in a condition of perpetual semi-intoxication.  This\r\nbesotted wretch practically lived at the \'Cricketers\'.  He came\r\nregularly very morning and sometimes earned a pint of beer by assisting\r\nthe barman to sweep up the sawdust or clean the windows.  He usually\r\nremained in the bar until closing time every night.  He was a very good\r\ncustomer; not only did he spend whatever money he could get hold of\r\nhimself, but he was the cause of others spending money, for he was\r\nacquainted with most of the other regular customers, who, knowing his\r\nimpecunious condition, often stood him a drink \'for the good of the\r\nhouse\'.\r\n\r\nThe only other occupant of the public bar--previous to the entrance of\r\nCrass and his mates--was a semi-drunken man, who appeared to be a\r\nhouse-painter, sitting on the form near the shove-ha\'penny board.  He\r\nwas wearing a battered bowler hat and the usual shabby clothes.  This\r\nindividual had a very thin, pale face, with a large, high-bridged nose,\r\nand bore a striking resemblance to the portraits of the first Duke of\r\nWellington.  He was not a regular customer here, having dropped in\r\ncasually about two o\'clock and had remained ever since.  He was\r\nbeginning to show the effects of the drink he had taken during that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs Crass and the others came in they were hailed with enthusiasm by the\r\nlandlord and the Besotted Wretch, while the semi-drunk workman regarded\r\nthem with fishy eyes and stupid curiosity.\r\n\r\n\'Wot cheer, Bob?\' said the landlord, affably, addressing Crass, and\r\nnodding familiarly to the others.  \'\'Ow goes it?\'\r\n\r\n\'All reet me ole dear!\' replied Crass, jovially.  \'\'Ow\'s yerself?\'\r\n\r\n\'A.1,\' replied the \'Old Dear\', getting up from his chair in readiness\r\nto execute their orders.\r\n\r\n\'Well, wot\'s it to be?\' inquired Philpot of the others generally.\r\n\r\n\'Mine\'s a pint o\' beer,\' said Crass.\r\n\r\n\'Half for me,\' said Bundy.\r\n\r\n\'Half o\' beer for me too,\' replied Easton.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s one pint, two \'arves, and a pint o\' porter for meself,\' said\r\nPhilpot, turning and addressing the Old Dear.\r\n\r\nWhile the landlord was serving these drinks the Besotted Wretch\r\nfinished his beer and set the empty glass down on the counter, and\r\nPhilpot observing this, said to him:\r\n\r\n\'\'Ave one along o\' me?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind if I do,\' replied the other.\r\n\r\nWhen the drinks were served, Philpot, instead of paying for them,\r\nwinked significantly at the landlord, who nodded silently and\r\nunobtrusively made an entry in an account book that was lying on one of\r\nthe shelves.  Although it was only Monday and he had been at work all\r\nthe previous week, Philpot was already stony broke.  This was accounted\r\nfor by the fact that on Saturday he had paid his landlady something on\r\naccount of the arrears of board and lodging money that had accumulated\r\nwhile he was out of work; and he had also paid the Old Dear four\r\nshillings for drinks obtained on tick during the last week.\r\n\r\n\'Well, \'ere\'s the skin orf yer nose,\' said Crass, nodding to Philpot,\r\nand taking a long pull at the pint glass which the latter had handed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSimilar appropriate and friendly sentiments were expressed by the\r\nothers and suitably acknowledged by Philpot, the founder of the feast.\r\n\r\nThe Old Dear now put a penny in the slot of the polyphone, and winding\r\nit up started it playing. It was some unfamiliar tune, but when the\r\nSemi-drunk Painter heard it he rose unsteadily to his feet and began\r\nshuffling and dancing about, singing:\r\n\r\n                \'Oh, we\'ll inwite you to the wedding,\r\n                   An\' we\'ll \'ave a glorious time!\r\n                Where the boys an\' girls is a-dancing,\r\n                  An\' we\'ll all get drunk on wine.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere! that\'s quite enough o\' that!\' cried the landlord, roughly.  \'We\r\ndon\'t want that row \'ere.\'\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk stopped, and looking stupidly at the Old Dear, sank\r\nabashed on to the seat again.\r\n\r\n\'Well, we may as well sit as stand--for a few minutes,\' remarked Crass,\r\nsuiting the action to the word.  The others followed his example.\r\n\r\nAt frequent intervals the bar was entered by fresh customers, most of\r\nthem working men on their way home, who ordered and drank their pint or\r\nhalf-pint of ale or porter and left at once.  Bundy began reading the\r\nadvertisement of the circus and menageries and a conversation ensued\r\nconcerning the wonderful performances of the trained animals. The Old\r\nDear said that some of them had as much sense as human beings, and the\r\nmanner with which he made this statement implied that he thought it was\r\na testimonial to the sagacity of the brutes.  He further said that he\r\nhad heard--a little earlier in the evening--a rumour that one of the\r\nwild animals, a bear or something, had broken loose and was at present\r\nat large.  This was what he had heard--he didn\'t know if it were true\r\nor not.  For his own part he didn\'t believe it, and his hearers agreed\r\nthat it was highly improbable. Nobody ever knew how these silly yarns\r\ngot about.\r\n\r\nPresently the Besotted Wretch got up and, taking the india-rubber rings\r\nout of the net with a trembling hand, began throwing them one at a time\r\nat the hooks on the board.  The rest of the company watched him with\r\nmuch interest, laughing when he made a very bad shot and applauding\r\nwhen he scored.\r\n\r\n\'\'E\'s a bit orf tonight,\' remarked Philpot aside to Easton, \'but as a\r\nrule \'e\'s a fair knockout at it.  Throws a splendid ring.\'\r\n\r\nThe Semidrunk regarded the proceedings of the Besotted Wretch with an\r\nexpression of profound contempt.\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t play for nuts,\' he said scornfully.\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t I?  I can play you, anyway.\'\r\n\r\n\'Right you are!  I\'ll play you for drinks round!\' cried the Semi-drunk.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the Besotted Wretch hesitated.  He had not money enough to\r\npay for drinks round.  However, feeling confident of winning, he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\'Come on then.  What\'s it to be?  Fifty up?\'\r\n\r\n\'Anything you like!  Fifty or a \'undred or a bloody million!\'\r\n\r\n\'Better make it fifty for a start.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right!\'\r\n\r\n\'You play first if you like.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' agreed the Semi-drunk, anxious to distinguish himself.\r\nHolding the six rings in his left hand, the man stood in the middle of\r\nthe floor at a distance of about three yards from the board, with his\r\nright foot advanced.  Taking one of the rings between the forefinger\r\nand thumb of his right hand, and closing his left eye, he carefully\r\n\'sighted\' the centre hook, No. 13; then he slowly extended his arm to\r\nits full length in the direction of the board: then bending his elbow,\r\nhe brought his hand back again until it nearly touched his chin, and\r\nslowly extended his arm again.  He repeated these movements several\r\ntimes, whilst the others watched with bated breath.  Getting it right\r\nat last he suddenly shot the ring at the board, but it did not go on\r\nNo. 13; it went over the partition into the private bar.\r\n\r\nThis feat was greeted with a roar of laughter.  The player stared at\r\nthe board in a dazed way, wondering what had become of the ring.  When\r\nsomeone in the next bar threw it over the partition again, he realized\r\nwhat had happened and, turning to the company with a sickly smile,\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t got properly used to this board yet: that\'s the reason of it.\'\r\n\r\nHe now began throwing the other rings at the board rather wildly,\r\nwithout troubling to take aim.  One struck the partition to the right\r\nof the board: one to the left: one underneath: one went over the\r\ncounter, one on the floor, the other--the last--hit the board, and amid\r\na shout of applause, caught on the centre hook No. 13, the highest\r\nnumber it was possible to score with a single throw.\r\n\r\n\'I shall be all right now that I\'ve got the range,\' observed the\r\nSemi-drunk as he made way for his opponent.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll see something now,\' whispered Philpot to Easton. \'This bloke is\r\na dandy!\'\r\n\r\nThe Besotted Wretch took up his position and with an affectation of\r\ncarelessness began throwing the rings.  It was really a remarkable\r\nexhibition, for notwithstanding the fact that his hand trembled like\r\nthe proverbial aspen leaf, he succeeded in striking the board almost in\r\nthe centre every time; but somehow or other most of them failed to\r\ncatch on the hooks and fell into the net.  When he finished his\r\ninnings, he had only scored 4, two of the rings having caught on the\r\nNo. 2 hook.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ard lines,\' remarked Bundy as he finished his beer and put the glass\r\ndown on the counter.\r\n\r\n\'Drink up and \'ave another,\' said Easton as he drained his own glass.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind if I do,\' replied Crass, pouring what remained of the\r\npint down his throat.\r\n\r\nPhilpot\'s glass had been empty for some time.\r\n\r\n\'Same again,\' said Easton, addressing the Old Dear and putting six\r\npennies on the counter.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Semi-drunk had again opened fire on the board, but he\r\nseemed to have lost the range, for none of the rings scored.\r\n\r\nThey flew all over the place, and he finished his innings without\r\nincreasing his total.\r\n\r\nThe Besotted Wretch now sailed in and speedily piled up 37.  Then the\r\nSemi-drunk had another go, and succeeded in getting 8.  His case\r\nappeared hopeless, but his opponent in his next innings seemed to go\r\nall to pieces.  Twice he missed the board altogether, and when he did\r\nhit it he failed to score, until the very last throw, when he made 1.\r\nThen the Semi-drunk went in again and got 10.\r\n\r\nThe scores were now:\r\n\r\n        Besotted Wretch ........................ 42\r\n        Semi-drunk ............................. 31\r\n\r\nSo far it was impossible to foresee the end.  It was anybody\'s game.\r\nCrass became so excited that he absentmindedly opened his mouth and\r\nshot his second pint down into his stomach with a single gulp, and\r\nBundy also drained his glass and called upon Philpot and Easton to\r\ndrink up and have another, which they accordingly did.\r\n\r\nWhile the Semi-drunk was having his next innings, the Besotted Wretch\r\nplaced a penny on the counter and called for a half a pint, which he\r\ndrank in the hope of steadying his nerves for a great effort.  His\r\nopponent meanwhile threw the rings at the board and missed it every\r\ntime, but all the same he scored, for one ring, after striking the\r\npartition about a foot above the board, fell down and caught on the\r\nhook.\r\n\r\nThe other man now began his innings, playing very carefully, and nearly\r\nevery ring scored. As he played, the others uttered exclamations of\r\nadmiration and called out the result of every throw.\r\n\r\n\'One!\'\r\n\r\n\'One again!\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss!  No!  Got \'im!  Two!\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss!\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss!\'\r\n\r\n\'Four!\'\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk accepted his defeat with a good grace, and after\r\nexplaining that he was a bit out of practice, placed a shilling on the\r\ncounter and invited the company to give their orders.  Everyone asked\r\nfor \'the same again,\' but the landlord served Easton, Bundy and the\r\nBesotted Wretch with pints instead of half-pints as before, so there\r\nwas no change out of the shilling.\r\n\r\n\'You know, there\'s a great deal in not bein\' used to the board,\' said\r\nthe Semi-drunk.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no disgrace in bein\' beat by a man like \'im, mate,\' said\r\nPhilpot.  \'\'E\'s a champion!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, there\'s no mistake about it.  \'E throws a splendid ring!\' said\r\nBundy.\r\n\r\nThis was the general verdict.  The Semi-drunk, though beaten, was not\r\ndisgraced: and he was so affected by the good feeling manifested by the\r\ncompany that he presently produced a sixpence and insisted on paying\r\nfor another half-pint all round.\r\n\r\nCrass had gone outside during this conversation, but he returned in a\r\nfew minutes.  \'I feel a bit easier now,\' he remarked with a laugh as he\r\ntook the half-pint glass that the Semi-drunk passed to him with a\r\nshaking hand.  One after the other, within a few minutes, the rest\r\nfollowed Crass\'s example, going outside and returning almost\r\nimmediately: and as Bundy, who was the last to return, came back he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s \'ave a game of shove-\'a\'penny.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Easton, who was beginning to feel reckless.  \'But\r\ndrink up first, and let\'s \'ave another.\'\r\n\r\nHe had only sevenpence left, just enough to pay for another pint for\r\nCrass and half a pint for everyone else.\r\n\r\nThe shove-ha\'penny table was a planed mahogany board with a number of\r\nparallel lines scored across it.  The game is played by placing the\r\ncoin at the end of the board--the rim slightly overhanging the\r\nedge--and striking it with the back part of the palm of the hand,\r\nregulating the force of the blow according to the distance it is\r\ndesired to drive the coin.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s become of Alf tonight?\' inquired Philpot of the landlord whilst\r\nEaston and Bundy were playing.  Alf was the barman.\r\n\r\n\'\'E\'s doing a bit of a job down in the cellar; some of the valves gone\r\na bit wrong.  But the missus is comin\' down to lend me a hand\r\npresently.  \'Ere she is now.\'\r\n\r\nThe landlady--who at this moment entered through the door at the back\r\nof the bar--was a large woman with a highly-coloured countenance and a\r\ntremendous bust, incased in a black dress with a shot silk blouse. She\r\nhad several jewelled gold rings on the fingers of each fat white hand,\r\nand a long gold watch guard hung round her fat neck.  She greeted Crass\r\nand Philpot with condescension, smiling affably upon them.\r\n\r\nMeantime the game of shove-ha\'penny proceeded merrily, the Semi-drunk\r\ntaking a great interest in it and tendering advice to both players\r\nimpartially.  Bundy was badly beaten, and then Easton suggested that it\r\nwas time to think of going home.  This proposal--slightly modified--met\r\nwith general approval, the modification being suggested by Philpot, who\r\ninsisted on standing one final round of drinks before they went.\r\n\r\nWhile they were pouring this down their throats, Crass took a penny\r\nfrom his waistcoat pocket and put it in the slot of the polyphone. The\r\nlandlord put a fresh disc into it and wound it up and it began to play\r\n\'The Boys of the Bulldog Breed.\'  The Semi-drunk happened to know the\r\nwords of the chorus of this song, and when he heard the music he\r\nstarted unsteadily to his feet and with many fierce looks and gestures\r\nbegan to roar at the top of his voice:\r\n\r\n        \'They may build their ships, my lads,\r\n        And try to play the game,\r\n        But they can\'t build the boys of the Bulldog breed,\r\n        Wot made ole Hingland\'s--\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere! Stop that, will yer?\' cried the Old Dear, fiercely.  \'I told you\r\nonce before that I don\'t allow that sort of thing in my \'ouse!\'\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk stopped in confusion.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mean no \'arm,\' he said unsteadily, appealing to the company.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want no chin from you!\' said the Old Dear with a ferocious\r\nscowl.  \'If you want to make that row you can go somewheres else, and\r\nthe sooner you goes the better.  You\'ve been \'ere long enough.\'\r\n\r\nThis was true.  The man had been there long enough to spend every penny\r\nhe had been possessed of when he first came: he had no money left now,\r\na fact that the observant and experienced landlord had divined some\r\ntime ago.  He therefore wished to get rid of the fellow before the\r\ndrink affected him further and made him helplessly drunk. The\r\nSemi-drunk listened with indignation and wrath to the landlord\'s\r\ninsulting words.\r\n\r\n\'I shall go when the bloody \'ell I like!\' he shouted.  \'I shan\'t ask\r\nyou nor nobody else!  Who the bloody \'ell are you?  You\'re nobody! See?\r\nNobody!  It\'s orf the likes of me that you gets your bloody livin\'!  I\r\nshall stop \'ere as long as I bloody well like, and if you don\'t like it\r\nyou can go to \'ell!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!  Yer will, will yer?\' said the Old Dear.  \'We\'ll soon see about\r\nthat.\'  And, opening the door at the back of the bar, he roared out:\r\n\r\n\'Alf!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' replied a voice, evidently from the basement.\r\n\r\n\'Just come up \'ere.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' replied the voice, and footsteps were heard ascending some\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll see some fun in a minute,\' gleefully remarked Crass to Easton.\r\n\r\nThe polyphone continued to play \'The Boys of the Bulldog Breed.\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot crossed over to the Semi-drunk.  \'Look \'ere, old man,\' he\r\nwhispered, \'take my tip and go \'ome quietly.  You\'ll only git the worse\r\nof it, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not me, mate,\' replied the other, shaking his head doggedly.  \'\'Ere I\r\nam, and \'ere I\'m goin\' to bloody well stop.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, you ain\'t,\' replied Philpot coaxingly. \'\'Look \'ere. I\'ll tell you\r\nwot we\'ll do.  You \'ave just one more \'arf-pint along of me, and then\r\nwe\'ll both go \'ome together.  I\'ll see you safe \'ome.\'\r\n\r\n\'See me safe \'ome! Wotcher mean?\' indignantly demanded the other.  \'Do\r\nyou think I\'m drunk or wot?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  Certainly not,\' replied Philpot, hastily.  \'You\'re all right, as\r\nright as I am myself.  But you know wot I mean.  Let\'s go \'ome.  You\r\ndon\'t want to stop \'ere all night, do you?\'\r\n\r\nBy this time Alf had arrived at the door of the back of the bar.  He\r\nwas a burly young man about twenty-two or twenty-three years of age.\r\n\r\n\'Put it outside,\' growled the landlord, indicating the culprit.\r\n\r\nThe barman instantly vaulted over the counter, and, having opened wide\r\nthe door leading into the street, he turned to the half-drunken man\r\nand, jerking his thumb in the direction of the door, said:\r\n\r\n\'Are yer goin\'?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m goin\' to \'ave \'arf a pint along of this genelman first--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  It\'s all right,\' said Philpot to the landlord.  \'Let\'s \'ave two\r\n\'arf-pints, and say no more about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'You mind your own business,\' shouted the landlord, turning savagely on\r\nhim.  \'\'E\'ll get no more \'ere!  I don\'t want no drunken men in my\r\n\'ouse.  Who asked you to interfere?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now then!\' exclaimed the barman to the cause of the trouble, \'Outside!\'\r\n\r\n\'Not me!\' said the Semi-drunk firmly.  \'Not before I\'ve \'ad my \'arf--\'\r\n\r\nBut before he could conclude, the barman had clutched him by the\r\ncollar, dragged him violently to the door and shot him into the middle\r\nof the road, where he fell in a heap almost under the wheels of a\r\nbrewer\'s dray that happened to be passing.  This accomplished, Alf shut\r\nthe door and retired behind the counter again.\r\n\r\n\'Serve \'im bloody well right,\' said Crass.\r\n\r\n\'I couldn\'t \'elp laughin\' when I seen \'im go flyin\' through the bloody\r\ndoor,\' said Bundy.\r\n\r\n\'You oughter \'ave more sense than to go interferin\' like that,\' said\r\nCrass to Philpot.  \'It was nothing to do with you.\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot made no reply.  He was standing with his back to the others,\r\npeeping out into the street over the top of the window casing.  Then he\r\nopened the door and went out into the street.  Crass and the\r\nothers--through the window--watched him assist the Semi-drunk to his\r\nfeet and rub some of the dirt off his clothes, and presently after some\r\nargument they saw the two go away together arm in arm.\r\n\r\nCrass and the others laughed, and returned to their half-finished\r\ndrinks.\r\n\r\n\'Why, old Joe ain\'t drunk \'ardly \'arf of \'is!\' cried Easton, seeing\r\nPhilpot\'s porter on the counter.  \'Fancy going away like that!\'\r\n\r\n\'More fool \'im,\' growled Crass.  \'There was no need for it: the man\'s\r\nall right.\'\r\n\r\nThe Besotted Wretch gulped his beer down as quickly as he could, with\r\nhis eyes fixed greedily on Philpot\'s glass. He had just finished his\r\nown and was about to suggest that it was a pity to waste the porter\r\nwhen Philpot unexpectedly reappeared.\r\n\r\n\'Hullo!  What \'ave you done with \'im?\' inquired Crass.\r\n\r\n\'I think \'e\'ll be all right,\' replied Philpot.  \'He wouldn\'t let me go\r\nno further with \'im: said if I didn\'t go away, \'e\'d go for me!  But I\r\nbelieve \'e\'ll be all right.  I think the fall sobered \'im a bit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, \'e\'s all right,\' said Crass offhandedly.  \'There\'s nothing the\r\nmatter with \'im.\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot now drank his porter, and bidding \'good night\' to the Old Dear,\r\nthe landlady and the Besotted Wretch, they all set out for home. As\r\nthey went along the dark and lonely thoroughfare that led over the hill\r\nto Windley, they heard from time to time the weird roaring of the wild\r\nanimals in the menagerie that was encamped in the adjacent field. Just\r\nas they reached a very gloomy and deserted part, they suddenly observed\r\na dark object in the middle of the road some distance in front of them.\r\nIt seemed to be a large animal of some kind and was coming slowly and\r\nstealthily towards them.\r\n\r\nThey stopped, peering in a half-frightened way through the darkness.\r\nThe animal continued to approach.  Bundy stooped down to the ground,\r\ngroping about in search of a stone, and--with the exception of Crass,\r\nwho was too frightened to move--the others followed his example. They\r\nfound several large stones and stood waiting for the creature--whatever\r\nit was--to come a little nearer so as to get a fair shot at it.  They\r\nwere about to let fly when the creature fell over on its side and\r\nmoaned as if in pain.  Observing this, the four men advanced cautiously\r\ntowards it.  Bundy struck a match and held it over the prostrate\r\nfigure.  It was the Semi-drunk.\r\n\r\nAfter parting from Philpot, the poor wretch had managed to walk all\r\nright for some distance.  As Philpot had remarked, the fall had to some\r\nextent sobered him; but he had not gone very far before the drink he\r\nhad taken began to affect him again and he had fallen down. Finding it\r\nimpossible to get up, he began crawling along on his hands and knees,\r\nunconscious of the fact that he was travelling in the wrong direction.\r\nEven this mode of progression failed him at last, and he would probably\r\nhave been run over if they had not found him.  They raised him up, and\r\nPhilpot, exhorting him to \'pull himself together\' inquired where he\r\nlived.  The man had sense enough left to be able to tell them his\r\naddress, which was fortunately at Windley, where they all resided.\r\n\r\nBundy and Philpot took him home, separating from Crass and Easton at\r\nthe corner of the street where both the latter lived.\r\n\r\nCrass felt very full and satisfied with himself. He had had six and a\r\nhalf pints of beer, and had listened to two selections on the polyphone\r\nat a total cost of one penny.\r\n\r\nEaston had but a few yards to go before reaching his own house after\r\nparting from Crass, but he paused directly he heard the latter\'s door\r\nclose, and leaning against a street lamp yielded to the feeling of\r\ngiddiness and nausea that he had been fighting against all the way\r\nhome.  All the inanimate objects around him seemed to be in motion. The\r\nlights of the distant street lamps appeared to be floating about the\r\npavement and the roadway rose and fell like the surface of a troubled\r\nsea.  He searched his pockets for his handkerchief and having found it\r\nwiped his mouth, inwardly congratulating himself that Crass was not\r\nthere to see him.  Resuming his walk, after a few minutes he reached\r\nhis own home.  As he passed through, the gate closed of itself after\r\nhim, clanging loudly.  He went rather unsteadily up the narrow path\r\nthat led to his front door and entered.\r\n\r\nThe baby was asleep in the cradle.  Slyme had gone up to his own room,\r\nand Ruth was sitting sewing by the fireside.  The table was still set\r\nfor two persons, for she had not yet taken her tea.\r\n\r\nEaston lurched in noisily.  \'\'Ello, old girl!\' he cried, throwing his\r\ndinner basket carelessly on the floor with an affectation of joviality\r\nand resting his hands on the table to support himself.  \'I\'ve come at\r\nlast, you see.\'\r\n\r\nRuth left off sewing, and, letting her hands fall into her lap, sat\r\nlooking at him.  She had never seen him like this before.  His face was\r\nghastly pale, the eyes bloodshot and red-rimmed, the lips tremulous and\r\nmoist, and the ends of the hair of his fair moustache, stuck together\r\nwith saliva and stained with beer, hung untidily round his mouth in\r\ndamp clusters.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that she did not speak or smile, Easton concluded that she\r\nwas angry and became grave himself.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve come at last, you see, my dear; better late than never.\'\r\n\r\nHe found it very difficult to speak plainly, for his lips trembled and\r\nrefused to form the words.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know so much about that,\' said Ruth, inclined to cry and\r\ntrying not to let him see the pity she could not help feeling for him.\r\n\'A nice state you\'re in.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\'\r\n\r\nEaston shook his head and laughed foolishly.  \'Don\'t be angry, Ruth.\r\nIt\'s no good, you know.\'\r\n\r\nHe walked clumsily towards her, still leaning on the table to steady\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be angry,\' he mumbled as he stooped over her, putting his arm\r\nround her neck and his face close to hers.  \'It\'s no good being angry,\r\nyou know, dear.\'\r\n\r\nShe shrank away, shuddering with involuntary disgust as he pressed his\r\nwet lips and filthy moustache upon her mouth.  His fetid breath, foul\r\nwith the smell of tobacco and beer, and the odour of the stale tobacco\r\nsmoke that exuded from his clothes filled her with loathing.  He kissed\r\nher repeatedly and when at last he released her she hastily wiped her\r\nface with her handkerchief and shivered.\r\n\r\nEaston said he did not want any tea, and went upstairs to bed almost\r\nimmediately.  Ruth did not want any tea either now, although she had\r\nbeen very hungry before he came home.  She sat up very late, sewing,\r\nand when at length she did go upstairs she found him lying on his back,\r\npartly undressed on the outside of the bedclothes, with his mouth wide\r\nopen, breathing stertorously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 20\r\n\r\nThe Forty Thieves.  The Battle: Brigands versus Bandits\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an even more unusually dull and uninteresting chapter, and\r\nintroduces several matters that may appear to have nothing to do with\r\nthe case.  The reader is nevertheless entreated to peruse it, because\r\nit contains certain information necessary to an understanding of this\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe town of Mugsborough was governed by a set of individuals called the\r\nMunicipal Council.  Most of these \'representatives of the people\' were\r\nwell-to-do or retired tradesmen.  In the opinion of the inhabitants of\r\nMugsborough, the fact that a man had succeeded in accumulating money in\r\nbusiness was a clear demonstration of his fitness to be entrusted with\r\nthe business of the town.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when that very able and successful man of business Mr\r\nGeorge Rushton was put up for election to the Council he was returned\r\nby a large majority of the votes of the working men who thought him an\r\nideal personage...\r\n\r\nThese Brigands did just as they pleased.  No one ever interfered with\r\nthem.  They never consulted the ratepayers in any way.  Even at\r\nelection time they did not trouble to hold meetings: each one of them\r\njust issued a kind of manifesto setting forth his many noble qualities\r\nand calling upon the people for their votes: and the latter never\r\nfailed to respond.  They elected the same old crew time after time...\r\n\r\nThe Brigands committed their depredations almost unhindered, for the\r\nvoters were engaged in the Battle of Life.  Take the public park for\r\ninstance.  Like so many swine around a trough--they were so busily\r\nengaged in this battle that most of them had no time to go to the park,\r\nor they might have noticed that there were not so many costly plants\r\nthere as there should have been.  And if they had inquired further they\r\nwould have discovered that nearly all the members of the Town Council\r\nhad very fine gardens.  There was reason for these gardens being so\r\ngrand, for the public park was systematically robbed of its best to\r\nmake them so.\r\n\r\nThere was a lake in the park where large numbers of ducks and geese\r\nwere kept at the ratepayers\' expense.  In addition to the food provided\r\nfor these fowl with public money, visitors to the park used to bring\r\nthem bags of biscuits and bread crusts.  When the ducks and geese were\r\nnicely fattened the Brigands used to carry them off and devour them at\r\nhome.  When they became tired of eating duck or goose, some of the\r\nCouncillors made arrangements with certain butchers and traded away the\r\nbirds for meat.\r\n\r\nOne of the most energetic members of the Band was Mr Jeremiah Didlum,\r\nthe house-furnisher, who did a large hire system trade.  He had an\r\nextensive stock of second-hand furniture that he had resumed possession\r\nof when the unfortunate would-be purchasers failed to pay the\r\ninstalments regularly.  Other of the second-hand things had been\r\npurchased for a fraction of their real value at Sheriff\'s sales or from\r\npeople whom misfortune or want of employment had reduced to the\r\nnecessity of selling their household possessions.\r\n\r\nAnother notable member of the Band was Mr Amos Grinder, who had\r\npractically monopolized the greengrocery trade and now owned nearly all\r\nthe fruiterers\' shops in the town.  As for the other shops, if they did\r\nnot buy their stocks from him--or, rather, the company of which he was\r\nmanaging director and principal shareholder--if these other fruiterers\r\nand greengrocers did not buy their stuff from his company, he tried to\r\nsmash them by opening branches in their immediate neighbourhood and\r\nselling below cost.  He was a self-made man: an example of what may be\r\naccomplished by cunning and selfishness.\r\n\r\nThen there was the Chief of the Band--Mr Adam Sweater, the Mayor.  He\r\nwas always the Chief, although he was not always Mayor, it being the\r\nrule that the latter \'honour\' should be enjoyed by all the members of\r\nthe Band in turn.  A bright \'honour\', forsooth! to be the first citizen\r\nin a community composed for the most part of ignorant semi-imbeciles,\r\nslaves, slave-drivers and psalm-singing hypocrites. Mr Sweater was the\r\nmanaging director and principal shareholder of a large drapery business\r\nin which he had amassed a considerable fortune. This was not very\r\nsurprising, considering that he paid none of his workpeople fair wages\r\nand many of them no wages at all.  He employed a great number of girls\r\nand young women who were supposed to be learning dressmaking,\r\nmantle-making or millinery.  These were all indentured apprentices,\r\nsome of whom had paid premiums of from five to ten pounds.  They were\r\n\'bound\' for three years.  For the first two years they received no\r\nwages: the third year they got a shilling or eightpence a week.  At the\r\nend of the third year they usually got the sack, unless they were\r\nwilling to stay on as improvers at from three shillings to four and\r\nsixpence per week.\r\n\r\nThey worked from half past eight in the morning till eight at night,\r\nwith an interval of an hour for dinner, and at half past four they\r\nceased work for fifteen minutes for tea.  This was provided by the\r\nfirm--half a pint for each girl, but they had to bring their own milk\r\nand sugar and bread and butter.\r\n\r\nFew of the girls ever learned their trades thoroughly.  Some were\r\ntaught to make sleeves; others cuffs or button-holes, and so on.  The\r\nresult was that in a short time each one became very expert and quick\r\nat one thing; and although their proficiency in this one thing would\r\nnever enable them to earn a decent living, it enabled Mr Sweater to\r\nmake money during the period of their apprenticeship, and that was all\r\nhe cared about.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a girl of intelligence and spirit would insist on the\r\nfulfilment of the terms of her indentures, and sometimes the parents\r\nwould protest.  If this were persisted in those girls got on better:\r\nbut even these were turned to good account by the wily Sweater, who\r\ninduced the best of them to remain after their time was up by paying\r\nthem what appeared--by contrast with the others girls\' money--good\r\nwages, sometimes even seven or eight shillings a week! and liberal\r\npromises of future advancement.  These girls then became a sort of\r\nreserve who could be called up to crush any manifestation of discontent\r\non the part of the leading hands.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the girls, however, submitted tamely to the\r\nconditions imposed upon them.  They were too young to realize the wrong\r\nthat was being done them.  As for their parents, it never occurred to\r\nthem to doubt the sincerity of so good a man as Mr Sweater, who was\r\nalways prominent in every good and charitable work.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of the girl\'s apprenticeship, if the parents\r\ncomplained of her want of proficiency, the pious Sweater would\r\nattribute it to idleness or incapacity, and as the people were\r\ngenerally poor he seldom or never had any trouble with them.  This was\r\nhow he fulfilled the unctuous promise made to the confiding parents at\r\nthe time the girl was handed over to his tender mercy--that he would\r\n\'make a woman of her\'.\r\n\r\nThis method of obtaining labour by false pretences and without payment,\r\nwhich enabled him to produce costly articles for a mere fraction of the\r\nprice for which they were eventually sold, was adopted in other\r\ndepartments of his business.  He procured shop assistants of both sexes\r\non the same terms.  A youth was indentured, usually for five years, to\r\nbe \'Made a Man of and \'Turned out fit to take a Position in any House\'.\r\nIf possible, a premium, five, ten, or twenty pounds--according to their\r\ncircumstances--would be extracted from the parents.  For the first\r\nthree years, no wages: after that, perhaps two or three shillings a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the five years the work of \'Making a Man of him\' would be\r\ncompleted.  Mr Sweater would then congratulate him and assure him that\r\nhe was qualified to assume a \'position\' in any House but regret that\r\nthere was no longer any room for him in his.  Business was so bad.\r\nStill, if the Man wished he might stay on until he secured a better\r\n\'position\' and, as a matter of generosity, although he did not really\r\nneed the Man\'s services, he would pay him ten shillings per week!\r\n\r\nProvided he was not addicted to drinking, smoking, gambling or the\r\nStock Exchange, or going to theatres, the young man\'s future was thus\r\nassured.  Even if he were unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain another\r\nposition he could save a portion of his salary and eventually commence\r\nbusiness on his own account.\r\n\r\nHowever, the branch of Mr Sweater\'s business to which it is desired to\r\nespecially direct the reader\'s attention was the Homeworkers\r\nDepartment.  He employed a large number of women making ladies\'\r\nblouses, fancy aprons and children\'s pinafores.  Most of these articles\r\nwere disposed of wholesale in London and elsewhere, but some were\r\nretailed at \'Sweaters\' Emporium\' in Mugsborough and at the firm\'s other\r\nretail establishments throughout the county.  Many of the women workers\r\nwere widows with children, who were glad to obtain any employment that\r\ndid not take them away from their homes and families.\r\n\r\nThe blouses were paid for at the rate of from two shillings to five\r\nshillings a dozen, the women having to provide their own machine and\r\ncotton, besides calling for and delivering the work.  These poor women\r\nwere able to clear from six to eight shillings a week: and to earn even\r\nthat they had to work almost incessantly for fourteen or sixteen hours\r\na day.  There was no time for cooking and very little to cook, for they\r\nlived principally on bread and margarine and tea.  Their homes were\r\nsqualid, their children half-starved and raggedly clothed in grotesque\r\ngarments hastily fashioned out of the cast-off clothes of charitable\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nBut it was not in vain that these women toiled every weary day until\r\nexhaustion compelled them to cease.  It was not in vain that they passed\r\ntheir cheerless lives bending with aching shoulders over the thankless\r\nwork that barely brought them bread.  It was not in vain that they and\r\ntheir children went famished and in rags, for after all, the principal\r\nobject of their labour was accomplished: the Good Cause was advanced.\r\nMr Sweater waxed rich and increased in goods and respectability.\r\n\r\nOf course, none of those women were COMPELLED to engage in that\r\nglorious cause.  No one is compelled to accept any particular set of\r\nconditions in a free country like this.  Mr Trafaim--the manager of\r\nSweater\'s Homework Department--always put the matter before them in the\r\nplainest, fairest possible way.  There was the work: that was the\r\nfigure!  And those who didn\'t like it could leave it.  There was no\r\ncompulsion.\r\n\r\nSometimes some perverse creature belonging to that numerous class who\r\nare too lazy to work DID leave it!  But as the manager said, there were\r\nplenty of others who were only too glad to take it.  In fact, such was\r\nthe enthusiasm amongst these women--especially such of them as had\r\nlittle children to provide for--and such was their zeal for the Cause,\r\nthat some of them have been known to positively beg to be allowed to\r\nwork!\r\n\r\nBy these and similar means Adam Sweater had contrived to lay up for\r\nhimself a large amount of treasure upon earth, besides attaining\r\nundoubted respectability; for that he was respectable no one\r\nquestioned.  He went to chapel twice every Sunday, his obese figure\r\narrayed in costly apparel, consisting--with other things--of grey\r\ntrousers, a long garment called a frock-coat, a tall silk hat, a\r\nquantity of jewellery and a morocco-bound gilt-edged Bible.  He was an\r\nofficial of some sort of the Shining Light Chapel.  His name appeared\r\nin nearly every published list of charitable subscriptions.  No\r\nstarving wretch had ever appealed to him in vain for a penny soup\r\nticket.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that when this good and public-spirited man offered his\r\nservices to the town--free of charge--the intelligent working men of\r\nMugsborough accepted his offer with enthusiastic applause.  The fact\r\nthat he had made money in business was a proof of his intellectual\r\ncapacity.  His much-advertised benevolence was a guarantee that his\r\nabilities would be used to further not his own private interests, but\r\nthe interests of every section of the community, especially those of\r\nthe working classes, of whom the majority of his constituents was\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nAs for the shopkeepers, they were all so absorbed in their own\r\nbusiness--so busily engaged chasing their employees, adding up their\r\naccounts, and dressing themselves up in feeble imitation of the\r\n\'Haristocracy\'--that they were incapable of taking a really intelligent\r\ninterest in anything else.  They thought of the Town Council as a kind\r\nof Paradise reserved exclusively for jerry-builders and successful\r\ntradesmen.  Possibly, some day, if they succeeded in making money, they\r\nmight become town councillors themselves! but in the meantime public\r\naffairs were no particular concern of theirs.  So some of them voted\r\nfor Adam Sweater because he was a Liberal and some of them voted\r\nagainst him for the same \'reason\'.\r\n\r\nNow and then, when details of some unusually scandalous proceeding of\r\nthe Council\'s leaked out, the townspeople--roused for a brief space\r\nfrom their customary indifference--would discuss the matter in a\r\ncasual, half-indignant, half-amused, helpless sort of way; but always\r\nas if it were something that did not directly concern them.  It was\r\nduring some such nine days\' wonder that the title of \'The Forty\r\nThieves\' was bestowed on the members of the Council by their\r\nsemi-imbecile constituents, who, not possessing sufficient intelligence\r\nto devise means of punishing the culprits, affected to regard the\r\nmanoeuvres of the Brigands as a huge joke.\r\n\r\nThere was only one member of the Council who did not belong to the\r\nBand--Councillor Weakling, a retired physician; but unfortunately he\r\nalso was a respectable man.  When he saw something going forwards that\r\nhe did not think was right, he protested and voted against it and\r\nthen--he collapsed!  There was nothing of the low agitator about HIM.\r\nAs for the Brigands, they laughed at his protests and his vote did not\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWith this one exception, the other members of the band were very\r\nsimilar in character to Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder.  They had\r\nall joined the Band with the same objects, self-glorification and the\r\nadvancement of their private interests.  These were the real reasons\r\nwhy they besought the ratepayers to elect them to the Council, but of\r\ncourse none of them ever admitted that such was the case.  No! When\r\nthese noble-minded altruists offered their services to the town they\r\nasked the people to believe that they were actuated by a desire to give\r\ntheir time and abilities for the purpose of furthering the interests of\r\nOthers, which was much the same as asking them to believe that it is\r\npossible for the leopard to change his spots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the extraordinary apathy of the other inhabitants, the\r\nBrigands were able to carry out their depredations undisturbed.\r\nDaylight robberies were of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nFor many years these Brigands had looked with greedy eyes upon the huge\r\nprofits of the Gas Company.  They thought it was a beastly shame that\r\nthose other bandits should be always raiding the town and getting clear\r\naway with such rich spoils.\r\n\r\nAt length--about two years ago--after much study and many private\r\nconsultations, a plan of campaign was evolved; a secret council of war\r\nwas held, presided over by Mr Sweater, and the Brigands formed\r\nthemselves into an association called \'The Mugsborough Electric Light\r\nSupply and Installation Coy. Ltd.\', and bound themselves by a solemn\r\noath to do their best to drive the Gas Works Bandits out of the town\r\nand to capture the spoils at present enjoyed by the latter for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThere was a large piece of ground, the property of the town, that was a\r\nsuitable site for the works; so in their character of directors of the\r\nElectric Light Coy. they offered to buy this land from the\r\nMunicipality--or, in other words, from themselves--for about half its\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Town Council when this offer was considered, all\r\nthe members present, with the solitary exception of Dr Weakling, being\r\nshareholders in the newly formed company, Councillor Rushton moved a\r\nresolution in favour of accepting it.  He said that every encouragement\r\nshould be given to the promoters of the Electric Light Coy., those\r\npublic-spirited citizens who had come forward and were willing to risk\r\ntheir capital in an undertaking that would be a benefit to every class\r\nof residents in the town that they all loved so well.  (Applause.)\r\nThere could be no doubt that the introduction of the electric light\r\nwould be a great addition to the attractions of Mugsborough, but there\r\nwas another and more urgent reason that disposed him to do whatever he\r\ncould to encourage the Company to proceed with this work.\r\nUnfortunately, as was usual at that time of the year (Mr Rushton\'s\r\nvoice trembled with emotion) the town was full of unemployed.  (The\r\nMayor, Alderman Sweater, and all the other Councillors shook their\r\nheads sadly; they were visibly affected.) There was no doubt that the\r\nstarting of that work at that time would be an inestimable boon to the\r\nworking-classes.  As the representative of a working-class ward he was\r\nin favour of accepting the offer of the Company.  (Hear. Hear.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Didlum seconded. In his opinion, it would be nothing short\r\nof a crime to oppose anything that would provide work for the\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Weakling moved that the offer be refused.  (Shame.)  He\r\nadmitted that the electric light would be an improvement to the town,\r\nand in view of the existing distress he would be glad to see the work\r\nstarted, but the price mentioned was altogether too low.  It was not\r\nmore than half the value of the land.  (Derisive laughter.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Grinder said he was astonished at the attitude taken up by\r\nCouncillor Weakling.  In his (Grinder\'s) opinion it was disgraceful\r\nthat a member of the council should deliberately try to wreck a project\r\nwhich would do so much towards relieving the unemployed.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor, Alderman Sweater, said that he could not allow the amendment\r\nto be discussed until it was seconded: if there were no seconder he\r\nwould put the original motion.\r\n\r\nThere was no seconder, because everyone except Weakling was in favour\r\nof the resolution, which was carried amid loud cheers, and the\r\nrepresentatives of the ratepayers proceeded to the consideration of the\r\nnext business.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Didlum proposed that the duty on all coal brought into the\r\nborough be raised from two shillings to three shillings per ton.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Rushton seconded.  The largest consumer of coal was the Gas\r\nCoy., and, considering the great profits made by that company, they\r\nwere quite justified in increasing the duty to the highest figure the\r\nAct permitted.\r\n\r\nAfter a feeble protest from Weakling, who said it would only increase\r\nthe price of gas and coal without interfering with the profits of the\r\nGas Coy., this was also carried, and after some other business had been\r\ntransacted, the Band dispersed.\r\n\r\nThat meeting was held two years ago, and since that time the Electric\r\nLight Works had been built and the war against the gasworks carried on\r\nvigorously.  After several encounters, in which they lost a few\r\ncustomers and a portion of the public lighting, the Gasworks Bandits\r\nretreated out of the town and entrenched themselves in a strong\r\nposition beyond the borough boundary, where they erected a number of\r\ngasometers.  They were thus enabled to pour gas into the town at long\r\nrange without having to pay the coal dues.\r\n\r\nThis masterly stratagem created something like a panic in the ranks of\r\nthe Forty Thieves.  At the end of two years they found themselves\r\nexhausted with the protracted campaign, their movements hampered by a\r\nlot of worn-out plant and antiquated machinery, and harassed on every\r\nside by the lower charges of the Gas Coy.  They were reluctantly\r\nconstrained to admit that the attempt to undermine the Gasworks was a\r\nmelancholy failure, and that the Mugsborough Electric Light and\r\nInstallation Coy. was a veritable white elephant.  They began to ask\r\nthemselves what they should do with it; and some of them even urged\r\nunconditional surrender, or an appeal to the arbitration of the\r\nBankruptcy Court.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all the confusion and demoralization there was,\r\nhowever, one man who did not lose his presence of mind, who in this\r\ndark hour of disaster remained calm and immovable, and like a vast\r\nmountain of flesh reared his head above the storm, whose mighty\r\nintellect perceived a way to turn this apparently hopeless defeat into\r\na glorious victory.  That man was Adam Sweater, the Chief of the Band.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 21\r\n\r\nThe Reign of Terror.  The Great Money Trick\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next four weeks the usual reign of terror continued at \'The\r\nCave\'.  The men slaved like so many convicts under the vigilant\r\nsurveillance of Crass, Misery and Rushton.  No one felt free from\r\nobservation for a single moment.  It happened frequently that a man who\r\nwas working alone--as he thought--on turning round would find Hunter or\r\nRushton standing behind him: or one would look up from his work to\r\ncatch sight of a face watching him through a door or a window or over\r\nthe banisters.  If they happened to be working in a room on the ground\r\nfloor, or at a window on any floor, they knew that both Rushton and\r\nHunter were in the habit of hiding among the trees that surrounded the\r\nhouse, and spying upon them thus.\r\n\r\nThere was a plumber working outside repairing the guttering that ran\r\nround the bottom edge of the roof.  This poor wretch\'s life was a\r\nperfect misery: he fancied he saw Hunter or Rushton in every bush.  He\r\nhad two ladders to work from, and since these ladders had been in use\r\nMisery had thought of a new way of spying on the men.  Finding that he\r\nnever succeeded in catching anyone doing anything wrong when he entered\r\nthe house by one of the doors, Misery adopted the plan of crawling up\r\none of the ladders, getting in through one of the upper windows and\r\ncreeping softly downstairs and in and out of the rooms. Even then he\r\nnever caught anyone, but that did not matter, for he accomplished his\r\nprincipal purpose--every man seemed afraid to cease working for even an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this was, of course, that the work progressed rapidly\r\ntowards completion.  The hands grumbled and cursed, but all the same\r\nevery man tore into it for all he was worth.  Although he did next to\r\nnothing himself, Crass watched and urged on the others.  He was \'in\r\ncharge of the job\': he knew that unless he succeeded in making this\r\nwork pay he would not be put in charge of another job.  On the other\r\nhand, if he did make it pay he would be given the preference over\r\nothers and be kept on as long as the firm had any work.  The firm would\r\ngive him the preference only as long as it paid them to do so.\r\n\r\nAs for the hands, each man knew that there was no chance of obtaining\r\nwork anywhere else at present; there were dozens of men out of\r\nemployment already. Besides, even if there had been a chance of getting\r\nanother job somewhere else, they knew that the conditions were more or\r\nless the same on every firm.  Some were even worse than this one. Each\r\nman knew that unless he did as much as ever he could, Crass would\r\nreport him for being slow.  They knew also that when the job began to\r\ndraw to a close the number of men employed upon it would be reduced,\r\nand when that time came the hands who did the most work would be kept\r\non and the slower ones discharged.  It was therefore in the hope of\r\nbeing one of the favoured few that while inwardly cursing the rest for\r\n\'tearing into it\', everyone as a matter of self-preservation went and\r\n\'tore into it\' themselves.\r\n\r\nThey all cursed Crass, but most of them would have been very glad to\r\nchange places with him: and if any one of them had been in his place\r\nthey would have been compelled to act in the same way--or lose the job.\r\n\r\nThey all reviled Hunter, but most of them would have been glad to\r\nchange places with him also: and if any one of them had been in his\r\nplace they would have been compelled to do the same things, or lose the\r\njob.\r\n\r\nThey all hated and blamed Rushton.  Yet if they had been in Rushton\'s\r\nplace they would have been compelled to adopt the same methods, or\r\nbecome bankrupt: for it is obvious that the only way to compete\r\nsuccessfully against other employers who are sweaters is to be a\r\nsweater yourself.  Therefore no one who is an upholder of the present\r\nsystem can consistently blame any of these men.  Blame the system.\r\n\r\nIf you, reader, had been one of the hands, would you have slogged?  Or\r\nwould you have preferred to starve and see your family starve?  If you\r\nhad been in Crass\'s place, would you have resigned rather than do such\r\ndirty work?  If you had had Hunter\'s berth, would you have given it up\r\nand voluntarily reduced yourself to the level of the hands?  If you had\r\nbeen Rushton, would you rather have become bankrupt than treat your\r\n\'hands\' and your customers in the same way as your competitors treated\r\ntheirs?  It may be that, so placed, you--being the noble-minded paragon\r\nthat you are--would have behaved unselfishly. But no one has any right\r\nto expect you to sacrifice yourself for the benefit of other people who\r\nwould only call you a fool for your pains. It may be true that if any\r\none of the hands--Owen, for instance--had been an employer of labour,\r\nhe would have done the same as other employers.  Some people seem to\r\nthink that proves that the present system is all right!  But really it\r\nonly proves that the present system compels selfishness.  One must\r\neither trample upon others or be trampled upon oneself.  Happiness\r\nmight be possible if everyone were unselfish; if everyone thought of\r\nthe welfare of his neighbour before thinking of his own.  But as there\r\nis only a very small percentage of such unselfish people in the world,\r\nthe present system has made the earth into a sort of hell.  Under the\r\npresent system there is not sufficient of anything for everyone to have\r\nenough.  Consequently there is a fight--called by Christians the\r\n\'Battle of Life\'.  In this fight some get more than they need, some\r\nbarely enough, some very little, and some none at all.  The more\r\naggressive, cunning, unfeeling and selfish you are the better it will\r\nbe for you.  As long as this \'Battle of Life\' System endures, we have\r\nno right to blame other people for doing the same things that we are\r\nourselves compelled to do.  Blame the system.\r\n\r\nBut that IS just what the hands did not do.  They blamed each other;\r\nthey blamed Crass, and Hunter, and Rushton, but with the Great System\r\nof which they were all more or less the victims they were quite\r\ncontent, being persuaded that it was the only one possible and the best\r\nthat human wisdom could devise.  The reason why they all believed this\r\nwas because not one of them had ever troubled to inquire whether it\r\nwould not be possible to order things differently.  They were content\r\nwith the present system.  If they had not been content they would have\r\nbeen anxious to find some way to alter it.  But they had never taken\r\nthe trouble to seriously inquire whether it was possible to find some\r\nbetter way, and although they all knew in a hazy fashion that other\r\nmethods of managing the affairs of the world had already been proposed,\r\nthey neglected to inquire whether these other methods were possible or\r\npracticable, and they were ready and willing to oppose with ignorant\r\nridicule or brutal force any man who was foolish or quixotic enough to\r\ntry to explain to them the details of what he thought was a better way.\r\nThey accepted the present system in the same way as they accepted the\r\nalternating seasons.  They knew that there was spring and summer and\r\nautumn and winter.  As to how these different seasons came to be, or\r\nwhat caused them, they hadn\'t the remotest notion, and it is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether the question had ever occurred to any of them: but\r\nthere is no doubt whatever about the fact that none of them knew.  From\r\ntheir infancy they had been trained to distrust their own intelligence,\r\nand to leave the management of the affairs of the world--and for that\r\nmatter of the next world too--to their betters; and now most of them\r\nwere absolutely incapable of thinking of any abstract subject whatever.\r\nNearly all their betters--that is, the people who do nothing--were\r\nunanimous in agreeing that the present system is a very good one and\r\nthat it is impossible to alter or improve it.  Therefore Crass and his\r\nmates, although they knew nothing whatever about it themselves,\r\naccepted it as an established, incontrovertible fact that the existing\r\nstate of things is immutable.  They believed it because someone else\r\ntold them so. They would have believed anything: on one\r\ncondition--namely, that they were told to believe it by their betters.\r\nThey said it was surely not for the Like of Them to think that they\r\nknew better than those who were more educated and had plenty of time to\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nAs the work in the drawing-room proceeded, Crass abandoned the hope\r\nthat Owen was going to make a mess of it.  Some of the rooms upstairs\r\nbeing now ready for papering, Slyme was started on that work, Bert\r\nbeing taken away from Owen to assist Slyme as paste boy, and it was\r\narranged that Crass should help Owen whenever he needed someone to lend\r\nhim a hand.\r\n\r\nSweater came frequently during these four weeks, being interested in\r\nthe progress of the work.  On these occasions Crass always managed to\r\nbe present in the drawing-room and did most of the talking.  Owen was\r\nvery satisfied with this arrangement, for he was always ill at ease\r\nwhen conversing with a man like Sweater, who spoke in an offensively\r\npatronizing way and expected common people to kowtow to and \'Sir\' him\r\nat every second word.  Crass however, seemed to enjoy doing that kind\r\nof thing.  He did not exactly grovel on the floor, when Sweater spoke\r\nto him, but he contrived to convey the impression that he was willing\r\nto do so if desired.\r\n\r\nOutside the house Bundy and his mates had dug deep trenches in the damp\r\nground in which they were laying new drains.  This work, like that of\r\nthe painting of the inside of the house, was nearly completed. It was a\r\nmiserable job.  Owing to the fact that there had been a spell of bad\r\nweather the ground was sodden with rain and there was mud everywhere,\r\nthe men\'s clothing and boots being caked with it.  But the worst thing\r\nabout the job was the smell.  For years the old drain-pipes had been\r\ndefective and leaky.  The ground a few feet below the surface was\r\nsaturated with fetid moisture and a stench as of a thousand putrefying\r\ncorpse emanated from the opened earth.  The clothing of the men who\r\nwere working in the trenches became saturated with this fearful odour,\r\nand for that matter, so did the men themselves.\r\n\r\nThey said they could smell and taste it all the time, even when they\r\nwere away from the work at home, and when they were at meals. Although\r\nthey smoked their pipes all the time they were at work, Misery having\r\nungraciously given them permission, several times Bundy and one or\r\nother of his mates were attacked with fits of vomiting.\r\n\r\nBut, as they began to realize that the finish of the job was in sight,\r\na kind of panic seized upon the hands, especially those who had been\r\ntaken on last and who would therefore be the first to be \'stood still\'.\r\nEaston, however, felt pretty confident that Crass would do his best to\r\nget him kept on till the end of the job, for they had become quite\r\nchummy lately, usually spending a few evenings together at the\r\nCricketers every week.\r\n\r\n\'There\'ll be a bloody slaughter \'ere soon,\' remarked Harlow to Philpot\r\none day as they were painting the banisters of the staircase.  \'I\r\nreckon next week will about finish the inside.\'\r\n\r\n\'And the outside ain\'t goin\' to take very long, you know,\' replied\r\nPhilpot.\r\n\r\n\'They ain\'t got no other work in, have they?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not that I knows of,\' replied Philpot gloomily; \'and I don\'t think\r\nanyone else has either.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know that little place they call the "Kiosk" down the Grand\r\nParade, near the bandstand,\' asked Harlow after a pause.\r\n\r\n\'Where they used to sell refreshments?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; it belongs to the Corporation, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s been closed up lately, ain\'t it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; the people who \'ad it couldn\'t make it pay; but I \'eard last\r\nnight that Grinder the fruit-merchant is goin\' to open it again.  If\r\nit\'s true, there\'ll be a bit of a job there for someone, because it\'ll\r\n\'ave to be done up.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I hope it does come orf replied Philpot.  \'It\'ll be a job for\r\nsome poor b--rs.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder if they\'ve started anyone yet on the venetian blinds for this\r\n\'ouse?\' remarked Easton after a pause.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know,\' replied Philpot.\r\n\r\nThey relapsed into silence for a while.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what time it is?\' said Philpot at length.  \'I don\'t know \'ow\r\nyou feel, but I begin to want my dinner.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just what I was thinking; it can\'t be very far off it now. It\'s\r\nnearly \'arf an hour since Bert went down to make the tea.  It seems a\r\n\'ell of a long morning to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'So it does to me,\' said Philpot;  \'slip upstairs and ask Slyme what\r\ntime it is.\'\r\n\r\nHarlow laid his brush across the top of his paint-pot and went\r\nupstairs.  He was wearing a pair of cloth slippers, and walked softly,\r\nnot wishing that Crass should hear him leaving his work, so it happened\r\nthat without any intention of spying on Slyme, Harlow reached the door\r\nof the room in which the former was working without being heard and,\r\nentering suddenly, surprised Slyme--who was standing near the\r\nfireplace--in the act of breaking a whole roll of wallpaper across his\r\nknee as one might break a stick.  On the floor beside him was what had\r\nbeen another roll, now broken into two pieces.  When Harlow came in,\r\nSlyme started, and his face became crimson with confusion.  He hastily\r\ngathered the broken rolls together and, stooping down, thrust the\r\npieces up the flue of the grate and closed the register.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s the bloody game?\' inquired Harlow.\r\n\r\nSlyme laughed with an affectation of carelessness, but his hands\r\ntrembled and his face was now very pale.\r\n\r\n\'We must get our own back somehow, you know, Fred,\' he said.\r\n\r\nHarlow did not reply.  He did not understand.  After puzzling over it\r\nfor a few minutes, he gave it up.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the time?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Fifteen minutes to twelve,\' said Slyme and added, as Harlow was going\r\naway: \'Don\'t mention anything about that paper to Crass or any of the\r\nothers.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shan\'t say nothing,\' replied Harlow.\r\n\r\nGradually, as he pondered over it, Harlow began to comprehend the\r\nmeaning of the destruction of the two rolls of paper.  Slyme was doing\r\nthe paperhanging piecework--so much for each roll hung.  Four of the\r\nrooms upstairs had been done with the same pattern, and Hunter--who was\r\nnot over-skilful in such matters--had evidently sent more paper than\r\nwas necessary.  By getting rid of these two rolls, Slyme would be able\r\nto make it appear that he had hung two rolls more than was really the\r\ncase.  He had broken the rolls so as to be able to take them away from\r\nthe house without being detected, and he had hidden them up the chimney\r\nuntil he got an opportunity of so doing.  Harlow had just arrived at\r\nthis solution of the problem when, hearing the lower flight of stairs\r\ncreaking, he peeped over and observed Misery crawling up. He had come\r\nto see if anyone had stopped work before the proper time. Passing the\r\ntwo workmen without speaking, he ascended to the next floor, and\r\nentered the room where Slyme was.\r\n\r\n\'You\'d better not do this room yet,\' said Hunter.  \'There\'s to be a new\r\ngrate and mantelpiece put in.\'\r\n\r\nHe crossed over to the fireplace and stood looking at it thoughtfully\r\nfor a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not a bad little grate, you know, is it?\' he remarked.  \'We\'ll be\r\nable to use it somewhere or other.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; it\'s all right,\' said Slyme, whose heart was beating like a\r\nsteam-hammer.\r\n\r\n\'Do for a front room in a cottage,\' continued Misery, stooping down to\r\nexamine it more closely.  \'There\'s nothing broke that I can see.\'\r\n\r\nHe put his hand against the register and vainly tried to push it open.\r\n\'H\'m, there\'s something wrong \'ere,\' he remarked, pushing harder.\r\n\r\n\'Most likely a brick or some plaster fallen down,\' gasped Slyme, coming\r\nto Misery\'s assistance.  \'Shall I try to open it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t trouble,\' replied Nimrod, rising to his feet.  \'It\'s most likely\r\nwhat you say.  I\'ll see that the new grate is sent up after dinner.\r\nBundy can fix it this afternoon and then you can go on papering as soon\r\nas you like.\'\r\n\r\nWith this, Misery went out of the room, downstairs and away from the\r\nhouse, and Slyme wiped the sweat from his forehead with his\r\nhandkerchief.  Then he knelt down and, opening the register, he took\r\nout the broken rolls of paper and hid them up the chimney of the next\r\nroom.  While he was doing this the sound of Crass\'s whistle shrilled\r\nthrough the house.\r\n\r\n\'Thank Gord!\' exclaimed Philpot fervently as he laid his brushes on the\r\ntop of his pot and joined in the general rush to the kitchen.  The\r\nscene here is already familiar to the reader.  For seats, the two pairs\r\nof steps laid on their sides parallel to each other, about eight feet\r\napart and at right angles to the fireplace, with the long plank placed\r\nacross; and the upturned pails and the drawers of the dresser. The\r\nfloor unswept and littered with dirt, scraps of paper, bits of plaster,\r\npieces of lead pipe and dried mud; and in the midst, the steaming\r\nbucket of stewed tea and the collection of cracked cups, jam-jam and\r\ncondensed milk tins.  And on the seats the men in their shabby and in\r\nsome cases ragged clothing sitting and eating their coarse food and\r\ncracking jokes.\r\n\r\nIt was a pathetic and wonderful and at the same time a despicable\r\nspectacle.  Pathetic that human beings should be condemned to spend the\r\ngreater part of their lives amid such surroundings, because it must be\r\nremembered that most of their time was spent on some job or other.\r\nWhen \'The Cave\' was finished they would go to some similar \'job\', if\r\nthey were lucky enough to find one.  Wonderful, because although they\r\nknew that they did more than their fair share of the great work of\r\nproducing the necessaries and comforts of life, they did not think they\r\nwere entitled to a fair share of the good things they helped to create!\r\nAnd despicable, because although they saw their children condemned to\r\nthe same life of degradation, hard labour and privation, yet they\r\nrefused to help to bring about a better state of affairs.  Most of them\r\nthought that what had been good enough for themselves was good enough\r\nfor their children.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if they regarded their own children with a kind of\r\ncontempt, as being only fit to grow up to be the servants of the\r\nchildren of such people as Rushton and Sweater.  But it must be\r\nremembered that they had been taught self-contempt when they were\r\nchildren.  In the so-called \'Christian\' schools they attended then\r\nthey were taught to \'order themselves lowly and reverently towards\r\ntheir betters\', and they were now actually sending their own children\r\nto learn the same degrading lessons in their turn!  They had a vast\r\namount of consideration for their betters, and for the children of\r\ntheir betters, but very little for their own children, for each other,\r\nor for themselves.\r\n\r\nThat was why they sat there in their rags and ate their coarse food,\r\nand cracked their coarser jokes, and drank the dreadful tea, and were\r\ncontent!  So long as they had Plenty of Work and plenty\r\nof--Something--to eat, and somebody else\'s cast-off clothes to wear,\r\nthey were content!  And they were proud of it.  They gloried in it.\r\nThey agreed and assured each other that the good things of life were\r\nnot intended for the \'Likes of them\', or their children.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s become of the Professor?\' asked the gentleman who sat on the\r\nupturned pail in the corner, referring to Owen, who had not yet come\r\ndown from his work.\r\n\r\n\'P\'raps \'e\'s preparing \'is sermon,\' remarked Harlow with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\'We ain\'t \'ad no lectures from \'im lately, since \'e\'s been on that\r\nroom,\' observed Easton.  \'\'Ave we?\'\r\n\r\n\'Dam good job too!\' exclaimed Sawkins.  \'It gives me the pip to \'ear\r\n\'im, the same old thing over and over again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor ole Frank,\' remarked Harlow.  \'\'E does upset \'isself about\r\nthings, don\'t \'e?\'\r\n\r\n\'More fool \'im!\' said Bundy.  \'I\'ll take bloody good care I don\'t go\r\nworryin\' myself to death like \'e\'s doin\', about such dam rot as that.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do believe that\'s wot makes \'im look so bad as \'e does,\' observed\r\nHarlow.  \'Several times this morning I couldn\'t help noticing the way\r\n\'e kept on coughing.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought \'e seemed to be a bit better lately,\' Philpot observed;\r\n\'more cheerful and happier like, and more inclined for a bit of fun.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'s a funny sort of chap, ain\'t he?\' said Bundy.  \'One day quite\r\njolly, singing and cracking jokes and tellin\' yarns, and the next you\r\ncan\'t hardly get a word out of \'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bloody rot, I call it,\' chimed in the man on the pail.  \'Wot the\r\n\'ell\'s the use of the likes of us troublin\' our \'eads about politics?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I don\'t see that.\' replied Harlow.  \'We\'ve got votes and we\'re\r\nreally the people what control the affairs of the country, so I reckon\r\nwe ought to take SOME interest in it, but at the same time I can\'t see\r\nno sense in this \'ere Socialist wangle that Owen\'s always talkin\'\r\nabout.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor nobody else neither,\' said Crass with a jeering laugh.\r\n\r\n\'Even if all the bloody money in the world WAS divided out equal,\' said\r\nthe man on the pail, profoundly, \'it wouldn\'t do no good!  In six\r\nmonths\' time it would be all back in the same \'ands again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said everybody.\r\n\r\n\'But \'e \'ad a cuff the other day about money bein\' no good at all!\'\r\nobserved Easton.  \'Don\'t you remember \'e said as money was the\r\nprincipal cause of poverty?\'\r\n\r\n\'So it is the principal cause of poverty,\' said Owen, who entered at\r\nthat moment.\r\n\r\n\'Hooray!\' shouted Philpot, leading off a cheer which the others took\r\nup.  \'The Professor \'as arrived and will now proceed to say a few\r\nremarks.\'\r\n\r\nA roar of merriment greeted this sally.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s \'ave our bloody dinner first, for Christ\'s sake,\' appealed\r\nHarlow, with mock despair.\r\n\r\nAs Owen, having filled his cup with tea, sat down in his usual place,\r\nPhilpot rose solemnly to his feet, and, looking round the company, said:\r\n\r\n\'Genelmen, with your kind permission, as soon as the Professor \'as\r\nfinished \'is dinner \'e will deliver \'is well-known lecture, entitled,\r\n"Money the Principal Cause of being \'ard up", proving as money ain\'t no\r\ngood to nobody.  At the hend of the lecture a collection will be took\r\nup to provide the lecturer with a little encouragement.\'  Philpot\r\nresumed his seat amid cheers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had finished eating, some of the men began to make\r\nremarks about the lecture, but Owen only laughed and went on reading\r\nthe piece of newspaper that his dinner had been wrapped in.  Usually\r\nmost of the men went out for a walk after dinner, but as it happened to\r\nbe raining that day they were determined, if possible, to make Owen\r\nfulfill the engagement made in his name by Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s \'oot \'im,\' said Harlow, and the suggestion was at once acted\r\nupon; howls, groans and catcalls filled the air, mingled with cries of\r\n\'Fraud!\' \'Imposter!\' \'Give us our money back!\' \'Let\'s wreck the \'all!\'\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n\'Come on \'ere,\' cried Philpot, putting his hand on Owen\'s shoulder.\r\n\'Prove that money is the cause of poverty.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s one thing to say it and another to prove it,\' sneered Crass, who\r\nwas anxious for an opportunity to produce the long-deferred Obscurer\r\ncutting.\r\n\r\n\'Money IS the real cause of poverty,\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'Prove it,\' repeated Crass.\r\n\r\n\'Money is the cause of poverty because it is the device by which those\r\nwho are too lazy to work are enabled to rob the workers of the fruits\r\nof their labours.\'\r\n\r\n\'Prove it,\' said Crass.\r\n\r\nOwen slowly folded up the piece of newspaper he had been reading and\r\nput it into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' he replied.  \'I\'ll show you how the Great Money Trick is\r\nworked.\'\r\n\r\nOwen opened his dinner basket and took from it two slices of bread but\r\nas these were not sufficient, he requested that anyone who had some\r\nbread left would give it to him.  They gave him several pieces, which\r\nhe placed in a heap on a clean piece of paper, and, having borrowed the\r\npocket knives they used to cut and eat their dinners with from Easton,\r\nHarlow and Philpot, he addressed them as follows:\r\n\r\n\'These pieces of bread represent the raw materials which exist\r\nnaturally in and on the earth for the use of mankind; they were not\r\nmade by any human being, but were created by the Great Spirit for the\r\nbenefit and sustenance of all, the same as were the air and the light\r\nof the sun.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re about as fair-speakin\' a man as I\'ve met for some time,\' said\r\nHarlow, winking at the others.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, mate,\' said Philpot.  \'Anyone would agree to that much! It\'s as\r\nclear as mud.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now,\' continued Owen, \'I am a capitalist; or, rather, I represent the\r\nlandlord and capitalist class.  That is to say, all these raw materials\r\nbelong to me.  It does not matter for our present argument how I\r\nobtained possession of them, or whether I have any real right to them;\r\nthe only thing that matters now is the admitted fact that all the raw\r\nmaterials which are necessary for the production of the necessaries of\r\nlife are now the property of the Landlord and Capitalist class.  I am\r\nthat class: all these raw materials belong to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good enough!\' agreed Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Now you three represent the Working class: you have nothing--and for\r\nmy part, although I have all these raw materials, they are of no use to\r\nme--what I need is--the things that can be made out of these raw\r\nmaterials by Work: but as I am too lazy to work myself, I have invented\r\nthe Money Trick to make you work FOR me.  But first I must explain that\r\nI possess something else beside the raw materials.  These three knives\r\nrepresent--all the machinery of production; the factories, tools,\r\nrailways, and so forth, without which the necessaries of life cannot be\r\nproduced in abundance.  And these three coins\'--taking three\r\nhalfpennies from his pocket--\'represent my Money Capital.\'\r\n\r\n\'But before we go any further,\' said Owen, interrupting himself, \'it is\r\nmost important that you remember that I am not supposed to be merely\r\n"a" capitalist.  I represent the whole Capitalist Class.  You are not\r\nsupposed to be just three workers--you represent the whole Working\r\nClass.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, all right,\' said Crass, impatiently, \'we all understand\r\nthat.  Git on with it.\'\r\n\r\nOwen proceeded to cut up one of the slices of bread into a number of\r\nlittle square blocks.\r\n\r\n\'These represent the things which are produced by labour, aided by\r\nmachinery, from the raw materials.  We will suppose that three of these\r\nblocks represent--a week\'s work.  We will suppose that a week\'s work is\r\nworth--one pound: and we will suppose that each of these ha\'pennies is\r\na sovereign.  We\'d be able to do the trick better if we had real\r\nsovereigns, but I forgot to bring any with me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d lend you some,\' said Philpot, regretfully, \'but I left me purse on\r\nour grand pianner.\'\r\n\r\nAs by a strange coincidence nobody happened to have any gold with them,\r\nit was decided to make shift with the halfpence.\r\n\r\n\'Now this is the way the trick works--\'\r\n\r\n\'Before you goes on with it,\' interrupted Philpot, apprehensively,\r\n\'don\'t you think we\'d better \'ave someone to keep watch at the gate in\r\ncase a Slop comes along?  We don\'t want to get runned in, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think there\'s any need for that,\' replied Owen, \'there\'s only\r\none slop who\'d interfere with us for playing this game, and that\'s\r\nPolice Constable Socialism.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind about Socialism,\' said Crass, irritably.  \'Get along with\r\nthe bloody trick.\'\r\n\r\nOwen now addressed himself to the working classes as represented by\r\nPhilpot, Harlow and Easton.\r\n\r\n\'You say that you are all in need of employment, and as I am the\r\nkind-hearted capitalist class I am going to invest all my money in\r\nvarious industries, so as to give you Plenty of Work.  I shall pay each\r\nof you one pound per week, and a week\'s work is--you must each produce\r\nthree of these square blocks.  For doing this work you will each\r\nreceive your wages; the money will be your own, to do as you like with,\r\nand the things you produce will of course be mine, to do as I like\r\nwith.  You will each take one of these machines and as soon as you have\r\ndone a week\'s work, you shall have your money.\'\r\n\r\nThe Working Classes accordingly set to work, and the Capitalist class\r\nsat down and watched them.  As soon as they had finished, they passed\r\nthe nine little blocks to Owen, who placed them on a piece of paper by\r\nhis side and paid the workers their wages.\r\n\r\n\'These blocks represent the necessaries of life.  You can\'t live\r\nwithout some of these things, but as they belong to me, you will have\r\nto buy them from me: my price for these blocks is--one pound each.\'\r\n\r\nAs the working classes were in need of the necessaries of life and as\r\nthey could not eat, drink or wear the useless money, they were\r\ncompelled to agree to the kind Capitalist\'s terms.  They each bought\r\nback and at once consumed one-third of the produce of their labour. The\r\ncapitalist class also devoured two of the square blocks, and so the net\r\nresult of the week\'s work was that the kind capitalist had consumed two\r\npounds worth of the things produced by the labour of the others, and\r\nreckoning the squares at their market value of one pound each, he had\r\nmore than doubled his capital, for he still possessed the three pounds\r\nin money and in addition four pounds worth of goods.  As for the\r\nworking classes, Philpot, Harlow and Easton, having each consumed the\r\npound\'s worth of necessaries they had bought with their wages, they\r\nwere again in precisely the same condition as when they started\r\nwork--they had nothing.\r\n\r\nThis process was repeated several times: for each week\'s work the\r\nproducers were paid their wages.  They kept on working and spending all\r\ntheir earnings.  The kind-hearted capitalist consumed twice as much as\r\nany one of them and his pile of wealth continually increased. In a\r\nlittle while--reckoning the little squares at their market value of one\r\npound each--he was worth about one hundred pounds, and the working\r\nclasses were still in the same condition as when they began, and were\r\nstill tearing into their work as if their lives depended upon it.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the rest of the crowd began to laugh, and their merriment\r\nincreased when the kind-hearted capitalist, just after having sold a\r\npound\'s worth of necessaries to each of his workers, suddenly took\r\ntheir tools--the Machinery of Production--the knives away from them,\r\nand informed them that as owing to Over Production all his store-houses\r\nwere glutted with the necessaries of life, he had decided to close down\r\nthe works.\r\n\r\n\'Well, and wot the bloody \'ell are we to do now?\' demanded Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not my business,\' replied the kind-hearted capitalist.  \'I\'ve\r\npaid you your wages, and provided you with Plenty of Work for a long\r\ntime past.  I have no more work for you to do at present.  Come round\r\nagain in a few months\' time and I\'ll see what I can do for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'But what about the necessaries of life?\' demanded Harlow.  \'We must\r\nhave something to eat.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course you must,\' replied the capitalist, affably; \'and I shall be\r\nvery pleased to sell you some.\'\r\n\r\n\'But we ain\'t got no bloody money!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you can\'t expect me to give you my goods for nothing!  You\r\ndidn\'t work for me for nothing, you know.  I paid you for your work and\r\nyou should have saved something: you should have been thrifty like me.\r\nLook how I have got on by being thrifty!\'\r\n\r\nThe unemployed looked blankly at each other, but the rest of the crowd\r\nonly laughed; and then the three unemployed began to abuse the\r\nkind-hearted Capitalist, demanding that he should give them some of the\r\nnecessaries of life that he had piled up in his warehouses, or to be\r\nallowed to work and produce some more for their own needs; and even\r\nthreatened to take some of the things by force if he did not comply\r\nwith their demands.  But the kind-hearted Capitalist told them not to\r\nbe insolent, and spoke to them about honesty, and said if they were not\r\ncareful he would have their faces battered in for them by the police,\r\nor if necessary he would call out the military and have them shot down\r\nlike dogs, the same as he had done before at Featherstone and Belfast.\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' continued the kind-hearted capitalist, \'if it were not for\r\nforeign competition I should be able to sell these things that you have\r\nmade, and then I should be able to give you Plenty of Work again: but\r\nuntil I have sold them to somebody or other, or until I have used them\r\nmyself, you will have to remain idle.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, this takes the bloody biskit, don\'t it?\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'The only thing as I can see for it,\' said Philpot mournfully, \'is to\r\n\'ave a unemployed procession.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the idear,\' said Harlow, and the three began to march about the\r\nroom in Indian file, singing:\r\n\r\n        \'We\'ve got no work to do-oo-oo\'\r\n        We\'ve got no work to do-oo-oo!\r\n        Just because we\'ve been workin\' a dam sight too hard,\r\n        Now we\'ve got no work to do.\'\r\n\r\nAs they marched round, the crowd jeered at them and made offensive\r\nremarks.  Crass said that anyone could see that they were a lot of\r\nlazy, drunken loafers who had never done a fair day\'s work in their\r\nlives and never intended to.\r\n\r\n\'We shan\'t never get nothing like this, you know,\' said Philpot. \'Let\'s\r\ntry the religious dodge.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' agreed Harlow.  \'What shall we give \'em?\'\r\n\r\n\'I know!\' cried Philpot after a moment\'s deliberation.  \'"Let my lower\r\nlights be burning."  That always makes \'em part up.\'\r\n\r\nThe three unemployed accordingly resumed their march round the room,\r\nsinging mournfully and imitating the usual whine of street-singers:\r\n\r\n        \'Trim your fee-bil lamp me brither-in,\r\n        Some poor sail-er tempest torst,\r\n        Strugglin\' \'ard to save the \'arb-er,\r\n        Hin the dark-niss may be lorst,\r\n        So let try lower lights be burning,\r\n        Send \'er gleam acrost the wave,\r\n        Some poor shipwrecked, struggling seaman,\r\n        You may rescue, you may save.\'\r\n\r\n\'Kind frens,\' said Philpot, removing his cap and addressing the crowd,\r\n\'we\'re hall honest British workin\' men, but we\'ve been hout of work for\r\nthe last twenty years on account of foreign competition and\r\nover-production.  We don\'t come hout \'ere because we\'re too lazy to\r\nwork; it\'s because we can\'t get a job.  If it wasn\'t for foreign\r\ncompetition, the kind\'earted Hinglish capitalists would be able to sell\r\ntheir goods and give us Plenty of Work, and if they could, I assure you\r\nthat we should hall be perfectly willing and contented to go on workin\'\r\nour bloody guts out for the benefit of our masters for the rest of our\r\nlives.  We\'re quite willin\' to work: that\'s hall we arst for--Plenty of\r\nWork--but as we can\'t get it we\'re forced to come out \'ere and arst you\r\nto spare a few coppers towards a crust of bread and a night\'s lodgin\'.\'\r\n\r\nAs Philpot held out his cap for subscriptions, some of them attempted\r\nto expectorate into it, but the more charitable put in pieces of cinder\r\nor dirt from the floor, and the kind-hearted capitalist was so affected\r\nby the sight of their misery that he gave them one of the sovereigns he\r\nhad in us pocket: but as this was of no use to them they immediately\r\nreturned it to him in exchange for one of the small squares of the\r\nnecessaries of life, which they divided and greedily devoured.  And\r\nwhen they had finished eating they gathered round the philanthropist\r\nand sang, \'For he\'s a jolly good fellow,\' and afterwards Harlow\r\nsuggested that they should ask him if he would allow them to elect him\r\nto Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 22\r\n\r\nThe Phrenologist\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following morning--Saturday--the men went about their work in\r\ngloomy silence; there were but few attempts at conversation and no\r\njests or singing.  The tenor of the impending slaughter pervaded the\r\nhouse.  Even those who were confident of being spared and kept on till\r\nthe job was finished shared the general depression, not only out of\r\nsympathy for the doomed, but because they knew that a similar fate\r\nawaited themselves a little later on.\r\n\r\nThey all waited anxiously for Nimrod to come, but hour after hour\r\ndragged slowly by and he did not arrive.  At half past eleven some of\r\nthose who had made up their minds that they were to be \'stood still\'\r\nbegan to hope that the slaughter was to be deferred for a few days:\r\nafter all, there was plenty of work still to be done: even if all hands\r\nwere kept on, the job could scarcely be finished in another week.\r\nAnyhow, it would not be very long now before they would know one way or\r\nthe other.  If he did not come before twelve, it was all right: all the\r\nhands were paid by the hour and were therefore entitled to an hour\'s\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nEaston and Harlow were working together on the staircase, finishing the\r\ndoors and other woodwork with white enamel.  The men had not been\r\nallowed to spend the time necessary to prepare this work in a proper\r\nmanner, it had not been rubbed down smooth or properly filled up, and\r\nit had not had a sufficient number of coats of paint to make it solid\r\nwhite.  Now that the glossy enamel was put on, the work looked rather\r\nrough and shady.\r\n\r\n\'It ain\'t \'arf all right, ain\'t it?\' remarked Harlow, sarcastically,\r\nindicating the door he had just finished.\r\n\r\nEaston laughed: \'I can\'t understand how people pass such work,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Old Sweater did make some remark about it the other day,\' replied\r\nHarlow, \'and I heard Misery tell \'im it was impossible to make a\r\nperfect job of such old doors.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe that man\'s the biggest liar Gord ever made,\' said Easton, an\r\nopinion in which Harlow entirely concurred.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what the time is?\' said the latter after a pause.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know exactly,\' replied Easton, \'but it can\'t be far off\r\ntwelve.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E don\'t seem to be comin\', does \'e?\' Harlow continued.\r\n\r\n\'No: and I shouldn\'t be surprised if \'e didn\'t turn up at all, now.\r\nP\'raps \'e don\'t mean to stop nobody today after all.\'\r\n\r\nThey spoke in hushed tones and glanced cautiously about them fearful of\r\nbeing heard or observed.\r\n\r\n\'This is a bloody life, ain\'t it?\' Harlow said, bitterly.  \'Workin\' our\r\nguts out like a lot of slaves for the benefit of other people, and then\r\nas soon as they\'ve done with you, you\'re chucked aside like a dirty\r\nrag.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: and I begin to think that a great deal of what Owen says is true.\r\nBut for my part I can\'t see \'ow it\'s ever goin\' to be altered, can you?\'\r\n\r\nBlowed if I know, mate.  But whether it can be altered or not, there\'s\r\none thing very certain; it won\'t be done in our time.\'\r\n\r\nNeither of them seemed to think that if the \'alteration\' they spoke of\r\nwere to be accomplished at all they themselves would have to help to\r\nbring it about.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what they\'re doin\' about the venetian blinds?\' said Easton.\r\n\'Is there anyone doin\' em yet?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know; ain\'t \'eard nothing about \'em since the boy took \'em to\r\nthe shop.\'\r\n\r\nThere was quite a mystery about these blinds.  About a month ago they\r\nwere taken to the paint-shop down at the yard to be repainted and\r\nre-harnessed, and since then nothing had been heard of them by the men\r\nworking at the \'Cave\'.\r\n\r\n\'P\'hap\'s a couple of us will be sent there to do \'em next week,\'\r\nremarked Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'P\'hap\'s so.  Most likely they\'ll \'ave to be done in a bloody \'urry at\r\nthe last minute.\'\r\n\r\nPresently Harlow--who was very anxious to know what time it was--went\r\ndownstairs to ask Slyme.  It was twenty minutes to twelve.\r\n\r\nFrom the window of the room where Slyme was papering, one could see\r\ninto the front garden. Harlow paused a moment to watch Bundy and the\r\nlabourers, who were still working in the trenches at the drains, and as\r\nhe looked out he saw Hunter approaching the house.  Harlow drew back\r\nhastily and returned to his work, and as he went he passed the word to\r\nthe other men, warning them of the approach of Misery.\r\n\r\nHunter entered in his usual manner and, after crawling quietly about\r\nthe house for about ten minutes, he went into the drawing room.\r\n\r\n\'I see you\'re putting the finishing touches on at last,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Owen.  \'I\'ve only got this bit of outlining to do now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, well, it looks very nice, of course,\' said Misery in a voice of\r\nmourning, \'but we\'ve lost money over it.  It\'s taken you a week longer\r\nto do than we allowed for; you said three weeks and it\'s taken you a\r\nmonth; and we only allowed for fifteen books of gold, but you\'ve been\r\nand used twenty-three.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can hardly blame me for that, you know,\' answered Owen.  \'I could\r\nhave got it done in the three weeks, but Mr Rushton told me not to\r\nhurry for the sake of a day or two, because he wanted a good job.  He\r\nsaid he would rather lose a little over it than spoil it; and as for\r\nthe extra gold, that was also his order.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I suppose it can\'t be helped,\' whined Misery.  \'Anyhow, I\'m very\r\nglad it\'s done, because this kind of work don\'t pay.  We\'ll \'ave you\r\nback on the brush on Monday morning; we want to get outside done next\r\nweek if it keeps fine.\'\r\n\r\nThe \'brush\' alluded to by Nimrod was the large \'pound\' brush used in\r\nordinary painting.\r\n\r\nMisery now began wandering about the house, in and out of the rooms,\r\nsometimes standing for several minutes silently watching the hands as\r\nthey worked. As he watched them the men became nervous and awkward,\r\neach one dreading that he might be one of those who were to be paid off\r\nat one o\'clock.\r\n\r\nAt about five minutes to twelve Hunter went down to the paint-shop--the\r\nscullery--where Crass was mixing some colour, and getting ready some\r\n\'empties\' to be taken to the yard.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose the b--r\'s gone to ask Crass which of us is the least use,\'\r\nwhispered Harlow to Easton.\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t be surprised if it was you and me, for two,\' replied the\r\nlatter in the same tone.  \'You can\'t trust Crass you know, for all \'e\r\nseems so friendly to our faces.  You never know what \'e ses behind our\r\nbacks.\'\r\n\r\n\'You may be sure it won\'t be Sawkins or any of the other light-weights,\r\nbecause Nimrod won\'t want to pay us sixpence ha\'penny for painting\r\nguttering and rainpipes when THEY can do it near enough for fourpence\r\nha\'penny and fivepence.  They won\'t be able to do the sashes, though,\r\nwill they?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know so much about that,\' replied Easton.  \'Anything seems to\r\nbe good enough for Hunter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Look out!  Ere \'e comes!\' said Harlow, and they both relapsed into\r\nsilence and busied themselves with their work.  Misery stood watching\r\nthem for some time without speaking, and then went out of the house.\r\nThey crept cautiously to the window of a room that overlooked the\r\ngarden and, peeping furtively out, they saw him standing on the brink\r\nof one of the trenches, moodily watching Bundy and his mates as they\r\ntoiled at the drains.  Then, to their surprise and relief, he turned\r\nand went out of the gate!  They just caught sight of one of the wheels\r\nof his bicycle as he rode away.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter was evidently to be put off until next week!  It seemed\r\ntoo good to be true.\r\n\r\n\'P\'hap\'s \'e\'s left a message for some of us with Crass?\' suggested\r\nEaston.  \'I don\'t think it\'s likely, but it\'s just possible.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m goin\' down to ask \'im,\' said Harlow, desperately.  \'We may\r\nas well know the worst at once.\'\r\n\r\nHe returned in a few minutes with the information that Hunter had\r\ndecided not to stop anyone that day because he wanted to get the\r\noutside finished during the next week, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe hands received this intelligence with mixed feelings, because\r\nalthough it left them safe for the present, it meant that nearly\r\neverybody would certainly be stopped next Saturday, if not before;\r\nwhereas if a few had been sacked today it would have made it all the\r\nbetter for the rest.  Still, this aspect of the business did not\r\ngreatly interfere with the relief that they all felt at knowing that\r\nthe immediate danger was over; and the fact that it was\r\nSaturday--pay-day--also served to revive their drooping spirits.  They\r\nall felt pretty certain that Misery would return no more that day, and\r\npresently Harlow began to sing the old favourite.  \'Work! for the night\r\nis coming!\' the refrain of which was soon taken up by nearly everyone\r\nin the house:\r\n\r\n        \'Work! for the night is coming,\r\n        Work in the morning hours.\r\n        Work! for the night is coming,\r\n        Work \'mid springing flowers.\r\n\r\n        \'Work while the dew is sparkling,\r\n        Work in the noonday sun!\r\n        Work! for the night is coming\r\n        When man\'s work is done!\'\r\n\r\nWhen this hymn was finished, someone else, imitating the whine of a\r\nstreet-singer, started, \'Oh, where is my wandering boy tonight?\' and\r\nthen Harlow--who by some strange chance had a penny--took it out of his\r\npocket and dropped it on the floor, the ringing of the coin being\r\ngreeted with shouts of \'Thank you, kind lady,\' from several of the\r\nsingers.  This little action of Harlow\'s was the means of bringing a\r\nmost extraordinary circumstance to light.  Although it was Saturday\r\nmorning, several of the others had pennies or half-pence! and at the\r\nconclusion of each verse they all followed Harlow\'s example and the\r\nhouse resounded with the ringing of falling coins, cries of \'Thank you,\r\nkind lady,\' \'Thank you, sir,\' and \'Gord bless you,\' mingled with shouts\r\nof laughter.\r\n\r\n\'My wandering boy\' was followed by a choice selection of choruses of\r\nwell-known music-hall songs, including \'Goodbye, my Bluebell\', \'The\r\nHoneysuckle and the Bee\', \'I\'ve got \'em!\' and \'The Church Parade\', the\r\nwhole being tastefully varied and interspersed with howls, shrieks,\r\ncurses, catcalls, and downward explosions of flatulence.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the uproar Crass came upstairs.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere!\' he shouted.  \'For Christ\'s sake make less row!  Suppose Nimrod\r\nwas to come back!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, he ain\'t comin\' any more today,\' said Harlow, recklessly.\r\n\r\n\'Besides, what if \'e does come?\' cried Easton.  \'Oo cares for \'im?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, we never know; and for that matter Rushton or Sweater might come\r\nat any minit.\'\r\n\r\nWith this, Crass went muttering back to the scullery, and the men\r\nrelapsed into their usual silence.\r\n\r\nAt ten minutes to one they all ceased work, put away their colours and\r\nlocked up the house.  There were a number of \'empties\' to be taken away\r\nand left at the yard on their way to the office; these Crass divided\r\namongst the others--carrying nothing himself--and then they all set out\r\nfor the office to get their money, cracking jokes as they went along.\r\nHarlow and Easton enlivened the journey by coughing significantly\r\nwhenever they met a young woman, and audibly making some complimentary\r\nremark about her personal appearance.  If the girl smiled, each of them\r\neagerly claimed to have \'seen her first\', but if she appeared offended\r\nor \'stuck up\', they suggested that she was cross-cut or that she had\r\nbeen eating vinegar with a fork.  Now and then they kissed their hands\r\naffectionately to servant-girls whom they saw looking out of windows.\r\nSome of these girls laughed, others looked indignant, but whichever way\r\nthey took it was equally amusing to Crass and the rest, who were like a\r\ncrowd of boys just let out of school.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that there was a back door to Rushton\'s office;\r\nin this door was a small sliding panel or trap-door with a little shelf\r\nat the bottom.  The men stood in the road on the pavement outside the\r\nclosed door, their money being passed out to them through the sliding\r\npanel.  As there was no shelter, when it rained they occasionally got\r\nwet through while waiting to be paid.  With some firms it is customary\r\nto call out the names of the men and pay them in order of seniority or\r\nability, but there was no such system here; the man who got to the\r\naperture first was paid first, and so on.  The result was that there\r\nwas always a sort of miniature \'Battle of Life\', the men pushing and\r\nstruggling against each other as if their lives depended upon their\r\nbeing paid by a certain time.\r\n\r\nOn the ledge of the little window through which their money was passed\r\nthere was always a Hospital collection-box.  Every man put either a\r\npenny or twopence into this box.  Of course, it was not compulsory to\r\ndo so, but they all did, because they felt that any man who omitted to\r\ncontribute might be \'marked\'.  They did not all agree with contributing\r\nto the Hospital, for several reasons.  They knew that the doctors at\r\nthe Hospital made a practice of using the free patients to make\r\nexperiments upon, and they also knew that the so-called \'free\' patients\r\nwho contribute so very largely directly to the maintenance of such\r\ninstitutions, get scant consideration when they apply for the \'free\'\r\ntreatment, and are plainly given to understand that they are receiving\r\n\'charity\'.  Some of the men thought that, considering the extent to\r\nwhich they contributed, they should be entitled to attention as a right.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving their wages, Crass, Easton, Bundy, Philpot, Harlow and\r\na few others adjourned to the Cricketers for a drink.  Owen went away\r\nalone, and Slyme also went on by himself.  There was no use waiting for\r\nEaston to come out of the public house, because there was no knowing\r\nhow long he would be; he might stay half an hour or two hours.\r\n\r\nOn his way home, in accordance with his usual custom, Slyme called at\r\nthe Post Office to put some of his wages in the bank.  Like most other\r\n\'Christians\', he believed in taking thought for the morrow, what he\r\nshould eat and drink and wherewithal he was to be clothed.  He thought\r\nit wise to layup for himself as much treasure upon earth as possible.\r\nThe fact that Jesus said that His disciples were not to do these things\r\nmade no more difference to Slyme\'s conduct than it does to the conduct\r\nof any other \'Christian\'.  They are all agreed that when Jesus said\r\nthis He meant something else: and all the other inconvenient things\r\nthat Jesus said are disposed of in the same way.  For instance, these\r\n\'disciples\' assure us that when Jesus said, \'Resist not evil\', \'If a\r\nman smite thee upon he right cheek turn unto him also the left\', He\r\nreally meant \'Turn on to him a Maxim gun; disembowel him with a bayonet\r\nor batter in his skull with the butt end of a rifle!\'  When He said,\r\n\'If one take thy coat, give him thy cloak also,\' the \'Christians\' say\r\nthat what He really meant was: \'If one take thy coat, give him six\r\nmonths\' hard labour. A few of the followers of Jesus admit that He\r\nreally did mean just what He said, but they say that the world would\r\nnever be able to go on if they followed out His teachings! That is\r\ntrue.  It is probably the effect that Jesus intended His teachings to\r\nproduce.  It is altogether improbable that He wished the world to\r\ncontinue along its present lines.  But, if these pretended followers\r\nreally think--as they say that they do--that the teachings of Jesus are\r\nridiculous and impracticable, why continue the hypocritical farce of\r\ncalling themselves \'Christians\' when they don\'t really believe in or\r\nfollow Him at all?\r\n\r\nAs Jesus himself pointed out, there\'s no sense in calling Him \'Lord,\r\nLord\' when they do not the things that He said.\r\n\r\nThis banking transaction finished, Slyme resumed his homeward way,\r\nstopping only to purchase some sweets at a confectioner\'s.  He spent a\r\nwhole sixpence at once in this shop on a glass jar of sweets for the\r\nbaby.\r\n\r\nRuth was not surprised when she saw him come in alone; it was the usual\r\nthing since Easton had become so friendly with Crass.\r\n\r\nShe made no reference to his absence, but Slyme noticed with secret\r\nchagrin that she was annoyed and disappointed.  She was just finishing\r\nscrubbing the kitchen floor and little Freddie was sitting up in a\r\nbaby\'s high chair that had a little shelf or table fixed in front of\r\nit.  To keep him amused while she did her work, Ruth had given him a\r\npiece of bread and raspberry jam, which the child had rubbed all over\r\nhis face and into his scalp, evidently being under the impression that\r\nit was something for the improvement of the complexion, or a cure for\r\nbaldness.  He now looked as if he had been in a fight or a railway\r\naccident.  The child hailed the arrival of Slyme with enthusiasm, being\r\nso overcome with emotion that he began to shed tears, and was only\r\npacified when the man gave him the jar of sweets and took him out of\r\nthe chair.\r\n\r\nSlyme\'s presence in the house had not proved so irksome as Easton and\r\nRuth had dreaded it would be.  Indeed, at first, he made a point of\r\nretiring to his own room after tea every evening, until they invited\r\nhim to stay downstairs in the kitchen.  Nearly every Wednesday and\r\nSaturday he went to a meeting, or an open-air preaching, when the\r\nweather permitted, for he was one of a little zealous band of people\r\nconnected with the Shining Light Chapel who carried on the \'open-air\'\r\nwork all the year round.  After a while, the Eastons not only became\r\nreconciled to his presence in the house, but were even glad of it. Ruth\r\nespecially would often have been very lonely if he had not been there,\r\nfor it had lately become Easton\'s custom to spend a few evenings every\r\nweek with Crass at the Cricketers.\r\n\r\nWhen at home Slyme passed his time playing a mandolin or making\r\nfretwork photo frames.  Ruth had the baby\'s photograph taken a few\r\nweeks after Slyme came, and the frame he made for it was now one of the\r\nornaments of the sitting-room.  The instinctive, unreasoning aversion\r\nshe had at first felt for him had passed away.  In a quiet, unobtrusive\r\nmanner he did her so many little services that she found it impossible\r\nto dislike him.  At first, she used to address him as \'Mr\' but after a\r\ntime she fell naturally into Easton\'s practice of calling him by his\r\nfirst name.\r\n\r\nAs for the baby, he made no secret of his affection for the lodger, who\r\nnursed and played with him for hours at a stretch.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll serve your dinner now, Alf,\' said Ruth when she had finished\r\nscrubbing the floor, \'but I\'ll wait for mine for a little while.  Will\r\nmay come.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m in no hurry,\' replied Slyme.  \'I\'ll go and have a wash; he may be\r\nhere then.\'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Slyme--who had been sitting by the fire nursing the\r\nbaby--who was trying to swallow the jar of sweets--put the child back\r\ninto the high chair, giving him one of the sticks of sweet out of the\r\njar to keep him quiet; and went upstairs to his own room.  He came down\r\nagain in about a quarter of an hour, and Ruth proceeded to serve his\r\ndinner, for Easton was still absent.\r\n\r\n\'If I was you, I wouldn\'t wait for Will,\' said Slyme, \'he may not come\r\nfor another hour or two.  It\'s after two o\'clock now, and I\'m sure you\r\nmust be hungry.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose I may as well,\' replied Ruth, hesitatingly.  \'He\'ll most\r\nlikely get some bread and cheese at the "Cricketers", same as he did\r\nlast Saturday.\'\r\n\r\n\'Almost sure to,\' responded Slyme.\r\n\r\nThe baby had had his face washed while Slyme was upstairs.  Directly he\r\nsaw his mother eating he threw away the sugar-stick and began to cry,\r\nholding out his arms to her.  She had to take him on her lap whilst she\r\nate her dinner, and feed him with pieces from her plate.\r\n\r\nSlyme talked all the time, principally about the child.  He was very\r\nfond of children, he said, and always got on well with them, but he had\r\nreally never known such an intelligent child--for his age--as Freddie.\r\nHis fellow-workmen would have been astonished had they been present to\r\nhear him talking about the shape of the baby\'s head.  They would have\r\nbeen astonished at the amount of knowledge he appeared to possess of\r\nthe science of Phrenology.  Ruth, at any rate, thought he was very\r\nclever.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the child began to grow fretful and refused to eat; when\r\nhis mother gave him a fresh piece of sugar-stick out of the jar he\r\nthrew it peevishly on the floor and began to whimper, rubbing his face\r\nagainst his mother\'s bosom and pulling at her dress with his hands.\r\nWhen Slyme first came Ruth had made a practice of withdrawing from the\r\nroom if he happened to be present when she wanted to nurse the child,\r\nbut lately she had been less sensitive. She was sitting with her back\r\nto the window and she partly covered the baby\'s face with a light shawl\r\nthat she wore.  By the time they finished dinner the child had dozed\r\noff to sleep.  Slyme got up from his chair and stood with his back to\r\nthe fire, looking down at them; presently he spoke, referring, of\r\ncourse, to the baby:\r\n\r\n\'He\'s very like you, isn\'t he?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Ruth.  \'Everyone says he takes after me.\'\r\n\r\nSlyme moved a little closer, bending down to look at the slumbering\r\ninfant.\r\n\r\n\'You know, at first I thought he was a girl,\' he continued after a\r\npause.  \'He seems almost too pretty for a boy, doesn\'t he?\'\r\n\r\nRuth smiled.  \'People always take him for a girl at first,\' she said.\r\n\'Yesterday I took him with me to the Monopole Stores to buy some\r\nthings, and the manager would hardly believe it wasn\'t a girl.\'\r\n\r\nThe man reached out his hand and stroked the baby\'s face.\r\n\r\nAlthough Slyme\'s behaviour had hitherto always been very correct, yet\r\nthere was occasionally an indefinable something in his manner when they\r\nwere alone that made Ruth feel conscious and embarrassed.  Now, as she\r\nglanced up at him and saw the expression on his face she crimsoned with\r\nconfusion and hastily lowered her eyes without replying to his last\r\nremark.  He did not speak again either, and they remained for several\r\nminutes in silence, as if spellbound, Ruth oppressed with instinctive\r\ndread, and Slyme scarcely less agitated, his face flushed and his heart\r\nbeating wildly. He trembled as he stood over her, hesitating and afraid.\r\n\r\nAnd then the silence was suddenly broken by the creaking and clanging\r\nof the front gate, heralding the tardy coming of Easton.  Slyme went\r\nout into the scullery and, taking down the blacking brushes from the\r\nshelf, began cleaning his boots.\r\n\r\nIt was plain from Easton\'s appearance and manner that he had been\r\ndrinking, but Ruth did not reproach him in any way; on the contrary,\r\nshe seemed almost feverishly anxious to attend to his comfort.\r\n\r\nWhen Slyme finished cleaning his boots he went upstairs to his room,\r\nreceiving a careless greeting from Easton as he passed through the\r\nkitchen.  He felt nervous and apprehensive that Ruth might say\r\nsomething to Easton, and was not quite able to reassure himself with\r\nthe reflection that, after all, there was nothing to tell.  As for\r\nRuth, she had to postpone the execution of her hastily formed\r\nresolution to tell her husband of Slyme\'s strange behaviour, for Easton\r\nfell asleep in his chair before he had finished his dinner, and she had\r\nsome difficulty in waking him sufficiently to persuade him to go\r\nupstairs to bed, where he remained until tea-time.  Probably he would\r\nnot have come down even then if it had not been for the fact that he\r\nhad made an appointment to meet Crass at the Cricketers.\r\n\r\nWhilst Easton was asleep, Slyme had been downstairs in the kitchen,\r\nmaking a fretwork frame.  He played with Freddie while Ruth prepared\r\nthe tea, and he appeared to her to be so unconscious of having done\r\nanything unusual that she began to think that she must have been\r\nmistaken in imagining that he had intended anything wrong.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, Slyme put on his best clothes to go to his usual \'open-air\'\r\nmeeting.  As a rule Easton and Ruth went out marketing together every\r\nSaturday night, but this evening he could not wait for her because he\r\nhad promised to meet Crass at seven o\'clock; so he arranged to see her\r\ndown town at eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 23\r\n\r\nThe \'Open-air\'\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last few weeks ever since he had been engaged on the\r\ndecoration of the drawing-room, Owen had been so absorbed in his work\r\nthat he had no time for other things.  Of course, all he was paid for\r\nwas the time he actually worked, but really every waking moment of his\r\ntime was given to the task.  Now that it was finished he felt something\r\nlike one aroused from a dream to the stern realities and terrors of\r\nlife.  By the end of next week, the inside of the house and part of the\r\noutside would be finished, and as far as he knew the firm had nothing\r\nelse to do at present.  Most of the other employers in the town were in\r\nthe same plight, and it would be of no use to apply even to such of\r\nthem as had something to do, for they were not likely to take on a\r\nfresh man while some of their regular hands were idle.\r\n\r\nFor the last month he had forgotten that he was ill; he had forgotten\r\nthat when the work at \'The Cave\' was finished he would have to stand\r\noff with the rest of the hands.  In brief, he had forgotten for the\r\ntime being that, like the majority of his fellow workmen, he was on the\r\nbrink of destitution, and that a few weeks of unemployment or idleness\r\nmeant starvation.  As far as illness was concerned, he was even worse\r\noff than most others, for the greater number of them were members of\r\nsome sick benefit club, but Owen\'s ill-health rendered him ineligible\r\nfor membership of such societies.\r\n\r\nAs he walked homewards after being paid, feeling unutterably depressed\r\nand weary, he began once more to think of the future; and the more he\r\nthought of it the more dreadful it appeared.  Even looking at it in the\r\nbest possible light--supposing he did not fall too ill to work, or lose\r\nhis employment from some other cause--what was there to live for?  He\r\nhad been working all this week.  These few coins that he held in his\r\nhand were the result, and he laughed bitterly as he thought of all they\r\nhad to try to do with this money, and of all that would have to be left\r\nundone.\r\n\r\nAs he turned the corner of Kerk Street he saw Frankie coming to meet\r\nhim, and the boy catching sight of him at the same moment began running\r\nand leapt into his arms with a joyous whoop.\r\n\r\n\'Mother told me to tell you to buy something for dinner before you come\r\nhome, because there\'s nothing in the house.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did she tell you what I was to get?\'\r\n\r\nShe did tell me something, but I forget what it was.  But I know she\r\nsaid to get anything you like if you couldn\'t get what she told me to\r\ntell you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, we\'ll go and see what we can find,\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'If I were you, I\'d get a tin of salmon or some eggs and bacon,\'\r\nsuggested Frankie as he skipped along holding his father\'s hand.  \'We\r\ndon\'t want anything that\'s a lot of trouble to cook, you know, because\r\nMum\'s not very well today.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is she up?\'\r\n\r\nShe\'s been up all the morning, but she\'s lying down now.  We\'ve done\r\nall the work, though.  While she was making the beds I started washing\r\nup the cups and saucers without telling her, but when she came in and\r\nsaw what a mess I\'d made on the floor, she had to stop me doing it, and\r\nshe had to change nearly all my clothes as well, because I was almost\r\nwet through; but I managed the wiping up all right when she did the\r\nwashing, and I swept the passage and put all my things tidy and made\r\nthe cat\'s bed.  And that just reminds me: will you please give me my\r\npenny now?  I promised the cat that I\'d bring him back some meat.\'\r\n\r\nOwen complied with the boy\'s request, and while the latter went to the\r\nbutcher\'s for the meat, Owen went into the grocer\'s to get something\r\nfor dinner, it being arranged that they were to meet again at the\r\ncorner of the street.  Owen was at the appointed place first and after\r\nwaiting some time and seeing no sign of the boy he decided to go\r\ntowards the butcher\'s to meet him.  When he came in sight of the shop\r\nhe saw the boy standing outside in earnest conversation with the\r\nbutcher, a jolly-looking stoutly built man, with a very red face. Owen\r\nperceived at once that the child was trying to explain something,\r\nbecause Frankie had a habit of holding his head sideways and\r\nsupplementing his speech by spreading out his fingers and making quaint\r\ngestures with his hands whenever he found it difficult to make himself\r\nunderstood.  The boy was doing this now, waving one hand about with the\r\nfingers and thumb extended wide, and with the other flourishing a paper\r\nparcel which evidently contained the pieces of meat. Presently the man\r\nlaughed heartily and after shaking hands with Frankie went into the\r\nshop to attend to a customer, and Frankie rejoined his father.\r\n\r\n\'That butcher\'s a very decent sort of chap, you know, Dad,\' he said.\r\n\'He wouldn\'t take a penny for the meat.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is that what you were talking to him about?\'\r\n\r\nNo; we were talking about Socialism.  You see, this is the second time\r\nhe wouldn\'t take the money, and the first time he did it I thought he\r\nmust be a Socialist, but I didn\'t ask him then.  But when he did it\r\nagain this time I asked him if he was.  So he said, No.  He said he\r\nwasn\'t quite mad yet.  So I said, "If you think that Socialists are all\r\nmad, you\'re very much mistaken, because I\'m a Socialist myself, and I\'m\r\nquite sure I\'M not mad."  So he said he knew I was all right, but he\r\ndidn\'t understand anything about Socialism himself--only that it meant\r\nsharing out all the money so that everyone could have the same.  So\r\nthen I told him that\'s not Socialism at all!  And when I explained it\r\nto him properly and advised him to be one, he said he\'d think about it.\r\nSo I said if he\'d only do that he\'d be sure to change over to our side;\r\nand then he laughed and promised to let me know next time he sees me,\r\nand I promised to lend him some literature. You won\'t mind, will you,\r\nDad?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course not; when we get home we\'ll have a look through what we\'ve\r\ngot and you can take him some of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know!\' cried Frankie eagerly.  \'The two very best of all.  Happy\r\nBritain and England for the English.\'\r\n\r\nHe knew that these were \'two of the best\' because he had often heard\r\nhis father and mother say so, and he had noticed that whenever a\r\nSocialist friend came to visit them, he was also of the same opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a rule on Saturday evenings they all three went out together to do\r\nthe marketing, but on this occasion, in consequence of Nora being\r\nunwell, Owen and Frankie went by themselves.  The frequent recurrence\r\nof his wife\'s illness served to increase Owen\'s pessimism with regard\r\nto the future, and the fact that he was unable to procure for her the\r\ncomforts she needed was not calculated to dispel the depression that\r\nfilled his mind as he reflected that there was no hope of better times.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, for a workman there is no hope of\r\nadvancement.  After he has learnt his trade and become a \'journeyman\'\r\nall progress ceases.  He is at the goal.  After he has been working ten\r\nor twenty years he commands no more than he did at first--a bare living\r\nwage--sufficient money to purchase fuel to keep the human machine\r\nworking.  As he grows older he will have to be content with even less;\r\nand all the time he holds his employment at the caprice and by the\r\nfavour of his masters, who regard him merely as a piece of mechanism\r\nthat enables them to accumulate money--a thing which they are justified\r\nin casting aside as soon as it becomes unprofitable. And the workman\r\nmust not only be an efficient money-producing machine, but he must also\r\nbe the servile subject of his masters.  If he is not abjectly civil and\r\nhumble, if he will not submit tamely to insult, indignity, and every\r\nform of contemptuous treatment that occasion makes possible, he can be\r\ndismissed, and replaced in a moment by one of the crowd of unemployed\r\nwho are always waiting for his job.  This is the status of the majority\r\nof the \'Heirs of all the ages\' under the present system.\r\n\r\nAs he walked through the crowded streets holding Frankie by the hand,\r\nOwen thought that to voluntarily continue to live such a life as this\r\nbetokened a degraded mind.  To allow one\'s child to grow up to suffer\r\nit in turn was an act of callous, criminal cruelty.\r\n\r\nIn this matter he held different opinions from most of his fellow\r\nworkmen.  The greater number of them were quite willing and content\r\nthat their children should be made into beasts of burden for the\r\nbenefit of other people.  As he looked down upon the little, frail\r\nfigure trotting along by his side, Owen thought for the thousandth time\r\nthat it would be far better for the child to die now: he would never be\r\nfit to be a soldier in the ferocious Christian Battle of Life.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered Nora.  Although she was always brave, and never\r\ncomplained, he knew that her life was one of almost incessant physical\r\nsuffering; and as for himself he was tired and sick of it all.  He had\r\nbeen working like a slave all his life and there was nothing to show\r\nfor it--there never would be anything to show for it.  He thought of\r\nthe man who had killed his wife and children.  The jury had returned\r\nthe usual verdict, \'Temporary Insanity\'.  It never seemed to occur to\r\nthese people that the truth was that to continue to suffer hopelessly\r\nlike this was evidence of permanent insanity.\r\n\r\nBut supposing that bodily death was not the end.  Suppose there was\r\nsome kind of a God?  If there were, it wasn\'t unreasonable to think\r\nthat the Being who was capable of creating such a world as this and who\r\nseemed so callously indifferent to the unhappiness of His creatures,\r\nwould also be capable of devising and creating the other Hell that most\r\npeople believed in.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was December the evening was mild and clear.  The full moon\r\ndeluged the town with silvery light, and the cloudless sky was jewelled\r\nwith myriads of glittering stars.\r\n\r\nLooking out into the unfathomable infinity of space, Owen wondered what\r\nmanner of Being or Power it was that had originated and sustained all\r\nthis?  Considered as an explanation of the existence of the universe,\r\nthe orthodox Christian religion was too absurd to merit a second\r\nthought.  But then, every other conceivable hypothesis was\r\nalso--ultimately--unsatisfactory and even ridiculous.  To believe that\r\nthe universe as it is now has existed from all eternity without any\r\nCause is surely ridiculous.  But to say that it was created by a Being\r\nwho existed without a Cause from all eternity is equally ridiculous.\r\nIn fact, it was only postponing the difficulty one stage.  Evolution\r\nwas not more satisfactory, because although it was undoubtedly true as\r\nfar as it went, it only went part of the way, leaving the great\r\nquestion still unanswered by assuming the existence--in the\r\nbeginning--of the elements of matter, without a cause!  The question\r\nremained unanswered because it was unanswerable.  Regarding this\r\nproblem man was but--\r\n\r\n        \'An infant crying in the night,\r\n        An infant crying for the light\r\n        And with no language but a cry.\'\r\n\r\nAll the same, it did not follow, because one could not explain the\r\nmystery oneself, that it was right to try to believe an unreasonable\r\nexplanation offered by someone else.\r\n\r\nBut although he reasoned like this, Owen could not help longing for\r\nsomething to believe, for some hope for the future; something to\r\ncompensate for the unhappiness of the present.  In one sense, he\r\nthought, how good it would be if Christianity were true, and after all\r\nthe sorrow there was to be an eternity of happiness such as it had\r\nnever entered into the heart of man to conceive?  If only that were\r\ntrue, nothing else would matter. How contemptible and insignificant the\r\nvery worst that could happen here would be if one knew that this life\r\nwas only a short journey that was to terminate at the beginning of an\r\neternity of joy?  But no one really believed this; and as for those who\r\npretended to do so--their lives showed that they did not believe it at\r\nall.  Their greed and inhumanity--their ferocious determination to\r\nsecure for themselves the good things of THIS world--were conclusive\r\nproofs of their hypocrisy and infidelity.\r\n\r\n\'Dad,\' said Frankie, suddenly, \'let\'s go over and hear what that man\'s\r\nsaying.\' He pointed across the way to where--a little distance back\r\nfrom the main road, just round the corner of a side street--a group of\r\npeople were standing encircling a large lantern fixed on the top of a\r\npole about seven feet high, which was being held by one of the men. A\r\nbright light was burning inside this lantern and on the pane of white,\r\nobscured glass which formed the sides, visible from where Owen and\r\nFrankie were standing, was written in bold plain letters that were\r\nreadable even at that distance, the text:\r\n\r\n        \'Be not deceived: God is not mocked!\'\r\n\r\nThe man whose voice had attracted Frankie\'s attention was reading out a\r\nverse of a hymn:\r\n\r\n        \'I heard the voice of Jesus say,\r\n        Behold, I freely give,\r\n        The living water, thirsty one,\r\n        Stoop down and drink, and live.\r\n        I came to Jesus and I drank\r\n        Of that life giving stream,\r\n        My thirst was quenched,\r\n        My soul revived,\r\n        And now I live in Him.\'\r\n\r\nThe individual who gave out this hymn was a tall, thin man whose\r\nclothes hung loosely on the angles of his round-shouldered, bony form.\r\nHis long, thin legs--about which the baggy trousers hung in ungraceful\r\nfolds--were slightly knock-kneed, and terminated in large, flat feet.\r\nHis arms were very long even for such a tall man, and the huge, bony\r\nhands were gnarled and knotted.  Regardless of the season, he had\r\nremoved his bowler hat, revealing his forehead, which was high, flat\r\nand narrow.  His nose was a large, fleshy, hawklike beak, and from the\r\nside of each nostril a deep indentation extended downwards until it\r\ndisappeared in the drooping moustache that concealed his mouth when he\r\nwas not speaking, but the vast extent of which was perceptible now as\r\nhe opened it to call out the words of the hymn. His chin was large and\r\nextraordinarily long: the eyes were pale blue, very small and close\r\ntogether, surmounted by spare, light-coloured, almost invisible\r\neyebrows with a deep vertical cleft between them over the nose.  His\r\nhead--covered with thick, coarse brown hair--was very large, especially\r\nat the back; the ears were small and laid close to the head.  If one\r\nwere to make a full-face drawing of his cadaverous visage, it would be\r\nfound that the outline resembled that of the lid of a coffin.\r\n\r\nAs Owen and Frankie drew near, the boy tugged at his father\'s hand and\r\nwhispered: \'Dad! that\'s the teacher at the Sunday School where I went\r\nthat day with Charley and Elsie.\'\r\n\r\nOwen looked quickly and saw that it was Hunter.\r\n\r\nAs Hunter ceased reading out the words of the hymn, the little company\r\nof evangelists began to sing, accompanied by the strains of a small but\r\npeculiarly sweet-toned organ.  A few persons in the crowd joined in,\r\nthe words being familiar to them.  During the singing their faces were\r\na study, they all looked so profoundly solemn and miserable, as if they\r\nwere a gang of condemned criminals waiting to be led forth to\r\nexecution.  The great number of the people standing around appeared to\r\nbe listening more out of idle curiosity than anything else, and two\r\nwell-dressed young men--evidently strangers and visitors to the\r\ntown--amused themselves by making audible remarks about the texts on\r\nthe lantern.  There was also a shabbily dressed, semi-drunken man in a\r\nbattered bowler hat who stood on the inner edge of the crowd, almost in\r\nthe ring itself, with folded arms and an expression of scorn.  He had a\r\nvery thin, pale face with a large, high-bridged nose, and bore a\r\nstriking resemblance to the First Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nAs the singing proceeded, the scornful expression faded from the visage\r\nof the Semi-drunk, and he not only joined in, but unfolded his arms and\r\nbegan waving them about as if he were conducting the music.\r\n\r\nBy the time the singing was over a considerable crowd had gathered, and\r\nthen one of the evangelists, the same man who had given out the hymn,\r\nstepped into the middle of the ring.  He had evidently been offended by\r\nthe unseemly conduct of the two well-dressed young men, for after a\r\npreliminary glance round upon the crowd, he fixed his gaze upon the\r\npair, and immediately launched out upon a long tirade against what he\r\ncalled \'Infidelity\'.  Then, having heartily denounced all those who--as\r\nhe put it--\'refused\' to believe, he proceeded to ridicule those\r\nhalf-and-half believers, who, while professing to believe the Bible,\r\nrejected the doctrine of Hell.  That the existence of a place of\r\neternal torture is taught in the Bible, he tried to prove by a long\r\nsuccession of texts.  As he proceeded he became very excited, and the\r\ncontemptuous laughter of the two unbelievers seemed to make him worse.\r\nHe shouted and raved, literally foaming at the mouth and glaring in a\r\nfrenzied manner around upon the faces of the crowd.\r\n\r\n\'There is a Hell!\' he shouted.  \'And understand this clearly--"The\r\nwicked shall be turned into hell"--"He that believeth not shall be\r\ndamned."\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, then, you\'ll stand a very good chance of being damned also,\'\r\nexclaimed one of the two young men.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow do you make it out?\' demanded the preacher, wiping the froth from\r\nhis lips and the perspiration from his forehead with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\'Why, because you don\'t believe the Bible yourselves.\'\r\n\r\nNimrod and the other evangelists laughed, and looked pityingly at the\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, my dear brother,\' said Misery.  \'That\'s your delusion.  I thank\r\nGod I do believe it, every word!\'\r\n\r\n\'Amen,\' fervently ejaculated Slyme and several of the other disciples.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, you don\'t,\' replied the other.  \'And I can prove you don\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Prove it, then,\' said Nimrod.\r\n\r\n\'Read out the 17th and 18th verses of the XVIth chapter of Mark,\' said\r\nthe disturber of the meeting.  The crowd began to close in on the\r\ncentre, the better to hear the dispute.  Misery, standing close to the\r\nlantern, found the verse mentioned and read aloud as follows:\r\n\r\n\'And these signs shall follow them that believe.  In my name shall they\r\ncast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues.  They shall take up\r\nserpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them:\r\nthey shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you can\'t heal the sick, neither can you speak new languages or\r\ncast out devils: but perhaps you can drink deadly things without\r\nsuffering harm.\'  The speaker here suddenly drew from his waistcoat\r\npocket a small glass bottle and held it out towards Misery, who shrank\r\nfrom it with horror as he continued: \'I have here a most deadly poison.\r\nThere is in this bottle sufficient strychnine to kill a dozen\r\nunbelievers.  Drink it!  And if it doesn\'t harm you, we\'ll know that\r\nyou really are a believer and that what you believe is the truth!\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear!\' said the Semi-drunk, who had listened to the progress of\r\nthe argument with great interest.  \'\'Ear, \'ear!  That\'s fair enough.\r\nGit it acrost yer chest.\'\r\n\r\nSome of the people in the crowd began to laugh, and voices were heard\r\nfrom several quarters calling upon Misery to drink the strychnine.\r\n\r\n\'Now, if you\'ll allow me, I\'ll explain to you what that there verse\r\nmeans,\' said Hunter.  \'If you read it carefully--WITH the context--\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want you to tell me what it means,\' interrupted the other. \'I\r\nam able to read for myself.  Whatever you may say, or pretend to think\r\nit means, I know what it says.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hear, Hear,\' shouted several voices, and angry cries of \'Why don\'t you\r\ndrink the poison?\' began to be heard from the outskirts of the crowd.\r\n\r\n\'Are you going to drink it or not?\' demanded the man with the bottle.\r\n\r\n\'No!  I\'m not such a fool!\' retorted Misery, fiercely, and a loud shout\r\nof laughter broke from the crowd.\'\r\n\r\n\'P\'haps some of the other "believers" would like to,\' said the young\r\nman sneeringly, looking round upon the disciples.  As no one seemed\r\ndesirous of availing himself of this offer, the man returned the bottle\r\nregretfully to his pocket.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose,\' said Misery, regarding the owner of the strychnine with a\r\nsneer, \'I suppose you\'re one of them there hired critics wot\'s goin\'\r\nabout the country doin\' the Devil\'s work?\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot I wants to know is this \'ere,\' said the Semi-drunk, suddenly\r\nadvancing into the middle of the ring and speaking in a loud voice.\r\n\'Where did Cain get \'is wife from?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t answer \'im, Brother \'Unter,\' said Mr Didlum, one of the\r\ndisciples.  This was rather an unnecessary piece of advice, because\r\nMisery did not know the answer.\r\n\r\nAn individual in a long black garment--the \'minister\'--now whispered\r\nsomething to Miss Didlum, who was seated at the organ, whereupon she\r\nbegan to play, and the \'believers\' began to sing, as loud as they could\r\nso as to drown the voices of the disturbers of the meeting, a song\r\ncalled \'Oh, that will be Glory for me!\'\r\n\r\nAfter this hymn the \'minister\' invited a shabbily dressed \'brother\'--a\r\nworking-man member of the PSA, to say a \'few words\', and the latter\r\naccordingly stepped into the centre of the ring and held forth as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\'My dear frens, I thank Gord tonight that I can stand \'ere tonight,\r\nhout in the hopen hair and tell hall you dear people tonight of hall\r\nwot\'s been done for ME.  Ho my dear frens hi ham so glad tonight as I\r\ncan stand \'ere tonight and say as hall my sins is hunder the blood\r\ntonight and wot \'E\'s done for me \'E can do for you tonight.  If you\'ll\r\nhonly do as I done and just acknowledge yourself a lost sinner--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes! that\'s the honly way!\' shouted Nimrod.\r\n\r\n\'Amen,\' cried all the other believers.\r\n\r\n\'--If you\'ll honly come to \'im tonight in the same way as I done you\'ll\r\nsee wot \'E\'s done for me \'E can do for you.  Ho my dear frens, don\'t go\r\nputtin\' it orf from day to day like a door turnin\' on its \'inges, don\'t\r\nput orf to some more convenient time because you may never \'ave another\r\nchance.  \'Im that bein\' orfen reproved \'ardeneth \'is neck shall be\r\nsuddenly cut orf and that without remedy.  Ho come to \'im tonight, for\r\n\'Is name\'s sake and to \'Im we\'ll give hall the glory.  Amen.\'\r\n\r\n\'Amen,\' said the believers, fervently, and then the man who was dressed\r\nin the long garment entreated all those who were not yet true\r\nbelievers--and doers--of the word to join earnestly and MEANINGLY in\r\nthe singing of the closing hymn, which he was about to read out to them.\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk obligingly conducted as before, and the crowd faded away\r\nwith the last notes of the music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 24\r\n\r\nRuth\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, hitherto Slyme had passed the greater\r\nnumber of his evenings at home, but during the following three weeks a\r\nchange took place in his habits in this respect.  He now went out\r\nnearly every night and did not return until after ten o\'clock.  On\r\nmeeting nights he always changed his attire, dressing himself as on\r\nSundays, but on the other occasions he went out in his week-day\r\nclothes.  Ruth often wondered where he went on those nights, but he\r\nnever volunteered the information and she never asked him.\r\n\r\nEaston had chummed up with a lot of the regular customers at the\r\n\'Cricketers\', where he now spent most of his spare time, drinking beer,\r\ntelling yarns or playing shove-ha\'penny or hooks and rings. When he had\r\nno cash the Old Dear gave him credit until Saturday.  At first, the\r\nplace had not had much attraction for him, and he really went there\r\nonly for the purpose of \'keeping in\' with Crass: but after a time he\r\nfound it a very congenial way of passing his evenings...\r\n\r\nOne evening, Ruth saw Slyme meet Crass as if by appointment and as the\r\ntwo men went away together she returned to her housework wondering what\r\nit meant.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Crass and Slyme proceeded on their way down town.  It was\r\nabout half past six o\'clock: the shops and streets were brilliantly\r\nlighted, and as they went along they saw numerous groups of men talking\r\ntogether in a listless way.  Most of them were artisans and labourers\r\nout of employment and evidently in no great hurry to go home.  Some of\r\nthem had neither tea nor fire to go to, and stayed away from home as\r\nlong as possible so as not to be compelled to look upon the misery of\r\nthose who were waiting for them there.  Others hung about hoping\r\nagainst all probability that they might even yet--although it was so\r\nlate--hear of some job to be started somewhere or other.\r\n\r\nAs they passed one of these groups they recognized and nodded to Newman\r\nand old Jack Linden, and the former left the others and came up to\r\nCrass and Slyme, who did not pause, so Newman walked along with them.\r\n\r\n\'Anything fresh in, Bob?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'No; we ain\'t got \'ardly anything,\' replied Crass.  \'I reckon we shall\r\nfinish up at "The Cave" next week, and then I suppose we shall all be\r\nstood orf.  We\'ve got several plumbers on, and I believe there\'s a\r\nlittle gas-fitting work in, but next to nothing in our line.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose you don\'t know of any other firm what\'s got anything?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I don\'t, mate.  Between you and me, I don\'t think any of \'em has;\r\nthey\'re all in about the same fix.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve not done anything since I left, you know,\' said Newman, \'and\r\nwe\'ve just about got as far as we can get, at home.\'\r\n\r\nSlyme and Crass said nothing in reply to this.  They wished that Newman\r\nwould take himself off, because they did not want him to know where\r\nthey were going.\r\n\r\nHowever, Newman continued to accompany them and an awkward silence\r\nsucceeded.  He seemed to wish to say something more, and they both\r\nguessed what it was.  So they walked along as rapidly as possible in\r\norder not to give him any encouragement.  At last Newman blurted out:\r\n\r\n\'I suppose--you don\'t happen--either of you--to have a tanner you could\r\nlend me?  I\'ll let you have it back--when I get a job.\'\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t mate,\' replied Crass.  \'I\'m sorry; if I \'ad one on me, you\r\nshould \'ave it, with pleasure.\'\r\n\r\nSlyme also expressed his regret that he had no money with him, and at\r\nthe corner of the next street Newman--ashamed of having asked--wished\r\nthem \'good night\' and went away.\r\n\r\nSlyme and Crass hurried along and presently arrived at Rushton & Co.\'s\r\nshop.  The windows were lit up with electric light, displaying an\r\nassortment of wallpapers, gas and electric light fittings, glass\r\nshades, globes, tins of enamel, paint and varnish.  Several framed\r\nshow-cards--\'Estimates Free\', \'First class work only, at moderate\r\ncharges\', \'Only First Class Workmen Employed\' and several others of the\r\nsame type.  On one side wall of the window was a large shield-shaped\r\nboard covered with black velvet on which a number of brass fittings for\r\ncoffins were arranged.  The shield was on an oak mount with the\r\ninscription: \'Funerals conducted on modern principles\'.\r\n\r\nSlyme waited outside while Crass went in.  Mr Budd, the shopman, was\r\ndown at the far end near the glazed partition which separated Mr\r\nRushton\'s office from the front shop.  As Crass entered, Budd--who was\r\na pale-faced, unhealthy-looking, undersized youth about twenty years of\r\nage--looked round and, with a grimace, motioned him to walk softly.\r\nCrass paused, wondering what the other meant; but the shopman beckoned\r\nhim to advance, grinning and winking and jerking his thumb over his\r\nshoulder in the direction of the office.  Crass hesitated, fearing that\r\npossibly the miserable Budd had gone--or been driven--out of his mind;\r\nbut as the latter continued to beckon and grin and point towards the\r\noffice Crass screwed up his courage and followed him behind one of the\r\nshowcases, and applying his eye to a crack in the woodwork of the\r\npartition indicated by Budd, he could see Mr Rushton in the act of\r\nkissing and embracing Miss Wade, the young lady clerk. Crass watched\r\nthem for some time and then whispered to Budd to call Slyme, and when\r\nthe latter came they all three took turns at peeping through the crack\r\nin the partition.\r\n\r\nWhen they had looked their fill they came out from behind the showcase,\r\nalmost bursting with suppressed merriment.  Budd reached down a key\r\nfrom where it was hanging on a hook on the wall and gave it to Crass\r\nand the two resumed their interrupted journey.  But before they had\r\nproceeded a dozen yards from the shop, they were accosted by a short,\r\nelderly man with grey hair and a beard.  This man looked about\r\nsixty-five years of age, and was very shabbily dressed.  The ends of\r\nthe sleeves of his coat were frayed and ragged, and the elbows were\r\nworn threadbare.  His boots were patched, broken, and down at heel, and\r\nthe knees and bottoms of the legs of his trousers were in the same\r\ncondition as the sleeves of his coat.  This man\'s name was Latham; he\r\nwas a venetian blind maker and repairer.  With his son, he was supposed\r\nto be \'in business\' on his own account, but as most of their work was\r\ndone for \'the trade\', that is, for such firms as Rushton & Co., they\r\nwould be more correctly described as men who did piecework at home.\r\n\r\nHe had been \'in business\'--as he called it--for about forty years\r\nworking, working, always working; and ever since his son became old\r\nenough to labour he had helped his father in the philanthropic task of\r\nmanufacturing profits for the sweaters who employed them.  They had\r\nbeen so busy running after work, and working for the benefit of others,\r\nthat they had overlooked the fact that they were only earning a bare\r\nliving for themselves and now, after forty years\' hard labour, the old\r\nman was clothed in rags and on the verge of destitution.\r\n\r\n\'Is Rushton there?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think so,\' replied Crass, attempting to pass on; but the old\r\nman detained him.\r\n\r\n\'He promised to let us know about them blinds for "The Cave".  We gave\r\n\'im a price for \'em about a month ago.  In fact, we gave \'im two\r\nprices, because he said the first was too high.  Five and six a set I\r\nasked \'im!  take \'em right through the \'ole \'ouse! one with\r\nanother--big and little.  Two coats of paint, and new tapes and cords.\r\nThat wasn\'t too much, was it?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Crass, walking on; \'that was cheap enough!\'\r\n\r\nHE said it was too much,\' continued Latham.  \'Said as \'e could get \'em\r\ndone cheaper!  But I say as no one can\'t do it and make a living.\'\r\n\r\nAs he walked along, talking, between Crass and Slyme, the old man\r\nbecame very excited.\r\n\r\n\'But we \'adn\'t nothing to do to speak of, so my son told \'im we\'d do\r\n\'em for five bob a set, and \'e said \'e\'d let us know, but we ain\'t\r\n\'eard nothing from \'im yet, so I thought I\'d try and see \'im tonight.\'\r\n\r\nWell, you\'ll find \'im in there now,\' said Slyme with a peculiar look,\r\nand walking faster.  \'Good night.\'\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t take \'em on for no less!\' cried the old man as he turned back.\r\nI\'ve got my livin\' to get, and my son\'s got \'is wife and little \'uns to\r\nkeep.  We can\'t work for nothing!\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly not,\' said Crass, glad to get away at last.  \'Good night,\r\nand good luck to you.\'\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were out of hearing, they both burst out laughing at\r\nthe old man\'s vehemence.\r\n\r\n\'Seemed quite upset about it,\' said Slyme; and they laughed again.\r\n\r\nThey now left the main road and pursued their way through a number of\r\nbadly lighted, mean-looking streets, and finally turning down a kind of\r\nalley, arrived at their destination.  On one side of this street was a\r\nrow of small houses; facing these were a number of buildings of a\r\nmiscellaneous description--sheds and stables; and beyond these a plot\r\nof waste ground on which could be seen, looming weirdly through the\r\ndusk, a number of empty carts and waggons with their shafts resting on\r\nthe ground or reared up into the air.  Threading their way carefully\r\nthrough these and avoiding as much as possible the mud, pools of water,\r\nand rubbish which covered the ground, they arrived at a large gate\r\nfastened with a padlock.  Applying the key, Crass swung back the gate\r\nand they found themselves in a large yard filled with building\r\nmaterials and plant, ladders, huge tressels, planks and beams of wood,\r\nhand-carts, and wheelbarrows, heaps of sand and mortar and innumerable\r\nother things that assumed strange fantastic shapes in the\r\nsemi-darkness.  Crates and packing cases, lengths of iron guttering and\r\nrain-pipes, old door-frames and other woodwork that had been taken from\r\nbuildings where alterations had been made.  And over all these things,\r\na gloomy, indistinct and shapeless mass, rose the buildings and sheds\r\nthat comprised Rushton & Co.\'s workshop.\r\n\r\nCrass struck a match, and Slyme, stooping down, drew a key from a\r\ncrevice in the wall near one of the doors, which he unlocked, and they\r\nentered.  Crass struck another match and lit the gas at the jointed\r\nbracket fixed to the wall.  This was the paint-shop.  At one end was a\r\nfireplace without a grate but with an iron bar fixed across the\r\nblackened chimney for the purpose of suspending pails or pots over the\r\nfire, which was usually made of wood on the hearthstone.  All round the\r\nwalls of the shop--which had once been whitewashed, but were now\r\ncovered with smears of paint of every colour where the men had \'rubbed\r\nout\' their brushes--were rows of shelves with kegs of paint upon them.\r\nIn front of the window was a long bench covered with an untidy litter\r\nof dirty paint-pots, including several earthenware mixing vessels or\r\nmortars, the sides of these being thickly coated with dried paint.\r\nScattered about the stone floor were a number of dirty pails, either\r\nempty or containing stale whitewash; and standing on a sort of low\r\nplatform or shelf at one end of the shop were four large round tanks\r\nfitted with taps and labelled \'Boiled Oil\', \'Turps\', \'Linseed Oil\',\r\n\'Turps Substitute\'.  The lower parts of the walls were discoloured with\r\nmoisture.  The atmosphere was cold and damp and foul with the sickening\r\nodours of the poisonous materials.\r\n\r\nIt was in this place that Bert--the apprentice--spent most of his time,\r\ncleaning out pots and pails, during slack periods when there were no\r\njobs going on outside.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the shop, under a two-armed gas pendant, was another\r\ntable or bench, also thickly coated with old, dried paint, and by the\r\nside of this were two large stands on which were hanging up to dry some\r\nof the lathes of the venetian blinds belonging to \'The Cave\', which\r\nCrass and Slyme were painting--piecework--in their spare time. The\r\nremainder of the lathes were leaning against the walls or piled in\r\nstacks on the table.\r\n\r\nCrass shivered with cold as he lit the two gas-jets.  \'Make a bit of a\r\nfire, Alf, he said, \'while I gets the colour ready.\'\r\n\r\nSlyme went outside and presently returned with his arms full of old\r\nwood, which he smashed up and threw into the fireplace; then he took an\r\nempty paint-pot and filled it with turpentine from the big tank and\r\nemptied it over the wood.  Amongst the pots on the mixing bench he\r\nfound one full of old paint, and he threw this over the wood also, and\r\nin a few minutes he had made a roaring fire.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Crass had prepared the paint and brushes and taken down the\r\nlathes from the drying frames.  The two men now proceeded with the\r\npainting of the blinds, working rapidly, each lathe being hung on the\r\nwires of the drying frame after being painted.  They talked freely as\r\nthey worked, having no fear of being overheard by Rushton or Nimrod.\r\nThis job was piecework, so it didn\'t matter whether they talked or not.\r\nThey waxed hilarious over Old Latham\'s discomfiture and wondered what\r\nhe would say if he could see them now.  Then the conversation drifted\r\nto the subject of the private characters of the other men who were\r\nemployed by Rushton & Co., and an impartial listener--had there been\r\none there--would have been forced to come to the same conclusion as\r\nCrass and Slyme did: namely, that they themselves were the only two\r\ndecent fellows on the firm.  There was something wrong or shady about\r\neverybody else.  That bloke Barrington, for instance--it was a very\r\nfunny business, you know, for a chap like \'im to be workin\' as a\r\nlabourer, it looked very suspicious.  Nobody knowed exactly who \'e was\r\nor where \'e come from, but anyone could tell \'e\'d been a toff.  It was\r\nvery certain \'e\'d never bin brought up to work for \'is livin\'.  The\r\nmost probable explanation was that \'e\'d committed some crime and bin\r\ndisowned by \'is family--pinched some money, or forged a cheque or\r\nsomething like that.  Then there was that Sawkins.  He was no class\r\nwhatever.  It was a well-known fact that he used to go round to\r\nMisery\'s house nearly every night to tell him every little thing that\r\nhad happened on the job during the day!  As for Payne, the foreman\r\ncarpenter, the man was a perfect fool: he\'d find out the difference if\r\never he got the sack from Rushton\'s and went to work for some other\r\nfirm!  He didn\'t understand his trade, and he couldn\'t make a coffin\r\nproperly to save \'is life!  Then there was that rotter Owen; there was\r\na bright specimen for yer!  An Atheist! didn\'t believe in no God or\r\nDevil or nothing else.  A pretty state of things there would be if\r\nthese Socialists could have their own way: for one thing, nobody would\r\nbe allowed to work overtime!\r\n\r\nCrass and Slyme worked and talked in this manner till ten o\'clock, and\r\nthen they extinguished the fire by throwing some water on it--put out\r\nthe gas and locked up the shop and the yard, dropping the key of the\r\nlatter into the letter-box at Rushton\'s office on their way home.\r\n\r\nIn this way they worked at the blinds nearly every night for three\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Saturday arrived the men working at \'The Cave\' were again\r\nsurprised that nobody was sacked, and they were divided in opinion as\r\nto the reason, some thinking that Nimrod was determined to keep them\r\nall on till the job was finished, so as to get it done as quickly as\r\npossible; and others boldly asserting the truth of a rumour that had\r\nbeen going about for several days that the firm had another big job in.\r\nMr Sweater had bought another house; Rushton had to do it up, and they\r\nwere all to be kept on to start this other work as soon as \'The Cave\'\r\nwas finished.  Crass knew no more than anyone else and he maintained a\r\ndiscreet silence, but the fact that he did not contradict the rumour\r\nserved to strengthen it.  The only foundation that existed for this\r\nreport was that Rushton and Misery had been seen looking over the\r\ngarden gate of a large empty house near \'The Cave\'.  But although it\r\nhad such an insignificant beginning, the rumour had grown and increased\r\nin detail and importance day by day.  That very morning at\r\nbreakfast-time, the man on the pail had announced that he had heard on\r\nthe very best authority that Mr Sweater had sold all his interest in\r\nthe great business that bore his name and was about to retire into\r\nprivate life, and that he intended to buy up all the house property in\r\nthe neighbourhood of \'The Cave\'.  Another individual--one of the new\r\nhands--said that he had heard someone else--in a public house--say that\r\nRushton was about to marry one of Sweater\'s daughters, and that Sweater\r\nintended to give the couple a house to live in, as a wedding present:\r\nbut the fact that Rushton was already married and the father of four\r\nchildren, rather knocked the bottom out of this story, so it was\r\nregretfully dismissed.  Whatever the reason, the fact remained that\r\nnobody had been discharged, and when pay-time arrived they set out for\r\nthe office in high spirits.\r\n\r\nThat evening, the weather being fine, Slyme went out as usual to his\r\nopen-air meeting, but Easton departed from HIS usual custom of rushing\r\noff to the \'Cricketers\' directly he had had his tea, having on this\r\noccasion promised to wait for Ruth and to go with her to do the\r\nmarketing.  The baby was left at home alone, asleep in the cradle.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had made all their purchases they had a fairly heavy\r\nload.  Easton carried the string-bag containing the potatoes and other\r\nvegetables, and the meat, and Ruth, the groceries.  On their way home,\r\nthey had to pass the \'Cricketers\' and just before they reached that\r\npart of their journey they met Mr and Mrs Crass, who were also out\r\nmarketing.  They both insisted on Easton and Ruth going in to have a\r\ndrink with them.  Ruth did not want to go, but she allowed herself to\r\nbe persuaded for she could see that Easton was beginning to get angry\r\nwith her for refusing.  Crass had on a new overcoat and a new hat, with\r\ndark grey trousers and yellow boots, and a \'stand-up\' collar with a\r\nbright blue tie.  His wife--a fat, vulgar-looking, well-preserved woman\r\nabout forty--was arrayed in a dark red \'motor\' costume, with hat to\r\nmatch.  Both Easton and Ruth--whose best clothes had all been pawned to\r\nraise the money to pay the poor rate--felt very mean and shabby before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen they got inside, Crass paid for the first round of drinks, a pint\r\nof Old Six for himself; the same for Easton, half a pint for Mrs Easton\r\nand threepenny-worth of gin for Mrs Crass.\r\n\r\nThe Besotted Wretch was there, just finishing a game of hooks and rings\r\nwith the Semi-drunk--who had called round on the day after he was\r\nthrown out, to apologize for his conduct to the Old Dear, and had since\r\nthen become one of the regular customers.  Philpot was absent. He had\r\nbeen there that afternoon, so the Old Dear said, but he had gone home\r\nabout five o\'clock, and had not been back since.  He was almost sure to\r\nlook in again in the course of the evening.\r\n\r\nAlthough the house was not nearly so full as it would have been if\r\ntimes had been better, there was a large number of people there, for\r\nthe \'Cricketers\' was one of the most popular houses in the town.\r\nAnother thing that helped to make them busy was the fact that two other\r\npublic houses in the vicinity had recently been closed up. There were\r\npeople in all the compartments.  Some of the seats in the public bar\r\nwere occupied by women, some young and accompanied by their husbands,\r\nsome old and evidently sodden with drink.  In one corner of the public\r\nbar, drinking beer or gin with a number of young fellows, were three\r\nyoung girls who worked at a steam laundry in the neighbourhood.  Two\r\nlarge, fat, gipsy-looking women: evidently hawkers, for on the floor\r\nbeside them were two baskets containing bundles of\r\nflowers--chrysanthemums and Michaelmas daisies.  There were also two\r\nvery plainly and shabbily dressed women about thirty-five years of age,\r\nwho were always to be found there on Saturday nights, drinking with any\r\nman who was willing to pay for them.  The behaviour of these two women\r\nwas very quiet and their manners unobtrusive.  They seemed to realize\r\nthat they were there only on sufferance, and their demeanour was\r\nshamefaced and humble.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the guests were standing.  The floor was sprinkled with\r\nsawdust which served to soak up the beer that slopped out of the\r\nglasses of those whose hands were too unsteady to hold them upright.\r\nThe air was foul with the smell of beer, spirits and tobacco smoke, and\r\nthe uproar was deafening, for nearly everyone was talking at the same\r\ntime, their voices clashing discordantly with the strains of the\r\nPolyphone, which was playing \'The Garden of Your Heart\'.  In one corner\r\na group of men convulsed with laughter at the details of a dirty story\r\nrelated by one of their number.  Several impatient customers were\r\nbanging the bottoms of their empty glasses or pewters on the counter\r\nand shouting their orders for more beer.  Oaths, curses and obscene\r\nexpressions resounded on every hand, coming almost as frequently from\r\nthe women as the men.  And over all the rattle of money, the ringing of\r\nthe cash register.  The clinking and rattling of the glasses and pewter\r\npots as they were being washed, and the gurgling noise made by the beer\r\nas it poured into the drinking vessels from the taps of the beer\r\nengine, whose handles were almost incessantly manipulated by the\r\nbarman, the Old Dear and the glittering landlady, whose silken blouse,\r\nbejewelled hair, ears, neck and fingers scintillated gloriously in the\r\nblaze of the gaslight.\r\n\r\nThe scene was so novel and strange to Ruth that she felt dazed and\r\nbewildered.  Previous to her marriage she had been a total abstainer,\r\nbut since then she had occasionally taken a glass of beer with Easton\r\nfor company\'s sake with their Sunday dinner at home; but it was\r\ngenerally Easton who went out and bought the beer in a jug.  Once or\r\ntwice she had bought it herself at an Off Licence beer-shop near where\r\nthey lived, but she had never before been in a public house to drink.\r\nShe was so confused and ill at ease that she scarcely heard or\r\nunderstood Mrs Crass, who talked incessantly, principally about their\r\nother residents in North Street where they both resided; and about Mr\r\nCrass.  She also promised Ruth to introduce her presently--if he came\r\nin, as he was almost certain to do--to Mr Partaker, one of her two\r\nlodgers a most superior young man, who had been with them now for over\r\nthree years and would not leave on any account.  In fact, he had been\r\ntheir lodger in their old house, and when they moved he came with them\r\nto North Street, although it was farther away from his place of\r\nbusiness than their former residence.  Mrs Crass talked a lot more of\r\nthe same sort of stuff, to which Ruth listened like one in a dream, and\r\nanswered with an occasional yes or no.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Crass and Easton--the latter had deposited the string-bag on\r\nthe seat at Ruth\'s side--and the Semi-drunk and the Besotted Wretch,\r\narranged to play a match of Hooks and Rings, the losers to pay for\r\ndrinks for all the party, including the two women.  Crass and the\r\nSemi-drunk tossed up for sides.  Crass won and picked the Besotted\r\nWretch, and the game began.  It was a one-sided affair from the first,\r\nfor Easton and the Semi-drunk were no match for the other two.  The end\r\nof it was that Easton and his partner had to pay for the drinks. The\r\nfour men had a pint each of four ale, and Mrs Crass had another\r\nthreepennyworth of gin.  Ruth protested that she did not want any more\r\nto drink, but the others ridiculed this, and both the Besotted Wretch\r\nand the Semi-drunk seemed to regard her unwillingness as a personal\r\ninsult, so she allowed them to get her another half-pint of beer, which\r\nshe was compelled to drink, because she was conscious that the others\r\nwere watching her to see that she did so.\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk now suggested a return match.  He wished to have his\r\nrevenge.  He was a little out of practice, he said, and was only just\r\ngetting his hand in as they were finishing the other game.  Crass and\r\nhis partner readily assented, and in spite of Ruth\'s whispered entreaty\r\nthat they should return home without further delay, Easton insisted on\r\njoining the game.\r\n\r\nAlthough they played more carefully than before, and notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that the Besotted Wretch was very drunk, Easton and his\r\npartner were again beaten and once more had to pay for the drinks. The\r\nmen had a pint each as before.  Mrs Crass--upon whom the liquor so far\r\nseemed to have no effect--had another threepennyworth of gin; and Ruth\r\nconsented to take another glass of beer on condition that Easton would\r\ncome away directly their drinks were finished.  Easton agreed to do so,\r\nbut instead of keeping his word he began to play a four-handed game of\r\nshove-ha\'penny with the other three, the sides and stakes being\r\narranged as before.\r\n\r\nThe liquor was by this time beginning to have some effect upon Ruth:\r\nshe felt dizzy and confused.  Whenever it was necessary to reply to Mrs\r\nCrass\'s talk she found some difficulty in articulating the words and\r\nshe knew she was not answering very intelligently.  Even when Mrs Crass\r\nintroduced her to the interesting Mr Partaker, who arrived about this\r\ntime, she was scarcely able to collect herself sufficiently to decline\r\nthat fascinating gentleman\'s invitation to have another drink with\r\nhimself and Mrs Crass.\r\n\r\nAfter a time a kind of terror took possession of her, and she resolved\r\nthat if Easton would not come when he had finished the game he was\r\nplaying, she would go home without him.\r\n\r\nMeantime the game of shove-ha\'penny proceeded merrily, the majority of\r\nthe male guests crowding round the board, applauding or censuring the\r\nplayers as occasion demanded.  The Semi-drunk was in high glee, for\r\nCrass was not much of a hand at this game, and the Besotted Wretch,\r\nalthough playing well, was not able to make up for his partner\'s want\r\nof skill.  As the game drew near its end and it became more and more\r\ncertain that his opponents would be defeated, the joy of the Semi-drunk\r\nwas unbounded, and he challenged them to make it double or quits--a\r\ngenerous offer which they wisely declined, and shortly afterwards,\r\nseeing that their position was hopeless, they capitulated and prepared\r\nto pay the penalty of the vanquished.\r\n\r\nCrass ordered the drinks and the Besotted Wretch paid half the damage--a\r\npint of four ale for each of the men and the same as before for the\r\nladies.  The Old Dear executed the order, but by mistake, being very\r\nbusy, he served two \'threes\' of gin instead of one.  Ruth did not want\r\nany more at all, but she was afraid to say so, and she did not like to\r\nmake any fuss about it being the wrong drink, especially as they all\r\nassured her that the spirits would do her more good than beer.  She did\r\nnot want either; she wanted to get away, and would have liked to empty\r\nthe stuff out of the glass on the floor, but she was afraid that Mrs\r\nCrass or one of the others might see her doing so, and there might be\r\nsome trouble about it.  Anyway, it seemed easier to drink this small\r\nquantity of spirits and water than a big glass of beer, the very\r\nthought of which now made her feel ill.  She drank the stuff which\r\nEaston handed to her at a single draught and, handing back the empty\r\nglass with a shudder, stood up resolutely.\r\n\r\n\'Are you coming home now?  You promised you would,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'All right: presently,\' replied Easton.  \'There\'s plenty of time; it\'s\r\nnot nine yet.\'\r\n\r\n\'That doesn\'t matter; it\'s quite late enough.  You know we\'ve left the\r\nchild at home alone in the house.  You promised you\'d come as soon as\r\nyou\'d finished that other game.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, all right,\' answered Easton impatiently.  \'Just wait a\r\nminute, I want to see this, and then I\'ll come.\'\r\n\r\n\'This\' was a most interesting problem propounded by Crass, who had\r\narranged eleven matches side by side on the shove-ha\'penny board.  The\r\nproblem was to take none away and yet leave only nine.  Nearly all the\r\nmen in the bar were crowding round the shove-ha\'penny board, some with\r\nknitted brows and drunken gravity trying to solve the puzzle and others\r\nwaiting curiously for the result.  Easton crossed over to see how it\r\nwas done, and as none of the crowd were able to do the trick, Crass\r\nshowed that it could be accomplished by simply arranging the eleven\r\nmatches so as to form the word NINE. Everybody said it was very good\r\nindeed, very clever and interesting.  But the Semi-drunk and the\r\nBesotted Wretch were reminded by this trick of several others equally\r\ngood, and they proceeded to do them; and then the men had another pint\r\neach all round as a reviver after the mental strain of the last few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nEaston did not know any tricks himself, but he was an interested\r\nspectator of those done by several others until Ruth came over and\r\ntouched his arm.\r\n\r\n\'Aren\'t you coming?\'\r\n\r\n\'Wait a minute, can\'t you?\' cried Easton roughly.  \'What\'s your hurry?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want to stay here any longer,\' said Ruth, hysterically.  \'You\r\nsaid you\'d come as soon as you saw that trick.  If you don\'t come, I\r\nshall go home by myself.  I don\'t want to stay in this place any\r\nlonger.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, go by yourself if you want to!\' shouted Easton fiercely, pushing\r\nher away from him.  \'I shall stop \'ere as long as I please, and if you\r\ndon\'t like it you can do the other thing.\'\r\n\r\nRuth staggered and nearly fell from the force of the push he gave her,\r\nand the man turned again to the table to watch the Semi-drunk, who was\r\narranging six matches so as to form the numeral XII, and who said he\r\ncould prove that this was equal to a thousand.\r\n\r\nRuth waited a few minutes longer, and then as Easton took no further\r\nnotice of her, she took up the string-bag and the other parcels, and\r\nwithout staying to say good night to Mrs Crass--who was earnestly\r\nconversing with the interesting Partaker--she with some difficulty\r\nopened the door and went out into the street.  The cold night air felt\r\nrefreshing and sweet after the foul atmosphere of the public house, but\r\nafter a little while she began to feel faint and dizzy, and was\r\nconscious also that she was walking unsteadily, and she fancied that\r\npeople stared at her strangely as they passed.  The parcels felt very\r\nheavy and awkward to carry, and the string-bag seemed as if it were\r\nfilled with lead.\r\n\r\nAlthough under ordinary circumstances it was only about ten minutes\'\r\nwalk home from here, she resolved to go by one of the trams which\r\npassed by the end of North Street.  With this intention, she put down\r\nher bag on the pavement at the stopping-place, and waited, resting her\r\nhand on the iron pillar at the corner of the street, where a little\r\ncrowd of people were standing evidently with the same object as\r\nherself.  Two trains passed without stopping, for they were already\r\nfull of passengers, a common circumstance on Saturday nights.  The next\r\none stopped, and several persons alighted, and then ensued a fierce\r\nstruggle amongst the waiting crowd for the vacant seats.  Men and women\r\npushed, pulled and almost fought, shoving their fists and elbows into\r\neach other\'s sides and breasts and faces.  Ruth was quickly thrust\r\naside and nearly knocked down, and the tram, having taken aboard as\r\nmany passengers as it had accommodation for, passed on.  She waited for\r\nthe next one, and the same scene was enacted with the same result for\r\nher, and then, reflecting that if she had not stayed for these trams\r\nshe might have been home by now, she determined to resume her walk.\r\nThe parcels felt heavier than ever, and she had not proceeded very far\r\nbefore she was compelled to put the bag down again upon the pavement,\r\noutside an empty house.\r\n\r\nLeaning against the railings, she felt very tired and ill.  Everything\r\naround her--the street, the houses, the traffic--seemed vague and\r\nshadowy and unreal.  Several people looked curiously at her as they\r\npassed, but by this time she was scarcely conscious of their scrutiny.\r\n\r\nSlyme had gone that evening to the usual \'open-air\' conducted by the\r\nShining Light Mission.  The weather being fine, they had a most\r\nsuccessful meeting, the disciples, including Hunter, Rushton, Sweater,\r\nDidlum, and Mrs Starvem--Ruth\'s former mistress--assembled in great\r\nforce so as to be able to deal more effectively with any infidels or\r\nhired critics or drunken scoffers who might try to disturb the\r\nproceedings; and--possibly as an evidence of how much real faith there\r\nwas in them--they had also arranged to have a police officer in\r\nattendance, to protect them from what they called the \'Powers of\r\nDarkness\'.  One might be excused for thinking that--if they really\r\nbelieved--they would have relied rather upon those powers of Light\r\nwhich they professed to represent on this planet to protect them\r\nwithout troubling to call in the aid of such a \'worldly\' force as the\r\npolice.  However, it came to pass that on this occasion the only\r\ninfidels present were those who were conducting the meeting, but as\r\nthese consisted for the most part of members of the chapel, it will be\r\nseen that the infidel fraternity was strongly represented.\r\n\r\nOn his way home after the meeting Slyme had to pass by the \'Cricketers\'\r\nand as he drew near the place he wondered if Easton was there, but he\r\ndid not like to go and look in, because he was afraid someone might see\r\nhim coming away and perhaps think he had been in to drink.  Just as he\r\narrived opposite the house another man opened the door of the public\r\nbar and entered, enabling Slyme to catch a momentary glimpse of the\r\ninterior, where he saw Easton and Crass with a number of others who\r\nwere strangers to him, laughing and drinking together.\r\n\r\nSlyme hurried away; it had turned very cold, and he was anxious to get\r\nhome.  As he approached the place where the trams stopped to take up\r\npassengers and saw that there was a tram in sight he resolved to wait\r\nfor it and ride home: but when the tram arrived and there were only one\r\nor two seats vacant, and although he did his best to secure one of\r\nthese he was unsuccessful, and after a moment\'s hesitation he decided\r\nthat it would be quicker to walk than to wait for the next one.  He\r\naccordingly resumed his journey, but he had not gone very far when he\r\nsaw a small crowd of people on the pavement on the other side of the\r\nroad outside an unoccupied house, and although he was in a hurry to get\r\nhome he crossed over to see what was the matter.  There were about\r\ntwenty people standing there, and in the centre close to the railing\r\nthere were three or four women whom Slyme could not see although he\r\ncould hear their voices.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s up?\' he inquired of a man on the edge of the crowd.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, nothing much,\' returned the other.  \'Some young woman; she\'s\r\neither ill, come over faint, or something--or else she\'s had a drop too\r\nmuch.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite a respectable-looking young party, too,\' said another man.\r\n\r\nSeveral young fellows in the crowd were amusing themselves by making\r\nsuggestive jokes about the young woman and causing some laughter by the\r\nexpressions of mock sympathy.\r\n\r\n\'Doesn\'t anyone know who she is?\' said the second man who had spoken in\r\nreply to Slyme\'s inquiry.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said a woman who was standing a little nearer the middle of the\r\ncrowd.  \'And she won\'t say where she lives.\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'ll be all right now she\'s had that glass of soda,\' said another\r\nman, elbowing his way out of the crowd.  As this individual came out,\r\nSlyme managed to work himself a little further into the group of\r\npeople, and he uttered an involuntary cry of astonishment as he caught\r\nsight of Ruth, very pale, and looking very ill, as she stood clasping\r\none of the railings with her left hand and holding the packages of\r\ngroceries in the other.  She had by this time recovered sufficiently to\r\nfeel overwhelmed with shame and confusion before the crowd of strangers\r\nwho hemmed her in on every side, and some of whom she could hear\r\nlaughing and joking about her.  It was therefore with a sensation of\r\nintense relief and gratitude that she saw Slyme\'s familiar face and\r\nheard his friendly voice as he forced his way through to her side.\r\n\r\n\'I can walk home all right now,\' she stammered in reply to his anxious\r\nquestioning.  \'If you wouldn\'t mind carrying some of these things for\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\nHe insisted on taking all the parcels, and the crowd, having jumped to\r\nthe conclusion that he was the young woman\'s husband began to dwindle\r\naway, one of the jokers remarking \'It\'s all over!\' in a loud voice as\r\nhe took himself off.\r\n\r\nIt was only about seven minutes\' walk home from there, and as the\r\nstreets along which they had to pass were not very brilliantly lighted,\r\nRuth was able to lean on Slyme\'s arm most of the way.  When they\r\narrived home, after she had removed her hat, he made her sit down in\r\nthe armchair by the fire, which was burning brightly, and the kettle\r\nwas singing on the hob, for she had banked up the fire with cinders and\r\nsmall coal before she went out.\r\n\r\nThe baby was still asleep in the cradle, but his slumbers had evidently\r\nnot been of the most restful kind, for he had kicked all the bedclothes\r\noff him and was lying all uncovered.  Ruth obeyed passively when Slyme\r\ntold her to sit down, and, lying back languidly in the armchair, she\r\nwatched him through half-closed eyes and with a slight flush on her\r\nface as he deftly covered the sleeping child with the bedclothes and\r\nsettled him more comfortably in the cot.\r\n\r\nSlyme now turned his attention to the fire, and as he placed the kettle\r\nupon it he remarked: \'As soon as the water boils I\'ll make you some\r\nstrong tea.\'\r\n\r\nDuring their walk home she had acquainted Slyme with the cause of her\r\nbeing in the condition in which he found her in the street, and as she\r\nreclined in the armchair, drowsily watching him, she wondered what\r\nwould have happened to her if he had not passed by when he did.\r\n\r\n\'Are you feeling better?\' he asked, looking down at her.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, thanks. I feel quite well now; but I\'m afraid I\'ve given you a\r\nlot of trouble.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, you haven\'t.  Nothing I can do for you is a trouble to me.  But\r\ndon\'t you think you\'d better take your jacket off?  Here, let me help\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\nIt took a very long time to get this jacket off, because whilst he was\r\nhelping her, Slyme kissed her repeatedly and passionately as she lay\r\nlimp and unresisting in his arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 25\r\n\r\nThe Oblong\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the following week the work at \'The Cave\' progressed rapidly\r\ntowards completion, although, the hours of daylight being so few, the\r\nmen worked only from 8 A.M. till 4 P.M. and they had their breakfasts\r\nbefore they came.  This made 40 hours a week, so that those who were\r\npaid sevenpence an hour earned L1.3.4.  Those who got\r\nsixpence-halfpenny drew L1.1.8.  Those whose wages were fivepence an\r\nhour were paid the princely sum of 16/8d. for their week\'s hard labour,\r\nand those whose rate was fourpence-halfpenny \'picked up\' 15/-.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there are people who have the insolence to say that Drink is\r\nthe cause of poverty.\r\n\r\nAnd many of the persons who say this, spend more money than that on\r\ndrink themselves--every day of their useless lives.\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday night all the inside was finished with the exception of the\r\nkitchen and scullery.  The painting of the kitchen had been delayed\r\nowing to the non-arrival of the new cooking range, and the scullery was\r\nstill used as the paint shop.  The outside work was also nearly\r\nfinished: all the first coating was done and the second coating was\r\nbeing proceeded with.  According to the specification, all the outside\r\nwoodwork was supposed to have three coats, and the guttering,\r\nrain-pipes and other ironwork two coats, but Crass and Hunter had\r\narranged to make two coats do for most of the windows and woodwork, and\r\nall the ironwork was to be made to do with one coat only.  The windows\r\nwere painted in two colours: the sashes dark green and the frames\r\nwhite.  All the rest--gables, doors, railings, guttering, etc.--was\r\ndark green; and all the dark green paint was made with boiled linseed\r\noil and varnish; no turpentine being allowed to be used on this part of\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\n\'This is some bloody fine stuff to \'ave to use, ain\'t it?\' remarked\r\nHarlow to Philpot on Wednesday morning.  \'It\'s more like a lot of\r\ntreacle than anything else.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: and it won\'t arf blister next summer when it gets a bit of sun on\r\nit,\' replied Philpot with a grin.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose they\'re afraid that if they was to put a little turps in, it\r\nwouldn\'t bear out, and they\'d \'ave to give it another coat.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can bet yer life that\'s the reason,\' said Philpot.  \'But all the\r\nsame I mean to pinch a drop to put in mine as soon as Crass is gorn.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gorn where?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, didn\'t you know? there\'s another funeral on today?  Didn\'t you\r\nsee that corfin plate what Owen was writing in the drorin\'-room last\r\nSaturday morning?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I wasn\'t \'ere.  Don\'t you remember I was sent away to do a ceilin\'\r\nand a bit of painting over at Windley?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, of course; I forgot,\' exclaimed Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'I reckon Crass and Slyme must be making a small fortune out of all\r\nthese funerals,\' said Harlow.  \'This makes the fourth in the last\r\nfortnight.  What is it they gets for \'em?\'\r\n\r\n\'A shillin\' for taking\' \'ome the corfin and liftin\' in the corpse, and\r\nfour bob for the funeral--five bob altogether.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a bit of all right, ain\'t it?\' said Harlow.  \'A couple of them\r\nin a week besides your week\'s wages, eh?  Five bob for two or three\r\nhours work!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, the money\'s all right, mate, but they\'re welcome to it for my\r\npart. I don\'t want to go messin\' about with no corpses,\' replied\r\nPhilpot with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\'Who is this last party what\'s dead?\' asked Harlow after a pause.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a parson what used to belong to the "Shining Light" Chapel. He\'d\r\nbeen abroad for \'is \'ollerdays--to Monte Carlo.  It seems \'e was ill\r\nbefore \'e went away, but the change did \'im a lot of good; in fact, \'e\r\nwas quite recovered, and \'e was coming back again.  But while \'e was\r\nstandin\' on the platform at Monte Carlo Station waitin\' for the train,\r\na porter runned into \'im with a barrer load o\' luggage, and \'e blowed\r\nup.\'\r\n\r\n\'Blowed up?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' repeated Philpot.  \'Blowed up!  Busted!  Exploded!  All into\r\npieces.  But they swep\' \'em all up and put it in a corfin and it\'s to\r\nbe planted this afternoon.\'\r\n\r\nHarlow maintained an awestruck silence, and Philpot continued:\r\n\r\n\'I had a drink the other night with a butcher bloke what used to serve\r\nthis parson with meat, and we was talkin\' about what a strange sort of\r\ndeath it was, but \'e said \'e wasn\'t at all surprised to \'ear of it; the\r\nonly thing as \'e wondered at was that the man didn\'t blow up long ago,\r\nconsiderin\' the amount of grub as \'e used to make away with.  He ses\r\nthe quantities of stuff as \'e\'s took there and seen other tradesmen\r\ntake was something chronic.  Tons of it!\'\r\n\r\n\'What was the parson\'s name?\' asked Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Belcher.  You must \'ave noticed \'im about the town.  A very fat chap,\'\r\nreplied Philpot.  \'I\'m sorry you wasn\'t \'ere on Saturday to see the\r\ncorfin plate.  Frank called me in to see the wordin\' when \'e\'d finished\r\nit.  It had on: "Jonydab Belcher.  Born January 1st, 1849. Ascended,\r\nDecember 8th, 19--"\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I know the bloke now!\' cried Harlow.  \'I remember my youngsters\r\nbringin\' \'ome a subscription list what they\'d got up at the Sunday\r\nSchool to send \'im away for a \'ollerday because \'e was ill, and I gave\r\n\'em a penny each to put on their cards because I didn\'t want \'em to\r\nfeel mean before the other young \'uns.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it\'s the same party.  Two or three young \'uns asked me to give\r\n\'em something to put on at the time.  And I see they\'ve got another\r\nsubscription list on now.  I met one of Newman\'s children yesterday and\r\nshe showed it to me.  It\'s for an entertainment and a Christmas Tree\r\nfor all the children what goes to the Sunday School, so I didn\'t mind\r\ngiving just a trifle for anything like that.\'...\r\n\r\n\'Seems to be gettin\' colder, don\'t it?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s enough to freeze the ears orf a brass monkey!\' remarked Easton as\r\nhe descended from a ladder close by and, placing his pot of paint on\r\nthe pound, began to try to warm his hands by rubbing and beating them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHe was trembling, and his teeth were chattering with cold.\r\n\r\n\'I could just do with a nice pint of beer, now,\' he said as he stamped\r\nhis feet on the pound.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just what I was thinkin\',\' said Philpot, wistfully, \'and what\'s\r\nmore, I mean to \'ave one, too, at dinner-time.  I shall nip down to the\r\n"Cricketers".  Even if I don\'t get back till a few minutes after one,\r\nit won\'t matter, because Crass and Nimrod will be gorn to the funeral.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you bring me a pint back with you, in a bottle?\' asked Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, certainly,\' said Philpot.\r\n\r\nHarlow said nothing.  He also would have liked a pint of beer, but, as\r\nwas usual with him, he had not the necessary cash.  Having restored the\r\ncirculation to a certain extent, they now resumed their work, and only\r\njust in time, for a few minutes afterwards they observed Misery peeping\r\nround the corner of the house at them and they wondered how long he had\r\nbeen there, and whether he had overheard their conversation.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock Crass and Slyme cleared off in a great hurry, and a\r\nlittle while afterwards, Philpot took off his apron and put on his coat\r\nto go to the \'Cricketers\'.  When the others found out where he was\r\ngoing, several of them asked him to bring back a drink for them, and\r\nthen someone suggested that all those who wanted some beer should give\r\ntwopence each.  This was done: one shilling and fourpence was collected\r\nand given to Philpot, who was to bring back a gallon of beer in a jar.\r\nHe promised to get back as soon as ever he could, and some of the\r\nshareholders decided not to drink any tea with their dinners, but to\r\nwait for the beer, although they knew that it would be nearly time to\r\nresume work before he could get back.  It would be a quarter to one at\r\nthe very earliest.\r\n\r\nThe minutes dragged slowly by, and after a while the only man on the\r\njob who had a watch began to lose his temper and refused to answer any\r\nmore inquiries concerning the time.  So presently Bert was sent up to\r\nthe top of the house to look at a church clock which was visible\r\ntherefrom, and when he came down he reported that it was ten minutes to\r\none.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of anxiety now began to manifest themselves amongst the\r\nshareholders, several of whom went down to the main road to see if\r\nPhilpot was yet in sight, but each returned with the same report--they\r\ncould see nothing of him.\r\n\r\nNo one was formally \'in charge\' of the job during Crass\'s absence, but\r\nthey all returned to their work promptly at one because they feared\r\nthat Sawkins or some other sneak might report any irregularity to Crass\r\nor Misery.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter-past one, Philpot was still missing and the uneasiness of\r\nthe shareholders began to develop into a panic.  Some of them plainly\r\nexpressed the opinion that he had gone on the razzle with the money. As\r\nthe time wore on, this became the general opinion.  At two o\'clock, all\r\nhope of his return having been abandoned, two or three of the\r\nshareholders went and drank some of the cold tea.\r\n\r\nTheir fears were only too well founded, for they saw no more of Philpot\r\ntill the next morning, when he arrived looking very sheepish and\r\nrepentant and promised to refund all the money on Saturday.  He also\r\nmade a long, rambling statement from which it appeared that on his way\r\nto the \'Cricketers\' he met a couple of chaps whom he knew who were out\r\nof work, and he invited them to come and have a drink.  When they got\r\nto the pub, they found there the Semi-drunk and the Besotted Wretch.\r\nOne drink led to another, and then they started arguing, and he had\r\nforgotten all about the gallon of beer until he woke up this morning.\r\n\r\nWhilst Philpot was making this explanation they were putting on their\r\naprons and blouses, and Crass was serving out the lots of colour. Slyme\r\ntook no part in the conversation, but got ready as quickly as possible\r\nand went outside to make a start.  The reason for this haste soon\r\nbecame apparent to some of the others, for they noticed that he had\r\nselected and commenced painting a large window that was so situated as\r\nto be sheltered from the keen wind that was blowing.\r\n\r\nThe basement of the house was slightly below the level of the ground\r\nand there was a sort of a trench or area about three feet deep in front\r\nof the basement windows.  The banks of this trench were covered with\r\nrose trees and evergreens, and the bottom was a mass of slimy,\r\nevil-smelling, rain-sodden earth, foul with the excrement of nocturnal\r\nanimals.  To second-coat these basement windows, Philpot and Harlow had\r\nto get down into and stand in all this filth, which soaked through the\r\nworn and broken soles of their boots.  As they worked, the thorns of\r\nthe rose trees caught and tore their clothing and lacerated the flesh\r\nof their half-frozen hands.\r\n\r\nOwen and Easton were working on ladders doing the windows immediately\r\nabove Philpot and Harlow, Sawkins, on another ladder, was painting one\r\nof the gables, and the other men were working at different parts of the\r\noutside of the house.  The boy Bert was painting the iron railings of\r\nthe front fence.  The weather was bitterly cold, the sun was concealed\r\nby the dreary expanse of grey cloud that covered the wintry sky.\r\n\r\nAs they stood there working most of the time they were almost perfectly\r\nmotionless, the only part of their bodies that were exercised being\r\ntheir right arms.  The work they were now doing required to be done\r\nvery carefully and deliberately, otherwise the glass would be \'messed\r\nup\' or the white paint of the frames would \'run into\' the dark green of\r\nthe sashes, both colours being wet at the same time, each man having\r\ntwo pots of paint and two sets of brushes.  The wind was not blowing in\r\nsudden gusts, but swept by in a strong, persistent current that\r\npenetrated their clothing and left them trembling and numb with cold.\r\nIt blew from the right; and it was all the worse on that account,\r\nbecause the right arm, being in use, left that side of the body fully\r\nexposed.  They were able to keep their left hands in their trousers\r\npockets and the left arm close to the side most of the time.  This made\r\na lot of difference.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why it is worse when the wind strikes upon one from the\r\nright side is that the buttons on a man\'s coat are always on the right\r\nside, and consequently the wind gets underneath.  Philpot realized this\r\nall the more because some of the buttons on his coat and waistcoat were\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nAs they worked on, trembling with cold, and with their teeth\r\nchattering, their faces and hands became of that pale violet colour\r\ngenerally seen on the lips of a corpse.  Their eyes became full of\r\nwater and the lids were red and inflamed.  Philpot\'s and Harlow\'s boots\r\nwere soon wet through, with the water they absorbed from the damp\r\nground, and their feet were sore and intensely painful with cold.\r\n\r\nTheir hands, of course, suffered the most, becoming so numbed that they\r\nwere unable to feel the brushes they held; in fact, presently, as\r\nPhilpot was taking a dip of colour, the brush fell from his hand into\r\nthe pot; and then, finding that he was unable to move his fingers, he\r\nput his hand into his trousers pocket to thaw, and began to walk about,\r\nstamping his feet upon the ground.  His example was quickly followed by\r\nOwen, Easton and Harlow, and they all went round the corner to the\r\nsheltered side of the house where Slyme was working, and began walking\r\nup and down, rubbing their hands, stamping their feet and swinging\r\ntheir arms to warm themselves.\r\n\r\n\'If I thought Nimrod wasn\'t comin\', I\'d put my overcoat on and work in\r\nit,\' remarked Philpot, \'but you never knows when to expect the b--r,\r\nand if \'e saw me in it, it would mean the bloody push.\'\r\n\r\n\'It wouldn\'t interfere with our workin\' if we did wear \'em,\' said\r\nEaston; \'in fact, we\'d be able to work all the quicker if we wasn\'t so\r\ncold.\'\r\n\r\n\'Even if Misery didn\'t come, I suppose Crass would \'ave something to\r\nsay if we did put \'em on,\' continued Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Well, yer couldn\'t blame \'im if \'e did say something, could yer?\' said\r\nSlyme, offensively.  \'Crass would get into a row \'imself if \'Unter came\r\nand saw us workin\' in overcoats.  It would look ridiclus.\'\r\n\r\nSlyme suffered less from the cold than any of them, not only because he\r\nhad secured the most sheltered window, but also because he was better\r\nclothed than most of the rest.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s Crass supposed to be doin\' inside?\' asked Easton as he tramped\r\nup and down, with his shoulders hunched up and his hands thrust deep\r\ninto the pockets of his trousers.\r\n\r\n\'Blowed if I know,\' replied Philpot.  \'Messin\' about touchin\' up or\r\nmakin\' colour.  He never does \'is share of a job like this; \'e knows\r\n\'ow to work things all right for \'isself.\'\r\n\r\n\'What if \'e does?  We\'d be the same if we was in \'is place, and so\r\nwould anybody else,\' said Slyme, and added sarcastically: \'Or p\'haps\r\nyou\'d give all the soft jobs to other people and do all the rough\r\nyerself!\'\r\n\r\nSlyme knew that, although they were speaking of Crass, they were also\r\nalluding to himself, and as he replied to Philpot he looked slyly at\r\nOwen, who had so far taken no part in the conversation.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not a question of what we would do,\' chimed in Harlow.  \'It\'s a\r\nquestion of what\'s fair.  If it\'s not fair for Crass to pick all the\r\nsoft jobs for \'imself and leave all the rough for others, the fact that\r\nwe might do the same if we \'ad the chance don\'t make it right.\'\r\n\r\n\'No one can be blamed for doing the best he can for himself under\r\nexisting circumstances,\' said Owen in reply to Slyme\'s questioning\r\nlook.  That is the principle of the present system--every man for\r\nhimself and the devil take the rest.  For my own part I don\'t pretend\r\nto practise unselfishness.  I don\'t pretend to guide my actions by the\r\nrules laid down in the Sermon on the Mount.  But it\'s certainly\r\nsurprising to hear you who profess to be a follower of\r\nChrist--advocating selfishness.  Or, rather, it would be surprising if\r\nit were not that the name of "Christian" has ceased to signify one who\r\nfollows Christ, and has come to mean only liar and hypocrite.\'\r\n\r\nSlyme made no answer.  Possibly the fact that he was a true believer\r\nenabled him to bear this insult with meekness and humility.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what time it is?\' interposed Philpot.\r\n\r\nSlyme looked at his watch.  It was nearly ten o\'clock.\r\n\r\n\'Jesus Christ!  Is that all?\' growled Easton as they returned to work.\r\n\'Two hours more before dinner!\'\r\n\r\nOnly two more hours, but to these miserable, half-starved, ill-clad\r\nwretches, standing here in the bitter wind that pierced their clothing\r\nand seemed to be tearing at their very hearts and lungs with icy\r\nfingers, it appeared like an eternity.  To judge by the eagerness with\r\nwhich they longed for dinner-time, one might have thought they had some\r\nglorious banquet to look forward to instead of bread and cheese and\r\nonions, or bloaters--and stewed tea.\r\n\r\nTwo more hours of torture before dinner; and three more hours after\r\nthat.  And then, thank God, it would be too dark to see to work any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nIt would have been much better for them if, instead of being \'Freemen\',\r\nthey had been slaves, and the property, instead of the hirelings, of Mr\r\nRushton.  As it was, HE would not have cared if one or all of them had\r\nbecome ill or died from the effects of exposure. It would have made no\r\ndifference to him.  There were plenty of others out of work and on the\r\nverge of starvation who would be very glad to take their places.  But\r\nif they had been Rushton\'s property, such work as this would have been\r\ndeferred until it could be done without danger to the health and lives\r\nof the slaves; or at any rate, even if it were proceeded with during\r\nsuch weather, their owner would have seen to it that they were properly\r\nclothed and fed; he would have taken as much care of them as he would\r\nof his horse.\r\n\r\nPeople always take great care of their horses.  If they were to\r\noverwork a horse and make it ill, it would cost something for medicine\r\nand the veterinary surgeon, to say nothing of the animal\'s board and\r\nlodging.  If they were to work their horses to death, they would have\r\nto buy others.  But none of these considerations applies to workmen. If\r\nthey work a man to death they can get another for nothing at the corner\r\nof the next street.  They don\'t have to buy him; all they have to do is\r\nto give him enough money to provide him with food and clothing--of a\r\nkind--while he is working for them.  If they only make him ill, they\r\nwill not have to feed him or provide him with medical care while he is\r\nlaid up.  He will either go without these things or pay for them\r\nhimself.  At the same time it must be admitted that the workman scores\r\nover both the horse and the slave, inasmuch as he enjoys the priceless\r\nblessing of Freedom.  If he does not like the hirer\'s conditions he\r\nneed not accept them.  He can refuse to work, and he can go and starve.\r\nThere are no ropes on him.  He is a Free man.  He is the Heir of all\r\nthe Ages.  He enjoys perfect Liberty.  He has the right to choose\r\nfreely which he will do--Submit or Starve. Eat dirt or eat nothing.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew colder and colder.  The sky, which at first had shown\r\nsmall patches of blue through rifts in the masses of clouds, had now\r\nbecome uniformly grey.  There was every indication of an impending fall\r\nof snow.\r\n\r\nThe men perceived this with conflicting feelings.  If it did commence\r\nto snow, they would not be able to continue this work, and therefore\r\nthey found themselves involuntarily wishing that it would snow, or\r\nrain, or hail, or anything that would stop the work.  But on the other\r\nhand, if the weather prevented them getting on with the outside, some\r\nof them would have to \'stand off\', because the inside was practically\r\nfinished.  None of them wished to lose any time if they could possibly\r\nhelp it, because there were only ten days more before Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe morning slowly wore away and the snow did not fall.  The hands\r\nworked on in silence, for they were in no mood for talking, and not\r\nonly that, but they were afraid that Hunter or Rushton or Crass might\r\nbe watching them from behind some bush or tree, or through some of the\r\nwindows.  This dread possessed them to such an extent that most of them\r\nwere almost afraid even to look round, and kept steadily on at work.\r\nNone of them wished to spoil his chance of being kept on to help to do\r\nthe other house that it was reported Rushton & Co. were going to \'do\r\nup\' for Mr Sweater.\r\n\r\nTwelve o\'clock came at last, and Crass\'s whistle had scarcely ceased to\r\nsound before they all assembled in the kitchen before the roaring fire.\r\nSweater had sent in two tons of coal and had given orders that fires\r\nwere to be lit every day in nearly every room to make the house\r\nhabitable by Christmas.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder if it\'s true as the firm\'s got another job to do for old\r\nSweater?\' remarked Harlow as he was toasting a bloater on the end of\r\nthe pointed stick.\r\n\r\n\'True? No!\' said the man on the pail scornfully.  \'It\'s all bogy.  You\r\nknow that empty \'ouse as they said Sweater \'ad bought--the one that\r\nRushton and Nimrod was seen lookin\' at?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Harlow.  The other men listened with evident interest.\r\n\'Well, they wasn\'t pricing it up after all! The landlord of that \'ouse\r\nis abroad, and there was some plants in the garden as Rushton thought\r\n\'e\'d like, and \'e was tellin\' Misery which ones \'e wanted. And\r\nafterwards old Pontius Pilate came up with Ned Dawson and a truck. They\r\nmade two or three journeys and took bloody near everything in the\r\ngarden as was worth takin\'.  What didn\'t go to Rushton\'s place went to\r\n\'Unter\'s.\'\r\n\r\nThe disappointment of their hopes for another job was almost forgotten\r\nin their interest in this story.\r\n\r\n\'Who told you about it?\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Ned Dawson \'imself.  It\'s right enough what I say. Ask \'im.\'\r\n\r\nNed Dawson, usually called \'Bundy\'s mate\', had been away from the house\r\nfor a few days down at the yard doing odd jobs, and had only come back\r\nto the \'Cave\' that morning.  On being appealed to, he corroborated Dick\r\nWantley\'s statement.\r\n\r\n\'They\'ll be gettin\' theirselves into trouble if they ain\'t careful,\'\r\nremarked Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no they won\'t, Rushton\'s too artful for that.  It seems the agent\r\nis a pal of \'is, and they worked it between \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot a bloody cheek, though!\' exclaimed Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that\'s nothing to some of the things I\'ve known \'em do before\r\nnow,\' said the man on the pail.  \'Why, don\'t you remember, back in the\r\nsummer, that carved hoak hall table as Rushton pinched out of that\r\n\'ouse on Grand Parade?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; that was a bit of all right too, wasn\'t it?\' cried Philpot, and\r\nseveral of the others laughed.\r\n\r\n\'You know, that big \'ouse we did up last summer--No. 596,\' Wantley\r\ncontinued, for the benefit of those not \'in the know\'.  \'Well, it \'ad\r\nbin empty for a long time and we found this \'ere table in a cupboard\r\nunder the stairs.  A bloody fine table it was too.  One of them bracket\r\ntables what you fix to the wall, without no legs.  It \'ad a \'arf-round\r\nmarble top to it, and underneath was a carved hoak figger, a mermaid,\r\nwith \'er arms up over \'er \'ead \'oldin\' up the table top--something\r\nsplendid!\'  The man on the pail waxed enthusiastic as he thought of it.\r\n\'Must \'ave been worth at least five quid.  Well, just as we pulled this\r\n\'ere table out, who should come in but Rushton, and when \'e seen it, \'e\r\ntells Crass to cover it over with a sack and not to let nobody see it.\r\nAnd then \'e clears orf to the shop and sends the boy down with the\r\ntruck and \'as it took up to \'is own \'ouse, and it\'s there now, fixed in\r\nthe front \'all.  I was sent up there a couple of months ago to paint\r\nand varnish the lobby doors and I seen it meself.  There\'s a pitcher\r\ncalled "The Day of Judgement" \'angin\' on the wall just over it--thunder\r\nand lightning and earthquakes and corpses gettin\' up out o\' their\r\ngraves--something bloody \'orrible! And underneath the picture is a card\r\nwith a tex out of the Bible--"Christ is the \'ead of this \'ouse: the\r\nunknown guest at every meal. The silent listener to every\r\nconversation."  I was workin\' there for three or four days and I got to\r\nknow it orf by \'eart.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that takes the biskit, don\'t it?\' said Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Yes: but the best of it was,\' the man on the pail proceeded, \'the best\r\nof it was, when ole Misery \'eard about the table, \'e was so bloody wild\r\nbecause \'e didn\'t get it \'imself that \'e went upstairs and pinched one\r\nof the venetian blinds and \'ad it took up to \'is own \'ouse by the boy,\r\nand a few days arterwards one of the carpenters \'ad to go and fix it up\r\nin \'is bedroom.\'\r\n\r\n\'And wasn\'t it never found out?\' inquired Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Well, there was a bit of talk about it.  The agent wanted to know\r\nwhere it was, but Pontius Pilate swore black and white as there \'adn\'t\r\nbeen no blind in that room, and the end of it was that the firm got the\r\norder to supply a new one.\'\r\n\r\n\'What I can\'t understand is, who did the table belong to?\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'It was a fixture belongin\' to the \'ouse,\' replied Wantley.  \'But I\r\nsuppose the former tenants had some piece of furniture of their own\r\nthat they wanted to put in the \'all where this table was fixed, so they\r\ntook it down and stored it away in this \'ere cupboard, and when they\r\nleft the \'ouse I suppose they didn\'t trouble to put it back again.\r\nAnyway, there was the mark on the wall where it used to be fixed, but\r\nwhen we did the staircase down, the place was papered over, and I\r\nsuppose the landlord or the agent never give the table a thought.\r\nAnyhow, Rushton got away with it all right.\'\r\n\r\nA number of similar stories were related by several others concerning\r\nthe doings of different employers they had worked for, but after a time\r\nthe conversation reverted to the subject that was uppermost in their\r\nthoughts--the impending slaughter, and the improbability of being able\r\nto obtain another job, considering the large number of men who were\r\nalready out of employment.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t make it out, myself,\' remarked Easton.  \'Things seems to get\r\nworse every year.  There don\'t seem to be \'arf the work about that\r\nthere used to be, and even what there is is messed up anyhow, as if the\r\npeople who \'as it done can\'t afford to pay for it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Harlow; \'that\'s true enough.  Why, just look at the work\r\nthat\'s in one o\' them \'ouses on the Grand Parade.  People must \'ave \'ad\r\nmore money to spend in those days, you know; all those massive curtain\r\ncornishes over the drawing- and dining-room winders--gilded solid!\r\nWhy, nowadays they\'d want all the bloody \'ouse done down right\r\nthrough--inside and out, for the money it cost to gild one of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'It seems that nearly everybody is more or less \'ard up nowadays,\' said\r\nPhilpot.  \'I\'m jiggered if I can understand it, but there it is.\'\r\n\r\n\'You should ast Owen to explain it to yer,\' remarked Crass with a\r\njeering laugh.  \'\'E knows all about wot\'s the cause of poverty, but \'e\r\nwon\'t tell nobody.  \'E\'s been GOIN\' to tell us wot it is for a long\r\ntime past, but it don\'t seem to come orf.\'\r\n\r\nCrass had not yet had an opportunity of producing the Obscurer cutting,\r\nand he made this remark in the hope of turning the conversation into a\r\nchannel that would enable him to do so.  But Owen did not respond, and\r\nwent on reading his newspaper.\r\n\r\n\'We ain\'t \'ad no lectures at all lately, \'ave we?\' said Harlow in an\r\ninjured tone.  \'I think it\'s about time Owen explained what the real\r\ncause of poverty is.  I\'m beginning to get anxious about it.\'\r\n\r\nThe others laughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Philpot had finished eating his dinner he went out of the kitchen\r\nand presently returned with a small pair of steps, which he opened and\r\nplaced in a corner of the room, with the back of the steps facing the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n\'There you are, me son!\' he exclaimed to Owen.  \'There\'s a pulpit for\r\nyer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes! come on \'ere!\' cried Crass, feeling in his waistcoat pocket for\r\nthe cutting.  \'Tell us wot\'s the real cause of poverty.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' shouted the man on the pail.  \'Git up into the bloody\r\npulpit and give us a sermon.\'\r\n\r\nAs Owen made no response to the invitations, the crowd began to hoot\r\nand groan.\r\n\r\n\'Come on, man,\' whispered Philpot, winking his goggle eye persuasively\r\nat Owen.  \'Come on, just for a bit of turn, to pass the time away.\'\r\n\r\nOwen accordingly ascended the steps--much to the secret delight of\r\nCrass--and was immediately greeted with a round of enthusiastic\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n\'There you are, you see,\' said Philpot, addressing the meeting.  \'It\'s\r\nno use booin\' and threatenin\', because \'e\'s one of them lecturers wot\r\ncan honly be managed with kindness.  If it \'adn\'t a bin for me, \'e\r\nwouldn\'t \'ave agreed to speak at all.\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot having been unanimously elected chairman, proposed by Harlow\r\nand seconded by the man on the pail, Owen commenced:\r\n\r\n\'Mr Chairman and gentlemen:\r\n\r\n\'Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, it is with some degree of\r\nhesitation that I venture to address myself to such a large,\r\ndistinguished, fashionable, and intelligent looking audience as that\r\nwhich I have the honour of seeing before me on the present occasion.\'\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\n\'One of the finest speakers I\'ve ever \'eard!\' remarked the man on the\r\npail in a loud whisper to the chairman, who motioned him to be silent.\r\n\r\nOwen continued:\r\n\r\n\'In some of my previous lectures I have endeavoured to convince you\r\nthat money is in itself of no value and of no real use whatever.  In\r\nthis I am afraid I have been rather unsuccessful.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a bit of it, mate,\' cried Crass, sarcastically.  \'We all agrees\r\nwith it.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' shouted Easton.  \'If a bloke was to come in \'ere now and\r\norfer to give me a quid--I\'d refuse it!\'\r\n\r\n\'So would I,\' said Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Well, whether you agree or not, the fact remains.  A man might possess\r\nso much money that, in England, he would be comparatively rich, and yet\r\nif he went to some country where the cost of living is very high he\r\nwould find himself in a condition of poverty.  Or one might conceivably\r\nbe in a place where the necessaries of life could not be bought for\r\nmoney at all.  Therefore it is more conducive to an intelligent\r\nunderstanding of the subject if we say that to be rich consists not\r\nnecessarily in having much money, but in being able to enjoy an\r\nabundance of the things that are made by work; and that poverty\r\nconsists not merely in being without money, but in being short of the\r\nnecessaries and comforts of life--or in other words in being short of\r\nthe Benefits of Civilization, the things that are all, without\r\nexception, produced by work.  Whether you agree or not with anything\r\nelse that I say, you will all admit that that is our condition at the\r\npresent time.  We do not enjoy a full share of the benefits of\r\ncivilization--we are all in a state of more or less abject poverty.\'\r\n\r\n\'Question!\' cried Crass, and there were loud murmurs of indignant\r\ndissent from several quarters as Owen proceeded:\r\n\r\n\'How does it happen that we are so short of the things that are made by\r\nwork?\'\r\n\r\n\'The reason why we\'re short of the things that\'s made by work,\'\r\ninterrupted Crass, mimicking Owen\'s manner, \'is that we ain\'t got the\r\nbloody money to buy \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said the man on the pail; \'and as I said before, if all the\r\nmoney in the country was shared out equal today according to Owen\'s\r\nideas--in six months\' time it would be all back again in the same \'ands\r\nas it is now, and what are you goin\' to do then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Share again, of course.\'\r\n\r\nThis answer came derisively from several places at the same instant,\r\nand then they all began speaking at once, vying with each other in\r\nridiculing the foolishness of \'them there Socialists\', whom they called\r\n\'The Sharers Out\'.\r\n\r\nBarrington was almost the only one who took no part in the\r\nconversation.  He was seated in his customary place and, as usual,\r\nsilently smoking, apparently oblivious to his surroundings.\r\n\r\n\'I never said anything about "sharing out all the money",\' said Owen\r\nduring a lull in the storm, \'and I don\'t know of any Socialist who\r\nadvocates anything of the kind.  Can any of you tell me the name of\r\nsomeone who proposes to do so?\'\r\n\r\nNo one answered, as Owen repeated his inquiry, this time addressing\r\nhimself directly to Crass, who had been one of the loudest in\r\ndenouncing and ridiculing the \'Sharers Out\'.  Thus cornered, Crass--who\r\nknew absolutely nothing about the subject--for a few moments looked\r\nrather foolish.  Then he began to talk in a very loud voice:\r\n\r\n\'Why, it\'s a well-known fact.  Everybody knows that\'s what they wants.\r\nBut they take bloody good care they don\'t act up to it theirselves,\r\nthough.  Look at them there Labour members of Parliament--a lot of\r\nb--rs what\'s too bloody lazy to work for their livin\'!  What the bloody\r\n\'ell was they before they got there?  Only workin\' men, the same as you\r\nand me!  But they\'ve got the gift o\' the gab and--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, we know all about that,\' said Owen, \'but what I\'m asking you is\r\nto tell us who advocates taking all the money in the country and\r\nsharing it out equally?\'\r\n\r\n\'And I say that everybody knows that\'s what they\'re after!\' shouted\r\nCrass.  \'And you know it as well as I do.  A fine thing!\' he added\r\nindignantly.  \'Accordin\' to that idear, a bloody scavenger or a farm\r\nlabourer ought to get as much wages as you or me!\'\r\n\r\n\'We can talk about that some other time.  What I want to know at\r\npresent is--what authority have you for saying that Socialists believe\r\nin sharing out all the money equally amongst all the people?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s what I\'ve always understood they believed in doing,\' said\r\nCrass rather lamely.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a well-known fact,\' said several others.\r\n\r\n\'Come to think of it,\' continued Crass as he drew the Obscurer cutting\r\nfrom his waistcoat pocket, \'I\'ve got a little thing \'ere that I\'ve been\r\ngoin\' to read to yer.  It\'s out of the Obscurer.  I\'d forgotten all\r\nabout it.\'\r\n\r\nRemarking that the print was too small for his own eyes, he passed the\r\nslip of paper to Harlow, who read aloud as follows:\r\n\r\n    PROVE YOUR PRINCIPLES: OR, LOOK AT BOTH SIDES\r\n\r\n    \'I wish I could open your eyes to the true misery of our\r\n    condition: injustice, tyranny and oppression!\' said a discontented\r\n    hack to a weary-looking cob as they stood side by side in unhired\r\n    cabs.\r\n\r\n    \'I\'d rather have them opened to something pleasant, thank you,\'\r\n    replied the cob.\r\n\r\n    \'I am sorry for you.  If you could enter into the noble\r\n    aspirations--\' the hack began.\r\n\r\n    \'Talk plain.  What would you have?\' said the cob, interrupting\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    \'What would I have?  Why, equality, and share and share alike all\r\n    over the world,\' said the hack.\r\n\r\n    \'You MEAN that?\' said the cob.\r\n\r\n    \'Of course I do. What right have those sleek, pampered hunters and\r\n    racers to their warm stables and high feed, their grooms and\r\n    jockeys?  It is really heart-sickening to think of it,\' replied\r\n    the hack.\r\n\r\n    \'I don\'t know but you may be right,\' said the cob, \'and to show\r\n    I\'m in earnest, as no doubt you are, let me have half the good\r\n    beans you have in your bag, and you shall have half the musty oats\r\n    and chaff I have in mine.  There\'s nothing like proving one\'s\r\n    principles.\'\r\n                                   Original Parables.  By Mrs Prosier.\r\n\r\n\'There you are!\' cried several voices.\r\n\r\n\'What does that mean?\' cried Crass, triumphantly.  \'Why don\'t you go\r\nand share your wages with the chaps what\'s out of work?\'\r\n\r\n\'What does it mean?\' replied Owen contemptuously.  \'It means that if\r\nthe Editor of the Obscurer put that in his paper as an argument against\r\nSocialism, either he is of feeble intellect himself or else he thinks\r\nthat the majority of his readers are.  That isn\'t an argument against\r\nSocialism--it\'s an argument against the hypocrites who pretend to be\r\nChristians--the people who profess to "Love their neighbours as\r\nthemselves"--who pretend to believe in Universal Brotherhood, and that\r\nthey do not love the world or the things of the world and say that they\r\nare merely "Pilgrims on their way to a better land".  As for why I\r\ndon\'t do it--why should I?  I don\'t pretend to be a Christian.  But\r\nyou\'re all "Christians"--why don\'t you do it?\'\r\n\r\n\'We\'re not talkin\' about religion,\' exclaimed Crass, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\'Then what are you talking about?  I never said anything about "Sharing\r\nOut" or "Bearing one another\'s burdens".  I don\'t profess to "Give to\r\neveryone who asks of me" or to "Give my cloak to the man who take away\r\nmy coat".  I have read that Christ taught that His followers must do\r\nall these things, but as I do not pretend to be one of His followers I\r\ndon\'t do them.  But you believe in Christianity: why don\'t you do the\r\nthings that He said?\'\r\n\r\nAs nobody seemed to know the answer to this question, the lecturer\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n\'In this matter the difference between so-called "Christians" and\r\nSocialists is this: Christ taught the Fatherhood of God and the\r\nBrotherhood of Men.  Those who today pretend to be Christ\'s followers\r\nhypocritically profess to carry out those teachings now.  But they\r\ndon\'t. They have arranged "The Battle of Life" system instead!\r\n\r\n\'The Socialist--very much against his will--finds himself in the midst\r\nof this horrible battle, and he appeals to the other combatants to\r\ncease from fighting and to establish a system of Brotherly Love and\r\nMutual Helpfulness, but he does not hypocritically pretend to practise\r\nbrotherly love towards those who will not agree to his appeal, and who\r\ncompel him to fight with them for his very life.  He knows that in this\r\nbattle he must either fight or go under.  Therefore, in self-defiance,\r\nhe fights; but all the time he continues his appeal for the cessation\r\nof the slaughter.  He pleads for the changing of the system. He advocates\r\nCo-operation instead of Competition: but how can he co-operate with\r\npeople who insist on competing with him?  No individual can practise\r\nco-operation by himself!  Socialism can only be practised by the\r\nCommunity--that is the meaning of the word.  At present, the other\r\nmembers of the community--the "Christians"--deride and oppose the\r\nSocialist\'s appeal.\r\n\r\n\'It is these pretended Christians who do not practise what they preach,\r\nbecause, all the time they are singing their songs of Brotherhood and\r\nLove, they are fighting with each other, and strangling each other and\r\ntrampling each other underfoot in their horrible "Battle of Life"!\r\n\r\n\'No Socialist suggests "Sharing out" money or anything else in the\r\nmanner you say.  And another thing: if you only had a little more sense\r\nyou might be able to perceive that this stock "argument" of yours is\r\nreally an argument against the present system, inasmuch as it proves\r\nthat Money is in itself of no use whatever.  Supposing all the money\r\nwas shared out equally; and suppose there was enough of it for everyone\r\nto have ten thousand pounds; and suppose they then all thought they\r\nwere rich and none of them would work.  What would they live on?  Their\r\nmoney?  Could they eat it or drink it or wear it?  It wouldn\'t take\r\nthem very long to find out that this wonderful money--which under the\r\npresent system is the most powerful thing in existence--is really of no\r\nmore use than so much dirt.  They would speedily perish, not from lack\r\nof money, but from lack of wealth--that is, from lack of things that\r\nare made by work.  And further, it is quite true that if all the money\r\nwere distributed equally amongst all the people tomorrow, it would all\r\nbe up in heaps again in a very short time.  But that only proves that\r\nwhile the present Money System remains, it will be impossible to do\r\naway with poverty, for heaps in some places mean little or nothing in\r\nother places.  Therefore while the money system lasts we are bound to\r\nhave poverty and all the evils it brings in its train.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, of course everybody\'s an idjit except you,\' sneered Crass, who was\r\nbeginning to feel rather fogged.\r\n\r\n\'I rise to a pint of order,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'And I rise to order a pint,\' cried Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Order what the bloody \'ell you like,\' remarked Harlow, \'so long as I\r\n\'aven\'t got to pay for it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mine\'s a pint of porter,\' observed the man on the pail.\r\n\r\n\'The pint is,\' proceeded Easton, \'when does the lecturer intend to\r\nexplain to us what is the real cause of poverty.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' cried Harlow.  \'That\'s what I want to know, too.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what I should like to know is, who is supposed to be givin\' this\r\n\'ere lecture?\' inquired the man on the pail.\r\n\r\n\'Why, Owen, of course,\' replied Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Well, why don\'t you try to keep quiet for a few minutes and let \'im\r\nget on with it?\'\r\n\r\n\'The next b--r wot interrupts,\' cried Philpot, rolling up his\r\nshirt-sleeves and glaring threateningly round upon the meeting.  \'The\r\nnext b--r wot interrupts goes out through the bloody winder!\'\r\n\r\nAt this, everybody pretended to be very frightened, and edged away as\r\nfar as possible from Philpot.  Easton, who was sitting next to him, got\r\nup and crossed over to Owen\'s vacant seat.  The man on the pail was the\r\nonly one who did not seem nervous; perhaps he felt safer because he\r\nwas, as usual, surrounded by a moat.\r\n\r\n\'Poverty,\' resumed the lecturer, consists in a shortage of the\r\nnecessaries of life--or rather, of the benefits of civilization.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve said that about a \'undred times before,\' snarled Crass.\r\n\r\n\'I know I have; and I have no doubt I shall have to say it about five\r\nhundred times more before you understand what it means.\'\r\n\r\n\'Get on with the bloody lecture,\' shouted the man on the pail.  \'Never\r\nmind arguin\' the point.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, keep horder, can\'t you?\' cried Philpot, fiercely, \'and give the\r\nman a chance.\'\r\n\r\n\'All these things are produced in the same way,\' proceeded Owen. \'They\r\nare made from the Raw materials by those who work--aided by machinery.\r\nWhen we inquire into the cause of the present shortage of these things,\r\nthe first question we should ask is--Are there not sufficient of the\r\nraw materials in existence to enable us to produce enough to satisfy\r\nthe needs of all?\r\n\r\n\'The answer to this question is--There are undoubtedly more than\r\nsufficient of all the raw materials.\r\n\r\n\'Insufficiency of raw material is therefore not the cause.  We must\r\nlook in another direction.\r\n\r\n\'The next question is--Are we short of labour?  Is there not a\r\nsufficient number of people able and willing to work?  Or is there not\r\nenough machinery?\r\n\r\n\'The answers to these questions are--There are plenty of people able\r\nand willing to work, and there is plenty of machinery!\r\n\r\n\'These things being so, how comes this extraordinary result?  How is it\r\nthat the benefits of civilization are not produced in sufficient\r\nquantity to satisfy the needs of all?  How is it that the majority of\r\nthe people always have to go without most of the refinements, comforts,\r\nand pleasures of life, and very often without even the bare necessaries\r\nof existence?\r\n\r\n\'Plenty of materials--Plenty of Labour--Plenty of Machinery--and,\r\nnearly everybody going short of nearly everything!\r\n\r\n\'The cause of this extraordinary state of affairs is that although we\r\npossess the means of producing more than abundance for all, we also\r\nhave an imbecile system of managing our affairs.\r\n\r\n\'The present Money System prevents us from doing the necessary work,\r\nand consequently causes the majority of the population to go short of\r\nthe things that can be made by work.  They suffer want in the midst of\r\nthe means of producing abundance.  They remain idle because they are\r\nbound and fettered with a chain of gold.\r\n\r\n\'Let us examine the details of this insane, idiotic, imbecile system.\'\r\n\r\nOwen now asked Philpot to pass him a piece of charred wood from under\r\nthe grate, and having obtained what he wanted, he drew upon the wall a\r\nquadrangular figure about four feet in length and one foot deep.  The\r\nwalls of the kitchen had not yet been cleaned off, so it did not matter\r\nabout disfiguring them.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  | This represents the whole of the adult population of the country |\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  |                                                                  |\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\'To find out the cause of the shortage in this country of the things\r\nthat can be made by work it is first of all necessary to find out how\r\npeople spend their time.  Now this square represents the whole of the\r\nadult population of this country.  There are many different classes of\r\npeople, engaged in a great number of different occupations.  Some of\r\nthem are helping to produce the benefits of civilization, and some are\r\nnot.  All these people help to consume these things, but when we\r\ninquire into their occupations we shall find that although the majority\r\nare workers, only a comparatively small number are engaged in actually\r\nproducing either the benefits of civilization or the necessaries of\r\nlife.\'...\r\n\r\nOrder being once more restored, the lecturer turned again to the\r\ndrawing on the wall and stretched out his hand, evidently with the\r\nintention of making some addition to it, but instead of doing so he\r\npaused irresolutely, and faltering, let his arm drop down again by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAn absolute, disconcerting silence reigned.  His embarrassment and\r\nnervousness increased.  He knew that they were unwilling to hear or\r\ntalk or think about such subjects as the cause of poverty at all. They\r\npreferred to make fun of and ridicule them.  He knew they would refuse\r\nto try to see the meaning of what he wished to say if it were at all\r\ndifficult or obscure.  How was he to put it to them so that they would\r\nHAVE to understand it whether they wished to or not.  It was almost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy enough to convince them if they would only take a\r\nLITTLE trouble and try to understand, but he knew that they certainly\r\nwould not \'worry\' themselves about such a subject as this; it was not\r\nas if it were some really important matter, such as a smutty story, a\r\ngame of hooks and rings or shove-ha\'penny, something concerning\r\nfootball or cricket, horse-racing or the doings of some Royal personage\r\nor aristocrat.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the cause of poverty was only something that concerned\r\ntheir own and their children\'s future welfare.  Such an unimportant\r\nmatter, being undeserving of any earnest attention, must be put before\r\nthem so clearly and plainly that they would be compelled to understand\r\nit at a glance; and it was almost impossible to do it.\r\n\r\nObserving his hesitation, some of the men began to snigger.  \'\'E seems\r\nto \'ave got \'isself into a bit of a fog,\' remarked Crass in a loud\r\nwhisper to Slyme, who laughed.\r\n\r\nThe sound roused Owen, who resumed:\r\n\r\n\'All these people help to consume the things produced by labour.  We\r\nwill now divide them into separate classes.  Those who help to produce;\r\nthose who do nothing, those who do harm, and those who are engaged in\r\nunnecessary work.\'\r\n\r\n\'And,\' sneered Crass, \'those who are engaged in unnecessary talk.\'\r\n\r\n\'First we will separate those who not only do nothing, but do not even\r\npretend to be of any use; people who would consider themselves\r\ndisgraced if they by any chance did any useful work.  This class\r\nincludes tramps, beggars, the "Aristocracy", "Society" people, great\r\nlandowners, and generally all those possessed of hereditary wealth.\'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he drew a vertical line across one end of the oblong.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Tramps     |                                                     |\r\n  | Beggars    |                                                     |\r\n  | Society    |                                                     |\r\n  | People     |                                                     |\r\n  | Aristoc-   |                                                     |\r\n  | racy       |                                                     |\r\n  | Great      |                                                     |\r\n  | Landowners |                                                     |\r\n  | All those  |                                                     |\r\n  | possessed  |                                                     |\r\n  | of         |                                                     |\r\n  | hereditary |                                                     |\r\n  | wealth     |                                                     |\r\n  +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\'These people do absolutely nothing except devour or enjoy the things\r\nproduced by the labours of others.\r\n\r\n\'Our next division represents those who do work of a kind--"mental"\r\nwork if you like to call it so--work that benefits themselves and harms\r\nother people.

Then there is a vast army of people engaged in\r\ndesigning, composing, painting or printing advertisements, things which\r\nare for the most part of no utility whatever, the object of most\r\nadvertisements is merely to persuade people to buy from one firm rather\r\nthan from another.

Perceiving this, Owen,\r\nspeaking very rapidly, continued:\r\n\r\n\'If you go down town, you will see half a dozen drapers\' shops within a\r\nstone\'s-throw of each other--often even next door to each other--all\r\nselling the same things.  You can\'t possibly think that all those shops\r\nare really necessary?  You know that one of them would serve the\r\npurpose for which they are all intended--to store and serve as a centre\r\nfor the distribution of the things that are made by work.  If you will\r\nadmit that five out of the six shops are not really necessary, you must\r\nalso admit that the men who built them, and the salesmen and women or\r\nother assistants engaged in them, and the men who design and write and\r\nprint their advertisements are all doing unnecessary work; all really\r\nwasting their time and labour, time and labour that might be employed\r\nin helping to produce these things that we are at present short of.\r\nYou must admit that none of these people are engaged in producing\r\neither the necessaries of life or the benefits of civilization.  They\r\nbuy them, and sell them, and handle them, and haggle over, them, and\r\ndisplay them, in the plate glass windows of "Stores" and "Emporiums"\r\nand make profit out of them, and use them, but these people themselves\r\nproduce nothing that is necessary to life or happiness, and the things\r\nthat some of them do produce are only necessary to the present imbecile\r\nsystem.\'\r\n\r\n\'What the \'ell sort of a bloody system do you think we ought to \'ave,\r\nthen?\' interrupted the man on the pail.\r\n\r\n\'Yes: you\'re very good at finding fault,\' sneered Slyme, \'but why don\'t\r\nyou tell us \'ow it\'s all going to be put right?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s not what we\'re talking about now, is it?\' replied Owen.\r\n\'At present we\'re only trying to find out how it is that there is not\r\nsufficient produced for everyone to have enough of the things that are\r\nmade by work.  Although most of the people in number three work very\r\nhard, they produce Nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is a lot of bloody rot!\' exclaimed Crass, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\'Even if there is more shops than what\'s actually necessary,\' cried\r\nHarlow, \'it all helps people to get a livin\'!  If half of \'em was shut\r\nup, it would just mean that all them what works there would be out of a\r\njob.  Live and let live, I say: all these things makes work.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' shouted the man behind the moat.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know it makes "work",\' replied Owen, \'but we can\'t live on mere\r\n"work", you know.  To live in comfort we need a sufficiency of the\r\nthings that can be made by work.  A man might work very hard and yet be\r\nwasting his time if he were not producing something necessary or useful.\r\n\r\n\'Why are there so many shops and stores and emporiums?  Do you imagine\r\nthey exist for the purpose of giving those who build them, or work in\r\nthem, a chance to earn a living? Nothing of the sort.  They are carried\r\non, and exorbitant prices are charged for the articles they sell, to\r\nenable the proprietors to amass fortunes, and to pay extortionate rents\r\nto the landlords.  That is why the wages and salaries of nearly all\r\nthose who do the work created by these businesses are cut down to the\r\nlowest possible point.\'\r\n\r\n\'We knows all about that,\' said Crass, \'but you can\'t get away from it\r\nthat all these things makes Work; and that\'s what we wants--Plenty of\r\nWork.\'\r\n\r\nCries of \'\'Ear, \'ear,\' and expressions of dissent from the views\r\nexpressed by the lecturer resounded through the room, nearly everyone\r\nspeaking at the same time.  After a while, when the row had in some\r\nmeasure subsided, Owen resumed:\r\n\r\n\'Nature has not provided ready-made all the things necessary for the\r\nlife and happiness of mankind.  In order to obtain these things we have\r\nto Work.  The only rational labour is that which is directed to the\r\ncreation of those things.  Any kind of work which does not help us to\r\nattain this object is a ridiculous, idiotic, criminal, imbecile, waste\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n\'That is what the great army of people represented by division number\r\nthree are doing at present: they are all very busy--working very\r\nhard--but to all useful intents and purposes they are doing Nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, all right,\' said Harlow.  \'\'Ave it yer own way, but there\'s no\r\nneed to keep on repeating the same thing over an\' over again.\'\r\n\r\n\'The next division,\' resumed Owen, \'stands for those who are engaged in\r\nreally useful work--the production of the benefits of civilization--the\r\nnecessaries, refinements and comforts of life.\'\r\n\r\n        1             2             3            4\r\n  +------------+-------------+-------------+------------+------------+\r\n  | Tramps     | Exploiters  | All those   | All those  |            |\r\n  | Beggars    | of Labour   | engaged in  | engaged in |            |\r\n  | Society    | Thieves     | unnecessary | necessary  |     U      |\r\n  | People     | Swindlers   | work        | work--the  |     N      |\r\n  | Aristoc-   | Pickpockets |             | production |     E      |\r\n  | racy       | Burglars    |             | of the     |     M      |\r\n  | Great      | Bishops     |             | benefits   |     P      |\r\n  | Landowners | Financiers  |             | of         |     L      |\r\n  | All those  | Capitalists |             | civiliz-   |     O      |\r\n  | possessed  | Share-      |             | ation      |     Y      |\r\n  | of         | holders     |             |            |     E      |\r\n  | hereditary | Ministers   |             |            |     D      |\r\n  | wealth     | of religion |             |            |            |\r\n  +------------+-------------+-------------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\n\'Hooray!\' shouted Philpot, leading off a cheer which was taken up\r\nenthusiastically by the crowd, \'Hooray!  This is where WE comes in,\' he\r\nadded, nodding his head and winking his goggle eyes at the meeting.\r\n\r\n\'I wish to call the chairman to horder,\' said the man on the pail.\r\n\r\nWhen Owen had finished writing in the list of occupations several\r\nmembers of the audience rose to point out that those engaged in the\r\nproduction of beer had been omitted.  Owen rectified this serious\r\noversight and proceeded:\r\n\r\n\'As most of the people in number four are out of work at least one\r\nquarter of their time, we must reduce the size of this division by one\r\nfourth--so.  The grey part represents the unemployed.\'\r\n\r\n\'But some of those in number three are often unemployed as well,\' said\r\nHarlow.\r\n\r\nYes: but as THEY produce nothing even when they are at work we need not\r\ntrouble to classify them unemployed, because our present purpose is\r\nonly to discover the reason why there is not enough produced for\r\neveryone to enjoy abundance; and this--the Present System of conducting\r\nour affairs--is the reason of the shortage--the cause of poverty.  When\r\nyou reflect that all the other people are devouring the things produced\r\nby those in number four--can you wonder that there is not plenty for\r\nall?\'\r\n\r\n\'"Devouring" is a good word,\' said Philpot, and the others laughed.\r\n\r\nThe lecturer now drew a small square upon the wall below the other\r\ndrawing.  This square he filled in solid black.\r\n\r\n        1             2             3            4\r\n  +------------+-------------+-------------+------------+------------+\r\n  | Tramps     | Exploiters  | All those   | All those  |            |\r\n  | Beggars    | of Labour   | engaged in  | engaged in |            |\r\n  | Society    | Thieves     | unnecessary | necessary  |     U      |\r\n  | People     | Swindlers   | work        | work--the  |     N      |\r\n  | Aristoc-   | Pickpockets |             | production |     E      |\r\n  | racy       | Burglars    |             | of the     |     M      |\r\n  | Great      | Bishops     |             | benefits   |     P      |\r\n  | Landowners | Financiers  |             | of         |     L      |\r\n  | All those  | Capitalists |             | civiliz-   |     O      |\r\n  | possessed  | Share-      |             | ation      |     Y      |\r\n  | of         | holders     |             |            |     E      |\r\n  | hereditary | Ministers   |             |            |     D      |\r\n  | wealth     | of religion |             |            |            |\r\n  +------------+-------------+-------------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\n                                    ##############\r\n                                    ##############\r\n                                    ##############\r\n        This represents the total   ##############\r\n        of the things produced by   ##############\r\n        the people in division 4.   ##############\r\n\r\n\'This represents the total amount of the benefits of civilization and\r\nnecessaries of life produced by the people in number four.

Not at all.  Some get very little, some none, some more than a\r\nfair share.  It is in these two divisions that the ferocious "Battle of\r\nLife" rages most fiercely; and of course in this battle the weak and\r\nthe virtuous fare the worst.  Even those whose exceptional abilities or\r\nopportunities enable them to succeed, are compelled to practise\r\nselfishness, because a man of exceptional ability who was not selfish\r\nwould devote his abilities to relieving the manifest sufferings of\r\nothers, and not to his own profit, and if he did the former he would\r\nnot be successful in the sense that the world understands the word.\r\nAll those who really seek to "Love their neighbour as themselves", or\r\nto return good for evil, the gentle, the kind, and all those who\r\nrefrain from doing to others the things they would not like to suffer\r\nthemselves; all these are of necessity found amongst the vanquished;\r\nbecause only the worst--only those who are aggressive, cunning, selfish\r\nand mean are fitted to survive.  And all these people in numbers three\r\nand four are so fully occupied in this dreadful struggle to secure a\r\nlittle, that but few of them pause to inquire why there are not more of\r\nthe things they are fighting for, or why it is necessary to fight like\r\nthis at all!\'\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes silence prevailed, each man\'s mind being busy trying\r\nto think of some objection to the lecturer\'s arguments.\r\n\r\n\'How could the small number of people in number one and two consume as\r\nmuch as you\'ve given \'em in your drorin\'?\' demanded Crass.\r\n\r\n\'They don\'t actually consume all of it,\' replied Owen.  \'Much of it is\r\nwantonly wasted.  They also make fortunes by selling some of it in\r\nforeign countries; but they consume a great part of it themselves,\r\nbecause the amount of labour expended on the things enjoyed by these\r\npeople is greater than that expended in the production of the things\r\nused by the workers.  Most of the people who do nothing get the best of\r\neverything.  More than three-quarters of the time of the working\r\nclasses is spent in producing the things used by the wealthy.  Compare\r\nthe quality and quantity of the clothing possessed by the wife or\r\ndaughter of a rich man with that of the wife or daughter of a worker.\r\nThe time and labour spent on producing the one is twenty times greater\r\nin one case than in the other; and it\'s the same with everything else.\r\nTheir homes, their clothing, boots, hats, jewellery, and their food.\r\nEverything must be of the very best that art or long and painful labour\r\ncan produce.  But for most of those whose labour produces all these\r\ngood things--anything is considered good enough.  For themselves, the\r\nphilanthropic workers manufacture shoddy cloth--that is, cheap cloth\r\nmade of old rags and dirt; and shoddy, uncomfortable ironclad boots.\r\nIf you see a workman wearing a really good suit of clothes you may\r\nsafely conclude that he is either leading an unnatural life--that is,\r\nhe is not married--or that he has obtained it from a tallyman on the\r\nhire system and has not yet paid for it--or that it is someone else\'s\r\ncast-off suit that he has bought second-hand or had given to him by\r\nsome charitable person.  It\'s the same with the food. All the ducks and\r\ngeese, pheasants, partridges, and all the very best parts of the very\r\nbest meat--all the soles and the finest plaice and salmon and trout--\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere chuck it,\' cried Harlow, fiercely.  \'We don\'t want to \'ear no\r\nmore of it,\' and several others protested against the lecturer wasting\r\ntime on such mere details.\r\n\r\n\'--all the very best of everything is reserved exclusively for the\r\nenjoyment of the people in divisions one and two, while the workers\r\nsubsist on block ornaments, margarine, adulterated tea, mysterious\r\nbeer, and are content--only grumbling when they are unable to obtain\r\neven such fare as this.\'\r\n\r\nOwen paused and a gloomy silence followed, but suddenly Crass\r\nbrightened up.  He detected a serious flaw in the lecturer\'s argument.\r\n\r\n\'You say the people in one and two gets all the best of everything, but\r\nwhat about the tramps and beggars?  You\'ve got them in division one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know.  You see, that\'s the proper place for them.  They belong\r\nto a Loafer class.  They are no better mentally or morally than any of\r\nthe other loafers in that division; neither are they of any more use.\r\nOf course, when we consider them in relation to the amount they consume\r\nof the things produced by others, they are not so harmful as the other\r\nloafers, because they consume comparatively little.  But all the same\r\nthey are in their right place in that division.  All those people don\'t\r\nget the same share.  The section represents not individuals--but the\r\nloafer class.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I thought you said you was goin\' to prove that money was the cause\r\nof poverty,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'So it is,\' said Owen.  \'Can\'t you see that it\'s money that\'s caused\r\nall these people to lose sight of the true purpose of labour--the\r\nproduction of the things we need?  All these people are suffering from\r\nthe delusion that it doesn\'t matter what kind of work they do--or\r\nwhether they merely do nothing--so long as they get MONEY for doing it.\r\nUnder the present extraordinary system, that\'s the only object they\r\nhave in view--to get money.  Their ideas are so topsy-turvey that they\r\nregard with contempt those who are engaged in useful work! With the\r\nexception of criminals and the poorer sort of loafers, the working\r\nclasses are considered to be the lowest and least worthy in the\r\ncommunity.  Those who manage to get money for doing something other\r\nthan productive work are considered more worthy of respect on that\r\naccount.  Those who do nothing themselves, but get money out of the\r\nlabour of others, are regarded as being more worthy still!  But the\r\nones who are esteemed most of all and honoured above all the rest, are\r\nthose who obtain money for doing absolutely nothing!\'\r\n\r\n\'But I can\'t see as that proves that money is the cause of poverty,\'\r\nsaid Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Owen.  \'The people in number four produce everything,\r\ndon\'t they?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; we knows all about that,\' interrupted Harlow.  \'But they gets\r\npaid for it, don\'t they?  They gets their wages.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and what does their wages consist of?\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'Why, money, of course,\' replied Harlow, impatiently.\r\n\r\nAnd what do they do with their money when they get it?  Do they eat it,\r\nor drink it, or wear it?\'\r\n\r\nAt this apparently absurd question several of those who had hitherto\r\nbeen attentive listeners laughed derisively; it was really very\r\ndifficult to listen patiently to such nonsense.\r\n\r\n\'Of course they don\'t,\' answered Harlow scornfully.  \'They buy the\r\nthings they want with it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think that most of them manage to save a part of their\r\nwages--put it away in the bank.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I can speak for meself,\' replied Harlow amid laughter.  \'It\r\ntakes me all my bloody time to pay my rent and other expenses and to\r\nkeep my little lot in shoe leather, and it\'s dam little I spend on\r\nbeer; p\'r\'aps a tanner or a bob a week at the most.\'\r\n\r\n\'A single man can save money if he likes,\' said Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not speaking of single men,\' replied Owen.  \'I\'m referring to\r\nthose who live natural lives.\'\r\n\r\n\'What about all the money what\'s in the Post Office Savings Bank, and\r\nBuilding and Friendly Societies?\' said Crass.\r\n\r\n\'A very large part of that belongs to people who are in business, or\r\nwho have some other source of income than their own wages.  There are\r\nsome exceptionally fortunate workers who happen to have good situations\r\nand higher wages than the ordinary run of workmen.  Then there are some\r\nwho are so placed--by letting lodgings, for instance--that they are\r\nable to live rent free.  Others whose wives go out to work; and others\r\nagain who have exceptional jobs and work a lot of overtime--but these\r\nare all exceptional cases.\'\r\n\r\n\'I say as no married workin\' man can save any money at all!\' shouted\r\nHarlow, \'not unless \'e goes without some of even the few things we are\r\nable to get--and makes \'is wife and kids go without as well.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' said everybody except Crass and Slyme, who were both\r\nthrifty working men, and each of them had some money saved in one or\r\nother of the institutions mentioned.\r\n\r\n\'Then that means,\' said Owen, \'that means that the wages the people in\r\ndivision four receive is not equivalent to the work they do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wotcher mean, equivalent?\' cried Crass.  \'Why the \'ell don\'t yer talk\r\nplain English without draggin\' in a lot of long words wot nobody can\'t\r\nunderstand?\'\r\n\r\n\'I mean this,\' replied Owen, speaking very slowly.  \'Everything is\r\nproduced by the people in number four.  In return for their work they\r\nare given--Money, and the things they have made become the property of\r\nthe people who do nothing.  Then, as the money is of no use, the\r\nworkers go to shops and give it away in exchange for some of the things\r\nthey themselves have made.  They spend--or give back--ALL their wages;\r\nbut as the money they got as wages is not equal in value to the things\r\nthey produced, they find that they are only able to buy back a VERY\r\nSMALL PART.  So you see that these little discs of metal--this\r\nMoney--is a device for enabling those who do not work to rob the\r\nworkers of the greater part of the fruits of their toil.\'\r\n\r\nThe silence that ensued was broken by Crass.\r\n\r\n\'It sounds very pretty,\' he sneered, \'but I can\'t make no \'ead or tail\r\nof it, meself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Look here!\' cried Owen.  \'The producing class--these people in number\r\nfour are supposed to be paid for their work.  Their wages are supposed\r\nto be equal in value to their work.  But it\'s not so.  If it were, by\r\nspending all their wages, the producing class would be able to buy back\r\nAll they had produced.\'\r\n\r\nOwen ceased speaking and silence once more ensued.  No one gave any\r\nsign of understanding, or of agreeing or of disagreeing with what he\r\nhad said.  Their attitude was strictly neutral.  Barrington\'s pipe had\r\ngone out during the argument.  He relit it from the fire with a piece\r\nof twisted paper.\r\n\r\n\'If their wages were really equal in value to the product of their\r\nlabour,\' Owen repeated, \'they would be able to buy back not a small\r\npart--but the Whole.\'...\r\n\r\nAt this, a remark from Bundy caused a shout of laughter, and when\r\nWantley added point to the joke by making a sound like the discharge of\r\na pistol the merriment increased tenfold.\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s done it,\' remarked Easton, as he got up and opened the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s about time you was buried, if the smell\'s anything to go by,\'\r\nsaid Harlow, addressing Wantley, who laughed and appeared to think he\r\nhad distinguished himself.\r\n\r\n\'But even if we include the whole of the working classes,\' continued\r\nOwen, \'that is, the people in number three as well as those in number\r\nfour, we find that their combined wages are insufficient to buy the\r\nthings made by the producers.  The total value of the wealth produced\r\nin this country during the last year was L1,800,000,000, and the total\r\namount paid in wages during the same period was only L600,000,000.  In\r\nother words, by means of the Money Trick, the workers were robbed of\r\ntwo-thirds of the value of their labour.  All the people in numbers\r\nthree and four are working and suffering and starving and fighting in\r\norder that the rich people in numbers one and two may live in luxury,\r\nand do nothing.  These are the wretches who cause poverty: they not\r\nonly devour or waste or hoard the things made by the worker, but as\r\nsoon as their own wants are supplied--they compel the workers to cease\r\nworking and prevent them producing the things they need.  Most of these\r\npeople!\' cried Owen, his usually pale face flushing red and his eyes\r\nshining with sudden anger, \'most of these people do not deserve to be\r\ncalled human beings at all!  They\'re devils!  They know that whilst\r\nthey are indulging in pleasures of every kind--all around them men and\r\nwomen and little children are existing in want or dying of hunger.\'\r\n\r\nThe silence which followed was at length broken by Harlow:\r\n\r\n\'You say the workers is entitled to all they produce, but you forget\r\nthere\'s the raw materials to pay for.  They don\'t make them, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course the workers don\'t create the raw materials,\' replied Owen.\r\n\'But I am not aware that the capitalists or the landlords do so either.\r\nThe raw materials exist in abundance in and on the earth, but they are\r\nof no use until labour has been applied to them.\'\r\n\r\n\'But then, you see, the earth belongs to the landlords!\' cried Crass,\r\nunguardedly.\r\n\r\n\'I know that; and of course you think it\'s right that the whole country\r\nshould belong to a few people--\'\r\n\r\n\'I must call the lecturer to horder,\' interrupted Philpot.  \'The land\r\nquestion is not before the meeting at present.\'\r\n\r\n\'You talk about the producers being robbed of most of the value of what\r\nthey produce,\' said Harlow, \'but you must remember that it ain\'t all\r\nproduced by hand labour.  What about the things what\'s made by\r\nmachinery?\'\r\n\r\n\'The machines themselves were made by the workers,\' returned Owen, \'but\r\nof course they do not belong to the workers, who have been robbed of\r\nthem by means of the Money Trick.\'\r\n\r\n\'But who invented all the machinery?\' cried Crass.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s more than you or I or anyone else can say,\' returned Owen, \'but\r\nit certainly wasn\'t the wealthy loafer class, or the landlords, or the\r\nemployers.  Most of the men who invented the machinery lived and died\r\nunknown, in poverty and often in actual want.  The inventors too were\r\nrobbed by the exploiter-of-labour class.  There are no men living at\r\npresent who can justly claim to have invented the machinery that exists\r\ntoday.  The most they can truthfully say is that they have added to or\r\nimproved upon the ideas of those who lived and worked before them.\r\nEven Watt and Stevenson merely improved upon steam engines and\r\nlocomotives already existing.  Your question has really nothing to do\r\nwith the subject we are discussing: we are only trying to find out why\r\nthe majority of people have to go short of the benefits of\r\ncivilization.  One of the causes is--the majority of the population are\r\nengaged in work that does not produce those things; and most of what IS\r\nproduced is appropriated and wasted by those who have no right to it.\r\n\r\n\'The workers produce Everything!  If you walk through the streets of a\r\ntown or a city, and look around, Everything that you can\r\nsee--Factories, Machinery, Houses, Railways, Tramways, Canals,\r\nFurniture, Clothing, Food and the very road or pavement you stand upon\r\nwere all made by the working class, who spend all their wages in buying\r\nback only a very small part of the things they produce.  Therefore what\r\nremains in the possession of their masters represents the difference\r\nbetween the value of the work done and the wages paid for doing it.\r\nThis systematic robbery has been going on for generations, the value of\r\nthe accumulated loot is enormous, and all of it, all the wealth at\r\npresent in the possession of the rich, is rightly the property of the\r\nworking class--it has been stolen from them by means of the Money\r\nTrick.\'...\r\n\r\nFor some moments an oppressive silence prevailed.  The men stared with\r\npuzzled, uncomfortable looks alternately at each other and at the\r\ndrawings on the wall.  They were compelled to do a little thinking on\r\ntheir own account, and it was a process to which they were\r\nunaccustomed.  In their infancy they had been taught to distrust their\r\nown intelligence and to leave \'thinking\' to their \'pastors\' and masters\r\nand to their \'betters\' generally.  All their lives they had been true\r\nto this teaching, they had always had blind, unreasoning faith in the\r\nwisdom and humanity of their pastors and masters.  That was the reason\r\nwhy they and their children had been all their lives on the verge of\r\nstarvation and nakedness, whilst their \'betters\'--who did nothing but\r\nthe thinking--went clothed in purple and fine linen and fared\r\nsumptuously every day.\r\n\r\nSeveral men had risen from their seats and were attentively studying\r\nthe diagrams Owen had drawn on the wall; and nearly all the others were\r\nmaking the same mental efforts--they were trying to think of something\r\nto say in defence of those who robbed them of the fruits of their toil.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see no bloody sense in always runnin\' down the rich,\' said\r\nHarlow at last.  \'There\'s always been rich and poor in the world and\r\nthere always will be.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said Slyme.  \'It says in the Bible that the poor shall\r\nalways be with us.\'\r\n\r\n\'What the bloody \'ell kind of system do you think we ought to \'ave?\'\r\ndemanded Crass.  \'If everything\'s wrong, \'ow\'s it goin\' to be altered?\'\r\n\r\nAt this, everybody brightened up again, and exchanged looks of\r\nsatisfaction and relief.  Of course!  It wasn\'t necessary to think\r\nabout these things at all!  Nothing could ever be altered: it had\r\nalways been more or less the same, and it always would be.\r\n\r\n\'It seems to me that you all HOPE it is impossible to alter it,\' said\r\nOwen.  \'Without trying to find out whether it could be done, you\r\npersuade yourselves that it is impossible, and then, instead of being\r\nsorry, you\'re glad!\'\r\n\r\nSome of them laughed in a silly, half-ashamed way.\r\n\r\n\'How do YOU reckon it could be altered?\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'The way to alter it is, first to enlighten the people as to the real\r\ncause of their sufferings, and then--\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' interrupted Crass, with a self-satisfied chuckle, \'it\'ll take a\r\nbetter bloody man than you to enlighten ME!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want to be henlightened into Darkness!\' said Slyme piously.\r\n\r\n\'But what sort of System do you propose, then?\' repeated Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'After you\'ve got \'em all enlightened--if you don\'t believe in sharing\r\nout all the money equal, how ARE you goin\' to alter it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know \'ow \'e\'s goin\' to alter it,\' sneered Crass, looking at\r\nhis watch and standing up, \'but I do know what the time is--two minits\r\npast one!\'\r\n\r\n\'The next lecture,\' said Philpot, addressing the meeting as they all\r\nprepared to return to work, \'the next lecture will be postponded till\r\ntomorrer at the usual time, when it will be my painful dooty to call\r\nupon Mr Owen to give \'is well-known and most hobnoxious address\r\nentitled "Work and how to avoid it."  Hall them as wants to be\r\nhenlightened kindly attend.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or hall them as don\'t get the sack tonight,\' remarked Easton grimly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 26\r\n\r\nThe Slaughter\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, Rushton and Sweater visited the house, the latter\r\nhaving an appointment to meet there a gardener to whom he wished to\r\ngive instructions concerning the laying out of the grounds, which had\r\nbeen torn up for the purpose of putting in the new drains. Sweater had\r\nalready arranged with the head gardener of the public park to steal\r\nsome of the best plants from that place and have them sent up to \'The\r\nCave\'.  These plants had been arriving in small lots for about a week.\r\nThey must have been brought there either in the evening after the men\r\nleft off or very early in the morning before they came.  The two\r\ngentlemen remained at the house for about half an hour and as they went\r\naway the mournful sound of the Town Hall bell--which was always tolled\r\nto summon meetings of the Council--was heard in the distance, and the\r\nhands remarked to each other that another robbery was about to be\r\nperpetrated.\r\n\r\nHunter did not come to the job again that day: he had been sent by\r\nRushton to price some work for which the firm was going to tender an\r\nestimate.  There was only one person who felt any regret at his\r\nabsence, and that was Mrs White--Bert\'s mother, who had been working at\r\n\'The Cave\' for several days, scrubbing the floors.  As a rule, Hunter\r\npaid her wages every night, and on this occasion she happened to need\r\nthe money even more than usual.  As leaving off time drew near, she\r\nmentioned the matter to Crass, who advised her to call at the office on\r\nher way home and ask the young lady clerk for the money. As Hunter did\r\nnot appear, she followed the foreman\'s advice.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the shop Rushton was just coming out.  She explained\r\nto him what she wanted and he instructed Mr Budd to tell Miss Wade to\r\npay her.  The shopman accordingly escorted her to the office at the\r\nback of the shop, and the young lady book-keeper--after referring to\r\nformer entries to make quite certain of the amount, paid her the sum\r\nthat Hunter had represented as her wages, the same amount that Miss\r\nWade had on the previous occasions given him to pay the charwoman. When\r\nMrs White got outside she found that she held in her hand half a crown\r\ninstead of the two shillings she usually received from Mr Hunter.  At\r\nfirst she felt inclined to take it back, but after some hesitation she\r\nthought it better to wait until she saw Hunter, when she could tell him\r\nabout it; but the next morning when she saw the disciple at \'The Cave\'\r\nhe broached the subject first, and told her that Miss Wade had made a\r\nmistake.  And that evening when he paid her, he deducted the sixpence\r\nfrom the usual two shillings.\r\n\r\nThe lecture announced by Philpot was not delivered.  Anxiously awaiting\r\nthe impending slaughter the men kept tearing into it as usual, for they\r\ngenerally keep working in the usual way, each one trying to outdo the\r\nothers so as not to lose his chance of being one of the lucky one...\r\n\r\nMisery now went round and informed all the men with the exception of\r\nCrass, Owen, Slyme and Sawkins--that they would have to stand off that\r\nnight.  He told them that the firm had several jobs in view--work they\r\nhad tendered for and hoped to get, and said they could look round after\r\nChristmas and he might--possibly--be able to start some of them again.\r\nThey would be paid at the office tomorrow--Saturday--at one o\'clock as\r\nusual, but if any of them wished they could have their money tonight.\r\nThe men thanked him, and most of them said they would come for their\r\nwages at the usual pay-time, and would call round as he suggested,\r\nafter the holidays, to see if there was anything to do.\r\n\r\nIn all, fifteen men--including Philpot, Harlow, Easton and Ned Dawson,\r\nwere to \'stand off\' that night.  They took their dismissal stolidly,\r\nwithout any remark, some of them even with an affectation of\r\nindifference, but there were few attempts at conversation afterwards.\r\nThe little work that remained to be done they did in silence, every man\r\noppressed by the same terror--the dread of the impending want, the\r\nprivation and unhappiness that they knew they and their families would\r\nhave to suffer during the next few months.\r\n\r\nBundy and his mate Dawson were working in the kitchen fixing the new\r\nrange in place of the old one which they had taken out.  They had been\r\nengaged on this job all day, and their hands and faces and clothes were\r\ncovered with soot, which they had also contrived to smear and dab all\r\nover the surfaces of the doors and other woodwork in the room, much to\r\nthe indignation of Crass and Slyme, who had to wash it all off before\r\nthey could put on the final coat of paint.\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t help makin\' a little mess on a job of this kind, you know,\'\r\nremarked Bundy, as he was giving the finishing touches to the work,\r\nmaking good the broken parts of the wall with cement, whilst his mate\r\nwas clearing away the debris.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; but there\'s no need to claw \'old of the bloody doors every time\r\nyou goes in and out,\' snarled Crass, \'and you could \'ave put yer tools\r\non the floor instead of makin\' a bench of the dresser.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can \'ave the bloody place all to yerself in about five minutes,\'\r\nreplied Bundy, as he assisted to lift a sack of cement weighing about\r\ntwo hundredweight on to Dawson\'s back.  \'We\'re finished now.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they had cleared away all the dirt and fragments of bricks and\r\nmortar, while Crass and Slyme proceeded with the painting, Bundy and\r\nDawson loaded up their hand-cart with the old range and the bags of\r\nunused cement and plaster, which they took back to the yard. Meantime,\r\nMisery was wandering about the house and gounds like an evil spirit\r\nseeking rest and finding none.  He stood for some time gloomily\r\nwatching the four gardeners, who were busily at work laying strips of\r\nturf, mowing the lawn, rolling the gravel paths and trimming the trees\r\nand bushes.  The boy Bert, Philpot, Harlow, Easton and Sawkins were\r\nloading a hand-cart with ladders and empty paint-pots to return to the\r\nyard. Just as they were setting out, Misery stopped them, remarking\r\nthat the cart was not half loaded--he said it would take a month to get\r\nall the stuff away if they went on like that; so by his directions they\r\nplaced another long ladder on top of the pile and once more started on\r\ntheir way, but before they had gone two dozen yards one of the wheels\r\nof the cart collapsed and the load was scattered over the roadway.\r\nBert was at the same side of the cart as the wheel that broke and he\r\nwas thrown violently to the ground, where he lay half stunned, in the\r\nmidst of the ladders and planks.  When they got him out they were\r\nastonished to find that, thanks to the special Providence that watches\r\nover all small boys, he was almost unhurt--just a little dazed, that\r\nwas all; and by the time Sawkins returned with another cart, Bert was\r\nable to help to gather up the fallen paint-pots and to accompany the\r\nmen with the load to the yard.  At the corner of the road they paused\r\nto take a last look at the \'job\'.\r\n\r\n\'There it stands!\' said Harlow, tragically, extending his arm towards\r\nthe house.  \'There it stands!  A job that if they\'d only have let us do\r\nit properly, couldn\'t \'ave been done with the number of \'ands we\'ve\r\n\'ad, in less than four months; and there it is, finished, messed up,\r\nslobbered over and scamped, in nine weeks!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and now we can all go to \'ell,\' said Philpot, gloomily.\r\n\r\nAt the yard they found Bundy and his mate, Ned Dawson, who helped them\r\nto hang up the ladders in their usual places.  Philpot was glad to get\r\nout of assisting to do this, for he had contracted a rather severe\r\nattack of rheumatism when working outside at the \'Cave\'.  Whilst the\r\nothers were putting the ladders away he assisted Bert to carry the\r\npaint-pots and buckets into the paint shop, and while there he filled a\r\nsmall medicine bottle he had brought with him for the purpose, with\r\nturpentine from the tank.  He wanted this stuff to rub into his\r\nshoulders and legs, and as he secreted the bottle in the inner pocket\r\nof his coat, he muttered: \'This is where we gets some of our own back.\'\r\n\r\nThey took the key of the yard to the office and as they separated to go\r\nhome Bundy suggested that the best thing they could do would be to sew\r\ntheir bloody mouths up for a few months, because there was not much\r\nprobability of their getting another job until about March.\r\n\r\nThe next morning while Crass and Slyme were finishing inside, Owen\r\nwrote the two gates.  On the front entrance \'The Cave\' and on the back\r\n\'Tradesmens Entrance\', in gilded letters.  In the meantime, Sawkins and\r\nBert made several journeys to the Yard with the hand-cart.\r\n\r\nCrass--working in the kitchen with Slyme--was very silent and\r\nthoughtful.  Ever since the job was started, every time Mr Sweater had\r\nvisited the house to see what progress was being made, Crass had been\r\ngrovelling to him in the hope of receiving a tip when the work was\r\nfinished.  He had been very careful to act upon any suggestions that\r\nSweater had made from time to time and on several occasions had taken a\r\nlot of trouble to get just the right tints of certain colours, making\r\nup a number of different shades and combinations, and doing parts of\r\nthe skirtings or mouldings of rooms in order that Mr Sweater might see\r\nexactly--before they went on with it--what it would look like when\r\nfinished.  He made a great pretence of deferring to Sweater\'s opinion,\r\nand assured him that he did not care how much trouble he took as long\r\nas he--Sweater--was pleased.  In fact, it was no trouble at all: it was\r\na pleasure.  As the work neared completion, Crass began to speculate\r\nupon the probable amount of the donation he would receive as the reward\r\nof nine weeks of cringing, fawning, abject servility.  He thought it\r\nquite possible that he might get a quid: it would not be too much,\r\nconsidering all the trouble he had taken.  It was well worth it.  At\r\nany rate, he felt certain that he was sure to get ten bob; a gentleman\r\nlike Mr Sweater would never have the cheek to offer less.  The more he\r\nthought about it the more improbable it appeared that the amount would\r\nbe less than a quid, and he made up his mind that whatever he got he\r\nwould take good care that none of the other men knew anything about it.\r\nHE was the one who had had all the worry of the job, and he was the\r\nonly one entitled to anything there was to be had.  Besides, even if he\r\ngot a quid, by the time you divided that up amongst a dozen--or even\r\namongst two or three--it would not be worth having.\r\n\r\nAt about eleven o\'clock Mr Sweater arrived and began to walk over the\r\nhouse, followed by Crass, who carried a pot of paint and a small brush\r\nand made believe to be \'touching up\' and finishing off parts of the\r\nwork.  As Sweater went from one room to another Crass repeatedly placed\r\nhimself in the way in the hope of being spoken to, but Sweater took no\r\nnotice of him whatever.  Once or twice Crass\'s heart began to beat\r\nquickly as he furtively watched the great man and saw him thrust his\r\nthumb and finger into his waistcoat pocket, but on each occasion\r\nSweater withdrew his hand with nothing in it.  After a while, observing\r\nthat the gentleman was about to depart without having spoken, Crass\r\ndetermined to break the ice himself.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a little better weather we\'re \'avin\' now, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Sweater.\r\n\r\n\'I was beginnin\' to be afraid as I shouldn\'t be hable to git\r\nheverything finished in time for you to move in before Christmas, sir,\'\r\nCrass continued, \'but it\'s hall done now, sir.\'\r\n\r\nSweater made no reply.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve kept the fire agoin\' in hall the rooms has you told me, sir,\'\r\nresumed Crass after a pause.  \'I think you\'ll find as the place is nice\r\nand dry, sir; the honly places as is a bit damp is the kitchen and\r\nscullery and the other rooms in the basement, sir, but of course that\'s\r\nnearly halways the case, sir, when the rooms is partly hunderground,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\n\'But of course it don\'t matter so much about the basement, sir, because\r\nit\'s honly the servants what \'as to use it, sir, and even down there\r\nit\'ll be hall right hin the summer, sir.\'\r\n\r\nOne would scarcely think, from the contemptuous way in which he spoke\r\nof \'servants\' that Crass\'s own daughter was \'in service\', but such was\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes, there\'s no doubt about that,\' replied Sweater as he moved\r\ntowards the door; \'there\'s no doubt it will be dry enough in the\r\nsummer.  Good morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good morning to YOU, sir,\' said Crass, following him.  \'I \'opes as\r\nyou\'re pleased with all the work, sir; everything satisfactory, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes.  I think it looks very nice; very nice indeed; I\'m very\r\npleased with it,\' said Sweater affably.  \'Good morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good morning, sir,\' replied the foreman with a sickly smile as Sweater\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nWhen the other was gone, Crass sat down dejectedly on the bottom step\r\nof the stairs, overwhelmed with the ruin of his hopes and expectations.\r\nHe tried to comfort himself with the reflection that all hope was not\r\nlost, because he would have to come to the house again on Monday and\r\nTuesday to fix the venetian blinds; but all the same he could not help\r\nthinking that it was only a very faint hope, for he felt that if\r\nSweater had intended giving anything he would have done so today; and\r\nit was very improbable that he would see Sweater on Monday or Tuesday\r\nat all, for the latter did not usually visit the job in the early part\r\nof the week.  However, Crass made up his mind to hope for the best,\r\nand, pulling himself together, he presently returned to the kitchen,\r\nwhere he found Slyme and Sawkins waiting for him.  He had not mentioned\r\nhis hopes of a tip to either of them, but they did not need any telling\r\nand they were both determined to have their share of whatever he got.\r\nThey eyed him keenly as he entered.\r\n\r\n\'What did \'e give yer?\' demanded Sawkins, going straight to the point.\r\n\r\n\'Give me?\' replied Crass.  \'Nothing!\'\r\n\r\nSlyme laughed in a sneering, incredulous way, but Sawkins was inclined\r\nto be abusive.  He averred that he had been watching Crass and Sweater\r\nand had seen the latter put his thumb and finger into his waistcoat\r\npocket as he walked into the dining-room, followed by Crass.  It took\r\nthe latter a long time to convince his two workmates of the truth of\r\nhis own account, but he succeeded at last, and they all three agreed\r\nthat Old Sweater was a sanguinary rotter, and they lamented over the\r\ndecay of the good old-fashioned customs.\r\n\r\n\'Why, at one time o\' day,\' said Crass, \'only a few years ago, if you\r\nwent to a gentleman\'s \'ouse to paint one or two rooms you could always\r\nbe sure of a bob or two when you\'d finished.\'\r\n\r\nBy half past twelve everything was squared up, and, having loaded up\r\nthe hand-cart with all that remained of the materials, dirty paint-pots\r\nand plant, they all set out together for the yard, to put all the\r\nthings away before going to the office for their money. Sawkins took\r\nthe handle of the cart, Slyme and Crass walked at one side and Owen and\r\nBert at the other.  There was no need to push, for the road was\r\ndownhill most of the way; so much so that they had all to help to hold\r\nback the cart, which travelled so rapidly that Bert found it difficult\r\nto keep pace with the others and frequently broke into a trot to\r\nrecover lost ground, and Crass--being fleshy and bloated with beer,\r\nbesides being unused to much exertion--began to perspire and soon\r\nappealed to the others not to let it go so fast--there was no need to\r\nget done before one o\'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 27\r\n\r\nThe March of the Imperialists\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an unusually fine day for the time of year, and as they passed\r\nalong the Grand Parade--which faced due south--they felt quite warm.\r\nThe Parade was crowded with richly dressed and bejewelled loafers,\r\nwhose countenances in many instances bore unmistakable signs of\r\ndrunkenness and gluttony.  Some of the females had tried to conceal the\r\nravages of vice and dissipation by coating their faces with powder and\r\npaint.  Mingling with and part of this crowd were a number of\r\nwell-fed-looking individuals dressed in long garments of black cloth of\r\nthe finest texture, and broad-brimmed soft felt hats.  Most of these\r\npersons had gold rings on their soft white fingers and glove-like kid\r\nor calfskin boots on their feet.  They belonged to the great army of\r\nimposters who obtain an easy living by taking advantage of the\r\nignorance and simplicity of their fellow-men, and pretending to be the\r\n\'followers\' and \'servants\' of the lowly Carpenter of Nazareth--the Man\r\nof Sorrows, who had not where to lay His head.\r\n\r\nNone of these black-garbed \'disciples\' were associating with the groups\r\nof unemployed carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, and painters who\r\nstood here and there in the carriage-way dressed in mean and shabby\r\nclothing and with faces pale with privation.  Many of these latter were\r\nknown to our friends with the cart, and nodded to them as they passed.\r\nNow and then some of them came over and walked a little distance by\r\ntheir side, inquiring whether there was any news of another job at\r\nRushton\'s.\r\n\r\nWhen they were about half-way down the Parade, just near the Fountain,\r\nCrass and his mates encountered a number of men on whose arms were\r\nwhite bands with the word \'Collector\' in black letters.  They carried\r\ncollecting boxes and accosted the people in the street, begging for\r\nmoney for the unemployed.  These men were a kind of skirmishers for the\r\nmain body, which could be seen some distance behind.\r\n\r\nAs the procession drew near, Sawkins steered the cart into the kerb and\r\nhalted as they went past.  There were about three hundred men\r\naltogether, marching four abreast.  They carried three large white\r\nbanners with black letters, \'Thanks to our Subscribers\' \'In aid of\r\nGenuine Unemployed\', \'The Children must be Fed\'.  Although there were a\r\nnumber of artisans in the procession, the majority of the men belonged\r\nto what is called the unskilled labourer class.  The skilled artisan\r\ndoes not as a rule take part in such a procession except as a very last\r\nresource...  And all the time he strives to keep up an appearance of\r\nbeing well-to-do, and would be highly indignant if anyone suggested\r\nthat he was really in a condition of abject, miserable poverty.\r\nAlthough he knows that his children are often not so well fed as are\r\nthe pet dogs and cats of his \'betters\', he tries to bluff his\r\nneighbours into thinking that he has some mysterious private means of\r\nwhich they know nothing, and conceals his poverty as if it were a\r\ncrime.  Most of this class of men would rather starve than beg.\r\nConsequently not more than a quarter of the men in the procession were\r\nskilled artisans; the majority were labourers.\r\n\r\nThere was also a sprinkling of those unfortunate outcasts of\r\nsociety--tramps and destitute, drunken loafers.  If the self-righteous\r\nhypocrites who despise these poor wretches had been subjected to the\r\nsame conditions, the majority of them would inevitably have become the\r\nsame as these.\r\n\r\nHaggard and pale, shabbily or raggedly dressed, their boots broken and\r\ndown at heel, they slouched past.  Some of them stared about with a\r\ndazed or half-wild expression, but most of them walked with downcast\r\neyes or staring blankly straight in front of them.  They appeared\r\nutterly broken-spirited, hopeless and ashamed...\r\n\r\n\'Anyone can see what THEY are,\' sneered Crass, \'there isn\'t fifty\r\ngenuine tradesmen in the whole crowd, and most of \'em wouldn\'t work if\r\nthey \'ad the offer of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just what I was thinkin\',\' agreed Sawkins with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\'There will be plenty of time to say that when they have been offered\r\nwork and have refused to do it,\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'This sort of thing does the town a lot of \'arm,\' remarked Slyme; \'it\r\noughtn\'t to be allowed; the police ought to stop it.  It\'s enough to\r\ndrive all the gentry out of the place!\'\r\n\r\n\'Bloody disgraceful, I call it,\' said Crass, \'marchin\' along the Grand\r\nParade on a beautiful day like this, just at the very time when most of\r\nthe gentry is out enjoyin\' the fresh hair.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose you think they ought to stay at home and starve quietly,\'\r\nsaid Owen.  \'I don\'t see why these men should care what harm they do to\r\nthe town; the town doesn\'t seem to care much what becomes of THEM.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you believe in this sort of thing, then?\' asked Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'No; certainly not.  I don\'t believe in begging as a favour for what\r\none is entitled to demand as a right from the thieves who have robbed\r\nthem and who are now enjoying the fruits of their labour.  From the\r\nlook of shame on their faces you might think that they were the\r\ncriminals instead of being the victims.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well you must admit that most of them is very inferior men,\' said\r\nCrass with a self-satisfied air.  \'There\'s very few mechanics amongst\r\nem.\'\r\n\r\n\'What about it if they are?  What difference does that make?\' replied\r\nOwen.  \'They\'re human beings, and they have as much right to live as\r\nanyone else.  What is called unskilled labour is just as necessary and\r\nuseful as yours or mine.  I am no more capable of doing the "unskilled"\r\nlabour that most of these men do than most of them would be capable of\r\ndoing my work.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, if they was skilled tradesmen, they might find it easier to get\r\na job,\' said Crass.\r\n\r\nOwen laughed offensively.\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean to say you think that if all these men could be\r\ntransformed into skilled carpenters, plasterers, bricklayers, and\r\npainters, that it would be easier for all those other chaps whom we\r\npassed a little while ago to get work?  Is it possible that you or any\r\nother sane man can believe anything so silly as that?\'\r\n\r\nCrass did not reply.\r\n\r\n\'If there is not enough work to employ all the mechanics whom we see\r\nstanding idle about the streets, how would it help these labourers in\r\nthe procession if they could all become skilled workmen?\'\r\n\r\nStill Crass did not answer, and neither Slyme nor Sawkins came to his\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\'If that could be done,\' continued Owen, \'it would simply make things\r\nworse for those who are already skilled mechanics.  A greater number of\r\nskilled workers--keener competition for skilled workmen\'s jobs--a\r\nlarger number of mechanics out of employment, and consequently,\r\nimproved opportunities for employers to reduce wages.  That is probably\r\nthe reason why the Liberal Party--which consists for the most part of\r\nexploiters of labour--procured the great Jim Scalds to tell us that\r\nimproved technical education is the remedy for unemployment and\r\npoverty.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose you think Jim Scalds is a bloody fool, the same as everybody\r\nelse what don\'t see things YOUR way?\' said Sawkins.\r\n\r\n\'I should think he was a fool if I thought he believed what he says.\r\nBut I don\'t think he believes it.  He says it because he thinks the\r\nmajority of the working classes are such fools that they will believe\r\nhim.  If he didn\'t think that most of us are fools he wouldn\'t tell us\r\nsuch a yarn as that.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I suppose you think as \'is opinion ain\'t far wrong,\' snarled Crass.\r\n\r\n\'We shall be better able to judge of that after the next General\r\nElection,\' replied Owen.  \'If the working classes again elect a\r\nmajority of Liberal or Tory landlords and employers to rule over them,\r\nit will prove that Jim Scalds\' estimate of their intelligence is about\r\nright.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, anyhow,\' persisted Slyme, \'I don\'t think it\'s a right thing that\r\nthey should be allowed to go marchin\' about like that--driving visitors\r\nout of the town.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you think they ought to do, then?\' demanded Owen.\r\n\r\n\'Let the b--rs go to the bloody workhouse!\' shouted Crass.\r\n\r\n\'But before they could be received there they would have to be\r\nabsolutely homeless and destitute, and then the ratepayers would have\r\nto keep them.  It costs about twelve shillings a week for each inmate,\r\nso it seems to me that it would be more sensible and economical for the\r\ncommunity to employ them on some productive work.\'\r\n\r\nThey had by this time arrived at the yard.  The steps and ladders were\r\nput away in their places and the dirty paint-pots and pails were placed\r\nin the paint-shop on the bench and on the floor.  With what had\r\npreviously been brought back there were a great many of these things,\r\nall needing to be cleaned out, so Bert at any rate stood in no danger\r\nof being out of employment for some time to come.\r\n\r\nWhen they were paid at the office, Owen on opening his envelope found\r\nit contained as usual, a time sheet for the next week, which meant that\r\nhe was not \'stood off\' although he did not know what work there would\r\nbe to do.  Crass and Slyme were both to go to the \'Cave\' to fix the\r\nvenetian blinds, and Sawkins also was to come to work as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 28\r\n\r\nThe Week before Christmas\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next week Owen painted a sign on the outer wall of one of\r\nthe workshops at the yard, and he also wrote the name of the firm on\r\nthree of the handcarts.\r\n\r\nThese and other odd jobs kept him employed a few hours every day, so\r\nthat he was not actually out of work.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon--there being nothing to do--he went home at three\r\no\'clock, but almost as soon as he reached the house Bert White came\r\nwith a coffin-plate which had to be written at once.  The lad said he\r\nhad been instructed to wait for it.\r\n\r\nNora gave the boy some tea and bread and butter to eat whilst Owen was\r\ndoing the coffin-plate, and presently Frankie--who had been playing out\r\nin the street--made his appearance.  The two boys were already known to\r\neach other, for Bert had been there several times before--on errands\r\nsimilar to the present one, or to take lessons on graining and\r\nletter-painting from Owen.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m going to have a party next Monday--after Christmas,\' remarked\r\nFrankie.  \'Mother told me I might ask you if you\'ll come?\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Bert; \'and I\'ll bring my Pandoramer.\'\r\n\r\n\'What is it?  Is it alive?\' asked Frankie with a puzzled look.\r\n\r\n\'Alive!  No, of course not,\' replied Bert with a superior air.  \'It\'s a\r\nshow, like they have at the Hippodrome or the Circus.\'\r\n\r\n\'How big is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not very big: it\'s made out of a sugar-box.  I made it myself.  It\'s\r\nnot quite finished yet, but I shall get it done this week.  There\'s a\r\nband as well, you know.  I do that part with this.\'\r\n\r\n\'This\' was a large mouth organ which he produced from the inner pocket\r\nof his coat.\r\n\r\n\'Play something now.\'\r\n\r\nBert accordingly played, and Frankie sang at the top of his voice a\r\nselection of popular songs, including \'The Old Bull and Bush\', \'Has\r\nAnyone seen a German Band?\', \'Waiting at the Church\' and\r\nfinally--possibly as a dirge for the individual whose coffin-plate Owen\r\nwas writing--\'Goodbye, Mignonette\' and \'I wouldn\'t leave my little\r\nwooden hut for you\'.\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t know what\'s in that,\' said Frankie, referring to a large\r\nearthenware bread-pan which Nora had just asked Owen to help her to\r\nlift from the floor on to one of the chairs.  The vessel in question\r\nwas covered with a clean white cloth.\r\n\r\n\'Christmas pudding,\' replied Bert, promptly.\r\n\r\n\'Guessed right first time!\' cried Frankie.  \'We got the things out of\r\nthe Christmas Club on Saturday.  We\'ve been paying in ever since last\r\nChristmas.  We\'re going to mix it now, and you can have a stir too if\r\nyou like, for luck.\'\r\n\r\nWhilst they were stirring the pudding, Frankie several times requested\r\nthe others to feel his muscle: he said he felt sure that he would soon\r\nbe strong enough to go out to work, and he explained to Bert that the\r\nextraordinary strength he possessed was to be attributed to the fact\r\nthat he lived almost exclusively on porridge and milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the week, Owen continued to work down at the yard with\r\nSawkins, Crass, and Slyme, painting some of the ladders, steps and\r\nother plant belonging to the firm.  These things had to have two coats\r\nof paint and the name Rushton & Co. written on them.  As soon as they\r\nhad got some of them second-coated, Owen went on with the writing,\r\nleaving the painting for the others, so as to share the work as fairly\r\nas possible.  Several times during the week one or other of them was\r\ntaken away to do some other work; once Crass and Slyme had to go and\r\nwash off and whiten a ceiling somewhere, and several times Sawkins was\r\nsent out to assist the plumbers.\r\n\r\nEvery day some of the men who had been \'stood off\' called at the yard\r\nto ask if any other \'jobs\' had \'come in\'.  From these callers they\r\nheard all the news.  Old Jack Linden had not succeeded in getting\r\nanything to do at the trade since he was discharged from Rushton\'s, and\r\nit was reported that he was trying to earn a little money by hawking\r\nbloaters from house to house.  As for Philpot, he said that he had been\r\nround to nearly all the firms in the town and none of them had any work\r\nto speak of.\r\n\r\nNewman--the man whom the reader will remember was sacked for taking too\r\nmuch pains with his work--had been arrested and sentenced to a month\'s\r\nimprisonment because he had not been able to pay his poor rates, and\r\nthe Board of Guardians were allowing his wife three shillings a week to\r\nmaintain herself and the three children.  Philpot had been to see them,\r\nand she told him that the landlord was threatening to turn them into\r\nthe street; he would have seized their furniture and sold it if it had\r\nbeen worth the expense of the doing.\r\n\r\n\'I feel ashamed of meself,\' Philpot added in confidence to Owen, \'when\r\nI think of all the money I chuck away on beer.  If it wasn\'t for that,\r\nI shouldn\'t be in such a hole meself now, and I might be able to lend\r\n\'em a \'elpin\' \'and.\'\r\n\r\n\'It ain\'t so much that I likes the beer, you know,\' he continued; \'it\'s\r\nthe company.  When you ain\'t got no \'ome, in a manner o\' speakin\', like\r\nme, the pub\'s about the only place where you can get a little\r\nenjoyment.  But you ain\'t very welcome there unless you spends your\r\nmoney.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is the three shillings all they have to live on?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think she goes out charin\' when she can get it,\' replied Philpot,\r\n\'but I don\'t see as she can do a great deal o\' that with three young\r\n\'uns to look after, and from what I hear of it she\'s only just got over\r\na illness and ain\'t fit to do much.\'\r\n\r\n\'My God!\' said Owen.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tell you what,\' said Philpot.  \'I\'ve been thinking we might get\r\nup a bit of a subscription for \'em.  There\'s several chaps in work what\r\nknows Newman, and if they was each to give a trifle we could get enough\r\nto pay for a Christmas dinner, anyway.  I\'ve brought a sheet of\r\nfoolscap with me, and I was goin\' to ask you to write out the heading\r\nfor me.\'\r\n\r\nAs there was no pen available at the workshop, Philpot waited till four\r\no\'clock and then accompanied Owen home, where the heading of the list\r\nwas written.  Owen put his name down for a shilling and Philpot his for\r\na similar amount.\r\n\r\nPhilpot stayed to tea and accepted an invitation to spend Christmas Day\r\nwith them, and to come to Frankie\'s party on the Monday after.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Philpot brought the list to the yard and Crass and\r\nSlyme put their names down for a shilling each, and Sawkins for\r\nthreepence, it being arranged that the money was to be paid on\r\npayday--Christmas Eve.  In the meantime, Philpot was to see as many as\r\nhe could of those who were in work, at other firms and get as many\r\nsubscriptions as possible.\r\n\r\nAt pay-time on Christmas Eve Philpot turned up with the list and Owen\r\nand the others paid him the amounts they had put their names down for.\r\nFrom other men he had succeeded in obtaining nine and sixpence, mostly\r\nin sixpences and threepences.  Some of this money he had already\r\nreceived, but for the most part he had made appointments with the\r\nsubscribers to call at their homes that evening.  It was decided that\r\nOwen should accompany him and also go with him to hand over the money\r\nto Mrs Newman.\r\n\r\nIt took them nearly three hours to get in all the money, for the places\r\nthey had to go to were in different localities, and in one or two cases\r\nthey had to wait because their man had not yet come home, and sometimes\r\nit was not possible to get away without wasting a little time in talk.\r\nIn three instances those who had put their names down for threepence\r\nincreased the amount to sixpence and one who had promised sixpence gave\r\na shilling.  There were two items of threepence each which they did not\r\nget at all, the individuals who had put their names down having gone\r\nupon the drunk.  Another cause of delay was that they met or called on\r\nseveral other men who had not yet been asked for a subscription, and\r\nthere were several others--including some members of the Painters\r\nSociety whom Owen had spoken to during the week--who had promised him\r\nto give a subscription.  In the end they succeeded in increasing the\r\ntotal amount to nineteen and ninepence, and they then put\r\nthree-halfpence each to make it up to a pound.\r\n\r\nThe Newmans lived in a small house the rent of which was six shillings\r\nper week and taxes.  To reach the house one had to go down a dark and\r\nnarrow passage between two shops, the house being in a kind of well,\r\nsurrounded by the high walls of the back parts of larger\r\nbuildings--chiefly business premises and offices.  The air did not\r\ncirculate very freely in this place, and the rays of the sun never\r\nreached it.  In the summer the atmosphere was close and foul with the\r\nvarious odours which came from the back-yards of the adjoining\r\nbuildings, and in the winter it was dark and damp and gloomy, a\r\nculture-ground for bacteria and microbes.  The majority of those who\r\nprofess to be desirous of preventing and curing the disease called\r\nconsumption must be either hypocrites or fools, for they ridicule the\r\nsuggestion that it is necessary first to cure and prevent the poverty\r\nthat compels badly clothed and half-starved human beings to sleep in\r\nsuch dens as this.\r\n\r\nThe front door opened into the living-room or, rather, kitchen, which\r\nwas dimly lighted by a small paraffin lamp on the table, where were\r\nalso some tea-cups and saucers, each of a different pattern, and the\r\nremains of a loaf of bread.  The wallpaper was old and discoloured; a\r\nfew almanacs and unframed prints were fixed to the walls, and on the\r\nmantelshelf were some cracked and worthless vases and ornaments.  At\r\none time they had possessed a clock and an overmantel and some framed\r\npictures, but they had all been sold to obtain money to buy food.\r\nNearly everything of any value had been parted with for the same\r\nreason--the furniture, the pictures, the bedclothes, the carpet and the\r\noilcloth, piece by piece, nearly everything that had once constituted\r\nthe home--had been either pawned or sold to buy food or to pay rent\r\nduring the times when Newman was out of work--periods that had recurred\r\nduring the last few years with constantly increasing frequency and\r\nduration.  Now there was nothing left but these few old broken chairs\r\nand the deal table which no one would buy; and upstairs, the wretched\r\nbedsteads and mattresses whereon they slept at night, covering\r\nthemselves with worn-out remnants of blankets and the clothes they wore\r\nduring the day.\r\n\r\nIn answer to Philpot\'s knock, the door was opened by a little girl\r\nabout seven years old, who at once recognized Philpot, and called out\r\nhis name to her mother, and the latter came also to the door, closely\r\nfollowed by two other children, a little, fragile-looking girl about\r\nthree, and a boy about five years of age, who held on to her skirt and\r\npeered curiously at the visitors.  Mrs Newman was about thirty, and her\r\nappearance confirmed the statement of Philpot that she had only just\r\nrecovered from an illness; she was very white and thin and\r\ndejected-looking.  When Philpot explained the object of their visit and\r\nhanded her the money, the poor woman burst into tears, and the two\r\nsmaller children--thinking that this piece of paper betokened some\r\nfresh calamity--began to cry also.  They remembered that all their\r\ntroubles had been preceded by the visits of men who brought pieces of\r\npaper, and it was rather difficult to reassure them.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after Frankie was asleep, Owen and Nora went out to do\r\ntheir Christmas marketing.  They had not much money to spend, for Owen\r\nhad brought home only seventeen shillings.  He had worked thirty-three\r\nhours--that came to nineteen and threepence--one shilling and\r\nthreehalfpence had gone on the subscription list, and he had given the\r\nrest of the coppers to a ragged wreck of a man who was singing a hymn\r\nin the street.  The other shilling had been deducted from his wages in\r\nrepayment of a \'sub\' he had had during the week.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal to be done with this seventeen shillings. First\r\nof all there was the rent--seven shillings--that left ten. Then there\r\nwas the week\'s bread bill--one and threepence.  They had a pint of milk\r\nevery day, chiefly for the boy\'s sake--that came to one and two.  Then\r\nthere was one and eight for a hundredweight of coal that had been\r\nbought on credit.  Fortunately, there were no groceries to buy, for the\r\nthings they had obtained with their Christmas Club money would be more\r\nthan sufficient for the ensuing week.\r\n\r\nFrankie\'s stockings were all broken and beyond mending, so it was\r\npositively necessary to buy him another pair for fivepence\r\nthree-farthings.  These stockings were not much good--a pair at double\r\nthe price would have been much cheaper, for they would have lasted\r\nthree or four times longer; but they could not afford to buy the dearer\r\nkind.  It was just the same with the coal: if they had been able to\r\nafford it, they could have bought a ton of the same class of coal for\r\ntwenty-six shillings, but buying it as they did, by the hundredweight,\r\nthey had to pay at the rate of thirty-three shillings and fourpence a\r\nton.  It was just the same with nearly everything else.  This is how\r\nthe working classes are robbed.  Although their incomes are the lowest,\r\nthey are compelled to buy the most expensive articles--that is, the\r\nlowest-priced articles.  Everybody knows that good clothes, boots or\r\nfurniture are really the cheapest in the end, although they cost more\r\nmoney at first; but the working classes can seldom or never afford to\r\nbuy good things; they have to buy cheap rubbish which is dear at any\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nSix weeks previously Owen bought a pair of second-hand boots for three\r\nshillings and they were now literally falling to pieces.  Nora\'s shoes\r\nwere in much the same condition, but, as she said, it did not matter so\r\nmuch about hers because there was no need for her to go out if the\r\nweather were not fine.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the articles already mentioned, they had to spend\r\nfourpence for half a gallon of paraffin oil, and to put sixpence into\r\nthe slot of the gas-stove.  This reduced the money to five and\r\nsevenpence farthing, and of this it was necessary to spend a shilling\r\non potatoes and other vegetables.\r\n\r\nThey both needed some new underclothing, for what they had was so old\r\nand worn that it was quite useless for the purpose it was supposed to\r\nserve; but there was no use thinking of these things, for they had now\r\nonly four shillings and sevenpence farthing left, and all that would be\r\nneeded for toys.  They had to buy something special for Frankie for\r\nChristmas, and it would also be necessary to buy something for each of\r\nthe children who were coming to the party on the following Monday.\r\nFortunately, there was no meat to buy, for Nora had been paying into\r\nthe Christmas Club at the butcher\'s as well as at the grocer\'s.  So\r\nthis necessary was already paid for.\r\n\r\nThey stopped to look at the display of toys at Sweater\'s Emporium. For\r\nseveral days past Frankie had been talking of the wonders contained in\r\nthese windows, so they wished if possible to buy him something here.\r\nThey recognized many of the things from the description the boy had\r\ngiven of them, but nearly everything was so dear that for a long time\r\nthey looked in vain for something it would be possible to buy.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the engine he talks so much about,\' said Non, indicating a\r\nmodel railway locomotive; that one marked five shillings.\'\r\n\r\n\'It might just as well be marked five pounds as far as we\'re\r\nconcerned,\' replied Owen.\r\n\r\nAs they were speaking, one of the salesmen appeared at the back of the\r\nwindow and, reaching forward, removed the engine.  It was probably the\r\nlast one of the kind and had evidently just been sold.  Owen and Nora\r\nexperienced a certain amount of consolation in knowing that even if\r\nthey had the money they would not have been able to buy it.\r\n\r\nAfter lengthy consideration, they decided on a clockwork engine at a\r\nshilling, but the other toys they resolved to buy at a cheaper shop.\r\nNora went into the Emporium to get the toy and whilst Owen was waiting\r\nfor her Mr and Mrs Rushton came out.  They did not appear to see Owen,\r\nwho observed that the shape of one of several parcels they carried\r\nsuggested that it contained the engine that had been taken from the\r\nwindow a little while before.\r\n\r\nWhen Nora returned with her purchase, they went in search of a cheaper\r\nplace and after a time they found what they wanted.  For sixpence they\r\nbought a cardboard box that had come all the way from Japan and\r\ncontained a whole family of dolls--father, mother and four children of\r\ndifferent sizes.  A box of paints, threepence: a sixpenny tea service,\r\na threepenny drawing slate, and a rag doll, sixpence.\r\n\r\nOn their way home they called at a greengrocer\'s where Owen had ordered\r\nand paid for a small Christmas tree a few weeks before; and as they\r\nwere turning the corner of the street where they lived they met Crass,\r\nhalf-drunk, with a fine fat goose slung over his shoulder by its neck.\r\nHe greeted Owen jovially and held up the bird for their inspection.\r\n\r\n\'Not a bad tanner\'s-worth, eh?\' he hiccoughed.  \'This makes two we\'ve\r\ngot.  I won this and a box of cigars--fifty--for a tanner, and the\r\nother one I got out of the Club at our Church Mission \'all: threepence\r\na week for twenty-eight weeks; that makes seven bob.  But,\' he added,\r\nconfidentially,\'\'you couldn\'t buy \'em for that price in a shop, you\r\nknow.  They costs the committee a good bit more nor that--wholesale;\r\nbut we\'ve got some rich gents on our committee and they makes up the\r\ndifference,\' and with a nod and a cunning leer he lurched off.\r\n\r\nFrankie was sleeping soundly when they reached home, and so was the\r\nkitten, which was curled up on the quilt on the foot of the bed. After\r\nthey had had some supper, although it was after eleven o\'clock, Owen\r\nfixed the tree in a large flower-pot that had served a similar purpose\r\nbefore, and Nora brought out from the place where it had been stored\r\naway since last Christmas a cardboard box containing a lot of\r\nglittering tinsel ornaments--globes of silvered or gilded or painted\r\nglass, birds, butterflies and stars.  Some of these things had done\r\nduty three Christmases ago and although they were in some instances\r\nslightly tarnished most of them were as good as new.  In addition to\r\nthese and the toys they had bought that evening they had a box of\r\nbon-bons and a box of small coloured wax candles, both of which had\r\nformed part of the things they got from the grocer\'s with the Christmas\r\nClub money; and there were also a lot of little coloured paper bags of\r\nsweets, and a number of sugar and chocolate toys and animals which had\r\nbeen bought two or three at a time for several weeks past and put away\r\nfor this occasion.  There was something suitable for each child that\r\nwas coming, with the exception of Bert White; they had intended to\r\ninclude a sixpenny pocket knife for him in their purchases that\r\nevening, but as they had not been able to afford this Owen decided to\r\ngive him an old set of steel graining combs which he knew the lad had\r\noften longed to possess.  The tin case containing these tools was\r\naccordingly wrapped in some red tissue paper and hung on the tree with\r\nthe other things.\r\n\r\nThey moved about as quietly as possible so as not to disturb those who\r\nwere sleeping in the rooms beneath, because long before they were\r\nfinished the people in the other parts of the house had all retired to\r\nrest, and silence had fallen on the deserted streets outside.  As they\r\nwere putting the final touches to their work the profound stillness of\r\nthe night was suddenly broken by the voices of a band of carol-singers.\r\n\r\nThe sound overwhelmed them with memories of other and happier times,\r\nand Nora stretched out her hands impulsively to Owen, who drew her\r\nclose to his side.\r\n\r\nThey had been married just over eight years, and although during all\r\nthat time they had never been really free from anxiety for the future,\r\nyet on no previous Christmas had they been quite so poor as now. During\r\nthe last few years periods of unemployment had gradually become more\r\nfrequent and protracted, and the attempt he had made in the early part\r\nof the year to get work elsewhere had only resulted in plunging them\r\ninto even greater poverty than before.  But all the same there was much\r\nto be thankful for: poor though they were, they were far better off\r\nthan many thousands of others: they still had food and shelter, and\r\nthey had each other and the boy.\r\n\r\nBefore they went to bed Owen carried the tree into Frankie\'s bedroom\r\nand placed it so that he would be able to see it in all its glittering\r\nglory as soon as he awoke on Christmas morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 29\r\n\r\nThe Pandorama\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the party was not supposed to begin till six o\'clock, Bert\r\nturned up at half past four, bringing the \'Pandoramer\' with him.\r\n\r\nAt about half past five the other guests began to arrive.  Elsie and\r\nCharley Linden came first, the girl in a pretty blue frock trimmed with\r\nwhite lace, and Charley resplendent in a new suit, which, like his\r\nsister\'s dress, had been made out of somebody\'s cast-off clothes that\r\nhad been given to their mother by a visiting lady.  It had taken Mrs\r\nLinden many hours of hard work to contrive these garments; in fact,\r\nmore time than the things were worth, for although they looked all\r\nright--especially Elsie\'s--the stuff was so old that it would not wear\r\nvery long: but this was the only way in which she could get clothes for\r\nthe children at all: she certainly could not afford to buy them any.\r\nSo she spent hours and hours making things that she knew would fall to\r\npieces almost as soon as they were made.\r\n\r\nAfter these came Nellie, Rosie and Tommy Newman.  These presented a\r\nmuch less prosperous appearance than the other two.  Their mother was\r\nnot so skilful at contriving new clothes out of old.  Nellie was\r\nwearing a grown-up woman\'s blouse, and by way of ulster she had on an\r\nold-fashioned jacket of thick cloth with large pearl buttons.  This was\r\nalso a grown-up woman\'s garment: it was shaped to fit the figure of a\r\ntall woman with wide shoulders and a small waist; consequently, it did\r\nnot fit Nellie to perfection.  The waist reached below the poor child\'s\r\nhips.\r\n\r\nTommy was arrayed in the patched remains of what had once been a good\r\nsuit of clothes.  They had been purchased at a second-hand shop last\r\nsummer and had been his \'best\' for several months, but they were now\r\nmuch too small for him.\r\n\r\nLittle Rosie--who was only just over three years old--was better off\r\nthan either of the other two, for she had a red cloth dress that fitted\r\nher perfectly: indeed, as the district visitor who gave it to her\r\nmother had remarked, it looked as if it had been made for her.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not much to look at,\' observed Nellie, referring to her big\r\njacket, but all the same we was very glad of it when the rain came on.\'\r\n\r\nThe coat was so big that by withdrawing her arms from the sleeves and\r\nusing it as a cloak or shawl she had managed to make it do for all\r\nthree of them.\r\n\r\nTommy\'s boots were so broken that the wet had got in and saturated his\r\nstockings, so Nora made him take them all off and wear some old ones of\r\nFrankie\'s whilst his own were drying at the fire.\r\n\r\nPhilpot, with two large paper bags full of oranges and nuts, arrived\r\njust as they were sitting down to tea--or rather cocoa--for with the\r\nexception of Bert all the children expressed a preference for the\r\nlatter beverage.  Bert would have liked to have cocoa also, but hearing\r\nthat the grown-ups were going to have tea, he thought it would be more\r\nmanly to do the same.  This question of having tea or cocoa for tea\r\nbecame a cause of much uproarious merriment on the part of the\r\nchildren, who asked each other repeatedly which they liked best, \'tea\r\ntea?\' or \'cocoa tea?\'  They thought it so funny that they said it over\r\nand over again, screaming with laughter all the while, until Tommy got\r\na piece of cake stuck in his throat and became nearly black in the\r\nface, and then Philpot had to turn him upside down and punch him in the\r\nback to save him from choking to death.  This rather sobered the\r\nothers, but for some time afterwards whenever they looked at each other\r\nthey began to laugh afresh because they thought it was such a good joke.\r\n\r\nWhen they had filled themselves up with the \'cocoa-tea\' and cakes and\r\nbread and jam, Elsie Linden and Nellie Newman helped to clear away the\r\ncups and saucers, and then Owen lit the candles on the Christmas tree\r\nand distributed the toys to the children, and a little while afterwards\r\nPhilpot--who had got a funny-looking mask out of one of the\r\nbon-bons--started a fine game pretending to be a dreadful wild animal\r\nwhich he called a Pandroculus, and crawling about on all fours, rolled\r\nhis goggle eyes and growled out he must have a little boy or girl to\r\neat for his supper.\r\n\r\nHe looked so terrible that although they knew it was only a joke they\r\nwere almost afraid of him, and ran away laughing and screaming to\r\nshelter themselves behind Nora or Owen; but all the same, whenever\r\nPhilpot left off playing, they entreated him to \'be it again\', and so\r\nhe had to keep on being a Pandroculus, until exhaustion compelled him\r\nto return to his natural form.\r\n\r\nAfter this they all sat round the table and had a game of cards;\r\n\'Snap\', they called it, but nobody paid much attention to the rules of\r\nthe game: everyone seemed to think that the principal thing to do was\r\nto kick up as much row as possible.  After a while Philpot suggested a\r\nchange to \'Beggar my neighbour\', and won quite a lot of cards before\r\nthey found out that he had hidden all the jacks in the pocket of his\r\ncoat, and then they mobbed him for a cheat.  He might have been\r\nseriously injured if it had not been for Bert, who created a diversion\r\nby standing on a chair and announcing that he was about to introduce to\r\ntheir notice \'Bert White\'s World-famed Pandorama\' as exhibited before\r\nall the nobility and crowned heads of Europe, England, Ireland and\r\nScotland, including North America and Wales.\r\n\r\nLoud cheers greeted the conclusion of Bert\'s speech.  The box was\r\nplaced on the table, which was then moved to the end of the room, and\r\nthe chairs were ranged in two rows in front.\r\n\r\nThe \'Pandorama\' consisted of a stage-front made of painted cardboard\r\nand fixed on the front of a wooden box about three feet long by two\r\nfeet six inches high, and about one foot deep from back to front.  The\r\n\'Show\' was a lot of pictures cut out of illustrated weekly papers and\r\npasted together, end to end, so as to form a long strip or ribbon. Bert\r\nhad coloured all the pictures with water-colours.\r\n\r\nJust behind the wings of the stage-front at each end of the box--was an\r\nupright roller, and the long strip of pictures was rolled up on this.\r\nThe upper ends of the rollers came through the top of the box and had\r\nhandles attached to them.  When these handles were turned the pictures\r\npassed across the stage, unrolling from one roller and rolling on to\r\nthe other, and were illuminated by the light of three candles placed\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe idea of constructing this machine had been suggested to Bert by a\r\npanorama entertainment he had been to see some time before.\r\n\r\n\'The Style of the decorations,\' he remarked, alluding to the painted\r\nstage-front, \'is Moorish.\'\r\n\r\nHe lit the candles at the back of the stage and, having borrowed a\r\ntea-tray from Nora, desired the audience to take their seats.  When\r\nthey had all done so, he requested Owen to put out the lamp and the\r\ncandles on the tree, and then he made another speech, imitating the\r\nmanner of the lecturer at the panorama entertainment before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\'Ladies and Gentlemen: with your kind permission I am about to\r\nhinterduce to your notice some pitchers of events in different parts of\r\nthe world.  As each pitcher appears on the stage I will give a short\r\nexplanation of the subject, and afterwards the band will play a\r\nsuitable collection of appropriated music, consisting of hymns and all\r\nthe latest and most popular songs of the day, and the audience is\r\nkindly requested to join in the chorus.\r\n\r\n\'Our first scene,\' continued Bert as he turned the handles and brought\r\nthe picture into view, \'represents the docks at Southampton; the\r\nmagnificent steamer which you see lying alongside the shore is the ship\r\nwhich is waiting to take us to foreign parts.  As we have already paid\r\nour fare, we will now go on board and set sail.\'\r\n\r\nAs an accompaniment to this picture Bert played the tune of \'Goodbye,\r\nDolly, I must leave you\', and by the time the audience had  finished\r\nsinging the chorus he had rolled on another scene, which depicted a\r\ndreadful storm at sea, with a large ship evidently on the point of\r\nfoundering.  The waves were running mountains high and the inky clouds\r\nwere riven by forked lightning.  To increase the terrifying effect,\r\nBert rattled the tea tray and played \'The Bay of Biscay\', and the\r\nchildren sung the chorus whilst he rolled the next picture into view.\r\nThis scene showed the streets of a large city; mounted police with\r\ndrawn swords were dispersing a crowd: several men had been ridden down\r\nand were being trampled under the hoofs of the horses, and a number of\r\nothers were bleeding profusely from wounds on the head and face.\r\n\r\n\'After a rather stormy passage we arrives safely at the beautiful city\r\nof Berlin, in Germany, just in time to see a procession of unemployed\r\nworkmen being charged by the military police.  This picture is\r\nhintitled "Tariff Reform means Work for All".\'\r\n\r\nAs an appropriate musical selection Bert played the tune of a\r\nwell-known song, and the children sang the words:\r\n\r\n        \'To be there! to be there!\r\n        Oh, I knew what it was to be there!\r\n        And when they tore me clothes,\r\n        Blacked me eyes and broke me nose,\r\n        Then I knew what it was to be there!\'\r\n\r\nDuring the singing Bert turned the handles backwards and again brought\r\non the picture of the storm at sea.\r\n\r\n\'As we don\'t want to get knocked on the \'ed, we clears out of Berlin as\r\nsoon as we can--whiles we\'re safe--and once more embarks on our gallint\r\nship\' and after a few more turns of the \'andle we finds ourselves back\r\nonce more in Merry Hingland, where we see the inside of a blacksmith\'s\r\nshop with a lot of half-starved women making iron chains.  They work\r\nseventy hours a week for seven shillings.  Our next scene is hintitled\r\n"The Hook and Eye Carders".  \'Ere we see the inside of a room in\r\nSlumtown, with a mother and three children and the old grandmother\r\nsewin\' hooks and eyes on cards to be sold in drapers\' shops.  It ses\r\nunderneath the pitcher that 384 hooks and 384 eyes has to be joined\r\ntogether and sewed on cards for one penny.\'\r\n\r\nWhile this picture was being rolled away the band played and the\r\nchildren sang with great enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n        \'Rule, Brittania, Brittania rules the waves!\r\n        Britons, never, never, never shall be slaves!\'\r\n\r\n\'Our next picture is called "An Englishman\'s Home".  \'Ere we see the\r\ninside of another room in Slumtown, with the father and mother and four\r\nchildren sitting down to dinner--bread and drippin\' and tea.  It ses\r\nunderneath the pitcher that there\'s Thirteen millions of people in\r\nEngland always on the verge of starvation.  These people that you see\r\nin the pitcher might be able to get a better dinner than this if it\r\nwasn\'t that most of the money wot the bloke earns \'as to pay the rent.\r\nAgain we turns the \'andle and presently we comes to another very\r\nbeautiful scene--"Early Morning in Trafalgar Square".  \'Ere we see a\r\nlot of Englishmen who have been sleepin\' out all night because they\r\nain\'t got no \'omes to go to.\'\r\n\r\nAs a suitable selection for this picture, Bert played the tune of a\r\nmusic-hall song, the words of which were familiar to all the\r\nyoungsters, who sang at the top of their voices:\r\n\r\n        \'I live in Trafalgar Square,\r\n        With four lions to guard me,\r\n        Pictures and statues all over the place,\r\n        Lord Nelson staring me straight in the face,\r\n        Of course it\'s rather draughty,\r\n        But still I\'m sure you\'ll agree,\r\n        If it\'s good enough for Lord Nelson,\r\n        It\'s quite good enough for me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Next we \'ave a view of the dining-hall at the Topside Hotel in London,\r\nwhere we see the tables set for a millionaires\' banquet.  The forks and\r\nspoons is made of solid gold and the plates is made of silver.  The\r\nflowers that you see on the tables and \'angin\' down from the ceilin\'\r\nand on the walls is worth L2,000 and it cost the bloke wot give the\r\nsupper over L30,000 for this one beano.  A few more turns of the \'andle\r\nshows us another glorious banquet--the King of Rhineland being\r\nentertained by the people of England.  Next we finds ourselves looking\r\non at the Lord Mayor\'s supper at the Mansion House.  All the fat men\r\nthat you see sittin\' at the tables is Liberal and Tory Members of\r\nParlimint.  After this we \'ave a very beautiful pitcher hintitled "Four\r\nfooted Haristocrats".  \'Ere you see Lady Slumrent\'s pet dogs sittin\' up\r\non chairs at their dinner table with white linen napkins tied round\r\ntheir necks, eatin\' orf silver plates like human people and being\r\nwaited on by real live waiters in hevening dress.  Lady Slumrent is\r\nvery fond of her pretty pets and she does not allow them to be fed on\r\nanything but the very best food; they gets chicken, rump steak, mutton\r\nchops, rice pudding, jelly and custard.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wished I was a pet dog, don\'t you?\' remarked Tommy Newman to Charley\r\nLinden.\r\n\r\n\'Not arf!\' replied Charley.\r\n\r\n\'Here we see another unemployed procession,\' continued Bert as he\r\nrolled another picture into sight; \'2,000 able-bodied men who are not\r\nallowed to work.  Next we see the hinterior of a Hindustrial\r\n\'Ome--Blind children and cripples working for their living.  Our next\r\nscene is called "Cheap Labour".  \'Ere we see a lot of small boys about\r\ntwelve and thirteen years old bein\' served out with their Labour\r\nStifficats, which gives \'em the right to go to work and earn money to\r\nhelp their unemployed fathers to pay the slum rent.\r\n\r\n\'Once more we turns the \'andle and brings on one of our finest scenes.\r\nThis lovely pitcher is hintitled "The Hangel of Charity", and shows us\r\nthe beautiful Lady Slumrent seated at the table in a cosy corner of \'er\r\ncharmin\' boodore, writin\' out a little cheque for the relief of the\r\npoor of Slumtown.\r\n\r\n\'Our next scene is called "The Rival Candidates, or, a Scene during the\r\nGeneral Election".  On the left you will observe, standin\' up in a\r\nmotor car, a swell bloke with a eyeglass stuck in one eye, and a\r\novercoat with a big fur collar and cuffs, addressing the crowd: this is\r\nthe Honourable Augustus Slumrent, the Conservative candidate.  On the\r\nother side of the road we see another motor car and another swell bloke\r\nwith a round pane of glass in one eye and a overcoat with a big fur\r\ncollar and cuffs, standing up in the car and addressin\' the crowd. This\r\nis Mr Mandriver, the Liberal candidate.  The crowds of shabby-lookin\'\r\nchaps standin\' round the motor cars wavin\' their \'ats and cheerin\' is\r\nworkin\' men.  Both the candidates is tellin\' \'em the same old story,\r\nand each of \'em is askin\' the workin\' men to elect \'im to Parlimint,\r\nand promisin\' to do something or other to make things better for the\r\nlower horders.\'\r\n\r\nAs an appropriate selection to go with this picture, Bert played the\r\ntune of a popular song, the words being well known to the children, who\r\nsang enthusiastically, clapping their hands and stamping their feet on\r\nthe floor in time with the music:\r\n\r\n        \'We\'ve both been there before,\r\n        Many a time, many a time!\r\n        We\'ve both been there before,\r\n        Many a time!\r\n        Where many a gallon of beer has gone.\r\n        To colour his nose and mine,\r\n        We\'ve both been there before,\r\n        Many a time, many a time!\'\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the singing, Bert turned another picture into view.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere we \'ave another election scene.  At each side we see the two\r\ncandidates the same as in the last pitcher.  In the middle of the road\r\nwe see a man lying on the ground, covered with blood, with a lot of\r\nLiberal and Tory working men kickin\' \'im, jumpin\' on \'im, and stampin\'\r\non \'is face with their \'obnailed boots.  The bloke on the ground is a\r\nSocialist, and the reason why they\'re kickin\' \'is face in is because \'e\r\nsaid that the only difference between Slumrent and Mandriver was that\r\nthey was both alike.\'\r\n\r\nWhile the audience were admiring this picture, Bert played another\r\nwell-known tune, and the children sang the words:\r\n\r\n        \'Two lovely black eyes,\r\n        Oh what a surprise!\r\n        Only for telling a man he was wrong,\r\n        Two lovely black eyes.\'\r\n\r\nBert continued to turn the handles of the rollers and a long succession\r\nof pictures passed across the stage, to the delight of the children,\r\nwho cheered and sang as occasion demanded, but the most enthusiastic\r\noutburst of all greeted the appearance of the final picture, which was\r\na portrait of the King.  Directly the children saw it--without waiting\r\nfor the band--they gave three cheers and began to sing the chorus of\r\nthe National Anthem.\r\n\r\nA round of applause for Bert concluded the Pandorama performance; the\r\nlamp and the candles of the Christmas tree were relit--for although all\r\nthe toys had been taken off, the tree still made a fine show with the\r\nshining glass ornaments--and then they had some more games; blind man\'s\r\nbuff, a tug-of-war--in which Philpot was defeated with great\r\nlaughter--and a lot of other games.  And when they were tired of these,\r\neach child \'said a piece\' or sung a song, learnt specially for the\r\noccasion.  The only one who had not come prepared in this respect was\r\nlittle Rosie, and even she--so as to be the same as the\r\nothers--insisted on reciting the only piece she knew.  Kneeling on the\r\nhearthrug, she put her hands together, palm to palm, and shutting her\r\neyes very tightly she repeated the verse she always said every night\r\nbefore going to bed:\r\n\r\n        \'Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,\r\n        Look on me, a little child.\r\n        Pity my simplicity,\r\n        Suffer me to come to Thee.\'\r\n\r\nThen she stood up and kissed everyone in turn, and Philpot crossed over\r\nand began looking out of the window, and coughed, and blew his nose,\r\nbecause a nut that he had been eating had gone down the wrong way.\r\n\r\nMost of them were by this time quite tired out, so after some supper\r\nthe party broke up.  Although they were nearly all very sleepy, none of\r\nthem were very willing to go, but they were consoled by the thought of\r\nanother entertainment to which they were going later on in the\r\nweek--the Band of Hope Tea and Prize Distribution at the Shining Light\r\nChapel.\r\n\r\nBert undertook to see Elsie and Charley safely home, and Philpot\r\nvolunteered to accompany Nellie and Tommy Newman, and to carry Rosie,\r\nwho was so tired that she fell asleep on his shoulder before they left\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nAs they were going down the stairs Frankie held a hurried consultation\r\nwith his mother, with the result that he was able to shout after them\r\nan invitation to come again next Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 30\r\n\r\nThe Brigands hold a Council of War\r\n\r\n\r\nIt being now what is usually called the festive season--possibly\r\nbecause at this period of the year a greater number of people are\r\nsuffering from hunger and cold than at any other time--the reader will\r\nnot be surprised at being invited to another little party which took\r\nplace on the day after the one we have just left.  The scene was Mr\r\nSweater\'s office.  Mr Sweater was seated at his desk, but with his\r\nchair swung round to enable him to face his guests--Messrs Rushton,\r\nDidlum, and Grinder, who were also seated.\r\n\r\n\'Something will \'ave to be done, and that very soon,\' Grinder was\r\nsaying.  \'We can\'t go on much longer as we\'re doing at present.  For my\r\npart, I think the best thing to do is to chuck up the sponge at once;\r\nthe company is practically bankrupt now, and the longer we waits the\r\nworser it will be.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just my opinion,\' said Didlum dejectedly.  \'If we could supply\r\nthe electric light at the same price as gas, or a little cheaper, we\r\nmight have some chance; but we can\'t do it.  The fact is that the\r\nmachinery we\'ve got is no dam good; it\'s too small and it\'s wore out,\r\nconsequently the light we supply is inferior to gas and costs more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think we\'re fairly beaten this time,\' said Rushton.  \'Why, even\r\nif the Gas Coy hadn\'t moved their works beyond the borough boundary,\r\nstill we shouldn\'t \'ave been hable to compete with \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course not,\' said Grinder.  \'The truth of the matter is just wot\r\nDidlum says.  Our machinery is too small, it\'s worn hout, and good for\r\nnothing but to be throwed on the scrap-heap.  So there\'s only one thing\r\nleft to do and that is--go into liquidation.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see it,\' remarked Sweater.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what do you propose, then?\' demanded Grinder.  \'Reconstruct the\r\ncompany?  Ask the shareholders for more money?  Pull down the works and\r\nbuild fresh, and buy some new machinery?  And then most likely not make\r\na do of it after all?  Not for me, old chap!  I\'ve \'ad enough. You\r\nwon\'t catch me chuckin\' good money after bad in that way.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor me neither,\' said Rushton.\r\n\r\n\'Dead orf!\' remarked Didlum, very decidedly.\r\n\r\nSweater laughed quietly.  \'I\'m not such a fool as to suggest anything\r\nof that sort,\' he said.  \'You seem to forget that I am one of the\r\nlargest shareholders myself.  No.  What I propose is that we Sell Out.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sell out!\' replied Grinder with a contemptuous laugh in which the\r\nothers joined.  \'Who\'s going to buy the shares of a concern that\'s\r\npractically bankrupt and never paid a dividend?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve tried to sell my little lot several times already,\' said Didlum\r\nwith a sickly smile, \'but nobody won\'t buy \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who\'s to buy?\' repeated Sweater, replying to Grinder.  \'The\r\nmunicipality of course!  The ratepayers.  Why shouldn\'t Mugsborough go\r\nin for Socialism as well as other towns?\'\r\n\r\nRushton, Didlum and Grinder fairly gasped for breath: the audacity of\r\nthe chief\'s proposal nearly paralysed them.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid we should never git away with it,\' ejaculated Didlum, as\r\nsoon as he could speak.  \'When the people tumbled to it, there\'d be no\r\nhend of a row.\'\r\n\r\n\'PEOPLE!  ROW!\' replied Sweater, scornfully.  \'The majority of the\r\npeople will never know anything about it! Listen to me--\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you quite sure as we can\'t be over\'eard?\' interrupted Rushton,\r\nglancing nervously at the door and round the office.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all right,\' answered Sweater, who nevertheless lowered his voice\r\nalmost to a whisper, and the others drew their chairs closer and bent\r\nforward to listen.\r\n\r\n\'You know we still have a little money in hand: well, what I propose is\r\nthis: At the annual meeting, which, as you know, comes off next week,\r\nwe\'ll arrange for the Secretary to read a highly satisfactory report,\r\nand we\'ll declare a dividend of 15 per cent--we can arrange it somehow\r\nbetween us.  Of course, we\'ll have to cook the accounts a little, but\r\nI\'ll see that it\'s done properly.  The other shareholders are not going\r\nto ask any awkward questions, and we all understand each other.\'\r\n\r\nSweater paused, and regarded the other three brigands intently.  \'Do\r\nyou follow me?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes,\' said Didlum eagerly.  \'Go on with it.\'  And Rushton and\r\nGrinder nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\'Afterwards,\' resumed Sweater, \'I\'ll arrange for a good report of the\r\nmeeting to appear in the Weekly Ananias.  I\'ll instruct the Editor to\r\nwrite it himself, and I\'ll tell him just what to say.  I\'ll also get\r\nhim to write a leading article about it, saying that electricity is\r\nsure to supersede gas for lighting purposes in the very near future.\r\nThen the article will go on to refer to the huge profits made by the\r\nGas Coy and to say how much better it would have been if the town had\r\nbought the gasworks years ago, so that those profits might have been\r\nused to reduce the rates, the same as has been done in other towns.\r\nFinally, the article will declare that it\'s a great pity that the\r\nElectric Light Supply should be in the hands of a private company, and\r\nto suggest that an effort be made to acquire it for the town.\r\n\r\n\'In the meantime we can all go about--in a very quiet and judicious\r\nway, of course--bragging about what a good thing we\'ve got, and saying\r\nwe don\'t mean to sell.  We shall say that we\'ve overcome all the\r\ninitial expenses and difficulties connected with the installation of\r\nthe works--that we are only just beginning to reap the reward of our\r\nindustry and enterprise, and so on.\r\n\r\n\'Then,\' continued the Chief, \'we can arrange for it to be proposed in\r\nthe Council that the Town should purchase the Electric Light Works.\'\r\n\r\n\'But not by one of us four, you know,\' said Grinder with a cunning leer.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly not; that would give the show away at once.  There are, as\r\nyou know--several members of the Band who are not shareholders in the\r\ncompany; we\'ll get some of them to do most of the talking.  We, being\r\nthe directors of the company, must pretend to be against selling, and\r\nstick out for our own price; and when we do finally consent we must\r\nmake out that we are sacrificing our private interests for the good of\r\nthe Town.  We\'ll get a committee appointed--we\'ll have an expert\r\nengineer down from London--I know a man that will suit our purpose\r\nadmirably--we\'ll pay him a trifle and he\'ll say whatever we tell him\r\nto--and we\'ll rush the whole business through before you can say "Jack\r\nRobinson", and before the rate-payers have time to realize what\'s being\r\ndone.  Not that we need worry ourselves much about them. Most of them\r\ntake no interest in public affairs, but even if there is something\r\nsaid, it won\'t matter much to us once we\'ve got the money. It\'ll be a\r\nnine days\' wonder and then we\'ll hear no more of it.\'\r\n\r\nAs the Chief ceased speaking, the other brigands also remained silent,\r\nspeechless with admiration of his cleverness.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what do you think of it?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Think of it!\' cried Grinder, enthusiastically.  \'I think it\'s\r\nsplendid!  Nothing could be better.  If we can honly git away with it,\r\nI reckon it\'ll be one of the smartest thing we\'ve ever done.\'\r\n\r\n\'Smart ain\'t the word for it,\' observed Rushton.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no doubt it\'s a grand idear!\' exclaimed Didlum, \'and I\'ve just\r\nthought of something else that might be done to help it along. We could\r\narrange to \'ave a lot of letters sent "To the Editor of the Obscurer"\r\nand "To the Editor of the Ananias," and "To the Editor of the Weekly\r\nChloroform" in favour of the scheme.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s a very good idea,\' said Grinder.  \'For that matter the\r\neditors could write them to themselves and sign them "Progress",\r\n"Ratepayer", "Advance Mugsborough", and sich-like.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s all right,\' said the Chief, thoughtfully, \'but we must be\r\ncareful not to overdo it; of course there will have to be a certain\r\namount of publicity, but we don\'t want to create too much interest in\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come to think of it,\' observed Rushton arrogantly, \'why should we\r\ntrouble ourselves about the opinion of the ratepayers at all?  Why\r\nshould we trouble to fake the books, or declare a dividend or \'ave the\r\nharticles in the papers or anything else?  We\'ve got the game in our\r\nown \'ands; we\'ve got a majority in the Council, and, as Mr Sweater ses,\r\nvery few people even take the trouble to read the reports of the\r\nmeetings.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s right enough,\' said Grinder.  \'But it\'s just them few wot\r\nwould make a lot of trouble and talk; THEY\'RE the very people we \'as to\r\nthink about.  If we can only manage to put THEM in a fog we\'ll be all\r\nright, and the way to do it is as Mr Sweater proposes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think so,\' said the Chief.  \'We must be very careful.  I can\r\nwork it all right in the Ananias and the Chloroform, and of course\r\nyou\'ll see that the Obscurer backs us up.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll take care of that,\' said Grinder, grimly.\r\n\r\nThe three local papers were run by limited companies.  Sweater held\r\nnearly all the shares of the Ananias and of the Weekly Chloroform, and\r\ncontrolled their policy and contents.  Grinder occupied the same\r\nposition with regard to the Obscurer.  The editors were a sort of\r\nmarionettes who danced as Sweater and Grinder pulled the strings.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder how Dr Weakling will take it?\' remarked Rushton.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the very thing I was just thinkin\' about,\' cried Didlum. \'Don\'t\r\nyou think it would be a good plan if we could arrange to \'ave somebody\r\ntook bad--you know, fall down in a fit or something in the street just\r\noutside the Town \'All just before the matter is brought forward in the\r\nCouncil, and then \'ave someone to come and call \'im out to attend to\r\nthe party wot\'s ill, and keep \'im out till the business is done.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s a capital idear,\' said Grinder thoughtfully.  \'But who\r\ncould we get to \'ave the fit?  It would \'ave to be someone we could\r\ntrust, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow about Rushton?  You wouldn\'t mind doin\' it, would yer?\' inquired\r\nDidlum.\r\n\r\n\'I should strongly object,\' said Rushton haughtily.  He regarded the\r\nsuggestion that he should act such an undignified part, as a kind of\r\nsacrilege.\r\n\r\n\'Then I\'ll do it meself if necessary,\' said Didlum.  \'I\'m not proud\r\nwhen there\'s money to be made; anything for an honest living.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I think we\'re all agreed, so far,\' remarked Sweater.  The others\r\nsignified assent.\r\n\r\n\'And I think we all deserve a drink,\' the Chief continued, producing a\r\ndecanter and a box of cigars from a cupboard by the side of his desk.\r\n\'Pass that water bottle from behind you, Didlum.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose nobody won\'t be comin\' in?\' said the latter, anxiously. \'I\'m\r\na teetotaler, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s all right,\' said Sweater, taking four glasses out of the\r\ncupboard and pouring out the whisky.  \'I\'ve given orders that we\'re not\r\nto be disturbed for anyone.  Say when.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, \'ere\'s success to Socialism,\' cried Grinder, raising his glass,\r\nand taking a big drink.\r\n\r\n\'Amen--\'ear, \'ear, I mean,\' said Didlum, hastily correcting himself.\r\n\r\n\'Wot I likes about this \'ere business is that we\'re not only doin\'\r\nourselves a bit of good,\' continued Grinder with a laugh, \'we\'re not\r\nonly doin\' ourselves a bit of good, but we\'re likewise doin\' the\r\nSocialists a lot of \'arm.  When the ratepayers \'ave bought the Works,\r\nand they begins to kick up a row because they\'re losin\' money over\r\nit--we can tell \'em that it\'s Socialism!  And then they\'ll say that if\r\nthat\'s Socialism they don\'t want no more of it.\'\r\n\r\nThe other brigands laughed gleefully, and some of Didlum\'s whisky went\r\ndown the wrong way and nearly sent him into a fit.\r\n\r\n\'You might as well kill a man at once,\' he protested as he wiped the\r\ntears from his eyes, \'you might as well kill a man at once as choke \'im\r\nto death.\'\r\n\r\n\'And now I\'ve got a bit of good news for you,\' said the Chief as he put\r\nhis empty glass down.\r\n\r\nThe others became serious at once.\r\n\r\n\'Although we\'ve had a very rough time of it in our contest with the\r\nGasworks Company, and although we\'ve got the worst of it, it hasn\'t\r\nbeen all lavender for them, you know.  They\'ve not enjoyed themselves\r\neither: we hit them pretty hard when we put up the coal dues.\'\r\n\r\n\'A damn good job too,\' said Grinder malignantly.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' continued Sweater, \'they\'re just as sick of the fight as they\r\nwant to be, because of course they don\'t know exactly how badly we\'ve\r\nbeen hit.  For all they know, we could have continued the struggle\r\nindefinitely: and--well, to make a long story short, I\'ve had a talk\r\nwith the managing director and one or two others, and they\'re willing\r\nto let us in with them.  So that we can put the money we get for the\r\nElectric Light Works into gas shares!\'\r\n\r\nThis was such splendid news that they had another drink on the strength\r\nof it, and Didlum said that one of the first things they would have to\r\ndo would be to totally abolish the Coal Dues, because they pressed so\r\nhard on the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 31\r\n\r\nThe Deserter\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the end of January, Slyme left Easton\'s.  The latter had not\r\nsucceeded in getting anything to do since the work at \'The Cave\' was\r\nfinished, and latterly the quality of the food had been falling off.\r\nThe twelve shillings Slyme paid for his board and lodging was all that\r\nRuth had to keep house with.  She had tried to get some work to do\r\nherself, but generally without success; there were one or two jobs that\r\nshe might have had if she had been able to give her whole time to them,\r\nbut of course that was not possible; the child and the housework had to\r\nbe attended to, and Slyme\'s meals had to be prepared. Nevertheless, she\r\ncontrived to get away several times when she had a chance of earning a\r\nfew shillings by doing a day\'s charing for some lady or other, and then\r\nshe left everything in such order at home that Easton was able to\r\nmanage all right while she was away.  On these occasions, she usually\r\nleft the baby with Owen\'s wife, who was an old schoolmate of hers.\r\nNora was the more willing to render her this service because Frankie\r\nused to be so highly delighted whenever it happened.  He never tired of\r\nplaying with the child, and for several days afterwards he used to\r\nworry his mother with entreaties to buy a baby of their own.\r\n\r\nEaston earned a few shillings occasionally; now and then he got a job\r\nto clean windows, and once or twice he did a few days\' or hours\' work\r\nwith some other painter who had been fortunate enough to get a little\r\njob \'on his own\'--such as a ceiling to wash and whiten, or a room or\r\ntwo to paint; but such jobs were few.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when they were very hard up, they sold something; the Bible\r\nthat used to lie on the little table in the bay window was one of the\r\nfirst things to be parted with.  Ruth erased the inscription from the\r\nfly-leaf and then they sold the book at a second-hand shop for two\r\nshillings.  As time went on, they sold nearly everything that was\r\nsaleable, except of course, the things that were obtained on the hire\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nSlyme could see that they were getting very much into debt and behind\r\nwith the rent, and on two occasions already Easton had borrowed five\r\nshillings from him, which he might never be able to pay back.  Another\r\nthing was that Slyme was always in fear that Ruth--who had never wholly\r\nabandoned herself to wrongdoing--might tell Easton what had happened;\r\nmore than once she had talked of doing so, and the principal reason why\r\nshe refrained was that she knew that even if he forgave her, he could\r\nnever think the same of her as before.  Slyme repeatedly urged this\r\nview upon her, pointing out that no good could result from such a\r\nconfession.\r\n\r\nLatterly the house had become very uncomfortable.  It was not only that\r\nthe food was bad and that sometimes there was no fire, but Ruth and\r\nEaston were nearly always quarrelling about something or other. She\r\nscarcely spoke to Slyme at all, and avoided sitting at the table with\r\nhim whenever possible.  He was in constant dread that Easton might\r\nnotice her manner towards him, and seek for some explanation.\r\nAltogether the situation was so unpleasant that Slyme determined to\r\nclear out.  He made the excuse that he had been offered a few weeks\'\r\nwork at a place some little distance outside the town.  After he was\r\ngone they lived for several weeks in semi-starvation on what credit\r\nthey could get and by selling the furniture or anything else they\r\npossessed that could be turned into money.  The things out of Slyme\'s\r\nroom were sold almost directly he left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 32\r\n\r\nThe Veteran\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Jack Linden had tried hard to earn a little money by selling\r\nbloaters, but they often went bad, and even when he managed to sell\r\nthem all the profit was so slight that it was not worth doing.\r\n\r\nBefore the work at \'The Cave\' was finished, Philpot was a good friend\r\nto them; he frequently gave old Jack sixpence or a shilling and often\r\nbrought a bag of cakes or buns for the children.  Sometimes he came to\r\ntea with them on Sundays as an excuse for bringing a tin of salmon.\r\n\r\nElsie and Charley frequently went to Owen\'s house to take tea with\r\nFrankie; in fact, whilst Owen had anything to do, they almost lived\r\nthere, for both Owen and Nora, knowing that the Lindens had nothing to\r\nlive on except the earnings of the young woman, encouraged the children\r\nto come often.\r\n\r\nOld Jack made some hopeless attempts to get work--work of any kind, but\r\nnobody wanted him; and to make things worse, his eyesight, which had\r\nbeen failing for a long time, became very bad.  Once he was given a job\r\nby a big provision firm to carry an advertisement about the streets.\r\nThe man who had been carrying it before--an old soldier--had been\r\nsacked the previous day for getting drunk while on duty.  The\r\nadvertisement was not an ordinary pair of sandwich boards, but a sort\r\nof box without any bottom or lid, a wooden frame, four sides covered\r\nwith canvas, on which were pasted printed bills advertising margarine.\r\nEach side of this box or frame was rather larger than an ordinary\r\nsandwich board.\r\n\r\nOld Linden had to get inside this thing and carry it about the streets;\r\ntwo straps fixed across the top of the frame and passing one over each\r\nof his shoulders enabled him to carry it.  It swayed about a good deal\r\nas he walked along, especially when the wind caught it, but there were\r\ntwo handles inside to hold it steady by.  The pay was eighteenpence a\r\nday, and he had to travel a certain route, up and down the busiest\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nAt first the frame did not feel very heavy, but the weight seemed to\r\nincrease as the time went on, and the straps hurt his shoulders.  He\r\nfelt very much ashamed, also, whenever he encountered any of his old\r\nmates, some of whom laughed at him.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the frame requiring so much attention to keep it\r\nsteady, and being unused to the work, and his sight so bad, he several\r\ntimes narrowly escaped being run over.  Another thing that added to his\r\nembarrassment was the jeering of the other sandwichmen, the loafers\r\noutside the public houses, and the boys, who shouted \'old Jack in the\r\nbox\' after him.  Sometimes the boys threw refuse at the frame, and once\r\na decayed orange thrown by one of them knocked his hat off.\r\n\r\nBy the time evening came he was scarcely able to stand for weariness.\r\nHis shoulders, his legs and his feet ached terribly, and as he was\r\ntaking the thing back to the shop he was accosted by a ragged,\r\ndirty-looking, beer-sodden old man whose face was inflamed with drink\r\nand fury.  \'This was the old soldier who had been discharged the\r\nprevious day.  He cursed and swore in the most awful manner and accused\r\nLinden of \'taking the bread out of his mouth\', and, shaking his fist\r\nfiercely at him, shouted that he had a good mind to knock his face\r\nthrough his head and out of the back of his neck.  He might possibly\r\nhave tried to put this threat into practice but for the timely\r\nappearance of a policeman, when he calmed down at once and took himself\r\noff.\r\n\r\nJack did not go back the next day; he felt that he would rather starve\r\nthan have any more of the advertisement frame, and after this he seemed\r\nto abandon all hope of earning money: wherever he went it was the\r\nsame--no one wanted him.  So he just wandered about the streets\r\naimlessly, now and then meeting an old workmate who asked him to have a\r\ndrink, but this was not often, for nearly all of them were out of work\r\nand penniless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 33\r\n\r\nThe Soldier\'s Children\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring most of this time, Jack Linden\'s daughter-in-law had \'Plenty of\r\nWork\', making blouses and pinafores for Sweater & Co.  She had so much\r\nto do that one might have thought that the Tory Millennium had arrived,\r\nand that Tariff Reform was already an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nShe had Plenty of Work.\r\n\r\nAt first they had employed her exclusively on the cheapest kind of\r\nblouses--those that were paid for at the rate of two shillings a dozen,\r\nbut they did not give her many of that sort now.  She did the work so\r\nneatly that they kept her busy on the better qualities, which did not\r\npay her so well, because although she was paid more per dozen, there\r\nwas a great deal more work in them than in the cheaper kinds. Once she\r\nhad a very special one to make, for which she was paid six shillings;\r\nbut it took her four and a half days--working early and late--to do it.\r\nThe lady who bought this blouse was told that it came from Paris, and\r\npaid three guineas for it.  But of course Mrs Linden knew nothing of\r\nthat, and even if she had known, it would have made no difference to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMost of the money she earned went to pay the rent, and sometimes there\r\nwas only two or three shillings left to buy food for all of them:\r\nsometimes not even so much, because although she had Plenty of Work she\r\nwas not always able to do it.  There were times when the strain of\r\nworking the machine was unendurable: her shoulders ached, her arms\r\nbecame cramped, and her eyes pained so that it was impossible to\r\ncontinue.  Then for a change she would leave the sewing and do some\r\nhousework.\r\n\r\nOnce, when they owed four weeks\' rent, the agent was so threatening\r\nthat they were terrified at the thought of being sold up and turned out\r\nof the house, and so she decided to sell the round mahogany table and\r\nsome of the other things out of the sitting-room.  Nearly all the\r\nfurniture that was in the house now belonged to her, and had formed her\r\nhome before her husband died.  The old people had given most of their\r\nthings away at different times to their other sons since she had come\r\nto live there.  These men were all married and all in employment. One\r\nwas a fitter at the gasworks; the second was a railway porter, and the\r\nother was a butcher; but now that the old man was out of work they\r\nseldom came to the house.  The last time they had been there was on\r\nChristmas Eve, and then there had been such a terrible row between them\r\nthat the children had been awakened by it and frightened nearly out of\r\ntheir lives.  The cause of the row was that some time previously they\r\nhad mutually agreed to each give a shilling a week to the old people.\r\nThey had done this for three weeks and after that the butcher had\r\nstopped his contribution: it had occurred to him that he was not to be\r\nexpected to help to keep his brother\'s widow and her children.  If the\r\nold people liked to give up the house and go to live in a room\r\nsomewhere by themselves, he would continue paying his shilling a week,\r\nbut not otherwise.  Upon this the railway porter and the gas-fitter\r\nalso ceased paying.  They said it wasn\'t fair that they should pay a\r\nshilling a week each when the butcher--who was the eldest and earned\r\nthe best wages--paid nothing.  Provided he paid, they would pay; but if\r\nhe didn\'t pay anything, neither would they.  On Christmas Eve they all\r\nhappened to come to the house at the same time; each denounced the\r\nothers, and after nearly coming to blows they all went away raging and\r\ncursing and had not been near the place since.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she decided to sell the things, Mary went to Didlum\'s\r\nsecond-hand furniture store, and the manager said he would ask Mr\r\nDidlum to call and see the table and other articles.  She waited\r\nanxiously all the morning, but he did not appear, so she went once more\r\nto the shop to remind him.  When he did come at last he was very\r\ncontemptuous of the table and of everything else she offered to sell.\r\nFive shillings was the very most he could think of giving for the\r\ntable, and even then he doubted whether he would ever get his money\r\nback.  Eventually he gave her thirty shillings for the table, the\r\novermantel, the easy chair, three other chairs and the two best\r\npictures--one a large steel engraving of \'The Good Samaritan\' and the\r\nother \'Christ Blessing Little Children\'.\r\n\r\nHe paid the money at once; half an hour afterwards the van came to take\r\nthe things away, and when they were gone, Mary sank down on the\r\nhearthrug in the wrecked room and sobbed as if her heart would break.\r\n\r\nThis was the first of several similar transactions.  Slowly, piece by\r\npiece, in order to buy food and to pay the rent, the furniture was\r\nsold.  Every time Didlum came he affected to be doing them a very great\r\nfavour by buying the things at all.  Almost an act of charity. He did\r\nnot want them.  Business was so bad: it might be years before he could\r\nsell them again, and so on.  Once or twice he asked Mary if she did not\r\nwant to sell the clock--the one that her late husband had made for his\r\nmother, but Mary shrank from the thought of selling this, until at last\r\nthere was nothing else left that Didlum would buy, and one week, when\r\nMary was too ill to do any needlework--it had to go. He gave them ten\r\nshillings for it.\r\n\r\nMary had expected the old woman to be heartbroken at having to part\r\nwith this clock, but she was surprised to see her almost indifferent.\r\nThe truth was, that lately both the old people seemed stunned, and\r\nincapable of taking an intelligent interest in what was happening\r\naround them, and Mary had to attend to everything.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time nearly all their other possessions--things of\r\ninferior value that Didlum would not look at, she carried out and sold\r\nat small second-hand shops in back streets or pledged at the\r\npawn-broker\'s.  The feather pillows, sheets, and blankets: bits of\r\ncarpet or oilcloth, and as much of their clothing as was saleable or\r\npawnable.  They felt the loss of the bedclothes more than anything\r\nelse, for although all the clothes they wore during the day, and all\r\nthe old clothes and dresses in the house, and even an old coloured\r\ntablecloth, were put on the beds at night, they did not compensate for\r\nthe blankets, and they were often unable to sleep on account of the\r\nintense cold.\r\n\r\nA lady district visitor who called occasionally sometimes gave Mary an\r\norder for a hundredweight of coal or a shillingsworth of groceries, or\r\na ticket for a quart of soup, which Elsie fetched in the evening from\r\nthe Soup Kitchen.  But this was not very often, because, as the lady\r\nsaid, there were so many cases similar to theirs that it was impossible\r\nto do more than a very little for any one of them.\r\n\r\nSometimes Mary became so weak and exhausted through overwork, worry,\r\nand lack of proper food that she broke down altogether for the time\r\nbeing, and positively could not do any work at all.  Then she used to\r\nlie down on the bed in her room and cry.\r\n\r\nWhenever she became like this, Elsie and Charley used to do the\r\nhousework when they came home from school, and make tea and toast for\r\nher, and bring it to the bedside on a chair so that she could eat lying\r\ndown.  When there was no margarine or dripping to put on the toast,\r\nthey made it very thin and crisp and pretended it was biscuit.\r\n\r\nThe children rather enjoyed these times; the quiet and leisure was so\r\ndifferent from other days when their mother was so busy she had no time\r\nto speak to them.\r\n\r\nThey would sit on the side of the bed, the old grandmother in her chair\r\nopposite with the cat beside her listening to the conversation and\r\npurring or mewing whenever they stroked it or spoke to it.  They talked\r\nprincipally of the future.  Elsie said she was going to be a teacher\r\nand earn a lot of money to bring home to her mother to buy things with.\r\nCharley was thinking of opening a grocer\'s shop and having a horse and\r\ncart.  When one has a grocer\'s shop, there is always plenty to eat;\r\neven if you have no money, you can take as much as you like out of your\r\nshop--good stuff, too, tins of salmon, jam, sardines, eggs, cakes,\r\nbiscuits and all those sorts of things--and one was almost certain to\r\nhave some money every day, because it wasn\'t likely that a whole day\r\nwould go by without someone or other coming into the shop to buy\r\nsomething.  When delivering the groceries with the horse and cart, he\r\nwould give rides to all the boys he knew, and in the summertime, after\r\nthe work was done and the shop shut up, Mother and Elsie and Granny\r\ncould also come for long rides into the country.\r\n\r\nThe old grandmother--who had latterly become quite childish--used to\r\nsit and listen to all this talk with a superior air.  Sometimes she\r\nargued with the children about their plans, and ridiculed them.  She\r\nused to say with a chuckle that she had heard people talk like that\r\nbefore--lots of times--but it never came to nothing in the end.\r\n\r\nOne week about the middle of February, when they were in very sore\r\nstraits indeed, old Jack applied to the secretary of the Organized\r\nBenevolence Society for assistance.  It was about eleven o\'clock in the\r\nmorning when he turned the corner of the street where the office of the\r\nsociety was situated and saw a crowd of about thirty men waiting for\r\nthe doors to be opened in order to apply for soup tickets. Some of\r\nthese men were of the tramp or the drunken loafer class; some were old,\r\nbroken-down workmen like himself, and others were labourers wearing\r\ncorduroy or moleskin trousers with straps round their legs under their\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nLinden waited at a distance until all these were gone before he went\r\nin.  The secretary received him sympathetically and gave him a big form\r\nto fill up, but as Linden\'s eyes were so bad and his hand so unsteady\r\nthe secretary very obligingly wrote in the answers himself, and\r\ninformed him that he would inquire into the case and lay his\r\napplication before the committee at the next meeting, which was to be\r\nheld on the following Thursday--it was then Monday.\r\n\r\nLinden explained to him that they were actually starving.  He had been\r\nout of work for sixteen weeks, and during all that time they had lived\r\nfor the most part on the earnings of his daughter-in-law, but she had\r\nnot done anything for nearly a fortnight now, because the firm she\r\nworked for had not had any work for her to do.  There was no food in\r\nthe house and the children were crying for something to eat.  All last\r\nweek they had been going to school hungry, for they had had nothing but\r\ndry bread and tea every day: but this week--as far as he could\r\nsee--they would not get even that.  After some further talk the\r\nsecretary gave him two soup tickets and an order for a loaf of bread,\r\nand repeated his promise to inquire into the case and bring it before\r\nthe committee.\r\n\r\nAs Jack was returning home he passed the Soup Kitchen, where he saw the\r\nsame lot of men who had been to the office of the Organized Benevolence\r\nSociety for the soup tickets.  They were waiting in a long line to be\r\nadmitted.  The premises being so small, the proprietor served them in\r\nbatches of ten at a time.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the secretary called at the house, and on Friday Jack\r\nreceived a letter from him to the effect that the case had been duly\r\nconsidered by the committee, who had come to the conclusion that as it\r\nwas a \'chronic\' case they were unable to deal with it, and advised him\r\nto apply to the Board of Guardians.  This was what Linden had hitherto\r\nshrunk from doing, but the situation was desperate.  They owed five\r\nweeks\' rent, and to crown their misfortune his eyesight had become so\r\nbad that even if there had been any prospect of obtaining work it was\r\nvery doubtful if he could have managed to do it.  So Linden, feeling\r\nutterly crushed and degraded, swallowed all that remained of his pride\r\nand went like a beaten dog to see the relieving officer, who took him\r\nbefore the Board, who did not think it a suitable case for out-relief,\r\nand after some preliminaries it was arranged that Linden and his wife\r\nwere to go into the workhouse, and Mary was to be allowed three\r\nshillings a week to help her to support herself and the two children.\r\nAs for Linden\'s sons, the Guardians intimated their Intention of\r\ncompelling them to contribute towards the cost of their parents\'\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nMary accompanied the old people to the gates of their future\r\ndwelling-place, and when she returned home she found there a letter\r\naddressed to J. Linden.  It was from the house agent and contained a\r\nnotice to leave the house before the end of the ensuing week.  Nothing\r\nwas said about the rent that was due.  Perhaps Mr Sweater thought that\r\nas he had already received nearly six hundred pounds in rent from\r\nLinden he could afford to be generous about the five weeks that were\r\nstill owing--or perhaps he thought there was no possibility of getting\r\nthe money.  However that may have been, there was no reference to it in\r\nthe letter--it was simply a notice to clear out, addressed to Linden,\r\nbut meant for Mary.\r\n\r\nIt was about half past three o\'clock in the afternoon when she returned\r\nhome and found this letter on the floor in the front passage. She was\r\nfaint with fatigue and hunger, for she had had nothing but a cup of tea\r\nand a slice of bread that day, and her fare had not been much better\r\nfor many weeks past.  The children were at school, and the house--now\r\nalmost destitute of furniture and without carpets or oilcloth on the\r\nfloors--was deserted and cold and silent as a tomb. On the kitchen\r\ntable were a few cracked cups and saucers, a broken knife, some lead\r\nteaspoons, a part of a loaf, a small basin containing some dripping and\r\na brown earthenware teapot with a broken spout. Near the table were two\r\nbroken kitchen chairs, one with the top cross-piece gone from the back,\r\nand the other with no back to the seat at all.  The bareness of the\r\nwalls was relieved only by a coloured almanac and some paper pictures\r\nwhich the children had tacked upon them, and by the side of the\r\nfireplace was the empty wicker chair where the old woman used to sit.\r\nThere was no fire in the grate, and the cold hearth was untidy with an\r\naccumulation of ashes, for during the trouble of these last few days\r\nshe had not had time or heart to do any housework.  The floor was\r\nunswept and littered with scraps of paper and dust: in one corner was a\r\nheap of twigs and small branches of trees that Charley had found\r\nsomewhere and brought home for the fire.\r\n\r\nThe same disorder prevailed all through the house: all the doors were\r\nopen, and from where she stood in the kitchen she could see the bed she\r\nshared with Elsie, with its heterogeneous heap of coverings.  The\r\nsitting-room contained nothing but a collection of odds and ends of\r\nrubbish which belonged to Charley--his \'things\' as he called them--bits\r\nof wood, string and rope; one wheel of a perambulator, a top, an iron\r\nhoop and so on.  Through the other door was visible the dilapidated\r\nbedstead that had been used by the old people, with a similar lot of\r\nbedclothes to those on her own bed, and the torn, ragged covering of\r\nthe mattress through the side of which the flock was protruding and\r\nfalling in particles on to the floor.\r\n\r\nAs she stood there with the letter in her hand--faint and weary in the\r\nmidst of all this desolation, it seemed to her as if the whole world\r\nwere falling to pieces and crumbling away all around her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 34\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of the End\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the months of January and February, Owen, Crass, Slyme and\r\nSawkins continued to work at irregular intervals for Rushton & Co.,\r\nalthough--even when there was anything to do--they now put in only six\r\nhours a day, commencing in the morning and leaving off at four, with an\r\nhour\'s interval for dinner between twelve and one.  They finished the\r\n\'plant\' and painted the front of Rushton\'s shop.  When all this was\r\ncompleted, as no other work came in, they all had to \'stand off\' with\r\nthe exception of Sawkins, who was kept on because he was cheap and able\r\nto do all sorts of odd jobs, such as unstopping drains, repairing leaky\r\nroofs, rough painting or lime-washing, and he was also useful as a\r\nlabourer for the plumbers, of whom there were now three employed at\r\nRushton\'s, the severe weather which had come in with January having\r\nmade a lot of work in that trade.  With the exception of this one\r\nbranch, practically all work was at a standstill.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Rushton & Co. had had several \'boxing-up\' jobs to do,\r\nand Crass always did the polishing of the coffins on these occasions,\r\nbesides assisting to take the \'box\' home when finished and to \'lift in\'\r\nthe corpse, and afterwards he always acted as one of the bearers at the\r\nfunerals.  For an ordinary class funeral he usually put in about three\r\nhours for the polishing; that came to one and nine. Taking home the\r\ncoffin and lifting in the corpse, one shilling--usually there were two\r\nmen to do this besides Hunter, who always accompanied them to\r\nsuperintend the work--attending the funeral and acting as bearer, four\r\nshillings: so that altogether Crass made six shillings and ninepence\r\nout of each funeral, and sometimes a little more.  For instance, when\r\nthere was an unusually good-class corpse they had a double coffin and\r\nthen of course there were two \'lifts in\', for the shell was taken home\r\nfirst and the outer coffin perhaps a day or two later: this made\r\nanother shilling.  No matter how expensive the funeral was, the bearers\r\nnever got any more money.  Sometimes the carpenter and Crass were able\r\nto charge an hour or two more on the making and polishing of a coffin\r\nfor a good job, but that was all. Sometimes, when there was a very\r\ncheap job, they were paid only three shillings for attending as\r\nbearers, but this was not often: as a rule they got the same amount\r\nwhether it was a cheap funeral or an expensive one.  Slyme earned only\r\nfive shillings out of each funeral, and Owen only one and six--for\r\nwriting the coffin plate.\r\n\r\nSometimes there were three or four funerals in a week, and then Crass\r\ndid very well indeed.  He still had the two young men lodgers at his\r\nhouse, and although one of them was out of work he was still able to\r\npay his way because he had some money in the bank.\r\n\r\nOne of the funeral jobs led to a terrible row between Crass and\r\nSawkins.  The corpse was that of a well-to-do woman who had been ill\r\nfor a long time with cancer of the stomach, and after the funeral\r\nRushton & Co. had to clean and repaint and paper the room she had\r\noccupied during her illness.  Although cancer is not supposed to be an\r\ninfectious disease, they had orders to take all the bedding away and\r\nhave it burnt.  Sawkins was instructed to take a truck to the house and\r\nget the bedding and take it to the town Refuse Destructor to be\r\ndestroyed.  There were two feather beds, a bolster and two pillows:\r\nthey were such good things that Sawkins secretly resolved that instead\r\nof taking them to the Destructor he would take them to a second-hand\r\ndealer and sell them.\r\n\r\nAs he was coming away from the house with the things he met Hunter, who\r\ntold him that he wanted him for some other work; so he was to take the\r\ntruck to the yard and leave it there for the present; he could take the\r\nbedding to the Destructor later on in the day.  Sawkins did as Hunter\r\nordered, and in the meantime Crass, who happened to be working at the\r\nyard painting some venetian blinds, saw the things on the truck, and,\r\nhearing what was to be done with them, he also thought it was a pity\r\nthat such good things should be destroyed: so when Sawkins came in the\r\nafternoon to take them away Crass told him he need not trouble; \'I\'m\r\ngoin\' to \'ave that lot, he said; \'they\'re too good to chuck away;\r\nthere\'s nothing wrong with \'em.\'\r\n\r\nThis did not suit Sawkins at all.  He said he had been told to take\r\nthem to the Destructor, and he was going to do so.  He was dragging the\r\ncart out of the yard when Crass rushed up and lifted the bundle off and\r\ncarried it into the paint-shop.  Sawkins ran after him and they began\r\nto curse and swear at each other; Crass accusing Sawkins of intending\r\nto take the things to the marine stores and sell them. Sawkins seized\r\nhold of the bundle with the object of replacing it on the cart, but\r\nCrass got hold of it as well and they had a tussle for it--a kind of\r\ntug of war--reeling and struggling all over the shop. cursing and\r\nswearing horribly all the time.  Finally, Sawkins--being the better man\r\nof the two--succeeded in wrenching the bundle away and put it on the\r\ncart again, and then Crass hurriedly put on his coat and said he was\r\ngoing to the office to ask Mr Rushton if he might have the things.\r\nUpon hearing this, Sawkins became so infuriated that he lifted the\r\nbundle off the cart and, throwing it upon the muddy ground, right into\r\na pool of dirty water, trampled it underfoot; and then, taking out his\r\nclasp knife, began savagely hacking and ripping the ticking so that the\r\nfeathers all came falling out.  In a few minutes he had damaged the\r\nthings beyond hope of repair, while Crass stood by, white and\r\ntrembling, watching the proceedings but lacking the courage to\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\n\'Now go to the office and ask Rushton for \'em, if you like!\' shouted\r\nSawkins.  \'You can \'ave \'em now, if you want \'em.\'\r\n\r\nCrass made no answer and, after a moment\'s hesitation, went back to his\r\nwork, and Sawkins piled the things on the cart once more and took them\r\naway to the Destructor.  He would not be able to sell them now, but at\r\nany rate he had stopped that dirty swine Crass from getting them.\r\n\r\nWhen Crass went back to the paint-shop he found there one of the\r\npillows which had fallen out of the bundle during the struggle.  He\r\ntook it home with him that evening and slept upon it.  It was a fine\r\npillow, much fuller and softer and more cosy than the one he had been\r\naccustomed to.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards when he was working at the room where the woman\r\ndied, they gave him some other things that had belonged to her to do\r\naway with, and amongst them was a kind of wrap of grey knitted wool.\r\nCrass kept this for himself: it was just the thing to wrap round one\'s\r\nneck when going to work on a cold morning, and he used it for that\r\npurpose all through the winter.  In addition to the funerals, there was\r\na little other work: sometimes a room or two to be painted and papered\r\nand ceilings whitened, and once they had the outside of two small\r\ncottages to paint--doors and windows--two coats.  All four of them\r\nworked at this job and it was finished in two days.  And so they went\r\non.\r\n\r\nSome weeks Crass earned a pound or eighteen shillings; sometimes a\r\nlittle more, generally less and occasionally nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of jealousy and ill-feeling amongst them about the\r\nwork.  Slyme and Crass were both aggrieved about Sawkins whenever they\r\nwere idle, especially if the latter were painting or whitewashing, and\r\ntheir indignation was shared by all the others who were \'off\'.  Harlow\r\nswore horribly about it, and they all agreed that it was disgraceful\r\nthat a bloody labourer should be employed doing what ought to be\r\nskilled work for fivepence an hour, while properly qualified men were\r\n\'walking about\'.  These other men were also incensed against Slyme and\r\nCrass because the latter were given the preference whenever there was a\r\nlittle job to do, and it was darkly insinuated that in order to secure\r\nthis preference these two were working for sixpence an hour. There was\r\nno love lost between Crass and Slyme either: Crass was furious whenever\r\nit happened that Slyme had a few hours\' work to do if he himself were\r\nidle, and if ever Crass was working while Slyme was \'standing still\'\r\nthe latter went about amongst the other unemployed men saying ugly\r\nthings about Crass, whom he accused of being a \'crawler\'.  Owen also\r\ncame in for his share of abuse and blame: most of them said that a man\r\nlike him should stick out for higher wages whether employed on special\r\nwork or not, and then he would not get any preference.  But all the\r\nsame, whatever they said about each other behind each other\'s backs,\r\nthey were all most friendly to each other when they met face to face.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Owen did some work--such as graining a door or writing a\r\nsign--for one or other of his fellow workmen who had managed to secure\r\na little job \'on his own\', but putting it all together, the\r\ncoffin-plates and other work at Rushton\'s and all, his earnings had not\r\naveraged ten shillings a week for the last six weeks.  Often they had\r\nno coal and sometimes not even a penny to put into the gas meter, and\r\nthen, having nothing left good enough to pawn, he sometimes obtained a\r\nfew pence by selling some of his books to second-hand book dealers.\r\nHowever, bad as their condition was, Owen knew that they were better\r\noff than the majority of the others, for whenever he went out he was\r\ncertain to meet numbers of men whom he had worked with at different\r\ntimes, who said--some of them--that they had been idle for ten, twelve,\r\nfifteen and in some cases for twenty weeks without having earned a\r\nshilling.\r\n\r\nOwen used to wonder how they managed to continue to exist.  Most of\r\nthem were wearing other people\'s cast-off clothes, hats, and boots,\r\nwhich had in some instances been given to their wives by \'visiting\r\nladies\', or by the people at whose houses their wives went to work,\r\ncharing.  As for food, most of them lived on such credit as they could\r\nget, and on the scraps of broken victuals and meat that their wives\r\nbrought home from the places they worked at.  Some of them had grown-up\r\nsons and daughters who still lived with them and whose earnings kept\r\ntheir homes together, and the wives of some of them eked out a\r\nmiserable existence by letting lodgings.\r\n\r\nThe week before old Linden went into the workhouse Owen earned nothing,\r\nand to make matters worse the grocer from whom they usually bought\r\ntheir things suddenly refused to let them have any more credit. Owen\r\nwent to see him, and the man said he was very sorry, but he could not\r\nlet them have anything more without the money; he did not mind waiting\r\na few weeks for what was already owing, but he could not let the amount\r\nget any higher; his books were full of bad debts already. In\r\nconclusion, he said that he hoped Owen would not do as so many others\r\nhad done and take his ready money elsewhere.  People came and got\r\ncredit from him when they were hard up, and afterwards spent their\r\nready money at the Monopole Company\'s stores on the other side of the\r\nstreet, because their goods were a trifle cheaper, and it was not fair.\r\nOwen admitted that it was not fair, but reminded him that they always\r\nbought their things at his shop.  The grocer, however, was inexorable;\r\nhe repeated several times that his books were full of bad debts and his\r\nown creditors were pressing him.  During their conversation the\r\nshopkeeper\'s eyes wandered continually to the big store on the other\r\nside of the street; the huge, gilded letters of the name \'Monopole\r\nStores\' seemed to have an irresistible attraction for him.  Once he\r\ninterrupted himself in the middle of a sentence to point out to Owen a\r\nlittle girl who was just coming out of the Stores with a small parcel\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\n\'Her father owes me nearly thirty shillings,\' he said, \'but they spend\r\ntheir ready money there.\'\r\n\r\nThe front of the grocer\'s shop badly needed repainting, and the name on\r\nthe fascia, \'A. Smallman\', was so faded as to be almost indecipherable.\r\nIt had been Owen\'s intention to offer to do this work--the cost to go\r\nagainst his account--but the man appeared to be so harassed that Owen\r\nrefrained from making the suggestion.\r\n\r\nThey still had credit at the baker\'s, but they did not take much bread:\r\nwhen one has had scarcely anything else but bread to eat for nearly a\r\nmonth one finds it difficult to eat at all.  That same day, when he\r\nreturned home after his interview with the grocer, they had a loaf of\r\nbeautiful fresh bread, but none of them could eat it, although they\r\nwere hungry: it seemed to stick in their throats, and they could not\r\nswallow it even with the help of a drink of tea.  But they drank the\r\ntea, which was the one thing that enabled them to go on living.\r\n\r\nThe next week Owen earned eight shillings altogether: a few hours he\r\nput in assisting Crass to wash off and whiten a ceiling and paint a\r\nroom, and there was one coffin-plate.  He wrote the latter at home, and\r\nwhile he was doing it he heard Frankie--who was out in the scullery\r\nwith Nora--say to her:\r\n\r\n\'Mother, how many more days to you think we\'ll have to have only dry\r\nbread and tea?\'\r\n\r\nOwen\'s heart seemed to stop as he heard the child\'s question and\r\nlistened for Nora\'s answer, but the question was not to be answered at\r\nall just then, for at that moment they heard someone running up the\r\nstairs and presently the door was unceremoniously thrown open and\r\nCharley Linden rushed into the house, out of breath, hatless, and\r\ncrying piteously.  His clothes were old and ragged; they had been\r\npatched at the knees and elbows, but the patches were tearing away from\r\nthe rotting fabric into which they had been sewn.  He had on a pair of\r\nblack stockings full of holes through which the skin was showing.  The\r\nsoles of his boots were worn through at one side right to the uppers,\r\nand as he walked the sides of his bare heels came into contact with the\r\nfloor, the front part of the sole of one boot was separated from the\r\nupper, and his bare toes, red with cold and covered with mud, protruded\r\nthrough the gap.  Some sharp substance--a nail or a piece of glass or\r\nflint--had evidently lacerated his right foot, for blood was oozing\r\nfrom the broken heel of his boot on to the floor.\r\n\r\nThey were unable to make much sense of the confused story he told them\r\nthrough his sobs as soon as he was able to speak.  All that was clear\r\nwas that there was something very serious the matter at home: he\r\nthought his mother must be either dying or dead, because she did not\r\nspeak or move or open her eyes, and \'please, please, please will you\r\ncome home with me and see her?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Nora was getting ready to go with the boy, Owen made him sit on a\r\nchair, and having removed the boot from the foot that was bleeding,\r\nwashed the cut with some warm water and bandaged it with a piece of\r\nclean rag, and then they tried to persuade him to stay there with\r\nFrankie while Nora went to see his mother, but the boy would not hear\r\nof it.  So Frankie went with them instead.  Owen could not go because\r\nhe had to finish the coffin-plate, which was only just commenced.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that we left Mary Linden alone in the house after\r\nshe returned from seeing the old people away.  When the children came\r\nhome from school, about half an hour afterwards, they found her sitting\r\nin one of the chairs with her head resting on her arms on the table,\r\nunconscious.  They were terrified, because they could not awaken her\r\nand began to cry, but presently Charley thought of Frankie\'s mother\r\nand, telling his sister to stay there while he was gone, he started off\r\nat a run for Owen\'s house, leaving the front door wide open after him.\r\n\r\nWhen Nora and the two boys reached the house they found there two other\r\nwomen neighbours, who had heard Elsie crying and had come to see what\r\nwas wrong.  Mary had recovered from her faint and was lying down on the\r\nbed. Nora stayed with her for some time after the other women went\r\naway.  She lit the fire and gave the children their tea--there was\r\nstill some coal and food left of what had been bought with the three\r\nshillings obtained from the Board of Guardians--and afterwards she\r\ntidied the house.\r\n\r\nMary said that she did not know exactly what she would have to do in\r\nthe future.  If she could get a room somewhere for two or three\r\nshillings a week, her allowance from the Guardians would pay the rent,\r\nand she would be able to earn enough for herself and the children to\r\nlive on.\r\n\r\nThis was the substance of the story that Nora told Owen when she\r\nreturned home.  He had finished writing the coffin-plate, and as it was\r\nnow nearly dry he put on his coat and took it down to the carpenter\'s\r\nshop at the yard.\r\n\r\nOn his way back he met Easton, who had been hanging about in the vain\r\nhope of seeing Hunter and finding out if there was any chance of a job.\r\nAs they walked along together, Easton confided to Owen that he had\r\nearned scarcely anything since he had been stood off at Rushton\'s, and\r\nwhat he had earned had gone, as usual, to pay the rent.  Slyme had left\r\nthem some time ago.  Ruth did not seem able to get on with him; she had\r\nbeen in a funny sort of temper altogether, but since he had gone she\r\nhad had a little work at a boarding-house on the Grand Parade.  But\r\nthings had been going from bad to worse. They had not been able to keep\r\nup the payments for the furniture they had hired, so the things had\r\nbeen seized and carted off.  They had even stripped the oilcloth from\r\nthe floor.  Easton remarked he was sorry he had not tacked the bloody\r\nstuff down in such a manner that they would not have been able to take\r\nit up without destroying it.  He had been to see Didlum, who said he\r\ndidn\'t want to be hard on them, and that he would keep the things\r\ntogether for three months, and if Easton had paid up arrears by that\r\ntime he could have them back again, but there was, in Easton\'s opinion,\r\nvery little chance of that.\r\n\r\nOwen listened with contempt and anger.  Here was a man who grumbled at\r\nthe present state of things, yet took no trouble to think for himself\r\nand try to alter them, and who at the first chance would vote for the\r\nperpetuation of the System which produced his misery.\r\n\r\n\'Have you heard that old Jack Linden and his wife went to the workhouse\r\ntoday,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' replied Easton, indifferently.  \'It\'s only what I expected.\'\r\n\r\nOwen then suggested it would not be a bad plan for Easton to let his\r\nfront room, now that it was empty, to Mrs Linden, who would be sure to\r\npay her rent, which would help Easton to pay his.  Easton agreed and\r\nsaid he would mention it to Ruth, and a few minutes later they parted.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Nora found Ruth talking to Mary Linden about the room\r\nand as the Eastons lived only about five minutes\' walk away, they all\r\nthree went round there in order that Mary might see the room.  The\r\nappearance of the house from outside was unaltered: the white lace\r\ncurtains still draped the windows of the front room; and in the centre\r\nof the bay was what appeared to be a small round table covered with a\r\nred cloth, and upon it a geranium in a flowerpot standing in a saucer\r\nwith a frill of coloured tissue paper round it.  These things and the\r\ncurtains, which fell close together, made it impossible for anyone to\r\nsee that the room was, otherwise, unfurnished.  The \'table\' consisted\r\nof an empty wooden box--procured from the grocer\'s--stood on end, with\r\nthe lid of the scullery copper placed upside down upon it for a top and\r\ncovered with an old piece of red cloth.  The purpose of this was to\r\nprevent the neighbours from thinking that they were hard up; although\r\nthey knew that nearly all those same neighbours were in more or less\r\nsimilar straits.\r\n\r\nIt was not a very large room, considering that it would have to serve\r\nall purposes for herself and the two children, but Mrs Linden knew that\r\nit was not likely that she would be able to get one as good elsewhere\r\nfor the same price, so she agreed to take it from the following Monday\r\nat two shillings a week.\r\n\r\nAs the distance was so short they were able to carry most of the\r\nsmaller things to their new home during the next few days, and on the\r\nMonday evening, when it was dark.  Owen and Easton brought the\r\nremainder on a truck they borrowed for the purpose from Hunter.\r\n\r\nDuring the last weeks of February the severity of the weather\r\nincreased.  There was a heavy fall of snow on the 20th followed by a\r\nhard frost which lasted several days.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\'clock one night a policeman found a man lying unconscious\r\nin the middle of a lonely road.  At first he thought the man was drunk,\r\nand after dragging him on to the footpath out of the way of passing\r\nvehicles he went for the stretcher.  They took the man to the station\r\nand put him into a cell, which was already occupied by a man who had\r\nbeen caught in the act of stealing a swede turnip from a barn. When the\r\npolice surgeon came he pronounced the supposed drunken man to be dying\r\nfrom bronchitis and want of food; and he further said that there was\r\nnothing to indicate that the man was addicted to drink. When the\r\ninquest was held a few days afterwards, the coroner remarked that it\r\nwas the third case of death from destitution that had occurred in the\r\ntown within six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe evidence showed that the man was a plasterer who had walked from\r\nLondon with the hope of finding work somewhere in the country.  He had\r\nno money in his possession when he was found by the policeman; all that\r\nhis pockets contained being several pawn-tickets and a letter from his\r\nwife, which was not found until after he died, because it was in an\r\ninner pocket of his waistcoat.  A few days before this inquest was\r\nheld, the man who had been arrested for stealing the turnip had been\r\ntaken before the magistrates.  The poor wretch said he did it because\r\nhe was starving, but Aldermen Sweater and Grinder, after telling him\r\nthat starvation was no excuse for dishonesty, sentenced him to pay a\r\nfine of seven shillings and costs, or go to prison for seven days with\r\nhard labour.  As the convict had neither money nor friends, he had to\r\ngo to jail, where he was, after all, better off than most of those who\r\nwere still outside because they lacked either the courage or the\r\nopportunity to steal something to relieve their sufferings.\r\n\r\nAs time went on the long-continued privation began to tell upon Owen\r\nand his family.  He had a severe cough: his eyes became deeply sunken\r\nand of remarkable brilliancy, and his thin face was always either\r\ndeathly pale or dyed with a crimson flush.\r\n\r\nFrankie also began to show the effects of being obliged to go so often\r\nwithout his porridge and milk; he became very pale and thin and his\r\nlong hair came out in handfuls when his mother combed or brushed it.\r\nThis was a great trouble to the boy, who, since hearing the story of\r\nSamson read out of the Bible at school, had ceased from asking to have\r\nhis hair cut short, lest he should lose his strength in consequence. He\r\nused to test himself by going through a certain exercise he had himself\r\ninvented, with a flat iron, and he was always much relieved when he\r\nfound that, notwithstanding the loss of the porridge, he was still able\r\nto lift the iron the proper number of times.  But after a while, as he\r\nfound that it became increasingly difficult to go through the exercise,\r\nhe gave it up altogether, secretly resolving to wait until \'Dad\' had\r\nmore work to do, so that he could have the porridge and milk again.  He\r\nwas sorry to have to discontinue the exercise, but he said nothing\r\nabout it to his father or mother because he did not want to \'worry\'\r\nthem...\r\n\r\nSometimes Nora managed to get a small job of needlework.  On one\r\noccasion a woman with a small son brought a parcel of garments\r\nbelonging to herself or her husband, an old ulster, several coats, and\r\nso on--things that although they were too old-fashioned or shabby to\r\nwear, yet might look all right if turned and made up for the boy.\r\n\r\nNora undertook to do this, and after working several hours every day\r\nfor a week she earned four shillings: and even then the woman thought\r\nit was so dear that she did not bring any more.\r\n\r\nAnother time Mrs Easton got her some work at a boarding-house where she\r\nherself was employed.  The servant was laid up, and they wanted some\r\nhelp for a few days.  The pay was to be two shillings a day, and\r\ndinner.  Owen did not want her to go because he feared she was not\r\nstrong enough to do the work, but he gave way at last and Nora went.\r\nShe had to do the bedrooms, and on the evening of the second day, as a\r\nresult of the constant running up and down the stairs carrying heavy\r\ncans and pails of water, she was in such intense pain that she was\r\nscarcely able to walk home, and for several days afterwards had to lie\r\nin bed through a recurrence of her old illness, which caused her to\r\nsuffer untold agony whenever she tried to stand.\r\n\r\nOwen was alternately dejected and maddened by the knowledge of his own\r\nhelplessness: when he was not doing anything for Rushton he went about\r\nthe town trying to find some other work, but usually with scant\r\nsuccess.  He did some samples of showcard and window tickets and\r\nendeavoured to get some orders by canvassing the shops in the town, but\r\nthis was also a failure, for these people generally had a ticket-writer\r\nto whom they usually gave their work.  He did get a few trifling\r\norders, but they were scarcely worth doing at the price he got for\r\nthem.  He used to feel like a criminal when he went into the shops to\r\nask them for the work, because he realized fully that, in effect, he\r\nwas saying to them: \'Take your work away from the other man, and employ\r\nme.\'  He was so conscious of this that it gave him a shamefaced manner,\r\nwhich, coupled as it was with his shabby clothing, did not create a\r\nvery favourable impression upon those he addressed, who usually treated\r\nhim with about as much courtesy as they would have extended to any\r\nother sort of beggar.  Generally, after a day\'s canvassing, he returned\r\nhome unsuccessful and faint with hunger and fatigue.\r\n\r\nOnce, when there was a bitterly cold east wind blowing, he was out on\r\none of these canvassing expeditions and contracted a severe cold: his\r\nchest became so bad that he found it almost impossible to speak,\r\nbecause the effort to do so often brought on a violent fit of coughing.\r\nIt was during this time that a firm of drapers, for whom he had done\r\nsome showcards, sent him an order for one they wanted in a hurry, it\r\nhad to be delivered the next morning, so he stayed up by himself till\r\nnearly midnight to do it.  As he worked, he felt a strange sensation in\r\nhis chest: it was not exactly a pain, and he would have found it\r\ndifficult to describe it in words--it was just a sensation.  He did not\r\nattach much importance to it, thinking it an effect of the cold he had\r\ntaken, but whatever it was he could not help feeling conscious of it\r\nall the time.\r\n\r\nFrankie had been put to bed that evening at the customary hour, but did\r\nnot seem to be sleeping as well as usual.  Owen could hear him twisting\r\nand turning about and uttering little cries in his sleep.\r\n\r\nHe left his work several times to go into the boy\'s room and cover him\r\nwith the bedclothes which his restless movements had disordered.  As\r\nthe time wore on, the child became more tranquil, and about eleven\r\no\'clock, when Owen went in to look at him, he found him in a deep\r\nsleep, lying on his side with his head thrown back on the pillow,\r\nbreathing so softly through his slightly parted lips that the sound was\r\nalmost imperceptible.  The fair hair that clustered round his forehead\r\nwas damp with perspiration, and he was so still and pale and silent\r\nthat one might have thought he was sleeping the sleep that knows no\r\nawakening.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later, when he had finished writing the showcard, Owen\r\nwent out into the scullery to wash his hands before going to bed: and\r\nwhilst he was drying them on the towel, the strange sensation he had\r\nbeen conscious of all the evening became more intense, and a few\r\nseconds afterwards he was terrified to find his mouth suddenly filled\r\nwith blood.\r\n\r\nFor what seemed an eternity he fought for breath against the\r\nsuffocating torrent, and when at length it stopped, he sank trembling\r\ninto a chair by the side of the table, holding the towel to his mouth\r\nand scarcely daring to breathe, whilst a cold sweat streamed from every\r\npore and gathered in large drops upon his forehead.\r\n\r\nThrough the deathlike silence of the night there came from time to time\r\nthe chimes of the clock of a distant church, but he continued to sit\r\nthere motionless, taking no heed of the passing hours, and possessed\r\nwith an awful terror.\r\n\r\nSo this was the beginning of the end!  And afterwards the other two\r\nwould be left by themselves at the mercy of the world.  In a few years\'\r\ntime the boy would be like Bert White, in the clutches of some\r\npsalm-singing devil like Hunter or Rushton, who would use him as if he\r\nwere a beast of burden.  He imagined he could see him now as he would\r\nbe then: worked, driven, and bullied, carrying loads, dragging carts,\r\nand running here and there, trying his best to satisfy the brutal\r\ntyrants, whose only thought would be to get profit out of him for\r\nthemselves.  If he lived, it would be to grow up with his body deformed\r\nand dwarfed by unnatural labour and with his mind stultified, degraded\r\nand brutalized by ignorance and poverty.  As this vision of the child\'s\r\nfuture rose before him, Owen resolved that it should never be!  He\r\nwould not leave them alone and defenceless in the midst of the\r\n\'Christian\' wolves who were waiting to rend them as soon as he was\r\ngone.  If he could not give them happiness, he could at least put them\r\nout of the reach of further suffering.  If he could not stay with them,\r\nthey would have to come with him.  It would be kinder and more merciful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 35\r\n\r\nFacing the \'Problem\'\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly every other firm in the town was in much the same plight as\r\nRushton & Co.; none of them had anything to speak of to do, and the\r\nworkmen no longer troubled to go to the different shops asking for a\r\njob.  They knew it was of no use.  Most of them just walked about\r\naimlessly or stood talking in groups in the streets, principally in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Wage Slave Market near the fountain on the Grand\r\nParade.  They congregated here in such numbers that one or two\r\nresidents wrote to the local papers complaining of the \'nuisance\', and\r\npointing out that it was calculated to drive the \'better-class\'\r\nvisitors out of the town.  After this two or three extra policemen were\r\nput on duty near the fountain with instructions to \'move on\' any groups\r\nof unemployed that formed.  They could not stop them from coming there,\r\nbut they prevented them standing about.\r\n\r\nThe processions of unemployed continued every day, and the money they\r\nbegged from the public was divided equally amongst those who took part.\r\nSometimes it amounted to one and sixpence each, sometimes it was a\r\nlittle more and sometimes a little less.  These men presented a\r\nterrible spectacle as they slunk through the dreary streets, through\r\nthe rain or the snow, with the slush soaking into their broken boots,\r\nand, worse still, with the bitterly cold east wind penetrating their\r\nrotten clothing and freezing their famished bodies.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the skilled workers still held aloof from these\r\nprocessions, although their haggard faces bore involuntary testimony to\r\ntheir sufferings.  Although privation reigned supreme in their desolate\r\nhomes, where there was often neither food nor light nor fire, they were\r\ntoo \'proud\' to parade their misery before each other or the world.\r\nThey secretly sold or pawned their clothing and their furniture and\r\nlived in semi-starvation on the proceeds, and on credit, but they would\r\nnot beg.  Many of them even echoed the sentiments of those who had\r\nwritten to the papers, and with a strange lack of class-sympathy blamed\r\nthose who took part in the processions.  They said it was that sort of\r\nthing that drove the \'better class\' away, injured the town, and caused\r\nall the poverty and unemployment. However, some of them accepted\r\ncharity in other ways; district visitors distributed tickets for coal\r\nand groceries.  Not that that sort of thing made much difference; there\r\nwas usually a great deal of fuss and advice, many quotations of\r\nScripture, and very little groceries.  And even what there was\r\ngenerally went to the least-deserving people, because the only way to\r\nobtain any of this sort of \'charity\' is by hypocritically pretending to\r\nbe religious: and the greater the hypocrite, the greater the quantity\r\nof coal and groceries.  These \'charitable\' people went into the\r\nwretched homes of the poor and--in effect--said: \'Abandon every\r\nparticle of self-respect: cringe and fawn: come to church: bow down and\r\ngrovel to us, and in return we\'ll give you a ticket that you can take\r\nto a certain shop and exchange for a shillingsworth of groceries.  And,\r\nif you\'re very servile and humble we may give you another one next\r\nweek.\'\r\n\r\nThey never gave the \'case\' the money.  The ticket system serves three\r\npurposes.  It prevents the \'case\' abusing the \'charity\' by spending the\r\nmoney on drink.  It advertises the benevolence of the donors: and it\r\nenables the grocer--who is usually a member of the church--to get rid\r\nof any stale or damaged stock he may have on hand.\r\n\r\nWhen these visiting ladies\' went into a workman\'s house and found it\r\nclean and decently furnished, and the children clean and tidy, they\r\ncame to the conclusion that those people were not suitable \'cases\' for\r\nassistance.  Perhaps the children had had next to nothing to eat, and\r\nwould have been in rags if the mother had not worked like a slave\r\nwashing and mending their clothes.  But these were not the sort of\r\ncases that the visiting ladies assisted; they only gave to those who\r\nwere in a state of absolute squalor and destitution, and then only on\r\ncondition that they whined and grovelled.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this district visitor business, the well-to-do\r\ninhabitants and the local authorities attempted--or rather,\r\npretended--to grapple with the poverty \'problem\' in many other ways,\r\nand the columns of the local papers were filled with letters from all\r\nsorts of cranks who suggested various remedies.  One individual, whose\r\nincome was derived from brewery shares, attributed the prevailing\r\ndistress to the drunken and improvident habits of the lower orders.\r\nAnother suggested that it was a Divine protest against the growth of\r\nRitualism and what he called \'fleshly religion\', and suggested a day of\r\nhumiliation and prayer.  A great number of well-fed persons thought\r\nthis such an excellent proposition that they proceeded to put it into\r\npractice.  They prayed, whilst the unemployed and the little children\r\nfasted.\r\n\r\nIf one had not been oppressed by the tragedy of Want and Misery, one\r\nmight have laughed at the farcical, imbecile measures that were taken\r\nto relieve it.  Several churches held what they called \'Rummage\' or\r\n\'jumble\' sales.  They sent out circulars something like this:\r\n\r\n                              JUMBLE SALE\r\n                       in aid of the Unemployed.\r\n\r\n    If you have any articles of any description which are of no\r\n    further use to you, we should be grateful for them, and if you\r\n    will kindly fill in annexed form and post it to us, we will send\r\n    and collect them.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the sale the parish room was transformed into a kind of\r\nMarine Stores, filled with all manner of rubbish, with the parson and\r\nthe visiting ladies grinning in the midst.  The things were sold for\r\nnext to nothing to such as cared to buy them, and the local\r\nrag-and-bone man reaped a fine harvest.  The proceeds of these sales\r\nwere distributed in \'charity\' and it was usually a case of much cry and\r\nlittle wool.\r\n\r\nThere was a religious organization, called \'The Mugsborough Skull and\r\nCrossbones Boys\', which existed for the purpose of perpetuating the\r\ngreat religious festival of Guy Fawkes.  This association also came to\r\nthe aid of the unemployed and organized a Grand Fancy Dress Carnival\r\nand Torchlight Procession.  When this took place, although there was a\r\nslight sprinkling of individuals dressed in tawdry costumes as\r\ncavaliers of the time of Charles I, and a few more as highwaymen or\r\nfootpads, the majority of the processionists were boys in women\'s\r\nclothes, or wearing sacks with holes cut in them for their heads and\r\narms, and with their faces smeared with soot.  There were also a number\r\nof men carrying frying-pans in which they burnt red and blue fire.  The\r\nprocession--or rather, mob--was headed by a band, and the band was\r\nheaded by two men, arm in arm, one very tall, dressed to represent\r\nSatan, in red tights, with horns on his head, and smoking a large\r\ncigar, and the other attired in the no less picturesque costume of a\r\nbishop of the Established Church.\r\n\r\nThis crew paraded the town, howling and dancing, carrying flaring\r\ntorches, burning the blue and red fire, and some of them singing silly\r\nor obscene songs; whilst the collectors ran about with the boxes\r\nbegging for money from people who were in most cases nearly as\r\npoverty-stricken as the unemployed they were asked to assist.  The\r\nmoney thus obtained was afterwards handed over to the Secretary of the\r\nOrganized Benevolence Society, Mr Sawney Grinder.\r\n\r\nThen there was the Soup Kitchen, which was really an inferior\r\neating-house in a mean street.  The man who ran this was a relative of\r\nthe secretary of the OBS.  He cadged all the ingredients for the soup\r\nfrom different tradespeople: bones and scraps of meat from butchers:\r\npea meal and split peas from provision dealers: vegetables from\r\ngreengrocers: stale bread from bakers, and so on.  Well-intentioned,\r\ncharitable old women with more money than sense sent him donations in\r\ncash, and he sold the soup for a penny a basin--or a penny a quart to\r\nthose who brought jugs.\r\n\r\nHe had a large number of shilling books printed, each containing\r\nthirteen penny tickets.  The Organized Benevolence Society bought a lot\r\nof these books and resold them to benevolent persons, or gave them away\r\nto \'deserving cases\'.  It was this connection with the OBS that gave\r\nthe Soup Kitchen a semi-official character in the estimation of the\r\npublic, and furnished the proprietor with the excuse for cadging the\r\nmaterials and money donations.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Soup Kitchen, as with the unemployed processions,\r\nmost of those who benefited were unskilled labourers or derelicts: with\r\nbut few exceptions the unemployed artisans--although their need was\r\njust as great as that of the others--avoided the place as if it were\r\ninfected with the plague.  They were afraid even to pass through the\r\nstreet where it was situated lest anyone seeing them coming from that\r\ndirection should think they had been there.  But all the same, some of\r\nthem allowed their children to go there by stealth, by night, to buy\r\nsome of this charity-tainted food.\r\n\r\nAnother brilliant scheme, practical and statesmanlike, so different\r\nfrom the wild projects of demented Socialists, was started by the Rev.\r\nMr Bosher, a popular preacher, the Vicar of the fashionable Church of\r\nthe Whited Sepulchre.  He collected some subscriptions from a number of\r\nsemi-imbecile old women who attended his church.  With some of this\r\nmoney he bought a quantity of timber and opened what he called a Labour\r\nYard, where he employed a number of men sawing firewood.  Being a\r\nclergyman, and because he said he wanted it for a charitable purpose,\r\nof course he obtained the timber very cheaply--for about half what\r\nanyone else would have had to pay for it.\r\n\r\nThe wood-sawing was done piecework.  A log of wood about the size of a\r\nrailway sleeper had to be sawn into twelve pieces, and each of these\r\nhad to be chopped into four.  For sawing and chopping one log in this\r\nmanner the worker was paid ninepence.  One log made two bags of\r\nfirewood, which were sold for a shilling each--a trifle under the usual\r\nprice.  The men who delivered the bags were paid three half-pence for\r\neach two bags.\r\n\r\nAs there were such a lot of men wanting to do this work, no one was\r\nallowed to do more than three lots in one day--that came to two\r\nshillings and threepence--and no one was allowed to do more than two\r\ndays in one week.\r\n\r\nThe Vicar had a number of bills printed and displayed in shop windows\r\ncalling attention to what he was doing, and informing the public that\r\norders could be sent to the Vicarage by post and would receive prompt\r\nattention and the fuel could be delivered at any address--Messrs\r\nRushton & Co. having very kindly lent a handcart for the use of the men\r\nemployed at the Labour Yard.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the appearance of this bill, and of the laudatory\r\nnotices in the columns of the Ananias, the Obscurer, and the\r\nChloroform--the papers did not mind giving the business a free\r\nadvertisement, because it was a charitable concern--many persons\r\nwithdrew their custom from those who usually supplied them with\r\nfirewood, and gave their orders to the Yard; and they had the\r\nsatisfaction of getting their fuel cheaper than before and of\r\nperforming a charitable action at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs a remedy for unemployment this scheme was on a par with the method\r\nof the tailor in the fable who thought to lengthen his cloth by cutting\r\na piece off one end and sewing it on to the other; but there was one\r\nthing about it that recommended it to the Vicar--it was\r\nself-supporting.  He found that there would be no need to use all the\r\nmoney he had extracted from the semi-imbecile old ladies for timber, so\r\nhe bought himself a Newfoundland dog, an antique set of carved ivory\r\nchessmen, and a dozen bottles of whisky with the remainder of the cash.\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentleman hit upon yet another means of helping the poor.\r\nHe wrote a letter to the Weekly Chloroform appealing for cast-off boots\r\nfor poor children.  This was considered such a splendid idea that the\r\neditors of all the local papers referred to it in leading articles, and\r\nseveral other letters were written by prominent citizens extolling the\r\nwisdom and benevolence of the profound Bosher.  Most of the boots that\r\nwere sent in response to this appeal had been worn until they needed\r\nrepair--in a very large proportion of instances, until they were beyond\r\nrepair.  The poor people to whom they were given could not afford to\r\nhave them mended before using them, and the result was that the boots\r\ngenerally began to fall to pieces after a few days\' wear.\r\n\r\nThis scheme amounted to very little.  It did not increase the number of\r\ncast-off boots, and most of the people who \'cast off\' their boots\r\ngenerally gave them to someone or other.  The only difference It can\r\nhave made was that possibly a few persons who usually threw their boots\r\naway or sold them to second-hand dealers may have been induced to send\r\nthem to Mr Bosher instead.  But all the same nearly everybody said it\r\nwas a splendid idea: its originator was applauded as a public\r\nbenefactor, and the pettifogging busybodies who amused themselves with\r\nwhat they were pleased to term \'charitable work\' went into imbecile\r\necstasies over him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 36\r\n\r\nThe OBS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most important agencies for the relief of distress was the\r\nOrganized Benevolence Society.  This association received money from\r\nmany sources.  The proceeds of the fancy-dress carnival; the\r\ncollections from different churches and chapels which held special\r\nservices in aid of the unemployed; the weekly collections made by the\r\nemployees of several local firms and business houses; the proceeds of\r\nconcerts, bazaars, and entertainments, donations from charitable\r\npersons, and the subscriptions of the members.  The society also\r\nreceived large quantities of cast-off clothing and boots, and tickets\r\nof admission to hospitals, convalescent homes and dispensaries from\r\nsubscribers to those institutions, or from people like Rushton & Co.,\r\nwho had collecting-boxes in their workshops and offices.\r\n\r\nAltogether during the last year the Society had received from various\r\nsources about three hundred pounds in hard cash.  This money was\r\ndevoted to the relief of cases of distress.\r\n\r\nThe largest item in the expenditure of the Society was the salary of\r\nthe General Secretary, Mr Sawney Grinder--a most deserving case--who\r\nwas paid one hundred pounds a year.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the previous secretary there were so many candidates\r\nfor the vacant post that the election of the new secretary was a rather\r\nexciting affair.  The excitement was all the more intense because it\r\nwas restrained.  A special meeting of the society was held: the Mayor,\r\nAlderman Sweater, presided, and amongst those present were Councillors\r\nRushton, Didlum and Grinder, Mrs Starvem, Rev. Mr Bosher, a number of\r\nthe rich, semi-imbecile old women who had helped to open the Labour\r\nYard, and several other \'ladies\'.  Some of these were the district\r\nvisitors already alluded to, most of them the wives of wealthy citizens\r\nand retired tradesmen, richly dressed, ignorant, insolent, overbearing\r\nfrumps, who--after filling themselves with good things in their own\r\nluxurious homes--went flouncing into the poverty-stricken dwellings of\r\ntheir poor \'sisters\' and talked to them of \'religion\', lectured them\r\nabout sobriety and thrift, and--sometimes--gave them tickets for soup\r\nor orders for shillingsworths of groceries or coal.  Some of these\r\noverfed females--the wives of tradesmen, for instance--belonged to the\r\nOrganized Benevolence Society, and engaged in this \'work\' for the\r\npurpose of becoming acquainted with people of superior social\r\nposition--one of the members was a colonel, and Sir Graball\r\nD\'Encloseland--the Member of Parliament for the borough--also belonged\r\nto the Society and occasionally attended its meetings.  Others took up\r\ndistrict visiting as a hobby; they had nothing to do, and being densely\r\nignorant and of inferior mentality, they had no desire or capacity for\r\nany intellectual pursuit.  So they took up this work for the pleasure\r\nof playing the grand lady and the superior person at a very small\r\nexpense.  Other of these visiting ladies were middle-aged, unmarried\r\nwomen with small private incomes--some of them well-meaning,\r\ncompassionate, gentle creatures who did this work because they\r\nsincerely desired to help others, and they knew of no better way. These\r\ndid not take much part in the business of the meetings; they paid their\r\nsubscriptions and helped to distribute the cast-off clothing and boots\r\nto those who needed them, and occasionally obtained from the secretary\r\nan order for provisions or coal or bread for some poverty-stricken\r\nfamily; but the poor, toil-worn women whom they visited welcomed them\r\nmore for their sisterly sympathy than for the gifts they brought.  Some\r\nof the visiting ladies were of this character--but they were not many.\r\nThey were as a few fragrant flowers amidst a dense accumulation of\r\nnoxious weeds.  They were examples of humility and kindness shining\r\namidst a vile and loathsome mass of hypocrisy, arrogance, and cant.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chairman had opened the meeting, Mr Rushton moved a vote of\r\ncondolence with the relatives of the late secretary whom he eulogized\r\nin the most extraordinary terms.\r\n\r\n\'The poor of Mugsborough had lost a kind and sympathetic friend\', \'One\r\nwho had devoted his life to helping the needy\', and so on and so forth.\r\n(As a matter of fact, most of the time of the defunct had been passed\r\nin helping himself, but Rushton said nothing about that.)\r\n\r\nMr Didlum seconded the vote of condolence in similar terms, and it was\r\ncarried unanimously.  Then the Chairman said that the next business was\r\nto elect a successor to the departed paragon; and immediately no fewer\r\nthan nine members rose to propose a suitable person--they each had a\r\nnoble-minded friend or relative willing to sacrifice himself for the\r\ngood of the poor.\r\n\r\nThe nine Benevolent stood looking at each other and at the Chairman\r\nwith sickly smiles upon their hypocritical faces.  It was a dramatic\r\nmoment.  No one spoke.  It was necessary to be careful.  It would never\r\ndo to have a contest.  The Secretary of the OBS was usually regarded as\r\na sort of philanthropist by the outside public, and it was necessary to\r\nkeep this fiction alive.\r\n\r\nFor one or two minutes an awkward silence reigned.  Then, one after\r\nanother they all reluctantly resumed their seats with the exception of\r\nMr Amos Grinder, who said he wished to propose his nephew, Mr Sawney\r\nGrinder, a young man of a most benevolent disposition who was desirous\r\nof immolating himself upon the altar of charity for the benefit of the\r\npoor--or words to that effect.\r\n\r\nMr Didlum seconded, and there being no other nomination--for they all\r\nknew that it would give the game away to have a contest--the Chairman\r\nput Mr Grinder\'s proposal to the meeting and declared it carried\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\nAnother considerable item in the expenditure of the society was the\r\nrent of the offices--a house in a back street.  The landlord of this\r\nplace was another very deserving case.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous other expenses: stationery and stamps, printing,\r\nand so on, and what was left of the money was used for the purpose for\r\nwhich it had been given--a reasonable amount being kept in hand for\r\nfuture expenses.  All the details were of course duly set forth in the\r\nReport and Balance Sheet at the annual meetings.  No copy of this\r\ndocument was ever handed to the reporters for publication; it was read\r\nto the meeting by the Secretary; the representatives of the Press took\r\nnotes, and in the reports of the meeting that subsequently appeared in\r\nthe local papers the thing was so mixed up and garbled together that\r\nthe few people who read it could not make head or tail of it.  The only\r\nthing that was clear was that the society had been doing a great deal\r\nof good to someone or other, and that more money was urgently needed to\r\ncarry on the work.  It usually appeared something like this:\r\n\r\n                            HELPING THE NEEDY\r\n                 Mugsborough Organized Benevolence Society\r\n                      Annual Meeting at the Town Hall\r\n\r\n           A Splendid record of Miscellaneous and Valuable Work.\r\n\r\n    The annual meeting of the above Society was held yesterday at the\r\n    Town Hall.  The Mayor, Alderman Sweater, presided, and amongst\r\n    those present were Sir Graball D\'Encloseland, Lady D\'Encloseland,\r\n    Lady Slumrent.  Rev. Mr Bosher, Mr Cheeseman, Mrs Bilder, Mrs\r\n    Grosare, Mrs Daree, Mrs Butcher, Mrs Taylor, Mrs Baker, Mrs\r\n    Starvem, Mrs Slodging, Mrs M. B. Sile, Mrs Knobrane, Mrs M. T.\r\n    Head, Mr Rushton, Mr Didlum, Mr Grinder and (here followed about a\r\n    quarter of a column of names of other charitable persons, all\r\n    subscribers to the Society).\r\n\r\n    The Secretary read the annual report which contained the following\r\n    amongst other interesting items:\r\n\r\n\r\n    During the year, 1,972 applications for assistance have been\r\n    received, and of this number 1,302 have been assisted as follows:\r\n    Bread or grocery orders, 273.  Coal or coke orders, 57.\r\n    Nourishment 579.  (Applause.)  Pairs of boots granted, 29.\r\n    Clothing, 105.  Crutch granted to poor man, 1.  Nurses provided,\r\n    2.   Hospital tickets, 26.   Sent to Consumption Sanatorium, 1.\r\n    Twenty-nine persons, whose cases being chronic, were referred to\r\n    the Poor Law Guardians.  Work found for 19 persons.  (Cheers.)\r\n    Pedlar\'s licences, 4.  Dispensary tickets, 24.  Bedding redeemed,\r\n    1. Loans granted to people to enable them to pay their rent, 8.\r\n    (Loud cheers.)  Dental tickets, 2.  Railway fares for men who were\r\n    going away from the town to employment elsewhere, 12.  (Great\r\n    cheering.)  Loans granted, 5.  Advertisements for employment, 4--\r\n    and so on.\r\n\r\nThere was about another quarter of a column of these details, the\r\nreading of which was punctuated with applause and concluded with:\r\n\'Leaving 670 cases which for various reasons the Society was unable to\r\nassist\'.  The report then went on to explain that the work of inquiring\r\ninto the genuineness of the applications entailed a lot of labour on\r\nthe part of the Secretary, some cases taking several days. No fewer\r\nthan 649 letters had been sent out from the office, and 97 postcards.\r\n(Applause.)  Very few cash gifts were granted, as it was most necessary\r\nto guard against the Charity being abused.  (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\nThen followed a most remarkable paragraph headed \'The Balance Sheet\',\r\nwhich--as it was put--\'included the following\'.  \'The following\' was a\r\njumbled list of items of expenditure, subscriptions, donations,\r\nlegacies, and collections, winding up with \'the general summary showed\r\na balance in hand of L178.4.6\'.  (They always kept a good balance in\r\nhand because of the Secretary\'s salary and the rent of the offices.)\r\n\r\nAfter this very explicit financial statement came the most important\r\npart of the report: \'Thanks are expressed to Sir Graball D\'Encloseland\r\nfor a donation of 2 guineas.  Mrs Grosare, 1 guinea.  Mrs Starvem,\r\nHospital tickets.  Lady Slumrent, letter of admission to Convalescent\r\nHome.  Mrs Knobrane, 1 guinea.  Mrs M.B. Sile, 1 guinea.  Mrs M.T.\r\nHead, 1 guinea.  Mrs Sledging, gifts of clothing--and so on for another\r\nquarter of a column, the whole concluding with a vote of thanks to the\r\nSecretary and an urgent appeal to the charitable public for more funds\r\nto enable the Society to continue its noble work.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in spite of this and kindred organizations the conditions of\r\nthe under-paid poverty stricken and unemployed workers remained the\r\nsame. Although the people who got the grocery and coal orders, the\r\n\'Nourishment\', and the cast-off clothes and boots, were very glad to\r\nhave them, yet these things did far more harm than good.  They\r\nhumiliated, degraded and pauperized those who received them, and the\r\nexistence of the societies prevented the problem being grappled with in\r\na sane and practical manner.  The people lacked the necessaries of\r\nlife: the necessaries of life are produced by Work: these people were\r\nwilling to work, but were prevented from doing so by the idiotic system\r\nof society which these \'charitable\' people are determined to do their\r\nbest to perpetuate.\r\n\r\nIf the people who expect to be praised and glorified for being\r\ncharitable were never to give another farthing it would be far better\r\nfor the industrious poor, because then the community as a whole would\r\nbe compelled to deal with the absurd and unnecessary state of affairs\r\nthat exists today--millions of people living and dying in wretchedness\r\nand poverty in an age when science and machinery have made it possible\r\nto produce such an abundance of everything that everyone might enjoy\r\nplenty and comfort.  It if were not for all this so-called charity the\r\nstarving unemployed men all over the country would demand to be allowed\r\nto work and produce the things they are perishing for want of, instead\r\nof being--as they are now--content to wear their masters\' cast-off\r\nclothing and to eat the crumbs that fall from his table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 37\r\n\r\nA Brilliant Epigram\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the winter, the wise, practical, philanthropic, fat persons\r\nwhom the people of Mugsborough had elected to manage their affairs--or\r\nwhom they permitted to manage them without being elected--continued to\r\ngrapple, or to pretend to grapple, with the \'problem\' of unemployment\r\nand poverty.  They continued to hold meetings, rummage and jumble\r\nsales, entertainments and special services.  They continued to\r\ndistribute the rotten cast-off clothing and boots, and the nourishment\r\ntickets.  They were all so sorry for the poor, especially for the \'dear\r\nlittle children\'.  They did all sorts of things to help the children.\r\nIn fact, there was nothing that they would not do for them except levy\r\na halfpenny rate.  It would never do to do that.  It might pauperize\r\nthe parents and destroy parental responsibility.  They evidently\r\nthought that it would be better to destroy the health or even the lives\r\nof the \'dear little children\' than to pauperize the parents or\r\nundermine parental responsibility.  These people seemed to think that\r\nthe children were the property of their parents.  They did not have\r\nsense enough to see that the children are not the property of their\r\nparents at all, but the property of the community.  When they attain to\r\nmanhood and womanhood they will be, if mentally or physically\r\ninefficient, a burden on the community; if they become criminals, they\r\nwill prey upon the community, and if they are healthy, educated and\r\nbrought up in good surroundings, they will become useful citizens, able\r\nto render valuable service, not merely to their parents, but to the\r\ncommunity. Therefore the children are the property of the community,\r\nand it is the business and to the interest of the community to see that\r\ntheir constitutions are not undermined by starvation.  The Secretary of\r\nthe local Trades Council, a body formed of delegates from all the\r\ndifferent trades unions in the town, wrote a letter to the Obscurer,\r\nsetting forth this view.  He pointed out that a halfpenny rate in that\r\ntown would produce a sum of L800, which would be more than sufficient\r\nto provide food for all the hungry schoolchildren.  In the next issue\r\nof the paper several other letters appeared from leading citizens,\r\nincluding, of course, Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, ridiculing\r\nthe proposal of the Trades Council, who were insultingly alluded to as\r\n\'pothouse politicians\', \'beer-sodden agitators\' and so forth.  Their\r\nright to be regarded as representatives of the working men was denied,\r\nand Grinder, who, having made inquiries amongst working men, was\r\nacquainted with the facts, stated that there was scarcely one of the\r\nlocal branches of the trades unions which had more than a dozen\r\nmembers; and as Grinder\'s statement was true, the Secretary was unable\r\nto contradict it.  The majority of the working men were also very\r\nindignant when they heard about the Secretary\'s letter: they said the\r\nrates were quite high enough as it was, and they sneered at him for\r\npresuming to write to the papers at all:\r\n\r\n\'Who the bloody \'ell was \'e?\' they said.  \'\'E was not a Gentleman!  \'E\r\nwas only a workin\' man the same as themselves--a common carpenter! What\r\nthe \'ell did \'e know about it?  Nothing.  \'E was just trying to make\r\n\'isself out to be Somebody, that was all.  The idea of one of the likes\r\nof them writing to the papers!\'\r\n\r\nOne day, having nothing better to do, Owen was looking at some books\r\nthat were exposed for sale on a table outside a second-hand furniture\r\nshop.  One book in particular took his attention: he read several pages\r\nwith great interest, and regretted that he had not the necessary\r\nsixpence to buy it.  The title of the book was: Consumption: Its Causes\r\nand Its Cure.  The author was a well-known physician who devoted his\r\nwhole attention to the study of that disease.  Amongst other things,\r\nthe book gave rules for the feeding of delicate children, and there\r\nwere also several different dietaries recommended for adult persons\r\nsuffering from the disease.  One of these dietaries amused him very\r\nmuch, because as far as the majority of those who suffer from\r\nconsumption are concerned, the good doctor might just as well have\r\nprescribed a trip to the moon:\r\n\r\n\'Immediately on waking in the morning, half a pint of milk--this should\r\nbe hot, if possible--with a small slice of bread and butter.\r\n\r\n\'At breakfast: half a pint of milk, with coffee, chocolate, or oatmeal:\r\neggs and bacon, bread and butter, or dry toast.\r\n\r\n\'At eleven o\'clock: half a pint of milk with an egg beaten up in it or\r\nsome beef tea and bread and butter.\r\n\r\n\'At one o\'clock: half a pint of warm milk with a biscuit or sandwich.\r\n\r\n\'At two o\'clock: fish and roast mutton, or a mutton chop, with as much\r\nfat as possible: poultry, game, etc., may be taken with vegetables, and\r\nmilk pudding.\r\n\r\n\'At five o\'clock: hot milk with coffee or chocolate, bread and butter,\r\nwatercress, etc.\r\n\r\n\'At eight o\'clock: a pint of milk, with oatmeal or chocolate, and\r\ngluten bread, or two lightly boiled eggs with bread and butter.\r\n\r\n\'Before retiring to rest: a glass of warm milk.\r\n\r\n\'During the night: a glass of milk with a biscuit or bread and butter\r\nshould be placed by the bedside and be eaten if the patient awakes.\'\r\n\r\nWhilst Owen was reading this book, Crass, Harlow, Philpot and Easton\r\nwere talking together on the other side of the street, and presently\r\nCrass caught sight of him.  They had been discussing the Secretary\'s\r\nletter re the halfpenny rate, and as Owen was one of the members of the\r\nTrades Council, Crass suggested that they should go across and tackle\r\nhim about it.\r\n\r\n\'How much is your house assessed at?\' asked Owen after listening for\r\nabout a quarter of an hour to Crass\'s objection.\r\n\r\n\'Fourteen pound,\' replied Crass.\r\n\r\n\'That means that you would have to pay sevenpence per year if we had a\r\nhalfpenny rate.  Wouldn\'t it be worth sevenpence a year to you to know\r\nthat there were no starving children in the town?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why should I \'ave to \'elp to keep the children of a man who\'s too lazy\r\nto work, or spends all \'is money on drink?\' shouted Crass.  \'\'Ow are\r\nyer goin\' to make out about the likes o\' them?\'\r\n\r\n\'If his children are starving we should feed them first, and punish him\r\nafterwards.\'\r\n\r\n\'The rates is quite high enough as it is,\' grumbled Harlow, who had\r\nfour children himself.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s quite true, but you must remember that the rates the working\r\nclasses at present pay are spent mostly for the benefit of other\r\npeople.  Good roads are maintained for people who ride in motor cars\r\nand carriages; the Park and the Town Band for those who have leisure to\r\nenjoy them; the Police force to protect the property of those who have\r\nsomething to lose, and so on.  But if we pay this rate we shall get\r\nsomething for our money.\'\r\n\r\n\'We gets the benefit of the good roads when we \'as to push a \'andcart\r\nwith a load o\' paint and ladders,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said Crass, \'and besides, the workin\' class gets the\r\nbenefit of all the other things too, because it all makes work.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, for my part,\' said Philpot, \'I wouldn\'t mind payin\' my share\r\ntowards a \'appeny rate, although I ain\'t got no kids o\' me own.\'\r\n\r\nThe hostility of most of the working men to the proposed rate was\r\nalmost as bitter as that of the \'better\' classes--the noble-minded\r\nphilanthropists who were always gushing out their sympathy for the\r\n\'dear little ones\', the loathsome hypocrites who pretended that there\r\nwas no need to levy a rate because they were willing to give sufficient\r\nmoney in the form of charity to meet the case: but the children\r\ncontinued to go hungry all the same.\r\n\r\n\'Loathsome hypocrites\' may seem a hard saying, but it was a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge that the majority of the children attending the local\r\nelementary schools were insufficiently fed.  It was admitted that the\r\nmoney that could be raised by a halfpenny rate would be more than\r\nsufficient to provide them all with one good meal every day.  The\r\ncharity-mongers who professed such extravagant sympathy with the \'dear\r\nlittle children\' resisted the levying of the rate \'because it would\r\npress so heavily on the poorer ratepayers\', and said that they were\r\nwilling to give more in voluntary charity than the rate would amount\r\nto: but, the \'dear little children\'--as they were so fond of calling\r\nthem--continued to go to school hungry all the same.\r\n\r\nTo judge them by their profession and their performances, it appeared\r\nthat these good kind persons were willing to do any mortal thing for\r\nthe \'dear little children\' except allow them to be fed.\r\n\r\nIf these people had really meant to do what they pretended, they would\r\nnot have cared whether they paid the money to a rate-collector or to\r\nthe secretary of a charity society and they would have preferred to\r\naccomplish their object in the most efficient and economical way.\r\n\r\nBut although they would not allow the children to be fed, they went to\r\nchurch and to chapel, glittering with jewellery, their fat carcases\r\nclothed in rich raiment, and sat with smug smiles upon their faces\r\nlistening to the fat parsons reading out of a Book that none of them\r\nseemed able to understand, for this was what they read:\r\n\r\n\'And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in the midst of\r\nthem, and said: Whosoever shall receive one such little child in My\r\nname, receiveth Me.  But whoso shall offend one of these little ones,\r\nit were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and\r\nthat he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\r\n\r\n\'Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say unto\r\nyou that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father.\'\r\n\r\nAnd this: \'Then shall He say unto them: Depart from me, ye cursed, into\r\nthe everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was\r\nan hungered and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty and ye gave Me no\r\ndrink: I was a stranger and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye clothed Me\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\'Then shall they answer: "Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered or athirst\r\nor a stranger or naked, or sick, and did not minister unto Thee?" and\r\nHe shall answer them, "Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not\r\nto one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me."\'\r\n\r\nThese were the sayings that the infidel parsons mouthed in the infidel\r\ntemples to the richly dressed infidel congregations, who heard but did\r\nnot understand, for their hearts were become gross and their ears dull\r\nof hearing.  And meantime, all around them, in the alley and the slum,\r\nand more terrible still--because more secret--in the better sort of\r\nstreets where lived the respectable class of skilled artisans, the\r\nlittle children became thinner and paler day by day for lack of proper\r\nfood, and went to bed early because there was no fire.\r\n\r\nSir Graball D\'Encloseland, the Member of Parliament for the borough,\r\nwas one of the bitterest opponents of the halfpenny rate, but as he\r\nthought it was probable that there would soon be another General\r\nElection and he wanted the children\'s fathers to vote for him again, he\r\nwas willing to do something for them in another way.  He had a\r\nten-year-old daughter whose birthday was in that month, so the\r\nkind-hearted Baronet made arrangements to give a Tea to all the school\r\nchildren in the town in honour of the occasion.  The tea was served in\r\nthe schoolrooms and each child was presented with a gilt-edged card on\r\nwhich was a printed portrait of the little hostess, with \'From your\r\nloving little friend, Honoria D\'Encloseland\', in gold letters. During\r\nthe evening the little girl, accompanied by Sir Graball and Lady\r\nD\'Encloseland, motored round to all the schools where the tea was being\r\nconsumed: the Baronet made a few remarks, and Honoria made a pretty\r\nlittle speech, specially learnt for the occasion, at each place, and\r\nthey were loudly cheered and greatly admired in response. The\r\nenthusiasm was not confined to the boys and girls, for while the\r\nspeechmaking was going on inside, a little crowd of grown-up children\r\nwere gathered round outside the entrance, worshipping the motor car:\r\nand when the little party came out the crowd worshipped them also,\r\ngoing into imbecile ecstasies of admiration of their benevolence and\r\ntheir beautiful clothes.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks everybody in the town was in raptures over this\r\ntea--or, rather, everybody except a miserable little minority of\r\nSocialists, who said it was bribery, an electioneering dodge, that did\r\nno real good, and who continued to clamour for a halfpenny rate.\r\n\r\nAnother specious fraud was the \'Distress Committee\'.  This body--or\r\ncorpse, for there was not much vitality in it--was supposed to exist\r\nfor the purpose of providing employment for \'deserving cases\'.  One\r\nmight be excused for thinking that any man--no matter what his past may\r\nhave been--who is willing to work for his living is a \'deserving case\':\r\nbut this was evidently not the opinion of the persons who devised the\r\nregulations for the working of this committee.  Every applicant for\r\nwork was immediately given a long job, and presented with a double\r\nsheet of foolscap paper to do it with.  Now, if the object of the\r\ncommittee had been to furnish the applicant with material for the\r\nmanufacture of an appropriate headdress for himself, no one could\r\nreasonably have found fault with them: but the foolscap was not to be\r\nutilized in that way; it was called a \'Record Paper\', three pages of it\r\nwere covered with insulting, inquisitive, irrelevant questions\r\nconcerning the private affairs and past life of the \'case\' who wished\r\nto be permitted to work for his living, and all these had to be\r\nanswered to the satisfaction of Messrs D\'Encloseland, Bosher, Sweater,\r\nRushton, Didlum, Grinder and the other members of the committee, before\r\nthe case stood any chance of getting employment.\r\n\r\nHowever, notwithstanding the offensive nature of the questions on the\r\napplication form, during the five months that this precious committee\r\nwas in session, no fewer than 1,237 broken-spirited and humble \'lion\'s\r\nwhelps\' filled up the forms and answered the questions as meekly as if\r\nthey had been sheep.  The funds of the committee consisted of L500,\r\nobtained from the Imperial Exchequer, and about L250 in charitable\r\ndonations.  This money was used to pay wages for certain work--some of\r\nwhich would have had to be done even if the committee had never\r\nexisted--and if each of the 1,237 applicants had had an equal share of\r\nthe work, the wages they would have received would have amounted to\r\nabout twelve shillings each.  This was what the \'practical\' persons,\r\nthe \'business-men\', called \'dealing with the problem of unemployment\'.\r\nImagine having to keep your family for five months with twelve\r\nshillings!\r\n\r\nAnd, if you like, imagine that the Government grant had been four times\r\nas much as it was, and that the charity had amounted to four times as\r\nmuch as it did, and then fancy having to keep your family for five\r\nmonths with two pounds eight shillings!\r\n\r\nIt is true that some of the members of the committee would have been\r\nvery glad if they had been able to put the means of earning a living\r\nwithin the reach of every man who was willing to work; but they simply\r\ndid not know what to do, or how to do it.  They were not ignorant of\r\nthe reality of the evil they were supposed to be \'dealing\r\nwith\'--appalling evidences of it faced them on every side, and as,\r\nafter all, these committee men were human beings and not devils, they\r\nwould have been glad to mitigate it if they could have done so without\r\nhurting themselves: but the truth was that they did not know what to do!\r\n\r\nThese are the \'practical\' men; the monopolists of intelligence, the\r\nwise individuals who control the affairs of the world: it is in\r\naccordance with the ideas of such men as these that the conditions of\r\nhuman life are regulated.\r\n\r\nThis is the position:\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that never before in the history of mankind was it\r\npossible to produce the necessaries of life in such abundance as at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe management of the affairs of the world--the business of arranging\r\nthe conditions under which we live--is at present in the hands of\r\nPractical, Level-headed, Sensible Business-men.\r\n\r\nThe result of their management is, that the majority of the people find\r\nit a hard struggle to live.  Large numbers exist in perpetual poverty:\r\na great many more periodically starve: many actually die of want:\r\nhundreds destroy themselves rather than continue to live and suffer.\r\n\r\nWhen the Practical, Level-headed, Sensible Business-men are asked why\r\nthey do not remedy this state of things, they reply that they do not\r\nknow what to do! or, that it is impossible to remedy it!\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is admitted that it is now possible to produce the\r\nnecessaries of life, in greater abundance than ever before!\r\n\r\nWith lavish kindness, the Supreme Being had provided all things\r\nnecessary for the existence and happiness of his creatures.  To suggest\r\nthat it is not so is a blasphemous lie: it is to suggest that the\r\nSupreme Being is not good or even just.  On every side there is an\r\noverflowing superfluity of the materials requisite for the production\r\nof all the necessaries of life: from these materials everything we need\r\nmay be produced in abundance--by Work.  Here was an army of people\r\nlacking the things that may be made by work, standing idle. Willing to\r\nwork; clamouring to be allowed to work, and the Practical,\r\nLevel-headed, Sensible Business-men did not know what to do!\r\n\r\nOf course, the real reason for the difficulty is that the raw materials\r\nthat were created for the use and benefit of all have been stolen by a\r\nsmall number, who refuse to allow them to be used for the purposes for\r\nwhich they were intended.  This numerically insignificant minority\r\nrefused to allow the majority to work and produce the things they need;\r\nand what work they do graciously permit to be done is not done with the\r\nobject of producing the necessaries of life for those who work, but for\r\nthe purpose of creating profit for their masters.\r\n\r\nAnd then, strangest fact of all, the people who find it a hard struggle\r\nto live, or who exist in dreadful poverty and sometimes starve, instead\r\nof trying to understand the causes of their misery and to find out a\r\nremedy themselves, spend all their time applauding the Practical,\r\nSensible, Level-headed Business-men, who bungle and mismanage their\r\naffairs, and pay them huge salaries for doing so.  Sir Graball\r\nD\'Encloseland, for instance, was a \'Secretary of State\' and was paid\r\nL5,000 a year.  When he first got the job the wages were only a\r\nbeggarly L2,000, but as he found it impossible to exist on less than\r\nL100 a week he decided to raise his salary to that amount; and the\r\nfoolish people who find it a hard struggle to live paid it willingly,\r\nand when they saw the beautiful motor car and the lovely clothes and\r\njewellery he purchased for his wife with the money, and heard the Great\r\nSpeech he made--telling them how the shortage of everything was caused\r\nby Over-production and Foreign Competition, they clapped their hands\r\nand went frantic with admiration.  Their only regret was that there\r\nwere no horses attached to the motor car, because if there had been,\r\nthey could have taken them out and harnessed themselves to it instead.\r\n\r\nNothing delighted the childish minds of these poor people so much as\r\nlistening to or reading extracts from the speeches of such men as\r\nthese; so in order to amuse them, every now and then, in the midst of\r\nall the wretchedness, some of the great statesmen made \'great speeches\'\r\nfull of cunning phrases intended to hoodwink the fools who had elected\r\nthem.  The very same week that Sir Graball\'s salary was increased to\r\nL5,000 a year, all the papers were full of a very fine one that he\r\nmade.  They appeared with large headlines like this:\r\n\r\n             GREAT SPEECH BY SIR GRABALL D\'ENCLOSELAND\r\n\r\n                          Brilliant Epigram!\r\n\r\n    None should have more than they need, whilst any have less than\r\n    they need!\r\n\r\nThe hypocrisy of such a saying in the mouth of a man who was drawing a\r\nsalary of five thousand pounds a year did not appear to occur to\r\nanyone.  On the contrary, the hired scribes of the capitalist Press\r\nwrote columns of fulsome admiration of the miserable claptrap, and the\r\nworking men who had elected this man went into raptures over the\r\n\'Brilliant Epigram\' as if it were good to eat.  They cut it out of the\r\npapers and carried it about with them: they showed it to each other:\r\nthey read it and repeated it to each other: they wondered at it and\r\nwere delighted with it, grinning and gibbering at each other in the\r\nexuberance of their imbecile enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe Distress Committee was not the only body pretending to \'deal\' with\r\nthe poverty \'problem\': its efforts were supplemented by all the other\r\nagencies already mentioned--the Labour Yard, the Rummage Sales, the\r\nOrganized Benevolence Society, and so on, to say nothing of a most\r\nbenevolent scheme originated by the management of Sweater\'s Emporium,\r\nwho announced in a letter that was published in the local Press that\r\nthey were prepared to employ fifty men for one week to carry sandwich\r\nboards at one shilling--and a loaf of bread--per day.\r\n\r\nThey got the men; some unskilled labourers, a few old, worn out\r\nartisans whom misery had deprived of the last vestiges of pride or\r\nshame; a number of habitual drunkards and loafers, and a non-descript\r\nlot of poor ragged old men--old soldiers and others of whom it would be\r\nimpossible to say what they had once been.\r\n\r\nThe procession of sandwich men was headed by the Semi-drunk and the\r\nBesotted Wretch, and each board was covered with a printed poster:\r\n\'Great Sale of Ladies\' Blouses now Proceeding at Adam Sweater\'s\r\nEmporium.\'\r\n\r\nBesides this artful scheme of Sweater\'s for getting a good\r\nadvertisement on the cheap, numerous other plans for providing\r\nemployment or alleviating the prevailing misery were put forward in the\r\ncolumns of the local papers and at the various meetings that were held.\r\nAny foolish, idiotic, useless suggestion was certain to receive\r\nrespectful attention; any crafty plan devised in his own interest or\r\nfor his own profit by one or other of the crew of sweaters and\r\nlandlords who controlled the town was sure to be approved of by the\r\nother inhabitants of Mugsborough, the majority of whom were persons of\r\nfeeble intellect who not only allowed themselves to be robbed and\r\nexploited by a few cunning scoundrels, but venerated and applauded them\r\nfor doing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 38\r\n\r\nThe Brigands\' Cave\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening in the drawing-room at \'The Cave\' there was a meeting of a\r\nnumber of the \'Shining Lights\' to arrange the details of a Rummage\r\nSale, that was to be held in aid of the unemployed.  It was an informal\r\naffair, and while they were waiting for the other luminaries, the early\r\narrivals, Messrs Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, Mr Oyley Sweater, the\r\nBorough Surveyor, Mr Wireman, the electrical engineer who had been\r\nengaged as an \'expert\' to examine and report on the Electric Light\r\nWorks, and two or three other gentlemen--all members of the Band--took\r\nadvantage of the opportunity to discuss a number of things they were\r\nmutually interested in, which were to be dealt with at the meeting of\r\nthe Town Council the next day.  First, there was the affair of the\r\nuntenanted Kiosk on the Grand Parade.  This building belonged to the\r\nCorporation, and \'The Cosy Corner Refreshment Coy.\' of which Mr Grinder\r\nwas the managing director, was thinking of hiring it to open as a\r\nhigh-class refreshment lounge, provided the Corporation would make\r\ncertain alterations and let the place at a reasonable rent. Another\r\nitem which was to be discussed at the Council meeting was Mr Sweater\'s\r\ngenerous offer to the Corporation respecting the new drain connecting\r\n\'The Cave\' with the Town Main.\r\n\r\nThe report of Mr Wireman, the electrical expert, was also to be dealt\r\nwith, and afterwards a resolution in favour of the purchase of the\r\nMugsborough Electric light and Installation Co. Ltd by the town, was to\r\nbe proposed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these matters, several other items, including a proposal\r\nby Mr Didlum for an important reform in the matter of conducting the\r\nmeetings of the Council, formed subjects for animated conversation\r\nbetween the brigands and their host.\r\n\r\nDuring this discussion other luminaries arrived, including several\r\nladies and the Rev. Mr Bosher, of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room of \'The Cave\' was now elaborately furnished.  A large\r\nmirror in a richly gilt frame reached from the carved marble\r\nmantelpiece to the cornice.  A magnificent clock in an alabaster case\r\nstood in the centre of the mantelpiece and was flanked by two\r\nexquisitely painted and gilded vases of Dresden ware.  The windows were\r\ndraped with costly hangings, the floor was covered with a luxurious\r\ncarpet and expensive rugs.  Sumptuously upholstered couches and easy\r\nchairs added to the comfort of the apartment, which was warmed by the\r\nimmense fire of coal and oak logs that blazed and crackled in the grate.\r\n\r\nThe conversation now became general and at times highly philosophical\r\nin character, although Mr Bosher did not take much part, being too\r\nbusily engaged gobbling up the biscuits and tea, and only occasionally\r\nspluttering out a reply when a remark or question was directly\r\naddressed to him.\r\n\r\nThis was Mr Grinder\'s first visit at the house, and he expressed his\r\nadmiration of the manner in which the ceiling and the walls were\r\ndecorated, remarking that he had always liked this \'ere Japanese style.\r\n\r\nMr Bosher, with his mouth full of biscuit, mumbled that it was sweetly\r\npretty--charming--beautifully done--must have cost a lot of money.\r\n\r\n\'Hardly wot you\'d call Japanese, though, is it?\' observed Didlum,\r\nlooking round with the air of a connoisseur.  \'I should be inclined to\r\nsay it was rather more of the--er--Chinese or Egyptian.\'\r\n\r\n\'Moorish,\' explained Mr Sweater with a smile.  \'I got the idear at the\r\nParis Exhibition.  It\'s simler to the decorations in the "Halambara",\r\nthe palace of the Sultan of Morocco.  That clock there is in the same\r\nstyle.\'\r\n\r\nThe case of the clock referred to--which stood on a table in a corner\r\nof the room--was of fretwork, in the form of an Indian Mosque, with a\r\npointed dome and pinnacles.  This was the case that Mary Linden had\r\nsold to Didlum; the latter had had it stained a dark colour and\r\npolished and further improved it by substituting a clock of more\r\nsuitable design than the one it originally held.  Mr Sweater had\r\nnoticed it in Didlum\'s window and, seeing that the design was similar\r\nin character to the painted decorations on the ceiling and walls of his\r\ndrawing-room, had purchased it.\r\n\r\n\'I went to the Paris Exhibition meself,\' said Grinder, when everyone\r\nhad admired the exquisite workmanship of the clock-case.  \'I remember\r\n\'avin\' a look at the moon through that big telescope.  I was never so\r\nsurprised in me life: you can see it quite plain, and it\'s round!\'\r\n\r\n\'Round?\' said Didlum with a puzzled look.  \'Round?  Of course it\'s\r\nround!  You didn\'t used to think it was square, did yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, of course not, but I always used to think it was flat--like a\r\nplate, but it\'s round like a football.\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly: the moon is a very simler body to the earth,\' explained\r\nDidlum, describing an aerial circle with a wave of his hand.  They\r\nmoves through the air together, but the earth is always nearest to the\r\nsun and consequently once a fortnight the shadder of the earth falls on\r\nthe moon and darkens it so that it\'s invisible to the naked eye. The\r\nnew moon is caused by the moon movin\' a little bit out of the earth\'s\r\nshadder, and it keeps on comin\' more and more until we gets the full\r\nmoon; and then it goes back again into the shadder; and so it keeps on.\'\r\n\r\nFor about a minute everyone looked very solemn, and the profound\r\nsilence was disturbed only the the crunching of the biscuits between\r\nthe jaws of Mr Bosher, and by certain gurglings in the interior of that\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\'Science is a wonderful thing,\' said Mr Sweater at length, wagging his\r\nhead gravely, \'wonderful!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: but a lot of it is mere theory, you know,\' observed Rushton.\r\n\'Take this idear that the world is round, for instance; I fail to see\r\nit!  And then they say as Hawstralia is on the other side of the globe,\r\nunderneath our feet. In my opinion it\'s ridiculous, because if it was\r\ntrue, wot\'s to prevent the people droppin\' orf?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: well, of course it\'s very strange,\' admitted Sweater.  \'I\'ve\r\noften thought of that myself.  If it was true, we ought to be able to\r\nwalk on the ceiling of this room, for instance; but of course we know\r\nthat\'s impossible, and I really don\'t see that the other is any more\r\nreasonable.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve often noticed flies walkin\' on the ceilin\',\' remarked Didlum, who\r\nfelt called upon to defend the globular theory.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; but they\'re different,\' replied Rushton.  \'Flies is provided by\r\nnature with a gluey substance which oozes out of their feet for the\r\npurpose of enabling them to walk upside down.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s one thing that seems to me to finish that idear once for all,\'\r\nsaid Grinder, \'and that is--water always finds its own level. You can\'t\r\nget away from that; and if the world was round, as they want us to\r\nbelieve, all the water would run off except just a little at the top.\r\nTo my mind, that settles the whole argymint.\'\r\n\r\n\'Another thing that gets over me,\' continued Rushton, \'is this:\r\naccording to science, the earth turns round on its axle at the rate of\r\ntwenty miles a minit.  Well, what about when a lark goes up in the sky\r\nand stays there about a quarter of an hour?  Why, if it was true that\r\nthe earth was turnin\' round at that rate all the time, when the bird\r\ncame down it would find itself \'undreds of miles away from the place\r\nwhere it went up from!  But that doesn\'t \'appen at all; the bird always\r\ncomes down in the same spot.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and the same thing applies to balloons and flyin\' machines,\' said\r\nGrinder.  \'If it was true that the world is spinnin\' round on its axle\r\nso quick as that, if a man started out from Calais to fly to Dover, by\r\nthe time he got to England he\'d find \'imself in North America, or\r\np\'r\'aps farther off still.\'\r\n\r\n\'And if it was true that the world goes round the sun at the rate they\r\nmakes out, when a balloon went up, the earth would run away from it!\r\nThey\'d never be able to get back again!\' remarked Rushton.\r\n\r\nThis was so obvious that nearly everyone said there was probably\r\nsomething in it, and Didlum could think of no reply.  Mr Bosher upon\r\nbeing appealed to for his opinion, explained that science was alright\r\nin its way, but unreliable: the things scientists said yesterday they\r\ncontradicted today, and what they said today they would probably\r\nrepudiate tomorrow.  It was necessary to be very cautious before\r\naccepting any of their assertions.\r\n\r\n\'Talking about science,\' said Grinder, as the holy man relapsed into\r\nsilence and started on another biscuit and a fresh cup of tea. \'Talking\r\nabout science reminds me of a conversation I \'ad with Dr Weakling the\r\nother day.  You know, he believes we\'re all descended from monkeys.\'\r\n\r\nEveryone laughed; the thing was so absurd: the idea of placing\r\nintellectual beings on a level with animals!\r\n\r\n\'But just wait till you hear how nicely I flattened \'im out,\' continued\r\nGrinder.  \'After we\'d been arguin\' a long time about wot \'e called\r\neverlution or some sich name, and a lot more tommy-rot that I couldn\'t\r\nmake no \'ead or tail of--and to tell you the truth I don\'t believe \'e\r\nunderstood \'arf of it \'imself--I ses to \'im, "Well," I ses, "if it\'s\r\ntrue that we\'re hall descended from monkeys," I ses, "I think your\r\nfamly must \'ave left orf where mine begun."\'\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the laughter that greeted the conclusion of Grinder\'s\r\nstory it was seen that Mr Bosher had become black in the face.  He was\r\nwaving his arms and writhing about like one in a fit, his goggle eyes\r\nbursting from their sockets, whilst his huge stomach quivering\r\nspasmodically, alternately contracted and expanded as if it were about\r\nto explode.\r\n\r\nIn the exuberance of his mirth, the unfortunate disciple had swallowed\r\ntwo biscuits at once.  Everybody rushed to his assistance, Grinder and\r\nDidlum seized an arm and a shoulder each and forced his head down.\r\nRushton punched him in the back and the ladies shrieked with alarm.\r\nThey gave him a big drink of tea to help to get the biscuits down, and\r\nwhen he at last succeeded in swallowing them he sat in the armchair\r\nwith his eyes red-rimmed and full of tears, which ran down over his\r\nwhite, flabby face.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the other members of the committee put an end to the\r\ninteresting discussion, and they shortly afterwards proceeded with the\r\nbusiness for which the meeting had been called--the arrangements for\r\nthe forthcoming Rummage Sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 39\r\n\r\nThe Brigands at Work\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, at the meeting of the Town Council, Mr Wireman\'s report\r\nconcerning the Electric Light Works was read.  The expert\'s opinion was\r\nso favourable--and it was endorsed by the Borough Engineer, Mr Oyley\r\nSweater--that a resolution was unanimously carried in favour of\r\nacquiring the Works for the town, and a secret committee was appointed\r\nto arrange the preliminaries.  Alderman Sweater then suggested that a\r\nsuitable honorarium be voted to Mr Wireman for his services.  This was\r\ngreeted with a murmur of approval from most of the members, and Mr\r\nDidlum rose with the intention of proposing a resolution to that effect\r\nwhen he was interrupted by Alderman Grinder, who said he couldn\'t see\r\nno sense in giving the man a thing like that.  \'Why not give him a sum\r\nof money?\'\r\n\r\nSeveral members said \'Hear, hear,\' to this, but some of the others\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t see nothing to laugh at,\' cried Grinder angrily.  \'For my part\r\nI wouldn\'t give you tuppence for all the honorariums in the country.  I\r\nmove that we pay \'im a sum of money.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll second that,\' said another member of the Band--one of those who\r\nhad cried \'Hear, Hear.\'\r\n\r\nAlderman Sweater said that there seemed to be a little misunderstanding\r\nand explained that an honorarium WAS a sum of money.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, well, in that case I\'ll withdraw my resolution,\' said Grinder. \'I\r\nthought you wanted to give \'im a \'luminated address or something like\r\nthat.\'\r\n\r\nDidlum now moved that a letter of thanks and a fee of fifty guineas be\r\nvoted to Mr Wireman, and this was also unanimously agreed to.  Dr\r\nWeakling said that it seemed rather a lot, but he did not go so far as\r\nto vote against it.\r\n\r\nThe next business was the proposal that the Corporation should take\r\nover the drain connecting Mr Sweater\'s house with the town main.  Mr\r\nSweater--being a public-spirited man--proposed to hand this connecting\r\ndrain--which ran through a private road--over to the Corporation to be\r\ntheirs and their successors for ever, on condition that they would pay\r\nhim the cost of construction--L55--and agreed to keep it in proper\r\nrepair.  After a brief discussion it was decided to take over the drain\r\non the terms offered, and then Councillor Didlum proposed a vote of\r\nthanks to Alderman Sweater for his generosity in the matter: this was\r\npromptly seconded by Councillor Rushton and would have been carried\r\nnem. con., but for the disgraceful conduct of Dr Weakling, who had the\r\nbad taste to suggest that the amount was about double what the drain\r\ncould possibly have cost to construct, that it was of no use to the\r\nCorporation at all, and that they would merely acquire the liability to\r\nkeep it in repair.\r\n\r\nHowever, no one took the trouble to reply to Weakling, and the Band\r\nproceeded to the consideration of the next business, which was Mr\r\nGrinder\'s offer--on behalf of the \'Cosy Corner Refreshment Company\'--to\r\ntake the Kiosk on the Grand Parade.  Mr Grinder submitted a plan of\r\ncertain alterations that he would require the Corporation to make at\r\nthe Kiosk, and, provided the Council agreed to do this work he was\r\nwilling to take a lease of the place for five years at L20 per year.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Didlum proposed that the offer of the \'Cosy Corner\r\nRefreshment Co. Ltd\' be accepted and the required alterations proceeded\r\nwith at once.  The Kiosk had brought in no rent for nearly two years,\r\nbut, apart from that consideration, if they accepted this offer they\r\nwould be able to set some of the unemployed to work. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Rushton seconded.\r\n\r\nDr Weakling pointed out that as the proposed alterations would cost\r\nabout L175--according to the estimate of the Borough Engineer--and, the\r\nrent being only L20 a year, it would mean that the Council would be L75\r\nout of pocket at the end of the five years; to say nothing of the\r\nexpense of keeping the place in repair during all that time.\r\n(Disturbance.)  He moved as an amendment that the alterations be made,\r\nand that they then invite tenders, and let the place to the highest\r\nbidder.  (Great uproar.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Rushton said he was disgusted with the attitude taken up by\r\nthat man Weakling.  (Applause.)  Perhaps it was hardly right to call\r\nhim a man.  (Hear! Hear!)  In the matter of these alterations they had\r\nhad the use of Councillor Grinder\'s brains: it was he who first thought\r\nof making these improvements in the Kiosk, and therefore he--or rather\r\nthe company he represented--had a moral right to the tenancy.  (Loud\r\ncheers.)\r\n\r\nDr Weakling said that he thought it was understood that when a man was\r\nelected to that Council it was because he was supposed to be willing to\r\nuse his brains for the benefit of his constituents.  (Sardonic\r\nlaughter.)\r\n\r\nThe Mayor asked if there was any seconder to Weakling\'s amendment, and\r\nas there was not the original proposition was put and carried.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Rushton suggested that a large shelter with seating\r\naccommodation for about two hundred persons should be erected on the\r\nGrand Parade near the Kiosk.  The shelter would serve as a protection\r\nagainst rain, or the rays of the sun in summer.  It would add\r\nmaterially to the comfort of visitors and would be a notable addition\r\nto the attractions of the town.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Didlum said it was a very good idear, and proposed that the\r\nSurveyor be instructed to get out the plans.\r\n\r\nDr Weakling opposed the motion.  (Laughter.)  It seemed to him that the\r\nobject was to benefit, not the town, but Mr Grinder. (Disturbance.)  If\r\nthis shelter were erected, it would increase the value of the Kiosk as\r\na refreshment bar by a hundred per cent.  If Mr Grinder wanted a\r\nshelter for his customers he should pay for it himself.  (Uproar.)  He\r\n(Dr Weakling) was sorry to have to say it, but he could not help\r\nthinking that this was a Put-up job.  (Loud cries of \'Withdraw\'\r\n\'Apologize\' \'Cast \'im out\' and terrific uproar.)\r\n\r\nWeakling did not apologize or withdraw, but he said no more.  Didlum\'s\r\nproposition was carried, and the \'Band\' went on to the next item on the\r\nagenda, which was a proposal by Councillor Didlum to increase the\r\nsalary of Mr Oyley Sweater, the Borough Engineer, from fifteen pounds\r\nto seventeen pounds per week.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Didlum said that when they had a good man they ought to\r\nappreciate him.  (Applause.)  Compared with other officials, the\r\nBorough Engineer was not fairly paid.  (Hear, hear.)  The magistrates\'\r\nclerk received seventeen pounds a week.  The Town Clerk seventeen\r\npounds per week.  He did not wish it to be understood that he thought\r\nthose gentlemen were overpaid--far from it.  (Hear, hear.)  It was not\r\nthat they got too much but that the Engineer got too little.  How could\r\nthey expect a man like that to exist on a paltry fifteen pounds a week?\r\nWhy, it was nothing more or less than sweating!  (Hear, hear.)  He had\r\nmuch pleasure in moving that the Borough Engineer\'s salary be increased\r\nto seventeen pounds a week, and that his annual holiday be extended\r\nfrom a fortnight to one calendar month with hard la--he begged\r\npardon--with full pay.  (Loud cheers.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Rushton said that he did not propose to make a long\r\nspeech--it was not necessary.  He would content himself with formally\r\nseconding Councillor Didlum\'s excellent proposition.  (Applause.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Weakling, whose rising was greeted with derisive laughter,\r\nsaid he must oppose the resolution.  He wished it to be understood that\r\nhe was not actuated by any feeling of personal animosity towards the\r\nBorough Engineer, but at the same time he considered it his duty to say\r\nthat in his (Dr Weakling\'s) opinion, that official would be dear at\r\nhalf the price they were now paying him.  (Disturbance.)  He did not\r\nappear to understand his business, nearly all the work that was done\r\ncost in the end about double what the Borough Engineer estimated it\r\ncould be done for.  (Liar.)  He considered him to be a grossly\r\nincompetent person (uproar) and was of opinion that if they were to\r\nadvertise they could get dozens of better men who would be glad to do\r\nthe work for five pounds a week.  He moved that Mr Oyley Sweater be\r\nasked to resign and that they advertise for a man at five pounds a\r\nweek.  (Great uproar.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Grinder rose to a point of order. He appealed to the\r\nChairman to squash the amendment.  (Applause.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Didlum remarked that he supposed Councillor Grinder meant\r\n\'quash\': in that case, he would support the suggestion.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Grinder said it was about time they put a stopper on that\r\nfeller Weakling.  He (Grinder) did not care whether they called it\r\nsquashing or quashing; it was all the same so long as they nipped him\r\nin the bud.  (Cheers.)  The man was a disgrace to the Council; always\r\ninterfering and hindering the business.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor--Alderman Sweater--said that he did not think it consistent\r\nwith the dignity of that Council to waste any more time over this\r\nscurrilous amendment.  (Applause.)  He was proud to say that it had\r\nnever even been seconded, and therefore he would put Mr Didlum\'s\r\nresolution--a proposition which he had no hesitation in saying\r\nreflected the highest credit upon that gentleman and upon all those who\r\nsupported it.  (Vociferous cheers.)\r\n\r\nAll those who were in favour signified their approval in the customary\r\nmanner, and as Weakling was the only one opposed, the resolution was\r\ncarried and the meeting proceeded to the next business.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Rushton said that several influential ratepayers and\r\nemployers of labour had complained to him about the high wages of the\r\nCorporation workmen, some of whom were paid sevenpence-halfpenny an\r\nhour.  Sevenpence an hour was the maximum wage paid to skilled workmen\r\nby private employers in that town, and he failed to see why the\r\nCorporation should pay more.  (Hear, hear.)  It had a very bad effect\r\non the minds of the men in the employment of private firms, tending to\r\nmake them dissatisfied with their wages.  The same state of affairs\r\nprevailed with regard to the unskilled labourers in the Council\'s\r\nemployment.  Private employers could get that class of labour for\r\nfourpence-halfpenny or fivepence an hour, and yet the corporation paid\r\nfivepence-halfpenny and even sixpence for the same class of work.\r\n(Shame.)  It was not fair to the ratepayers.  (Hear, hear.) Considering\r\nthat the men in the employment of the Corporation had almost constant\r\nwork, if there was to be a difference at all, they should get not more,\r\nbut less, than those who worked for private firms.  (Cheers.)  He moved\r\nthat the wages of the Corporation workmen be reduced in all cases to\r\nthe same level as those paid by private firms.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Grinder seconded.  He said it amounted to a positive\r\nscandal.  Why, in the summer-time some of these men drew as much as\r\n35/- in a single week!  (Shame.) and it was quite common for unskilled\r\nlabourers--fellers who did nothing but the very hardest and most\r\nlaborious work, sich as carrying sacks of cement, or digging up the\r\nroads to get at the drains, and sich-like easy jobs--to walk off with\r\n25/- a week!  (Sensation.)  He had often noticed some of these men\r\nswaggering about the town on Sundays, dressed like millionaires and\r\ncigared up!  They seemed quite a different class of men from those who\r\nworked for private firms, and to look at the way some of their children\r\nwas dressed you\'d think their fathers was Cabinet Minstrels! No wonder\r\nthe ratepayers complained ot the high rates.  Another grievance was\r\nthat all the Corporation workmen were allowed two days\' holiday every\r\nyear, in addition to the Bank Holidays, and were paid for them!  (Cries\r\nof \'shame\', \'Scandalous\', \'Disgraceful\', etc.)  No private contractor\r\npaid his men for Bank Holidays, and why should the Corporation do so?\r\nHe had much pleasure in seconding Councillor Rushton\'s resolution.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Weakling opposed the motion. He thought that 35/- a week was\r\nlittle enough for a man to keep a wife and family with (Rot), even if\r\nall the men got it regularly, which they did not.  Members should\r\nconsider what was the average amount per week throughout the whole\r\nyear, not merely the busy time, and if they did that they would find\r\nthat even the skilled men did not average more than 25/- a week, and in\r\nmany cases not so much.  If this subject had not been introduced by\r\nCouncillor Rushton, he (Dr Weakling) had intended to propose that the\r\nwages of the Corporation workmen should be increased to the standard\r\nrecognized by the Trades Unions.  (Loud laughter.)  It had been proved\r\nthat the notoriously short lives of the working people--whose average\r\nspan of life was about twenty years less than that of the well-to-do\r\nclasses--their increasingly inferior physique, and the high rate of\r\nmortality amongst their children was caused by the wretched\r\nremuneration they received for hard and tiring work, the excessive\r\nnumber of hours they have to work, when employed, the bad quality of\r\ntheir food, the badly constructed and insanitary homes their poverty\r\ncompels them to occupy, and the anxiety, worry, and depression of mind\r\nthey have to suffer when out of employment.  (Cries of \'Rot\', \'Bosh\',\r\nand loud laughter.)  Councillor Didlum said, \'Rot\'.  It was a very good\r\nword to describe the disease that was sapping the foundations of\r\nsociety and destroying the health and happiness and the very lives of\r\nso many of their fellow countrymen and women.  (Renewed merriment and\r\nshouts of \'Go and buy a red tie.\')  He appealed to the members to\r\nreject the resolution.  He was very glad to say that he believed it was\r\ntrue that the workmen in the employ of the Corporation were a little\r\nbetter off than those in the employ of private contractors, and if it\r\nwere so, it was as it should be.  They had need to be better off than\r\nthe poverty-stricken, half-starved poor wretches who worked for private\r\nfirms.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Didlum said that it was very evident that Dr Weakling had\r\nobtained his seat on that Council by false pretences.  If he had told\r\nthe ratepayers that he was a Socialist, they would never have elected\r\nhim.  (Hear, hear.)  Practically every Christian minister in the\r\ncountry would agree with him (Didlum) when he said that the poverty of\r\nthe working classes was caused not by the \'wretched remuneration they\r\nreceive as wages\', but by Drink.  (Loud applause.)  And he was very\r\nsure that the testimony of the clergy of all denominations was more to\r\nbe relied upon than the opinion of a man like Dr Weakling.  (Hear,\r\nhear.)\r\n\r\nDr Weakling said that if some of the clergymen referred to or some of\r\nthe members of the council had to exist and toil amid the same sordid\r\nsurroundings, overcrowding and ignorance as some of the working\r\nclasses, they would probably seek to secure some share of pleasure and\r\nforgetfulness in drink themselves!  (Great uproar and shouts of\r\n\'Order\', \'Withdraw\', \'Apologize\'.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Grinder said that even if it was true that the haverage\r\nlives of the working classes was twenty years shorter than those of the\r\nbetter classes, he could not see what it had got to do with Dr\r\nWeakling.  (Hear, hear.)  So long as the working class was contented to\r\ndie twenty years before their time, he failed to see what it had got to\r\ndo with other people.  They was not runnin\' short of workers, was they?\r\nThere was still plenty of \'em left.  (Laughter.)  So long as the\r\nworkin\' class was satisfied to die orf--let \'em die orf!  It was a free\r\ncountry.  (Applause.)  The workin\' class adn\'t arst Dr Weakling to\r\nstick up for them, had they?  If they wasn\'t satisfied, they would\r\nstick up for theirselves!  The working men didn\'t want the likes of Dr\r\nWeakling to stick up for them, and they would let \'im know it when the\r\nnext election came round.  If he (Grinder) was a wordly man, he would\r\nnot mind betting that the workin\' men of Dr Weakling\'s ward would give\r\nhim \'the dirty kick out\' next November.  (Applause.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Weakling, who knew that this was probably true, made no\r\nfurther protest.  Rushton\'s proposition was carried, and then the Clerk\r\nannounced that the next item was the resolution Mr Didlum had given\r\nnotice of at the last meeting, and the Mayor accordingly called upon\r\nthat gentleman.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Didlum, who was received with loud cheers, said that\r\nunfortunately a certain member of that Council seemed to think he had a\r\nright to oppose nearly everything that was brought forward.\r\n\r\n(The majority of the members of the Band glared malignantly at\r\nWeakling.)\r\n\r\nHe hoped that for once the individual he referred to would have the\r\ndecency to restrain himself, because the resolution he (Didlum) was\r\nabout to have the honour of proposing was one that he believed no\r\nright-minded man--no matter what his politics or religious\r\nopinions--could possibly object to; and he trusted that for the credit\r\nof the Council it would be entered on the records as an unopposed\r\nmotion. The resolution was as follows:\r\n\r\n\'That from this date all the meetings of this Council shall be opened\r\nwith prayer and closed with the singing of the Doxology.\' (Loud\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\nCouncillor Rushton seconded the resolution, which was also supported by\r\nMr Grinder, who said that at a time like the present, when there was\r\nsich a lot of infiddles about who said that we all came from monkeys,\r\nthe Council would be showing a good example to the working classes by\r\nadopting the resolution.\r\n\r\nCouncillor Weakling said nothing, so the new rule was carried nem.\r\ncon., and as there was no more business to be done it was put into\r\noperation for the first time there and then.  Mr Sweater conducting the\r\nsinging with a roll of paper--the plan of the drain of \'The Cave\'--and\r\neach member singing a different tune.\r\n\r\nWeakling withdrew during the singing, and afterwards, before the Band\r\ndispersed, it was agreed that a certain number of them were to meet the\r\nChief at the Cave, on the following evening to arrange the details of\r\nthe proposed raid on the finances of the town in connection with the\r\nsale of the Electric Light Works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 40\r\n\r\nVive la System!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alterations which the Corporation had undertaken to make in the\r\nKiosk on the Grand Parade provided employment for several carpenters\r\nand plasterers for about three weeks, and afterwards for several\r\npainters.  This fact was sufficient to secure the working men\'s\r\nunqualified approval of the action of the Council in letting the place\r\nto Grinder, and Councillor Weakling\'s opposition--the reasons of which\r\nthey did not take the trouble to inquire into or understand--they as\r\nheartily condemned.  All they knew or cared was that he had tried to\r\nprevent the work being done, and that he had referred in insulting\r\nterms to the working men of the town.  What right had he to call them\r\nhalf-starved, poverty-stricken, poor wretches?  If it came to being\r\npoverty-stricken, according to all accounts, he wasn\'t any too well orf\r\nhisself.  Some of those blokes who went swaggering about in frock-coats\r\nand pot-\'ats was just as \'ard up as anyone else if the truth was known.\r\n\r\nAs for the Corporation workmen, it was quite right that their wages\r\nshould be reduced.  Why should they get more money than anyone else?\r\n\r\n\'It\'s us what\'s got to find the money,\' they said.  \'We\'re the\r\nratepayers, and why should we have to pay them more wages than we get\r\nourselves?  And why should they be paid for holidays any more than us?\'\r\n\r\nDuring the next few weeks the dearth of employment continued, for, of\r\ncourse, the work at the Kiosk and the few others jobs that were being\r\ndone did not make much difference to the general situation.  Groups of\r\nworkmen stood at the corners or walked aimlessly about the streets.\r\nMost of them no longer troubled to go to the different firms to ask for\r\nwork, they were usually told that they would be sent for if wanted.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Owen did his best to convert the other men to his\r\nviews.  He had accumulated a little library of Socialist books and\r\npamphlets which he lent to those he hoped to influence.  Some of them\r\ntook these books and promised, with the air of men who were conferring\r\na great favour, that they would read them.  As a rule, when they\r\nreturned them it was with vague expressions of approval, but they\r\nusually evinced a disinclination to discuss the contents in detail\r\nbecause, in nine instances out of ten, they had not attempted to read\r\nthem.  As for those who did make a half-hearted effort to do so, in the\r\nmajority of cases their minds were so rusty and stultified by long\r\nyears of disuse, that, although the pamphlets were generally written in\r\nsuch simple language that a child might have understood, the argument\r\nwas generally too obscure to be grasped by men whose minds were addled\r\nby the stories told them by their Liberal and Tory masters.  Some, when\r\nOwen offered to lend them some books or pamphlets refused to accept\r\nthem, and others who did him the great favour of accepting them,\r\nafterwards boasted that they had used them as toilet paper.\r\n\r\nOwen frequently entered into long arguments with the other men, saying\r\nthat it was the duty of the State to provide productive work for all\r\nthose who were willing to do it.  Some few of them listened like men\r\nwho only vaguely understood, but were willing to be convinced.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, mate. It\'s right enough what you say,\' they would remark.\r\n\'Something ought to be done.\'\r\n\r\nOthers ridiculed this doctrine of State employment: It was all very\r\nfine, but where was the money to come from?  And then those who had\r\nbeen disposed to agree with Owen could relapse into their old apathy.\r\n\r\nThere were others who did not listen so quietly, but shouted with many\r\ncurses that it was the likes of such fellows as Owen who were\r\nresponsible for all the depression in trade.  All this talk about\r\nSocialism and State employment was frightening Capital out of the\r\ncountry.  Those who had money were afraid to invest it in industries,\r\nor to have any work done for fear they would be robbed.  When Owen\r\nquoted statistics to prove that as far as commerce and the quantity\r\nproduced of commodities of all kinds was concerned, the last year had\r\nbeen a record one, they became more infuriated than ever, and talked\r\nthreateningly of what they would like to do to those bloody Socialists\r\nwho were upsetting everything.\r\n\r\nOne day Crass, who was one of these upholders of the existing system,\r\nscored off Owen finely.  A little group of them were standing talking\r\nin the Wage Slave Market near the Fountain.  In the course of the\r\nargument, Owen made the remark that under existing conditions life was\r\nnot worth living, and Crass said that if he really thought so, there\r\nwas no compulsion about it; if he wasn\'t satisfied--if he didn\'t want\r\nto live--he could go and die.  Why the hell didn\'t he go and make a\r\nhole in the water, or cut his bloody throat?\r\n\r\nOn this particular occasion the subject of the argument was--at\r\nfirst--the recent increase of the Borough Engineer\'s salary to\r\nseventeen pounds per week.  Owen had said it was robbery, but the\r\nmajority of the others expressed their approval of the increase.  They\r\nasked Owen if he expected a man like that to work for nothing!  It was\r\nnot as if he were one of the likes of themselves.  They said that, as\r\nfor it being robbery, Owen would be very glad to have the chance of\r\ngetting it himself.  Most of them seemed to think the fact that anyone\r\nwould be glad to have seventeen pounds a week, proved that it was right\r\nfor them to pay that amount to the Borough Engineer!\r\n\r\nUsually whenever Owen reflected upon the gross injustices, and\r\ninhumanity of the existing social disorder, he became convinced that it\r\ncould not possibly last; it was bound to fall to pieces because of its\r\nown rottenness.  It was not just, it was not common sense, and\r\ntherefore it could not endure.  But always after one of these\r\narguments--or, rather, disputes--with his fellow workmen, he almost\r\nrelapsed into hopelessness and despondency, for then he realized how\r\nvast and how strong are the fortifications that surround the present\r\nsystem; the great barriers and ramparts of invincible ignorance, apathy\r\nand self-contempt, which will have to be broken down before the system\r\nof society of which they are the defences, can be swept away.\r\n\r\nAt other times as he thought of this marvellous system, it presented\r\nitself to him in such an aspect of almost comical absurdity that he was\r\nforced to laugh and to wonder whether it really existed at all, or if\r\nit were only an illusion of his own disordered mind.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that the human race needed in order to exist was\r\nshelter; so with much painful labour they had constructed a large\r\nnumber of houses.  Thousands of these houses were now standing\r\nunoccupied, while millions of the people who had helped to build the\r\nhouses were either homeless or herding together in overcrowded hovels.\r\n\r\nThese human beings had such a strange system of arranging their affairs\r\nthat if anyone were to go and burn down a lot of the houses he would be\r\nconferring a great boon upon those who had built them, because such an\r\nact would \'Make a lot more work!\'\r\n\r\nAnother very comical thing was that thousands of people wore broken\r\nboots and ragged clothes, while millions of pairs of boots and\r\nabundance of clothing, which they had helped to make, were locked up in\r\nwarehouses, and the System had the keys.\r\n\r\nThousands of people lacked the necessaries of life.  The necessaries of\r\nlife are all produced by work.  The people who lacked begged to be\r\nallowed to work and create those things of which they stood in need.\r\nBut the System prevented them from so doing.\r\n\r\nIf anyone asked the System why it prevented these people from producing\r\nthe things of which they were in want, the System replied:\r\n\r\n\'Because they have already produced too much.  The markets are glutted.\r\nThe warehouses are filled and overflowing, and there is nothing more\r\nfor them to do.\'\r\n\r\nThere was in existence a huge accumulation of everything necessary.  A\r\ngreat number of the people whose labour had produced that vast store\r\nwere now living in want, but the System said that they could not be\r\npermitted to partake of the things they had created.  Then, after a\r\ntime, when these people, being reduced to the last extreme of misery,\r\ncried out that they and their children were dying of hunger, the System\r\ngrudgingly unlocked the doors of the great warehouses, and taking out a\r\nsmall part of the things that were stored within, distributed it\r\namongst the famished workers, at the same time reminding them that it\r\nwas Charity, because all the things in the warehouses, although they\r\nhad been made by the workers, were now the property of the people who\r\ndo nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd then the starving, bootless, ragged, stupid wretches fell down and\r\nworshipped the System, and offered up their children as living\r\nsacrifices upon its altars, saying:\r\n\r\n\'This beautiful System is the only one possible, and the best that\r\nhuman wisdom can devise.  May the System live for ever!  Cursed be\r\nthose who seek to destroy the System!\'\r\n\r\nAs the absurdity of the thing forced itself upon him, Owen, in spite of\r\nthe unhappiness he felt at the sight of all the misery by which he was\r\nsurrounded, laughed aloud and said to himself that if he was sane, then\r\nall these people must be mad.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such colossal imbecility it was absurd to hope for any\r\nimmediate improvement.  The little already accomplished was the work of\r\na few self-sacrificing enthusiasts, battling against the opposition of\r\nthose they sought to benefit, and the results of their labours were, in\r\nmany instances, as pearls cast before the swine who stood watching for\r\nopportunities to fall upon and rend their benefactors.\r\n\r\nThere was only one hope.  It was possible that the monopolists,\r\nencouraged by the extraordinary stupidity and apathy of the people\r\nwould proceed to lay upon them even greater burdens, until at last,\r\ngoaded by suffering, and not having sufficient intelligence to\r\nunderstand any other remedy, these miserable wretches would turn upon\r\ntheir oppressors and drown both them and their System in a sea of blood.\r\n\r\nBesides the work at the Kiosk, towards the end of March things\r\ngradually began to improve in other directions.  Several firms began to\r\ntake on a few hands.  Several large empty houses that were relet had to\r\nbe renovated for their new tenants, and there was a fair amount of\r\ninside work arising out of the annual spring-cleaning in other houses.\r\nThere was not enough work to keep everyone employed, and most of those\r\nwho were taken on as a rule only managed to make a few hours a week,\r\nbut still it was better than absolute idleness, and there also began to\r\nbe talk of several large outside jobs that were to be done as soon as\r\nthe weather was settled.\r\n\r\nThis bad weather, by the way, was a sort of boon to the defenders of\r\nthe present system, who were hard-up for sensible arguments to explain\r\nthe cause of poverty.  One of the principal causes was, of course, the\r\nweather, which was keeping everything back.  There was not the\r\nslightest doubt that if only the weather would allow there would always\r\nbe plenty of work, and poverty would be abolished.\r\n\r\nRushton & Co. had a fair share of what work there was, and Crass,\r\nSawkins, Slyme and Owen were kept employed pretty regularly, although\r\nthey did not start until half past eight and left off at four.  At\r\ndifferent houses in various parts of the town they had ceilings to wash\r\noff and distemper, to strip the old paper from the walls, and to\r\nrepaint and paper the rooms, and sometimes there were the venetian\r\nblinds to repair and repaint.  Occasionally a few extra hands were\r\ntaken on for a few days, and discharged again as soon as the job they\r\nwere taken on to do was finished.\r\n\r\nThe defenders of the existing system may possibly believe that the\r\nknowledge that they would be discharged directly the job was done was a\r\nvery good incentive to industry, that they would naturally under these\r\ncircumstances do their best to get the work done as quickly as\r\npossible.  But then it must be remembered that most of the defenders of\r\nthe existing system are so constituted, that they can believe anything\r\nprovided it is not true and sufficiently silly.\r\n\r\nAll the same, it was a fact that the workmen did do their very best to\r\nget over this work in the shortest possible time, because although they\r\nknew that to do so was contrary to their own interests, they also knew\r\nthat it would be very much more contrary to their interests not to do\r\nso.  Their only chance of being kept on if other work came in was to\r\ntear into it for all they were worth.  Consequently, most of the work\r\nwas rushed and botched and slobbered over in about half the time that\r\nit would have taken to do it properly.  Rooms for which the customers\r\npaid to have three coats of paint were scamped with one or two.  What\r\nMisery did not know about scamping and faking the work, the men\r\nsuggested to and showed him in the hope of currying favour with him in\r\norder that they might get the preference over others and be sent for\r\nwhen the next job came in.  This is the principal incentive provided by\r\nthe present system, the incentive to cheat.  These fellows cheated the\r\ncustomers of their money.  They cheated themselves and their fellow\r\nworkmen of work, and their children of bread, but it was all for a good\r\ncause--to make profit for their master.\r\n\r\nHarlow and Slyme did one job--a room that Rushton & Co. had contracted\r\nto paint three coats.  It was finished with two and the men cleared\r\naway their paints.  The next day, when Slyme went there to paper the\r\nroom, the lady of the house said that the painting was not yet\r\nfinished--it was to have another coat.  Slyme assured her that it had\r\nalready had three, but, as the lady insisted, Slyme went to the shop\r\nand sought out Misery.  Harlow had been stood off, as there was not\r\nanother job in just then, but fortunately he happened to be standing in\r\nthe street outside the shop, so they called him and then the three of\r\nthem went round to the job and swore that the room had had three coats.\r\nThe lady protested that it was not so.  She had watched the progress of\r\nthe work.  Besides, it was impossible; they had only been there three\r\ndays.  The first day they had not put any paint on at all; they had\r\ndone the ceiling and stripped the walls; the painting was not started\r\ntill the second day.  How then could it have had three coats?  Misery\r\nexplained the mystery: he said that for first coating they had an extra\r\nspecial very fast-drying paint--paint that dried so quickly that they\r\nwere able to give the work two coats in one day.  For instance, one man\r\ndid the window, the other the door: when these were finished both men\r\ndid the skirting; by the time the skirting was finished the door and\r\nwindow were dry enough to second coat; and then, on the following\r\nday--the finishing coat!\r\n\r\nOf course, this extra special quick-drying paint was very expensive,\r\nbut the firm did not mind that.  They knew that most of their customers\r\nwished to have their work finished as quickly as possible, and their\r\nstudy was to give satisfaction to the customers.  This explanation\r\nsatisfied the lady--a poverty-stricken widow making a precarious living\r\nby taking in lodgers--who was the more easily deceived because she\r\nregarded Misery as a very holy man, having seen him preaching in the\r\nstreet on many occasions.\r\n\r\nThere was another job at another boarding-house that Owen and Easton\r\ndid--two rooms which had to be painted three coats of white paint and\r\none of enamel, making four coats altogether.  That was what the firm\r\nhad contracted to do.  As the old paint in these rooms was of a rather\r\ndark shade it was absolutely necessary to give the work three coats\r\nbefore enamelling it.  Misery wanted them to let it go with two, but\r\nOwen pointed out that if they did so it would be such a ghastly mess\r\nthat it would never pass.  After thinking the matter over for a few\r\nminutes, Misery told them to go on with the third coat of paint.  Then\r\nhe went downstairs and asked to see the lady of the house.  He\r\nexplained to her that, in consequence of the old paint being so dark,\r\nhe found that it would be necessary, in order to make a good job of it,\r\nto give the work four coats before enamelling it.  Of course, they had\r\nagreed for only three, but as they always made a point of doing their\r\nwork in a first-class manner rather than not make a good job, they\r\nwould give it the extra coat for nothing, but he was sure she would not\r\nwish them to do that.  The lady said that she did not want them to work\r\nfor nothing, and she wanted it done properly.  If it were necessary to\r\ngive it an extra coat, they must do so and she would pay for it.  How\r\nmuch would it be?  Misery told her.  The lady was satisfied, and Misery\r\nwas in the seventh heaven.  Then he went upstairs again and warned Owen\r\nand Easton to be sure to say, if they were asked, that the work had had\r\nfour coats.\r\n\r\nIt would not be reasonable to blame Misery or Rushton for not wishing\r\nto do good, honest work--there was no incentive.  When they secured a\r\ncontract, if they had thought first of making the very best possible\r\njob of it, they would not have made so much profit.  The incentive was\r\nnot to do the work as well as possible, but to do as little as\r\npossible.  The incentive was not to make good work, but to make good\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nThe same rule applied to the workers.  They could not justly be blamed\r\nfor not doing good work--there was no incentive.  To do good work\r\nrequires time and pains.  Most of them would have liked to take time\r\nand pains, because all those who are capable of doing good work find\r\npleasure and happiness in doing it, and have pride in it when done: but\r\nthere was no incentive, unless the certainty of getting the sack could\r\nbe called an incentive, for it was a moral certainty that any man who\r\nwas caught taking time and pains with his work would be promptly\r\npresented with the order of the boot.  But there was plenty of\r\nincentive to hurry and scamp and slobber and botch.\r\n\r\nThere was another job at a lodging-house--two rooms to be painted and\r\npapered.  The landlord paid for the work, but the tenant had the\r\nprivilege of choosing the paper.  She could have any pattern she liked\r\nso long as the cost did not exceed one shilling per roll, Rushton\'s\r\nestimate being for paper of that price.  Misery sent her several\r\npatterns of sixpenny papers, marked at a shilling, to choose from, but\r\nshe did not fancy any of them, and said that she would come to the shop\r\nto make her selection.  So Hunter tore round to the shop in a great\r\nhurry to get there before her.  In his haste to dismount, he fell off\r\nhis bicycle into the muddy road, and nearly smashed the plate-glass\r\nwindow with the handle-bar of the machine as he placed it against the\r\nshop front before going in.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to clean the mud off his clothes, he ordered Budd, the\r\npimply-faced shopman, to get out rolls of all the sixpenny papers they\r\nhad, and then they both set to work and altered the price marked upon\r\nthem from sixpence to a shilling.  Then they got out a number of\r\nshilling papers and altered the price marked upon them, changing it\r\nfrom a shilling to one and six.\r\n\r\nWhen the unfortunate woman arrived, Misery was waiting for her with a\r\nbenign smile upon his long visage.  He showed her all the sixpenny\r\nones, but she did not like any of them, so after a while Nimrod\r\nsuggested that perhaps she would like a paper of a little better\r\nquality, and she could pay the trifling difference out of her own\r\npocket.  Then he showed her the shilling papers that he had marked up\r\nto one and sixpence, and eventually the lady selected one of these and\r\npaid the extra sixpence per roll herself, as Nimrod suggested.  There\r\nwere fifteen rolls of paper altogether--seven for one room and eight\r\nfor the other--so that in addition to the ordinary profit on the sale\r\nof the paper--about two hundred and seventy-five per cent.--the firm\r\nmade seven and sixpence on this transaction.  They might have done\r\nbetter out of the job itself if Slyme had not been hanging the paper\r\npiece-work, for, the two rooms being of the same pattern, he could\r\neasily have managed to do them with fourteen rolls; in fact, that was\r\nall he did use, but he cut up and partly destroyed the one that was\r\nover so that he could charge for hanging it.\r\n\r\nOwen was working there at the same time, for the painting of the rooms\r\nwas not done before Slyme papered them; the finishing coat was put on\r\nafter the paper was hung.  He noticed Slyme destroying the paper and,\r\nguessing the reason, asked him how he could reconcile such conduct as\r\nthat with his profession of religion.\r\n\r\nSlyme replied that the fact that he was a Christian did not imply that\r\nhe never did anything wrong: if he committed a sin, he was a Christian\r\nall the same, and it would be forgiven him for the sake of the Blood.\r\nAs for this affair of the paper, it was a matter between himself and\r\nGod, and Owen had no right to set himself up as a Judge.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this work, there were a number of funerals.  Crass\r\nand Slyme did very well out of it all, working all day white-washing or\r\npainting, and sometimes part of the night painting venetian blinds or\r\npolishing coffins and taking them home, to say nothing of the lifting\r\nin of the corpses and afterwards acting as bearers.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, the number of small jobs increased, and as the days\r\ngrew longer the men were allowed to put in a greater number of hours.\r\nMost of the firms had some work, but there was never enough to keep all\r\nthe men in the town employed at the same time.  It worked like this:\r\nEvery firm had a certain number of men who were regarded as the regular\r\nhands. When there was any work to do, they got the preference over\r\nstrangers or outsiders.  When things were busy, outsiders were taken on\r\ntemporarily.  When the work fell off, these casual hands were the first\r\nto be \'stood still\'.  If it continued to fall off, the old hands were\r\nalso stood still in order of seniority, the older hands being preferred\r\nto strangers--so long, of course, as they were not old in the sense of\r\nbeing aged or inefficient.\r\n\r\nThis kind of thing usually continued all through the spring and summer.\r\nIn good years the men of all trades, carpenters, bricklayers,\r\nplasterers, painters and so on, were able to keep almost regularly at\r\nwork, except in wet weather.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a good and bad spring and summer is that in good\r\nyears it is sometimes possible to make a little overtime, and the\r\nperiods of unemployment are shorter and less frequent than in bad\r\nyears.  It is rare even in good years for one of the casual hands to be\r\nemployed by one firm for more than one, two or three months without a\r\nbreak.  It is usual for them to put in a month with one firm, then a\r\nfortnight with another, then perhaps six weeks somewhere else, and\r\noften between there are two or three days or even weeks of enforced\r\nidleness.  This sort of thing goes on all through spring, summer and\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 41\r\n\r\nThe Easter Offering.  The Beano Meeting\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of April, Rushton & Co. were again working nine hours\r\na day, from seven in the morning till five-thirty at night, and after\r\nEaster they started working full time from 6 A.M. till 5.30 P.M.,\r\neleven and a half hours--or, rather, ten hours, for they had to lose\r\nhalf an hour at breakfast and an hour at dinner.\r\n\r\nJust before Easter several of the men asked Hunter if they might be\r\nallowed to work on Good Friday and Easter Monday, as, they said, they\r\nhad had enough holidays during the winter; they had no money to spare\r\nfor holiday-making, and they did not wish to lose two days\' pay when\r\nthere was work to be done.  Hunter told them that there was not\r\nsufficient work in to justify him in doing as they requested: things\r\nwere getting very slack again, and Mr Rushton had decided to cease work\r\nfrom Thursday night till Tuesday morning.  They were thus prevented\r\nfrom working on Good Friday, but it is true that not more than one\r\nworking man in fifty went to any religious service on that day or on\r\nany other day during the Easter festival.  On the contrary, this\r\nfestival was the occasion of much cursing and blaspheming on the part\r\nof those whose penniless, poverty-stricken condition it helped to\r\naggravate by enforcing unprofitable idleness which they lacked the\r\nmeans to enjoy.\r\n\r\nDuring these holidays some of the men did little jobs on their own\r\naccount and others put in the whole time--including Good Friday and\r\nEaster Sunday--gardening, digging and planting their plots of allotment\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhen Owen arrived home one evening during the week before Easter,\r\nFrankie gave him an envelope which he had brought home from school. It\r\ncontained a printed leaflet:\r\n\r\n                   CHURCH OF THE WHITED SEPULCHRE,\r\n                             MUGSBOROUGH\r\n\r\n                             Easter 19--\r\n\r\nDear Sir (or Madam),\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the usual custom we invite you to join with us in\r\npresenting the Vicar, the Rev. Habbakuk Bosher, with an Easter\r\nOffering, as a token of affection and regard.\r\n\r\n                                           Yours faithfully,\r\n                          A. Cheeseman }\r\n                          W. Taylor    }  Churchwardens\r\n\r\nMr Bosher\'s income from various sources connected with the church was\r\nover six hundred pounds a year, or about twelve pounds per week, but as\r\nthat sum was evidently insufficient, his admirers had adopted this\r\ndevice for supplementing it.  Frankie said all the boys had one of\r\nthese letters and were going to ask their fathers for some money to\r\ngive towards the Easter offering.  Most of them expected to get\r\ntwopence.\r\n\r\nAs the boy had evidently set his heart on doing the same as the other\r\nchildren, Owen gave him the twopence, and they afterwards learned that\r\nthe Easter Offering for that year was one hundred and twenty-seven\r\npounds, which was made up of the amounts collected from the\r\nparishioners by the children, the district visitors and the verger, the\r\ncollection at a special Service, and donations from the feeble-minded\r\nold females elsewhere referred to.\r\n\r\nBy the end of April nearly all the old hands were back at work, and\r\nseveral casual hands had also been taken on, the Semi-drunk being one\r\nof the number.  In addition to these, Misery had taken on a number of\r\nwhat he called \'lightweights\', men who were not really skilled workmen,\r\nbut had picked up sufficient knowledge of the simpler parts of the\r\ntrade to be able to get over it passably.  These were paid fivepence or\r\nfivepence-halfpenny, and were employed in preference to those who had\r\nserved their time, because the latter wanted more money and therefore\r\nwere only employed when absolutely necessary.  Besides the lightweights\r\nthere were a few young fellows called improvers, who were also employed\r\nbecause they were cheap.\r\n\r\nCrass now acted as colourman, having been appointed possibly because he\r\nknew absolutely nothing about the laws of colour.  As most of the work\r\nconsisted of small jobs, all the paint and distemper was mixed up at\r\nthe shop and sent out ready for use to the various jobs.\r\n\r\nSawkins or some of the other lightweights generally carried the heavier\r\nlots of colour or scaffolding, but the smaller lots of colour or such\r\nthings as a pair of steps or a painter\'s plank were usually sent by the\r\nboy, whose slender legs had become quite bowed since he had been\r\nengaged helping the other philanthropists to make money for Mr Rushton.\r\n\r\nCrass\'s work as colourman was simplified, to a certain extent, by the\r\ngreat number of specially prepared paints and distempers in all\r\ncolours, supplied by the manufacturers ready for use.  Most of these\r\nnew-fangled concoctions were regarded with an eye of suspicion and\r\ndislike by the hands, and Philpot voiced the general opinion about them\r\none day during a dinner-hour discussion when he said they might appear\r\nto be all right for a time, but they would probably not last, because\r\nthey was mostly made of kimicles.\r\n\r\nOne of these new-fashioned paints was called \'Petrifying Liquid\', and\r\nwas used for first-coating decaying stone or plaster work.  It was also\r\nsupposed to be used for thinning up a certain kind of patent distemper,\r\nbut when Misery found out that it was possible to thin the latter with\r\nwater, the use of \'Petrifying Liquid\' for that purpose was\r\ndiscontinued.  This \'Petrifying Liquid\' was a source of much merriment\r\nto the hands.  The name was applied to the tea that they made in\r\nbuckets on some of the jobs, and also to the four-ale that was supplied\r\nby certain pubs.\r\n\r\nOne of the new inventions was regarded with a certain amount of\r\nindignation by the hands: it was a white enamel, and they objected to\r\nit for two reasons--one was because, as Philpot remarked, it dried so\r\nquickly that you had to work like greased lightning; you had to be all\r\nover the door directly you started it.\r\n\r\nThe other reason was that, because it dried so quickly, it was\r\nnecessary to keep closed the doors and windows of the room where it was\r\nbeing used, and the smell was so awful that it brought on fits of\r\ndizziness and sometimes vomiting.  Needless to say, the fact that it\r\ncompelled those who used it to work quickly recommended the stuff to\r\nMisery.\r\n\r\nAs for the smell, he did not care about that; he did not have to inhale\r\nthe fumes himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just about this time that Crass, after due consultation with\r\nseveral of the others, including Philpot, Harlow, Bundy, Slyme, Easton\r\nand the Semi-drunk, decided to call a meeting of the hands for the\r\npurpose of considering the advisability of holding the usual Beano\r\nlater on in the summer.  The meeting was held in the carpenter\'s shop\r\ndown at the yard one evening at six o\'clock, which allowed time for\r\nthose interested to attend after leaving work.\r\n\r\nThe hands sat on the benches or carpenter\'s stools, or reclined upon\r\nheaps of shavings.  On a pair of tressels in the centre of the workshop\r\nstood a large oak coffin which Crass had just finished polishing.\r\n\r\nWhen all those who were expected to turn up had arrived, Payne, the\r\nforeman carpenter--the man who made the coffins--was voted to the chair\r\non the proposition of Crass, seconded by Philpot, and then a solemn\r\nsilence ensued, which was broken at last by the chairman, who, in a\r\nlengthy speech, explained the object of the meeting.  Possibly with a\r\nlaudable desire that there should be no mistake about it, he took the\r\ntrouble to explain several times, going over the same ground and\r\nrepeating the same words over and over again, whilst the audience\r\nwaited in a deathlike and miserable silence for him to leave off.\r\nPayne, however, did not appear to have any intention of leaving off,\r\nfor he continued, like a man in a trance, to repeat what he had said\r\nbefore, seeming to be under the impression that he had to make a\r\nseparate explanation to each individual member of the audience.  At\r\nlast the crowd could stand it no longer, and began to shout \'Hear,\r\nhear\' and to bang bits of wood and hammers on the floor and the\r\nbenches; and then, after a final repetition of the statement, that the\r\nobject of the meeting was to consider the advisability of holding an\r\nouting, or beanfeast, the chairman collapsed on to a carpenter\'s stool\r\nand wiped the sweat from his forehead.\r\n\r\nCrass then reminded the meeting that the last year\'s Beano had been an\r\nunqualified success, and for his part he would be very sorry if they\r\ndid not have one this year.  Last year they had four brakes, and they\r\nwent to Tubberton Village.\r\n\r\nIt was true that there was nothing much to see at Tubberton, but there\r\nwas one thing they could rely on getting there that they could not be\r\nsure of getting for the same money anywhere else, and that was--a good\r\nfeed.  (Applause.)  Just for the sake of getting on with the business,\r\nhe would propose that they decide to go to Tubberton, and that a\r\ncommittee be appointed to make arrangements--about the dinner--with the\r\nlandlord of the Queen Elizabeth\'s Head at that place.\r\n\r\nPhilpot seconded the motion, and Payne was about to call for a show of\r\nhands when Harlow rose to a point of order.  It appeared to him that\r\nthey were getting on a bit too fast.  The proper way to do this\r\nbusiness was first to take the feeling of the meeting as to whether\r\nthey wished to have a Beano at all, and then, if the meeting was in\r\nfavour of it, they could decide where they were to go, and whether they\r\nwould have a whole day or only half a day.\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk said that he didn\'t care a dreadful expression where\r\nthey went: he was willing to abide by the decision of the majority.\r\n(Applause.)  It was a matter of indifference to him whether they had a\r\nday, or half a day, or two days; he was agreeable to anything.\r\n\r\nEaston suggested that a special saloon carriage might be engaged, and\r\nthey could go and visit Madame Tussaud\'s Waxworks.  He had never been\r\nto that place and had often wished to see it.  But Philpot objected\r\nthat if they went there, Madame Tussaud\'s might be unwilling to let\r\nthem out again.\r\n\r\nBundy endorsed the remarks that had fallen from Crass with reference to\r\nTubberton.  He did not care where they went, they would never get such\r\na good spread for the money as they did last year at the Queen\r\nElizabeth.  (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nThe chairman said that he remembered the last Beano very well.  They\r\nhad half a day--left off work on Saturday at twelve instead of one--so\r\nthere was only one hour\'s wages lost--they went home, had a wash and\r\nchanged their clothes, and got up to the Cricketers, where the brakes\r\nwas waiting, at one.  Then they had the two hours\' drive to Tubberton,\r\nstopping on the way for drinks at the Blue Lion, the Warrior\'s Head,\r\nthe Bird in Hand, the Dewdrop Inn and the World Turned Upside Down.\r\n(Applause.)  They arrived at the Queen Elizabeth at three-thirty, and\r\nthe dinner was ready; and it was one of the finest blow-outs he had\r\never had.  (Hear, hear.)  There was soup, vegetables, roast beef, roast\r\nmutton, lamb and mint sauce, plum duff, Yorkshire, and a lot more.  The\r\nlandlord of the Elizabeth kept as good a drop of beer as anyone could\r\nwish to drink, and as for the teetotallers, they could have tea, coffee\r\nor ginger beer.\r\n\r\nHaving thus made another start, Payne found it very difficult to leave\r\noff, and was proceeding to relate further details of the last Beano\r\nwhen Harlow again rose up from his heap of shavings and said he wished\r\nto call the chairman to order.  (Hear, hear.)  What the hell was the\r\nuse of all this discussion before they had even decided to have a Beano\r\nat all!  Was the meeting in favour of a Beano or not?  That was the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nA prolonged and awkward silence followed.  Everyone was very\r\nuncomfortable, looking stolidly on the ground or staring straight in\r\nfront of them.\r\n\r\nAt last Easton broke the silence by suggesting that it would not be a\r\nbad plan if someone was to make a motion that a Beano be held.  This\r\nwas greeted with a general murmur of \'Hear, hear,\' followed by another\r\nawkward pause, and then the chairman asked Easton if he would move a\r\nresolution to that effect.  After some hesitation, Easton agreed, and\r\nformally moved: \'That this meeting is in favour of a Beano.\'\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk said that, in order to get on with the business, he\r\nwould second the resolution.  But meantime, several arguments had\r\nbroken out between the advocates of different places, and several men\r\nbegan to relate anecdotes of previous Beanos.  Nearly everyone was\r\nspeaking at once and it was some time before the chairman was able to\r\nput the resolution.  Finding it impossible to make his voice heard\r\nabove the uproar, he began to hammer on the bench with a wooden mallet,\r\nand to shout requests for order, but this only served to increase the\r\ndin.  Some of them looked at him curiously and wondered what was the\r\nmatter with him, but the majority were so interested in their own\r\narguments that they did not notice him at all.\r\n\r\nWhilst the chairman was trying to get the attention of the meeting in\r\norder to put the question, Bundy had become involved in an argument\r\nwith several of the new hands who claimed to know of an even better\r\nplace than the Queen Elizabeth, a pub called \'The New Found Out\', at\r\nMirkfield, a few miles further on than Tubberton, and another\r\nindividual joined in the dispute, alleging that a house called \'The\r\nThree Loggerheads\' at Slushton-cum-Dryditch was the finest place for a\r\nBeano within a hundred miles of Mugsborough.  He went there last year\r\nwith Pushem and Driver\'s crowd, and they had roast beef, goose, jam\r\ntarts, mince pies, sardines, blancmange, calves\' feet jelly and one\r\npint for each man was included in the cost of the dinner.  In the\r\nmiddle of the discussion, they noticed that most of the others were\r\nholding up their hands, so to show there was no ill feeling they held\r\nup theirs also and then the chairman declared it was carried\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\nBundy said he would like to ask the chairman to read out the resolution\r\nwhich had just been passed, as he had not caught the words.\r\n\r\nThe chairman replied that there was no written resolution.  The motion\r\nwas just to express the feeling of this meeting as to whether there was\r\nto be an outing or not.\r\n\r\nBundy said he was only asking a civil question, a point of information:\r\nall he wanted to know was, what was the terms of the resolution?  Was\r\nthey in favour of the Beano or not?\r\n\r\nThe chairman responded that the meeting was unanimously in favour.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nHarlow said that the next thing to be done was to decide upon the date.\r\nCrass suggested the last Saturday in August.  That would give them\r\nplenty of time to pay in.\r\n\r\nSawkins asked whether it was proposed to have a day or only half a day.\r\nHe himself was in favour of the whole day.  It would only mean losing a\r\nmorning\'s work.  It was hardly worth going at all if they only had half\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk remarked that he had just thought of a very good place\r\nto go if they decided to have a change.  Three years ago he was working\r\nfor Dauber and Botchit and they went to \'The First In and the Last Out\'\r\nat Bashford.  It was a very small place, but there was a field where\r\nyou could have a game of cricket or football, and the dinner was A1 at\r\nLloyds.  There was also a skittle alley attached to the pub and no\r\ncharge was made for the use of it.  There was a bit of a river there,\r\nand one of the chaps got so drunk that he went orf his onion and jumped\r\ninto the water, and when they got him out the village policeman locked\r\nhim up, and the next day he was took before the beak and fined two\r\npounds or a month\'s hard labour for trying to commit suicide.\r\n\r\nEaston pointed out that there was another way to look at it: supposing\r\nthey decided to have the Beano, he supposed it would come to about six\r\nshillings a head.  If they had it at the end of August and started\r\npaying in now, say a tanner a week, they would have plenty of time to\r\nmake up the amount, but supposing the work fell off and some of them\r\ngot the push?\r\n\r\nCrass said that in that case a man could either have his money back or\r\nhe could leave it, and continue his payments even if he were working\r\nfor some other firm; the fact that he was off from Rushton\'s would not\r\nprevent him from going to the Beano.\r\n\r\nHarlow proposed that they decide to go to the Queen Elizabeth the same\r\nas last year, and that they have half a day.\r\n\r\nPhilpot said that, in order to get on with the business, he would\r\nsecond the resolution.\r\n\r\nBundy suggested--as an amendment--that it should be a whole day,\r\nstarting from the Cricketers at nine in the morning, and Sawkins said\r\nthat, in order to get on with the business, he would second the\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nOne of the new hands said he wished to move another amendment.  He\r\nproposed to strike out the Queen Elizabeth and substitute the Three\r\nLoggerheads.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman--after a pause--inquired if there were any seconder to\r\nthis, and the Semi-drunk said that, although he did not care much where\r\nthey went, still, to get on with the business, he would second the\r\namendment, although for his own part he would prefer to go to the\r\n\'First In and Last Out\' at Bashford.\r\n\r\nThe new hand offered to withdraw his suggestion re the Three\r\nLoggerheads in favour of the Semi-drunks proposition, but the latter\r\nsaid it didn\'t matter; it could go as it was.\r\n\r\nAs it was getting rather late, several men went home, and cries of \'Put\r\nthe question\' began to be heard on all sides; the chairman accordingly\r\nwas proceeding to put Harlow\'s proposition when the new hand\r\ninterrupted him by pointing out that it was his duty as chairman to put\r\nthe amendments first.  This produced another long discussion, in the\r\ncourse of which a very tall, thin man who had a harsh, metallic voice\r\ngave a long rambling lecture about the rules of order and the conduct\r\nof public meetings.  He spoke very slowly and deliberately, using very\r\nlong words and dealing with the subject in an exhaustive manner.  A\r\nresolution was a resolution, and an amendment was an amendment; then\r\nthere was what was called an amendment to an amendment; the procedure\r\nof the House of Commons differed very materially from that of the House\r\nof Lords--and so on.\r\n\r\nThis man kept on talking for about ten minutes, and might have\r\ncontinued for ten hours if he had not been rudely interrupted by\r\nHarlow, who said that it seemed to him that they were likely to stay\r\nthere all night if they went on like they were going.  He wanted his\r\ntea, and he would also like to get a few hours\' sleep before having to\r\nresume work in the morning.  He was getting about sick of all this\r\ntalk.  (Hear, hear.)  In order to get on with the business, he would\r\nwithdraw his resolution if the others would withdraw their amendments.\r\nIf they would agree to do this, he would then propose another\r\nresolution which--if carried--would meet all the requirements of the\r\ncase.  (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe man with the metallic voice observed that it was not necessary to\r\nask the consent of those who had moved amendments: if the original\r\nproposition was withdrawed, all the amendments fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n\'Last year,\' observed Crass, \'when we was goin\' out of the room after\r\nwe\'d finished our dinner at the Queen Elizabeth, the landlord pointed\r\nto the table and said, "There\'s enough left over for you all to \'ave\r\nanother lot."\'  (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nHarlow said that he would move that it be held on the last Saturday in\r\nAugust; that it be for half a day, starting at one o\'clock so that they\r\ncould work up till twelve, which would mean that they would only have\r\nto lose one hour\'s pay: that they go to the same place as last\r\nyear--the Queen Elizabeth.  (Hear, hear.)  That the same committee that\r\nacted last year--Crass and Bundy--be appointed to make all the\r\narrangements and collect the subscriptions.  (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe tall man observed that this was what was called a compound\r\nresolution, and was proceeding to explain further when the chairman\r\nexclaimed that it did not matter a dam\' what it was called--would\r\nanyone second it?  The Semi-drunk said that he would--in order to get\r\non with the business.\r\n\r\nBundy moved, and Sawkins seconded, as an amendment, that it should be a\r\nwhole day.\r\n\r\nThe new hand moved to substitute the Loggerheads for the Queen\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nEaston proposed to substitute Madame Tussaud\'s Waxworks for the Queen\r\nElizabeth.  He said he moved this just to test the feeling of the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nHarlow pointed out that it would cost at least a pound a head to defray\r\nthe expenses of such a trip.  The railway fares, tram fares in London,\r\nmeals--for it would be necessary to have a whole day--and other\r\nincidental expenses; to say nothing of the loss of wages.  It would not\r\nbe possible for any of them to save the necessary amount during the\r\nnext four months.  (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\nPhilpot repeated his warning as to the danger of visiting Madame\r\nTussaud\'s.  He was certain that if she once got them in there she would\r\nnever let them out again.  He had no desire to pass the rest of his\r\nlife as an image in a museum.\r\n\r\nOne of the new hands--a man with a red tie--said that they would look\r\nwell, after having been soaked for a month or two in petrifying liquid,\r\nchained up in the Chamber of Horrors with labels round their\r\nnecks--\'Specimens of Liberal and Conservative upholders of the\r\nCapitalist System, 20 century\'.\r\n\r\nCrass protested against the introduction of politics into that meeting.\r\n(Hear, hear.)  The remarks of the last speakers were most uncalled-for.\r\n\r\nEaston said that he would withdraw his amendment.\r\n\r\nActing under the directions of the man with the metallic voice, the\r\nchairman now proceeded to put the amendment to the vote.  Bundy\'s\r\nproposal that it should be a whole day was defeated, only himself,\r\nSawkins and the Semi-drunk being in favour.  The motion to substitute\r\nthe Loggerheads for the Queen Elizabeth was also defeated, and the\r\ncompound resolution proposed by Harlow was then carried nem. con.\r\n\r\nPhilpot now proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the chairman for the\r\nvery able manner in which he had conducted the meeting.  When this had\r\nbeen unanimously agreed to, the Semi-drunk moved a similar tribute of\r\ngratitude to Crass for his services to the cause and the meeting\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 42\r\n\r\nJune\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of May the weather was exceptionally bad, with\r\nbitterly cold winds.  Rain fell nearly every day, covering the roads\r\nwith a slush that penetrated the rotten leather of the cheap or\r\nsecond-hand boots worn by the workmen.  This weather had the effect of\r\nstopping nearly all outside work, and also caused a lot of illness, for\r\nthose who were so fortunate as to have inside jobs frequently got wet\r\nthrough on their way to work in the morning and had to work all day in\r\ndamp clothing, and with their boots saturated with water.  It was also\r\na source of trouble to those of the men who had allotments, because if\r\nit had been fine they would have been able to do something to their\r\ngardens while they were out of work.\r\n\r\nNewman had not succeeded in getting a job at the trade since he came\r\nout of prison, but he tried to make a little money by hawking bananas.\r\nPhilpot--when he was at work--used often to buy a tanner\'s or a bob\'s\r\nworth from him and give them to Mrs Linden\'s children.  On Saturdays\r\nOld Joe used to waylay these children and buy them bags of cakes at the\r\nbakers.  One week when he knew that Mrs Linden had not had much work to\r\ndo, he devised a very cunning scheme to help her.  He had been working\r\nwith Slyme, who was papering a large boarded ceiling in a shop.  It had\r\nto be covered with unbleached calico before it could be papered and\r\nwhen the work was done there were a number of narrow pieces of calico\r\nleft over.  These he collected and tore into strips about six inches\r\nwide which he took round to Mrs Linden, and asked her to sew them\r\ntogether, end to end, so as to make one long strip: then this long\r\nstrip had to be cut into four pieces of equal length and the edges sewn\r\ntogether in such a manner that it would form a long tube.  Philpot told\r\nher that it was required for some work that Rushton\'s were doing, and\r\nsaid he had undertaken to get the sewing done.  The firm would have to\r\npay for it, so she could charge a good price.\r\n\r\n\'You see,\' he said with a wink, \'this is one of those jobs where we\r\ngets a chance to get some of our own back.\'\r\n\r\nMary thought it was rather a strange sort of job, but she did as\r\nPhilpot directed and when he came for the stuff and asked how much it\r\nwas she said threepence: it had only taken about half an hour. Philpot\r\nridiculed this: it was not nearly enough.  THEY were not supposed to\r\nknow how long it took: it ought to be a bob at the very least.  So,\r\nafter some hesitation she made out a bill for that amount on a\r\nhalf-sheet of note-paper.  He brought her the money the next Saturday\r\nafternoon and went off chuckling to himself over the success of the\r\nscheme.  It did not occur to him until the next day that he might just\r\nas well have got her to make him an apron or two: and when he did think\r\nof this he said that after all it didn\'t matter, because if he had done\r\nthat it would have been necessary to buy new calico, and anyhow, it\r\ncould be done some other time.\r\n\r\nNewman did not make his fortune out of the bananas--seldom more than\r\ntwo shillings a day--and consequently he was very glad when Philpot\r\ncalled at his house one evening and told him there was a chance of a\r\njob at Rushton\'s.  Newman accordingly went to the yard the next\r\nmorning, taking his apron and blouse and his bag of tools with him,\r\nready to start work.  He got there at about quarter to six and was\r\nwaiting outside when Hunter arrived.  The latter was secretly very glad\r\nto see him, for there was a rush of work in and they were short of men.\r\nHe did not let this appear, of course, but hesitated for a few minutes\r\nwhen Newman repeated the usual formula: \'Any chance of a job, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'We wasn\'t at all satisfied with you last time you was on, you know,\'\r\nsaid Misery.  \'Still, I don\'t mind giving you another chance.  But if\r\nyou want to hold your job you\'ll have to move yourself a bit quicker\r\nthan you did before.\'\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month things began to improve all round.  The\r\nweather became finer and more settled.  As time went on the improvement\r\nwas maintained and nearly everyone was employed. Rushton\'s were so busy\r\nthat they took on several other old hands who had been sacked the\r\nprevious year for being too slow.\r\n\r\nThanks to the influence of Crass, Easton was now regarded as one of the\r\nregular hands.  He had recently resumed the practice of spending some\r\nof his evenings at the Cricketers.  It is probable that even if it had\r\nnot been for his friendship with Crass, he would still have continued\r\nto frequent the public house, for things were not very comfortable at\r\nhome.  Somehow or other, Ruth and he seemed to be always quarrelling,\r\nand he was satisfied that it was not always his fault.  Sometimes,\r\nafter the day\'s work was over he would go home resolved to be good\r\nfriends with her: he would plan on his way homewards to suggest to her\r\nthat they should have their tea and then go out for a walk with the\r\nchild.  Once or twice she agreed, but on each occasion, they quarrelled\r\nbefore they got home again.  So after a time he gave up trying to be\r\nfriends with her and went out by himself every evening as soon as he\r\nhad had his tea.\r\n\r\nMary Linden, who was still lodging with them, could not help perceiving\r\ntheir unhappiness: she frequently noticed that Ruth\'s eyes were red and\r\nswollen as if with crying, and she gently sought to gain her\r\nconfidence, but without success.  On one occasion when Mary was trying\r\nto advise her, Ruth burst out into a terrible fit of weeping, but she\r\nwould not say what was the cause--except that her head was aching--she\r\nwas not well, that was all.\r\n\r\nSometimes Easton passed the evening at the Cricketers but frequently he\r\nwent over to the allotments, where Harlow had a plot of ground. Harlow\r\nused to get up about four o\'clock in the morning and put in an hour or\r\nso at his garden before going to work; and every evening as soon as he\r\nhad finished tea he used to go there again and work till it was dark.\r\nSometimes he did not go home to tea at all, but went straight from work\r\nto the garden, and his children used to bring his tea to him there in a\r\nglass bottle, with something to eat in a little basket.  He had four\r\nchildren, none of whom were yet old enough to go to work, and as may be\r\nimagined, he found it a pretty hard struggle to live.  He was not a\r\nteetotaller, but as he often remarked, \'what the publicans got from him\r\nwouldn\'t make them very fat\', for he often went for weeks together\r\nwithout tasting the stuff, except a glass or two with the Sunday\r\ndinner, which he did not regard as an unnecessary expense, because it\r\nwas almost as cheap as tea or coffee.\r\n\r\nFortunately his wife was a good needlewoman, and as sober and\r\nindustrious as himself; by dint of slaving incessantly from morning\r\ntill night she managed to keep her home fairly comfortable and the\r\nchildren clean and decently dressed; they always looked respectable,\r\nalthough they did not always have enough proper food to eat.  They\r\nlooked so respectable that none of the \'visiting ladies\' ever regarded\r\nthem as deserving cases.\r\n\r\nHarlow paid fifteen shillings a year for his plot of ground, and\r\nalthough it meant a lot of hard work it was also a source of pleasure\r\nand some profit.  He generally made a few shillings out of the flowers,\r\nbesides having enough potatoes and other vegetables to last them nearly\r\nall the year.\r\n\r\nSometimes Easton went over to the allotments and lent Harlow a hand\r\nwith this gardening work, but whether he went there or to the\r\nCricketers, he usually returned home about half past nine, and then\r\nwent straight to bed, often without speaking a single word to Ruth, who\r\nfor her part seldom spoke to him except to answer something he said, or\r\nto ask some necessary question.  At first, Easton used to think that it\r\nwas all because of the way he had behaved to her in the public house,\r\nbut when he apologized--as he did several times--and begged her to\r\nforgive him and forget about it, she always said it was all right;\r\nthere was nothing to forgive.  Then, after a time, he began to think it\r\nwas on account of their poverty and the loss of their home, for nearly\r\nall their furniture had been sold during the last winter.  But whenever\r\nhe talked of trying to buy some more things to make the place\r\ncomfortable again, she did not appear to take any interest: the house\r\nwas neat enough as it was: they could manage very well, she said,\r\nindifferently.\r\n\r\nOne evening, about the middle of June, when he had been over to the\r\nallotments, Easton brought her home a bunch of flowers that Harlow had\r\ngiven him--some red and white roses and some pansies.  When he came in,\r\nRuth was packing his food basket for the next day.  The baby was asleep\r\nin its cot on the floor near the window.  Although it was nearly nine\r\no\'clock the lamp had not yet been lighted and the mournful twilight\r\nthat entered the room through the open window increased the desolation\r\nof its appearance.  The fire had burnt itself out and the grate was\r\nfilled with ashes.  On the hearth was an old rug made of jute that had\r\nonce been printed in bright colours which had faded away till the whole\r\nsurface had become almost uniformly drab, showing scarcely any trace of\r\nthe original pattern.  The rest of the floor was bare except for two or\r\nthree small pieces of old carpet that Ruth had bought for a few pence\r\nat different times at some inferior second-hand shop.  The chairs and\r\nthe table were almost the only things that were left of the original\r\nfurniture of the room, and except for three or four plates of different\r\npatterns and sizes and a few cups and saucers, the shelves of the\r\ndresser were bare.\r\n\r\nThe stillness of the atmosphere was disturbed only by the occasional\r\nsound of the wheels of a passing vehicle and the strangely distinct\r\nvoices of some children who were playing in the street.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve brought you these,\' said Easton, offering her the flowers.  \'I\r\nthought you\'d like them.  I got them from Harlow.  You know I\'ve been\r\nhelping him a little with his garden.\'\r\n\r\nAt first he thought she did not want to take them.  She was standing at\r\nthe table with her back to the window, so that he was unable to see the\r\nexpression of her face, and she hesitated for a moment before she\r\nfaltered out some words of thanks and took the flowers, which she put\r\ndown on the table almost as soon as she touched them.\r\n\r\nOffended at what he considered her contemptuous indifference, Easton\r\nmade no further attempt at conversation but went into the scullery to\r\nwash his hands, and then went up to bed.\r\n\r\nDownstairs, for a long time after he was gone, Ruth sat alone by the\r\nfireless grate, in the silence and the gathering shadows, holding the\r\nbunch of flowers in her hand, living over again the events of the last\r\nyear, and consumed with an agony of remorse.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Mary Linden and the two children in the house probably\r\nsaved Ruth from being more unhappy than she was.  Little Elsie had made\r\nan arrangement with her to be allowed to take the baby out for walks,\r\nand in return Ruth did Elsie\'s housework.  As for Mary, she had not\r\nmuch time to do anything but sew, almost the only relaxation she knew\r\nbeing when she took the work home, and on Sunday, which she usually\r\ndevoted to a general clean-up of the room, and to mending the\r\nchildren\'s clothes.  Sometimes on Sunday evening she used to go with\r\nRuth and the children to see Mrs Owen, who, although she was not ill\r\nenough to stay in bed, seldom went out of the house.  She had never\r\nreally recovered from the attack of illness which was brought on by her\r\nwork at the boarding house.  The doctor had been to see her once or\r\ntwice and had prescribed--rest.  She was to lie down as much as\r\npossible, not to do any heavy work--not to carry or lift any heavy\r\narticles, scrub floors, make beds, or anything of that sort: and she\r\nwas to take plenty of nourishing food, beef tea, chicken, a little wine\r\nand so on.  He did not suggest a trip round the world in a steam yacht\r\nor a visit to Switzerland--perhaps he thought they might not be able to\r\nafford it.  Sometimes she was so ill that she had to observe one at\r\nleast of the doctor\'s instructions--to lie down: and then she would\r\nworry and fret because she was not able to do the housework and because\r\nOwen had to prepare his own tea when he came home at night. On one of\r\nthese occasions it would have been necessary for Owen to stay at home\r\nfrom work if it had not been for Mrs Easton, who came for several days\r\nin succession to look after her and attend to the house.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Owen\'s health was better since the weather had become\r\nwarmer.  For a long time after the attack of haemorrhage he had while\r\nwriting the show-card he used to dread going to sleep at night for fear\r\nit should recur.  He had heard of people dying in their sleep from that\r\ncause.  But this terror gradually left him.  Nora knew nothing of what\r\noccurred that night: to have told her would have done no good, but on\r\nthe contrary would have caused her a lot of useless anxiety.  Sometimes\r\nhe doubted whether it was right not to tell her, but as time went by\r\nand his health continued to improve he was glad he had said nothing\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nFrankie had lately resumed his athletic exercises with the flat iron:\r\nhis strength was returning since Owen had been working regularly,\r\nbecause he had been having his porridge and milk again and also some\r\nParrish\'s Food which a chemist at Windley was selling large bottles of\r\nfor a shilling.  He used to have what he called a \'party\' two or three\r\ntimes a week with Elsie, Charley and Easton\'s baby as the guests.\r\nSometimes, if Mrs Owen were not well, Elsie used to stay in with her\r\nafter tea and do some housework while the boys went out to play, but\r\nmore frequently the four children used to go together to the park to\r\nplay or sail boats on the lake.  Once one of the boats was becalmed\r\nabout a couple of yards from shore and while trying to reach it with a\r\nstick Frankie fell into the water, and when Charley tried to drag him\r\nout he fell in also.  Elsie put the baby down on the bank and seized\r\nhold of Charley and while she was trying to get him out, the baby began\r\nrolling down, and would probably have tumbled in as well if a man who\r\nhappened to be passing by had not rushed up in time to prevent it.\r\nFortunately the water at that place was only about two feet deep, so\r\nthe boys were not much the worse for their ducking.  They returned home\r\nwet through, smothered with mud, and feeling very important, like boys\r\nwho had distinguished themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter this, whenever she could manage to spare the time, Ruth Easton\r\nused to go with the children to the park.  There was a kind of\r\nsummer-house near the shore of the lake, only a few feet away from the\r\nwater\'s edge, surrounded and shaded by trees, whose branches arched\r\nover the path and drooped down to the surface of the water.  While the\r\nchildren played Ruth used to sit in this arbour and sew, but often her\r\nwork was neglected and forgotten as she gazed pensively at the water,\r\nwhich just there looked very still, and dark, and deep, for it was\r\nsheltered from the wind and over-shadowed by the trees that lined the\r\nbanks at the end of the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, if it happened to be raining, instead of going out the\r\nchildren used to have some games in the house.  On one such occasion\r\nFrankie produced the flat iron and went through the exercise, and\r\nCharley had a go as well.  But although he was slightly older and\r\ntaller than Frankie he could not lift the iron so often or hold it out\r\nso long as the other, a failure that Frankie attributed to the fact\r\nthat Charley had too much tea and bread and butter instead of porridge\r\nand milk and Parrish\'s Food.  Charley was so upset about his lack of\r\nstrength that he arranged with Frankie to come home with him the next\r\nday after school to see his mother about it.  Mrs Linden had a flat\r\niron, so they gave a demonstration of their respective powers before\r\nher.  Mrs Easton being also present, by request, because Frankie said\r\nthat the diet in question was suitable for babies as well as big\r\nchildren.  He had been brought up on it ever since he could remember,\r\nand it was almost as cheap as bread and butter and tea.\r\n\r\nThe result of the exhibition was that Mrs Linden promised to make\r\nporridge for Charley and Elsie whenever she could spare the time, and\r\nMrs Easton said she would try it for the baby also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 43\r\n\r\nThe Good Old Summer-time\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the summer the crowd of ragged-trousered philanthropists\r\ncontinued to toil and sweat at their noble and unselfish task of making\r\nmoney for Mr Rushton.\r\n\r\nPainting the outsides of houses and shops, washing off and distempering\r\nceilings, stripping old paper off walls, painting and papering rooms\r\nand staircases, building new rooms or other additions to old houses or\r\nbusiness premises, digging up old drains, repairing leaky roofs and\r\nbroken windows.\r\n\r\nTheir zeal and enthusiasm in the good cause was unbounded.  They were\r\nsupposed to start work at six o\'clock, but most of them were usually to\r\nbe found waiting outside the job at about a quarter to that hour,\r\nsitting on the kerbstones or the doorstep.\r\n\r\nTheir operations extended all over the town: at all hours of the day\r\nthey were to be seen either going or returning from \'jobs\', carrying\r\nladders, planks, pots of paint, pails of whitewash, earthenware,\r\nchimney pots, drainpipes, lengths of guttering, closet pans, grates,\r\nbundles of wallpaper, buckets of paste, sacks of cement, and loads of\r\nbricks and mortar.  Quite a common spectacle--for gods and men--was a\r\nprocession consisting of a handcart loaded up with such materials being\r\npushed or dragged through the public streets by about half a dozen of\r\nthese Imperialists in broken boots and with battered, stained,\r\ndiscoloured bowler hats, or caps splashed with paint and whitewash;\r\ntheir stand-up collars dirty, limp and crumpled, and their rotten\r\nsecond-hand misfit clothing saturated with sweat and plastered with\r\nmortar.\r\n\r\nEven the assistants in the grocers\' and drapers\' shops laughed and\r\nridiculed and pointed the finger of scorn at them as they passed.\r\n\r\nThe superior classes--those who do nothing--regarded them as a sort of\r\nlower animals.  A letter appeared in the Obscurer one week from one of\r\nthese well-dressed loafers, complaining of the annoyance caused to the\r\nbetter-class visitors by workmen walking on the pavement as they passed\r\nalong the Grand Parade in the evening on their way home from work, and\r\nsuggesting that they should walk in the roadway.  When they heard of\r\nthe letter a lot of the workmen adopted the suggestion and walked in\r\nthe road so as to avoid contaminating the idlers.\r\n\r\nThis letter was followed by others of a somewhat similar kind, and one\r\nor two written in a patronizing strain in defence of the working\r\nclasses by persons who evidently knew nothing about them.  There was\r\nalso a letter from an individual who signed himself \'Morpheus\'\r\ncomplaining that he was often awakened out of his beauty sleep in the\r\nmiddle of the night by the clattering noise of the workmen\'s boots as\r\nthey passed his house on their way to work in the morning.  \'Morpheus\'\r\nwrote that not only did they make a dreadful noise with their horrible\r\niron-clad boots, but they were in the habit of coughing and spitting a\r\ngreat deal, which was very unpleasant to hear, and they conversed in\r\nloud tones.  Sometimes their conversation was not at all edifying, for\r\nit consisted largely of bad language, which \'Morpheus\' assumed to be\r\nattributable to the fact that they were out of temper because they had\r\nto rise so early.\r\n\r\nAs a rule they worked till half-past five in the evening, and by the\r\ntime they reached home it was six o\'clock.  When they had taken their\r\nevening meal and had a wash it was nearly eight: about nine most of\r\nthem went to bed so as to be able to get up about half past four the\r\nnext morning to make a cup of tea before leaving home at half past five\r\nto go to work again.  Frequently it happened that they had to leave\r\nhome earlier than this, because their \'job\' was more than half an\r\nhour\'s walk away.  It did not matter how far away the \'job\' was from\r\nthe shop, the men had to walk to and fro in their own time, for Trades\r\nUnion rules were a dead letter in Mugsborough.  There were no tram\r\nfares or train fares or walking time allowed for the likes of them.\r\n\r\nNinety-nine out of every hundred of them did not believe in such things\r\nas those: they had much more sense than to join Trades Unions: on the\r\ncontrary, they believed in placing themselves entirely at the mercy of\r\ntheir good, kind Liberal and Tory masters.\r\n\r\nVery frequently it happened, when only a few men were working together,\r\nthat it was not convenient to make tea for breakfast or dinner, and\r\nthen some of them brought tea with them ready made in bottles and drank\r\nit cold; but most of them went to the nearest pub and ate their food\r\nthere with a glass of beer.  Even those who would rather have had tea\r\nor coffee had beer, because if they went to a temperance restaurant or\r\ncoffee tavern it generally happened that they were not treated very\r\ncivilly unless they bought something to eat as well as to drink, and\r\nthe tea at such places was really dearer than beer, and the latter was\r\ncertainly quite as good to drink as the stewed tea or the liquid mud\r\nthat was sold as coffee at cheap \'Workmen\'s\' Eating Houses.\r\n\r\nThere were some who were--as they thought--exceptionally lucky: the\r\nfirms they worked for were busy enough to let them work two hours\'\r\novertime every night--till half past seven--without stopping for tea.\r\nMost of these arrived home about eight, completely flattened out.  Then\r\nthey had some tea and a wash and before they knew where they were it\r\nwas about half past nine.  Then they went to sleep again till half past\r\nfour or five the next morning.\r\n\r\nThey were usually so tired when they got home at night that they never\r\nhad any inclination for study or any kind of self-improvement, even if\r\nthey had had the time.  They had plenty of time to study during the\r\nwinter: and their favourite subject then was, how to preserve\r\nthemselves from starving to death.\r\n\r\nThis overtime, however, was the exception, for although in former years\r\nit had been the almost invariable rule to work till half past seven in\r\nsummer, most of the firms now made a practice of ceasing work at\r\nfive-thirty.  The revolution which had taken place in this matter was a\r\nfavourite topic of conversation amongst the men, who spoke regretfully\r\nof the glorious past, when things were busy, and they used to work\r\nfifteen, sixteen and even eighteen hours a day.  But nowadays there\r\nwere nearly as many chaps out of work in the summer as in the winter.\r\nThey used to discuss the causes of the change.  One was, of course, the\r\nfact that there was not so much building going on as formerly, and\r\nanother was the speeding up and slave-driving, and the manner in which\r\nthe work was now done, or rather scamped.  As old Philpot said, he\r\ncould remember the time, when he was a nipper, when such a \'job\' as\r\nthat at \'The Cave\' would have lasted at least six months, and they\r\nwould have had more hands on it too!  But it would have been done\r\nproperly, not messed up like that was: all the woodwork would have been\r\nrubbed down with pumice stone and water: all the knots cut out and the\r\nholes properly filled up, and the work properly rubbed down with\r\nglass-paper between every coat.  But nowadays the only place you\'d see\r\na bit of pumice stone was in a glass case in a museum, with a label on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n           \'Pumice Stone: formerly used by house-painters.\'\r\n\r\nMost of them spoke of those bygone times with poignant regret, but\r\nthere were a few--generally fellows who had been contaminated by\r\ncontact with Socialists or whose characters had been warped and\r\ndegraded by the perusal of Socialist literature--who said that they did\r\nnot desire to work overtime at all--ten hours a day were quite enough\r\nfor them--in fact they would rather do only eight.  What they wanted,\r\nthey said, was not more work, but more grub, more clothes, more\r\nleisure, more pleasure and better homes.  They wanted to be able to go\r\nfor country walks or bicycle rides, to go out fishing or to go to the\r\nseaside and bathe and lie on the beach and so forth.  But these were\r\nonly a very few; there were not many so selfish as this.  The majority\r\ndesired nothing but to be allowed to work, and as for their children,\r\nwhy, \'what was good enough for themselves oughter be good enough for\r\nthe kids\'.\r\n\r\nThey often said that such things as leisure, culture, pleasure and the\r\nbenefits of civilization were never intended for \'the likes of us\'.\r\n\r\nThey did not--all--actually say this, but that was what their conduct\r\namounted to; for they not only refused to help to bring about a better\r\nstate of things for their children, but they ridiculed and opposed and\r\ncursed and abused those who were trying to do it for them. The foulest\r\nwords that came out of their mouths were directed against the men of\r\ntheir own class in the House of Commons--the Labour Members--and\r\nespecially the Socialists, whom they spoke of as fellows who were too\r\nbloody lazy to work for a living, and who wanted the working classes to\r\nkeep them.\r\n\r\nSome of them said that they did not believe in helping their children\r\nto become anything better than their parents had been because in such\r\ncases the children, when they grew up, \'looked down\' upon and were\r\nashamed of their fathers and mothers!  They seemed to think that if\r\nthey loved and did their duty to their children, the probability was\r\nthat the children would prove ungrateful: as if even if that were true,\r\nit would be any excuse for their indifference.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the shortage of work was the intrusion into the trade\r\nof so many outsiders: fellows like Sawkins and the other lightweights.\r\nWhatever other causes there were, there could be no doubt that the\r\nhurrying and scamping was a very real one.  Every \'job\' had to be done\r\nat once! as if it were a matter of life or death!  It must be finished\r\nby a certain time.  If the \'job\' was at an empty house, Misery\'s yarn\r\nwas that it was let! the people were coming in at the end of the week!\r\ntherefore everything must be finished by Wednesday night.  All the\r\nceilings had to be washed off, the walls stripped and repapered, and\r\ntwo coats of paint inside and outside the house.  New drains were to be\r\nput in, and all broken windows and locks and broken plaster repaired.\r\nA number of men--usually about half as many as there should have\r\nbeen--would be sent to do the work, and one man was put in charge of\r\nthe \'job\'.  These sub-foremen or \'coddies\' knew that if they \'made\r\ntheir jobs pay\' they would be put in charge of others and be kept on in\r\npreference to other men as long as the firm had any work; so they\r\nhelped Misery to scheme and scamp the work and watched and drove the\r\nmen under their charge; and these latter poor wretches, knowing that\r\ntheir only chance of retaining their employment was to \'tear into it\',\r\ntore into it like so many maniacs.  Instead of cleaning any parts of\r\nthe woodwork that were greasy or very dirty, they brushed them over\r\nwith a coat of spirit varnish before painting to make sure that the\r\npaint would dry: places where the plaster of the walls was damaged were\r\nrepaired with what was humorously called \'garden cement\'--which was the\r\ntechnical term for dirt out of the garden--and the surface was skimmed\r\nover with proper material. Ceilings that were not very dirty were not\r\nwashed off, but dusted, and lightly gone over with a thin coat of\r\nwhitewash.  The old paper was often left upon the walls of rooms that\r\nwere supposed to be stripped before being repapered, and to conceal\r\nthis the joints of the old paper were rubbed down so that they should\r\nnot be perceptible through the new paper.  As far as possible, Misery\r\nand the sub-foreman avoided doing the work the customers paid for, and\r\neven what little they did was hurried over anyhow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA reign of terror--the terror of the sack--prevailed on all the \'jobs\',\r\nwhich were carried on to the accompaniment of a series of alarums and\r\nexcursions: no man felt safe for a moment: at the most unexpected times\r\nMisery would arrive and rush like a whirlwind all over the \'job\'.  If\r\nhe happened to find a man having a spell the culprit was immediately\r\ndischarged, but he did not get the opportunity of doing this very often\r\nfor everybody was too terrified to leave off working even for a few\r\nminutes\' rest.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of Hunter\'s arrival until his departure, a state of\r\npanic, hurry, scurry and turmoil reigned.  His strident voice rang\r\nthrough the house as he bellowed out to them to \'Rouse themselves! Get\r\nit done!  Smear it on anyhow!  Tar it over!  We\'ve got another job to\r\nstart when you\'ve done this!\'\r\n\r\nOccasionally, just to keep the others up to concert pitch, he used to\r\nsack one of the men for being too slow.  They all trembled before him\r\nand ran about whenever he spoke to or called them, because they knew\r\nthat there were always a lot of other men out of work who would be\r\nwilling and eager to fill their places if they got the sack.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was now summer, and the Distress Committee and all the\r\nother committees had suspended operations, there was still always a\r\nlarge number of men hanging about the vicinity of the Fountain on the\r\nParade--The Wage Slave Market.  When men finished up for the firm they\r\nwere working for they usually made for that place.  Any master in want\r\nof a wage slave for a few hours, days or weeks could always buy one\r\nthere.  The men knew this and they also knew that if they got the sack\r\nfrom one firm it was no easy matter to get another job, and that was\r\nwhy they were terrified.\r\n\r\nWhen Misery was gone--to repeat the same performance at some other\r\njob--the sub-foreman would have a crawl round to see how the chaps were\r\ngetting on: to find out if they had used up all their paint yet, or to\r\nbring them some putty so that they should not have to leave their work\r\nto go to get anything themselves: and then very often Rushton himself\r\nwould come and stalk quietly about the house or stand silently behind\r\nthe men, watching them as they worked.  He seldom spoke to anyone, but\r\njust stood there like a graven image, or walked about like a dumb\r\nanimal--a pig, as the men used to say.  This individual had a very\r\nexalted idea of his own importance and dignity. One man got the sack\r\nfor presuming to stop him in the street to ask some questions about\r\nsome work that was being done.\r\n\r\nMisery went round to all the jobs the next day and told all the\r\n\'coddies\' to tell all the hands that they were never to speak to Mr\r\nRushton if they met him in the street, and the following Saturday the\r\nman who had so offended was given his back day, ostensibly because\r\nthere was nothing for him to do, but really for the reason stated above.\r\n\r\nThere was one job, the outside of a large house that stood on elevated\r\nground overlooking the town.  The men who were working there were even\r\nmore than usually uncomfortable, for it was said that Rushton used to\r\nsit in his office and watch them through a telescope.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when it was really necessary to get a job done by a certain\r\ntime, they had to work late, perhaps till eight or nine o\'clock.  No\r\ntime was allowed for tea, but some of them brought sufficient food with\r\nthem in the morning to enable them to have a little about six o\'clock\r\nin the evening.  Others arranged for their children to bring them some\r\ntea from home.  As a rule, they partook of this without stopping work:\r\nthey had it on the floor beside them and ate and drank and worked at\r\nthe same time--a paint-brushful of white lead in one hand, and a piece\r\nof bread and margarine in the other.  On some jobs, if the \'coddy\'\r\nhappened to be a decent sort, they posted a sentry to look out for\r\nHunter or Rushton while the others knocked off for a few minutes to\r\nsnatch a mouthful of grub; but it was not safe always to do this, for\r\nthere was often some crawling sneak with an ambition to become a\r\n\'coddy\' who would not scruple to curry favour with Misery by reporting\r\nthe crime.\r\n\r\nAs an additional precaution against the possibility of any of the men\r\nidling or wasting their time, each one was given a time-sheet on which\r\nhe was required to account for every minute of the day.  The form of\r\nthese sheets vary slightly with different firms: that of Rushton & Co.,\r\nwas as shown.\r\n\r\n                               TIME SHEET\r\n  OF WORK DONE BY                                       IN THE EMPLOY OF\r\n                              RUSHTON & CO\r\n  BUILDERS & DECORATORS             :                        MUGSBOROUGH\r\n\r\n          NO SMOKING OR INTOXICANTS ALLOWED DURING WORKING HOURS\r\n\r\n   EACH PIECE OF WORK MUST BE FULLY DESCRIBED, WHAT IT WAS, AND HOW LONG\r\n                              IT TOOK TO DO.\r\n\r\n  -----+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------+------------\r\n       |               | Time When | Time When |       |\r\n       | Where Working | Started   | Finished  | Hours | What Doing\r\n  -----+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------+------------ Sat\r\n  |               |           |           |       |\r\n  -----+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------+------------ Mon\r\n  |               |           |           |       |\r\n  -----+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------+------------ Tues\r\n  |               |           |           |       |\r\n  -----+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------+------------ Wed\r\n  |               |           |           |       |\r\n  -----+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------+------------ Thur\r\n  |               |           |           |       |\r\n  -----+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------+------------ Fri\r\n  |               |           |           |       |\r\n  -----+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------+------------\r\n       |               |           Total Hours |       |\r\n  -----+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Monday morning Misery gave each of the sub-foremen an envelope\r\ncontaining one of the firm\'s memorandum forms.  Crass opened his and\r\nfound the following:\r\n\r\nCrass\r\n\r\nWhen you are on a job with men under you, check and initial their\r\ntime-sheets every night.\r\n\r\nIf they are called away and sent to some other job, or stood off, check\r\nand initial their time-sheets as they leave your job.\r\n\r\nAny man coming on your job during the day, you must take note of the\r\nexact time of his arrival, and see that his sheet is charged right.\r\n\r\nAny man who is slow or lazy, or any man that you notice talking more\r\nthan is necessary during working hours, you must report him to Mr\r\nHunter.  We expect you and the other foremen to help us to carry out\r\nthese rules, AND ANY INFORMATION GIVEN US ABOUT ANY MAN IS TREATED IN\r\nCONFIDENCE.\r\n\r\nRushton & Co.\r\n\r\nNote: This applies to all men of all trades who come on the jobs of\r\nwhich you are the foreman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery week the time-sheets were scrutinized, and every now and then a\r\nman would be \'had up on the carpet\' in the office before Rushton and\r\nMisery, and interrogated as to why he had taken fifteen hours to do ten\r\nhours work?  In the event of the accused being unable to give a\r\nsatisfactory explanation of his conduct he was usually sacked on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nMisery was frequently called \'up on the carpet\' himself.\r\n\r\nIf he made a mistake in figuring out a \'job\', and gave in too high a\r\ntender for it, so that the firm did not get the work, Rushton grumbled.\r\nIf the price was so low that there was not enough profit, Rushton was\r\nvery unpleasant about it, and whenever it happened that there was not\r\nonly no profit but an actual loss, Rushton created such a terrible\r\ndisturbance that Misery was nearly frightened to death and used to get\r\non his bicycle and rush off to the nearest \'job\' and howl and bellow at\r\nthe \'chaps\' to get it done.\r\n\r\nAll the time the capabilities of the men--especially with regard to\r\nspeed--were carefully watched and noted: and whenever there was a\r\nslackness of work and it was necessary to discharge some hands those\r\nthat were slow or took too much pains were weeded out: this of course\r\nwas known to the men and it had the desired effect upon them.\r\n\r\nIn justice to Rushton and Hunter, it must be remembered that there was\r\na certain amount of excuse for all this driving and cheating, because\r\nthey had to compete with all the other firms, who conducted their\r\nbusiness in precisely the same way.  It was not their fault, but the\r\nfault of the system.\r\n\r\nA dozen firms tendered for every \'job\', and of course the lowest tender\r\nusually obtained the work.  Knowing this, they all cut the price down\r\nto the lowest possible figure and the workmen had to suffer.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was that there were too many \'masters\'.  It would have been\r\nfar better for the workmen if nine out of every ten of the employers\r\nhad never started business.  Then the others would have been able to\r\nget a better price for their work, and the men might have had better\r\nwages and conditions.  The hands, however, made no such allowances or\r\nexcuses as these for Misery and Rushton.  They never thought or spoke\r\nof them except with hatred and curses.  But whenever either of them\r\ncame to the \'job\' the \'coddies\' cringed and grovelled before them,\r\ngreeting them with disgustingly servile salutations, plentifully\r\ninterspersed with the word \'Sir\', greetings which were frequently\r\neither ignored altogether or answered with an inarticulate grunt.  They\r\nsaid \'Sir\' at nearly every second word: it made one feel sick to hear\r\nthem because it was not courtesy: they were never courteous to each\r\nother, it was simply abject servility and self-contempt.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of all the frenzied hurrying was that every now and\r\nthen there was an accident: somebody got hurt: and it was strange that\r\naccidents were not more frequent, considering the risks that were\r\ntaken.  When they happened to be working on ladders in busy streets\r\nthey were not often allowed to have anyone to stand at the foot, and\r\nthe consequence was that all sorts and conditions of people came into\r\nviolent collision with the bottoms of the ladders.  Small boys playing\r\nin the reckless manner characteristic of their years rushed up against\r\nthem.  Errand boys, absorbed in the perusal of penny instalments of the\r\nadventures of Claude Duval, and carrying large baskets of\r\ngreen-groceries, wandered into them.  Blind men fell foul of them.\r\nAdventurous schoolboys climbed up them.  People with large feet became\r\nentangled in them.  Fat persons of both sexes who thought it unlucky to\r\nwalk underneath, tried to negotiate the narrow strip of pavement\r\nbetween the foot of the ladder and the kerb, and in their passage\r\nknocked up against the ladder and sometimes fell into the road.\r\nNursemaids wheeling perambulators--lolling over the handle, which they\r\nusually held with their left hands, the right holding a copy of Orange\r\nBlossoms or some halfpenny paper, and so interested in the story of the\r\nMarquis of Lymejuice--a young man of noble presence and fabulous\r\nwealth, with a drooping golden moustache and very long legs, who,\r\nnotwithstanding the diabolical machinations of Lady Sibyl Malvoise, who\r\nloves him as well as a woman with a name like that is capable of loving\r\nanyone, is determined to wed none other than the scullery-maid at the\r\nVillage Inn--inevitably bashed the perambulators into the ladders.\r\nEven when the girls were not reading they nearly always ran into the\r\nladders, which seemed to possess a magnetic attraction for\r\nperambulators and go-carts of all kinds, whether propelled by nurses or\r\nmothers.  Sometimes they would advance very cautiously towards the\r\nladder: then, when they got very near, hesitate a little whether to go\r\nunder or run the risk of falling into the street by essaying the narrow\r\npassage: then they would get very close up to the foot of the ladder,\r\nand dodge and dance about, and give the cart little pushes from side to\r\nside, until at last the magnetic influence exerted itself and the\r\nperambulator crashed into the ladder, perhaps at the very moment that\r\nthe man at the top was stretching out to do some part of the work\r\nalmost beyond his reach.\r\n\r\nOnce Harlow had just started painting some rainpipes from the top of a\r\n40-ft ladder when one of several small boys who were playing in the\r\nstreet ran violently against the foot.  Harlow was so startled that he\r\ndropped his brushes and clutched wildly at the ladder, which turned\r\ncompletely round and slid about six feet along the parapet into the\r\nangle of the wall, with Harlow hanging beneath by his hands.  The paint\r\npot was hanging by a hook from one of the rungs, and the jerk scattered\r\nthe brown paint it contained all over Harlow and all over the brickwork\r\nof the front of the house.  He managed to descend safely by clasping\r\nhis legs round the sides of the ladder and sliding down. When Misery\r\ncame there was a row about what he called carelessness. And the next\r\nday Harlow had to wear his Sunday trousers to work.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion they were painting the outside of a house called\r\n\'Gothic Lodge\'.  At one corner it had a tower surmounted by a spire or\r\nsteeple, and this steeple terminated with an ornamental wrought-iron\r\npinnacle which had to be painted.  The ladder they had was not quite\r\nlong enough, and besides that, as it had to stand in a sort of a\r\ncourtyard at the base of the tower, it was impossible to slant it\r\nsufficiently: instead of lying along the roof of the steeple, it was\r\nsticking up in the air.\r\n\r\nWhen Easton went up to paint the pinnacle he had to stand on almost the\r\nvery top rung of the ladder, to be exact, the third from the top, and\r\nlean over to steady himself by holding on to the pinnacle with his left\r\nhand while he used the brush with his right.  As it was only about\r\ntwenty minutes\' work there were two men to hold the foot of the ladder.\r\n\r\nIt was cheaper to do it this way than to rig up a proper scaffold,\r\nwhich would have entailed perhaps two hours\' work for two or three men.\r\nOf course it was very dangerous, but that did not matter at all,\r\nbecause even if the man fell it would make no difference to the\r\nfirm--all the men were insured and somehow or other, although they\r\nfrequently had narrow escapes, they did not often come to grief.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, just as Easton was finishing he felt the pinnacle\r\nthat he was holding on to give way, and he got such a fright that his\r\nheart nearly stopped beating.  He let go his hold and steadied himself\r\non the ladder as well as he was able, and when he had descended three\r\nor four steps--into comparative safety--he remained clinging\r\nconvulsively to the ladder and feeling so limp that he was unable to go\r\ndown any further for several minutes.  When he arrived at the bottom\r\nand the others noticed how white and trembling he was, he told them\r\nabout the pinnacle being loose, and the \'coddy\' coming along just then,\r\nthey told him about it, and suggested that it should be repaired, as\r\notherwise it might fall down and hurt someone: but the \'coddy\' was\r\nafraid that if they reported it they might be blamed for breaking it,\r\nand the owner might expect the firm to put it right for nothing, so\r\nthey decided to say nothing about it.  The pinnacle is still on the\r\napex of the steeple waiting for a sufficiently strong wind to blow it\r\ndown on somebody\'s head.\r\n\r\nWhen the other men heard of Easton\'s \'narrow shave\', most of them said\r\nthat it would have served him bloody well right if he had fallen and\r\nbroken his neck: he should have refused to go up at all without a\r\nproper scaffold.  That was what THEY would have done.  If Misery or the\r\ncoddy had ordered any of THEM to go up and paint the pinnacle off that\r\nladder, they would have chucked their tools down and demanded their\r\nha\'pence!\r\n\r\nThat was what they said, but somehow or other it never happened that\r\nany of them ever \'chucked their tools down\' at all, although such\r\ndangerous jobs were of very frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe scamping business was not confined to houses or properties of an\r\ninferior class: it was the general rule.  Large good-class houses,\r\nvillas and mansions, the residences of wealthy people, were done in\r\nexactly the same way.  Generally in such places costly and beautiful\r\nmaterials were spoilt in the using.\r\n\r\nThere was a large mansion where the interior woodwork--the doors,\r\nwindows and staircase--had to be finished in white enamel.  It was\r\nrather an old house and the woodwork needed rubbing down and filling up\r\nbefore being repainted, but of course there was not time for that, so\r\nthey painted it without properly preparing it and when it was enamelled\r\nthe rough, uneven surface of the wood looked horrible: but the owner\r\nappeared quite satisfied because it was nice and shiny.  The\r\ndining-room of the same house was papered with a beautiful and\r\nexpensive plush paper.  The ground of this wall-hanging was made to\r\nimitate crimson watered silk, and it was covered with a raised pattern\r\nin plush of the same colour.  The price marked on the back of this\r\npaper in the pattern book was eighteen shillings a roll.  Slyme was\r\npaid sixpence a roll for hanging it: the room took ten rolls, so it\r\ncost nine pounds for the paper and five shillings to hang it!  To fix\r\nsuch a paper as this properly the walls should first be done with a\r\nplain lining paper of the same colour as the ground of the wallpaper\r\nitself, because unless the paperhanger \'lapps\' the joints--which should\r\nnot be done--they are apt to open a little as the paper dries and to\r\nshow the white wall underneath--Slyme suggested this lining to Misery,\r\nwho would not entertain the idea for a moment--they had gone to quite\r\nenough expense as it was, stripping the old paper off!\r\n\r\nSo Slyme went ahead, and as he had to make his wages, he could not\r\nspend a great deal of time over it.  Some of the joints were \'lapped\'\r\nand some were butted, and two or three weeks after the owner of the\r\nhouse moved in, as the paper became more dry, the joints began to open\r\nand to show the white plaster of the wall, and then Owen had to go\r\nthere with a small pot of crimson paint and a little brush, and touch\r\nout the white line.\r\n\r\nWhile he was doing this he noticed and touched up a number of other\r\nfaults; places where Slyme--in his haste to get the work done--had\r\nslobbered and smeared the face of the paper with fingermarks and paste.\r\n\r\nThe same ghastly mess was made of several other \'jobs\' besides this\r\none, and presently they adopted the plan of painting strips of colour\r\non the wall in the places where the joints would come, so that if they\r\nopened the white wall would not show: but it was found that the paste\r\non the back of the paper dragged the paint off the wall, and when the\r\njoints opened the white streaks showed all the same, so Misery\r\nabandoned all attempts to prevent joints showing, and if a customer\r\ncomplained, he sent someone to \'touch it up\': but the lining paper was\r\nnever used, unless the customer or the architect knew enough about the\r\nwork to insist upon it.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the same house the ceilings, the friezes, and the\r\ndados, were covered with \'embossed\' or \'relief\' papers.  These hangings\r\nrequire very careful handling, for the raised parts are easily damaged;\r\nbut the men who fixed them were not allowed to take the pains and time\r\nnecessary to make good work: consequently in many places--especially at\r\nthe joints--the pattern was flattened out and obliterated.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of the drawing-room was done with a very thick high-relief\r\npaper that was made in sheets about two feet square.  These squares\r\nwere not very true in shape: they had evidently warped in drying after\r\nmanufacture: to make them match anything like properly would need\r\nconsiderable time and care.  But the men were not allowed to take the\r\nnecessary time.  The result was that when it was finished it presented\r\na sort of \'higgledy-piggledy\' appearance.  But it didn\'t matter:\r\nnothing seemed to matter except to get it done.  One would think from\r\nthe way the hands were driven and chivvied and hurried over the work\r\nthat they were being paid five or six shillings an hour instead of as\r\nmany pence.\r\n\r\n\'Get it done!\' shouted Misery from morning till night.  \'For God\'s sake\r\nget it done!  Haven\'t you finished yet?  We\'re losing money over this\r\n"job"!  If you chaps don\'t wake up and move a bit quicker, I shall see\r\nif I can\'t get somebody else who will.\'\r\n\r\nThese costly embossed decorations were usually finished in white; but\r\ninstead of carefully coating them with specially prepared paint of\r\npatent distemper, which would need two or three coats, they slobbered\r\none thick coat of common whitewash on to it with ordinary whitewash\r\nbrushes.\r\n\r\nThis was a most economical way to get over it, because it made it\r\nunnecessary to stop up the joints beforehand--the whitewash filled up\r\nall the cracks: and it also filled up the hollow parts, the crevices\r\nand interstices of the ornament, destroying the sharp outlines of the\r\nbeautiful designs and reducing the whole to a lumpy, formless mass. But\r\nthat did not matter either, so long as they got it done.\r\n\r\nThe architect didn\'t notice it, because he knew that the more Rushton &\r\nCo. made out of the \'job\', the more he himself would make.\r\n\r\nThe man who had to pay for the work didn\'t notice it; he had the\r\nfullest confidence in the architect.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of wearying the long-suffering reader, mention must be made\r\nof an affair that happened at this particular \'job\'.\r\n\r\nThe windows were all fitted with venetian blinds.  The gentleman for\r\nwhom all the work was being done had only just purchased the house, but\r\nhe preferred roller blinds: he had had roller blinds in his former\r\nresidence--which he had just sold--and as these roller blinds were\r\nabout the right size, he decided to have them fitted to the windows of\r\nhis new house: so he instructed Mr Rushton to have all the venetian\r\nblinds taken down and stored away up in the loft under the roof.  Mr\r\nRushton promised to have this done; but they were not ALL put away\r\nunder the roof: he had four of them taken to his own place and fitted\r\nup in the conservatory.  They were a little too large, so they had to\r\nbe narrowed before they were fixed.\r\n\r\nThe sequel was rather interesting, for it happened that when the\r\ngentleman attempted to take the roller blinds from his old house, the\r\nperson to whom he had sold it refused to allow them to be removed;\r\nclaiming that when he bought the house, he bought the blinds also.\r\nThere was a little dispute, but eventually it was settled that way and\r\nthe gentleman decided that he would have the venetian blinds in his new\r\nhouse after all, and instructed the people who moved his furniture to\r\ntake the venetians down again from under the roof, and refix them, and\r\nthen, of course, it was discovered that four of the blinds were\r\nmissing.  Mr Rushton was sent for, and he said that he couldn\'t\r\nunderstand it at all!  The only possible explanation that he could\r\nthink of was that some of his workmen must have stolen them!  He would\r\nmake inquiries, and endeavour to discover the culprits, but in any\r\ncase, as this had happened while things were in his charge, if he did\r\nnot succeed in recovering them, he would replace them.\r\n\r\nAs the blinds had been narrowed to fit the conservatory he had to have\r\nfour new ones made.\r\n\r\nThe customer was of course quite satisfied, although very sorry for Mr\r\nRushton.  They had a little chat about it.  Rushton told the gentleman\r\nthat he would be astonished if he knew all the facts: the difficulties\r\none has to contend with in dealing with working men: one has to watch\r\nthem continually! directly one\'s back is turned they leave off working!\r\nThey come late in the morning, and go home before the proper time at\r\nnight, and then unless one actually happens to catch them--they charge\r\nthe full number of hours on their time sheets!  Every now and then\r\nsomething would be missing, and of course Nobody knew anything about\r\nit.  Sometimes one would go unexpectedly to a \'job\' and find a lot of\r\nthem drunk.  Of course one tried to cope with these evils by means of\r\nrules and restrictions and organization, but it was very difficult--one\r\ncould not be everywhere or have eyes at the back of one\'s head.  The\r\ngentleman said that he had some idea of what it was like: he had had\r\nsomething to do with the lower orders himself at one time and another,\r\nand he knew they needed a lot of watching.\r\n\r\nRushton felt rather sick over this affair, but he consoled himself by\r\nreflecting that he had got clear away with several valuable rose trees\r\nand other plants which he had stolen out of the garden, and that a\r\nladder which had been discovered in the hayloft over the stable and\r\ntaken--by his instructions--to the \'yard\' when the \'job\' was finished\r\nhad not been missed.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which helped to compensate for the blinds was that\r\nthe brass fittings throughout the house, finger-plates, sash-lifts and\r\nlocks, bolts and door handles, which were supposed to be all new and\r\nwhich the customer had paid a good price for--were really all the old\r\nones which Misery had had re-lacquered and refixed.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing unusual about this affair of the blinds, for Rushton\r\nand Misery robbed everybody.  They made a practice of annexing every\r\nthing they could lay their hands upon, provided it could be done\r\nwithout danger to themselves.  They never did anything of a heroic or\r\ndare-devil character: they had not the courage to break into banks or\r\njewellers\' shops in the middle of the night, or to go out picking\r\npockets: all their robberies were of the sneak-thief order.\r\n\r\nAt one house that they \'did up\' Misery made a big haul.  He had to get\r\nup into the loft under the roof to see what was the matter with the\r\nwater tank.  When he got up there he found a very fine hall gas lamp\r\nmade of wrought brass and copper with stained and painted glass sides.\r\nAlthough covered with dust, it was otherwise in perfect condition, so\r\nMisery had it taken to his own house and cleaned up and fixed in the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nIn the same loft there were a lot of old brass picture rods and other\r\nfittings, and three very good planks, each about ten feet in length;\r\nthese latter had been placed across the rafters so that one could walk\r\neasily and safely over to the tank. But Misery thought they would be\r\nvery useful to the firm for whitewashing ceilings and other work, so he\r\nhad them taken to the yard along with the old brass, which was worth\r\nabout fourpence a pound.\r\n\r\nThere was another house that had to be painted inside: the people who\r\nused to live there had only just left: they had moved to some other\r\ntown, and the house had been re-let before they vacated it.  The new\r\ntenant had agreed with the agent that the house was to be renovated\r\nthroughout before he took possession.\r\n\r\nThe day after the old tenants moved away, the agent gave Rushton the\r\nkey so that he could go to see what was to be done and give an estimate\r\nfor the work.\r\n\r\nWhile Rushton and Misery were looking over the house they discovered a\r\nlarge barometer hanging on the wall behind the front door: it had been\r\noverlooked by those who removed the furniture.  Before returning the\r\nkey to the agent, Rushton sent one of his men to the house for the\r\nbarometer, which he kept in his office for a few weeks to see if there\r\nwould be any inquiries about it.  If there had been, it would have been\r\neasy to say that he had brought it there for safety--to take care of\r\ntill he could find the owner.  The people to whom it belonged thought\r\nthe thing had been lost or stolen in transit, and afterwards one of the\r\nworkmen who had assisted to pack and remove the furniture was dismissed\r\nfrom his employment on suspicion of having had something to do with its\r\ndisappearance.  No one ever thought of Rushton in connection with the\r\nmatter, so after about a month he had it taken to his own dwelling and\r\nhung up in the hall near the carved oak marble-topped console table\r\nthat he had sneaked last summer from 596 Grand Parade.\r\n\r\nAnd there it hangs unto this day: and close behind it, supported by\r\ncords of crimson silk, is a beautiful bevelled-edged card about a foot\r\nsquare, and upon this card is written, in letters of gold: \'Christ is\r\nthe head of this house; the unseen Guest at every meal, the silent\r\nListener to every conversation.\'\r\n\r\nAnd on the other side of the barometer is another card of the same kind\r\nand size which says: \'As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.\'\r\n\r\nFrom another place they stole two large brass chandeliers.  This house\r\nhad been empty for a very long time, and its owner--who did not reside\r\nin the town--wished to sell it.  The agent, to improve the chances of a\r\nsale, decided to have the house overhauled and redecorated.  Rushton &\r\nCo.\'s tender being the lowest, they got the work.  The chandeliers in\r\nthe drawing-room and the dining-room were of massive brass, but they\r\nwere all blackened and tarnished.  Misery suggested to the agent that\r\nthey could be cleaned and relacquered, which would make them equal to\r\nnew: in fact, they would be better than new ones, for such things as\r\nthese were not made now, and for once Misery was telling the truth.\r\nThe agent agreed and the work was done: it was an extra, of course, and\r\nas the firm got twice as much for the job as they paid for having it\r\ndone, they were almost satisfied.\r\n\r\nWhen this and all the other work was finished they sent in their\r\naccount and were paid.\r\n\r\nSome months afterwards the house was sold, and Nimrod interviewed the\r\nnew proprietor with the object of securing the order for any work that\r\nhe might want done.  He was successful.  The papers on the walls of\r\nseveral of the rooms were not to the new owner\'s taste, and, of course,\r\nthe woodwork would have to be re-painted to harmonize with the new\r\npaper.  There was a lot of other work besides this: a new conservatory\r\nto build, a more modern bath and heating apparatus to be put in, and\r\nthe electric light to be installed, the new people having an objection\r\nto the use of gas.\r\n\r\nThe specifications were prepared by an architect, and Rushton secured\r\nthe work.  When the chandeliers were taken down, the men, instructed by\r\nMisery, put them on a handcart, and covered them over with sacks and\r\ndust-sheets and took them to the front shop, where they were placed for\r\nsale with the other stock.\r\n\r\nWhen all the work at the house was finished, it occurred to Rushton and\r\nNimrod that when the architect came to examine and pass the work before\r\ngiving them the certificate that would enable them to present their\r\naccount, he might remember the chandeliers and inquire what had become\r\nof them.  So they were again placed on the handcart, covered with sacks\r\nand dust-sheets, taken back to the house and put up in the loft under\r\nthe roof so that, if he asked for them, there they were.\r\n\r\nThe architect came, looked ever the house, passed the work, and gave\r\nhis certificate; he never mentioned or thought of the chandeliers. The\r\nowner of the house was present and asked for Rushton\'s bill, for which\r\nhe at once gave them a cheque and Rushton and Misery almost grovelled\r\nand wallowed on the ground before him.  Throughout the whole interview\r\nthe architect and the \'gentleman\' had kept their hats on, but Rushton\r\nand Nimrod had been respectfully uncovered all the time, and as they\r\nfollowed the other two about the house their bearing had been\r\nexpressive of the most abject servility.\r\n\r\nWhen the architect and the owner were gone the two chandeliers were\r\ntaken down again from under the roof, and put upon a handcart, covered\r\nover with sacks and dust-sheets and taken back to the shop and again\r\nplaced for sale with the other stock.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the petty thefts committed by these people. To\r\ngive anything approaching a full account of all the rest would require\r\na separate volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of all the hurrying and scamping, every now and again the\r\nmen found that they had worked themselves out of a job.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the summer the firm had scarcely anything to do,\r\nand nearly everybody had to stand off for a few days or weeks.\r\n\r\nWhen Newman got his first start in the early part of the year he had\r\nonly been working for about a fortnight when--with several others--he\r\nwas \'stood off\'.  Fortunately, however, the day after he left Rushtons,\r\nhe was lucky enough to get a start for another firm, Driver and\r\nBotchit, where he worked for nearly a month, and then he was again\r\ngiven a job at Rushton\'s, who happened to be busy again.\r\n\r\nHe did not have to lose much time, for he \'finished up\' for Driver and\r\nBotchit on a Thursday night and on the Friday he interviewed Misery,\r\nwho told him they were about to commence a fresh \'job\' on the following\r\nMonday morning at six o\'clock, and that he could start with them.  So\r\nthis time Newman was only out of work the Friday and Saturday, which\r\nwas another stroke of luck, because it often happens that a man has to\r\nlose a week or more after \'finishing up\' for one firm before he gets\r\nanother \'job\'.\r\n\r\nAll through the summer Crass continued to be the general \'colour-man\',\r\nmost of his time being spent at the shop mixing up colours for all the\r\ndifferent \'jobs\'.  He also acted as a sort of lieutenant to Hunter,\r\nwho, as the reader has already been informed, was not a practical\r\npainter.  When there was a price to be given for some painting work,\r\nMisery sometimes took Crass with him to look over it and help him to\r\nestimate the amount of time and material it would take.  Crass was thus\r\nin a position of more than ordinary importance, not only being superior\r\nto the \'hands\', but also ranking above the other sub-foremen who had\r\ncharge of the \'jobs\'.\r\n\r\nIt was Crass and these sub-foremen who were to blame for most of the\r\nscamping and driving, because if it had not been for them neither\r\nRushton nor Hunter would have known how to scheme the work.\r\n\r\nOf course, Hunter and Rushton wanted to drive and scamp, but not being\r\npractical men they would not have known how if it had not been for\r\nCrass and the others, who put them up to all the tricks of the trade.\r\n\r\nCrass knew that when the men stayed till half past seven they were in\r\nthe habit of ceasing work for a few minutes to eat a mouthful of grub\r\nabout six o\'clock, so he suggested to Misery that as it was not\r\npossible to stop this, it would be a good plan to make the men stop\r\nwork altogether from half past five till six, and lose half an hour\'s\r\npay; and to make up the time, instead of leaving off at seven-thirty,\r\nthey could work till eight.\r\n\r\nMisery had known of and winked at the former practice, for he knew that\r\nthe men could not work all that time without something to eat, but\r\nCrass\'s suggestion seemed a much better way, and it was adopted.\r\n\r\nWhen the other masters in Mugsborough heard of this great reform they\r\nall followed suit, and it became the rule in that town, whenever it was\r\nnecessary to work overtime, for the men to stay till eight instead of\r\nhalf past seven as formerly, and they got no more pay than before.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this summer it had been the almost invariable rule to have\r\ntwo men in each room that was being painted, but Crass pointed out to\r\nMisery that under such circumstances they wasted time talking to each\r\nother, and they also acted as a check on one another: each of them\r\nregulated the amount of work he did by the amount the other did, and if\r\nthe \'job\' took too long it was always difficult to decide which of the\r\ntwo was to blame: but if they were made to work alone, each of them\r\nwould be on his mettle; he would not know how much the others were\r\ndoing, and the fear of being considered slow in comparison with others\r\nwould make them all tear into it all they could.\r\n\r\nMisery thought this a very good idea, so the solitary system was\r\nintroduced, and as far as practicable, one room, one man became the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThey even tried to make the men distemper large ceilings single-handed,\r\nand succeeded in one or two cases, but after several ceilings had been\r\nspoilt and had to be washed off and done over again, they gave that up:\r\nbut nearly all the other work was now arranged on the \'solitary\r\nsystem\', and it worked splendidly: each man was constantly in a state\r\nof panic as to whether the others were doing more work than himself.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion that Crass made to Misery was that the sub-foremen\r\nshould be instructed never to send a man into a room to prepare it for\r\npainting.\r\n\r\n\'If you sends a man into a room to get it ready,\' said Crass, \'\'e makes\r\na meal of it!  \'E spends as much time messin\' about rubbin\' down and\r\nstoppin\' up as it would take to paint it.  But,\' he added, with a\r\ncunning leer, \'give \'em a bit of putty and a little bit of glass-paper,\r\nand the paint at the stand, and then \'e gits it in \'is mind as \'e\'s\r\ngoing in there to paint it!  And \'e doesn\'t mess about much over the\r\npreparing of it\'.\r\n\r\nThese and many other suggestions--all sorts of devices for scamping and\r\ngetting over the work--were schemed out by Crass and the other\r\nsub-foremen, who put them into practice and showed them to Misery and\r\nRushton in the hope of currying favour with them and being \'kept on\'.\r\nAnd between the lot of them they made life a veritable hell for\r\nthemselves, and the hands, and everybody else around them.  And the\r\nmainspring of it all was--the greed and selfishness of one man, who\r\ndesired to accumulate money!  For this was the only object of all the\r\ndriving and bullying and hatred and cursing and unhappiness--to make\r\nmoney for Rushton, who evidently considered himself a deserving case.\r\n\r\nIt is sad and discreditable, but nevertheless true, that some of the\r\nmore selfish of the philanthropists often became weary of well-doing,\r\nand lost all enthusiasm in the good cause.  At such times they used to\r\nsay that they were \'Bloody well fed up\' with the whole business and\r\n\'Tired of tearing their bloody guts out for the benefit of other\r\npeople\' and every now and then some of these fellows would \'chuck up\'\r\nwork, and go on the booze, sometimes stopping away for two or three\r\ndays or a week at a time.  And then, when it was all over, they came\r\nback, very penitent, to ask for another \'start\', but they generally\r\nfound that their places had been filled.\r\n\r\nIf they happened to be good \'sloggers\'--men who made a practice of\r\n\'tearing their guts out\' when they did work--they were usually\r\nforgiven, and after being admonished by Misery, permitted to resume\r\nwork, with the understanding that if ever it occurred again they would\r\nget the \'infernal\'--which means the final and irrevocable--sack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a job at a shop that had been a high-class restaurant\r\nkept by a renowned Italian chef.  It had been known as\r\n\r\n                    \'MACARONI\'S ROYAL ITALIAN CAFE\'\r\n\r\nSituated on the Grand Parade, it was a favourite resort of the \'Elite\',\r\nwho frequented it for afternoon tea and coffee and for little suppers\r\nafter the theatre.\r\n\r\nIt had plate-glass windows, resplendent with gilding, marble-topped\r\ntables with snow white covers, vases of flowers, and all the other\r\nappurtenances of glittering cut glass and silver.  The obsequious\r\nwaiters were in evening dress, the walls were covered with lofty\r\nplate-glass mirrors in carved and gilded frames, and at certain hours\r\nof the day and night an orchestra consisting of two violins and a harp\r\ndiscoursed selections of classic music.\r\n\r\nBut of late years the business had not been paying, and finally the\r\nproprietor went bankrupt and was sold out.  The place was shut up for\r\nseveral months before the shop was let to a firm of dealers in fancy\r\narticles, and the other part was transformed into flats.\r\n\r\nRushton had the contract for the work.  When the men went there to \'do\r\nit up\' they found the interior of the house in a state of indescribable\r\nfilth: the ceilings discoloured with smoke and hung with cobwebs, the\r\nwallpapers smeared and black with grease, the handrails and the newel\r\nposts of the staircase were clammy with filth, and the edges of the\r\ndoors near the handles were blackened with greasy dirt and\r\nfinger-marks.  The tops of the skirtings, the mouldings of the doors,\r\nthe sashes of the windows and the corners of the floors were thick with\r\nthe accumulated dust of years.\r\n\r\nIn one of the upper rooms which had evidently been used as a nursery or\r\nplayroom for the children of the renowned chef, the wallpaper for about\r\ntwo feet above the skirting was blackened with grease and ornamented\r\nwith childish drawings made with burnt sticks and blacklead pencils,\r\nthe door being covered with similar artistic efforts, to say nothing of\r\nsome rude attempts at carving, evidently executed with an axe or a\r\nhammer.  But all this filth was nothing compared with the unspeakable\r\ncondition of the kitchen and scullery, a detailed description of which\r\nwould cause the blood of the reader to curdle, and each particular hair\r\nof his head to stand on end.\r\n\r\nLet it suffice to say that the walls, the ceiling, the floor, the\r\npaintwork, the gas-stove, the kitchen range, the dresser and everything\r\nelse were uniformly absolutely and literally--black.  And the black was\r\ncomposed of soot and grease.\r\n\r\nIn front of the window there was a fixture--a kind of bench or table,\r\ndeeply scored with marks of knives like a butcher\'s block.  The sill of\r\nthe window was about six inches lower than the top of the table, so\r\nthat between the glass of the lower sash of the window, which had\r\nevidently never been raised, and the back of the table, there was a\r\nlong narrow cavity or trough, about six inches deep, four inches wide\r\nand as long as the width of the window, the sill forming the bottom of\r\nthe cavity.\r\n\r\nThis trough was filled with all manner of abominations: fragments of\r\nfat and decomposed meat, legs of rabbits and fowls, vegetable matter,\r\nbroken knives and forks, and hair: and the glass of the window was\r\ncaked with filth of the same description.\r\n\r\nThis job was the cause of the sacking of the Semi-drunk and another man\r\nnamed Bill Bates, who were sent into the kitchen to clean it down and\r\nprepare it for painting and distempering.\r\n\r\nThey commenced to do it, but it made them feel so ill that they went\r\nout and had a pint each, and after that they made another start at it.\r\nBut it was not long before they felt that it was imperatively necessary\r\nto have another drink.  So they went over to the pub, and this time\r\nthey had two pints each.  Bill paid for the first two and then the\r\nSemi-drunk refused to return to work unless Bill would consent to have\r\nanother pint with him before going back.  When they had drunk the two\r\npints, they decided--in order to save themselves the trouble and risk\r\nof coming away from the job--to take a couple of quarts back with them\r\nin two bottles, which the landlord of the pub lent them, charging\r\ntwopence on each bottle, to be refunded when they were returned.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to the job they found the \'coddy\' in the kitchen,\r\nlooking for them and he began to talk and grumble, but the Semi-drunk\r\nsoon shut him up: he told him he could either have a drink out of one\r\nof the bottles or a punch in the bloody nose--whichever he liked!  Or\r\nif he did not fancy either of these alternatives, he could go to hell!\r\n\r\nAs the \'coddy\' was a sensible man he took the beer and advised them to\r\npull themselves together and try to get some work done before Misery\r\ncame, which they promised to do.\r\n\r\nWhen the \'coddy\' was gone they made another attempt at the work. Misery\r\ncame a little while afterwards and began shouting at them because he\r\nsaid he could not see what they had done.  It looked as if they had\r\nbeen asleep all the morning: Here it was nearly ten o\'clock, and as far\r\nas he could see, they had done Nothing!\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone they drank the rest of the beer and then they began to\r\nfeel inclined to laugh.  What did they care for Hunter or Rushton\r\neither?  To hell with both of \'em!  They left off scraping and\r\nscrubbing, and began throwing buckets of water over the dresser and the\r\nwalls, laughing uproariously all the time.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll show the b--s how to wash down paintwork!\' shouted the\r\nSemi-drunk, as he stood in the middle of the room and hurled a pailful\r\nof water over the door of the cupboard.  \'Bring us another bucket of\r\nwater, Bill.\'\r\n\r\nBill was out in the scullery filling his pail under the tap, and\r\nlaughing so much that he could scarcely stand.  As soon as it was full\r\nhe passed it to the Semi-drunk, who threw it bodily, pail and all, on\r\nto the bench in front of the window, smashing one of the panes of\r\nglass.  The water poured off the table and all over the floor.\r\n\r\nBill brought the next pailful in and threw it at the kitchen door,\r\nsplitting one of the panels from top to bottom, and then they threw\r\nabout half a dozen more pailfuls over the dresser.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll show the b--rs how to clean paintwork,\' they shouted, as they\r\nhurled the buckets at the walls and doors.\r\n\r\nBy this time the floor was deluged with water, which mingled with the\r\nfilth and formed a sea of mud.\r\n\r\nThey left the two taps running in the scullery and as the waste pipe of\r\nthe sink was choked up with dirt, the sink filled up and overflowed\r\nlike a miniature Niagara.\r\n\r\nThe water ran out under the doors into the back-yard, and along the\r\npassage out to the front door.  But Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk\r\nremained in the kitchen, smashing the pails at the walls and doors and\r\nthe dresser, and cursing and laughing hysterically.\r\n\r\nThey had just filled the two buckets and were bringing them into the\r\nkitchen when they heard Hunter\'s voice in the passage, shouting out\r\ninquiries as to where all that water came from.  Then they heard him\r\nadvancing towards them and they stood waiting for him with the pails in\r\ntheir hands, and directly he opened the door and put his head into the\r\nroom they let fly the two pails at him.  Unfortunately, they were too\r\ndrunk and excited to aim straight.  One pail struck the middle rail of\r\nthe door and the other the wall by the side of it.\r\n\r\nMisery hastily shut the door again and ran upstairs, and presently the\r\n\'coddy\' came down and called out to them from the passage.\r\n\r\nThey went out to see what he wanted, and he told them that Misery had\r\ngone to the office to get their wages ready: they were to make out\r\ntheir time sheets and go for their money at once. Misery had said that\r\nif they were not there in ten minutes he would have the pair of them\r\nlocked up.\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk said that nothing would suit them better than to have\r\nall their pieces at once--they had spent all their money and wanted\r\nanother drink.  Bill Bates concurred, so they borrowed a piece of\r\nblacklead pencil from the \'coddy\' and made out their time sheets, took\r\noff their aprons, put them into their tool bags, and went to the office\r\nfor their money, which Misery passed out to them through the trap-door.\r\n\r\nThe news of this exploit spread all over the town during that day and\r\nevening, and although it was in July, the next morning at six o\'clock\r\nthere were half a dozen men waiting at the yard to ask Misery if there\r\nwas \'any chance of a job\'.\r\n\r\nBill Bates and the Semi-drunk had had their spree and had got the sack\r\nfor it and most of the chaps said it served them right.  Such conduct\r\nas that was going too far.\r\n\r\nMost of them would have said the same thing no matter what the\r\ncircumstances might have been.  They had very little sympathy for each\r\nother at any time.\r\n\r\nOften, when, for instance, one man was sent away from one \'job\' to\r\nanother, the others would go into his room and look at the work he had\r\nbeen doing, and pick out all the faults they could find and show them\r\nto each other, making all sorts of ill-natured remarks about the absent\r\none meanwhile.  \'Jist run yer nose over that door, Jim,\' one would say\r\nin a tone of disgust.  \'Wotcher think of it?  Did yer ever see sich a\r\nmess in yer life?  Calls hisself a painter!\'  And the other man would\r\nshake his head sadly and say that although the one who had done it had\r\nnever been up to much as a workman, he could do it a bit better than\r\nthat if he liked, but the fact was that he never gave himself time to\r\ndo anything properly: he was always tearing his bloody guts out!  Why,\r\nhe\'d only been in this room about four hours from start to finish!  He\r\nought to have a watering cart to follow him about, because he worked at\r\nsuch a hell of a rate you couldn\'t see him for dust!  And then the\r\nfirst man would reply that other people could do as they liked, but for\r\nhis part, HE was not going to tear his guts out for nobody!\r\n\r\nThe second man would applaud these sentiments and say that he wasn\'t\r\ngoing to tear his out either: and then they would both go back to their\r\nrespective rooms and tear into the work for all they were worth, making\r\nthe same sort of \'job\' as the one they had been criticizing, and\r\nafterwards, when the other\'s back was turned, each of them in turn\r\nwould sneak into the other\'s room and criticize it and point out the\r\nfaults to anyone else who happened to be near at hand.\r\n\r\nHarlow was working at the place that had been Macaroni\'s Cafe when one\r\nday a note was sent to him from Hunter at the shop.  It was written on\r\na scrap of wallpaper, and worded in the usual manner of such notes--as\r\nif the writer had studied how to avoid all suspicion of being unduly\r\ncivil:\r\n\r\n    Harlow go to the yard at once take your tools with you.\r\n    Crass will tell you where you have to go.\r\n                                                           J.H.\r\n\r\nThey were just finishing their dinners when the boy brought this note;\r\nand after reading it aloud for the benefit of the others, Harlow\r\nremarked that it was worded in much the same way in which one would\r\nspeak to a dog.  The others said nothing; but after he was gone the\r\nother men--who all considered that it was ridiculous for the \'likes of\r\nus\' to expect or wish to be treated with common civility--laughed about\r\nit, and said that Harlow was beginning to think he was Somebody: they\r\nsupposed it was through readin\' all those books what Owen was always\r\nlendin\' \'im.  And then one of them got a piece of paper and wrote a\r\nnote to be given to Harlow at the first opportunity.  This note was\r\nproperly worded, written in a manner suitable for a gentleman like him,\r\nneatly folded and addressed:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr Harlow Esq.,\r\n      c/o Macaroni\'s Royal Cafe\r\n        till called for.\r\n\r\n    Mister Harlow,\r\n      Dear Sir: Wood you kinely oblige me bi cummin to the paint shop\r\n    as soon as you can make it convenient as there is a sealin\' to be\r\n    wite-woshed hoppin this is not trubbling you to much\r\n\r\n                                                  I remane\r\n                                                  Yours respeckfully\r\n                                                       Pontius Pilate.\r\n\r\nThis note was read out for the amusement of the company and afterwards\r\nstored away in the writer\'s pocket till such a time as an opportunity\r\nshould occur of giving it to Harlow.\r\n\r\nAs the writer of the note was on his way back to his room to resume\r\nwork he was accosted by a man who had gone into Harlow\'s room to\r\ncriticize it, and had succeeded in finding several faults which he\r\npointed out to the other, and of course they were both very much\r\ndisgusted with Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t think why the coddy keeps him on the job,\' said the first man.\r\n\'Between you and me, if I had charge of a job, and Misery sent Harlow\r\nthere--I\'d send \'im back to the shop.\'\r\n\r\n\'Same as you,\' agreed the other as he went back to tear into his own\r\nroom.  \'Same as you, old man: I shouldn\'t \'ave \'im neither.\'\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed from this that either of these two men were on\r\nexceptionally bad terms with Harlow; they were just as good friends\r\nwith him--to his face--as they were with each other--to each other\'s\r\nfaces--and it was just their way: that was all.\r\n\r\nIf it had been one or both of these two who had gone away instead of\r\nHarlow, just the same things would have been said about them by the\r\nothers who remained--it was merely their usual way of speaking about\r\neach other behind each other\'s backs.\r\n\r\nIt was always the same: if any one of them made a mistake or had an\r\naccident or got into any trouble he seldom or never got any sympathy\r\nfrom his fellow workmen.  On the contrary, most of them at such times\r\nseemed rather pleased than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere was a poor devil--a stranger in the town; he came from\r\nLondon--who got the sack for breaking some glass.  He had been sent to\r\n\'burn off\' some old paint of the woodwork of a window.  He was not very\r\nskilful in the use of the burning-off lamp, because on the firm when he\r\nhad been working in London it was a job that the ordinary hands were\r\nseldom or never called upon to do.  There were one or two men who did\r\nit all.  For that matter, not many of Rushton\'s men were very skilful\r\nat it either.  It was a job everybody tried to get out of, because\r\nnearly always the lamp went wrong and there was a row about the time\r\nthe work took.  So they worked this job on to the stranger.\r\n\r\nThis man had been out of work for a long time before he got a start at\r\nRushton\'s, and he was very anxious not to lose the job, because he had\r\na wife and family in London.  When the \'coddy\' told him to go and burn\r\noff this window he did not like to say that he was not used to the\r\nwork: he hoped to be able to do it.  But he was very nervous, and the\r\nend was that although he managed to do the burning off all right, just\r\nas he was finishing he accidentally allowed the flame of the lamp to\r\ncome into contact with a large pane of glass and broke it.\r\n\r\nThey sent to the shop for a new pane of glass, and the man stayed late\r\nthat night and put it in in his own time, thus bearing half the cost of\r\nrepairing it.\r\n\r\nThings were not very busy just then, and on the following Saturday two\r\nof the hands were \'stood off\'.  The stranger was one of them, and\r\nnearly everybody was very pleased.  At mealtimes the story of the\r\nbroken window was repeatedly told amid jeering laughter.  It really\r\nseemed as if a certain amount of indignation was felt that a\r\nstranger--especially such an inferior person as this chap who did not\r\nknow how to use a lamp--should have had the cheek to try to earn his\r\nliving at all!  One thing was very certain--they said, gleefully--he\r\nwould never get another job at Rushton\'s: that was one good thing.\r\n\r\nAnd yet they all knew that this accident might have happened to any one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nOnce a couple of men got the sack because a ceiling they distempered\r\nhad to be washed off and done again.  It was not really the men\'s fault\r\nat all: it was a ceiling that needed special treatment and they had not\r\nbeen allowed to do it properly.\r\n\r\nBut all the same, when they got the sack most of the others laughed and\r\nsneered and were glad.  Perhaps because they thought that the fact that\r\nthese two unfortunates had been disgraced, increased their own chances\r\nof being \'kept on\'.  And so it was with nearly everything. With a few\r\nexceptions, they had an immense amount of respect for Rushton and\r\nHunter, and very little respect or sympathy for each other.\r\n\r\nExactly the same lack of feeling for each other prevailed amongst the\r\nmembers of all the different trades.  Everybody seemed glad if anybody\r\ngot into trouble for any reason whatever.\r\n\r\nThere was a garden gate that had been made at the carpenter\'s shop: it\r\nwas not very well put together, and for the usual reason; the man had\r\nnot been allowed the time to do it properly.  After it was fixed, one\r\nof his shopmates wrote upon it with lead pencil in big letters: \'This\r\nis good work for a joiner.  Order one ton of putty.\'\r\n\r\nBut to hear them talking in the pub of a Saturday afternoon just after\r\npay-time one would think them the best friends and mates and the most\r\nindependent spirits in the world, fellows whom it would be very\r\ndangerous to trifle with, and who would stick up for each other through\r\nthick and thin.  All sorts of stories were related of the wonderful\r\nthings they had done and said; of jobs they had \'chucked up\', and\r\nmasters they had \'told off\': of pails of whitewash thrown over\r\noffending employers, and of horrible assaults and batteries committed\r\nupon the same.  But strange to say, for some reason or other, it seldom\r\nhappened that a third party ever witnessed any of these prodigies.  It\r\nseemed as if a chivalrous desire to spare the feelings of their victims\r\nhad always prevented them from doing or saying anything to them in the\r\npresence of witnesses.\r\n\r\nWhen he had drunk a few pints, Crass was a very good hand at these\r\nstories.  Here is one that he told in the bar of the Cricketers on the\r\nSaturday afternoon of the same week that Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk\r\ngot the sack.  The Cricketers was only a few minutes walk from the shop\r\nand at pay-time a number of the men used to go in there to take a drink\r\nbefore going home.\r\n\r\n\'Last Thursday night about five o\'clock, \'Unter comes inter the\r\npaint-shop an\' ses to me, "I wants a pail o\' wash made up tonight,\r\nCrass," \'e ses, "ready for fust thing in the mornin\'," \'e ses.  "Oh," I\r\nses, lookin\' \'im straight in the bloody eye, "Oh, yer do, do\r\nyer?"--just like that.  "Yes," \'e ses.  "Well, you can bloody well make\r\nit yerself!" I ses, "\'cos I ain\'t agoin\' to," I ses--just like that.\r\n"Wot the \'ell do yer mean," I ses, "by comin\' \'ere at this time o\'\r\nnight with a order like that?" I ses.  You\'d a larfed,\' continued\r\nCrass, as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand after taking\r\nanother drink out of his glass, and looking round to note the effect of\r\nthe story, \'you\'d a larfed if you\'d bin there.  \'E was fairly\r\nflabbergasted!  And wen I said that to \'im I see \'is jaw drop!  An\'\r\nthen \'e started apoligizing and said as \'e \'adn\'t meant no offence, but\r\nI told \'im bloody straight not to come no more of it.  "You bring the\r\nhorder at a reasonable time," I ses--just like that--"and I\'ll attend\r\nto it," I ses, "but not otherwise," I ses.\'\r\n\r\nAs he concluded this story, Crass drained his glass and gazed round\r\nupon the audience, who were full of admiration.  They looked at each\r\nother and at Crass and nodded their heads approvingly.  Yes,\r\nundoubtedly, that was the proper way to deal with such bounders as\r\nNimrod; take up a strong attitude, an\' let \'em see as you\'ll stand no\r\nnonsense!\r\n\r\n\'Yer don\'t blame me, do yer?\' continued Crass.  \'Why should we put up\r\nwith a lot of old buck from the likes of \'im!  We\'re not a lot of\r\nbloody Chinamen, are we?\'\r\n\r\nSo far from blaming him, they all assured him that they would have\r\nacted in precisely the same way under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n\'For my part, I\'m a bloke like this,\' said a tall man with a very loud\r\nvoice--a chap who nearly fell down dead every time Rushton or Misery\r\nlooked at him.  \'I\'m a bloke like this \'ere: I never stands no cheek\r\nfrom no gaffers!  If a guv\'nor ses two bloody words to me, I downs me\r\ntools and I ses to \'im, "Wot!  Don\'t I suit yer, guv\'ner?  Ain\'t I done\r\nenuff for yer?  Werry good!  Gimmie me bleedin\' a\'pence."\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite right too,\' said everybody.  That was the way to serve \'em.  If\r\nonly everyone would do the same as the tall man--who had just paid for\r\nanother round of drinks--things would be a lot more comfortable than\r\nthey was.\r\n\r\n\'Last summer I was workin\' for ole Buncer,\' said a little man with a\r\ncutaway coat several sizes too large for him.  \'I was workin\' for ole\r\nBuncer, over at Windley, an\' you all knows as \'e don\'t arf lower it.\r\nWell, one day, when I knowed \'e was on the drunk, I \'ad to first coat a\r\nroom out--white; so thinks I to meself, "If I buck up I shall be able\r\nto get this lot done by about four o\'clock, an\' then I can clear orf\r\n\'ome.  \'Cos I reckoned as \'e\'d be about flattened out by that time, an\'\r\nyou know \'e ain\'t got no foreman.  So I tears into it an\' gets this\r\n\'ere room done about a quarter past four, an\' I\'d just got me things\r\nput away for the night w\'en \'oo should come fallin\' up the bloody\r\nstairs but ole Buncer, drunk as a howl!  An\' no sooner \'e gits inter\r\nthe room than \'e starts yappin\' an\' rampin\'."  "Is this \'ere hall\r\nyou\'ve done?" \'e shouts out.  "Wotcher bin up to hall day?" \'e ses, an\'\r\n\'e keeps on shouting\' an\' swearin\' till at last I couldn\'t stand it no\r\nlonger, \'cos you can guess I wasn\'t in a very good temper with \'im\r\ncomin\' along jist then w\'en I thought I was goin\' to get orf a bit\r\nearly--so w\'en \'e kept on shoutin\' I never made no answer to \'im, but\r\nups with me fist an\' I gives \'im a slosh in the dial an\' stopped \'is\r\nclock!  Then I chucked the pot o\' w\'ite paint hover \'im, an\' kicked \'im\r\ndown the bloody stairs.\'\r\n\r\n\'Serve \'im blooming well right, too,\' said Crass as he took a fresh\r\nglass of beer from one of the others, who had just \'stood\' another\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\'What did the b--r say to that?\' inquired the tall man.\r\n\r\n\'Not a bloody word!\' replied the little man, \'\'E picked \'isself up, and\r\ncalled a keb wot was passin\' an\' got inter it an\' went \'ome; an\' I\r\nnever seen no more of \'im until about \'arf-past eleven the next day,\r\nw\'en I was second-coatin\' the room, an\' \'e comes up with a noo suit o\'\r\nclothes on, an\' arsts me if I\'d like to come hover to the pub an\' \'ave\r\na drink?  So we goes hover, an\' \'e calls for a w\'iskey an\' soda for\r\nisself an\' arsts me wot I\'d \'ave, so I \'ad the same.  An\' w\'ile we was\r\ngettin\' it down us, \'e ses to me, "Ah, Garge," \'e ses.  "You losed your\r\ntemper with me yesterday,"\' \'e ses.\'\r\n\r\n\'There you are, you see!\' said the tall man.  \'There\'s an example for\r\nyer!  If you \'adn\'t served \'im as you did you\'d most likely \'ave \'ad to\r\nput up with a lot more ole buck.\'\r\n\r\nThey all agreed that the little man had done quite right: they all said\r\nthat they didn\' blame him in the least: they would all have done the\r\nsame: in fact, this was the way they all conducted themselves whenever\r\noccasion demanded it.  To hear them talk, one would imagine that such\r\naffairs as the recent exploit of Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk were\r\nconstantly taking place, instead of only occurring about once in a blue\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nCrass stood the final round of drinks, and as he evidently thought that\r\ncircumstance deserved to be signalized in some special manner, he\r\nproposed the following toast, which was drunk with enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n        \'To hell with the man,\r\n        May he never grow fat,\r\n        What carries two faces,\r\n        Under one \'at.\'\r\n\r\nRushton & Co. did a lot of work that summer.  They did not have many\r\nbig jobs, but there were a lot of little ones, and the boy Bert was\r\nkept busy running from one to the other.  He spent most of his time\r\ndragging a handcart with loads of paint, or planks and steps, and\r\nseldom went out to work with the men, for when he was not taking things\r\nout to the various places where the philanthropists were working, he\r\nwas in the paintshop at the yard, scraping out dirty paint-pots or\r\nhelping Crass to mix up colours.  Although scarcely anyone seemed to\r\nnotice it, the boy presented a truly pitiable spectacle.  He was very\r\npale and thin.  Dragging the handcart did not help him to put on flesh,\r\nfor the weather was very hot and the work made him sweat.\r\n\r\nHis home was right away on the other side of Windley.  It took him more\r\nthan three-quarters of an hour to walk to the shop, and as he had to be\r\nat work at six, that meant that he had to leave home at a few minutes\r\npast five every morning, so that he always got up about half past four.\r\n\r\nHe was wearing a man\'s coat--or rather jacket--which gave the upper\r\npart of his body a bulky appearance.  The trousers were part of a suit\r\nof his own, and were somewhat narrowly cut, as is the rule with boys\'\r\ncheap ready-made trousers.  These thin legs appearing under the big\r\njacket gave him a rather grotesque appearance, which was heightened by\r\nthe fact that all his clothes, cap, coat, waistcoat, trousers and\r\nboots, were smothered with paint and distemper of various colours, and\r\nthere were generally a few streaks of paint of some sort or other upon\r\nhis face, and of course his hands--especially round the\r\nfingernails--were grimed with it.  But the worst of all were the\r\ndreadful hobnailed boots: the leather of the uppers of these was an\r\neighth of an inch thick, and very stiff.  Across the fore part of the\r\nboot this hard leather had warped into ridges and valleys, which chafed\r\nhis feet, and made them bleed.  The soles were five-eighths of an inch\r\nthick, covered with hobnails, and were as hard and inflexible and\r\nalmost as heavy as iron.  These boots hurt his feet dreadfully and made\r\nhim feel very tired and miserable, for he had such a lot of walking to\r\ndo. He used to be jolly glad when dinner-time came, for then he used to\r\nget out of sight in some quiet spot and lie down for the whole hour.\r\nHis favourite dining-place was up in the loft over the carpenter\'s\r\nshop, where they stored the mouldings and architraves.  No one ever\r\ncame there at that hour, and after he had eaten his dinner he used to\r\nlie down and think and rest.\r\n\r\nHe nearly always had an hour for dinner, but he did not always have it\r\nat the same time: sometimes he had it at twelve o\'clock and sometimes\r\nnot till two.  It all depended upon what stuff had to be taken to the\r\njob.\r\n\r\nOften it happened that some men at a distant job required some material\r\nto use immediately after dinner, and perhaps Crass was not able to get\r\nit ready till twelve o\'clock, so that it was not possible to take it\r\nbefore dinner-time, and if Bert left it till after dinner the men would\r\nbe wasting their time waiting for it: so in such cases he took it there\r\nfirst and had his dinner when he came back.\r\n\r\nSometimes he got back about half past twelve, and it was necessary for\r\nhim to take out another lot of material at one o\'clock.\r\n\r\nIn such a case he \'charged\' half an hour overtime on his time sheet--he\r\nused to get twopence an hour for overtime.\r\n\r\nSometimes Crass sent him with a handcart to one job to get a pair of\r\nsteps or tressels, or a plank, or some material or other, and take them\r\nto another job, and on these occasions it was often very late before he\r\nwas able to take his meals.  Instead of getting his breakfast at eight,\r\nit was often nearly nine before he got back to the shop, and frequently\r\nhe had to go without dinner until half past one or two.\r\n\r\nSometimes he could scarcely manage to carry the pots of paint to the\r\njobs; his feet were so hot and sore.  When he had to push the cart it\r\nwas worse still, and often when knocking-off time came he felt so tired\r\nthat he could scarcely manage to walk home.\r\n\r\nBut the weather was not always hot or fine: sometimes it was quite\r\ncold, almost like winter, and there was a lot of rain that summer.  At\r\nsuch times the boy frequently got wet through several times a day as he\r\nwent from one job to another, and he had to work all the time in his\r\nwet clothes and boots, which were usually old and out of repair and let\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst jobs that he had to do was when a new stock of white\r\nlead came in.  This stuff came in wooden barrels containing two\r\nhundredweight, and he used to have to dig it out of these barrels with\r\na trowel, and put it into a metal tank, where it was kept covered with\r\nwater, and the empty barrels were returned to the makers.\r\n\r\nWhen he was doing this work he usually managed to get himself smeared\r\nall over with the white lead, and this circumstance, and the fact that\r\nhe was always handling paint or some poisonous material or other was\r\ndoubtless the cause of the terrible pains he often had in his\r\nstomach--pains that sometimes caused him to throw himself down and roll\r\non the ground in agony.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Crass sent him with a handcart to a job that Easton,\r\nPhilpot, Harlow and Owen were just finishing.  He got there about half\r\npast four and helped the men to load up the things, and afterwards\r\nwalked alongside the cart with them back to the shop.\r\n\r\nOn the way they all noticed and remarked to each other that the boy\r\nlooked tired and pale and that he seemed to limp: but he did not say\r\nanything, although he guessed that they were talking about him.  They\r\narrived at the shop a little before knocking-off time--about ten\r\nminutes past five.  Bert helped them to unload, and afterwards, while\r\nthey were putting their things away and \'charging up\' the unused\r\nmaterials they had brought back, he pushed the cart over to the shed\r\nwhere it was kept, on the other side of the yard.  He did not return to\r\nthe shop at once and a few minutes later when Harlow came out into the\r\nyard to get a bucket of water to wash their hands with, he saw the boy\r\nleaning on the side of the cart, crying, and holding one foot off the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHarlow asked him what was the matter, and while he was speaking to him\r\nthe others came out to see what was up: the boy said he had rheumatism\r\nor growing pains or something in his leg, \'just here near the knee\'.\r\nBut he didn\'t say much, he just cried miserably, and turned his head\r\nslowly from side to side, avoiding the looks of the men because he felt\r\nashamed that they should see him cry.\r\n\r\nWhen they saw how ill and miserable he looked, the men all put their\r\nhands in their pockets to get some coppers to give to him so that he\r\ncould ride home on the tram.  They gave him fivepence altogether, more\r\nthan enough to ride all the way; and Crass told him to go at\r\nonce--there was no need to wait till half past; but before he went\r\nPhilpot got a small glass bottle out of his tool bag and filled it with\r\noil and turps--two of turps and one of oil--which he gave to Bert to\r\nrub into his leg before going to bed: The turps--he explained--was to\r\ncure the pain and the oil was to prevent it from hurting the skin.  He\r\nwas to get his mother to rub it in for him if he were too tired to do\r\nit himself.  Bert promised to observe these directions, and, drying his\r\ntears, took his dinner basket and limped off to catch the tram.\r\n\r\nIt was a few days after this that Hunter met with an accident.  He was\r\ntearing off on his bicycle to one of the jobs about five minutes to\r\ntwelve to see if he could catch anyone leaving off for dinner before\r\nthe proper time, and while going down a rather steep hill the\r\nfront brake broke--the rubbers of the rear one were worn out and failed\r\nto act--so Misery to save himself from being smashed against the\r\nrailings of the houses at the bottom of the hill, threw himself off the\r\nmachine, with the result that his head and face and hands were terribly\r\ncut and bruised.  He was so badly knocked about that he had to remain\r\nat home for nearly three weeks, much to the delight of the men and the\r\nannoyance--one might even say the indignation--of Mr Rushton, who did\r\nnot know enough about the work to make out estimates without\r\nassistance.  There were several large jobs to be tendered for at the\r\nsame time, so Rushton sent the specifications round to Hunter\'s house\r\nfor him to figure out the prices, and nearly all the time that Misery\r\nwas at home he was sitting up in bed, swathed in bandages, trying to\r\ncalculate the probable cost of these jobs.  Rushton did not come to see\r\nhim, but he sent Bert nearly every day, either with some\r\nspecifications, or some accounts, or something of that sort, or with a\r\nnote inquiring when Hunter thought he would be able to return to work.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of rumours became prevalent amongst the men concerning\r\nHunter\'s condition.  He had \'broken his spiral column\', he had\r\n\'conjunction of the brain\', or he had injured his \'innards\' and would\r\nprobably never be able to \'do no more slave-drivin\'\'.  Crass--who had\r\nhelped Mr Rushton to \'price up\' several small jobs--began to think it\r\nmight not be altogether a bad thing for himself if something were to\r\nhappen to Hunter, and he began to put on side and to assume airs of\r\nauthority.  He got one of the light-weights to assist him in his work\r\nof colourman and made him do all the hard work, while he spent part of\r\nhis own time visiting the different jobs to see how the work progressed.\r\n\r\nCrass\'s appearance did him justice.  He was wearing a pair of sporting\r\ntrousers the pattern of which consisted of large black and white\r\nsquares.  The previous owner of these trousers was taller and slighter\r\nthan Crass, so although the legs were about a couple of inches too\r\nlong, they fitted him rather tightly, so much so that it was fortunate\r\nthat he had his present job of colourman, for if he had had to do any\r\nclimbing up and down ladders or steps, the trousers would have burst.\r\nHis jacket was also two or three sizes too small, and the sleeves were\r\nso short that the cuffs of his flanelette shirt were visible.  This\r\ncoat was made of serge, and its colour had presumably once been blue,\r\nbut it was now a sort of heliotrope and violet: the greater part being\r\nof the former tint, and the parts under the sleeves of the latter. This\r\njacket fitted very tightly across the shoulders and back and being much\r\ntoo short left his tightly clad posteriors exposed to view.\r\n\r\nHe however seemed quite unconscious of anything peculiar in his\r\nappearance and was so bumptious and offensive that most of the men were\r\nalmost glad when Nimrod came back.  They said that if Crass ever got\r\nthe job he would be a dam\' sight worse than Hunter.  As for the latter,\r\nfor a little while after his return to work it was said that his\r\nillness had improved his character: he had had time to think things\r\nover; and in short, he was ever so much better than before: but it was\r\nnot long before this story began to be told the other way round.  He\r\nwas worse than ever! and a thing that happened about a fortnight after\r\nhis return caused more ill feeling and resentment against him and\r\nRushton than had ever existed previously.  What led up to it was\r\nsomething that was done by Bundy\'s mate, Ted Dawson.\r\n\r\nThis poor wretch was scarcely ever seen without a load of some sort or\r\nother: carrying a sack of cement or plaster, a heavy ladder, a big\r\nbucket of mortar, or dragging a load of scaffolding on a cart.  He must\r\nhave been nearly as strong as a horse, because after working in this\r\nmanner for Rushton & Co. from six in the morning till half past five at\r\nnight, he usually went to work in his garden for two or three hours\r\nafter tea, and frequently went there for an hour or so in the morning\r\nbefore going to work.  The poor devil needed the produce of his garden\r\nto supplement his wages, for he had a wife and three children to\r\nprovide for and he earned only--or rather, to be correct, he was paid\r\nonly--fourpence an hour.\r\n\r\nThere was an old house to which they were making some alterations and\r\nrepairs, and there was a lot of old wood taken out of it: old, decayed\r\nfloorboards and stuff of that kind, wood that was of no use whatever\r\nexcept to burn.\r\n\r\nBundy and his mate were working there, and one night, Misery came a few\r\nminutes before half past five and caught Dawson in the act of tying up\r\na small bundle of this wood.  When Hunter asked him what he was going\r\nto do with it he made no attempt at prevarication or concealment: he\r\nsaid he was going to take it home for fire-wood, because it was of no\r\nother use.  Misery kicked up a devil of a row and ordered him to leave\r\nthe wood where it was: it had to be taken to the yard, and it was\r\nnothing to do with Dawson or anyone else whether it was any use or not!\r\nIf he caught anyone taking wood away he would sack them on the spot.\r\nHunter shouted very loud so that all the others might hear, and as they\r\nwere all listening attentively in the next room, where they were taking\r\ntheir aprons off preparatory to going home, they got the full benefit\r\nof his remarks.\r\n\r\nThe following Saturday when the hands went to the office for their\r\nmoney they were each presented with a printed card bearing the\r\nfollowing legend:\r\n\r\n    Under no circumstances is any article or material, however\r\n    trifling, to be taken away by workmen for their private use,\r\n    whether waste material or not, from any workshop or place where\r\n    work is being done.  Foremen are hereby instructed to see that\r\n    this order is obeyed and to report any such act coming to their\r\n    knowledge.  Any man breaking this rule will be either dismissed\r\n    without notice or given into custody.\r\n                                                         Rushton & Co.\r\n\r\nMost of the men took these cards with the envelopes containing their\r\nwages and walked away without making any comment--in fact, most of them\r\nwere some distance away before they realized exactly what the card was\r\nabout.  Two or three of them stood a few steps away from the pay window\r\nin full view of Rushton and Misery and ostentatiously tore the thing\r\ninto pieces and threw them into the street.  One man remained at the\r\npay window while he read the card--and then flung it with an obscene\r\ncurse into Rushton\'s face, and demanded his back day, which they gave\r\nhim without any remark or delay, the other men who were not yet paid\r\nhaving to wait while he made out his time-sheet for that morning.\r\n\r\nThe story of this card spread all over the place in a very short time.\r\nIt became the talk of every shop in the town.  Whenever any of\r\nRushton\'s men encountered the employees of another firm, the latter\r\nused to shout after them--\'However trifling!\'--or \'Look out, chaps!\r\n\'Ere comes some of Rushton\'s pickpockets.\'\r\n\r\nAmongst Rushton\'s men themselves it became a standing joke or form of\r\ngreeting to say when one met another--\'Remember!  However trifling!\'\r\n\r\nIf one of their number was seen going home with an unusual amount of\r\npaint or whitewash on his hands or clothes, the others would threaten\r\nto report him for stealing the material.  They used to say that however\r\ntrifling the quantity, it was against orders to take it away.\r\n\r\nHarlow drew up a list of rules which he said Mr Rushton had instructed\r\nhim to communicate to the men.  One of these rules provided that\r\neverybody was to be weighed upon arrival at the job in the morning and\r\nagain at leaving-off time: any man found to have increased in weight\r\nwas to be discharged.\r\n\r\nThere was also much cursing and covert resentment about it; the men\r\nused to say that such a thing as that looked well coming from the likes\r\nof Rushton and Hunter, and they used to remind each other of the affair\r\nof the marble-topped console table, the barometer, the venetian blinds\r\nand all the other robberies.\r\n\r\nNone of them ever said anything to either Misery or Rushton about the\r\ncards, but one morning when the latter was reading his letters at the\r\nbreakfast table, on opening one of them he found that it contained one\r\nof the notices, smeared with human excrement.  He did not eat any more\r\nbreakfast that morning.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be much wondered at that none of them had the courage to\r\nopenly resent the conditions under which they had to work, for although\r\nit was summer, there were many men out of employment, and it was much\r\neasier to get the sack than it was to get another job.\r\n\r\nNone of the men were ever caught stealing anything, however trifling,\r\nbut all the same during the course of the summer five or six of them\r\nwere captured by the police and sent to jail--for not being able to pay\r\ntheir poor rates.\r\n\r\nAll through the summer Owen continued to make himself objectionable and\r\nto incur the ridicule of his fellow workmen by talking about the causes\r\nof poverty and of ways to abolish it.\r\n\r\nMost of the men kept two shillings or half a crown of their wages back\r\nfrom their wives for pocket money, which they spent on beer and\r\ntobacco.  There were a very few who spent a little more than this, and\r\nthere were a still smaller number who spent so much in this way that\r\ntheir families had to suffer in consequence.\r\n\r\nMost of those who kept back half a crown or three shillings from their\r\nwives did so on the understanding that they were to buy their clothing\r\nout of it.  Some of them had to pay a shilling a week to a tallyman or\r\ncredit clothier.  These were the ones who indulged in shoddy new\r\nsuits--at long intervals.  Others bought--or got their wives to buy for\r\nthem--their clothes at second-hand shops, \'paying off\' about a shilling\r\nor so a week and not receiving the things till they were paid for.\r\n\r\nThere were a very large proportion of them who did not spend even a\r\nshilling a week for drink: and there were numerous others who, while\r\nnot being formally total abstainers, yet often went for weeks together\r\nwithout either entering a public house or tasting intoxicating drink in\r\nany form.\r\n\r\nThen there were others who, instead of drinking tea or coffee or cocoa\r\nwith their dinners or suppers, drank beer.  This did not cost more than\r\nthe teetotal drinks, but all the same there are some persons who say\r\nthat those who swell the \'Nation\'s Drink Bill\' by drinking beer with\r\ntheir dinners or suppers are a kind of criminal, and that they ought to\r\nbe compelled to drink something else: that is, if they are working\r\npeople.  As for the idle classes, they of course are to be allowed to\r\ncontinue to make merry, \'drinking whisky, wine and sherry\', to say\r\nnothing of having their beer in by the barrel and the dozen--or forty\r\ndozen--bottles.  But of course that\'s a different matter, because these\r\npeople make so much money out of the labour of the working classes that\r\nthey can afford to indulge in this way without depriving their children\r\nof the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nThere is no more cowardly, dastardly slander than is contained in the\r\nassertion that the majority or any considerable proportion of working\r\nmen neglect their families through drink.  It is a condemned lie. There\r\nare some who do, but they are not even a large minority.  They are few\r\nand far between, and are regarded with contempt by their fellow workmen.\r\n\r\nIt will be said that their families had to suffer for want of even the\r\nlittle that most of them spent in that way: but the persons that use\r\nthis argument should carry it to its logical conclusion.  Tea is an\r\nunnecessary and harmful drink; it has been condemned by medical men so\r\noften that to enumerate its evil qualities here would be waste of time.\r\nThe same can be said of nearly all the cheap temperance drinks; they\r\nare unnecessary and harmful and cost money, and, like beer, are drunk\r\nonly for pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhat right has anyone to say to working men that when their work is\r\ndone they should not find pleasure in drinking a glass or two of beer\r\ntogether in a tavern or anywhere else?  Let those who would presume to\r\ncondemn them carry their argument to its logical conclusion and condemn\r\npleasure of every kind.  Let them persuade the working classes to lead\r\nstill simpler lives; to drink water instead of such unwholesome things\r\nas tea, coffee, beer, lemonade and all the other harmful and\r\nunnecessary stuff.  They would then be able to live ever so much more\r\ncheaply, and as wages are always and everywhere regulated by the cost\r\nof living, they would be able to work for lower pay.\r\n\r\nThese people are fond of quoting the figures of the \'Nation\'s Drink\r\nBill,\' as if all this money were spent by the working classes!  But if\r\nthe amount of money spent in drink by the \'aristocracy\', the clergy and\r\nthe middle classes were deducted from the \'Nation\'s Drink Bill\', it\r\nwould be seen that the amount spent per head by the working classes is\r\nnot so alarming after all; and would probably not be much larger than\r\nthe amount spent on drink by those who consume tea and coffee and all\r\nthe other unwholesome and unnecessary \'temperance\' drinks.\r\n\r\nThe fact that some of Rushton\'s men spent about two shillings a week on\r\ndrink while they were in employment was not the cause of their poverty.\r\nIf they had never spent a farthing for drink, and if their wretched\r\nwages had been increased fifty percent, they would still have been in a\r\ncondition of the most abject and miserable poverty, for nearly all the\r\nbenefits and privileges of civilization, nearly everything that makes\r\nlife worth living, would still have been beyond their reach.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable, so long as men have to live and work under such\r\nheartbreaking, uninteresting conditions as at present that a certain\r\nproportion of them will seek forgetfulness and momentary happiness in\r\nthe tavern, and the only remedy for this evil is to remove the cause;\r\nand while that is in process, there is something else that can be done\r\nand that is, instead of allowing filthy drinking dens, presided over by\r\npersons whose interest it is to encourage men to drink more bad beer\r\nthan is good for them or than they can afford,--to have civilized\r\ninstitutions run by the State or the municipalities for use and not\r\nmerely for profit.  Decent pleasure houses, where no drunkenness or\r\nfilthiness would be tolerated--where one could buy real beer or coffee\r\nor tea or any other refreshments; where men could repair when their\r\nday\'s work was over and spend an hour or two in rational intercourse\r\nwith their fellows or listen to music and singing.  Taverns to which\r\nthey could take their wives and children without fear of defilement,\r\nfor a place that is not fit for the presence of a woman or a child is\r\nnot fit to exist at all.\r\n\r\nOwen, being a teetotaller, did not spend any of his money on drink; but\r\nhe spent a lot on what he called \'The Cause\'.  Every week he bought\r\nsome penny or twopenny pamphlets or some leaflets about Socialism,\r\nwhich he lent or gave to his mates; and in this way and by means of\r\nmuch talk he succeeded in converting a few to his party. Philpot,\r\nHarlow and a few others used to listen with interest, and some of them\r\neven paid for the pamphlets they obtained from Owen, and after reading\r\nthem themselves, passed them on to others, and also occasionally \'got\r\nup\' arguments on their own accounts.  Others were simply indifferent,\r\nor treated the subject as a kind of joke, ridiculing the suggestion\r\nthat it was possible to abolish poverty. They repeated that there had\r\n\'always been rich and poor in the world and there always would be, so\r\nthere was an end of it\'.  But the majority were bitterly hostile; not\r\nto Owen, but to Socialism.  For the man himself most of them had a\r\ncertain amount of liking, especially the ordinary hands because it was\r\nknown that he was not a \'master\'s man\' and that he had declined to\r\n\'take charge\' of jobs which Misery had offered to him.  But to\r\nSocialism they were savagely and malignantly opposed.  Some of those\r\nwho had shown some symptoms of Socialism during the past winter when\r\nthey were starving had now quite recovered and were stout defenders of\r\nthe Present System.\r\n\r\nBarrington was still working for the firm and continued to maintain his\r\nmanner of reserve, seldom speaking unless addressed but all the same,\r\nfor several reasons, it began to be rumoured that he shared Owen\'s\r\nviews.  He always paid for the pamphlets that Owen gave him, and on one\r\noccasion, when Owen bought a thousand leaflets to give away, Barrington\r\ncontributed a shilling towards the half-crown that Owen paid for them.\r\nBut he never took any part in the arguments that sometimes raged during\r\nthe dinner-hour or at breakfast-time.\r\n\r\nIt was a good thing for Owen that he had his enthusiasm for \'the cause\'\r\nto occupy his mind.  Socialism was to him what drink was to some of the\r\nothers--the thing that enable them to forget and tolerate the\r\nconditions under which they were forced to exist.  Some of them were so\r\nmuddled with beer, and others so besotted with admiration of their\r\nLiberal and Tory masters, that they were oblivious of the misery of\r\ntheir own lives, and in a similar way, Owen was so much occupied in\r\ntrying to rouse them from their lethargy and so engrossed in trying to\r\nthink out new arguments to convince them of the possibility of bringing\r\nabout an improvement in their condition that he had no time to dwell\r\nupon his own poverty; the money that he spent on leaflets and pamphlets\r\nto give away might have been better spent on food and clothing for\r\nhimself, because most of those to whom he gave them were by no means\r\ngrateful; but he never thought of that; and after all, nearly everyone\r\nspends money on some hobby or other.  Some people deny themselves the\r\nnecessaries or comforts of life in order that they may be able to help\r\nto fatten a publican.  Others deny themselves in order to enable a lazy\r\nparson to live in idleness and luxury; and others spend much time and\r\nmoney that they really need for themselves in buying Socialist\r\nliterature to give away to people who don\'t want to know about\r\nSocialism.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday morning towards the end of July, a band of about twenty-five\r\nmen and women on bicycles invaded the town.  Two of them--who rode a\r\nfew yards in front of the others, had affixed to the handlebars of each\r\nof their machines a slender, upright standard from the top of one of\r\nwhich fluttered a small flag of crimson silk with \'International\r\nBrotherhood and Peace\' in gold letters.  The other standard was similar\r\nin size and colour, but with a different legend: \'One for all and All\r\nfor one.\'\r\n\r\nAs they rode along they gave leaflets to the people in the streets, and\r\nwhenever they came to a place where there were many people they\r\ndismounted and walked about, giving their leaflets to whoever would\r\naccept them.  They made several long halts during their progress along\r\nthe Grand Parade, where there was a considerable crowd, and then they\r\nrode over the hill to Windley, which they reached a little before\r\nopening time.  There were little crowds waiting outside the several\r\npublic houses and a number of people passing through the streets on\r\ntheir way home from Church and Chapel.  The strangers distributed\r\nleaflets to all those who would take them, and they went through a lot\r\nof the side streets, putting leaflets under the doors and in the\r\nletter-boxes.  When they had exhausted their stock they remounted and\r\nrode back the way they came.\r\n\r\nMeantime the news of their arrival had spread, and as they returned\r\nthrough the town they were greeted with jeers and booing.  Presently\r\nsomeone threw a stone, and as there happened to be plenty of stones\r\njust there several others followed suit and began running after the\r\nretreating cyclists, throwing stones, hooting and cursing.\r\n\r\nThe leaflet which had given rise to all this fury read as follows:\r\n\r\n                            WHAT IS SOCIALISM?\r\n\r\n    At present the workers, with hand and brain produce continually\r\n    food, clothing and all useful and beautiful things in great\r\n    abundance.\r\n\r\n    BUT THEY LABOUR IN VAIN--for they are mostly poor and often in\r\n    want.  They find it a hard struggle to live.  Their women and\r\n    children suffer, and their old age is branded with pauperism.\r\n\r\n    Socialism is a plan by which poverty will be abolished, and\r\n    everyone enabled to live in plenty and comfort, with leisure and\r\n    opportunity for ampler life.\r\n\r\n    If you wish to hear more of this plan, come to the field at the\r\n    Cross Roads on the hill at Windley, on Tuesday evening next at 8\r\n    P.M. and\r\n\r\n                      LOOK OUT FOR THE SOCIALIST VAN\r\n\r\nThe cyclists rode away amid showers of stones without sustaining much\r\ndamage.  One had his hand cut and another, who happened to look round,\r\nwas struck on the forehead, but these were the only casualties.\r\n\r\nOn the following Tuesday evening, long before the appointed time, there\r\nwas a large crowd assembled at the cross roads or the hill at Windley,\r\nwaiting for the appearance of the van, and they were evidently prepared\r\nto give the Socialists a warm reception.  There was only one policeman\r\nin uniform there but there were several in plain clothes amongst the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nCrass, Dick Wantley, the Semi-drunk, Sawkins, Bill Bates and several\r\nother frequenters of the Cricketers were amongst the crowd, and there\r\nwere also a sprinkling of tradespeople, including the Old Dear and Mr\r\nSmallman, the grocer, and a few ladies and gentlemen--wealthy\r\nvisitors--but the bulk of the crowd were working men, labourers,\r\nmechanics and boys.\r\n\r\nAs it was quite evident that the crowd meant mischief--many of them had\r\ntheir pockets filled with stones and were armed with sticks--several of\r\nthe Socialists were in favour of going to meet the van to endeavour to\r\npersuade those in charge from coming, and with that object they\r\nwithdrew from the crowd, which was already regarding them with menacing\r\nlooks, and went down the road in the direction from which the van was\r\nexpected to come.  They had not gone very far, however, before the\r\npeople, divining what they were going to do, began to follow them and\r\nwhile they were hesitating what course to pursue, the Socialist van,\r\nescorted by five or six men on bicycles, appeared round the corner at\r\nthe bottom of the hill.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the crowd saw it, they gave an exultant cheer, or, rather,\r\nyell, and began running down the hill to meet it, and in a few minutes\r\nit was surrounded by a howling mob.  The van was drawn by two horses;\r\nthere was a door and a small platform at the back and over this was a\r\nsign with white letters on a red ground: \'Socialism, the only hope of\r\nthe Workers.\'\r\n\r\nThe driver pulled up, and another man on the platform at the rear\r\nattempted to address the crowd, but his voice was inaudible in the din\r\nof howls, catcalls, hooting and obscene curses.  After about an hour of\r\nthis, as the crowd began pushing against the van and trying to overturn\r\nit, the terrified horses commenced to get restive and uncontrollable,\r\nand the man on the box attempted to drive up the hill. This seemed to\r\nstill further infuriate the horde of savages who surrounded the van.\r\nNumbers of them clutched the wheels and turned them the reverse way,\r\nscreaming that it must go back to where it came from; several of them\r\naccordingly seized the horses\' heads and, amid cheers, turned them\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe man on the platform was still trying to make himself heard, but\r\nwithout success.  The strangers who had come with the van and the\r\nlittle group of local Socialists, who had forced their way through the\r\ncrowd and gathered together close to the platform in front of the\r\nwould-be speaker, only increased the din by their shouts of appeal to\r\nthe crowd to \'give the man a fair chance\'.  This little bodyguard\r\nclosed round the van as it began to move slowly downhill, but they were\r\nnot sufficiently numerous to protect it from the crowd, which, not\r\nbeing satisfied with the rate at which the van was proceeding, began to\r\nshout to each other to \'Run it away!\' \'Take the brake off!\' and several\r\nsavage rushes were made with the intention of putting these suggestions\r\ninto execution.\r\n\r\nSome of the defenders were hampered with their bicycles, but they\r\nresisted as well as they were able, and succeeded in keeping the crowd\r\noff until the foot of the hill was reached, and then someone threw the\r\nfirst stone, which by a strange chance happened to strike one of the\r\ncyclists whose head was already bandaged--it was the same man who had\r\nbeen hit on the Sunday.  This stone was soon followed by others, and\r\nthe man on the platform was the next to be struck.  He got it right on\r\nthe mouth, and as he put up his handkerchief to staunch the blood\r\nanother struck him on the forehead just above the temple, and he\r\ndropped forward on his face on to the platform as if he had been shot.\r\n\r\nAs the speed of the vehicle increased, a regular hail of stones fell\r\nupon the roof and against the sides of the van and whizzed past the\r\nretreating cyclists, while the crowd followed close behind, cheering,\r\nshrieking out volleys of obscene curses, and howling like wolves.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll give the b--rs Socialism!\' shouted Crass, who was literally\r\nfoaming at the mouth.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll teach \'em to come \'ere trying to undermined our bloody\r\nmorality,\' howled Dick Wantley as he hurled a lump of granite that he\r\nhad torn up from the macadamized road at one of the cyclists.\r\n\r\nThey ran on after the van until it was out of range, and then they\r\nbethought themselves of the local Socialists; but they were nowhere to\r\nbe seen; they had prudently withdrawn as soon as the van had got fairly\r\nunder way, and the victory being complete, the upholders of the present\r\nsystem returned to the piece of waste ground on the top of the hill,\r\nwhere a gentleman in a silk hat and frockcoat stood up on a little\r\nhillock and made a speech.  He said nothing about the Distress\r\nCommittee or the Soup Kitchen or the children who went to school\r\nwithout proper clothes or food, and made no reference to what was to be\r\ndone next winter, when nearly everybody would be out of work. These\r\nwere matters he and they were evidently not at all interested in.  But\r\nhe said a good deal about the Glorious Empire! and the Flag! and the\r\nRoyal Family.  The things he said were received with rapturous\r\napplause, and at the conclusion of his address, the crowd sang the\r\nNational Anthem with great enthusiasm and dispersed, congratulating\r\nthemselves that they had shown to the best of their ability what\r\nMugsborough thought of Socialism and the general opinion of the crowd\r\nwas that they would hear nothing more from the Socialist van.\r\n\r\nBut in this they were mistaken, for the very next Sunday evening a\r\ncrowd of Socialists suddenly materialized at the Cross Roads.  Some of\r\nthem had come by train, others had walked from different places and\r\nsome had cycled.\r\n\r\nA crowd gathered and the Socialists held a meeting, two speeches being\r\ndelivered before the crowd recovered from their surprise at the\r\ntemerity of these other Britishers who apparently had not sense enough\r\nto understand that they had been finally defeated and obliterated last\r\nTuesday evening: and when the cyclist with the bandaged head got up on\r\nthe hillock some of the crowd actually joined in the hand-clapping with\r\nwhich the Socialists greeted him.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his speech he informed them that the man who had come\r\nwith the van and who had been felled whilst attempting to speak from\r\nthe platform was now in hospital.  For some time it had been probable\r\nthat he would not recover, but he was now out of danger, and as soon as\r\nhe was well enough there was no doubt that he would come there again.\r\n\r\nUpon this Crass shouted out that if ever the Vanners did return, they\r\nwould finish what they had begun last Tuesday.  He would not get off so\r\neasy next time.  But when he said this, Crass--not being able to see\r\ninto the future--did not know what the reader will learn in due time,\r\nthat the man was to return to that place under different circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished their speech-making one of the strangers who was\r\nacting as chairman invited the audience to put questions, but as nobody\r\nwanted to ask any, he invited anyone who disagreed with what had been\r\nsaid to get up on the hillock and state his objections, so that the\r\naudience might have an opportunity of judging for themselves which side\r\nwas right; but this invitation was also neglected.  Then the chairman\r\nannounced that they were coming there again next Sunday at the same\r\ntime, when a comrade would speak on \'Unemployment and Poverty, the\r\nCause and the Remedy\', and then the strangers sang a song called\r\n\'England Arise\', the first verse being:\r\n\r\n        England Arise, the long, long night is over,\r\n        Faint in the east, behold the Dawn appear\r\n        Out of your evil dream of toil and sorrow\r\n        Arise, O England! for the day is here!\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the meeting several of the strangers had been\r\ngoing out amongst the crowd giving away leaflets, which many of the\r\npeople gloomily refused to accept, and selling penny pamphlets, of\r\nwhich they managed to dispose of about three dozen.\r\n\r\nBefore declaring the meeting closed, the chairman said that the speaker\r\nwho was coming next week resided in London: he was not a millionaire,\r\nbut a workman, the same as nearly all those who were there present.\r\nThey were not going to pay him anything for coming, but they intended\r\nto pay his railway fare.  Therefore next Sunday after the meeting there\r\nwould be a collection, and anything over the amount of the fare would\r\nbe used for the purchase of more leaflets such as those they were now\r\ngiving away.  He hoped that anyone who thought that any of the money\r\nwent into the pockets of those who held the meeting would come and\r\njoin: then they could have their share.\r\n\r\nThe meeting now terminated and the Socialists were suffered to depart\r\nin peace.  Some of them, however, lingered amongst the crowd after the\r\nmain body had departed, and for a long time after the meeting was over\r\nlittle groups remained on the field excitedly discussing the speeches\r\nor the leaflets.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday evening when the Socialists came they found the field\r\nat the Cross Roads in the possession of a furious, hostile mob, who\r\nrefused to allow them to speak, and finally they had to go away without\r\nhaving held a meeting.  They came again the next Sunday, and on this\r\noccasion they had a speaker with a very loud--literally a\r\nstentorian--voice, and he succeeded in delivering an address, but as\r\nonly those who were very close were able to hear him, and as they were\r\nall Socialists, it was not of much effect upon those for whom it was\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nThey came again the next Sunday and nearly every other Sunday during\r\nthe summer: sometimes they were permitted to hold their meeting in\r\ncomparative peace and at other times there was a row.  They made\r\nseveral converts, and many people declared themselves in favour of some\r\nof the things advocated, but they were never able to form a branch of\r\ntheir society there, because nearly all those who were convinced were\r\nafraid to publicly declare themselves lest they should lose their\r\nemployment or customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 44\r\n\r\nThe Beano\r\n\r\n\r\nNow and then a transient gleam of sunshine penetrated the gloom in\r\nwhich the lives of the philanthropists were passed.  The cheerless\r\nmonotony was sometimes enlivened with a little innocent merriment.\r\nEvery now and then there was a funeral which took Misery and Crass away\r\nfor the whole afternoon, and although they always tried to keep the\r\ndates secret, the men generally knew when they were gone.\r\n\r\nSometimes the people in whose houses they were working regaled them\r\nwith tea, bread and butter, cake or other light refreshments, and\r\noccasionally even with beer--very different stuff from the petrifying\r\nliquid they bought at the Cricketers for twopence a pint.  At other\r\nplaces, where the people of the house were not so generously disposed,\r\nthe servants made up for it, and entertained them in a similar manner\r\nwithout the knowledge of their masters and mistresses.  Even when the\r\nmistresses were too cunning to permit of this, they were seldom able to\r\nprevent the men from embracing the domestics, who for their part were\r\nquite often willing to be embraced; it was an agreeable episode that\r\nhelped to vary the monotony of their lives, and there was no harm done.\r\n\r\nIt was rather hard lines on the philanthropists sometimes when they\r\nhappened to be working in inhabited houses of the better sort.  They\r\nalways had to go in and out by the back way, generally through the\r\nkitchen, and the crackling and hissing of the poultry and the joints of\r\nmeat roasting in the ovens, and the odours of fruit pies and tarts, and\r\nplum puddings and sage and onions, were simply maddening.  In the\r\nback-yards of these houses there were usually huge stacks of empty\r\nbeer, stout and wine bottles, and others that had contained whisky,\r\nbrandy or champagne.\r\n\r\nThe smells of the delicious viands that were being prepared in the\r\nkitchen often penetrated into the dismantled rooms that the\r\nphilanthropists were renovating, sometimes just as they were eating\r\ntheir own wretched fare out of their dinner basket, and washing it down\r\nwith draughts of the cold tea or the petrifying liquid they sometimes\r\nbrought with them in bottles.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as has been said, the people of the house used to send up\r\nsome tea and bread and butter or cakes or other refreshments to the\r\nworkmen, but whenever Hunter got to know of it being done he used to\r\nspeak to the people about it and request that it be discontinued, as it\r\ncaused the men to waste their time.\r\n\r\nBut the event of the year was the Beano, which took place on the last\r\nSaturday in August, after they had been paying in for about four\r\nmonths.  The cost of the outing was to be five shillings a head, so\r\nthis was the amount each man had to pay in, but it was expected that\r\nthe total cost--the hire of the brakes and the cost of the\r\ndinner--would come out at a trifle less than the amount stated, and in\r\nthat case the surplus would be shared out after the dinner.  The amount\r\nof the share-out would be greater or less according to other\r\ncircumstances, for it generally happened that apart from the\r\nsubscriptions of the men, the Beano fund was swelled by charitable\r\ndonations from several quarters, as will be seen later on.\r\n\r\nWhen the eventful day arrived, the hands, instead of working till one,\r\nwere paid at twelve o\'clock and rushed off home to have a wash and\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThe brakes were to start from the \'Cricketers\' at one, but it was\r\narranged, for the convenience of those who lived at Windley, that they\r\nwere to be picked up at the Cross Roads at one-thirty.\r\n\r\nThere were four brakes altogether--three large ones for the men and one\r\nsmall one for the accommodation of Mr Rushton and a few of his personal\r\nfriends, Didlum, Grinder, Mr Toonarf, an architect and Mr Lettum, a\r\nhouse and estate Agent.  One of the drivers was accompanied by a friend\r\nwho carried a long coachman\'s horn.  This gentleman was not paid to\r\ncome, but, being out of work, he thought that the men would be sure to\r\nstand him a few drinks and that they would probably make a collection\r\nfor him in return for his services.\r\n\r\nMost of the chaps were smoking twopenny cigars, and had one or two\r\ndrinks with each other to try to cheer themselves up before they\r\nstarted, but all the same it was a melancholy procession that wended\r\nits way up the hill to Windley.  To judge from the mournful expression\r\non the long face of Misery, who sat on the box beside the driver of the\r\nfirst large brake, and the downcast appearance of the majority of the\r\nmen, one might have thought that it was a funeral rather than a\r\npleasure party, or that they were a contingent of lost souls being\r\nconducted to the banks of the Styx.  The man who from time to time\r\nsounded the coachman\'s horn might have passed as the angel sounding the\r\nlast trump, and the fumes of the cigars were typical of the smoke of\r\ntheir torment, which ascendeth up for ever and ever.\r\n\r\nA brief halt was made at the Cross Roads to pick up several of the men,\r\nincluding Philpot, Harlow, Easton, Ned Dawson, Sawkins, Bill Bates and\r\nthe Semi-drunk.  The two last-named were now working for Smeariton and\r\nLeavit, but as they had been paying in from the first, they had elected\r\nto go to the Beano rather than have their money back. The Semi-drunk\r\nand one or two other habitual boozers were very shabby and down at\r\nheel, but the majority of the men were decently dressed. Some had taken\r\ntheir Sunday clothes out of pawn especially for the occasion.  Others\r\nwere arrayed in new suits which they were going to pay for at the rate\r\nof a shilling a week.  Some had bought themselves second-hand suits,\r\none or two were wearing their working clothes brushed and cleaned up,\r\nand some were wearing Sunday clothes that had not been taken out of\r\npawn for the simple reason that the pawnbrokers would not take them in.\r\nThese garments were in what might be called a transition\r\nstage--old-fashioned and shiny with wear, but yet too good to take for\r\nworking in, even if their owners had been in a position to buy some\r\nothers to take their place for best.  Crass, Slyme and one or two of\r\nthe single men, however, were howling swells, sporting stand-up collars\r\nand bowler hats of the latest type, in contradistinction to some of the\r\nothers, who were wearing hats of antique patterns, and collars of\r\nvarious shapes with jagged edges.  Harlow had on an old straw hat that\r\nhis wife had cleaned up with oxalic acid, and Easton had carefully dyed\r\nthe faded binding of his black bowler with ink. Their boots were the\r\nworst part of their attire: without counting Rushton and his friends,\r\nthere were thirty-seven men altogether, including Nimrod, and there\r\nwere not half a dozen pairs of really good boots amongst the whole\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nWhen all were seated a fresh start was made.  The small brake, with\r\nRushton, Didlum, Grinder and two or three other members of the Band,\r\nled the way.  Next came the largest brake with Misery on the box.\r\nBeside the driver of the third brake was Payne, the foreman carpenter.\r\nCrass occupied a similar position of honour on the fourth brake, on the\r\nback step of which was perched the man with the coachman\'s horn.\r\n\r\nCrass--who had engaged the brakes--had arranged with the drivers that\r\nthe cortege should pass through the street where he and Easton lived,\r\nand as they went by Mrs Crass was standing at the door with the two\r\nyoung men lodgers, who waved their handkerchiefs and shouted greetings.\r\nA little further on Mrs Linden and Easton\'s wife were standing at the\r\ndoor to see them go by.  In fact, the notes of the coachman\'s horn\r\nalarmed most of the inhabitants, who crowded to their windows and doors\r\nto gaze upon the dismal procession as it passed.\r\n\r\nThe mean streets of Windley were soon left far behind and they found\r\nthemselves journeying along a sunlit, winding road, bordered with\r\nhedges of hawthorn, holly and briar, past rich, brown fields of\r\nstanding corn, shimmering with gleams of gold, past apple-orchards\r\nwhere bending boughs were heavily loaded with mellow fruits exhaling\r\nfragrant odours, through the cool shades of lofty avenues of venerable\r\noaks, whose overarched and interlacing branches formed a roof of green,\r\ngilt and illuminated with quivering spots and shafts of sunlight that\r\nfiltered through the trembling leaves; over old mossy stone bridges,\r\nspanning limpid streams that duplicated the blue sky and the fleecy\r\nclouds; and then again, stretching away to the horizon on every side\r\nover more fields, some rich with harvest, others filled with drowsing\r\ncattle or with flocks of timid sheep that scampered away at the sound\r\nof the passing carriages.  Several times they saw merry little\r\ncompanies of rabbits frisking gaily in and out of the hedges or in the\r\nfields beside the sheep and cattle.  At intervals, away in the\r\ndistance, nestling in the hollows or amid sheltering trees, groups of\r\nfarm buildings and stacks of hay; and further on, the square ivy-clad\r\ntower of an ancient church, or perhaps a solitary windmill with its\r\nrevolving sails alternately flashing and darkening in the rays of the\r\nsun.  Past thatched wayside cottages whose inhabitants came out to wave\r\ntheir hands in friendly greeting.  Past groups of sunburnt,\r\ngolden-haired children who climbed on fences and five-barred gates, and\r\nwaved their hats and cheered, or ran behind the brakes for the pennies\r\nthe men threw down to them.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the men in the brakes made half-hearted attempts at\r\nsinging, but it never came to much, because most of them were too\r\nhungry and miserable.  They had not had time to take any dinner and\r\nwould not have taken any even if they had the time, for they wished to\r\nreserve their appetites for the banquet at the Queen Elizabeth, which\r\nthey expected to reach about half past three.  However, they cheered up\r\na little after the first halt--at the Blue Lion, where most of them got\r\ndown and had a drink.  Some of them, including the Semi-drunk, Ned\r\nDawson, Bill Bates and Joe Philpot--had two or three drinks, and felt\r\nso much happier for them that, shortly after they started off again,\r\nsounds of melody were heard from the brake the three first named rode\r\nin--the one presided over by Crass--but it was not very successful, and\r\neven after the second halt--about five miles further on--at the\r\nWarrior\'s Head, they found it impossible to sing with any heartiness.\r\nFitful bursts of song arose from time to time from each of the brakes\r\nin turn, only to die mournfully away.  It is not easy to sing on an\r\nempty stomach even if one has got a little beer in it; and so it was\r\nwith most of them.  They were not in a mood to sing, or to properly\r\nappreciate the scenes through which they were passing.  They wanted\r\ntheir dinners, and that was the reason why this long ride, instead of\r\nbeing a pleasure, became after a while, a weary journey that seemed as\r\nif it were never coming to an end.\r\n\r\nThe next stop was at the Bird in Hand, a wayside public house that\r\nstood all by itself in a lonely hollow.  The landlord was a fat,\r\njolly-looking man, and there were several customers in the bar--men who\r\nlooked like farm-labourers, but there were no other houses to be seen\r\nanywhere.  This extraordinary circumstance exercised the minds of our\r\ntravellers and formed the principal topic of conversation until they\r\narrived at the Dew Drop Inn, about half an hour afterwards.  The first\r\nbrake, containing Rushton and his friends, passed on without stopping\r\nhere.  The occupants of the second brake, which was only a little way\r\nbehind the first, were divided in opinion whether to stop or go on.\r\nSome shouted out to the driver to pull up, others ordered him to\r\nproceed, and more were undecided which course to pursue--a state of\r\nmind that was not shared by the coachman, who, knowing that if they\r\nstopped somebody or other would be sure to stand him a drink, had no\r\ndifficulty whatever in coming to a decision, but drew rein at the inn,\r\nan example that was followed by both the other carriages as they drove\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIt was a very brief halt, not more than half the men getting down at\r\nall, and those who remained in the brakes grumbled so much at the delay\r\nthat the others drank their beer as quickly as possible and the journey\r\nwas resumed once more, almost in silence.  No attempts at singing, no\r\nnoisy laughter; they scarcely spoke to each other, but sat gloomily\r\ngazing out over the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nInstructions had been given to the drivers not to stop again till they\r\nreached the Queen Elizabeth, and they therefore drove past the World\r\nTurned Upside Down without stopping, much to the chagrin of the\r\nlandlord of that house, who stood at the door with a sickly smile upon\r\nhis face.  Some of those who knew him shouted out that they would give\r\nhim a call on their way back, and with this he had to be content.\r\n\r\nThey reached the long-desired Queen Elizabeth at twenty minutes to\r\nfour, and were immediately ushered into a large room where a round\r\ntable and two long ones were set for dinner--and they were set in a\r\nmanner worthy of the reputation of the house.\r\n\r\nThe cloths that covered the tables and the serviettes, arranged fanwise\r\nin the drinking glasses, were literally as white as snow, and about a\r\ndozen knives and forks and spoons were laid for each person. Down the\r\ncentre of the table glasses of delicious yellow custard and cut-glass\r\ndishes of glistening red and golden jelly alternated with vases of\r\nsweet-smelling flowers.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the dining-room was covered with oilcloth--red flowers on\r\na pale yellow ground; the pattern was worn off in places, but it was\r\nall very clean and shining.  Whether one looked at the walls with the\r\nold-fashioned varnished oak paper, or at the glossy piano standing\r\nacross the corner near the white-curtained window, at the shining oak\r\nchairs or through the open casement doors that led into the shady\r\ngarden beyond, the dominating impression one received was that\r\neverything was exquisitely clean.\r\n\r\nThe landlord announced that dinner would be served in ten minutes, and\r\nwhile they were waiting some of them indulged in a drink at the\r\nbar--just as an appetizer--whilst the others strolled in the garden or,\r\nby the landlord\'s invitation, looked over the house.  Amongst other\r\nplaces, they glanced into the kitchen, where the landlady was\r\nsuperintending the preparation of the feast, and in this place, with\r\nits whitewashed walls and red-tiled floor, as in every other part of\r\nthe house, the same absolute cleanliness reigned supreme.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a bit differint from the Royal Caff, where we got the sack, ain\'t\r\nit?\' remarked the Semi-drunk to Bill Bates as they made their way to\r\nthe dining-room in response to the announcement that dinner was ready.\r\n\r\n\'Not arf!\' replied Bill.\r\n\r\nRushton, with Didlum and Grinder and his other friends, sat at the\r\nround table near the piano.  Hunter took the head of the longer of the\r\nother two tables and Crass the foot, and on either side of Crass were\r\nBundy and Slyme, who had acted with him as the Committee who had\r\narranged the Beano.  Payne, the foreman carpenter, occupied the head of\r\nthe other table.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was all that could be desired; it was almost as good as the\r\nkind of dinner that is enjoyed every day by those persons who are too\r\nlazy to work but are cunning enough to make others work for them.\r\n\r\nThere was soup, several entrees, roast beef, boiled mutton, roast\r\nturkey, roast goose, ham, cabbage, peas, beans and sweets galore, plum\r\npudding, custard, jelly, fruit tarts, bread and cheese and as much beer\r\nor lemonade as they liked to pay for, the drinks being an extra; and\r\nafterwards the waiters brought in cups of coffee for those who desired\r\nit.  Everything was up to the knocker, and although they were somewhat\r\nbewildered by the multitude of knives and forks, they all, with one or\r\ntwo exceptions, rose to the occasion and enjoyed themselves famously.\r\nThe excellent decorum observed being marred only by one or two\r\nregrettable incidents.  The first of these occurred almost as soon as\r\nthey sat down, when Ned Dawson who, although a big strong fellow, was\r\nnot able to stand much beer, not being used to it, was taken ill and\r\nhad to be escorted from the room by his mate Bundy and another man.\r\nThey left him somewhere outside and he came back again about ten\r\nminutes afterwards, much better but looking rather pale, and took his\r\nseat with the others.\r\n\r\nThe turkeys, the roast beef and the boiled mutton, the peas and beans\r\nand the cabbage, disappeared with astonishing rapidity, which was not\r\nto be wondered at, for they were all very hungry from the long drive,\r\nand nearly everyone made a point of having at least one helping of\r\neverything there was to be had.  Some of them went in for two lots of\r\nsoup.  Then for the next course, boiled mutton and ham or turkey: then\r\nsome roast beef and goose.  Then a little more boiled mutton with a\r\nlittle roast beef.  Each of the three boys devoured several times his\r\nown weight of everything, to say nothing of numerous bottles of\r\nlemonade and champagne ginger beer.\r\n\r\nCrass frequently paused to mop the perspiration from his face and neck\r\nwith his serviette.  In fact everybody had a good time.  There was\r\nenough and to spare of everything to eat, the beer was of the best, and\r\nall the time, amid the rattle of the crockery and the knives and forks,\r\nthe proceedings were enlivened by many jests and flashes of wit that\r\ncontinuously kept the table in a roar.\r\n\r\n\'Chuck us over another dollop of that there white stuff, Bob,\' shouted\r\nthe Semi-drunk to Crass, indicating the blancmange.\r\n\r\nCrass reached out his hand and took hold of the dish containing the\r\n\'white stuff\', but instead of passing it to the Semi-drunk, he\r\nproceeded to demolish it himself, gobbling it up quickly directly from\r\nthe dish with a spoon.\r\n\r\n\'Why, you\'re eating it all yerself, yer bleeder,\' cried the Semi-drunk\r\nindignantly, as soon as he realized what was happening.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s all right, matey,\' replied Crass affably as he deposited the\r\nempty dish on the table.  \'It don\'t matter, there\'s plenty more where\r\nit come from.  Tell the landlord to bring in another lot.\'\r\n\r\nUpon being applied to, the landlord, who was assisted by his daughter,\r\ntwo other young women and two young men, brought in several more lots\r\nand so the Semi-drunk was appeased.\r\n\r\nAs for the plum-pudding--it was a fair knock-out; just like Christmas:\r\nbut as Ned Dawson and Bill Bates had drunk all the sauce before the\r\npudding was served, they all had to have their first helping without\r\nany.  However, as the landlord brought in another lot shortly\r\nafterwards, that didn\'t matter either.\r\n\r\nAs soon as dinner was over, Crass rose to make his statement as\r\nsecretary.  Thirty-seven men had paid five shillings each: that made\r\nnine pounds five shillings.  The committee had decided that the three\r\nboys--the painters\' boy, the carpenters\' boy and the front shop\r\nboy--should be allowed to come half-price: that made it nine pounds\r\ntwelve and six.  In addition to paying the ordinary five-shilling\r\nsubscription, Mr Rushton had given one pound ten towards the expenses.\r\n(Loud cheers.)  And several other gentlemen had also given something\r\ntowards it.  Mr Sweater, of the Cave, one pound.  (Applause.)  Mr\r\nGrinder, ten shillings in addition to the five-shilling subscription.\r\n(Applause.)  Mr Lettum, ten shillings, as well as the five-shilling\r\nsubscription.  (Applause.)  Mr Didlum, ten shillings in addition to the\r\nfive shillings.  (Cheers.)  Mr Toonarf, ten shillings as well as the\r\nfive-shilling subscription.  They had also written to some of the\r\nmanufacturers who supplied the firm with materials, and asked them to\r\ngive something: some of \'em had sent half a crown, some five shillings,\r\nsome hadn\'t answered at all, and two of \'em had written back to say\r\nthat as things is cut so fine nowadays, they didn\'t hardly get no\r\nprofit on their stuff, so they couldn\'t afford to give nothing; but out\r\nof all the firms they wrote to they managed to get thirty-two and\r\nsixpence altogether, making a grand total of seventeen pounds.\r\n\r\nAs for the expenses, the dinner was two and six a head, and there was\r\nforty-five of them there, so that came to five pounds twelve and six.\r\nThen there was the hire of the brakes, also two and six a head, five\r\npound twelve and six, which left a surplus of five pound fifteen to be\r\nshared out (applause), which came to three shillings each for the\r\nthirty-seven men, and one and fourpence for each of the boys.  (Loud\r\nand prolonged cheers.)\r\n\r\nCrass, Slyme and Bundy now walked round the tables distributing the\r\nshare-out, which was very welcome to everybody, especially those who\r\nhad spent nearly all their money during the journey from Mugsborough,\r\nand when this ceremony was completed, Philpot moved a hearty vote of\r\nthanks to the committee for the manner in which they had carried out\r\ntheir duties, which was agreed to with acclamation.  Then they made a\r\ncollection for the waiters, and the three waitresses, which amounted to\r\neleven shillings, for which the host returned thanks on behalf of the\r\nrecipients, who were all smiles.\r\n\r\nThen Mr Rushton requested the landlord to serve drinks and cigars all\r\nround.  Some had cigarettes and the teetotallers had lemonade or ginger\r\nbeer.  Those who did not smoke themselves took the cigar all the same\r\nand gave it to someone else who did.  When all were supplied there\r\nsuddenly arose loud cries of \'Order!\' and it was seen that Hunter was\r\nupon his feet.\r\n\r\nAs soon as silence was obtained, Misery said that he believed that\r\neveryone there present would agree with him, when he said that they\r\nshould not let the occasion pass without drinking the \'ealth of their\r\nesteemed and respected employer, Mr Rushton.  (Hear, hear.)  Some of\r\nthem had worked for Mr Rushton on and off for many years, and as far as\r\nTHEY was concerned it was not necessary for him (Hunter) to say much in\r\npraise of Mr Rushton.  (Hear, hear.)  They knew Mr Rushton as well as\r\nhe did himself and to know him was to esteem him.  (Cheers.) As for the\r\nnew hands, although they did not know Mr Rushton as well as the old\r\nhands did, he felt sure that they would agree that as no one could wish\r\nfor a better master.  (Loud applause.)  He had much pleasure in asking\r\nthem to drink Mr Rushton\'s health.  Everyone rose.\r\n\r\n\'Musical honours, chaps,\' shouted Crass, waving his glass and leading\r\noff the singing which was immediately joined in with great enthusiasm\r\nby most of the men, the Semi-drunk conducting the music with a table\r\nknife:\r\n\r\n        For he\'s a jolly good fellow,\r\n        For he\'s a jolly good fellow,\r\n        For he\'s a jolly good fel-ell-O,\r\n        And so say all of us,\r\n        So \'ip, \'ip, \'ip, \'ooray!\r\n        So \'ip, \'ip, \'ip, \'ooray!\r\n\r\n        For he\'s a jolly good fellow,\r\n        For \'e\'s a jolly good fellow\r\n        For \'e\'s a jolly good fel-ell-O,\r\n        And so say all of us.\r\n\r\n\'Now three cheers!\' shouted Crass, leading off.\r\n\r\n        Hip, hip, hip, hooray!\r\n        Hip, hip, hip, hooray!\r\n        Hip, hip, hip, hooray!\r\n\r\nEveryone present drank Rushton\'s health, or at any rate went through\r\nthe motions of doing so, but during the roar of cheering and singing\r\nthat preceded it several of the men stood with expressions of contempt\r\nor uneasiness upon their faces, silently watching the enthusiasts or\r\nlooking at the ceiling or on the floor.\r\n\r\n\'I will say this much,\' remarked the Semidrunk as they all resumed\r\ntheir seats--he had had several drinks during dinner, besides those he\r\nhad taken on the journey--I will say this much, although I did have a\r\nlittle misunderstanding with Mr Hunter when I was workin\' at the Royal\r\nCaff, I must admit that this is the best firm that\'s ever worked under\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\nThis statement caused a shout of laughter, which, however, died away as\r\nMr Rushton rose to acknowledge the toast to his health.  He said that\r\nhe had now been in business for nearly sixteen years and this was--he\r\nbelieved--the eleventh outing he had had the pleasure of attending.\r\nDuring all that time the business had steadily progressed and had\r\nincreased in volume from year to year, and he hoped and believed that\r\nthe progress made in the past would be continued in the future.  (Hear,\r\nhear.)  Of course, he realized that the success of the business\r\ndepended very largely upon the men as well as upon himself; he did his\r\nbest in trying to get work for them, and it was necessary--if the\r\nbusiness was to go on and prosper--that they should also do their best\r\nto get the work done when he had secured it for them. (Hear, hear.)\r\nThe masters could not do without the men, and the men could not live\r\nwithout the masters.  (Hear, hear.)  It was a matter of division of\r\nlabour: the men worked with their hands and the masters worked with\r\ntheir brains, and one was no use without the other.  He hoped the good\r\nfeeling which had hitherto existed between himself and his workmen\r\nwould always continue, and he thanked them for the way in which they\r\nhad responded to the toast of his health.\r\n\r\nLoud cheers greeted the conclusion of this speech, and then Crass stood\r\nup and said that he begged to propose the health of Mr \'Unter. (Hear,\r\nhear.)  He wasn\'t going to make a long speech as he wasn\'t much of a\r\nspeaker.  (Cries of \'You\'re all right,\' \'Go on,\' etc.)  But he felt\r\nsure as they would all hagree with him when he said that--next to Mr\r\nRushton--there wasn\'t no one the men had more respect and liking for\r\nthan Mr \'Unter.  (Cheers.)  A few weeks ago when Mr \'Unter was laid up,\r\nmany of them began to be afraid as they was going to lose \'im.  He was\r\nsure that all the \'ands was glad to \'ave this hoppertunity of\r\ncongratulating him on his recovery (Hear, hear) and of wishing him the\r\nbest of \'ealth in the future and hoping as he would be spared to come\r\nto a good many more Beanos.\r\n\r\nLoud applause greeted the conclusion of Crass\'s remarks, and once more\r\nthe meeting burst into song:\r\n\r\n        For he\'s a jolly good fellow\r\n        For he\'s a jolly good fellow.\r\n        For he\'s a jolly good fellow,\r\n        And so say all of us.\r\n        So \'ip, \'ip, \'ip, \'ooray!\r\n        So \'ip, \'ip, \'ip, \'ooray!\r\n\r\nWhen they had done cheering, Nimrod rose.  His voice trembled a little\r\nas he thanked them for their kindness, and said that he hoped he\r\ndeserved their goodwill.  He could only say that as he was sure as he\r\nalways tried to be fair and considerate to everyone.  (Cheers.)  He\r\nwould now request the landlord to replenish their glasses.  (Hear,\r\nhear.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the drinks were served, Nimrod again rose and said he wished\r\nto propose the healths of their visitors who had so kindly contributed\r\nto their expenses--Mr Lettum, Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf and Mr Grinder.\r\n(Cheers.)  They were very pleased and proud to see them there (Hear,\r\nhear), and he was sure the men would agree with him when he said that\r\nMessrs Lettum, Didlum, Toonarf and Grinder were jolly good fellows.\r\n\r\nTo judge from the manner in which they sang the chorus and cheered, it\r\nwas quite evident that most of the hands did agree.  When they left\r\noff, Grinder rose to reply on behalf of those included in the toast. He\r\nsaid that it gave them much pleasure to be there and take part in such\r\npleasant proceedings and they were glad to think that they had been\r\nable to help to bring it about.  It was very gratifying to see the good\r\nfeeling that existed between Mr Rushton and his workmen, which was as\r\nit should be, because masters and men was really fellow workers--the\r\nmasters did the brain work, the men the \'and work.  They was both\r\nworkers, and their interests was the same.  He liked to see men doing\r\ntheir best for their master and knowing that their master was doing his\r\nbest for them, that he was not only a master, but a friend.  That was\r\nwhat he (Grinder) liked to see--master and men pulling together--doing\r\ntheir best, and realizing that their interests was identical.\r\n(Cheers.)  If only all masters and men would do this they would find\r\nthat everything would go on all right, there would be more work and\r\nless poverty.  Let the men do their best for their masters, and the\r\nmasters do their best for their men, and they would find that that was\r\nthe true solution of the social problem, and not the silly nonsense\r\nthat was talked by people what went about with red flags.  (Cheers and\r\nlaughter.)  Most of those fellows were chaps who was too lazy to work\r\nfor their livin\'.  (Hear, hear.)  They could take it from him that, if\r\never the Socialists got the upper hand there would just be a few of the\r\nhartful dodgers who would get all the cream, and there would be nothing\r\nleft but \'ard work for the rest. (Hear. hear.)  That\'s wot hall those\r\nhagitators was after: they wanted them (his hearers) to work and keep\r\n\'em in idleness.  (Hear, hear.) On behalf of Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf, Mr\r\nLettum and himself, he thanked them for their good wishes, and hoped to\r\nbe with them on a sim\'ler occasion in the future.\r\n\r\nLoud cheers greeted the termination of his speech, but it was obvious\r\nfrom some of the men\'s faces that they resented Grinder\'s remarks.\r\nThese men ridiculed Socialism and regularly voted for the continuance\r\nof capitalism, and yet they were disgusted and angry with Grinder!\r\nThere was also a small number of Socialists--not more than half a dozen\r\naltogether--who did not join in the applause.  These men were all\r\nsitting at the end of the long table presided over by Payne.  None of\r\nthem had joined in the applause that greeted the speeches, and so far\r\nneither had they made any protest.  Some of them turned very red as\r\nthey listened to the concluding sentences of Grinder\'s oration, and\r\nothers laughed, but none of them said anything.  They knew before they\r\ncame that there was sure to be a lot of \'Jolly good fellow\' business\r\nand speechmaking, and they had agreed together beforehand to take no\r\npart one way or the other, and to refrain from openly dissenting from\r\nanything that might be said, but they had not anticipated anything\r\nquite so strong as this.\r\n\r\nWhen Grinder sat down some of those who had applauded him began to jeer\r\nat the Socialists.\r\n\r\n\'What have you got to say to that?\' they shouted.  \'That\'s up against\r\nyer!\'\r\n\r\n\'They ain\'t got nothing to say now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t some of you get up and make a speech?\'\r\n\r\nThis last appeared to be a very good idea to those Liberals and Tories\r\nwho had not liked Grinder\'s observations, so they all began to shout\r\n\'Owen!\' \'Owen!\' \'Come on \'ere.  Get up and make a speech!\' \'Be a man!\'\r\nand so on.  Several of those who had been loudest in applauding Grinder\r\nalso joined in the demand that Owen should make a speech, because they\r\nwere certain that Grinder and the other gentlemen would be able to\r\ndispose of all his arguments; but Owen and the other Socialists made no\r\nresponse except to laugh, so presently Crass tied a white handkerchief\r\non a cane walking-stick that belonged to Mr Didlum, and stuck it in the\r\nvase of flowers that stood on the end of the table where the Socialist\r\ngroup were sitting.\r\n\r\nWhen the noise had in some measure ceased, Grinder again rose.  \'When I\r\nmade the few remarks that I did, I didn\'t know as there was any\r\nSocialists \'ere: I could tell from the look of you that most of you had\r\nmore sense.  At the same time I\'m rather glad I said what I did,\r\nbecause it just shows you what sort of chaps these Socialists are.\r\nThey\'re pretty artful--they know when to talk and when to keep their\r\nmouths shut.  What they like is to get hold of a few ignorant workin\'\r\nmen in a workshop or a public house, and then they can talk by the\r\nmile--reg\'ler shop lawyers, you know wot I mean--I\'m right and\r\neverybody else is wrong.  (Laughter.)  You know the sort of thing I\r\nmean.  When they finds theirselves in the company of edicated people\r\nwot knows a little more than they does theirselves, and who isn\'t\r\nlikely to be misled by a lot of claptrap, why then, mum\'s the word. So\r\nnext time you hears any of these shop lawyers\' arguments, you\'ll know\r\nhow much it\'s worth.\'\r\n\r\nMost of the men were delighted with this speech, which was received\r\nwith much laughing and knocking on the tables.  They remarked to each\r\nother that Grinder was a smart man: he\'d got the Socialists weighed up\r\njust about right--to an ounce.\r\n\r\nThen, it was seen that Barrington was on his feet facing Grinder and a\r\nsudden, awe-filled silence fell.\r\n\r\n\'It may or may not be true,\' began Barrington, \'that Socialists always\r\nknow when to speak and when to keep silent, but the present occasion\r\nhardly seemed a suitable one to discuss such subjects.\r\n\r\n\'We are here today as friends and want to forget our differences and\r\nenjoy ourselves for a few hours.  But after what Mr Grinder has said I\r\nam quite ready to reply to him to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\n\'The fact that I am a Socialist and that I am here today as one of Mr\r\nRushton\'s employees should be an answer to the charge that Socialists\r\nare too lazy to work for their living.  And as to taking advantage of\r\nthe ignorance and simplicity of working men and trying to mislead them\r\nwith nonsensical claptrap, it would have been more to the point if Mr\r\nGrinder had taken some particular Socialist doctrine and had proved it\r\nto be untrue or misleading, instead of adopting the cowardly method of\r\nmaking vague general charges that he cannot substantiate.  He would\r\nfind it far more difficult to do that than it would be for a Socialist\r\nto show that most of what Mr Grinder himself has been telling us is\r\nnonsensical claptrap of the most misleading kind.  He tells us that the\r\nemployers work with their brains and the men with their hands.  If it\r\nis true that no brains are required to do manual labour, why put idiots\r\ninto imbecile asylums?  Why not let them do some of the hand work for\r\nwhich no brains are required?  As they are idiots, they would probably\r\nbe willing to work for even less than the ideal "living wage".  If Mr\r\nGrinder had ever tried, he would know that manual workers have to\r\nconcentrate their minds and their attention on their work or they would\r\nnot be able to do it at all.  His talk about employers being not only\r\nthe masters but the "friends" of their workmen is also mere claptrap\r\nbecause he knows as well as we do, that no matter how good or\r\nbenevolent an employer may be, no matter how much he might desire to\r\ngive his men good conditions, it is impossible for him to do so,\r\nbecause he has to compete against other employers who do not do that.\r\nIt is the bad employer--the sweating, slave-driving employer--who sets\r\nthe pace and the others have to adopt the same methods--very often\r\nagainst their inclinations--or they would not be able to compete with\r\nhim.  If any employer today were to resolve to pay his workmen not less\r\nwages than he would be able to live upon in comfort himself, that he\r\nwould not require them to do more work in a day than he himself would\r\nlike to perform every day of his own life, Mr Grinder knows as well as\r\nwe do that such an employer would be bankrupt in a month; because he\r\nwould not be able to get any work except by taking it at the same price\r\nas the sweaters and the slave-drivers.\r\n\r\n\'He also tells us that the interests of masters and men are identical;\r\nbut if an employer has a contract, it is to his interest to get the\r\nwork done as soon as possible; the sooner it is done the more profit he\r\nwill make; but the more quickly it is done, the sooner will the men be\r\nout of employment.  How then can it be true that their interests are\r\nidentical?\r\n\r\n\'Again, let us suppose that an employer is, say, thirty years of age\r\nwhen he commences business, and that he carries it on for twenty years.\r\nLet us assume that he employs forty men more or less regularly during\r\nthat period and that the average age of these men is also thirty years\r\nat the time the employer commences business.  At the end of the twenty\r\nyears it usually happens that the employer has made enough money to\r\nenable him to live for the remainder of his life in ease and comfort.\r\nBut what about the workman?  All through those twenty years they have\r\nearned but a bare living wage and have had to endure such privations\r\nthat those who are not already dead are broken in health.\r\n\r\n\'In the case of the employer there had been twenty years of steady\r\nprogress towards ease and leisure and independence.  In the case of the\r\nmajority of the men there were twenty years of deterioration, twenty\r\nyears of steady, continuous and hopeless progress towards physical and\r\nmental inefficiency: towards the scrap-heap, the work-house, and\r\npremature death.  What is it but false, misleading, nonsensical\r\nclaptrap to say that their interests were identical with those of their\r\nemployer?\r\n\r\n\'Such talk as that is not likely to deceive any but children or fools.\r\nWe are not children, but it is very evident that Mr Grinder thinks that\r\nwe are fools.\r\n\r\n\'Occasionally it happens, through one or more of a hundred different\r\ncircumstances over which he has no control, or through some error of\r\njudgement, that after many years of laborious mental work an employer\r\nis overtaken by misfortune, and finds himself no better and even worse\r\noff than when he started; but these are exceptional cases, and even if\r\nhe becomes absolutely bankrupt he is no worse off than the majority of\r\nthe workmen.\r\n\r\n\'At the same time it is quite true that the real interests of employers\r\nand workmen are the same, but not in the sense that Mr Grinder would\r\nhave us believe.  Under the existing system of society but a very few\r\npeople, no matter how well off they may be, can be certain that they or\r\ntheir children will not eventually come to want; and even those who\r\nthink they are secure themselves, find their happiness diminished by\r\nthe knowledge of the poverty and misery that surrounds them on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\'In that sense only is it true that the interests of masters and men\r\nare identical, for it is to the interest of all, both rich and poor, to\r\nhelp to destroy a system that inflicts suffering upon the many and\r\nallows true happiness to none.  It is to the interest of all to try and\r\nfind a better way.\'\r\n\r\nHere Crass jumped up and interrupted, shouting out that they hadn\'t\r\ncome there to listen to a lot of speechmaking--a remark that was\r\ngreeted with unbounded applause by most of those present.  Loud cries\r\nof \'Hear, hear!\' resounded through the room, and the Semi-drunk\r\nsuggested that someone should sing a song.\r\n\r\nThe men who had clamoured for a speech from Owen said nothing, and Mr\r\nGrinder, who had been feeling rather uncomfortable, was secretly very\r\nglad of the interruption.\r\n\r\nThe Semi-drunk\'s suggestion that someone should sing a song was\r\nreceived with unqualified approbation by everybody, including\r\nBarrington and the other Socialists, who desired nothing better than\r\nthat the time should be passed in a manner suitable to the occasion.\r\nThe landlord\'s daughter, a rosy girl of about twenty years of age, in a\r\npink print dress, sat down at the piano, and the Semi-drunk, taking his\r\nplace at the side of the instrument and facing the audience, sang the\r\nfirst song with appropriate gestures, the chorus being rendered\r\nenthusiastically by the full strength of the company, including Misery,\r\nwho by this time was slightly drunk from drinking gin and ginger beer:\r\n\r\n        \'Come, come, come an\' \'ave a drink with me\r\n        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.\r\n        Come, come, come an\' shake \'ands with me\r\n        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.\r\n        Wot cheer me little Germin band!\r\n        Fol the diddle di do!\r\n        Come an\' take \'old of me \'and\r\n        Come, come, come an\' \'ave a drink with me,\r\n        Down by the old Bull and Bush,\r\n        Bush! Bush!\'\r\n\r\nProtracted knocking on the tables greeted the end of the song, but as\r\nthe Semi-drunk knew no other except odd verses and choruses, he called\r\nupon Crass for the next, and that gentleman accordingly sang \'Work,\r\nBoys, Work\' to the tune of \'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are\r\nmarching\'.  As this song is the Marseillaise of the Tariff Reform\r\nParty, voicing as it does the highest ideals of the Tory workmen of\r\nthis country, it was an unqualified success, for most of them were\r\nConservatives.\r\n\r\n        \'Now I\'m not a wealthy man,\r\n        But I lives upon a plan\r\n        Wot will render me as \'appy as a King;\r\n        An\' if you will allow, I\'ll sing it to you now,\r\n        For time you know is always on the wing.\r\n\r\n        Work, boys, work and be contented\r\n        So long as you\'ve enough to buy a meal.\r\n        For if you will but try, you\'ll be wealthy--bye and bye--\r\n        If you\'ll only put yer shoulder to the wheel.\'\r\n\r\n\'Altogether, boys,\' shouted Grinder, who was a strong Tariff Reformer,\r\nand was delighted to see that most of the men were of the same way of\r\nthinking; and the \'boys\' roared out the chorus once more:\r\n\r\n        Work, boys, work and be contented\r\n        So long as you\'ve enough to buy a meal\r\n        For if you will but try, you\'ll be wealthy--bye and bye\r\n        If you\'ll only put your shoulder to the wheel.\r\n\r\nAs they sang the words of this noble chorus the Tories seemed to become\r\ninspired with lofty enthusiasm.  It is of course impossible to say for\r\ncertain, but probably as they sang there arose before their exalted\r\nimaginations, a vision of the Past, and looking down the long vista of\r\nthe years that were gone, they saw that from their childhood they had\r\nbeen years of poverty and joyless toil.  They saw their fathers and\r\nmothers, weaned and broken with privation and excessive labour, sinking\r\nunhonoured into the welcome oblivion of the grave.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as a change came over the spirit of their dream, they saw the\r\nFuture, with their own children travelling along the same weary road to\r\nthe same kind of goal.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that visions of this character were conjured up in their\r\nminds by the singing, for the words of the song gave expression to\r\ntheir ideal of what human life should be.  That was all they wanted--to\r\nbe allowed to work like brutes for the benefit of other people. They\r\ndid not want to be civilized themselves and they intended to take good\r\ncare that the children they had brought into the world should never\r\nenjoy the benefits of civilization either.  As they often said:\r\n\r\n\'Who and what are our children that they shouldn\'t be made to work for\r\ntheir betters?  They\'re not Gentry\'s children, are they?  The good\r\nthings of life was never meant for the likes of them.  Let \'em work!\r\nThat\'s wot the likes of them was made for, and if we can only get\r\nTariff Reform for \'em they will always be sure of plenty of it--not\r\nonly Full Time, but Overtime!  As for edication, travellin\' in furrin\'\r\nparts, an\' enjoying life an\' all sich things as that, they was never\r\nmeant for the likes of our children--they\'re meant for Gentry\'s\r\nchildren!  Our children is only like so much dirt compared with\r\nGentry\'s children!  That\'s wot the likes of us is made for--to Work for\r\nGentry, so as they can \'ave plenty of time to enjoy theirselves; and\r\nthe Gentry is made to \'ave a good time so as the likes of us can \'ave\r\nPlenty of Work.\'\r\n\r\nThere were several more verses, and by the time they had sung them all,\r\nthe Tories were in a state of wild enthusiasm.  Even Ned Dawson, who\r\nhad fallen asleep with his head pillowed on his arms on the table,\r\nroused himself up at the end of each verse, and after having joined in\r\nthe chorus, went to sleep again.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the song they gave three cheers for Tariff Reform and\r\nPlenty of Work, and then Crass, who, as the singer of the last song,\r\nhad the right to call upon the next man, nominated Philpot, who\r\nreceived an ovation when he stood up, for he was a general favourite.\r\nHe never did no harm to nobody, and he was always wiling to do anyone a\r\ngood turn whenever he had the opportunity.  Shouts of \'Good old Joe\'\r\nresounded through the room as he crossed over to the piano, and in\r\nresponse to numerous requests for \'The old song\' he began to sing \'The\r\nFlower Show\':\r\n\r\n        \'Whilst walkin\' out the other night, not knowing where to go\r\n        I saw a bill upon a wall about a Flower Show.\r\n\r\n        So I thought the flowers I\'d go and see to pass away the night.\r\n        And when I got into that Show it was a curious sight.\r\n        So with your kind intention and a little of your aid,\r\n        Tonight some flowers I\'ll mention which I hope will never fade.\'\r\n\r\n        Omnes:\r\n        To-night some flowers I\'ll mention which I hope will never fade.\'\r\n\r\nThere were several more verses, from which it appeared that the\r\nprincipal flowers in the Show were the Rose, the Thistle and the\r\nShamrock.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, the applause was so deafening and the demands for\r\nan encore so persistent that to satisfy them he sang another old\r\nfavourite--\'Won\'t you buy my pretty flowers?\'\r\n\r\n        \'Ever coming, ever going,\r\n        Men and women hurry by,\r\n        Heedless of the tear-drops gleaming,\r\n        In her sad and wistful eye\r\n        How her little heart is sighing\r\n        Thro\' the cold and dreary hours,\r\n        Only listen to her crying,\r\n        "Won\'t you buy my pretty flowers?"\'\r\n\r\nWhen the last verse of this sang had been sung five er six times,\r\nPhilpot exercised his right of nominating the next singer, and called\r\nupon Dick Wantley, who with many suggestive gestures and grimaces sang\r\n\'Put me amongst the girls\', and afterwards called upon Payne, the\r\nforeman carpenter, who gave \'I\'m the Marquis of Camberwell Green\'.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of what music-hall artists call \'business\' attached to\r\nhis song, and as he proceeded, Payne, who was ghastly pale and very\r\nnervous, went through a lot of galvanic motions and gestures, bowing\r\nand scraping and sliding about and flourishing his handkerchief in\r\nimitation of the courtly graces of the Marquis.  During this\r\nperformance the audience maintained an appalling silence, which so\r\nembarrassed Payne that before he was half-way through the song he had\r\nto stop because he could not remember the rest.  However, to make up\r\nfor this failure he sang another called \'We all must die, like the fire\r\nin the grate\'.  This also was received in a very lukewarm manner by the\r\ncrowd, same of whom laughed and others suggested that if he couldn\'t\r\nsing any better than that, the sooner HE was dead the better.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by another Tory ballad, the chorus being as follows:\r\n\r\n        His clothes may be ragged, his hands may be soiled.\r\n        But where\'s the disgrace if for bread he has toiled.\r\n        His \'art is in the right place, deny it no one can\r\n        The backbone of Old England is the honest workin\' man.\'\r\n\r\nAfter a few more songs it was decided to adjourn to a field at the rear\r\nof the tavern to have a game of cricket.  Sides were formed, Rushton,\r\nDidlum, Grinder, and the other gentlemen taking part just as if they\r\nwere only common people, and while the game was in progress the rest\r\nplayed ring quoits or reclined on the grass watching the players,\r\nwhilst the remainder amused themselves drinking beer and playing cards\r\nand shove-ha\'penny in the bar parlour, or taking walks around the\r\nvillage sampling the beer at the other pubs, of which there were three.\r\n\r\nThe time passed in this manner until seven o\'clock, the hour at which\r\nit had been arranged to start on the return journey; but about a\r\nquarter of an hour before they set out an unpleasant incident occurred.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that they were playing cricket a party of glee singers,\r\nconsisting of four young girls and five men, three of whom were young\r\nfellows, the other two being rather elderly, possibly the fathers of\r\nsome of the younger members of the party, came into the field and sang\r\nseveral part songs for their entertainment.  Towards the close of the\r\ngame most of the men had assembled in this field, and during a pause in\r\nthe singing the musicians sent one of their number, a shy girl about\r\neighteen years of age--who seemed as if she would rather that someone\r\nelse had the task--amongst the crowd to make a collection.  The girl\r\nwas very nervous and blushed as she murmured her request, and held out\r\na straw hat that evidently belonged to one of the male members of the\r\nglee party.  A few of the men gave pennies, some refused or pretended\r\nnot to see either the girl or the hat, others offered to give her some\r\nmoney for a kiss, but what caused the trouble was that two or three of\r\nthose who had been drinking more than was good for them dropped the\r\nstill burning ends of their cigars, all wet with saliva as they were,\r\ninto the hat and Dick Wantley spit into it.\r\n\r\nThe girl hastily returned to her companions, and as she went some of\r\nthe men who had witnessed the behaviour of those who had insulted her,\r\nadvised them to make themselves scarce, as they stood a good chance of\r\ngetting a thrashing from the girl\'s friends.  They said it would serve\r\nthem dam\' well right if they did get a hammering.\r\n\r\nPartly sobered by fear, the three culprits sneaked off and hid\r\nthemselves, pale and trembling with terror, under the box seats of the\r\nthree brakes.  They had scarcely left when the men of the glee party\r\ncame running up, furiously demanding to see those who had insulted the\r\ngirl.  As they could get no satisfactory answer, one of their number\r\nran back and presently returned, bringing the girl with him, the other\r\nyoung women following a little way behind.\r\n\r\nShe said she could not see the men they were looking for, so they went\r\ndown to the public house to see if they could find them there, some of\r\nthe Rushton\'s men accompanying them and protesting their indignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time passed quickly enough and by half past seven the brakes were\r\nloaded up again and a start made for the return journey.\r\n\r\nThey called at all the taverns on the road, and by the time they\r\nreached the Blue Lion half of them were three sheets in the wind, and\r\nfive or six were very drunk, including the driver of Crass\'s brake and\r\nthe man with the bugle.  The latter was so far gone that they had to\r\nlet him lie down in the bottom of the carriage amongst their feet,\r\nwhere he fell asleep, while the others amused themselves by blowing\r\nweird shrieks out of the horn.\r\n\r\nThere was an automatic penny-in-the-slot piano at the Blue Lion and as\r\nthat was the last house of the road they made a rather long stop there,\r\nplaying hooks and rings, shove-ha\'penny, drinking, singing, dancing and\r\nfinally quarrelling.\r\n\r\nSeveral of them seemed disposed to quarrel with Newman.  All sorts of\r\noffensive remarks were made at him in his hearing.  Once someone\r\nostentatiously knocked his glass of lemonade over, and a little later\r\nsomeone else collided violently with him just as he was in the act of\r\ndrinking, causing his lemonade to spill all over his clothes.  The\r\nworst of it was that most of these rowdy ones were his fellow\r\npassengers in Crass\'s brake, and there was not much chance of getting a\r\nseat in either of the other carriages, for they were overcrowded\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nFrom the remarks he overheard from time to time, Newman guessed the\r\nreason of their hostility, and as their manner towards him grew more\r\nmenacing, he became so nervous that he began to think of quietly\r\nsneaking off and walking the remainder of the way home by himself,\r\nunless he could get somebody in one of the other brakes to change seats\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nWhilst these thoughts were agitating his mind, Dick Wantley suddenly\r\nshouted out that he was going to go for the dirty tyke who had offered\r\nto work under price last winter.\r\n\r\nIt was his fault that they were all working for sixpence halfpenny and\r\nhe was going to wipe the floor with him.  Some of his friends eagerly\r\noffered to assist, but others interposed, and for a time it looked as\r\nif there was going to be a free fight, the aggressors struggling hard\r\nto get at their inoffensive victim.\r\n\r\nEventually, however, Newman found a seat in Misery\'s brake, squatting\r\non the floor with his back to the horses, thankful enough to be out of\r\nreach of the drunken savages, who were now roaring out ribald songs and\r\nstartling the countryside, as they drove along, with unearthly blasts\r\non the coach horn.\r\n\r\nMeantime, although none of them seemed to notice it, the brake was\r\ntravelling at a furious rate, and swaying about from side to side in a\r\nvery erratic manner.  It would have been the last carriage, but things\r\nhad got a bit mixed at the Blue Lion and, instead of bringing up the\r\nrear of the procession, it was now second, just behind the small\r\nvehicle containing Rushton and his friends.\r\n\r\nCrass several times reminded them that the other carriage was so near\r\nthat Rushton must be able to hear every word that was said, and these\r\nrepeated admonitions at length enraged the Semi-drunk, who shouted out\r\nthat they didn\'t care a b--r if he could hear.  Who the bloody hell was\r\nhe?  To hell with him!\r\n\r\n\'Damn Rushton, and you too!\' cried Bill Bates, addressing Crass.\r\n\'You\'re only a dirty toe-rag!  That\'s all you are--a bloody rotter!\r\nThat\'s the only reason you gets put in charge of jobs--\'cos you\'re a\r\ngood nigger-driver!  You\'re a bloody sight worse than Rushton or Misery\r\neither!  Who was it started the one-man, one-room dodge, eh? Why, you,\r\nyer bleeder!\'\r\n\r\n\'Knock \'im orf \'is bleedin\' perch,\' suggested Bundy.\r\n\r\nEverybody seemed to think this was a very good idea, but when the\r\nSemi-drunk attempted to rise for the purpose of carrying it out, he was\r\nthrown down by a sudden lurch of the carriage on the top of the\r\nprostrate figure of the bugle man and by the time the others had\r\nassisted him back to his seat they had forgotten all about their plan\r\nof getting rid of Crass.\r\n\r\nMeantime the speed of the vehicle had increased to a fearful rate.\r\n\r\nRushton and the other occupants of the little wagonette in front had\r\nbeen for some time shouting to them to moderate the pace of their\r\nhorses, but as the driver of Crass\'s brake was too drunk to understand\r\nwhat they said he took no notice, and they had no alternative but to\r\nincrease their own speed to avoid being run down.  The drunken driver\r\nnow began to imagine that they were trying to race him, and became\r\nfired with the determination to pass them.  It was a very narrow road,\r\nbut there was just about room to do it, and he had sufficient\r\nconfidence in his own skill with the ribbons to believe that he could\r\nget past in safety.\r\n\r\nThe terrified gesticulations and the shouts of Rushton\'s party only\r\nserved to infuriate him, because he imagined that they were jeering at\r\nhim for not being able to overtake them.  He stood up on the footboard\r\nand lashed the horses till they almost flew over the ground, while the\r\ncarriage swayed and skidded in a fearful manner.\r\n\r\nIn front, the horses of Rushton\'s conveyance were also galloping at top\r\nspeed, the vehicle bounding and reeling from one side of the road to\r\nthe other, whilst its terrified occupants, whose faces were blanched\r\nwith apprehension, sat clinging to their seats and to each other, their\r\neyes projecting from the sockets as they gazed back with terror at\r\ntheir pursuers, some of whom were encouraging the drunken driver with\r\npromises of quarts of beer, and urging on the horses with curses and\r\nyells.\r\n\r\nCrass\'s fat face was pallid with fear as he clung trembling to his\r\nseat.  Another man, very drunk and oblivious of everything, was leaning\r\nover the side of the brake, spewing into the road, while the remainder,\r\ntaking no interest in the race, amused themselves by singing--conducted\r\nby the Semi-drunk--as loud as they could roar:\r\n\r\n        \'Has anyone seen a Germin band,\r\n        Germin Band, Germin Band?\r\n        I\'ve been lookin\' about,\r\n        Pom--Pom, Pom, Pom, Pom!\r\n\r\n        \'I\'ve searched every pub, both near and far,\r\n        Near and far, near and far,\r\n        I want my Fritz,\r\n        What plays tiddley bits\r\n        On the big trombone!\'\r\n\r\nThe other two brakes had fallen far behind.  The one presided over by\r\nHunter contained a mournful crew.  Nimrod himself, from the effects of\r\nnumerous drinks of ginger beer with secret dashes of gin in it, had\r\nbecome at length crying drunk, and sat weeping in gloomy silence beside\r\nthe driver, a picture of lachrymose misery and but dimly conscious of\r\nhis surroundings, and Slyme, who rode with Hunter because he was a\r\nfellow member of the Shining Light Chapel.  Then there was another\r\npaperhanger--an unhappy wretch who was afflicted with religious mania;\r\nhe had brought a lot of tracts with him which he had distributed to the\r\nother men, to the villagers of Tubberton and to anybody else who would\r\ntake them.\r\n\r\nMost of the other men who rode in Nimrod\'s brake were of the\r\n\'religious\' working man type.  Ignorant, shallow-pated dolts, without\r\nas much intellectuality as an average cat.  Attendants at various PSAs\r\nand \'Church Mission Halls\' who went every Sunday afternoon to be\r\nlectured on their duty to their betters and to have their minds--save\r\nthe mark!--addled and stultified by such persons as Rushton, Sweater,\r\nDidlum and Grinder, not to mention such mental specialists as the holy\r\nreverend Belchers and Boshers, and such persons as John Starr.\r\n\r\nAt these meetings none of the \'respectable\' working men were allowed to\r\nask any questions, or to object to, or find fault with anything that\r\nwas said, or to argue, or discuss, or criticize.  They had to sit there\r\nlike a lot of children while they were lectured and preached at and\r\npatronized.  Even as sheep before their shearers are dumb, so they were\r\nnot permitted to open their mouths.  For that matter they did not wish\r\nto be allowed to ask any questions, or to discuss anything.  They would\r\nnot have been able to.  They sat there and listened to what was said,\r\nbut they had but a very hazy conception of what it was all about.\r\n\r\nMost of them belonged to these PSAs merely for the sake of the loaves\r\nand fishes.  Every now and then they were awarded prizes--Self-help by\r\nSmiles, and other books suitable for perusal by persons suffering from\r\nalmost complete obliteration of the mental faculties.  Besides other\r\nbenefits there was usually a Christmas Club attached to the \'PSA\' or\r\n\'Mission\' and the things were sold to the members slightly below cost\r\nas a reward for their servility.\r\n\r\nThey were for the most part tame, broken-spirited, poor wretches who\r\ncontentedly resigned themselves to a life of miserable toil and\r\npoverty, and with callous indifference abandoned their offspring to the\r\nsame fate.  Compared with such as these, the savages of New Guinea or\r\nthe Red Indians are immensely higher in the scale of manhood.  They are\r\nfree!  They call no man master; and if they do not enjoy the benefits\r\nof science and civilization, neither do they toil to create those\r\nthings for the benefit of others.  And as for their children--most of\r\nthose savages would rather knock them on the head with a tomahawk than\r\nallow them to grow up to be half-starved drudges for other men.\r\n\r\nBut these were not free: their servile lives were spent in grovelling\r\nand cringing and toiling and running about like little dogs at the\r\nbehest of their numerous masters.  And as for the benefits of science\r\nand civilization, their only share was to work and help to make them,\r\nand then to watch other men enjoy them.  And all the time they were\r\ntame and quiet and content and said, \'The likes of us can\'t expect to\r\n\'ave nothing better, and as for our children wot\'s been good enough for\r\nus is good enough for the likes of them.\'\r\n\r\nBut although they were so religious and respectable and so contented to\r\nbe robbed on a large scale, yet in small matters, in the commonplace\r\nand petty affairs of their everyday existence, most of these men were\r\nacutely alive to what their enfeebled minds conceived to be their own\r\nselfish interests, and they possessed a large share of that singular\r\ncunning which characterizes this form of dementia.\r\n\r\nThat was why they had chosen to ride in Nimrod\'s brake--because they\r\nwished to chum up with him as much as possible, in order to increase\r\ntheir chances of being kept on in preference to others who were not so\r\nrespectable.\r\n\r\nSome of these poor creatures had very large heads, but a close\r\nexamination would have shown that the size was due to the extraordinary\r\nthickness of the bones.  The cavity of the skull was not so large as\r\nthe outward appearance of the head would have led a casual observer to\r\nsuppose, and even in those instances where the brain was of a fair\r\nsize, it was of inferior quality, being coarse in texture and to a\r\ngreat extent composed of fat.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of them were regular attendants at some place of\r\nso-called worship, they were not all teetotallers, and some of them\r\nwere now in different stages of intoxication, not because they had had\r\na great deal to drink, but because--being usually abstemious--it did\r\nnot take very much to make them drunk.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time this miserable crew tried to enliven the journey by\r\nsinging, but as most of them only knew odd choruses it did not come to\r\nmuch.  As for the few who did happen to know all the words of a song,\r\nthey either had no voices or were not inclined to sing.  The most\r\nsuccessful contribution was that of the religious maniac, who sang\r\nseveral hymns, the choruses being joined in by everybody, both drunk\r\nand sober.\r\n\r\nThe strains of these hymns, wafted back through the balmy air to the\r\nlast coach, were the cause of much hilarity to its occupants who also\r\nsang the choruses.  As they had all been brought up under \'Christian\'\r\ninfluences and educated in \'Christian\' schools, they all knew the\r\nwords: \'Work, for the night is coming\', \'Turn poor Sinner and escape\r\nEternal Fire\', \'Pull for the Shore\' and \'Where is my Wandering Boy?\'\r\n\r\nThe last reminded Harlow of a song he knew nearly all the words of,\r\n\'Take the news to Mother\', the singing of which was much appreciated by\r\nall present and when it was finished they sang it all over again,\r\nPhilpot being so affected that he actually shed tears; and Easton\r\nconfided to Owen that there was no getting away from the fact that a\r\nboy\'s best friend is his mother.\r\n\r\nIn this last carriage, as in the other two, there were several men who\r\nwere more or less intoxicated and for the same reason--because not\r\nbeing used to taking much liquor, the few extra glasses they had drunk\r\nhad got into their heads.  They were as sober a lot of fellows as need\r\nbe at ordinary times, and they had flocked together in this brake\r\nbecause they were all of about the same character--not tame, contented\r\nimbeciles like most of those in Misery\'s carnage, but men something\r\nlike Harlow, who, although dissatisfied with their condition, doggedly\r\ncontinued the hopeless, weary struggle against their fate.\r\n\r\nThey were not teetotallers and they never went to either church or\r\nchapel, but they spent little in drink or on any form of enjoyment--an\r\noccasional glass of beer or a still rarer visit to a music-hall and now\r\nand then an outing more or less similar to this being the sum total of\r\ntheir pleasures.\r\n\r\nThese four brakes might fitly be regarded as so many travelling lunatic\r\nasylums, the inmates of each exhibiting different degrees and forms of\r\nmental disorder.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the first--Rushton, Didlum and Co.--might be classed\r\nas criminal lunatics who injured others as well as themselves. In a\r\nproperly constituted system of society such men as these would be\r\nregarded as a danger to the community, and would be placed under such\r\nrestraint as would effectually prevent them from harming themselves or\r\nothers.  These wretches had abandoned every thought and thing that\r\ntends to the elevation of humanity.  They had given up everything that\r\nmakes life good and beautiful, in order to carry on a mad struggle to\r\nacquire money which they would never be sufficiently cultured to\r\nproperly enjoy.  Deaf and blind to every other consideration, to this\r\nend they had degraded their intellects by concentrating them upon the\r\nminutest details of expense and profit, and for their reward they raked\r\nin their harvest of muck and lucre along with the hatred and curses of\r\nthose they injured in the process.  They knew that the money they\r\naccumulated was foul with the sweat of their brother men, and wet with\r\nthe tears of little children, but they were deaf and blind and callous\r\nto the consequences of their greed.  Devoid of every ennobling thought\r\nor aspiration, they grovelled on the filthy ground, tearing up the\r\nflowers to get at the worms.\r\n\r\nIn the coach presided over by Crass, Bill Bates, the Semi-drunk and the\r\nother two or three habitual boozers were all men who had been driven\r\nmad by their environment.  At one time most of them had been fellows\r\nlike Harlow, working early and late whenever they got the chance, only\r\nto see their earnings swallowed up in a few minutes every Saturday by\r\nthe landlord and all the other host of harpies and profitmongers, who\r\nwere waiting to demand it as soon as it was earned. In the years that\r\nwere gone, most of these men used to take all their money home\r\nreligiously every Saturday and give it to the \'old girl\' for the house,\r\nand then, lo and behold, in a moment, yea, even in the twinkling of an\r\neye, it was all gone!  Melted away like snow in the sun! and nothing to\r\nshow for it except an insufficiency of the bare necessaries of life!\r\nBut after a time they had become heartbroken and sick and tired of that\r\nsort of thing.  They hankered after a little pleasure, a little\r\nexcitement, a little fun, and they found that it was possible to buy\r\nsomething like those in quart pots at the pub. They knew they were not\r\nthe genuine articles, but they were better than nothing at all, and so\r\nthey gave up the practice of giving all their money to the old girl to\r\ngive to the landlord and the other harpies, and bought beer with some\r\nof it instead; and after a time their minds became so disordered from\r\ndrinking so much of this beer, that they cared nothing whether the rent\r\nwas paid or not.  They cared but little whether the old girl and the\r\nchildren had food or clothes. They said, \'To hell with everything and\r\neveryone,\' and they cared for nothing so long as they could get plenty\r\nof beer.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of Nimrod\'s coach have already been described and most of\r\nthem may correctly be classed as being similar to cretin idiots of the\r\nthird degree--very cunning and selfish, and able to read and write, but\r\nwith very little understanding of what they read except on the most\r\ncommon topics.\r\n\r\nAs for those who rode with Harlow in the last coach, most of them, as\r\nhas been already intimated, were men of similar character to himself.\r\nThe greater number of them fairly good workmen and--unlike the boozers\r\nin Crass\'s coach--not yet quite heartbroken, but still continuing the\r\nhopeless struggle against poverty.  These differed from Nimrod\'s lot\r\ninasmuch as they were not content.  They were always complaining of\r\ntheir wretched circumstances, and found a certain kind of pleasure in\r\nlistening to the tirades of the Socialists against the existing social\r\nconditions, and professing their concurrence with many of the\r\nsentiments expressed, and a desire to bring about a better state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nMost of them appeared to be quite sane, being able to converse\r\nintelligently on any ordinary subject without discovering any symptoms\r\nof mental disorder, and it was not until the topic of Parliamentary\r\nelections was mentioned that evidence of their insanity was\r\nforthcoming.  It then almost invariably appeared that they were subject\r\nto the most extraordinary hallucinations and extravagant delusions, the\r\ncommonest being that the best thing that the working people could do to\r\nbring about an improvement in their condition, was to continue to elect\r\ntheir Liberal and Tory employers to make laws for and to rule over\r\nthem!  At such times, if anyone ventured to point out to them that that\r\nwas what they had been doing all their lives, and referred them to the\r\nmanifold evidences that met them wherever they turned their eyes of its\r\nfolly and futility, they were generally immediately seized with a\r\nparoxysm of the most furious mania, and were with difficulty prevented\r\nfrom savagely assaulting those who differed from them.\r\n\r\nThey were usually found in a similar condition of maniacal excitement\r\nfor some time preceding and during a Parliamentary election, but\r\nafterwards they usually manifested that modification of insanity which\r\nis called melancholia.  In fact they alternated between these two forms\r\nof the disease.  During elections, the highest state of exalted mania;\r\nand at ordinary times--presumably as a result of reading about the\r\nproceedings in Parliament of the persons whom they had elected--in a\r\nstate of melancholic depression, in their case an instance of hope\r\ndeferred making the heart sick.\r\n\r\nThis condition occasionally proved to be the stage of transition into\r\nyet another modification of the disease--that known as dipsomania, the\r\nphase exhibited by Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk.\r\n\r\nYet another form of insanity was that shown by the Socialists.  Like\r\nmost of their fellow passengers in the last coach, the majority of\r\nthese individuals appeared to be of perfectly sound mind.  Upon\r\nentering into conversation with them one found that they reasoned\r\ncorrectly and even brilliantly.  They had divided their favourite\r\nsubject into three parts.  First; an exact definition of the condition\r\nknown as Poverty.  Secondly; a knowledge of the causes of Poverty; and\r\nthirdly, a rational plan for the cure of Poverty.  Those who were\r\nopposed to them always failed to refute their arguments, and feared,\r\nand nearly always refused, to meet them in fair fight--in open\r\ndebate--preferring to use the cowardly and despicable weapons of\r\nslander and misrepresentation.  The fact that these Socialists never\r\nencountered their opponents except to defeat them, was a powerful\r\ntestimony to the accuracy of their reasonings and the correctness of\r\ntheir conclusions--and yet they were undoubtedly mad. One might\r\nconverse with them for an indefinite time on the three divisions of\r\ntheir subject without eliciting any proofs of insanity, but directly\r\none inquired what means they proposed to employ in order to bring about\r\nthe adoption of their plan, they replied that they hoped to do so by\r\nreasoning with the others!\r\n\r\nAlthough they had sense enough to understand the real causes of\r\npoverty, and the only cure for poverty, they were nevertheless so\r\nfoolish that they entertained the delusion that it is possible to\r\nreason with demented persons, whereas every sane person knows that to\r\nreason with a maniac is not only fruitless, but rather tends to fix\r\nmore deeply the erroneous impressions of his disordered mind.\r\n\r\nThe wagonette containing Rushton and his friends continued to fly over\r\nthe road, pursued by the one in which rode Crass, Bill Bates, and the\r\nSemi-drunk; but notwithstanding all the efforts of the drunken driver,\r\nthey were unable to overtake or pass the smaller vehicle, and when they\r\nreached the foot of the hill that led up to Windley the distance\r\nbetween the two carriages rapidly increased, and the race was\r\nreluctantly abandoned.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the top of the hill Rushton and his friends did not\r\nwait for the others, but drove off towards Mugsborough as fast as they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nCrass\'s brake was the next to arrive at the summit, and they halted\r\nthere to wait for the other two conveyances and when they came up all\r\nthose who lived nearby got out, and some of them sang \'God Save the\r\nKing\', and then with shouts of \'Good Night\', and cries of \'Don\'t forget\r\nsix o\'clock Monday morning\', they dispersed to their homes and the\r\ncarriages moved off once more.\r\n\r\nAt intervals as they passed through Windley brief stoppages were made\r\nin order to enable others to get out, and by the time they reached the\r\ntop of the long incline that led down into Mugsborough it was nearly\r\ntwelve o\'clock and the brakes were almost empty, the only passengers\r\nbeing Owen and four or five others who lived down town.  By ones and\r\ntwos these also departed, disappearing into the obscurity of the night,\r\nuntil there was none left, and the Beano was an event of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 45\r\n\r\nThe Great Oration\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the approaching winter was--as usual--gloomy in the\r\nextreme.  One of the leading daily newspapers published an article\r\nprophesying a period of severe industrial depression.  \'As the\r\nwarehouses were glutted with the things produced by the working\r\nclasses, there was no need for them to do any more work--at present;\r\nand so they would now have to go and starve until such time as their\r\nmasters had sold or consumed the things already produced.\'  Of course,\r\nthe writer of the article did not put it exactly like that, but that\r\nwas what it amounted to.  This article was quoted by nearly all the\r\nother papers, both Liberal and Conservative.  The Tory papers--ignoring\r\nthe fact that all the Protectionist countries were in exactly the same\r\ncondition, published yards of misleading articles about Tariff Reform.\r\nThe Liberal papers said Tariff Reform was no remedy. Look at America\r\nand Germany--worse than here!  Still, the situation was undoubtedly\r\nvery serious--continued the Liberal papers--and Something would have to\r\nbe done.  They did not say exactly what, because, of course, they did\r\nnot know; but Something would have to be done--tomorrow.  They talked\r\nvaguely about Re-afforestation, and Reclaiming of Foreshores, and Sea\r\nwalls: but of course there was the question of Cost! that was a\r\ndifficulty.  But all the same Something would have to be done.  Some\r\nExperiments must be tried!  Great caution was necessary in dealing with\r\nsuch difficult problems!  We must go slow, and if in the meantime a few\r\nthousand children die of starvation, or become \'rickety\' or consumptive\r\nthrough lack of proper nutrition it is, of course, very regrettable,\r\nbut after all they are only working-class children, so it doesn\'t\r\nmatter a great deal.\r\n\r\nMost of the writers of these Liberal and Tory papers seemed to think\r\nthat all that was necessary was to find \'Work\' for the \'working\' class!\r\nThat was their conception of a civilized nation in the twentieth\r\ncentury!  For the majority of the people to work like brutes in order\r\nto obtain a \'living wage\' for themselves and to create luxuries for a\r\nsmall minority of persons who are too lazy to work at all!  And\r\nalthough this was all they thought was necessary, they did not know\r\nwhat to do in order to bring even that much to pass!  Winter was\r\nreturning, bringing in its train the usual crop of horrors, and the\r\nLiberal and Tory monopolists of wisdom did not know what to do!\r\n\r\nRushton\'s had so little work in that nearly all the hands expected that\r\nthey would be slaughtered the next Saturday after the \'Beano\' and there\r\nwas one man--Jim Smith he was called--who was not allowed to live even\r\ntill then: he got the sack before breakfast on the Monday morning after\r\nthe Beano.\r\n\r\nThis man was about forty-five years old, but very short for his age,\r\nbeing only a little over five feet in height.  The other men used to\r\nsay that Little Jim was not made right, for while his body was big\r\nenough for a six-footer, his legs were very short, and the fact that he\r\nwas rather inclined to be fat added to the oddity of his appearance.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning after the Beano he was painting an upper room in\r\na house where several other men were working, and it was customary for\r\nthe coddy to shout \'Yo! Ho!\' at mealtimes, to let the hands know when\r\nit was time to leave off work.  At about ten minutes to eight, Jim had\r\nsquared the part of the work he had been doing--the window--so he\r\ndecided not to start on the door or the skirting until after breakfast.\r\nWhilst he was waiting for the foreman to shout \'Yo! Ho!\' his mind\r\nreverted to the Beano, and he began to hum the tunes of some of the\r\nsongs that had been sung.  He hummed the tune of \'He\'s a jolly good\r\nfellow\', and he could not get the tune out of his mind: it kept buzzing\r\nin his head. He wondered what time it was?  It could not be very far\r\noff eight now, to judge by the amount of work he had done since six\r\no\'clock.  He had rubbed down and stopped all the woodwork and painted\r\nthe window.  A jolly good two hours\' work!  He was only getting\r\nsixpence-halfpenny an hour and if he hadn\'t earned a bob he hadn\'t\r\nearned nothing!  Anyhow, whether he had done enough for \'em or not he\r\nwasn\'t goin\' to do no more before breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe tune of \'He\'s a jolly good fellow\' was still buzzing in his head;\r\nhe thrust his hands deep down in his trouser pockets, and began to\r\npolka round the room, humming softly:\r\n\r\n        \'I won\'t do no more before breakfast!\r\n        I won\'t do no more before breakfast!\r\n        I won\'t do no more before breakfast!\r\n        So \'ip \'ip \'ip \'ooray!\r\n        So \'ip \'ip \'ip \'ooray So \'ip \'ip \'ooray!\r\n        I won\'t do no more before breakfast--etc.\'\r\n\r\n\'No! and you won\'t do but very little after breakfast, here!\' shouted\r\nHunter, suddenly entering the room.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve bin watchin\' of you through the crack of the door for the last\r\n\'arf hour; and you\'ve not done a dam\' stroke all the time.  You make\r\nout yer time sheet, and go to the office at nine o\'clock and git yer\r\nmoney; we can\'t afford to pay you for playing the fool.\'\r\n\r\nLeaving the man dumbfounded and without waiting for a reply, Misery\r\nwent downstairs and after kicking up a devil of a row with the foreman\r\nfor the lack of discipline on the job, he instructed him that Smith was\r\nnot to be permitted to resume work after breakfast.  Then he rode away.\r\nHe had come in so stealthily that no one had known anything of his\r\narrival until they heard him bellowing at Smith.\r\n\r\nThe latter did not stay to take breakfast but went off at once, and\r\nwhen he was gone the other chaps said it served him bloody well right:\r\nhe was always singing, he ought to have more sense.  You can\'t do as\r\nyou like nowadays you know!\r\n\r\nEaston--who was working at another job with Crass as his foreman--knew\r\nthat unless some more work came in he was likely to be one of those who\r\nwould have to go.  As far as he could see it was only a week or two at\r\nthe most before everything would be finished up.  But notwithstanding\r\nthe prospect of being out of work so soon he was far happier than he\r\nhad been for several months past, for he imagined he had discovered the\r\ncause of Ruth\'s strange manner.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge came to him on the night of the Beano.  When he arrived\r\nhome he found that Ruth had already gone to bed: she had not been well,\r\nand it was Mrs Linden\'s explanation of her illness that led Easton to\r\nthink that he had discovered the cause of the unhappiness of the last\r\nfew months.  Now that he knew--as he thought--he blamed himself for not\r\nhaving been more considerate and patient with her.  At the same time he\r\nwas at a loss to understand why she had not told him about it herself.\r\nThe only explanation he could think of was the one suggested by Mrs\r\nLinden--that at such times women often behaved strangely.  However that\r\nmight be, he was glad to think he knew the reason of it all, and he\r\nresolved that he would be more gentle and forebearing with her.\r\n\r\nThe place where he was working was practically finished.  It was a\r\nlarge house called \'The Refuge\', very similar to \'The Cave\', and during\r\nthe last week or two, it had become what they called a \'hospital\'.\r\nThat is, as the other jobs became finished the men were nearly all sent\r\nto this one, so that there was quite a large crowd of them there.  The\r\ninside work was all finished--with the exception of the kitchen, which\r\nwas used as a mess room, and the scullery, which was the paint shop.\r\n\r\nEverybody was working on the job.  Poor old Joe Philpot, whose\r\nrheumatism had been very bad lately, was doing a very rough\r\njob--painting the gable from a long ladder.\r\n\r\nBut though there were plenty of younger men more suitable for this,\r\nPhilpot did not care to complain for fear Crass or Misery should think\r\nhe was not up to his work.  At dinner time all the old hands assembled\r\nin the kitchen, including Crass, Easton, Harlow, Bundy and Dick\r\nWantley, who still sat on a pail behind his usual moat.\r\n\r\nPhilpot and Harlow were absent and everybody wondered what had become\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the morning they had been seen whispering together\r\nand comparing scraps of paper, and various theories were put forward to\r\naccount for their disappearance.  Most of the men thought they must\r\nhave heard something good about the probable winner of the Handicap and\r\nhad gone to put something on.  Some others thought that perhaps they\r\nhad heard of another \'job\' about to be started by some other firm and\r\nhad gone to inquire about it.\r\n\r\n\'Looks to me as if they\'ll stand a very good chance of gettin\' drowned\r\nif they\'re gone very far,\' remarked Easton, referring to the weather.\r\nIt had been threatening to rain all the morning, and during the last\r\nfew minutes it had become so dark that Crass lit the gas, so that--as\r\nhe expressed it--they should be able to see the way to their mouths.\r\nOutside, the wind grew more boisterous every moment; the darkness\r\ncontinued to increase, and presently there succeeded a torrential\r\ndownfall of rain, which beat fiercely against the windows, and poured\r\nin torrents down the glass.  The men glanced gloomily at each other. No\r\nmore work could be done outside that day, and there was nothing left to\r\ndo inside.  As they were paid by the hour, this would mean that they\r\nwould have to lose half a day\'s pay.\r\n\r\n\'If it keeps on like this we won\'t be able to do no more work, and we\r\nwon\'t be able to go home either,\' remarked Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Well, we\'re all right \'ere, ain\'t we?\' said the man behind the moat;\r\n\'there\'s a nice fire and plenty of heasy chairs.  Wot the \'ell more do\r\nyou want?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' remarked another philosopher.  \'If we only had a shove-ha\'penny\r\ntable or a ring board, I reckon we should be able to enjoy ourselves\r\nall right.\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot and Harlow were still absent, and the others again fell to\r\nwondering where they could be.\r\n\r\n\'I see old Joe up on \'is ladder only a few minutes before twelve,\'\r\nremarked Wantley.\r\n\r\nEveryone agreed that it was a mystery.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the two truants returned, looking very important.\r\n\r\nPhilpot was armed with a hammer and carried a pair of steps, while\r\nHarlow bore a large piece of wallpaper which the two of them proceeded\r\nto tack on the wall, much to the amusement of the others, who read the\r\nannouncement opposite written in charcoal.\r\n\r\nEvery day at meals since Barrington\'s unexpected outburst at the Beano\r\ndinner, the men had been trying their best to \'kid him on\' to make\r\nanother speech, but so far without success.  If anything, he had been\r\neven more silent and reserved than before, as if he felt some regret\r\nthat he had spoken as he had on that occasion.  Crass and his disciples\r\nattributed Barrington\'s manner to fear that he was going to get the\r\nsack for his trouble and they agreed amongst themselves that it would\r\nserve him bloody well right if \'e did get the push.\r\n\r\nWhen they had fixed the poster on the wall, Philpot stood the steps in\r\nthe corner of the room, with the back part facing outwards, and then,\r\neverything being ready for the lecturer, the two sat down in their\r\naccustomed places and began to eat their dinners, Harlow remarking that\r\nthey would have to buck up or they would be too late for the meeting;\r\nand the rest of the crowd began to discuss the poster.\r\n\r\n\'Wot the \'ell does PLO mean?\' demanded Bundy, with a puzzled expression.\r\n\r\n\'Plain Layer On,\' answered Philpot modestly.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ave you ever \'eard the Professor preach before?\' inquired the man on\r\nthe pail, addressing Bundy.\r\n\r\n                           Imperial Bankquet Hall\r\n                                \'The Refuge\'\r\n                         on Thursday at 12.30 prompt\r\n\r\n                            Professor Barrington\r\n                               WILL DELIVER A\r\n\r\n                                   ORATION\r\n\r\n                                  ENTITLED\r\n\r\n                            THE GREAT SECRET, OR\r\n                          HOW TO LIVE WITHOUT WORK\r\n\r\n                          The Rev.

I got \'ere about two hours before the doors was\r\nopened, so as to be sure to get a seat.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it\'s a very good subject,\' said Crass, with a sneer.  \'I believe\r\nmost of the Labour Members in Parliament is well up in it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And wot about the other members?\' demanded Philpot.  \'Seems to me as\r\nif most of them knows something about it too.\'\r\n\r\n\'The difference is,\' said Owen, \'the working classes voluntarily pay to\r\nkeep the Labour Members, but whether they like it or not, they have to\r\nkeep the others.\'\r\n\r\n\'The Labour members is sent to the \'Ouse of Commons,\' said Harlow, \'and\r\npaid their wages to do certain work for the benefit of the working\r\nclasses, just the same as we\'re sent \'ere and paid our wages by the\r\nBloke to paint this \'ouse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Crass; \'but if we didn\'t do the work we\'re paid to do, we\r\nshould bloody soon get the sack.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t see how we\'ve got to keep the other members,\' said Slyme;\r\n\'they\'re mostly rich men, and they live on their own money.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said Crass.  \'And I should like to know where we should be\r\nwithout \'em!  Talk about us keepin\' them!  It seems to me more like it\r\nthat they keeps us!  The likes of us lives on rich people.  Where\r\nshould we be if it wasn\'t for all the money they spend and the work\r\nthey \'as done?  If the owner of this \'ouse \'adn\'t \'ad the money to\r\nspend to \'ave it done up, most of us would \'ave bin out of work this\r\nlast six weeks, and starvin\', the same as lots of others \'as been.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, that\'s right enough,\' agreed Bundy.  \'Labour is no good\r\nwithout Capital.  Before any work can be done there\'s one thing\r\nnecessary, and that\'s money.  It would be easy to find work for all the\r\nunemployed if the local authorities could only raise the money.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; that\'s quite true,\' said Owen.  \'And that proves that money is\r\nthe cause of poverty, because poverty consists in being short of the\r\nnecessaries of life: the necessaries of life are all produced by labour\r\napplied to the raw materials: the raw materials exist in abundance and\r\nthere are plenty of people able and willing to work; but under present\r\nconditions no work can be done without money; and so we have the\r\nspectacle of a great army of people compelled to stand idle and starve\r\nby the side of the raw materials from which their labour could produce\r\nabundance of all the things they need--they are rendered helpless by\r\nthe power of Money!  Those who possess all the money say that the\r\nnecessaries of life shall not be produced except for their profit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes! and you can\'t alter it,\' said Crass, triumphantly.  \'It\'s always\r\nbeen like it, and it always will be like it.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear! \'Ear!\' shouted the man behind the moat.  \'There\'s always been\r\nrich and poor in the world, and there always will be.\'\r\n\r\nSeveral others expressed their enthusiastic agreement with Crass\'s\r\nopinion, and most of them appeared to be highly delighted to think that\r\nthe existing state of affairs could never be altered.\r\n\r\n\'It hasn\'t always been like it, and it won\'t always be like it,\' said\r\nOwen.  \'The time will come, and it\'s not very far distant, when the\r\nnecessaries of life will be produced for use and not for profit.  The\r\ntime is coming when it will no longer be possible for a few selfish\r\npeople to condemn thousands of men and women and little children to\r\nlive in misery and die of want.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah well, it won\'t be in your time, or mine either,\' said Crass\r\ngleefully, and most of the others laughed with imbecile satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve \'eard a \'ell of a lot about this \'ere Socialism,\' remarked the\r\nman behind the moat, \'but up to now I\'ve never met nobody wot could\r\ntell you plainly exactly wot it is.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; that\'s what I should like to know too,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'Socialism means, "What\'s yours is mine, and what\'s mine\'s me own,"\'\r\nobserved Bundy, and during the laughter that greeted this definition\r\nSlyme was heard to say that Socialism meant Materialism, Atheism and\r\nFree Love, and if it were ever to come about it would degrade men and\r\nwomen to the level of brute beasts.  Harlow said Socialism was a\r\nbeautiful ideal, which he for one would be very glad to see realized,\r\nand he was afraid it was altogether too good to be practical, because\r\nhuman nature is too mean and selfish.  Sawkins said that Socialism was\r\na lot of bloody rot, and Crass expressed the opinion--which he had\r\nculled from the delectable columns of the Obscurer--that it meant\r\nrobbing the industrious for the benefit of the idle and thriftless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilpot had by this time finished his bread and cheese, and, having\r\ntaken a final draught of tea, he rose to his feet, and crossing over to\r\nthe corner of the room, ascended the pulpit, being immediately greeted\r\nwith a tremendous outburst of hooting, howling and booing, which he\r\nsmilingly acknowledged by removing his cap from his bald head and\r\nbowing repeatedly.  When the storm of shrieks, yells, groans and\r\ncatcalls had in some degree subsided, and Philpot was able to make\r\nhimself heard, he addressed the meeting as follows:\r\n\r\n\'Gentlemen: First of all I beg to thank you very sincerely for the\r\nmagnificent and cordial reception you have given me on this occasion,\r\nand I shall try to deserve your good opinion by opening the meeting as\r\nbriefly as possible.\r\n\r\n\'Putting all jokes aside, I think we\'re all agreed about one thing, and\r\nthat is, that there\'s plenty of room for improvement in things in\r\ngeneral.  (Hear, hear.)  As our other lecturer, Professor Owen, pointed\r\nout in one of \'is lectures and as most of you \'ave read in the\r\nnewspapers, although British trade was never so good before as it is\r\nnow, there was never so much misery and poverty, and so many people out\r\nof work, and so many small shopkeepers goin\' up the spout as there is\r\nat this partickiler time.  Now, some people tells us as the way to put\r\neverything right is to \'ave Free Trade and plenty of cheap food. Well,\r\nwe\'ve got them all now, but the misery seems to go on all around us all\r\nthe same.  Then there\'s other people tells us as the \'Friscal Policy\'\r\nis the thing to put everything right.  ("Hear, hear" from Crass and\r\nseveral others.)  And then there\'s another lot that ses that Socialism\r\nis the only remedy.  Well, we all know pretty well wot Free Trade and\r\nProtection means, but most of us don\'t know exactly what Socialism\r\nmeans; and I say as it\'s the dooty of every man to try and find out\r\nwhich is the right thing to vote for, and when \'e\'s found it out, to do\r\nwot \'e can to \'elp to bring it about.  And that\'s the reason we\'ve gorn\r\nto the enormous expense of engaging Professor Barrington to come \'ere\r\nthis afternoon and tell us exactly what Socialism is.\r\n\r\n\'\'As I \'ope you\'re all just as anxious to \'ear it as I am myself, I\r\nwill not stand between you and the lecturer no longer, but will now\r\ncall upon \'im to address you.\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot was loudly applauded as he descended from the pulpit, and in\r\nresponse to the clamorous demands of the crowd, Barrington, who in the\r\nmeantime had yielded to Owen\'s entreaties that he would avail himself\r\nof this opportunity of proclaiming the glad tidings of the good time\r\nthat is to be, got up on the steps in his turn.\r\n\r\nHarlow, desiring that everything should be done decently and in order,\r\nhad meantime arranged in front of the pulpit a carpenter\'s sawing\r\nstool, and an empty pail with a small piece of board laid across it, to\r\nserve as a seat and a table for the chairman.  Over the table he draped\r\na large red handkerchief.  At the right he placed a plumber\'s large\r\nhammer; at the left, a battered and much-chipped jam-jar, full of tea.\r\nPhilpot having taken his seat on the pail at this table and announced\r\nhis intention of bashing out with the hammer the brains of any\r\nindividual who ventured to disturb the meeting, Barrington commenced:\r\n\r\n\'Mr Chairman and Gentlemen.  For the sake of clearness, and in order to\r\navoid confusing one subject with another, I have decided to divide the\r\noration into two parts.  First, I will try to explain as well as I am\r\nable what Socialism is.  I will try to describe to you the plan or\r\nsystem upon which the Co-operative Commonwealth of the future will be\r\norganized; and, secondly, I will try to tell you how it can be brought\r\nabout.  But before proceeding with the first part of the subject, I\r\nwould like to refer very slightly to the widespread delusion that\r\nSocialism is impossible because it means a complete change from an\r\norder of things which has always existed.  We constantly hear it said\r\nthat because there have always been rich and poor in the world, there\r\nalways must be.  I want to point out to you first of all, that it is\r\nnot true that even in its essential features, the present system has\r\nexisted from all time; it is not true that there have always been rich\r\nand poor in the world, in the sense that we understand riches and\r\npoverty today.\r\n\r\n\'These statements are lies that have been invented for the purpose of\r\ncreating in us a feeling of resignation to the evils of our condition.\r\nThey are lies which have been fostered by those who imagine that it is\r\nto their interest that we should be content to see our children\r\ncondemned to the same poverty and degradation that we have endured\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nI do not propose--because there is not time, although it is really part\r\nof my subject--to go back to the beginnings of history, and describe in\r\ndetail the different systems of social organization which evolved from\r\nand superseded each other at different periods, but it is necessary to\r\nremind you that the changes that have taken place in the past have been\r\neven greater than the change proposed by Socialists today.  The change\r\nfrom savagery and cannibalism when men used to devour the captives they\r\ntook in war--to the beginning of chattel slavery, when the tribes or\r\nclans into which mankind were divided--whose social organization was a\r\nkind of Communism, all the individuals belonging to the tribe being\r\npractically social equals, members of one great family--found it more\r\nprofitable to keep their captives as slaves than to eat them.  The\r\nchange from the primitive Communism of the tribes, into the more\r\nindividualistic organization of the nations, and the development of\r\nprivate ownership of the land and slaves and means of subsistence.  The\r\nchange from chattel slavery into Feudalism; and the change from\r\nFeudalism into the earlier form of Capitalism; and the equally great\r\nchange from what might be called the individualistic capitalism which\r\ndisplaced Feudalism, to the system of Co-operative Capitalism and Wage\r\nSlavery of today.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe you must \'ave swollered a bloody dictionary,\' exclaimed the\r\nman behind the moat.\r\n\r\n\'Keep horder,\' shouted Philpot, fiercely, striking the table with the\r\nhammer, and there were loud shouts of \'Chair\' and \'Chuck \'im out,\' from\r\nseveral quarters.\r\n\r\nWhen order was restored, the lecturer proceeded:\r\n\r\n\'So it is not true that practically the same state of affairs as we\r\nhave today has always existed.  It is not true that anything like the\r\npoverty that prevails at present existed at any previous period of the\r\nworld\'s history.  When the workers were the property of their masters,\r\nit was to their owners\' interest to see that they were properly clothed\r\nand fed; they were not allowed to be idle, and they were not allowed to\r\nstarve.  Under Feudalism also, although there were certain intolerable\r\ncircumstances, the position of the workers was, economically,\r\ninfinitely better than it is today.  The worker was in subjection to\r\nhis Lord, but in return his lord had certain responsibilities and\r\nduties to perform, and there was a large measure of community of\r\ninterest between them.\r\n\r\n\'I do not intend to dwell upon this pout at length, but in support of\r\nwhat I have said I will quote as nearly as I can from memory the words\r\nof the historian Froude.\r\n\r\n\'"I do not believe," says Mr Froude, "that the condition of the people\r\nin Mediaeval Europe was as miserable as is pretended.  I do not believe\r\nthat the distribution of the necessaries of life was as unequal as it\r\nis at present.  If the tenant lived hard, the lord had little luxury.\r\nEarls and countesses breakfasted at five in the morning, on salt beef\r\nand herring, a slice of bread and a draught of ale from a blackjack.\r\nLords and servants dined in the same hall and shared the same meal."\r\n\r\n\'When we arrive at the system that displaced Feudalism, we find that\r\nthe condition of the workers was better in every way than it is at\r\npresent.  The instruments of production--the primitive machinery and\r\nthe tools necessary for the creation of wealth--belonged to the skilled\r\nworkers who used them, and the things they produced were also the\r\nproperty of those who made them.\r\n\r\n\'In those days a master painter, a master shoemaker, a master saddler,\r\nor any other master tradesmen, was really a skilled artisan working on\r\nhis own account.  He usually had one or two apprentices, who were\r\nsocially his equals, eating at the same table and associating with the\r\nother members of his family.  It was quite a common occurrence for the\r\napprentice--after he had attained proficiency in his work--to marry his\r\nmaster\'s daughter and succeed to his master\'s business.  In those days\r\nto be a "master" tradesman meant to be master of the trade, not merely\r\nof some underpaid drudges in one\'s employment.  The apprentices were\r\nthere to master the trade, qualifying themselves to become master\r\nworkers themselves; not mere sweaters and exploiters of the labour of\r\nothers, but useful members of society.  In those days, because there\r\nwas no labour-saving machinery the community was dependent for its\r\nexistence on the productions of hand labour.  Consequently the majority\r\nof the people were employed in some kind of productive work, and the\r\nworkers were honoured and respected citizens, living in comfort on the\r\nfruits of their labour.  They were not rich as we understand wealth\r\nnow, but they did not starve and they were not regarded with contempt,\r\nas are their successors of today.\r\n\r\n\'The next great change came with the introduction of steam machinery.\r\nThat power came to the aid of mankind in their struggle for existence,\r\nenabling them to create easily and in abundance those things of which\r\nthey had previously been able to produce only a bare sufficiency.  A\r\nwonderful power--equalling and surpassing the marvels that were\r\nimagined by the writers of fairy tales and Eastern stories--a power so\r\nvast--so marvellous, that it is difficult to find words to convey\r\nanything like an adequate conception of it.\r\n\r\n\'We all remember the story, in The Arabian Nights, of Aladdin, who in\r\nhis poverty became possessed of the Wonderful Lamp and--he was poor no\r\nlonger.  He merely had to rub the Lamp--the Genie appeared, and at\r\nAladdin\'s command he produced an abundance of everything that the youth\r\ncould ask or dream of.  With the discovery of steam machinery, mankind\r\nbecame possessed of a similar power to that imagined by the Eastern\r\nwriter.  At the command of its masters the Wonderful Lamp of Machinery\r\nproduces an enormous, overwhelming, stupendous abundance and\r\nsuperfluity of every material thing necessary for human existence and\r\nhappiness.  With less labour than was formerly required to cultivate\r\nacres, we can now cultivate miles of land.  In response to human\r\nindustry, aided by science and machinery, the fruitful earth teems with\r\nsuch lavish abundance as was never known or deemed possible before.  If\r\nyou go into the different factories and workshops you will see\r\nprodigious quantities of commodities of every kind pouring out of the\r\nwonderful machinery, literally like water from a tap.\r\n\r\n\'One would naturally and reasonably suppose that the discovery or\r\ninvention of such an aid to human industry would result in increased\r\nhappiness and comfort for every one; but as you all know, the reverse\r\nis the case; and the reason of that extraordinary result, is the reason\r\nof all the poverty and unhappiness that we see around us and endure\r\ntoday--it is simply because--the machinery became the property of a\r\ncomparatively few individuals and private companies, who use it not for\r\nthe benefit of the community but to create profits for themselves.\r\n\r\n\'As this labour-saving machinery became more extensively used, the\r\nprosperous class of skilled workers gradually disappeared.  Some of the\r\nwealthier of them became distributers instead of producers of wealth;\r\nthat is to say, they became shopkeepers, retailing the commodities that\r\nwere produced for the most part by machinery.  But the majority of them\r\nin course of time degenerated into a class of mere wage earners, having\r\nno property in the machines they used, and no property in the things\r\nthey made.\r\n\r\n\'They sold their labour for so much per hour, and when they could not\r\nfind any employer to buy it from them, they were reduced to destitution.\r\n\r\n\'Whilst the unemployed workers were starving and those in employment\r\nnot much better off, the individuals and private companies who owned\r\nthe machinery accumulated fortunes; but their profits were diminished\r\nand their working expenses increased by what led to the latest great\r\nchange in the organization of the production of the necessaries of\r\nlife--the formation of the Limited Companies and the Trusts; the\r\ndecision of the private companies to combine and co-operate with each\r\nother in order to increase their profits and decrease their working\r\nexpenses.  The results of these combines have been--an increase in the\r\nquantities of the things produced: a decrease in the number of wage\r\nearners employed--and enormously increased profits for the shareholders.\r\n\r\n\'But it is not only the wage-earning class that is being hurt; for\r\nwhile they are being annihilated by the machinery and the efficient\r\norganization of industry by the trusts that control and are beginning\r\nto monopolize production, the shopkeeping classes are also being slowly\r\nbut surely crushed out of existence by the huge companies that are able\r\nby the greater magnitude of their operations to buy and sell more\r\ncheaply than the small traders.\r\n\r\n\'The consequence of all this is that the majority of the people are in\r\na condition of more or less abject poverty--living from hand to mouth.\r\nIt is an admitted fact that about thirteen millions of our people are\r\nalways on the verge of starvation.  The significant results of this\r\npoverty face us on every side.  The alarming and persistent increase of\r\ninsanity.  The large number of would-be recruits for the army who have\r\nto be rejected because they are physically unfit; and the shameful\r\ncondition of the children of the poor.  More than one-third of the\r\nchildren of the working classes in London have some sort of mental or\r\nphysical defect; defects in development; defects of eyesight; abnormal\r\nnervousness; rickets, and mental dullness.  The difference in height\r\nand weight and general condition of the children in poor schools and\r\nthe children of the so-called better classes, constitutes a crime that\r\ncalls aloud to Heaven for vengeance upon those who are responsible for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\'It is childish to imagine that any measure of Tariff Reform or\r\nPolitical Reform such as a paltry tax on foreign-made goods or\r\nabolishing the House of Lords, or disestablishing the Church--or\r\nmiserable Old Age Pensions, or a contemptible tax on land, can deal\r\nwith such a state of affairs as this.  They have no House of Lords in\r\nAmerica or France, and yet their condition is not materially different\r\nfrom ours.  You may be deceived into thinking that such measures as\r\nthose are great things.  You may fight for them and vote for them, but\r\nafter you have got them you will find that they will make no\r\nappreciable improvement in your condition.  You will still have to\r\nslave and drudge to gain a bare sufficiency of the necessaries of life.\r\nYou will still have to eat the same kind of food and wear the same kind\r\nof clothes and boots as now.  Your masters will still have you in their\r\npower to insult and sweat and drive.  Your general condition will be\r\njust the same as at present because such measures as those are not\r\nremedies but red herrings, intended by those who trail them to draw us\r\naway from the only remedy, which is to be found only in the Public\r\nOwnership of the Machinery, and the National Organization of Industry\r\nfor the production and distribution of the necessaries of life, not for\r\nthe profit of a few but for the benefit of all!\r\n\r\n\'That is the next great change; not merely desirable, but imperatively\r\nnecessary and inevitable!  That is Socialism!\r\n\r\n\'It is not a wild dream of Superhuman Unselfishness.  No one will be\r\nasked to sacrifice himself for the benefit of others or to love his\r\nneighbours better than himself as is the case under the present system,\r\nwhich demands that the majority shall unselfishly be content to labour\r\nand live in wretchedness for the benefit of a few.  There is no such\r\nprinciple of Philanthropy in Socialism, which simply means that even as\r\nall industries are now owned by shareholders, and organized and\r\ndirected by committees and officers elected by the shareholders, so\r\nshall they in future belong to the State, that is, the whole\r\npeople--and they shall be organized and directed by committees and\r\nofficers elected by the community.\r\n\r\n\'Under existing circumstances the community is exposed to the danger of\r\nbeing invaded and robbed and massacred by some foreign power. Therefore\r\nthe community has organized and owns and controls an Army and Navy to\r\nprotect it from that danger.  Under existing circumstances the\r\ncommunity is menaced by another equally great danger--the people are\r\nmentally and physically degenerating from lack of proper food and\r\nclothing.  Socialists say that the community should undertake and\r\norganize the business of producing and distributing all these things;\r\nthat the State should be the only employer of labour and should own all\r\nthe factories, mills, mines, farms, railways, fishing fleets, sheep\r\nfarms, poultry farms and cattle ranches.\r\n\r\n\'Under existing circumstances the community is degenerating mentally\r\nand physically because the majority cannot afford to have decent houses\r\nto live in.  Socialists say that the community should take in hand the\r\nbusiness of providing proper houses for all its members, that the State\r\nshould be the only landlord, that all the land and all the houses\r\nshould belong to the whole people...\r\n\r\n\'We must do this if we are to keep our old place in the van of human\r\nprogress.  A nation of ignorant, unintelligent, half-starved,\r\nbroken-spirited degenerates cannot hope to lead humanity in its\r\nnever-ceasing march onward to the conquest of the future.\r\n\r\n        \'Vain, mightiest fleet of iron framed;\r\n        Vain the all-shattering guns\r\n        Unless proud England keep, untamed,\r\n        The stout hearts of her sons.\r\n\r\n\'All the evils that I have referred to are only symptoms of the one\r\ndisease that is sapping the moral, mental and physical life of the\r\nnation, and all attempts to cure these symptoms are foredoomed to\r\nfailure, simply because they are the symptoms and not the disease. All\r\nthe talk of Temperance, and the attempts to compel temperance, are\r\nforedoomed to failure, because drunkenness is a symptom, and not the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\'India is a rich productive country.  Every year millions of pounds\r\nworth of wealth are produced by her people, only to be stolen from them\r\nby means of the Money Trick by the capitalist and official class. Her\r\nindustrious sons and daughters, who are nearly all total abstainers,\r\nlive in abject poverty, and their misery is not caused by laziness or\r\nwant of thrift, or by Intemperance.  They are poor for the same reason\r\nthat we are poor--Because we are Robbed.\r\n\r\n\'The hundreds of thousands of pounds that are yearly wasted in\r\nwell-meant but useless charity accomplish no lasting good, because\r\nwhile charity soothes the symptoms it ignores the disease, which\r\nis--the PRIVATE OWNERSHIP of the means of producing the necessaries of\r\nlife, and the restriction of production, by a few selfish individuals\r\nfor their own profit.  And for that disease there is no other remedy\r\nthan the one I have told you of--the PUBLIC OWNERSHIP and cultivation\r\nof the land, the PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF the mines, railways, canals,\r\nships, factories and all the other means of production, and the\r\nestablishment of an Industrial Civil Service--a National Army of\r\nIndustry--for the purpose of producing the necessaries, comforts and\r\nrefinements of life in that abundance which has been made possible by\r\nscience and machinery--for the use and benefit of THE WHOLE OF THE\r\nPEOPLE.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: and where\'s the money to come from for all this?\' shouted Crass,\r\nfiercely.\r\n\r\n\'Hear, hear,\' cried the man behind the moat.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no money difficulty about it,\' replied Barrington.  \'We can\r\neasily find all the money we shall need.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said Slyme, who had been reading the Daily Ananias,\r\n\'there\'s all the money in the Post Office Savings Bank.  The Socialists\r\ncould steal that for a start; and as for the mines and land and\r\nfactories, they can all be took from the owners by force.\'\r\n\r\n\'There will be no need for force and no need to steal anything from\r\nanybody.\'\r\n\r\n\'And there\'s another thing I objects to,\' said Crass.  \'And that\'s all\r\nthis \'ere talk about hignorance: wot about all the money wots spent\r\nevery year for edication?\'\r\n\r\n\'You should rather say--"What about all the money that\'s wasted every\r\nyear on education?"  What can be more brutal and senseless than trying\r\nto "educate" a poor little, hungry, ill-clad child?  Such so-called\r\n"instruction" is like the seed in the parable of the Sower, which fell\r\non stony ground and withered away because it had no depth of earth; and\r\neven in those cases where it does take root and grow, it becomes like\r\nthe seed that fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it,\r\nand it bore no fruit.\r\n\r\n\'The majority of us forget in a year or two all that we learnt at\r\nschool because the conditions of our lives are such as to destroy all\r\ninclination for culture or refinement.  We must see that the children\r\nare properly clothed and fed and that they are not made to get up in\r\nthe middle of the night to go to work for several hours before they go\r\nto school.  We must make it illegal for any greedy, heartless\r\nprofit-hunter to hire them and make them labour for several hours in\r\nthe evening after school, or all day and till nearly midnight on\r\nSaturday.  We must first see that our children are cared for, as well\r\nas the children of savage races, before we can expect a proper return\r\nfor the money that we spend on education.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind admitting that this \'ere scheme of national ownership and\r\nindustries is all right if it could only be done,\' said Harlow, \'but at\r\npresent, all the land, railways and factories, belongs to private\r\ncapitalists; they can\'t be bought without money, and you say you ain\'t\r\ngoin\' to take \'em away by force, so I should like to know how the\r\nbloody \'ell you are goin\' to get \'em?\'\r\n\r\n\'We certainly don\'t propose to buy them with money, for the simple\r\nreason that there is not sufficient money in existence to pay for them.\r\n\r\n\'If all the gold and silver money in the World were gathered together\r\ninto one heap, it would scarcely be sufficient to buy all the private\r\nproperty in England.  The people who own all these things now never\r\nreally paid for them with money--they obtained possession of them by\r\nmeans of the "Money Trick" which Owen explained to us some time ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'They obtained possession of them by usin\' their brain,\' said Crass.\r\n\'Exactly,\' replied the lecturer.  \'They tell us themselves that that is\r\nhow they got them away from us; they call their profits the "wages of\r\nintelligence".  Whilst we have been working, they have been using their\r\nintelligence in order to obtain possession of the things we have\r\ncreated.  The time has now arrived for us to use our intelligence in\r\norder to get back the things they have robbed us of, aid to prevent\r\nthem from robbing us any more.  As for how it is to be done, we might\r\ncopy the methods that they have found so successful.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, then you DO mean to rob them after all,\' cried Slyme,\r\ntriumphantly.  \'If it\'s true that they robbed the workers, and if we\'re\r\nto adopt the same method then we\'ll be robbers too!\'\r\n\r\n\'When a thief is caught having in his possession the property of others\r\nit is not robbery to take the things away from him and to restore them\r\nto their rightful owners,\' retorted Barrington.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t allow this \'ere disorder to go on no longer,\' shouted Philpot,\r\nbanging the table with the plumber\'s hammer as several men began\r\ntalking at the same time.\r\n\r\n\'There will be plenty of tuneropperty for questions and opposition at\r\nthe hend of the horation, when the pulpit will be throwed open to\r\nanyone as likes to debate the question.  I now calls upon the professor\r\nto proceed with the second part of the horation: and anyone wot\r\ninterrupts will get a lick under the ear-\'ole with this\'--waving the\r\nhammer--\'and the body will be chucked out of the bloody winder.\'\r\n\r\nLoud cheers greeted this announcement.  It was still raining heavily,\r\nso they thought they might as well pass the time listening to\r\nBarrington as in any other way.\r\n\r\n\'A large part of the land may be got back in the same way as it was\r\ntaken from us.  The ancestors of the present holders obtained\r\npossession of it by simply passing Acts of Enclosure: the nation should\r\nregain possession of those lands by passing Acts of Resumption. And\r\nwith regard to the other land, the present holders should be allowed to\r\nretain possession of it during their lives and then it should revert to\r\nthe State, to be used for the benefit of all. Britain should belong to\r\nthe British people, not to a few selfish individuals.  As for the\r\nrailways, they have already been nationalized in some other countries,\r\nand what other countries can do we can do also.  In New Zealand,\r\nAustralia, South Africa, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Japan and some other\r\ncountries some of the railways are already the property of the State.\r\nAs for the method by which we can obtain possession of them, the\r\ndifficulty is not to discover a method, but rather to decide which of\r\nmany methods we shall adopt.  One method would be to simply pass an Act\r\ndeclaring that as it was contrary to the public interest that they\r\nshould be owned by private individuals, the railways would henceforth\r\nbe the property of the nation.  All railways servants, managers and\r\nofficials would continue in their employment; the only difference being\r\nthat they would now be in the employ of the State.  As to the\r\nshareholders--\'\r\n\r\n\'They could all be knocked on the \'ead, I suppose,\' interrupted Crass.\r\n\r\n\'Or go to the workhouse,\' said Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'Or to \'ell,\' suggested the man behind the moat.\r\n\r\n\'--The State would continue to pay to the shareholders the same\r\ndividends they had received on an average for, say, the previous three\r\nyears.  These payments would be continued to the present shareholders\r\nfor life, or the payments might be limited to a stated number of years\r\nand the shares would be made non-transferable, like the railway tickets\r\nof today. As for the factories, shops, and other means of production\r\nand distribution, the State must adopt the same methods of doing\r\nbusiness as the present owners.  I mean that even as the big Trusts and\r\ncompanies are crushing--by competition--the individual workers and\r\nsmall traders, so the State should crush the trusts by competition.  It\r\nis surely justifiable for the State to do for the benefit of the whole\r\npeople that which the capitalists are already doing for the profit of a\r\nfew shareholders. The first step in this direction will be the\r\nestablishment of Retail Stores for the purpose of supplying all\r\nnational and municipal employees with the necessaries of life at the\r\nlowest possible prices.  At first the Administration will purchase\r\nthese things from the private manufacturers, in such large quantities\r\nthat it will be able to obtain them at the very cheapest rate, and as\r\nthere will be no heavy rents to pay for showy shops, and no advertising\r\nexpenses, and as the object of the Administration will be not to make\r\nprofit, but to supply its workmen and officials with goods at the\r\nlowest price, they will be able to sell them much cheaper than the\r\nprofit-making private stores.\r\n\r\n\'The National Service Retail Stores will be for the benefit of only\r\nthose in the public service; and gold, silver or copper money will not\r\nbe accepted in payment for the things sold.  At first, all public\r\nservants will continue to be paid in metal money, but those who desire\r\nit will be paid all or part of their wages in paper money of the same\r\nnominal value, which will be accepted in payment for their purchases at\r\nthe National Stores and at the National Hotels, Restaurants and other\r\nplaces which will be established for the convenience of those in the\r\nState service.  The money will resemble bank-notes.  It will be made of\r\na special very strong paper, and will be of all value, from a penny to\r\na pound.\r\n\r\n\'As the National Service Stores will sell practically everything that\r\ncould be obtained elsewhere, and as twenty shillings in paper money\r\nwill be able to purchase much more at the stores than twenty shillings\r\nof metal money would purchase anywhere else, it will not be long before\r\nnearly all public servants will prefer to be paid in paper money.  As\r\nfar as paying the salaries and wages of most of its officials and\r\nworkmen is concerned, the Administration will not then have any need of\r\nmetal money.  But it will require metal money to pay the private\r\nmanufacturers who supply the goods sold in the National Stores.\r\nBut--all these things are made by labour; so in order to avoid having\r\nto pay metal money for them, the State will now commence to employ\r\nproductive labour.  All the public land suitable for the purpose will\r\nbe put into cultivation and State factories will be established for\r\nmanufacturing food, boots, clothing, furniture and all other\r\nnecessaries and comforts of life.  All those who are out of employment\r\nand willing to work, will be given employment on these farms and in\r\nthese factories.  In order that the men employed shall not have to work\r\nunpleasantly hard, and that their hours of labour may be as short as\r\npossible--at first, say, eight hours per day--and also to make sure\r\nthat the greatest possible quantity of everything shall be produced,\r\nthese factories and farms will be equipped with the most up-to-date and\r\nefficient labour-saving machinery.  The people employed in the farms\r\nand factories will be paid with paper money... The commodities they\r\nproduce will go to replenish the stocks of the National Service Stores,\r\nwhere the workers will be able to purchase with their paper money\r\neverything they need.\r\n\r\n\'As we shall employ the greatest possible number of labour-saving\r\nmachines, and adopt the most scientific methods in our farms and\r\nfactories, the quantities of goods we shall be able to produce will be\r\nso enormous that we shall be able to pay our workers very high\r\nwages--in paper money--and we shall be able to sell our produce so\r\ncheaply, that all public servants will be able to enjoy abundance of\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n\'When the workers who are being exploited and sweated by the private\r\ncapitalists realize how much worse off they are than the workers in the\r\nemploy of the State, they will come and ask to be allowed to work for\r\nthe State, and also, for paper money.  That will mean that the State\r\nArmy of Productive Workers will be continually increasing in numbers.\r\nMore State factories will be built, more land will be put into\r\ncultivation.  Men will be given employment making bricks, woodwork,\r\npaints, glass, wallpapers and all kinds of building materials and\r\nothers will be set to work building--on State land--beautiful houses,\r\nwhich will be let to those employed in the service of the State.  The\r\nrent will be paid with paper money.\r\n\r\n\'State fishing fleets will be established and the quantities of\r\ncommodities of all kinds produced will be so great that the State\r\nemployees and officials will not be able to use it all.  With their\r\npaper money they will be able to buy enough and more than enough to\r\nsatisfy all their needs abundantly, but there will still be a great and\r\ncontinuously increasing surplus stock in the possession of the State.\r\n\r\n\'The Socialist Administration will now acquire or build fleets of steam\r\ntrading vessels, which will of course be manned and officered by State\r\nemployees--the same as the Royal Navy is now.  These fleets of National\r\ntrading vessels will carry the surplus stocks I have mentioned, to\r\nforeign countries, and will there sell or exchange them for some of the\r\nproducts of those countries, things that we do not produce ourselves.\r\nThese things will be brought to England and sold at the National\r\nService Stores, at the lowest possible price, for paper money, to those\r\nin the service of the State.  This of course will only have the effect\r\nof introducing greater variety into the stocks--it will not diminish\r\nthe surplus: and as there would be no sense in continuing to produce\r\nmore of these things than necessary, it would then be the duty of the\r\nAdministration to curtail or restrict production of the necessaries of\r\nlife.  This could be done by reducing the hours of the workers without\r\nreducing their wages so as to enable them to continue to purchase as\r\nmuch as before.\r\n\r\n\'Another way of preventing over production of mere necessaries and\r\ncomforts will be to employ a large number of workers producing the\r\nrefinements and pleasures of life, more artistic houses, furniture,\r\npictures, musical instruments and so forth.\r\n\r\n\'In the centre of every district a large Institute or pleasure house\r\ncould be erected, containing a magnificently appointed and decorated\r\ntheatre; Concert Hall, Lecture Hall, Gymnasium, Billiard Rooms, Reading\r\nRooms, Refreshment Rooms, and so on.  A detachment of the Industrial\r\nArmy would be employed as actors, artistes, musicians, singers and\r\nentertainers.  In fact everyone that could be spared from the most\r\nimportant work of all--that of producing the necessaries of life--would\r\nbe employed in creating pleasure, culture, and education. All these\r\npeople--like the other branches of the public service--would be paid\r\nwith paper money, and with it all of them would be able to purchase\r\nabundance of all those things which constitute civilization.\r\n\r\n\'Meanwhile, as a result of all this, the kind-hearted private employers\r\nand capitalists would find that no one would come and work for them to\r\nbe driven and bullied and sweated for a miserable trifle of metal money\r\nthat is scarcely enough to purchase sufficient of the necessaries of\r\nlife to keep body and soul together.\r\n\r\n\'These kind-hearted capitalists will protest against what they will\r\ncall the unfair competition of State industry, and some of them may\r\nthreaten to leave the country and take their capital with them...  As\r\nmost of these persons are too lazy to work, and as we will not need\r\ntheir money, we shall be very glad to see them go.  But with regard to\r\ntheir real capital--their factories, farms, mines or machinery--that\r\nwill be a different matter...  To allow these things to remain idle and\r\nunproductive would constitute an injury to the community.  So a law\r\nwill be passed, declaring that all land not cultivated by the owner, or\r\nany factory shut down for more than a specified time, will be taken\r\npossession of by the State and worked for the benefit of the\r\ncommunity...  Fair compensation will be paid in paper money to the\r\nformer owners, who will be granted an income or pension of so much a\r\nyear either for life or for a stated period according to circumstances\r\nand the ages of the persons concerned.\r\n\r\n\'As for the private traders, the wholesale and retail dealers in the\r\nthings produced by labour, they will be forced by the State competition\r\nto close down their shops and warehouses--first, because they will not\r\nbe able to replenish their stocks; and, secondly, because even if they\r\nwere able to do so, they would not be able to sell them.  This will\r\nthrow out of work a great host of people who are at present engaged in\r\nuseless occupations; the managers and assistants in the shops of which\r\nwe now see half a dozen of the same sort in a single street; the\r\nthousands of men and women who are slaving away their lives producing\r\nadvertisements, for, in most cases, a miserable pittance of metal\r\nmoney, with which many of them are unable to procure sufficient of the\r\nnecessaries of life to secure them from starvation.\r\n\r\n\'The masons, carpenters, painters, glaziers, and all the others engaged\r\nin maintaining these unnecessary stores and shops will all be thrown\r\nout of employment, but all of them who are willing to work will be\r\nwelcomed by the State and will be at once employed helping either to\r\nproduce or distribute the necessaries and comforts of life.  They will\r\nhave to work fewer hours than before...  They will not have to work so\r\nhard--for there will be no need to drive or bully, because there will\r\nbe plenty of people to do the work, and most of it will be done by\r\nmachinery--and with their paper money they will be able to buy\r\nabundance of the things they help to produce.  The shops and stores\r\nwhere these people were formerly employed will be acquired by the\r\nState, which will pay the former owners fair compensation in the same\r\nmanner as to the factory owners.  Some of the buildings will be\r\nutilized by the State as National Service Stores, others transformed\r\ninto factories and others will be pulled down to make room for\r\ndwellings, or public buildings...  It will be the duty of the\r\nGovernment to build a sufficient number of houses to accommodate the\r\nfamilies of all those in its employment, and as a consequence of this\r\nand because of the general disorganization and decay of what is now\r\ncalled "business", all other house property of all kinds will rapidly\r\ndepreciate in value.  The slums and the wretched dwellings now occupied\r\nby the working classes--the miserable, uncomfortable, jerry-built\r\n"villas" occupied by the lower middle classes and by "business" people,\r\nwill be left empty and valueless upon the hands of their rack renting\r\nlandlords, who will very soon voluntarily offer to hand them and the\r\nground they stand upon to the state on the same terms as those accorded\r\nto the other property owners, namely--in return for a pension.  Some of\r\nthese people will be content to live in idleness on the income allowed\r\nthem for life as compensation by the State: others will devote\r\nthemselves to art or science and some others will offer their services\r\nto the community as managers and superintendents, and the State will\r\nalways be glad to employ all those who are willing to help in the Great\r\nWork of production and distribution.\r\n\r\n\'By this time the nation will be the sole employer of labour, and as no\r\none will be able to procure the necessaries of life without paper\r\nmoney, and as the only way to obtain this will be working, it will mean\r\nthat every mentally and physically capable person in the community will\r\nbe helping in the great work of PRODUCTION and DISTRIBUTION.  We shall\r\nnot need as at present, to maintain a police force to protect the\r\nproperty of the idle rich from the starving wretches whom they have\r\nrobbed.  There will be no unemployed and no overlapping of labour,\r\nwhich will be organized and concentrated for the accomplishment of the\r\nonly rational object--the creation of the things we require...  For\r\nevery one labour-saving machine in use today, we will, if necessary,\r\nemploy a thousand machines! and consequently there will be produced\r\nsuch a stupendous, enormous, prodigious, overwhelming abundance of\r\neverything that soon the Community will be faced once more with the\r\nserious problem of OVER-PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\'To deal with this, it will be necessary to reduce the hours of our\r\nworkers to four or five hours a day...  All young people will be\r\nallowed to continue at public schools and universities and will not be\r\nrequired to take any part in the work or the nation until they are\r\ntwenty-one years of age.  At the age of forty-five, everyone will be\r\nallowed to retire from the State service on full pay...  All these will\r\nbe able to spend the rest of their days according to their own\r\ninclinations; some will settle down quietly at home, and amuse\r\nthemselves in the same ways as people of wealth and leisure do at the\r\npresent day--with some hobby, or by taking part in the organization of\r\nsocial functions, such as balls, parties, entertainments, the\r\norganization of Public Games and Athletic Tournaments, Races and all\r\nkinds of sports.\r\n\r\n\'Some will prefer to continue in the service of the State.  Actors,\r\nartists, sculptors, musicians and others will go on working for their\r\nown pleasure and honour...  Some will devote their leisure to science,\r\nart, or literature.  Others will prefer to travel on the State\r\nsteamships to different parts of the world to see for themselves all\r\nthose things of which most of us have now but a dim and vague\r\nconception.  The wonders of India and Egypt, the glories of Rome, the\r\nartistic treasures of the continent and the sublime scenery of other\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n\'Thus--for the first time in the history of humanity--the benefits and\r\npleasures conferred upon mankind by science and civilization will be\r\nenjoyed equally by all, upon the one condition, that they shall do\r\ntheir share of the work, that is necessary in order to, make all these\r\nthings possible.\r\n\r\n\'These are the principles upon which the CO-OPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH of\r\nthe future will be organized.  The State in which no one will be\r\ndistinguished or honoured above his fellows except for Virtue or\r\nTalent.  Where no man will find his profit in another\'s loss, and we\r\nshall no longer be masters and servants, but brothers, free men, and\r\nfriends.  Where there will be no weary, broken men and women passing\r\ntheir joyless lives in toil and want, and no little children crying\r\nbecause they are hungry or cold.\r\n\r\n\'A State wherein it will be possible to put into practice the teachings\r\nof Him whom so many now pretend to follow.  A society which shall have\r\njustice and co-operation for its foundation, and International\r\nBrotherhood and love for its law.\r\n\r\n        \'Such are the days that shall be! but\r\n        What are the deeds of today,\r\n        In the days of the years we dwell in,\r\n        That wear our lives away?\r\n        Why, then, and for what we are waiting?\r\n        There are but three words to speak\r\n        "We will it," and what is the foreman\r\n        but the dream strong wakened and weak?\r\n        \'Oh, why and for what are we waiting, while\r\n        our brothers droop and die?\r\n        And on every wind of the heavens, a\r\n        wasted life goes by.\r\n        \'How long shall they reproach us, where\r\n        crowd on crowd they dwell\r\n        Poor ghosts of the wicked city,\r\n        gold crushed, hungry hell?\r\n        \'Through squalid life they laboured in\r\n        sordid grief they died\r\n        Those sons of a mighty mother, those\r\n        props of England\'s pride.\r\n        They are gone, there is none can undo\r\n        it, nor save our souls from the curse,\r\n        But many a million cometh, and shall\r\n        they be better or worse?\r\n\r\n        \'It is We must answer and hasten and open wide the door,\r\n        For the rich man\'s hurrying terror, and the slow foot hope of\r\n        the poor,\r\n        Yea, the voiceless wrath of the wretched and their unlearned\r\n        discontent,\r\n        We must give it voice and wisdom, till the waiting tide be\r\n        spent\r\n        Come then since all things call us, the living and the dead,\r\n        And o\'er the weltering tangle a glimmering light is shed.\'\r\n\r\nAs Barrington descended from the Pulpit and walked back to his\r\naccustomed seat, a loud shout of applause burst from a few men in the\r\ncrowd, who stood up and waved their caps and cheered again and again.\r\nWhen order was restored, Philpot rose and addressed the meeting:\r\n\r\n\'Is there any gentleman wot would like to ask the Speaker a question?\'\r\n\r\nNo one spoke and the Chairman again put the question without obtaining\r\nany response, but at length one of the new hands who had been \'taken\r\non\' about a week previously to replace another painter who had been\r\nsacked for being too slow--stood up and said there was one point that\r\nhe would like a little more information about.  This man had two\r\npatches on the seat of his trousers, which were also very much frayed\r\nand ragged at the bottoms of the legs: the lining of his coat was all\r\nin rags, as were also the bottoms of the sleeves; his boots were old\r\nand had been many times mended and patched; the sole of one of them had\r\nbegun to separate from the upper and he had sewn these parts together\r\nwith a few stitches of copper wire.  He had been out of employment for\r\nseveral weeks and it was evident from the pinched expression of his\r\nstill haggard face that during that time he had not had sufficient to\r\neat.  This man was not a drunkard, neither was he one of those\r\nsemi-mythical persons who are too lazy to work.  He was married and had\r\nseveral children.  One of them, a boy of fourteen years old, earned\r\nfive shillings a week as a light porter at a Grocer\'s.\r\n\r\nBeing a householder the man had a vote, but he had never hitherto taken\r\nmuch interest in what he called \'politics\'.  In his opinion, those\r\nmatters were not for the likes of him.  He believed in leaving such\r\ndifficult subjects to be dealt with by his betters.  In his present\r\nunhappy condition he was a walking testimonial to the wisdom and virtue\r\nand benevolence of those same \'betters\' who have hitherto managed the\r\naffairs of the world with results so very satisfactory for themselves.\r\n\r\n\'I should like to ask the speaker,\' he said, \'supposin\' all this that\r\n\'e talks about is done--what\'s to become of the King, and the Royal\r\nFamily, and all the Big Pots?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' cried Crass, eagerly--and Ned Dawson and the man behind\r\nthe moat both said that that was what they would like to know, too.\r\n\r\n\'I am much more concerned about what is to become of ourselves if these\r\nthings are not done,\' replied Barrington.  \'I think we should try to\r\ncultivate a little more respect of our own families and to concern\r\nourselves a little less about "Royal" Families.  I fail to see any\r\nreason why we should worry ourselves about those people; they\'re all\r\nright--they have all they need, and as far as I am aware, nobody wishes\r\nto harm them and they are well able to look after themselves. They will\r\nfare the same as the other rich people.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to ask,\' said Harlow, \'wot\'s to become of all the gold\r\nand silver and copper money?  Wouldn\'t it be of no use at all?\'\r\n\r\n\'It would be of far more use under Socialism than it is at present. The\r\nState would of course become possessed of a large quantity of it in the\r\nearly stages of the development of the Socialist system, because--at\r\nfirst--while the State would be paying all its officers and productive\r\nworkers in paper, the rest of the community--those not in State\r\nemploy--would be paying their taxes in gold as at present. All\r\ntravellers on the State railways--other than State employees--would pay\r\ntheir fares in metal money, and gold and silver would pour into the\r\nState Treasury from many other sources.  The State would receive gold\r\nand silver and--for the most part--pay out paper.  By the time the\r\nsystem of State employment was fully established, gold and silver would\r\nonly be of value as metal and the State would purchase it from whoever\r\npossessed and wished to sell it--at so much per pound as raw material:\r\ninstead of hiding it away in the vaults of banks, or locking it up in\r\niron safes, we shall make use of it.  Some of the gold will be\r\nmanufactured into articles of jewellery, to be sold for paper money and\r\nworn by the sweethearts and wives and daughters of the workers; some of\r\nit will be beaten out into gold leaf to be used in the decoration of\r\nthe houses of the citizens and of public buildings.  As for the silver,\r\nit will be made into various articles of utility for domestic use.  The\r\nworkers will not then, as now, have to eat their food with poisonous\r\nlead or brass spoons and forks, we shall have these things of silver\r\nand if there is not enough silver we shall probably have a\r\nnon-poisonous alloy of that metal.\'\r\n\r\n\'As far as I can make out,\' said Harlow, \'the paper money will be just\r\nas valuable as gold and silver is now.  Well, wot\'s to prevent artful\r\ndodgers like old Misery and Rushton saving it up and buying and selling\r\nthings with it, and so livin\' without work?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said Crass, scornfully.  \'It would never do!\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a very simple matter; any man who lives without doing any\r\nuseful work is living on the labour of others, he is robbing others of\r\npart of the result of their labour.  The object of Socialism is to stop\r\nthis robbery, to make it impossible.  So no one will be able to hoard\r\nup or accumulate the paper money because it will be dated, and will\r\nbecome worthless if it is not spent within a certain time after its\r\nissue.  As for buying and selling for profit--from whom would they buy?\r\nAnd to whom would they sell?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, they might buy some of the things the workers didn\'t want, for\r\nless than the workers paid for them, and then they could sell \'em\r\nagain.\'\r\n\r\n\'They\'d have to sell them for less than the price charged at the\r\nNational Stores, and if you think about it a little you\'ll see that it\r\nwould not be very profitable.  It would be with the object of\r\npreventing any attempts at private trading that the Administration\r\nwould refuse to pay compensation to private owners in a lump sum.  All\r\nsuch compensations would be paid, as I said, in the form of a pension\r\nof so much per year.\r\n\r\n\'Another very effective way to prevent private trading would be to make\r\nit a criminal offence against the well-being of the community. At\r\npresent many forms of business are illegal unless you take out a\r\nlicence; under Socialism no one would be allowed to trade without a\r\nlicence, and no licences would be issued.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wouldn\'t a man be allowed to save up his money if he wanted to,\r\ndemanded Slyme with indignation.\r\n\r\n\'There will be nothing to prevent a man going without some of the\r\nthings he might have if he is foolish enough to do so, but he would\r\nnever be able to save up enough to avoid doing his share of useful\r\nservice.  Besides, what need would there be for anyone to save?  One\'s\r\nold age would be provided for.  No one could ever be out of employment.\r\nIf one was ill the State hospitals and Medical Service would be free.\r\nAs for one\'s children, they would attend the State Free Schools and\r\nColleges and when of age they would enter the State Service, their\r\nfutures provided for.  Can you tell us why anyone would need or wish to\r\nsave?\'\r\n\r\nSlyme couldn\'t.\r\n\r\n\'Are there any more questions?\' demanded Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'While we are speaking of money,\' added Barrington, \'I should like to\r\nremind you that even under the present system there are many things\r\nwhich cost money to maintain, that we enjoy without having to pay for\r\ndirectly.  The public roads and pavements cost money to make and\r\nmaintain and light.  So do the parks, museums and bridges.  But they\r\nare free to all.  Under a Socialist Administration this principle will\r\nbe extended--in addition to the free services we enjoy now we shall\r\nthen maintain the trains and railways for the use of the public, free.\r\nAnd as time goes on, this method of doing business will be adopted in\r\nmany other directions.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve read somewhere,\' said Harlow, \'that whenever a Government in any\r\ncountry has started issuing paper money it has always led to\r\nbankruptcy.  How do you know that the same thing would not happen under\r\na Socialist Administration?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' said Crass.  \'I was just goin\' to say the same thing.\'\r\n\r\n\'If the Government of a country began to issue large amounts of paper\r\nmoney under the present system,\' Barrington replied, \'it would\r\ninevitably lead to bankruptcy, for the simple reason that paper money\r\nunder the present system--bank-notes, bank drafts, postal orders,\r\ncheques or any other form--is merely a printed promise to pay the\r\namount--in gold or silver--on demand or at a certain date.  Under the\r\npresent system if a Government issues more paper money than it\r\npossesses gold and silver to redeem, it is of course bankrupt.  But the\r\npaper money that will be issued under a Socialist Administration will\r\nnot be a promise to pay in gold or silver on demand or at any time.  It\r\nwill be a promise to supply commodities to the amount specified on the\r\nnote, and as there could be no dearth of those things there could be no\r\npossibility of bankruptcy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to know who\'s goin\' to appoint the hofficers of this\r\n\'ere hindustrial harmy,\' said the man on the pail.  \'We don\'t want to\r\nbe bullied and chivied and chased about by a lot of sergeants and\r\ncorporals like a lot of soldiers, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' said Crass.  \'You must \'ave some masters.  Someone\'s got\r\nto be in charge of the work.\'\r\n\r\n\'We don\'t have to put up with any bullying or chivying or chasing now,\r\ndo we?\' said Barrington.  \'So of course we could not have anything of\r\nthat sort under Socialism.  We could not put up with it at all!  Even\r\nif it were only for four or five hours a day.  Under the present system\r\nwe have no voice in appointing our masters and overseers and\r\nforemen--we have no choice as to what master we shall work under.  If\r\nour masters do not treat us fairly we have no remedy against them.\r\nUnder Socialism it will be different; the workers will be part of the\r\ncommunity; the officers or managers and foremen will be the servants of\r\nthe community, and if any one of these men were to abuse his position\r\nhe could be promptly removed.  As for the details of the organization\r\nof the Industrial Army, the difficulty is, again, not so much to devise\r\na way, but to decide which of many ways would be the best, and the\r\nperfect way will probably be developed only after experiment and\r\nexperience.  The one thing we have to hold fast to is the fundamental\r\nprinciple of State employment or National service. Production for use\r\nand not for profit.  The national organization of industry under\r\ndemocratic control.  One way of arranging this business would be for\r\nthe community to elect a Parliament in much the same way as is done at\r\npresent.  The only persons eligible for election to be veterans of the\r\nindustrial Army, men and women who had put in their twenty-five years\r\nof service.\r\n\r\n\'This Administrative Body would have control of the different State\r\nDepartments.  There would be a Department of Agriculture, a Department\r\nof Railways and so on, each with its minister and staff.\r\n\r\n\'All these Members of Parliament would be the relatives--in some cases\r\nthe mothers and fathers of those in the Industrial Service, and they\r\nwould be relied upon to see that the conditions of that service were\r\nthe best possible.\r\n\r\n\'As for the different branches of the State Service, they could be\r\norganized on somewhat the same lines as the different branches of the\r\nPublic Service are now--like the Navy, the Post Office and as the State\r\nRailways in some other countries, or as are the different branches of\r\nthe Military Army, with the difference that all promotions will be from\r\nthe ranks, by examinations, and by merit only.  As every recruit will\r\nhave had the same class of education they will all have absolute\r\nequality of opportunity and the men who would attain to positions of\r\nauthority would be the best men, and not as at present, the worst.\'\r\n\r\n\'How do you make that out?\' demanded Crass.\r\n\r\n\'Under the present system, the men who become masters and employers\r\nsucceed because they are cunning and selfish, not because they\r\nunderstand or are capable of doing the work out of which they make\r\ntheir money.  Most of the employers in the building trade for instance\r\nwould be incapable of doing any skilled work.  Very few of them would\r\nbe worth their salt as journeymen.  The only work they do is to scheme\r\nto reap the benefit of the labour of others.\r\n\r\n\'The men who now become managers and foremen are selected not because\r\nof their ability as craftsmen, but because they are good slave-drivers\r\nand useful producers of profit for their employers.\'\r\n\r\n\'How are you goin\' to prevent the selfish and cunnin\', as you call \'em,\r\nfrom gettin\' on top THEN as they do now?\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'The fact that all workers will receive the same pay, no matter what\r\nclass of work they are engaged in, or what their position, will ensure\r\nour getting the very best man to do all the higher work and to organize\r\nour business.\'\r\n\r\nCrass laughed: \'What!  Everybody to get the same wages?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: there will be such an enormous quantity of everything produced,\r\nthat their wages will enable everyone to purchase abundance of\r\neverything they require.  Even if some were paid more than others they\r\nwould not be able to spend it.  There would be no need to save it, and\r\nas there will be no starving poor, there will be no one to give it away\r\nto.  If it were possible to save and accumulate money it would bring\r\ninto being an idle class, living on their fellows: it would lead to the\r\ndownfall of our system, and a return to the same anarchy that exists at\r\npresent.  Besides, if higher wages were paid to those engaged in the\r\nhigher work or occupying positions of authority it would prevent our\r\ngetting the best men.  Unfit persons would try for the positions\r\nbecause of the higher pay.  That is what happens now. Under the present\r\nsystem men intrigue for and obtain or are pitchforked into positions\r\nfor which they have no natural ability at all; the only reason they\r\ndesire these positions is because of the salaries attached to them.\r\nThese fellows get the money and the work is done by underpaid\r\nsubordinates whom the world never hears of. Under Socialism, this money\r\nincentive will be done away with, and consequently the only men who\r\nwill try for these positions will be those who, being naturally fitted\r\nfor the work, would like to do it. For instance a man who is a born\r\norganizer will not refuse to undertake such work because he will not be\r\npaid more for it.  Such a man will desire to do it and will esteem it a\r\nprivilege to be allowed to do it.  He will revel in it.  To think out\r\nall the details of some undertaking, to plan and scheme and organize,\r\nis not work for a man like that.  It is a pleasure.  But for a man who\r\nhas sought and secured such a position, not because he liked the work,\r\nbut because he liked the salary--such work as this would be unpleasant\r\nlabour. Under Socialism the unfit man would not apply for that post but\r\nwould strive after some other for which he was fit and which he would\r\ntherefore desire and enjoy.  There are some men who would rather have\r\ncharge of and organize and be responsible for work than do it with\r\ntheir hands.  There are others who would rather do delicate or\r\ndifficult or artistic work, than plain work.  A man who is a born\r\nartist would rather paint a frieze or a picture or carve a statue than\r\nhe would do plain work, or take charge of and direct the labour of\r\nothers.  And there are another sort of men who would rather do ordinary\r\nplain work than take charge, or attempt higher branches for which they\r\nhave neither liking or natural talent.\r\n\r\n\'But there is one thing--a most important point that you seem to\r\nentirely lose sight of, and that is, that all these different kinds and\r\nclasses are equal in one respect--THEY ARE ALL EQUALLY NECESSARY. Each\r\nis a necessary and indispensable part of the whole; therefore everyone\r\nwho has done his full share of necessary work is justly entitled to a\r\nfull share of the results.  The men who put the slates on are just as\r\nindispensable as the men who lay the foundations.  The work of the men\r\nwho build the walls and make the doors is just as necessary as the work\r\nof the men who decorate the cornice.  None of them would be of much use\r\nwithout the architect, and the plans of the architect would come to\r\nnothing, his building would be a mere castle in the air, if it were not\r\nfor the other workers.  Each part of the work is equally necessary,\r\nuseful and indispensable if the building is to be perfected.  Some of\r\nthese men work harder with their brains than with their hands and some\r\nwork harder with their hands than with their brains, BUT EACH ONE DOES\r\nHIS FULL SHARE OF THE WORK.  This truth will be recognized and acted\r\nupon by those who build up and maintain the fabric of our Co-operative\r\nCommonwealth.  Every man who does his full share of the useful and\r\nnecessary work according to his abilities shall have his full share of\r\nthe total result.  Herein will be its great difference from the present\r\nsystem, under which it is possible for the cunning and selfish ones to\r\ntake advantage of the simplicity of others and rob them of part of the\r\nfruits of their labour.  As for those who will be engaged in the higher\r\nbranches, they will be sufficiently rewarded by being privileged to do\r\nthe work they are fitted for and enjoy.  The only men and women who are\r\ncapable of good and great work of any kind are those who, being\r\nnaturally fit for it, love the work for its own sake and not for the\r\nmoney it brings them. Under the present system, many men who have no\r\nneed of money produce great works, not for gain but for pleasure: their\r\nwealth enables them to follow their natural inclinations.  Under the\r\npresent system many men and women capable of great works are prevented\r\nfrom giving expression to their powers by poverty and lack of\r\nopportunity: they live in sorrow and die heartbroken, and the community\r\nis the loser. These are the men and women who will be our artists,\r\nsculptors, architects, engineers and captains of industry.\r\n\r\n\'Under the present system there are men at the head of affairs whose\r\nonly object is the accumulation of money.  Some of them possess great\r\nabilities and the system has practically compelled them to employ those\r\nabilities for their own selfish ends to the hurt of the community.\r\nSome of them have built up great fortunes out of the sweat and blood\r\nand tears of men and women and little children.  For those who delight\r\nin such work as this, there will be no place in our Co-operative\r\nCommonwealth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is there any more questions?\' demanded Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Harlow.  \'If there won\'t be no extry pay and if anybody\r\nwill have all they need for just doing their part of the work, what\r\nencouragement will there be for anyone to worry his brains out trying\r\nto invent some new machine, or make some new discovery?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Barrington, \'I think that\'s covered by the last answer,\r\nbut if it were found necessary--which is highly improbable--to offer\r\nsome material reward in addition to the respect, esteem or honour that\r\nwould be enjoyed by the author of an invention that was a boon to the\r\ncommunity, it could be arranged by allowing him to retire before the\r\nexpiration of his twenty-five years service.  The boon he had conferred\r\non the community by the invention, would be considered equivalent to so\r\nmany years work.  But a man like that would not desire to cease\r\nworking; that sort go on working all their lives, for love.  There\'s\r\nEdison for instance.  He is one of the very few inventors who have made\r\nmoney out of their work; he is a rich man, but the only use his wealth\r\nseems to be to him is to procure himself facilities for going on with\r\nhis work; his life is a round of what some people would call painful\r\nlabour: but it is not painful labour to him; it\'s just pleasure, he\r\nworks for the love of it.  Another way would be to absolve a man of\r\nthat sort from the necessity of ordinary work, so as to give him a\r\nchance to get on with other inventions.  It would be to the interests\r\nof the community to encourage him in every way and to place materials\r\nand facilities at his disposal.\r\n\r\n\'But you must remember that even under the present system, Honour and\r\nPraise are held to be greater than money.  How many soldiers would\r\nprefer money to the honour of wearing the intrinsically valueless\r\nVictoria Cross?\r\n\r\n\'Even now men think less of money than they do of the respect, esteem\r\nor honour they are able to procure with it.  Many men spend the greater\r\npart of their lives striving to accumulate money, and when they have\r\nsucceeded, they proceed to spend it to obtain the respect of their\r\nfellow-men.  Some of them spend thousands of pounds for the honour of\r\nbeing able to write "MP" after their names.  Others buy titles.  Others\r\npay huge sums to gain admission to exclusive circles of society.\r\nOthers give the money away in charity, or found libraries or\r\nuniversities.  The reason they do these things is that they desire to\r\nbe applauded and honoured by their fellow-men.\r\n\r\n\'This desire is strongest in the most capable men--the men of genius.\r\nTherefore, under Socialism the principal incentive to great work will\r\nbe the same as now--Honour and Praise.  But, under the present system,\r\nHonour and Praise can be bought with money, and it does not matter much\r\nhow the money was obtained.\r\n\r\n\'Under Socialism it will be different.  The Cross of Honour and the\r\nLaurel Crown will not be bought and sold for filthy lucre.  They will\r\nbe the supreme rewards of Virtue and of Talent.\'\r\n\r\n\'Anyone else like to be flattened Out?\' inquired Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'What would you do with them what spends all their money in drink?\'\r\nasked Slyme.\r\n\r\n\'I might reasonably ask you, "What\'s done with them or what you propose\r\nto do with them now?"  There are many men and women whose lives are so\r\nfull of toil and sorrow and the misery caused by abject poverty, who\r\nare so shut out from all that makes life worth living, that the time\r\nthey spend in the public house is the only ray of sunshine in their\r\ncheerless lives.  Their mental and material poverty is so great that\r\nthey are deprived of and incapable of understanding the intellectual\r\nand social pleasures of civilization...  Under Socialism there will be\r\nno such class as this.  Everyone will be educated, and social life and\r\nrational pleasure will be within the reach of all.  Therefore we do not\r\nbelieve that there will be such a class.  Any individuals who abandoned\r\nthemselves to such a course would be avoided by their fellows; but if\r\nthey became very degraded, we should still remember that they were our\r\nbrother men and women, and we should regard them as suffering from a\r\ndisease inherited from their uncivilized forefathers and try to cure\r\nthem by placing them under some restraint: in an institute for\r\ninstance.\'\r\n\r\n\'Another good way to deal with \'em,\' said Harlow, \'would be to allow\r\nthem double pay, so as they could drink themselves to death.  We could\r\ndo without the likes of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Call the next case,\' said Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'This \'ere abundance that you\'re always talking about,\' said Crass, you\r\ncan\'t be sure that it would be possible to produce all that. You\'re\r\nonly assoomin\' that it could be done.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington pointed to the still visible outlines of the \'Hoblong\' that\r\nOwen had drawn on the wall to illustrate a previous lecture.\r\n\r\n\'Even under the present silly system of restricted production, with the\r\nmajority of the population engaged in useless, unproductive,\r\nunnecessary work, and large numbers never doing any work at all, there\r\nis enough produced to go all round after a fashion.  More than enough,\r\nfor in consequence of what they call "Over-Production", the markets are\r\nperiodically glutted with commodities of all kinds, and then for a time\r\nthe factories are closed and production ceases.  And yet we can all\r\nmanage to exist--after a fashion.  This proves that if productive\r\nindustry were organized on the lines advocated by Socialists there\r\ncould be produced such a prodigious quantity of everything, that\r\neveryone could live in plenty and comfort.  The problem of how to\r\nproduce sufficient for all to enjoy abundance is already solved: the\r\nproblem that then remains is--How to get rid of those whose greed and\r\ncallous indifference to the sufferings of others, prevents it being\r\ndone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes! and you\'ll never be able to get rid of \'em, mate,\' cried Crass,\r\ntriumphantly--and the man with the copper wire stitches in his boot\r\nsaid that it couldn\'t be done.\r\n\r\n\'Well, we mean to have a good try, anyhow,\' said Barrington.\r\n\r\nCrass and most of the others tried hard to think of something to say in\r\ndefence of the existing state of affairs, or against the proposals put\r\nforward by the lecturer; but finding nothing, they maintained a sullen\r\nand gloomy silence.  The man with the copper wire stitches in his boot\r\nin particular appeared to be very much upset; perhaps he was afraid\r\nthat if the things advocated by the speaker ever came to pass he would\r\nnot have any boots at all.  To assume that he had some such thought as\r\nthis, is the only rational way to account for his hostility, for in his\r\ncase no change could have been for the worse unless it reduced him to\r\nalmost absolute nakedness and starvation.\r\n\r\nTo judge by their unwillingness to consider any proposals to alter the\r\npresent system, one might have supposed that they were afraid of losing\r\nsomething, instead of having nothing to lose--except their poverty.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the chairman had made several urgent appeals for more\r\nquestions that Crass brightened up: a glad smile slowly spread over and\r\nilluminated his greasy visage: he had at last thought of a most serious\r\nand insurmountable obstacle to the establishment of the Co-operative\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\n\'What,\' he demanded, in a loud voice, \'what are you goin\' to do, in\r\nthis \'ere Socialist Republic of yours, with them wot WON\'T WORK\'!\'\r\n\r\nAs Crass flung this bombshell into the Socialist camp, the miserable,\r\nragged-trousered crew around him could scarce forbear a cheer; but the\r\nmore intelligent part of the audience only laughed.\r\n\r\n\'We don\'t believe that there will be any such people as that,\' said\r\nBarrington.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s plenty of \'em about now, anyway,\' sneered Crass.\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t change \'uman nature, you know,\' cried the man behind the\r\nmoat, and the one who had the copper wire stitches in his boot laughed\r\nscornfully.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know there are plenty such now,\' rejoined Barrington.  \'It\'s\r\nonly what is to be expected, considering that practically all workers\r\nlive in poverty, and are regarded with contempt.  The conditions under\r\nwhich most of the work is done at present are so unpleasant and\r\ndegrading that everyone refuses to do any unless they are compelled;\r\nnone of us here, for instance, would continue to work for Rushton if it\r\nwere not for the fact that we have either to do so or starve; and when\r\nwe do work we only just earn enough to keep body and soul together.\r\nUnder the present system everybody who can possibly manage to do so\r\navoids doing any work, the only difference being that some people do\r\ntheir loafing better than others.  The aristocracy are too lazy to\r\nwork, but they seem to get on all right; they have their tenants to\r\nwork for them.  Rushton is too lazy to work, so he has arranged that we\r\nand Nimrod shall work instead, and he fares much better than any of us\r\nwho do work.  Then there is another kind of loafers who go about\r\nbegging and occasionally starving rather than submit to such abominable\r\nconditions as are offered to them.  These last are generally not much\r\nworse off than we are and they are often better off.  At present,\r\npeople have everything to gain and but little to lose by refusing to\r\nwork.  Under Socialism it would be just the reverse; the conditions of\r\nlabour would be so pleasant, the hours of obligatory work so few, and\r\nthe reward so great, that it is absurd to imagine that any one would be\r\nso foolish as to incur the contempt of his fellows and make himself a\r\nsocial outcast by refusing to do the small share of work demanded of\r\nhim by the community of which he was a member.\r\n\r\n\'As for what we should do to such individuals if there did happen to be\r\nsome, I can assure you that we would not treat them as you treat them\r\nnow.  We would not dress them up in silk and satin and broadcloth and\r\nfine linen: we would not embellish them, as you do, with jewels of gold\r\nand jewels of silver and with precious stones; neither should we allow\r\nthem to fare sumptuously every day.  Our method of dealing with them\r\nwould be quite different from yours.  In the Co-operative Commonwealth\r\nthere will be no place for loafers; whether they call themselves\r\naristocrats or tramps, those who are too lazy to work shall have no\r\nshare in the things that are produced by the labour of others. Those\r\nwho do nothing shall have nothing.  If any man will not work, neither\r\nshall he eat.  Under the present system a man who is really too lazy to\r\nwork may stop you in the street and tell you that he cannot get\r\nemployment.  For all you know, he may be telling the truth, and if you\r\nhave any feeling and are able, you will help him.  But in the Socialist\r\nState no one would have such an excuse, because everyone that was\r\nwilling would be welcome to come and help in the work of producing\r\nwealth and happiness for all, and afterwards he would also be welcome\r\nto his full share of the results.\'\r\n\r\n\'Any more complaints?\' inquired the chairman, breaking the gloomy\r\nsilence that followed.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want anyone to think that I am blaming any of these\r\npresent-day loafers,\' Barrington added.  \'The wealthy ones cannot be\r\nexpected voluntarily to come and work under existing conditions and if\r\nthey were to do so they would be doing more harm than good--they would\r\nbe doing some poor wretches out of employment.  They are not to be\r\nblamed; the people who are to blame are the working classes themselves,\r\nwho demand and vote for the continuance of the present system.  As for\r\nthe other class of loafers--those at the bottom, the tramps and people\r\nof that sort, if they were to become sober and industrious tomorrow,\r\nthey also would be doing more harm than good to the other workers; it\r\nwould increase the competition for work.  If all the loafers in\r\nMugsborough could suddenly be transformed into decent house painters\r\nnext week, Nimrod might be able to cut down the wages another penny an\r\nhour.  I don\'t wish to speak disrespectfully of these tramps at all.\r\nSome of them are such simply because they would rather starve than\r\nsubmit to the degrading conditions that we submit to, they do not see\r\nthe force of being bullied and chased, and driven about in order to\r\ngain semi-starvation and rags.  They are able to get those without\r\nworking; and I sometimes think that they are more worthy of respect and\r\nare altogether a nobler type of beings than a lot of broken-spirited\r\nwretches like ourselves, who are always at the mercy of our masters,\r\nand always in dread of the sack.\'\r\n\r\n\'Any more questions?\' said the chairman.\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean to say as the time will ever come when the gentry will mix\r\nup on equal terms with the likes of us?\' demanded the man behind the\r\nmoat, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no,\' replied the lecturer.  When we get Socialism there won\'t be\r\nany people like us.  Everybody will be civilized.\'\r\n\r\nThe man behind the moat did not seem very satisfied with this answer,\r\nand told the others that he could not see anything to laugh at.\r\n\r\n\'Is there any more questions?\' cried Philpot.  \'Now is your chance to\r\nget some of your own back, but don\'t hall speak at once.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to know who\'s goin\' to do all the dirty work?\' said\r\nSlyme.  \'If everyone is to be allowed to choose \'is own trade, who\'d be\r\nfool enough to choose to be a scavenger, a sweep, a dustman or a sewer\r\nman? nobody wouldn\'t want to do such jobs as them and everyone would be\r\nafter the soft jobs.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' cried Crass, eagerly clutching at this last straw.  \'The\r\nthing sounds all right till you comes to look into it, but it wouldn\'t\r\nnever work!\'\r\n\r\n\'It would be very easy to deal with any difficulty of that sort,\'\r\nreplied Barrington, \'if it were found that too many people were\r\ndesirous of pursuing certain callings, it would be known that the\r\nconditions attached to those kinds of work were unfairly easy, as\r\ncompared with other lines, so the conditions in those trades would be\r\nmade more severe.  A higher degree of skill would be required.  If we\r\nfound that too many persons wished to be doctors, architects, engineers\r\nand so forth, we would increase the severity of the examinations.  This\r\nwould scare away all but the most gifted and enthusiastic.  We should\r\nthus at one stroke reduce the number of applicants and secure the very\r\nbest men for the work--we should have better doctors, better\r\narchitects, better engineers than before.\r\n\r\n\'As regards those disagreeable tasks for which there was a difficulty\r\nin obtaining volunteers, we should adopt the opposite means.  Suppose\r\nthat six hours was the general thing; and we found that we could not\r\nget any sewer men; we should reduce the hours of labour in that\r\ndepartment to four, or if necessary to two, in order to compensate for\r\nthe disagreeable nature of the work.\r\n\r\n\'Another way out of such difficulties would be to have a separate\r\ndivision of the Industrial army to do all such work, and to make it\r\nobligatory for every man to put in his first year of State service as a\r\nmember of this corps.  There would be no hardship in that.  Everyone\r\ngets the benefit of such work; there would be no injustice in requiring\r\neveryone to share.  This would have the effect also of stimulating\r\ninvention; it would be to everyone\'s interest to think out means of\r\ndoing away with such kinds of work and there is no doubt that most of\r\nit will be done by machinery in some way or other.  A few years ago the\r\nonly way to light up the streets of a town was to go round to each\r\nseparate gas lamp and light each jet, one at a time: now, we press a\r\nfew buttons and light up the town with electricity. In the future we\r\nshall probably be able to press a button and flush the sewers.\'\r\n\r\n\'What about religion?\' said Slyme.  \'I suppose there won\'t be no\r\nchurches nor chapels; we shall all have to be atheists.\'\r\n\r\n\'Everybody will be perfectly free to enjoy their own opinions and to\r\npractise any religion they like; but no religion or sect will be\r\nmaintained by the State.  If any congregation or body of people wish to\r\nhave a building for their own exclusive use as a church or chapel or\r\nlecture hall it will be supplied to them by the State on the same terms\r\nas those upon which dwelling houses will be supplied; the State will\r\nconstruct the special kind of building and the congregation will have\r\nto pay the rent, the amount to be based on the cost of construction, in\r\npaper money of course.  As far as the embellishment or decoration of\r\nsuch places is concerned, there will of course be nothing to prevent\r\nthe members of the congregation if they wish from doing any such work\r\nas that themselves in their own spare time of which they will have\r\nplenty.\'\r\n\r\n\'If everybody\'s got to do their share of work, where\'s the minister and\r\nclergymen to come from?\'\r\n\r\n\'There are at least three ways out of that difficulty.  First,\r\nministers of religion could be drawn from the ranks of the\r\nVeterans--men over forty-five years old who had completed their term of\r\nState service.  You must remember that these will not be worn out\r\nwrecks, as too many of the working classes are at that age now.  They\r\nwill have had good food and clothing and good general conditions all\r\ntheir lives; and consequently they will be in the very prime of life.\r\nThey will be younger than many of us now are at thirty; they will be\r\nideal men for the positions we are speaking of.  All well educated in\r\ntheir youth, and all will have had plenty of leisure for self culture\r\nduring the years of their State service and they will have the\r\nadditional recommendation that their congregation will not be required\r\nto pay anything for their services.\r\n\r\n\'Another way: If a congregation wished to retain the full-time services\r\nof a young man whom they thought specially gifted but who had not\r\ncompleted his term of State service, they could secure him by paying\r\nthe State for his services; thus the young man would still remain in\r\nState employment, he would still continue to receive his pay from the\r\nNational Treasury, and at the age of forty-five would be entitled to\r\nhis pension like any other worker, and after that the congregation\r\nwould not have to pay the State anything.\r\n\r\n\'A third--and as it seems to me, the most respectable way--would be for\r\nthe individual in question to act as minister or pastor or lecturer or\r\nwhatever it was, to the congregation without seeking to get out of\r\ndoing his share of the State service.  The hours of obligatory work\r\nwould be so short and the work so light that he would have abundance of\r\nleisure to prepare his orations without sponging on his\r\nco-religionists.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ear, \'ear!\' cried Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' added Barrington, \'it would not only be congregations of\r\nChristians who could adopt any of these methods.  It is possible that a\r\ncongregation of agnostics, for instance, might want a separate building\r\nor to maintain a lecturer.\'\r\n\r\n\'What the \'ell\'s an agnostic?\' demanded Bundy.\r\n\r\n\'An agnostic,\' said the man behind the moat, \'is a bloke wot don\'t\r\nbelieve nothing unless \'e see it with \'is own eyes.\'\r\n\r\n\'All these details,\' continued the speaker, \'of the organization of\r\naffairs and the work of the Co-operative Commonwealth, are things which\r\ndo not concern us at all.  They have merely been suggested by different\r\nindividuals as showing some ways in which these things could be\r\narranged.  The exact methods to be adopted will be decided upon by the\r\nopinion of the majority when the work is being done.  Meantime, what we\r\nhave to do is to insist upon the duty of the State to provide\r\nproductive work for the unemployed, the State feeding of\r\nschoolchildren, the nationalization or Socialization of Railways; Land;\r\nthe Trusts, and all public services that are still in the hands of\r\nprivate companies.  If you wish to see these things done, you must\r\ncease from voting for Liberal and Tory sweaters, shareholders of\r\ncompanies, lawyers, aristocrats, and capitalists; and you must fill the\r\nHouse of Commons with Revolutionary Socialists.  That is--with men who\r\nare in favour of completely changing the present system.  And in the\r\nday that you do that, you will have solved the poverty "problem".  No\r\nmore tramping the streets begging for a job!  No more hungry children\r\nat home.  No more broken boots and ragged clothes.  No more women and\r\nchildren killing themselves with painful labour whilst strong men stand\r\nidly by; but joyous work and joyous leisure for all.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is there any more questions?\' cried Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'Is it true,\' said Easton, \'that Socialists intend to do away with the\r\nArmy and Navy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; it is true.  Socialists believe in International Brotherhood and\r\npeace.  Nearly all wars are caused by profit-seeking capitalists,\r\nseeking new fields for commercial exploitation, and by aristocrats who\r\nmake it the means of glorifying themselves in the eyes of the deluded\r\ncommon people.  You must remember that Socialism is not only a\r\nnational, but an international movement and when it is realized, there\r\nwill be no possibility of war, and we shall no longer need to maintain\r\nan army and navy, or to waste a lot of labour building warships or\r\nmanufacturing arms and ammunition.  All those people who are now\r\nemployed will then be at liberty to assist in the great work of\r\nproducing the benefits of civilization; creating wealth and knowledge\r\nand happiness for themselves and others--Socialism means Peace on earth\r\nand goodwill to all mankind.  But in the meantime we know that the\r\npeople of other nations are not yet all Socialists; we do not forget\r\nthat in foreign countries--just the same as in Britain--there are large\r\nnumbers of profit seeking capitalists, who are so destitute of\r\nhumanity, that if they thought it could be done successfully and with\r\nprofit to themselves they would not scruple to come here to murder and\r\nto rob.  We do not forget that in foreign countries--the same as\r\nhere--there are plenty of so-called "Christian" bishops and priests\r\nalways ready to give their benediction to any such murderous projects,\r\nand to blasphemously pray to the Supreme Being to help his children to\r\nslay each other like wild beasts.  And knowing and remembering all\r\nthis, we realize that until we have done away with capitalism,\r\naristocracy and anti-Christian clericalism, it is our duty to be\r\nprepared to defend our homes and our native land.  And therefore we are\r\nin favour of maintaining national defensive forces in the highest\r\npossible state of efficiency.  But that does not mean that we are in\r\nfavour of the present system of organizing those forces.  We do not\r\nbelieve in conscription, and we do not believe that the nation should\r\ncontinue to maintain a professional standing army to be used at home\r\nfor the purpose of butchering men and women of the working classes in\r\nthe interests of a handful of capitalists, as has been done at\r\nFeatherstone and Belfast; or to be used abroad to murder and rob the\r\npeople of other nations.  Socialists advocate the establishment of a\r\nNational Citizen Army, for defensive purposes only.  We believe that\r\nevery able bodied man should be compelled to belong to this force and\r\nto undergo a course of military training, but without making him into a\r\nprofessional soldier, or taking him away from civil life, depriving him\r\nof the rights of citizenship or making him subject to military "law"\r\nwhich is only another name for tyranny and despotism.  This Citizen\r\nArmy could be organized on somewhat similar lines to the present\r\nTerritorial Force, with certain differences.  For instance, we do not\r\nbelieve--as our present rulers do--that wealth and aristocratic\r\ninfluence are the two most essential qualifications for an efficient\r\nofficer; we believe that all ranks should be attainable by any man, no\r\nmatter how poor, who is capable of passing the necessary examinations,\r\nand that there should be no expense attached to those positions which\r\nthe Government grant, or the pay, is not sufficient to cover.  The\r\nofficers could be appointed in any one of several ways: They might be\r\nelected by the men they would have to command, the only qualification\r\nrequired being that they had passed their examinations, or they might\r\nbe appointed according to merit--the candidate obtaining the highest\r\nnumber of marks at the examinations to have the first call on any\r\nvacant post, and so on in order of merit.  We believe in the total\r\nabolition of courts martial, any offence against discipline should be\r\npunishable by the ordinary civil law--no member of the Citizen Army\r\nbeing deprived of the rights of a citizen.\'\r\n\r\n\'What about the Navy?\' cried several voices.\r\n\r\n\'Nobody wants to interfere with the Navy except to make its\r\norganization more democratic--the same as that of the Citizen Army--and\r\nto protect its members from tyranny by entitling them to be tried in a\r\ncivil court for any alleged offence.\r\n\r\n\'It has been proved that if the soil of this country were\r\nscientifically cultivated, it is capable of producing sufficient to\r\nmaintain a population of a hundred millions of people.  Our present\r\npopulation is only about forty millions, but so long as the land\r\nremains in the possession of persons who refuse to allow it to be\r\ncultivated we shall continue to be dependent on other countries for our\r\nfood supply.  So long as we are in that position, and so long as\r\nforeign countries are governed by Liberal and Tory capitalists, we\r\nshall need the Navy to protect our overseas commerce from them.  If we\r\nhad a Citizen Army such as I have mentioned, of nine or ten millions of\r\nmen and if the land of this country was properly cultivated, we should\r\nbe invincible at home.  No foreign power would ever be mad enough to\r\nattempt to land their forces on our shores.  But they would now be able\r\nto starve us all to death in a month if it were not for the Navy.  It\'s\r\na sensible and creditable position, isn\'t it?\' concluded Barrington.\r\n\'Even in times of peace, thousands of people standing idle and tamely\r\nstarving in their own fertile country, because a few land "Lords"\r\nforbid them to cultivate it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is there any more questions?\' demanded Philpot, breaking a prolonged\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\'Would any Liberal or Tory capitalist like to get up into the pulpit\r\nand oppose the speaker?\' the chairman went on, finding that no one\r\nresponded to his appeal for questions.\r\n\r\nThe silence continued.\r\n\r\n\'As there\'s no more questions and no one won\'t get up into the pulpit,\r\nit is now my painful duty to call upon someone to move a resolution.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mr Chairman,\' said Harlow, \'I may say that when I came on this\r\nfirm I was a Liberal, but through listenin\' to several lectures by\r\nProfessor Owen and attendin\' the meetings on the hill at Windley and\r\nreading the books and pamphlets I bought there and from Owen, I came to\r\nthe conclusion some time ago that it\'s a mug\'s game for us to vote for\r\ncapitalists whether they calls theirselves Liberals or Tories. They\'re\r\nall alike when you\'re workin\' for \'em; I defy any man to say what\'s the\r\ndifference between a Liberal and a Tory employer.  There is none--there\r\ncan\'t be; they\'re both sweaters, and they\'ve got to be, or they\r\nwouldn\'t be able to compete with each other.  And since that\'s what\r\nthey are, I say it\'s a mug\'s game for us to vote \'em into Parliament to\r\nrule over us and to make laws that we\'ve got to abide by whether we\r\nlike it or not. There\'s nothing to choose between \'em, and the proof of\r\nit is that it\'s never made much difference to us which party was in or\r\nwhich was out.  It\'s quite true that in the past both of \'em have\r\npassed good laws, but they\'ve only done it when public opinion was so\r\nstrong in favour of it that they knew there was no getting out of it,\r\nand then it was a toss up which side did it.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the way I\'ve been lookin\' at things lately, and I\'d almost made\r\nup my mind never to vote no more, or to trouble myself about politics\r\nat all, because although I could see there was no sense in voting for\r\nLiberal or Tory capitalists, at the same time I must admit I couldn\'t\r\nmake out how Socialism was going to help us.  But the explanation of it\r\nwhich Professor Barrington has given us this afternoon has been a bit\r\nof an eye opener for me, and with your permission I should like to move\r\nas a resolution, "That it is the opinion of this meeting that Socialism\r\nis the only remedy for Unemployment and Poverty."\'\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of Harlow\'s address was greeted with loud cheers from\r\nthe Socialists, but most of the Liberal and Tory supporters of the\r\npresent system maintained a sulky silence.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll second that resolution,\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'And I\'ll lay a bob both ways,\' remarked Bundy.  The resolution was\r\nthen put, and though the majority were against it, the Chairman\r\ndeclared it was carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nBy this time the violence of the storm had in a great measure abated,\r\nbut as rain was still falling it was decided not to attempt to resume\r\nwork that day.  Besides, it would have been too late, even if the\r\nweather had cleared up.\r\n\r\n\'P\'raps it\'s just as well it \'as rained,\' remarked one man.  \'If it\r\n\'adn\'t some of us might \'ave got the sack tonight.  As it is, there\'ll\r\nbe hardly enough for all of us to do tomorrer and Saturday mornin\' even\r\nif it is fine.\'\r\n\r\nThis was true: nearly all the outside was finished, and what remained\r\nto be done was ready for the final coat.  Inside all there was to do\r\nwas to colour wash the walls and to give the woodwork of the kitchen\r\nand scullery the last coat of paint.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable--unless the firm had some other work for them to do\r\nsomewhere else--that there would be a great slaughter on Saturday.\r\n\r\n\'Now,\' said Philpot, assuming what he meant to be the manner of a\r\nschool teacher addressing children, \'I wants you hall to make a\r\nspeshall heffort and get \'ere very early in the mornin\'--say about four\r\no\'clock--and them wot doos the most work tomorrer, will get a prize on\r\nSaturday.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'ll it be, the sack?\' inquired Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Philpot, \'and not honly will you get a prize for good\r\nconduck tomorrer, but if you all keep on workin\' like we\'ve bin doing\r\nlately till you\'re too hold and wore hout to do any more, you\'ll be\r\nallowed to go to a nice workhouse for the rest of your lives! and each\r\none of you will be given a title--"Pauper!"\'\r\n\r\nAnd they laughed!\r\n\r\nAlthough the majority of them had mothers or fathers or other near\r\nrelatives who had already succeeded to the title--they laughed!\r\n\r\nAs they were going home, Crass paused at the gate, and pointing up to\r\nthe large gable at the end of the house, he said to Philpot:\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll want the longest ladder--the 65, for that, tomorrow.\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot looked up at the gable.\r\n\r\nIt was very high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 46\r\n\r\nThe \'Sixty-five\'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning after breakfast, Philpot, Sawkins, Harlow and\r\nBarrington went to the Yard to get the long ladder--the 65--so called\r\nbecause it had sixty-five rungs.  It was really what is known as a\r\nbuilder\'s scaffold ladder, and it had been strengthened by several iron\r\nbolts or rods which passed through just under some of the rungs.  One\r\nside of the ladder had an iron band or ribbon twisted and nailed round\r\nit spirally.  It was not at all suitable for painters\' work, being\r\naltogether too heavy and cumbrous.  However, as none of the others were\r\nlong enough to reach the high gable at the Refuge, they managed, with a\r\nstruggle, to get it down from the hooks and put it on one of the\r\nhandcarts and soon passed through the streets of mean and dingy houses\r\nin the vicinity of the yard, and began the ascent of the long hill.\r\n\r\nThere had been a lot of rain during the night, and the sky was still\r\novercast with dark grey clouds.  The cart went heavily over the muddy\r\nroad; Sawkins was at the helm, holding the end of the ladder and\r\nsteering; the others walked a little further ahead, at the sides of the\r\ncart.\r\n\r\nIt was such hard work that by the time they were half-way up the hill\r\nthey were so exhausted and out of breath that they had to stop for a\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\'This is a bit of all right, ain\'t it?\' remarked Harlow as he took off\r\nhis cap and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\nWhile they rested they kept a good look out for Rushton or Hunter, who\r\nwere likely to pass by at any moment.\r\n\r\nAt first, no one made any reply to Harlow\'s observation, for they were\r\nall out of breath and Philpot\'s lean fingers trembled violently as he\r\nwiped the perspiration from his face.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, mate,\' he said despondently, after a while.  \'It\'s one way of\r\ngettin\' a livin\' and there\'s plenty better ways.\'\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fact that his rheumatism was exceptionally bad, he\r\nfelt unusually low-spirited this morning; the gloomy weather and the\r\nprospect of a long day of ladder work probably had something to do with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\'A "living" is right,\' said Barrington bitterly.  He also was exhausted\r\nwith the struggle up the hill and enraged by the woebegone appearance\r\nof poor old Philpot, who was panting and quivering from the exertion.\r\n\r\nThey relapsed into silence.  The unaccountable depression that\r\npossessed Philpot deprived him of all his usual jocularity and filled\r\nhim with melancholy thoughts.  He had travelled up and down this hill a\r\ngreat many times before under similar circumstances and he said to\r\nhimself that if he had half a quid now for every time he had pushed a\r\ncart up this road, he wouldn\'t need to do anyone out of a job all the\r\nrest of his life.\r\n\r\nThe shop where he had been apprenticed used to be just down at the\r\nbottom; the place had been pulled down years ago, and the ground was\r\nnow occupied by more pretentious buildings.  Not quite so far down the\r\nroad--on the other side--he could see the church where he used to\r\nattend Sunday School when he was a boy, and where he was married just\r\nthirty years ago.  Presently--when they reached the top of the hill--he\r\nwould be able to look across the valley and see the spire of the other\r\nchurch, the one in the graveyard, where all those who were dear to him\r\nhad been one by one laid to rest.  He felt that he would not be sorry\r\nwhen the time came to join them there.  Possibly, in the next world--if\r\nthere were such a place--they might all be together once more.\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly aroused from these thoughts by an exclamation from\r\nHarlow.\r\n\r\n\'Look out! Here comes Rushton.\'\r\n\r\nThey immediately resumed their journey.  Rushton was coming up the hill\r\nin his dog-cart with Grinder sitting by his side.  They passed so\r\nclosely that Philpot--who was on that side of the cart--was splashed\r\nwith mud from the wheels of the trap.\r\n\r\n\'Them\'s some of your chaps, ain\'t they?\' remarked Grinder.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' replied Rushton.  \'We\'re doing a job up this way.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should \'ave thought it would pay you better to use a \'orse for sich\r\nwork as that,\' said Grinder.\r\n\r\n\'We do use the horses whenever it\'s necessary for very big loads, you\r\nknow,\' answered Rushton, and added with a laugh: \'But the donkeys are\r\nquite strong enough for such a job as that.\'\r\n\r\nThe \'donkeys\' struggled on up the hill for about another hundred yards\r\nand then they were forced to halt again.\r\n\r\n\'We mustn\'t stop long, you know,\' said Harlow.  \'Most likely he\'s gone\r\nto the job, and he\'ll wait to see how long it takes us to get there.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington felt inclined to say that in that case Rushton would have to\r\nwait, but he remained silent, for he remembered that although he\r\npersonally did not care a brass button whether he got the sack or not,\r\nthe others were not so fortunately circumstanced.\r\n\r\nWhile they were resting, another two-legged donkey passed by pushing\r\nanother cart--or rather, holding it back, for he was coming slowly down\r\nthe hill.  Another Heir of all the ages--another Imperialist--a\r\ndegraded, brutalized wretch, clad in filthy, stinking rags, his toes\r\nprotruding from the rotten broken boots that were tied with bits of\r\nstring upon his stockingless feet.  The ramshackle cart was loaded with\r\nempty bottles and putrid rags, heaped loosely in the cart and packed\r\ninto a large sack.  Old coats and trousers, dresses, petticoats, and\r\nunder-clothing, greasy, mildewed and malodorous.  As he crept along\r\nwith his eyes on the ground, the man gave utterance at intervals to\r\nuncouth, inarticulate sounds.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s another way of gettin\' a livin\',\' said Sawkins with a laugh as\r\nthe miserable creature slunk past.\r\n\r\nHarlow also laughed, and Barrington regarded them curiously.  He\r\nthought it strange that they did not seem to realize that they might\r\nsome day become like this man themselves.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve often wondered what they does with all them dirty old rags,\' said\r\nPhilpot.\r\n\r\n\'Made into paper,\' replied Harlow, briefly.\r\n\r\n\'Some of them are,\' said Barrington, \'and some are manufactured into\r\nshoddy cloth and made into Sunday clothes for working men.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s all sorts of different ways of gettin\' a livin\',\' remarked\r\nSawkins, after a pause.  \'I read in a paper the other day about a bloke\r\nwot goes about lookin\' for open trap doors and cellar flaps in front of\r\nshops.  As soon as he spotted one open, he used to go and fall down in\r\nit; and then he\'d be took to the \'orspital, and when he got better he\r\nused to go and threaten to bring a action against the shop-keeper and\r\nget damages, and most of \'em used to part up without goin\' in front of\r\nthe judge at all.  But one day a slop was a watchin\' of \'im, and seen\r\n\'im chuck \'isself down one, and when they picked \'im up they found he\'d\r\nbroke his leg.  So they took \'im to the \'orspital and when he came out\r\nand went round to the shop and started talkin\' about bringin\' a action\r\nfor damages, the slop collared \'im and they give \'im six months.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I read about that,\' said Harlow, \'and there was another case of a\r\nchap who was run over by a motor, and they tried to make out as \'e put\r\n\'isself in the way on purpose; but \'e got some money out of the swell\r\nit belonged to; a \'undered pound I think it was.\'\r\n\r\n\'I only wish as one of their motors would run inter me,\' said Philpot,\r\nmaking a feeble attempt at a joke.  \'I lay I\'d get some a\' me own back\r\nout of \'em.\'\r\n\r\nThe others laughed, and Harlow was about to make some reply but at that\r\nmoment a cyclist appeared coming down the hill from the direction of\r\nthe job.  It was Nimrod, so they resumed their journey once more and\r\npresently Hunter shot past on his machine without taking any notice of\r\nthem...\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived they found that Rushton had not been there at all,\r\nbut Nimrod had.  Crass said that he had kicked up no end of a row\r\nbecause they had not called at the yard at six o\'clock that morning for\r\nthe ladder, instead of going for it after breakfast--making two\r\njourneys instead of one, and he had also been ratty because the big\r\ngable had not been started the first thing that morning.\r\n\r\nThey carried the ladder into the garden and laid it on the ground along\r\nthe side of the house where the gable was.  A brick wall about eight\r\nfeet high separated the grounds of \'The Refuge\' from those of the\r\npremises next door.  Between this wall and the side wall of the house\r\nwas a space about six feet wide and this space formed a kind of alley\r\nor lane or passage along the side of the house.  They laid the ladder\r\non the ground along this passage, the \'foot\' was placed about half-way\r\nthrough; just under the centre of the gable, and as it lay there, the\r\nother end of the ladder reached right out to the front railings.\r\n\r\nNext, it was necessary that two men should go up into the attic--the\r\nwindow of which was just under the point of the gable--and drop the end\r\nof a long rope down to the others who would tie it to the top of the\r\nladder.  Then two men would stand on the bottom rung, so as to keep the\r\n\'foot\' down, and the three others would have to raise the ladder up,\r\nwhile the two men up in the attic hauled on the rope.\r\n\r\nThey called Bundy and his mate Ned Dawson to help, and it was arranged\r\nthat Harlow and Crass should stand on the foot because they were the\r\nheaviest.  Philpot, Bundy, and Barrington were to \'raise\', and Dawson\r\nand Sawkins were to go up to the attic and haul on the rope.\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s the rope?\' asked Crass.\r\n\r\nThe others looked blankly at him.  None of them had thought of bringing\r\none from the yard.\r\n\r\n\'Why, ain\'t there one \'ere?\' asked Philpot.\r\n\r\n\'One \'ere?  Of course there ain\'t one \'ere!\' snarled Crass.  \'Do you\r\nmean to say as you ain\'t brought one, then?\'\r\n\r\nPhilpot stammered out something about having thought there was one at\r\nthe house already, and the others said they had not thought about it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what the bloody hell are we to do now?\' cried Crass, angrily.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll go to the yard and get one,\' suggested Barrington.  \'I can do it\r\nin twenty minutes there and back.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes! and a bloody fine row there\'d be if Hunter was to see you!  \'Ere\r\nit\'s nearly ten o\'clock and we ain\'t made a start on this gable wot we\r\nought to \'ave started first thing this morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Couldn\'t we tie two or three of those short ropes together?\' suggested\r\nPhilpot.  \'Those that the other two ladders was spliced with?\'\r\n\r\nAs there was sure to be a row if they delayed long enough to send to\r\nthe yard, it was decided to act on Philpot\'s suggestion.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the short ropes were accordingly tied together but upon\r\nexamination it was found that some parts were so weak that even Crass\r\nhad to admit it would be dangerous to attempt to haul the heavy ladder\r\nup with them.\r\n\r\n\'Well, the only thing as I can see for it,\' he said, \'is that the boy\r\nwill \'ave to go down to the yard and get the long rope.  It won\'t do\r\nfor anyone else to go: there\'s been one row already about the waste of\r\ntime because we didn\'t call at the yard for the ladder at six o\'clock.\'\r\n\r\nBert was down in the basement of the house limewashing a cellar. Crass\r\ncalled him up and gave him the necessary instructions, chief of which\r\nwas to get back again as soon as ever he could.  The boy ran off, and\r\nwhile they were waiting for him to come back the others went on with\r\ntheir several jobs.  Philpot returned to the small gable he had been\r\npainting before breakfast, which he had not quite finished. As he\r\nworked a sudden and unaccountable terror took possession of him. He did\r\nnot want to do that other gable; he felt too ill; and he almost\r\nresolved that he would ask Crass if he would mind letting him do\r\nsomething else.  There were several younger men who would not object to\r\ndoing it--it would be mere child\'s play to them, and Barrington had\r\nalready--yesterday--offered to change jobs with him.\r\n\r\nBut then, when he thought of what the probable consequences would be,\r\nhe hesitated to take that course, and tried to persuade himself that he\r\nwould be able to get through with the work all right.  He did not want\r\nCrass or Hunter to mark him as being too old for ladder work.\r\n\r\nBert came back in about half an hour flushed and sweating with the\r\nweight of the rope and with the speed he had made.  He delivered it to\r\nCrass and then returned to his cellar and went on with the limewashing,\r\nwhile Crass passed the word for Philpot and the others to come and\r\nraise the ladder.  He handed the rope to Ned Dawson, who took it up to\r\nthe attic, accompanied by Sawkins; arrived there they lowered one end\r\nout of the window down to the others.\r\n\r\n\'If you ask me,\' said Ned Dawson, who was critically examining the\r\nstrands of the rope as he passed it out through the open window, \'If\r\nyou ask me, I don\'t see as this is much better than the one we made up\r\nby tyin\' the short pieces together.  Look \'ere,\'--he indicated a part\r\nof the rope that was very frayed and worn--\'and \'ere\'s another place\r\njust as bad.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, for Christ\'s sake don\'t say nothing about it now,\' replied\r\nSawkins.  \'There\'s been enough talk and waste of time over this job\r\nalready.\'\r\n\r\nNed made no answer and the end having by this time reached the ground,\r\nBundy made it fast to the ladder, about six rungs from the top.\r\n\r\nThe ladder was lying on the ground, parallel to the side of the house.\r\nThe task of raising it would have been much easier if they had been\r\nable to lay it at right angles to the house wall, but this was\r\nimpossible because of the premises next door and the garden wall\r\nbetween the two houses.  On account of its having to be raised in this\r\nmanner the men at the top would not be able to get a straight pull on\r\nthe rope; they would have to stand back in the room without being able\r\nto see the ladder, and the rope would have to be drawn round the corner\r\nof the window, rasping against the edge of the stone sill and the\r\nbrickwork.\r\n\r\nThe end of the rope having been made fast to the top of the ladder,\r\nCrass and Harlow stood on the foot and the other three raised the top\r\nfrom the ground; as Barrington was the tallest, he took the middle\r\nposition--underneath the ladder--grasping the rungs, Philpot being on\r\nhis left and Bundy on his right, each holding one side of the ladder.\r\n\r\nAt a signal from Crass, Dawson and Sawkins began to haul on the rope,\r\nand the top of the ladder began to rise slowly into the air.\r\n\r\nPhilpot was not of much use at this work, which made it all the harder\r\nfor the other two who were lifting, besides putting an extra strain on\r\nthe rope.  His lack of strength, and the efforts of Barrington and\r\nBundy to make up for him caused the ladder to sway from side to side,\r\nas it would not have done if they had all been equally capable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, upstairs, Dawson and Sawkins--although the ladder was as yet\r\nonly a little more than half the way up--noticed, as they hauled and\r\nstrained on the rope, that it had worn a groove for itself in the\r\ncorner of the brickwork at the side of the window; and every now and\r\nthen, although they pulled with all their strength, they were not able\r\nto draw in any part of the rope at all; and it seemed to them as if\r\nthose others down below must have let go their hold altogether, or\r\nceased lifting.\r\n\r\nThat was what actually happened.  The three men found the weight so\r\noverpowering, that once or twice they were compelled to relax their\r\nefforts for a few seconds, and at those times the rope had to carry the\r\nwhole weight of the ladder; and the part of the rope that had to bear\r\nthe greatest strain was the part that chanced to be at the angle of the\r\nbrickwork at the side of the window.  And presently it happened that\r\none of the frayed and worn places that Dawson had remarked about was\r\njust at the angle during one of those momentary pauses.  On one end\r\nthere hung the ponderous ladder, straining the frayed rope against the\r\ncorner of the brickwork and the sharp edge of the stone sill, at the\r\nother end were Dawson and Sawkins pulling with all their strength, and\r\nin that instant the rope snapped like a piece of thread.  One end\r\nremained in the hands of Sawkins and Dawson, who reeled backwards into\r\nthe room, and the other end flew up into the air, writhing like the\r\nlash of a gigantic whip.  For a moment the heavy ladder swayed from\r\nside to side: Barrington, standing underneath, with his hands raised\r\nabove his head grasping one of the rungs, struggled desperately to hold\r\nit up.  At his right stood Bundy, also with arms upraised holding the\r\nside; and on the left, between the ladder and the wall, was Philpot.\r\n\r\nFor a brief space they strove fiercely to support the overpowering\r\nweight, but Philpot had no strength, and the ladder, swaying over to\r\nthe left, crashed down, crushing him upon the ground and against the\r\nwall of the house.  He fell face downwards, with the ladder across his\r\nshoulders; the side that had the iron bands twisted round it fell\r\nacross the back of his neck, forcing his face against the bricks at the\r\nbase of the wall.  He uttered no cry and was quite still, with blood\r\nstreaming from the cuts on his face and trickling from his ears.\r\n\r\nBarrington was also hurled to the ground with his head and arms under\r\nthe ladder; his head and face were cut and bleeding and he was\r\nunconscious; none of the others was hurt, for they had all had time to\r\njump clear when the ladder fell.  Their shouts soon brought all the\r\nother men running to the spot, and the ladder was quickly lifted off\r\nthe two motionless figures.  At first it seemed that Philpot was dead,\r\nbut Easton rushed off for a neighbouring doctor, who came in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nHe knelt down and carefully examined the crushed and motionless form of\r\nPhilpot, while the other men stood by in terrified silence.\r\n\r\nBarrington, who fortunately was but momentarily stunned was sitting\r\nagainst the wall and had suffered nothing more serious than minor cuts\r\nand bruises.\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s examination of Philpot was a very brief one, and when he\r\nrose from his knees, even before he spoke they knew from his manner\r\nthat their worst fears were realized.\r\n\r\nPhilpot was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 47\r\n\r\nThe Ghouls\r\n\r\n\r\nBarrington did not do any more work that day, but before going home he\r\nwent to the doctor\'s house and the latter dressed the cuts on his head\r\nand arms.  Philpot\'s body was taken away on the ambulance to the\r\nmortuary.\r\n\r\nHunter arrived at the house shortly afterwards and at once began to\r\nshout and bully because the painting of the gable was not yet\r\ncommenced.  When he heard of the accident he blamed them for using the\r\nrope, and said they should have asked for a new one.  Before he went\r\naway he had a long, private conversation with Crass, who told him that\r\nPhilpot had no relatives and that his life was insured for ten pounds\r\nin a society of which Crass was also a member.  He knew that Philpot\r\nhad arranged that in the event of his death the money was to be paid to\r\nthe old woman with whom he lodged, who was a very close friend. The\r\nresult of this confidential talk was that Crass and Hunter came to the\r\nconclusion that it was probable that she would be very glad to be\r\nrelieved of the trouble of attending to the business of the funeral,\r\nand that Crass, as a close friend of the dead man, and a fellow member\r\nof the society, was the most suitable person to take charge of the\r\nbusiness for her.  He was already slightly acquainted with the old\r\nlady, so he would go to see her at once and get her authority to act on\r\nher behalf.  Of course, they would not be able to do much until after\r\nthe inquest, but they could get the coffin made--as Hunter knew the\r\nmortuary keeper there would be no difficulty about getting in for a\r\nminute to measure the corpse.\r\n\r\nThis matter having been arranged, Hunter departed to order a new rope,\r\nand shortly afterwards Crass--having made sure that everyone would have\r\nplenty to do while he was gone--quietly slipped away to go to see\r\nPhilpot\'s landlady.  He went off so secretly that the men did not know\r\nthat he had been away at all until they saw him come back just before\r\ntwelve o\'clock.\r\n\r\nThe new rope was brought to the house about one o\'clock and this time\r\nthe ladder was raised without any mishap.  Harlow was put on to paint\r\nthe gable, and he felt so nervous that he was allowed to have Sawkins\r\nto stand by and hold the ladder all the time.  Everyone felt nervous\r\nthat afternoon, and they all went about their work in an unusually\r\ncareful manner.\r\n\r\nWhen Bert had finished limewashing the cellar, Crass set him to work\r\noutside, painting the gate of the side entrance.  While the boy was\r\nthus occupied he was accosted by a solemn-looking man who asked him\r\nabout the accident.  The solemn stranger was very sympathetic and\r\ninquired what was the name of the man who had been killed, and whether\r\nhe was married.  Bert informed him that Philpot was a widower, and that\r\nhe had no children.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, well, that\'s so much the better, isn\'t it?\' said the stranger\r\nshaking his head mournfully.  \'It\'s a dreadful thing, you know, when\r\nthere\'s children left unprovided for.  You don\'t happen to know where\r\nhe lived, do you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Bert, mentioning the address and beginning to wonder what\r\nthe solemn man wanted to know for, and why he appeared to be so sorry\r\nfor Philpot since it was quite evident that he had never known him.\r\n\r\n\'Thanks very much,\' said the man, pulling out his pocket-book and\r\nmaking a note of it.  \'Thanks very much indeed.  Good afternoon,\' and\r\nhe hurried off.\r\n\r\n\'Good afternoon, sir,\' said Bert and he turned to resume his work.\r\nCrass came along the garden just as the mysterious stranger was\r\ndisappearing round the corner.\r\n\r\n\'What did HE want?\' said Crass, who had seen the man talking to Bert.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know exactly; he was asking about the accident, and whether\r\nJoe left any children, and where he lived.  He must be a very decent\r\nsort of chap, I should think.  He seems quite sorry about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, he does, does he?\' said Crass, with a peculiar expression. \'Don\'t\r\nyou know who he is?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' replied the boy; \'but I thought p\'raps he was a reporter of some\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\'\'E ain\'t no reporter: that\'s old Snatchum the undertaker.  \'E\'s\r\nsmellin\' round after a job; but \'e\'s out of it this time, smart as \'e\r\nthinks \'e is.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington came back the next morning to work, and at breakfast-time\r\nthere was a lot of talk about the accident.  They said that it was all\r\nvery well for Hunter to talk like that about the rope, but he had known\r\nfor a long time that it was nearly worn out.  Newman said that only\r\nabout three weeks previously when they were raising a ladder at another\r\njob he had shown the rope to him, and Misery had replied that there was\r\nnothing wrong with it.  Several others besides Newman claimed to have\r\nmentioned the matter to Hunter, and each of them said he had received\r\nthe same sort of reply.  But when Barrington suggested that they should\r\nattend the inquest and give evidence to that effect, they all became\r\nsuddenly silent and in a conversation Barrington afterwards had with\r\nNewman the latter pointed out that if he were to do so, it would do no\r\ngood to Philpot.  It would not bring him back but it would be sure to\r\ndo himself a lot of harm.  He would never get another job at Rushton\'s\r\nand probably many of the other employers would \'mark him\' as well.\r\n\r\n\'So if YOU say anything about it,\' concluded Newman, \'don\'t bring my\r\nname into it.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington was constrained to admit that all things considered it was\r\nright for Newman to mind his own business.  He felt that it would not\r\nbe fair to urge him or anyone else to do or say anything that would\r\ninjure themselves.\r\n\r\nMisery came to the house about eleven o\'clock and informed several of\r\nthe hands that as work was very slack they would get their back day at\r\npay time.  He said that the firm had tendered for one or two jobs, so\r\nthey could call round about Wednesday and perhaps he might then be able\r\nto give some of them another start, Barrington was not one of those who\r\nwere \'stood off\', although he had expected to be on account of the\r\nspeech he had made at the Beano, and everyone said that he would have\r\ngot the push sure enough if it had not been for the accident.\r\n\r\nBefore he went away, Nimrod instructed Owen and Crass to go to the yard\r\nat once: they would there find Payne the carpenter, who was making\r\nPhilpot\'s coffin, which would be ready for Crass to varnish by the time\r\nthey got there.\r\n\r\nMisery told Owen that he had left the coffin plate and the instructions\r\nwith Payne and added that he was not to take too much time over the\r\nwriting, because it was a very cheap job.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the yard, Payne was just finishing the coffin,\r\nwhich was of elm.  All that remained to be done to it was the pitching\r\nof the joints inside and Payne was in the act of lifting the pot of\r\nboiling pitch off the fire to do this.\r\n\r\nAs it was such a cheap job, there was no time to polish it properly, so\r\nCrass proceeded to give it a couple of coats of spirit varnish, and\r\nwhile he was doing this Owen wrote the plate, which was made of very\r\nthin zinc lacquered over to make it look like brass:\r\n\r\n                                JOSEPH PHILPOT\r\n                                     Died\r\n                              September 1st 19--\r\n                                Aged 56 years.\r\n\r\nThe inquest was held on the following Monday morning, and as both\r\nRushton and Hunter thought it possible that Barrington might attempt to\r\nimpute some blame to them, they had worked the oracle and had contrived\r\nto have several friends of their own put on the jury.  There was,\r\nhowever, no need for their alarm, because Barrington could not say that\r\nhe had himself noticed, or called Hunter\'s attention to the state of\r\nthe rope; and he did not wish to mention the names of the others\r\nwithout their permission.  The evidence of Crass and the other men who\r\nwere called was to the effect that it was a pure accident. None of them\r\nhad noticed that the rope was unsound.  Hunter also swore that he did\r\nnot know of it--none of the men had ever called his attention to it; if\r\nthey had done so he would have procured a new one immediately.\r\n\r\nPhilpot\'s landlady and Mr Rushton were also called as witnesses, and\r\nthe end was that the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and\r\nadded that they did not think any blame attached to anyone.\r\n\r\nThe coroner discharged the jury, and as they and the witnesses passed\r\nout of the room, Hunter followed Rushton outside, with the hope of\r\nbeing honoured by a little conversation with him on the satisfactory\r\nissue of the case; but Rushton went off without taking any notice of\r\nhim, so Hunter returned to the room where the court had been held to\r\nget the coroner\'s certificate authorizing the interment of the body.\r\nThis document is usually handed to the friends of the deceased or to\r\nthe undertaker acting for them.  When Hunter got back to the room he\r\nfound that during his absence the coroner had given it to Philpot\'s\r\nlandlady, who had taken it with her.  He accordingly hastened outside\r\nagain to ask her for it, but the woman was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nCrass and the other men were also gone; they had hurried off to return\r\nto work, and after a moment\'s hesitation Hunter decided that it did not\r\nmatter much about the certificate.  Crass had arranged the business\r\nwith the landlady and he could get the paper from her later on.  Having\r\ncome to this conclusion, he dismissed the subject from his mind: he had\r\nseveral prices to work out that afternoon--estimates from some jobs the\r\nfirm was going to tender for.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after having been home to tea, Crass and Sawkins met by\r\nappointment at the carpenter\'s shop to take the coffin to the mortuary,\r\nwhere Misery had arranged to meet them at half past eight o\'clock.\r\nHunter\'s plan was to have the funeral take place from the mortuary,\r\nwhich was only about a quarter of an hour\'s walk from the yard; so\r\ntonight they were just going to lift in the body and get the lid\r\nscrewed down.\r\n\r\nIt was blowing hard and raining heavily when Crass and Sawkins set out,\r\ncarrying the coffin--covered with a black cloth--on their shoulders.\r\nThey also took a small pair of tressels for the coffin to stand on.\r\nCrass carried one of these slung over his arm and Sawkins the other.\r\n\r\nOn their way they had to pass the \'Cricketers\' and the place looked so\r\ninviting that they decided to stop and have a drink--just to keep the\r\ndamp out, and as they could not very well take the coffin inside with\r\nthem, they stood it up against the brick wall a little way from the\r\nside of the door: as Crass remarked with a laugh, there was not much\r\ndanger of anyone pinching it.  The Old Dear served them and just as\r\nthey finished drinking the two half-pints there was a loud crash\r\noutside and Crass and Sawkins rushed out and found that the coffin had\r\nblown down and was lying bottom upwards across the pavement, while the\r\nblack cloth that had been wrapped round it was out in the middle of the\r\nmuddy road.  Having recovered this, they shook as much of the dirt off\r\nas they could, and having wrapped it round the coffin again they\r\nresumed their journey to the mortuary, where they found Hunter waiting\r\nfor them, engaged in earnest conversation with the keeper.  The\r\nelectric light was switched on, and as Crass and Sawkins came in they\r\nsaw that the marble slab was empty.\r\n\r\nThe corpse was gone.\r\n\r\n\'Snatchum came this afternoon with a hand-truck and a corfin,\'\r\nexplained the keeper.  \'I was out at the time, and the missis thought\r\nit was all right so she let him have the key.\'\r\n\r\nHunter and Crass looked blankly at each other.\r\n\r\n\'Well, this takes the biskit!\' said the latter as soon as he could\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\'I thought you said you had settled everything all right with the old\r\nwoman?\' said Hunter.\r\n\r\n\'So I did,\' replied Crass.  \'I seen \'er on Friday, and I told \'er to\r\nleave it all to me to attend to, and she said she would.  I told \'er\r\nthat Philpot said to me that if ever anything \'appened to \'im I was to\r\ntake charge of everything for \'er, because I was \'is best friend.  And\r\nI told \'er we\'d do it as cheap as possible.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it seems to me as you\'ve bungled it somehow,\' said Nimrod,\r\ngloomily.  \'I ought to have gone and seen \'er myself, I was afraid\r\nyou\'d make a mess of it,\' he added in a wailing tone.  \'It\'s always the\r\nsame; everything that I don\'t attend to myself goes wrong.\'\r\n\r\nAn uncomfortable silence fell.  Crass thought that the principal piece\r\nof bungling in this affair was Hunter\'s failure to secure possession of\r\nthe Coroner\'s certificate after the inquest, but he was afraid to say\r\nso.\r\n\r\nOutside, the rain was still falling and drove in through the partly\r\nopen door, causing the atmosphere of the mortuary to be even more than\r\nusually cold and damp.  The empty coffin had been reared against one of\r\nthe walls and the marble slab was still stained with blood, for the\r\nkeeper had not had time to clean it since the body had been removed.\r\n\r\n\'I can see \'ow it\'s been worked,\' said Crass at last.  \'There\'s one of\r\nthe members of the club who works for Snatchum, and \'e\'s took it on\r\n\'isself to give the order for the funeral; but \'e\'s got no right to do\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Right or no right, \'e\'s done it,\' replied Misery, \'so you\'d better\r\ntake the box back to the shop.\'\r\n\r\nCrass and Sawkins accordingly returned to the workshop, where they were\r\npresently joined by Nimrod.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been thinking this business over as I came along,\' he said, \'and\r\nI don\'t see being beat like this by Snatchum; so you two can just put\r\nthe tressels and the box on a hand cart and we\'ll take it over to\r\nPhilpot\'s house.\'\r\n\r\nNimrod walked on the pavement while the other two pushed the cart, and\r\nit was about half past nine, when they arrived at the street in Windley\r\nwhere Philpot used to live.  They halted in a dark part of the street a\r\nfew yards away from the house and on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n\'I think the best thing we can do,\' said Misery, \'is for me and Sawkins\r\nto wait \'ere while you go to the \'ouse and see \'ow the land lies.\r\nYou\'ve done all the business with \'er so far.  It\'s no use takin\' the\r\nbox unless we know the corpse is there; for all we know, Snatchum may\r\n\'ave taken it \'ome with \'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; I think that\'ll be the best way,\' agreed Crass, after a moment\'s\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nNimrod and Sawkins accordingly took shelter in the doorway of an empty\r\nhouse, leaving the handcart at the kerb, while Crass went across the\r\nstreet and knocked at Philpot\'s door.  They saw it opened by an elderly\r\nwoman holding a lighted candle in her hand; then Crass went inside and\r\nthe door was shut.  In about a quarter of an hour he reappeared and,\r\nleaving the door partly open behind him, he came out and crossed over\r\nto where the others were waiting.  As he drew near they could see that\r\nhe carried a piece of paper in his hand.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all right,\' he said in a hoarse whisper as he came up.  I\'ve got\r\nthe stifficut.\'\r\n\r\nMisery took the paper eagerly and scanned it by the light of a match\r\nthat Crass struck.  It was the certificate right enough, and with a\r\nsigh of relief Hunter put it into his note-book and stowed it safely\r\naway in the inner pocket of his coat, while Crass explained the result\r\nof his errand.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the other member of the Society, accompanied by\r\nSnatchum, had called upon the old woman and had bluffed her into giving\r\nthem the order for the funeral.  It was they who had put her up to\r\ngetting the certificate from the Coroner--they had been careful to keep\r\naway from the inquest themselves so as not to arouse Hunter\'s or\r\nCrass\'s suspicions.\r\n\r\n\'When they brought the body \'ome this afternoon,\' Crass went on,\r\n\'Snatchum tried to get the stifficut orf \'er, but she\'d been thinkin\'\r\nthings over and she was a bit frightened \'cos she knowed she\'d made\r\narrangements with me, and she thought she\'d better see me first; so she\r\ntold \'im she\'d give it to \'im on Thursday; that\'s the day as \'e was\r\ngoin\' to \'ave the funeral.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'ll find he\'s a day too late,\' said Misery, with a ghastly grin.\r\n\'We\'ll get the job done on Wednesday.\'\r\n\r\n\'She didn\'t want to give it to me, at first,\' Crass concluded, \'but I\r\ntold \'er we\'d see \'er right if old Snatchum tried to make \'er pay for\r\nthe other coffin.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think he\'s likely to make much fuss about it,\' said Hunter.\r\n\'He won\'t want everybody to know he was so anxious for the job.\'\r\n\r\nCrass and Sawkins pushed the handcart over to the other side of the\r\nroad and then, lifting the coffin off, they carried it into the house,\r\nNimrod going first.\r\n\r\nThe old woman was waiting for them with the candle at the end of the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\'I shall be very glad when it\'s all over,\' she said, as she led the way\r\nup the narrow stairs, closely followed by Hunter, who carried the\r\ntressels, Crass and Sawkins, bringing up the rear with the coffin.  \'I\r\nshall be very glad when it\'s all over, for I\'m sick and tired of\r\nanswerin\' the door to undertakers.  If there\'s been one \'ere since\r\nFriday there\'s been a dozen, all after the job, not to mention all the\r\ncards what\'s been put under the door, besides the one\'s what I\'ve had\r\ngive to me by different people.  I had a pair of boots bein\' mended and\r\nthe man took the trouble to bring \'em \'ome when they was finished--a\r\nthing \'e\'s never done before--just for an excuse to give me an\r\nundertaker\'s card.\r\n\r\n\'Then the milkman brought one, and so did the baker, and the\r\ngreengrocer give me another when I went in there on Saturday to buy\r\nsome vegetables for Sunday dinner.\'\r\n\r\nArrived at the top landing the old woman opened a door and entered a\r\nsmall and wretchedly furnished room.\r\n\r\nAcross the lower sash of the window hung a tattered piece of lace\r\ncurtain.  The low ceiling was cracked and discoloured.\r\n\r\nThere was a rickety little wooden washstand, and along one side of the\r\nroom a narrow bed covered with a ragged grey quilt, on which lay a\r\nbundle containing the clothes that the dead man was wearing at the time\r\nof the accident.\r\n\r\nThere was a little table in front of the window, with a small\r\nlooking-glass upon it, and a cane-seated chair was placed by the\r\nbedside and the floor was covered with a faded piece of drab-coloured\r\ncarpet of no perceptible pattern, worn into holes in several places.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this dreary room, upon a pair of tressels, was the\r\ncoffin containing Philpot\'s body.  Seen by the dim and flickering light\r\nof the candle, the aspect of this coffin, covered over with a white\r\nsheet, was terrible in its silent, pathetic solitude.\r\n\r\nHunter placed the pair of tressels he had been carrying against the\r\nwall, and the other two put the empty coffin on the floor by the side\r\nof the bed.  The old woman stood the candlestick on the mantelpiece,\r\nand withdrew, remarking that they would not need her assistance.  The\r\nthree men then removed their overcoats and laid them on the end of the\r\nbed, and from the pocket of his Crass took out two large screwdrivers,\r\none of which he handed to Hunter.  Sawkins held the candle while they\r\nunscrewed and took off the lid of the coffin they had brought with\r\nthem: it was not quite empty, for they had brought a bag of tools\r\ninside it.\r\n\r\n\'I think we shall be able to work better if we takes the other one orf\r\nthe trussels and puts it on the floor,\' remarked Crass.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think so, too,\' replied Hunter.\r\n\r\nCrass took off the sheet and threw it on the bed, revealing the other\r\ncoffin, which was very similar in appearance to the one they had\r\nbrought with them, being of elms, with the usual imitation brass\r\nfurniture.  Hunter took hold of the head and Crass the foot and they\r\nlifted it off the tressels on to the floor.\r\n\r\n\'\'E\'s not very \'eavy; that\'s one good thing,\' observed Hunter.\r\n\r\n\'\'E always was a very thin chap,\' replied Crass.\r\n\r\nThe screws that held down the lid had been covered over with\r\nlarge-headed brass nails which had to be wrenched off before they could\r\nget at the screws, of which there were eight altogether.  It was\r\nevident from the appearance of the beads of these screws that they were\r\nold ones that had been used for some purpose before: they were rusty\r\nand of different sizes, some being rather larger or smaller, than they\r\nshould have been.  They were screwed in so firmly that by the time they\r\nhad drawn half of them out the two men were streaming with\r\nperspiration.  After a while Hunter took the candle from Sawkins and\r\nthe latter had a try at the screws.\r\n\r\n\'Anyone would think the dam\' things had been there for a \'undred\r\nyears,\' remarked Hunter, savagely, as he wiped the sweat from his face\r\nand neck with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\nKneeling on the lid of the coffin and panting and grunting with the\r\nexertion, the other two continued to struggle with their task. Suddenly\r\nCrass uttered an obscene curse; he had broken off one side of the head\r\nof the screw he was trying to turn and almost at the same instant a\r\nsimilar misfortune happened to Sawkins.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Hunter again took a screwdriver himself, and when they got\r\nall the screws out with the exception of the two broken ones, Crass\r\ntook a hammer and chisel out of the bag and proceeded to cut off what\r\nwas left of the tops of the two that remained.  But even after this was\r\ndone the two screws still held the lid on the coffin, and so they had\r\nto hammer the end of the blade of the chisel underneath and lever the\r\nlid up so that they could get hold of it with their fingers.  It split\r\nup one side as they tore it off, exposing the dead man to view.\r\n\r\nAlthough the marks of the cuts and bruises were still visible on\r\nPhilpot\'s face, they were softened down by the pallor of death, and a\r\nplacid, peaceful expression pervaded his features.  His hands were\r\ncrossed upon his breast, and as he lay there in the snow-white grave\r\nclothes, almost covered in by the white lace frill that bordered the\r\nsides of the coffin, he looked like one in a profound and tranquil\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThey laid the broken lid on the bed, and placed the two coffins side by\r\nside on the floor as close together as possible.  Sawkins stood at one\r\nside holding the candle in his left hand and ready to render with his\r\nright any assistance that might unexpectedly prove to be necessary.\r\nCrass, standing at the foot, took hold of the body by the ankles, while\r\nHunter at the other end seized it by the shoulders with his huge,\r\nclawlike hands, which resembled the talons of some obscene bird of\r\nprey, and they dragged it out and placed it in the other coffin.\r\n\r\nWhilst Hunter--hovering ghoulishly over the corpse--arranged the grave\r\nclothes and the frilling, Crass laid the broken cover on the top of the\r\nother coffin and pushed it under the bed out of the way.  Then he\r\nselected the necessary screws and nails from the bag, and Hunter having\r\nby this time finished, they proceeded to screw down the lid. Then they\r\nlifted the coffin on to the tressels, covering it over with the sheet,\r\nand the appearance it then presented was so exactly similar to what\r\nthey had seen when they first entered the room, that it caused the same\r\nthought to occur to all of them: Suppose Snatchum took it into his head\r\nto come there and take the body out again?  If he were to do so and\r\ntake it up to the cemetery they might be compelled to give up the\r\ncertificate to him and then all their trouble would be lost.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief consultation, they resolved that it would be safer to\r\ntake the corpse on the handcart to the yard and keep it in the\r\ncarpenter\'s shop until the funeral, which could take place from there.\r\nCrass and Sawkins accordingly lifted the coffin off the tressels,\r\nand--while Hunter held the light--proceeded to carry it downstairs, a\r\ntask of considerable difficulty owing to the narrowness of the\r\nstaircase and the landing.  However, they got it down at last and,\r\nhaving put it on the handcart, covered it over with the black wrapper.\r\nIt was still raining and the lamp in the cart was nearly out, so\r\nSawkins trimmed the wick and relit it before they started.\r\n\r\nHunter wished them \'Good-night\' at the corner of the street, because it\r\nwas not necessary for him to accompany them to the yard--they would be\r\nable to manage all that remained to be done by themselves. He said he\r\nwould make the arrangements for the funeral as soon as he possibly\r\ncould the next morning, and he would come to the job and let them know,\r\nas soon as he knew himself, at what time they would have to be in\r\nattendance to act as bearers.  He had gone a little distance on his way\r\nwhen he stopped and turned back to them.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not necessary for either of you to make a song about this\r\nbusiness, you know,\' he said.\r\n\r\nThe two men said that they quite understood that: he could depend on\r\ntheir keeping their mouths shut.\r\n\r\nWhen Hunter had gone, Crass drew out his watch.  It was a quarter to\r\neleven.  A little way down the road the lights of a public house were\r\ngleaming through the mist.\r\n\r\n\'We shall be just in time to get a drink before closing time if we buck\r\nup,\' he said.  And with this object they hurried on as fast as they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the tavern they left the cart standing by the kerb,\r\nand went inside, where Crass ordered two pints of four-ale, which he\r\npermitted Sawkins to pay for.\r\n\r\n\'How are we going on about this job?\' inquired the latter after they\r\nhad each taken a long drink, for they were thirsty after their\r\nexertions. \'I reckon we ought to \'ave more than a bob for it, don\'t\r\nyou?  It\'s not like a ordinary "lift in".\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course it ain\'t,\' replied Crass.  \'We ought to \'ave about,\r\nsay\'--reflecting--\'say arf a dollar each at the very least.\'\r\n\r\n\'Little enough too,\' said Sawkins.  \'I was going to say arf a crown,\r\nmyself.\'\r\n\r\nCrass agreed that even half a crown would not be too much.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow are we going\' on about chargin\' it on our time sheets?\' asked\r\nSawkins, after a pause.  \'If we just put a "lift in", they might only\r\npay us a bob as usual.\'\r\n\r\nAs a rule when they had taken a coffin home, they wrote on their time\r\nsheets, \'One lift in\', for which they were usually paid one shilling,\r\nunless it happened to be a very high-class funeral, when they sometimes\r\ngot one and sixpence.  They were never paid by the hour for these jobs.\r\n\r\nCrass smoked reflectively.\r\n\r\n\'I think the best way will be to put it like this,\' he said at length.\r\n\'"Philpot\'s funeral.  One lift out and one lift in.  Also takin\' corpse\r\nto carpenter\'s shop."  \'Ow would that do?\'\r\n\r\nSawkins said that would be a very good way to put it, and they finished\r\ntheir beer just as the landlord intimated that it was closing time.\r\nThe cart was standing where they left it, the black cloth saturated\r\nwith the rain, which dripped mournfully from its sable folds.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the plot of waste ground over which they had to pass\r\nin order to reach the gates of the yard, they had to proceed very\r\ncautiously, for it was very dark, and the lantern did not give much\r\nlight.  A number of carts and lorries were standing there, and the path\r\nwound through pools of water and heaps of refuse.  After much\r\ndifficulty and jolting, they reached the gate, which Crass unlocked\r\nwith the key he had obtained from the office earlier in the evening.\r\nThey soon opened the door of the carpenter\'s shop and, after lighting\r\nthe gas, they arranged the tressels and then brought in the coffin and\r\nplaced it upon them.  Then they locked the door and placed the key in\r\nits usual hiding-place, but the key of the outer gate they took with\r\nthem and dropped into the letter-box at the office, which they had to\r\npass on their way home.\r\n\r\nAs they turned away from the door, they were suddenly confronted by a\r\npoliceman who flashed his lantern in their faces and demanded to know\r\nwhy they had tried the lock...\r\n\r\nThe next morning was a very busy one for Hunter, who had to see several\r\nnew jobs commenced.  They were all small affairs.  Most of them would\r\nonly take two or three days from start to finish.\r\n\r\nAttending to this work occupied most of his morning, but all the same\r\nhe managed to do the necessary business connected with the funeral,\r\nwhich he arranged to take place at two o\'clock on Wednesday afternoon\r\nfrom the mortuary, where the coffin had been removed during the day,\r\nHunter deciding that it would not look well to have the funeral start\r\nfrom the workshop.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hunter had kept it as quiet as possible, there was a small\r\ncrowd, including several old workmates of Philpot\'s who happened to be\r\nout of work, waiting outside the mortuary to see the funeral start, and\r\namongst them were Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were both sober.\r\nBarrington and Owen were also there, having left work for the day in\r\norder to go to the funeral.  They were there too in a sense as the\r\nrepresentatives of the other workmen, for Barrington carried a large\r\nwreath which had been subscribed for voluntarily by Rushton\'s men.\r\nThey could not all afford to lose the time to attend the funeral,\r\nalthough most of them would have liked to pay that tribute of regard to\r\ntheir old mate, so they had done this as the next best thing.  Attached\r\nto the wreath was a strip of white satin ribbon, upon which Owen had\r\npainted a suitable inscription.\r\n\r\nPromptly at two o\'clock the hearse and the mourning coach drove up with\r\nHunter and the four bearers--Crass, Slyme, Payne and Sawkins, all\r\ndressed in black with frock coats and silk hats.  Although they were\r\nnominally attired in the same way, there was a remarkable dissimilarity\r\nin their appearance.  Crass\'s coat was of smooth, intensely black\r\ncloth, having been recently dyed, and his hat was rather low in the\r\ncrown, being of that shape that curved outwards towards the top.\r\nHunter\'s coat was a kind of serge with a rather rusty cast of colour\r\nand his hat was very tall and straight, slightly narrower at the crown\r\nthan at the brim.  As for the others, each of them had a hat of a\r\ndifferent fashion and date, and their \'black\' clothes ranged from rusty\r\nbrown to dark blue.\r\n\r\nThese differences were due to the fact that most of the garments had\r\nbeen purchased at different times from different second-hand clothes\r\nshops, and never being used except on such occasions as the present,\r\nthey lasted for an indefinite time.\r\n\r\nWhen the coffin was brought out and placed in the hearse, Hunter laid\r\nupon it the wreath that Barrington gave him, together with the another\r\nhe had brought himself, which had a similar ribbon with the words:\r\n\'From Rushton & Co. With deep sympathy.\'\r\n\r\nSeeing that Barrington and Owen were the only occupants of the\r\ncarriage, Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk came up to the door and asked\r\nif there was any objection to their coming and as neither Owen nor\r\nBarrington objected, they did not think it necessary to ask anyone\r\nelse\'s permission, so they got in.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hunter had taken his position a few yards in front of the\r\nhearse and the bearers each his proper position, two on each side.  As\r\nthe procession turned into the main road, they saw Snatchum standing at\r\nthe corner looking very gloomy.  Hunter kept his eyes fixed straight\r\nahead and affected not to see him, but Crass could not resist the\r\ntemptation to indulge in a jeering smile, which so enraged Snatchum\r\nthat he shouted out:\r\n\r\n\'It don\'t matter!  I shan\'t lose much!  I can use it for someone else!\'\r\n\r\nThe distance to the cemetery was about three miles, so as soon as they\r\ngot out of the busy streets of the town, Hunter called a halt, and got\r\nup on the hearse beside the driver, Crass sat on the other side, and\r\ntwo of the other bearers stood in the space behind the driver\'s seat,\r\nthe fourth getting up beside the driver of the coach; and then they\r\nproceeded at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\nAs they drew near to the cemetery they slowed down, and finally stopped\r\nwhen about fifty yards from the gate.  Then Hunter and the bearers\r\nresumed their former position, and they passed through the open gate\r\nand up to the door of the church, where they were received by the\r\nclerk--a man in a rusty black cassock, who stood by while they carried\r\nthe coffin in and placed it on a kind of elevated table which revolved\r\non a pivot.  They brought it in footfirst, and as soon as they had\r\nplaced it upon the table, the clerk swung it round so as to bring the\r\nfoot of the coffin towards the door ready to be carried out again.\r\n\r\nThere was a special pew set apart for the undertakers, and in this\r\nHunter and the bearers took their seats to await the arrival of the\r\nclergyman.  Barrington and the three others sat on the opposite side.\r\nThere was no altar or pulpit in this church, but a kind of reading desk\r\nstood on a slightly raised platform at the other end of the aisle.\r\n\r\nAfter a wait of about ten minutes, the clergyman entered and, at once\r\nproceeding to the desk, began to recite in a rapid and wholly\r\nunintelligible manner the usual office.  If it had not been for the\r\nfact that each of his hearers had a copy of the words--for there was a\r\nlittle book in each pew--none of them would have been able to gather\r\nthe sense of what the man was gabbling.  Under any other circumstances,\r\nthe spectacle of a human being mouthing in this absurd way would have\r\ncompelled laughter, and so would the suggestion that this individual\r\nreally believed that he was addressing the Supreme Being.  His attitude\r\nand manner were contemptuously indifferent. While he recited, intoned,\r\nor gabbled, the words of the office, he was reading the certificate and\r\nsome other paper the clerk had placed upon the desk, and when he had\r\nfinished reading these, his gaze wandered abstractedly round the\r\nchapel, resting for a long time with an expression of curiosity upon\r\nBill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were doing their best to follow in\r\ntheir books the words he was repeating. He next turned his attention to\r\nhis fingers, holding his hand away from him nearly at arm\'s length and\r\ncritically examining the nails.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time as this miserable mockery proceeded the clerk in the\r\nrusty black cassock mechanically droned out a sonorous \'Ah-men\', and\r\nafter the conclusion of the lesson the clergyman went out of the\r\nchurch, taking a short cut through the grave-stones and monuments,\r\nwhile the bearers again shouldered the coffin and followed the clerk to\r\nthe grave.  When they arrived within a few yards of their destination,\r\nthey were rejoined by the clergyman, who was waiting for them at the\r\ncorner of one of the paths.  He put himself at the head of the\r\nprocession with an open book in his hand, and as they walked slowly\r\nalong, he resumed his reading or repetition of the words of the service.\r\n\r\nHe had on an old black cassock and a much soiled and slightly torn\r\nsurplice.  The unseemly appearance of this dirty garment was heightened\r\nby the circumstance that he had not taken the trouble to adjust it\r\nproperly.  It hung all lop-sided, showing about six inches more of the\r\nblack cassock underneath one side than the other. However, perhaps it\r\nis not right to criticize this person\'s appearance so severely, because\r\nthe poor fellow was paid only seven-and-six for each burial, and as\r\nthis was only the fourth funeral he had officiated at that day,\r\nprobably he could not afford to wear clean linen--at any rate, not for\r\nthe funerals of the lower classes.\r\n\r\nHe continued his unintelligible jargon while they were lowering the\r\ncoffin into the grave, and those who happened to know the words of the\r\noffice by heart were, with some difficulty, able to understand what he\r\nwas saying:\r\n\r\n\'Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take\r\nunto Himself the soul of our Dear Brother here departed, we therefore\r\ncommit his body to the ground; earth to earth; ashes to ashes, dust to\r\ndust--\'\r\n\r\nThe earth fell from the clerk\'s hand and rattled on the lid of the\r\ncoffin with a mournful sound, and when the clergyman had finished\r\nrepeating the remainder of the service, he turned and walked away in\r\nthe direction of the church.  Hunter and the rest of the funeral party\r\nmade their way back towards the gate of the cemetery where the hearse\r\nand the carriage were waiting.\r\n\r\nOn their way they saw another funeral procession coming towards them.\r\nIt was a very plain-looking closed hearse with only one horse.  There\r\nwas no undertaker in front and no bearers walked by the sides.\r\n\r\nIt was a pauper\'s funeral.\r\n\r\nThree men, evidently dressed in their Sunday clothes, followed behind\r\nthe hearse.  As they reached the church door, four old men who were\r\ndressed in ordinary everyday clothes, came forward and opening the\r\nhearse took out the coffin and carried it into the church, followed by\r\nthe other three, who were evidently relatives of the deceased.  The\r\nfour old men were paupers--inmates of the workhouse, who were paid\r\nsixpence each for acting as bearers.\r\n\r\nThey were just taking out the coffin from the hearse as Hunter\'s party\r\nwas passing, and most of the latter paused for a moment and watched\r\nthem carry it into the church.  The roughly made coffin was of white\r\ndeal, not painted or covered in any way, and devoid of any fittings or\r\nornament with the exception of a square piece of zinc on the lid. None\r\nof Rushton\'s party was near enough to recognize any of the mourners or\r\nto read what was written on the zinc, but if they had been they would\r\nhave seen, roughly painted in black letters\r\n\r\n                                     J.L.\r\n                                   Aged 67\r\n\r\nand some of them would have recognized the three mourners who were Jack\r\nLinden\'s sons.\r\n\r\nAs for the bearers, they were all retired working men who had come into\r\ntheir \'titles\'.  One of them was old Latham, the venetian blind maker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 48\r\n\r\nThe Wise men of the East\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the following week there was a terrible slaughter at\r\nRushton\'s.  Barrington and all the casual hands were sacked, including\r\nNewman, Easton and Harlow, and there was so little work that it looked\r\nas if everyone else would have to stand off also.  The summer was\r\npractically over, so those who were stood off had but a poor chance of\r\ngetting a start anywhere else, because most other firms were\r\ndischarging hands as well.\r\n\r\nThere was only one other shop in the town that was doing anything at\r\nall to speak of, and that was the firm of Dauber and Botchit.  This\r\nfirm had come very much to the front during the summer, and had\r\ncaptured several big jobs that Rushton & Co. had expected to get,\r\nbesides taking away several of the latter\'s old customers.\r\n\r\nThis firm took work at almost half the price that Rushton\'s could do it\r\nfor, and they had a foreman whose little finger was thicker than\r\nNimrod\'s thigh. Some of the men who had worked for both firms during\r\nthe summer, said that after working for Dauber and Botchit, working for\r\nRushton seemed like having a holiday.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s one bloke there,\' said Newman, in conversation with Harlow and\r\nEaston.  \'There\'s one bloke there wot puts up twenty-five rolls o\'\r\npaper in a day an\' trims and pastes for \'imself; and as for the\r\npainters, nearly everyone of \'em gets over as much work as us three put\r\ntogether, and if you\'re working there you\'ve got to do the same or get\r\nthe sack.\'\r\n\r\nHowever much truth or falsehood or exaggeration there may have been in\r\nthe stories of the sweating and driving that prevailed at Dauber and\r\nBotchit\'s, it was an indisputable fact that the other builders found it\r\nvery difficult to compete with them, and between the lot of them what\r\nwork there was to do was all finished or messed up in about a quarter\r\nof the time that it would have taken to do it properly.\r\n\r\nBy the end of September there were great numbers of men out of\r\nemployment, and the practical persons who controlled the town were\r\nalready preparing to enact the usual farce of \'Dealing\' with the\r\ndistress that was certain to ensue.  The Rev. Mr Bosher talked of\r\nreopening the Labour Yard; the secretary of the OBS appealed for more\r\nmoney and cast-off clothing and boots--the funds of the Society had\r\nbeen depleted by the payment of his quarter\'s salary.  There were\r\nrumours that the Soup Kitchen would be reopened at an early date for\r\nthe sale of \'nourishment\', and charitable persons began to talk of\r\nRummage Sales and soup tickets.\r\n\r\nNow and then, whenever a \'job\' \'came in\', a few of Rushton\'s men were\r\nable to put in a few hours\' work, but Barrington never went back.  His\r\nmanner of life was the subject of much speculation on the part of his\r\nformer workmates, who were not a little puzzled by the fact that he was\r\nmuch better dressed than they had ever known him to be before, and that\r\nhe was never without money.  He generally had a tanner or a bob to\r\nlend, and was always ready to stand a drink, to say nothing of what it\r\nmust have cost him for the quantities of Socialist pamphlets and\r\nleaflets that he gave away broadcast.  He lodged over at Windley, but\r\nhe used to take his meals at a little coffee tavern down town, where he\r\nused often to invite one or two of his old mates to take dinner with\r\nhim.  It sometimes happened that one of them would invite him home of\r\nan evening, to drink a cup of tea, or to see some curiosity that the\r\nother thought would interest him, and on these occasions--if there were\r\nany children in the house to which they were going--Barrington usually\r\nmade a point of going into a shop on their way, and buying a bag of\r\ncakes or fruit for them.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of theories were put forward to account for his apparent\r\naffluence.  Some said he was a toff in disguise; others that he had\r\nrich relations who were ashamed of him because he was a Socialist, and\r\nwho allowed him so much a week so long as he kept away from them and\r\ndid not use his real name.  Some of the Liberals said that he was in\r\nthe pay of the Tories, who were seeking by underhand methods to split\r\nup the Progressive Liberal Party.  Just about that time several\r\nburglaries took place in the town, the thieves getting clear away with\r\nthe plunder, and this circumstance led to a dark rumour that Barrington\r\nwas the culprit, and that it was these ill-gotten gains that he was\r\nspending so freely.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of October an event happened that drew the town into a\r\nstate of wild excitement, and such comparatively unimportant subjects\r\nas unemployment and starvation were almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nSir Graball D\'Encloseland had been promoted to yet a higher post in the\r\nservice of the country that he owned such a large part of; he was not\r\nonly to have a higher and more honourable position, but also--as was\r\nnothing but right--a higher salary.  His pay was to be increased to\r\nseven thousand five hundred a year or one hundred and fifty pounds per\r\nweek, and in consequence of this promotion it was necessary for him to\r\nresign his seat and seek re-election.\r\n\r\nThe ragged-trousered Tory workmen as they loitered about the streets,\r\ntheir stomachs empty, said to each other that it was a great honour for\r\nMugsborough that their Member should be promoted in this way. They\r\nboasted about it and assumed as much swagger in their gait as their\r\nbroken boots permitted.\r\n\r\nThey stuck election cards bearing Sir Graball\'s photograph in their\r\nwindows and tied bits of blue and yellow ribbon--Sir Graball\'s\r\ncolours--on their underfed children.\r\n\r\nThe Liberals were furious.  They said that an election had been sprung\r\non them--they had been taken a mean advantage of--they had no candidate\r\nready.\r\n\r\nThey had no complaint to make about the salary, all they complained of\r\nwas the short notice.  It wasn\'t fair because while they--the leading\r\nLiberals--had been treating the electors with the contemptuous\r\nindifference that is customary, Sir Graball D\'Encloseland had been most\r\nactive amongst his constituents for months past, cunningly preparing\r\nfor the contest.  He had really been electioneering for the past six\r\nmonths!  Last winter he had kicked off at quite a number of football\r\nmatches besides doing all sorts of things for the local teams.  He had\r\njoined the Buffalos and the Druids, been elected President of the Skull\r\nand Crossbones Boys\' Society, and, although he was not himself an\r\nabstainer, he was so friendly to Temperance that he had on several\r\noccasions, taken the chair at teetotal meetings, to say nothing of the\r\nteas to the poor school children and things of that sort.  In short, he\r\nhad been quite an active politician, in the Tory sense of the word, for\r\nmonths past and the poor Liberals had not smelt a rat until the\r\nelection was sprung upon them.\r\n\r\nA hurried meeting of the Liberal Three Hundred was held, and a\r\ndeputation sent to London to find a candidate but as there was only a\r\nweek before polling day they were unsuccessful in their mission.\r\nAnother meeting was held, presided over by Mr Adam Sweater--Rushton and\r\nDidlum also being present.\r\n\r\nProfound dejection was depicted on the countenances of those assembled\r\nslave-drivers as they listened to the delegates\' report.  The sombre\r\nsilence that followed was broken at length by Mr Rushton, who suddenly\r\nstarted up and said that he began to think they had made a mistake in\r\ngoing outside the constituency at all to look for a man.  It was\r\nstrange but true that a prophet never received honour in his own land.\r\nThey had been wasting the precious time running about all over the\r\ncountry, begging and praying for a candidate, and overlooking the fact\r\nthat they had in their midst a gentleman--a fellow townsman, who, he\r\nbelieved, would have a better chance of success than any stranger.\r\nSurely they would all agree--if they could only prevail upon him to\r\nstand--that Adam Sweater would be an ideal Liberal Candidate!\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Rushton was speaking the drooping spirits of the Three Hundred\r\nwere reviving, and at the name of Sweater they all began to clap their\r\nhands and stamp their feet.  Loud shouts of enthusiastic approval burst\r\nforth, and cries of \'Good old Sweater\' resounded through the room.\r\n\r\nWhen Sweater rose to reply, the tumult died away as suddenly as it had\r\ncommenced.  He thanked them for the honour they were conferring upon\r\nhim.  There was no time to waste in words or idle compliments; rather\r\nthan allow the Enemy to have a walk-over, he would accede to their\r\nrequest and contest the seat.\r\n\r\nA roar of applause burst from the throats of the delighted Three\r\nHundred.\r\n\r\nOutside the hall in which the meeting was being held a large crowd of\r\npoverty-stricken Liberal working men, many of them wearing broken boots\r\nand other men\'s cast-off clothing, was waiting to hear the report of\r\nthe slave-drivers\' deputation, and as soon as Sweater had consented to\r\nbe nominated, Didlum rushed and opened the window overlooking the\r\nstreet and shouted the good news down to the crowd, which joined in the\r\ncheering.  In response to their demands for a speech, Sweater brought\r\nhis obese carcass to the window and addressed a few words to them,\r\nreminding them of the shortness of the time at their disposal, and\r\nintreating them to work hard in order that the Grand old Flag might be\r\ncarried to victory.\r\n\r\nAt such times these people forgot all about unemployment and\r\nstarvation, and became enthusiastic about \'Grand old Flags\'.  Their\r\ndevotion to this flag was so great that so long as they were able to\r\ncarry it to victory, they did not mind being poverty stricken and\r\nhungry and ragged; all that mattered was to score off their hated\r\n\'enemies\' their fellow countrymen the Tories, and carry the grand old\r\nflag to victory.  The fact that they had carried the flag to victory so\r\noften in the past without obtaining any of the spoils, did not seem to\r\ndamp their ardour in the least.  Being philanthropists, they were\r\ncontent--after winning the victory--that their masters should always do\r\nthe looting.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Sweater\'s remarks the philanthropists gave three\r\nfrantic cheers and then someone in the crowd shouted \'What\'s the\r\ncolour?\'  After a hasty consultation with Rushton, who being a \'master\'\r\ndecorator, was thought to be an authority on colours--green--grass\r\ngreen--was decided upon, and the information was shouted down to the\r\ncrowd, who cheered again.  Then a rush was made to Sweater\'s Emporium\r\nand several yards of cheap green ribbon were bought, and divided up\r\ninto little pieces, which they tied into their buttonholes, and thus\r\nappropriately decorated, formed themselves into military order, four\r\ndeep, and marched through all the principal streets, up and down the\r\nGrand Parade, round and round the Fountain, and finally over the hill\r\nto Windley, singing to the tune of \'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the Boys are\r\nmarching\':\r\n\r\n        \'Vote, Vote, Vote for Adam Sweater!\r\n        Hang old Closeland on a tree!\r\n        Adam Sweater is our man,\r\n        And we\'ll have him if we can,\r\n        Then we\'ll always have the biggest loaf for tea.\'\r\n\r\nThe spectacle presented by these men--some of them with grey heads and\r\nbeards--as they marked time or tramped along singing this childish\r\ntwaddle, would have been amusing if it had not been disgusting.\r\n\r\nBy way of variety they sang several other things, including:\r\n\r\n        \'We\'ll hang ole Closeland\r\n        On a sour apple tree,\'\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n        \'Rally, Rally, men of Windley\r\n        For Sweater\'s sure to win.\'\r\n\r\nAs they passed the big church in Quality Street, the clock began to\r\nstrike.  It was one of those that strike four chimes at each quarter of\r\nthe hour.  It was now ten o\'clock so there were sixteen musical chimes:\r\n\r\n        Ding, dong! Ding Dong!\r\n        Ding dong! Ding dong!\r\n        Ding dong! Ding dong!\r\n        Ding dong! Ding dong!\r\n\r\nThey all chanted A-dam Sweat-er\' in time with the striking clock.  In\r\nthe same way the Tories would chant:\r\n\r\n        \'Grab--all Close--land!\r\n        Grab--all Close--land!\r\n        Grab--all Close--land!\r\n        Grab--all Close--land!\'\r\n\r\nThe town was soon deluged with mendacious literature and smothered with\r\nhuge posters:\r\n\r\n                      \'Vote for Adam Sweater!\r\n                     The Working-man\'s Friend!\'\r\n              \'Vote for Sweater and Temperance Reform.\'\r\n           \'Vote for Sweater--Free Trade and Cheap Food.\'\r\n\r\n                                 or\r\n\r\n      \'Vote for D\'Encloseland: Tariff Reform and Plenty of Work!\'\r\n\r\nThis beautiful idea--\'Plenty of Work\'--appealed strongly to the Tory\r\nworkmen.  They seemed to regard themselves and their children as a sort\r\nof machines or beasts of burden, created for the purpose of working for\r\nthe benefit of other people.  They did not think it right that they\r\nshould Live, and enjoy the benefits of civilization.  All they desired\r\nfor themselves and their children was \'Plenty of Work\'.\r\n\r\nThey marched about the streets singing their Marseillaise, \'Work, Boys,\r\nWork and be contented\', to the tune of \'Tramp, tramp, tramp the Boys\r\nare marching\', and at intervals as they tramped along, they gave three\r\ncheers for Sir Graball, Tariff Reform, and--Plenty of Work.\r\n\r\nBoth sides imported gangs of hired orators who held forth every night\r\nat the corners of the principal streets, and on the open spaces from\r\nportable platforms, and from motor cars and lorries.  The Tories said\r\nthat the Liberal Party in the House of Commons was composed principally\r\nof scoundrels and fools, the Liberals said that the Tory Party were\r\nfools and scoundrels.  A host of richly dressed canvassers descended\r\nupon Windley in carriages and motor cars, and begged for votes from the\r\npoverty-stricken working men who lived there.\r\n\r\nOne evening a Liberal demonstration was held at the Cross Roads on\r\nWindley Hill.  Notwithstanding the cold weather, there was a great\r\ncrowd of shabbily dressed people, many of whom had not had a really\r\ngood meal for months.  It was a clear night.  The moon was at the full,\r\nand the scene was further illuminated by the fitful glare of several\r\ntorches, stuck on the end of twelve-foot poles.  The platform was a\r\nlarge lorry, and there were several speakers, including Adam Sweater\r\nhimself and a real live Liberal Peer--Lord Ammenegg.  This individual\r\nhad made a considerable fortune in the grocery and provision line, and\r\nhad been elevated to the Peerage by the last Liberal Government on\r\naccount of his services to the Party, and in consideration of other\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nBoth Sweater and Ammenegg were to speak at two other meetings that\r\nnight and were not expected at Windley until about eight-thirty, so to\r\nkeep the ball rolling till they arrived, several other gentlemen,\r\nincluding Rushton--who presided--and Didlum, and one of the five pounds\r\na week orators, addressed the meeting.  Mingled with the crowd were\r\nabout twenty rough-looking men--strangers to the town--who wore huge\r\ngreen rosettes and loudly applauded the speakers.  They also\r\ndistributed Sweater literature and cards with lists of the different\r\nmeetings that were to be held during the election.  These men were\r\nbullies hired by Sweater\'s agent.  They came from the neighbourhood of\r\nSeven Dials in London and were paid ten shillings a day.  One of their\r\nduties was to incite the crowd to bash anyone who disturbed the\r\nmeetings or tried to put awkward questions to the speakers.\r\n\r\nThe hired orator was a tall, slight man with dark hair, beard and\r\nmoustache, he might have been called well-looking if it had not been\r\nfor a ugly scar upon his forehead, which gave him a rather sinister\r\nappearance.  He was an effective speaker; the audience punctuated his\r\nspeech with cheers, and when he wound up with an earnest appeal to\r\nthem--as working men--to vote for Adam Sweater, their enthusiasm knew\r\nno bounds.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve seen him somewhere before,\' remarked Barrington, who was standing\r\nin the crowd with Harlow, Owen and Easton.\r\n\r\n\'So have I,\' said Owen, with a puzzled expression.  \'But for the life\r\nof me, I can\'t remember where.\'\r\n\r\nHarlow and Easton also thought they had seen the man before, but their\r\nspeculations were put an end to by the roar of cheering that heralded\r\nthe arrival of the motor car, containing Adam Sweater and his friend,\r\nLord Ammenegg.  Unfortunately, those who had arranged the meeting had\r\nforgotten to provide a pair of steps, so Sweater found it a matter of\r\nconsiderable difficulty to mount the platform.  However, while his\r\nfriends were hoisting and pushing him up, the meeting beguiled the time\r\nby singing:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \'Vote, vote, vote for Adam Sweater.\'\r\n\r\nAfter a terrible struggle they succeeded in getting him on to the cart,\r\nand while he was recovering his wind, Rushton made a few remarks to the\r\ncrowd.  Sweater then advanced to the front, but in consequence of the\r\ncheering and singing, he was unable to make himself heard for several\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nWhen at length he was able to proceed, ho made a very clever speech--it\r\nhad been specially written for him and had cost ten guineas.  A large\r\npart of it consisted of warnings against the dangers of Socialism.\r\nSweater had carefully rehearsed this speech and he delivered it very\r\neffectively.  Some of those Socialists, he said, were well-meaning but\r\nmistaken people, who did not realize the harm that would result if\r\ntheir extraordinary ideas were ever put into practice.  He lowered his\r\nvoice to a blood-curdling stage whisper as he asked:\r\n\r\n\'What is this Socialism that we hear so much about, but which so few\r\nunderstand? What is it, and what does it mean?\'\r\n\r\nThen, raising his voice till it rang through the air and fell upon the\r\nears of the assembled multitude like the clanging of a funeral bell, he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\'It is madness!  Chaos!  Anarchy!  It means Ruin!  Black Ruin for the\r\nrich, and consequently, of course, Blacker Ruin still for the poor!\'\r\n\r\nAs Sweater paused, a thrill of horror ran through the meeting.  Men\r\nwearing broken boots and with patches upon the seats and knees, and\r\nragged fringes round the bottoms of the legs of their trousers, grew\r\npale, and glanced apprehensively at each other.  If ever Socialism did\r\ncome to pass, they evidently thought it very probable that they would\r\nhave to walk about in a sort of prehistoric highland costume, without\r\nany trousers or boots at all.\r\n\r\nToil-worn women, most of them dressed in other women\'s shabby cast-off\r\nclothing--weary, tired-looking mothers who fed their children for the\r\nmost part on adulterated tea, tinned skimmed milk and bread and\r\nmargarine, grew furious as they thought of the wicked Socialists who\r\nwere trying to bring Ruin upon them.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to any of these poor people that they were in a\r\ncondition of Ruin, Black Ruin, already.  But if Sweater had suddenly\r\nfound himself reduced to the same social condition as the majority of\r\nthose he addressed, there is not much doubt that he would have thought\r\nthat he was in a condition of Black Ruin.\r\n\r\nThe awful silence that had fallen on the panic-stricken crowd, was\r\npresently broken by a ragged-trousered Philanthropist, who shouted out:\r\n\r\n\'We knows wot they are, sir.  Most of \'em is chaps wot\'s got tired of\r\nworkin\' for their livin\', so they wants us to keep \'em.\'\r\n\r\nEncouraged by numerous expressions of approval from the other\r\nPhilanthropists, the man continued:\r\n\r\n\'But we ain\'t such fools as they thinks, and so they\'ll find out next\r\nMonday.  Most of \'em wants \'angin\', and I wouldn\'t mind lendin\' a \'and\r\nwith the rope myself.\'\r\n\r\nApplause and laughter greeted these noble sentiments, and Sweater\r\nresumed his address, when another man--evidently a Socialist--for he\r\nwas accompanied by three or four others who like himself wore red\r\nties--interrupted and said that he would like to ask him a question.\r\nNo notice was taken of this request either by Mr Sweater or the\r\nchairman, but a few angry cries of \'Order!\' came from the crowd.\r\nSweater continued, but the man again interrupted and the cries of the\r\ncrowd became more threatening.  Rushton started up and said that he\r\ncould not allow the speaker to be interrupted, but if the gentleman\r\nwould wait till the end of the meeting, he would have an opportunity of\r\nasking his question then.\r\n\r\nThe man said he would wait as desired; Sweater resumed his oration, and\r\npresently the interrupter and his friends found themselves surrounded\r\nby the gang of hired bullies who wore the big rosettes and who glared\r\nmenacingly at them.\r\n\r\nSweater concluded his speech with an appeal to the crowd to deal a\r\n\'Slashing Bow at the Enemy\' next Monday, and then amid a storm of\r\napplause, Lord Ammenegg stepped to the front.  He said that he did not\r\nintend to inflict a long speech upon them that evening, and as it was\r\nnomination day tomorrow he would not be able to have the honour of\r\naddressing them again during the election; but even if he had wished to\r\nmake a long speech, it would be very difficult after the brilliant and\r\neloquent address they had just listened to from Mr Sweater, for it\r\nseemed to him (Ammenegg) that Adam Sweater had left nothing for anyone\r\nelse to say.  But he would like to tell them of a Thought that had\r\noccurred to him that evening.  They read in the Bible that the Wise Men\r\ncame from the East.  Windley, as they all knew, was the East end of the\r\ntown.  They were the men of the East, and he was sure that next Monday\r\nthey would prove that they were the Wise Men of the East, by voting for\r\nAdam Sweater and putting him at the top of the poll with a \'Thumping\r\nMajority\'.\r\n\r\nThe Wise Men of the East greeted Ammenegg\'s remarks with prolonged,\r\nimbecile cheers, and amid the tumult his Lordship and Sweater got into\r\nthe motor car and cleared off without giving the man with the red tie\r\nor anyone else who desired to ask questions any opportunity of doing\r\nso.  Rushton and the other leaders got into another motor car, and\r\nfollowed the first to take part in another meeting down-town, which was\r\nto be addressed by the great Sir Featherstone Blood.\r\n\r\nThe crowd now resolved itself into military order, headed by the men\r\nwith torches and a large white banner on which was written in huge\r\nblack letters, \'Our man is Adam Sweater\'.\r\n\r\nThey marched down the hill singing, and when they reached the Fountain\r\non the Grand Parade they saw another crowd holding a meeting there.\r\nThese were Tories and they became so infuriated at the sound of the\r\nLiberal songs and by the sight of the banner, that they abandoned their\r\nmeeting and charged the processionists.  A free fight ensued. Both\r\nsides fought like savages, but as the Liberals were outnumbered by\r\nabout three to one, they were driven off the field with great\r\nslaughter; most of the torch poles were taken from them, and the banner\r\nwas torn to ribbons.  Then the Tories went back to the Fountain\r\ncarrying the captured torches, and singing to the tune of \'Has anyone\r\nseen a German Band?\'\r\n\r\n        \'Has anyone seen a Lib\'ral Flag,\r\n        Lib\'ral Flag, Lib\'ral Flag?\'\r\n\r\nWhile the Tories resumed their meeting at the Fountain, the Liberals\r\nrallied in one of the back streets.  Messengers were sent in various\r\ndirections for reinforcements, and about half an hour afterwards they\r\nemerged from their retreat and swooped down upon the Tory meeting. They\r\noverturned the platform, recaptured their torches, tore the enemy\'s\r\nbanner to tatters and drove them from their position.  Then the\r\nLiberals in their turn paraded the streets singing \'Has anyone seen a\r\nTory Flag?\' and proceeded to the hall where Sir Featherstone was\r\nspeaking, arriving as the audience left.\r\n\r\nThe crowd that came pouring out of the hall was worked up to a frenzy\r\nof enthusiasm, for the speech they had just listened to had been a sort\r\nof manifesto to the country.\r\n\r\nIn response to the cheering of the processionists--who, of course, had\r\nnot heard the speech, but were cheering from force of habit--Sir\r\nFeatherstone Blood stood up in the carriage and addressed the crowd,\r\nbriefly outlining the great measures of Social Reform that his party\r\nproposed to enact to improve the condition of the working classes; and\r\nas they listened, the Wise Men grew delirious with enthusiasm.  He\r\nreferred to Land Taxes and Death Duties which would provide money to\r\nbuild battleships to protect the property of the rich, and provide Work\r\nfor the poor.  Another tax was to provide a nice, smooth road for the\r\nrich to ride upon in motor cars--and to provide Work for the poor.\r\nAnother tax would be used for Development, which would also make Work\r\nfor the poor.  And so on.  A great point was made of the fact that the\r\nrich were actually to be made to pay something towards the cost of\r\ntheir road themselves!  But nothing was said about how they would get\r\nthe money to do it.  No reference was made to how the workers would be\r\nsweated and driven and starved to earn Dividends and Rent and Interest\r\nand Profits to put into the pockets of the rich before the latter would\r\nbe able to pay for anything at all.\r\n\r\nThese are the things, Gentlemen, that we propose to do for you, and, at\r\nthe rate of progress which we propose to adopt, I say without fear or\r\ncontradiction, that within the next Five Hundred years we shall so\r\nreform social conditions in this country, that the working classes will\r\nbe able to enjoy some of the benefits of civilization.\r\n\r\n\'The only question before you is: Are you willing to wait for Five\r\nHundred Years?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' shouted the Wise Men with enthusiasm at the glorious\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Sir: we\'ll wait a thousand years if you like, Sir!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been waiting all my life,\' said one poor old veteran, who had\r\nassisted to \'carry the "Old Flag" to victory\' times out of number in\r\nthe past and who for his share of the spoils of those victories was now\r\nin a condition of abject, miserable poverty, with the portals of the\r\nworkhouse yawning open to receive him; \'I\'ve waited all my life, hoping\r\nand trusting for better conditions so a few more years won\'t make much\r\ndifference to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you trouble to \'urry yourself, Sir,\' shouted another Solomon in\r\nthe crowd.  \'We don\'t mind waiting.  Take your own time, Sir.  You know\r\nbetter than the likes of us \'ow long it ought to take.\'\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the great man warned them against being led away by the\r\nSocialists, those foolish, unreasonable, impractical people who wanted\r\nto see an immediate improvement in their condition; and he reminded\r\nthem that Rome was not built in a day.\r\n\r\nThe Wise Men applauded lustily.  It did not appear to occur to any of\r\nthem that the rate at which the ancient Roman conducted their building\r\noperations had nothing whatever to do with the case.\r\n\r\nSir Featherstone Blood sat down amid a wild storm of cheering, and then\r\nthe procession reformed, and, reinforced by the audience from the hall,\r\nthey proceeded to march about the dreary streets, singing, to the tune\r\nof the \'Men of Harlech\':\r\n\r\n        \'Vote for Sweater, Vote for Sweater!\r\n        Vote for Sweater, VOTE FOR SWEATER!\r\n        \'He\'s the Man, who has a plan,\r\n        To liberate and reinstate the workers!\r\n        \'Men of Mugs\'bro\', show your mettle,\r\n        Let them see that you\'re in fettle!\r\n        Once for all this question settle\r\n        Sweater shall Prevail!\'\r\n\r\nThe carriage containing Sir Featherstone, Adam Sweater, and Rushton and\r\nDidlum was in the middle of the procession.  The banner and the torches\r\nwere at the head, and the grandeur of the scene was heightened by four\r\nmen who walked--two on each side of the carriage, burning green fire in\r\nfrying pans.  As they passed by the Slave Market, a poor, shabbily\r\ndressed wretch whose boots were so worn and rotten that they were\r\nalmost falling off his feet, climbed up a lamp-post, and taking off his\r\ncap waved it in the air and shrieked out: \'Three Cheers for Sir\r\nFeatherstone Blood, our future Prime Minister!\'\r\n\r\nThe Philanthropists cheered themselves hoarse and finally took the\r\nhorses out of the traces and harnessed themselves to the carriage\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow much wages will Sir Featherstone get if \'e is made Prime\r\nMinister?\' asked Harlow of another Philanthropist who was also pushing\r\nup behind the carriage.\r\n\r\n\'Five thousand a year,\' replied the other, who by some strange chance\r\nhappened to know.  \'That comes to a \'underd pounds a week.\'\r\n\r\n\'Little enough, too, for a man like \'im,\' said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re right, mate,\' said the other, with deep sympathy in his voice.\r\n\'Last time \'e \'eld office \'e was only in for five years, so \'e only\r\nmade twenty-five thousand pounds out of it.  Of course \'e got a pension\r\nas well--two thousand a year for life, I think it is; but after all,\r\nwhat\'s that--for a man like \'im?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing,\' replied Harlow, in a tone of commiseration, and Newman, who\r\nwas also there, helping to drag the carriage, said that it ought to be\r\nat least double that amount.\r\n\r\nHowever, they found some consolation in knowing that Sir Featherstone\r\nwould not have to wait till he was seventy before he obtained his\r\npension; he would get it directly he came out of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following evening Barrington, Owen and a few others of the same way\r\nof thinking, who had subscribed enough money between them to purchase a\r\nlot of Socialist leaflets, employed themselves distributing them to the\r\ncrowds at the Liberal and Tory meetings, and whilst they were doing\r\nthis they frequently became involved in arguments with the supporters\r\nof the capitalist system.  In their attempts to persuade others to\r\nrefrain from voting for either of the candidates, they were opposed\r\neven by some who professed to believe in Socialism, who said that as\r\nthere was no better Socialist candidate the thing to do was to vote for\r\nthe better of the two.  This was the view of Harlow and Easton, whom\r\nthey met.  Harlow had a green ribbon in his buttonhole, but Easton wore\r\nD\'Encloseland\'s colours.\r\n\r\nOne man said that if he had his way, all those who had votes should be\r\ncompelled to record them--whether they liked it or not--or be\r\ndisenfranchised!  Barrington asked him if he believed in Tarrif Reform.\r\nThe man said no.\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\' demanded Barrington.\r\n\r\nThe other replied that he opposed Tariff Reform because he believed it\r\nwould ruin the country.  Barrington inquired if he were a supporter of\r\nSocialism.  The man said he was not, and when further questioned he\r\nsaid that he believed if it were ever adopted it would bring black ruin\r\nupon the country--he believed this because Mr Sweater had said so. When\r\nBarrington asked him--supposing there were only two candidates, one a\r\nSocialist and the other a Tariff Reformer--how would he like to be\r\ncompelled to vote for one of them, he was at a loss for an answer.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days the contest continued.  The hired orators\r\ncontinued to pour forth their streams of eloquence; and tons of\r\nliterature flooded the town.  The walls were covered with huge posters:\r\n\'Another Liberal Lie.\' \'Another Tory Fraud.\'\r\n\r\nUnconsciously each of these two parties put in some splendid work for\r\nSocialism, in so much that each of them thoroughly exposed the\r\nhypocrisy of the other.  If the people had only had the sense, they\r\nmight have seen that the quarrel between the Liberal and Tory leaders\r\nwas merely a quarrel between thieves over the spoil; but unfortunately\r\nmost of the people had not the sense to perceive this.  They were\r\nblinded by bigoted devotion to their parties, and--inflamed with\r\nmaniacal enthusiasm--thought of nothing but \'carrying their flags to\r\nvictory\'.\r\n\r\nAt considerable danger to themselves, Barrington, Owen and the other\r\nSocialists continued to distribute their leaflets and to heckle the\r\nLiberal and Tory speakers.  They asked the Tories to explain the\r\nprevalence of unemployment and poverty in protected countries, like\r\nGermany and America, and at Sweater\'s meetings they requested to be\r\ninformed what was the Liberal remedy for unemployment.  From both\r\nparties the Socialists obtained the same kinds of answer--threats of\r\nviolence and requests \'not to disturb the meeting\'.\r\n\r\nThese Socialists held quite a lot of informal meetings on their own.\r\nEvery now and then when they were giving their leaflets away, some\r\nunwary supporter of the capitalist system would start an argument, and\r\nsoon a crowd would gather round and listen.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Socialists succeeded in arguing their opponents to an\r\nabsolute standstill, for the Liberals and Tones found it impossible to\r\ndeny that machinery is the cause of the overcrowded state of the labour\r\nmarket; that the overcrowded labour market is the cause of\r\nunemployment; that the fact of there being always an army of unemployed\r\nwaiting to take other men\'s jobs away from them destroys the\r\nindependence of those who are in employment and keeps them in\r\nsubjection to their masters.  They found it impossible to deny that\r\nthis machinery is being used, not for the benefit of all, but to make\r\nfortunes for a few.  In short, they were unable to disprove that the\r\nmonopoly of the land and machinery by a comparatively few persons, is\r\nthe cause of the poverty of the majority.  But when these arguments\r\nthat they were unable to answer were put before them and when it was\r\npointed out that the only possible remedy was the Public Ownership and\r\nManagement of the Means of production, they remained angrily silent,\r\nhaving no alternative plan to suggest.\r\n\r\nAt other times the meeting resolved itself into a number of quarrelsome\r\ndisputes between the Liberals and Tories that formed the crowd, which\r\nsplit itself up into a lot of little groups and whatever the original\r\nsubject might have been they soon drifted to a hundred other things,\r\nfor most of the supporters of the present system seemed incapable of\r\npursuing any one subject to its logical conclusion.  A discussion would\r\nbe started about something or other; presently an unimportant side\r\nissue would crop up, then the original subject would be left\r\nunfinished, and they would argue and shout about the side issue.  In a\r\nlittle while another side issue would arise, and then the first side\r\nissue would be abandoned also unfinished, and an angry wrangle about\r\nthe second issue would ensue, the original subject being altogether\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nThey did not seem to really desire to discover the truth or to find out\r\nthe best way to bring about an improvement in their condition, their\r\nonly object seemed to be to score off their opponents.\r\n\r\nUsually after one of these arguments, Owen would wander off by himself,\r\nwith his head throbbing and a feeling of unutterable depression and\r\nmisery at his heart; weighed down by a growing conviction of the\r\nhopelessness of everything, of the folly of expecting that his fellow\r\nworkmen would ever be willing to try to understand for themselves the\r\ncauses that produced their sufferings. It was not that those causes\r\nwere so obscure that it required exceptional intelligence to perceive\r\nthem; the causes of all the misery were so apparent that a little child\r\ncould easily be made to understand both the disease and the remedy; but\r\nit seemed to him that the majority of his fellow workmen had become so\r\nconvinced of their own intellectual inferiority that they did not dare\r\nto rely on their own intelligence to guide them, preferring to resign\r\nthe management of their affairs unreservedly into the hands of those\r\nwho battened upon and robbed them.  They did not know the causes of the\r\npoverty that perpetually held them and their children in its cruel\r\ngrip, and--they did not want to know!  And if one explained those\r\ncauses to them in such language and in such a manner that they were\r\nalmost compelled to understand, and afterwards pointed out to them the\r\nobvious remedy, they were neither glad nor responsive, but remained\r\nsilent and were angry because they found themselves unable to answer\r\nand disprove.\r\n\r\nThey remained silent; afraid to trust their own intelligence, and the\r\nreason of this attitude was that they had to choose between the\r\nevidence and their own intelligence, and the stories told them by their\r\nmasters and exploiters.  And when it came to making this choice they\r\ndeemed it safer to follow their old guides, than to rely on their own\r\njudgement, because from their very infancy they had had drilled into\r\nthem the doctrine of their own mental and social inferiority, and their\r\nconviction of the truth of this doctrine was voiced in the degraded\r\nexpression that fell so frequently from their lips, when speaking of\r\nthemselves and each other--\'The Likes of Us!\'\r\n\r\nThey did not know the causes of their poverty, they did not want to\r\nknow, they did not want to hear.\r\n\r\nAll they desired was to be left alone so that they might continue to\r\nworship and follow those who took advantage of their simplicity, and\r\nrobbed them of the fruits of their toil; their old leaders, the fools\r\nor scoundrels who fed them with words, who had led them into the\r\ndesolation where they now seemed to be content to grind out treasure\r\nfor their masters, and to starve when those masters did not find it\r\nprofitable to employ them.  It was as if a flock of foolish sheep\r\nplaced themselves under the protection of a pack of ravening wolves.\r\n\r\nSeveral times the small band of Socialists narrowly escaped being\r\nmobbed, but they succeeded in disposing of most of their leaflets\r\nwithout any serious trouble.  Towards the latter part of one evening\r\nBarrington and Owen became separated from the others, and shortly\r\nafterwards these two lost each other in the crush.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o\'clock, Barrington was in a large Liberal crowd, listening\r\nto the same hired orator who had spoken a few evenings before on the\r\nhill--the man with the scar on his forehead.  The crowd was applauding\r\nhim loudly and Barrington again fell to wondering where he had seen\r\nthis man before.  As on the previous occasion, this speaker made no\r\nreference to Socialism, confining himself to other matters. Barrington\r\nexamined him closely, trying to recall under what circumstances they\r\nhad met previously, and presently he remembered that this was one of\r\nthe Socialists who had come with the band of cyclists into the town\r\nthat Sunday morning, away back at the beginning of the summer, the man\r\nwho had come afterwards with the van, and who had been struck down by a\r\nstone while attempting to speak from the platform of the van, the man\r\nwho had been nearly killed by the upholders of the capitalist system.\r\nIt was the same man!  The Socialist had been clean-shaven--this man\r\nwore beard and moustache--but Barrington was certain he was the same.\r\n\r\nWhen the man had concluded his speech he got down and stood in the\r\nshade behind the platform, while someone else addressed the meeting,\r\nand Barrington went round to where he was standing, intending to speak\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nAll around them, pandemonium reigned supreme.  They were in the\r\nvicinity of the Slave Market, near the Fountain, on the Grand Parade,\r\nwhere several roads met; there was a meeting going on at every corner,\r\nand a number of others in different parts of the roadway and on the\r\npavement of the Parade. Some of these meetings were being carried on by\r\ntwo or three men, who spoke in turn from small, portable platforms they\r\ncarried with them, and placed wherever they thought there was a chance\r\nof getting an audience.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then some of these poor wretches--they were all paid\r\nspeakers--were surrounded and savagely mauled and beaten by a hostile\r\ncrowd.  If they were Tariff Reformers the Liberals mobbed them, and\r\nvice versa.  Lines of rowdies swaggered to and fro, arm in arm,\r\nsinging, \'Vote, Vote, Vote, for good ole Closeland\' or \'good ole\r\nSweater\', according as they were green or blue and yellow.  Gangs of\r\nhooligans paraded up and down, armed with sticks, singing, howling,\r\ncursing and looking for someone to hit.  Others stood in groups on the\r\npavement with their hands thrust in their pockets, or leaned against\r\nwalls or the shutters of the shops with expressions of ecstatic\r\nimbecility on their faces, chanting the mournful dirge to the tune of\r\nthe church chimes,\r\n\r\n        \'Good--ole--Sweat--er\r\n        Good--ole--Sweat--er\r\n        Good--ole--Sweat--er\r\n        Good--ole--Sweat--er.\'\r\n\r\nOther groups--to the same tune--sang \'Good--ole--Close--land\'; and\r\nevery now and again they used to leave off singing and begin to beat\r\neach other.  Fights used to take place, often between workmen, about\r\nthe respective merits of Adam Sweater and Sir Graball D\'Encloseland.\r\n\r\nThe walls were covered with huge Liberal and Tory posters, which showed\r\nin every line the contempt of those who published them for the\r\nintelligence of the working men to whom they were addressed.  There was\r\none Tory poster that represented the interior of a public house; in\r\nfront of the bar, with a quart pot in his hand, a clay pipe in his\r\nmouth, and a load of tools on his back, stood a degraded-looking brute\r\nwho represented the Tory ideal of what an Englishman should be; the\r\nletterpress on the poster said it was a man!  This is the ideal of\r\nmanhood that they hold up to the majority of their fellow countrymen,\r\nbut privately--amongst themselves--the Tory aristocrats regard such\r\n\'men\' with far less respect than they do the lower animals.  Horses or\r\ndogs, for instance.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal posters were not quite so offensive.  They were more\r\ncunning, more specious, more hypocritical and consequently more\r\ncalculated to mislead and deceive the more intelligent of the voters.\r\n\r\nWhen Barrington got round to the back of the platform, he found the man\r\nwith the scarred face standing alone and gloomily silent in the shadow.\r\nBarrington gave him one of the Socialist leaflets, which he took, and\r\nafter glancing at it, put it in his coat pocket without making any\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n\'I hope you\'ll excuse me for asking, but were you not formerly a\r\nSocialist?\' said Barrington.\r\n\r\nEven in the semi-darkness Barrington saw the other man flush deeply and\r\nthen become very pale, and the unsightly scar upon his forehead showed\r\nwith ghastly distinctiveness.\r\n\r\n\'I am still a Socialist: no man who has once been a Socialist can ever\r\ncease to be one.\'\r\n\r\n\'You seem to have accomplished that impossibility, to judge by the work\r\nyou are at present engaged in.  You must have changed your opinions\r\nsince you were here last.\'\r\n\r\n\'No one who has been a Socialist can ever cease to be one.  It is\r\nimpossible for a man who has once acquired knowledge ever to relinquish\r\nit.  A Socialist is one who understands the causes of the misery and\r\ndegradation we see all around us; who knows the only remedy, and knows\r\nthat that remedy--the state of society that will be called\r\nSocialism--must eventually be adopted; is the only alternative to the\r\nextermination of the majority of the working people; but it does not\r\nfollow that everyone who has sense enough to acquire that amount of\r\nknowledge, must, in addition, be willing to sacrifice himself in order\r\nto help to bring that state of society into being. When I first\r\nacquired that knowledge,\' he continued, bitterly, \'I was eager to tell\r\nthe good news to others.  I sacrificed my time, my money, and my health\r\nin order that I might teach others what I had learned myself.  I did it\r\nwillingly and happily, because I thought they would be glad to hear,\r\nand that they were worth the sacrifices I made for their sakes.  But I\r\nknow better now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Even if you no longer believe in working for Socialism, there\'s no\r\nneed to work AGAINST it.  If you are not disposed to sacrifice yourself\r\nin order to do good to others, you might at least refrain from doing\r\nevil.  If you don\'t want to help to bring about a better state of\r\naffairs, there\'s no reason why you should help to perpetuate the\r\npresent system.\'\r\n\r\nThe other man laughed bitterly.  \'Oh yes, there is, and a very good\r\nreason too.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think you could show me a reason,\' said Barrington.\r\n\r\nThe man with the scar laughed again, the same unpleasant, mirthless\r\nlaugh, and thrusting his hand into his trouser pocket drew it out again\r\nfull of silver coins, amongst which one or two gold pieces glittered.\r\n\r\n\'That is my reason.  When I devoted my life and what abilities I\r\npossess to the service of my fellow workmen; when I sought to teach\r\nthem how to break their chains; when I tried to show them how they\r\nmight save their children from poverty and shameful servitude, I did\r\nnot want them to give me money.  I did it for love.  And they paid me\r\nwith hatred and injury.  But since I have been helping their masters to\r\nrob them, they have treated me with respect.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington made no reply and the other man, having returned the money\r\nto his pocket, indicated the crowd with a sweep of his hand.\r\n\r\n\'Look at them!\' he continued with a contemptuous laugh.  \'Look at them!\r\nthe people you are trying to make idealists of!  Look at them! Some of\r\nthem howling and roaring like wild beasts, or laughing like idiots,\r\nothers standing with dull and stupid faces devoid of any trace of\r\nintelligence or expression, listening to the speakers whose words\r\nconvey no meaning to their stultified minds, and others with their eyes\r\ngleaming with savage hatred of their fellow men, watching eagerly for\r\nan opportunity to provoke a quarrel that they may gratify their brutal\r\nnatures by striking someone--their eyes are hungry for the sight of\r\nblood!  Can\'t you see that these people, whom you are trying to make\r\nunderstand your plan for the regeneration of the world, your doctrine\r\nof universal brotherhood and love are for the most\r\npart--intellectually--on a level with Hottentots?  The only things they\r\nfeel any real interest in are beer, football, betting and--of\r\ncourse--one other subject.  Their highest ambition is to be allowed to\r\nWork.  And they desire nothing better for their children!\r\n\r\n\'They have never had an independent thought in their lives.  These are\r\nthe people whom you hope to inspire with lofty ideals!  You might just\r\nas well try to make a gold brooch out of a lump of dung!  Try to reason\r\nwith them, to uplift them, to teach them the way to higher things.\r\nDevote your whole life and intelligence to the work of trying to get\r\nbetter conditions for them, and you will find that they themselves are\r\nthe enemy you will have to fight against.  They\'ll hate you, and, if\r\nthey get the chance, they\'ll tear you to pieces.  But if you\'re a\r\nsensible man you\'ll use whatever talents and intelligence you possess\r\nfor your own benefit.  Don\'t think about Socialism or any other "ism".\r\nConcentrate your mind on getting money--it doesn\'t matter how you get\r\nit, but--get it.  If you can\'t get it honestly, get it dishonestly, but\r\nget it! it is the only thing that counts.  Do as I do--rob them!\r\nexploit them! and then they\'ll have some respect for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s something in what you say,\' replied Barrington, after a long\r\npause, \'but it\'s not all.  Circumstances make us what we are; and\r\nanyhow, the children are worth fighting for.\'\r\n\r\n\'You may think so now,\' said the other, \'but you\'ll come to see it my\r\nway some day.  As for the children--if their parents are satisfied to\r\nlet them grow up to be half-starved drudges for other people, I don\'t\r\nsee why you or I need trouble about it.  If you like to listen to\r\nreason,\' he continued after a pause, \'I can put you on to something\r\nthat will be worth more to you than all your Socialism.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Look here: you\'re a Socialist; well, I\'m a Socialist too: that is, I\r\nhave sense enough to believe that Socialism is practical and inevitable\r\nand right; it will come when the majority of the people are\r\nsufficiently enlightened to demand it, but that enlightenment will\r\nnever be brought about by reasoning or arguing with them, for these\r\npeople are simply not intellectually capable of abstract\r\nreasoning--they can\'t grasp theories.  You know what the late Lord\r\nSalisbury said about them when somebody proposed to give them some free\r\nlibraries: He said: "They don\'t want libraries: give them a circus."\r\nYou see these Liberals and Tories understand the sort of people they\r\nhave to deal with; they know that although their bodies are the bodies\r\nof grown men, their minds are the minds of little children.  That is\r\nwhy it has been possible to deceive and bluff and rob them for so long.\r\nBut your party persists in regarding them as rational beings, and\r\nthat\'s where you make a mistake--you\'re simply wasting your time.\r\n\r\n\'The only way in which it is possible to teach these people is by means\r\nof object lessons, and those are being placed before them in increasing\r\nnumbers every day.  The trustification of industry--the object lesson\r\nwhich demonstrates the possibility of collective ownership--will in\r\ntime compel even these to understand, and by the time they have learnt\r\nthat, they will also have learned by bitter experience and not from\r\ntheoretical teaching, that they must either own the trusts or perish,\r\nand then, and not, till then, they will achieve Socialism.  But\r\nmeanwhile we have this election.  Do you think it will make any real\r\ndifference--for good or evil--which of these two men is elected?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you can\'t keep them both out--you have no candidate of your\r\nown--why should you object to earning a few pounds by helping one of\r\nthem to get in?  There are plenty of voters who are doubtful what to\r\ndo; as you and I know there is every excuse for them being unable to\r\nmake up their minds which of these two candidates is the worse, a word\r\nfrom your party would decide them.  Since you have no candidate of your\r\nown you will be doing no harm to Socialism and you will be doing\r\nyourself a bit of good.  If you like to come along with me now, I\'ll\r\nintroduce you to Sweater\'s agent--no one need know anything about it.\'\r\n\r\nHe slipped his arm through Barrington\'s, but the latter released\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\'Please yourself,\' said the other with an affectation of indifference.\r\n\'You know your own business best.  You may choose to be a Jesus Christ\r\nif you like, but for my part I\'m finished.  For the future I intend to\r\nlook after myself.  As for these people--they vote for what they want;\r\nthey get--what they vote for; and by God, they deserve nothing better!\r\nThey are being beaten with whips of their own choosing and if I had my\r\nway they should be chastised with scorpions!  For them, the present\r\nsystem means joyless drudgery, semi-starvation, rags and premature\r\ndeath.  They vote for it all and uphold it.  Well, let them have what\r\nthey vote for--let them drudge--let them starve!\'\r\n\r\nThe man with the scarred face ceased speaking, and for some moments\r\nBarrington did not reply.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose there is some excuse for your feeling as you do,\' he said\r\nslowly at last, \'but it seems to me that you do not make enough\r\nallowance for the circumstances.  From their infancy most of them have\r\nbeen taught by priests and parents to regard themselves and their own\r\nclass with contempt--a sort of lower animals--and to regard those who\r\npossess wealth with veneration, as superior beings.  The idea that they\r\nare really human creatures, naturally absolutely the same as their\r\nso-called betters, naturally equal in every way, naturally different\r\nfrom them only in those ways in which their so-called superiors differ\r\nfrom each other, and inferior to them only because they have been\r\ndeprived of education, culture and opportunity--you know as well as I\r\ndo that they have all been taught to regard that idea as preposterous.\r\n\r\n\'The self-styled "Christian" priests who say--with their tongues in\r\ntheir cheeks--that God is our Father and that all men are brethren,\r\nhave succeeded in convincing the majority of the "brethren" that it is\r\ntheir duty to be content in their degradation, and to order themselves\r\nlowly and reverently towards their masters.  Your resentment should be\r\ndirected against the deceivers, not against the dupes.\'\r\n\r\nThe other man laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\'Well, go and try to undeceive them,\' he said, as he returned to the\r\nplatform in response to a call from his associates.  \'Go and try to\r\nteach them that the Supreme Being made the earth and all its fullness\r\nfor the use and benefit of all His children.  Go and try to explain to\r\nthem that they are poor in body and mind and social condition, not\r\nbecause of any natural inferiority, but because they have been robbed\r\nof their inheritance.  Go and try to show them how to secure that\r\ninheritance for themselves and their children--and see how grateful\r\nthey\'ll be to you.\'\r\n\r\nFor the next hour Barrington walked about the crowded streets in a\r\ndispirited fashion.  His conversation with the renegade seemed to have\r\ntaken all the heart out of him.  He still had a number of the leaflets,\r\nbut the task of distributing them had suddenly grown distasteful and\r\nafter a while he discontinued it.  All his enthusiasm was gone.  Like\r\none awakened from a dream he saw the people who surrounded him in a\r\ndifferent light.  For the first time he properly appreciated the\r\noffensiveness of most of those to whom he offered the handbills; some,\r\nwithout even troubling to ascertain what they were about, rudely\r\nrefused to accept them; some took them and after glancing at the\r\nprinting, crushed them in their hands and ostentatiously threw them\r\naway.  Others, who recognized him as a Socialist, angrily or\r\ncontemptuously declined them, often with curses or injurious words.\r\n\r\nHis attention was presently attracted to a crowd of about thirty or\r\nforty people, congregated near a gas lamp at the roadside.  The sound\r\nof many angry voices rose from the centre of this group, and as he\r\nstood on the outskirts of the crowd, Barrington, being tall, was able\r\nto look into the centre, where he saw Owen.  The light of the street\r\nlamp fell full upon the latter\'s pale face, as he stood silent in the\r\nmidst of a ring of infuriated men, who were all howling at him at once,\r\nand whose malignant faces bore expressions of savage hatred, as they\r\nshouted out the foolish accusations and slanders they had read in the\r\nLiberal and Tory papers.\r\n\r\nSocialists wished to do away with religion and morality! to establish\r\nfree love and atheism!  All the money that the working classes had\r\nsaved up in the Post Office and the Friendly Societies, was to be\r\nRobbed from them and divided up amongst a lot of drunken loafers who\r\nwere too lazy to work.  The King and all the Royal Family were to be\r\nDone Away with! and so on.\r\n\r\nOwen made no attempt to reply, and the manner of the crowd became every\r\nmoment more threatening.  It was evident that several of them found it\r\ndifficult to refrain from attacking him.  It was a splendid opportunity\r\nof doing a little fighting without running any risks. This fellow was\r\nall by himself, and did not appear to be much of a man even at that.\r\nThose in the middle were encouraged by shouts from others in the crowd,\r\nwho urged them to \'Go for him\' and at last--almost at the instant of\r\nBarrington\'s arrival--one of the heroes, unable to contain himself any\r\nlonger, lifted a heavy stick and struck Owen savagely across the face.\r\nThe sight of the blood maddened the others, and in an instant everyone\r\nwho could get within striking distance joined furiously in the\r\nonslaught, reaching eagerly over each other\'s shoulders, showering\r\nblows upon him with sticks and fists, and before Barrington could reach\r\nhis side, they had Owen down on the ground, and had begun to use their\r\nboots upon him.\r\n\r\nBarrington felt like a wild beast himself, as he fiercely fought his\r\nway through the crowd, spurning them to right and left with fists and\r\nelbows.  He reached the centre in time to seize the uplifted arm of the\r\nman who had led the attack and wrenching the stick from his hand, he\r\nfelled him to the ground with a single blow.  The remainder shrank\r\nback, and meantime the crowd was augmented by others who came running\r\nup.\r\n\r\nSome of these newcomers were Liberals and some Tories, and as these did\r\nnot know what the row was about they attacked each other.  The Liberals\r\nwent for those who wore Tory colours and vice versa, and in a few\r\nseconds there was a general free fight, though most of the original\r\ncrowd ran away, and in the confusion that ended, Barrington and Owen\r\ngot out of the crowd without further molestation.\r\n\r\nMonday was the last day of the election--polling day--and in\r\nconsequence of the number of motor cars that were flying about, the\r\nstreets were hardly safe for ordinary traffic.  The wealthy persons who\r\nowned these carriages...\r\n\r\nThe result of the poll was to be shown on an illuminated sign at the\r\nTown Hall, at eleven o\'clock that night, and long before that hour a\r\nvast crowd gathered in the adjacent streets.  About ten o\'clock it\r\nbegan to rain, but the crowd stood its ground and increased in numbers\r\nas the time went by.  At a quarter to eleven the rain increased to a\r\nterrible downpour, but the people remained waiting to know which hero\r\nhad conquered.  Eleven o\'clock came and an intense silence fell upon\r\nthe crowd, whose eyes were fixed eagerly upon the window where the sign\r\nwas to be exhibited.  To judge by the extraordinary interest displayed\r\nby these people, one might have thought that they expected to reap some\r\ngreat benefit or to sustain some great loss from the result, but of\r\ncourse that was not the case, for most of them knew perfectly well that\r\nthe result of this election would make no more real difference to them\r\nthan all the other elections that had gone before.\r\n\r\nThey wondered what the figures would be.  There were ten thousand\r\nvoters on the register.  At a quarter past eleven the sign was\r\nilluminated, but the figures were not yet shown.  Next, the names of\r\nthe two candidates were slid into sight, the figures were still\r\nmissing, but D\'Encloseland\'s name was on top, and a hoarse roar of\r\ntriumph came from the throats of his admirers.  Then the two slides\r\nwith the names were withdrawn, and the sign was again left blank. After\r\na time the people began to murmur at all this delay and messing about,\r\nand presently some of them began to groan and hoot.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes the names were again slid into view, this time with\r\nSweater\'s name on top, and the figures appeared immediately afterwards:\r\n\r\n        Sweater . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,221\r\n        D\'Encloseland . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,200\r\n\r\nIt was several seconds before the Liberals could believe their eyes; it\r\nwas too good to be true.  It is impossible to say what was the reason\r\nof the wild outburst of delighted enthusiasm that followed, but\r\nwhatever the reason, whatever the benefit was that they expected to\r\nreap--there was the fact.  They were all cheering and dancing and\r\nshaking hands with each other, and some of them were so overcome with\r\ninexplicable joy that they were scarcely able to speak.  It was\r\naltogether extraordinary and unaccountable.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after the declaration, Sweater appeared at the window and\r\nmade a sort of a speech, but only fragments of it were audible to the\r\ncheering crowd who at intervals caught such phrases as \'Slashing Blow\',\r\n\'Sweep the Country\', \'Grand Old Liberal Flag\', and so on.  Next\r\nD\'Encloseland appeared and he was seen to shake hands with Mr Sweater,\r\nwhom he referred to as \'My friend\'.\r\n\r\nWhen the two \'friends\' disappeared from the window, the part of the\r\nLiberal crowd that was not engaged in hand-to-hand fights with their\r\nenemies--the Tories--made a rush to the front entrance of the Town\r\nHall, where Sweater\'s carriage was waiting, and as soon as he had\r\nplaced his plump rotundity inside, they took the horses out and amid\r\nfrantic cheers harnessed themselves to it instead and dragged it\r\nthrough the mud and the pouring rain all the way to \'The Cave\'--most of\r\nthem were accustomed to acting as beasts of burden--where he again\r\naddressed a few words to them from the porch.\r\n\r\nAfterwards as they walked home saturated with rain and covered from\r\nhead to foot with mud, they said it was a great victory for the cause\r\nof progress!\r\n\r\nTruly the wolves have an easy prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 49\r\n\r\nThe Undesired\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening about seven o\'clock, whilst Easton was down-town seeing\r\nthe last of the election, Ruth\'s child was born.\r\n\r\nAfter the doctor was gone, Mary Linden stayed with her during the hours\r\nthat elapsed before Easton came home, and downstairs Elsie and\r\nCharley--who were allowed to stay up late to help their mother because\r\nMrs Easton was ill--crept about very quietly, and conversed in hushed\r\ntones as they washed up the tea things and swept the floor and tidied\r\nthe kitchen.\r\n\r\nEaston did not return until after midnight, and all through the\r\nintervening hours, Ruth, weak and tired, but unable to sleep, was lying\r\nin bed with the child by her side.  Her wide-open eyes appeared\r\nunnaturally large and brilliant, in contrast with the almost death-like\r\npaleness of her face, and there was a look of fear in them, as she\r\nwaited and listened for the sound of Easton\'s footsteps.\r\n\r\nOutside, the silence of the night was disturbed by many unusual noises:\r\na far-off roar, as of the breaking of waves on a seashore, arose from\r\nthe direction of the town, where the last scenes of the election were\r\nbeing enacted.  Every few minutes motor cars rushed past the house at a\r\nfurious rate, and the air was full of the sounds of distant shouts and\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\nRuth listened and started nervously at every passing footstep.  Those\r\nwho can imagine the kind of expression there would be upon the face of\r\na hunted thief, who, finding himself encompassed and brought to bay by\r\nhis pursuers, looks wildly around in a vain search for some way of\r\nescape, may be able to form some conception of the terror-stricken way\r\nin which she listened to every sound that penetrated into the stillness\r\nof the dimly lighted room.  And ever and again, when her wandering\r\nglance reverted to the frail atom of humanity nestling by her side, her\r\nbrows contracted and her eyes filled with bitter tears, as she weakly\r\nreached out her trembling hand to adjust its coverings, faintly\r\nmurmuring, with quivering lips and a bursting heart, some words of\r\nendearment and pity.  And then--alarmed by the footsteps of some chance\r\npasserby, or by the closing of the door of a neighbouring house, and\r\nfearing that it was the sound she had been waiting for and dreading\r\nthrough all those weary hours, she would turn in terror to Mary Linden,\r\nsitting in the chair at the bedside, sewing by the light of the shaded\r\nlamp, and take hold of her arm as if seeking protection from some\r\nimpending danger.\r\n\r\nIt was after twelve o\'clock when Easton came home.  Ruth recognized his\r\nfootsteps before he reached the house, and her heart seemed to stop\r\nbeating when she heard the clang of the gate, as it closed after he had\r\npassed through.\r\n\r\nIt had been Mary\'s intention to withdraw before he came into the room,\r\nbut the sick woman clung to her in such evident fear, and entreated her\r\nso earnestly not to go away, that she remained.\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling of keen disappointment that Easton noticed how\r\nRuth shrank away from him, for he had expected and hoped, that after\r\nthis, they would be good friends once more; but he tried to think that\r\nit was because she was ill, and when she would not let him touch the\r\nchild lest he should awaken it, he agreed without question.\r\n\r\nThe next day, and for the greater part of the time during the next\r\nfortnight, Ruth was in a raging fever.  There were intervals when\r\nalthough weak and exhausted, she was in her right mind, but most of the\r\ntime she was quite unconscious of her surroundings and often delirious.\r\nMrs Owen came every day to help to look after her, because Mary just\r\nthen had a lot of needlework to do, and consequently could only give\r\npart of her time to Ruth, who, in her delirium, lived and told over and\r\nover again all the sorrow and suffering of the last few months.  And so\r\nthe two friends, watching by her bedside, learned her dreadful secret.\r\n\r\nSometimes--in her delirium--she seemed possessed of an intense and\r\nterrible loathing for the poor little creature she had brought into the\r\nworld, and was with difficulty prevented from doing it violence. Once\r\nshe seized it cruelly and threw it fiercely from her to the foot of the\r\nbed, as if it had been some poisonous or loathsome thing.  And so it\r\noften became necessary to take the child away out of the room, so that\r\nshe could not see or hear it, but when her senses came back to her, her\r\nfirst thought was for the child, and there must have been in her mind\r\nsome faint recollection of what she had said and done in her madness,\r\nfor when she saw that the baby was not in its accustomed place her\r\ndistress and alarm were painful to see, as she entreated them with\r\ntears to give it back to her.  And then she would kiss and fondle it\r\nwith all manner of endearing words, and cry bitterly.\r\n\r\nEaston did not see or hear most of this; he only knew that she was very\r\nill; for he went out every day on the almost hopeless quest for work.\r\nRushton\'s had next to nothing to do, and most of the other shops were\r\nin a similar plight.  Dauber and Botchit had one or two jobs going on,\r\nand Easton tried several times to get a start for them, but was always\r\ntold they were full up.  The sweating methods of this firm continued to\r\nform a favourite topic of conversation with the unemployed workmen, who\r\nrailed at and cursed them horribly.  It had leaked out that they were\r\npaying only sixpence an hour to most of the skilled workmen in their\r\nemployment, and even then the conditions under which they worked were,\r\nif possible, worse than those obtaining at most other firms.  The men\r\nwere treated like so many convicts, and every job was a hell where\r\ndriving and bullying reigned supreme, and obscene curses and blasphemy\r\npolluted the air from morning till night. The resentment of those who\r\nwere out of work was directed, not only against the heads of the firm,\r\nbut also against the miserable, half-starved drudges in their\r\nemployment.  These poor wretches were denounced as \'scabs\' and\r\n\'wastrels\' by the unemployed workmen but all the same, whenever Dauber\r\nand Botchit wanted some extra hands they never had any difficulty in\r\nobtaining them, and it often happened that those who had been loudest\r\nand bitterest in their denunciations were amongst the first to rush off\r\neagerly to apply there for a job whenever there was a chance of getting\r\none.\r\n\r\nFrequently the light was seen burning late at night in Rushton\'s\r\noffice, where Nimrod and his master were figuring out prices and\r\nwriting out estimates, cutting down the amounts to the lowest possible\r\npoint in the hope of underbidding their rivals.  Now and then they were\r\nsuccessful but whether they secured the work or not, Nimrod always\r\nappeared equally miserable.  If they got the \'job\' it often showed such\r\na small margin of profit that Rushton used to grumble at him and\r\nsuggest mismanagement.  If their estimates were too high and they lost\r\nthe work, he used to demand of Nimrod why it was possible for Dauber\r\nand Botchit to do work so much more cheaply.\r\n\r\nAs the unemployed workmen stood in groups at the corners or walked\r\naimlessly about the streets, they often saw Hunter pass by on his\r\nbicycle, looking worried and harassed.  He was such a picture of\r\nmisery, that it began to be rumoured amongst the men, that he had never\r\nbeen the same since the time he had that fall off the bike; and some of\r\nthem declared, that they wouldn\'t mind betting that ole Misery would\r\nfinish up by going off his bloody rocker.\r\n\r\nAt intervals--whenever a job came in--Owen, Crass, Slyme, Sawkins and\r\none or two others, continued to be employed at Rushton\'s, but they\r\nseldom managed to make more than two or three days a week, even when\r\nthere was anything to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 50\r\n\r\nSundered\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next few weeks Ruth continued very ill.  Although the\r\ndelirium had left her and did not return, her manner was still very\r\nstrange, and it was remarkable that she slept but little and at long\r\nintervals.  Mrs Owen came to look after her every day, not going back\r\nto her own home till the evening.  Frankie used to call for her as he\r\ncame out of school and then they used to go home together, taking\r\nlittle Freddie Easton with them also, for his own mother was not able\r\nto look after him and Mary Linden had so much other work to do.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday evening, when the child was about five weeks old, as Mrs\r\nOwen was wishing her good night, Ruth took hold of her hand and after\r\nsaying how grateful she was for all that she had done, she asked\r\nwhether--supposing anything happened to herself--Nora would promise to\r\ntake charge of Freddie for Easton.  Owen\'s wife gave the required\r\npromise, at the same time affecting to regard the supposition as\r\naltogether unlikely, and assuring her that she would soon be better,\r\nbut she secretly wondered why Ruth had not mentioned the other child as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nNora went away about five o\'clock, leaving Ruth\'s bedroom door open so\r\nthat Mrs Linden could hear her call if she needed anything.  About a\r\nquarter of an hour after Nora and the two children had gone, Mary\r\nLinden went upstairs to see Ruth, who appeared to have fallen fast\r\nasleep; so she returned to her needlework downstairs.  The weather had\r\nbeen very cloudy all day, there had been rain at intervals and it was a\r\ndark evening, so dark that she had to light the lamp to see her work.\r\nCharley sat on the hearthrug in front of the fire repairing one of the\r\nwheels of a wooden cart that he had made with the assistance of another\r\nboy, and Elsie busied herself preparing the tea.\r\n\r\nEaston was not yet home; Rushton & Co. had a few jobs to do and he had\r\nbeen at work since the previous Thursday.  The place where he was\r\nworking was some considerable distance away, so it was nearly half past\r\nsix when he came home.  They heard him at the gate and at her mother\'s\r\ndirection Elsie went quickly to the front door, which was ajar, to ask\r\nhim to walk as quietly as possible so as not to wake Ruth.\r\n\r\nMary had prepared the table for his tea in the kitchen, where there was\r\na bright fire with the kettle singing on the hob.  He lit the lamp and\r\nafter removing his hat and overcoat, put the kettle on the fire and\r\nwhile he was waiting for it to boil he went softly upstairs. There was\r\nno lamp burning in the bedroom and the place would have been in utter\r\ndarkness but for the red glow of the fire, which did not dispel the\r\nprevailing obscurity sufficiently to enable him to discern the\r\ndifferent objects in the room distinctly.  The intense silence that\r\nreigned struck him with a sudden terror.  He crossed swiftly over to\r\nthe bed and a moment\'s examination sufficed to tell him that it was\r\nempty.  He called her name, but there was no answer, and a hurried\r\nsearch only made it certain that she was nowhere in the house.\r\n\r\nMrs Linden now remembered what Owen\'s wife had told her of the strange\r\nrequest that Ruth had made, and as she recounted it to Easton, his\r\nfears became intensified a thousandfold.  He was unable to form any\r\nopinion of the reason of her going or of where she had gone, as he\r\nrushed out to seek for her.  Almost unconsciously he directed his steps\r\nto Owen\'s house, and afterwards the two men went to every place where\r\nthey thought it possible she might have gone, but without finding any\r\ntrace of her.\r\n\r\nHer father lived a short distance outside the town, and this was one of\r\nthe first places they went to, although Easton did not think it likely\r\nshe would go there, for she had not been on friendly terms with her\r\nstepmother, and as he had anticipated, it was a fruitless journey.\r\n\r\nThey sought for her in every conceivable place, returning often to\r\nEaston\'s house to see if she had come home, but they found no trace of\r\nher, nor met anyone who had seen her, which was, perhaps, because the\r\ndreary, rain-washed streets were deserted by all except those whose\r\nbusiness compelled them to be out.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o\'clock Nora was standing at the front door waiting for\r\nOwen and Easton, when she thought she could discern a woman\'s figure in\r\nthe shadow of the piers of the gate opposite.  It was an unoccupied\r\nhouse with a garden in front, and the outlines of the bushes it\r\ncontained were so vague in the darkness that it was impossible to be\r\ncertain; but the longer she looked the more convinced she became that\r\nthere was someone there.  At last she summoned sufficient courage to\r\ncross over the road, and as she nervously drew near the gate it became\r\nevident that she had not been mistaken.  There was a woman standing\r\nthere--a woman with a child in her arms, leaning against one of the\r\npillars and holding the iron bars of the gate with her left hand.  It\r\nwas Ruth.  Nora recognized her even in the semi-darkness.  Her attitude\r\nwas one of extreme exhaustion, and as Nora touched her, she perceived\r\nthat she was wet through and trembling; but although she was almost\r\nfainting with fatigue she would not consent to go indoors until\r\nrepeatedly assured that Easton was not there, and that Nora would not\r\nlet him see her if he came.  And when at length she yielded and went\r\ninto the house she would not sit down or take off her hat or jacket\r\nuntil--crouching on the floor beside Nora\'s chair with her face hidden\r\nin the latter\'s lap--she had sobbed out her pitiful confession, the\r\nsame things that she had unwittingly told to the same hearer so often\r\nbefore during the illness, the only fact that was new was the account\r\nof her wanderings that night.\r\n\r\nShe cried so bitterly and looked so forlorn and heartbroken and ashamed\r\nas she faltered out her woeful story; so consumed with\r\nself-condemnation, making no excuse for herself except to repeat over\r\nand over again that she had never meant to do wrong, that Nora could\r\nnot refrain from weeping also as she listened.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that, unable to bear the reproach that Easton\'s presence\r\nseemed to imply, or to endure the burden of her secret any longer, and\r\nalways haunted by the thought of the lake in the park, Ruth had formed\r\nthe dreadful resolution of taking her own life and the child\'s.  When\r\nshe arrived at the park gates they were closed and locked for the night\r\nbut she remembered that there was another means of entering--the place\r\nat the far end of the valley where the park was not fenced in, so she\r\nhad gone there--nearly three miles--only to find that railings had\r\nrecently been erected and therefore it was no longer possible to get\r\ninto the park by that way.  And then, when she found it impossible to\r\nput her resolve into practice, she had realized for the first time the\r\nfolly and wickedness of the act she had meant to commit.  But although\r\nshe had abandoned her first intention, she said she could never go home\r\nagain; she would take a room somewhere and get some work to do, or\r\nperhaps she might be able to get a situation where they would allow her\r\nto have the child with her, or failing that she would work and pay\r\nsomeone to look after it; but she could never go home any more.  If she\r\nonly had somewhere to stay for a few days until she could get something\r\nto do, she was sure she would be able to earn her living, but she could\r\nnot go back home; she felt that she would rather walk about the streets\r\nall night than go there again.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that Ruth should have the small apartment which had\r\nbeen Frankie\'s playroom, the necessary furniture being obtained from a\r\nsecond-hand shop close by.  Easton did not learn the real reason of her\r\nflight until three days afterwards.  At first he attributed it to a\r\nrecurrence of the mental disorder that she had suffered from after the\r\nbirth of the child, and he had been glad to leave her at Owen\'s place\r\nin Nora\'s care, but on the evening of the third day when he returned\r\nhome from work, he found a letter in Ruth\'s handwriting which told him\r\nall there was to tell.\r\n\r\nWhen he recovered from the stupefaction into which he was thrown by the\r\nperusal of this letter, his first thought was to seek out Slyme, but he\r\nfound upon inquiring that the latter had left the town the previous\r\nmorning.  Slyme\'s landlady said he had told her that he had been\r\noffered several months\' work in London, which he had accepted. The\r\ntruth was that Slyme had heard of Ruth\'s flight--nearly everyone knew\r\nabout it as a result of the inquiries that had been made for her--and,\r\nguessing the cause, he had prudently cleared out.\r\n\r\nEaston made no attempt to see Ruth, but he went to Owen\'s and took\r\nFreddie away, saying he would pay Mrs Linden to look after the child\r\nwhilst he was at work.  His manner was that of a deeply injured\r\nman--the possibility that he was in any way to blame for what had\r\nhappened did not seem to occur to his mind at all.\r\n\r\nAs for Ruth she made no resistance to his taking the child away from\r\nher, although she cried about it in secret.  She got some work a few\r\ndays afterwards--helping the servants at one of the large\r\nboarding-houses on the Grand Parade.\r\n\r\nNora looked after the baby for her while she was at work, an\r\narrangement that pleased Frankie vastly; he said it was almost as good\r\nas having a baby of their very own.\r\n\r\nFor the first few weeks after Ruth went away Easton tried to persuade\r\nhimself that he did not very much regret what had happened.  Mrs Linden\r\nlooked after Freddie, and Easton tried to believe that he would really\r\nbe better off now that he had only himself and the child to provide for.\r\n\r\nAt first, whenever he happened to meet Owen, they used to speak of\r\nRuth, or to be more correct, Easton used to speak of her; but one day\r\nwhen the two men were working together Owen had expressed himself\r\nrather offensively.  He seemed to think that Easton was more to blame\r\nthan she was; and afterwards they avoided the subject, although Easton\r\nfound it difficult to avoid the thoughts the other man\'s words\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nNow and then he heard of Ruth and learnt that she was still working at\r\nthe same place; and once he met her suddenly and unexpectedly in the\r\nstreet.  They passed each other hurriedly and he did not see the\r\nscarlet flush that for an instant dyed her face, nor the deathly pallor\r\nthat succeeded it.\r\n\r\nHe never went to Owen\'s place or sent any communication to Ruth, nor\r\ndid she ever send him any; but although Easton did not know it she\r\nfrequently saw Freddie, for when Elsie Linden took the child out she\r\noften called to see Mrs Owen.\r\n\r\nAs time went on and the resentment he had felt towards her lost its\r\nfirst bitterness, Easton began to think there was perhaps some little\r\njustification for what Owen had said, and gradually there grew within\r\nhim an immense desire for reconciliation--to start afresh and to forget\r\nall that had happened; but the more he thought of this the more\r\nhopeless and impossible of realization it seemed.\r\n\r\nAlthough perhaps he was not conscious of it, this desire arose solely\r\nfrom selfish motives.  The money he earned seemed to melt away almost\r\nas soon as he received it; to his surprise he found that he was not\r\nnearly so well off in regard to personal comfort as he had been\r\nformerly, and the house seemed to grow more dreary and desolate as the\r\nwintry days dragged slowly by.  Sometimes--when he had the money--he\r\nsought forgetfulness in the society of Crass and the other frequenters\r\nof the Cricketers, but somehow or other he could not take the same\r\npleasure in the conversation of these people as formerly, when he had\r\nfound it--as he now sometimes wondered to remember--so entertaining as\r\nto almost make him forget Ruth\'s existence.\r\n\r\nOne evening about three weeks before Christmas, as he and Owen were\r\nwalking homewards together from work, Easton reverted for the first\r\ntime to their former conversation.  He spoke with a superior air: his\r\nmanner and tone indicating that he thought he was behaving with great\r\ngenerosity.  He would be willing to forgive her and have her back, he\r\nsaid, if she would come: but he would never be able to tolerate the\r\nchild.  Of course it might be sent to an orphanage or some similar\r\ninstitution, but he was afraid Ruth would never consent to that, and he\r\nknew that her stepmother would not take it.\r\n\r\n\'If you can persuade her to return to you, we\'ll take the child,\' said\r\nOwen.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think your wife would be willing?\'\r\n\r\n\'She has already suggested doing so.\'\r\n\r\n\'To Ruth?\'\r\n\r\n\'No: to me.  We thought it a possible way for you, and my wife would\r\nlike to have the child.\'\r\n\r\n\'But would you be able to afford it?\' said Easton.\r\n\r\n\'We should manage all right.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said Easton, \'if Slyme comes back he might agree to pay\r\nsomething for its keep.\'\r\n\r\nOwen flushed.\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t take his money.\'\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause Easton continued: \'Would you mind asking Mrs Owen to\r\nsuggest it to Ruth?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you like I\'ll get her to suggest it--as a message from you.\'\r\n\r\n\'What I meant,\' said Easton hesitatingly, \'was that your wife might\r\njust suggest it--casual like--and advise her that it would be the best\r\nway, and then you could let me know what Ruth said.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' replied Owen, unable any longer to control his resentment of the\r\nother\'s manner, \'as things stand now, if it were not for the other\r\nchild, I should advise her to have nothing further to do with you. You\r\nseem to think that you are acting a very generous part in being\r\n"willing" to have her back, but she\'s better off now than she was with\r\nyou.  I see no reason--except for the other child--why she should go\r\nback to you.  As far as I understand it, you had a good wife and you\r\nill-treated her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never ill-treated her!  I never raised my hand to her--at least only\r\nonce, and then I didn\'t hurt her.  Does she say I ill-treated her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no: from what my wife tells me she only blames herself, but I\'m\r\ndrawing my own conclusions.  You may not have struck her, but you did\r\nworse--you treated her with indifference and exposed her to temptation.\r\nWhat has happened is the natural result of your neglect and want of\r\ncare for her.  The responsibility for what has happened is mainly\r\nyours, but apparently you wish to pose now as being very generous and\r\nto "forgive her"--you\'re "willing" to take her back; but it seems to me\r\nthat it would be more fitting that you should ask her to forgive you.\'\r\n\r\nEaston made no answer and after a long silence the other continued:\r\n\r\n\'I would not advise her to go back to you on such terms as you seem to\r\nthink right, because if you became reconciled on such terms I don\'t\r\nthink either of you could be happy.  Your only chance of happiness is\r\nto realize that you have both done wrong; that each of you has\r\nsomething to forgive; to forgive and never speak of it again.\'\r\n\r\nEaston made no reply and a few minutes afterwards, their ways\r\ndiverging, they wished each other \'Good night\'.\r\n\r\nThey were working for Rushton--painting the outside of a new\r\nconservatory at Mr Sweater\'s house, \'The Cave\'.  This job was finished\r\nthe next day and at four o\'clock the boy brought the handcart, which\r\nthey loaded with their ladders and other materials.  They took these\r\nback to the yard and then, as it was Friday night, they went up to the\r\nfront shop and handed in their time sheets.  Afterwards, as they were\r\nabout to separate, Easton again referred to the subject of their\r\nconversation of the previous evening.  He had been very reserved and\r\nsilent all day, scarcely uttering a word except when the work they had\r\nbeen engaged in made it necessary to do so, and there was now a sort of\r\ncatch in his voice as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been thinking over what you said last night; it\'s quite true.\r\nI\'ve been a great deal to blame.  I wrote to Ruth last night and\r\nadmitted it to her.  I\'ll take it as a favour if you and your wife will\r\nsay what you can to help me get her back.\'\r\n\r\nOwen stretched out his hand and as the other took it, said: \'You may\r\nrely on us both to do our best.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 51\r\n\r\nThe Widow\'s Son\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning when they went to the yard at half past eight o\'clock\r\nHunter told them that there was nothing to do, but that they had better\r\ncome on Monday in case some work came in.  They accordingly went on the\r\nMonday, and Tuesday and Wednesday, but as nothing \'came in\' of course\r\nthey did not do any work.  On Thursday morning the weather was dark and\r\nbitterly cold.  The sky presented an unbroken expanse of dull grey and\r\na keen north wind swept through the cheerless streets.  Owen--who had\r\ncaught cold whilst painting the outside of the conservatory at\r\nSweater\'s house the previous week--did not get to the yard until ten\r\no\'clock.  He felt so ill that he would not have gone at all if they had\r\nnot needed the money he would be able to earn if there was anything to\r\ndo.  Strange though it may appear to the advocates of thrift, although\r\nhe had been so fortunate as to be in employment when so many others\r\nwere idle, they had not saved any money.  On the contrary, during all\r\nthe summer they had not been able to afford to have proper food or\r\nclothing.  Every week most of the money went to pay arrears of rent or\r\nsome other debts, so that even whilst he was at work they had often to\r\ngo without some of the necessaries of life.  They had broken boots,\r\nshabby, insufficient clothing, and barely enough to eat.\r\n\r\nThe weather had become so bitterly cold that, fearing he would be laid\r\nup if he went without it any longer, he took his overcoat out of pawn,\r\nand that week they had to almost starve.  Not that it was much better\r\nother weeks, for lately he had only been making six and a half hours a\r\nday--from eight-thirty in the morning till four o\'clock in the evening,\r\nand on Saturday only four and a half hours--from half past eight till\r\none.  This made his wages--at sevenpence an hour--twenty-one shillings\r\nand sevenpence a week--that is, when there was work to do every day,\r\nwhich was not always.  Sometimes they had to stand idle three days out\r\nof six.  The wages of those who got sixpence halfpenny came out at one\r\npound and twopence--when they worked every day--and as for those\r\nwho--like Sawkins--received only fivepence, their week\'s wages amounted\r\nto fifteen and sixpence.\r\n\r\nWhen they were only employed for two or three days or perhaps only a\r\nfew hours, their \'Saturday night\' sometimes amounted to half a\r\nsovereign, seven and sixpence, five shillings or even less.  Then most\r\nof them said that it was better than nothing at all.\r\n\r\nMany of them were married men, so, in order to make existence possible,\r\ntheir wives went out charing or worked in laundries.  They had children\r\nwhom they had to bring up for the most part on \'skim\' milk, bread,\r\nmargarine, and adulterated tea.  Many of these children--little mites\r\nof eight or nine years--went to work for two or three hours in the\r\nmorning before going to school; the same in the evening after school,\r\nand all day on Saturday, carrying butchers\' trays loaded with meat,\r\nbaskets of groceries and vegetables, cans of paraffin oil, selling or\r\ndelivering newspapers, and carrying milk.  As soon as they were old\r\nenough they got Half Time certificates and directly they were fourteen\r\nthey left school altogether and went to work all the day. When they\r\nwere old enough some of them tried to join the Army or Navy, but were\r\nfound physically unfit.\r\n\r\nIt is not much to be wondered at that when they became a little older\r\nthey were so degenerate intellectually that they imagined that the\r\nsurest way to obtain better conditions would be to elect gangs of\r\nLiberal and Tory land-grabbers, sweaters, swindlers and lawyers to rule\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nWhen Owen arrived at the yard he found Bert White cleaning out the\r\ndirty pots in the paint-shop.  The noise he made with the scraping\r\nknife prevented him from hearing Owen\'s approach and the latter stood\r\nwatching him for some minutes without speaking.  The stone floor of the\r\npaint shop was damp and shiny and the whole place was chilly as a tomb.\r\nThe boy was trembling with cold and he looked pitifully undersized and\r\nfrail as he bent over his work with an old apron girt about him.\r\nBecause it was so cold he was wearing his jacket with the ends of the\r\nsleeves turned back to keep them clean, or to prevent them getting any\r\ndirtier, for they were already in the same condition as the rest of his\r\nattire, which was thickly encrusted with dried paint of many colours,\r\nand his hands and fingernails were grimed with it.\r\n\r\nAs he watched the poor boy bending over his task, Owen thought of\r\nFrankie, and with a feeling akin to terror wondered whether he would\r\never be in a similar plight.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Owen, the boy left off working and wished him good morning,\r\nremarking that it was very cold.\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t you light a fire?  There\'s lots of wood lying about the\r\nyard.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Bert shaking his head.  \'That would never do!  Misery\r\nwouldn\'t \'arf ramp if \'e caught me at it.  I used to \'ave a fire \'ere\r\nlast winter till Rushton found out, and \'e kicked up an orful row and\r\ntold me to move meself and get some work done and then I wouldn\'t feel\r\nthe cold.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, he said that, did he?\' said Owen, his pale face becoming suddenly\r\nsuffused with blood.  \'We\'ll see about that.\'\r\n\r\nHe went out into the yard and crossing over to where--under a\r\nshed--there was a great heap of waste wood, stuff that had been taken\r\nout of places where Rushton & Co. had made alterations, he gathered an\r\narmful of it and was returning to the paintshop when Sawkins accosted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\'You mustn\'t go burnin\' any of that, you know!  That\'s all got to be\r\nsaved and took up to the bloke\'s house.  Misery spoke about it only\r\nthis mornin\'.\'\r\n\r\nOwen did not answer him.  He carried the wood into the shop and after\r\nthrowing it into the fireplace he poured some old paint over it, and,\r\napplying a match, produced a roaring fire.  Then he brought in several\r\nmore armfuls of wood and piled them in a corner of the shop.  Bert took\r\nno part in these proceedings, and at first rather disapproved of them\r\nbecause he was afraid there would be trouble when Misery came, but when\r\nthe fire was an accomplished fact he warmed his hands and shifted his\r\nwork to the other side of the bench so as to get the benefit of the\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nOwen waited for about half an hour to see if Hunter would return, but\r\nas that disciple did not appear, he decided not to wait any longer.\r\nBefore leaving he gave Bert some instructions:\r\n\r\n\'Keep up the fire with all the old paint that you can scrape off those\r\nthings and any other old paint or rubbish that\'s here, and whenever it\r\ngrows dull put more wood on.  There\'s a lot of old stuff here that\'s of\r\nno use except to be thrown away or burnt.  Burn it all.  If Hunter says\r\nanything, tell him that I lit the fire, and that I told you to keep it\r\nburning.  If you want more wood, go out and take it.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' replied Bert.\r\n\r\nOn his way out Owen spoke to Sawkins.  His manner was so menacing, his\r\nface so pale, and there was such a strange glare in his eyes, that the\r\nlatter thought of the talk there had been about Owen being mad, and\r\nfelt half afraid of him.\r\n\r\n\'I am going to the office to see Rushton; if Hunter comes here, you say\r\nI told you to tell him that if I find the boy in that shop again\r\nwithout a fire, I\'ll report it to the Society for the Prevention of\r\nCruelty to Children.  And as for you, if the boy comes out here to get\r\nmore wood, don\'t you attempt to interfere with him.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want to interfere with the bloody kid,\' grunted Sawkins.  \'It\r\nseems to me as if he\'s gorn orf \'is bloody crumpet,\' he added as he\r\nwatched Owen walking rapidly down the street.  \'I can\'t understand why\r\npeople can\'t mind their own bloody business: anyone would think the boy\r\nbelonged to \'IM.\'\r\n\r\nThat was just how the matter presented itself to Owen.  The idea that\r\nit was his own child who was to be treated in this way possessed and\r\ninfuriated him as he strode savagely along.  In the vicinity of the\r\nSlave Market on the Grand Parade he passed--without seeing\r\nthem--several groups of unemployed artisans whom he knew.  Some of them\r\nwere offended and remarked that he was getting stuck up, but others,\r\nobserving how strange he looked, repeated the old prophecy that one of\r\nthese days Owen would go out of his mind.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near to his destination large flakes of snow began to fall.\r\nHe walked so rapidly and was in such a fury that by the time he reached\r\nthe shop he was scarcely able to speak.\r\n\r\n\'Is--Hunter--or Rushton here?\' he demanded of the shopman.\r\n\r\n\'Hunter isn\'t, but the guv\'nor is.  What was it you wanted?\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'ll soon--know--that,\' panted Owen as he strode up to the office\r\ndoor, and without troubling to knock, flung it violently open and\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of this place was very different from that of the damp\r\ncellar where Bert was working.  A grate fitted with asbestos blocks and\r\nlit with gas communicated a genial warmth to the air.\r\n\r\nRushton was standing leaning over Miss Wade\'s chair with his left arm\r\nround her neck.  Owen recollected afterwards that her dress was\r\ndisarranged.  She retired hastily to the far end of the room as Rushton\r\njumped away from her, and stared in amazement and confusion at the\r\nintruder--he was too astonished and embarrassed to speak.  Owen stood\r\npanting and quivering in the middle of the office and pointed a\r\ntrembling finger at his employer:\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve come--here--to tell--you--that--if I find young--Bert\r\nWhite--working--down in that shop--without a fire--I\'ll have you\r\nprosecuted.  The place is not good enough for a stable--if you owned a\r\nvaluable dog--you wouldn\'t keep it there--I give you fair warning--I\r\nknow--enough--about you--to put you--where you deserve to be--if you\r\ndon\'t treat him better I\'ll have you punished I\'ll show you up.\'\r\n\r\nRushton continued to stare at him in mingled confusion, fear and\r\nperplexity; he did not yet comprehend exactly what it was all about; he\r\nwas guiltily conscious of so many things which he might reasonably fear\r\nto be shown up or prosecuted for if they were known, and the fact of\r\nbeing caught under such circumstances with Miss Wade helped to reduce\r\nhim to a condition approaching terror.\r\n\r\n\'If the boy has been there without a fire, I \'aven\'t known anything\r\nabout it,\' he stammered at last.  \'Mr \'Unter has charge of all those\r\nmatters.\'\r\n\r\n\'You--yourself--forbade him--to make a fire last winter--and\r\nanyhow--you know about it now.  You obtained money from his mother\r\nunder the pretence--that you were going--to teach him a trade--but for\r\nthe last twelve months--you have been using him--as if he were--a beast\r\nof burden.  I advise you to see to it--or I shall--find--means--to make\r\nyou--wish you had done so.\'\r\n\r\nWith this Owen turned and went out, leaving the door open, and Rushton\r\nin a state of mind compounded of fear, amazement and anger.\r\n\r\nAs he walked homewards through the snow-storm, Owen began to realize\r\nthat the consequence of what he had done would be that Rushton would\r\nnot give him any more work, and as he reflected on all that this would\r\nmean to those at home, for a moment he doubted whether he had done\r\nright.  But when he told Nora what had happened she said there were\r\nplenty of other firms in the town who would employ him--when they had\r\nthe work.  He had done without Rushton before and could do so again;\r\nfor her part--whatever the consequences might be--she was glad that he\r\nhad acted as he did.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll get through somehow, I suppose,\' said Owen, wearily.  \'There\'s\r\nnot much chance of getting a job anywhere else just now, but I shall\r\ntry to get some work on my own account.  I shall do some samples of\r\nshow-cards the same as I did last winter and try to get orders from\r\nsome of the shops--they usually want something extra at this time, but\r\nI\'m afraid it is rather too late: most of them already have all they\r\nwant.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shouldn\'t go out again today if I were you,\' said Nora, noticing how\r\nill he looked.  \'You should stay at home and read, or write up those\r\nminutes.\'\r\n\r\nThe minutes referred to were those of the last meeting of the local\r\nbranch of the Painters\' Society, of which Owen was the secretary, and\r\nas the snow continued to fall, he occupied himself after dinner in the\r\nmanner his wife suggested, until four o\'clock, when Frankie returned\r\nfrom school bringing with him a large snowball, and crying out as a\r\npiece of good news that the snow was still falling heavily, and that he\r\nbelieved it was freezing!\r\n\r\nThey went to bed very early that night, for it was necessary to\r\neconomize the coal, and not only that, but--because the rooms were so\r\nnear the roof--it was not possible to keep the place warm no matter how\r\nmuch coal was used.  The fire seemed, if anything, to make the place\r\ncolder, for it caused the outer air to pour in through the joints of\r\nthe ill-fitting doors and windows.\r\n\r\nOwen lay awake for the greater part of the night.  The terror of the\r\nfuture made rest or sleep impossible.  He got up very early the next\r\nmorning--long before it was light--and after lighting the fire, set\r\nabout preparing the samples he had mentioned to Nora, but found that it\r\nwould not be possible to do much in this direction without buying more\r\ncardboard, for most of what he had was not in good condition.\r\n\r\nThey had bread and butter and tea for breakfast.  Frankie had his in\r\nbed and it was decided to keep him away from school until after dinner\r\nbecause the weather was so very cold and his only pair of boots were so\r\nsaturated with moisture from having been out in the snow the previous\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\'I shall make a few inquiries to see if there\'s any other work to be\r\nhad before I buy the cardboard,\' said Owen, \'although I\'m afraid it\'s\r\nnot much use.\'\r\n\r\nJust as he was preparing to go out, the front door bell rang, and as he\r\nwas going down to answer it he saw Bert White coming upstairs.  The boy\r\nwas carrying a flat, brown-paper parcel under his arm.\r\n\r\n\'A corfin plate,\' he explained as he arrived at the door.  \'Wanted at\r\nonce--Misery ses you can do it at \'ome, an\' I\'ve got to wait for it.\'\r\n\r\nOwen and his wife looked at each other with intense relief.  So he was\r\nnot to be dismissed after all.  It was almost too good to be true.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s a piece of paper inside the parcel with the name of the party\r\nwhat\'s dead,\' continued Bert, \'and here\'s a little bottle of Brunswick\r\nblack for you to do the inscription with.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did he send any other message?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: he told me to tell you there\'s a job to be started Monday\r\nmorning--a couple of rooms to be done out somewhere.  Got to be\r\nfinished by Thursday; and there\'s another job \'e wants you to do this\r\nafternoon--after dinner--so you\'ve got to come to the yard at one\r\no\'clock.  \'E told me to tell you \'e meant to leave a message for you\r\nyesterday morning, but \'e forgot.\'\r\n\r\n\'What did he say to you about the fire--anything?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes: they both of \'em came about an hour after you went away--Misery\r\nand the Bloke too--but they didn\'t kick up a row.  I wasn\'t arf\r\nfrightened, I can tell you, when I saw \'em both coming, but they was\r\nquite nice.  The Bloke ses to me, "Ah, that\'s right, my boy," \'e ses.\r\n"Keep up a good fire.  I\'m going to send you some coke," \'e ses.  And\r\nthen they \'ad a look round and \'e told Sawkins to put some new panes of\r\nglass where the winder was broken, and--you know that great big\r\npacking-case what was under the truck shed?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, \'e told Sawkins to saw it up and cover over the stone floor of\r\nthe paint-shop with it.  It ain\'t \'arf all right there now.  I\'ve\r\ncleared out all the muck from under the benches and we\'ve got two sacks\r\nof coke sent from the gas-works, and the Bloke told me when that\'s all\r\nused up I\'ve got to get a order orf Miss Wade for another lot.\'\r\n\r\nAt one o\'clock Owen was at the yard, where he saw Misery, who\r\ninstructed him to go to the front shop and paint some numbers on the\r\nracks where the wallpapers were stored.  Whilst he was doing this work\r\nRushton came in and greeted him in a very friendly way.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m very glad you let me know about the boy working in that\r\npaint-shop,\' he observed after a few preliminary remarks.  \'I can\r\nassure you as I don\'t want the lad to be uncomfortable, but you know I\r\ncan\'t attend to everything myself.  I\'m much obliged to you for telling\r\nme about it; I think you did quite right; I should have done the same\r\nmyself.\'\r\n\r\nOwen did not know what to reply, but Rushton walked off without\r\nwaiting...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 52\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a Far, Far Better Thing that I do, than I have Ever Done\'\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Owen, Easton and Crass and a few others were so lucky as to\r\nhave had a little work to do during the last few months, the majority\r\nof their fellow workmen had been altogether out of employment most of\r\nthe time, and meanwhile the practical business-men, and the pretended\r\ndisciples of Christ--the liars and hypocrites who professed to believe\r\nthat all men are brothers and God their Father--had continued to enact\r\nthe usual farce that they called \'Dealing\' with the misery that\r\nsurrounded them on every side.  They continued to organize \'Rummage\'\r\nand \'Jumble\' sales and bazaars, and to distribute their rotten cast-off\r\nclothes and boots and their broken victuals and soup to such of the\r\nBrethren as were sufficiently degraded to beg for them. The beautiful\r\nDistress Committee was also in full operation; over a thousand Brethren\r\nhad registered themselves on its books.  Of this number--after careful\r\ninvestigation--the committee had found that no fewer than six hundred\r\nand seventy-two were deserving of being allowed to work for their\r\nliving.  The Committee would probably have given these six hundred and\r\nseventy-two the necessary permission, but it was somewhat handicapped\r\nby the fact that the funds at its disposal were only sufficient to\r\nenable that number of Brethren to be employed for about three days.\r\nHowever, by adopting a policy of temporizing, delay, and general artful\r\ndodging, the Committee managed to create the impression that they were\r\nDealing with the Problem.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for a cunning device invented by Brother Rushton, a\r\nmuch larger number of the Brethren would have succeeded in registering\r\nthemselves as unemployed on the books of the Committee.  In previous\r\nyears it had been the practice to issue an application form called a\r\n\'Record Paper\' to any Brother who asked for one, and the Brother\r\nreturned it after filling it in himself.  At a secret meeting of the\r\nCommittee Rushton proposed--amid laughter and applause, it was such a\r\ngood joke--a new and better way, calculated to keep down the number of\r\napplicants.  The result of this innovation was that no more forms were\r\nissued, but the applicants for work were admitted into the office one\r\nat a time, and were there examined by a junior clerk, somewhat after\r\nthe manner of a French Juge d\'Instruction interrogating a criminal, the\r\nclerk filling in the form according to the replies of the culprit.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s your name?\'\r\n\r\n\'Where do you live?\'\r\n\r\n\'How long have you been living there?\'\r\n\r\n\'Where did you live before you went there?\'\r\n\r\n\'How long were you living at that place?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why did you move?\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you owe any rent when you left?\'\r\n\r\n\'What was your previous address?\'\r\n\r\n\'How old are you?  When was your last birthday?\'\r\n\r\n\'What is your Trade, Calling, Employment, or Occupation?\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you Married or single or a Widower or what?\'\r\n\r\n\'How many children have you?  How many boys?  How many girls?  Do they\r\ngo to work?  What do they earn?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'What kind of a house do you live in?  How many rooms are there?\'\r\n\r\n\'How much rent do you owe?\'\r\n\r\n\'Who was your last employer?  What was the foreman\'s name?  How long\r\ndid you work there?  What kind of work did you do?  Why did you leave?\'\r\n\r\n\'What have you been doing for the last five years?  What kind of work,\r\nhow many hours a day?  What wages did you get?\'\r\n\r\n\'Give the full names and addresses of all the different employers you\r\nhave worked for during the last five years, and the reasons why you\r\nleft them?\'\r\n\r\n\'Give the names of all the foremen you have worked under during the\r\nlast five years?\'\r\n\r\n\'Does your wife earn anything?  How much?\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you get any money from any Club or Society, or from any Charity, or\r\nfrom any other source?\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you ever received Poor Relief?\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you ever worked for a Distress Committee before?\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you ever done any other kinds of work than those you have\r\nmentioned?  Do you think you would be fit for any other kind? \'Have you\r\nany references?\' and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nWhen the criminal had answered all the questions, and when his answers\r\nhad all been duly written down, he was informed that a member of the\r\nCommittee, or an Authorized Officer, or some Other Person, would in due\r\ncourse visit his home and make inquiries about him, after which the\r\nAuthorized Officer or Other Person would make a report to the\r\nCommittee, who would consider it at their next meeting.\r\n\r\nAs the interrogation of each criminal occupied about half an hour, to\r\nsay nothing of the time he was kept waiting, it will be seen that as a\r\nmeans of keeping down the number of registered unemployed the idea\r\nworked splendidly.\r\n\r\nWhen Rushton introduced this new rule it was carried unanimously, Dr\r\nWeakling being the only dissentient, but of course he--as Brother\r\nGrinder remarked--was always opposed to any sensible proposal.  There\r\nwas one consolation, however, Grinder added, they was not likely to be\r\npestered with \'im much longer; the first of November was coming and if\r\nhe--Grinder--knowed anything of working men they was sure to give\r\nWeakling the dirty kick out directly they got the chance.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the result of the municipal election justified\r\nBrother Grinder\'s prognostications, for the working men voters of Dr\r\nWeakling\'s ward did give him the dirty kick out: but Rushton, Didlum,\r\nGrinder and several other members of the band were triumphantly\r\nreturned with increased majorities.\r\n\r\nMr Dauber, of Dauber and Botchit, had already been elected a Guardian\r\nof the Poor.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Hunter, who looked more worried and miserable as\r\nthe dreary weeks went by, was occupied every day in supervising what\r\nwork was being done and in running about seeking for more.  Nearly\r\nevery night he remained at the office until a late hour, poring over\r\nspecifications and making out estimates.  The police had become so\r\naccustomed to seeing the light in the office that as a rule they took\r\nno notice of it, but one Thursday night--exactly one week after the\r\nscene between Owen and Rushton about the boy--the constable on the beat\r\nobserved the light there much later than usual.  At first he paid no\r\nparticular attention to the fact, but when night merged into morning\r\nand the light still remained, his curiosity was aroused.\r\n\r\nHe knocked at the door, but no one came in answer, and no sound\r\ndisturbed the deathlike stillness that reigned within. The door was\r\nlocked, but he was not able to tell whether it had been closed from the\r\ninside or outside, because it had a spring latch.  The office window\r\nwas low down, but it was not possible to see in because the back of the\r\nglass had been painted.\r\n\r\nThe constable thought that the most probable explanation of the mystery\r\nwas that whoever had been there earlier in the evening had forgotten to\r\nturn out the light when they went away; it was not likely that thieves\r\nor anyone who had no business to be there would advertise their\r\npresence by lighting the gas.\r\n\r\nHe made a note of the incident in his pocket-book and was about to\r\nresume his beat when he was joined by his inspector.  The latter agreed\r\nthat the conclusion arrived at by the constable was probably the right\r\none and they were about to pass on when the inspector noticed a small\r\nspeck of light shining through the lower part of the painted window,\r\nwhere a small piece of the paint had either been scratched or had\r\nshelled off the glass.  He knelt down and found that it was possible to\r\nget a view of the interior of the office, and as he peered through he\r\ngave a low exclamation.  When he made way for his subordinate to look\r\nin his turn, the constable was with some difficulty able to distinguish\r\nthe figure of a man lying prone upon the floor.\r\n\r\nIt was an easy task for the burly policeman to force open the office\r\ndoor: a single push of his shoulder wrenched it from its fastenings and\r\nas it flew back the socket of the lock fell with a splash into a great\r\npool of blood that had accumulated against the threshold, flowing from\r\nthe place where Hunter was lying on his back, his arms extended and his\r\nhead nearly severed from his body.  On the floor, close to his right\r\nhand, was an open razor.  An overturned chair lay on the floor by the\r\nside of the table where he usually worked, the table itself being\r\nlittered with papers and drenched with blood.\r\n\r\nWithin the next few days Crass resumed the role he had played when\r\nHunter was ill during the summer, taking charge of the work and\r\ngenerally doing his best to fill the dead man\'s place, although--as he\r\nconfided to certain of his cronies in the bar of the Cricketers--he had\r\nno intention of allowing Rushton to do the same as Hunter had done.\r\nOne of his first jobs--on the morning after the discovery of the\r\nbody--was to go with Mr Rushton to look over a house where some work\r\nwas to be done for which an estimate had to be given.  It was this\r\nestimate that Hunter had been trying to make out the previous evening\r\nin the office, for they found that the papers on his table were covered\r\nwith figures and writing relating to this work.  These papers justified\r\nthe subsequent verdict of the Coroner\'s jury that Hunter committed\r\nsuicide in a fit of temporary insanity, for they were covered with a\r\nlot of meaningless scribbling, the words wrongly spelt and having no\r\nintelligible connection with each other.  There was one sum that he had\r\nevidently tried repeatedly to do correctly, but which came wrong in a\r\ndifferent way every time.  The fact that he had the razor in his\r\npossession seemed to point to his having premeditated the act, but this\r\nwas accounted for at the inquest by the evidence of the last person who\r\nsaw him alive, a hairdresser, who stated that Hunter had left the razor\r\nwith him to be sharpened a few days previously and that he had called\r\nfor it on the evening of the tragedy.  He had ground this razor for Mr\r\nHunter several times before.\r\n\r\nCrass took charge of all the arrangements for the funeral.  He bought a\r\nnew second-hand pair of black trousers at a cast-off clothing shop in\r\nhonour of the occasion, and discarded his own low-crowned silk\r\nhat--which was getting rather shabby--in favour of Hunter\'s tall one,\r\nwhich he found in the office and annexed without hesitation or scruple.\r\nIt was rather large for him, but he put some folded strips of paper\r\ninside the leather lining.  Crass was a proud man as he walked in\r\nHunter\'s place at the head of the procession, trying to look solemn,\r\nbut with a half-smile on his fat, pasty face, destitute of colour\r\nexcept one spot on his chin near his underlip, where there was a small\r\npatch of inflammation about the size of a threepenny piece. This spot\r\nhad been there for a very long time.  At first--as well as he could\r\nremember--it was only a small pimple, but it had grown larger, with\r\nsomething the appearance of scurvy.  Crass attributed its continuation\r\nto the cold having \'got into it last winter\'.  It was rather strange,\r\ntoo, because he generally took care of himself when it was cold: he\r\nalways wore the warm wrap that had formerly belonged to the old lady\r\nwho died of cancer.  However, Crass did not worry much about this\r\nlittle sore place; he just put a little zinc ointment on it\r\noccasionally and had no doubt that it would get well in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 53\r\n\r\nBarrington Finds a Situation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revulsion of feeling that Barrington experienced during the\r\nprogress of the election was intensified by the final result.  The\r\nblind, stupid, enthusiastic admiration displayed by the philanthropists\r\nfor those who exploited and robbed them; their extraordinary apathy\r\nwith regard to their own interests; the patient, broken-spirited way in\r\nwhich they endured their sufferings, tamely submitting to live in\r\npoverty in the midst of the wealth they had helped to create; their\r\ncallous indifference to the fate of their children, and the savage\r\nhatred they exhibited towards anyone who dared to suggest the\r\npossibility of better things, forced upon him the thought that the\r\nhopes he cherished were impossible of realization. The words of the\r\nrenegade Socialist recurred constantly to his mind:\r\n\r\n\'You can be a Jesus Christ if you like, but for my part I\'m finished.\r\nFor the future I intend to look after myself.  As for these people,\r\nthey vote for what they want, they get what they vote for, and, by God!\r\nthey deserve nothing better!  They are being beaten with whips of their\r\nown choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with\r\nscorpions.  For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,\r\nsemi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and\r\nuphold it.  Let them have what they vote for!  Let them drudge and let\r\nthem starve!\'\r\n\r\nThese words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded\r\nstreets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.  The shops\r\nwere all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,\r\nand the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with\r\nsightseers.\r\n\r\nBarrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed\r\nmen and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the\r\npoulterers\' and butchers\' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried\r\nrows of turkeys and geese decorated with coloured ribbons and rosettes.\r\nHe knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share\r\nmany of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly\r\nat their wonderful patience and abject resignation.\r\n\r\nBut what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the\r\nwomen, evidently working men\'s wives.  Their faded, ill-fitting\r\ngarments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn\r\nfaces.  Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little\r\nchildren who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers\' hands.\r\nThe sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and\r\ndependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the\r\nwistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of\r\nthe toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and\r\nfilled his eyes with tears.  He knew that these children--naked of joy\r\nand all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the\r\nthings that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they\r\nwere not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his\r\nheart yearned over his younger brethren.\r\n\r\nHe felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the\r\nmidst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame\r\nbecause he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest\r\ncause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of\r\nthe disconsolate and the oppressed.\r\n\r\nHe presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children\r\nwere standing admiring the contents of the window.  He recognized some\r\nof these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.\r\nThey did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro\r\nbefore the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way\r\nin which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their\r\ncages.  These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from\r\none end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed\r\nagainst the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each\r\nother the particular toys that took their fancies.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s mine!\' cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a\r\nlarge strongly built waggon.  \'If I had that I\'d give Freddie rides in\r\nit and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines\r\nas well.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d rather have this railway,\' said Frankie Owen.  \'There\'s a real\r\ntunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there\'s the station and the\r\nsignals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to\r\nlight when there\'s danger on the line.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mine\'s this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes\r\nthat you can take off,\' said Elsie; \'and this tea set; and this\r\nneedlecase for Mother.\'\r\n\r\nLittle Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung\r\ntightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and\r\ndesire.  \'Gee-gee?\' he cried eagerly.  \'Gee-gee.  Pwetty Gee-gee!\r\nFweddy want gee-gee!\'\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s no use lookin\' at them any longer,\' continued Elsie, with a\r\nsigh, as she took hold of Freddie\'s hand to lead him away.  \'It\'s no\r\nuse lookin\' at \'em any longer; the likes of us can\'t expect to have\r\nsuch good things as them.\'\r\n\r\nThis remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities\r\nof life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to\r\nfollow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not\r\nlived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were\r\nnot for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he\r\npursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a\r\ngee-gee.  The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort\r\nhim by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the\r\nwindows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to\r\nbring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any\r\nimpression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nWhilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom\r\nthey hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain\r\ngifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\'Hello, Mr Barrington,\' said the two boys in a breath.\r\n\r\n\'Hello,\' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby\'s cheek.  \'What\'s\r\nthe matter here?  What\'s Freddie crying for?\'\r\n\r\n\'He wants that there \'orse, mister, the one with the real \'air on,\'\r\nsaid Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized\r\nthe absurdity of the demand.\r\n\r\n\'Fweddie want gee-gee,\' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington\'s\r\nhand and returning to the window.  \'Nice gee-gee.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tell him that Santa Claus\'ll bring it to him on Christmas,\' whispered\r\nElsie.  \'P\'raps he\'ll believe you and that\'ll satisfy him, and he\'s\r\nsure to forget all about it in a little while.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?\' inquired Frankie.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' replied Barrington slowly.  \'I\'ve got something to do at last.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s a good job, ain\'t it?\' remarked Charley.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Barrington.  \'And whom do you think I\'m working for?\'\r\n\r\n\'Who?\'\r\n\r\n\'Santa Claus.\'\r\n\r\n\'Santa Claus!\' echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' continued Barrington, solemnly.  \'You know, he is a very old man\r\nnow, so old that he can\'t do all his work himself.  Last year he was so\r\ntired that he wasn\'t able to get round to all the children he wanted to\r\ngive things to, and consequently a great many of them never got\r\nanything at all.  So this year he\'s given me a job to help him. He\'s\r\ngiven me some money and a list of children\'s names, and against their\r\nnames are written the toys they are to have.  My work is to buy the\r\nthings and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.\'\r\n\r\nThe children listened to this narrative with bated breath.  Incredible\r\nas the story seemed, Barrington\'s manner was so earnest as to almost\r\ncompel belief.\r\n\r\n\'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?\' said Frankie at\r\nlength, speaking almost in a whisper.  Elsie and Charley maintained an\r\nawestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n\'Really and truly,\' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his\r\npocket-book and turned over the leaves.  \'I\'ve got the list here;\r\nperhaps your names are down for something.\'\r\n\r\nThe three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they\r\nlistened wide-eyed for what was to follow.\r\n\r\n\'Let me see,\' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,\r\n\'Why, yes, here they are!  Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can\r\nbe taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.  Freddie Easton, one horse\r\nwith real hair.  Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of\r\ngroceries.  Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with\r\nreal coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines\r\nround.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington closed the book: \'So you may as well have your things now,\'\r\nhe continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.  \'We\'ll buy them here;\r\nit will save me a lot of work.  I shall not have the trouble of taking\r\nthem round to where you live.  It\'s lucky I happened to meet you, isn\'t\r\nit?\'\r\n\r\nThe children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to\r\ngasp out that it was--very lucky.\r\n\r\nAs they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the\r\nfour whose condition was anything like normal.  All the others were in\r\na half-dazed state.  Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at\r\nall.  It couldn\'t be true; it must be a dream.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels. They\r\ndid not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and\r\nhanded it over to its new owner.  The elder children were scarcely\r\nconscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington\r\nwas talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the\r\nsound seemed far away and unreal.\r\n\r\nThe shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one\r\nparcel and gave it to Elsie.  The railway, in a stout cardboard box,\r\nwas also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie\'s heart nearly burst\r\nwhen the man put the package into his arms.\r\n\r\nWhen they came out of the toy shop they said \'Good night\' to Frankie,\r\nwho went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he\r\nwere walking on air.  The others went into a provision merchant\'s near\r\nby, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.\r\n\r\nThen Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that\r\nhe had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a\r\npair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy\r\nthese, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of\r\nholes, so they went to a draper\'s and bought some stocking also.\r\nBarrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure\r\nSanta Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,\r\nbut had forgotten to put them down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 54\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following evening Barrington called at Owen\'s place.  He said he\r\nwas going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.\r\n\r\nOwen had not been doing very well during these last few months,\r\nalthough he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share\r\nof work.  Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they\r\noften had to go short of food.  Lately his chest had become so bad that\r\nthe slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,\r\nwhich made it almost impossible to work even when he had the\r\nopportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will\r\nthat he was able to continue working at all.  He contrived to keep up\r\nappearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew\r\nthat Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook\r\nit so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very\r\nuseful hand when things were busy.  But lately some of the men with\r\nwhom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a\r\nmate.  When two men are working together, the master expects to see two\r\nmen\'s work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it\r\nmakes it all the harder for the other.\r\n\r\nHe never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in\r\nthe winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local\r\nhospital.  Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid\r\nthey were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.\r\nContributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in\r\nthe town.  The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the\r\nhospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they\r\ngave to anyone who needed and asked for them.  The employer had to fill\r\nin the ticket or application form with the name and address of the\r\napplicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a\r\ndeserving case, \'suitable to receive this charity\'.  In common with the\r\nmajority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to\r\nthis hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.\r\nIt happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a\r\nprivate doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a\r\nparticular morning.  To do this he had to stay away from work.  The\r\nmedicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for\r\nthe truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of\r\nothers--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things\r\nthat had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been\r\ndying alone in the middle of a desert.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to\r\nbuy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but\r\nalthough some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough\r\nfor him to derive any benefit from them.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of\r\nbeing unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to\r\nbelieve that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nWhen Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in\r\nthe sitting-room. He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off\r\nthe ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in\r\nRushton\'s home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.\r\n\r\n\'I have never told you before,\' said Barrington, after they had been\r\ntalking for a while, \'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not\r\nwork for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.  I just\r\nwanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the\r\nmajority.  My father is a wealthy man.  He doesn\'t approve of my\r\nopinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding\r\nthem, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own\r\nway.  I\'m going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring\r\nI intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.\r\nWe\'ll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we\'ll hold\r\nmeetings every night; we\'ll drench the town with literature, and we\'ll\r\nstart a branch of the party.\'\r\n\r\nOwen\'s eye kindled and his pale face flushed.\r\n\r\n\'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,\' he said.\r\nFor instance, I could paint some posters and placards.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I can help to give away handbills,\' chimed in Frankie, looking up\r\nfrom the floor, where he was seated working the railway.  \'I know a lot\r\nof boys who\'ll come along with me to put \'em under the doors as well.\'\r\n\r\nThey were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.  Mrs Owen was in\r\nthe next room with Ruth. While the two men were talking the front-door\r\nbell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing\r\nthe door after him.  Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,\r\nand from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the\r\nadjoining room.  After a little while they heard some one go out by the\r\nfront door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with\r\nexcitement, burst into the room, crying out:\r\n\r\n\'Dad and Mr Barrington!  Three cheers!\'  And he began capering\r\ngleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.\r\n\r\n\'What are the cheers to be for?\' inquired Barrington, rather mystified\r\nby this extraordinary conduct.\r\n\r\n\'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she\'s gone home\r\nagain with them,\' replied Freddie, \'and--she\'s given the baby to us for\r\na Christmas box!\'\r\n\r\nBarrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton\'s separation\r\nfrom his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.\r\n\r\nBarrington took his leave shortly afterwards.  His train left at eight;\r\nit was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to\r\nwrite.  Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then\r\nshe helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested\r\nthat the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.\r\n\r\nThere was a stationer\'s shop at the end of the street.  He went in here\r\nand bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed\r\nthe pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with\r\nthe two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook. Having\r\naddressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for\r\nhim outside. He gave the letter to the boy.\r\n\r\n\'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.  I\r\ndon\'t want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get\r\nhome.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' replied Frankie.  \'I won\'t stop running all the way.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington hesitated and looked at his watch.  \'I think I have time to\r\ngo back with you as far as your front door,\' he said, \'then I shall be\r\nquite sure you haven\'t lost it.\'\r\n\r\nThey accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the\r\nentrance to the house.  Barrington opened the door and stood for a\r\nmoment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.\r\n\r\n\'Will your train cross over the bridge?\' inquired the boy, pausing and\r\nlooking over the banisters.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  Why?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you\r\nwere to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we\r\ncould wave back.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right.  I\'ll do so.  Goodbye.\'\r\n\r\n\'Goodbye.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of\r\nOwen\'s flat, and then he hurried away.  When he gained the main road he\r\nheard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the\r\nside-streets.  As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nThere was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and\r\non the glass of this lamp was painted: \'Be not deceived: God is not\r\nmocked.\'\r\n\r\nMr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.  He said that they\r\nhad come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy\r\nto hall those dear people that he saw standing around.  The members of\r\nthe Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the\r\norganizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he\r\nwas \'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there\r\nco-operating with them in the good work.  As he continued his address,\r\nRushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd\r\nas his \'Brothers and Sisters\' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.\r\n\r\nBarrington looked round upon the \'Brothers\': Mr Sweater, resplendent in\r\na new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat. The\r\nRev. Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr\r\nGrinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged\r\nworship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk\r\nhats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they\r\nhad fared sumptuously for many days.  Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr\r\nDauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst was the Rev. John Starr, doing the work for which he\r\nwas paid.\r\n\r\nAs he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing\r\nin his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function\r\nwas to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of\r\nrespectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang\r\nof swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority\r\nof the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.\r\n\r\nHe was doing the work for which he was paid.  By the mere fact of his\r\npresence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical\r\nrepresentatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity\r\nhave made the earth into a hell.\r\n\r\nThere was also a number of \'respectable\', well-dressed people who\r\nlooked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily\r\ndressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of\r\nplace in the glittering throng.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced\r\nworking men and women, most of them dressed in other people\'s cast-off\r\nclothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.\r\n\r\nRushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give\r\nout the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of\r\nhis remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \'Oh, come and jine this \'oly band,\r\n        And hon to glory go.\'\r\n\r\nStrange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of\r\nthem ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were\r\nconducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of\r\nChrist--Christians!\r\n\r\nJesus said: \'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth\', \'Love not\r\nthe world nor the things of the world\', \'Woe unto you that are rich--it\r\nis easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich\r\nman to enter the kingdom of heaven.\'  Yet all these self-styled\r\n\'Followers\' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal\r\nbusiness of their lives.\r\n\r\nJesus said: \'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and\r\ngrievous to be borne, and lay them on men\'s shoulders, but they\r\nthemselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.  For one is\r\nyour master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.\'  But nearly all\r\nthese alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be\r\nother people\'s masters or mistresses.  And as for being all brethren,\r\nwhilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and\r\nfared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands\r\nof those they hypocritically called their \'brethren\', men, women and\r\nlittle children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have\r\nalready seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton\r\nand the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.\r\n\r\nWhenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus\r\npreached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!  They did not\r\nseem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,\r\nthat Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to\r\nforget that Jesus said, \'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do\r\nnot the things I say?...\' \'Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and\r\ndoeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house\r\nupon the sand.\'\r\n\r\nBut although none of these self-styled \'Followers\' of Christ, ever did\r\nthe things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and\r\nsang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to\r\nexhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways. And\r\nthey procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: \'Be not deceived,\r\nGod is not mocked.\'\r\n\r\nThey stigmatized as \'infidels\' all those who differed from them,\r\nforgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically\r\nfalse and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.\r\n\r\nGrinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several\r\nother infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had\r\naddressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,\r\nof whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain\r\npleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as\r\nRushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:\r\n\r\n        \'Come and jine this \'Oly band and hon to glory go!\'\r\n\r\nAs Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium\r\nstruck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the\r\nsinging:\r\n\r\n        \'Oh, come and join this \'oly band and hon to glory go.\'\r\n\r\nDuring the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the\r\ncrowd distributing tracts.  Presently one of them offered one to\r\nBarrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was\r\nSlyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by\r\nname.  Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want that--from you,\' he said contemptuously.\r\n\r\nSlyme turned red.  \'Oh, I know what you\'re thinking of,\' he said after\r\na pause and speaking in an injured tone; \'but you shouldn\'t judge\r\nanyone too hard.  It wasn\'t only my fault, and you don\'t know \'ow much\r\nI\'ve suffered for it.  If it \'adn\'t been for the Lord, I believe I\r\nshould \'ave drownded myself.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was\r\nfinished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a\r\nhearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing\r\nweek at the Chapel of the Shining Light.  He invited them there\r\nspecially, of course, because it was the place with which he was\r\nhimself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they\r\nwould not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places\r\nof worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly\r\nevery street.  Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining\r\nLight could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did\r\nhope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go\r\nSomewhere.\r\n\r\nA short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for\r\nthe presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed\r\ndisciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore\r\nmore respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each\r\nother or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two\r\npoor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with\r\nthe hymn books and what remained of the tracts. As Barrington hurried\r\noff to catch the train one of the \'Followers\' gave him a card which he\r\nread by the light of a street lamp--\r\n\r\n                   Come and join the Brotherhood\r\n                    at the Shining Light Chapel\r\n                                PSA\r\n                    Every Sunday at 3 o\'clock.\r\n                   Let Brotherly Love Continue.\r\n                 \'Oh come and join this Holy Band\r\n                        and on to Glory go.\'\r\n\r\nBarrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a\r\nplace--with some decent people, than share \'glory\' with a crew like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep\r\nin her lap.  Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite. They had\r\nboth been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington\'s departure.\r\nIt was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton\r\nand Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of\r\naccomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their\r\nown position.\r\n\r\n\'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,\' said\r\nNora at last breaking the long silence, \'and Frankie is so fond of her\r\ntoo.  But all the same I can\'t feel happy about it when I think how ill\r\nyou are.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,\' said\r\nOwen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.  \'We have always pulled\r\nthrough somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make\r\nmuch difference, and she\'ll be as well off with us as she would have\r\nbeen if Ruth had not gone back.\'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child\r\nand the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent\r\na thrill all through him.  As he looked at this little helpless,\r\ndependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he\r\nwould never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had\r\nsometimes entertained in hours of despondency.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ve always got through somehow or other,\' he repeated, \'and we\'ll do\r\nso still.\'\r\n\r\nPresently they heard Frankie\'s footsteps ascending the stairs and a\r\nmoment afterwards the boy entered the room.\r\n\r\n\'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his\r\ntrain goes over the bridge,\' he cried breathlessly.  \'And he\'s sent\r\nthis letter.  Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s plenty of time yet,\' replied Owen, smiling at the boy\'s\r\nimpetuosity.  \'Nearly twenty minutes.  We don\'t want the window open\r\nall that time.  It\'s only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and\r\nthat\'s five minutes fast.\'\r\n\r\nHowever, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past\r\nunnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the\r\nglass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while\r\nOwen opened the letter:\r\n\r\n\'Dear Owen,\r\n\r\n\'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the\r\nother for five.  The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself\r\nin the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you\r\nif our positions were reversed.  If I were in need, I know that you\r\nwould willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you\r\nby refusing.  The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.\r\nGive three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White\'s\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for\r\nthe fray when I come back in the spring,\r\n\r\n                             \'Yours for the cause,\r\n\r\n                                                  \'George Barrington.\'\r\n\r\nOwen read it over two or three times before he could properly\r\nunderstand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not\r\nhave spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who\r\nfelt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted\r\nfrom her heart. All the undefined terror of the future faded away as\r\nshe thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the\r\ndirection of the station.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you think we\'d better have the window open now, Dad?\' he said at\r\nlast as the clock struck eight.  \'The steam keeps coming on the glass\r\nas fast as I wipe it off and I can\'t see out properly.  I\'m sure it\'s\r\nnearly time now; p\'raps our clock isn\'t as fast as you think it is.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, we\'ll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,\' said\r\nOwen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the\r\nchild up in a shawl, joined them at the window.\r\n\r\n\'It can\'t be much longer now, you know,\' said Frankie.  \'The line\'s\r\nclear.  They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened\r\nthe window.\'\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it\r\ndrew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came\r\ninto sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were\r\nilluminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;\r\na few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed\r\nas it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later\r\nit thundered across the bridge.  It was too far away to recognize his\r\nface, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a\r\nhandkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in\r\nreturn.  Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the\r\nlights at the rear of the guard\'s van, and presently even those\r\nvanished into the surrounding darkness.\r\n\r\nThe lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the\r\nadjacent streets and a great part of the town. On the other side of the\r\nroad were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents\'\r\nadvertisement boards and bills.  About twenty yards away, the shop\r\nformerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt\r\ntwo or three months previously, was also plastered with similar\r\ndecorations.  A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the\r\npremises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were\r\njust being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were\r\nclosing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more\r\ncheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the\r\nmoon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;\r\nbut a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the\r\nweather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being\r\nconcealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly\r\naccumulating overhead.\r\n\r\nAs they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few\r\nminutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that\r\nthe gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the\r\nInfamy existing beyond.  In every country, myriads of armed men waiting\r\nfor their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each\r\nother like wild beasts.  All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;\r\nabundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and\r\ncrime.  Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of\r\nworking for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and\r\ncold and slowly perishing of want.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time\r\ntheir grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the\r\nblack masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,\r\nseemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist\r\nSystem.  That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest\r\nmeasure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling\r\ninto ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so\r\nwicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and\r\ncurse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for\r\never, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.\r\n\r\nBut from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the\r\nCo-operative Commonwealth.  Mankind, awaking from the long night of\r\nbondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain\r\nprone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving\r\nasunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from\r\nthem the face of heaven.  The light that will shine upon the world wide\r\nFatherland and illumine the gilded domes and glittering pinnacles of\r\nthe beautiful cities of the future, where men shall dwell together in\r\ntrue brotherhood and goodwill and joy.  The Golden Light that will be\r\ndiffused throughout all the happy world from the rays of the risen sun\r\nof Socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\nMugsborough\r\n\r\n\r\nMugsborough was a town of about eighty thousand inhabitants, about two\r\nhundred miles from London.  It was built in a verdant valley.  Looking\r\nwest, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand\r\nParade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad\r\nhills.  To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,\r\ncultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles\r\naway.  The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.\r\n\r\nThe town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful\r\nand sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the\r\nwealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous\r\nboarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.  East,\r\nthe town extended up the slope to the top of the hill and down the\r\nother side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working\r\nclasses lived.\r\n\r\nYears ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more\r\ncostly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of\r\nlate years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on\r\nthe Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of\r\nEngland.  However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of\r\nprosperity.  Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what\r\nwere called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.  The\r\nGrand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and\r\ncarriages.  The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of\r\nour story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.  But this fair\r\noutward appearance was deceitful.  The town was really a vast whited\r\nsepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the\r\nmajority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty\r\nwhich in many cases bordered on destitution.  One of the reasons for\r\nthis was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and\r\nboarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working\r\nclasses were paid away as rent and rates.\r\n\r\nFor years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public\r\nworks and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased\r\nthe rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services\r\nundertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue. Every\r\npublic service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of\r\nprivate companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the\r\nhands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the\r\nCorporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of\r\ntheir number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of\r\nwhom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which\r\nbattened on the town.\r\n\r\nThe Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,\r\nthe Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous\r\nothers.  There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,\r\nDidlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the\r\noldest and most flourishing of them all.  This institution had grown\r\nwith the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the\r\ngreater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although\r\nthey lived on the town, they did not live in it.\r\n\r\nThe profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by\r\nlaw from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently\r\nfound it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.  They\r\npaid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of\r\ncourse--enormous salaries.  They built and furnished costly and\r\nluxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of\r\nBonuses.\r\n\r\nThere was one way in which the Company might have used some of the\r\nprofits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the\r\nworkmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by\r\nthe terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of\r\ncourse none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing\r\nthat.  It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYears ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small\r\namount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy\r\nthe Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon\r\nwhom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that\r\nthe sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.\r\n\r\nOf course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but\r\nit was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally\r\nconsidered to be impracticable.\r\n\r\nAlthough they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough\r\nhad to buy the gas.  The amount paid by the municipality to the Company\r\nfor the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the\r\nCouncil.  They managed to get some of their own back by imposing a duty\r\nof two shillings a ton upon coals imported into the Borough, but\r\nalthough it cost the Gas Works a lot of money for coal dues the Company\r\nin its turn got its own back by increasing the price of gas they sold\r\nto the inhabitants of the town...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, by\r\nRobert Tressell\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RAGGED TROUSERED PHILANTHROPISTS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3608.txt or 3608.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/3/6/0/3608/\r\n\r\nProduced by Iain Tatch.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
