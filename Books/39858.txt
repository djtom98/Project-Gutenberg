Things were beginning to look shipshape at last. The\r\nbig piano, a semi-grand by Broadwood, had arrived from England by "the\r\nLittle Quickness" (_la Petite Vitesse_, as the goods trains are called\r\nin France), and lay, freshly tuned, alongside the eastern wall; on the\r\nwall opposite was a panoply of foils, masks, and boxing-gloves.\r\n\r\nA trapeze, a knotted rope, and two parallel cords, supporting each a\r\nring, depended from a huge beam in the ceiling. The walls were of the\r\nusual dull red, relieved by plaster casts of arms and legs and hands and\r\nfeet; and Dante\'s mask, and Michael Angelo\'s altorilievo of Leda and the\r\nswan, and a centaur and Lapith from the Elgin marbles--on none of these\r\nhad the dust as yet had time to settle.\r\n\r\nThere were also studies in oil from the nude; copies of Titian,\r\nRembrandt, Velasquez, Rubens, Tintoret, Leonardo da Vinci--none of the\r\nschool of Botticelli, Mantegna, and Co.--a firm whose merits had not as\r\nyet been revealed to the many.\r\n\r\nAlong the walls, at a great height, ran a broad shelf, on which were\r\nother casts in plaster, terra-cotta, imitation bronze; a little Theseus,\r\na little Venus of Milo, a little discobolus; a little flayed man\r\nthreatening high heaven (an act that seemed almost pardonable under the\r\ncircumstances!); a lion and a boar by Barye; an anatomical figure of a\r\nhorse with only one leg left and no ears; a horse\'s head from the\r\npediment of the Parthenon, earless also; and the bust of Clytie, with\r\nher beautiful low brow, her sweet wan gaze, and the ineffable forward\r\nshrug of her dear shoulders that makes her bosom a nest, a rest, a\r\npillow, a refuge--to be loved and desired forever by generation after\r\ngeneration of the sons of men.\r\n\r\nNear the stove hung a gridiron, a frying-pan, a toasting-fork, and a\r\npair of bellows. In an adjoining glazed corner cupboard were plates and\r\nglasses, black-handled knives, pewter spoons, and three-pronged steel\r\nforks; a salad-bowl, vinegar cruets, an oil-flask, two mustard-pots\r\n(English and French), and such like things--all scrupulously clean. On\r\nthe floor, which had been stained and waxed at considerable cost, lay\r\ntwo chetah-skins and a large Persian praying-rug. One-half of it,\r\nhowever (under the trapeze and at the farthest end from the window,\r\nbeyond the model throne), was covered with coarse matting, that one\r\nmight fence or box without slipping down and splitting one\'s self in\r\ntwo, or fall without breaking any bones.\r\n\r\nTwo other windows of the usual French size and pattern, with shutters to\r\nthem and heavy curtains of baize, opened east and west, to let in dawn\r\nor sunset, as the case might be, or haply keep them out. And there were\r\nalcoves, recesses, irregularities, odd little nooks and corners, to be\r\nfilled up as time wore on with endless personal knick-knacks, bibelots,\r\nprivate properties and acquisitions--things that make a place genial,\r\nhomelike, and good to remember, and sweet to muse upon (with fond\r\nregret) in after-years.\r\n\r\nAnd an immense divan spread itself in width and length and delightful\r\nthickness just beneath the big north window, the business window--a\r\ndivan so immense that three well-fed, well-contented Englishmen could\r\nall lie lazily smoking their pipes on it at once without being in each\r\nother\'s way, and very often did!\r\n\r\nAt present one of these Englishmen--a Yorkshireman, by-the-way, called\r\nTaffy (and also the Man of Blood, because he was supposed to be\r\ndistantly related to a baronet)--was more energetically engaged.\r\nBare-armed, and in his shirt and trousers, he was twirling a pair of\r\nIndian clubs round his head. His face was flushed, and he was perspiring\r\nfreely and looked fierce. He was a very big young man, fair, with kind\r\nbut choleric blue eyes, and the muscles of his brawny arm were strong as\r\niron bands.\r\n\r\nFor three years he had borne her Majesty\'s commission, and had been\r\nthrough the Crimean campaign without a scratch. He would have been one\r\nof the famous six hundred in the famous charge at Balaklava but for a\r\nsprained ankle (caught playing leapfrog in the trenches), which kept him\r\nin hospital on that momentous day. So that he lost his chance of glory\r\nor the grave, and this humiliating misadventure had sickened him of\r\nsoldiering for life, and he never quite got over it. Then, feeling\r\nwithin himself an irresistible vocation for art, he had sold out; and\r\nhere he was in Paris, hard at work, as we see.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAFFY, ALIAS TALBOT WYNNE]\r\n\r\nHe was good-looking, with straight features; but I regret to say that,\r\nbesides his heavy plunger\'s mustache, he wore an immense pair of\r\ndrooping auburn whiskers, of the kind that used to be called Piccadilly\r\nweepers, and were afterwards affected by Mr. Sothern in Lord Dundreary.\r\nIt was a fashion to do so then for such of our gilded youth as could\r\nafford the time (and the hair); the bigger and fairer the whiskers, the\r\nmore beautiful was thought the youth! It seems incredible in these days,\r\nwhen even her Majesty\'s household brigade go about with smooth cheeks\r\nand lips, like priests or play-actors.\r\n\r\n            "What\'s become of all the gold\r\n    Used to hang and brush their bosoms ...?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE LAIRD OF COCKPEN"]\r\n\r\nAnother inmate of this blissful abode--Sandy, the Laird of Cockpen, as\r\nhe was called--sat in similarly simple attire at his easel, painting at\r\na lifelike little picture of a Spanish toreador serenading a lady of\r\nhigh degree (in broad daylight). He had never been to Spain, but he had\r\na complete toreador\'s kit--a bargain which he had picked up for a mere\r\nsong in the Boulevard du Temple--and he had hired the guitar. His pipe\r\nwas in his mouth--reversed; for it had gone out, and the ashes were\r\nspilled all over his trousers, where holes were often burned in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nQuite gratuitously, and with a pleasing Scotch accent, he began to\r\ndeclaim:\r\n\r\n    "A street there is in Paris famous\r\n       For which no rhyme our language yields;\r\n     Roo Nerve day Petty Shong its name is--\r\n       The New Street of the Little Fields...."\r\n\r\nAnd then, in his keen appreciation of the immortal stanza, he chuckled\r\naudibly, with a face so blithe and merry and well pleased that it did\r\none good to look at him.\r\n\r\nHe also had entered life by another door. His parents (good, pious\r\npeople in Dundee) had intended that he should be a solicitor, as his\r\nfather and grandfather had been before him. And here he was in Paris\r\nfamous, painting toreadors, and spouting the "Ballad of the\r\nBouillabaisse," as he would often do out of sheer lightness of\r\nheart--much oftener, indeed, than he would say his prayers.\r\n\r\nKneeling on the divan, with his elbow on the window-sill, was a third\r\nand much younger youth. The third he was "Little Billee." He had pulled\r\ndown the green baize blind, and was looking over the roofs and\r\nchimney-pots of Paris and all about with all his eyes, munching the\r\nwhile a roll and a savory saveloy, in which there was evidence of much\r\ngarlic. He ate with great relish, for he was very hungry; he had been\r\nall the morning at Carrel\'s studio, drawing from the life.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee was small and slender, about twenty or twenty-one, and had\r\na straight white forehead veined with blue, large dark-blue eyes,\r\ndelicate, regular features, and coal-black hair. He was also very\r\ngraceful and well built, with very small hands and feet, and much better\r\ndressed than his friends, who went out of their way to outdo the\r\ndenizens of the quartier latin in careless eccentricity of garb, and\r\nsucceeded. And in his winning and handsome face there was just a faint\r\nsuggestion of some possible very remote Jewish ancestor--just a tinge of\r\nthat strong, sturdy, irrepressible, indomitable, indelible blood which\r\nis of such priceless value in diluted hom\xc5\x93opathic doses, like the dry\r\nwhite Spanish wine called montijo, which is not meant to be taken pure;\r\nbut without a judicious admixture of which no sherry can go round the\r\nworld and keep its flavor intact; or like the famous bull-dog strain,\r\nwhich is not beautiful in itself; and yet just for lacking a little of\r\nthe same no greyhound can ever hope to be a champion. So, at least, I\r\nhave been told by wine-merchants and dog-fanciers--the most veracious\r\npersons that can be. Fortunately for the world, and especially for\r\nourselves, most of us have in our veins at least a minim of that\r\nprecious fluid, whether we know it or show it or not. _Tant pis pour les\r\nautres!_\r\n\r\nAs Little Billee munched he also gazed at the busy place below--the\r\nPlace St. Anatole des Arts--at the old houses opposite, some of which\r\nwere being pulled down, no doubt lest they should fall of their own\r\nsweet will. In the gaps between he would see discolored, old, cracked,\r\ndingy walls, with mysterious windows and rusty iron balconies of great\r\nantiquity--sights that set him dreaming dreams of medi\xc3\xa6val French love\r\nand wickedness and crime, bygone mysteries of Paris!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE THIRD HE WAS \'LITTLE BILLEE\'"]\r\n\r\nOne gap went right through the block, and gave him a glimpse of the\r\nriver, the "Cit\xc3\xa9," and the ominous old Morgue; a little to the right\r\nrose the gray towers of Notre Dame de Paris into the checkered April\r\nsky. Indeed, the top of nearly all Paris lay before him, with a little\r\nstretch of the imagination on his part; and he gazed with a sense of\r\nnovelty, an interest and a pleasure for which he could not have found\r\nany expression in mere language.\r\n\r\nParis! Paris!! Paris!!!\r\n\r\nThe very name had always been one to conjure with, whether he thought of\r\nit as a mere sound on the lips and in the ear, or as a magical written\r\nor printed word for the eye. And here was the thing itself at last, and\r\nhe, he himself, ipsissimus, in the very midst of it, to live there and\r\nlearn there as long as he liked, and make himself the great artist he\r\nlonged to be.\r\n\r\nThen, his meal finished, he lit a pipe, and flung himself on the divan\r\nand sighed deeply, out of the over-full contentment of his heart.\r\n\r\nHe felt he had never known happiness like this, never even dreamed its\r\npossibility. And yet his life had been a happy one. He was young and\r\ntender, was Little Billee; he had never been to any school, and was\r\ninnocent of the world and its wicked ways; innocent of French\r\nespecially, and the ways of Paris and its Latin quarter. He had been\r\nbrought up and educated at home, had spent his boyhood in London with\r\nhis mother and sister, who now lived in Devonshire on somewhat\r\nstraitened means. His father, who was dead, had been a clerk in the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nHe and his two friends, Taffy and the Laird, had taken this studio\r\ntogether. The Laird slept there, in a small bedroom off the studio.\r\nTaffy had a bedroom at the H\xc3\xb4tel de Seine, in the street of that name.\r\nLittle Billee lodged at the H\xc3\xb4tel Corneille, in the Place de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his two friends, and wondered if any one, living or dead,\r\nhad ever had such a glorious pair of chums as these.\r\n\r\nWhatever they did, whatever they said, was simply perfect in his eyes;\r\nthey were his guides and philosophers as well as his chums. On the other\r\nhand, Taffy and the Laird were as fond of the boy as they could be.\r\n\r\nHis absolute belief in all they said and did touched them none the less\r\nthat they were conscious of its being somewhat in excess of their\r\ndeserts. His almost girlish purity of mind amused and charmed them, and\r\nthey did all they could to preserve it, even in the quartier latin,\r\nwhere purity is apt to go bad if it be kept too long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "IT DID ONE GOOD TO LOOK AT HIM"]\r\n\r\nThey loved him for his affectionate disposition, his lively and\r\ncaressing ways; and they admired him far more than he ever knew, for\r\nthey recognized in him a quickness, a keenness, a delicacy of\r\nperception, in matters of form and color, a mysterious facility and\r\nfelicity of execution, a sense of all that was sweet and beautiful in\r\nnature, and a ready power of expressing it, that had not been vouchsafed\r\nto them in any such generous profusion, and which, as they ungrudgingly\r\nadmitted to themselves and each other, amounted to true genius.\r\n\r\nAnd when one within the immediate circle of our intimates is gifted in\r\nthis abnormal fashion, we either hate or love him for it, in proportion\r\nto the greatness of his gift; according to the way we are built.\r\n\r\nSo Taffy and the Laird loved Little Billee--loved him very much indeed.\r\nNot but what Little Billee had his faults. For instance, he didn\'t\r\ninterest himself very warmly in other people\'s pictures. He didn\'t seem\r\nto care for the Laird\'s guitar-playing toreador, nor for his serenaded\r\nlady--at all events, he never said anything about them, either in praise\r\nor blame. He looked at Taffy\'s realisms (for Taffy was a realist) in\r\nsilence, and nothing tries true friendship so much as silence of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nBut, then, to make up for it, when they all three went to the Louvre, he\r\ndidn\'t seem to trouble much about Titian either, or Rembrandt, or\r\nVelasquez, Rubens, Veronese, or Leonardo. He looked at the people who\r\nlooked at the pictures, instead of at the pictures themselves;\r\nespecially at the people who copied them, the sometimes charming young\r\nlady painters--and these seemed to him even more charming than they\r\nreally were--and he looked a great deal out of the Louvre windows,\r\nwhere there was much to be seen: more Paris, for instance--Paris, of\r\nwhich he could never have enough.\r\n\r\nBut when, surfeited with classical beauty, they all three went and dined\r\ntogether, and Taffy and the Laird said beautiful things about the old\r\nmasters, and quarrelled about them, he listened with deference and rapt\r\nattention, and reverentially agreed with all they said, and afterwards\r\nmade the most delightfully funny little pen-and-ink sketches of them,\r\nsaying all these beautiful things (which he sent to his mother and\r\nsister at home); so life-like, so real, that you could almost hear the\r\nbeautiful things they said; so beautifully drawn that you felt the old\r\nmasters couldn\'t have drawn them better themselves; and so irresistibly\r\ndroll that you felt that the old masters could not have drawn them at\r\nall--any more than Milton could have described the quarrel between\r\nSairey Gamp and Betsy Prig; no one, in short, but Little Billee.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee took up the "Ballad of the Bouillabaisse" where the Laird\r\nhad left it off, and speculated on the future of himself and his\r\nfriends, when he should have got to forty years--an almost impossibly\r\nremote future.\r\n\r\nThese speculations were interrupted by a loud knock at the door, and two\r\nmen came in.\r\n\r\nFirst, a tall, bony individual of any age between thirty and forty-five,\r\nof Jewish aspect, well-featured but sinister. He was very shabby and\r\ndirty, and wore a red b\xc3\xa9ret and a large velveteen cloak, with a big\r\nmetal clasp at the collar. His thick, heavy, languid, lustreless black\r\nhair fell down behind his ears on to his shoulders, in that\r\nmusicianlike way that is so offensive to the normal Englishman. He had\r\nbold, brilliant black eyes, with long, heavy lids, a thin, sallow face,\r\nand a beard of burnt-up black which grew almost from his under eyelids;\r\nand over it his mustache, a shade lighter, fell in two long spiral\r\ntwists. He went by the name of Svengali, and spoke fluent French with a\r\nGerman accent, and humorous German twists and idioms, and his voice was\r\nvery thin and mean and harsh, and often broke into a disagreeable\r\nfalsetto.\r\n\r\nHis companion was a little swarthy young man--a gypsy, possibly--much\r\npitted with the small-pox, and also very shabby. He had large, soft,\r\naffectionate brown eyes, like a King Charles spaniel. He had small,\r\nnervous, veiny hands, with nails bitten down to the quick, and carried a\r\nfiddle and a fiddlestick under his arm, without a case, as though he had\r\nbeen playing in the street.\r\n\r\n"Ponchour, mes enfants," said Svengali. "Che vous am\xc3\xa8ne mon ami Checko,\r\nqui choue du fiolon gomme un anche!"\r\n\r\nLittle Billee, who adored all "sweet musicianers," jumped up and made\r\nGecko as warmly welcome as he could in his early French.\r\n\r\n"Ha! le bi\xc3\xa2no!" exclaimed Svengali, flinging his red b\xc3\xa9ret on it, and\r\nhis cloak on the ground. "Ch\'esp\xc3\xa8re qu\'il est pon, et pien t\'accord!"\r\n\r\nAnd sitting down on the music-stool, he ran up and down the scales with\r\nthat easy power, that smooth, even crispness of touch, which reveal the\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMONG THE OLD MASTERS]\r\n\r\nThen he fell to playing Chopin\'s impromptu in A flat, so beautifully\r\nthat Little Billee\'s heart went nigh to bursting with suppressed\r\nemotion and delight. He had never heard any music of Chopin\'s before,\r\nnothing but British provincial home-made music--melodies with\r\nvariations, "Annie Laurie," "The Last Rose of Summer," "The Blue Bells\r\nof Scotland;" innocent little motherly and sisterly tinklings, invented\r\nto set the company at their ease on festive evenings, and make all-round\r\nconversation possible for shy people; who fear the unaccompanied sound\r\nof their own voices, and whose genial chatter always leaves off directly\r\nthe music ceases.\r\n\r\nHe never forgot that impromptu, which he was destined to hear again one\r\nday in strange circumstances.\r\n\r\nThen Svengali and Gecko made music together, divinely. Little\r\nfragmentary things, sometimes consisting but of a few bars, but these\r\nbars of _such_ beauty and meaning! Scraps, snatches, short melodies,\r\nmeant to fetch, to charm immediately, or to melt or sadden or madden\r\njust for a moment, and that knew just when to leave off--czardas, gypsy\r\ndances, Hungarian love-plaints, things little known out of eastern\r\nEurope in the fifties of this century, till the Laird and Taffy were\r\nalmost as wild in their enthusiasm as Little Billee--a silent enthusiasm\r\ntoo deep for speech. And when these two great artists left off to smoke,\r\nthe three Britishers were too much moved even for that, and there was a\r\nstillness....\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came a loud knuckle-rapping at the outer door, and a\r\nportentous voice of great volume, and that might almost have belonged to\r\nany sex (even an angel\'s), uttered the British milkman\'s yodel,"Milk\r\nbelow!" and before any one could say "Entrez," a strange figure\r\nappeared, framed by the gloom of the little antechamber.\r\n\r\nIt was the figure of a very tall and fully developed young female, clad\r\nin the gray overcoat of a French infantry soldier, continued netherwards\r\nby a short striped petticoat, beneath which were visible her bare white\r\nankles and insteps, and slim, straight, rosy heels, clean cut and smooth\r\nas the back of a razor; her toes lost themselves in a huge pair of male\r\nlist slippers, which made her drag her feet as she walked.\r\n\r\nShe bore herself with easy, unembarrassed grace, like a person whose\r\nnerves and muscles are well in tune, whose spirits are high, who has\r\nlived much in the atmosphere of French studios, and feels at home in it.\r\n\r\nThis strange medley of garments was surmounted by a small bare head with\r\nshort, thick, wavy brown hair, and a very healthy young face, which\r\ncould scarcely be called quite beautiful at first sight, since the eyes\r\nwere too wide apart, the mouth too large, the chin too massive, the\r\ncomplexion a mass of freckles. Besides, you can never tell how beautiful\r\n(or how ugly) a face may be till you have tried to draw it.\r\n\r\nBut a small portion of her neck, down by the collar-bone, which just\r\nshowed itself between the unbuttoned lapels of her military coat collar,\r\nwas of a delicate privetlike whiteness that is never to be found on any\r\nFrench neck, and very few English ones. Also, she had a very fine brow,\r\nbroad and low, with thick level eyebrows much darker than her hair, a\r\nbroad, bony, high bridge to her short nose, and her full, broad cheeks\r\nwere beautifully modelled. She would have made a singularly handsome\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nAs the creature looked round at the assembled company and flashed her\r\nbig white teeth at them in an all-embracing smile of uncommon width and\r\nquite irresistible sweetness, simplicity, and friendly trust, one saw at\r\na glance that she was out of the common clever, simple, humorous,\r\nhonest, brave, and kind, and accustomed to be genially welcomed wherever\r\nshe went. Then suddenly closing the door behind her, dropping her smile,\r\nand looking wistful and sweet, with her head on one side and her arms\r\nakimbo, "Ye\'re all English, now, aren\'t ye?" she exclaimed. "I heard the\r\nmusic, and thought I\'d just come in for a bit, and pass the time of day:\r\nyou don\'t mind? Trilby, that\'s my name--Trilby O\'Ferrall."\r\n\r\nShe said this in English, with an accent half Scotch and certain French\r\nintonations, and in a voice so rich and deep and full as almost to\r\nsuggest an incipient tenore robusto; and one felt instinctively that it\r\nwas a real pity she wasn\'t a boy, she would have made such a jolly one.\r\n\r\n"We\'re delighted, on the contrary," said Little Billee, and advanced a\r\nchair for her.\r\n\r\nBut she said, "Oh, don\'t mind me; go on with the music," and sat herself\r\ndown cross-legged on the model-throne near the piano.\r\n\r\nAs they still looked at her, curious and half embarrassed, she pulled a\r\npaper parcel containing food out of one of the coat-pockets, and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "WISTFUL AND SWEET"]\r\n\r\n"I\'ll just take a bite, if you don\'t object; I\'m a model, you know, and\r\nit\'s just rung twelve--\'the rest.\' I\'m posing for Durien the sculptor,\r\non the next floor. I pose to him for the altogether."\r\n\r\n"The altogether?" asked Little Billee.\r\n\r\n"Yes--_l\'ensemble_, you know--head, hands, and\r\nfeet--everything--especially feet. That\'s my foot," she said, kicking\r\noff her big slipper and stretching out the limb. "It\'s the handsomest\r\nfoot in all Paris. There\'s only one in all Paris to match it, and here\r\nit is," and she laughed heartily (like a merry peal of bells), and stuck\r\nout the other.\r\n\r\nAnd in truth they were astonishingly beautiful feet, such as one only\r\nsees in pictures and statues--a true inspiration of shape and color, all\r\nmade up of delicate lengths and subtly modulated curves and noble\r\nstraightnesses and happy little dimpled arrangements in innocent young\r\npink and white.\r\n\r\nSo that Little Billee, who had the quick, prehensile, \xc3\xa6sthetic eye, and\r\nknew by the grace of Heaven what the shapes and sizes and colors of\r\nalmost every bit of man, woman, or child should be (and so seldom are),\r\nwas quite bewildered to find that a real, bare, live human foot could be\r\nsuch a charming object to look at, and felt that such a base or pedestal\r\nlent quite an antique and Olympian dignity to a figure that seemed just\r\nthen rather grotesque in its mixed attire of military overcoat and\r\nfemale petticoat, and nothing else!\r\n\r\nPoor Trilby!\r\n\r\nThe shape of those lovely slender feet (that were neither large nor\r\nsmall), fac-similed in dusty, pale plaster of Paris, survives on the\r\nshelves and walls of many a studio throughout the world, and many a\r\nsculptor yet unborn has yet to marvel at their strange perfection, in\r\nstudious despair.\r\n\r\nFor when Dame Nature takes it into her head to do her very best, and\r\nbestow her minutest attention on a mere detail, as happens now and\r\nthen--once in a blue moon, perhaps--she makes it uphill work for poor\r\nhuman art to keep pace with her.\r\n\r\nIt is a wondrous thing, the human foot--like the human hand; even more\r\nso, perhaps; but, unlike the hand, with which we are so familiar, it is\r\nseldom a thing of beauty in civilized adults who go about in leather\r\nboots or shoes.\r\n\r\nSo that it is hidden away in disgrace, a thing to be thrust out of sight\r\nand forgotten. It can sometimes be very ugly, indeed--the ugliest thing\r\nthere is, even in the fairest and highest and most gifted of her sex;\r\nand then it is of an ugliness to chill and kill romance, and scatter\r\nyoung love\'s dream, and almost break the heart.\r\n\r\nAnd all for the sake of a high heel and a ridiculously pointed toe--mean\r\nthings, at the best!\r\n\r\nConversely, when Mother Nature has taken extra pains in the building of\r\nit, and proper care or happy chance has kept it free of lamentable\r\ndeformations, indurations, and discolorations--all those grewsome\r\nboot-begotten abominations which have made it so generally\r\nunpopular--the sudden sight of it, uncovered, comes as a very rare and\r\nsingularly pleasing surprise to the eye that has learned how to see!\r\n\r\nNothing else that Mother Nature has to show, not even the human face\r\ndivine, has more subtle power to suggest high physical distinction,\r\nhappy evolution, and supreme development; the lordship of man over\r\nbeast, the lordship of man over man, the lordship of woman over all!\r\n\r\n_En, voil\xc3\xa0, de l\'\xc3\xa9loquence--\xc3\xa0 propos de bottes!_\r\n\r\nTrilby had respected Mother Nature\'s special gift to herself--had never\r\nworn a leather boot or shoe, had always taken as much care of her feet\r\nas many a fine lady takes of her hands. It was her one coquetry, the\r\nonly real vanity she had.\r\n\r\nGecko, his fiddle in one hand and his bow in the other, stared at her in\r\nopen-mouthed admiration and delight, as she ate her sandwich of\r\nsoldier\'s bread and _fromage \xc3\xa0 la cr\xc3\xa8me_ quite unconcerned.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished she licked the tips of her fingers clean of\r\ncheese, and produced a small tobacco-pouch from another military pocket,\r\nand made herself a cigarette, and lit it and smoked it, inhaling the\r\nsmoke in large whiffs, filling her lungs with it, and sending it back\r\nthrough her nostrils, with a look of great beatitude.\r\n\r\nSvengali played Schubert\'s "Rosemonde," and flashed a pair of\r\nlanguishing black eyes at her with intent to kill.\r\n\r\nBut she didn\'t even look his way. She looked at Little Billee, at big\r\nTaffy, at the Laird, at the casts and studies, at the sky, the\r\nchimney-pots over the way, the towers of Notre Dame, just visible from\r\nwhere she sat.\r\n\r\nOnly when he finished she exclaimed: "Ma\xc3\xafe, a\xc3\xafe! c\'est rudement bien\r\ntap\xc3\xa9, c\'te musique-l\xc3\xa0! Seulement, c\'est pas gai, vous savez! Comment\r\nq\'\xc3\xa7a s\'appelle?"\r\n\r\n"It is called the \'Rosemonde\' of Schubert, matemoiselle," replied\r\nSvengali. (I will translate.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE "ROSEMONDE" OF SCHUBERT]\r\n\r\n"And what\'s that--Rosemonde?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Rosemonde was a princess of Cyprus, matemoiselle, and Cyprus is an\r\nisland."\r\n\r\n"Ah, and Schubert, then--where\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Schubert is not an island, matemoiselle. Schubert was a compatriot of\r\nmine, and made music, and played the piano, just like me."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Schubert was a _monsieur_, then. Don\'t know him; never heard his\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"That is a pity, matemoiselle. He had some talent. You like this better,\r\nperhaps," and he strummed,\r\n\r\n    "Messieurs les \xc3\xa9tudiants,\r\n     S\'en vont \xc3\xa0 la chaumi\xc3\xa8re\r\n     Pour y danser le cancan,"\r\n\r\nstriking wrong notes, and banging out a bass in a different key--a\r\nhideously grotesque performance.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I like that better. It\'s gayer, you know. Is that also composed by\r\na compatriot of yours?" asked the lady.\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid, matemoiselle."\r\n\r\nAnd the laugh was against Svengali.\r\n\r\nBut the real fun of it all (if there was any) lay in the fact that she\r\nwas perfectly sincere.\r\n\r\n"Are you fond of music?" asked Little Billee.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ain\'t I, just!" she replied. "My father sang like a bird. He was a\r\ngentleman and a scholar, my father was. His name was Patrick Michael\r\nO\'Ferrall, fellow of Trinity, Cambridge. He used to sing \'Ben Bolt.\' Do\r\nyou know \'Ben Bolt\'?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I know it well," said Little Billee. "It\'s a very pretty\r\nsong."\r\n\r\n"I can sing it," said Miss O\'Ferrall. "Shall I?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly, if you will be so kind."\r\n\r\nMiss O\'Ferrall threw away the end of her cigarette, put her hands on her\r\nknees as she sat cross-legged on the model-throne, and sticking her\r\nelbows well out, she looked up to the ceiling with a tender, sentimental\r\nsmile, and sang the touching song,\r\n\r\n    "Oh, don\'t you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt?\r\n     Sweet Alice, with hair so brown?" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAs some things are too sad and too deep for tears, so some things are\r\ntoo grotesque and too funny for laughter. Of such a kind was Miss\r\nO\'Ferrall\'s performance of "Ben Bolt."\r\n\r\nFrom that capacious mouth and through that high-bridged bony nose there\r\nrolled a volume of breathy sound, not loud, but so immense that it\r\nseemed to come from all round, to be reverberated from every surface in\r\nthe studio. She followed more or less the shape of the tune, going up\r\nwhen it rose and down when it fell, but with such immense intervals\r\nbetween the notes as were never dreamed of in any mortal melody. It was\r\nas though she could never once have deviated into tune, never once have\r\nhit upon a true note, even by a fluke--in fact, as though she were\r\nabsolutely tone-deaf and without ear, although she stuck to the time\r\ncorrectly enough.\r\n\r\nShe finished her song amid an embarrassing silence. The audience didn\'t\r\nquite know whether it were meant for fun or seriously. One wondered if\r\nshe were not paying out Svengali for his impertinent performance of\r\n"Messieurs les \xc3\xa9tudiants." If so, it was a capital piece of impromptu\r\ntit-for-tat admirably acted, and a very ugly gleam yellowed the tawny\r\nblack of Svengali\'s big eyes. He was so fond of making fun of others\r\nthat he particularly resented being made fun of himself--couldn\'t endure\r\nthat any one should ever have the laugh of _him_.\r\n\r\nAt length Little Billee said: "Thank you so much. It is a capital song."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss O\'Ferrall. "It\'s the only song I know, unfortunately.\r\nMy father used to sing it, just like that, when he felt jolly after hot\r\nrum and water. It used to make people cry; he used to cry over it\r\nhimself. _I_ never do. Some people think I can\'t sing a bit. All I can\r\nsay is that I\'ve often had to sing it six or seven times running in\r\n_lots_ of studios. I vary it, you know--not the words, but the tune. You\r\nmust remember that I\'ve only taken to it lately. Do you know Litolff?\r\nWell, he\'s a great composer, and he came to Durien\'s the other day, and\r\nI sang \'Ben Bolt,\' and what do you think he said? Why, he said Madame\r\nAlboni couldn\'t go nearly so high or so low as I did, and that her voice\r\nwasn\'t half so strong. He gave me his word of honor. He said I breathed\r\nas natural and straight as a baby, and all I want is to get my voice a\r\nlittle more under control. That\'s what _he_ said."\r\n\r\n"Qu\'est-ce qu\'elle dit?" asked Svengali. And she said it all over again\r\nto him in French--quite French French--of the most colloquial kind. Her\r\naccent was not that of the Com\xc3\xa9die Fran\xc3\xa7aise, nor yet that of the\r\nFaubourg St. Germain, nor yet that of the pavement. It was quaint and\r\nexpressive--"funny without being vulgar."\r\n\r\n"Barpleu! he was right, Litolff," said Svengali. "I assure you,\r\nmatemoiselle, that I have never heard a voice that can equal yours; you\r\nhave a talent quite exceptional."\r\n\r\nShe blushed with pleasure, and the others thought him a "beastly cad"\r\nfor poking fun at the poor girl in such a way. And they thought Monsieur\r\nLitolff another.\r\n\r\nShe then got up and shook the crumbs off her coat, and slipped her feet\r\ninto Durien\'s slippers, saying, in English: "Well, I\'ve got to go back.\r\nLife ain\'t all beer and skittles, and more\'s the pity; but what\'s the\r\nodds, so long as you\'re happy?"\r\n\r\nOn her way out she stopped before Taffy\'s picture--a chiffonnier with\r\nhis lantern bending over a dust heap. For Taffy was, or thought himself,\r\na passionate realist in those days. He has changed, and now paints\r\nnothing but King Arthurs and Guineveres and Lancelots and Elaines and\r\nfloating Ladies of Shalott.\r\n\r\n"That chiffonnier\'s basket isn\'t hitched high enough," she remarked.\r\n"How could he tap his pick against the rim and make the rag fall into it\r\nif it\'s hitched only half-way up his back? And he\'s got the wrong\r\nsabots, and the wrong lantern; it\'s _all_ wrong."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Taffy, turning very red; "you seem to know a lot about\r\nit. It\'s a pity you don\'t paint, yourself."\r\n\r\n"Ah! now you\'re cross!" said Miss O\'Ferrall. "Oh, ma\xc3\xafe, a\xc3\xafe!"\r\n\r\nShe went to the door and paused, looking round benignly. "What nice\r\nteeth you\'ve all three got. That\'s because you\'re Englishmen, I suppose,\r\nand clean them twice a day. I do too. Trilby O\'Ferrall, that\'s my name,\r\n48 Rue des Pousse-Cailloux!--pose pour l\'ensemble, quand \xc3\xa7a l\'amuse!\r\nva-t-en ville, et fait tout ce qui concerne son \xc3\xa9tat! Don\'t forget.\r\nThanks all, and good-bye."\r\n\r\n"En v\'l\xc3\xa0 une orichinale," said Svengali.\r\n\r\n"I think she\'s lovely," said Little Billee, the young and tender. "Oh,\r\nheavens, what angel\'s feet! It makes me sick to think she sits for the\r\nfigure. I\'m sure she\'s quite a lady."\r\n\r\nAnd in five minutes or so, with the point of an old compass, he\r\nscratched in white on the dark red wall a three-quarter profile outline\r\nof Trilby\'s left foot, which was perhaps the more perfect poem of the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nSlight as it was, this little piece of impromptu etching, in its sense\r\nof beauty, in its quick seizing of a peculiar individuality, its subtle\r\nrendering of a strongly received impression, was already the work of a\r\nmaster. It was Trilby\'s foot, and nobody else\'s, nor could have been,\r\nand nobody else but Little Billee could have drawn it in just that\r\ninspired way.\r\n\r\n"Qu\'est-ce que c\'est, \'Ben Bolt\'?" inquired Gecko.\r\n\r\nUpon which Little Billee was made by Taffy to sit down to the piano and\r\nsing it. He sang it very nicely with his pleasant little throaty English\r\nbarytone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRILBY\'S LEFT FOOT]\r\n\r\nIt was solely in order that Little Billee should have opportunities of\r\npractising this graceful accomplishment of his, for his own and his\r\nfriends\' delectation, that the piano had been sent over from London,\r\nat great cost to Taffy and the Laird. It had belonged to Taffy\'s mother,\r\nwho was dead.\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished the second verse, Svengali exclaimed: "Mais c\'est\r\ntout-\xc3\xa0-fait chentil! Allons, Gecko, chouez-nous \xc3\xa7a!"\r\n\r\nAnd he put his big hands on the piano, over Little Billee\'s, pushed him\r\noff the music-stool with his great gaunt body, and, sitting on it\r\nhimself, he played a masterly prelude. It was impressive to hear the\r\ncomplicated richness and volume of the sounds he evoked after Little\r\nBillee\'s gentle "tink-a-tink."\r\n\r\nAnd Gecko, cuddling lovingly his violin and closing his upturned eyes,\r\nplayed that simple melody as it had probably never been played\r\nbefore--such passion, such pathos, such a tone!--and they turned it and\r\ntwisted it, and went from one key to another, playing into each other\'s\r\nhands, Svengali taking the lead; and fugued and canoned and\r\ncounterpointed and battle-doored and shuttlecocked it, high and low,\r\nsoft and loud, in minor, in pizzicato, and in sordino--adagio, andante,\r\nallegretto, scherzo--and exhausted all its possibilities of beauty; till\r\ntheir susceptible audience of three was all but crazed with delight and\r\nwonder; and the masterful Ben Bolt, and his over-tender Alice, and his\r\ntoo submissive friend, and his old schoolmaster so kind and so true, and\r\nhis long-dead schoolmates, and the rustic porch and the mill, and the\r\nslab of granite so gray,\r\n\r\n    "And the dear little nook\r\n     By the clear running brook,"\r\n\r\nwere all magnified into a strange, almost holy poetic dignity and\r\nsplendor quite undreamed of by whoever wrote the words and music of that\r\nunsophisticated little song, which has touched so many simple British\r\nhearts that don\'t know any better--and among them, once, that of the\r\npresent scribe--long, long ago!\r\n\r\n"Sacrepleu! il choue pien, le Checko, hein?" said Svengali, when they\r\nhad brought this wonderful double improvisation to a climax and a close.\r\n"C\'est mon \xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8fe! che le fais chanter sur son fiolon, c\'est comme si\r\nc\'\xc3\xa9tait _moi_ qui chantais! ach! si ch\'afais pour teux sous de voix, che\r\nserais le bremier chanteur du monte! I cannot sing!" he continued. (I\r\nwill translate him into English, without attempting to translate his\r\naccent, which is a mere matter of judiciously transposing p\'s and b\'s,\r\nand t\'s and d\'s, and f\'s and v\'s, and g\'s and k\'s, and turning the soft\r\nFrench j into sch, and a pretty language into an ugly one.)\r\n\r\n"I cannot sing myself, I cannot play the violin, but I can teach--hein,\r\nGecko? And I have a pupil--hein, Gecko?--la betite Honorine;" and here\r\nhe leered all round with a leer that was not engaging. "The world shall\r\nhear of la betite Honorine some day--hein, Gecko? Listen all--this is\r\nhow I teach la betite Honorine! Gecko, play me a little accompaniment in\r\npizzicato."\r\n\r\nAnd he pulled out of his pocket a kind of little flexible flageolet (of\r\nhis own invention, it seems), which he screwed together and put to his\r\nlips, and on this humble instrument he played "Ben Bolt," while Gecko\r\naccompanied him, using his fiddle as a guitar, his adoring eyes fixed in\r\nreverence on his master.\r\n\r\nAnd it would be impossible to render in any words the deftness, the\r\ndistinction, the grace, power, pathos, and passion with which this truly\r\nphenomenal artist executed the poor old twopenny tune on his elastic\r\npenny whistle--for it was little more--such thrilling, vibrating,\r\npiercing tenderness, now loud and full, a shrill scream of anguish, now\r\nsoft as a whisper, a mere melodic breath, more human almost than the\r\nhuman voice itself, a perfection unattainable even by Gecko, a master,\r\non an instrument which is the acknowledged king of all!\r\n\r\nSo that the tear which had been so close to the brink of Little Billee\'s\r\neye while Gecko was playing now rose and trembled under his eyelid and\r\nspilled itself down his nose; and he had to dissemble and\r\nsurreptitiously mop it up with his little finger as he leaned his chin\r\non his hand, and cough a little husky, unnatural cough--_pour se donner\r\nune contenance_!\r\n\r\nHe had never heard such music as this, never dreamed such music was\r\npossible. He was conscious, while it lasted, that he saw deeper into the\r\nbeauty, the sadness of things, the very heart of them, and their\r\npathetic evanescence, as with a new, inner eye--even into eternity\r\nitself, beyond the veil--a vague cosmic vision that faded when the music\r\nwas over, but left an unfading reminiscence of its having been, and a\r\npassionate desire to express the like some day through the plastic\r\nmedium of his own beautiful art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLEXIBLE FLAGEOLET]\r\n\r\nWhen Svengali ended, he leered again on his dumb-struck audience, and\r\nsaid: "That is how I teach la betite Honorine to sing; that is how I\r\nteach Gecko to play; that is how I teach \'_il bel canto_\'! It was\r\nlost, the bel canto--but I found it, in a dream--I, and nobody\r\nelse--I--Svengali--I--I--_I!_ But that is enough of music; let us play\r\nat something else--let us play at this!" he cried, jumping up and\r\nseizing a foil and bending it against the wall.... "Come along, Little\r\nPillee, and I will show you something more you don\'t know...."\r\n\r\nSo Little Billee took off coat and waistcoat, donned mask and glove and\r\nfencing-shoes, and they had an "assault of arms," as it is nobly called\r\nin French, and in which poor Little Billee came off very badly. The\r\nGerman Pole fenced wildly, but well.\r\n\r\nThen it was the Laird\'s turn, and he came off badly too; so then Taffy\r\ntook up the foil, and redeemed the honor of Great Britain, as became a\r\nBritish hussar and a Man of Blood. For Taffy, by long and assiduous\r\npractice in the best school in Paris (and also by virtue of his native\r\naptitudes), was a match for any ma\xc3\xaetre d\'armes in the whole French army,\r\nand Svengali got "what for."\r\n\r\nAnd when it was time to give up play and settle down to work, others\r\ndropped in--French, English, Swiss, German, American, Greek; curtains\r\nwere drawn and shutters opened; the studio was flooded with light--and\r\nthe afternoon was healthily spent in athletic and gymnastic exercises\r\ntill dinner-time.\r\n\r\nBut Little Billee, who had had enough of fencing and gymnastics for the\r\nday, amused himself by filling up with black and white and red\r\nchalk-strokes the outline of Trilby\'s foot on the wall, lest he should\r\nforget his fresh vision of it, which was still to him as the thing\r\nitself--an absolute reality, born of a mere glance, a mere chance.\r\n\r\nDurien came in and looked over his shoulder, and exclaimed: "Tiens! le\r\npied de Trilby! vous avez fait \xc3\xa7a d\'apr\xc3\xa8s nature?"\r\n\r\n"Nong!"\r\n\r\n"De m\xc3\xa9moire, alors?"\r\n\r\n"Wee!"\r\n\r\n"Je vous en fais mon compliment! Vous avez eu la main heureuse. Je\r\nvoudrais bien avoir fait \xc3\xa7a, moi! C\'est un petit chef-d\'\xc5\x93uvre que\r\nvous avez fait l\xc3\xa0--tout bonnement, mon cher! Mais vous \xc3\xa9laborez trop. De\r\ngr\xc3\xa2ce, n\'y touchez plus!"\r\n\r\nAnd Little Billee was pleased, and touched it no more; for Durien was a\r\ngreat sculptor, and sincerity itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd then--well, I happen to forget what sort of day this particular day\r\nturned into at about six of the clock.\r\n\r\nIf it was decently fine, the most of them went off to dine at the\r\nRestaurant de la Couronne, kept by the P\xc3\xa8re Trin, in the Rue de\r\nMonsieur, who gave you of his best to eat and drink for twenty sols\r\nParisis, or one franc in the coin of the empire. Good distending soups,\r\nomelets that were only too savory, lentils, red and white beans, meat so\r\ndressed and sauced and seasoned that you didn\'t know whether it were\r\nbeef or mutton--flesh, fowl, or good red herring--or even bad, for that\r\nmatter--nor very greatly care.\r\n\r\nAnd just the same lettuce, radishes, and cheese of Gruy\xc3\xa8re or Brie as\r\nyou got at the Trois Fr\xc3\xa8res Proven\xc3\xa7aux (but not the same butter!). And\r\nto wash it all down, generous wine in wooden "brocs"--that stained a\r\nlovely \xc3\xa6sthetic blue everything it was spilled over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRIDGE OF ARTS]\r\n\r\nAnd you hobnobbed with models, male and female, students of law and\r\nmedicine, painters and sculptors, workmen and blanchisseuses and\r\ngrisettes, and found them very good company, and most improving to your\r\nFrench, if your French was of the usual British kind, and even to some\r\nof your manners, if these were very British indeed. And the evening was\r\ninnocently wound up with billiards, cards, or dominos at the Caf\xc3\xa9 du\r\nLuxembourg opposite; or at the Th\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa2tre du Luxembourg, in the Rue de\r\nMadame, to see funny farces with screamingly droll Englishmen in them;\r\nor, still better, at the Jardin Bullier (la Closerie des Lilas), to see\r\nthe students dance the cancan, or try and dance it yourself, which is\r\nnot so easy as it seems; or, best of all, at the Th\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa2tre de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on, to\r\nsee some piece of classical _repertoire_.\r\n\r\nOr, if it were not only fine, but a Saturday afternoon into the bargain,\r\nthe Laird would put on a necktie and a few other necessary things, and\r\nthe three friends would walk arm in arm to Taffy\'s hotel in the Rue de\r\nSeine, and wait outside till he had made himself as presentable as the\r\nLaird, which did not take very long. And then (Little Billee was always\r\npresentable) they would, arm in arm, the huge Taffy in the middle,\r\ndescend the Rue de Seine and cross a bridge to the Cit\xc3\xa9, and have a look\r\nin at the Morgue. Then back again to the quays on the rive gauche by the\r\nPont Neuf, to wend their way westward; now on one side to look at the\r\nprint and picture shops and the magasins of bric-\xc3\xa0-brac, and haply\r\nsometimes buy thereof, now on the other to finger and cheapen the\r\nsecond-hand books for sale on the parapet, and even pick up one or two\r\nutterly unwanted bargains, never to be read or opened again.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Pont des Arts they would cross it, stopping in the\r\nmiddle to look up the river towards the old Cit\xc3\xa9 and Notre Dame,\r\neastward, and dream unutterable things, and try to utter them. Then,\r\nturning westward, they would gaze at the glowing sky and all it glowed\r\nupon--the corner of the Tuileries and the Louvre, the many bridges, the\r\nChamber of Deputies, the golden river narrowing its perspective and\r\nbroadening its bed as it went flowing and winding on its way between\r\nPassy and Grenelle to St. Cloud, to Rouen, to the Havre, to England\r\nperhaps--where _they_ didn\'t want to be just then; and they would try\r\nand express themselves to the effect that life was uncommonly well worth\r\nliving in that particular city at that particular time of the day and\r\nyear and century, at that particular epoch of their own mortal and\r\nuncertain lives.\r\n\r\nThen, still arm in arm and chatting gayly, across the court-yard of the\r\nLouvre, through gilded gates well guarded by reckless imperial Zouaves,\r\nup the arcaded Rue de Rivoli as far as the Rue Castiglione, where they\r\nwould stare with greedy eyes at the window of the great corner\r\npastry-cook, and marvel at the beautiful assortment of bonbons,\r\npralines, drag\xc3\xa9es, marrons glac\xc3\xa9s--saccharine, crystalline substances of\r\nall kinds and colors, as charming to look at as an illumination;\r\nprecious stones, delicately frosted sweets, pearls and diamonds so\r\narranged as to melt in the mouth; especially, at this particular time of\r\nthe year, the monstrous Easter-eggs of enchanting hue, enshrined like\r\ncostly jewels in caskets of satin and gold; and the Laird, who was well\r\nread in his English classics and liked to show it, would opine that\r\n"they managed these things better in France."\r\n\r\nThen across the street by a great gate into the All\xc3\xa9e des Feuillants,\r\nand up to the Place de la Concorde--to gaze, but quite without base\r\nenvy, at the smart people coming back from the Bois de Boulogne. For\r\neven in Paris "carriage people" have a way of looking bored, of taking\r\ntheir pleasure sadly, of having nothing to say to each other, as though\r\nthe vibration of so many wheels all rolling home the same way every\r\nafternoon had hypnotized them into silence, idiocy, and melancholia.\r\n\r\nAnd our three musketeers of the brush would speculate on the vanity of\r\nwealth and rank and fashion; on the satiety that follows in the wake of\r\nself-indulgence and overtakes it; on the weariness of the pleasures that\r\nbecome a toil--as if they knew all about it, had found it all out for\r\nthemselves, and nobody else had ever found it out before!\r\n\r\nThen they found out something else--namely, that the sting of healthy\r\nappetite was becoming intolerable; so they would betake themselves to an\r\nEnglish eating-house in the Rue de la Madeleine (on the left-hand side\r\nnear the top), where they would renovate their strength and their\r\npatriotism on British beef and beer, and household bread, and bracing,\r\nbiting, stinging yellow mustard, and horseradish, and noble apple-pie,\r\nand Cheshire cheese; and get through as much of these in an hour or so\r\nas they could for talking, talking, talking; such happy talk! as full of\r\nsanguine hope and enthusiasm, of cocksure commendation or condemnation\r\nof all painters, dead or alive, of modest but firm belief in themselves\r\nand each other, as a Paris Easter-egg is full of sweets and pleasantness\r\n(for the young).\r\n\r\nAnd then a stroll on the crowded, well-lighted boulevards, and a bock at\r\nthe caf\xc3\xa9 there, at a little three-legged marble table right out on the\r\ngenial asphalt pavement, still talking nineteen to the dozen.\r\n\r\nThen home by dark, old, silent streets and some deserted bridge to their\r\nbeloved Latin quarter, the Morgue gleaming cold and still and fatal in\r\nthe pale lamplight, and Notre Dame pricking up its watchful twin towers,\r\nwhich have looked down for so many centuries on so many happy, sanguine,\r\nexpansive youths walking arm in arm by twos and threes, and forever\r\ntalking, talking, talking....\r\n\r\nThe Laird and Little Billee would see Taffy safe to the door of his\r\nh\xc3\xb4tel garni in the Rue de Seine, where they would find much to say to\r\neach other before they said good-night--so much that Taffy and Little\r\nBillee would see the Laird safe to _his_ door, in the Place St. Anatole\r\ndes Arts. And then a discussion would arise between Taffy and the Laird\r\non the immortality of the soul, let us say, or the exact meaning of the\r\nword "gentleman," or the relative merits of Dickens and Thackeray, or\r\nsome such recondite and quite unhackneyed theme, and Taffy and the Laird\r\nwould escort Little Billee to _his_ door, in the Place de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on, and\r\nhe would re-escort them both back again, and so on till any hour you\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOr again, if it rained, and Paris through the studio window loomed\r\nlead-colored, with its shiny slate roofs under skies that were ashen and\r\nsober, and the wild west wind made woful music among the chimney-pots,\r\nand little gray waves ran up the river the wrong way, and the Morgue\r\nlooked chill and dark and wet, and almost uninviting (even to three\r\nhealthy-minded young Britons), they would resolve to dine and spend a\r\nhappy evening at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THREE MUSKETEERS OF THE BRUSH"]\r\n\r\nLittle Billee, taking with him three francs (or even four), would dive\r\ninto back streets and buy a yard or so of crusty new bread, well\r\nburned on the flat side, a fillet of beef, a litre of wine, potatoes and\r\nonions, butter, a little cylindrical cheese called "bondon de\r\nNeufch\xc3\xa2tel," tender curly lettuce, with chervil, parsley, spring onions,\r\nand other fine herbs, and a pod of garlic, which would be rubbed on a\r\ncrust of bread to flavor things with.\r\n\r\nTaffy would lay the cloth Englishwise, and also make the salad, for\r\nwhich, like everybody else I ever met, he had a special receipt of his\r\nown (putting in the oil first and the vinegar after); and indeed his\r\nsalads were quite as good as everybody else\'s.\r\n\r\nThe Laird, bending over the stove, would cook the onions and beef into a\r\nsavory Scotch mess so cunningly that you could not taste the beef for\r\nthe onions--nor always the onions for the garlic!\r\n\r\nAnd they would dine far better than at le P\xc3\xa8re Trin\'s, far better than\r\nat the English Restaurant in the Rue de la Madeleine--better than\r\nanywhere else on earth!\r\n\r\nAnd after dinner, what coffee, roasted and ground on the spot, what\r\npipes and cigarettes of "caporal," by the light of the three shaded\r\nlamps, while the rain beat against the big north window, and the wind\r\nwent howling round the quaint old medi\xc3\xa6val tower at the corner of the\r\nRue Vieille des Mauvais Ladres (the old street of the bad lepers), and\r\nthe damp logs hissed and crackled in the stove!\r\n\r\nWhat jolly talk into the small hours! Thackeray and Dickens again, and\r\nTennyson and Byron (who was "not dead yet" in those days); and Titian\r\nand Velasquez, and young Millais and Holman Hunt (just out); and\r\nMonsieur Ingres and Monsieur Delacroix, and Balzac and Stendhal and\r\nGeorge Sand; and the good Dumas! and Edgar Allan Poe; and the glory that\r\nwas Greece and the grandeur that was Rome....\r\n\r\nGood, honest, innocent, artless prattle--not of the wisest, perhaps, nor\r\nredolent of the very highest culture (which, by-the-way, can mar as well\r\nas make), nor leading to any very practical result; but quite\r\npathetically sweet from the sincerity and fervor of its convictions, a\r\nprofound belief in their importance, and a proud trust in their\r\nlife-long immutability.\r\n\r\nOh, happy days and happy nights, sacred to art and friendship! oh, happy\r\ntimes of careless impecuniosity, and youth and hope and health and\r\nstrength and freedom--with all Paris for a playground, and its dear old\r\nunregenerate Latin quarter for a workshop and a home!\r\n\r\nAnd, up to then, no kill-joy complications of love!\r\n\r\nNo, decidedly no! Little Billee had never known such happiness as\r\nthis--never even dreamed of its possibility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA day or two after this, our opening day, but in the afternoon, when the\r\nfencing and boxing had begun and the trapeze was in full swing, Trilby\'s\r\n"Milk below!" was sounded at the door, and she appeared--clothed this\r\ntime in her right mind, as it seemed: a tall, straight, flat-backed,\r\nsquare-shouldered, deep-chested, full-bosomed young grisette, in a snowy\r\nfrilled cap, a neat black gown and white apron, pretty faded,\r\nwell-darned, brown stockings, and well-worn, soft, gray, square-toed\r\nslippers of list, without heels and originally shapeless; but which her\r\nfeet, uncompromising and inexorable as boot-trees, had ennobled into\r\neverlasting classic shapeliness, and stamped with an unforgettable\r\nindividuality, as does a beautiful hand its well-worn glove--a fact\r\nLittle Billee was not slow to perceive, with a curious conscious thrill\r\nthat was only half \xc3\xa6sthetic.\r\n\r\nThen he looked into her freckled face, and met the kind and tender\r\nmirthfulness of her gaze and the plucky frankness of her fine wide smile\r\nwith a thrill that was not \xc3\xa6sthetic at all (nor the reverse), but all of\r\nthe heart. And in one of his quick flashes of intuitive insight he\r\ndivined far down beneath the shining surface of those eyes (which seemed\r\nfor a moment to reflect only a little image of himself against the sky\r\nbeyond the big north window) a well of sweetness; and floating somewhere\r\nin the midst of it the very heart of compassion, generosity, and warm\r\nsisterly love; and under that--alas! at the bottom of all--a thin slimy\r\nlayer of sorrow and shame. And just as long as it takes for a tear to\r\nrise and gather and choke itself back again, this sudden revelation\r\nshook his nervous little frame with a pang of pity, and the knightly\r\nwish to help. But he had no time to indulge in such soft emotions.\r\nTrilby was met on her entrance by friendly greetings on all sides.\r\n\r\n"Tiens! c\'est la grande Trilby!" exclaimed Jules Guinot through his\r\nfencing-mask. "Comment! t\'es d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 debout apr\xc3\xa8s hier soir? Avons-nous\r\nassez rigol\xc3\xa9 chez Mathieu, hein? Cr\xc3\xa9nom d\'un nom, quelle noce! V\'l\xc3\xa0 une\r\ncr\xc3\xa9maill\xc3\xa8re qui peut se vanter d\'\xc3\xaatre diantrement bien pendue, j\'esp\xc3\xa8re!\r\nEt la petite sant\xc3\xa9, c\'matin?"\r\n\r\n"H\xc3\xa9, h\xc3\xa9! mon vieux," answered Trilby. "\xc3\x87a boulotte, apparemment! Et toi?\r\net Victorine? Comment qu\'a s\'porte \xc3\xa0 c\'t\'heure? Elle avait un fier coup\r\nd\'chasselas! c\'est-y jobard, hein? de s\'fich \'paf comme \xc3\xa7a d\'vant\r\nl\'monde! Tiens, v\'l\xc3\xa0, Gontran! \xc3\xa7a marche-t-y, Gontran, Zouzou d\'mon\r\nc\xc5\x93ur?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAFFY MAKES THE SALAD]\r\n\r\n"Comme sur des roulettes, ma biche!" said Gontran, _alias_ l\'Zouzou--a\r\ncorporal in the Zouaves. "Mais tu t\'es donc mise chiffonni\xc3\xa8re, \xc3\xa0\r\npr\xc3\xa9sent? T\'as fait banqueroute?"\r\n\r\n(For Trilby had a chiffonnier\'s basket strapped on her back, and carried\r\na pick and lantern.)\r\n\r\n"Mais-z-oui, mon bon!" she said. "Dame! pas d\'veine hier soir! t\'as bien\r\nvu! Dans la d\xc3\xaache jusqu\'aux omoplates, mon pauv\' caporal-sous-off! nom\r\nd\'un canon--faut bien vivre, s\'pas?"\r\n\r\nLittle Billee\'s heart sluices had closed during this interchange of\r\ncourtesies. He felt it to be of a very slangy kind, because he couldn\'t\r\nunderstand a word of it, and he hated slang. All he could make out was\r\nthe free use of the "tu" and the "toi," and he knew enough French to\r\nknow that this implied a great familiarity, which he misunderstood.\r\n\r\nSo that Jules Guinot\'s polite inquiries whether Trilby were none the\r\nworse after Mathieu\'s house-warming (which was so jolly), Trilby\'s kind\r\nsolicitude about the health of Victorine, who had very foolishly taken a\r\ndrop too much on that occasion, Trilby\'s mock regrets that her own bad\r\nluck at cards had made it necessary that she should retrieve her fallen\r\nfortunes by rag-picking--all these innocent, playful little amenities\r\n(which I have tried to write down just as they were spoken) were couched\r\nin a language that was as Greek to him--and he felt out of it, jealous\r\nand indignant.\r\n\r\n"Good-afternoon to you, Mr. Taffy," said Trilby, in English. "I\'ve\r\nbrought you these objects of art and virtu to make the peace with you.\r\nThey\'re the real thing, you know. I borrowed \'em from le p\xc3\xa8re Martin,\r\nchiffonnier en gros et en d\xc3\xa9tail, grand officier de la L\xc3\xa9gion d\'Honneur,\r\nmembre de l\'Institut, et cetera, treize bis, Rue du Puits d\'Amour,\r\nrez-de-chauss\xc3\xa9e, au fond de la cour \xc3\xa0 gauche, vis-\xc3\xa0-vis le\r\nmont-de-pi\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9! He\'s one of my intimate friends, and--"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you\'re the intimate friend of a _rag-picker_?"\r\nexclaimed the good Taffy.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! Pourquoi pas? I never brag; besides, there ain\'t any beastly\r\npride about le p\xc3\xa8re Martin," said Trilby, with a wink. "You\'d soon find\r\nthat out if _you_ were an intimate friend of his. This is how it\'s put\r\non. Do you see? If _you_\'ll put it on, I\'ll fasten it for you, and show\r\nyou how to hold the lantern and handle the pick. You may come to it\r\nyourself some day, you know. Il ne faut jurer de rien! P\xc3\xa8re Martin will\r\npose for you in person, if you like. He\'s generally disengaged in the\r\nafternoon. He\'s poor but honest, you know, and very nice and clean;\r\nquite the gentleman. He likes artists, especially English--they pay. His\r\nwife sells bric-\xc3\xa0-brac and old masters: Rembrandts from two francs fifty\r\nupwards. They\'ve got a little grandson--a love of a child. I\'m his\r\ngod-mother. You know French, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Taffy, much abashed. "I\'m very much obliged to you--very\r\nmuch indeed--a--I--a--"\r\n\r\n"Y a pas d\'quoi!" said Trilby, divesting herself of her basket and\r\nputting it, with the pick and lantern, in a corner. "Et maintenant, le\r\ntemps d\'absorber une fine de fin sec [a cigarette] et je m\'la brise [I\'m\r\noff]. On m\'attend \xc3\xa0 l\'Ambassade d\'Autriche. Et puis zut! Allez toujours,\r\nmes enfants. En avant la boxe!"\r\n\r\nShe sat herself down cross-legged on the model-throne, and made herself\r\na cigarette, and watched the fencing and boxing. Little Billee brought\r\nher a chair, which she refused; so he sat down on it himself by her\r\nside, and talked to her, just as he would have talked to any young lady\r\nat home--about the weather, about Verdi\'s new opera (which she had never\r\nheard), the impressiveness of Notre Dame, and Victor Hugo\'s beautiful\r\nromance (which she had never read), the mysterious charm of Leonardo da\r\nVinci\'s Lisa Gioconda\'s smile (which she had never seen)--by all of\r\nwhich she was no doubt rather tickled and a little embarrassed, perhaps\r\nalso a little touched.\r\n\r\nTaffy brought her a cup of coffee, and conversed with her in polite\r\nformal French, very well and carefully pronounced; and the Laird tried\r\nto do likewise. _His_ French was of that honest English kind that breaks\r\nup the stiffness of even an English party; and his jolly manners were\r\nsuch as to put an end to all shyness and constraint, and make\r\nself-consciousness impossible.\r\n\r\nOthers dropped in from neighboring studios--the usual cosmopolite crew.\r\nIt was a perpetual come and go in this particular studio between four\r\nand six in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThere were ladies, too, _en cheveux_, in caps and bonnets, some of whom\r\nknew Trilby, and thee\'d and thou\'d with familiar and friendly affection,\r\nwhile others mademoiselle\'d her with distant politeness, and were\r\nmademoiselle\'d and madame\'d back again. "Absolument comme \xc3\xa0 l\'Ambassade\r\nd\'Autriche," as Trilby observed to the Laird, with a British wink that\r\nwas by no means ambassadorial.\r\n\r\nThen Svengali came and made some of his grandest music, which was as\r\ncompletely thrown away on Trilby as fireworks on a blind beggar, for all\r\nshe held her tongue so piously.\r\n\r\nFencing and boxing and trapezing seemed to be more in her line; and\r\nindeed, to a tone-deaf person, Taffy lunging his full spread with a\r\nfoil, in all the splendor of his long, lithe, youthful strength, was a\r\nfar gainlier sight than Svengali at the key-board flashing his languid\r\nbold eyes with a sickly smile from one listener to another, as if to\r\nsay: "N\'est-ce pas que che suis peau! N\'est-ce pas que ch\'ai tu ch\xc3\xa9nie?\r\nN\'est-ce pas que che suis suplime, enfin?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE GLORY THAT WAS GREECE"]\r\n\r\nThen enter Durien the sculptor, who had been presented with a baignoire\r\nat the Porte St. Martin to see "La Dame aux Cam\xc3\xa9lias," and he invited\r\nTrilby and another lady to dine with him "au cabaret" and share his box.\r\n\r\nSo Trilby didn\'t go to the Austrian embassy after all, as the Laird\r\nobserved to Little Billee, with such a good imitation of her wink that\r\nLittle Billee was bound to laugh.\r\n\r\nBut Little Billee was not inclined for fun; a dulness, a sense of\r\ndisenchantment, had come over him; as he expressed it to himself, with\r\npathetic self-pity:\r\n\r\n    "A feeling of sadness and longing\r\n       That is not akin to pain,\r\n     And resembles sorrow only\r\n       As the mist resembles the rain."\r\n\r\nAnd the sadness, if he had known, was that all beautiful young women\r\nwith kind sweet faces and noble figures and goddess-like extremities\r\nshould not be good and pure as they were beautiful; and the longing was\r\na longing that Trilby could be turned into a young lady--say the vicar\'s\r\ndaughter in a little Devonshire village--his sister\'s friend and\r\nco-teacher at the Sunday-school; a simple, pure, and pious maiden of\r\ngentle birth.\r\n\r\nFor he adored piety in woman, although he was not pious by any means.\r\nHis inarticulate, intuitive perceptions were not of form and color\r\nsecrets only, but strove to pierce the veil of deeper mysteries in\r\nimpetuous and dogmatic boyish scorn of all received interpretations. For\r\nhe flattered himself that he possessed the philosophical and scientific\r\nmind, and piqued himself on thinking clearly, and was intolerant of\r\nhuman inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThat small reserve portion of his ever-active brain which should have\r\nlain fallow while the rest of it was at work or play, perpetually\r\nplagued itself about the mysteries of life and death, and was forever\r\npropounding unanswerable arguments against the Christian belief, through\r\na kind of inverted sympathy with the believer. Fortunately for his\r\nfriends, Little Billee was both shy and discreet, and very tender of\r\nother people\'s feelings; so he kept all his immature juvenile\r\nagnosticism to himself.\r\n\r\nTo atone for such ungainly strong-mindedness in one so young and tender,\r\nhe was the slave of many little traditional observances which have no\r\nvery solid foundation in either science or philosophy. For instance, he\r\nwouldn\'t walk under a ladder for worlds, nor sit down thirteen to\r\ndinner, nor have his hair cut on a Friday, and was quite upset if he\r\nhappened to see the new moon through glass. And he believed in lucky and\r\nunlucky numbers, and dearly loved the sights and scents and sounds of\r\nhigh-mass in some dim old French cathedral, and found them secretly\r\ncomforting.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that he sometimes laughed at himself, if only in his sleeve!\r\n\r\nAnd with all his keenness of insight into life he had a well-brought-up,\r\nmiddle-class young Englishman\'s belief in the infallible efficacy of\r\ngentle birth--for gentle he considered his own and Taffy\'s and the\r\nLaird\'s, and that of most of the good people he had lived among in\r\nEngland--all people, in short, whose two parents and four grandparents\r\nhad received a liberal education and belonged to the professional class.\r\nAnd with this belief he combined (or thought he did) a proper democratic\r\nscorn for bloated dukes and lords, and even poor inoffensive baronets,\r\nand all the landed gentry--everybody who was born an inch higher up than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt is a fairly good middle-class social creed, if you can only stick to\r\nit through life in despite of life\'s experience. It fosters independence\r\nand self-respect, and not a few stodgy practical virtues as well. At all\r\nevents, it keeps you out of bad company, which is to be found both above\r\nand below.\r\n\r\nAnd all this melancholy preoccupation, on Little Billee\'s part, from the\r\nmomentary gleam and dazzle of a pair of over-perfect feet in an\r\nover-\xc3\xa6sthetic eye, too much enamoured of mere form!\r\n\r\nReversing the usual process, he had idealized from the base upward!\r\n\r\nMany of us, older and wiser than Little Billee, have seen in lovely\r\nfemale shapes the outer garment of a lovely female soul. The instinct\r\nwhich guides us to do this is, perhaps, a right one, more often than\r\nnot. But more often than not, also, lovely female shapes are terrible\r\ncomplicators of the difficulties and dangers of this earthly life,\r\nespecially for their owner, and more especially if she be a humble\r\ndaughter of the people, poor and ignorant, of a yielding nature, too\r\nquick to love and trust. This is all so true as to be trite--so trite as\r\nto be a common platitude!\r\n\r\nA modern teller of tales, most widely (and most justly) popular, tells\r\nus of heroes and heroines who, like Lord Byron\'s corsair, were linked\r\nwith one virtue and a thousand crimes. And so dexterously does he weave\r\nhis story that the young person may read it and learn nothing but good.\r\n\r\nMy poor heroine was the converse of these engaging criminals: she had\r\nall the virtues but one; but the virtue she lacked (the very one of all\r\nthat plays the title-role, and gives its generic name to all the rest of\r\nthat goodly company) was of such a kind that I have found it impossible\r\nso to tell her history as to make it quite fit and proper reading for\r\nthe ubiquitous young person so dear to us all.\r\n\r\nMost deeply to my regret. For I had fondly hoped it might one day be\r\nsaid of me that whatever my other literary shortcomings might be, I at\r\nleast had never penned a line which a pure-minded young British mother\r\nmight not read aloud to her little blue-eyed babe as it lies sucking its\r\nlittle bottle in its little bassinet.\r\n\r\nFate has willed it otherwise.\r\n\r\nWould indeed that I could duly express poor Trilby\'s one shortcoming in\r\nsome not too familiar medium--in Latin or Greek, let us say--lest the\r\nyoung person (in this ubiquitousness of hers, for which Heaven be\r\npraised) should happen to pry into these pages when her mother is\r\nlooking another way.\r\n\r\nLatin and Greek are languages the young person should not be taught to\r\nunderstand--seeing that they are highly improper languages, deservedly\r\ndead--in which pagan bards who should have known better have sung the\r\nfilthy loves of their gods and goddesses.\r\n\r\nBut at least am I scholar enough to enter one little Latin plea on\r\nTrilby\'s behalf--the shortest, best, and most beautiful plea I can think\r\nof. It was once used in extenuation and condonation of the frailties of\r\nanother poor weak woman, presumably beautiful, and a far worse offender\r\nthan Trilby, but who, like Trilby, repented of her ways, and was most\r\njustly forgiven--\r\n\r\n    "Quia multum amavit!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRILBY\'S FOREBEARS]\r\n\r\nWhether it be an aggravation of her misdeeds or an extenuating\r\ncircumstance, no pressure of want, no temptations of greed or vanity,\r\nhad ever been factors in urging Trilby on her downward career after her\r\nfirst false step in that direction--the result of ignorance, bad advice\r\n(from her mother, of all people in the world), and base betrayal. She\r\nmight have lived in guilty splendor had she chosen, but her wants were\r\nfew. She had no vanity, and her tastes were of the simplest, and she\r\nearned enough to gratify them all, and to spare.\r\n\r\nSo she followed love for love\'s sake only, now and then, as she would\r\nhave followed art if she had been a man--capriciously, desultorily, more\r\nin a frolicsome spirit of camaraderie than anything else. Like an\r\namateur, in short--a distinguished amateur who is too proud to sell his\r\npictures, but willingly gives one away now and then to some highly\r\nvalued and much admiring friend.\r\n\r\nSheer gayety of heart and genial good-fellowship, the difficulty of\r\nsaying nay to earnest pleading. She was "bonne camarade et bonne fille"\r\nbefore everything. Though her heart was not large enough to harbor more\r\nthan one light love at a time (even in that Latin quarter of genially\r\ncapacious hearts), it had room for many warm friendships; and she was\r\nthe warmest, most helpful, and most compassionate of friends, far more\r\nserious and faithful in friendship than in love.\r\n\r\nIndeed, she might almost be said to possess a virginal heart, so little\r\ndid she know of love\'s heartaches and raptures and torments and\r\nclingings and jealousies.\r\n\r\nWith her it was lightly come and lightly go, and never come back again;\r\nas one or two, or perhaps three, picturesque bohemians of the brush or\r\nchisel had found, at some cost to their vanity and self-esteem; perhaps\r\neven to a deeper feeling--who knows?\r\n\r\nTrilby\'s father, as she had said, had been a gentleman, the son of a\r\nfamous Dublin physician and friend of George the Fourth\'s. He had been a\r\nfellow of his college, and had entered holy orders. He also had all the\r\nvirtues but one; he was a drunkard, and began to drink quite early in\r\nlife. He soon left the Church, and became a classical tutor, and failed\r\nthrough this besetting sin of his, and fell into disgrace.\r\n\r\nThen he went to Paris, and picked up a few English pupils there, and\r\nlost them, and earned a precarious livelihood from hand to mouth,\r\nanyhow; and sank from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nAnd when his worst was about reached, he married the famous tartaned and\r\ntamoshantered bar-maid at the Montagnards \xc3\x89cossais, in the Rue du\r\nParadis Poissonni\xc3\xa8re (a very fishy paradise indeed); she was a most\r\nbeautiful Highland lassie of low degree, and she managed to support him,\r\nor helped him to support himself, for ten or fifteen years. Trilby was\r\nborn to them, and was dragged up in some way--_\xc3\xa0 la gr\xc3\xa2ce de Dieu!_\r\n\r\nPatrick O\'Ferrall soon taught his wife to drown all care and\r\nresponsibility in his own simple way, and opportunities for doing so\r\nwere never lacking to her.\r\n\r\nThen he died, and left a posthumous child--born ten months after his\r\ndeath, alas! and whose birth cost its mother her life.\r\n\r\nThen Trilby became a _blanchisseuse de fin_, and in two or three years\r\ncame to grief through her trust in a friend of her mother\'s. Then she\r\nbecame a model besides, and was able to support her little brother, whom\r\nshe dearly loved.\r\n\r\nAt the time this story begins, this small waif and stray was "en\r\npension" with le p\xc3\xa8re Martin, the rag-picker, and his wife, the dealer\r\nin bric-\xc3\xa0-brac and inexpensive old masters. They were very good people,\r\nand had grown fond of the child, who was beautiful to look at, and full\r\nof pretty tricks and pluck and cleverness--a popular favorite in the Rue\r\ndu Puits d\'Amour and its humble neighborhood.\r\n\r\nTrilby, for some freak, always chose to speak of him as her godson, and\r\nas the grandchild of le p\xc3\xa8re et la m\xc3\xa8re Martin, so that these good\r\npeople had almost grown to believe he really belonged to them.\r\n\r\nAnd almost every one else believed that he was the child of Trilby (in\r\nspite of her youth), and she was so fond of him that she didn\'t mind in\r\nthe least.\r\n\r\nHe might have had a worse home.\r\n\r\nLa m\xc3\xa8re Martin was pious, or pretended to be; le p\xc3\xa8re Martin was the\r\nreverse. But they were equally good for their kind, and, though coarse\r\nand ignorant and unscrupulous in many ways (as was natural enough), they\r\nwere gifted in a very full measure with the saving graces of love and\r\ncharity, especially he. And if people are to be judged by their works,\r\nthis worthy pair are no doubt both equally well compensated by now for\r\nthe trials and struggles of their sordid earthly life.\r\n\r\nSo much for Trilby\'s parentage.\r\n\r\nAnd as she sat and wept at Madame Doche\'s impersonation of la Dame aux\r\nCam\xc3\xa9lias (with her hand in Durien\'s) she vaguely remembered, as in a\r\nwaking dream, now the noble presence of Taffy as he towered cool and\r\nerect, foil in hand, gallantly waiting for his adversary to breathe,\r\nnow the beautiful sensitive face of Little Billee and his deferential\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\nAnd during the _entr\'actes_ her heart went out in friendship to the\r\njolly Scotch Laird of Cockpen, who came out now and then with such\r\nterrible French oaths and abominable expletives (and in the presence of\r\nladies, too!), without the slightest notion of what they meant.\r\n\r\nFor the Laird had a quick ear, and a craving to be colloquial and\r\nidiomatic before everything else, and made many awkward and embarrassing\r\nmistakes.\r\n\r\nIt would be with him as though a polite Frenchman should say to a fair\r\ndaughter of Albion, "D---- my eyes, mees, your tea is getting ---- cold;\r\nlet me tell that good old ---- of a Jules to bring you another cup."\r\n\r\nAnd so forth, till time and experience taught him better. It is perhaps\r\nwell for him that his first experiments in conversational French were\r\nmade in the unconventional circle of the Place St. Anatole des Arts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Second\r\n\r\n    "Dieu! qu\'il fait bon la regarder,\r\n       La gracieuse, bonne et belle!\r\n       Pour les grands biens qui sont en elle\r\n     Chacun est pr\xc3\xaat de la louer."\r\n\r\n\r\nNobody knew exactly how Svengali lived, and very few knew where (or\r\nwhy). He occupied a roomy dilapidated garret, au sixi\xc3\xa8me, in the Rue\r\nTire-Liard; with a truckle-bed and a piano-forte for furniture, and very\r\nlittle else.\r\n\r\nHe was poor; for in spite of his talent he had not yet made his mark in\r\nParis. His manners may have been accountable for this. He would either\r\nfawn or bully, and could be grossly impertinent. He had a kind of\r\ncynical humor, which was more offensive than amusing, and always laughed\r\nat the wrong thing, at the wrong time, in the wrong place. And his\r\nlaughter was always derisive and full of malice. And his egotism and\r\nconceit were not to be borne; and then he was both tawdry and dirty in\r\nhis person; more greasily, mattedly unkempt than even a really\r\nsuccessful pianist has any right to be, even in the best society.\r\n\r\nHe was not a nice man, and there was no pathos in his poverty--a poverty\r\nthat was not honorable, and need not have existed at all; for he was\r\nconstantly receiving supplies from his own people in Austria--his old\r\nfather and mother, his sisters, his cousins, and his aunts,\r\nhard-working, frugal folk of whom he was the pride and the darling.\r\n\r\nHe had but one virtue--his love of his art; or, rather, his love of\r\nhimself as a master of his art--_the_ master; for he despised, or\r\naffected to despise, all other musicians, living or dead--even those\r\nwhose work he interpreted so divinely, and pitied them for not hearing\r\nSvengali give utterance to their music, which of course they could not\r\nutter themselves.\r\n\r\n"Ils safent tous un peu toucher du bi\xc3\xa2no, mais pas grand\'chose!"\r\n\r\nHe had been the best pianist of his time at the Conservatory in Leipsic;\r\nand, indeed, there was perhaps some excuse for this overweening conceit,\r\nsince he was able to lend a quite peculiar individual charm of his own\r\nto any music he played, except the highest and best of all, in which he\r\nconspicuously failed.\r\n\r\nHe had to draw the line just above Chopin, where he reached his highest\r\nlevel. It will not do to lend your own quite peculiar individual charm\r\nto Handel and Bach and Beethoven; and Chopin is not bad as a\r\n_pis-aller_.\r\n\r\nHe had ardently wished to sing, and had studied hard to that end in\r\nGermany, in Italy, in France, with the forlorn hope of evolving from\r\nsome inner recess a voice to sing with. But nature had been singularly\r\nharsh to him in this one respect--inexorable. He was absolutely without\r\nvoice, beyond the harsh, hoarse, weak raven\'s croak he used to speak\r\nwith, and no method availed to make one for him. But he grew to\r\nunderstand the human voice as perhaps no one has understood it--before\r\nor since.\r\n\r\nSo in his head he went forever singing, singing, singing, as probably no\r\nhuman nightingale has ever yet been able to sing out loud for the glory\r\nand delight of his fellow-mortals; making unheard heavenly melody of the\r\ncheapest, trivialest tunes--tunes of the caf\xc3\xa9 concert, tunes of the\r\nnursery, the shop-parlor, the guard-room, the school-room, the pothouse,\r\nthe slum. There was nothing so humble, so base even, but that his magic\r\ncould transform it into the rarest beauty without altering a note. This\r\nseems impossible, I know. But if it didn\'t, where would the magic come\r\nin?\r\n\r\nWhatever of heart or conscience--pity, love, tenderness, manliness,\r\ncourage, reverence, charity--endowed him at his birth had been swallowed\r\nup by this one faculty, and nothing of them was left for the common uses\r\nof life. He poured them all into his little flexible flageolet.\r\n\r\nSvengali playing Chopin on the piano-forte, even (or especially)\r\nSvengali playing "Ben Bolt" on that penny whistle of his, was as one of\r\nthe heavenly host.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "AS BAD AS THEY MAKE \'EM"]\r\n\r\nSvengali walking up and down the earth seeking whom he might cheat,\r\nbetray, exploit, borrow money from, make brutal fun of, bully if he\r\ndared, cringe to if he must--man, woman, child, or dog--was about as bad\r\nas they make \'em.\r\n\r\nTo earn a few pence when he couldn\'t borrow them he played\r\naccompaniments at caf\xc3\xa9 concerts, and even then he gave offence; for in\r\nhis contempt for the singer he would play too loud, and embroider his\r\naccompaniments with brilliant improvisations of his own, and lift his\r\nhands on high and bring them down with a bang in the sentimental parts,\r\nand shake his dirty mane and shrug his shoulders, and smile and leer at\r\nthe audience, and do all he could to attract their attention to himself.\r\nHe also gave a few music lessons (not at ladies\' schools, let us hope),\r\nfor which he was not well paid, presumably, since he was always without\r\nthe sou, always borrowing money, that he never paid back, and exhausting\r\nthe pockets and the patience of one acquaintance after another.\r\n\r\nHe had but two friends. There was Gecko, who lived in a little garret\r\nclose by in the Impasse des Ramoneurs, and who was second violin in the\r\norchestra of the Gymnase, and shared his humble earnings with his\r\nmaster, to whom, indeed, he owed his great talent, not yet revealed to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nSvengali\'s other friend and pupil was (or rather had been) the\r\nmysterious Honorine, of whose conquest he was much given to boast,\r\nhinting that she was "une jeune femme du monde." This was not the case.\r\nMademoiselle Honorine Cahen (better known in the quartier latin as Mimi\r\nla Salope) was a dirty, drabby little dolly-mop of a Jewess, a model for\r\nthe figure--a very humble person indeed, socially.\r\n\r\nShe was, however, of a very lively disposition, and had a charming\r\nvoice, and a natural gift of singing so sweetly that you forgot her\r\naccent, which was that of the "tout ce qu\'il y a de plus canaille."\r\n\r\nShe used to sit at Carrel\'s, and during the pose she would sing. When\r\nLittle Billee first heard her he was so fascinated that "it made him\r\nsick to think she sat for the figure"--an effect, by-the-way, that was\r\nalways produced upon him by all specially attractive figure models of\r\nthe gentler sex, for he had a reverence for woman. And before everything\r\nelse, he had for the singing woman an absolute worship. He was\r\nespecially thrall to the contralto--the deep low voice that breaks and\r\nchanges in the middle and soars all at once into a magnified angelic boy\r\ntreble. It pierced through his ears to his heart, and stirred his very\r\nvitals.\r\n\r\nHe had once heard Madame Alboni, and it had been an epoch in his life;\r\nhe would have been an easy prey to the sirens! Even beauty paled before\r\nthe lovely female voice singing in the middle of the note--the\r\nnightingale killed the bird-of-paradise.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that poor Mimi la Salope had not the voice of Madame\r\nAlboni, nor the art; but it was a beautiful voice of its little kind,\r\nalways in the very middle of the note, and her artless art had its quick\r\nseduction.\r\n\r\nShe sang little songs of B\xc3\xa9ranger\'s--"Grand\'m\xc3\xa8re, parlez-nous de lui!"\r\nor "T\'en souviens-tu? disait un capitaine--" or "Enfants, c\'est moi qui\r\nsuis Lisette!" and such like pretty things, that almost brought the\r\ntears to Little Billee\'s easily moistened eyes.\r\n\r\nBut soon she would sing little songs that were not by B\xc3\xa9ranger--little\r\nsongs with slang words Little Billee hadn\'t French enough to understand;\r\nbut from the kind of laughter with which the points were received by\r\nthe "rapins" in Carrel\'s studio he guessed these little songs were vile,\r\nthough the touching little voice was as that of the seraphim still; and\r\nhe knew the pang of disenchantment and vicarious shame.\r\n\r\nSvengali had heard her sing at the Brasserie des Porcherons in the Rue\r\ndu Crapaud-volant, and had volunteered to teach her; and she went to see\r\nhim in his garret, and he played to her, and leered and ogled, and\r\nflashed his bold, black, beady Jew\'s eyes into hers, and she straightway\r\nmentally prostrated herself in reverence and adoration before this\r\ndazzling specimen of her race.\r\n\r\nSo that her sordid, mercenary little gutter-draggled soul was filled\r\nwith the sight and the sound of him, as of a lordly, godlike,\r\nshawm-playing, cymbal-banging hero and prophet of the Lord God of\r\nIsrael--David and Saul in one!\r\n\r\nAnd then he set himself to teach her--kindly and patiently at first,\r\ncalling her sweet little pet names--his "Rose of Sharon," his "pearl of\r\nPabylon," his "cazelle-eyed liddle Cherusalem skylark"--and promised her\r\nthat she should be the queen of the nightingales.\r\n\r\nBut before he could teach her anything he had to unteach her all she\r\nknew; her breathing, the production of her voice, its emission--everything\r\nwas wrong. She worked indefatigably to please him, and soon succeeded in\r\nforgetting all the pretty little sympathetic tricks of voice and\r\nphrasing Mother Nature had taught her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "A VOICE HE DIDN\'T UNDERSTAND"]\r\n\r\nBut though she had an exquisite ear, she had no real musical\r\nintelligence--no intelligence of any kind except about sous and\r\ncentimes; she was as stupid as a little downy owl, and her voice was\r\njust a light native warble, a throstle\'s pipe, all in the head and nose\r\nand throat (a voice he _didn\'t_ understand, for once), a thing of mere\r\nyouth and health and bloom and high spirits--like her beauty, such as it\r\nwas--_beaut\xc3\xa9 du diable, beaut\xc3\xa9 damn\xc3\xa9e_.\r\n\r\nShe did her very best, and practised all she could in this new way, and\r\nsang herself hoarse: she scarcely ate or slept for practising. He grew\r\nharsh and impatient and coldly severe, and of coarse she loved him all\r\nthe more; and the more she loved him the more nervous she got and the\r\nworse she sang. Her voice cracked; her ear became demoralized; her\r\nattempts to vocalize grew almost as comical as Trilby\'s. So that he lost\r\nhis temper completely, and called her terrible names, and pinched and\r\npunched her with his big bony hands till she wept worse than Niobe, and\r\nborrowed money of her--five-franc pieces, even francs and\r\ndemifrancs--which he never paid her back; and browbeat and bullied and\r\nballyragged her till she went quite mad for love of him, and would have\r\njumped out of his sixth-floor window to give him a moment\'s pleasure!\r\n\r\nHe did not ask her to do this--it never occurred to him, and would have\r\ngiven him no pleasure to speak of. But one fine Sabbath morning (a\r\nSaturday, of course) he took her by the shoulders and chucked her, neck\r\nand crop, out of his garret, with the threat that if she ever dared to\r\nshow her face there again he would denounce her to the police--an awful\r\nthreat to the likes of poor Mimi la Salope!\r\n\r\n"For where did all those five-franc pieces come from--_hein?_--with\r\nwhich she had tried to pay for all the singing-lessons that had been\r\nthrown away upon her? Not from merely sitting to painters--_hein?_"\r\n\r\nThus the little gazelle-eyed Jerusalem skylark went back to her native\r\nstreets again--a mere mud-lark of the Paris slums--her wings clipped,\r\nher spirit quenched and broken, and with no more singing left in her\r\nthan a common or garden sparrow--not so much!\r\n\r\nAnd so, no more of "la betite Honorine!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe morning after this adventure Svengali woke up in his garret with a\r\ntremendous longing to spend a happy day; for it was a Sunday, and a very\r\nfine one.\r\n\r\nHe made a long arm and reached his waistcoat and trousers off the floor,\r\nand emptied the contents of their pockets on to his tattered blanket; no\r\nsilver, no gold, only a few sous and two-sou pieces, just enough to pay\r\nfor a meagre _premier d\xc3\xa9jeuner_!\r\n\r\nHe had cleared out Gecko the day before, and spent the proceeds (ten\r\nfrancs, at least) in one night\'s riotous living--pleasures in which\r\nGecko had had no share; and he could think of no one to borrow money\r\nfrom but Little Billee, Taffy, and the Laird, whom he had neglected and\r\nleft untapped for days.\r\n\r\nSo he slipped into his clothes, and looked at himself in what remained\r\nof a little zinc mirror, and found that his forehead left little to be\r\ndesired, but that his eyes and temples were decidedly grimy. Wherefore,\r\nhe poured a little water out of a little jug into a little basin, and,\r\ntwisting the corner of his pocket-handkerchief round his dirty\r\nforefinger, he delicately dipped it, and removed the offending stains.\r\nHis fingers, he thought, would do very well for another day or two as\r\nthey were; he ran them through his matted black mane, pushed it behind\r\nhis ears, and gave it the twist he liked (and that was so much disliked\r\nby his English friends). Then he put on his b\xc3\xa9ret and his velveteen\r\ncloak, and went forth into the sunny streets, with a sense of the\r\nfragrance and freedom and pleasantness of Sunday morning in Paris in the\r\nmonth of May.\r\n\r\nHe found Little Billee sitting in a zinc hip-bath, busy with soap and\r\nsponge; and was so tickled and interested by the sight that he quite\r\nforgot for the moment what he had come for.\r\n\r\n"Himmel! Why the devil are you doing that?" he asked, in his\r\nGerman-Hebrew-French.\r\n\r\n"Doing _what_?" asked Little Billee, in his French of\r\nStratford-atte-Bowe.\r\n\r\n"Sitting in water and playing with a cake of soap and a sponge!"\r\n\r\n"Why, to try and get myself _clean_, I suppose!"\r\n\r\n"Ach! And how the devil did you get yourself _dirty_, then?"\r\n\r\nTo this Little Billee found no immediate answer, and went on with his\r\nablution after the hissing, splashing, energetic fashion of Englishmen;\r\nand Svengali laughed loud and long at the spectacle of a little\r\nEnglishman trying to get himself clean--"t\xc3\xa2chant de se nettoyer!"\r\n\r\nWhen such cleanliness had been attained as was possible under the\r\ncircumstances, Svengali begged for the loan of two hundred francs, and\r\nLittle Billee gave him a five-franc piece.\r\n\r\nContent with this, _faute de mieux_, the German asked him when he would\r\nbe trying to get himself clean again, as he would much like to come and\r\nsee him do it.\r\n\r\n"Demang mattang, \xc3\xa0 votre sairveece!" said Little Billee, with a\r\ncourteous bow.\r\n\r\n"_What!! Monday too!!_ Gott in Himmel! you try to get yourself clean\r\n_every day_?"\r\n\r\nAnd he laughed himself out of the room, out of the house, out of the\r\nPlace de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on--all the way to the Rue de Seine, where dwelt the "Man\r\nof Blood," whom he meant to propitiate with the story of that original,\r\nLittle Billee, trying to get himself clean--that he might borrow another\r\nfive-franc piece, or perhaps two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "AND SO, NO MORE."]\r\n\r\nAs the reader will no doubt anticipate, he found Taffy in his bath too,\r\nand fell to laughing with such convulsive laughter, such twistings,\r\nscrewings, and doublings of himself up, such pointings of his dirty\r\nforefinger at the huge naked Briton, that Taffy was offended, and all\r\nbut lost his temper.\r\n\r\n"What the devil are you cackling at, sacred head of pig that you are?\r\nDo you want to be pitched out of that window into the Rue de Seine? You\r\nfilthy black Hebrew sweep! Just you wait a bit; _I\'ll_ wash your head\r\nfor you!"\r\n\r\nAnd Taffy jumped out of his bath, such a towering figure of righteous\r\nHerculean wrath that Svengali was appalled, and fled.\r\n\r\n"Donnerwetter!" he exclaimed, as he tumbled down the narrow staircase of\r\nthe H\xc3\xb4tel de Seine; "what for a thick head! what for a pig-dog! what for\r\na rotten, brutal, verfluchter kerl of an Englander!"\r\n\r\nThen he paused for thought.\r\n\r\n"Now will I go to that Scottish Englander, in the Place St. Anatole des\r\nArts, for that other five-franc piece. But first will I wait a little\r\nwhile till he has perhaps finished trying to get himself clean."\r\n\r\nSo he breakfasted at the cr\xc3\xa8merie Souchet, in the Rue Clopin-Clopant,\r\nand, feeling quite safe again, he laughed and laughed till his very\r\nsides were sore.\r\n\r\nTwo Englanders in one day--as naked as your hand!--a big one and a\r\nlittle one, trying to get themselves clean!\r\n\r\nHe rather flattered himself he\'d scored off those two Englanders.\r\n\r\nAfter all, he was right perhaps, from his point of view: you can get as\r\ndirty in a week as in a lifetime, so what\'s the use of taking such a lot\r\nof trouble? Besides, so long as you are clean enough to suit your kind,\r\nto be any cleaner would be priggish and pedantic, and get you disliked.\r\n\r\nJust as Svengali was about to knock at the Laird\'s door, Trilby came\r\ndown-stairs from Durien\'s, very unlike herself. Her eyes were red with\r\nweeping, and there were great black rings round them; she was pale under\r\nher freckles.\r\n\r\n"Fous afez du chacrin, matemoiselle?" asked he.\r\n\r\nShe told him that she had neuralgia in her eyes, a thing she was subject\r\nto; that the pain was maddening, and generally lasted twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I can cure you; come in here with me."\r\n\r\nThe Laird\'s ablutions (if he had indulged in any that morning) were\r\nevidently over for the day. He was breakfasting on a roll and butter,\r\nand coffee of his own brewing. He was deeply distressed at the sight of\r\npoor Trilby\'s sufferings, and offered whiskey and coffee and gingernuts,\r\nwhich she would not touch.\r\n\r\nSvengali told her to sit down on the divan, and sat opposite to her, and\r\nbade her look him well in the white of the eyes.\r\n\r\n"Recartez-moi pien tans le planc tes yeux."\r\n\r\nThen he made little passes and counterpasses on her forehead and temples\r\nand down her cheek and neck. Soon her eyes closed and her face grew\r\nplacid. After a while, a quarter of an hour perhaps, he asked her if she\r\nsuffered still.\r\n\r\n"Oh! presque plus du tout, monsieur--c\'est le ciel."\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more he asked the Laird if he knew German.\r\n\r\n"Just enough to understand," said the Laird (who had spent a year in\r\nD\xc3\xbcsseldorf), and Svengali said to him in German: "See, she sleeps not,\r\nbut she shall not open her eyes. Ask her."\r\n\r\n"Are you asleep, Miss Trilby?" asked the Laird.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then open your eyes and look at me."\r\n\r\nShe strained her eyes, but could not, and said so.\r\n\r\nThen Svengali said, again in German, "She shall not open her mouth. Ask\r\nher."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'TWO ENGLANDERS IN ONE DAY\'"]\r\n\r\n"Why couldn\'t you open your eyes. Miss Trilby?" She strained to open her\r\nmouth and speak, but in vain. "She shall not rise from the divan. Ask\r\nher." But Trilby was spellbound, and could not move.\r\n\r\n"I will now set her free," said Svengali.\r\n\r\nAnd, lo! she got up and waved her arms, and cried, "Vive la Prusse! me\r\nv\'l\xc3\xa0 gu\xc3\xa9rie!" and in her gratitude she kissed Svengali\'s hand; and he\r\nleered, and showed his big brown teeth and the yellow whites at the top\r\nof his big black eyes, and drew his breath with a hiss.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'ll go to Durien\'s and sit. How can I thank you, monsieur? You\r\nhave taken all my pain away."\r\n\r\n"Yes, matemoiselle. I have got it myself; it is in my elbows. But I love\r\nit, because it comes from you. Every time you have pain you shall come\r\nto me, 12 Rue Tire-Liard, au sixi\xc3\xa8me au-dessus de l\'entresol, and I will\r\ncure you and take your pain myself--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are too good!" and in her high spirits she turned round on her\r\nheel and uttered her portentous war-cry, "Milk below!" The very rafters\r\nrang with it, and the piano gave out a solemn response.\r\n\r\n"What is that you say, matemoiselle?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s what the milkmen say in England."\r\n\r\n"It is a wonderful cry, matemoiselle--wundersch\xc3\xb6n! It comes straight\r\nthrough the heart; it has its roots in the stomach, and blossoms into\r\nmusic on the lips like the voice of Madame Alboni--voce sulle labbre! It\r\nis good production--c\'est un cri du c\xc5\x93ur!"\r\n\r\nTrilby blushed with pride and pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Yes, matemoiselle! I only know one person in the whole world who can\r\nproduce the voice so well as you! I give you my word of honor."\r\n\r\n"Who is it, monsieur--yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Ach, no, matemoiselle; I have not that privilege. I have unfortunately\r\nno voice to produce.... It is a waiter at the Caf\xc3\xa9 de la Rotonde, in the\r\nPalais Royal; when you call for coffee, he says \'Boum!\' in basso\r\nprofondo. Tiefstimme--F. moll below the line--it is phenomenal! It is\r\nlike a cannon--a cannon also has very good production, matemoiselle.\r\nThey pay him for it a thousand francs a year, because he brings many\r\ncustomers to the Caf\xc3\xa9 de la Rotonde, where the coffee isn\'t very good.\r\nWhen he dies they will search all France for another, and then all\r\nGermany, where the good big waiters come from--and the cannons--but they\r\nwill not find him, and the Caf\xc3\xa9 de la Rotonde will be bankrupt--unless\r\nyou will consent to take his place. Will you permit that I shall look\r\ninto your mouth, matemoiselle?"\r\n\r\nShe opened her mouth wide, and he looked into it.\r\n\r\n"Himmel! the roof of your mouth is like the dome of the Panth\xc3\xa9on; there\r\nis room in it for \'toutes les gloires de la France,\' and a little to\r\nspare! The entrance to your throat is like the middle porch of St.\r\nSulpice when the doors are open for the faithful on All-Saints\' day; and\r\nnot one tooth is missing--thirty-two British teeth as white as milk and\r\nas big as knuckle-bones! and your little tongue is scooped out like the\r\nleaf of a pink peony, and the bridge of your nose is like the belly of a\r\nStradivarius--what a sounding-board! and inside your beautiful big chest\r\nthe lungs are made of leather! and your breath, it embalms--like the\r\nbreath of a beautiful white heifer fed on the buttercups, and daisies of\r\nthe Vaterland! and you have a quick, soft, susceptible heart, a heart of\r\ngold, matemoiselle--all that sees itself in your face!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'HIMMEL! THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH\'"]\r\n\r\n    "\'Votre c\xc5\x93ur est un luth suspendu!\r\n      Aussit\xc3\xb4t qu\'on le touche, il r\xc3\xa9sonne....\'\r\n\r\nWhat a pity you have not also the musical organization!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I _have_, monsieur; you heard me sing \'Ben Bolt,\' didn\'t you?\r\nWhat makes you say that?"\r\n\r\nSvengali was confused for a moment. Then he said: "When I play the\r\n\'Rosemonde\' of Schubert, matemoiselle, you look another way and smoke a\r\ncigarette.... You look at the big Taffy, at the Little Billee, at the\r\npictures on the walls, or out of window, at the sky, the chimney-pots of\r\nNotre Dame de Paris; you do not look at Svengali!--Svengali, who looks\r\nat you with all his eyes, and plays you the \'Rosemonde\' of Schubert!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma\xc3\xafe, a\xc3\xafe!" exclaimed Trilby; "you _do_ use lovely language!"\r\n\r\n"But never mind, matemoiselle; when your pain arrives, then shall you\r\ncome once more to Svengali, and he shall take it away from you, and keep\r\nit himself for a soufenir of you when you are gone. And when you have it\r\nno more, he shall play you the \'Rosemonde\' of Schubert, all alone for\r\nyou; and then, \'Messieurs les \xc3\xa9tutiants, montez \xc3\xa0 la chaumi\xc3\xa8re!\' ...\r\nbecause it is gayer! _And you shall see nothing, hear nothing, think of\r\nnothing but Svengali, Svengali, Svengali!_"\r\n\r\nHere he felt his peroration to be so happy and effective that he thought\r\nit well to go at once and make a good exit. So he bent over Trilby\'s\r\nshapely freckled hand and kissed it, and bowed himself out of the room,\r\nwithout even borrowing his five-franc piece.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a rum \'un, ain\'t he?" said Trilby. "He reminds me of a big hungry\r\nspider, and makes me feel like a fly! But he\'s cured my pain! he\'s cured\r\nmy pain! Ah! you don\'t know what my pain is when it comes!"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have much to do with him, all the same!" said the Laird.\r\n"I\'d sooner have any pain than have it cured in that unnatural way, and\r\nby such a man as that! He\'s a bad fellow, Svengali--I\'m sure of it! He\r\nmesmerized you; that\'s what it is--mesmerism! I\'ve often heard of it,\r\nbut never seen it done before. They get you into their power, and just\r\nmake you do any blessed thing they please--lie, murder, steal--anything!\r\nand kill yourself into the bargain when they\'ve done with you! It\'s just\r\ntoo terrible to think of!"\r\n\r\nSo spake the Laird, earnestly, solemnly, surprised out of his usual\r\nself, and most painfully impressed--and his own impressiveness grew upon\r\nhim and impressed him still more. He loomed quite prophetic.\r\n\r\nCold shivers went down Trilby\'s back as she listened. She had a\r\nsingularly impressionable nature, as was shown by her quick and ready\r\nsusceptibility to Svengali\'s hypnotic influence. And all that day, as\r\nshe posed for Durien (to whom she did not mention her adventure), she\r\nwas haunted by the memory of Svengali\'s big eyes and the touch of his\r\nsoft, dirty finger-tips on her face; and her fear and her repulsion grew\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAnd "Svengali, Svengali, Svengali!" went ringing in her head and ears\r\ntill it became an obsession, a dirge, a knell, an unendurable burden,\r\nalmost as hard to bear as the pain in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"_Svengali, Svengali, Svengali!_"\r\n\r\nAt last she asked Durien if he knew him.\r\n\r\n"Parbleu! Si je connais Svengali!"\r\n\r\n"Quest-ce que t\'en penses?"\r\n\r\n"Quand il sera mort, \xc3\xa7a fera une fameuse crapule de moins!"\r\n\r\n\r\n"CHEZ CARREL."\r\n\r\nCarrel\'s atelier (or painting-school) was in the Rue Notre Dame des\r\nPotirons St. Michel, at the end of a large court-yard, where there were\r\nmany large dirty windows facing north, and each window let the light of\r\nheaven into a large dirty studio.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these studios, and the dirtiest, was Carrel\'s, where some\r\nthirty or forty art students drew and painted from the nude model every\r\nday but Sunday from eight till twelve, and for two hours in the\r\nafternoon, except on Saturdays, when the afternoon was devoted to\r\nmuch-needed Augean sweepings and cleanings.\r\n\r\nOne week the model was male, the next female, and so on, alternating\r\nthroughout the year.\r\n\r\nA stove, a model-throne, stools, boxes, some fifty strongly built low\r\nchairs with backs, a couple of score easels and many drawing-boards,\r\ncompleted the mobilier.\r\n\r\nThe bare walls were adorned with endless caricatures--_des charges_--in\r\ncharcoal and white chalk; and also the scrapings of many palettes--a\r\npolychromous decoration not unpleasing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'\xc3\x87A FERA UNE FAMEUSE CRAPULE DE MOINS\'"]\r\n\r\nFor the freedom of the studio and the use of the model each student paid\r\nten francs a month to the massier, or senior student, the responsible\r\nbellwether of the flock; besides this, it was expected of you, on your\r\nentrance or initiation, that you should pay for your footing--your\r\n_bienvenue_--some thirty, forty, or fifty francs, to be spent on cakes\r\nand rum punch all round.\r\n\r\nEvery Friday Monsieur Carrel, a great artist, and also a stately,\r\nwell-dressed, and most courteous gentleman (duly decorated with the red\r\nrosette of the Legion of Honor), came for two or three hours and went\r\nthe round, spending a few minutes at each drawing-board or easel--ten\r\nor even twelve when the pupil was an industrious and promising one.\r\n\r\nHe did this for love, not money, and deserved all the reverence with\r\nwhich he inspired this somewhat irreverent and most unruly company,\r\nwhich was made up of all sorts.\r\n\r\nGraybeards who had been drawing and painting there for thirty years and\r\nmore, and remembered other masters than Carrel, and who could draw and\r\npaint a torso almost as well as Titian or Velasquez--almost, but not\r\nquite--and who could never do anything else, and were fixtures at\r\nCarrel\'s for life.\r\n\r\nYounger men who in a year or two, or three or five, or ten or twenty,\r\nwere bound to make their mark, and perhaps follow in the footsteps of\r\nthe master; others as conspicuously singled out for failure and future\r\nmischance--for the hospital, the garret, the river, the Morgue, or,\r\nworse, the traveller\'s bag, the road, or even the paternal counter.\r\n\r\nIrresponsible boys, mere rapins, all laugh and chaff and\r\nmischief--"blague et bagout Parisien"; little lords of misrule--wits,\r\nbutts, bullies; the idle and industrious apprentice, the good and the\r\nbad, the clean and the dirty (especially the latter)--all more or less\r\nanimated by a certain _esprit de corps_, and working very happily and\r\ngenially together, on the whole, and always willing to help each other\r\nwith sincere artistic counsel if it were asked for seriously, though it\r\nwas not always couched in terms very flattering to one\'s self-love.\r\n\r\nBefore Little Billee became one of this band of brothers he had been\r\nworking for three or four years in a London art school, drawing and\r\npainting from the life; he had also worked from the antique in the\r\nBritish Museum--so that he was no novice.\r\n\r\nAs he made his d\xc3\xa9but at Carrel\'s one Monday morning he felt somewhat shy\r\nand ill at ease. He had studied French most earnestly at home in\r\nEngland, and could read it pretty well, and even write it and speak it\r\nafter a fashion; but he spoke it with much difficulty, and found studio\r\nFrench a different language altogether from the formal and polite\r\nlanguage he had been at such pains to learn. Ollendorff does not cater\r\nfor the quartier latin. Acting on Taffy\'s advice--for Taffy had worked\r\nunder Carrel--Little Billee handed sixty francs to the massier for his\r\n_bienvenue_--a lordly sum--and this liberality made a most favorable\r\nimpression, and went far to destroy any little prejudice that might have\r\nbeen caused by the daintiness of his dress, the cleanliness of his\r\nperson, and the politeness of his manners. A place was assigned to him,\r\nand an easel and a board; for he elected to stand at his work and begin\r\nwith a chalk drawing. The model (a male) was posed, and work began in\r\nsilence. Monday morning is always rather sulky everywhere (except\r\nperhaps in judee). During the ten minutes\' rest three or four students\r\ncame and looked at Little Billee\'s beginnings, and saw at a glance that\r\nhe thoroughly well knew what he was about, and respected him for it.\r\n\r\nNature had given him a singularly light hand--or rather two, for he was\r\nambidextrous, and could use both with equal skill; and a few months\'\r\npractice at a London life school had quite cured him of that\r\npurposeless indecision of touch which often characterizes the prentice\r\nhand for years of apprenticeship, and remains with the amateur for life.\r\nThe lightest and most careless of his pencil strokes had a precision\r\nthat was inimitable, and a charm that specially belonged to him, and was\r\neasy to recognize at a glance. His touch on either canvas or paper was\r\nlike Svengali\'s on the key-board--unique.\r\n\r\nAs the morning ripened little attempts at conversation were made--little\r\nbreakings of the ice of silence. It was Lambert, a youth with a\r\nsingularly facetious face, who first woke the stillness with the\r\nfollowing uncalled-for remarks in English very badly pronounced:\r\n\r\n"Av you seen my fahzere\'s ole shoes?"\r\n\r\n"I av not seen your fahzere\'s ole shoes."\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause:\r\n\r\n"Av you seen my fahzere\'s ole \'at?"\r\n\r\n"I av not seen your fahzere\'s old \'at!"\r\n\r\nPresently another said, "Je trouve qu\'il a une jolie t\xc3\xaate, l\'Anglais."\r\n\r\nBut I will put it all into English:\r\n\r\n"I find that he has a pretty head--the Englishman! What say _you_,\r\nBarizel?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but why has he got eyes like brandy-balls, two a penny?"\r\n\r\n"Because he\'s an Englishman!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but why has he got a mouth like a guinea-pig, with two big teeth\r\nin front like the double blank at dominos?"\r\n\r\n"Because he\'s an Englishman!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'AV YOU SEEN MY FAHZERE\'S OLE SHOES?\'"]\r\n\r\n"Yes; but why has he got a back without any bend in it, as if he\'d\r\nswallowed the Colonne Vend\xc3\xb4me as far up as the battle of Austerlitz?"\r\n\r\n"Because he\'s an Englishman!"\r\n\r\nAnd so on, till all the supposed characteristics of Little Billee\'s\r\nouter man were exhausted. Then:\r\n\r\n"Papelard!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"_I_ should like to know if the Englishman says his prayers before going\r\nto bed."\r\n\r\n"Ask him."\r\n\r\n"Ask him yourself!"\r\n\r\n"_I_ should like to know if the Englishman has sisters; and if so, how\r\nold and how many and what sex."\r\n\r\n"Ask him."\r\n\r\n"Ask him yourself!"\r\n\r\n"_I_ should like to know the detailed and circumstantial history of the\r\nEnglishman\'s first love, and how he lost his innocence!"\r\n\r\n"Ask him," etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee, conscious that he was the object of conversation, grew\r\nsomewhat nervous. Soon he was addressed directly.\r\n\r\n"Dites donc, l\'Anglais?"\r\n\r\n"Kwaw?" said Little Billee.\r\n\r\n"Avez-vous une s\xc5\x93ur?"\r\n\r\n"Wee."\r\n\r\n"Est-ce qu\'elle vous ressemble?"\r\n\r\n"Nong."\r\n\r\n"C\'est bien dommage! Est-ce qu\'elle dit ses pri\xc3\xa8res, le soir, en se\r\ncouchant?"\r\n\r\nA fierce look came into Little Billee\'s eyes and a redness to his\r\ncheeks, and this particular form of overture to friendship was\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nPresently Lambert said, "Si nous mettions l\'Anglais \xc3\xa0 l\'\xc3\xa9chelle?"\r\n\r\nLittle Billee, who had been warned, knew what this ordeal meant.\r\n\r\nThey tied you to a ladder, and carried you in procession up and down the\r\ncourt-yard, and if you were nasty about it they put you under the pump.\r\n\r\nDuring the next rest it was explained to him that he must submit to this\r\nindignity, and the ladder (which was used for reaching the high shelves\r\nround the studio) was got ready.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee smiled a singularly winning smile, and suffered himself to\r\nbe bound with such good-humor that they voted it wasn\'t amusing, and\r\nunbound him, and he escaped the ordeal by ladder.\r\n\r\nTaffy had also escaped, but in another way. When they tried to seize him\r\nhe took up the first _rapin_ that came to hand, and, using him as a kind\r\nof club, he swung him about so freely and knocked down so many students\r\nand easels and drawing-boards with him, and made such a terrific rumpus,\r\nthat the whole studio had to cry for "pax!" Then he performed feats of\r\nstrength of such a surprising kind that the memory of him remained in\r\nCarrel\'s studio for years, and he became a legend, a tradition, a myth!\r\nIt is now said (in what still remains of the quartier latin) that he was\r\nseven feet high, and used to juggle with the massier and model as with a\r\npair of billiard balls, using only his left hand!\r\n\r\nTo return to Little Billee. When it struck twelve, the cakes and rum\r\npunch arrived--a very goodly sight that put every one in a good temper.\r\n\r\nThe cakes were of three kinds--Babas, Madeleines, and Savarins--three\r\nsous apiece, fourpence half-penny the set of three. No nicer cakes are\r\nmade in France, and they are as good in the quartier latin as anywhere\r\nelse; no nicer cakes are made in the whole world, that I know of. You\r\nmust begin with the Madeleine, which is rich and rather heavy; then the\r\nBaba; and finish up with the Savarin, which is shaped like a ring, very\r\nlight, and flavored with rum. And then you must really leave off.\r\n\r\nThe rum punch was tepid, very sweet, and not a bit too strong.\r\n\r\nThey dragged the model-throne into the middle, and a chair was put on\r\nfor Little Billee, who dispensed his hospitality in a very polite and\r\nattractive manner, helping the massier first, and then the other\r\ngraybeards in the order of their grayness, and so on down to the model.\r\n\r\nPresently, just as he was about to help himself, he was asked to sing\r\nthem an English song. After a little pressing he sang them a song about\r\na gay cavalier who went to serenade his mistress (and a ladder of ropes,\r\nand a pair of masculine gloves that didn\'t belong to the gay cavalier,\r\nbut which he found in his lady\'s bower)--a poor sort of song, but it was\r\nthe nearest approach to a comic song he knew. There are four verses to\r\nit, and each verse is rather long. It does not sound at all funny to a\r\nFrench audience, and even with an English one Little Billee was not good\r\nat comic songs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAFFY \xc3\x80 L\'\xc3\x89CHELLE!]\r\n\r\nHe was, however, much applauded at the end of each verse. When he had\r\nfinished, he was asked if he were _quite_ sure there wasn\'t any more of\r\nit, and they expressed a deep regret; and then each student, straddling\r\non his little thick-set chair as on a horse, and clasping the back of it\r\nin both hands, galloped round Little Billee\'s throne quite\r\nseriously--the strangest procession he had ever seen. It made him laugh\r\ntill he cried, so that he couldn\'t eat or drink.\r\n\r\nThen he served more punch and cake all round; and just as he was going\r\nto begin himself, Papelard said:\r\n\r\n"Say, you others, I find that the Englishman has something of truly\r\ndistinguished in the voice, something of sympathetic, of\r\ntouching--something of _je ne sais quoi_!"\r\n\r\nBouchardy: "Yes, yes--something of _je ne sais quoi_! That\'s the very\r\nphrase--n\'est-ce pas, vous autres, that is a good phrase that Papelard\r\nhas just invented to describe the voice of the Englishman. He is very\r\nintelligent, Papelard."\r\n\r\nChorus: "Perfect, perfect; he has the genius of characterization,\r\nPapelard. Dites donc, l\'Anglais! once more that beautiful song--hein?\r\nNous vous en prions tous."\r\n\r\nLittle Billee willingly sang it again, with even greater applause, and\r\nagain they galloped, but the other way round and faster, so that Little\r\nBillee became quite hysterical, and laughed till his sides ached.\r\n\r\nThen Dubosc: "I find there is something of very capitous and exciting in\r\nEnglish music--of very stimulating. And you, Bouchardy?"\r\n\r\nBouchardy: "Oh, me! It is above all the _words_ that I admire; they have\r\nsomething of passionate, of romantic--\'ze-ese gl\xc3\xa2-\xc3\xa2ves, zese\r\ngl\xc3\xa2-\xc3\xa2ves--zey do not belong to me.\' I don\'t know what that means, but I\r\nlove that sort of--of--of--_je ne sais quoi_, in short! Just _once_\r\nmore, l\'Anglais; only _once_, the _four_ couplets."\r\n\r\nSo he sang it a third time, all four verses, while they leisurely ate\r\nand drank and smoked and looked at each other, nodding solemn\r\ncommendation of certain phrases in the song: "Tr\xc3\xa8s bien!" "Tr\xc3\xa8s bien!"\r\n"Ah! voil\xc3\xa0 qui est bien r\xc3\xa9ussi!" "\xc3\x89patant, \xc3\xa7a!" "Tr\xc3\xa8s fin!" etc., etc.\r\nFor, stimulated by success, and rising to the occasion, he did his very\r\nutmost to surpass himself in emphasis of gesture and accent and\r\nhistrionic drollery--heedless of the fact that not one of his listeners\r\nhad the slightest notion what his song was about.\r\n\r\nIt was a sorry performance.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not till he had sung it four times that he discovered the\r\nwhole thing was an elaborate impromptu farce, of which he was the butt,\r\nand that of all his royal spread not a crumb or a drop was left for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt was the old fable of the fox and the crow! And to do him justice, he\r\nlaughed as heartily as any one, as if he thoroughly enjoyed the\r\njoke--and when you take jokes in that way people soon leave off poking\r\nfun at you. It is almost as good as being very big, like Taffy, and\r\nhaving a choleric blue eye!\r\n\r\nSuch was Little Billee\'s first experience of Carrel\'s studio, where he\r\nspent many happy mornings and made many good friends.\r\n\r\nNo more popular student had ever worked there within the memory of the\r\ngrayest graybeards; none more amiable, more genial, more cheerful,\r\nself-respecting, considerate, and polite, and certainly none with\r\ngreater gifts for art.\r\n\r\nCarrel would devote at least fifteen minutes to him, and invited him\r\noften to his own private studio. And often, on the fourth and fifth day\r\nof the week, a group of admiring students would be gathered by his easel\r\nwatching him as he worked.\r\n\r\n"C\'est un rude lapin, l\'Anglais! au moins il sait son orthographe en\r\npeinture, ce coco-l\xc3\xa0!"\r\n\r\nSuch was the verdict on Little Billee at Carrel\'s studio; and I can\r\nconceive no loftier praise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYoung as she was (seventeen or eighteen, or thereabouts), and also\r\ntender (like Little Billee), Trilby had singularly clear and quick\r\nperceptions in all matters that concerned her tastes, fancies, or\r\naffections, and thoroughly knew her own mind, and never lost much time\r\nin making it up.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of her first visit to the studio in the Place St.\r\nAnatole des Arts, it took her just five minutes to decide that it was\r\nquite the nicest, homeliest, genialest, jolliest studio in the whole\r\nquartier latin, or out of it, and its three inhabitants, individually\r\nand collectively, were more to her taste than any one else she had ever\r\nmet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE FOX AND THE CROW"]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they were English, and she loved to hear her\r\nmother-tongue and speak it. It awoke all manner of tender recollections,\r\nsweet reminiscences of her childhood, her parents, her old home--such a\r\nhome as it was--or, rather, such homes; for there had been many\r\nflittings from one poor nest to another. The O\'Ferralls had been as\r\nbirds on the bough.\r\n\r\nShe had loved her parents very dearly; and, indeed, with all their\r\nfaults, they had many endearing qualities--the qualities that so often\r\ngo with those particular faults--charm, geniality, kindness, warmth of\r\nheart, the constant wish to please, the generosity that comes before\r\njustice, and lends its last sixpence and forgets to pay its debts!\r\n\r\nShe knew other English and American artists, and had sat to them\r\nfrequently for the head and hands; but none of these, for general\r\nagreeableness of aspect or manner, could compare in her mind with the\r\nstalwart and magnificent Taffy, the jolly fat Laird of Cockpen, the\r\nrefined, sympathetic, and elegant Little Billee; and she resolved that\r\nshe would see as much of them as she could, that she would make herself\r\nat home in that particular studio, and necessary to its "locataires";\r\nand, without being the least bit vain or self-conscious, she had no\r\ndoubts whatever of her power to please--to make herself both useful and\r\nornamental if it suited her purpose to do so.\r\n\r\nHer first step in this direction was to borrow P\xc3\xa8re Martin\'s basket and\r\nlantern and pick (he had more than one set of these trade properties)\r\nfor the use of Taffy, whom she feared she might have offended by the\r\nfreedom of her comments on his picture.\r\n\r\nThen, as often as she felt it to be discreet, she sounded her war-cry at\r\nthe studio door and went in and made kind inquiries, and, sitting\r\ncross-legged on the model-throne, ate her bread and cheese and smoked\r\nher cigarette and "passed the time of day," as she chose to call it;\r\ntelling them all such news of the quartier as had come within her own\r\nimmediate ken. She was always full of little stories of other studios,\r\nwhich, to do her justice, were always good-natured, and probably\r\ntrue--quite so, as far as she was concerned; she was the most literal\r\nperson alive; and she told all these "ragots, cancans, et potins\r\nd\'atelier" in a quaint and amusing manner. The slightest look of gravity\r\nor boredom on one of those three faces, and she made herself scarce at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nShe soon found opportunities for usefulness also. If a costume were\r\nwanted, for instance, she knew where to borrow it, or hire it or buy it\r\ncheaper than any one anywhere else. She procured stuffs for them at cost\r\nprice, as it seemed, and made them into draperies and female garments of\r\nany kind that was wanted, and sat in them for the toreador\'s sweetheart\r\n(she made the mantilla herself), for Taffy\'s starving dress-maker about\r\nto throw herself into the Seine, for Little Billee\'s studies of the\r\nbeautiful French peasant girl in his picture, now so famous, called "The\r\nPitcher Goes to the Well."\r\n\r\nThen she darned their socks and mended their clothes, and got all their\r\nwashing done properly and cheaply at her friend Madame Boisse\'s, in the\r\nRue des Clo\xc3\xaetres Ste. P\xc3\xa9tronille.\r\n\r\nAnd then again, when they were hard up and wanted a good round sum of\r\nmoney for some little pleasure excursion, such as a trip to\r\nFontainebleau or Barbizon for two or three days, it was she who took\r\ntheir watches and scarf-pins and things to the Mount of Piety in the\r\nStreet of the Well of Love (where dwelt "ma tante," which is French for\r\n"my uncle" in this connection), in order to raise the necessary funds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LATIN QUARTER]\r\n\r\nShe was, of course, most liberally paid for all these little services,\r\nrendered with such pleasure and good-will--far too liberally, she\r\nthought. She would have been really happier doing them for love.\r\n\r\nThus in a very short time she became a _persona gratissima_--a sunny and\r\never welcome vision of health and grace and liveliness and unalterable\r\ngood-humor, always ready to take any trouble to please her beloved\r\n"Angliches," as they were called by Madame Vinard, the handsome\r\nshrill-voiced _concierge_, who was almost jealous; for she was devoted\r\nto the Angliches too--and so was Monsieur Vinard--and so were the little\r\nVinards.\r\n\r\nShe knew when to talk and when to laugh and when to hold her tongue; and\r\nthe sight of her sitting cross-legged on the model-throne darning the\r\nLaird\'s socks or sewing buttons on his shirts or repairing the\r\nsmoke-holes in his trousers was so pleasant that it was painted by all\r\nthree. One of these sketches (in water-color, by Little Billee) sold the\r\nother day at Christie\'s for a sum so large that I hardly dare to mention\r\nit. It was done in an afternoon.\r\n\r\nSometimes on a rainy day, when it was decided they should dine at home,\r\nshe would fetch the food and cook it, and lay the cloth, and even make\r\nthe salad. She was a better saladist than Taffy, a better cook than the\r\nLaird, a better caterer than Little Billee. And she would be invited to\r\ntake her share in the banquet. And on these occasions her tremulous\r\nhappiness was so immense that it would be quite pathetic to see--almost\r\npainful; and their three British hearts were touched by thoughts of all\r\nthe loneliness and homelessness, the expatriation, the half-conscious\r\nloss of caste, that all this eager childish clinging revealed.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why (no doubt) that with all this familiar intimacy there\r\nwas never any hint of gallantry or flirtation in any shape or form\r\nwhatever--bonne camaraderie, voil\xc3\xa0 tout. Had she been Little Billee\'s\r\nsister she could not have been treated with more real respect. And her\r\ndeep gratitude for this unwonted compliment transcended any passion she\r\nhad ever felt. As the good Lafontaine so prettily says,\r\n\r\n    "Ces animaux vivaient entre eux comme cousins;\r\n     Cette union si douce, et presque fraternelle,\r\n     Edifiait tous les voisins!"\r\n\r\nAnd then their talk! It was to her as the talk of the gods in Olympus,\r\nsave that it was easier to understand, and she could always understand\r\nit. For she was a very intelligent person, in spite of her wofully\r\nneglected education, and most ambitious to learn--a new ambition for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSo they lent her books--English books: Dickens, Thackeray, Walter\r\nScott--which she devoured in the silence of the night, the solitude of\r\nher little attic in the Rue des Pousse-Cailloux, and new worlds were\r\nrevealed to her. She grew more English every day; and that was a good\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nTrilby speaking English and Trilby speaking French were two different\r\nbeings. Trilby\'s English was more or less that of her father, a\r\nhighly-educated man; her mother, who was a Scotch woman, although an\r\nuneducated one, had none of the ungainliness that mars the speech of so\r\nmany English women in that humble rank--no droppings of the h, no\r\nbroadening of the o\'s and a\'s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUISINE BOURGEOISE EN BOH\xc3\x88ME]\r\n\r\nTrilby\'s French was that of the quartier latin--droll, slangy, piquant,\r\nquaint, picturesque--quite the reverse of ungainly, but in which there\r\nwas scarcely a turn of phrase that would not stamp the speaker as\r\nbeing hopelessly, emphatically "no lady!" Though it was funny without\r\nbeing vulgar, it was perhaps a little _too_ funny!\r\n\r\nAnd she handled her knife and fork in the dainty English way, as no\r\ndoubt her father had done--and his; and, indeed, when alone with them\r\nshe was so absolutely "like a lady" that it seemed quite odd (though\r\nvery seductive) to see her in a grisette\'s cap and dress and apron. So\r\nmuch for her English training.\r\n\r\nBut enter a Frenchman or two, and a transformation effected itself\r\nimmediately--a new incarnation of Trilbyness--so droll and amusing that\r\nit was difficult to decide which of her two incarnations was the most\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that she had her faults--like Little Billee.\r\n\r\nFor instance, she would be miserably jealous of any other woman who came\r\nto the studio, to sit or scrub or sweep or do anything else, even of the\r\ndirty tipsy old hag who sat for Taffy\'s "found drowned"--"as if she\r\ncouldn\'t have sat for it herself!"\r\n\r\nAnd then she would be cross and sulky, but not for long--an injured\r\nmartyr, soon ready to forgive and be forgiven.\r\n\r\nShe would give up any sitting to come and sit to her three English\r\nfriends. Even Durien had serious cause for complaint.\r\n\r\nThen her affection was exacting: she always wanted to be told one was\r\nfond of her, and she dearly loved her own way, even in the sewing on of\r\nbuttons and the darning of socks, which was innocent enough. But when\r\nit came to the cutting and fashioning of garments for a toreador\'s\r\nbride, it was a nuisance not to be borne!\r\n\r\n"What could _she_ know of toreadors\' brides and their wedding-dresses?"\r\nthe Laird would indignantly ask--as if he were a toreador himself; and\r\nthis was the aggravating side of her irrepressible Trilbyness.\r\n\r\nIn the caressing, demonstrative tenderness of her friendship she "made\r\nthe soft eyes" at all three indiscriminately. But sometimes Little\r\nBillee would look up from his work as she was sitting to Taffy or the\r\nLaird, and find her gray eyes fixed on him with an all-enfolding gaze,\r\nso piercingly, penetratingly, unutterably sweet and kind and tender,\r\nsuch a brooding, dovelike look of soft and warm solicitude, that he\r\nwould feel a flutter at his heart, and his hand would shake so that he\r\ncould not paint; and in a waking dream he would remember that his mother\r\nhad often looked at him like that when he was a small boy, and she a\r\nbeautiful young woman untouched by care or sorrow; and the tear that\r\nalways lay in readiness so close to the corner of Little Billee\'s eye\r\nwould find it very difficult to keep itself in its proper place--unshed.\r\n\r\nAnd at such moments the thought that Trilby sat for the figure would go\r\nthrough him like a knife.\r\n\r\nShe did not sit promiscuously to anybody who asked, it is true. But she\r\nstill sat to Durien; to the great G\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me; to M. Carrel, who scarcely\r\nused any other model.\r\n\r\nIt was poor Trilby\'s sad distinction that she surpassed all other models\r\nas Calypso surpassed her nymphs; and whether by long habit, or through\r\nsome obtuseness in her nature, or lack of imagination, she was equally\r\nunconscious of self with her clothes on or without! Truly, she could be\r\nnaked and unashamed--in this respect an absolute savage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE SOFT EYES"]\r\n\r\nShe would have ridden through Coventry, like Lady Godiva--but without\r\ngiving it a thought beyond wondering why the streets were empty and the\r\nshops closed and the blinds pulled down--would even have looked up to\r\nPeeping Tom\'s shutter with a friendly nod, had she known he was behind\r\nit!\r\n\r\nIn fact, she was absolutely without that kind of shame, as she was\r\nwithout any kind of fear. But she was destined soon to know both fear\r\nand shame.\r\n\r\nAnd here it would not be amiss for me to state a fact well known to all\r\npainters and sculptors who have used the nude model (except a few senile\r\npretenders, whose purity, not being of the right sort, has gone rank\r\nfrom too much watching), namely, that nothing is so chaste as nudity.\r\nVenus herself, as she drops her garments and steps on to the\r\nmodel-throne, leaves behind her on the floor every weapon in her armory\r\nby which she can pierce to the grosser passions of man. The more perfect\r\nher unveiled beauty, the more keenly it appeals to his higher instincts.\r\nAnd where her beauty fails (as it almost always does somewhere in the\r\nVenuses who sit for hire), the failure is so lamentably conspicuous in\r\nthe studio light--the fierce light that beats on this particular\r\nthrone--that Don Juan himself, who has not got to paint, were fain to\r\nhide his eyes in sorrow and disenchantment, and fly to other climes.\r\n\r\nAll beauty is sexless in the eyes of the artist at his work--the beauty\r\nof man, the beauty of woman, the heavenly beauty of the child, which is\r\nthe sweetest and best of all.\r\n\r\nIndeed it is woman, lovely woman, whose beauty falls the shortest, for\r\nsheer lack of proper physical training.\r\n\r\nAs for Trilby, G----, to whom she sat for his Phryne, once told me that\r\nthe sight of her thus was a thing to melt Sir Galahad, and sober\r\nSilenus, and chasten Jove himself--a thing to Quixotize a modern French\r\nmasher! I can well believe him. For myself, I only speak of Trilby as I\r\nhave seen her--clothed and in her right mind. She never sat to me for\r\nany Phryne, never bared herself to me, nor did I ever dream of asking\r\nher. I would as soon have asked the Queen of Spain to let me paint her\r\nlegs! But I have worked from many female models in many countries, some\r\nof them the best of their kind. I have also, like Svengali, seen Taffy\r\n"trying to get himself clean," either at home or in the swimming-baths\r\nof the Seine; and never a sitting woman among them all who could match\r\nfor grace or finish or splendor of outward form that mighty Yorkshireman\r\nsitting in his tub, or sunning himself, like Ilyssus, at the Bains Henri\r\nQuatre, or taking his running header _\xc3\xa0 la hussarde_, off the\r\nspring-board at the Bains Deligny, with a group of wondering Frenchmen\r\ngathered round.\r\n\r\nUp he shot himself into mid-air with a sounding double downward kick,\r\nparabolically; then, turning a splendid semi-demi-summersault against\r\nthe sky, down he came headlong, his body straight and stiff as an arrow,\r\nand made his clean hole in the water without splash or sound, to\r\nreappear a hundred yards farther on!\r\n\r\n"Sac \xc3\xa0 papier! quel gaillard que cet Anglais, hein?"\r\n\r\n"A-t-on jamais vu un torse pareil!"\r\n\r\n"Et les bras, donc!"\r\n\r\n"Et les jambes, nom d\'un tonnerre!"\r\n\r\n"M\xc3\xa2tin! J\'aimerais mieux \xc3\xaatre en col\xc3\xa8re contre lui qu\'il ne soit en\r\ncol\xc3\xa8re contre moi!" etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOmne ignotum pro magnifico!\r\n\r\nIf our climate were such that we could go about without any clothes on,\r\nwe probably should; in which case, although we should still murder and\r\nlie and steal and bear false witness against our neighbor, and break the\r\nSabbath day and take the Lord\'s name in vain, much deplorable wickedness\r\nof another kind would cease to exist for sheer lack of mystery; and\r\nChristianity would be relieved of its hardest task in this sinful world,\r\nand Venus Aphrodite (_alias_ Aselgeia) would have to go a-begging along\r\nwith the tailors and dress-makers and boot-makers, and perhaps our\r\nbodies and limbs would be as those of the Theseus and Venus of Milo; who\r\nwas no Venus, except in good looks!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILYSSUS]\r\n\r\nAt all events, there would be no cunning, cruel deceptions, no artful\r\ntaking in of artless inexperience, no unduly hurried waking-up from\r\nLove\'s young dream, no handing down to posterity of hidden uglinesses\r\nand weaknesses, and worse!\r\n\r\nAnd also many a flower, now born to blush unseen, would be reclaimed\r\nfrom its desert, and suffered to hold its own, and flaunt away with the\r\nbest in the inner garden of roses!\r\n\r\nAnd here let me humbly apologize to the casual reader for the length and\r\npossible irrelevancy of this digression, and for its subject. To those\r\nwho may find matter for sincere disapprobation or even grave offence in\r\na thing that has always seemed to me so simple, so commonplace, as to be\r\nhardly worth talking or writing about, I can only plead a sincerity\r\nequal to theirs, and as deep a love and reverence for the gracious,\r\ngoodly shape that God is said to have made after His own image for\r\ninscrutable purposes of His own.\r\n\r\nNor, indeed, am I pleading for such a subversive and revolutionary\r\nmeasure as the wholesale abolition of clothes, being the chilliest of\r\nmortals, and quite unlike Mr. Theseus or Mr. Ilyssus either.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSometimes Trilby would bring her little brother to the studio in the\r\nPlace St. Anatole des Arts, in his "beaux habits de P\xc3\xa2ques," his hair\r\nwell curled and pomatumed, his hands and face well washed.\r\n\r\nHe was a very engaging little mortal. The Laird would fill his pockets\r\nfull of Scotch goodies, and paint him as a little Spaniard in "Le Fils\r\ndu Toreador," a sweet little Spaniard with blue eyes, and curly locks\r\nas light as tow, and a complexion of milk and roses, in singular and\r\npiquant contrast to his swarthy progenitor.\r\n\r\nTaffy would use him as an Indian club or a dumb-bell, to the child\'s\r\ninfinite delight, and swing him on the trapeze, and teach him "la boxe."\r\n\r\nAnd the sweetness and fun of his shrill, happy, infantile laughter\r\n(which was like an echo of Trilby\'s, only an octave higher) so moved and\r\ntouched and tickled one that Taffy had to look quite fierce, so he might\r\nhide the strange delight of tenderness that somehow filled his manly\r\nbosom at the mere sound of it (lest Little Billee and the Laird should\r\nthink him goody-goody); and the fiercer Taffy looked, the less this\r\nsmall mite was afraid of him.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee made a beautiful water-color sketch of him, just as he\r\nwas, and gave it to Trilby, who gave it to le p\xc3\xa8re Martin, who gave it\r\nto his wife with strict injunctions not to sell it as an old master.\r\nAlas! it _is_ an old master now, and Heaven only knows who has got it!\r\n\r\nThose were happy days for Trilby\'s little brother, happy days for\r\nTrilby, who was immensely fond of him, and very proud. And the happiest\r\nday of all was when Trois Angliches took Trilby and Jeannot (for so the\r\nmite was called) to spend the Sunday in the woods at Meudon, and\r\nbreakfast and dine at the garde champ\xc3\xaatre\'s. Swings, peep-shows,\r\ndonkey-rides; shooting at a mark with cross-bows and little pellets of\r\nclay, and smashing little plaster figures and winning macaroons; losing\r\none\'s self in the beautiful forest; catching newts and tadpoles and\r\nyoung frogs; making music on mirlitons. Trilby singing "Ben Bolt" into a\r\nmirliton was a thing to be remembered, whether one would or no!\r\n\r\nTrilby on this occasion came out in a new character, _en demoiselle_,\r\nwith a little black bonnet, and a gray jacket of her own making.\r\n\r\nTo look at (but for her loose, square-toed, heelless silk boots laced up\r\nthe inner side), she might have been the daughter of an English\r\ndean--until she undertook to teach the Laird some favorite cancan steps.\r\nAnd then the Laird himself, it must be admitted, no longer looked like\r\nthe son of a worthy, God-fearing, Sabbath-keeping Scotch solicitor.\r\n\r\nThis was after dinner, in the garden, at "la loge du garde champ\xc3\xaatre."\r\nTaffy and Jeannot and Little Billee made the necessary music on their\r\nmirlitons, and the dancing soon became general, with plenty also to look\r\non, for the garde had many customers who dined there on summer Sundays.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Trilby was far and away the belle of\r\nthat particular ball, and there have been worse balls in much finer\r\ncompany, and far plainer women!\r\n\r\nTrilby lightly dancing the cancan (there are cancans and cancans) was a\r\nsingularly gainly and seductive person--_et vera incessu patuit dea_!\r\nHere, again, she was funny without being vulgar. And for mere grace\r\n(even in the cancan), she was the forerunner of Miss Kate Vaughan; and,\r\nfor sheer fun, the precursor of Miss Nelly Farren!\r\n\r\nAnd the Laird, trying to dance after her ("dongsong le konkong," as he\r\ncalled it), was too funny for words; and if genuine popular success is a\r\ntrue test of humor, no greater humorist ever danced a _pas seul_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'VOIL\xc3\x80 L\'ESPAYCE DE HOM KER JER SWEE!\'"]\r\n\r\nWhat Englishmen could do in France during the fifties, and yet manage to\r\npreserve their self-respect, and even the respect of their respectable\r\nFrench friends!\r\n\r\n"Voil\xc3\xa0 l\'espayce de hom ker jer swee!" said the Laird, every time he\r\nbowed in acknowledgment of the applause that greeted his performance of\r\nvarious solo steps of his own--Scotch reels and sword-dances that come\r\nin admirably....\r\n\r\nThen, one fine day, the Laird fell ill, and the doctor had to be sent\r\nfor, and he ordered a nurse. But Trilby would hear of no nurses, not\r\neven a Sister of Charity! She did all the nursing herself, and never\r\nslept a wink for three successive days and nights.\r\n\r\nOn the third day the Laird was out of all danger, the delirium was past,\r\nand the doctor found poor Trilby fast asleep by the bedside.\r\n\r\nMadame Vinard, at the bedroom door, put her finger to her lips, and\r\nwhispered: "Quel bonheur! il est sauv\xc3\xa9, M. le Docteur; \xc3\xa9coutez! il dit\r\nses pri\xc3\xa8res en Anglais, ce brave gar\xc3\xa7on!"\r\n\r\nThe good old doctor, who didn\'t understand a word of English, listened,\r\nand heard the Laird\'s voice, weak and low, but quite clear, and full of\r\nheart-felt fervor, intoning, solemnly:\r\n\r\n    "\'Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffron,\r\n          Soles, onions, garlic, roach, and dace--\r\n      All these you eat at Terr\xc3\xa9\'s Tavern\r\n          In that one dish of bouillabaisse!\'"\r\n\r\n"Ah! mais c\'est tr\xc3\xa8s bien de sa part, ce brave jeune homme! rendre\r\ngr\xc3\xa2ces au ciel comme cela, quand le danger est pass\xc3\xa9! tr\xc3\xa8s bien, tr\xc3\xa8s\r\nbien!"\r\n\r\nSceptic and Voltairian as he was, and not the friend of prayer, the good\r\ndoctor was touched, for he was old, and therefore kind and tolerant, and\r\nmade allowances.\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards he said such sweet things to Trilby about it all, and\r\nabout her admirable care of his patient, that she positively wept with\r\ndelight--like sweet Alice with hair so brown, whenever Ben Bolt gave her\r\na smile.\r\n\r\nAll this sounds very goody-goody, but it\'s true.\r\n\r\nSo it will be easily understood how the trois Angliches came in time to\r\nfeel for Trilby quite a peculiar regard, and looked forward with\r\nsorrowful forebodings to the day when this singular and pleasant little\r\nquartet would have to be broken up, each of them to spread his wings and\r\nfly away on his own account, and poor Trilby to be left behind all by\r\nherself. They would even frame little plans whereby she might better\r\nherself in life, and avoid the many snares and pitfalls that would beset\r\nher lonely path in the quartier latin when they were gone.\r\n\r\nTrilby never thought of such things as these; she took short views of\r\nlife, and troubled herself about no morrows.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one jarring figure in her little fool\'s paradise, a\r\nbaleful and most ominous figure that constantly crossed her path, and\r\ncame between her and the sun, and threw its shadow over her, and that\r\nwas Svengali.\r\n\r\nHe also was a frequent visitor at the studio in the Place St. Anatole,\r\nwhere much was forgiven him for the sake of his music, especially when\r\nhe came with Gecko and they made music together. But it soon became\r\napparent that they did not come there to play to the three Angliches: it\r\nwas to see Trilby, whom they both had taken it into their heads to\r\nadore, each in a different fashion:\r\n\r\nGecko, with a humble, doglike worship that expressed itself in mute,\r\npathetic deference and looks of lowly self-depreciation, of apology for\r\nhis own unworthy existence, as though the only requital he would ever\r\ndare to dream of were a word of decent politeness, a glance of tolerance\r\nor good-will--a mere bone to a dog.\r\n\r\nSvengali was a bolder wooer. When he cringed, it was with a mock\r\nhumility full of sardonic threats; when he was playful, it was with a\r\nterrible playfulness, like that of a cat with a mouse--a weird ungainly\r\ncat, and most unclean; a sticky, haunting, long, lean, uncanny, black\r\nspider-cat, if there is such an animal outside a bad dream.\r\n\r\nIt was a great grievance to him that she had suffered from no more pains\r\nin her eyes. She had; but preferred to endure them rather than seek\r\nrelief from him.\r\n\r\nSo he would playfully try to mesmerize her with his glance, and sidle up\r\nnearer and nearer to her, making passes and counter-passes, with stern\r\ncommand in his eyes, till she would shake and shiver and almost sicken\r\nwith fear, and all but feel the spell come over her, as in a nightmare,\r\nand rouse herself with a great effort and escape.\r\n\r\nIf Taffy were there he would interfere with a friendly "Now then, old\r\nfellow, none of that!" and a jolly slap on the back, which would make\r\nSvengali cough for an hour, and paralyze his mesmeric powers for a week.\r\n\r\nSvengali had a stroke of good-fortune. He played at three grand\r\nconcerts with Gecko, and had a well-deserved success. He even gave a\r\nconcert of his own, which made a furor, and blossomed out into beautiful\r\nand costly clothes of quite original color and shape and pattern, so\r\nthat people would turn round and stare at him in the street--a thing he\r\nloved. He felt his fortune was secure, and ran into debt with tailors,\r\nhatters, shoemakers, jewellers, but paid none of his old debts to his\r\nfriends. His pockets were always full of printed slips--things that had\r\nbeen written about him in the papers--and he would read them aloud to\r\neverybody he knew, especially to Trilby, as she sat darning socks on the\r\nmodel-throne while the fencing and boxing were in train. And he would\r\nlay his fame and his fortune at her feet, on condition that she should\r\nshare her life with him.\r\n\r\n"Ach, himmel, Drilpy!" he would say, "you don\'t know what it is to be a\r\ngreat pianist like me--hein! What is your Little Billee, with his\r\nstinking oil-bladders, sitting mum in his corner, his mahlstick and his\r\npalette in one hand, and his twiddling little footle pig\'s-hair brush in\r\nthe other! What noise does _he_ make? When his little fool of a picture\r\nis finished he will send it to London, and they will hang it on a wall\r\nwith a lot of others, all in a line, like recruits called out for\r\ninspection, and the yawning public will walk by in procession and\r\ninspect, and say \'damn!\' Svengali will go to London _himself_. Ha! ha!\r\nHe will be all alone on a platform, and play as nobody else can play;\r\nand hundreds of beautiful Engl\xc3\xa4nderinnen will see and hear and go mad\r\nwith love for him--Prinzessen, Comtessen, Serene English Altessen. They\r\nwill soon lose their Serenity and their Highness when they hear\r\nSvengali! They will invite him to their palaces, and pay him a thousand\r\nfrancs to play for them; and after, he will loll in the best arm-chair,\r\nand they will sit all round him on footstools, and bring him tea and gin\r\nand k\xc3\xbcchen and marrons glac\xc3\xa9s, and lean over him and fan him--for he is\r\ntired after playing them for a thousand francs of Chopin! Ha, ha! I know\r\nall about it--hein?\r\n\r\n"And he will not look at them, even! He will look inward, at his own\r\ndream--and his dream will be about Drilpy--to lay his talent, his glory,\r\nhis thousand francs at her beautiful white feet!\r\n\r\n"Their stupid, big, fat, tow-headed, putty-nosed husbands will be mad\r\nwith jealousy, and long to box him, but they will be afraid. Ach! those\r\nbeautiful Anglaises! they will think it an honor to mend his shirts, to\r\nsew buttons on his pantaloons; to darn his socks, as you are doing now\r\nfor that sacred imbecile of a Scotchman who is always trying to paint\r\ntoreadors, or that sweating, pig-headed bullock of an Englander who is\r\nalways trying to get himself dirty and then to get himself clean\r\nagain!--_e da capo!_\r\n\r\n"Himmel! what big socks are those! what potato-sacks!\r\n\r\n"Look at your Taffy! what is he good for but to bang great musicians on\r\nthe back with his big bear\'s paw! He finds that droll, the bullock!...\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIT FOR TAT]\r\n\r\n"Look at your Frenchmen there--your damned conceited verfluchte pig-dogs\r\nof Frenchmen--Durien, Barizel, Bouchardy!

She ought to be rolling in her\r\ncarriage and pair!\' And just then who should come by, rolling in his\r\ncarriage and pair, smothered in furs, and smoking a big cigar of the\r\nHavana, but Svengali, who will jump out, and push the canaille aside,\r\nand say, \'Ha! ha! that is la grande Drilpy, who would not listen to\r\nSvengali, but looked at the chimney-pots when he told her of his manly\r\nlove, and--\'"\r\n\r\n"Hi! damn it, Svengali, what the devil are you talking to Trilby about?\r\nYou\'re making her sick; can\'t you see? Leave off, and go to the piano,\r\nman, or I\'ll come and slap you on the back again!"\r\n\r\nThus would that sweating, pig-headed bullock of an Englander stop\r\nSvengali\'s love-making and release Trilby from bad quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\nThen Svengali, who had a wholesome dread of the pig-headed bullock,\r\nwould go to the piano and make impossible discords, and say: "Dear\r\nDrilpy, come and sing \'Pen Polt\'! I am thirsting for those so beautiful\r\nchest notes! Come!"\r\n\r\nPoor Trilby needed little pressing when she was asked to sing, and would\r\ngo through her lamentable performance, to the great discomfort of Little\r\nBillee. It lost nothing of its grotesqueness from Svengali\'s\r\naccompaniment, which was a triumph of cacophony, and he would encourage\r\nher--"Tr\xc3\xa8s pien, tr\xc3\xa8s pien, \xc3\xa7a y est!"\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, Svengali would test her ear, as he called it, and\r\nstrike the C in the middle and then the F just above, and ask which was\r\nthe highest; and she would declare they were both exactly the same. It\r\nwas only when he struck a note in the bass and another in the treble\r\nthat she could perceive any difference, and said that the first sounded\r\nlike p\xc3\xa8re Martin blowing up his wife, and the second like her little\r\ngodson trying to make the peace between them.\r\n\r\nShe was quite tone-deaf, and didn\'t know it; and he would pay her\r\nextravagant compliments on her musical talent, till Taffy would say:\r\n"Look here, Svengali, let\'s hear _you_ sing a song!"\r\n\r\nAnd he would tickle him so masterfully under the ribs that the creature\r\nhowled and became quite hysterical.\r\n\r\nThen Svengali would vent his love of teasing on Little Billee, and pin\r\n_his_ arms behind his back and swing him round, saying: "Himmel! what\'s\r\nthis for an arm? It\'s like a girl\'s!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s strong enough to paint!" said Little Billee.\r\n\r\n"And what\'s this for a leg? It\'s like a mahlstick!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s strong enough to kick, if you don\'t leave off!"\r\n\r\nAnd Little Billee, the young and tender, would let out his little heel\r\nand kick the German\'s shins; and just as the German was going to\r\nretaliate, big Taffy would pin _his_ arms and make him sing another\r\nsong, more discordant than Trilby\'s--for he didn\'t dream of kicking\r\nTaffy; of that you may be sure!\r\n\r\nSuch was Svengali--only to be endured for the sake of his music--always\r\nready to vex, frighten, bully, or torment anybody or anything smaller\r\nand weaker than himself--from a woman or a child to a mouse or a fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Third\r\n\r\n    "Par de\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa0, ne dela la mer\r\n         Ne s\xc3\xa7ay dame ni damoiselle\r\n         Qui soit en tous biens parfaits telle--\r\n     C\'est un songe que d\'y penser:\r\n     Dieu! qu\'il fait bon la regarder!"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne lovely Monday morning in late September, at about eleven or so,\r\nTaffy and the Laird sat in the studio--each opposite his picture,\r\nsmoking, nursing his knee, and saying nothing. The heaviness of Monday\r\nweighed on their spirits more than usual, for the three friends had\r\nreturned late on the previous night from a week spent at Barbizon and in\r\nthe forest of Fontainebleau--a heavenly week among the painters:\r\nRousseau, Millet, Corot, Daubigny, let us suppose, and others less known\r\nto fame this day. Little Billee, especially, had been fascinated by all\r\nthis artistic life in blouses and sabots and immense straw hats and\r\npanamas, and had sworn to himself and to his friends that he would some\r\nday live and die there--painting, the forest as it is, and peopling it\r\nwith beautiful people out of his own fancy--leading a healthy out-door\r\nlife of simple wants and lofty aspirations.\r\n\r\nAt length Taffy said: "Bother work this morning! I feel much more like a\r\nstroll in the Luxembourg Gardens and lunch at the Caf\xc3\xa9 de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on, where\r\nthe omelets are good and the wine isn\'t blue."\r\n\r\n"The very thing I was thinking of myself," said the Laird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HAPPY LIFE]\r\n\r\nSo Taffy slipped on his old shooting-jacket and his old Harrow cricket\r\ncap, with the peak turned the wrong way, and the Laird put on an old\r\ngreat-coat of Taffy\'s that reached to his heels, and a battered straw\r\nhat they had found in the studio when they took it; and both sallied\r\nforth into the mellow sunshine on the way to Carrel\'s. For they meant to\r\nseduce Little Billee from his work, that he might share in their\r\nlaziness, greediness, and general demoralization.\r\n\r\nAnd whom should they meet coming down the narrow turreted old Rue\r\nVieille des Mauvais Ladres but Little Billee himself, with an air of\r\ngeneral demoralization so tragic that they were quite alarmed. He had\r\nhis paint-box and field-easel in one hand and his little valise in the\r\nother. He was pale, his hat on the back of his head, his hair staring\r\nall at sixes and sevens, like a sick Scotch terrier\'s.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord! what\'s the matter?" said Taffy.\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! oh! she\'s sitting at Carrel\'s!"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s sitting at Carrel\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Trilby! sitting to all those ruffians! There she was, just as I opened\r\nthe door; I saw her, I tell you! The sight of her was like a blow\r\nbetween the eyes, and I bolted! I shall never go back to that beastly\r\nhole again! I\'m off to Barbizon, to paint the forest; I was coming round\r\nto tell you. Good-bye!..."\r\n\r\n"Stop a minute--are you mad?" said Taffy, collaring him.\r\n\r\n"Let me go, Taffy--let me go, damn it! I\'ll come back in a week--but I\'m\r\ngoing now! Let me go; do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"But look here--I\'ll go with you."\r\n\r\n"No; I want to be alone--quite alone. Let me go, I tell you!"\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t let you go unless you swear to me, on your honor, that you\'ll\r\nwrite directly, you get there, and every day till you come back. Swear!"\r\n\r\n"All right; I swear--honor bright! Now there! Good-bye--good-bye; back\r\non Sunday--good-bye!" And he was off.\r\n\r\n"Now, what the devil does all that mean?" asked Taffy, much perturbed.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'s shocked at seeing Trilby in that guise, or disguise, or\r\nunguise, sitting at Carrel\'s--he\'s such an odd little chap. And I must\r\nsay, I\'m surprised at Trilby. It\'s a bad thing for her when we\'re away.\r\nWhat could have induced her? She never sat in a studio of that kind\r\nbefore. I thought she only sat to Durien and old Carrel."\r\n\r\nThey walked for a while in silence.\r\n\r\n"Do you know, I\'ve got a horrid idea that the little fool\'s in love with\r\nher!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve long had a horrid idea that _she\'s_ in love with _him_."\r\n\r\n"That would be a very stupid business," said Taffy.\r\n\r\nThey walked on, brooding over those two horrid ideas, and the more they\r\nbrooded, considered, and remembered, the more convinced they became that\r\nboth were right.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a pretty kettle of fish!" said the Laird--"and talking of fish,\r\nlet\'s go and lunch."\r\n\r\nAnd so demoralized were they that Taffy ate three omelets without\r\nthinking, and the Laird drank two half-bottles of wine, and Taffy three,\r\nand they walked about the whole of that afternoon for fear Trilby should\r\ncome to the studio--and were very unhappy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is how Trilby came to sit at Carrel\'s studio:\r\n\r\nCarrel had suddenly taken it into his head that he would spend a week\r\nthere, and paint a figure among his pupils, that they might see and\r\npaint with--and if possible like--him. And he had asked Trilby as a\r\ngreat favor to be the model, and Trilby was so devoted to the great\r\nCarrel that she readily consented. So that Monday morning found her\r\nthere, and Carrel posed her as Ingres\'s famous figure in his picture\r\ncalled "La Source," holding a stone pitcher on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'LET ME GO, TAFFY ...\'"]\r\n\r\nAnd the work began in religious silence. Then in five minutes or so\r\nLittle Billee came bursting in, and as soon as he caught sight of her he\r\nstopped and stood as one petrified, his shoulders up, his eyes staring.\r\nThen lifting his arms, he turned and fled.\r\n\r\n"Qu\'est ce qu\'il a donc, ce Litrebili?" exclaimed one or two students\r\n(for they had turned his English nickname into French).\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he\'s forgotten something," said another. "Perhaps he\'s\r\nforgotten to brush his teeth and part his hair!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he\'s forgotten to say his prayers!" said Barizel.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll come back, I hope!" exclaimed the master.\r\n\r\nAnd the incident gave rise to no further comment.\r\n\r\nBut Trilby was much disquieted, and fell to wondering what on earth was\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nAt first she wondered in French: French of the quartier latin. She had\r\nnot seen Little Billee for a week, and wondered if he were ill. She had\r\nlooked forward so much to his painting her--painting her\r\nbeautifully--and hoped he would soon come back, and lose no time.\r\n\r\nThen she began to wonder in English--nice clean English of the studio in\r\nthe Place St. Anatole des Arts--her father\'s English--and suddenly a\r\nquick thought pierced her through and through, and made the flesh tingle\r\non her insteps and the backs of her hands, and bathed her brow and\r\ntemples with sweat.\r\n\r\nShe had good eyes, and Little Billee had a singularly expressive face.\r\n\r\nCould it possibly be that he was _shocked_ at seeing her sitting there?\r\n\r\nShe knew that he was peculiar in many ways. She remembered that neither\r\nhe nor Taffy nor the Laird had ever asked her to sit for the figure,\r\nthough she would have been only too delighted to do so for them. She\r\nalso remembered how Little Billee had always been silent whenever she\r\nalluded to her posing for the "altogether," as she called it, and had\r\nsometimes looked pained and always very grave.\r\n\r\nShe turned alternately pale and red, pale and red all over, again and\r\nagain, as the thought grew up in her--and soon the growing thought\r\nbecame a torment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'QU\'EST CE QU\'IL A DONC, CE LITREBILI?\'"]\r\n\r\nThis new-born feeling of shame was unendurable--its birth a travail that\r\nracked and rent every fibre of her moral being, and she suffered agonies\r\nbeyond anything she had ever felt in her life.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with you, my child? Are you ill?" asked Carrel,\r\nwho, like every one else, was very fond of her, and to whom she had sat\r\nas a child ("l\'Enfance de Psych\xc3\xa9," now in the Luxembourg Gallery, was\r\npainted from her).\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and the work went on.\r\n\r\nPresently she dropped her pitcher, that broke into bits; and putting her\r\ntwo hands to her face she burst into tears and sobs--and there, to the\r\namazement of everybody, she stood crying like a big baby--"La source aux\r\nlarmes?"\r\n\r\n"What _is_ the matter, my poor dear child?" said Carrel, jumping up and\r\nhelping her off the throne.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know--I don\'t know--I\'m ill--very ill--let me go home!"\r\n\r\nAnd with kind solicitude and despatch they helped her on with her\r\nclothes, and Carrel sent for a cab and took her home.\r\n\r\nAnd on the way she dropped her head on his shoulder, and wept, and told\r\nhim all about it as well as she could, and Monsieur Carrel had tears in\r\nhis eyes too, and wished to Heaven he had never induced her to sit for\r\nthe figure, either then or at any other time. And pondering deeply and\r\nsorrowfully on such terrible responsibility (he had grown-up daughters\r\nof his own), he went back to the studio; and in an hour\'s time they got\r\nanother model and another pitcher, and went to work again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd Trilby, as she lay disconsolate on her bed all that day and all the\r\nnext, and all the next again, thought of her past life with agonies of\r\nshame and remorse that made the pain in her eyes seem as a light and\r\nwelcome relief. For it came, and tortured worse and lasted longer than\r\nit had ever done before. But she soon found, to her miserable\r\nbewilderment, that mind-aches are the worst of all.\r\n\r\nThen she decided that she must write to one of the trois Angliches, and\r\nchose the Laird.\r\n\r\nShe was more familiar with him than with the other two: it was\r\nimpossible not to be familiar with the Laird if he liked one, as he was\r\nso easy-going and demonstrative, for all that he was such a canny Scot!\r\nThen she had nursed him through his illness; she had often hugged and\r\nkissed him before the whole studio full of people--and even when alone\r\nwith him it had always seemed quite natural for her to do so. It was\r\nlike a child caressing a favorite young uncle or elder brother. And\r\nthough the good Laird was the least susceptible of mortals, he would\r\noften find these innocent blandishments a somewhat trying ordeal! She\r\nhad never taken such a liberty with Taffy; and as for Little Billee, she\r\nwould sooner have died!\r\n\r\nSo she wrote to the Laird. I give her letter without the spelling, which\r\nwas often faulty, although her nightly readings had much improved it:\r\n\r\n     "MY DEAR FRIEND,--I am very unhappy. I was sitting at Carrel\'s, in\r\n     the Rue des Potirons, and Little Billee came in, and was so shocked\r\n     and disgusted that he ran away and never came back.\r\n\r\n     "I saw it all in his face.\r\n\r\n     "I sat there because M. Carrel asked me to. He has always been very\r\n     kind to me--M. Carrel--ever since I was a child; and I would do\r\n     anything to please him, but never _that_ again.\r\n\r\n     "He was there too.\r\n\r\n     "I never thought anything about sitting before. I sat first as a\r\n     child to M. Carrel. Mamma made me, and made me promise not to tell\r\n     papa, and so I didn\'t. It soon seemed as natural to sit for people\r\n     as to run errands for them, or wash and mend their clothes. Papa\r\n     wouldn\'t have liked my doing that either, though we wanted the\r\n     money badly. And so he never knew.\r\n\r\n     "I have sat for the altogether to several other people besides--M.\r\n     G\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me, Durien, the two Hennequins, and \xc3\x89mile Baratier; and for the\r\n     head and hands to lots of people, and for the feet only to Charles\r\n     Faure, Andr\xc3\xa9 Besson, Mathieu Dumoulin, and Collinet. Nobody else.\r\n\r\n     "It seemed as natural for me to sit as for a man. Now I see the\r\n     awful difference.\r\n\r\n     "And I have done dreadful things besides, as you must know--as all\r\n     the quartier knows. Baratier and Besson; but not Durien, though\r\n     people think so. Nobody else, I swear--except old Monsieur Penque\r\n     at the beginning, who was mamma\'s friend.\r\n\r\n     "It makes me almost die of shame and misery to think of it; for\r\n     that\'s not like sitting. I knew how wrong it was all along--and\r\n     there\'s no excuse for me, none. Though lots of people do as bad,\r\n     and nobody in the quartier seems to think any the worse of them.\r\n\r\n     "If you and Taffy and Little Billee cut me, I really think I shall\r\n     go mad and die. Without your friendship I shouldn\'t care to live a\r\n     bit. Dear Sandy, I love your little finger better than any man or\r\n     woman I ever met; and Taffy\'s and Little Billee\'s little fingers\r\n     too.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REPENTANCE]\r\n\r\n     "What shall I do? I daren\'t go out for fear of meeting one of you.\r\n     Will you come and see me?\r\n\r\n     "I am never going to sit again, not even for the face and hands. I\r\n     am going back to be a _blanchisseuse de fin_ with my old friend\r\n     Ang\xc3\xa8le Boisse, who is getting on very well indeed, in the Rue des\r\n     Clo\xc3\xaetres Ste. P\xc3\xa9tronille.\r\n\r\n     "You _will_ come and see me, won\'t you? I shall be in all day till\r\n     you do. Or else I will meet you somewhere, if you will tell me\r\n     where and when; or else I will go and see you in the studio, if you\r\n     are sure to be alone. Please don\'t keep me waiting long for an\r\n     answer.\r\n\r\n     "You don\'t know what I\'m suffering.\r\n\r\n     "Your ever-loving, faithful friend,\r\n\r\n     "TRILBY O\'FERRALL."\r\n\r\nShe sent this letter by hand, and the Laird came in less than ten\r\nminutes after she had sent it; and she hugged and kissed and cried over\r\nhim so that he was almost ready to cry himself; but he burst out\r\nlaughing instead--which was better and more in his line, and very much\r\nmore comforting--and talked to her so nicely and kindly and naturally\r\nthat by the time he left her humble attic in the Rue des Pousse-Cailloux\r\nher very aspect, which had quite shocked him when he first saw her, had\r\nalmost become what it usually was.\r\n\r\nThe little room under the leads, with its sloping roof and mansard\r\nwindow, was as scrupulously neat and clean as if its tenant had been a\r\nholy sister who taught the noble daughters of France at some Convent of\r\nthe Sacred Heart. There were nasturtiums and mignonette on the outer\r\nwindow-sill, and convolvulus was trained to climb round the window.\r\n\r\nAs she sat by his side on the narrow white bed, clasping and stroking\r\nhis painty, turpentiny hand, and kissing it every five minutes, he\r\ntalked to her like a father--as he told Taffy afterwards--and scolded\r\nher for having been so silly as not to send for him directly, or come to\r\nthe studio. He said how glad he was, how glad they would all be, that\r\nshe was going to give up sitting for the figure--not, of course, that\r\nthere was any real harm in it, but it was better not--and especially how\r\nhappy it would make them to feel she intended to live straight for the\r\nfuture. Little Billee was to remain at Barbizon for a little while; but\r\nshe must promise to come and dine with Taffy and himself that very day,\r\nand cook the dinner; and when he went back to his picture, "Les Noces du\r\nTor\xc3\xa9ador"--saying to her as he left, "\xc3\xa0 ce soir donc, mille sacr\xc3\xa9s\r\ntonnerres de nong de Dew!"--he left the happiest woman in the whole\r\nLatin quarter behind him: she had confessed and been forgiven.\r\n\r\nAnd with shame and repentance and confession and forgiveness had come a\r\nstrange new feeling--that of a dawning self-respect.\r\n\r\nHitherto, for Trilby, self-respect had meant little more than the mere\r\ncleanliness of her body, in which she had always revelled; alas! it was\r\none of the conditions of her humble calling. It now meant another kind\r\nof cleanliness, and she would luxuriate in it for evermore; and the\r\ndreadful past--never to be forgotten by her--should be so lived down as\r\nin time, perhaps, to be forgotten by others.\r\n\r\nThe dinner that evening was a memorable one for Trilby. After she had\r\nwashed up the knives and forks and plates and dishes, and put them by,\r\nshe sat and sewed. She wouldn\'t even smoke her cigarette, it reminded\r\nher so of things and scenes she now hated. No more cigarettes for Trilby\r\nO\'Ferrall.\r\n\r\nThey all talked of Little Billee. She heard about the way he had been\r\nbrought up, about his mother and sister, the people he had always lived\r\namong. She also heard (and her heart alternately rose and sank as she\r\nlistened) what his future was likely to be, and how rare his genius was,\r\nand how great--if his friends were to be trusted. Fame and fortune would\r\nsoon be his--such fame and fortune as fell to the lot of very\r\nfew--unless anything should happen to spoil his promise and mar his\r\nprospects in life, and ruin a splendid career; and the rising of the\r\nheart was all for him, the sinking for herself. How could she ever hope\r\nto be even the friend of such a man? Might she ever hope to be his\r\nservant--his faithful, humble servant?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLittle Billee spent a month at Barbizon, and when he came back it was\r\nwith such a brown face that his friends hardly knew him; and he brought\r\nwith him such studies as made his friends "sit up."\r\n\r\nThe crushing sense of their own hopeless inferiority was lost in wonder\r\nat his work, in love and enthusiasm for the workman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONFESSION]\r\n\r\nTheir Little Billee, so young and tender, so weak of body, so strong of\r\npurpose, so warm of heart, so light of hand, so keen and quick and\r\npiercing of brain and eye, was their master, to be stuck on a pedestal\r\nand looked up to and bowed down to, to be watched and warded and\r\nworshipped for evermore.\r\n\r\nWhen Trilby came in from her work at six, and he shook hands with her\r\nand said "Hullo, Trilby!" her face turned pale to the lips, her\r\nunder-lip quivered, and she gazed down at him (for she was among the\r\ntallest of her sex) with such a moist, hungry, wide-eyed look of humble\r\ncraving adoration that the Laird felt his worst fears were realized, and\r\nthe look Little Billee sent up in return filled the manly bosom of Taffy\r\nwith an equal apprehension.\r\n\r\nThen they all four went and dined together at le p\xc3\xa8re Trin\'s, and Trilby\r\nwent back to her _blanchisserie de fin_.\r\n\r\nNext day Little Billee took his work to show Carrel, and Carrel invited\r\nhim to come and finish his picture "The Pitcher Goes to the Well" at his\r\nown private studio--an unheard-of favor, which the boy accepted with a\r\nthrill of proud gratitude and affectionate reverence.\r\n\r\nSo little was seen for some time of Little Billee at the studio in the\r\nPlace St. Anatole des Arts, and little of Trilby; a _blanchisseuse de\r\nfin_ has not many minutes to spare from her irons. But they often met at\r\ndinner. And on Sunday mornings Trilby came to repair the Laird\'s linen\r\nand darn his socks and look after his little comforts, as usual, and\r\nspend a happy day. And on Sunday afternoons the studio would be as\r\nlively as ever, with the fencing and boxing, the piano-playing and\r\nfiddling--all as it used to be.\r\n\r\nAnd week by week the friends noticed a gradual and subtle change in\r\nTrilby. She was no longer slangy in French, unless it were now and then\r\nby a slip of the tongue, no longer so facetious and droll, and yet she\r\nseemed even happier than she had ever seemed before.\r\n\r\nAlso, she grew thinner, especially in the face, where the bones of her\r\ncheeks and jaw began to show themselves, and these bones were\r\nconstructed on such right principles (as were those of her brow and chin\r\nand the bridge of her nose) that the improvement was astonishing, almost\r\ninexplicable.\r\n\r\nAlso, she lost her freckles as the summer waned and she herself went\r\nless into the open air. And she let her hair grow, and made of it a\r\nsmall knot at the back of her head, and showed her little flat ears,\r\nwhich were charming, and just in the right place, very far back and\r\nrather high; Little Billee could not have placed them better himself.\r\nAlso, her mouth, always too large, took on a firmer and sweeter outline,\r\nand her big British teeth were so white and even that even Frenchmen\r\nforgave them their British bigness. And a new soft brightness came into\r\nher eyes that no one had ever seen there before. They were stars, just\r\ntwin gray stars--or rather planets just thrown off by some new sun, for\r\nthe steady mellow light they gave out was not entirely their own.\r\n\r\nFavorite types of beauty change with each succeeding generation. These\r\nwere the days of Buckner\'s aristocratic Album beauties, with lofty\r\nforeheads, oval faces, little aquiline noses, heart-shaped little\r\nmouths, soft dimpled chins, drooping shoulders, and long side ringlets\r\nthat fell over them--the Lady Arabellas and the Lady Clementinas,\r\nMusidoras and Medoras! A type that will perhaps come back to us some\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMay the present scribe be dead!\r\n\r\nTrilby\'s type would be infinitely more admired now than in the fifties.\r\nHer photograph would be in the shop-windows. Sir Edward Burne-Jones--if\r\nI may make so bold as to say so--would perhaps have marked her for his\r\nown, in spite of her almost too exuberant joyousness and irrepressible\r\nvitality. Rossetti might have evolved another new formula from her; Sir\r\nJohn Millais another old one of the kind that is always new and never\r\nsates nor palls--like Clytie, let us say--ever old and ever new as love\r\nitself!\r\n\r\nTrilby\'s type was in singular contrast to the type Gavarni had made so\r\npopular in the Latin quarter at the period we are writing of, so that\r\nthose who fell so readily under her charm were rather apt to wonder why.\r\nMoreover, she was thought much too tall for her sex, and her day, and\r\nher station in life, and especially for the country she lived in. She\r\nhardly looked up to a bold gendarme! and a bold gendarme was nearly as\r\ntall as a "dragon de la garde," who was nearly as tall as an average\r\nEnglish policeman. Not that she was a giantess, by any means. She was\r\nabout as tall as Miss Ellen Terry--and that is a charming height, _I_\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "ALL AS IT USED TO BE"]\r\n\r\nOne day Taffy remarked to the Laird: "Hang it! I\'m blest if Trilby isn\'t\r\nthe handsomest woman I know! She looks like a grande dame masquerading\r\nas a grisette--almost like a joyful saint at times. She\'s lovely! By\r\nJove! I couldn\'t stand her hugging me as she does you! There\'d be a\r\ntragedy--say the slaughter of Little Billee."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Taffy, my boy," rejoined the Laird, "when those long sisterly arms\r\nare round my neck it isn\'t _me_ she\'s hugging."\r\n\r\n"And then," said Taffy, "what a trump she is! Why, she\'s as upright and\r\nstraight and honorable as a man! And what she says to one about one\'s\r\nself is always so pleasant to hear! That\'s Irish, I suppose. And, what\'s\r\nmore, it\'s always true."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s Scotch!" said the Laird, and tried to wink at Little Billee,\r\nbut Little Billee wasn\'t there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "TWIN GRAY STARS"]\r\n\r\nEven Svengali perceived the strange metamorphosis. "Ach, Drilpy," he\r\nwould say, on a Sunday afternoon, "how beautiful you are! It drives me\r\nmad! I adore you. I like you thinner; you have such beautiful bones! Why\r\ndo you not answer my letters? What! you do not _read_ them? You _burn_\r\nthem? And yet I--Donnerwetter! I forgot! The grisettes of the quartier\r\nlatin have not learned how to read or write; they have only learned how\r\nto dance the cancan with the dirty little pig-dog monkeys they call men.\r\nSacrement! We will teach the little pig-dog monkeys to dance something\r\nelse some day, we Germans. We will make music for them to dance to!\r\nBoum! boum! Better than the waiter at the Caf\xc3\xa9 de la Rotonde, hein? And\r\nthe grisettes of the quartier latin shall pour us out your little white\r\nwine--\'fotre betit fin planc,\' as your pig-dog monkey of a poet says,\r\nyour rotten verfluchter De Musset, \'who has got such a splendid future\r\nbehind him\'! Bah! What do _you_ know of Monsieur Alfred de Musset? We\r\nhave got a poet too, my Drilpy. His name is Heinrich Heine. If he\'s\r\nstill alive, he lives in Paris, in a little street off the Champs\r\n\xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es. He lies in bed all day long, and only sees out of one eye, like\r\nthe Countess Hahn-Hahn, ha! ha! He adores French grisettes. He married\r\none. Her name is Mathilde, and she has got s\xc3\xbcssen f\xc3\xbcssen, like you. He\r\nwould adore you too, for your beautiful bones; he would like to count\r\nthem one by one, for he is very playful, like me. And, ach! what a\r\nbeautiful skeleton you will make! And very soon, too, because you do not\r\nsmile on your madly-loving Svengali. You burn his letters without\r\nreading them! You shall have a nice little mahogany glass case all to\r\nyourself in the museum of the \xc3\x89cole de M\xc3\xa9decine, and Svengali shall come\r\nin his new fur-lined coat, smoking his big cigar of the Havana, and push\r\nthe dirty carabins out of the way, and look through the holes of your\r\neyes into your stupid empty skull, and up the nostrils of your high bony\r\nsounding-board of a nose without either a tip or a lip to it, and into\r\nthe roof of your big mouth, with your thirty-two big English teeth, and\r\nbetween your big ribs into your big chest, where the big leather lungs\r\nused to be, and say, \'Ach! what a pity she had no more music in her than\r\na big tomcat!\' And then he will look all down your bones to your poor\r\ncrumbling feet, and say, \'Ach! what a fool she was not to answer\r\nSvengali\'s letters!\' and the dirty carabins shall--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up, you sacred fool, or I\'ll precious soon spoil _your_ skeleton\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\nThus the short-tempered Taffy, who had been listening.\r\n\r\nThen Svengali, scowling, would play Chopin\'s funeral march more divinely\r\nthan ever; and where the pretty, soft part comes in, he would whisper to\r\nTrilby, "That is Svengali coming to look at you in your little mahogany\r\nglass case!"\r\n\r\nAnd here let me say that these vicious imaginations of Svengali\'s, which\r\nlook so tame in English print, sounded much more ghastly in French,\r\npronounced with a Hebrew-German accent, and uttered in his hoarse,\r\nrasping, nasal, throaty rook\'s caw, his big yellow teeth baring\r\nthemselves in a mongrel canine snarl, his heavy upper eyelids drooping\r\nover his insolent black eyes.\r\n\r\nBesides which, as he played the lovely melody he would go through a\r\nghoulish pantomime, as though he were taking stock of the different\r\nbones in her skeleton with greedy but discriminating approval. And when\r\nhe came down to the feet, he was almost droll in the intensity of his\r\nterrible realism. But Trilby did not appreciate this exquisite fooling,\r\nand felt cold all over.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to her a dread, powerful demon, who, but for Taffy (who alone\r\ncould hold him in check), oppressed and weighed on her like an\r\nincubus--and she dreamed of him oftener than she dreamed of Taffy, the\r\nLaird, or even Little Billee!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus pleasantly and smoothly, and without much change or adventure,\r\nthings went on till Christmastime.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee seldom spoke of Trilby, or Trilby of him. Work went on\r\nevery morning at the studio in the Place St. Anatole des Arts, and\r\npictures were begun and finished--little pictures that didn\'t take long\r\nto paint--the Laird\'s Spanish bull-fighting scenes, in which the bull\r\nnever appeared, and which he sent to his native Dundee and sold there;\r\nTaffy\'s tragic little dramas of life in the slums of Paris--starvings,\r\ndrownings--suicides by charcoal and poison--which he sent everywhere,\r\nbut did not sell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "AN INCUBUS"]\r\n\r\nLittle Billee was painting all this time at Carrel\'s studio--his private\r\none--and seemed preoccupied and happy when they all met at mealtime, and\r\nless talkative even than usual.\r\n\r\nHe had always been the least talkative of the three; more prone to\r\nlisten, and no doubt to think the more.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon people came and went as usual, and boxed and fenced and\r\ndid gymnastic feats, and felt Taffy\'s biceps, which by this time\r\nequalled Mr. Sandow\'s!\r\n\r\nSome of these people were very pleasant and remarkable, and have become\r\nfamous since then in England, France, America--or have died, or married,\r\nand come to grief or glory in other ways. It is the Ballad of the\r\nBouillabaisse all over again!\r\n\r\nIt might be worth while my trying to sketch some of the more noteworthy,\r\nnow that my story is slowing for a while--like a French train when the\r\nengine-driver sees a long curved tunnel in front of him, as I do--and no\r\nlight at the other end!\r\n\r\nMy humble attempts at characterization might be useful as "m\xc3\xa9moires pour\r\nservir" to future biographers. Besides, there are other reasons, as the\r\nreader will soon discover.\r\n\r\nThere was Durien, for instance--Trilby\'s especial French adorer, "pour\r\nle bon motif!" a son of the people, a splendid sculptor, a very fine\r\ncharacter in every way--so perfect, indeed, that there is less to say\r\nabout him than any of the others--modest, earnest, simple, frugal,\r\nchaste, and of untiring industry; living for his art, and perhaps also a\r\nlittle for Trilby, whom he would have been only too glad to marry. He\r\nwas Pygmalion; she was his Galatea--a Galatea whose marble heart would\r\nnever beat for _him_!\r\n\r\nDurien\'s house is now the finest in the Parc Monceau; his wife and\r\ndaughters are the best-dressed women in Paris, and he one of the\r\nhappiest of men; but he will never quite forget poor Galatea:\r\n\r\n"La belle aux pieds d\'alb\xc3\xa2tre--aux deux talons de rose!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there was Vincent, a Yankee medical student, who could both work\r\nand play.\r\n\r\nHe is now one of the greatest oculists in the world, and Europeans cross\r\nthe Atlantic to consult him. He can still play, and when he crosses the\r\nAtlantic himself for that purpose he has to travel incognito like a\r\nroyalty, lest his play should be marred by work. And his daughters are\r\nso beautiful and accomplished that British dukes have sighed after them\r\nin vain. Indeed, these fair young ladies spend their autumn holiday in\r\nrefusing the British aristocracy. We are told so in the society papers,\r\nand I can quite believe it. Love is not always blind; and if he is,\r\nVincent is the man to cure him.\r\n\r\nIn those days he prescribed for us all round, and punched and\r\nstethoscoped us, and looked at our tongues for love, and told us what to\r\neat, drink, and avoid, and even where to go for it.\r\n\r\nFor instance: late one night Little Billee woke up in a cold sweat, and\r\nthought himself a dying man--he had felt seedy all day and taken no\r\nfood; so he dressed and dragged himself to Vincent\'s hotel, and woke him\r\nup, and said, "Oh, Vincent, Vincent! I\'m a dying man!" and all but\r\nfainted on his bed. Vincent felt him all over with the greatest care,\r\nand asked him many questions. Then, looking at his watch, he delivered\r\nhimself thus: "Humph! 3.30! rather late--but still--look here, Little\r\nBillee--do you know the Halle, on the other side of the water, where\r\nthey sell vegetables?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! yes! What vegetable shall I--"\r\n\r\n"Listen! On the north side are two restaurants, Bordier and Baratte.\r\nThey remain open all night. Now go straight off to one of those tuck\r\nshops, and tuck in as big a supper as you possibly can. Some people\r\nprefer Baratte. I prefer Bordier myself. Perhaps you\'d better try\r\nBordier first and Baratte after. At all events, lose no time; so off you\r\ngo!"\r\n\r\nThus he saved Little Billee from an early grave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there was the Greek, a boy of only sixteen, but six feet high, and\r\nlooking ten years older than he was, and able to smoke even stronger\r\ntobacco than Taffy himself, and color pipes divinely; he was a great\r\nfavorite in the Place St. Anatole, for his _bonhomie_, his niceness, his\r\nwarm geniality. He was the capitalist of this select circle (and nobly\r\nlavish of his capital). He went by the name of Poluphloisboiospaleapologos\r\nPetrilopetrolicoconose--for so he was christened by the Laird--because\r\nhis real name was thought much too long and much too lovely for the\r\nquartier latin, and reminded one of the Isles of Greece--where burning\r\nSappho loved and sang.\r\n\r\nWhat was he learning in the Latin quarter? French? He spoke French like\r\na native! Nobody knows. But when his Paris friends transferred their\r\nbohemia to London, where were they ever made happier and more at home\r\nthan in his lordly parental abode--or fed with nicer things?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPITALIST AND THE SWELL]\r\n\r\nThat abode is now his, and lordlier than ever, as becomes the dwelling\r\nof a millionaire and city magnate; and its gray-bearded owner is as\r\ngenial, as jolly, and as hospitable as in the old Paris days, but he no\r\nlonger colors pipes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there was Carnegie, fresh from Balliol, redolent of the \'varsity.\r\nHe intended himself then for the diplomatic service, and came to Paris\r\nto learn French as it is spoke; and spent most of his time with his\r\nfashionable English friends on the right side of the river, and the rest\r\nwith Taffy, the Laird, and Little Billee on the left. Perhaps that is\r\nwhy he has not become an ambassador. He is now only a rural dean, and\r\nspeaks the worst French I know, and speaks it wherever and whenever he\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nIt serves him right, I think.\r\n\r\nHe was fond of lords, and knew some (at least, he gave one that\r\nimpression), and often talked of them, and dressed so beautifully that\r\neven Little Billee was abashed in his presence. Only Taffy, in his\r\nthreadbare out-at-elbow shooting-jacket and cricket cap, and the Laird,\r\nin his tattered straw hat and Taffy\'s old overcoat down to his heels,\r\ndared to walk arm in arm with him--nay, insisted on doing so--as they\r\nlistened to the band in the Luxembourg Gardens.\r\n\r\nAnd his whiskers were even longer and thicker and more golden than\r\nTaffy\'s own. But the mere sight of a boxing-glove made him sick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there was the yellow-haired Antony, a Swiss--the idle apprentice,\r\nle "roi des truands," as we called him--to whom everything was\r\nforgiven, as to Fran\xc3\xa7ois Villon, _\xc3\xa0 cause de ses gentillesses_ surely,\r\nfor all his reprehensible pranks, the gentlest and most lovable creature\r\nthat ever lived in bohemia, or out of it.\r\n\r\nAlways in debt, like Svengali--for he had no more notion of the value of\r\nmoney than a humming-bird, and gave away in reckless generosity to\r\nfriends what in strictness belonged to his endless creditors--like\r\nSvengali, humorous, witty, and a most exquisite and original artist, and\r\nalso somewhat eccentric in his attire (though scrupulously clean), so\r\nthat people would stare at him as he walked along--a thing that always\r\ngave him dire offence! But unlike Svengali, full of delicacy,\r\nrefinement, and distinction of mind and manner--void of any\r\nself-conceit--and, in spite of the irregularities of his life, the very\r\nsoul of truth and honor, as gentle as he was chivalrous and brave--the\r\nwarmest, stanchest, sincerest, most unselfish friend in the world; and,\r\nas long as his purse was full, the best and drollest boon companion in\r\nthe world--but that was not forever!\r\n\r\nWhen the money was gone, then would Antony hie him to some beggarly\r\nattic in some lost Parisian slum, and write his own epitaph in lovely\r\nFrench or German verse--or even English (for he was an astounding\r\nlinguist); and, telling himself that he was forsaken by family, friends,\r\nand mistress alike, look out of his casement over the Paris chimney-pots\r\nfor the last time, and listen once more to "the harmonies of nature," as\r\nhe called it--and "aspire towards the infinite," and bewail "the cruel\r\ndeceptions of his life"--and finally lay himself down to die of sheer\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nAnd as he lay and waited for his release that was so long in coming, he\r\nwould beguile the weary hours by mumbling a crust "watered with his own\r\nsalt tears," and decorating his epitaph with fanciful designs of the\r\nmost exquisite humor, pathos, and beauty--these illustrated epitaphs of\r\nthe young Antony, of which there exists a goodly number, are now\r\npriceless, as all collectors know all over the world.\r\n\r\nFainter and fainter would he grow--and finally, on the third day or\r\nthereabouts, a remittance would reach him from some long-suffering\r\nsister or aunt in far Lausanne--or else the fickle mistress or faithless\r\nfriend (who had been looking for him all over Paris) would discover his\r\nhiding-place, the beautiful epitaph would be walked off in triumph to le\r\np\xc3\xa8re Marcas in the Rue du Ghette and sold for twenty, fifty, a hundred\r\nfrancs--and then _Vogue la gal\xc3\xa9re!_ And back again to bohemia, dear\r\nbohemia and all its joys, as long as the money lasted ... _e poi, da\r\ncapo!_\r\n\r\nAnd now that his name is a household word in two hemispheres, and he\r\nhimself an honor and a glory to the land he has adopted as his own, he\r\nloves to remember all this and look back from the lofty pinnacle on\r\nwhich he sits perched up aloft to the impecunious days of his idle\r\napprenticeship--_le bon temps o\xc3\xb9 l\'on \xc3\xa9tait si malheureux!_\r\n\r\nAnd with all that Quixotic dignity of his, so famous is he as a wit that\r\nwhen he jokes (and he is always joking) people laugh first, and then ask\r\nwhat he was joking about. And you can even make your own mild funniments\r\nraise a roar by merely prefacing them "as Antony once said!"\r\n\r\nThe present scribe has often done so.\r\n\r\nAnd if by a happy fluke you should some day hit upon a really good thing\r\nof your own--good enough to be quoted--be sure it will come back to you\r\nafter many days prefaced "as Antony once said."\r\n\r\nAnd these jokes are so good-natured that you almost resent their being\r\nmade at anybody\'s expense but your own--never from Antony\r\n\r\n    "The aimless jest that striking has caused pain,\r\n     The idle word that he\'d wish back again!"\r\n\r\nIndeed, in spite of his success, I don\'t suppose he ever made an enemy\r\nin his life.\r\n\r\nAnd here, let me add (lest there be any doubt as to his identity), that\r\nhe is now tall and stout and strikingly handsome, though rather\r\nbald--and such an aristocrat in bearing, aspect, and manner that you\r\nwould take him for a blue-blooded descendant of the crusaders instead of\r\nthe son of a respectable burgher in Lausanne.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there was Lorrimer, the industrious apprentice, who is now also\r\nwell-pinnacled on high; himself a pillar of the Royal Academy--probably,\r\nif he lives long enough, its future president--the duly knighted or\r\nbaroneted Lord Mayor of "all the plastic arts" (except one or two\r\nperhaps, here and there, that are not altogether without some\r\nimportance).\r\n\r\nMay this not be for many, many years! Lorrimer himself would be the\r\nfirst to say so!\r\n\r\nTall, thin, red-haired, and well-favored, he was a most eager, earnest,\r\nand painstaking young enthusiast, of precocious culture, who read\r\nimproving books, and did not share in the amusements of the quartier\r\nlatin, but spent his evenings at home with Handel, Michael Angelo, and\r\nDante, on the respectable side of the river. Also, he went into good\r\nsociety sometimes, with a dress-coat on, and a white tie, and his hair\r\nparted in the middle!\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these blemishes on his otherwise exemplary record as an\r\nart student, he was the most delightful companion--the most\r\naffectionate, helpful, and sympathetic of friends. May he live long and\r\nprosper!\r\n\r\nEnthusiast as he was, he could only worship one god at a time. It was\r\neither Michael Angelo, Phidias, Paul Veronese, Tintoret, Raphael, or\r\nTitian--never a modern--moderns didn\'t exist! And so thoroughgoing was\r\nhe in his worship, and so persistent in voicing it, that he made those\r\nimmortals quite unpopular in the Place St. Anatole des Arts. We grew to\r\ndread their very names. Each of them would last him a couple of months\r\nor so; then he would give us a month\'s holiday, and take up another.\r\n\r\nAntony did not think much of Lorrimer in those days, nor Lorrimer of\r\nhim, for all they were such good friends. And neither of them thought\r\nmuch of Little Billee, whose pinnacle (of pure unadulterated fame) is\r\nnow the highest of all--the highest probably that can be for a mere\r\npainter of pictures!\r\n\r\nAnd what is so nice about Lorrimer, now that he is a graybeard, an\r\nacademician, an accomplished man of the world and society, is that he\r\nadmires Antony\'s genius more than he can say--and reads Mr. Rudyard\r\nKipling\'s delightful stories as well as Dante\'s "Inferno"--and can\r\nlisten with delight to the lovely songs of Signor Tosti, who has not\r\nprecisely founded himself on Handel--can even scream with laughter at a\r\ncomic song--even a nigger melody--so, at least, that it but be sung in\r\nwell-bred and distinguished company--for Lorrimer is no bohemian.\r\n\r\n    "Shoo, fly! don\'tcher bother me!\r\n     For I belong to the Comp\'ny G!"\r\n\r\nBoth these famous men are happily (and most beautifully)\r\nmarried--grandfathers, for all I know--and "move in the very best\r\nsociety" (Lorrimer always, I\'m told; Antony now and then); "la haute,"\r\nas it used to be called in French bohemia--meaning dukes and lords and\r\neven royalties, I suppose, and those who love them and whom they love.\r\n\r\nThat _is_ the best society, isn\'t it? At all events, we are assured it\r\nused to be; but that must have been before the present scribe (a meek\r\nand somewhat innocent outsider) had been privileged to see it with his\r\nown little eye.\r\n\r\nAnd when they happen to meet there (Antony and Lorrimer, I mean), I\r\ndon\'t expect they rush very wildly into each other\'s arms, or talk very\r\nfluently about old times. Nor do I suppose their wives are very\r\nintimate. None of our wives are. Not even Taffy\'s and the Laird\'s.\r\n\r\nOh, Orestes! Oh, Pylades!\r\n\r\nOh, ye impecunious, unpinnacled young inseparables of eighteen,\r\nnineteen, twenty, even twenty-five, who share each other\'s thoughts and\r\npurses, and wear each other\'s clothes, and swear each other\'s oaths,\r\nand smoke each other\'s pipes, and respect each other\'s lights o\' love,\r\nand keep each other\'s secrets, and tell each other\'s jokes, and pawn\r\neach other\'s watches and merrymake together on the proceeds, and sit all\r\nnight by each other\'s bedsides in sickness, and comfort each other in\r\nsorrow and disappointment with silent, manly sympathy--"wait till you\r\nget to forty year!"\r\n\r\nWait even till each or either of you gets himself a little pinnacle of\r\nhis own--be it ever so humble!\r\n\r\nNay, wait till either or each of you gets himself a wife!\r\n\r\nHistory goes on repeating itself, and so do novels, and this is a\r\nplatitude, and there\'s nothing new under the sun.\r\n\r\nMay too cecee (as the idiomatic Laird would say, in the language he\r\nadores)--may too cecee ay nee eecee nee l\xc3\xa1h!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there was Dodor, the handsome young dragon de la garde--a full\r\nprivate, if you please, with a beardless face, and damask-rosy cheeks,\r\nand a small waist, and narrow feet like a lady\'s, and who, strange to\r\nsay, spoke English just like an Englishman.\r\n\r\nAnd his friend Gontran, _alias_ l\'Zouzou--a corporal in the Zouaves.\r\n\r\nBoth of these worthies had met Taffy in the Crimea, and frequented the\r\nstudios in the quartier latin, where they adored (and were adored by)\r\nthe grisettes and models, especially Trilby.\r\n\r\nBoth of them were distinguished for being the worst subjects (_les plus\r\nmauvais sujets_) of their respective regiments; yet both were special\r\nfavorites not only with their fellow-rankers, but with those in command,\r\nfrom their colonels downward.\r\n\r\nBoth were in the habit of being promoted to the rank of corporal or\r\nbrigadier, and degraded to the rank of private next day for general\r\nmisconduct, the result of a too exuberant delight in their promotion.\r\n\r\nNeither of them knew fear, envy, malice, temper, or low spirits; ever\r\nsaid or did an ill-natured thing; ever even thought one; ever had an\r\nenemy but himself. Both had the best or the worst manners going,\r\naccording to their company, whose manners they reflected; they were true\r\nchameleons!\r\n\r\nBoth were always ready to share their last ten-sou piece (not that they\r\never seemed to have one) with each other or anybody else, or anybody\r\nelse\'s last ten-sou piece with you; to offer you a friend\'s cigar; to\r\ninvite you to dine with any friend they had; to fight with you, or for\r\nyou, at a moment\'s notice. And they made up for all the anxiety,\r\ntribulation, shame, and sorrow they caused at home by the endless fun\r\nand amusement they gave to all outside.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty dance they led; but our three friends of the Place St.\r\nAnatole (who hadn\'t got to pay the pipers) loved them both, especially\r\nDodor.\r\n\r\nOne fine Sunday afternoon Little Billee found himself studying life and\r\ncharacter in that most delightful and festive scene la F\xc3\xaate de St.\r\nCloud, and met Dodor and l\'Zouzou there, who hailed him with delight,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n"Nous allons joliment jubiler, nom d\'une pipe!" and insisted on his\r\njoining in their amusements and paying for them--roundabouts, swings,\r\nthe giant, the dwarf, the strong man, the fat woman--to whom they made\r\nlove and were taken too seriously, and turned out--the menagerie of wild\r\nbeasts, whom they teased and aggravated till the police had to\r\ninterfere. Also _al fresco_ dances, where their cancan step was of the\r\nwildest and most unbridled character, till a sous-officier or a gendarme\r\ncame in sight, and then they danced quite mincingly and demurely, _en\r\nma\xc3\xaetre d\'\xc3\xa9cole_, as they called it, to the huge delight of an immense\r\nand ever-increasing crowd, and the disgust of all truly respectable men.\r\n\r\nThey also insisted on Little Billee\'s walking between them, arm in arm,\r\nand talking to them in English whenever they saw coming towards them a\r\nrespectable English family with daughters. It was the dragoon\'s delight\r\nto get himself stared at by fair daughters of Albion for speaking as\r\ngood English as themselves--a rare accomplishment in a French\r\ntrooper--and Zouzou\'s happiness to be thought English too, though the\r\nonly English he knew was the phrase "I will not! I will not!" which he\r\nhad picked up in the Crimea, and repeated over and over again when he\r\ncame within ear-shot of a pretty English girl.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee was not happy in these circumstances. He was no snob. But\r\nhe was a respectably brought-up young Briton of the higher middle class,\r\nand it was not quite pleasant for him to be seen (by fair countrywomen\r\nof his own) walking arm in arm on a Sunday afternoon with a couple of\r\nFrench private soldiers, and uncommonly rowdy ones at that.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'I WILL NOT! I WILL NOT!\'"]\r\n\r\nLater, they came back to Paris together on the top of an omnibus,\r\namong a very proletarian crowd, and there the two facetious warriors\r\nimmediately made themselves pleasant all round and became very popular,\r\nespecially with the women and children; but not, I regret to say,\r\nthrough the propriety, refinement, and discretion of their behavior.\r\nLittle Billee resolved that he would not go a-pleasuring with them any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nHowever, they stuck to him through thick and thin, and insisted on\r\nescorting him all the way back to the quartier latin, by the Pont de la\r\nConcorde and the Rue de Lille in the Faubourg St. Germain.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee loved the Faubourg St. Germain, especially the Rue de\r\nLille. He was fond of gazing at the magnificent old mansions, the\r\n"h\xc3\xb4tels" of the old French noblesse, or rather the outside walls\r\nthereof, the grand sculptured portals with the armorial bearings and the\r\nsplendid old historic names above them--H\xc3\xb4tel de This, H\xc3\xb4tel de That,\r\nRohan-Chabot, Montmorency, La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, La Tour\r\nd\'Auvergne.\r\n\r\nHe would forget himself in romantic dreams of past and forgotten French\r\nchivalry which these glorious names called up; for he knew a little of\r\nFrench history, loving to read Froissart and Saint-Simon and the genial\r\nBrant\xc3\xb4me.\r\n\r\nHalting opposite one of the finest and oldest of all these gateways, his\r\nespecial favorite, labelled "H\xc3\xb4tel de la Rochemartel" in letters of\r\nfaded gold over a ducal coronet and a huge escutcheon of stone, he began\r\nto descant upon its architectural beauties and noble proportions to\r\nl\'Zouzou.\r\n\r\n"_Parbleu!_" said l\'Zouzou, "_connu_, _farceur!_ why, I was _born_\r\nthere, on the 6th of March, 1834, at 5.30 in the morning. Lucky day for\r\nFrance--_hein_?"\r\n\r\n"Born there? what do you mean--in the porter\'s lodge?"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the two great gates rolled back, a liveried Suisse\r\nappeared, and an open carriage and pair came out, and in it were two\r\nelderly ladies and a younger one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DODOR IN HIS GLORY]\r\n\r\nTo Little Billee\'s indignation, the two incorrigible warriors made the\r\nmilitary salute, and the three ladies bowed stiffly and gravely.\r\n\r\nAnd then (to Little Billee\'s horror this time) one of them happened to\r\nlook back, and Zouzou actually kissed his hand to her.\r\n\r\n"Do you _know_ that lady?" asked Little Billee, very sternly.\r\n\r\n"_Parbleu! si je la connais!_ Why, it\'s my mother! Isn\'t she nice? She\'s\r\nrather cross with me just now."\r\n\r\n"Your _mother_! Why, what do you mean? What on earth would your mother\r\nbe doing in that big carriage and at that big house?"\r\n\r\n"_Parbleu, farceur!_ She lives there!"\r\n\r\n"_Lives_ there! Why, who and what is she, your mother?"\r\n\r\n"The Duchesse de la Rochemartel, _parbleu!_ and that\'s my sister; and\r\nthat\'s my aunt, Princess de Chevagn\xc3\xa9-Bauffremont! She\'s the \'_patronne_\'\r\nof that _chic_ equipage. She\'s a millionaire, my aunt Chevagn\xc3\xa9!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I never! What\'s _your_ name, then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, _my_ name! Hang it--let me see!\r\nWell--Gontran-Xavier--Fran\xc3\xa7ois--Marie--Joseph d\'Amaury--Brissac de\r\nRoncesvaulx de la Rochemartel-Boiss\xc3\xa9gur, at your service!"\r\n\r\n"Quite correct!" said Dodor; "_l\'enfant dit vrai!_"\r\n\r\n"Well--I--never! And what\'s _your_ name, Dodor?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I\'m only a humble individual, and answer to the one-horse name of\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore Rigolot de Lafarce. But Zouzou\'s an awful swell, you know--his\r\nbrother\'s the Duke!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H\xc3\x94TEL DE LA ROCHEMARTEL]\r\n\r\nLittle Billee was no snob. But he was a respectably brought-up young\r\nBriton of the higher middle class, and these revelations, which he could\r\nnot but believe, astounded him so that he could hardly speak. Much as he\r\nflattered himself that he scorned the bloated aristocracy, titles are\r\ntitles--even French titles!--and when it comes to dukes and princesses\r\nwho live in houses like the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Rochemartel ...!\r\n\r\nIt\'s enough to take a respectably brought-up young Briton\'s breath away!\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Taffy that evening, he exclaimed: "I say, Zouzou\'s mother\'s\r\na duchess!"\r\n\r\n"Yes--the Duchesse de la Rochemartel-Boiss\xc3\xa9gur."\r\n\r\n"You never told me!"\r\n\r\n"You never asked me. It\'s one of the greatest names in France. They\'re\r\nvery poor, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Poor! You should see the house they live in!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been there, to dinner; and the dinner wasn\'t very good. They let a\r\ngreat part of it, and live mostly in the country. The Duke is Zouzou\'s\r\nbrother; very unlike Zouzou; he\'s consumptive and unmarried, and the\r\nmost respectable man in Paris. Zouzou will be the Duke some day."\r\n\r\n"And Dodor--he\'s a swell, too, I suppose--he says he\'s _de_ something or\r\nother!"\r\n\r\n"Yes--Rigolot de Lafarce. I\'ve no doubt he descends from the Crusaders,\r\ntoo; the name seems to favor it, anyhow; and such lots of them do in\r\nthis country. His mother was English, and bore the worthy name of Brown.\r\nHe was at school in England; that\'s why he speaks English so well--and\r\nbehaves so badly, perhaps! He\'s got a very beautiful sister, married to\r\na man in the 60th Rifles--Jack Reeve, a son of Lord Reevely\'s; a selfish\r\nsort of chap. I don\'t suppose he gets on very well with his\r\nbrother-in-law. Poor Dodor! His sister\'s about the only living thing he\r\ncares for--except Zouzou."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wonder if the bland and genial Monsieur Th\xc3\xa9odore--"notre Sieur\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore"--now junior partner in the great haberdashery firm of\r\n"Passefil et Rigolot," on the Boulevard des Capucines, and a pillar of\r\nthe English chapel in the Rue Marb\xc5\x93uf, is very hard on his employ\xc3\xa9s\r\nand employ\xc3\xa9es if they are a little late at their counters on a Monday\r\nmorning?\r\n\r\nI wonder if that stuck-up, stingy, stodgy, communard-shooting,\r\nchurch-going, time-serving, place-hunting, pious-eyed, pompous old prig,\r\nmartinet, and philistine, Monsieur le Mar\xc3\xa9chal-Duc de la\r\nRochemartel-Boiss\xc3\xa9gur, ever tells Madame la Mar\xc3\xa9chale-Duchesse (_n\xc3\xa9e_\r\nHunks, of Chicago) how once upon a time Dodor and he--\r\n\r\nWe will tell no tales out of school.\r\n\r\nThe present scribe is no snob. He is a respectably brought-up old Briton\r\nof the higher middle-class--at least, he flatters himself so. And he\r\nwrites for just such old philistines as himself, who date from a time\r\nwhen titles were not thought so cheap as to-day. Alas! all reverence for\r\nall that is high and time-honored and beautiful seems at a discount.\r\n\r\nSo he has kept his blackguard ducal Zouave for the bouquet of this\r\nlittle show--the final _bonne bouche_ in his bohemian _menu_--that he\r\nmay make it palatable to those who only look upon the good old quartier\r\nlatin (now no more to speak of) as a very low, common, vulgar quarter\r\nindeed, deservedly swept away, where misters the students (shocking\r\nbounders and cads) had nothing better to do, day and night, than mount\r\nup to a horrid place called the thatched house--_la chaumi\xc3\xa8re_--\r\n\r\n     "Pour y danser le cancan\r\n      Ou le Robert Macaire--\r\n      Toujours--toujours--toujours--\r\n      La nuit comme le jour ...\r\n      Et youp! youp! youp!\r\n    Tra la la la la ... la la la!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChristmas was drawing near.\r\n\r\nThere were days when the whole quartier latin would veil its iniquities\r\nunder fogs almost worthy of the Thames Valley between London Bridge and\r\nWestminster, and out of the studio window the prospect was a dreary\r\nblank. No morgue! no towers of Notre Dame! not even the chimney-pots\r\nover the way--not even the little medi\xc3\xa6val toy turret at the corner of\r\nthe Rue Vieille des Mauvais Ladres, Little Billee\'s delight!\r\n\r\nThe stove had to be crammed till its sides grew a dull deep red before\r\none\'s fingers could hold a brush or squeeze a bladder; one had to box or\r\nfence at nine in the morning, that one might recover from the cold bath,\r\nand get warm for the rest of the day!\r\n\r\nTaffy and the Laird grew pensive and dreamy, childlike and bland; and\r\nwhen they talked it was generally about Christmas at home in merry\r\nEngland and the distant land of cakes, and how good it was to be there\r\nat such a time--hunting, shooting, curling, and endless carouse!\r\n\r\nIt was Ho! for the jolly West Riding, and Hey! for the bonnets of Bonnie\r\nDundee, till they grew quite homesick, and wanted to start by the very\r\nnext train.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t do anything so foolish. They wrote over to friends in London\r\nfor the biggest turkey, the biggest plum-pudding, that could be got for\r\nlove or money, with mince-pies, and holly and mistletoe, and sturdy,\r\nshort, thick English sausages, half a Stilton cheese, and a sirloin of\r\nbeef--two sirloins, in case one should not be enough.\r\n\r\nFor they meant to have a Homeric feast in the studio on Christmas\r\nDay--Taffy, the Laird, and Little Billee--and invite all the delightful\r\nchums I have been trying to describe; and that is just why I tried to\r\ndescribe them--Durien, Vincent, Antony, Lorrimer, Carnegie,\r\nPetrolicoconose, l\'Zouzou, and Dodor!\r\n\r\nThe cooking and waiting should be done by Trilby, her friend Ang\xc3\xa8le\r\nBoisse, M. et Mme. Vinard, and such little Vinards as could be trusted\r\nwith glass and crockery and mince-pies; and if that was not enough, they\r\nwould also cook themselves and wait upon each other.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner should be over, supper was to follow with scarcely any\r\ninterval to speak of; and to partake of this other guests should be\r\nbidden--Svengali and Gecko, and perhaps one or two more. No ladies!\r\n\r\nFor, as the unsusceptible Laird expressed it, in the language of a\r\ngillie he had once met at a servants\' dance in a Highland country-house,\r\n"Them wimmen spiles the ball!"\r\n\r\nElaborate cards of invitation were sent out, in the designing and\r\nornamentation of which the Laird and Taffy exhausted all their fancy\r\n(Little Billee had no time).\r\n\r\nWines and spirits and English beers were procured at great cost from M.\r\nE. Delevingne\'s, in the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9, and liqueurs of every\r\ndescription--chartreuse, cura\xc3\xa7oa, ratafia de cassis, and anisette; no\r\nexpense was spared.\r\n\r\nAlso, truffled galantines of turkey, tongues, hams, rillettes de Tours,\r\np\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9s de foie gras, "fromage d\'Italie" (which has nothing to do with\r\ncheese), saucissons d\'Arles et de Lyon, with and without garlic, cold\r\njellies peppery and salt--everything that French charcutiers and their\r\nwives can make out of French pigs, or any other animal whatever, beast,\r\nbird, or fowl (even cats and rats), for the supper; and sweet jellies,\r\nand cakes, and sweetmeats, and confections of all kinds, from the famous\r\npastry-cook at the corner of the Rue Castiglione.\r\n\r\nMouths went watering all day long in joyful anticipation. They water\r\nsomewhat sadly now at the mere remembrance of these delicious\r\nthings--the mere immediate sight or scent of which in these degenerate\r\nlatter days would no longer avail to promote any such delectable\r\nsecretion. H\xc3\xa9las! ahim\xc3\xa8! ach weh! ay de mi! eheu! \xce\xbf\xe1\xbc\xb1\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xce\xb9--in\r\npoint of fact, _alas_!\r\n\r\nThat is the very exclamation I wanted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTMAS EVE]\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve came round. The pieces of resistance and plum-pudding\r\nand mince-pies had not yet arrived from London--but there was plenty of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLes trois Angliches dined at le p\xc3\xa8re Trin\'s, as usual, and played\r\nbilliards and dominos at the Caf\xc3\xa9 du Luxembourg, and possessed their\r\nsouls in patience till it was time to go and hear the midnight mass at\r\nthe Madeleine, where Roucouly, the great barytone of the Op\xc3\xa9ra Comique,\r\nwas retained to sing Adam\'s famous No\xc3\xabl.\r\n\r\nThe whole quartier seemed alive with the r\xc3\xa9veillon. It was a clear,\r\nfrosty night, with a splendid moon just past the full, and most\r\nexhilarating was the walk along the quays on the Rive Gauche, over the\r\nPont de la Concorde and across the Place thereof, and up the thronged\r\nRue de la Madeleine to the massive Parthenaic place of worship that\r\nalways has such a pagan, worldly look of smug and prosperous modernity.\r\n\r\nThey struggled manfully, and found standing and kneeling room among that\r\nfervent crowd, and heard the impressive service with mixed feelings, as\r\nbecame true Britons of very advanced liberal and religious opinions; not\r\nwith the unmixed contempt of the proper British Orthodox (who were there\r\nin full force, one may be sure).\r\n\r\nBut their susceptible hearts soon melted at the beautiful music, and in\r\nmere sensuous _attendrissement_ they were quickly in unison with all the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nFor as the clock struck twelve out pealed the organ, and up rose the\r\nfinest voice in France:\r\n\r\n    "Minuit, Chr\xc3\xa9tiens! c\'est l\'heure solennelle\r\n     O\xc3\xb9 l\'Homme-Dieu descendit parmi nous!"\r\n\r\nAnd a wave of religious emotion rolled over Little Billee and submerged\r\nhim; swept him off his little legs, swept him out of his little self,\r\ndrowned him in a great seething surge of love--love of his kind, love of\r\nlove, love of life, love of death, love of all that is and ever was and\r\never will be--a very large order indeed, even for Little Billee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'ALLONS GLYC\xc3\x88RE! ROUGIS MON VERRE....\'"]\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to him that he stretched out his arms for love to one\r\nfigure especially beloved beyond all the rest--one figure erect on high\r\nwith arms outstretched to him, in more than common fellowship of need;\r\nnot the sorrowful figure crowned with thorns, for it was in the likeness\r\nof a woman; but never that of the Virgin Mother of Our Lord.\r\n\r\nIt was Trilby, Trilby, Trilby! a poor fallen sinner and waif all but\r\nlost amid the scum of the most corrupt city on earth. Trilby weak and\r\nmortal like himself, and in woful want of pardon! and in her gray\r\ndovelike eyes he saw the shining of so great a love that he was abashed;\r\nfor well he knew that all that love was his, and would be his forever,\r\ncome what would or could.\r\n\r\n    "Peuple, debout! Chante ta d\xc3\xa9livrance!\r\n     _No\xc3\xabl! No\xc3\xabl! Voici le R\xc3\xa9dempteur!_"\r\n\r\nSo sang and rang and pealed and echoed the big, deep, metallic barytone\r\nbass--above the organ, above the incense, above everything else in the\r\nworld--till the very universe seemed to shake with the rolling thunder\r\nof that great message of love and forgiveness!\r\n\r\nThus at least felt Little Billee, whose way it was to magnify and\r\nexaggerate all things under the subtle stimulus of sound, and the\r\nsinging human voice had especially strange power to penetrate into his\r\ninmost depths--even the voice of man!\r\n\r\nAnd what voice but the deepest and gravest and grandest there is can\r\ngive worthy utterance to such a message as that, the epitome, the\r\nabstract, the very essence of all collective humanity\'s wisdom at its\r\nbest!\r\n\r\nLittle Billee reached the H\xc3\xb4tel Corneille that night in a very exalted\r\nframe of mind indeed, the loftiest, lowliest mood of all.\r\n\r\nNow see what sport we are of trivial, base, ignoble earthly things!\r\n\r\nSitting on the door-step and smoking two cigars at once he found Ribot,\r\none of his fellow-lodgers, whose room was just under his own. Ribot was\r\nso tipsy that he could not ring. But he could still sing, and did so at\r\nthe top of his voice. It was not the No\xc3\xabl of Adam that he sang. He had\r\nnot spent his r\xc3\xa9veillon in any church.\r\n\r\nWith the help of a sleepy waiter, Little Billee got the bacchanalian\r\ninto his room and lit his candle for him, and, disengaging himself from\r\nhis maudlin embraces, left him to wallow in solitude.\r\n\r\nAs he lay awake in his bed, trying to recall the deep and high emotions\r\nof the evening, he heard the tipsy hog below tumbling about his room and\r\nstill trying to sing his senseless ditty:\r\n\r\n                          "Allons, Glyc\xc3\xa8re!\r\n                          Rougis mon verre\r\n    Du jus divin dont mon c\xc5\x93ur est toujours jaloux ...\r\n                          Et puis \xc3\xa0 table,\r\n                          Bacchante aimable!\r\n    Enivrons-nous (hic) Les g-glougloux sont des rendezvous!"...\r\n\r\nThen the song ceased for a while, and soon there were other sounds, as\r\non a Channel steamer. Glougloux indeed!\r\n\r\nThen the fear arose in Little Billee\'s mind lest the drunken beast\r\nshould set fire to his bedroom curtains. All heavenly visions were\r\nchased away for the night....\r\n\r\nOur hero, half-crazed with fear, disgust, and irritation, lay wide\r\nawake, his nostrils on the watch for the smell of burning chintz or\r\nmuslin, and wondered how an educated man--for Ribot was a\r\nlaw-student--could ever make such a filthy beast of himself as that! It\r\nwas a scandal--a disgrace; it was not to be borne; there should be no\r\nforgiveness for such as Ribot--not even on Christmas Day! He would\r\ncomplain to Madame Paul, the patronne; he would have Ribot turned out\r\ninto the street; he would leave the hotel himself the very next morning!\r\nAt last he fell asleep, thinking of all he would do; and thus,\r\nridiculously and ignominiously for Little Billee, ended the r\xc3\xa9veillon.\r\n\r\nNext morning he complained to Madame Paul; and though he did not give\r\nher warning, nor even insist on the expulsion of Ribot (who, as he heard\r\nwith a hard heart, was "bien malade ce matin"), he expressed himself\r\nvery severely on the conduct of that gentleman, and on the dangers from\r\nfire that might arise from a tipsy man being trusted alone in a small\r\nbedroom with chintz curtains and a lighted candle. If it hadn\'t been for\r\nhimself, he told her, Ribot would have slept on the door-step, and serve\r\nhim right! He was really grand in his virtuous indignation, in spite of\r\nhis imperfect French; and Madame Paul was deeply contrite for her\r\npeccant lodger, and profuse in her apologies; and Little Billee began\r\nhis twenty-first Christmas Day like a Pharisee, thanking his star that\r\nhe was not as Ribot!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Fourth\r\n\r\n                "F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9 pass\xc3\xa9e\r\n                 Qui ne peux revenir,\r\n                 Tourment de ma pens\xc3\xa9e,\r\n    Que n\'ay-je, en te perdant, perdu le souvenir!"\r\n\r\n\r\nMid-day had struck. The expected hamper had not turned up in the Place\r\nSt. Anatole des Arts.\r\n\r\nAll Madame Vinard\'s kitchen battery was in readiness; Trilby and Madame\r\nAng\xc3\xa8le Boisse were in the studio, their sleeves turned up, and ready to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nAt twelve the trois Angliches and the two fair blanchisseuses sat down\r\nto lunch in a very anxious frame of mind, and finished a p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 de foie\r\ngras and two bottles of Burgundy between them, such was their\r\ndisquietude.\r\n\r\nThe guests had been invited for six o\'clock.\r\n\r\nMost elaborately they laid the cloth on the table they had borrowed from\r\nthe H\xc3\xb4tel de Seine, and settled who was to sit next to whom, and then\r\nunsettled it, and quarrelled over it--Trilby, as was her wont in such\r\nmatters, assuming an authority that did not rightly belong to her, and\r\nof course getting her own way in the end.\r\n\r\nAnd that, as the Laird remarked, was her confounded Trilbyness.\r\n\r\nTwo o\'clock--three--four--but no hamper! Darkness had almost set in. It\r\nwas simply maddening. They knelt on the divan, with their elbows on the\r\nwindow-sill, and watched the street lamps popping into life along the\r\nquays--and looked out through the gathering dusk for the van from the\r\nChemin de Fer du Nord--and gloomily thought of the Morgue, which they\r\ncould still make out across the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUVENIR]\r\n\r\nAt length the Laird and Trilby went off in a cab to the station--a long\r\ndrive--and, lo! before they came back the long-expected hamper arrived,\r\nat six o\'clock.\r\n\r\nAnd with it Durien, Vincent, Antony, Lorrimer, Carnegie,\r\nPetrolicoconose, Dodor, and l\'Zouzou--the last two in uniform, as usual.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly the studio, which had been so silent, dark, and dull, with\r\nTaffy and Little Billee sitting hopeless and despondent round the\r\nstove, became a scene of the noisiest, busiest, and cheerfulest\r\nanimation. The three big lamps were lit, and all the Chinese lanterns.\r\nThe pieces of resistance and the pudding were whisked off by Trilby,\r\nAng\xc3\xa8le, and Madame Vinard to other regions--the porter\'s lodge and\r\nDurien\'s studio (which had been lent for the purpose); and every one was\r\npressed into the preparations for the banquet. There was plenty for idle\r\nhands to do. Sausages to be fried for the turkey, stuffing made, and\r\nsauces, salads mixed, and punch--holly hung in festoons all round and\r\nabout--a thousand things. Everybody was so clever and good-humored that\r\nnobody got in anybody\'s way--not even Carnegie, who was in evening dress\r\n(to the Laird\'s delight). So they made him do the scullion\'s\r\nwork--cleaning, rinsing, peeling, etc.\r\n\r\nThe cooking of the dinner was almost better fun than the eating of it.\r\nAnd though there were so many cooks, not even the broth was spoiled\r\n(cockaleekie, from a receipt of the Laird\'s).\r\n\r\nIt was ten o\'clock before they sat down to that most memorable repast.\r\n\r\nZouzou and Dodor, who had been the most useful and energetic of all its\r\ncooks, apparently quite forgot they were due at their respective\r\nbarracks at that very moment: they had only been able to obtain "la\r\npermission de dix heures." If they remembered it, the certainty that\r\nnext day Zouzou would be reduced to the ranks for the fifth time, and\r\nDodor confined to his barracks for a month, did not trouble them in the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nThe waiting was as good as the cooking. The handsome, quick,\r\nauthoritative Madame Vinard was in a dozen places at once, and openly\r\nprompted, rebuked, and ballyragged her husband into a proper smartness.\r\nThe pretty little Madame Ang\xc3\xa8le moved about as deftly and as quietly as\r\na mouse; which of course did not prevent them both from genially joining\r\nin the general conversation whenever it wandered into French.\r\n\r\nTrilby, tall, graceful, and stately, and also swift of action, though\r\nmore like Juno or Diana than Hebe, devoted herself more especially to\r\nher own particular favorites--Durien, Taffy, the Laird, Little\r\nBillee--and Dodor and Zouzou, whom she loved, and tutoy\xc3\xa9\'d en bonne\r\ncamarade as she served them with all there was of the choicest.\r\n\r\nThe two little Vinards did their little best--they scrupulously\r\nrespected the mince-pies, and only broke two bottles of oil and one of\r\nHarvey sauce, which made their mother furious. To console them, the\r\nLaird took one of them on each knee and gave them of his share of\r\nplum-pudding and many other unaccustomed good things, so bad for their\r\nlittle French tumtums.\r\n\r\nThe genteel Carnegie had never been at such a queer scene in his life.\r\nIt opened his mind--and Dodor and Zouzou, between whom he sat (the Laird\r\nthought it would do him good to sit between a private soldier and a\r\nhumble corporal), taught him more French than he had learned during the\r\nthree months he had spent in Paris. It was a specialty of theirs. It was\r\nmore colloquial than what is generally used in diplomatic circles, and\r\nstuck longer in the memory; but it hasn\'t interfered with his preferment\r\nin the Church.\r\n\r\nHe quite unbent. He was the first to volunteer a song (without being\r\nasked) when the pipes and cigars were lit, and after the usual toasts\r\nhad been drunk--her Majesty\'s health, Tennyson, Thackeray, and Dickens;\r\nand John Leech.\r\n\r\nHe sang, with a very cracked and rather hiccupy voice, his only song (it\r\nseems)--an English one, of which the burden, he explained, was French:\r\n\r\n    "Veeverler veeverler veeverler vee\r\n          Veeverler companyee!"\r\n\r\nAnd Zouzou and Dodor complimented him so profusely on his French accent\r\nthat he was with difficulty prevented from singing it all over again.\r\n\r\nThen everybody sang in rotation.\r\n\r\nThe Laird, with a capital barytone, sang\r\n\r\n    "Hie diddle Dee for the Lowlands low,"\r\n\r\nwhich was encored.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee sang "Little Billee."\r\n\r\nVincent sang\r\n\r\n      "Old Joe kicking up behind and afore.\r\n    And the yaller gal a-kicking up behind old Joe."\r\n\r\nA capital song, with words of quite a masterly scansion.\r\n\r\nAntony sang "Le Sire de Framboisy." Enthusiastic encore.\r\n\r\nLorrimer, inspired no doubt by the occasion, sang the "Hallelujah\r\nChorus," and accompanied himself on the piano, but failed to obtain an\r\nencore.\r\n\r\nDurien sang\r\n\r\n    "Plaisir d\'amour ne dure qu\'un moment;\r\n     Chagrin d\'amour dure toute la vie...."\r\n\r\nIt was his favorite song, and one of the beautiful songs of the world,\r\nand he sang it very well--and it became popular in the quartier latin\r\never after.\r\n\r\nThe Greek couldn\'t sing, and very wisely didn\'t.\r\n\r\nZouzou sang capitally a capital song in praise of "le vin \xc3\xa0 quat\' sous!"\r\n\r\nTaffy, in a voice like a high wind (and with a very good imitation of\r\nthe Yorkshire brogue), sang a Somersetshire hunting-ditty, ending:\r\n\r\n    "Of this \'ere song should I be axed the reason for to show,\r\n     I don\'t exactly know, I don\'t exactly know!\r\n     But all my fancy dwells upon Nancy,\r\n                 And I sing Tally-ho!"\r\n\r\nIt is a quite superexcellent ditty, and haunts my memory to this day;\r\nand one felt sure that Nancy was a dear and a sweet, wherever she lived,\r\nand when. So Taffy was encored twice--once for her sake, once for his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "MY SISTER DEAR"]\r\n\r\nAnd finally, to the surprise of all, the bold dragoon sang (in English)\r\n"My Sister Dear," out of _Masaniello_, with such pathos, and in a voice\r\nso sweet and high and well in tune, that his audience felt almost weepy\r\nin the midst of their jollification, and grew quite sentimental, as\r\nEnglishmen abroad are apt to do when they are rather tipsy and hear\r\npretty music, and think of their dear sisters across the sea, or their\r\nfriends\' dear sisters.\r\n\r\nMadame Vinard interrupted her Christmas dinner on the model-throne to\r\nlisten, and wept and wiped her eyes quite openly, and remarked to Madame\r\nBoisse, who stood modestly close by: "Il est gentil tout plein, ce\r\ndragon! Mon Dieu! comme il chante bien! Il est Angliche aussi, il\r\npara\xc3\xaet. Ils sont joliment bien \xc3\xa9lev\xc3\xa9s, tous ces Angliches--tous plus\r\ngentils les uns que les autres! et quant \xc3\xa0 Monsieur Litrebili, on lui\r\ndonnerait le bon Dieu sans confession!"\r\n\r\nAnd Madame Boisse agreed.\r\n\r\nThen Svengali and Gecko came, and the table had to be laid and decorated\r\nanew, for it was supper-time.\r\n\r\nSupper was even jollier than dinner, which had taken off the keen edge\r\nof the appetites, so that every one talked at once--the true test of a\r\nsuccessful supper--except when Antony told some of his experiences of\r\nbohemia; for instance, how, after staying at home all day for a month to\r\navoid his creditors, he became reckless one Sunday morning, and went to\r\nthe Bains Deligny, and jumped into a deep part by mistake, and was saved\r\nfrom a watery grave by a bold swimmer, who turned out to be his\r\nboot-maker, Satory, to whom he owed sixty francs--of all his duns the\r\none he dreaded the most--and who didn\'t let him go in a hurry.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Svengali remarked that he also owed sixty francs to\r\nSatory--"Mais comme che ne me baigne chamais, che n\'ai rien \xc3\xa0\r\ncraindre!"\r\n\r\nWhereupon there was such a laugh that Svengali felt he had scored off\r\nAntony at last and had a prettier wit. He flattered himself that he\'d\r\ngot the laugh of Antony _this_ time.\r\n\r\nAnd after supper Svengali and Gecko made such lovely music that\r\neverybody was sobered and athirst again, and the punch-bowl, wreathed\r\nwith holly and mistletoe, was placed in the middle of the table, and\r\nclean glasses set all round it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DUCAL FRENCH FIGHTING-COCK]\r\n\r\nThen Dodor and l\'Zouzou stood up to dance with Trilby and Madame Ang\xc3\xa8le,\r\nand executed a series of cancan steps, which, though they were so\r\ninimitably droll that they had each and all to be encored, were such\r\nthat not one of them need have brought the blush of shame to the cheek\r\nof modesty.\r\n\r\nThen the Laird danced a sword-dance over two T squares and broke them\r\nboth. And Taffy, baring his mighty arms to the admiring gaze of all, did\r\ndumb-bell exercises, with Little Billee for a dumb-bell, and all but\r\ndropped him into the punch-bowl; and tried to cut a pewter ladle in two\r\nwith Dodor\'s sabre, and sent it through the window; and this made him\r\ncross, so that he abused French sabres, and said they were made of worse\r\npewter than even French ladles; and the Laird sententiously opined that\r\nthey managed these things better in England, and winked at Little\r\nBillee.\r\n\r\nThen they played at "cock-fighting," with their wrists tied across their\r\nshins, and a broomstick thrust in between; thus manacled, you are placed\r\nopposite your antagonist, and try to upset him with your feet, and he\r\nyou. It is a very good game. The cuirassier and the Zouave playing at\r\nthis got so angry, and were so irresistibly funny a sight, that the\r\nshouts of laughter could be heard on the other side of the river, so\r\nthat a sergent de ville came in and civilly requested them not to make\r\nso much noise. They were disturbing the whole quartier, he said, and\r\nthere was quite a "rassemblement" outside. So they made him tipsy, and\r\nalso another policeman, who came to look after his comrade, and yet\r\nanother; and these guardians of the peace of Paris were trussed and made\r\nto play at cock-fighting, and were still funnier than the two soldiers,\r\nand laughed louder and made more noise than any one else, so that Madame\r\nVinard had to remonstrate with them; till they got too tipsy to speak,\r\nand fell fast asleep, and were laid next to each other behind the\r\nstove.\r\n\r\nThe _fin de si\xc3\xa8cle_ reader, disgusted at the thought of such an orgy as\r\nI have been trying to describe, must remember that it happened in the\r\nfifties, when men calling themselves gentlemen, and being called so,\r\nstill wrenched off door-knockers and came back drunk from the Derby, and\r\neven drank too much after dinner before joining the ladies, as is all\r\nduly chronicled and set down in John Leech\'s immortal pictures of life\r\nand character out of _Punch_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen M. and Mme. Vinard and Trilby and Ang\xc3\xa8le Boisse bade the company\r\ngood-night, Trilby being the last of them to leave.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee took her to the top of the staircase, and there he said to\r\nher:\r\n\r\n"Trilby, I have asked you nineteen times, and you have refused. Trilby,\r\nonce more, on Christmas night, for the twentieth time--_will_ you marry\r\nme? If not, I leave Paris to-morrow morning, and never come back. I\r\nswear it on my word of honor!"\r\n\r\nTrilby turned very pale, and leaned her back against the wall, and\r\ncovered her face with her hands.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee pulled them away.\r\n\r\n"Answer me, Trilby!"\r\n\r\n"God forgive me, _yes!_" said Trilby, and she ran down-stairs, weeping.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was now very late.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that Little Billee was in extraordinary high\r\nspirits--in an abnormal state of excitement.\r\n\r\nHe challenged Svengali to spar, and made his nose bleed, and frightened\r\nhim out of his sardonic wits. He performed wonderful and quite\r\nunsuspected feats of strength. He swore eternal friendship to Dodor and\r\nZouzou, and filled their glasses again and again, and also (in his\r\ninnocence) his own, and trinqu\xc3\xa9d with them many times running. They were\r\nthe last to leave (except the three helpless policemen); and at about\r\nfive or six in the morning, to his surprise, he found himself walking\r\nbetween Dodor and Zouzou by a late windy moonlight in the Rue Vieille\r\ndes Mauvais Ladres, now on one side of the frozen gutter, now on the\r\nother, now in the middle of it, stopping them now and then to tell them\r\nhow jolly they were and how dearly he loved them.\r\n\r\nPresently his hat flew away, and went rolling and skipping and bounding\r\nup the narrow street, and they discovered that as soon as they let each\r\nother go to run after it, they all three sat down.\r\n\r\nSo Dodor and Little Billee remained sitting, with their arms round each\r\nother\'s necks and their feet in the gutter, while Zouzou went after the\r\nhat on all fours, and caught it, and brought it back in his mouth like a\r\ntipsy retriever. Little Billee wept for sheer love and gratitude, and\r\ncalled him a cary_hat_ide (in English), and laughed loudly at his own\r\nwit, which was quite thrown away on Zouzou! "No man ever _had_ such\r\ndear, dear frenge! no man ever _was_ s\'happy!"\r\n\r\nAfter sitting for a while in love and amity, they managed to get up on\r\ntheir feet again, each helping the other; and in some never-to-be-remembered\r\nway they reached the H\xc3\xb4tel Corneille.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'ANSWER ME, TRILBY!\'"]\r\n\r\nThere they sat little Billee on the door-step and rang the bell, and\r\nseeing some one coming up the Place de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on, and fearing he might be\r\na sergent de ville, they bid Little Billee a most affectionate but hasty\r\nfarewell, kissing him on both cheeks in French fashion, and contriving\r\nto get themselves round the corner and out of sight.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee tried to sing Zouzou\'s drinking-song:\r\n\r\n                  "Quoi de plus doux\r\n                   Que les glougloux--\r\n    Les glougloux du vin \xc3\xa0 quat\' sous...."\r\n\r\nThe stranger came up. Fortunately, it was no sergent de ville, but\r\nRibot, just back from a Christmas-tree and a little family dance at his\r\naunt\'s, Madame Kolb (the Alsacian banker\'s wife, in the Rue de la\r\nChauss\xc3\xa9e d\'Antin).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CARY_HAT_IDE]\r\n\r\nNext morning poor Little Billee was dreadfully ill.\r\n\r\nHe had passed a terrible night. His bed had heaved like the ocean, with\r\noceanic results. He had forgotten to put out his candle, but fortunately\r\nRibot had blown it out for him, after putting him to bed and tucking him\r\nup like a real good Samaritan.\r\n\r\nAnd next morning, when Madame Paul brought him a cup of tisane de\r\nchiendent (which does not happen to mean a hair of the dog that bit\r\nhim), she was kind, but very severe on the dangers and disgrace of\r\nintoxication, and talked to him like a mother.\r\n\r\n"If it had not been for kind Monsieur Ribot" (she told him), "the\r\ndoor-step would have been your portion; and who could say you didn\'t\r\ndeserve it? And then think of the dangers of fire from a tipsy man all\r\nalone in a small bedroom with chintz curtains and a lighted candle!"\r\n\r\n"Ribot was kind enough to blow out my candle," said Little Billee,\r\nhumbly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Dame!" said Madame Paul, with much meaning--"au moins il a _bon\r\nc\xc5\x93ur_, Monsieur Ribot!"\r\n\r\nAnd the crulest sting of all was when the good-natured and incorrigibly\r\nfestive Ribot came and sat by his bedside, and was kind and tenderly\r\nsympathetic, and got him a pick-me-up from the chemist\'s (unbeknown to\r\nMadame Paul).\r\n\r\n"Credieu! vous vous \xc3\xaates cr\xc3\xa2nement bien amus\xc3\xa9, hier soir! quelle bosse,\r\nhein! je parie que c\'\xc3\xa9tait plus dr\xc3\xb4le que chez ma tante Kolb!"\r\n\r\nAll of which, of course, it is unnecessary to translate; except,\r\nperhaps, the word "bosse," which stands for "noce," which stands for a\r\n"jolly good spree."\r\n\r\nIn all his innocent little life Little Billee had never dreamed of such\r\nhumiliation as this--such ignominious depths of shame and misery and\r\nremorse! He did not care to live. He had but one longing: that Trilby,\r\ndear Trilby, kind Trilby, would come and pillow his head on her\r\nbeautiful white English bosom, and lay her soft, cool, tender hand on\r\nhis aching brow, and there let him go to sleep, and sleeping, die!\r\n\r\nHe slept and slept, with no better rest for his aching brow than the\r\npillow of his bed in the H\xc3\xb4tel Corneille, and failed to die this time.\r\nAnd when, after some forty-eight hours or so, he had quite slept off the\r\nfumes of that memorable Christmas debauch, he found that a sad thing had\r\nhappened to him, and a strange!\r\n\r\nIt was as though a tarnishing breath had swept over the reminiscent\r\nmirror of his mind and left a little film behind it, so that no past\r\nthing he wished to see therein was reflected with quite the old pristine\r\nclearness. As though the keen, quick, razorlike edge of his power to\r\nreach and re-evoke the by-gone charm and glamour and essence of things\r\nhad been blunted and coarsened. As though the bloom of that special joy,\r\nthe gift he unconsciously had of recalling past emotions and sensations\r\nand situations, and making them actual once more by a mere effort of the\r\nwill, had been brushed away.\r\n\r\nAnd he never recovered the full use of that most precious faculty, the\r\nboon of youth and happy childhood, and which he had once possessed,\r\nwithout knowing it, in such singular and exceptional completeness. He\r\nwas to lose other precious faculties of his over-rich and complex\r\nnature--to be pruned and clipped and thinned--that his one supreme\r\nfaculty of painting might have elbow-room to reach its fullest, or else\r\nyou would never have seen the wood for the trees (or _vice versa_--which\r\nis it?).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'LES GLOUGLOUX DU VIN \xc3\x80 QUAT\' SOUS....\'"]\r\n\r\nOn New-year\'s Day Taffy and the Laird were at their work in the studio,\r\nwhen there was a knock at the door, and Monsieur Vinard, cap in hand,\r\nrespectfully introduced a pair of visitors, an English lady and\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was a clergyman, small, thin, round-shouldered, with a\r\nlong neck; weak-eyed and dryly polite. The lady was middle-aged, though\r\nstill young looking; very pretty, with gray hair; very well dressed;\r\nvery small, full of nervous energy, with tiny hands and feet. It was\r\nLittle Billee\'s mother; and the clergyman, the Rev. Thomas Bagot, was\r\nher brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nTheir faces were full of trouble--so much so that the two painters did\r\nnot even apologize for the carelessness of their attire, or for the odor\r\nof tobacco that filled the room. Little Billee\'s mother recognized the\r\ntwo painters at a glance, from the sketches and descriptions of which\r\nher son\'s letters were always full.\r\n\r\nThey all sat down.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s embarrassed silence, Mrs. Bagot exclaimed, addressing\r\nTaffy: "Mr. Wynne, we are in terrible distress of mind. I don\'t know if\r\nmy son has told you, but on Christmas Day he engaged himself to be\r\nmarried!"\r\n\r\n"To--be--_married!_" exclaimed Taffy and the Laird, for whom this was\r\nnews indeed.\r\n\r\n"Yes--to be married to a Miss Trilby O\'Ferrall, who, from what he\r\nimplies, is in quite a different position in life to himself. Do you\r\nknow the lady, Mr. Wynne?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! I know her very well indeed; we _all_ know her."\r\n\r\n"Is she English?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s an English subject, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Is she a Protestant or a Roman Catholic?" inquired the clergyman.\r\n\r\n"A--a--upon my word, I really don\'t know!"\r\n\r\n"You know her very well indeed, and you _don\'t_--_know_--_that_, Mr.\r\nWynne!" exclaimed Mr. Bagot.\r\n\r\n"Is she a _lady_, Mr. Wynne?" asked Mrs. Bagot, somewhat impatiently, as\r\nif that were a much more important matter.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Laird had managed to basely desert his friend; had got\r\nhimself into his bedroom, and from thence, by another door, into the\r\nstreet and away.\r\n\r\n"A lady?" said Taffy; "a--it so much depends upon what that word exactly\r\nmeans, you know; things are so--a--so different here. Her father was a\r\ngentleman, I believe--a fellow of Trinity, Cambridge--and a clergyman,\r\nif _that_ means anything!... he was unfortunate and all\r\nthat--a--intemperate, I fear, and not successful in life. He has been\r\ndead six or seven years."\r\n\r\n"And her mother?"\r\n\r\n"I really know very little about her mother, except that she was very\r\nhandsome, I believe, and of inferior social rank to her husband. She\'s\r\nalso dead; she died soon after him."\r\n\r\n"What is the young lady, then? An English governess, or something of\r\nthat sort?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no--a--nothing of _that_ sort," said Taffy (and inwardly, "You\r\ncoward--you cad of a Scotch thief of a sneak of a Laird--to leave all\r\nthis to me!").\r\n\r\n"What? Has she independent means of her own, then?"\r\n\r\n"A--not that I know of; I should even say, decidedly not!"\r\n\r\n"What _is_ she, then? She\'s at least respectable, I hope!"\r\n\r\n"At present she\'s a--a blanchisseuse de fin--that is considered\r\nrespectable here."\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s a washer-woman, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Well--rather better than that, perhaps--_de fin_, you know!--things are\r\nso different in Paris! I don\'t think you\'d say she was very much like a\r\nwasher-woman--to look at!"\r\n\r\n"Is she so good-looking, then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; extremely so. You may well say that--very beautiful,\r\nindeed--about that, at least, there is no doubt whatever!"\r\n\r\n"And of unblemished character?"\r\n\r\nTaffy, red and perspiring as if he were going through his Indian-club\r\nexercise, was silent--and his face expressed a miserable perplexity. But\r\nnothing could equal the anxious misery of those two maternal eyes, so\r\nwistfully fixed on his.\r\n\r\nAfter some seconds of a most painful stillness, the lady said, "Can\'t\r\nyou--oh, _can\'t_ you give me an answer, Mr. Wynne?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Bagot, you have placed me in a terrible position! I--I love\r\nyour son just as if he were my own brother! This engagement is a\r\ncomplete surprise to me--a most painful surprise! I\'d thought of many\r\npossible things, but never of _that!_ I cannot--I really _must_ not\r\nconceal from you that it would be an unfortunate marriage for your\r\nson--from a--a worldly point of view, you know--although both I and\r\nMcAllister have a very deep and warm regard for poor Trilby\r\nO\'Ferrall--indeed, a great admiration and affection and respect! She\r\nwas once a model."\r\n\r\n"A _model_, Mr. Wynne? What _sort_ of a model--there are models and\r\nmodels, of course."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'IS SHE A _LADY_, MR. WYNNE?\'"]\r\n\r\n"Well, a model of every sort, in every possible sense of the word--head,\r\nhands, feet, everything!"\r\n\r\n"A model for the _figure?_"\r\n\r\n"Well--yes!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God! my God! my God!" cried Mrs. Bagot--and she got up and\r\nwalked up and down the studio in a most terrible state of agitation,\r\nher brother-in-law following her and begging her to control herself. Her\r\nexclamations seemed to shock him, and she didn\'t seem to care.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Wynne! Mr. Wynne! If you only _knew_ what my son is to me--to\r\nall of us--always has been! He has been with us all his life, till he\r\ncame to this wicked, accursed city! My poor husband would never hear of\r\nhis going to any school, for fear of all the harm he might learn there.\r\nMy son was as innocent and pure-minded as any girl, Mr. Wynne--I could\r\nhave trusted him anywhere--and that\'s why I gave way and allowed him to\r\ncome _here_, of all places in the world--all alone. Oh! I should have\r\ncome with him! Fool--fool--fool that I was!...\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Wynne, he won\'t see either his mother or his uncle! I found a\r\nletter from him at the hotel, saying he\'d left Paris--and I don\'t even\r\nknow where he\'s gone!... Can\'t _you_, can\'t Mr. McAllister, do\r\n_anything_ to avert this miserable disaster? You don\'t know how he loves\r\nyou both--you should see his letters to me and to his sister! they are\r\nalways full of you!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Mrs. Bagot--you can count on McAllister and me for doing\r\neverything in our power! But it is of no use our trying to influence\r\nyour son--I feel quite sure of _that_! It is to _her_ we must make our\r\nappeal."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Wynne! to a washer-woman--a figure model--and Heaven knows what\r\nbesides! and with such a chance as this!"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Bagot, you don\'t know her? She may have been all that. But\r\nstrange as it may seem to you--and seems to me, for that matter--she\'s\r\na--she\'s--upon my word of honor, I really think she\'s about the best\r\nwoman I ever met--the most unselfish--the most--"\r\n\r\n"Ah! She\'s a _beautiful_ woman--I can well see _that!_"\r\n\r\n"She has a beautiful nature, Mrs. Bagot--you may believe me or not, as\r\nyou like--and it is to that I shall make my appeal, as your son\'s\r\nfriend, who has his interests at heart. And let me tell you that deeply\r\nas I grieve for you in your present distress, my grief and concern for\r\nher are far greater!"\r\n\r\n"What! grief for her if she marries my son!"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed--but if she refuses to marry him. She may not do so, of\r\ncourse--but my instinct tells me she will!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Mr. Wynne, is that likely?"\r\n\r\n"I will do my best to make it so--with such an utter trust in her\r\nunselfish goodness of heart and her passionate affection for your son\r\nas--"\r\n\r\n"How do you know she has all this passionate affection for him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, McAllister and I have long guessed it--though we never thought this\r\nparticular thing would come of it. I think, perhaps, that first of all\r\nyou ought to see her yourself--you would get quite a new idea of what\r\nshe really is--you would be surprised, I assure you."\r\n\r\nMrs. Bagot shrugged her shoulders impatiently, and there was silence for\r\na minute or two.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just as in a play, Trilby\'s "Milk below!" was sounded at the\r\ndoor, and Trilby came into the little antechamber, and seeing\r\nstrangers, was about to turn back. She was dressed as a grisette, in her\r\nSunday gown and pretty white cap (for it was New-year\'s Day), and\r\nlooking her very best.\r\n\r\nTaffy called out, "Come in, Trilby!"\r\n\r\nAnd Trilby came into the studio.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw Mrs. Bagot\'s face she stopped short--erect, her\r\nshoulders a little high, her mouth a little open, her eyes wide with\r\nfright--and pale to the lips--a pathetic, yet commanding, magnificent,\r\nand most distinguished apparition, in spite of her humble attire.\r\n\r\nThe little lady got up and walked straight to her, and looked up into\r\nher face, that seemed to tower so. Trilby breathed hard.\r\n\r\nAt length Mrs. Bagot said, in her high accents, "You are Miss Trilby\r\nO\'Ferrall?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes--yes--I am Trilby O\'Ferrall, and you are Mrs. Bagot; I can see\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\nA new tone had come into her large, deep, soft voice, so tragic, so\r\ntouching, so strangely in accord with the whole aspect just then--so\r\nstrangely in accord with the whole situation--that Taffy felt his cheeks\r\nand lips turn cold, and his big spine thrill and tickle all down his\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; you are very, very beautiful--there\'s no doubt about _that_!\r\nYou wish to marry my son?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve refused to marry him nineteen times for his own sake; he will tell\r\nyou so himself. I am not the right person for him to marry. I know that.\r\nOn Christmas night he asked me for the twentieth time; he swore he would\r\nleave Paris next day forever if I refused him. I hadn\'t the courage. I\r\nwas weak, you see! It was a dreadful mistake."\r\n\r\n"Are you so fond of him?"\r\n\r\n"_Fond_ of him? Aren\'t _you_?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m his mother, my good girl!"\r\n\r\nTo this Trilby seemed to have nothing to say.\r\n\r\n"You have just said yourself you are not a fit wife for him. If you are\r\nso _fond_ of him, will you ruin him by marrying him; drag him down;\r\nprevent him from getting on in life; separate him from his sister, his\r\nfamily, his friends?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'_FOND_ OF HIM? AREN\'T _YOU_?\'"]\r\n\r\nTrilby turned her miserable eyes to Taffy\'s miserable face, and said,\r\n"Will it really be all that, Taffy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Trilby, things have got all wrong, and can\'t be righted! I\'m afraid\r\nit might be so. Dear Trilby--I can\'t tell you what I feel--but I can\'t\r\ntell you lies, you know!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no--Taffy--you don\'t tell lies!"\r\n\r\nThen Trilby began to tremble very much, and Taffy tried to make her sit\r\ndown, but she wouldn\'t. Mrs. Bagot looked up into her face, herself\r\nbreathless with keen suspense and cruel anxiety--almost imploring.\r\n\r\nTrilby looked down at Mrs. Bagot very kindly, put out her shaking hand,\r\nand said; "Good-bye, Mrs. Bagot. I will not marry your son. I _promise_\r\nyou. I will never see him again."\r\n\r\nMrs. Bagot caught and clasped her hand and tried to kiss it, and said:\r\n"Don\'t go yet, my dear good girl. I want to talk to you. I want to tell\r\nyou how deeply I--"\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Mrs. Bagot," said Trilby, once more; and, disengaging her\r\nhand, she walked swiftly out of the room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bagot seemed stupefied, and only half content with her quick\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n"She will not marry your son, Mrs. Bagot. I only wish to God she\'d marry\r\n_me_!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Wynne!" said Mrs. Bagot, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" exclaimed the clergyman, with a feebly satirical smile and a\r\nlittle cough and sniff that were not sympathetic, "now if _that_ could\r\nbe arranged--and I\'ve no doubt there wouldn\'t be much opposition on the\r\npart of the lady" (here he made a little complimentary bow), "it would\r\nbe a very desirable thing all round!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s tremendously good of you, I\'m sure--to interest yourself in _my_\r\nhumble affairs," said Taffy. "Look here, sir--I\'m not a great genius\r\nlike your nephew--and it doesn\'t much matter to any one but myself what\r\nI make of my life--but I can assure you that if Trilby\'s heart were set\r\non me as it is on him, I would gladly cast in my lot with hers for life.\r\nShe\'s one in a thousand. She\'s the one sinner that repenteth, you know!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes--to be sure!--to be sure! I know all about that; still, facts\r\nare facts, and the world is the world, and we\'ve got to live in it,"\r\nsaid Mr. Bagot, whose satirical smile had died away under the gleam of\r\nTaffy\'s choleric blue eye.\r\n\r\nThen said the good Taffy, frowning down on the parson (who looked mean\r\nand foolish, as people can sometimes do even with right on their side):\r\n"And now, Mr. Bagot--I can\'t tell you how very keenly I have suffered\r\nduring this--a--this most painful interview--on account of my very deep\r\nregard for Trilby O\'Ferrall. I congratulate you and your sister-in-law\r\non its complete success. I also feel very deeply for your nephew. I\'m\r\nnot sure that he has not lost more than he will gain by--a--by\r\nthe--a--the success of this--a--this interview, in short!"\r\n\r\nTaffy\'s eloquence was exhausted, and his quick temper was getting the\r\nbetter of him.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Bagot, drying her eyes, came and took his hand in a very\r\ncharming and simple manner, and said: "Mr. Wynne, I think I know what\r\nyou are feeling just now. You must try and make some allowance for us.\r\nYou will, I am sure, when we are gone, and you have had time to think a\r\nlittle. As for that noble and beautiful girl, I only wish that she were\r\nsuch that my son _could_ marry her--in her past life, I mean. It is not\r\nher humble rank that would frighten me; _pray_ believe that I am quite\r\nsincere in this--and don\'t think too hardly of your friend\'s mother.\r\nThink of all I shall have to go through with my poor son--who is deeply\r\nin love--and no wonder! and who has won the love of such a woman as\r\nthat! and who cannot see at present how fatal to him such a marriage\r\nwould be. I can see all the charm and believe in all the goodness, in\r\nspite of all. And, oh, how beautiful she is, and what a voice! All that\r\ncounts for so much, doesn\'t it? I cannot tell you how I grieve for her.\r\nI can make no amends--who could, for such a thing? There are no amends,\r\nand I shall not even try. I will only write and tell her all I think and\r\nfeel. You will forgive us, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nAnd in the quick, impulsive warmth and grace and sincerity of her manner\r\nas she said all this, Mrs. Bagot was so absurdly like Little Billee that\r\nit touched big Taffy\'s heart, and he would have forgiven anything, and\r\nthere was nothing to forgive.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Bagot, there\'s no question of forgiveness. Good heavens! it is\r\nall so unfortunate, you know! Nobody\'s to blame that I can see.\r\nGood-bye, Mrs. Bagot; good-bye, sir," and so saying, he saw them down to\r\ntheir "remise," in which sat a singularly pretty young lady of seventeen\r\nor so, pale and anxious, and so like Little Billee that it was quite\r\nfunny, and touched big Taffy\'s heart again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Trilby went out into the court-yard in the Place St. Anatole des\r\nArts, she saw Miss Bagot looking out of the carriage window, and in the\r\nyoung lady\'s face, as she caught her eye, an expression of sweet\r\nsurprise and sympathetic admiration, with lifted eyebrows and parted\r\nlips--just such a look as she had often got from Little Billee! She knew\r\nher for his sister at once. It was a sharp pang.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "SO LIKE LITTLE BILLEE"]\r\n\r\nShe turned away, saying to herself: "Oh no; I will not separate him from\r\nhis sister, his family, his friends! That would _never_ do! _That\'s_\r\nsettled, anyhow!"\r\n\r\nFeeling a little dazed, and wishing to think, she turned up the Rue\r\nVieille des Mauvais Ladres, which was always deserted at this hour. It\r\nwas empty but for a solitary figure sitting on a post, with its legs\r\ndangling, its hands in its trousers-pockets, an inverted pipe in its\r\nmouth, a tattered straw hat on the back of its head, and a long gray\r\ncoat down to its heels. It was the Laird.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he saw her he jumped off his post and came to her, saying:\r\n"Oh, Trilby--what\'s it all about? I couldn\'t stand it! I ran away!\r\nLittle Billee\'s mother\'s there!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sandy dear, I\'ve just seen her."\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve promised her never to see Little Billee any more. I was foolish\r\nenough to promise to marry him. I refused many times these last three\r\nmonths, and then he said he\'d leave Paris and never come back, and so,\r\nlike a fool, I gave way. I\'ve offered to live with him and take care of\r\nhim and be his servant--to be everything he wished but his wife! But he\r\nwouldn\'t hear of it. Dear, dear Little Billee! he\'s an angel--and I\'ll\r\ntake precious good care no harm shall ever come to him through me! I\r\nshall leave this hateful place and go and live in the country: I suppose\r\nI must manage to get through life somehow. I know of some poor people\r\nwho were once very fond of me, and I could live with them and help them\r\nand keep myself. The difficulty is about Jeannot. I thought it all out\r\nbefore it came to this. I was well prepared, you see."\r\n\r\nShe smiled in a forlorn sort of way, with her upper lip drawn tight\r\nagainst her teeth, as if some one were pulling her back by the lobes of\r\nher ears.\r\n\r\n"Oh! but Trilby--what shall we do without you? Taffy and I, you know!\r\nYou\'ve become one of us!"\r\n\r\n"Now how good and kind of you to say that!" exclaimed poor Trilby, her\r\neyes filling. "Why, that\'s just all I lived for, till all this happened.\r\nBut it can\'t be any more now, can it? Everything is changed for me--the\r\nvery sky seems different. Ah! Durien\'s little song--\'_Plaisir\r\nd\'amour--chagrin d\'amour_!\' it\'s all quite true, isn\'t it? I shall start\r\nimmediately, and take Jeannot with me, I think."\r\n\r\n"But where do you think of going?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I mayn\'t tell you that, Sandy dear--not for a long time! Think of\r\nall the trouble there\'d be-- Well, there\'s no time to be lost. I must\r\ntake the bull by the horns."\r\n\r\nShe tried to laugh, and took him by his big side-whiskers and kissed him\r\non the eyes and mouth, and her tears fell on his face.\r\n\r\nThen, feeling unable to speak, she nodded farewell, and walked quickly\r\nup the narrow winding street. When she came to the first bend she turned\r\nround and waved her hand, and kissed it two or three times, and then\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Laird stared for several minutes up the empty\r\nthoroughfare--wretched, full of sorrow and compassion. Then he filled\r\nhimself another pipe and lit it, and hitched himself on to another post,\r\nand sat there dangling his legs and kicking his heels, and waited for\r\nthe Bagots\' cab to depart, that he might go up and face the righteous\r\nwrath of Taffy like a man, and bear up against his bitter reproaches for\r\ncowardice and desertion before the foe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning Taffy received two letters: one, a very long one, was from\r\nMrs. Bagot. He read it twice over, and was forced to acknowledge that it\r\nwas a very good letter--the letter of a clever, warm-hearted woman, but\r\na woman also whose son was to her as the very apple of her eye. One felt\r\nshe was ready to flay her dearest friend alive in order to make Little\r\nBillee a pair of gloves out of the skin, if he wanted a pair; but one\r\nalso felt she would be genuinely sorry for the friend. Taffy\'s own\r\nmother had been a little like that, and he missed her every day of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFull justice was done by Mrs. Bagot to all Trilby\'s qualities of head\r\nand heart and person; but at the same time she pointed out, with all the\r\ncunning and ingeniously casuistic logic of her sex, when it takes to\r\nspecial pleading (even when it has right on its side), what the\r\nconsequences of such a marriage must inevitably be in a few years--even\r\nsooner! The quick disenchantment, the life-long regret, on both sides!\r\n\r\nHe could not have found a word to controvert her arguments, save perhaps\r\nin his own private belief that Trilby and Little Billee were both\r\nexceptional people; and how could he hope to know Little Billee\'s nature\r\nbetter than the boy\'s own mother!\r\n\r\nAnd if he had been the boy\'s elder brother in blood, as he already was\r\nin art and affection, would he, should he, could he have given his\r\nfraternal sanction to such a match?\r\n\r\nBoth as his friend and his brother he felt it was out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe other letter was from Trilby, in her bold, careless handwriting,\r\nthat sprawled all over the page, and her occasionally imperfect\r\nspelling. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'I MUST TAKE THE BULL BY THE HORNS\'"]\r\n\r\n     "MY DEAR, DEAR TAFFY,--This is to say good-bye. I\'m going away, to\r\n     put an end to all this misery, for which nobody\'s to blame but\r\n     myself.\r\n\r\n     "The very moment after I\'d said _yes_ to Little Billee I knew\r\n     perfectly well what a stupid fool I was, and I\'ve been ashamed of\r\n     myself ever since. I had a miserable week, I can tell you. I knew\r\n     how it would all turn out.\r\n\r\n     "I am dreadfully unhappy, but not half so unhappy as if I married\r\n     him and he were ever to regret it and be ashamed of me; and of\r\n     course he would, really, even if he didn\'t show it--good and kind\r\n     as he is--an angel!\r\n\r\n     "Besides--of course I could never be a lady--how could I?--though I\r\n     ought to have been one, I suppose. But everything seems to have\r\n     gone wrong with me, though I never found it out before--and it\r\n     can\'t be righted!\r\n\r\n     "Poor papa!\r\n\r\n     "I am going away with Jeannot. I\'ve been neglecting him shamefully.\r\n     I mean to make up for it all now.\r\n\r\n     "You mustn\'t try and find out where I am going; I know you won\'t if\r\n     I beg you, nor any one else. It would make everything so much\r\n     harder for me.\r\n\r\n     "Ang\xc3\xa8le knows; she has promised me not to tell. I should like to\r\n     have a line from you very much. If you send it to her she will send\r\n     it on to me.\r\n\r\n     "Dear Taffy, next to Little Billee, I love you and the Laird better\r\n     than any one else in the whole world. I\'ve never known real\r\n     happiness till I met you. You have changed me into another\r\n     person--you and Sandy and Little Billee.\r\n\r\n     "Oh, it _has_ been a jolly time, though it didn\'t last long. It\r\n     will have to do for me for life. So good-bye. I shall never, never\r\n     forget; and remain, with dearest love,\r\n\r\n     "Your ever faithful and most affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n     "TRILBY O\'FERRALL.\r\n\r\n     "P.S.--When it has all blown over and settled again, if it ever\r\n     does, I shall come back to Paris, perhaps, and see you again some\r\n     day."\r\n\r\nThe good Taffy pondered deeply over this letter--read it half a dozen\r\ntimes at least; and then he kissed it, and put it back into its envelope\r\nand locked it up.\r\n\r\nHe knew what very deep anguish underlay this somewhat trivial expression\r\nof her sorrow.\r\n\r\nHe guessed how Trilby, so childishly impulsive and demonstrative in the\r\nordinary intercourse of friendship, would be more reticent than most\r\nwomen in such a case as this.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to her warmly, affectionately, at great length, and sent the\r\nletter as she had told him.\r\n\r\nThe Laird also wrote a long letter full of tenderly worded friendship\r\nand sincere regard. Both expressed their hope and belief that they would\r\nsoon see her again, when the first bitterness of her grief would be\r\nover, and that the old pleasant relations would be renewed.\r\n\r\nAnd then, feeling wretched, they went and silently lunched together at\r\nthe Caf\xc3\xa9 de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on, where the omelets were good and the wine wasn\'t\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nLate that evening they sat together in the studio, reading. They found\r\nthey could not talk to each other very readily without Little Billee to\r\nlisten--three\'s company sometimes and two\'s none!\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a tremendous getting up the dark stairs outside in a\r\nviolent hurry, and Little Billee burst into the room like a small\r\nwhirlwind--haggard, out of breath, almost speechless at first with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n"Trilby? where is she?... what\'s become of her?... She\'s run away ...\r\noh! She\'s written me such a letter!... We were to have been married ...\r\nat the Embassy ... my mother ... she\'s been meddling; and that cursed\r\nold ass ... that beast ... my uncle!... They\'ve been here! I know all\r\nabout it.... Why didn\'t you stick up for her?..."\r\n\r\n"I did ... as well as I could. Sandy couldn\'t stand it, and cut."\r\n\r\n"_You_ stuck up for her ... _you_--why, you agreed with my mother that\r\nshe oughtn\'t to marry me--you--you false friend--you.... Why, she\'s an\r\nangel--far too good for the likes of _me_ ... you know she is. As ... as\r\nfor her social position and all that, what degrading rot! Her father was\r\nas much a gentleman as mine ... besides ... what the devil do I care for\r\nher father?... it\'s _her_ I want--_her_--_her_--_her_, I tell you.... I\r\ncan\'t _live_ without her.... I must have her _back_--I must have her\r\n_back_ ... do you _hear_? We were to have lived together at Barbizon ...\r\nall our lives--and I was to have painted stunning pictures ... like\r\nthose other fellows there. Who cares for _their_ social position, I\r\nshould like to know ... or that of their wives? _Damn_ social\r\nposition!... we\'ve often said so--over and over again. An artist\'s life\r\nshould be _away_ from the world--above all that meanness and paltriness\r\n... all in his work. Social position, indeed! Over and over again we\'ve\r\nsaid what fetid, bestial rot it all was--a thing to make one sick and\r\nshut one\'s self away from the world.... Why say one thing and act\r\nanother?... Love comes before all--love levels all--love and art ... and\r\nbeauty--before such beauty as Trilby\'s rank doesn\'t exist. Such rank as\r\nmine, too! Good God! I\'ll never paint another stroke till I\'ve got her\r\nback ... never, never, I tell you--I can\'t--I won\'t!..."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'TRILBY! WHERE IS SHE?\'"]\r\n\r\nAnd so the poor boy went on, tearing and raving about in his rampage,\r\nknocking over chairs and easels, stammering and shrieking, mad with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nThey tried to reason with him, to make him listen, to point out that it\r\nwas not her social position alone that unfitted her to be his wife and\r\nthe mother of his children, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was no good. He grew more and more uncontrollable, became almost\r\nunintelligible, he stammered so--a pitiable sight and pitiable to hear.\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! good heavens! are you so precious immaculate, you two, that you\r\nshould throw stones at poor Trilby! What a shame, what a hideous shame\r\nit is that there should be one law for the woman and another for the\r\nman!... poor weak women--poor, soft, affectionate things that beasts of\r\nmen are always running after and pestering and ruining and trampling\r\nunderfoot.... Oh! oh! it makes me sick--it makes me sick!" And finally\r\nhe gasped and screamed and fell down in a fit on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was sent for; Taffy went in a cab to the H\xc3\xb4tel de Lille et\r\nd\'Albion to fetch his mother; and poor Little Billee, quite unconscious,\r\nwas undressed by Sandy and Madame Vinard and put into the Laird\'s bed.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came, and not long after Mrs. Bagot and her daughter. It was\r\na serious case. Another doctor was called in. Beds were got and made up\r\nin the studio for the two grief-stricken ladies, and thus closed the eve\r\nof what was to have been poor Little Billee\'s wedding-day, it seems.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee\'s attack appears to have been a kind of epileptic seizure.\r\nIt ended in brain-fever and other complications--a long and tedious\r\nillness. It was many weeks before he was out of danger, and his\r\nconvalescence was long and tedious too.\r\n\r\nHis nature seemed changed. He lay languid and listless--never even\r\nmentioned Trilby, except once to ask if she had come back, and if any\r\none knew where she was, and if she had been written to.\r\n\r\nShe had not, it appears. Mrs. Bagot had thought it was better not, and\r\nTaffy and the Laird agreed with her that no good could come of writing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bagot felt bitterly against the woman who had been the cause of all\r\nthis trouble, and bitterly against herself for her injustice. It was an\r\nunhappy time for everybody.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was more unhappiness still to come.\r\n\r\nOne day in February Madame Ang\xc3\xa8le Boisse called on Taffy and the Laird\r\nin the temporary studio where they worked. She was in terrible\r\ntribulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA S\xc5\x92UR DE LITREBILI]\r\n\r\nTrilby\'s little brother had died of scarlet-fever and was buried, and\r\nTrilby had left her hiding-place the day after the funeral and had never\r\ncome back, and this was a week ago. She and Jeannot had been living at a\r\nvillage called Vibraye, in la Sarthe, lodging with some poor people she\r\nknew--she washing and working with her needle till her brother fell ill.\r\n\r\nShe had never left his bedside for a moment, night or day, and when he\r\ndied her grief was so terrible that people thought she would go out of\r\nher mind; and the day after he was buried she was not to be found\r\nanywhere--she had disappeared, taking nothing with her, not even her\r\nclothes--simply vanished and left no sign, no message of any kind.\r\n\r\nAll the ponds had been searched--all the wells, and the small stream\r\nthat flows through Vibraye--and the old forest.\r\n\r\nTaffy went to Vibraye, cross-examined everybody he could, communicated\r\nwith the Paris police, but with no result, and every afternoon, with a\r\nbeating heart, he went to the Morgue....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe news was of course kept from Little Billee. There was no difficulty\r\nabout this. He never asked a question, hardly ever spoke.\r\n\r\nWhen he first got up and was carried into the studio he asked for his\r\npicture "The Pitcher Goes to the Well," and looked at it for a while,\r\nand then shrugged his shoulders and laughed--a miserable sort of laugh,\r\npainful to hear--the laugh of a cold old man, who laughs so as not to\r\ncry! Then he looked at his mother and sister, and saw the sad havoc that\r\ngrief and anxiety had wrought in them.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him, as in a bad dream, that he had been mad for many\r\nyears--a cause of endless sickening terror and distress; and that his\r\npoor weak wandering wits had come back at last, bringing in their train\r\ncruel remorse, and the remembrance of all the patient love and kindness\r\nthat had been lavished on him for many years! His sweet sister--his\r\ndear, long-suffering mother! what had really happened to make them look\r\nlike this?\r\n\r\nAnd taking them both in his feeble arms, he fell a-weeping, quite\r\ndesperately and for a long time.\r\n\r\nAnd when his weeping-fit was over, when he had quite wept himself out,\r\nhe fell asleep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "HE FELL A-WEEPING, QUITE DESPERATELY"]\r\n\r\nAnd when he awoke he was conscious that another sad thing had happened\r\nto him, and that for some mysterious cause his power of loving had not\r\ncome back with his wandering wits--had been left behind--and it seemed\r\nto him that it was gone for ever and ever--would never come back\r\nagain--not even his love for his mother and sister, not even his love\r\nfor Trilby--where all _that_ had once been was a void, a gap, a\r\nblankness....\r\n\r\nTruly, if Trilby had suffered much, she had also been the innocent cause\r\nof terrible suffering. Poor Mrs. Bagot, in her heart, could not forgive\r\nher.\r\n\r\nI feel this is getting to be quite a sad story, and that it is high time\r\nto cut this part of it short.\r\n\r\nAs the warmer weather came, and Little Billee got stronger, the studio\r\nbecame more pleasant. The ladies\' beds were removed to another studio on\r\nthe next landing, which was vacant, and the friends came to see Little\r\nBillee, and make it more lively for him and his sister.\r\n\r\nAs for Taffy and the Laird, they had already long been to Mrs. Bagot as\r\na pair of crutches, without whose invaluable help she could never have\r\nheld herself upright to pick her way in all this maze of trouble.\r\n\r\nThen M. Carrel came every day to chat with his favorite pupil and\r\ngladden Mrs. Bagot\'s heart. And also Durien, Carnegie, Petrolicoconose,\r\nVincent, Antony, Lorrimer, Dodor, and l\'Zouzou; Mrs. Bagot thought the\r\nlast two irresistible, when she had once been satisfied that they were\r\n"gentlemen," in spite of appearances. And, indeed, they showed\r\nthemselves to great advantage; and though they were so much the opposite\r\nto Little Billee in everything, she felt almost maternal towards them,\r\nand gave them innocent, good, motherly advice, which they swallowed\r\n_avec attendrissement_, not even stealing a look at each other. And they\r\nheld Mrs. Bagot\'s wool, and listened to Miss Bagot\'s sacred music with\r\nupturned pious eyes, and mealy mouths that butter wouldn\'t melt in!\r\n\r\nIt is good to be a soldier and a detrimental; you touch the hearts of\r\nwomen and charm them--old and young, high or low (excepting, perhaps, a\r\nfew worldly mothers of marriageable daughters). They take the sticking\r\nof your tongue in the cheek for the wearing of your heart on the sleeve.\r\n\r\nIndeed, good women all over the world, and ever since it began, have\r\nloved to be bamboozled by these genial, roistering dare-devils, who\r\nhaven\'t got a penny to bless themselves with (which is so touching), and\r\nare supposed to carry their lives in their hands, even in piping times\r\nof peace. Nay, even a few rare _bad_ women sometimes, such women as the\r\nbest and wisest of us are often ready to sell our souls for!\r\n\r\n    "A lightsome eye, a soldier\'s mien,\r\n       A feather of the blue,\r\n     A doublet of the Lincoln green--\r\n       No more of me you knew,\r\n             My love!\r\n       No more of me you knew...."\r\n\r\nAs if that wasn\'t enough, and to spare!\r\n\r\nLittle Billee could hardly realize that these two polite and gentle and\r\nsympathetic sons of Mars were the lively grigs who had made themselves\r\nso pleasant all round, and in such a singular manner, on the top of that\r\nSt. Cloud omnibus; and he admired how they added hypocrisy to their\r\nother crimes!\r\n\r\nSvengali had gone back to Germany, it seemed, with his pockets full of\r\nnapoleons and big Havana cigars, and wrapped in an immense fur-lined\r\ncoat, which he meant to wear all through the summer. But little Gecko\r\noften came with his violin and made lovely music, and that seemed to do\r\nLittle Billee more good than anything else.\r\n\r\nIt made him realize in his brain all the love he could no longer feel in\r\nhis heart. The sweet melodic phrase, rendered by a master, was as\r\nwholesome, refreshing balm to him while it lasted--or as manna in the\r\nwilderness. It was the one good thing within his reach, never to be\r\ntaken from him as long as his ear-drums remained and he could hear a\r\nmaster play.\r\n\r\nPoor Gecko treated the two English ladies _de bas en haut_ as if they\r\nhad been goddesses, even when they accompanied him on the piano! He\r\nbegged their pardon for every wrong note they struck, and adopted their\r\n"tempi"--that is the proper technical term, I believe--and turned\r\nscherzos and allegrettos into funeral dirges to please them; and agreed\r\nwith them, poor little traitor, that it all sounded much better like\r\nthat!\r\n\r\nO Beethoven! O Mozart! did you turn in your graves?\r\n\r\nThen, on fine afternoons, Little Billee was taken for drives to the Bois\r\nde Boulogne with his mother and sister in an open fly, and generally\r\nTaffy as a fourth; to Passy, Auteuil, Boulogne, St. Cloud, Meudon--there\r\nare many charming places within an easy drive of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE SWEET MELODIC PHRASE"]\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes Taffy or the Laird would escort Mrs. and Miss Bagot to the\r\nLuxembourg Gallery, the Louvre, the Palais Royal--to the Com\xc3\xa9die\r\nFran\xc3\xa7aise once or twice; and on Sundays, now and then, to the English\r\nchapel in the Rue Marb\xc5\x93uf. It was all very pleasant; and Miss Bagot\r\nlooks back on the days of her brother\'s convalescence as among the\r\nhappiest in her life.\r\n\r\nAnd they would all five dine together in the studio, with Madame Vinard\r\nto wait, and her mother (a cordon bleu) for cook; and the whole aspect\r\nof the place was changed and made fragrant, sweet, and charming by all\r\nthis new feminine invasion and occupation.\r\n\r\nAnd what is sweeter to watch than the dawn and growth of love\'s young\r\ndream, when strength and beauty meet together by the couch of a beloved\r\ninvalid?\r\n\r\nOf course the sympathetic reader will foresee how readily the stalwart\r\nTaffy fell a victim to the charms of his friend\'s sweet sister, and how\r\nshe grew to return his more than brotherly regard! and how, one lovely\r\nevening, just as March was going out like a lamb (to make room for the\r\nfirst of April), little Billee joined their hands together, and gave\r\nthem his brotherly blessing!\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, nothing of this kind happened. Nothing\r\never happens but the _un_foreseen. Pazienza!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen at length one day--it was a fine, sunny, showery day in April,\r\nby-the-bye, and the big studio window was open at the top and let in a\r\npleasant breeze from the northwest, just as when our little story\r\nbegan--a railway omnibus drew up at the porte coch\xc3\xa8re in the Place St.\r\nAnatole des Arts, and carried away to the station of the Chemin de Fer\r\ndu Nord Little Billee and his mother and sister, and all their\r\nbelongings (the famous picture had gone before); and Taffy and the Laird\r\nrode with them, their faces very long, to see the last of the dear\r\npeople, and of the train that was to bear them away from Paris; and\r\nLittle Billee, with his quick, prehensile, \xc3\xa6sthetic eye, took many a\r\nlong and wistful parting gaze at many a French thing he loved, from the\r\ngray towers of Notre Dame downward--Heaven only knew when he might see\r\nthem again!--so he tried to get their aspect well by heart, that he\r\nmight have the better store of beloved shape and color memories to chew\r\nthe cud of when his lost powers of loving and remembering clearly should\r\ncome back, and he lay awake at night and listened to the wash of the\r\nAtlantic along the beautiful red sandstone coast at home.\r\n\r\nHe had a faint hope that he should feel sorry at parting with Taffy and\r\nthe Laird.\r\n\r\nBut when the time came for saying good-bye he couldn\'t feel sorry in the\r\nleast, for all he tried and strained so hard!\r\n\r\nSo he thanked them so earnestly and profusely for all their kindness and\r\npatience and sympathy (as did also his mother and sister) that their\r\nhearts were too full to speak, and their manner was quite gruff--it was\r\na way they had when they were deeply moved and didn\'t want to show it.\r\n\r\nAnd as he gazed out of the carriage window at their two forlorn figures\r\nlooking after him when the train steamed out of the station, his sorrow\r\nat not feeling sorry made him look so haggard and so woe-begone that\r\nthey could scarcely bear the sight of him departing without them, and\r\nalmost felt as if they must follow by the next train, and go and cheer\r\nhim up in Devonshire, and themselves too.\r\n\r\nThey did not yield to this amiable weakness. Sorrowfully, arm in arm,\r\nwith trailing umbrellas, they recrossed the river, and found their way\r\nto the Caf\xc3\xa9 de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on, where they ate many omelets in silence, and\r\ndejectedly drank of the best they could get, and were very sad indeed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNearly five years have elapsed since we bade farewell and _au revoir_ to\r\nTaffy and the Laird at the Paris station of the Chemin de Fer du Nord,\r\nand wished Little Billee and his mother and sister Godspeed on their way\r\nto Devonshire, where the poor sufferer was to rest and lie fallow for a\r\nfew months, and recruit his lost strength and energy, that he might\r\nfollow up his first and well-deserved success, which perhaps contributed\r\njust a little to his recovery.\r\n\r\nMany of my readers will remember his splendid d\xc3\xa9but at the Royal Academy\r\nin Trafalgar Square with that now so famous canvas "The Pitcher Goes to\r\nthe Well," and how it was sold three times over on the morning of the\r\nprivate view, the third time for a thousand pounds--just five times what\r\nhe got for it himself. And that was thought a large sum in those days\r\nfor a beginner\'s picture, two feet by four.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "SORROWFULLY, ARM IN ARM"]\r\n\r\nI am well aware that such a vulgar test is no criterion whatever of a\r\npicture\'s real merit. But this picture is well known to all the world by\r\nthis time, and sold only last year at Christy\'s (more than thirty-six\r\nyears after it was painted) for three thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThirty-six years! That goes a long way to redeem even three thousand\r\npounds of all their cumulative vulgarity.\r\n\r\n"The Pitcher" is now in the National Gallery, with that other canvas by\r\nthe same hand, "The Moon-Dial." There they hang together for all who\r\ncare to see them, his first and his last--the blossom and the fruit.\r\n\r\nHe had not long to live himself, and it was his good-fortune, so rare\r\namong those whose work is destined to live forever, that he succeeded at\r\nhis first go-off.\r\n\r\nAnd his success was of the best and most flattering kind.\r\n\r\nIt began high up, where it should, among the masters of his own craft.\r\nBut his fame filtered quickly down to those immediately beneath, and\r\nthrough these to wider circles. And there was quite enough of opposition\r\nand vilification and coarse abuse of him to clear it of any suspicion of\r\ncheapness or evanescence. What better antiseptic can there be than the\r\nphilistine\'s deep hate? What sweeter, fresher, wholesomer music than the\r\nsound of his voice when he doth so furiously rage?\r\n\r\nYes! That is "good production." As Svengali would have said, "C\'est un\r\ncri du c\xc5\x93ur!"\r\n\r\nAnd then, when popular acclaim brings the great dealers and the big\r\ncheques, up rises the printed howl of the duffer, the disappointed one,\r\nthe "wounded thing with an angry cry"--the prosperous and happy bagman\r\nthat _should_ have been, who has given up all for art, and finds he\r\ncan\'t paint and make himself a name, after all, and never will, so falls\r\nto writing about those who can--and what writing!\r\n\r\nTo write in hissing dispraise of our more successful fellow-craftsman,\r\nand of those who admire him! that is not a clean or pretty trade. It\r\nseems, alas! an easy one, and it gives pleasure to so many. It does not\r\neven want good grammar. But it pays--well enough even to start and run a\r\nmagazine with, instead of scholarship and taste and talent! humor,\r\nsense, wit, and wisdom! It is something like the purveying of\r\npornographic pictures: some of us look at them and laugh, and even buy.\r\nTo be a purchaser is bad enough; but to be the purveyor thereof--ugh!\r\n\r\nA poor devil of a cracked soprano (are there such people still?) who has\r\nbeen turned out of the Pope\'s choir because he can\'t sing in tune,\r\n_after all_!--think of him yelling and squeaking his treble rage at\r\nSantley--Sims Reeves--Lablache!\r\n\r\nPoor, lost, beardless nondescript! why not fly to other climes, where at\r\nleast thou might\'st hide from us thy woful crack, and keep thy miserable\r\nsecret to thyself! Are there no harems still left in Stamboul for the\r\nlikes of thee to sweep and clean, no women\'s beds to make and slops to\r\nempty, and doors and windows to bar--and tales to carry, and the pasha\'s\r\nconfidence and favor and protection to win? Even _that_ is a better\r\ntrade than pandering for hire to the basest instinct of all--the dirty\r\npleasure we feel (some of us) in seeing mud and dead cats and rotten\r\neggs flung at those we cannot but admire--and secretly envy!\r\n\r\nAll of which eloquence means that Little Billee was pitched into right\r\nand left, as well as overpraised. And it all rolled off him like water\r\noff a duck\'s back, both praise and blame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a happy summer for Mrs. Bagot, a sweet compensation for all the\r\nanguish of the winter that had gone before, with her two beloved\r\nchildren together under her wing, and all the world (for her) ringing\r\nwith the praise of her boy, the apple of her eye, so providentially\r\nrescued from the very jaws of death, and from other dangers almost as\r\nterrible to her fiercely jealous maternal heart.\r\n\r\nAnd his affection for her _seemed_ to grow with his returning health;\r\nbut, alas! he was never again to be quite the same light-hearted,\r\ninnocent, expansive lad he had been before that fatal year spent in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nOne chapter of his life was closed, never to be reopened, never to be\r\nspoken of again by him to her, by her to him. She could neither forgive\r\nnor forget. She could but be silent.\r\n\r\nOtherwise he was pleasant and sweet to live with, and everything was\r\ndone to make his life at home as sweet and pleasant as a loving mother\r\ncould--as could a most charming sister--and others\' sisters who were\r\ncharming too, and much disposed to worship at the shrine of this young\r\ncelebrity, who woke up one morning in their little village to find\r\nhimself famous, and bore his blushing honors so meekly. And among them\r\nthe vicar\'s daughter, his sister\'s friend and co-teacher at the\r\nSunday-school, "a simple, pure, and pious maiden of gentle birth,"\r\neverything he once thought a young lady should be; and her name it was\r\nAlice, and she was sweet, and her hair was brown--as brown!...\r\n\r\nAnd if he no longer found the simple country pleasures, the junketings\r\nand picnics, the garden-parties and innocent little musical evenings,\r\nquite so exciting as of old, he never showed it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was much that he did not show, and that his mother and\r\nsister tried in vain to guess--many things.\r\n\r\nAnd among them one thing that constantly preoccupied and distressed\r\nhim--the numbness of his affections. He could be as easily demonstrative\r\nto his mother and sister as though nothing had ever happened to\r\nhim--from the mere force of a sweet old habit--even more so, out of\r\nsheer gratitude and compunction.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! he felt that in his heart he could no longer care for them in\r\nthe least!--nor for Taffy, nor the Laird, nor for himself; not even for\r\nTrilby, of whom he constantly thought, but without emotion; and of whose\r\nstrange disappearance he had been told, and the story had been confirmed\r\nin all its details by Ang\xc3\xa8le Boisse, to whom he had written.\r\n\r\nIt was as though some part of his brain where his affections were seated\r\nhad been paralyzed, while all the rest of it was as keen and as active\r\nas ever. He felt like some poor live bird or beast or reptile, a part\r\nof whose cerebrum (or cerebellum, or whatever it is) had been dug out by\r\nthe vivisector for experimental purposes; and the strongest emotional\r\nfeeling he seemed capable of was his anxiety and alarm about this\r\ncurious symptom, and his concern as to whether he ought to mention it or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nHe did not do so, for fear of causing distress, hoping that it would\r\npass away in time, and redoubled his caresses to his mother and sister,\r\nand clung to them more than ever; and became more considerate of others\r\nin manner, word, and deed than he had ever been before, as though by\r\nconstantly assuming the virtue he had no longer he would gradually coax\r\nit back again. There was no trouble he would not take to give pleasure\r\nto the humblest.\r\n\r\nAlso, his vanity about himself had become as nothing, and he missed it\r\nalmost as much as his affection.\r\n\r\nYet he told himself over and over again that he was a great artist, and\r\nthat he would spare no pains to make himself a greater. But that was no\r\nmerit of his own.\r\n\r\n2+2=4, also 2\xc3\x972=4; that peculiarity was no reason why 4 should be\r\nconceited; for what was 4 but a result, either way?\r\n\r\nWell, he was like 4--just an inevitable result of circumstances over\r\nwhich he had no control--a mere product or sum; and though he meant to\r\nmake himself as big a 4 as he could (to cultivate his peculiar\r\n_fourness_), he could no longer feel the old conceit and\r\nself-complacency; and they had been a joy, and it was hard to do without\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of it all was a vague, disquieting unhappiness, a constant\r\nfidget.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to him, and much to his distress, that such mild\r\nunhappiness would be the greatest he could ever feel henceforward--but\r\nthat, such as it was, it would never leave him, and that his moral\r\nexistence would be for evermore one long, gray, gloomy blank--the\r\nglimmer of twilight--never glad, confident morning again!\r\n\r\nSo much for Little Billee\'s convalescence.\r\n\r\nThen one day in the late autumn he spread his wings and flew away to\r\nLondon, which was very ready with open arms to welcome William Bagot,\r\nthe already famous painter, _alias_ Little Billee!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Fifth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE BILLEE\r\n\r\n_An Interlude_\r\n\r\n    "Then the mortal coldness of the Soul like death itself comes down;\r\n     It cannot feel for others\' woes, it dare not dream its own;\r\n     That heavy chill has frozen o\'er the fountain of our tears,\r\n     And, though the eye may sparkle yet, \'tis where the ice appears.\r\n\r\n     "Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast,\r\n     Through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest:\r\n     \'Tis but as ivy leaves around a ruined turret wreathe,\r\n     All green and wildly fresh without, but worn and gray beneath."\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Taffy and the Laird went back to the studio in the Place St.\r\nAnatole des Arts, and resumed their ordinary life there, it was with a\r\nsense of desolation and dull bereavement beyond anything they could have\r\nimagined; and this did not seem to lessen as the time wore on.\r\n\r\nThey realized for the first time how keen and penetrating and\r\nunintermittent had been the charm of those two central figures--Trilby\r\nand Little Billee--and how hard it was to live without them, after such\r\nintimacy as had been theirs.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it _has_ been a jolly time, though it didn\'t last long!" So Trilby\r\nhad written in her farewell letter to Taffy; and these words were true\r\nfor Taffy and the Laird as well as for her.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the worst of those dear people who have charm: they are so\r\nterrible to do without, when once you have got accustomed to them and\r\nall their ways.\r\n\r\nAnd when, besides being charming, they are simple, clever, affectionate,\r\nconstant, and sincere, like Trilby and Little Billee! Then the\r\nlamentable hole their disappearance makes is not to be filled up! And\r\nwhen they are full of genius, like Little Billee--and like Trilby, funny\r\nwithout being vulgar! For so she always seemed to the Laird and Taffy,\r\neven in French (in spite of her Gallic audacities of thought, speech,\r\nand gesture).\r\n\r\nAll seemed to have suffered change. The very boxing and fencing were\r\ngone through perfunctorily, for mere health\'s sake; and a thin layer of\r\nadipose deposit began to soften the outlines of the hills and dales on\r\nTaffy\'s mighty forearm.\r\n\r\nDodor and l\'Zouzou no longer came so often, now that the charming Little\r\nBillee and his charming mother and still more charming sister had gone\r\naway--nor Carnegie, nor Antony, nor Lorrimer, nor Vincent, nor the\r\nGreek. Gecko never came at all. Even Svengali was missed, little as he\r\nhad been liked. It is a dismal and sulky looking piece of furniture, a\r\ngrand-piano that nobody ever plays--with all its sound and its souvenirs\r\nlocked up inside--a kind of mausoleum! a lop-sided coffin--trestles and\r\nall!\r\n\r\nSo it went back to London by the "little quickness," just as it had\r\ncome!\r\n\r\nThus Taffy and the Laird grew quite sad and mopy, and lunched at the\r\nCaf\xc3\xa9 de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on every day--till the goodness of the omelets palled, and\r\nthe redness of the wine there got on their nerves and into their heads\r\nand faces, and made them sleepy till dinner-time. And then, waking up,\r\nthey dressed respectably, and dined expensively, "like gentlemen," in\r\nthe Palais Royal, or the Passage Choiseul, or the Passage des\r\nPanoramas--for three francs, three francs fifty, even five francs a\r\nhead, and half a franc to the waiter!--and went to the theatre almost\r\nevery night, on that side of the water--and more often than not they\r\ntook a cab home, each smoking a Panatella, which costs twenty-five\r\ncentimes--five sous--2-1/2_d._\r\n\r\nThen they feebly drifted into quite decent society--like Lorrimer and\r\nCarnegie--with dress-coats and white ties on, and their hair parted in\r\nthe middle and down the back of the head, and brought over the ears in a\r\nbunch at each side, as was the English fashion in those days; and\r\nsubscribed to _Galignani\'s Messenger_; and had themselves proposed and\r\nseconded for the Cercle Anglais in the Rue Sainte-n\'y touche, a circle\r\nof British philistines of the very deepest dye; and went to hear divine\r\nservice on Sunday mornings in the Rue Marb\xc5\x93uf!\r\n\r\nIndeed, by the end of the summer they had sunk into such depths of\r\ndemoralization that they felt they must really have a change; and\r\ndecided on giving up the studio in the Place St. Anatole des Arts, and\r\nleaving Paris for good; and going to settle for the winter in\r\nD\xc3\xbcsseldorf, which is a very pleasant place for English painters who do\r\nnot wish to overwork themselves--as the Laird well knew, having spent a\r\nyear there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEMORALIZATION]\r\n\r\nIt ended in Taffy\'s going to Antwerp for the Kermesse, to paint the\r\nFlemish drunkard of our time just as he really is; and the Laird\'s going\r\nto Spain, so that he might study toreadors from the life.\r\n\r\nI may as well state here that the Laird\'s toreador pictures, which had\r\nhad quite a vogue in Scotland as long as he had been content to paint\r\nthem in the Place St. Anatole des Arts, quite ceased to please (or sell)\r\nafter he had been to Seville and Madrid; so he took to painting Roman\r\ncardinals and Neapolitan pifferari from the depths of his\r\nconsciousness--and was so successful that he made up his mind he would\r\nnever spoil his market by going to Italy!\r\n\r\nSo he went and painted his cardinals and his pifferari in Algiers; and\r\nTaffy joined him there, and painted Algerian Jews--just as they really\r\nare (and didn\'t sell them); and then they spent a year in Munich, and\r\nthen a year in D\xc3\xbcsseldorf, and a winter in Cairo, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd all this time Taffy, who took everything _au grand\r\ns\xc3\xa9rieux_--especially the claims and obligations of\r\nfriendship--corresponded regularly with Little Billee, who wrote him\r\nlong and amusing letters back again, and had plenty to say about his\r\nlife in London--which was a series of triumphs, artistic and social--and\r\nyou would have thought from his letters, modest though they were, that\r\nno happier young man, or more elate, was to be found anywhere in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt was a good time in England, just then, for young artists of promise;\r\na time of evolution, revolution, change, and development--of the\r\nfounding of new schools and the crumbling away of old ones--a keen\r\nstruggle for existence--a surviving of the fit--a preparation, let us\r\nhope, for the ultimate survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nAnd among the many glories of this particular period two names stand out\r\nvery conspicuously--for the immediate and (so far) lasting fame their\r\nbearers achieved, and the wide influence they exerted, and continue to\r\nexert still.\r\n\r\nThe world will not easily forget Frederic Walker and William Bagot,\r\nthose two singularly gifted boys, whom it soon became the fashion to\r\nbracket together, to compare and to contrast, as one compares and\r\ncontrasts Thackeray and Dickens, Carlyle and Macaulay, Tennyson and\r\nBrowning--a futile though pleasant practice, of which the temptations\r\nseem irresistible!\r\n\r\nYet why compare the lily and the rose?\r\n\r\nThese two young masters had the genius and the luck to be the\r\nprogenitors of much of the best art-work that has been done in England\r\nduring the last thirty years, in oils, in water-color, in black and\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThey were both essentially English and of their own time; both\r\nabsolutely original, receiving their impressions straight from nature\r\nitself; uninfluenced by any school, ancient or modern, they founded\r\nschools instead of following any, and each was a law unto himself, and a\r\nlaw-giver unto many others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRED WALKER]\r\n\r\nBoth were equally great in whatever they attempted--landscape, figures,\r\nbirds, beasts, or fishes. Who does not remember the fish-monger\'s shop\r\nby F. Walker, or W. Bagot\'s little piebald piglings, and their venerable\r\nblack mother, and their immense, fat, wallowing pink papa? An ineffable\r\ncharm of poetry and refinement, of pathos and sympathy and delicate\r\nhumor combined, an incomparable ease and grace and felicity of\r\nworkmanship belong to each; and yet in their work are they not as wide\r\napart as the poles; each complete in himself and yet a complement to the\r\nother?\r\n\r\nAnd, oddly enough, they were both singularly alike in aspect--both small\r\nand slight, though beautifully made, with tiny hands and feet; always\r\narrayed as the lilies of the field, for all they toiled and spun so\r\narduously; both had regularly featured faces of a noble cast and most\r\nwinning character; both had the best and simplest manners in the world,\r\nand a way of getting themselves much and quickly and permanently\r\nliked....\r\n\r\n_Que la terre leur soit l\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa8re!_\r\n\r\nAnd who can say that the fame of one is greater than the other\'s!\r\n\r\nTheir pinnacles are twin, I venture to believe--of just an equal height\r\nand width and thickness, like their bodies in this life; but unlike\r\ntheir frail bodies in one respect: no taller pinnacles are to be seen,\r\nmethinks, in all the garden of the deathless dead painters of our time,\r\nand none more built to last!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it is not with the art of Little Billee, nor with his fame as a\r\npainter, that we are chiefly concerned in this unpretending little tale,\r\nexcept in so far as they have some bearing on his character and his\r\nfate.\r\n\r\n"I should like to know the detailed history of the Englishman\'s first\r\nlove, and how he lost his innocence!"\r\n\r\n"Ask him!"\r\n\r\n"Ask him yourself!"\r\n\r\nThus Papelard and Bouchardy, on the morning of Little Billee\'s first\r\nappearance at Carrel\'s studio, in the Rue des Potirons St. Michel.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the question the present scribe is doing his little best to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA good-looking, famous, well-bred, and well-dressed youth finds that\r\nLondon Society opens its doors very readily; he hasn\'t long to knock;\r\nand it would be difficult to find a youth more fortunately situated,\r\nhandsomer, more famous, better dressed or better bred, more seemingly\r\nhappy and successful, with more attractive qualities and more condonable\r\nfaults, than Little Billee, as Taffy and the Laird found him when they\r\ncame to London after their four or five years in foreign parts--their\r\nWanderjahr.\r\n\r\nHe had a fine studio and a handsome suite of rooms in Fitzroy Square.\r\nBeautiful specimens of his unfinished work, endless studies, hung on his\r\nstudio walls. Everything else was as nice as it could be--the furniture,\r\nthe bibelots, and bric-\xc3\xa0-brac, the artistic foreign and Eastern\r\nknick-knacks and draperies and hangings and curtains and rugs--the\r\nsemi-grand piano by Collard & Collard.\r\n\r\nThat immortal canvas, the "Moon-Dial" (just begun, and already\r\ncommissioned by Moses Lyon, the famous picture-dealer), lay on his\r\neasel.\r\n\r\nNo man worked harder and with teeth more clinched than Little Billee\r\nwhen he was at work--none rested or played more discreetly when it was\r\ntime to rest or play.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATONIC LOVE]\r\n\r\nThe glass on his mantel-piece was full of cards of invitation,\r\nreminders, pretty mauve and pink and lilac-scented notes; nor were\r\ncoronets wanting on many of these hospitable little missives. He had\r\nquite overcome his fancied aversion for bloated dukes and lords and the\r\nrest (we all do sooner or later, if things go well with us); especially\r\nfor their wives and sisters and daughters and female cousins; even their\r\nmothers and aunts. In point of fact, and in spite of his tender years,\r\nhe was in some danger (for his art) of developing into that type adored\r\nby sympathetic women who haven\'t got much to do: the friend, the tame\r\ncat, the platonic lover (with many loves)--the squire of dames, the\r\ntrusty one, of whom husbands and brothers have no fear!--the delicate,\r\nharmless dilettante of Eros--the dainty shepherd who dwells "dans le\r\npays du tendre!"--and stops there!\r\n\r\nThe woman flatters and the man confides--and there is no danger\r\nwhatever, I\'m told--and I am glad!\r\n\r\nOne man loves his fiddle (or, alas! his neighbor\'s sometimes) for all\r\nthe melodies he can wake from it--it is but a selfish love!\r\n\r\nAnother, who is no fiddler, may love a fiddle too; for its symmetry, its\r\nneatness, its color--its delicate grainings, the lovely lines and curves\r\nof its back and front--for its own sake, so to speak. He may have a\r\nwhole galleryful of fiddles to love in this innocent way--a harem!--and\r\nyet not know a single note of music, or even care to hear one. He will\r\ndust them and stroke them, and take them down and try to put them in\r\ntune--pizzicato!--and put them back again, and call them ever such sweet\r\nlittle pet names: viol, viola, viola d\'amore, viol di gamba, violino\r\nmio! and breathe his little troubles into them, and they will give back\r\ninaudible little murmurs in sympathetic response, like a damp \xc3\x86olian\r\nharp; but he will never draw a bow across the strings, nor wake a single\r\nchord--or discord!\r\n\r\nAnd who shall say he is not wise in his generation? It is but an\r\nold-fashioned philistine notion that fiddles were only made to be played\r\non--the fiddles themselves are beginning to resent it; and rightly, I\r\nwot!\r\n\r\nIn this harmless fashion Little Billee was friends with more than one\r\nfine lady _de par le monde_.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he had been reproached by his more bohemian brothers of the\r\nbrush for being something of a tuft-hunter--most unjustly. But nothing\r\ngives such keen offence to our unsuccessful brother, bohemian or\r\nbourgeois, as our sudden intimacy with the so-called great, the little\r\nlords and ladies of this little world! Not even our fame and success,\r\nand all the joy and pride they bring us, are so hard to condone--so\r\nimbittering, so humiliating, to the jealous fraternal heart.\r\n\r\nAlas! poor humanity--that the mere countenance of our betters (if they\r\n_are_ our betters!) should be thought so priceless a boon, so consummate\r\nan achievement, so crowning a glory, as all that!\r\n\r\n    "A dirty bit of orange-peel,\r\n         The stump of a cigar--\r\n     Once trod on by a princely heel,\r\n         How beautiful they are!"\r\n\r\nLittle Billee was no tuft-hunter--he was the tuft-hunted, or had been.\r\nNo one of his kind was ever more persistently, resolutely, hospitably\r\nharried than this young "hare with many friends" by people of rank and\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nAnd at first he thought them most charming; as they so often are, these\r\ngraceful, gracious, gay, good-natured stoics and barbarians, whose\r\nmanners are as easy and simple as their morals--but how much\r\nbetter!--and who, at least, have this charm, that they can wallow in\r\nuntold gold (when they happen to possess it) without ever seeming to\r\nstink of the same: yes, they bear wealth gracefully--and the want of it\r\nmore gracefully still! and these are pretty accomplishments that have\r\nyet to be learned by our new aristocracy of the shop and counting-house,\r\nJew or gentile, which is everywhere elbowing its irresistible way to\r\nthe top and front of everything, both here and abroad.\r\n\r\nThen he discovered that, much as you might be with them, you could never\r\nbe _of_ them, unless perchance you managed to hook on by marrying one of\r\ntheir ugly ducklings--their failures--their remnants! and even then life\r\nisn\'t all beer and skittles for a rank outsider, I\'m told! Then he\r\ndiscovered that he didn\'t want to be of them in the least; especially at\r\nsuch a cost as that! and that to be very much with them was apt to pall,\r\nlike everything else.\r\n\r\nAlso, he found that they were very mixed; good, bad, and\r\nindifferent--and not always very dainty or select in their\r\npredilections, since they took unto their bosoms such queer outsiders\r\n(just for the sake of being amused a little while) that their capricious\r\nfavor ceased to be an honor and a glory--if it ever was! And, then,\r\ntheir fickleness!\r\n\r\nIndeed, he found, or thought he found, that they could be just as\r\nclever, as liberal, as polite or refined--as narrow, insolent,\r\nswaggering, coarse, and vulgar--as handsome, as ugly--as graceful, as\r\nungainly--as modest or conceited, as any other upper class of the\r\ncommunity--and, indeed, some lower ones!\r\n\r\nBeautiful young women, who had been taught how to paint pretty little\r\nlandscapes (with an ivy-mantled ruin in the middle distance), talked\r\ntechnically of painting to him, _de pair \xc3\xa0 pair_, as though they were\r\nquite on the same artistic level, and didn\'t mind admitting it, in spite\r\nof the social gulf between.\r\n\r\nHideous old frumps (osseous or obese, yet with unduly bared neck, and\r\nshoulders that made him sick) patronized him and gave him good advice,\r\nand told him to emulate Mr. Buckner both in his genius and his\r\nmanners--since Mr. Buckner was the only "gentleman" who ever painted for\r\nhire; and they promised him, in time, an equal success!\r\n\r\nHere and there some sweet old darling specially enslaved him by her\r\nkindness, grace, knowledge of life, and tender womanly sympathy, like\r\nthe dowager Lady Chiselhurst--or some sweet young one, like the lovely\r\nDuchess of Towers, by her beauty, wit, good-humor, and sisterly interest\r\nin all he did, and who in some vague, distant manner constantly reminded\r\nhim of Trilby, although she was such a great and fashionable lady!\r\n\r\nBut just such darlings, old or young, were to be found, with still\r\nhigher ideals, in less exalted spheres; and were easier of access, with\r\nno impassable gulf between--spheres where there was no patronizing,\r\nnothing but deference and warm appreciation and delicate flattery, from\r\nmen and women alike--and where the aged Venuses, whose prime was of the\r\ndays of Waterloo, went with their historical remains duly shrouded, like\r\nivy-mantled ruins (and in the middle distance!).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "DARLINGS, OLD OR YOUNG"]\r\n\r\nSo he actually grew tired of the great before they had time to tire of\r\nhim--incredible as it may seem, and against nature; and this saved him\r\nmany a heart-burning; and he ceased to be seen at fashionable drums or\r\ngatherings of any kind, except in one or two houses where he was\r\nespecially liked and made welcome for his own sake; such as Lord\r\nChiselhurst\'s in Piccadilly, where the "Moon-Dial" found a home for a\r\nfew years, before going to its last home and final resting-place in the\r\nNational Gallery (R. I. P.); or Baron Stoppenheim\'s in Cavendish Square,\r\nwhere many lovely little water-colors signed W. B. occupied places of\r\nhonor on gorgeously gilded walls; or the gorgeously gilded bachelor\r\nrooms of Mr. Moses Lyon, the picture-dealer in Upper Conduit Street--for\r\nLittle Billee (I much grieve to say it of a hero of romance) was an\r\nexcellent man of business. That infinitesimal dose of the good old\r\nOriental blood kept him straight, and not only made him stick to his\r\nlast through thick and thin, but also to those whose foot his last was\r\nfound to match (for he couldn\'t or wouldn\'t alter his last).\r\n\r\nHe loved to make as much money as he could, that he might spend it\r\nroyally in pretty gifts to his mother and sister, whom it was his\r\npleasure to load in this way, and whose circumstances had been very much\r\naltered by his quick success. There was never a more generous son or\r\nbrother than Little Billee of the clouded heart, that couldn\'t love any\r\nlonger!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a set-off to all these splendors, it was also his pleasure now and\r\nagain to study London life at its lower end--the eastest end of all.\r\nWhitechapel, the Minories, the Docks, Ratcliffe Highway, Rotherhithe,\r\nsoon got to know him well, and he found much to interest him and much to\r\nlike among their denizens, and made as many friends there among\r\nship-carpenters, excisemen, longshoremen, jack-tars, and what not, as in\r\nBayswater and Belgravia (or Bloomsbury).\r\n\r\nHe was especially fond of frequenting sing-songs, or "free-and-easys,"\r\nwhere good, hard-working fellows met of an evening to relax and smoke\r\nand drink and sing--round a table well loaded with steaming tumblers and\r\npewter pots, at one end of which sits Mr. Chairman in all his glory, and\r\nat the other "Mr. Vice." They are open to any one who can afford a pipe,\r\na screw of tobacco, and a pint of beer, and who is willing to do his\r\nbest and sing a song.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE MOON-DIAL"]\r\n\r\nNo introduction is needed; as soon as any one has seated himself and\r\nmade himself comfortable, Mr. Chairman taps the table with his long clay\r\npipe, begs for silence, and says to his vis-\xc3\xa0-vis: "Mr. Vice, it strikes\r\nme as the gen\'l\'man as is just come in \'as got a singing face. Per\'aps,\r\nMr. Vice, you\'ll be so very kind as juster harsk the aforesaid gen\'l\'man\r\nto oblige us with a \'armony."\r\n\r\nMr. Vice then puts it to the new-comer, who, thus appealed to, simulates\r\na modest surprise, and finally professes his willingness, like Mr.\r\nBarkis; then, clearing his throat a good many times, looks up to the\r\nceiling, and after one or two unsuccessful starts in different keys,\r\nbravely sings "Kathleen Mavourneen," let us say--perhaps in a touchingly\r\nsweet tenor voice:\r\n\r\n    "Kathleen Mavourneen, the gry dawn is brykin\',\r\n     The \'orn of the \'unter is \'eard on the \'ill." ...\r\n\r\nAnd Little Billee didn\'t mind the dropping of all these aitches if the\r\nvoice was sympathetic and well in tune, and the sentiment simple,\r\ntender, and sincere.\r\n\r\nOr else, with a good rolling jingo bass, it was,\r\n\r\n    "\'Earts o\' hoak are our ships; \'earts o\' hoak are our men;\r\n      And we\'ll fight and we\'ll conkwer agen and agen!"\r\n\r\nAnd no imperfection of accent, in Little Billee\'s estimation, subtracted\r\none jot from the manly British pluck that found expression in these\r\nnoble sentiments--nor added one tittle to their swaggering, blatant, and\r\nidiotically aggressive vulgarity!\r\n\r\nWell, the song finishes with general applause all round. Then the\r\nchairman says, "Your \'ealth and song, sir!" And drinks, and all do the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Vice asks, "What shall we \'ave the pleasure of saying, sir,\r\nafter that very nice \'armony?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAIRMAN]\r\n\r\nAnd the blushing vocalist, if he knows the ropes, replies, "A roast\r\nleg o\' mutton in Newgate, and nobody to eat it!" Or else, "May \'im as is\r\ngoing up the \'ill o\' prosperity never meet a friend coming down!" Or\r\nelse, "\'Ere\'s to \'er as shares our sorrers and doubles our joys!" Or\r\nelse, "\'Ere\'s to \'er as shares our joys and doubles our expenses!" and\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\nMore drink, more applause, and many \'ear, \'ears. And Mr. Vice says to\r\nthe singer: "You call, sir. Will you be so good as to call on some other\r\ngen\'l\'man for a \'armony?" And so the evening goes on.\r\n\r\nAnd nobody was more quickly popular at such gatherings, or sang better\r\nsongs, or proposed more touching sentiments, or filled either chair or\r\nvice-chair with more grace and dignity than Little Billee. Not even\r\nDodor or l\'Zouzou could have beaten him at that.\r\n\r\nAnd he was as happy, as genial, and polite, as much at his ease, in\r\nthese humble gatherings as in the gilded saloons of the great, where\r\ngrand-pianos are, and hired accompanists, and highly-paid singers, and a\r\ngood deal of talk while they sing.\r\n\r\nSo his powers of quick, wide, universal sympathy grew and grew, and made\r\nup to him a little for his lost power of being specially fond of special\r\nindividuals. For he made no close friends among men, and ruthlessly\r\nsnubbed all attempts at intimacy--all advances towards an affection\r\nwhich he felt he could not return; and more than one enthusiastic\r\nadmirer of his talent and his charm was forced to acknowledge that, with\r\nall his gifts, he seemed heartless and capricious; as ready to drop you\r\nas he had been to take you up.\r\n\r\nHe loved to be wherever he could meet his kind, high or low; and felt as\r\nhappy on a penny steamer as on the yacht of a millionaire--on the\r\ncrowded knife-board of an omnibus as on the box-seat of a nobleman\'s\r\ndrag--happier; he liked to feel the warm contact of his fellow-man at\r\neither shoulder and at his back, and didn\'t object to a little honest\r\ngrime! And I think all this genial caressing love of his kind, this\r\ndepth and breath of human sympathy, are patent in all his work.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, he came to prefer for society that of the best\r\nand cleverest of his own class--those who live and prevail by the\r\nprofessional exercise of their own specially trained and highly educated\r\nwits, the skilled workmen of the brain--from the Lord Chief-Justice of\r\nEngland downward--the salt of the earth, in his opinion: and stuck to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere is no class so genial and sympathetic as _our own_, in the\r\nlong-run--even if it be but the criminal class! none where the welcome\r\nis likely to be so genuine and sincere, so easy to win, so difficult to\r\noutstay, if we be but decently pleasant and successful; none where the\r\nmemory of us will be kept so green (if we leave any memory at all!).\r\n\r\nSo Little Billee found it expedient, when he wanted rest and play, to\r\nseek them at the houses of those whose rest and play were like his\r\nown--little halts in a seeming happy life-journey, full of toil and\r\nstrain and endeavor; oases of sweet water and cooling shade, where the\r\nfood was good and plentiful, though the tents might not be of cloth of\r\ngold; where the talk was of something more to his taste than court or\r\nsport or narrow party politics; the new beauty; the coming match of the\r\nseason; the coming ducal conversion to Rome; the last elopement in high\r\nlife--the next! and where the music was that of the greatest\r\nmusic-makers that can be, who found rest and play in making better music\r\nfor love than they ever made for hire--and were listened to as they\r\nshould be, with understanding and religious silence, and all the fervent\r\ngratitude they deserved.\r\n\r\nThere were several such houses in London then--and are still--thank\r\nHeaven! And Little Billee had his little billet there--and there he was\r\nwont to drown himself in waves of lovely sound, or streams of clever\r\ntalk, or rivers of sweet feminine adulation, seas! oceans!--a somewhat\r\nrelaxing bath!--and forget for a while his everlasting chronic plague of\r\nheart-insensibility, which no doctor could explain or cure, and to which\r\nhe was becoming gradually resigned--as one does to deafness or blindness\r\nor locomotor ataxia--for it had lasted nearly five years! But now and\r\nagain, during sleep, and in a blissful dream, the lost power of\r\nloving--of loving mother, sister, friend--would be restored to him; just\r\nas with a blind man who sometimes dreams he has recovered his sight; and\r\nthe joy of it would wake him to the sad reality: till he got to know,\r\neven in his dream, that he was only dreaming, after all, whenever that\r\npriceless boon seemed to be his own once more--and did his utmost not to\r\nwake. And these were nights to be marked with a white stone, and\r\nremembered!\r\n\r\nAnd nowhere was he happier than at the houses of the great surgeons and\r\nphysicians who interested themselves in his strange disease. When the\r\nLittle Billees of this world fall ill, the great surgeons and physicians\r\n(like the great singers and musicians) do better for them, out of mere\r\nlove and kindness, than for the princes of the earth, who pay them\r\nthousand-guinea fees and load them with honors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd of all these notable London houses none was pleasanter than that of\r\nCornelys the great sculptor, and Little Billee was such a favorite in\r\nthat house that he was able to take his friends Taffy and the Laird\r\nthere the very day they came to London.\r\n\r\nFirst of all they dined together at a delightful little Franco-Italian\r\npothouse near Leicester Square, where they had bouillabaisse (imagine\r\nthe Laird\'s delight), and spaghetti, and a poulet r\xc3\xb4ti, which is _such_\r\na different affair from a roast fowl! and salad, which Taffy was allowed\r\nto make and mix himself; and they all smoked just where they sat, the\r\nmoment they had swallowed their food--as had been their way in the good\r\nold Paris days.\r\n\r\nThat dinner was a happy one for Taffy and the Laird, with their Little\r\nBillee apparently unchanged--as demonstrative, as genial, and caressing\r\nas ever, and with no swagger to speak of; and with so many things to\r\ntalk about that were new to them, and of such delightful interest! They\r\nalso had much to say--but they didn\'t say very much about Paris, for\r\nfear of waking up Heaven knows what sleeping dogs!\r\n\r\nAnd every now and again, in the midst of all this pleasant foregathering\r\nand communion of long-parted friends, the pangs of Little Billee\'s\r\nmiserable mind-malady would shoot through him like poisoned arrows.\r\n\r\nHe would catch himself thinking how fat and fussy and serious about\r\ntrifles Taffy had become; and what a shiftless, feckless, futile duffer\r\nwas the Laird; and how greedy they both were, and how red and coarse\r\ntheir ears and gills and cheeks grew as they fed, and how shiny their\r\nfaces; and how little he would care, try as he might, if they both fell\r\ndown dead under the table! And this would make him behave more\r\ncaressingly to them, more genially and demonstratively than ever--for he\r\nknew it was all a grewsome physical ailment of his own, which he could\r\nno more help than a cataract in his eye!\r\n\r\nThen, catching sight of his own face and form in a mirror, he would\r\ncurse himself for a puny, misbegotten shrimp, an imp--an abortion--no\r\nbigger, by the side of the herculean Taffy or the burly Laird of\r\nCockpen, than six-pennorth o\' half-pence: a wretched little overrated\r\nfollower of a poor trivial craft--a mere light amuser! For what did\r\npictures matter, or whether they were good or bad, except to the\r\ntriflers who painted them, the dealers who sold them, the idle,\r\nuneducated, purse-proud fools who bought them and stuck them up on their\r\nwalls because they were told!\r\n\r\nAnd he felt that if a dynamite shell were beneath the table where they\r\nsat, and its fuse were smoking under their very noses, he would neither\r\nwish to warn his friends nor move himself. He didn\'t care a d----!\r\n\r\nAnd all this made him so lively and brilliant in his talk, so\r\nfascinating and droll and witty, that Taffy and the Laird wondered at\r\nthe improvement success and the experience of life had wrought in him,\r\nand marvelled at the happiness of his lot, and almost found it in their\r\nwarm, affectionate hearts to feel a touch of envy!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HAPPY DINNER]\r\n\r\nOddly enough, in a brief flash of silence, "entre la poire et le\r\nfromage," they heard a foreigner at an adjoining table (one of a very\r\nnoisy group) exclaim: "Mais quand je vous dis que j\'l\'ai entendue, moi,\r\nla Svengali! et m\xc3\xaame qu\'elle a chant\xc3\xa9 l\'Impromptu de Chopin absolument\r\ncomme si c\'\xc3\xa9tait un piano qu\'on jouait! voyons!..."\r\n\r\n"Farceur! la bonne blague!" said another--and then the conversation\r\nbecame so noisily general it was no good listening any more.\r\n\r\n"Svengali! how funny that name should turn up! I wonder what\'s become of\r\n_our_ Svengali, by-the-way?" observed Taffy.\r\n\r\n"I remember _his_ playing Chopin\'s Impromptu," said Little Billee; "what\r\na singular coincidence!"\r\n\r\nThere were to be more coincidences that night; it never rains them but\r\nit pours!\r\n\r\nSo our three friends finished their coffee and liqueured up, and went to\r\nCornelys\'s, three in a hansom--\r\n\r\n                            "Like Mars,\r\n    A-smokin\' their poipes and cigyars."\r\n\r\nSir Louis Cornelys, as everybody knows, lives in a palace on Campden\r\nHill, a house of many windows; and whichever window he looks out of, he\r\nsees his own garden and very little else. In spite of his eighty years,\r\nhe works as hard as ever, and his hand has lost but little of its\r\ncunning. But he no longer gives those splendid parties that made him\r\nalmost as famous a host as he was an artist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "A-SMOKIN\' THEIR POIPES AND CIGYARS"]\r\n\r\nWhen his beautiful wife died he shut himself up from the world; and\r\nnow he never stirs out of his house and grounds except to fulfil his\r\nduties at the Royal Academy and dine once a year with the Queen.\r\n\r\nIt was very different in the early sixties. There was no pleasanter or\r\nmore festive house than his in London, winter or summer--no lordlier\r\nhost than he--no more irresistible hostesses than Lady Cornelys and her\r\nlovely daughters; and if ever music had a right to call itself divine,\r\nit was there you heard it--on late Saturday nights during the London\r\nseason--when the foreign birds of song come over to reap their harvest\r\nin London Town.\r\n\r\nIt was on one of the most brilliant of these Saturday nights that Taffy\r\nand the Laird, chaperoned by Little Billee, made their d\xc3\xa9but at Mechelen\r\nLodge, and were received at the door of the immense music-room by a\r\ntall, powerful man with splendid eyes and a gray beard, and a small\r\nvelvet cap on his head--and by a Greek matron so beautiful and stately\r\nand magnificently attired that they felt inclined to sink them on their\r\nbended knees as in the presence of some overwhelming Eastern\r\nroyalty--and were only prevented from doing so, perhaps, by the simple,\r\nsweet, and cordial graciousness of her welcome.\r\n\r\nAnd whom should they be shaking hands with next but Antony, Lorrimer,\r\nand the Greek--with each a beard and mustache of nearly five years\'\r\ngrowth!\r\n\r\nBut they had no time for much exuberant greeting, for there was a sudden\r\npiano crash--and then an immediate silence, as though for pins to\r\ndrop--and Signor Giuglini and the wondrous maiden Adelina Patti sang the\r\nMiserere out of Signor Verdi\'s most famous opera--to the delight of all\r\nbut a few very superior ones who had just read Mendelssohn\'s letters (or\r\nmisread them) and despised Italian music; and thought cheaply of "mere\r\nvirtuosity," either vocal or instrumental.\r\n\r\nWhen this was over, Little Billee pointed out all the lions to his\r\nfriends--from the Prime Minister down to the present scribe--who was\r\nright glad to meet them again and talk of auld lang syne, and present\r\nthem to the daughters of the house and other charming ladies.\r\n\r\nThen Roucouly, the great French barytone, sang Durien\'s favorite song,\r\n\r\n    "Plaisir d\'amour ne dure qu\'un moment;\r\n     Chagrin d\'amour dure toute la vie...."\r\n\r\nwith quite a little drawing-room voice--but quite as divinely as he had\r\nsung "No\xc3\xabl, no\xc3\xabl," at the Madeleine in full blast one certain Christmas\r\nEve our three friends remembered well.\r\n\r\nThen there was a violin solo by young Joachim, then as now the greatest\r\nviolinist of his time; and a solo on the piano-forte by Madame Schumann,\r\nhis only peeress! and these came as a wholesome check to the levity of\r\nthose for whom all music is but an agreeable pastime, a mere emotional\r\ndelight, in which the intellect has no part; and also as a well-deserved\r\nhumiliation to all virtuosi who play so charmingly that they make their\r\nlisteners forget the master who invented the music in the lesser master\r\nwho interprets it!\r\n\r\nFor these two--man and woman--the highest of their kind, never let you\r\nforget it was Sebastian Bach they were playing--playing in absolute\r\nperfection, in absolute forgetfulness of themselves--so that if you\r\nweren\'t up to Bach, you didn\'t have a very good time!\r\n\r\nBut if you were (or wished it to be understood or thought you were), you\r\nseized your opportunity and you scored; and by the earnestness of your\r\nrapt and tranced immobility, and the stony, gorgon-like intensity of\r\nyour gaze, you rebuked the frivolous--as you had rebuked them before by\r\nthe listlessness and carelessness of your bored resignation to the\r\nSignorina Patti\'s trills and fioritures, or M. Roucouly\'s pretty little\r\nFrench mannerisms.\r\n\r\nAnd what added so much to the charm of this delightful concert was that\r\nthe guests were not packed together sardinewise, as they are at most\r\nconcerts; they were comparatively few and well chosen, and could get up\r\nand walk about and talk to their friends between the pieces, and wander\r\noff into other rooms and look at endless beautiful things, and stroll in\r\nthe lovely grounds, by moon or star or Chinese-lantern light.\r\n\r\nAnd there the frivolous could sit and chat and laugh and flirt when Bach\r\nwas being played inside; and the earnest wander up and down together in\r\nsoul-communion, through darkened walks and groves and alleys where the\r\nsound of French or Italian warblings could not reach them, and talk in\r\nearnest tones of the great Zola, or Guy de Maupassant and Pierre Loti,\r\nand exult in beautiful English over the inferiority of English\r\nliterature, English art, English music, English everything else.\r\n\r\nFor these high-minded ones who can only bear the sight of classical\r\npictures and the sound of classical music do not necessarily read\r\nclassical books in any language--no Shakespeares or Dantes or Moli\xc3\xa8res\r\nor Goethes for _them_. They know a trick worth two of that!\r\n\r\nAnd the mere fact that these three immortal French writers of light\r\nbooks I have just named had never been heard of at this particular\r\nperiod doesn\'t very much matter; they had cognate predecessors whose\r\nnames I happen to forget. Any stick will do to beat a dog with, and\r\nhistory is always repeating itself.\r\n\r\nFeydeau, or Flaubert, let us say--or for those who don\'t know French and\r\ncultivate an innocent mind, Miss Austen (for to be dead and buried is\r\nalmost as good as to be French and immoral!)--and Sebastian Bach, and\r\nSandro Botticelli--that all the arts should be represented. These names\r\nare rather discrepant, but they made very good sticks for dog-beating;\r\nand with a thorough knowledge and appreciation of these (or the\r\nsemblance thereof), you were well equipped in those days to hold your\r\nown among the elect of intellectual London circles, and snub the\r\nphilistine to rights.\r\n\r\nThen, very late, a tall, good-looking, swarthy foreigner came in, with a\r\nroll of music in his hands, and his entrance made quite a stir; you\r\nheard all round, "Here\'s Glorioli," or "Ecco Glorioli," or "Voici\r\nGlorioli," till Glorioli got on your nerves. And beautiful ladies,\r\nambassadresses, female celebrities of all kinds, fluttered up to him\r\nand cajoled and fawned;--as Svengali would have said, "Prinzessen,\r\nComtessen, Serene English Altessen!"--and they soon forgot their\r\nHighness and their Serenity!\r\n\r\nFor with very little pressing Glorioli stood up on the platform, with\r\nhis accompanist by his side at the piano, and in his hands a sheet of\r\nmusic, at which he never looked. He looked at the beautiful ladies, and\r\nogled and smiled; and from his scarcely parted, moist, thick, bearded\r\nlips, which he always licked before singing, there issued the most\r\nravishing sounds that had ever been heard from throat of man or woman or\r\nboy! He could sing both high and low and soft and loud, and the\r\nfrivolous were bewitched, as was only to be expected; but even the\r\nearnestest of all, caught, surprised, rapt, astounded, shaken, tickled,\r\nteased, harrowed, tortured, tantalized, aggravated, seduced,\r\ndemoralized, corrupted into naturalness, forgot to dissemble their\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nAnd Sebastian Bach (the especially adored of all really great musicians,\r\nand also, alas! of many priggish outsiders who don\'t know a single note\r\nand can\'t remember a single tune) was well forgotten for the night; and\r\nwho were more enthusiastic than the two great players who had been\r\nplaying Bach that evening? For these, at all events, were broad and\r\ncatholic and sincere, and knew what was beautiful, whatever its kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "BONJOUR, SUZON!"]\r\n\r\nIt was but a simple little song that Glorioli sang, as light and pretty\r\nas it could well be, almost worthy of the words it was written to, and\r\nthe words are De Musset\'s; and I love them so much I cannot resist the\r\ntemptation of setting them down here, for the mere sensuous delight of\r\nwriting them, as though I had just composed them myself:\r\n\r\n    "Bonjour, Suzon, ma fleur des bois!\r\n       Es-tu toujours la plus jolie?\r\n     Je reviens, tel que tu me vois,\r\n       D\'un grand voyage en Italie!\r\n     Du paradis j\'ai fait le tour--\r\n     J\'ai fait des vers--j\'ai fait l\'amour....\r\n           Mais que t\'importe!\r\n           Mais que t\'importe!\r\n     Je passe devant ta maison:\r\n           Ouvre ta porte!\r\n           Ouvre ta porte!\r\n             Bonjour, Suzon!\r\n\r\n     "Je t\'ai vue au temps des lilas.\r\n       Ton c\xc5\x93ur joyeux venait d\'\xc3\xa9clore,\r\n     Et tu disais: \'je ne veux pas,\r\n       Je ne veux pas qu\'on m\'aime encore.\'\r\n     Qu\'as-tu fait depuis mon d\xc3\xa9part?\r\n     Qui part trop t\xc3\xb4t revient trop tard.\r\n           Mais que m\'importe?\r\n           Mais que m\'importe?\r\n     Je passe devant ta maison:\r\n           Ouvre ta porte!\r\n           Ouvre ta porte!\r\n             Bonjour, Suzon!"\r\n\r\nAnd when it began, and while it lasted, and after it was over, one felt\r\nreally sorry for all the other singers. And nobody sang any more that\r\nnight; for Glorioli was tired, and wouldn\'t sing again, and none were\r\nbold enough or disinterested enough to sing after him.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may remember that meteoric bird of song, who, though\r\na mere amateur, would condescend to sing for a hundred guineas in the\r\nsaloons of the great (as Monsieur Jourdain sold cloth); who would sing\r\nstill better for love and glory in the studios of his friends.\r\n\r\nFor Glorioli--the biggest, handsomest, and most distinguished-looking\r\nJew that ever was--one of the Sephardim (one of the Seraphim!)--hailed\r\nfrom Spain, where he was junior partner in the great firm of Moral\xc3\xa9s,\r\nPeral\xc3\xa9s, Gonzal\xc3\xa9s & Glorioli, wine-merchants, Malaga. He travelled for\r\nhis own firm; his wine was good, and he sold much of it in England. But\r\nhis voice would bring him far more gold in the month he spent here; for\r\nhis wines have been equalled--even surpassed--but there was no voice\r\nlike his anywhere in the world, and no more finished singer.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, his voice got into Little Billee\'s head more than any wine, and\r\nthe boy could talk of nothing else for days and weeks; and was so\r\nexuberant in his expressions of delight and gratitude that the great\r\nsinger took a real fancy to him (especially when he was told that this\r\nfervent boyish admirer was one of the greatest of English painters); and\r\nas a mark of his esteem, privately confided to him after supper that\r\nevery century two human nightingales were born--only two! a male and a\r\nfemale; and that he, Glorioli, was the representative "male rossignol of\r\nthis soi-disant dix-neuvi\xc3\xa8me si\xc3\xa8cle."\r\n\r\n"I can well believe that! And the female, your mate that should be--_la\r\nrossignolle_, if there is such a word?" inquired Little Billee.\r\n\r\n"Ah! mon ami ... it was Alboni till la petite Adelina Patti came out a\r\nyear or two ago; and now it is _la Svengali_."\r\n\r\n"La Svengali?"\r\n\r\n"Oui, mon fy! You will hear her some day--et vous m\'en direz des\r\nnouvelles!"\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t mean to say that she\'s got a better voice than Madame\r\nAlboni?"\r\n\r\n"Mon ami, an apple is an excellent thing--until you have tried a peach!\r\nHer voice to that of Alboni is as a peach to an apple--I give you my\r\nword of honor! but bah! the voice is a detail. It\'s what she does with\r\nit--it\'s incredible! it gives one cold all down the back! it drives you\r\nmad! it makes you weep hot tears by the spoonful! Ah! the tear, mon fy!\r\ntenez! I can draw everything but _that_! \xc3\x87a n\'est pas dans mes cordes!\r\n_I_ can only madden with _love_! But la Svengali!... And then, in the\r\nmiddle of it all, prrrout!... she makes you laugh! Ah! le beau rire!\r\nfaire rire avec des larmes plein les yeux--voil\xc3\xa0 qui me passe!... Mon\r\nami, when I heard her it made me swear that even _I_ would never try to\r\nsing any more--it seemed _too_ absurd! and I kept my word for a month at\r\nleast--and you know, je sais ce que je vaux, moi!"\r\n\r\n"You are talking of la Svengali, I bet," said Signor Spartia.\r\n\r\n"Oui, parbleu! You have heard her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--at Vienna last winter," rejoined the greatest singing-master in\r\nthe world. "J\'en suis fou! h\xc3\xa9las! I thought _I_ could teach a woman how\r\nto sing till I heard that blackguard Svengali\'s pupil. He has married\r\nher, they say!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HUMAN NIGHTINGALE]\r\n\r\n"That _blackguard_ Svengali!" exclaimed Little Billee ... "why, that\r\nmust be a Svengali I knew in Paris--a famous pianist! a friend of mine!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the man! also une fameuse crapule (sauf vot\' respect); his real\r\nname is Adler; his mother was a Polish singer; and he was a pupil at the\r\nLeipsic Conservatorio. But he\'s an immense artist, and a great\r\nsinging-master, to teach a woman like that! and such a woman! belle\r\ncomme un ange--mais b\xc3\xaate comme un pot. I tried to talk to her--all she\r\ncan say is \'ja wohl,\' or \'doch,\' or \'nein,\' or \'soh\'! not a word of\r\nEnglish or French or Italian, though she sings them, oh! but _divinely_!\r\nIt is \'_il bel canto_\' come back to the world after a hundred years...."\r\n\r\n"But what voice is it?" asked Little Billee.\r\n\r\n"Every voice a mortal woman can have--three octaves--four! and of such a\r\nquality that people who can\'t tell one tune from another cry with\r\npleasure at the mere sound of it directly they hear her; just like\r\nanybody else. Everything that Paganini could do with his violin she does\r\nwith her voice--only better--and what a voice! un vrai baume!"\r\n\r\n"Now I don\'t mind petting zat you are schbeaking of la Sfencali," said\r\nHerr Kreutzer, the famous composer, joining in. "Quelle merfeille, hein?\r\nI heard her in St. Betersburg, at ze Vinter Balace. Ze vomen all vent\r\nmat, and pulled off zeir bearls and tiamonts and kave zem to her--vent\r\ntown on zeir knees and gried and gissed her hants. She tit not say vun\r\nvort! She tit not efen schmile! Ze men schnifelled in ze gorners, and\r\nlooked at ze bictures, and tissempled--efen I, Johann Kreutzer! efen ze\r\nEmperor!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re joking," said Little Billee.\r\n\r\n"My vrent, I neffer choke ven I talk apout zinging. You vill hear her\r\nzum tay yourzellof, and you vill acree viz me zat zere are two classes\r\nof beoble who zing. In ze vun class, la Sfencali; in ze ozzer, all ze\r\nozzer zingers!"\r\n\r\n"And does she sing good music?"\r\n\r\n"I ton\'t know. _All_ music is koot ven _she_ zings it. I forket ze zong;\r\nI can only sink of ze zinger. Any koot zinger can zing a peautiful zong\r\nand kif bleasure, I zubboce! But I voot zooner hear la Sfencali zing a\r\nscale zan anypotty else zing ze most peautiful zong in ze vorldt--efen\r\nvun of my own! Zat is berhaps how zung ze crate Italian zingers of ze\r\nlast century. It vas a lost art, and she has found it; and she must haf\r\npecun to zing pefore she pecan to schpeak--or else she voot not haf hat\r\nze time to learn all zat she knows, for she is not yet zirty! She zings\r\nin Paris in Ogdoper, Gott sei dank! and gums here after Christmas to\r\nzing at Trury Lane. Chullien kifs her ten sousand bounts!"\r\n\r\n"I wonder, now! Why, that must be the woman I heard at Warsaw two years\r\nago--or three," said young Lord Witlow. "It was at Count Siloszech\'s.\r\nHe\'d heard her sing in the streets, with a tall, black-bearded ruffian,\r\nwho accompanied her on a guitar, and a little fiddling gypsy fellow. She\r\nwas a handsome woman, with hair down to her knees, but stupid as an owl.\r\nShe sang at Siloszech\'s, and all the fellows went mad and gave her their\r\nwatches and diamond studs and gold scarf-pins. By gad! I never heard or\r\nsaw anything like it. I don\'t know much about music myself--couldn\'t\r\ntell \'God Save the Queen\' from \'Pop Goes the Weasel,\' if the people\r\ndidn\'t get up and stand and take their hats off; but I was as mad as the\r\nrest--why, I gave her a little German silver vinaigrette I\'d just bought\r\nfor my wife; hanged if I didn\'t--and I was only just married, you know!\r\nIt\'s the peculiar twang of her voice, I suppose!"\r\n\r\nAnd hearing all this, Little Billee made up his mind that life had still\r\nsomething in store for him, since he would some day hear la Svengali.\r\nAnyhow, he wouldn\'t shoot himself till then!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus the night wore itself away. The Prinzessen, Comtessen, and Serene\r\nEnglish Altessen (and other ladies of less exalted rank) departed home\r\nin cabs and carriages; and hostess and daughters went to bed. Late\r\nsitters of the ruder sex supped again, and smoked and chatted and\r\nlistened to comic songs and recitations by celebrated actors. Noble\r\ndukes hobnobbed with low comedians; world-famous painters and sculptors\r\nsat at the feet of Hebrew capitalists and aitchless millionaires.\r\nJudges, cabinet ministers, eminent physicians, and warriors and\r\nphilosophers saw Sunday morning steal over Campden Hill and through the\r\nmany windows of Mechelen Lodge, and listened to the pipe of\r\nhalf-awakened birds, and smelled the freshness of the dark summer dawn.\r\nAnd as Taffy and the Laird walked home to the Old Hummums by daylight,\r\nthey felt that last night was ages ago, and that since then they had\r\nforegathered with "much there was of the best in London." And then they\r\nreflected that "much there was of the best in London" were still\r\nstrangers to them--except by reputation--for there had not been time for\r\nmany introductions: and this had made them feel a little out of it; and\r\nthey found they hadn\'t had such a very good time after all. And there\r\nwere no cabs. And they were tired, and their boots were tight.\r\n\r\nAnd the last they had seen of Little Billee before leaving was a glimpse\r\nof their old friend in a corner of Lady Cornelys\'s boudoir, gravely\r\nplaying cup-and-ball with Fred Walker for sixpences--both so rapt in the\r\ngame that they were unconscious of anything else, and both playing so\r\nwell (with either hand) that they might have been professional\r\nchampions!\r\n\r\nAnd that saturnine young sawbones, Jakes Talboys (now Sir Jakes, and one\r\nof the most genial of Her Majesty\'s physicians), who sometimes after\r\nsupper and champagne was given to thoughtful, sympathetic, and acute\r\nobservation of his fellow-men, remarked to the Laird in a whisper that\r\nwas almost convivial: "Rather an enviable pair! Their united ages amount\r\nto forty-eight or so, their united weights to about fifteen stone, and\r\nthey couldn\'t carry you or me between them. But if you were to roll all\r\nthe other brains that have been under this roof to-night into one, you\r\nwouldn\'t reach the sum of their united genius.... I wonder which of the\r\ntwo is the most unhappy!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe season over, the song-birds flown, summer on the wane, his picture,\r\nthe "Moon-Dial," sent to Moses Lyon\'s (the picture-dealer in Conduit\r\nStreet), Little Billee felt the time had come to go and see his mother\r\nand sister in Devonshire, and make the sun shine twice as brightly for\r\nthem during a month or so, and the dew fall softer!\r\n\r\nSo one fine August morning found him at the Great Western Station--the\r\nnicest station in all London, I think--except the stations that book you\r\nto France and far away.\r\n\r\nIt always seems so pleasant to be going west! Little Billee loved that\r\nstation, and often went there for a mere stroll, to watch the people\r\nstarting on their westward way, following the sun towards Heaven knows\r\nwhat joys or sorrows, and envy them their sorrows or their joys--any\r\nsorrows or joys that were not merely physical, like a chocolate drop or\r\na pretty tune, a bad smell or a toothache.\r\n\r\nAnd as he took a seat in a second-class carriage (it would be third in\r\nthese democratic days), south corner, back to the engine, with _Silas\r\nMarner_, and Darwin\'s _Origin of Species_ (which he was reading for the\r\nthird time), and _Punch_, and other literature of a lighter kind, to\r\nbeguile him on his journey, he felt rather bitterly how happy he could\r\nbe if the little spot, or knot, or blot, or clot which paralyzed that\r\nconvolution of his brain where he kept his affections could but be\r\nconjured away!\r\n\r\nThe dearest mother, the dearest sister in the world, in the dearest\r\nlittle sea-side village (or town) that ever was! and other dear\r\npeople--especially Alice, sweet Alice with hair so brown, his sister\'s\r\nfriend, the simple, pure, and pious maiden of his boyish dreams: and\r\nhimself, but for that wretched little kill-joy cerebral occlusion, as\r\nsound, as healthy, as full of life and energy as he had ever been!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUP-AND-BALL]\r\n\r\nAnd when he wasn\'t reading _Silas Marner_, or looking out of window at\r\nthe flying landscape, and watching it revolve round its middle distance\r\n(as it always seems to do), he was sympathetically taking stock of his\r\nfellow-passengers, and mildly envying them, one after another,\r\nindiscriminately!\r\n\r\nA fat, old, wheezy philistine, with a bulbous nose and only one eye, who\r\nhad a plain, sickly daughter, to whom he seemed devoted, body and soul;\r\nan old lady, who still wept furtively at recollections of the parting\r\nwith her grandchildren, which had taken place at the station (they had\r\nborne up wonderfully, as grandchildren do); a consumptive curate, on the\r\nopposite corner seat by the window, whose tender, anxious wife (sitting\r\nby his side) seemed to have no thoughts in the whole world but for him;\r\nand her patient eyes were his stars of consolation, since he turned to\r\nlook into them almost every minute, and always seemed a little the\r\nhappier for doing so. There is no better star-gazing than that!\r\n\r\nSo Little Billee gave her up _his_ corner seat, that the poor sufferer\r\nmight have those stars where he could look into them comfortably without\r\nturning his head.\r\n\r\nIndeed (as was his wont with everybody), Little Billee made himself\r\nuseful and pleasant to his fellow-travellers in many ways--so many that\r\nlong before they had reached their respective journeys\' ends they had\r\nalmost grown to love him as an old friend, and longed to know who this\r\nsingularly attractive and brilliant youth, this genial, dainty,\r\nbenevolent little princekin could possibly be, who was dressed so\r\nfashionably, and yet went second class, and took such kind thought of\r\nothers; and they wondered at the happiness that must be his at merely\r\nbeing alive, and told him more of their troubles in six hours than they\r\ntold many an old friend in a year.\r\n\r\nBut he told them nothing about himself--that self he was so sick of--and\r\nleft them to wonder.\r\n\r\nAnd at his own journey\'s end, the farthest end of all, he found his\r\nmother and sister waiting for him, in a beautiful little\r\npony-carriage--his last gift--and with them sweet Alice, and in her\r\neyes, for one brief moment, that unconscious look of love surprised\r\nwhich is not to be forgotten for years and years and years--which can\r\nonly be seen by the eyes that meet it, and which, for the time it lasts\r\n(just a flash), makes all women\'s eyes look exactly the same (I\'m told):\r\nand it seemed to Little Billee that, for the twentieth part of a second,\r\nAlice had looked at him with Trilby\'s eyes--or his mother\'s, when that\r\nhe was a little tiny boy.\r\n\r\nIt all but gave him the thrill he thirsted for! Another twentieth part\r\nof a second, perhaps, and his brain-trouble would have melted away; and\r\nLittle Billee would have come into his own again--the kingdom of love!\r\n\r\nA beautiful human eye! _Any_ beautiful eye--a dog\'s, a deer\'s, a\r\ndonkey\'s, an owl\'s even! To think of all that it can look, and all that\r\nit can see! all that it can even _seem_, sometimes! What a prince among\r\ngems! what a star!\r\n\r\nBut a beautiful eye that lets the broad white light of infinite space\r\n(so bewildering and garish and diffused) into one pure virgin heart, to\r\nbe filtered there! and lets it out again, duly warmed, softened,\r\nconcentrated, sublimated, focussed to a point as in a precious stone,\r\nthat it may shed itself (a love-laden effulgence) into some stray\r\nfellow-heart close by--through pupil and iris, entre quatre-z-yeux--the\r\nvery elixir of life!\r\n\r\nAlas! that such a crown-jewel should ever lose its lustre and go blind!\r\n\r\nNot so blind or dim, however, but it can still see well enough to look\r\nbefore and after, and inward and upward, and drown itself in tears, and\r\nyet not die! And that\'s the dreadful pity of it. And this is a quite\r\nuncalled-for digression; and I can\'t think why I should have gone out of\r\nmy way (at considerable pains) to invent it! In fact--\r\n\r\n    "Of this here song, should I be axed the reason for to show,\r\n     I don\'t exactly know, I don\'t exactly know!\r\n     _But all my fancy dwells upon Nancy._" ...\r\n\r\n"How pretty Alice has grown, mother! quite lovely, I think! and so nice;\r\nbut she was always as nice as she could be!"\r\n\r\nSo observed Little Billee to his mother that evening as they sat in the\r\ngarden and watched the crescent moon sink to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n"Ah! my darling Willie! If you _could_ only guess how happy you would\r\nmake your poor old mammy by growing fond of Alice.... And Blanche, too!\r\nwhat a joy for _her_!"\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! mother.... Alice is not for the likes of _me_! She\'s for\r\nsome splendid young Devon squire, six foot high, and acred and\r\nwhiskered within an inch of his life!..."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my darling Willie! you are not of those who ask for love in\r\nvain.... If you only _knew_ how she believes in you! She almost beats\r\nyour poor old mammy at _that_!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWEET ALICE]\r\n\r\nAnd that night he dreamed of Alice--that he loved her as a sweet good\r\nwoman should be loved; and knew, even in his dream, that it was but a\r\ndream; but, oh! it was good! and he managed not to wake; and it was a\r\nnight to be marked with a white stone! And (still in his dream) she had\r\nkissed him, and healed him of his brain-trouble forever. But when he\r\nwoke next morning, alas! his brain-trouble was with him still, and he\r\nfelt that no dream kiss would ever cure it--nothing but a real kiss from\r\nAlice\'s own pure lips!\r\n\r\nAnd he rose thinking of Alice, and dressed and breakfasted thinking of\r\nher--and how fair she was, and how innocent, and how well and carefully\r\ntrained up the way she should go--the beau ideal of a wife.... Could she\r\npossibly care for a shrimp like himself?\r\n\r\nFor in his love of outward form he could not understand that any woman\r\nwho had eyes to see should ever quite condone the signs of physical\r\nweakness in man, in favor of any mental gifts or graces whatsoever.\r\n\r\nLittle Greek that he was, he worshipped the athlete, and opined that all\r\nwomen without exception--all English women especially--must see with the\r\nsame eyes as himself.\r\n\r\nHe had once been vain and weak enough to believe in Trilby\'s love (with\r\na Taffy standing by--a careless, unsusceptible Taffy, who was like unto\r\nthe gods of Olympus!)--and Trilby had given him up at a word, a\r\nhint--for all his frantic clinging.\r\n\r\nShe would not have given up Taffy, _pour si peu_, had Taffy but lifted a\r\nlittle finger! It is always "just whistle, and I\'ll come to you, my\r\nlad!" with the likes of Taffy ... but Taffy hadn\'t even whistled! Yet\r\nstill he kept thinking of Alice--and he felt he couldn\'t think of her\r\nwell enough till he went out for a stroll by himself on a sheep-trimmed\r\ndown. So he took his pipe and his Darwin, and out he strolled into the\r\nearly sunshine--up the green Red Lane, past the pretty church, Alice\'s\r\nfather\'s church--and there, at the gate, patiently waiting for his\r\nmistress, sat Alice\'s dog--an old friend of his, whose welcome was a\r\nvery warm one.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee thought of Thackeray\'s lovely poem in _Pendennis_:\r\n\r\n    "She comes--she\'s here--she\'s past!\r\n     May heaven go with her!..."\r\n\r\nThen he and the dog went on together to a little bench on the edge of\r\nthe cliff--within sight of Alice\'s bedroom window. It was called "the\r\nHoneymooners\' Bench."\r\n\r\n"That look--that look--that look! Ah--but Trilby had looked like that,\r\ntoo! And there are many Taffys in Devon!"\r\n\r\nHe sat himself down and smoked and gazed at the sea below, which the sun\r\n(still in the east) had not yet filled with glare and robbed of the\r\nlovely sapphire-blue, shot with purple and dark green, that comes over\r\nit now and again of a morning on that most beautiful coast.\r\n\r\nThere was a fresh breeze from the west, and the long, slow billows broke\r\ninto creamier foam than ever, which reflected itself as a tender white\r\ngleam in the blue concavities of their shining shoreward curves as they\r\ncame rolling in. The sky was all of turquoise but for the smoke of a\r\ndistant steamer--a long thin horizontal streak of dun--and there were\r\nlittle brown or white sails here and there, dotting; and the stately\r\nships went on....\r\n\r\nLittle Billee tried hard to feel all this beauty with his heart as well\r\nas his brain--as he had so often done when a boy--and cursed his\r\ninsensibility out loud for at least the thousand and first time.\r\n\r\nWhy couldn\'t these waves of air and water be turned into equivalent\r\nwaves of sound, that he might feel them through the only channel that\r\nreached his emotions! That one joy was still left to him--but, alas!\r\nalas! he was only a painter of pictures--and not a maker of music!\r\n\r\nHe recited "Break, break, break," to Alice\'s dog, who loved him, and\r\nlooked up into his face with sapient, affectionate eyes--and whose\r\nname, like that of so many dogs in fiction and so few in fact, was\r\nsimply Tray. For Little Billee was much given to monologues out loud,\r\nand profuse quotations from his favorite bards.\r\n\r\nEverybody quoted that particular poem either mentally or aloud when they\r\nsat on that particular bench--except a few old-fashioned people, who\r\nstill said,\r\n\r\n    "Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!"\r\n\r\nor people of the very highest culture, who only quoted the nascent (and\r\ncrescent) Robert Browning; or people of no culture at all, who simply\r\nheld their tongues--and only felt the more!\r\n\r\nTray listened silently.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Tray, the best thing but one to do with the sea is to paint it. The\r\nnext best thing to that is to bathe in it. The best of all is to lie\r\nasleep at the bottom. How would _you_ like that?\r\n\r\n    "\'And on thy ribs the limpet sticks,\r\n      And in thy heart the scrawl shall play....\'"\r\n\r\nTray\'s tail became as a wagging point of interrogation, and he turned\r\nhis head first on one side and then on the other--his eyes fixed on\r\nLittle Billee\'s, his face irresistible in its genial doggy wistfulness.\r\n\r\n"Tray, what a singularly good listener you are--and therefore what\r\nsingularly good manners you\'ve got! I suppose all dogs have!" said\r\nLittle Billee; and then, in a very tender voice, he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n"Alice, Alice, Alice!"\r\n\r\nAnd Tray uttered a soft, cooing, nasal croon in his head register,\r\nthough he was a barytone dog by nature, with portentous, warlike\r\nchest-notes of the jingo order.\r\n\r\n"Tray, your mistress is a parson\'s daughter, and therefore twice as much\r\nof a mystery as any other woman in this puzzling world!\r\n\r\n"Tray, if my heart weren\'t stopped with wax, like the ears of the\r\ncompanions of Ulysses when they rowed past the sirens--you\'ve heard of\r\nUlysses, Tray? he loved a dog--if my heart weren\'t stopped with wax, I\r\nshould be deeply in love with your mistress; perhaps she would marry me\r\nif I asked her--there\'s no accounting for tastes!--and I know enough of\r\nmyself to know that I should make her a good husband--that I should make\r\nher happy--and I should make two other women happy besides.\r\n\r\n"As for myself personally, Tray, it doesn\'t very much matter. One good\r\nwoman would do as well as another, if she\'s equally good-looking. You\r\ndoubt it? Wait till you get a pimple inside your bump of--your bump\r\nof--wherever you keep your fondnesses, Tray.\r\n\r\n"For that\'s what\'s the matter with me--a pimple--just a little clot of\r\nblood at the root of a nerve, and no bigger than a pin\'s point!\r\n\r\n"That\'s a small thing to cause such a lot of wretchedness, and wreck a\r\nfellow\'s life, isn\'t it? Oh, curse it, curse it, curse it--every day and\r\nall day long!\r\n\r\n"And just as small a thing will take it away, I\'m told!\r\n\r\n"Ah! grains of sand are small things--and so are diamonds! But diamond\r\nor grain of sand, only Alice has got that small thing! Alice alone, in\r\nall the world, has got the healing touch for me now; the hands, the\r\nlips, the eyes! I know it--I feel it! I dreamed it last night! She\r\nlooked me well in the face, and took my hand--both hands--and kissed me,\r\neyes and mouth, and told me how she loved me. Ah! what a dream it was!\r\nAnd my little clot melted away like a snow-flake on the lips, and I was\r\nmy old self again, after many years--and all through that kiss of a pure\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never been kissed by a pure woman in my life--never! except by my\r\ndear mother and sister; and mothers and sisters don\'t count, when it\r\ncomes to kissing.\r\n\r\n"Ah! sweet physician that she is, and better than all! It will all come\r\nback again with a rush, just as I dreamed, and we will have a good time\r\ntogether, we three!...\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "MAY HEAVEN GO WITH HER!"]\r\n\r\n"But your mistress is a parson\'s daughter, and believes everything she\'s\r\nbeen taught from a child, just as you do--at least, I hope so. And I\r\nlike her for it--and you too.\r\n\r\n"She has believed her father--will she ever believe me, who think so\r\ndifferently? And if she does, will it be good for her?--and then, where\r\nwill her father come in?\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s a bad thing to live, and no longer believe and trust in your\r\nfather, Tray! to doubt either his honesty or his intelligence. For he\r\n(with your mother to help) has taught you all the best he knows, if he\r\nhas been a good father--till some one else comes and teaches you\r\nbetter--or worse!\r\n\r\n"And, then, what are you to believe of what good still remains of all\r\nthat early teaching--and how are you to sift the wheat from the\r\nchaff?...\r\n\r\n"Kneel undisturbed, fair saint! I, for one, will never seek to undermine\r\nthy faith in any father, on earth or above it!\r\n\r\n"Yes, there she kneels in her father\'s church, her pretty head bowed\r\nover her clasped hands, her cloak and skirts falling in happy folds\r\nabout her: I see it all!\r\n\r\n"And underneath, that poor, sweet, soft, pathetic thing of flesh and\r\nblood, the eternal woman--great heart and slender brain--forever\r\nenslaved or enslaving, never self-sufficing, never free ... that dear,\r\nweak, delicate shape, so cherishable, so perishable, that I\'ve had to\r\npaint so often, and know so well by heart! and love ... ah, how I love\r\nit! Only painter-fellows and sculptor-fellows can ever quite know the\r\nfulness of that pure love.\r\n\r\n"There she kneels and pours forth her praise or plaint, meekly and duly.\r\nPerhaps it\'s for me she\'s praying!\r\n\r\n    "\'Leave thou thy sister when she prays.\'\r\n\r\n"She believes her poor little prayer will be heard and answered\r\nsomewhere up aloft. The impossible will be done. She wants what she\r\nwants so badly, and prays for it so hard.\r\n\r\n"She believes--she believes--what _doesn\'t_ she believe, Tray?\r\n\r\n"The world was made in six days. It is just six thousand years old. Once\r\nit all lay smothered under rain-water for many weeks, miles deep,\r\nbecause there were so many wicked people about somewhere down in\r\nJude_e_, where they didn\'t know everything! A costly kind of clearance!\r\nAnd then there was Noah, who _wasn\'t_ wicked, and his most respectable\r\nfamily, and his ark--and Jonah and his whale--and Joshua and the sun,\r\nand what not. I remember it all, you see, and, oh! such wonderful things\r\nthat have happened since! And there\'s everlasting agony for those who\r\ndon\'t believe as she does; and yet she is happy, and good, and very\r\nkind; for the mere thought of any live creature in pain makes her\r\nwretched!\r\n\r\n"After all, if she believes in me, she\'ll believe in anything; let her!\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I\'m not sure that it\'s not rather ungainly for a pretty woman\r\n_not_ to believe in all these good old cosmic taradiddles, as it is for\r\na pretty child not to believe in Little Red Riding-hood, and Jack and\r\nthe Beanstalk, and Morgiana and the Forty Thieves; we learn them at our\r\nmother\'s knee, and how nice they are! Let us go on believing them as\r\nlong as we can, till the child grows up and the woman dies and it\'s all\r\nfound out.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Tray, I will be dishonest for her dear sake. I will kneel by her\r\nside, if ever I have the happy chance, and ever after, night and\r\nmorning, and all day long on Sundays if she wants me to! What will I\r\n_not_ do for that one pretty woman who believes in _me_? I will respect\r\neven _that_ belief, and do my little best to keep it alive forever. It\r\nis much too precious an earthly boon for _me_ to play ducks and drakes\r\nwith....\r\n\r\n"So much for Alice, Tray--your sweet mistress and mine.\r\n\r\n"But, then, there\'s Alice\'s papa--and that\'s another pair of sleeves, as\r\nwe say in France.\r\n\r\n"Ought one ever to play at make-believe with a full-grown man for any\r\nconsideration whatever--even though he be a parson, and a possible\r\nfather-in-law? _There\'s_ a case of conscience for you!\r\n\r\n"When I ask him for his daughter, as I must, and he asks me for my\r\nprofession of faith, as he will, what can I tell him? The truth?\r\n\r\n"But, then, what will _he_ say? What allowances will _he_ make for a\r\npoor little weak-kneed, well-meaning waif of a painter-fellow like me,\r\nwhose only choice lay between Mr. Darwin and the Pope of Rome, and who\r\nhas chosen once and forever--and that long ago--before he\'d ever even\r\nheard of Mr. Darwin\'s name.\r\n\r\n"Besides, why should he make allowances for me? I don\'t for him. I think\r\nno more of a parson than he does of a painter-fellow--and that\'s\r\nprecious little, I\'m afraid.\r\n\r\n"What will he think of a man who says:\r\n\r\n"\'Look here! the God of your belief isn\'t mine and never will be--but I\r\nlove your daughter, and she loves me, and I\'m the only man to make her\r\nhappy!\'\r\n\r\n"He\'s no Jephthah; he\'s made of flesh and blood, although he\'s a\r\nparson--and loves his daughter as much as Shylock loved his.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Tray--thou that livest among parsons--what man, not being a\r\nparson himself, can guess how a parson would think, an average parson,\r\nconfronted by such a poser as that?\r\n\r\n"Does he, dare he, _can_ he ever think straight or simply on any subject\r\nas any other man thinks, hedged in as he is by so many limitations?\r\n\r\n"He is as shrewd, vain, worldly, self-seeking, ambitious, jealous,\r\ncensorious, and all the rest, as you or I, Tray--for all his Christian\r\nprofession--and just as fond of his kith and kin!\r\n\r\n"He is considered a gentleman--which perhaps you and I are not--unless\r\nwe happen to behave as such; it is a condition of his noble calling.\r\nPerhaps it\'s in order to become a gentleman that he\'s become a parson!\r\nIt\'s about as short a royal road as any to that enviable distinction--as\r\nshort almost as her Majesty\'s commission, and much safer, and much less\r\nexpensive--within reach of the sons of most fairly successful butchers\r\nand bakers and candlestick-makers.\r\n\r\n"While still a boy he has bound himself irrevocably to certain beliefs,\r\nwhich he will be paid to preserve and preach and enforce through life,\r\nand act up to through thick and thin--at all events, in the eyes of\r\nothers--even his nearest and dearest--even the wife of his bosom.\r\n\r\n"They are his bread and butter, these beliefs--and a man mustn\'t quarrel\r\nwith his bread and butter. But a parson must quarrel with those who\r\ndon\'t believe as he tells them!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'SO MUCH FOR ALICE, TRAY\'"]\r\n\r\n"Yet a few years\' thinking and reading and experience of life, one would\r\nsuppose, might possibly just shake his faith a little (just as though,\r\ninstead of being parson, he had been tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor,\r\ngentleman, apothecary, ploughboy, thief), and teach him that many of\r\nthese beliefs are simply childish--and some of them very wicked\r\nindeed--and most immoral.\r\n\r\n"It is very wicked and most immoral to believe, or affect to believe,\r\nand tell others to believe, that the unseen, unspeakable, unthinkable\r\nImmensity we\'re all part and parcel of, source of eternal, infinite,\r\nindestructible life and light and might, is a kind of wrathful,\r\nglorified, and self-glorifying ogre in human shape, with human passions,\r\nand most inhuman hates--who suddenly made us out of nothing, one fine\r\nday--just for a freak--and made us so badly that we fell the next--and\r\nturned us adrift the day after--damned us from the very beginning--_ab\r\novo--ab ovo usque ad malum_--ha, ha!--and ever since! never gave us a\r\nchance!\r\n\r\n"All-merciful Father, indeed! Why, the Prince of Darkness was an angel\r\nin comparison (and a gentleman into the bargain).\r\n\r\n"Just think of it, Tray--a finger in every little paltry pie--an eye and\r\nan ear at every key-hole, even that of the larder, to catch us tripping,\r\nand find out if we\'re praising loud enough, or grovelling low enough, or\r\nfasting hard enough--poor god-forsaken worms!\r\n\r\n"And if we\'re naughty and disobedient, everlasting torment for us;\r\ntorture of so hideous a kind that we wouldn\'t inflict it on the basest\r\ncriminal, not for one single moment!\r\n\r\n"Or else, if we\'re good and do as we are bid, an eternity of bliss so\r\nfutile, so idle, and so tame that we couldn\'t stand it for a week, but\r\nfor thinking of its one horrible alternative, and of our poor brother\r\nfor ever and ever roasting away, and howling for the drop of water he\r\nnever gets.\r\n\r\n"Everlasting flame, or everlasting dishonor--nothing between!\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it ludicrous as well as pitiful--a thing to make one snigger\r\nthrough one\'s tears? Isn\'t it a grievous sin to believe in such things\r\nas these, and go about teaching and preaching them, and being paid for\r\nit--a sin to be heavily chastised, and a shame? What a legacy!\r\n\r\n"They were shocking bad artists, those conceited, narrow-minded Jews,\r\nthose poor old doting monks and priests and bigots of the grewsome, dark\r\nage of faith! They couldn\'t draw a bit--no perspective, no\r\nchiaro-oscuro; and it\'s a woful image they managed to evolve for us out\r\nof the depths of their fathomless ignorance, in their zeal to keep us\r\noff all the forbidden fruit we\'re all so fond of, because we were built\r\nlike that! And by whom? By our Maker, I suppose (who also made the\r\nforbidden fruit, and made it very nice--and put it so conveniently for\r\nyou and me to see and smell and reach, Tray--and sometimes even pick,\r\nalas!).\r\n\r\n"And even at that it\'s a failure. Only the very foolish little birds are\r\nfrightened into good behavior. The naughty ones laugh and wink at each\r\nother, and pull out its hair and beard when nobody\'s looking, and build\r\ntheir nests out of the straw it\'s stuffed with (the naughty little birds\r\nin black, especially), and pick up what they want under its very nose,\r\nand thrive uncommonly well; and the good ones fly away out of sight; and\r\nsome day, perhaps, find a home in some happy, useful father-land far\r\naway, where the Father isn\'t a bit like this. Who knows?\r\n\r\n"And I\'m one of the good little birds, Tray--at least, I hope so. And\r\nthat unknown Father lives in me whether I will or no, and I love Him\r\nwhether He be or not, just because I can\'t help it, and with the best\r\nand bravest love that can be--the perfect love that believeth no evil,\r\nand seeketh no reward, and casteth out fear. For I\'m His father as much\r\nas He\'s mine, since I\'ve conceived the thought of Him after my own\r\nfashion!\r\n\r\n"And He lives in you too, Tray--you and all your kind. Yes, good dog,\r\nyou king of beasts, I see it in your eyes....\r\n\r\n"Ah, bon Dieu P\xc3\xa8re, le Dieu des bonnes gens! Oh! if we only knew for\r\n_certain_, Tray! what martyrdom would we not endure, you and I, with a\r\nhappy smile and a grateful heart--for sheer _love_ of such a father! How\r\nlittle should _we_ care for the things of this earth!\r\n\r\n"But the poor parson?\r\n\r\n"He must willy-nilly go on believing, or affecting to believe, just as\r\nhe is told, _word for word_, or else good-bye to his wife and children\'s\r\nbread and butter, his own preferment, perhaps even his very\r\ngentility--that gentility of which his Master thought so little, and he\r\nand his are apt to think so much--with possibly the Archbishopric of\r\nCanterbury at the end of it, the b\xc3\xa2ton de mar\xc3\xa9chal that lies in every\r\nclerical knapsack.\r\n\r\n"What a temptation! one is but human!\r\n\r\n"So how can he be honest without believing certain things, to believe\r\nwhich (without shame) one must be as simple as a little child; as,\r\nby-the-way, he is so cleverly told to be in these matters, and so\r\ncleverly tells us--and so seldom is himself in any other matter\r\nwhatever--his own interests, other people\'s affairs, the world, the\r\nflesh, and the devil! And that\'s clever of him too....\r\n\r\n"And if he chooses to be as simple as a little child, why shouldn\'t I\r\ntreat him as a little child, for his own good, and fool him to the top\r\nof his little bent for his dear daughter\'s sake, that I may make her\r\nhappy, and thereby him too?\r\n\r\n"And if he\'s _not_ quite so simple as all that, and makes artful little\r\ncompromises with his conscience--for a good purpose, of course--why\r\nshouldn\'t I make artful little compromises with mine, and for a better\r\npurpose still, and try to get what I want in the way _he_ does? I want\r\nto marry his daughter far worse than he can ever want to live in a\r\npalace, and ride in a carriage and pair with a mitre on the panels.\r\n\r\n"If he _cheats_, why shouldn\'t I cheat too?\r\n\r\n"If _he_ cheats, he cheats everybody all round--the wide, wide world,\r\nand something wider and higher still that can\'t be measured, something\r\nin himself. _I_ only cheat _him_!\r\n\r\n"_If_ he cheats, he cheats for the sake of very worldly things\r\nindeed--tithes, honors, influence, power, authority, social\r\nconsideration and respect--not to speak of bread and butter! _I_ only\r\ncheat for the love of a lady fair--and cheating for cheating, I like my\r\ncheating best.\r\n\r\n"So, whether he cheats or not, I\'ll--\r\n\r\n"Confound it! what would old Taffy do in such a case, I wonder?...\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother! it\'s no good wondering what old Taffy would do.\r\n\r\n"Taffy never wants to marry _anybody\'s_ daughter; he doesn\'t even want\r\nto paint her! He only wants to paint his beastly ragamuffins and thieves\r\nand drunkards, and be left alone.\r\n\r\n"Besides, Taffy\'s as simple as a little child himself, and couldn\'t fool\r\nany one, and wouldn\'t if he could--not even a parson. But if any one\r\ntries to fool _him_, my eyes! don\'t he cut up rough, and call names, and\r\nkick up a shindy, and even knock people down! That\'s the worst of\r\nfellows like Taffy. They\'re too good for this world and too solemn.\r\nThey\'re impossible, and lack all sense of humor. In point of fact,\r\nTaffy\'s a _gentleman_--poor fellow! _et puis voil\xc3\xa0!_\r\n\r\n"I\'m not simple--worse luck; and I can\'t knock people down--I only wish\r\nI could! I can only paint them! and not even _that_ \'as they really\r\nare!\' ... Good old Taffy!...\r\n\r\n"Faint heart never won fair lady!\r\n\r\n"Oh, happy, happy thought--I\'ll be brave and win!\r\n\r\n"I can\'t knock people down, or do doughty deeds, but I\'ll be brave in my\r\nown little way--the only way I can....\r\n\r\n"I\'ll simply lie through thick and thin--I must--I will--nobody need\r\never be a bit the wiser! I can do more good by lying than by telling the\r\ntruth, and make more deserving people happy, including myself and the\r\nsweetest girl alive--the end shall justify the means: that\'s my excuse,\r\nmy only excuse! and this lie of mine is on so stupendous a scale that it\r\nwill have to last me for life. It\'s my only one, but its name is _Lion_!\r\nand I\'ll never tell another as long as I live.\r\n\r\n"And now that I know what temptation really is, I\'ll never think any\r\nharm of any parson any more ... never, never, never!"\r\n\r\nSo the little man went on, as if he knew all about it, had found it all\r\nout for himself, and nobody else had ever found it out before! and I am\r\nnot responsible for his ways of thinking (which are not necessarily my\r\nown).\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, in extenuation, that he was very young, and not\r\nvery wise: no philosopher, no scholar--just a painter of lovely\r\npictures; only that and nothing more. Also, that he was reading Mr.\r\nDarwin\'s immortal book for the third time, and it was a little too\r\nstrong for him; also, that all this happened in the early sixties, long\r\nere Religion had made up her mind to meet Science half-way, and hobnob\r\nand kiss and be friends. Alas! before such a lying down of the lion and\r\nthe lamb can ever come to pass, Religion will have to perform a larger\r\nshare of the journey than half, I fear!\r\n\r\nThen, still carried away by the flood of his own eloquence (for he had\r\nnever had such an innings as this, no such a listener), he again\r\napostrophized the dog Tray, who had been growing somewhat inattentive\r\n(like the reader, perhaps), in language more beautiful than ever:\r\n\r\n"Oh, to be like you, Tray--and secrete love and good-will from morn till\r\nnight, from night till morning--like saliva, without effort! with never\r\na moment\'s cessation of flow, even in disgrace and humiliation! How much\r\nbetter to love than to be loved--to love as you do, my Tray--so warmly,\r\nso easily, so unremittingly--to forgive all wrongs and neglect and\r\ninjustice so quickly and so well--and forget a kindness never! Lucky dog\r\nthat you are!\r\n\r\n    "\'Oh! could I feel as I have felt, or be as I have been,\r\n      Or weep as I could once have wept, o\'er many a vanished scene,\r\n      As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish tho\' they be,\r\n      So \'midst this withered waste of life those tears would flow to me!\'\r\n\r\n"What do you think of those lines, Tray? I _love_ them, because my\r\nmother taught them to me when I was about your age--six years old, or\r\nseven! and before the bard who wrote them had fallen; like Lucifer, son\r\nof the morning! Have you ever heard of Lord Byron, Tray? He too, like\r\nUlysses, loved a dog, and many people think that\'s about the best there\r\nis to be said of him nowadays! Poor Humpty Dumpty! Such a swell as he\r\nonce was! \'Not all the king\'s horses, nor all the--\'"\r\n\r\nHere Tray jumped up suddenly and bolted--he saw some one else he was\r\nfond of, and ran to meet him. It was the vicar, coming out of his\r\nvicarage.\r\n\r\nA very nice-looking vicar--fresh, clean, alert, well tanned by sun and\r\nwind and weather--a youngish vicar still; tall, stout, gentlemanlike,\r\nshrewd, kindly, wordly, a trifle pompous, and authoritative more than a\r\ntrifle; not much given to abstract speculation, and thinking fifty times\r\nmore of any sporting and orthodox young country squire, well-inched and\r\nwell-acred (and well-whiskered), than of all the painters in\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\n"\'When Greeks joined Greeks, then was the tug of war,\'" thought Little\r\nBillee; and he felt a little uncomfortable. Alice\'s father had never\r\nloomed so big and impressive before, or so distressingly nice to look\r\nat.\r\n\r\n"Welcome, my Apelles, to your ain countree, which is growing quite proud\r\nof you, I declare! Young Lord Archie Waring was saying only last night\r\nthat he wished he had half your talent! He\'s _crazed_ about painting,\r\nyou know, and actually wants to be a painter himself! The poor dear old\r\nmarquis is quite sore about it!"\r\n\r\nWith this happy exordium the parson stopped and shook hands; and they\r\nboth stood for a while, looking seaward. The parson said the usual\r\nthings about the sea--its blueness; its grayness; its greenness; its\r\nbeauty; its sadness; its treachery.\r\n\r\n    "\'Who shall put forth on thee,\r\n      Unfathomable sea!\'"\r\n\r\n"Who indeed!" answered Little Billee, quite agreeing. "I vote _we_\r\ndon\'t, at all events." So they turned inland.\r\n\r\nThe parson said the usual things about the land (from the\r\ncountry-gentleman\'s point of view), and the talk began to flow quite\r\npleasantly, with quoting of the usual poets, and capping of quotations\r\nin the usual way--for they had known each other many years, both here\r\nand in London. Indeed, the vicar had once been Little Billee\'s tutor.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, amicably, they entered a small wooded hollow. Then the vicar,\r\nturning of a sudden his full blue gaze on the painter, asked, sternly:\r\n\r\n"What book\'s that you\'ve got in your hand, Willie?"\r\n\r\n"A--a--it\'s the _Origin of Species_, by Charles Darwin. I\'m very\r\nf-f-fond of it. I\'m reading it for the third time.... It\'s very\r\ng-g-good. It _accounts_ for things, you know."\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, and still more sternly:\r\n\r\n"What place of worship do you most attend in London--especially of an\r\nevening, William?"\r\n\r\nThen stammered Little Billee, all self-control forsaking him:\r\n\r\n"I d-d-don\'t attend any place of worship at all, morning, afternoon, or\r\nevening. I\'ve long given up going to church altogether. I can only be\r\nfrank with you; I\'ll tell you why...."\r\n\r\nAnd as they walked along the talk drifted on to very momentous subjects\r\nindeed, and led, unfortunately, to a serious falling out--for which\r\nprobably both were to blame--and closed in a distressful way at the\r\nother end of the little wooded hollow--a way most sudden and unexpected,\r\nand quite grievous to relate. When they emerged into the open the parson\r\nwas quite white, and the painter crimson.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said the parson, squaring himself up to more than his full height\r\nand breadth and dignity, his face big with righteous wrath, his voice\r\nfull of strong menace--"sir, you\'re--you\'re a--you\'re a _thief_, sir, a\r\n_thief_! You\'re trying to _rob me of my Saviour_! Never you dare to\r\ndarken _my_ door-step again!"\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Little Billee, with a bow, "if it comes to calling names,\r\nyou\'re--you\'re a--no; you\'re Alice\'s father; and whatever else you are\r\nbesides, I\'m another for trying to be honest with a parson; so\r\ngood-morning to you."\r\n\r\nAnd each walked off in an opposite direction, stiff as pokers; and Tray\r\nstood between, looking first at one receding figure, then at the\r\nother, disconsolate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'YOU\'RE A _THIEF_, SIR!\'"]\r\n\r\nAnd thus Little Billee found out that he could no more lie than he could\r\nfly. And so he did not marry sweet Alice after all, and no doubt it was\r\nordered for her good and his. But there was tribulation for many days in\r\nthe house of Bagot, and for many months in one tender, pure, and pious\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nAnd the best and the worst of it all is that, not very many years after,\r\nthe good vicar--more fortunate than most clergymen who dabble in stocks\r\nand shares--grew suddenly very rich through a lucky speculation in Irish\r\nbeer, and suddenly, also, took to thinking seriously about things (as a\r\nman of business should)--more seriously than he had ever thought before.\r\nSo at least the story goes in North Devon, and it is not so new as to be\r\nincredible. Little doubts grew into big ones--big doubts resolved\r\nthemselves into downright negations. He quarrelled with his bishop; he\r\nquarrelled with his dean; he even quarrelled with his "poor dear old\r\nmarquis," who died before there was time to make it up again. And\r\nfinally he felt it his duty, in conscience, to secede from a Church\r\nwhich had become too narrow to hold him, and took himself and his\r\nbelongings to London, where at least he could breathe. But there he fell\r\ninto a great disquiet, for the long habit of feeling himself always _en\r\n\xc3\xa9vidence_--of being looked up to and listened to without contradiction;\r\nof exercising influence and authority in spiritual matters (and even\r\ntemporal); of impressing women, especially, with his commanding\r\npresence, his fine sonorous voice, his lofty brow, so serious and\r\nsmooth, his soft, big, waving hands, which soon lost their country\r\ntan--all this had grown as a second nature to him, the breath of his\r\nnostrils, a necessity of his life. So he rose to be the most popular\r\nUnitarian preacher of his day, and pretty broad at that.\r\n\r\nBut his dear daughter Alice, she stuck to the old faith, and married a\r\nvenerable High-Church archdeacon, who very cleverly clutched at and\r\ncaught her and saved her for himself just as she stood shivering on the\r\nvery brink of Rome; and they were neither happy nor unhappy\r\ntogether--_un m\xc3\xa9nage bourgeois, ni beau ni laid, ni bon ni mauvais_. And\r\nthus, alas! the bond of religious sympathy, that counts for so much in\r\nunited families, no longer existed between father and daughter, and the\r\nheart\'s division divided them. _Ce que c\'est que de nous!_ ... The pity\r\nof it!\r\n\r\nAnd so no more of sweet Alice with hair so brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Sixth\r\n\r\n    \'"Vraiment, la reine aupr\xc3\xa8s d\'elle \xc3\xa9tait laide\r\n            Quand, vers le soir,\r\n      Elle passait sur le pont de Tol\xc3\xa8de\r\n            En corset noir!\r\n      Un chapelet du temps de Charlemagne\r\n            Ornait son cou....\r\n      _La vent qui vient \xc3\xa0 travers la montagne\r\n            Me rendra fou!_\r\n\r\n    "\'Dansez, chantez, villageois! la nuit tombe....\r\n            Sabine, un jour,\r\n      A tout donn\xc3\xa9--sa beaut\xc3\xa9 de colombe,\r\n            Et son amour--\r\n      Pour l\'anneau d\'or du Comte de Soldagne,\r\n            Pour un bijou....\r\n      _La vent qui vient \xc3\xa0 travers la montagne\r\n            M\'a rendu fou!_\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nBehold our three musketeers of the brush once more reunited in Paris,\r\nfamous, after long years.\r\n\r\nIn emulation of the good Dumas, we will call it "cinq ans apr\xc3\xa8s." It was\r\na little more.\r\n\r\nTaffy stands for Porthos and Athos rolled into one, since he is big and\r\ngood-natured, and strong enough to "assommer un homme d\'un coup de\r\npoing," and also stately and solemn, of aristocratic and romantic\r\nappearance, and not too fat--not too much ongbong-pwang, as the Laird\r\ncalled it--and also he does not dislike a bottle of wine, or even two,\r\nand looks as if he had a history.\r\n\r\nThe Laird, of course, is d\'Artagnan, since he sells his pictures well,\r\nand by the time we are writing of has already become an Associate of the\r\nRoyal Academy; like Quentin Durward, this d\'Artagnan was a Scotsman:\r\n\r\n    "Ah, was na he a Roguy, this piper of Dundee!"\r\n\r\nAnd Little Billee, the dainty friend of duchesses, must stand for\r\nAramis, I fear! It will not do to push the simile too far; besides,\r\nunlike the good Dumas, one has a conscience. One does not play ducks and\r\ndrakes with historical facts, or tamper with historical personages. And\r\nif Athos, Porthos & Co. are not historical by this time, I should like\r\nto know who are!\r\n\r\nWell, so are Taffy, the Laird, and Little Billee--_tout ce qu\'il y a de\r\nplus historiques_!\r\n\r\nOur three friends, well groomed, frock-coated, shirt-collared within an\r\ninch of their lives, duly scarfed and scarf-pinned, chimney-pot-hatted,\r\nand most beautifully trousered, and balmorally booted, or neatly spatted\r\n(or whatever was most correct at the time), are breakfasting together on\r\ncoffee, rolls, and butter at a little round table in the huge court-yard\r\nof an immense caravanserai, paved with asphalt, and covered in at the\r\ntop with a glazed roof that admits the sun and keeps out the rain--and\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nA magnificent old man as big as Taffy, in black velvet coat and breeches\r\nand black silk stockings, and a large gold chain round his neck and\r\nchest, looks down like Jove from a broad flight of marble steps--as\r\nthough to welcome the coming guests, who arrive in cabs and railway\r\nomnibuses through a huge archway on the boulevard, or to speed those who\r\npart through a lesser archway opening on to a side street.\r\n\r\n"Bon voyage, messieurs et dames!"\r\n\r\nAt countless other little tables other voyagers are breakfasting or\r\nordering breakfast; or, having breakfasted, are smoking and chatting and\r\nlooking about. It is a babel of tongues--the cheerfulest, busiest,\r\nmerriest scene in the world, apparently the costly place of rendezvous\r\nfor all wealthy Europe and America; an atmosphere of bank-notes and\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nAlready Taffy has recognized (and been recognized by) half a dozen old\r\nfellow-Crimeans, of unmistakable military aspect like himself; and three\r\ncanny Scotsmen have discreetly greeted the Laird; and as for Little\r\nBillee, he is constantly jumping up from his breakfast and running to\r\nthis table or that, drawn by some irresistible British smile of\r\nsurprised and delighted female recognition: "What, _you_ here? How nice!\r\nCome over to hear la Svengali, I suppose."\r\n\r\nAt the top of the marble steps is a long terrace, with seats and people\r\nsitting, from which tall glazed doors, elaborately carved and gilded,\r\ngive access to luxurious drawing-rooms, dining-rooms, reading-rooms,\r\nlavatories, postal and telegraph offices; and all round and about are\r\nhuge square green boxes, out of which grow tropical and exotic\r\nevergreens all the year round--with beautiful names that I have\r\nforgotten. And leaning against these boxes are placards announcing what\r\ntheatrical or musical entertainments will take place in Paris that day\r\nor night; and the biggest of these placards (and the most\r\nfantastically decorated) informs the cosmopolite world that Madame\r\nSvengali intends to make her first appearance in Paris that very\r\nevening, at nine punctually, in the Cirque des Bashibazoucks, Rue St.\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "AN ATMOSPHERE OF BANK-NOTES AND GOLD"]\r\n\r\nOur friends had only arrived the previous night, but they had managed to\r\nsecure stalls a week beforehand. No places were any longer to be got for\r\nlove or money. Many people had come to Paris on purpose to hear la\r\nSvengali--many famous musicians from England and everywhere else--but\r\nthey would have to wait many days.\r\n\r\nThe fame of her was like a rolling snowball that had been rolling all\r\nover Europe for the last two years--wherever there was snow to be picked\r\nup in the shape of golden ducats.\r\n\r\nTheir breakfast over, Taffy, the Laird, and Little Billee, cigar in\r\nmouth, arm in arm, the huge Taffy in the middle (_comme autrefois_),\r\ncrossed the sunshiny boulevard into the shade, and went down the Rue de\r\nla Paix, through the Place Vend\xc3\xb4me and the Rue Castiglione to the Rue de\r\nRivoli--quite leisurely, and with a tender midriff-warming sensation of\r\nfreedom and delight at almost every step.\r\n\r\nArrived at the corner pastry-cook\'s, they finished the stumps of their\r\ncigars as they looked at the well-remembered show in the window; then\r\nthey went in and had, Taffy a Madeleine, the Laird a baba, and Little\r\nBillee a Savarin--and each, I regret to say, a liqueur-glass of _rhum de\r\nla Jama\xc3\xafque_.\r\n\r\nAfter this they sauntered through the Tuileries Gardens, and by the quay\r\nto their favorite Pont des Arts, and looked up and down the\r\nriver--_comme autrefois_!\r\n\r\nIt is an enchanting prospect at any time and under any circumstances;\r\nbut on a beautiful morning in mid-October, when you haven\'t seen it for\r\nfive years, and are still young! and almost every stock and stone that\r\nmeets your eye, every sound, every scent, has some sweet and subtle\r\nreminder for you--\r\n\r\nLet the reader have no fear. I will not attempt to describe it. I\r\nshouldn\'t know where to begin (nor when to leave off!).\r\n\r\nNot but what many changes had been wrought; many old landmarks were\r\nmissing. And among them, as they found out a few minutes later, and much\r\nto their chagrin, the good old Morgue!\r\n\r\nThey inquired of a _gardien de la paix_, who told them that a new\r\nMorgue--"une bien jolie Morgue, ma foi!"--and much more commodious and\r\ncomfortable than the old one, had been built beyond Notre Dame, a little\r\nto the right.\r\n\r\n"Messieurs devraient voir \xc3\xa7a--on y est tr\xc3\xa8s bien!"\r\n\r\nBut Notre Dame herself was still there, and la Sainte Chapelle, and Le\r\nPont Neuf, and the equestrian statue of Henri IV. _C\'est toujours \xc3\xa7a!_\r\n\r\nAnd as they gazed and gazed, each framed unto himself, mentally, a\r\nlittle picture of the Thames they had just left--and thought of Waterloo\r\nBridge, and St. Paul\'s, and London--but felt no homesickness whatever,\r\nno desire to go back!\r\n\r\nAnd looking down the river westward there was but little change.\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand side the terraces and garden of the H\xc3\xb4tel de la\r\nRochemartel (the sculptured entrance of which was in the Rue de Lille)\r\nstill overtopped the neighboring houses and shaded the quay with tall\r\ntrees, whose lightly falling leaves yellowed the pavement for at least a\r\nhundred yards of frontage--or backage, rather; for this was but the rear\r\nof that stately palace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "A LITTLE PICTURE OF THE THAMES"]\r\n\r\n"I wonder if l\'Zouzou has come into his dukedom yet?" said Taffy.\r\n\r\nAnd Taffy the realist, Taffy the modern of moderns, also said many\r\nbeautiful things about old historical French dukedoms; which, in spite\r\nof their plentifulness, were so much more picturesque than English ones,\r\nand constituted a far more poetical and romantic link with the past;\r\npartly on account of their beautiful, high-sounding names!\r\n\r\n"Amaury de Brissac de Roncesvaulx de la Rochemartel-Boiss\xc3\xa9gur was a\r\ngenerous mouthful! Why, the very sound of it is redolent of the twelfth\r\ncentury! Not even Howard of Norfolk can beat that!"\r\n\r\nFor Taffy was getting sick of "this ghastly thin-faced time of ours," as\r\nhe sadly called it (quoting from a strange and very beautiful poem\r\ncalled "Faustine," which had just appeared in the _Spectator_--and which\r\nour three enthusiasts already knew by heart), and beginning to love all\r\nthings that were old and regal and rotten and forgotten and of bad\r\nrepute, and to long to paint them just as they really were.\r\n\r\n"Ah! they managed these things better in France, especially in the\r\ntwelfth century, and even the thirteenth!" said the Laird. "Still,\r\nHoward of Norfolk isn\'t bad at a pinch--_fote de myoo_!" he continued,\r\nwinking at Little Billee. And they promised themselves that they would\r\nleave cards on Zouzou, and, if he wasn\'t a duke, invite him to dinner;\r\nand also Dodor, if they could manage to find him.\r\n\r\nThen along the quay and up the Rue de Seine, and by well-remembered\r\nlittle mystic ways to the old studio in the Place St. Anatole des Arts.\r\n\r\nHere they found many changes: A row of new houses on the north side, by\r\nBaron Haussmann--the well-named; a boulevard was being constructed right\r\nthrough the place; but the old house had been respected, and, looking\r\nup, they saw the big north window of their good old abode blindless and\r\nblank and black but for a white placard in the middle of it with the\r\nwords: "\xc3\x80 louer. Un atelier, et une chambre \xc3\xa0 coucher."\r\n\r\nThey entered the court-yard through the little door in the porte\r\ncoch\xc3\xa8re, and beheld Madame Vinard standing on the step of her loge, her\r\narms akimbo, giving orders to her husband--who was sawing logs for\r\nfirewood, as usual at that time of the year--and telling him he was the\r\nmost helpless log of the lot.\r\n\r\nShe gave them one look, threw up her arms, and rushed at them, saying,\r\n"Ah, mon Dieu! les trois Angliches!"\r\n\r\nAnd they could not have complained of any lack of warmth in her\r\ngreeting, or in Monsieur Vinard\'s.\r\n\r\n"Ah! mais quel bonheur de vous revoir! Et comme vous avez bonne mine,\r\ntous! Et Monsieur Litrebili, donc! il a grandi!" etc., etc. "Mais vous\r\nallez boire la goutte avant tout--vite, Vinard! Le ratafia de cassis que\r\nMonsieur Durien nous a envoy\xc3\xa9 la semaine derni\xc3\xa8re!"\r\n\r\nAnd they were taken into the loge and made free of it--welcomed like\r\nprodigal sons; a fresh bottle of black-currant brandy was tapped, and\r\ndid duty for the fatted calf. It was an ovation, and made quite a stir\r\nin the quartier.\r\n\r\n_Le Retour des trois Angliches--cinq ans apr\xc3\xa8s!_\r\n\r\nShe told them all the news: about Bouchardy; Papelard; Jules Guinot, who\r\nwas now in the Minist\xc3\xa8re de la Guerre; Barizel, who had given up the\r\narts and gone into his father\'s business (umbrellas); Durien, who had\r\nmarried six months ago, and had a superb atelier in the Rue Taitbout,\r\nand was coining money; about her own family--Agla\xc3\xab, who was going to be\r\nmarried to the son of the charbonnier at the corner of the Rue de la\r\nCanicule--"un bon mariage; bien solide!" Niniche, who was studying the\r\npiano at the Conservatoire, and had won the silver medal; Isidore, who,\r\nalas! had gone to the bad--"perdu par les femmes! un si joli gar\xc3\xa7on,\r\nvous concevez! \xc3\xa7a ne lui a pas port\xc3\xa9 bonheur, par exemple!" And yet she\r\nwas proud! and said his father would never have had the pluck!\r\n\r\n"\xc3\x80 dix-huit ans, pensez donc!\r\n\r\n"And that good Monsieur Carrel; he is dead, you know! Ah, messieurs\r\nsavaient \xc3\xa7a? Yes, he died at Dieppe, his natal town, during the winter,\r\nfrom the consequences of an indigestion--que voulez-vous! He always had\r\nthe stomach so feeble!... Ah! the beautiful interment, messieurs! Five\r\nthousand people, in spite of the rain! Car il pleuvait averse! And M. le\r\nMaire and his adjunct walking behind the hearse, and the gendarmerie and\r\nthe douaniers, and a bataillon of the douzi\xc3\xa8me chasseurs-\xc3\xa0-pied, with\r\ntheir music, and all the sapper-pumpers, en grande tenue with their\r\nbeautiful brass helmets! All the town was there, following: so there was\r\nnobody left to see the procession go by! q\'c\'\xc3\xa9tait beau! Mon Dieu,\r\nq\'c\'\xc3\xa9tait beau! c\'que j\'ai pleur\xc3\xa9, d\'voir \xc3\xa7a! n\'est-ce-pas, Vinard?"\r\n\r\n"Dame, oui, ma biche! j\'crois ben! It might have been Monsieur le Maire\r\nhimself that one was interring in person!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, \xc3\xa7a! voyons, Vinard; thou\'rt not going to compare the Maire of\r\nDieppe to a painter like Monsieur Carrel?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, ma biche! But still, M. Carrel was a great man all the\r\nsame, in his way. Besides, I wasn\'t there--nor thou either, as to that!"\r\n\r\n"Mon Dieu! comme il est idiot, ce Vinard--of a stupidity to cut with a\r\nknife! Why, thou might\'st almost be a Mayor thyself, sacred imbecile\r\nthat thou art!"\r\n\r\nAnd an animated discussion arose between husband and wife as to the\r\nrespective merits of a country mayor on one side and a famous painter\r\nand member of the Institute on the other, during which _les trois\r\nAngliches_ were left out in the cold. When Madame Vinard had\r\nsufficiently routed her husband, which did not take very long, she\r\nturned to them again, and told them that she had started a _magasin de\r\nbric-\xc3\xa0-brac_, "vous verres \xc3\xa7a!"\r\n\r\nYes, the studio had been to let for three months. Would they like to see\r\nit? Here were the keys. They would, of course, prefer to see it by\r\nthemselves, alone; "je comprends \xc3\xa7a! et vous verrez ce que vous verrez!"\r\nThen they must come and drink once more again the drop, and inspect her\r\n_magasin de bric-\xc3\xa0-brac_.\r\n\r\nSo they went up, all three, and let themselves into the old place where\r\nthey had been so happy--and one of them for a while so miserable!\r\n\r\nIt was changed indeed.\r\n\r\nBare of all furniture, for one thing; shabby and unswept, with a\r\npathetic air of dilapidation, spoliation, desecration, and a musty,\r\nshut-up smell; the window so dirty you could hardly see the new houses\r\nopposite; the floor a disgrace!\r\n\r\nAll over the walls were caricatures in charcoal and white chalk, with\r\nmore or less incomprehensible legends; very vulgar and trivial and\r\ncoarse, some of them, and pointless for _trois Angliches_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'AH! THE BEAUTIFUL INTERMENT, MESSIEURS!\'"]\r\n\r\nBut among these (touching to relate) they found, under a square of\r\nplate-glass that had been fixed on the wall by means of an oak frame,\r\nLittle Billee\'s old black-and-white-and-red chalk sketch of Trilby\'s\r\nleft foot, as fresh as if it had been done only yesterday! Over it was\r\nwritten: "Souvenir de la Grande Trilby, par W. B. (Litrebili)." And\r\nbeneath, carefully engrossed on imperishable parchment, and pasted on\r\nthe glass, the following stanzas:\r\n\r\n     "Pauvre Trilby--la belle et bonne et ch\xc3\xa8re!\r\n      Je suis son pied. Devine qui voudra\r\n      Quel tendre ami, la ch\xc3\xa9rissant nagu\xc3\xa8re,\r\n      Encadra d\'elle (et d\'un amour sinc\xc3\xa8re)\r\n    Ce souvenir charmant qu\'un caprice inspira--\r\n              Qu\'un souffle emportera!\r\n\r\n     "J\'\xc3\xa9tais jumeau: qu\'est devenu mon fr\xc3\xa8re?\r\n      H\xc3\xa9las! H\xc3\xa9las! L\'Amour nous \xc3\xa9gara.\r\n      L\'\xc3\x89ternit\xc3\xa9 nous unira, j\'esp\xc3\xa8re;\r\n      Et nous ferons comme autrefois la paire\r\n    Au fond d\'un lit bien chaste o\xc3\xb9 nul ne troublera\r\n              Trilby--qui dormira.\r\n\r\n     "\xc3\x94 tendre ami, sans nous qu\'allez-vous faire?\r\n      La porte est close o\xc3\xb9 Trilby demeura.\r\n      Le Paradis est loin ... et sur la terre\r\n      (Qui nous fut douce et lui sera l\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa8re)\r\n    Pour trouver nos pareils, si bien qu\'on cherchera--\r\n              Beau chercher l\'on aura!"\r\n\r\nTaffy drew a long breath into his manly bosom, and kept it there as he\r\nread this characteristic French doggerel (for so he chose to call this\r\ntouching little symphony in _\xc3\xa8re_ and _ra_). His huge frame thrilled\r\nwith tenderness and pity and fond remembrance, and he said to himself\r\n(letting out his breath): "Dear, dear Trilby! Ah! if you had only cared\r\nfor _me_, _I_ wouldn\'t have let you give me up--not for any one on\r\nearth. _You_ were the mate for _me_!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "PAUVRE TRILBY"]\r\n\r\nAnd that, as the reader has guessed long ago, was big Taffy\'s "history."\r\n\r\nThe Laird was also deeply touched, and could not speak. Had he been in\r\nlove with Trilby, too? Had he ever been in love with any one?\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t say. But he thought of Trilby\'s sweetness and unselfishness,\r\nher gayety, her innocent kissings and caressings, her drollery and\r\nfrolicsome grace, her way of filling whatever place she was in with her\r\npresence, the charming sight and the genial sound of her; and felt that\r\nno girl, no woman, no lady he had ever seen yet was a match for this\r\npoor waif and stray, this long-legged, cancan-dancing, quartier-latin\r\ngrisette, blanchisseuse de fin, "and Heaven knows what besides!"\r\n\r\n"Hang it all!" he mentally ejaculated, "I wish to goodness I\'d married\r\nher _myself_!"\r\n\r\nLittle Billee said nothing either. He felt unhappier than he had ever\r\nonce felt for five long years--to think that he could gaze on such a\r\nmemento as this, a thing so strongly personal to himself, with dry eyes\r\nand a quiet pulse! and he unemotionally, dispassionately, wished himself\r\ndead and buried for at least the thousand and first time!\r\n\r\nAll three possessed casts of Trilby\'s hands and feet and photographs of\r\nherself. But nothing so charmingly suggestive of Trilby as this little\r\nmasterpiece of a true artist, this happy fluke of a happy moment. It was\r\nTrilbyness itself, as the Laird thought, and should not be suffered to\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nThey took the keys back to Madame Vinard in silence.\r\n\r\nShe said: "Vous avez vu--n\'est-ce pas, messieurs?--le pied de Trilby!\r\nc\'est bien gentil! C\'est Monsieur Durien qui a fait mettre le verre,\r\nquand vous \xc3\xaates partis; et Monsieur Guinot qui a compos\xc3\xa9 _l\'\xc3\xa9pitaphe_.\r\nPauvre Trilby! qu\'est-ce qu\'elle est devenue! comme elle \xc3\xa9tait bonne\r\nfille, hein? et si belle! et comme elle \xc3\xa9tait vive elle \xc3\xa9tait vive elle\r\n\xc3\xa9tait vive! Et comme elle vous aimait tous bien--et surtout Monsieur\r\nLitrebili--n\'est-ce pas?"\r\n\r\nThen she insisted on giving them each another liqueur-glass of Durien\'s\r\nratafia de cassis, and took them to see her collection of bric-\xc3\xa0-brac\r\nacross the yard, a gorgeous show, and explained everything about it--how\r\nshe had begun in quite a small way, but was making it a big business.\r\n\r\n"Voyez cette pendule! It is of the time of Louis Onze, who gave it with\r\nhis own hands to Madame de Pompadour(!). I bought it at a sale in--"\r\n\r\n"Combiang?" said the Laird.\r\n\r\n"C\'est cent-cinquante francs, monsieur--c\'est bien bon march\xc3\xa9--une\r\nv\xc3\xa9ritable occasion, et--"\r\n\r\n"Je prong!" said the Laird, meaning "I take it!"\r\n\r\nThen she showed them a beautiful brocade gown "which she had picked up\r\nat a bargain at--"\r\n\r\n"Combiang?" said the Laird.\r\n\r\n"Ah, \xc3\xa7a, c\'est trois cents francs, monsieur. Mais--"\r\n\r\n"Je prong!" said the Laird.\r\n\r\n"Et voici les souliers qui vont avec, et que--"\r\n\r\n"Je pr--"\r\n\r\nBut here Taffy took the Laird by the arm and dragged him by force out\r\nof this too seductive siren\'s cave.\r\n\r\nThe Laird told her where to send his purchases; and with many\r\nexpressions of love and good-will on both sides, they tore themselves\r\naway from Monsieur et Madame Vinard.\r\n\r\nThe Laird, however, rushed back for a minute, and hurriedly whispered to\r\nMadame Vinard: "Oh--er--le piay de Trilby--sur le mure, vous savvy--avec\r\nle verre et toot le reste--coopy le mure--comprenny?... Combiang?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, monsieur!" said Madame Vinard--"c\'est un peu difficile, vous\r\nsavez--couper un mur comme \xc3\xa7a! On parlera au propri\xc3\xa9taire si vous\r\nvoulez, et \xc3\xa7a pourrait peut-\xc3\xaatre s\'arranger, si c\'est en bois! seulement\r\nil fau--"\r\n\r\n"Je prong!" said the Laird, and waved his hand in farewell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'JE PRONG!\'"]\r\n\r\nThey went up the Rue Vieille des Mauvais Ladres, and found that about\r\ntwenty yards of a high wall had been pulled down--just at the bend where\r\nthe Laird had seen the last of Trilby, as she turned round and kissed\r\nher hand to him--and they beheld, within, a quaint and ancient\r\nlong-neglected garden; a gray old garden, with tall, warty, black-boled\r\ntrees, and damp, green, mossy paths that lost themselves under the brown\r\nand yellow leaves and mould and muck which had drifted into heaps here\r\nand there, the accumulation of years--a queer old faded pleasance, with\r\nwasted bowers and dilapidated carved stone benches and weather-beaten\r\ndiscolored marble statues--noseless, armless, earless fauns and\r\nhamadryads! And at the end of it, in a tumble-down state of utter ruin,\r\na still inhabited little house, with shabby blinds and window-curtains,\r\nand broken window-panes mended with brown paper--a Pavillon de Flore,\r\nthat must have been quite beautiful a hundred years ago--the once\r\nmysterious love-resort of long-buried abb\xc3\xa9s with light hearts, and\r\nwell-forgotten lords and ladies gay--red-heeled, patched, powdered,\r\nfrivolous, and shameless, but oh! how charming to the imagination of\r\nthe nineteenth century! And right through the ragged lawn, (where lay,\r\nupset in the long dewy grass, a broken doll\'s perambulator by a tattered\r\nPunchinello) went a desecrating track made by cart-wheels and horses\'\r\nhoofs; and this, no doubt, was to be a new street--perhaps, as Taffy\r\nsuggested, "La Rue _Neuve_ des Mauvais Ladres!" (The _New_ Street of the\r\nBad Lepers!).\r\n\r\n"Ah, Taffy!" sententiously opined the Laird, with his usual wink at\r\nLittle Billee, "I\'ve no doubt the _old_ lepers were the best, bad as\r\nthey were!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite _sure_ of it!" said Taffy, with sad and sober conviction and\r\na long-drawn sigh. "I only wish I had a chance of painting one--just as\r\nhe really was!"\r\n\r\nHow often they had speculated on what lay hidden behind that lofty old\r\nbrick wall! and now this melancholy little peep into the once festive\r\npast, the touching sight of this odd old poverty-stricken abode of\r\nHeaven knows what present grief and desolation, which a few strokes of\r\nthe pickaxe had laid bare, seemed to chime in with their own gray mood\r\nthat had been so bright and sunny an hour ago; and they went on their\r\nway quite dejectedly, for a stroll through the Luxembourg Gallery and\r\nGardens.\r\n\r\nThe same people seemed to be still copying the same pictures in the\r\nlong, quiet, genial room, so pleasantly smelling of oil-paint--Rosa\r\nBonheur\'s "Labourage Nivernais"--H\xc3\xa9bert\'s "Malaria"--Couture\'s "Decadent\r\nRomans."\r\n\r\nAnd in the formal dusty gardens were the same pioupious and zouzous\r\nstill walking with the same nounous, or sitting by their sides on\r\nbenches by formal ponds with gold and silver fish in them--and just the\r\nsame old couples petting the same toutous and loulous![A]\r\n\r\n[A] _Glossary._--Pioupiou (_alias_ pousse-caillou, _alias_\r\ntourlourou)--a private soldier of the line. Zouzou--a Zouave. Nounou--a\r\nwet-nurse with a pretty ribboned cap and long streamers. Toutou--a\r\nnondescript French lapdog, of no breed known to Englishmen (a regular\r\nlittle beast!) Loulou--a Pomeranian dog--not much better.\r\n\r\nThen they thought they would go and lunch at le p\xc3\xa8re Trin\'s--the\r\nRestaurant de la Couronne, in the Rue du Luxembourg--for the sake of\r\nauld lang syne! But when they got there the well-remembered fumes of\r\nthat humble refectory, which had once seemed not unappetizing, turned\r\ntheir stomachs. So they contented themselves with warmly greeting le\r\np\xc3\xa8re Trin, who was quite overjoyed to see them again, and anxious to\r\nturn the whole establishment topsy-turvy that he might entertain such\r\nguests as they deserved.\r\n\r\nThen the Laird suggested an omelet at the Caf\xc3\xa9 de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on. But Taffy\r\nsaid, in his masterful way, "Damn the Caf\xc3\xa9 de l\'Od\xc3\xa9on!"\r\n\r\nAnd hailing a little open fly, they drove to Ledoyen\'s, or some such\r\nplace, in the Champs \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es, where they feasted as became three\r\nprosperous Britons out for a holiday in Paris--three irresponsible\r\nmusketeers, lords of themselves and Lutetia, _beati possidentes!_--and\r\nafterwards had themselves driven in an open carriage and pair through\r\nthe Bois de Boulogne to the f\xc3\xaate de St. Cloud (or what still remained of\r\nit, for it lasts six weeks), the scene of so many of Dodor\'s and\r\nZouzou\'s exploits in past years, and found it more amusing than the\r\nLuxembourg Gardens; the lively and irrepressible spirit of Dodor seemed\r\nto pervade it still.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn\'t want the presence of a Dodor to make the blue-bloused\r\nsons of the Gallic people (and its neatly shod, white-capped daughters)\r\ndelightful to watch as they take their pleasure. And the Laird (thinking\r\nperhaps of Hampstead Heath on an Easter Monday) must not be blamed for\r\nonce more quoting his favorite phrase--the pretty little phrase with\r\nwhich the most humorous and least exemplary of British parsons began his\r\nfamous journey to France.\r\n\r\nWhen they came back to the hotel to dress and dine, the Laird found he\r\nwanted a pair of white gloves for the concert--"Oon pair de gong blong,"\r\nas he called it--and they walked along the boulevards till they came to\r\na haberdasher\'s shop of very good and prosperous appearance, and, going\r\nin, were received graciously by the "patron," a portly little bourgeois,\r\nwho waved them to a tall and aristocratic and very well dressed young\r\ncommis behind the counter, saying, "Une paire de gants blancs pour\r\nmonsieur."\r\n\r\nAnd what was the surprise of our three friends in recognizing Dodor!\r\n\r\nThe gay Dodor, Dodor l\'irr\xc3\xa9sistible, quite unembarrassed by his\r\nposition, was exuberant in his delight at seeing them again, and\r\nintroduced them to the patron and his wife and daughter, Monsieur,\r\nMadame, and Mademoiselle Passefil. And it soon became pretty evident\r\nthat, in spite of his humble employment in that house, he was a great\r\nfavorite in that family, and especially with mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'OON PAIR DE GONG BLONG\'"]\r\n\r\nIndeed, Monsieur Passefil invited our three heroes to stay and dine then\r\nand there; but they compromised matters by asking Dodor to come and dine\r\nwith _them_ at the hotel, and he accepted with alacrity.\r\n\r\nThanks to Dodor, the dinner was a very lively one, and they soon forgot\r\nthe regretful impressions of the day.\r\n\r\nThey learned that he hadn\'t got a penny in the world, and had left the\r\narmy, and had for two years kept the books at le p\xc3\xa8re Passefil\'s and\r\nserved his customers, and won his good opinion and his wife\'s, and\r\nespecially his daughter\'s; and that soon he was to be not only his\r\nemployer\'s partner, but his son-in-law; and that, in spite of his\r\nimpecuniosity, he had managed to impress them with the fact that in\r\nmarrying a Rigolot de Lafarce she was making a very splendid match\r\nindeed!\r\n\r\nHis brother-in-law, the Honorable Jack Reeve, had long cut him for a bad\r\nlot. But his sister, after a while, had made up her mind that to marry\r\nMlle. Passefil wasn\'t the worst he could do; at all events, it would\r\nkeep him out of England, and _that_ was a comfort! And passing through\r\nParis, she had actually called on the Passefil family, and they had\r\nfallen prostrate before such splendor; and no wonder, for Mrs. Jack\r\nReeve was one of the most beautiful, elegant, and fashionable women in\r\nLondon, the smartest of the smart.\r\n\r\n"And how about l\'Zouzou?" asked Little Billee.\r\n\r\n"Ah, old Gontran! I don\'t see much of him. We no longer quite move in\r\nthe same circles, you know; not that he\'s proud, or me either! but he\'s\r\na sub-lieutenant in the Guides--an officer! Besides, his brother\'s\r\ndead, and he\'s the Duc de la Rochemartel, and a special pet of the\r\nEmpress; he makes her laugh more than anybody! He\'s looking out for the\r\nbiggest heiress he can find, and he\'s pretty safe to catch her, with\r\nsuch a name as that! In fact, they say he\'s caught her already--Miss\r\nLavinia Hunks, of Chicago. Twenty million dollars!--at least, so the\r\n_Figaro_ says!"\r\n\r\nThen he gave them news of other old friends; and they did not part till\r\nit was time for them to go to the Cirque des Bashibazoucks, and after\r\nthey had arranged to dine with his future family on the following day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9 was a long double file of cabs and carriages\r\nslowly moving along to the portals of that huge hall, Le Cirque des\r\nBashibazoucks. Is it there still, I wonder? I don\'t mind betting not!\r\nJust at this period of the Second Empire there was a mania for\r\ndemolition and remolition (if there is such a word), and I have no doubt\r\nmy Parisian readers would search the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9 for the Salle des\r\nBashibazoucks in vain!\r\n\r\nOur friends were shown to their stalls, and looked round in surprise.\r\nThis was before the days of the Albert Hall, and they had never been in\r\nsuch a big place of the kind before, or one so regal in aspect, so\r\ngorgeously imperial with white and gold and crimson velvet, so dazzling\r\nwith light, so crammed with people from floor to roof, and cramming\r\nitself still.\r\n\r\nA platform carpeted with crimson cloth had been erected in front of the\r\ngates where the horses had once used to come in, and their fair riders,\r\nand the two jolly English clowns; and the beautiful nobleman with the\r\nlong frock-coat and brass buttons, and soft high boots, and four-in-hand\r\nwhip--"la chambri\xc3\xa8re."\r\n\r\nIn front of this was a lower stand for the orchestra. The circus itself\r\nwas filled with stalls--stalles d\'orchestre. A pair of crimson curtains\r\nhid the entrance to the platform at the back, and by each of these stood\r\na small page, ready to draw it aside and admit the diva.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the orchestra was by a small door under the platform,\r\nand some thirty or forty chairs and music-stands, grouped around the\r\nconductor\'s estrade, were waiting for the band.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee looked round, and recognized many countrymen and\r\ncountrywomen of his own--many great musical celebrities especially, whom\r\nhe had often met in London. Tiers upon tiers of people rose up all round\r\nin a widening circle, and lost themselves in a dazy mist of light at the\r\ntop--it was like a picture by Martin! In the imperial box were the\r\nEnglish ambassador and his family, with an august British personage\r\nsitting in the middle, in front, his broad blue ribbon across his breast\r\nand his opera-glass to his royal eyes.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee had never felt so excited, so exhilarated by such a show\r\nbefore, nor so full of eager anticipation. He looked at his programme,\r\nand saw that the Hungarian band (the first that had yet appeared in\r\nwestern Europe, I believe) would play an overture of gypsy dances. Then\r\nMadame Svengali would sing "un air connu, sans accompagnement," and\r\nafterwards other airs, including the "Nussbaum" of Schumann (for the\r\nfirst time in Paris, it seemed). Then a rest of ten minutes; then more\r\ncs\xc3\xa1rd\xc3\xa1s; then the diva would sing "Malbrouck s\'en va-t\'en guerre," of\r\nall things in the world! and finish up with "un impromptu de Chopin,\r\nsans paroles."\r\n\r\nTruly a somewhat incongruous bill of fare!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GECKO]\r\n\r\nClose on the stroke of nine the musicians came in and took their seats.\r\nThey were dressed in the foreign hussar uniform that has now become so\r\nfamiliar. The first violin had scarcely sat down before friends\r\nrecognized in him their old friend Gecko.\r\n\r\nJust as the clock struck, Svengali, in irreproachable evening dress,\r\ntall and stout and quite splendid in appearance, notwithstanding his\r\nlong black mane (which had been curled), took his place at his desk. Our\r\nfriends would have known him at a glance, in spite of the wonderful\r\nalteration time and prosperity had wrought in his outward man.\r\n\r\nHe bowed right and left to the thunderous applause that greeted him,\r\ngave his three little baton-taps, and the lovely music began at once. We\r\nhave grown accustomed to strains of this kind during the last twenty\r\nyears; but they were new then, and their strange seduction was a\r\nsurprise as well as an enchantment.\r\n\r\nBesides, no such band as Svengali\'s had ever been heard; and in\r\nlistening to this overture the immense crowd almost forgot that it was a\r\nmere preparation for a great musical event, and tried to encore it. But\r\nSvengali merely turned round and bowed--there were to be no encores that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThen a moment of silence and breathless suspense--curiosity on tiptoe!\r\n\r\nThen the two little page-boys each drew a silken rope, and the curtains\r\nparted and looped themselves up on each side symmetrically; and a tall\r\nfemale figure appeared, clad in what seemed like a classical dress of\r\ncloth of gold, embroidered with garnets and beetles\' wings; her snowy\r\narms and shoulders bare, a gold coronet of stars on her head, her thick\r\nlight brown hair tied behind and flowing all down her back to nearly her\r\nknees, like those ladies in hair-dressers\' shops who sit with their\r\nbacks to the plate-glass windows to advertise the merits of some\r\nparticular hair-wash.\r\n\r\nShe walked slowly down to the front, her hands hanging at her sides in\r\nquite a simple fashion, and made a slight inclination of her head and\r\nbody towards the imperial box, and then to right and left. Her lips and\r\ncheeks were rouged; her dark level eyebrows nearly met at the bridge of\r\nher short high nose. Through her parted lips you could see her large\r\nglistening white teeth; her gray eyes looked straight at Svengali.\r\n\r\nHer face was thin, and had a rather haggard expression, in spite of its\r\nartificial freshness; but its contour was divine, and its character so\r\ntender, so humble, so touchingly simple and sweet, that one melted at\r\nthe sight of her. No such magnificent or seductive apparition has ever\r\nbeen seen before or since on any stage or platform--not even Miss Ellen\r\nTerry as the priestess of Artemis in the late Laureate\'s play, "The\r\nCup."\r\n\r\nThe house rose at her as she came down to the front; and she bowed again\r\nto right and left, and put her hand to her heart quite simply and with a\r\nmost winning natural gesture, an adorable gaucherie--like a graceful and\r\nunconscious school-girl, quite innocent of stage deportment.\r\n\r\n_It was Trilby!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrilby the tone-deaf, who couldn\'t sing one single note in tune! Trilby,\r\nwho couldn\'t tell a C from an F!!\r\n\r\nWhat was going to happen!\r\n\r\nOur three friends were almost turned to stone in the immensity of their\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nYet the big Taffy was trembling all over; the Laird\'s jaw had all but\r\nfallen on to his chest; Little Billee was staring, staring his eyes\r\nalmost out of his head. There was something, to them, so strange and\r\nuncanny about it all; so oppressive, so anxious, so momentous!\r\n\r\nThe applause had at last subsided. Trilby stood with her hands behind\r\nher, one foot (the left one) on a little stool that had been left there\r\non purpose, her lips parted, her eyes on Svengali\'s, ready to begin.\r\n\r\nHe gave his three beats, and the band struck a chord. Then, at another\r\nbeat from him, but in her direction, she began, without the slightest\r\nappearance of effort, without any accompaniment whatever, he still\r\nbeating time--conducting her, in fact, just as if she had been an\r\norchestra herself:\r\n\r\n    "Au clair de la lune,\r\n       Mon ami Pierrot!\r\n     Pr\xc3\xaate-moi ta plume\r\n       Pour \xc3\xa9crire un mot.\r\n     Ma chandelle est morte ...\r\n       Je n\'ai plus de feu!\r\n     Ouvre-moi ta porte\r\n       Pour l\'amour de Dieu!"\r\n\r\nThis was the absurd old nursery rhyme with which la Svengali chose to\r\nmake her d\xc3\xa9but before the most critical audience in the world! She sang\r\nit three times over--the same verse. There is but one.\r\n\r\nThe first time she sang it without any expression whatever--not the\r\nslightest. Just the words and the tune; in the middle of her voice, and\r\nnot loud at all; just as a child sings who is thinking of something\r\nelse; or just as a young French mother sings who is darning socks by a\r\ncradle, and rocking her baby to sleep with her foot.\r\n\r\nBut her voice was so immense in its softness, richness, freshness, that\r\nit seemed to be pouring itself out from all round; its intonation\r\nabsolutely, mathematically pure; one felt it to be not only faultless,\r\nbut infallible; and the seduction, the novelty of it, the strangely\r\nsympathetic quality! How can one describe the quality of a peach or a\r\nnectarine to those who have only known apples?\r\n\r\nUntil la Svengali appeared, the world had only known apples--Catalanis,\r\nJenny Linds, Grisis, Albonis, Pattis! The best apples that can be, for\r\nsure--but still only apples!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "AU CLAIR DE LA LUNE"]\r\n\r\nIf she had spread a pair of large white wings and gracefully fluttered\r\nup to the roof and perched upon the chandelier, she could not have\r\nproduced a greater sensation. The like of that voice has never been\r\nheard, nor ever will be again. A woman archangel might sing like that,\r\nor some enchanted princess out of a fairy-tale.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee had already dropped his face into his hands and hid his\r\neyes in his pocket-handkerchief; a big tear had fallen on to Taffy\'s\r\nleft whisker; the Laird was trying hard to keep his tears back.\r\n\r\nShe sang the verse a second time, with but little added expression and\r\nno louder; but with a sort of breathy widening of her voice that made it\r\nlike a broad heavenly smile of universal motherhood turned into sound.\r\nOne felt all the genial gayety and grace and impishness of Pierrot and\r\nColumbine idealized into frolicsome beauty and holy innocence, as though\r\nthey were performing for the saints in Paradise--a baby Columbine, with\r\na cherub for clown! The dream of it all came over you for a second or\r\ntwo--a revelation of some impossible golden age--priceless--never to be\r\nforgotten! How on earth did she do it?\r\n\r\nLittle Billee had lost all control over himself, and was shaking with\r\nhis suppressed sobs--Little Billee, who hadn\'t shed a single tear for\r\nfive long years! Half the people in the house were in tears, but tears\r\nof sheer delight, of delicate inner laughter.\r\n\r\nThen she came back to earth, and saddened and veiled and darkened her\r\nvoice as she sang the verse for the third time; and it was a great and\r\nsombre tragedy, too deep for any more tears; and somehow or other poor\r\nColumbine, forlorn and betrayed and dying, out in the cold at\r\nmidnight--sinking down to hell, perhaps--was making her last frantic\r\nappeal! It was no longer Pierrot and Columbine--it was Marguerite--it\r\nwas Faust! It was the most terrible and pathetic of all possible human\r\ntragedies, but expressed with no dramatic or histrionic exaggeration of\r\nany sort; by mere tone, slight, subtle changes in the quality of the\r\nsound--too quick and elusive to be taken count of, but to be felt with,\r\noh, what poignant sympathy!\r\n\r\nWhen the song was over the applause did not come immediately, and she\r\nwaited with her kind wide smile, as if she were well accustomed to wait\r\nlike this; and then the storm began, and grew and spread and rattled and\r\nechoed--voice, hands, feet, sticks, umbrellas!--and down came the\r\nbouquets, which the little page-boys picked up; and Trilby bowed to\r\nfront and right and left in her simple _d\xc3\xa9bonnaire_ fashion. It was her\r\nusual triumph. It had never failed, whatever the audience, whatever the\r\ncountry, whatever the song.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee didn\'t applaud. He sat with his head in his hands, his\r\nshoulders still heaving. He believed himself to be fast asleep and in a\r\ndream, and was trying his utmost not to wake; for a great happiness was\r\nhis. It was one of those nights to be marked with a white stone!\r\n\r\nAs the first bars of the song came pouring out of her parted lips (whose\r\nshape he so well remembered), and her dovelike eyes looked straight over\r\nSvengali\'s head, straight in his own direction--nay, _at_ him--something\r\nmelted in his brain, and all his long-lost power of loving came back\r\nwith a rush.\r\n\r\nIt was like the sudden curing of a deafness that has been lasting for\r\nyears. The doctor blows through your nose into your Eustachian tube with\r\na little India-rubber machine; some obstacle gives way, there is a snap\r\nin your head, and straightway you hear better than you had ever heard in\r\nall your life, almost too well; and all your life is once more changed\r\nfor you!\r\n\r\nAt length he sat up again, in the middle of la Svengali\'s singing of the\r\n"Nussbaum," and saw her; and saw the Laird sitting by him, and Taffy,\r\ntheir eyes riveted on Trilby, and knew for certain that it was _no_\r\ndream this time, and his joy was almost a pain!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    "OUVRE-MOI TA PORTE\r\n      POUR L\'AMOUR DE DIEU!"\r\n]\r\n\r\nShe sang the "Nussbaum" (to its heavenly accompaniment) as simply as she\r\nhad sung the previous song. Every separate note was a highly finished\r\ngem of sound, linked to the next by a magic bond.\r\n\r\nYou did not require to be a lover of music to fall beneath the spell of\r\nsuch a voice as that; the mere melodic phrase had all but ceased to\r\nmatter. Her phrasing, consummate as it was, was as simple as a child\'s.\r\n\r\nIt was as if she said: "See! what does the composer count for? Here is\r\nabout as beautiful a song as was ever written, with beautiful words to\r\nmatch, and the words have been made French for you by one of your\r\nsmartest poets! But what do the words signify, any more than the tune,\r\nor even the language? The \'Nussbaum\' is neither better nor worse than\r\n\'Mon ami Pierrot\' when _I_ am the singer; for I am _Svengali_; and you\r\nshall hear nothing, see nothing, think of nothing but _Svengali,\r\nSvengali, Svengali_!"\r\n\r\nIt was the apotheosis of voice and virtuosity! It was "il bel canto"\r\ncome back to earth after a hundred years--the bel canto of Vivarelli,\r\nlet us say, who sang the same song every night to the same King of Spain\r\nfor a quarter of a century, and was rewarded with a dukedom, and wealth\r\nbeyond the dreams of avarice.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, here was this immense audience, made up of the most\r\ncynically critical people in the world, and the most anti-German,\r\nassisting with rapt ears and streaming eyes at the imagined spectacle of\r\na simple German damsel, a M\xc3\xa4dchen, a Fr\xc3\xa4ulein, just "verlobte"--a future\r\nHausfrau--sitting under a walnut-tree in some suburban garden--\xc3\xa0\r\nBerlin!--and around her her family and their friends, probably drinking\r\nbeer and smoking long porcelain pipes, and talking politics or business,\r\nand cracking innocent elaborate old German jokes; with bated breath,\r\nlest they should disturb her maiden dream of love! And all as though it\r\nwere a scene in Elysium, and the Fr\xc3\xa4ulein a nymph of many-fountained\r\nIda, and her people Olympian gods and goddesses.\r\n\r\nAnd such, indeed, they were when Trilby sang of them!\r\n\r\nAfter this, when the long, frantic applause had subsided, she made a\r\ngracious bow to the royal British opera-glass (which had never left her\r\nface), and sang "Ben Bolt" in English!\r\n\r\nAnd then Little Billee remembered there was such a person as Svengali in\r\nthe world, and recalled his little flexible flageolet!\r\n\r\n"That is how I teach Gecko; that is how I teach la bedite Honorine; that\r\nis how I teach il bel canto.... It was lost, il bel canto--and I found\r\nit in a dream--I, Svengali!"\r\n\r\nAnd his old cosmic vision of the beauty and sadness of things, the very\r\nheart of them, and their pathetic evanescence, came back with a tenfold\r\nclearness--that heavenly glimpse beyond the veil! And with it a crushing\r\nsense of his own infinitesimal significance by the side of this glorious\r\npair of artists, one of whom had been his friend and the other his\r\nlove--a love who had offered to be his humble mistress and slave, not\r\nfeeling herself good enough to be his wife!\r\n\r\nIt made him sick and faint to remember, and filled him with hot shame,\r\nand then and there his love for Trilby became as that of a dog for its\r\nmaster!\r\n\r\nShe sang once more--"Chanson de Printemps," by Gounod (who was present,\r\nand seemed very hysterical), and the first part of the concert was over,\r\nand people had time to draw breath and talk over this new wonder, this\r\nrevelation of what the human voice could achieve; and an immense hum\r\nfilled the hall--astonishment, enthusiasm, ecstatic delight!\r\n\r\nBut our three friends found little to say--for what _they_ felt there\r\nwere as yet no words!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "MALBROUCK S\'EN VA-T\'EN GUERRE"]\r\n\r\nTaffy and the Laird looked at Little Billee, who seemed to be looking\r\ninward at some transcendent dream of his own; with red eyes, and his\r\nface all pale and drawn, and his nose very pink, and rather thicker than\r\nusual; and the dream appeared to be out of the common blissful, though\r\nhis eyes were swimming still, for his smile was almost idiotic in its\r\nrapture!\r\n\r\nThe second part of the concert was still shorter than the first, and\r\ncreated, if possible, a wilder enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nTrilby only sang twice.\r\n\r\nHer first song was "Malbrouck s\'en va-t\'en guerre."\r\n\r\nShe began it quite lightly and merrily, like a jolly march; in the\r\nmiddle of her voice, which had not as yet revealed any exceptional\r\ncompass or range. People laughed quite frankly at the first verse:\r\n\r\n    "Malbrouck s\'en va-t\'en guerre--\r\n       _Mironton, mironton, mirontaine!_\r\n     Malbrouck s\'en va-t\'en guerre....\r\n       Ne sais quand reviendra!\r\n       Ne sais quand reviendra!\r\n       Ne sais quand reviendra!"\r\n\r\nThe _mironton, mirontaine_ was the very essence of high martial resolve\r\nand heroic self-confidence; one would have led a forlorn hope after\r\nhearing it once!\r\n\r\n    "Il reviendra-z-\xc3\xa0 P\xc3\xa2ques--\r\n       _Mironton, mironton, mirontaine!_\r\n     Il reviendra-z-\xc3\xa0 P\xc3\xa2ques....\r\n       Ou ... \xc3\xa0 la Trinit\xc3\xa9!"\r\n\r\nPeople still laughed, though the _mironton, mirontaine_ betrayed an\r\nuncomfortable sense of the dawning of doubts and fears--vague\r\nforebodings!\r\n\r\n    "La Trinit\xc3\xa9 se passe--\r\n       _Mironton, mironton, mirontaine!_\r\n     La Trinit\xc3\xa9 se passe....\r\n       Malbrouck ne revient pas!"\r\n\r\nAnd here, especially in the _mironton, mirontaine_, a note of anxiety\r\nrevealed itself--so poignant, so acutely natural and human, that it\r\nbecame a personal anxiety of one\'s own, causing the heart to beat, and\r\none\'s breath was short.\r\n\r\n    "Madame \xc3\xa0 sa tour monte--\r\n       _Mironton, mironton, mirontaine!_\r\n     Madame \xc3\xa0 sa tour monte,\r\n       Si haut qu\'elle peut monter!"\r\n\r\nOh! How one\'s heart went with her! Anne! Sister Anne! Do you see\r\nanything?\r\n\r\n    "Elle voit de loin son page--\r\n       _Mironton, mironton, mirontaine!_\r\n     Elle voit de loin son page,\r\n       Tout de noir habill\xc3\xa9!"\r\n\r\nOne is almost sick with the sense of impending calamity--it is all but\r\nunbearable!\r\n\r\n    "Mon page--mon beau page!--\r\n       _Mironton, mironton, mirontaine!_\r\n     Mon page--mon beau page!\r\n       Quelles nouvelles apportez?"\r\n\r\nAnd here Little Billee begins to weep again, and so does everybody else!\r\nThe _mironton, mirontaine_ is an agonized wail of suspense--poor\r\nbereaved duchess!--poor Sarah Jennings! Did it all announce itself to\r\nyou just like that?\r\n\r\nAll this while the accompaniment had been quite simple--just a few\r\nobvious ordinary chords.\r\n\r\nBut now, quite suddenly, without a single modulation or note of warning,\r\ndown goes the tune a full major third, from E to C--into the graver\r\ndepths of Trilby\'s great contralto--so solemn and ominous that there is\r\nno more weeping, but the flesh creeps; the accompaniment slows and\r\nelaborates itself; the march becomes a funeral march, with muted\r\nstrings, and quite slowly:\r\n\r\n    "Aux nouvelles que j\'apporte--\r\n       _Mironton, mironton, mirontaine!_\r\n     Aux nouvelles que j\'apporte,\r\n      Vos beaux yeux vont pleurer!"\r\n\r\nRicher and richer grows the accompaniment. The _mironton, mirontaine_\r\nbecomes a dirge--\r\n\r\n    "Quittez vos habits roses--\r\n       _Mironton, mironton, mirontaine!_\r\n     Quittez vos habits roses,\r\n       Et vos satins broch\xc3\xa9s!"\r\n\r\nHere the ding-donging of a big bell seems to mingle with the score; ...\r\nand very slowly, and so impressively that the news will ring forever in\r\nthe ears and hearts of those who hear it from la Svengali\'s lips:\r\n\r\n    "Le Sieur Malbrouck est mort--\r\n       _Mironton, mironton, mirontaine!_\r\n     Le Sieur--Malbrouck--est--mort!\r\n       Est mort--et enterr\xc3\xa9!"\r\n\r\nAnd thus it ends quite abruptly!\r\n\r\nAnd this heart-rending tragedy, this great historical epic in two dozen\r\nlines, at which some five or six thousand gay French people are\r\nsniffling and mopping their eyes like so many Niobes, is just a common\r\nold French comic song--a mere nursery ditty, like "Little Bo-peep"--to\r\nthe tune,\r\n\r\n    "We won\'t go home till morning,\r\n      Till daylight doth appear."\r\n\r\nAnd after a second or two of silence (oppressive and impressive as that\r\nwhich occurs at a burial when the handful of earth is being dropped on\r\nthe coffin-lid) the audience bursts once more into madness; and la\r\nSvengali, who accepts no encores, has to bow for nearly five minutes,\r\nstanding amid a sea of flowers....\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    "AUX NOUVELLES QUE J\'APPORTE,\r\n      VOS BEAUX YEUX VONT PLEURER!"\r\n]\r\n\r\nThen comes her great and final performance. The orchestra swiftly plays\r\nthe first four bars of the bass in Chopin\'s Impromptu (A flat); and\r\nsuddenly, without words, as a light nymph catching the whirl of a double\r\nskipping-rope, la Svengali breaks in, and vocalizes that astounding\r\npiece of music that so few pianists can even play; but no pianist has\r\never played it like this; no piano has ever given out such notes as\r\nthese!\r\n\r\nEvery single phrase is a string of perfect gems, of purest ray serene,\r\nstrung together on a loose golden thread! The higher and shriller she\r\nsings, the sweeter it is; higher and shriller than any woman had ever\r\nsung before.\r\n\r\nWaves of sweet and tender laughter, the very heart and essence of\r\ninnocent, high-spirited girlhood, alive to all that is simple and joyous\r\nand elementary in nature--the freshness of the morning, the ripple of\r\nthe stream, the click of the mill, the lisp of wind in the trees, the\r\nsong of the lark in the cloudless sky--the sun and the dew, the scent of\r\nearly flowers and summer woods and meadows--the sight of birds and bees\r\nand butterflies and frolicsome young animals at play--all the sights and\r\nscents and sounds that are the birthright of happy children, happy\r\nsavages in favored climes--things within the remembrance and the reach\r\nof most of us! All this, the memory and the feel of it, are in Trilby\'s\r\nvoice as she warbles that long, smooth, lilting, dancing laugh, that\r\nwondrous song without words; and those who hear feel it all, and\r\nremember it with her. It is irresistible; it forces itself on you; no\r\nwords, no pictures, could ever do the like! So that the tears that are\r\nshed out of all these many French eyes are tears of pure, unmixed\r\ndelight in happy reminiscence! (Chopin, it is true, may have meant\r\nsomething quite different--a hot-house, perhaps, with orchids and arum\r\nlilies and tuberoses and hydrangeas--but that is neither here nor\r\nthere.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UN IMPROMPTU DE CHOPIN]\r\n\r\nThen comes the slow movement, the sudden adagio, with its capricious\r\nornaments--the waking of the virgin heart, the stirring of the sap, the\r\ndawn of love; its doubts and fears and questionings; and the mellow,\r\npowerful, deep chest notes are like the pealing of great golden bells,\r\nwith a light little pearl shower tinkling round--drops from the upper\r\nfringe of her grand voice as she shakes it....\r\n\r\nThen back again the quick part, childhood once more, da capo, only\r\nquicker! hurry, hurry! but distinct as ever. Loud and shrill and sweet\r\nbeyond compare--drowning the orchestra; of a piercing quality quite\r\nineffable; a joy there is no telling; a clear, purling, crystal stream\r\nthat gurgles and foams and bubbles along over sunlit stones; "a wonder,\r\na world\'s delight!"\r\n\r\nAnd there is not a sign of effort, of difficulty overcome. All through,\r\nTrilby smiles her broad, angelic smile; her lips well parted, her big\r\nwhite teeth glistening as she gently jerks her head from side to side in\r\ntime to Svengali\'s b\xc3\xa2ton, as if to shake the willing notes out quicker\r\nand higher and shriller....\r\n\r\nAnd in a minute or two it is all over, like the lovely bouquet of\r\nfireworks at the end of the show, and she lets what remains of it die\r\nout and away like the afterglow of fading Bengal fires--her voice\r\nreceding into the distance--coming back to you like an echo from all\r\nround, from anywhere you please--quite soft--hardly more than a breath;\r\nbut _such_ a breath! Then one last chromatically ascending rocket,\r\npianissimo, up to E in alt, and then darkness and silence!\r\n\r\nAnd after a little pause the many-headed rises as one, and waves its\r\nhats and sticks and handkerchiefs, and stamps and shouts.... "Vive la\r\nSvengali! Vive la Svengali!"\r\n\r\nSvengali steps on to the platform by his wife\'s side and kisses her\r\nhand; and they both bow themselves backward through the curtains, which\r\nfall, to rise again and again and again on this astounding pair!\r\n\r\nSuch was la Svengali\'s d\xc3\xa9but in Paris.\r\n\r\nIt had lasted little over an hour, one quarter of which, at least, had\r\nbeen spent in plaudits and courtesies!\r\n\r\nThe writer is no musician, alas! (as, no doubt, his musical readers have\r\nfound out by this) save in his thraldom to music of not too severe a\r\nkind, and laments the clumsiness and inadequacy of this wild (though\r\nsomewhat ambitious) attempt to recall an impression received more than\r\nthirty years ago; to revive the ever-blessed memory of that\r\nunforgettable first night at the Cirque des Bashibazoucks.\r\n\r\nWould that I could transcribe here Berlioz\'s famous series of twelve\r\narticles, entitled "La Svengali," which were republished from _La Lyre\r\n\xc3\x89olienne_, and are now out of print!\r\n\r\nOr Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier\'s elaborate rhapsody, "Madame Svengali--Ange, ou\r\nFemme?" in which he proves that one need not have a musical ear (he\r\nhadn\'t) to be enslaved by such a voice as hers, any more than the eye\r\nfor beauty (this he _had_) to fall the victim of "her celestial form\r\nand face." It is enough, he says, to be simply human! I forget in which\r\njournal this eloquent tribute appeared; it is not to be found in his\r\ncollected works.\r\n\r\nOr the intemperate diatribe by Herr Blagner (as I will christen him) on\r\nthe tyranny of the prima donna called "Svengalismus"; in which he\r\nattempts to show that mere virtuosity carried to such a pitch is mere\r\nviciosity--base acrobatismus of the vocal chords, a hysteric appeal to\r\nmorbid Gallic "sentimentalismus"; and that this monstrous development of\r\na phenomenal larynx, this degrading cultivation and practice of the\r\nabnormalismus of a mere physical peculiarity, are death and destruction\r\nto all true music; since they place Mozart and Beethoven, and even\r\n_himself_, on a level with Bellini, Donizetti, Offenbach--any Italian\r\ntune-tinkler, any ballad-monger of the hated Paris pavement! and can\r\nmake the highest music of all (even _his own_) go down with the common\r\nFrench herd at the very first hearing, just as if it were some idiotic\r\nrefrain of the caf\xc3\xa9 chantant!\r\n\r\nSo much for Blagnerismus _v_. Svengalismus.\r\n\r\nBut I fear there is no space within the limits of this humble tale for\r\nthese masterpieces of technical musical criticism.\r\n\r\nBesides, there are other reasons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur three heroes walked back to the boulevards, the only silent ones\r\namid the throng that poured through the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9, as the Cirque\r\ndes Bashibazoucks emptied itself of its over-excited audience.\r\n\r\nThey went arm in arm, as usual; but this time Little Billee was in the\r\nmiddle. He wished to feel on each side of him the warm and genial\r\ncontact of his two beloved old friends. It seemed as if they had\r\nsuddenly been restored to him, after five long years of separation; his\r\nheart was overflowing with affection for them, too full to speak just\r\nyet! Overflowing, indeed, with the love of love, the love of life, the\r\nlove of death--the love of all that is, and ever was, and ever will be!\r\njust as in his old way.\r\n\r\nHe could have hugged them both in the open street, before the whole\r\nworld; and the delight of it was that this was no dream; about that\r\nthere was no mistake. He was himself again at last, after five years,\r\nand wide awake; and he owed it all to Trilby!\r\n\r\nAnd what did he feel for Trilby? He couldn\'t tell yet. It was too vast\r\nas yet to be measured; and, alas! it was weighted with such a burden of\r\nsorrow and regret that he might well put off the thought of it a little\r\nwhile longer, and gather in what bliss he might: like the man whose\r\nhearing has been restored after long years, he would revel in the mere\r\nphysical delight of hearing for a space, and not go out of his way as\r\nyet to listen for the bad news that was already in the air, and would\r\ncome to roost quite soon enough.\r\n\r\nTaffy and the Laird were silent also; Trilby\'s voice was still in their\r\nears and hearts, her image in their eyes, and utter bewilderment still\r\noppressed them and kept them dumb.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm and balmy night, almost like mid-summer; and they stopped\r\nat the first caf\xc3\xa9 they met on the Boulevard de la Madeleine (_comme\r\nautrefois_), and ordered bocks of beer, and sat at a little table on\r\nthe pavement, the only one unoccupied; for the caf\xc3\xa9 was already crowded,\r\nthe hum of lively talk was great, and "la Svengali" was in every mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Laird was the first to speak. He emptied his bock at a draught, and\r\ncalled for another, and lit a cigar, and said, "I don\'t believe it was\r\nTrilby, after all!" It was the first time her name had been mentioned\r\nbetween them that evening--and for five years!\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" said Taffy. "Can you doubt it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! that was Trilby," said Little Billee.\r\n\r\nThen the Laird proceeded to explain that, putting aside the\r\nimpossibility of Trilby\'s ever being taught to sing in tune, and her\r\nwell-remembered loathing for Svengali, he had narrowly scanned her face\r\nthrough his opera-glass, and found that in spite of a likeness quite\r\nmarvellous there were well-marked differences. Her face was narrower and\r\nlonger, her eyes larger, and their expression not the same; then she\r\nseemed taller and stouter, and her shoulders broader and more drooping,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nBut the others wouldn\'t hear of it, and voted him cracked, and declared\r\nthey even recognized the peculiar twang of her old speaking voice in the\r\nvoice she now sang with, especially when she sang low down. And they all\r\nthree fell to discussing the wonders of her performance like everybody\r\nelse all round; Little Billee leading, with an eloquence and a seeming\r\nof technical musical knowledge that quite impressed them, and made them\r\nfeel happy and at ease; for they were anxious for his sake about the\r\neffect this sudden and so unexpected sight of her would have upon him\r\nafter all that had passed.\r\n\r\nHe seemed transcendently happy and elate--incomprehensibly so, in\r\nfact--and looked at them both with quite a new light in his eyes, as if\r\nall the music he had heard had trebled not only his joy in being alive,\r\nbut his pleasure at being with them. Evidently he had quite outgrown his\r\nold passion for her, and that was a comfort indeed!\r\n\r\nBut Little Billee knew better.\r\n\r\nHe knew that his old passion for her had all come back, and was so\r\noverwhelming and immense that he could not feel it just yet, nor yet the\r\nhideous pangs of a jealousy so consuming that it would burn up his life.\r\nHe gave himself another twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nBut he had not to wait so long. He woke up after a short, uneasy sleep\r\nthat very night, to find that the flood was over him; and he realized\r\nhow hopelessly, desperately, wickedly, insanely he loved this woman, who\r\nmight have been his, but was now the wife of another man; a greater than\r\nhe, and one to whom she owed it that she was more glorious than any\r\nother woman on earth--a queen among queens--a goddess! for what was any\r\nearthly throne compared to that she established in the hearts and souls\r\nof all who came within the sight and hearing of her! beautiful as she\r\nwas besides--beautiful, beautiful! And what must be her love for the man\r\nwho had taught her and trained her, and revealed her towering genius to\r\nherself and to the world!--a man resplendent also, handsome and tall and\r\ncommanding--a great artist from the crown of his head to the sole of his\r\nfoot!\r\n\r\nAnd the remembrance of them--hand in hand, master and pupil, husband and\r\nwife--smiling and bowing in the face of all that splendid tumult they\r\nhad called forth and could not quell, stung and tortured and maddened\r\nhim so that he could not lie still, but got up and raged and rampaged up\r\nand down his hot, narrow, stuffy bedroom, and longed for his old\r\nfamiliar brain-disease to come back and narcotize his trouble, and be\r\nhis friend, and stay with him till he died!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THEM--HAND IN HAND"]\r\n\r\nWhere was he to fly for relief from such new memories as these, which\r\nwould never cease; and the old memories, and all the glamour and grace\r\nof them that had been so suddenly called out of the grave? And how could\r\nhe escape, now that he felt the sight of her face and the sound of her\r\nvoice would be a craving--a daily want--like that of some poor starving\r\noutcast for warmth and meat and drink?\r\n\r\nAnd little innocent, pathetic, ineffable, well-remembered sweetnesses of\r\nher changing face kept painting themselves on his retina; and\r\nincomparable tones of this new thing, her voice, her infinite voice,\r\nwent ringing in his head, till he all but shrieked aloud in his agony.\r\n\r\nAnd then the poisoned and delirious sweetness of those mad kisses,\r\n\r\n        "by hopeless fancy feigned\r\n    On lips that are for others"!\r\n\r\nAnd then the grewsome physical jealousy, that miserable inheritance of\r\nall artistic sons of Adam, that plague and torment of the dramatic,\r\nplastic imagination, which can idealize so well, and yet realize, alas!\r\nso keenly. After three or four hours spent like this, he could stand it\r\nno longer; madness was lying his way. So he hurried on a garment, and\r\nwent and knocked at Taffy\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Good God! what\'s the matter with you?" exclaimed the good Taffy, as\r\nLittle Billee tumbled into his room, calling out:\r\n\r\n"Oh, Taffy, Taffy, I\'ve g-g-gone mad, I think!" And then, shivering all\r\nover, and stammering incoherently, he tried to tell his friend what was\r\nthe matter with him, with great simplicity.\r\n\r\nTaffy, in much alarm, slipped on his trousers and made Little Billee get\r\ninto his bed, and sat by his side holding his hand. He was greatly\r\nperplexed, fearing the recurrence of another attack like that of five\r\nyears back. He didn\'t dare leave him for an instant to wake the Laird\r\nand send for a doctor.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Little Billee buried his face in the pillow and began to sob,\r\nand some instinct told Taffy this was the best thing that could happen.\r\nThe boy had always been a highly strung, emotional, over-excitable,\r\nover-sensitive, and quite uncontrolled mammy\'s-darling, a cry-baby sort\r\nof chap, who had never been to school. It was all a part of his genius,\r\nand also a part of his charm. It would do him good once more to have a\r\ngood blub after five years! After a while Little Billee grew quieter,\r\nand then suddenly he said: "What a miserable ass you must think me, what\r\nan unmanly duffer!"\r\n\r\n"Why, my friend?"\r\n\r\n"Why, for going on in this idiotic way. I really couldn\'t help it. I\r\nwent mad, I tell you. I\'ve been walking up and down my room all night,\r\ntill everything seemed to go round."\r\n\r\n"So have I."\r\n\r\n"You? What for?"\r\n\r\n"The very same reason."\r\n\r\n"_What!_"\r\n\r\n"I was just as fond of Trilby as you were. Only she happened to prefer\r\n_you_."\r\n\r\n"_What!_" cried Little Billee again. "_You_ were fond of Trilby?"\r\n\r\n"I believe you, my boy!"\r\n\r\n"In _love_ with her?"\r\n\r\n"I believe you, my boy!"\r\n\r\n"She never knew it, then!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'I BELIEVE YOU, MY BOY!\'"]\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, she did."\r\n\r\n"She never told me, then!"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t she? That\'s like her. _I_ told _her_, at all events. I asked her\r\nto marry me."\r\n\r\n"Well--I _am_ damned! When?"\r\n\r\n"That day we took her to Meudon, with Jeannot, and dined at the Garde\r\nChamp\xc3\xaatre\'s, and she danced the cancan with Sandy."\r\n\r\n"Well--I _am_--And she _refused_ you?"\r\n\r\n"Apparently so."\r\n\r\n"Well, I--Why on earth did she refuse you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I suppose she\'d already begun to fancy _you_, my friend. _Il y en a\r\ntoujours un autre!_"\r\n\r\n"Fancy _me_--prefer _me_--to _you_?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes. It _does_ seem odd--eh, old fellow? But there\'s no\r\naccounting for tastes, you know. She\'s built on such an ample scale\r\nherself, I suppose, that she likes little uns--contrast, you see. She\'s\r\nvery maternal, I think. Besides, you\'re a smart little chap; and you\r\nain\'t half bad; and you\'ve got brains and talent, and lots of cheek, and\r\nall that. I\'m rather a _ponderous_ kind of party."\r\n\r\n"Well--I _am_ damned!"\r\n\r\n"_C\'est comme \xc3\xa7a!_ I took it lying down, you see."\r\n\r\n"Does the Laird know?"\r\n\r\n"No; and I don\'t want him to--nor anybody else."\r\n\r\n"Taffy, what a regular downright old trump you are!"\r\n\r\n"Glad you think so; anyhow, we\'re both in the same boat, and we\'ve got\r\nto make the best of it. She\'s another man\'s wife, and probably she\'s\r\nvery fond of him. I\'m sure she ought to be, cad as he is, after all he\'s\r\ndone for her. So there\'s an end of it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! there\'ll never be an end of it for _me_--never--never--oh, never,\r\nmy God! She would have married me but for my mother\'s meddling, and that\r\nstupid old ass, my uncle. What a wife! Think of all she must have in her\r\nheart and brain, only to _sing_ like that! And, O Lord! how beautiful\r\nshe is--a goddess! Oh, the brow and cheek and chin, and the way her\r\nhead\'s put on! did you _ever_ see anything like it! Oh, if only I hadn\'t\r\nwritten and told my mother I was going to marry her! why, we should have\r\nbeen man and wife for five years by this time--living at\r\nBarbizon--painting away like mad! Oh, what a heavenly life! Oh, curse\r\nall officious meddling with other people\'s affairs! Oh! oh!..."\r\n\r\n"There you go again! What\'s the good? and where do _I_ come in, my\r\nfriend? _I_ should have been no better off, old fellow--worse than ever,\r\nI think."\r\n\r\nThen there was a long silence.\r\n\r\nAt length Little Billee said:\r\n\r\n"Taffy, I can\'t tell you what a trump you are. All I\'ve ever thought of\r\nyou--and God knows that\'s enough--will be nothing to what I shall always\r\nthink of you after this."\r\n\r\n"All right, old chap."\r\n\r\n"And now I think _I_\'m all right again, for a time--and I shall cut back\r\nto bed. Good-night! Thanks more than I can ever express!" And Little\r\nBillee, restored to his balance, cut back to his own bed just as the day\r\nwas breaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Seventh\r\n\r\n    "The moon made thy lips pale, beloved;\r\n         The wind made thy bosom chill;\r\n           The night did shed\r\n           On thy dear head\r\n     Its frozen dew, and thou didst lie\r\n     Where the bitter breath of the naked sky\r\n         Might visit thee at will."\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning our three friends lay late abed, and breakfasted in their\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nThey had all three passed "white nights"--even the Laird, who had tossed\r\nabout and pressed a sleepless pillow till dawn, so excited had he been\r\nby the wonder of Trilby\'s reincarnation, so perplexed by his own doubts\r\nas to whether it was really Trilby or not.\r\n\r\nAnd certain haunting tones of her voice, that voice so cruelly sweet\r\n(which clove the stillness with a clang so utterly new, so strangely\r\nheart-piercing and seductive, that the desire to hear it once more\r\nbecame nostalgic--almost an ache!), certain bits and bars and phrases of\r\nthe music she had sung, unspeakable felicities and facilities of\r\nexecution; sudden exotic warmths, fragrances, tendernesses, graces,\r\ndepths, and breadths; quick changes from grave to gay, from rough to\r\nsmooth, from great metallic brazen clangors to soft golden suavities;\r\nall the varied modes of sound we try so vainly to borrow from vocal\r\nnature by means of wind and reed and string--all this new "Trilbyness"\r\nkept echoing in his brain all night (for he was of a nature deeply\r\nmusical), and sleep had been impossible to him.\r\n\r\n    "As when we dwell upon a word we know,\r\n     Repeating, till the word we know so well\r\n     Becomes a wonder, and we know not why,"\r\n\r\nso dwelt the Laird upon the poor old tune "Ben Bolt," which kept singing\r\nitself over and over again in his tired consciousness, and maddened him\r\nwith novel, strange, unhackneyed, unsuspected beauties such as he had\r\nnever dreamed of in any earthly music.\r\n\r\nIt had become a wonder, and he knew not why!\r\n\r\nThey spent what was left of the morning at the Louvre, and tried to\r\ninterest themselves in the "Marriage of Cana," and the "Woman at the\r\nWell," and Vandyck\'s man with the glove, and the little princess of\r\nVelasquez, and Lisa Gioconda\'s smile: it was of no use trying. There was\r\nno sight worth looking at in all Paris but Trilby in her golden raiment;\r\nno other princess in the world; no smile but hers, when through her\r\nparted lips came bubbling Chopin\'s Impromptu. They had not long to stay\r\nin Paris, and they must drink of that bubbling fountain once\r\nmore--_co\xc3\xbbte que co\xc3\xbbte!_ They went to the Salle des Bashibazoucks, and\r\nfound that all seats all over the house had been taken for days and\r\nweeks; and the "queue" at the door had already begun! and they had to\r\ngive up all hopes of slaking this particular thirst.\r\n\r\nThen they went and lunched perfunctorily, and talked desultorily over\r\nlunch, and read criticisms of la Svengali\'s d\xc3\xa9but in the morning\r\npapers--a chorus of journalistic acclamation gone mad, a frenzied eulogy\r\nin every key--but nothing was good enough for them! Brand-new words were\r\nwanted--another language!\r\n\r\nThen they wanted a long walk, and could think of nowhere to go in all\r\nParis--that immense Paris, where they had promised themselves to see so\r\nmuch that the week they were to spend there had seemed too short!\r\n\r\nLooking in a paper, they saw it announced that the band of the Imperial\r\nGuides would play that afternoon in the Pr\xc3\xa9 Catelan, Bois de Boulogne,\r\nand thought they might as well walk there as anywhere else, and walk\r\nback again in time to dine with the Passefils--a prandial function which\r\ndid not promise to be very amusing; but still it was something to kill\r\nthe evening with, since they couldn\'t go and hear Trilby again.\r\n\r\nOutside the Pr\xc3\xa9 Catelan they found a crowd of cabs and carriages,\r\nsaddle-horses and grooms. One might have thought one\'s self in the\r\nheight of the Paris season. They went in, and strolled about here and\r\nthere, and listened to the band, which was famous (it has performed in\r\nLondon at the Crystal Palace), and they looked about and studied life,\r\nor tried to.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they saw, sitting with three ladies (one of whom, the eldest,\r\nwas in black), a very smart young officer, a guide, all red and green\r\nand gold, and recognized their old friend Zouzou. They bowed, and he\r\nknew them at once, and jumped up and came to them and greeted them\r\nwarmly, especially his old friend Taffy, whom he took to his mother--the\r\nlady in black--and introduced to the other ladies, the younger of whom,\r\nstrangely unlike the rest of her countrywomen, was so lamentably, so\r\npathetically plain that it would be brutal to attempt the cheap and easy\r\ntask of describing her. It was Miss Lavinia Hunks, the famous American\r\nmillionairess, and her mother. Then the good Zouzou came back and talked\r\nto the Laird and Little Billee.\r\n\r\nZouzou, in some subtle and indescribable way, had become very ducal\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nHe looked extremely distinguished, for one thing, in his beautiful\r\nguide\'s uniform, and was most gracefully and winningly polite. He\r\ninquired warmly after Mrs. and Miss Bagot, and begged Little Billee\r\nwould recall him to their amiable remembrance when he saw them again. He\r\nexpressed most sympathetically his delight to see Little Billee looking\r\nso strong and so well (Little Billee looked like a pallid little\r\nwashed-out ghost, after his white night).\r\n\r\nThey talked of Dodor. He said how attached he was to Dodor, and always\r\nshould be; but Dodor, it seemed, had made a great mistake in leaving the\r\narmy and going into a retail business (_petit commerce_). He had done\r\nfor himself--_d\xc3\xa9gringol\xc3\xa9!_ He should have stuck to the _dragons_--with a\r\nlittle patience and good conduct he would have "won his epaulet"--and\r\nthen one might have arranged for him a good little marriage--_un parti\r\nconvenable_--for he was "tr\xc3\xa8s joli gar\xc3\xa7on, Dodor! bonne tournure--et\r\ntr\xc3\xa8s gentiment n\xc3\xa9! C\'est tr\xc3\xa8s ancien, les Rigolot--dans le Poitou, je\r\ncrois--Lafarce, et tout \xc3\xa7a; tout \xc3\xa0 fait bien!"\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to realize that this polished and discreet and somewhat\r\npatronizing young man of the world was the jolly dog who had gone after\r\nLittle Billee\'s hat on all fours in the Rue Vieille des Mauvais Ladres\r\nand brought it back in his mouth--the Caryhatide!\r\n\r\nLittle Billee little knew that Monsieur le Duc de la\r\nRochemartel-Boiss\xc3\xa9gur had quite recently delighted a very small and\r\nselect and most august imperial supper-party at Compi\xc3\xa8gne with this very\r\nstory, not blinking a single detail of his own share in it--and had\r\ngiven a most touching and sympathetic description of "le joli petit\r\npeintre anglais qui s\'appelait Litrebili, et ne pouvait pas se tenir sur\r\nses jambes--et qui pleurait d\'amour fraternel dans les bras de mon\r\ncopain Dodor!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! Monsieur Gontran, ce que je donnerais pour avoir vu \xc3\xa7a!" had said\r\nthe greatest lady in France; "un de mes zouaves--\xc3\xa0 quatre pattes--dans\r\nla rue--un chapeau dans la bouche--oh--c\'est impayable!"\r\n\r\nZouzou kept these blackguard bohemian reminiscences for the imperial\r\ncircle alone--to which it was suspected that he was secretly rallying\r\nhimself. Among all outsiders--especially within the narrow precincts of\r\nthe cream of the noble Faubourg (which remained aloof from the\r\nTuileries)--he was a very proper and gentlemanlike person indeed, as his\r\nbrother had been--and, in his mother\'s fond belief, "tr\xc3\xa8s bien pensant,\r\ntr\xc3\xa8s bien vu, \xc3\xa0 Frohsdorf et \xc3\xa0 Rome."\r\n\r\n_On lui aurait donn\xc3\xa9 le bon Dieu sans confession_--as Madame Vinard had\r\nsaid of Little Billee--they would have shriven him at sight, and\r\nadmitted him to the holy communion on trust!\r\n\r\nHe did not present Little Billee and the Laird to his mother, nor to\r\nMrs. and Miss Hunks; that honor was reserved for "the Man of Blood"\r\nalone; nor did he ask where they were staying, nor invite them to call\r\non him. But in parting he expressed the immense pleasure it had given\r\nhim to meet them again, and the hope he had of some day shaking their\r\nhands in London.\r\n\r\nAs the friends walked back to Paris together, it transpired that "the\r\nMan of Blood" had been invited by Madame Duchesse M\xc3\xa8re (Maman Duchesse,\r\nas Zouzou called her) to dine with her next day, and meet the Hunkses at\r\na furnished apartment she had taken in the Place Vend\xc3\xb4me; for they had\r\nlet (to the Hunkses) the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Rochemartel in the Rue de Lille;\r\nthey had also been obliged to let their place in the country, le ch\xc3\xa2teau\r\nde Boiss\xc3\xa9gur (to Monsieur Despoires, or "des Poires," as he chose to\r\nspell himself on his visiting-cards--the famous soap-manufacturer--"Un\r\ntr\xc3\xa8s brave homme, \xc3\xa0 ce qu\'on dit!" and whose only son, by-the-way, soon\r\nafter married Mademoiselle Jeanne-Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde d\'Amaury-Brissac de\r\nRoncesvaulx de Boiss\xc3\xa9gur de la Rochemartel).\r\n\r\n"Il ne fait pas gras chez nous \xc3\xa0 pr\xc3\xa9sent--je vous assure!" Madame\r\nDuchesse M\xc3\xa8re had pathetically said to Taffy--but had given him to\r\nunderstand that things would be very much better for her son, in the\r\nevent of his marriage with Miss Hunks.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" said Little Billee, on hearing this; "that grotesque\r\nlittle bogy in blue? Why, she\'s deformed--she squints--she\'s a dwarf,\r\nand looks like an idiot! Millions or no millions, the man who marries\r\nher is a felon! As long as there are stones to break and a road to break\r\nthem on, the able-bodied man who marries a woman like that for anything\r\nbut pity and kindness--and even then--dishonors himself, insults his\r\nancestry, and inflicts on his descendants a wrong that nothing will ever\r\nredeem--he nips them in the bud--he blasts them forever! He ought to be\r\ncut by his fellow-men--sent to Coventry--to jail--to penal servitude for\r\nlife! He ought to have a separate hell to himself when he dies. He ought\r\nto--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up, you little blaspheming ruffian!" said the Laird. "Where do\r\n_you_ expect to go to, yourself, with such frightful sentiments? And\r\nwhat would become of your beautiful old twelfth-century dukedoms, with a\r\nhundred yards of back-frontage opposite the Louvre, on a beautiful\r\nhistoric river, and a dozen beautiful historic names, and no money--if\r\n_you_ had your way?" and the Laird wunk his historic wink.\r\n\r\n"Twelfth-century dukedoms be damned!" said Taffy _au grand s\xc3\xa9rieux_, as\r\nusual. "Little Billee\'s quite right, and Zouzou makes me sick! Besides,\r\nwhat does she marry _him_ for--not for his beauty either, I guess! She\'s\r\nhis fellow-criminal, his deliberate accomplice, _particeps delicti_,\r\naccessory before the act and after! She has no right to marry at all!\r\ntar and feathers and a rail for both of them--and for Maman Duchesse\r\ntoo--and I suppose that\'s why I refused her invitation to dinner! and\r\nnow let\'s go and dine with Dodor--...anyhow Dodor\'s young woman doesn\'t\r\nmarry him for a dukedom--or even his \'de\'--_mais bien pour ses beaux\r\nyeux!_ and if the Rigolots of the future turn out less nice to look at\r\nthan their sire, and not quite so amusing, they will probably be a great\r\nimprovement on him in many other ways. There\'s room enough--and to\r\nspare!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "MAMAN DUCHESSE"]\r\n\r\n"\'Ear! \'ear!" said Little Billee (who always grew flippant when Taffy\r\ngot on his high horse). "Your \'ealth and song, sir--them\'s my sentiments\r\nto a T! What shall we \'ave the pleasure of drinkin\', after that wery nice\r\n\'armony?"\r\n\r\nAfter which they walked on in silence, each, no doubt, musing on the\r\ngeneral contrariness of things, and imagining what splendid little\r\nWynnes, or Bagots, or McAlisters might have been ushered into a decadent\r\nworld for its regeneration if fate had so willed it that a certain\r\nmagnificent and singularly gifted grisette, etc., etc., etc....\r\n\r\nMrs. and Miss Hunks passed them as they walked along, in a beautiful\r\nblue barouche with C springs--_un "huit-ressorts"_; Maman Duchesse\r\npassed them in a hired fly; Zouzou passed them on horseback; "tout\r\nParis" passed them; but they were none the wiser, and agreed that the\r\nshow was not a patch on that in Hyde Park during the London season.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Place de la Concorde it was that lovely hour of a\r\nfine autumn day in beautiful bright cities when all the lamps are lit in\r\nthe shops and streets and under the trees, and it is still daylight--a\r\nquickly fleeting joy; and as a special treat on this particular occasion\r\nthe sun set, and up rose the yellow moon over eastern Paris, and floated\r\nabove the chimney-pots of the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThey stopped to gaze at the homeward procession of cabs and carriages,\r\nas they used to do in the old times. Tout Paris was still passing; tout\r\nParis is very long.\r\n\r\nThey stood among a little crowd of sight-seers like themselves, Little\r\nBillee right in front--in the road.\r\n\r\nPresently a magnificent open carriage came by--more magnificent than\r\neven the Hunkses\', with liveries and harness quite vulgarly\r\nresplendent--almost Napoleonic.\r\n\r\nLolling back in it lay Monsieur et Madame Svengali--he with his\r\nbroad-brimmed felt sombrero over his long black curls, wrapped in costly\r\nfurs, smoking his big cigar of the Havana.\r\n\r\nBy his side la Svengali--also in sables--with a large black velvet hat\r\non, her light brown hair done up in a huge knot on the nape of her neck.\r\nShe was rouged and pearl-powdered, and her eyes were blackened beneath,\r\nand thus made to look twice their size; but in spite of all such\r\ndisfigurements she was a most splendid vision, and caused quite a little\r\nsensation in the crowd as she came slowly by.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee\'s heart was in his mouth. He caught Svengali\'s eye, and\r\nsaw him speak to her. She turned her head and looked at him standing\r\nthere--they both did. Little Billee bowed. She stared at him with a cold\r\nstare of disdain, and cut him dead--so did Svengali. And as they passed\r\nhe heard them both snigger--she with a little high-pitched, flippant\r\nsnigger worthy of a London bar-maid.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee was utterly crushed, and everything seemed turning round.\r\n\r\nThe Laird and Taffy had seen it all without losing a detail. The\r\nSvengalis had not even looked their way. The Laird said:\r\n\r\n"It\'s not Trilby--I swear! She could _never_ have done that--it\'s not\r\n_in_ her! and it\'s another face altogether--I\'m sure of it!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CUT DIRECT]\r\n\r\nTaffy was also staggered and in doubt. They caught hold of Little\r\nBillee, each by an arm, and walked him off to the boulevards. He was\r\nquite demoralized, and wanted not to dine at the Passefils\'. He wanted\r\nto go straight home at once. He longed for his mother as he used to long\r\nfor her when he was in trouble as a small boy and she was away from\r\nhome--longed for her desperately--to hug her and hold her and fondle\r\nher, and be fondled, for his own sake and hers; all his old love for her\r\nhad come back in full--with what arrears! all his old love for his\r\nsister, for his old home.\r\n\r\nWhen they went back to the hotel to dress (for Dodor had begged them to\r\nput on their best evening war-paint, so as to impress his future\r\nmother-in-law), Little Billee became fractious and intractable. And it\r\nwas only on Taffy\'s promising that he would go all the way to Devonshire\r\nwith him on the morrow, and stay with him there, that he could be got to\r\ndress and dine.\r\n\r\nThe huge Taffy lived entirely by his affections, and he hadn\'t many to\r\nlive by--the Laird, Trilby, and Little Billee.\r\n\r\nTrilby was unattainable, the Laird was quite strong and independent\r\nenough to get on by himself, and Taffy had concentrated all his\r\nfaculties of protection and affection on Little Billee, and was equal to\r\nany burden or responsibility all this instinctive young fathering might\r\ninvolve.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Little Billee had always been able to do quite\r\neasily, and better than any one else in the world, the very things Taffy\r\nmost longed to do himself and couldn\'t, and this inspired the good Taffy\r\nwith a chronic reverence and wonder he could not have expressed in\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nThen Little Billee was physically small and weak, and incapable of\r\nself-control. Then he was generous, amiable, affectionate, transparent\r\nas crystal, without an atom of either egotism or conceit; and had a gift\r\nof amusing you and interesting you by his talk (and its complete\r\nsincerity) that never palled; and even his silence was charming--one\r\nfelt so sure of him--so there was hardly any sacrifice, little or big,\r\nthat big Taffy was not ready and glad to make for Little Billee. On the\r\nother hand, there lay deep down under Taffy\'s surface irascibility and\r\nearnestness about trifles (and beneath his harmless vanity of the strong\r\nman), a long-suffering patience, a real humility, a robustness of\r\njudgment, a sincerity and all-roundness, a completeness of sympathy,\r\nthat made him very good to trust and safe to lean upon. Then his\r\npowerful, impressive aspect, his great stature, the gladiatorlike poise\r\nof his small round head on his big neck and shoulders, his huge deltoids\r\nand deep chest and slender loins, his clean-cut ankles and wrists, all\r\nthe long and bold and highly-finished athletic shapes of him, that easy\r\ngrace of strength that made all his movements a pleasure to watch, and\r\nany garment look well when he wore it--all this was a perpetual feast to\r\nthe quick, prehensile, \xc3\xa6sthetic eye. And then he had such a solemn,\r\nearnest, lovable way of bending pokers round his neck, and breaking them\r\non his arm, and jumping his own height (or near it), and lifting up\r\narm-chairs by one leg with one hand, and what not else!\r\n\r\nSo that there was hardly any sacrifice, little or big, that Little\r\nBillee would not accept from big Taffy as a mere matter of course--a\r\nfitting and proper tribute rendered by bodily strength to genius.\r\n\r\n_Par nobile fratrum_--well met and well mated for fast and long-enduring\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe family banquet at Monsieur Passefil\'s would have been dull but for\r\nthe irrepressible Dodor, and still more for the Laird of Cockpen, who\r\nrose to the occasion, and surpassed himself in geniality, drollery, and\r\neccentricity of French grammar and accent. Monsieur Passefil was also a\r\ndroll in his way, and had the quickly familiar, jocose facetiousness\r\nthat seems to belong to the successful middle-aged bourgeois all over\r\nthe world, when he\'s not pompous instead (he can even be both\r\nsometimes).\r\n\r\nMadame Passefil was not jocose. She was much impressed by the\r\naristocratic splendor of Taffy, the romantic melancholy and refinement\r\nof Little Billee, and their quiet and dignified politeness. She always\r\nspoke of Dodor as Monsieur de Lafarce, though the rest of the family\r\n(and one or two friends who had been invited) always called him Monsieur\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore, and he was officially known as Monsieur Rigolot.\r\n\r\nWhenever Madame Passefil addressed him or spoke of him in this\r\naristocratic manner (which happened very often), Dodor would wink at his\r\nfriends, with his tongue in his cheek. It seemed to amuse him beyond\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Ernestine was evidently too much in love to say anything,\r\nand seldom took her eyes off Monsieur Th\xc3\xa9odore, whom she had never seen\r\nin evening dress before. It must be owned that he looked very nice--more\r\nducal than even Zouzou--and to be Madame de Lafarce _en perspective_,\r\nand the future owner of such a brilliant husband as Dodor, was enough to\r\nturn a stronger little bourgeois head than Mademoiselle Ernestine\'s.\r\n\r\nShe was not beautiful, but healthy, well grown, well brought up, and\r\npresumably of a sweet, kind, and amiable disposition--an _ing\xc3\xa9nue_ fresh\r\nfrom her convent--innocent as a child, no doubt; and it was felt that\r\nDodor had done better for himself (and for his race) than Monsieur le\r\nDuc. Little Dodors need have no fear.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the ladies and gentlemen left the dining-room together, and\r\nsat in a pretty salon overlooking the boulevard, where cigarettes were\r\nallowed, and there was music. Mademoiselle Ernestine laboriously played\r\n"Les Cloches du Monast\xc3\xa8re" (by Monsieur Lef\xc3\xa9bure-W\xc3\xa9ly, if I\'m not\r\nmistaken). It\'s the most bourgeois piece of music I know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    "PETIT ENFANT, J\'AIMAIS D\'UN AMOUR TENDRE\r\n      MA M\xc3\x88RE ET DIEU--SAINTES AFFECTIONS!\r\n    PUIS MON AMOUR AUX FLEURS SE FIT ENTENDRE,\r\n      PUIS AUX OISEAUX, ET PUIS AUX PAPILLONS!"]\r\n\r\nThen Dodor, with his sweet high voice, so strangely pathetic and true,\r\nsang goody-goody little French songs of innocence (of which he seemed\r\nto have an endless r\xc3\xa9pertoire) to his future wife\'s conscientious\r\naccompaniment--to the immense delight, also, of all his future family,\r\nwho were almost in tears--and to the great amusement of the Laird, at\r\nwhom he winked in the most pathetic parts, putting his forefinger to the\r\nside of his nose, like Noah Claypole in _Oliver Twist_.\r\n\r\nThe wonder of the hour, la Svengali, was discussed, of course; it was\r\nunavoidable. But our friends did not think it necessary to reveal that\r\nshe was "la grande Trilby." That would soon transpire by itself.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, before the month was a week older the papers were full of\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nMadame Svengali--"la grande Trilby"--was the only daughter of the\r\nhonorable and reverend Sir Lord O\'Ferrall.\r\n\r\nShe had run away from the primeval forests and lonely marshes of le\r\nDublin, to lead a free-and-easy life among the artists of the quartier\r\nlatin of Paris--_une vie de boh\xc3\xa8me!_\r\n\r\nShe was the Venus Anadyomene from top to toe.\r\n\r\nShe was _blanche comme neige, avec un volcan dans le c\xc5\x93ur_.\r\n\r\nCasts of her alabaster feet could be had at Brucciani\'s, in the Rue de\r\nla Sourici\xc3\xa8re St. Denis. (He made a fortune.)\r\n\r\nMonsieur Ingres had painted her left foot on the wall of a studio in the\r\nPlace St. Anatole des Arts; and an eccentric Scotch milord (le Comte de\r\nPencock) had bought the house containing the flat containing the studio\r\ncontaining the wall on which it was painted, had had the house pulled\r\ndown, and the wall framed and glazed and sent to his castle of\r\n\xc3\x89dimbourg.\r\n\r\n(This, unfortunately, was in excess of the truth. It was found\r\nimpossible to execute the Laird\'s wish, on account of the material the\r\nwall was made of. So the Lord Count of Pencock--such was Madame Vinard\'s\r\nversion of Sandy\'s nickname--had to forego his purchase.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning our friends were in readiness to leave Paris; even the\r\nLaird had had enough of it, and longed to get back to his work again--a\r\n"Hari-kari in Yokohama." (He had never been to Japan; but no more had\r\nany one else in those early days.)\r\n\r\nThey had just finished breakfast, and were sitting in the court-yard of\r\nthe hotel, which was crowded, as usual.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee went into the hotel post-office to despatch a note to his\r\nmother. Sitting sideways there at a small table and reading letters was\r\nSvengali--of all people in the world. But for these two and a couple of\r\nclerks the room was empty.\r\n\r\nSvengali looked up; they were quite close together.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee, in his nervousness, began to shake, and half put out his\r\nhand, and drew it back again, seeing the look of hate on Svengali\'s\r\nface.\r\n\r\nSvengali jumped up, put his letters together, and passing by Little\r\nBillee on his way to the door, called him "verfluchter Schweinhund," and\r\ndeliberately spat in his face.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee was paralyzed for a second or two; then he ran after\r\nSvengali, and caught him just at the top of the marble stairs, and\r\nkicked him, and knocked off his hat, and made him drop all his letters.\r\nSvengali turned round and struck him over the mouth and made it bleed,\r\nand Little Billee hit out like a fury, but with no effect: he couldn\'t\r\nreach high enough, for Svengali was well over six feet.\r\n\r\nThere was a crowd round them in a minute, including the beautiful old\r\nman in the court suit and gold chain, who called out:\r\n\r\n"Vite! vite! un commissaire de police!"--a cry that was echoed all over\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nTaffy saw the row, and shouted, "Bravo, little un!" and jumping up from\r\nhis table, jostled his way through the crowd; and Little Billee,\r\nbleeding and gasping and perspiring and stammering, said:\r\n\r\n"He spat in my face, Taffy--damn him! I\'d never even spoken to him--not\r\na word, I swear!"\r\n\r\nSvengali had not reckoned on Taffy\'s being there; he recognized him at\r\nonce, and turned white.\r\n\r\nTaffy, who had dog-skin gloves on, put out his right hand, and deftly\r\nseized Svengali\'s nose between his fore and middle fingers and nearly\r\npulled it off, and swung his head two or three times backward and\r\nforward by it, and then from side to side, Svengali holding on to his\r\nwrist; and then, letting him go, gave him a sounding open-handed smack\r\non his right cheek--and a smack on the face from Taffy (even in play)\r\nwas no joke, I\'m told; it made one smell brimstone, and see and hear\r\nthings that didn\'t exist.\r\n\r\nSvengali gasped worse than Little Billee, and couldn\'t speak for a\r\nwhile. Then he said,\r\n\r\n"L\xc3\xa2che--grand l\xc3\xa2che! che fous enferrai mes t\xc3\xa9moins!"\r\n\r\n"At your orders!" said Taffy, in beautiful French, and drew out his\r\ncard-case, and gave him his card in quite the orthodox French manner,\r\nadding: "I shall be here till to-morrow at twelve--but that is my London\r\naddress, in case I don\'t hear from you before I leave. I\'m sorry, but\r\nyou really mustn\'t spit, you know--it\'s not done. I will come to you\r\nwhenever you send for me--even if I have to come from the end of the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"Tr\xc3\xa8s bien! tr\xc3\xa8s bien!" said a military-looking old gentleman close by,\r\nwho gave Taffy _his_ card, in case he might be of any service--and who\r\nseemed quite delighted at the row--and indeed it was really pleasant to\r\nnote with what a smooth, flowing, rhythmical spontaneity the good Taffy\r\ncould always improvise these swift little acts of summary retributive\r\njustice: no hurry or scurry or flurry whatever--not an inharmonious\r\ngesture, not an infelicitous line--the very poetry of violence, and its\r\nonly excuse!\r\n\r\nWhatever it was worth, this was Taffy\'s special gift, and it never\r\nfailed him at a pinch.\r\n\r\nWhen the commissaire de police arrived, all was over. Svengali had gone\r\naway in a cab, and Taffy put himself at the disposition of the\r\ncommissaire.\r\n\r\nThey went into the post-office and discussed it all with the old\r\nmilitary gentleman, and the major-domo in velvet, and the two clerks who\r\nhad seen the original insult. And all that was required of Taffy and his\r\nfriends for the present was "their names, prenames, titles, qualities,\r\nage, address, nationality, occupation," etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'VITE! VITE! UN COMMISSAIRE DE POLICE!\'"]\r\n\r\n"C\'est une affaire qui s\'arrangera autrement, et autre part!" had said\r\nthe military gentleman--monsieur le g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ral Comte de la Tour-aux-Loups.\r\n\r\nSo it blew over quite simply; and all that day a fierce unholy joy\r\nburned in Taffy\'s choleric blue eye.\r\n\r\nNot, indeed, that he had any wish to injure Trilby\'s husband, or meant\r\nto do him any grievous bodily harm, whatever happened. But he was glad\r\nto have given Svengali a lesson in manners.\r\n\r\nThat Svengali should injure _him_ never entered into his calculations\r\nfor a moment. Besides, he didn\'t believe Svengali would show fight; and\r\nin this he was not mistaken.\r\n\r\nBut he had, for hours, the feel of that long, thick, shapely Hebrew nose\r\nbeing kneaded between his gloved knuckles, and a pleasing sense of the\r\neffectiveness of the tweak he had given it. So he went about chewing the\r\ncud of that heavenly remembrance all day, till reflection brought\r\nremorse, and he felt sorry; for he was really the mildest-mannered man\r\nthat ever broke a head!\r\n\r\nOnly the sight of Little Billee\'s blood (which had been made to flow by\r\nsuch an unequal antagonist) had roused the old Adam.\r\n\r\nNo message came from Svengali to ask for the names and addresses of\r\nTaffy\'s seconds; so Dodor and Zouzou (not to mention Mister the general\r\nCount of the Tooraloorals, as the Laird called him) were left\r\nundisturbed; and our three musketeers went back to London clean of\r\nblood, whole of limb, and heartily sick of Paris.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee stayed with his mother and sister in Devonshire till\r\nChristmas, Taffy staying at the village inn.\r\n\r\nIt was Taffy who told Mrs. Bagot about la Svengali\'s all but certain\r\nidentity with Trilby, after Little Billee had gone to bed, tired and\r\nworn out, the night of their arrival.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" said poor Mrs. Bagot. "Why, that\'s the new singing woman\r\nwho\'s coming over here! There\'s an article about her in to-day\'s\r\n_Times_. It says she\'s a wonder, and that there\'s no one like her!\r\nSurely that can\'t be the Miss O\'Ferrall I saw in Paris!"\r\n\r\n"It seems impossible--but I\'m almost certain it is--and Willy has no\r\ndoubts in the matter. On the other hand, McAlister declares it isn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what trouble! So _that\'s_ why poor Willy looks so ill and\r\nmiserable! It\'s all come back again. Could she sing at all then, when\r\nyou knew her in Paris?"\r\n\r\n"Not a note--her attempts at singing were quite grotesque."\r\n\r\n"Is she still very beautiful?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; there\'s no doubt about that; more than ever!"\r\n\r\n"And her singing--is that so very wonderful? I remember that she had a\r\nbeautiful voice in speaking."\r\n\r\n"Wonderful? Ah, yes; I never heard or dreamed the like of it. Grisi,\r\nAlboni, Patti--not one of them to be mentioned in the same breath!"\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! Why, she must be simply irresistible! I wonder you\'re not\r\nin love with her yourself. How dreadful these sirens are, wrecking the\r\npeace of families!"\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t forget that she gave way at once at a word from you, Mrs.\r\nBagot; and she was very fond of Willy. She wasn\'t a siren then."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes--oh yes! that\'s true--she behaved very well--she did her duty--I\r\ncan\'t deny that! You must try and forgive me, Mr. Wynne--although I\r\ncan\'t forgive _her_!--that dreadful illness of poor Willy\'s--that bitter\r\ntime in Paris...."\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Bagot began to cry, and Taffy forgave. "Oh, Mr. Wynne--let us\r\nstill hope that there\'s some mistake--that it\'s only somebody like her!\r\nWhy, she\'s coming to sing in London after Christmas! My poor boy\'s\r\ninfatuation will only increase. What _shall_ I do?\r\n\r\n"Well--she\'s another man\'s wife, you see. So Willy\'s infatuation is\r\nbound to burn itself out as soon as he fully recognizes that important\r\nfact. Besides, she cut him dead in the Champs \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es--and her husband\r\nand Willy had a row next day at the hotel, and cuffed and kicked each\r\nother--that\'s rather a bar to any future intimacy, I think."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Wynne! my son cuffing and kicking a man whose wife he\'s in love\r\nwith! Good heavens!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was all right--the man had grossly insulted him--and Willy\r\nbehaved like a brick, and got the best of it in the end, and nothing\r\ncame of it. I saw it all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Wynne--and you didn\'t interfere?\'\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I interfered--everybody interfered. It was all right, I assure\r\nyou. No bones were broken on either side, and there was no nonsense\r\nabout calling out, or swords or pistols, and all that."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I SUPPOSE YOU DO ALL THIS KIND OF THING FOR MERE\r\nAMUSEMENT, MR. WYNNE?"]\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven!"\r\n\r\nIn a week or two Little Billee grew more like himself again, and painted\r\nendless studies of rocks and cliffs and sea--and Taffy painted with him,\r\nand was very content. The vicar and Little Billee patched up their feud.\r\nThe vicar also took an immense fancy to Taffy, whose cousin, Sir Oscar\r\nWynne, he had known at college, and lost no opportunity of being\r\nhospitable and civil to him. And his daughter was away in Algiers.\r\n\r\nAnd all "the nobility and gentry" of the neighborhood, including "the\r\npoor dear marquis" (one of whose sons was in Taffy\'s old regiment), were\r\ncivil and hospitable also to the two painters--and Taffy got as much\r\nsport as he wanted, and became immensely popular. And they had, on the\r\nwhole, a very good time till Christmas, and a very pleasant Christmas,\r\nif not an exuberantly merry one.\r\n\r\nAfter Christmas Little Billee insisted on going back to London--to paint\r\na picture for the Royal Academy; and Taffy went with him; and there was\r\ndulness in the house of Bagot--and many misgivings in the maternal heart\r\nof its mistress.\r\n\r\nAnd people of all kinds, high and low, from the family at the Court to\r\nthe fishermen on the little pier and their wives and children, missed\r\nthe two genial painters, who were the friends of everybody, and made\r\nsuch beautiful sketches of their beautiful coast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLa Svengali has arrived in London. Her name is in every mouth. Her\r\nphotograph is in the shop-windows. She is to sing at J----\'s monster\r\nconcerts next week. She was to have sung sooner, but it seems some hitch\r\nhas occurred--a quarrel between Monsieur Svengali and his first violin,\r\nwho is a very important person.\r\n\r\nA crowd of people as usual, only bigger, is assembled in front of the\r\nwindows of the Stereoscopic Company in Regent Street, gazing at\r\npresentments of Madame Svengali in all sizes and costumes. She is very\r\nbeautiful--there is no doubt of that; and the expression of her face is\r\nsweet and kind and sad, and of such a distinction that one feels an\r\nimperial crown would become her even better than her modest little\r\ncoronet of golden stars. One of the photographs represents her in\r\nclassical dress, with her left foot on a little stool, in something of\r\nthe attitude of the Venus of Milo, except that her hands are clasped\r\nbehind her back; and the foot is bare but for a Greek sandal, and so\r\nsmooth and delicate and charming, and with so rhythmical a set and curl\r\nof the five slender toes (the big one slightly tip-tilted and well apart\r\nfrom its longer and slighter and more aquiline neighbor), that this\r\npresentment of her sells quicker than all the rest.\r\n\r\nAnd a little man who, with two bigger men, has just forced his way in\r\nfront says to one of his friends: "Look, Sandy, look--_the foot!_ _Now_\r\nhave you got any doubts?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes--those are Trilby\'s toes, sure enough!" says Sandy. And they all\r\ngo in and purchase largely.\r\n\r\nAs far as I have been able to discover, the row between Svengali and his\r\nfirst violin had occurred at a rehearsal in Drury Lane Theatre.\r\n\r\nSvengali, it seems, had never been quite the same since the 15th of\r\nOctober previous, and that was the day he had got his face slapped and\r\nhis nose tweaked by Taffy in Paris. He had become short-tempered and\r\nirritable, especially with his wife (if she _was_ his wife). Svengali,\r\nit seems, had reasons for passionately hating Little Billee.\r\n\r\nHe had not seen him for five years--not since the Christmas festivity in\r\nthe Place St. Anatole, when they had sparred together after supper, and\r\nSvengali\'s nose had got in the way on this occasion, and had been made\r\nto bleed; but that was not why he hated Little Billee.\r\n\r\nWhen he caught sight of him standing on the curb in the Place de la\r\nConcorde and watching the procession of "tout Paris," he knew him\r\ndirectly, and all his hate flared up; he cut him dead, and made his wife\r\ndo the same.\r\n\r\nNext morning he saw him again in the hotel post-office, looking small\r\nand weak and flurried, and apparently alone; and being an Oriental\r\nIsraelite Hebrew Jew, he had not been able to resist the temptation of\r\nspitting in his face, since he must not throttle him to death.\r\n\r\nThe minute he had done this he had regretted the folly of it. Little\r\nBillee had run after him, and kicked and struck him, and he had returned\r\nthe blow and drawn blood; and then, suddenly and quite unexpectedly, had\r\ncome upon the scene that apparition so loathed and dreaded of old--the\r\npig-headed Yorkshireman--the huge British philistine, the irresponsible\r\nbull, the junker, the ex-Crimean, Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, who had always\r\nreminded him of the brutal and contemptuous sword-clanking,\r\nspur-jingling aristocrats of his own country--ruffians that treated Jews\r\nlike dogs. Callous as he was to the woes of others, the self-indulgent\r\nand highly-strung musician was extra sensitive about himself--a very\r\nbundle of nerves--and especially sensitive to pain and rough usage, and\r\nby no means physically brave. The stern, choleric, invincible blue eye\r\nof the hated Northern gentile had cowed him at once. And that violent\r\ntweaking of his nose, that heavy open-handed blow on his face, had so\r\nshaken and demoralized him that he had never recovered from it.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking about it always--night and day--and constantly dreaming\r\nat night that he was being tweaked and slapped over again by a colossal\r\nnightmare Taffy, and waking up in agonies of terror, rage, and shame.\r\nAll healthy sleep had forsaken him.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he was much older than he looked--nearly fifty--and far from\r\nsound. His life had been a long, hard struggle.\r\n\r\nHe had for his wife, slave, and pupil a fierce, jealous kind of\r\naffection that was a source of endless torment to him; for indelibly\r\ngraven in her heart, which he wished to occupy alone, was the\r\nnever-fading image of the little English painter, and of this she made\r\nno secret.\r\n\r\nGecko no longer cared for the master. All Gecko\'s doglike devotion was\r\nconcentrated on the slave and pupil, whom he worshipped with a fierce\r\nbut pure and unselfish passion. The only living soul that Svengali could\r\ntrust was the old Jewess who lived with them--his relative--but even she\r\nhad come to love the pupil as much as the master.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of this rehearsal at Drury Lane he (Svengali) was\r\nconducting and Madame Svengali was singing. He interrupted her several\r\ntimes, angrily and most unjustly, and told her she was singing out of\r\ntune, "like a verfluchter tomcat," which was quite untrue. She was\r\nsinging beautifully, "Home, Sweet Home."\r\n\r\nFinally he struck her two or three smart blows on her knuckles with his\r\nlittle b\xc3\xa2ton, and she fell on her knees, weeping and crying out:\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! Svengali! ne me battez pas, mon ami--je fais tout ce que je\r\npeux!"\r\n\r\nOn which little Gecko had suddenly jumped up and struck Svengali on the\r\nneck near the collar-bone, and then it was seen that he had a little\r\nbloody knife in his hand, and blood flowed from Svengali\'s neck, and at\r\nthe sight of it Svengali had fainted; and Madame Svengali had taken his\r\nhead on her lap, looking dazed and stupefied, as in a waking dream.\r\n\r\nGecko had been disarmed, but as Svengali recovered from his faint and\r\nwas taken home, the police had not been sent for, and the affair was\r\nhushed up, and a public scandal avoided. But la Svengali\'s first\r\nappearance, to Monsieur J----\'s despair, had to be put off for a week.\r\nFor Svengali would not allow her to sing without him; nor, indeed, would\r\nhe be parted from her for a minute, or trust her out of his sight.\r\n\r\nThe wound was a slight one. The doctor who attended Svengali described\r\nthe wife as being quite imbecile, no doubt from grief and anxiety. But\r\nshe never left her husband\'s bedside for a moment, and had the obedience\r\nand devotion of a dog.\r\n\r\nWhen the night came round for the postponed d\xc3\xa9but, Svengali was allowed\r\nby the doctor to go to the theatre, but he was absolutely forbidden to\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST VIOLIN LOSES HIS TEMPER]\r\n\r\nHis grief and anxiety at this were uncontrollable; he raved like a\r\nmadman; and Monsieur J---- was almost as bad.\r\n\r\nMonsieur J---- had been conducting the Svengali band at rehearsals\r\nduring the week, in the absence of its master--an easy task. It had been\r\nso thoroughly drilled and knew its business so well that it could almost\r\nconduct itself, and it had played all the music it had to play (much of\r\nwhich consisted of accompaniments to la Svengali\'s songs) many times\r\nbefore. Her r\xc3\xa9pertoire was immense, and Svengali had written these\r\norchestral scores with great care and felicity.\r\n\r\nOn the famous night it was arranged that Svengali should sit in a box\r\nalone, exactly opposite his wife\'s place on the platform, where she\r\ncould see him well; and a code of simple signals was arranged between\r\nhim and Monsieur J---- and the band, so that virtually he might conduct,\r\nhimself, from his box should any hesitation or hitch occur. This\r\narrangement was rehearsed the day before (a Sunday) and had turned out\r\nquite successfully, and la Svengali had sung in perfection in the empty\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\nWhen Monday evening arrived everything seemed to be going smoothly; the\r\nhouse was soon crammed to suffocation, all but the middle box on the\r\ngrand tier. It was not a promenade concert, and the pit was turned into\r\nguinea stalls (the promenade concerts were to be given a week later).\r\n\r\nRight in the middle of these stalls sat the Laird and Taffy and Little\r\nBillee.\r\n\r\nThe band came in by degrees and tuned their instruments.\r\n\r\nEyes were constantly being turned to the empty box, and people wondered\r\nwhat royal personages would appear.\r\n\r\nMonsieur J---- took his place amid immense applause, and bowed in his\r\ninimitable way, looking often at the empty box.\r\n\r\nThen he tapped and waved his b\xc3\xa2ton, and the band played its Hungarian\r\ndance music with immense success; when this was over there was a pause,\r\nand soon some signs of impatience from the gallery. Monsieur J---- had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nTaffy stood up, his back to the orchestra, looking round.\r\n\r\nSome one came into the empty box, and stood for a moment in front,\r\ngazing at the house. A tall man, deathly pale, with long black hair and\r\na beard.\r\n\r\nIt was Svengali.\r\n\r\nHe caught sight of Taffy and met his eyes, and Taffy said: "Good God!\r\nLook! look!"\r\n\r\nThen Little Billee and the Laird got up and looked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "HAST THOU FOUND ME, O MINE ENEMY?"]\r\n\r\nAnd Svengali for a moment glared at them. And the expression of his face\r\nwas so terrible with wonder, rage, and fear that they were quite\r\nappalled--and then he sat down, still glaring at Taffy, the whites of\r\nhis eyes showing at the top, and his teeth bared in a spasmodic grin of\r\nhate.\r\n\r\nThen thunders of applause filled the house, and turning round and\r\nseating themselves, Taffy and Little Billee and the Laird saw Trilby\r\nbeing led by J---- down the platform, between the players, to the front,\r\nher face smiling rather vacantly, her eyes anxiously intent on Svengali\r\nin his box.\r\n\r\nShe made her bows to right and left just as she had done in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe band struck up the opening bars of "Ben Bolt," with which she was\r\nannounced to make her d\xc3\xa9but.\r\n\r\nShe still stared--but she didn\'t sing--and they played the little\r\nsymphony three times.\r\n\r\nOne could hear Monsieur J---- in a hoarse, anxious whisper saying,\r\n\r\n"Mais chantez donc, madame--pour l\'amour de Dieu, commencez\r\ndonc--commencez!"\r\n\r\nShe turned round with an extraordinary expression of face, and said,\r\n\r\n"Chanter? pourquoi donc voulez-vous que je chante, moi? chanter quoi,\r\nalors?"\r\n\r\n"Mais \'Ben Bolt,\' parbleu--chantez!"\r\n\r\n"Ah--\'Ben Bolt!\' oui--je connais \xc3\xa7a!"\r\n\r\nThen the band began again.\r\n\r\nAnd she tried, but failed to begin herself. She turned round and said,\r\n\r\n"Comment diable voulez-vous que je chante avec tout ce train qu\'ils\r\nfont, ces diables de musiciens!"\r\n\r\n"Mais, mon Dieu, madame--qu\'est-ce que vous avez donc?" cried Monsieur\r\nJ----.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'OH, DON\'T YOU REMEMBER SWEET ALICE, BEN BOLT?\'"]\r\n\r\n"J\'ai que j\'aime mieux chanter sans toute cette satan\xc3\xa9e musique,\r\nparbleu! J\'aime mieux chanter toute seule!"\r\n\r\n"Sans musique, alors--mais chantez--chantez!"\r\n\r\nThe band was stopped--the house was in a state of indescribable wonder\r\nand suspense.\r\n\r\nShe looked all round, and down at herself, and fingered her dress. Then\r\nshe looked up to the chandelier with a tender, sentimental smile, and\r\nbegan:\r\n\r\n    "Oh, don\'t you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt?\r\n       Sweet Alice with hair so brown,\r\n     Who wept with delight when you gave her a smile--"\r\n\r\nShe had not got further than this when the whole house was in an\r\nuproar--shouts from the gallery--shouts of laughter, hoots, hisses,\r\ncatcalls, cock-crows.\r\n\r\nShe stopped and glared like a brave lioness, and called out:\r\n\r\n"Qu\'est-ce que vous avez donc, tous! tas de vieilles pommes cuites que\r\nvous \xc3\xaates! Est-ce qu\'on a peur de vous?" and then, suddenly:\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'re all English, aren\'t you?--what\'s all the row about?--what\r\nhave you brought me here for?--what have _I_ done, I should like to\r\nknow?"\r\n\r\nAnd in asking these questions the depth and splendor of her voice were\r\nso extraordinary--its tone so pathetically feminine, yet so full of hurt\r\nand indignant command, that the tumult was stilled for a moment.\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of some being from another world--some insulted\r\ndaughter of a race more puissant and nobler than ours; a voice that\r\nseemed as if it could never utter a false note.\r\n\r\nThen came a voice from the gods in answer:\r\n\r\n"Oh, ye\'re Henglish, har yer? Why don\'t yer sing as yer _hought_ to\r\nsing--yer\'ve got _voice_ enough, any\'ow! why don\'t yer sing in _tune_?"\r\n\r\n"Sing in _tune_!" cried Trilby. "I didn\'t want to sing at all--I only\r\nsang because I was asked to sing--that gentleman asked me--that French\r\ngentleman with the white waistcoat! I won\'t sing another note!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yer won\'t, won\'t yer! then let us \'ave our money back, or we\'ll\r\nknow what for!"\r\n\r\nAnd again the din broke out, and the uproar was frightful.\r\n\r\nMonsieur J---- screamed out across the theatre: "Svengali! Svengali!\r\nqu\'est-ce qu\'elle a donc, votre femme?... Elle est devenue folle!"\r\n\r\nIndeed she had tried to sing "Ben Bolt," but had sung it in her old\r\nway--as she used to sing it in the quartier latin--the most lamentably\r\ngrotesque performance ever heard out of a human throat!\r\n\r\n"Svengali! Svengali!" shrieked poor Monsieur J----, gesticulating\r\ntowards the box where Svengali was sitting, quite impassible, gazing at\r\nMonsieur J----, and smiling a ghastly, sardonic smile, a rictus of hate\r\nand triumphant revenge--as if he were saying,\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got the laugh of you _all_, this time!"\r\n\r\nTaffy, the Laird, Little Billee, the whole house, were now staring at\r\nSvengali, and his wife was forgotten.\r\n\r\nShe stood vacantly looking at everybody and everything--the chandelier,\r\nMonsieur J----, Svengali in his box, the people in the stalls, in the\r\ngallery--and smiling as if the noisy scene amused and excited her.\r\n\r\n"Svengali! Svengali! Svengali!"\r\n\r\nThe whole house took up the cry, derisively. Monsieur J---- led Madame\r\nSvengali away; she seemed quite passive. That terrible figure of\r\nSvengali still sat, immovable, watching his wife\'s retreat--still\r\nsmiling his ghastly smile. All eyes were now turned on him once more.\r\n\r\nMonsieur J---- was then seen to enter his box with a policeman and two\r\nor three other men, one of them in evening dress. He quickly drew the\r\ncurtains to; then, a minute or two after, he reappeared on the platform,\r\nbowing and scraping to the audience, as pale as death, and called for\r\nsilence, the gentleman in evening dress by his side; and this person\r\nexplained that a very dreadful thing had happened--that Monsieur\r\nSvengali had suddenly died in that box--of apoplexy or heart-disease;\r\nthat his wife had seen it from her place on the stage, and had\r\napparently gone out of her senses, which accounted for her extraordinary\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nHe added that the money would be returned at the doors, and begged the\r\naudience to disperse quietly.\r\n\r\nTaffy, with his two friends behind him, forced his way to a stage door\r\nhe knew. The Laird had no longer any doubts on the score of Trilby\'s\r\nidentity--_this_ Trilby, at all events!\r\n\r\nTaffy knocked and thumped till the door was opened, and gave his card to\r\nthe man who opened it, stating that he and his friends were old friends\r\nof Madame Svengali, and must see her at once.\r\n\r\nThe man tried to slam the door in his face, but Taffy pushed through,\r\nand shut it on the crowd outside, and insisted on being taken to\r\nMonsieur J---- immediately; and was so authoritative and big, and\r\nlooked such a swell, that the man was cowed, and led him.\r\n\r\nThey passed an open door, through which they had a glimpse of a\r\nprostrate form on a table--a man partially undressed, and some men\r\nbending over him, doctors probably.\r\n\r\nThat was the last they saw of Svengali.\r\n\r\nThen they were taken to another door, and Monsieur J---- came out, and\r\nTaffy explained who they were, and they were admitted.\r\n\r\nLa Svengali was there, sitting in an arm-chair by the fire, with several\r\nof the band standing round gesticulating, and talking German or Polish\r\nor Yiddish. Gecko, on his knees, was alternately chafing her hands and\r\nfeet. She seemed quite dazed.\r\n\r\nBut at the sight of Taffy she jumped up and rushed at him, saying: "Oh,\r\nTaffy dear--oh, Taffy! what\'s it all about? Where on earth am I? What an\r\nage since we met?"\r\n\r\nThen she caught sight of the Laird, and kissed him; and then she\r\nrecognized Little Billee.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a long while in great surprise, and then shook\r\nhands with him.\r\n\r\n"How pale you are! and so changed--you\'ve got a mustache! What\'s the\r\nmatter? Why are you all dressed in black, with white cravats, as if you\r\nwere going to a ball? Where\'s Svengali? I should like to go home!"\r\n\r\n"Where--what do you call--home, I mean--where is it?" asked Taffy.\r\n\r\n"C\'est \xc3\xa0 l\'h\xc3\xb4tel de Normandie, dans le Haymarket. On va vous y\r\nconduire, madame!" said Monsieur J----.\r\n\r\n"Oui--c\'est \xc3\xa7a!" said Trilby--"H\xc3\xb4tel de Normandie--mais Svengali--o\xc3\xb9\r\nest-ce qu\'il est?"\r\n\r\n"H\xc3\xa9las! madame--il est tr\xc3\xa8s malade!"\r\n\r\n"Malade? Qu\'est-ce qu\'il a? How funny you look, with your mustache,\r\nLittle Billee! dear, _dear_ Little Billee! so pale, so very pale! Are\r\nyou ill too? Oh, I hope not! How _glad_ I am to see you again--you can\'t\r\ntell! though I promised your mother I wouldn\'t--never, never! Where are\r\nwe now, dear Little Billee?"\r\n\r\nMonsieur J---- seemed to have lost his head. He was constantly running\r\nin and out of the room, distracted. The bandsmen began to talk and try\r\nto explain, in incomprehensible French, to Taffy. Gecko seemed to have\r\ndisappeared. It was a bewildering business--noises from outside, the\r\ntramp and bustle and shouts of the departing crowd, people running in\r\nand out and asking for Monsieur J----, policemen, firemen, and what not!\r\n\r\nThen Little Billee, who had been exerting the most heroic self-control,\r\nsuggested that Trilby should come to his house in Fitzroy Square, first\r\nof all, and be taken out of all this--and the idea struck Taffy as a\r\nhappy one--and it was proposed to Monsieur J----, who saw that our three\r\nfriends were old friends of Madame Svengali\'s, and people to be trusted;\r\nand he was only too glad to be relieved of her, and gave his consent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE LAST THEY SAW OF SVENGALI"]\r\n\r\nLittle Billee and Taffy drove to Fitzroy Square to prepare Little\r\nBillee\'s landlady, who was much put out at first at having such a novel\r\nand unexpected charge imposed on her. It was all explained to her that\r\nit must be so. That Madame Svengali, the greatest singer in Europe and\r\nan old friend of her tenant\'s, had suddenly gone out of her mind from\r\ngrief at the tragic death of her husband, and that for this night at\r\nleast the unhappy lady must sleep under that roof--indeed, in Little\r\nBillee\'s own bed, and that he would sleep at a hotel; and that a nurse\r\nwould be provided at once--it might be only for that one night; and that\r\nthe lady was as quiet as a lamb, and would probably recover her\r\nfaculties after a night\'s rest. A doctor was sent for from close by; and\r\nsoon Trilby appeared, with the Laird, and her appearance and her\r\nmagnificent sables impressed Mrs. Godwin, the landlady--brought her\r\nfiguratively on her knees. Then Taffy, the Laird, and Little Billee\r\ndeparted again and dispersed--to procure a nurse for the night, to find\r\nGecko, to fetch some of Trilby\'s belongings from the H\xc3\xb4tel de Normandie,\r\nand her maid.\r\n\r\nThe maid (the old German Jewess and Svengali\'s relative), distracted by\r\nthe news of her master\'s death, had gone to the theatre. Gecko was in\r\nthe hands of the police. Things had got to a terrible pass. But our\r\nthree friends did their best, and were up most of the night.\r\n\r\nSo much for la Svengali\'s d\xc3\xa9but in London.\r\n\r\nThe present scribe was not present on that memorable occasion, and has\r\nwritten this inadequate and most incomplete description partly from\r\nhearsay and private information, partly from the reports in the\r\ncontemporary newspapers.\r\n\r\nShould any surviving eye-witness of that lamentable fiasco read these\r\npages, and see any gross inaccuracy in this bald account of it, the P.\r\nS. will feel deeply obliged to the same for any corrections or\r\nadditions, and these will be duly acted upon and gratefully acknowledged\r\nin all subsequent editions; which will be numerous, no doubt, on account\r\nof the great interest still felt in "la Svengali," even by those who\r\nnever saw or heard her (and they are many), and also because the present\r\nscribe is better qualified (by his opportunities) for the compiling of\r\nthis brief biographical sketch than any person now living, with the\r\nexception, of course, of "Taffy" and "the Laird," to whose kindness,\r\neven more than to his own personal recollections, he owes whatever it\r\nmay contain of serious historical value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning they all three went to Fitzroy Square. Little Billee had\r\nslept at Taffy\'s rooms in Jermyn Street.\r\n\r\nTrilby seemed quite pathetically glad to see them again. She was dressed\r\nsimply and plainly--in black; her trunks had been sent from the hotel.\r\n\r\nThe hospital nurse was with her; the doctor had just left. He had said\r\nthat she was suffering from some great nervous shock--a pretty safe\r\ndiagnosis!\r\n\r\nHer wits had apparently not come back, and she seemed in no way to\r\nrealize her position.\r\n\r\n"Ah! what it is to see you again, all three! It makes one feel glad to\r\nbe alive! I\'ve thought of many things, but never of this--never! Three\r\nnice clean Englishmen, all speaking English--and _such_ dear old\r\nfriends! Ah! j\'aime tant \xc3\xa7a--c\'est le ciel! I wonder I\'ve got a word of\r\nEnglish left!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'THREE NICE CLEAN ENGLISHMEN\'"]\r\n\r\nHer voice was so soft and sweet and low that these ingenuous remarks\r\nsounded like a beautiful song. And she "made the soft eyes" at them all\r\nthree, one after another, in her old way; and the soft eyes quickly\r\nfilled with tears.\r\n\r\nShe seemed ill and weak and worn out, and insisted on keeping the\r\nLaird\'s hand in hers.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with Svengali? He must be dead!"\r\n\r\nThey all three looked at each other, perplexed.\r\n\r\n"Ah! he\'s dead! I can see it in your faces. He\'d got heart-disease. I\'m\r\nsorry! oh, very sorry indeed! He was always very kind, poor Svengali!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He\'s dead," said Taffy.\r\n\r\n"And Gecko--dear little Gecko--is he dead too? I saw him last night--he\r\nwarmed my hands and feet: where were we?"\r\n\r\n"No. Gecko\'s not dead. But he\'s had to be locked up for a little while.\r\nHe struck Svengali, you know. You saw it all."\r\n\r\n"I? No! I never saw it. But I _dreamt_ something like it! Gecko with a\r\nknife, and people holding him, and Svengali bleeding on the ground. That\r\nwas just before Svengali\'s illness. He\'d cut himself in the neck, you\r\nknow--with a rusty nail, he told me. I wonder how!... But it was wrong\r\nof Gecko to strike him. They were such friends. Why did he?"\r\n\r\n"Well--it was because Svengali struck you with his conductor\'s wand when\r\nyou were rehearsing. Struck you on the fingers and made you cry! don\'t\r\nyou remember?"\r\n\r\n"Struck _me_! _rehearsing?_--made me _cry_! what _are_ you talking\r\nabout, dear Taffy? Svengali never _struck_ me! he was kindness itself!\r\nalways! and what should _I_ rehearse?"\r\n\r\n"Well, the songs you were to sing at the theatre in the evening."\r\n\r\n"Sing at the theatre! _I_ never sang at any theatre--except last night,\r\nif that big place was a theatre! and they didn\'t seem to like it! I\'ll\r\ntake precious good care never to sing in a theatre again! How they\r\nhowled! and there was Svengali in the box opposite, laughing at me. Why\r\nwas I taken there? and why did that funny little Frenchman in the white\r\nwaistcoat ask me to sing? I know very well I can\'t sing well enough to\r\nsing in a place like that! What a fool I was! It all seems like a bad\r\ndream! What was it all about? _Was_ it a dream, I wonder!"\r\n\r\n"Well--but don\'t you remember singing at Paris, in the Salle des\r\nBashibazoucks--and at Vienna--St. Petersburg--lots of places?"\r\n\r\n"What nonsense, dear--you\'re thinking of some one else! _I_ never sang\r\nanywhere! I\'ve been to Vienna and St. Petersburg--but I never _sang_\r\nthere--good heavens!"\r\n\r\nThen there was a pause, and our three friends looked at her helplessly.\r\n\r\nLittle Billee said: "Tell me, Trilby--what made you cut me dead when I\r\nbowed to you in the Place de la Concorde, and you were riding with\r\nSvengali in that swell carriage?"\r\n\r\n"_I_ never rode in a swell carriage with Svengali! omnibuses were more\r\nin _our_ line! You\'re dreaming, dear Little Billee--you\'re taking me for\r\nsomebody else; and as for my cutting _you_--why, I\'d sooner cut\r\nmyself--into little pieces!"\r\n\r\n"_Where_ were you staying with Svengali in Paris?"\r\n\r\n"I really forget. _Were_ we in Paris? Oh yes, of course. H\xc3\xb4tel Bertrand,\r\nPlace Notre Dame des Victoires."\r\n\r\n"How long have you been going about with Svengali?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, months, years--I forget. I was very ill. He cured me."\r\n\r\n"Ill! What was the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I was mad with grief, and pain in my eyes, and wanted to kill\r\nmyself, when I lost my dear little Jeannot, at Vibraye. I fancied I\r\nhadn\'t been careful enough with him. I was crazed! Don\'t you remember\r\nwriting to me there, Taffy--through Ang\xc3\xa8le Boisse? Such a sweet letter\r\nyou wrote! I know it by heart! And you too, Sandy"; and she kissed him.\r\n"I wonder where they are, your letters?--I\'ve got nothing of my own in\r\nthe world--not even your dear letters--nor little Billee\'s--such lots of\r\nthem!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "P\xc5\x92NA PEDE CLAUDO"]\r\n\r\n"Well, Svengali used to write to me too--and then he got my address from\r\nAng\xc3\xa8le....\r\n\r\n"When Jeannot died, I felt I must kill myself or get away from\r\nVibraye--get away from the people there--so when he was buried I cut my\r\nhair short and got a workman\'s cap and blouse and trousers and walked\r\nall the way to Paris without saying anything to anybody. I didn\'t want\r\nanybody to know; I wanted to escape from Svengali, who wrote that he\r\nwas coming there to fetch me. I wanted to hide in Paris. When I got\r\nthere at last it was two o\'clock in the morning, and I was in dreadful\r\npain--and I\'d lost all my money--thirty francs--through a hole in my\r\ntrousers-pocket. Besides, I had a row with a carter in the Halle. He\r\nthought I was a man, and hit me and gave me a black eye, just because I\r\npatted his horse and fed it with a carrot I\'d been trying to eat myself.\r\nHe was tipsy, I think. Well, I looked over the bridge at the river--just\r\nby the Morgue--and wanted to jump in. But the Morgue sickened me, so I\r\nhadn\'t the pluck. Svengali used to be always talking about the Morgue,\r\nand my going there some day. He used to say he\'d come and look at me\r\nthere, and the idea made me so sick I couldn\'t. I got bewildered, and\r\nquite stupid.\r\n\r\n"Then I went to Ang\xc3\xa8le\'s, in the Rue des Clo\xc3\xaetres Ste. P\xc3\xa9tronille, and\r\nwaited about; but I hadn\'t the courage to ring, so I went to the Place\r\nSt. Anatole des Arts, and looked up at the old studio window, and\r\nthought how comfortable it was in there, with the big settee near the\r\nstove, and all that, and felt inclined to ring up Madame Vinard; and\r\nthen I remembered Little Billee was ill there, and his mother and sister\r\nwere with him. Ang\xc3\xa8le had written me, you know. Poor Little Billee!\r\nThere he was, very ill!\r\n\r\n"So I walked about the place, and up and down the Rue des Mauvais\r\nLadres. Then I went down the Rue de Seine to the river again, and again\r\nI hadn\'t the pluck to jump in. Besides, there was a sergent de ville who\r\nfollowed and watched me. And the fun of it was that I knew him quite\r\nwell, and he didn\'t know me a bit. It was C\xc3\xa9lestin Beaumollet, who got\r\nso tipsy on Christmas night. Don\'t you remember? The tall one, who was\r\npitted with the small-pox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE OLD STUDIO"]\r\n\r\n"Then I walked about till near daylight. Then I could stand it no\r\nlonger, and went to Svengali\'s, in the Rue Tire-Liard, but he\'d moved to\r\nthe Rue des Saints P\xc3\xa8res; and I went there and found him. I didn\'t want\r\nto a bit, but I couldn\'t help myself. It was fate, I suppose! He was\r\nvery kind, and cured me almost directly, and got me coffee and\r\nbread-and-butter--the best I ever tasted--and a warm bath from Bidet\r\nFr\xc3\xa8res, in the Rue Savonarole. It was heavenly! And I slept for two days\r\nand two nights! And then he told me how fond he was of me, and how he\r\nwould always cure me, and take care of me, and marry me, if I would go\r\naway with him. He said he would devote his whole life to me, and took a\r\nsmall room for me, next to his.\r\n\r\n"I stayed with him there a week, never going out or seeing any one,\r\nmostly asleep. I\'d caught a chill.\r\n\r\n"He played in two concerts and made a lot of money; and then we went\r\naway to Germany together; and no one was a bit the wiser."\r\n\r\n"And _did_ he marry you?"\r\n\r\n"Well--no. He couldn\'t, poor fellow! He\'d already got a wife living; and\r\nthree children, which he declared were not his. They live in Elberfeld\r\nin Prussia; she keeps a small sweet-stuff shop there. He behaved very\r\nbadly to them. But it was not through me! He\'d deserted them long\r\nbefore; but he used to send them plenty of money when he\'d got any; I\r\nmade him, for I was very sorry for her. He was always talking about her,\r\nand what she said and what she did; and imitating her saying her prayers\r\nand eating pickled cucumber with one hand and drinking schnapps with the\r\nother, so as not to lose any time; till he made me die of laughing. He\r\ncould be very funny, Svengali, though he _was_ German, poor dear! And\r\nthen Gecko joined us, and Marta."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s Marta?"\r\n\r\n"His aunt. She cooked for us, and all that. She\'s coming here presently;\r\nshe sent word from the hotel; she\'s very fond of him. Poor Marta! Poor\r\nGecko! What _will_ they ever do without Svengali?"\r\n\r\n"Then what did he do to live?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! he played at concerts, I suppose--and all that."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever hear him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Sometimes Marta took me; at the beginning, you know. He was always\r\nvery much applauded. He plays beautifully. Everybody said so."\r\n\r\n"Did he never try and teach you to sing?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma\xc3\xafe, a\xc3\xafe! not he! Why, he always laughed when I tried to sing; and\r\nso did Marta; and so did Gecko! It made them roar! I used to sing \'Ben\r\nBolt.\' They used to make me, just for fun--and go into fits. _I_ didn\'t\r\nmind a scrap. I\'d had no training, you know!"\r\n\r\n"Was there anybody else he knew--any other woman?"\r\n\r\n"Not that _I_ know of! He always made out he was so fond of me that he\r\ncouldn\'t even _look_ at another woman. Poor Svengali!" (Here her eyes\r\nfilled with tears again.) "He was always very kind! But I never could be\r\nfond of him in the way he wished--never! It made me sick even to think\r\nof! Once I used to hate him--in Paris--in the studio; don\'t you\r\nremember?\r\n\r\n"He hardly ever left me; and then Marta looked after me--for I\'ve always\r\nbeen weak and ill--and often so languid that I could hardly walk across\r\nthe room. It was that walk from Vibraye to Paris. I never got over it.\r\n\r\n"I used to try and do all I could--be a daughter to him, as I couldn\'t\r\nbe anything else--mend his things, and all that, and cook him little\r\nFrench dishes. I fancy he was very poor at one time; we were always\r\nmoving from place to place. But I always had the best of everything. He\r\ninsisted on that--even if he had to go without himself. It made him\r\nquite unhappy when I wouldn\'t eat, so I used to force myself.\r\n\r\n"Then, as soon as I felt uneasy about things, or had any pain, he would\r\nsay, \'Dors, ma mignonne!\' and I would sleep at once--for hours, I\r\nthink--and wake up, oh, so tired! and find him kneeling by me, always so\r\nanxious and kind--and Marta and Gecko! and sometimes we had the doctor,\r\nand I was ill in bed.\r\n\r\n"Gecko used to dine and breakfast with us--you\'ve no idea what an angel\r\nhe is, poor little Gecko! But what a dreadful thing to strike Svengali!\r\n_Why_ did he? Svengali taught him all he knows!"\r\n\r\n"And you knew no one else--no other woman?"\r\n\r\n"No one that I can remember--except Marta--not a soul!"\r\n\r\n"And that beautiful dress you had on last night?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t mine. It\'s on the bed up-stairs, and so\'s the fur cloak. They\r\nbelong to Marta. She\'s got lots of them, lovely things--silk, satin,\r\nvelvet--and lots of beautiful jewels. Marta deals in them, and makes\r\nlots of money.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve often tried them on; I\'m very easy to fit," she said, "being so\r\ntall and thin. And poor Svengali would kneel down and cry, and kiss my\r\nhands and feet, and tell me I was his goddess and empress, and all that,\r\nwhich I hate. And Marta used to cry, too. And then he would say,\r\n\r\n"\'Et maintenant dors, ma mignonne!\'\r\n\r\n"And when I woke up I was so tired that I went to sleep again on my own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'ET MAINTENANT DORS, MA MIGNONNE!\'"]\r\n\r\n"But he was very patient. Oh, dear me! I\'ve always been a poor,\r\nhelpless, useless log and burden to him!\r\n\r\n"Once I actually walked in my sleep--and woke up in the market-place at\r\nPrague--and found an immense crowd, and poor Svengali bleeding from the\r\nforehead, in a faint on the ground. He\'d been knocked down by a horse\r\nand cart, he told me. He\'d got his guitar with him. I suppose he and\r\nGecko had been playing somewhere, for Gecko had his fiddle. If Gecko\r\nhadn\'t been there, I don\'t know what we should have done. You never saw\r\nsuch queer people as they were--such crowds--you\'d think they\'d never\r\nseen an Englishwoman before. The noise they made, and the things they\r\ngave me ... some of them went down on their knees, and kissed my hands\r\nand the skirts of my gown.\r\n\r\n"He was ill in bed for a week after that, and I nursed him, and he was\r\nvery grateful. Poor Svengali! God knows _I_ felt grateful to _him_ for\r\nmany things! Tell me how he died! I hope he hadn\'t much pain."\r\n\r\nThey told her it was quite sudden, from heart-disease.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I knew he had that; he wasn\'t a healthy man; he used to smoke too\r\nmuch. Marta used always to be very anxious."\r\n\r\nJust then Marta came in.\r\n\r\nMarta was a fat, elderly Jewess of rather a grotesque and ignoble type.\r\nShe seemed overcome with grief--all but prostrate.\r\n\r\nTrilby hugged and kissed her, and took off her bonnet and shawl, and\r\nmade her sit down in a big arm-chair, and got her a footstool.\r\n\r\nShe couldn\'t speak a word of anything but Polish and a little German.\r\nTrilby had also picked up a little German, and with this and by means of\r\nsigns, and no doubt through a long intimacy with each other\'s ways, they\r\nunderstood each other very well. She seemed a very good old creature,\r\nand very fond of Trilby, but in mortal terror of the three Englishmen.\r\n\r\nLunch was brought up for the two women and the nurse, and our friends\r\nleft them, promising to come again that day.\r\n\r\nThey were utterly bewildered; and the Laird would have it that there was\r\nanother Madame Svengali somewhere, the real one, and that Trilby was a\r\nfraud--self-deceived and self-deceiving--quite unconsciously so, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nTruth looked out of her eyes, as it always had done--truth was in every\r\nline of her face.\r\n\r\nThe truth only--nothing but the truth could ever be told in that "voice\r\nof velvet," which rang as true when she spoke as that of any thrush or\r\nnightingale, however rebellious it might be now (and forever perhaps) to\r\nartificial melodic laws and limitations and restraints. The long\r\ntraining it had been subjected to had made it "a wonder, a world\'s\r\ndelight," and though she might never sing another note, her mere speech\r\nwould always be more golden than any silence, whatever she might say.\r\n\r\nExcept on the one particular point of her singing, she had seemed\r\nabsolutely sane--so, at least, thought Taffy, the Laird, and Little\r\nBillee. And each thought to himself, besides, that this last incarnation\r\nof Trilbyness was quite the sweetest, most touching, most endearing of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThey had not failed to note how rapidly she had aged, now that they had\r\nseen her without her rouge and pearl-powder; she looked thirty at\r\nleast--she was only twenty-three.\r\n\r\nHer hands were almost transparent in their waxen whiteness; delicate\r\nlittle frosty wrinkles had gathered round her eyes; there were gray\r\nstreaks in her hair; all strength and straightness and elasticity seemed\r\nto have gone out of her with the memory of her endless triumphs (if she\r\nreally _was_ la Svengali), and of her many wanderings from city to city\r\nall over Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was evident enough that the sudden stroke which had destroyed her\r\npower of singing had left her physically a wreck.\r\n\r\nBut she was one of those rarely gifted beings who cannot look or speak\r\nor even stir without waking up (and satisfying) some vague longing that\r\nlies dormant in the hearts of most of us, men and women alike; grace,\r\ncharm, magnetism--whatever the nameless seduction should be called that\r\nshe possessed to such an unusual degree--she had lost none of it when\r\nshe lost her high spirits, her buoyant health and energy, her wits!\r\n\r\nTuneless and insane, she was more of a siren than ever--a quite\r\nunconscious siren--without any guile, who appealed to the heart all the\r\nmore directly and irresistibly that she could no longer stir the\r\npassions.\r\n\r\nAll this was keenly felt by all three--each in his different way--by\r\nTaffy and Little Billee especially.\r\n\r\nAll her past life was forgiven--her sins of omission and commission! And\r\nwhatever might be her fate--recovery, madness, disease, or death--the\r\ncare of her till she died or recovered should be the principal business\r\nof their lives.\r\n\r\nBoth had loved her. All three, perhaps. One had been loved by her as\r\npassionately, as purely, as unselfishly as any man could wish to be\r\nloved, and in some extraordinary manner had recovered, after many years,\r\nat the mere sudden sight and sound of her, his lost share in our common\r\ninheritance--the power to love, and all its joy and sorrow; without\r\nwhich he had found life not worth living, though he had possessed every\r\nother gift and blessing in such abundance.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Circe, poor Circe, dear Circe, divine enchantress that you were!"\r\nhe said to himself, in his excitable way. "A mere look from your eyes, a\r\nmere note of your heavenly voice, has turned a poor, miserable, callous\r\nbrute back into a man again! and I will never forget it--never! And now\r\nthat a still worse trouble than mine has befallen you, you shall always\r\nbe first in my thoughts till the end!"\r\n\r\nAnd Taffy felt pretty much the same, though he was not by way of talking\r\nto himself so eloquent about things as Little Billee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs they lunched, they read the accounts of the previous evening\'s events\r\nin different papers, three or four of which (including the _Times_) had\r\nalready got leaders about the famous but unhappy singer who had been so\r\nsuddenly widowed and struck down in the midst of her glory. All these\r\naccounts were more or less correct. In one paper it was mentioned that\r\nMadame Svengali was under the roof and care of Mr. William Bagot, the\r\npainter, in Fitzroy Square.\r\n\r\nThe inquest on Svengali was to take place that afternoon, and also\r\nGecko\'s examination at the Bow Street Police Court, for his assault.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "TAFFY WAS ALLOWED TO SEE GECKO"]\r\n\r\nTaffy was allowed to see Gecko, who was remanded till the result of the\r\npost-mortem should be made public. But beyond inquiring most anxiously\r\nand minutely after Trilby, and betraying the most passionate concern for\r\nher, he would say nothing, and seemed indifferent as to his own fate.\r\n\r\nWhen they went to Fitzroy Square, late in the afternoon, they found\r\nthat many people, musical, literary, fashionable, and otherwise (and\r\nmany foreigners), had called to inquire after Madame Svengali, but no\r\none had been admitted to see her. Mrs. Godwin was much elated by the\r\nimportance of her new lodger.\r\n\r\nTrilby had been writing to Ang\xc3\xa8le Boisse, at her old address in the Rue\r\ndes Clo\xc3\xaetres Ste. P\xc3\xa9tronille, in the hope that this letter would find\r\nher still there. She was anxious to go back and be a _blanchisseuse de\r\nfin_ with her friend. It was a kind of nostalgia for Paris, the quartier\r\nlatin, her clean old trade.\r\n\r\nThis project our three heroes did not think it necessary to discuss with\r\nher just yet; she seemed quite unfit for work of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had seen her again, had been puzzled by her strange\r\nphysical weakness, and wished for a consultation with some special\r\nauthority; Little Billee, who was intimate with most of the great\r\nphysicians, wrote about her to Sir Oliver Calthorpe.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to find a deep happiness in being with her three old friends,\r\nand talked and listened with all her old eagerness and geniality, and\r\nmuch of her old gayety, in spite of her strange and sorrowful position.\r\nBut for this it was impossible to realize that her brain was affected in\r\nthe slightest degree, except when some reference was made to her\r\nsinging, and this seemed to annoy and irritate her, as though she were\r\nbeing made fun of. The whole of her marvellous musical career, and\r\neverything connected with it, had been clean wiped out of her\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nShe was very anxious to get into other quarters, that Little Billee\r\nshould suffer no inconvenience, and they promised to take rooms for her\r\nand Marta on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThey told her cautiously all about Svengali and Gecko; she was deeply\r\nconcerned, but betrayed no such poignant anguish as might have been\r\nexpected. The thought of Gecko troubled her most, and she showed much\r\nanxiety as to what might befall him.\r\n\r\nNext day she moved with Marta to some lodgings in Charlotte Street,\r\nwhere everything was made as comfortable for them as possible.\r\n\r\nSir Oliver saw her with Dr. Thorne (the doctor who was attending her)\r\nand Sir Jacob Wilcox.\r\n\r\nSir Oliver took the greatest interest in her case, both for her sake and\r\nhis friend Little Billee\'s. Also his own, for he was charmed with her.\r\nHe saw her three times in the course of the week, but could not say for\r\ncertain what was the matter with her, beyond taking the very gravest\r\nview of her condition. For all he could advise or prescribe, her\r\nweakness and physical prostration increased rapidly, through no cause he\r\ncould discover. Her insanity was not enough to account for it. She lost\r\nweight daily; she seemed to be wasting and fading away from sheer\r\ngeneral atrophy.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times he took her and Marta for a drive.\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions, as they went down Charlotte Street, she saw a\r\nshop with transparent French blinds in the window, and through them some\r\nFrench women, with neat white caps, ironing. It was a French\r\n_blanchisserie de fin_, and the sight of it interested and excited her\r\nso much that she must needs insist on being put down and on going into\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Je voudrais bien parler \xc3\xa0 la patronne, si \xc3\xa7a ne la d\xc3\xa9range pas," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FAIR BLANCHISSEUSE DE FIN]\r\n\r\nThe patronne, a genial Parisian, was much astonished to hear a great\r\nFrench lady, in costly garments, evidently a person of fashion and\r\nimportance, applying to her rather humbly for employment in the\r\nbusiness, and showing a thorough knowledge of the work (and of the\r\nParisian work-woman\'s colloquial dialect). Marta managed to catch the\r\npatronne\'s eye, and tapped her own forehead significantly, and Sir\r\nOliver nodded. So the good woman humored the great lady\'s fancy, and\r\npromised her abundance of employment whenever she should want it.\r\n\r\nEmployment! Poor Trilby was hardly strong enough to walk back to the\r\ncarriage; and this was her last outing.\r\n\r\nBut this little adventure had filled her with hope and good spirits--for\r\nshe had as yet received no answer from Ang\xc3\xa8le Boisse (who was in\r\nMarseilles), and had begun to realize how dreary the quartier latin\r\nwould be without Jeannot, without Ang\xc3\xa8le, without the trois Angliches in\r\nthe Place St. Anatole des Arts.\r\n\r\nShe was not allowed to see any of the strangers who came and made kind\r\ninquiries. This her doctors had strictly forbidden. Any reference to\r\nmusic or singing irritated her beyond measure. She would say to Marta,\r\nin bad German:\r\n\r\n"Tell them, Marta--what nonsense it is! They are taking me for\r\nanother--they are mad. They are trying to make a fool of me!"\r\n\r\nAnd Marta would betray great uneasiness--almost terror--when she was\r\nappealed to in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Eighth\r\n\r\n    "La vie est vaine:\r\n       Un peu d\'amour,\r\n     Un peu de haine....\r\n       Et puis--bonjour!\r\n\r\n    "La vie est br\xc3\xa8ve:\r\n       Un peu d\'espoir,\r\n     Un peu de r\xc3\xa8ve....\r\n       Et puis--bonsoir."\r\n\r\n\r\nSvengali had died from heart-disease. The cut he had received from Gecko\r\nhad not apparently (as far as the verdict of a coroner\'s inquest could\r\nbe trusted) had any effect in aggravating his malady or hastening his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut Gecko was sent for trial at the Old Bailey, and sentenced to hard\r\nlabor for six months (a sentence which, if I remember aright, gave rise\r\nto much comment at the time). Taffy saw him again, but with no better\r\nresult than before. He chose to preserve an obstinate silence on his\r\nrelations with the Svengalis and their relations with each other.\r\n\r\nWhen he was told how hopelessly ill and insane Madame Svengali was, he\r\nshed a few tears, and said: "Ah, pauvrette, pauvrette--ah! monsieur--je\r\nl\'aimais tant, je l\'aimais tant! il n\'y en a pas beaucoup comme elle,\r\nDieu de mis\xc3\xa8re! C\'est un ange du Paradis!"\r\n\r\nAnd not another word was to be got out of him.\r\n\r\nIt took some time to settle Svengali\'s affairs after his death. No will\r\nwas found. His old mother came over from Germany, and two of his\r\nsisters, but no wife. The comic wife and the three children, and the\r\nsweet-stuff shop in Elberfeld, had been humorous inventions of his\r\nown--a kind of Mrs. Harris!\r\n\r\nHe left three thousand pounds, every penny of which (and of far larger\r\nsums that he had spent) had been earned by "la Svengali," but nothing\r\ncame to Trilby of this; nothing but the clothes and jewels he had given\r\nher, and in this respect he had been lavish enough; and there were\r\ncountless costly gifts from emperors, kings, great people of all kinds.\r\nTrilby was under the impression that all these belonged to Marta. Marta\r\nbehaved admirably; she seemed bound hand and foot to Trilby by a kind of\r\nslavish adoration, as that of a plain old mother for a brilliant and\r\nbeautiful but dying child.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that, whatever her disease might be, Trilby had\r\nbut a very short time to live.\r\n\r\nShe was soon too weak even to be taken out in a Bath-chair, and remained\r\nall day in her large sitting-room with Marta; and there, to her great\r\nand only joy, she received her three old friends every afternoon, and\r\ngave them coffee, and made them smoke cigarettes of caporal as of old;\r\nand their hearts were daily harrowed as they watched her rapid decline.\r\n\r\nDay by day she grew more beautiful in their eyes, in spite of her\r\nincreasing pallor and emaciation--her skin was so pure and white and\r\ndelicate, and the bones of her face so admirable!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A THRONE IN BOHEMIA]\r\n\r\nHer eyes recovered all their old humorous brightness when les trois\r\nAngliches were with her, and the expression of her face was so wistful\r\nand tender for all her playfulness, so full of eager clinging to\r\nexistence and to them, that they felt the memory of it would haunt them\r\nforever, and be the sweetest and saddest memory of their lives.\r\n\r\nHer quick, though feeble gestures, full of reminiscences of the vigorous\r\nand lively girl they had known a few years back, sent waves of pity\r\nthrough them and pure brotherly love; and the incomparable tones and\r\nchanges and modulations of her voice, as she chatted and laughed,\r\nbewitched them almost as much as when she had sung the "Nussbaum" of\r\nSchumann in the Salle des Bashibazoucks.\r\n\r\nSometimes Lorrimer came, and Antony and the Greek. It was like a genial\r\nlittle court of bohemia. And Lorrimer, Antony, the Laird, and Little\r\nBillee made those beautiful chalk and pencil studies of her head which\r\nare now so well known--all so singularly like her, and so singularly\r\nunlike each other! _Trilby vue \xc3\xa0 travers quatre temp\xc3\xa9raments!_\r\n\r\nThese afternoons were probably the happiest poor Trilby had ever spent\r\nin her life--with these dear people round her, speaking the language she\r\nloved; talking of old times and jolly Paris days, she never thought of\r\nthe morrow.\r\n\r\nBut later--at night, in the small hours--she would wake up with a start\r\nfrom some dream full of tender and blissful recollection, and suddenly\r\nrealize her own mischance, and feel the icy hand of that which was to\r\ncome before many morrows were over; and taste the bitterness of death so\r\nkeenly that she longed to scream out loud, and get up, and walk up and\r\ndown, and wring her hands at the dreadful thought of parting forever!\r\n\r\nBut she lay motionless and mum as a poor little frightened mouse in a\r\ntrap, for fear of waking up the good old tired Marta, who was snoring at\r\nher side.\r\n\r\nAnd in an hour or two the bitterness would pass away, the creeps and the\r\nhorrors; and the stoical spirit of resignation would steal over her--the\r\nbalm, the blessed calm! and all her old bravery would come back.\r\n\r\nAnd then she would sink into sleep again, and dream more blissfully than\r\never, till the good Marta woke her with a motherly kiss and a fragrant\r\ncup of coffee; and she would find, feeble as she was, and doomed as she\r\nfelt herself to be, that joy cometh of a morning; and life was still\r\nsweet for her, with yet a whole day to look forward to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne day she was deeply moved at receiving a visit from Mrs. Bagot, who,\r\nat Little Billee\'s earnest desire, had come all the way from Devonshire\r\nto see her.\r\n\r\nAs the graceful little lady came in, pale and trembling all over, Trilby\r\nrose from her chair to receive her, and rather timidly put out her hand,\r\nand smiled in a frightened manner. Neither could speak for a second.\r\nMrs. Bagot stood stock-still by the door gazing (with all her heart in\r\nher eyes) at the so terribly altered Trilby--the girl she had once so\r\ndreaded.\r\n\r\nTrilby, who seemed also bereft of motion, and whose face and lips were\r\nashen, exclaimed, "I\'m afraid I haven\'t quite kept my promise to you,\r\nafter all! but things have turned out so differently! anyhow, you\r\nneedn\'t have any fear of me _now_."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'OH, MY POOR GIRL! MY POOR GIRL!\'"]\r\n\r\nAt the mere sound of that voice, Mrs. Bagot, who was as impulsive,\r\nemotional, and unregulated as her son, rushed forward, crying, "Oh, my\r\npoor girl, my poor girl!" and caught her in her arms, and kissed and\r\ncaressed her, and burst into a flood of tears, and forced her back into\r\nher chair, hugging her as if she were a long-lost child.\r\n\r\n"I love you now as much as I always admired you--pray believe it!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, how kind of you to say that!" said Trilby, her own eyes filling.\r\n"I\'m not at all the dangerous or designing person you thought. I knew\r\nquite well I wasn\'t a proper person to marry your son all the time; and\r\ntold him so again and again. It was very stupid of me to say yes at\r\nlast. I was miserable directly after, I assure you. Somehow I couldn\'t\r\nhelp myself--I was driven."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t talk of that! don\'t talk of that! You\'ve never been to blame\r\nin any way--I\'ve long known it--I\'ve been full of remorse! You\'ve been\r\nin my thoughts always, night and day. Forgive a poor jealous mother. As\r\nif _any_ man could help loving you--or any woman either. Forgive me!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Bagot--forgive _you_! What a funny idea! But, anyhow, you\'ve\r\nforgiven _me_, and that\'s all I care for now. I was very fond of your\r\nson--as fond as could be. I am now, but in quite a different sort of\r\nway, you know--the sort of way _you_ must be, I fancy! There was never\r\nanother like him that I ever met--anywhere! You _must_ be so proud of\r\nhim; who wouldn\'t? _Nobody\'s_ good enough for him. I would have been\r\nonly too glad to be his servant, his humble servant! I used to tell him\r\nso--but he wouldn\'t hear of it--he was much too kind! He always thought\r\nof others before himself. And, oh! how rich and famous he\'s become! I\'ve\r\nheard all about it, and it did me good. It does me more good to think of\r\nthan anything else; far more than if I were to be ever so rich and\r\nfamous myself, I can tell you!"\r\n\r\nThis from la Svengali, whose overpowering fame, so utterly forgotten by\r\nherself, was still ringing all over Europe; whose lamentable illness\r\nand approaching death were being mourned and discussed and commented\r\nupon in every capital of the civilized world, as one distressing\r\nbulletin appeared after another. She might have been a royal personage!\r\n\r\nMrs. Bagot knew, of course, the strange form her insanity had taken, and\r\nmade no allusion to the flood of thoughts that rushed through her own\r\nbrain as she listened to this towering goddess of song, this poor mad\r\nqueen of the nightingales, humbly gloating over her son\'s success....\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Bagot had just come from Little Billee\'s, in Fitzroy Square,\r\nclose by. There she had seen Taffy, in a corner of Little Billee\'s\r\nstudio, laboriously answering endless letters and telegrams from all\r\nparts of Europe--for the good Taffy had constituted himself Trilby\'s\r\nsecretary and _homme d\'affaires_--unknown to her, of course. And this\r\nwas no sinecure (though he liked it): putting aside the numerous people\r\nhe had to see and be interviewed by, there were kind inquiries and\r\nmessages of condolence and sympathy from nearly all the crowned heads of\r\nEurope, through their chamberlains; applications for help from\r\nunsuccessful musical strugglers all over the world to the pre-eminently\r\nsuccessful one; beautiful letters from great and famous people, musical\r\nor otherwise; disinterested offers of service; interested proposals for\r\nengagements when the present trouble should be over; beggings for an\r\ninterview from famous impresarios, to obtain which no distance would be\r\nthought too great, etc., etc., etc. It was endless, in English, French,\r\nGerman, Italian--in languages quite incomprehensible (many letters had\r\nto remain unanswered)--Taffy took an almost malicious pleasure in\r\nexplaining all this to Mrs. Bagot.\r\n\r\nThen there was a constant rolling of carriages up to the door, and a\r\nthundering of Little Billee\'s knocker: Lord and Lady Palmerston wish to\r\nknow--the Lord Chief Justice wishes to know--the Dean of Westminster\r\nwishes to know--the Marchioness of Westminster wishes to know--everybody\r\nwishes to know if there is any better news of Madame Svengali!\r\n\r\nThese were small things, truly; but Mrs. Bagot was a small person from a\r\nsmall village in Devonshire, and one whose heart and eye had hitherto\r\nbeen filled by no larger image than that of Little Billee; and Little\r\nBillee\'s fame, as she now discovered for the first time, did not quite\r\nfill the entire universe.\r\n\r\nAnd she mustn\'t be too much blamed if all these obvious signs of a\r\nworld-wide colossal celebrity impressed and even awed her a little.\r\n\r\nMadame Svengali! Why, this was the beautiful girl whom she remembered so\r\nwell, whom she had so grandly discarded with a word, and who had\r\naccepted her cong\xc3\xa9 so meekly in a minute; whom, indeed, she had been\r\ncursing in her heart for years, because--because what?\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Bagot felt herself turn hot and red all over, and humbled\r\nherself to the very dust, and almost forgot that she had been in the\r\nright, after all, and that "la grande Trilby" was certainly no fit match\r\nfor her son!\r\n\r\nSo she went quite humbly to see Trilby, and found a poor, pathetic, mad\r\ncreature still more humble than herself, who still apologized for--for\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\nA poor, pathetic, mad creature who had clean forgotten that she was the\r\ngreatest singer in all the world--one of the greatest artists that had\r\never lived; but who remembered with shame and contrition that she had\r\nonce taken the liberty of yielding (after endless pressure and repeated\r\ndisinterested refusals of her own, and out of sheer irresistible\r\naffection) to the passionate pleadings of a little obscure art student,\r\na mere boy--no better off than herself--just as penniless and\r\ninsignificant a nobody; but--the son of Mrs. Bagot.\r\n\r\nAll due sense of proportion died out of the poor lady as she remembered\r\nand realized all this!\r\n\r\nAnd then Trilby\'s pathetic beauty, so touching, so winning, in its rapid\r\ndecay; the nameless charm of look and voice and manner that was her\r\nspecial apanage, and which her malady and singular madness had only\r\nincreased; her childlike simplicity, her transparent forgetfulness of\r\nself--all these so fascinated and entranced Mrs. Bagot, whose quick\r\nsusceptibility to such impressions was just as keen as her son\'s, that\r\nshe very soon found herself all but worshipping this fast-fading\r\nlily--for so she called her in her own mind--quite forgetting (or\r\naffecting to forget) on what very questionable soil the lily had been\r\nreared, and through what strange vicissitudes of evil and corruption it\r\nhad managed to grow so tall and white and fragrant!\r\n\r\nOh, strange compelling power of weakness and grace and prettiness\r\ncombined, and sweet, sincere unconscious natural manners! not to speak\r\nof world-wide fame!\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Bagot was just a shrewd little conventional British country\r\nmatron of the good upper middle-class type, bristling all over with\r\nprovincial proprieties and respectabilities, a philistine of the\r\nphilistines, in spite of her artistic instincts; one who for years had\r\n(rather unjustly) thought of Trilby as a wanton and perilous siren, an\r\nunchaste and unprincipled and most dangerous daughter of Heth, and the\r\nspecial enemy of her house.\r\n\r\nAnd here she was--like all the rest of us monads and nomads and\r\nbohemians--just sitting at Trilby\'s feet.... "A washer-woman! a figure\r\nmodel! and Heaven knows what besides!" and she had never even heard her\r\nsing!\r\n\r\nIt was truly comical to see and hear!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Bagot did not go back to Devonshire. She remained in Fitzroy\r\nSquare, at her son\'s, and spent most of her time with Trilby, doing and\r\ndevising all kinds of things to distract and amuse her, and lead her\r\nthoughts gently to heaven, and soften for her the coming end of all.\r\n\r\nTrilby had a way of saying, and especially of looking, "Thank you" that\r\nmade one wish to do as many things for her as one could, if only to make\r\nher say and look it again.\r\n\r\nAnd she had retained much of her old, quaint, and amusing manner of\r\ntelling things, and had much to tell still left of her wandering life,\r\nalthough there were so many strange lapses in her powers of\r\nmemory--gaps--which, if they could only have been filled up, would have\r\nbeen full of such surpassing interest!\r\n\r\nThen she was never tired of talking and hearing of Little Billee; and\r\nthat was a subject of which Mrs. Bagot could never tire either!\r\n\r\nThen there were the recollections of her childhood. One day, in a\r\ndrawer, Mrs. Bagot came upon a faded daguerreotype of a woman in a Tam\r\no\' Shanter, with a face so sweet and beautiful and saint-like that it\r\nalmost took her breath away. It was Trilby\'s mother.\r\n\r\n"Who and what was your mother, Trilby?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, poor mamma!" said Trilby, and she looked at the portrait a long\r\ntime. "Ah, she was ever so much prettier than that! Mamma was once a\r\ndemoiselle de comptoir--that\'s a bar-maid, you know--at the Montagnards\r\n\xc3\x89cossais, in the Rue du Paradis Poissonni\xc3\xa8re--a place where men used to\r\ndrink and smoke without sitting down. That was unfortunate, wasn\'t it?\r\n\r\n"Papa loved her with all his heart, although, of course, she wasn\'t his\r\nequal. They were married at the Embassy, in the Rue du Faubourg St.\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'AH, POOR MAMMA! SHE WAS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN\r\nTHAT!\'"]\r\n\r\n"_Her_ parents weren\'t married at all. Her mother was the daughter of a\r\nboatman on Loch Ness, near a place called Drumnadrockit; but her father\r\nwas the Honorable Colonel Desmond. He was related to all sorts of great\r\npeople in England and Ireland. He behaved very badly to my grandmother\r\nand to poor mamma--his own daughter! deserted them both! Not very\r\n_honorable_ of him, _was_ it? And that\'s all I know about him."\r\n\r\nAnd then she went on to tell of the home in Paris that might have been\r\nso happy but for her father\'s passion for drink; of her parents\' deaths,\r\nand little Jeannot, and so forth. And Mrs. Bagot was much moved and\r\ninterested by these na\xc3\xafve revelations, which accounted in a measure for\r\nso much that seemed unaccountable in this extraordinary woman; who thus\r\nturned out to be a kind of cousin (though on the wrong side of the\r\nblanket) to no less a person than the famous Duchess of Towers.\r\n\r\nWith what joy would that ever kind and gracious lady have taken poor\r\nTrilby to her bosom had she only known! She had once been all the way\r\nfrom Paris to Vienna merely to hear her sing. But, unfortunately, the\r\nSvengalis had just left for St. Petersburg, and she had her long journey\r\nfor nothing!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Bagot brought her many good books, and read them to her--Dr.\r\nCummings on the approaching end of the world, and other works of a like\r\ncomforting tendency for those who are just about to leave it; the\r\n_Pilgrim\'s Progress_, sweet little tracts, and what not.\r\n\r\nTrilby was so grateful that she listened with much patient attention.\r\nOnly now and then a faint gleam of amusement would steal over her face,\r\nand her lips would almost form themselves to ejaculate, "Oh, ma\xc3\xafe, a\xc3\xafe!"\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Bagot, as a reward for such winning docility, would read her\r\n_David Copperfield_, and that was heavenly indeed!\r\n\r\nBut the best of all was for Trilby to look over John Leech\'s _Pictures\r\nof Life and Character_, just out. She had never seen any drawings of\r\nLeech before, except now and then in an occasional _Punch_ that turned\r\nup in the studio in Paris. And they never palled upon her, and taught\r\nher more of the aspect of English life (the life she loved) than any\r\nbook she had ever read. She laughed and laughed; and it was almost as\r\nsweet to listen to as if she were vocalizing the quick part in Chopin\'s\r\nImpromptu.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne day she said, her lips trembling: "I can\'t make out why you\'re so\r\nwonderfully kind to me, Mrs. Bagot. I hope you have not forgotten who\r\nand what I am, and what my story is. I hope you haven\'t forgotten that\r\nI\'m not a respectable woman?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear child--don\'t ask me.... I only know that you are you!...\r\nand I am I! and that is enough for me ... you\'re my poor, gentle,\r\npatient, suffering daughter, whatever else you are--more sinned against\r\nthan sinning, I feel sure! But there.... I\'ve misjudged you so, and been\r\nso unjust, that I would give worlds to make you some amends ... besides,\r\nI should be just as fond of you if you\'d committed a murder, I really\r\nbelieve--you\'re so strange! you\'re irresistible! Did you ever, in all\r\nyour life, meet anybody that _wasn\'t_ fond of you?"\r\n\r\nTrilby\'s eyes moistened with tender pleasure at such a pretty\r\ncompliment. Then, after a few minutes\' thought, she said, with engaging\r\ncandor and quite simply: "No, I can\'t say I ever did, that I can think\r\nof just now. But I\'ve forgotten such lots of people!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne day Mrs. Bagot told Trilby that her brother-in-law, Mr. Thomas\r\nBagot, would much like to come and talk to her.\r\n\r\n"Was that the gentleman who came with you to the studio in Paris?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Why, he\'s a clergyman, isn\'t he? What does he want to come and talk to\r\n_me_ about?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! my dear child ..." said Mrs. Bagot, her eyes filling.\r\n\r\nTrilby was thoughtful for a while, and then said: "I\'m going to die, I\r\nsuppose. Oh yes! oh yes! There\'s no mistake about that!"\r\n\r\n"Dear Trilby, we are all in the hands of an Almighty Merciful God!" And\r\nthe tears rolled down Mrs. Bagot\'s cheeks.\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause, during which she gazed out of the window, Trilby\r\nsaid, in an abstracted kind of way, as though she were talking to\r\nherself: "Apr\xc3\xa8s tout, c\'est pas d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 si raide, de claquer! J\'en ai tant\r\nvus, qui ont pass\xc3\xa9 par la! Au bout du foss\xc3\xa9 la culbute, ma foi!"\r\n\r\n"What are you saying to yourself in French, Trilby? Your French is so\r\ndifficult to understand!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I beg your pardon! I was thinking it\'s not so difficult to die,\r\nafter all! I\'ve seen such lots of people do it. I\'ve nursed them, you\r\nknow--papa and mamma and Jeannot, and Ang\xc3\xa8le Boisse\'s mother-in-law, and\r\na poor casseur de pierres, Colin Maigret, who lived in the Impasse des\r\nTaupes St. Germain. He\'d been run over by an omnibus in the Rue\r\nVaugirard, and had to have both his legs cut off just above the knee.\r\nThey none of them seemed to mind dying a bit. They weren\'t a bit afraid!\r\n_I\'m_ not!\r\n\r\n"Poor people don\'t think much of death. Rich people shouldn\'t either.\r\nThey should be taught when they\'re quite young to laugh at it and\r\ndespise it, like the Chinese. The Chinese die of laughing just as their\r\nheads are being cut off, and cheat the executioner! It\'s all in the\r\nday\'s work, and we\'re all in the same boat--so who\'s afraid!"\r\n\r\n"Dying is not all, my poor child! Are you prepared to meet your Maker\r\nface to face? Have you ever thought about God, and the possible wrath to\r\ncome if you should die unrepentant?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I sha\'n\'t! I\'ve been repenting all my life! Besides, there\'ll\r\nbe no wrath for any of us--not even the worst! _Il y aura amnistie\r\ng\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale!_ Papa told me so, and he\'d been a clergyman, like Mr. Thomas\r\nBagot. I often think about God. I\'m very fond of Him. One _must_ have\r\nsomething perfect to look up to and be fond of--even if it\'s only an\r\nidea!\r\n\r\n"Though some people don\'t even believe He exists! Le p\xc3\xa8re Martin\r\ndidn\'t--but, of course, _he_ was only a chiffonnier, and doesn\'t count.\r\n\r\n"One day, though, Durien, the sculptor, who\'s very clever, and a very\r\ngood fellow indeed, said:\r\n\r\n"\'Vois-tu, Trilby--I\'m very much afraid He doesn\'t really exist, le bon\r\nDieu! most unfortunately for _me_, for I _adore_ Him! I never do a piece\r\nof work without thinking how nice it would be if I could only please\r\n_Him_ with it!\'\r\n\r\n"And I\'ve often thought, myself, how heavenly it must be to be able to\r\npaint, or sculpt, or make music, or write beautiful poetry, for that\r\nvery reason!\r\n\r\n"Why, once on a very hot afternoon we were sitting, a lot of us, in the\r\ncourt-yard outside la m\xc3\xa8re Martin\'s shop, drinking coffee with an old\r\nInvalide called Bastide Lendormi, one of the Vieille Garde, who\'d only\r\ngot one leg and one arm and one eye, and everybody was very fond of him.\r\nWell, a model called Mimi la Salope came out of the Mont-de-pi\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9\r\nopposite, and P\xc3\xa8re Martin called out to her to come and sit down, and\r\ngave her a cup of coffee, and asked her to sing.\r\n\r\n"She sang a song of B\xc3\xa9ranger\'s, about Napoleon the Great, in which it\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    "\'Parlez-nous de lui, grandm\xc3\xa8re!\r\n      Grandm\xc3\xa8re, parlez-nous de lui!\'\r\n\r\nI suppose she sang it very well, for it made old Bastide Lendormi cry;\r\nand when P\xc3\xa8re Martin _blagu\xc3\xa8\'d_ him about it, he said,\r\n\r\n"\'C\'est \xc3\xa9gal, voyez-vous! to sing like that is _to pray_!\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'TO SING LIKE THAT IS _TO PRAY_!\'"]\r\n\r\n"And then I thought how lovely it would be if _I_ could only sing like\r\nMimi la Salope, and I\'ve thought so ever since--just to _pray_!"\r\n\r\n"_What!_ Trilby? if _you_ could only sing like--Oh, but never mind, I\r\nforgot! Tell me, Trilby--do you ever pray to Him, as other people pray?"\r\n\r\n"Pray to Him? Well, no--not often--not in words and on my knees and with\r\nmy hands together, you know! _Thinking\'s_ praying, very often--don\'t you\r\nthink so? And so\'s being sorry and ashamed when one\'s done a mean thing,\r\nand glad when one\'s resisted a temptation, and grateful when it\'s a fine\r\nday and one\'s enjoying one\'s self without hurting any one else! What is\r\nit but praying when you try and bear up after losing all you cared to\r\nlive for? And very good praying too! There can be prayers without words\r\njust as well as songs, I suppose; and Svengali used to say that songs\r\nwithout words are the best!\r\n\r\n"And then it seems mean to be always asking for things. Besides, you\r\ndon\'t get them any the faster that way, and that shows!\r\n\r\n"La m\xc3\xa8re Martin used to be always praying. And P\xc3\xa8re Martin used always\r\nto laugh at her; yet he always seemed to get the things _he_ wanted\r\noftenest!\r\n\r\n"_I_ prayed once, very hard indeed! I prayed for Jeannot not to die!"\r\n\r\n"Well--but how do you _repent_, Trilby, if you do not humble yourself,\r\nand pray for forgiveness on your knees?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, well--I don\'t exactly know! Look here, Mrs. Bagot, I\'ll tell you\r\nthe lowest and meanest thing I ever did...."\r\n\r\n(Mrs. Bagot felt a little nervous.)\r\n\r\n"I\'d promised to take Jeannot on Palm-Sunday to St. Philippe du Roule,\r\nto hear l\'abb\xc3\xa9 Bergamot. But Durien (that\'s the sculptor, you know)\r\nasked me to go with him to St. Germain, where there was a fair, or\r\nsomething; and with Mathieu, who was a student in law; and a certain\r\nVictorine Letellier, who--who was Mathieu\'s mistress, in fact. And I\r\nwent on Sunday morning to tell Jeannot that I couldn\'t take him.\r\n\r\n"He cried so dreadfully that I thought I\'d give up the others and take\r\nhim to St. Philippe, as I\'d promised. But then Durien and Mathieu and\r\nVictorine drove up and waited outside, and so I didn\'t take him, and\r\nwent with them, and I didn\'t enjoy anything all day, and was miserable.\r\n\r\n"They were in an open carriage with two horses; it was Mathieu\'s treat;\r\nand Jeannot might have ridden on the box by the coachman, without being\r\nin anybody\'s way. But I was afraid they didn\'t want him, as they didn\'t\r\nsay anything, and so I didn\'t dare ask--and Jeannot saw us drive away,\r\nand I _couldn\'t_ look back! And the worst of it is that when we were\r\nhalf-way to St. Germain, Durien said, \'What a pity you didn\'t bring\r\nJeannot!\' and they were all sorry I hadn\'t.\r\n\r\n"It was six or seven years ago, and I really believe I\'ve thought of it\r\nalmost every day, and sometimes in the middle of the night!\r\n\r\n"Ah! and when Jeannot was dying! and when he was dead--the remembrance\r\nof that Palm-Sunday!\r\n\r\n"And if _that\'s_ not repenting, I don\'t know what is!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Trilby, what nonsense! _that\'s_ nothing; good heavens!--putting off\r\na small child! I\'m thinking of far worse things--when you were in the\r\nquartier latin, you know--sitting to painters and sculptors.... Surely,\r\nso attractive as you are...."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes.... I know what you mean--it was horrid, and I was frightfully\r\nashamed of myself; and it wasn\'t amusing a bit; _nothing_ was, till I\r\nmet your son and Taffy and dear Sandy McAlister! But then it wasn\'t\r\ndeceiving or disappointing anybody, or hurting their feelings--it was\r\nonly hurting myself!\r\n\r\n"Besides, all that sort of thing, in women, is punished severely enough\r\ndown here, God knows! unless one\'s a Russian empress like Catherine the\r\nGreat, or a grande dame like lots of them, or a great genius like Madame\r\nRachel or George Sand!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT PALM-SUNDAY!\'"]\r\n\r\n"Why, if it hadn\'t been for that, and sitting for the figure, I should\r\nhave felt myself good enough to marry your son, _although_ I was only a\r\nblanchisseuse de fin--you\'ve said so yourself!\r\n\r\n"And I should have made him a good wife--of that I feel sure. He wanted\r\nto live all his life at Barbizon, and paint, you know; and didn\'t care\r\nfor society in the least. Anyhow, I should have been equal to such a\r\nlife as that! Lots of their wives are blanchisseuses over there, or\r\npeople of that sort; and they get on very well indeed, and nobody\r\ntroubles about it!\r\n\r\n"So I think I\'ve been pretty well punished--richly as I\'ve deserved to!"\r\n\r\n"Trilby, have you ever been confirmed?"\r\n\r\n"I forget. I fancy not!"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, oh dear! And do you know about our blessed Saviour, and the\r\nAtonement and the Incarnation and the Resurrection...."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes--I _used_ to, at least. I used to have to learn the Catechism on\r\nSundays--mamma made me. Whatever her faults and mistakes were, poor\r\nmamma was always very particular about _that_! It all seemed very\r\ncomplicated. But papa told me not to bother too much about it, but to be\r\ngood. He said that God would make it all right for us somehow, in the\r\nend--all of us. And that seems sensible, _doesn\'t_ it?\r\n\r\n"He told me to be good, and not to mind what priests and clergymen tell\r\nus. He\'d been a clergyman himself, and knew all about it, he said.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been very good--there\'s not much doubt about that, I\'m\r\nafraid. But God knows I\'ve repented often enough and sore enough; I do\r\nnow! But I\'m rather glad to die, I think; and not a bit afraid--not a\r\nscrap! I believe in poor papa, though he _was_ so unfortunate! He was\r\nthe cleverest man I ever knew, and the best--except Taffy and the Laird\r\nand your dear son!\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be no hell for any of us--he told me so--except what we make\r\nfor ourselves and each other down here; and that\'s bad enough for\r\nanything. He told me that _he_ was responsible for me--he often said\r\nso--and that mamma was too, and his parents for _him_, and his\r\ngrandfathers and grandmothers for _them_, and so on up to Noah and ever\r\nso far beyond, and God for us all!\r\n\r\n"He told me always to think of other people before myself, as Taffy\r\ndoes, and your son; and never to tell lies or be afraid, and keep away\r\nfrom drink, and I should be all right. But I\'ve sometimes been all\r\nwrong, all the same; and it wasn\'t papa\'s fault, but poor mamma\'s and\r\nmine; and I\'ve known it, and been miserable at the time, and after! and\r\nI\'m sure to be forgiven--perfectly certain--and so will everybody else,\r\neven the wickedest that ever lived! Why, just give them sense enough in\r\nthe next world to understand all their wickedness in this, and that\'ll\r\npunish them enough for anything, I think! That\'s simple enough, _isn\'t_\r\nit? Besides, there may be _no_ next world--that\'s on the cards too, you\r\nknow!--and that will be simpler still!\r\n\r\n"Not all the clergymen in all the world, not even the Pope of Rome, will\r\never make me doubt papa, or believe in any punishment after what we\'ve\r\nall got to go through here! _Ce serait trop b\xc3\xaate!_\r\n\r\n"So that if you don\'t want me to very much, and he won\'t think it\r\nunkind, I\'d rather not talk to Mr. Thomas Bagot about it. I\'d rather\r\ntalk to Taffy if I must. He\'s very clever, Taffy, though he doesn\'t\r\noften say such clever things as your son does, or paint nearly so well;\r\nand I\'m sure he\'ll think papa was right."\r\n\r\nAnd as a matter of fact the good Taffy, in his opinion on this solemn\r\nsubject, was found to be at one with the late Reverend Patrick Michael\r\nO\'Ferrall--and so was the Laird--and so (to his mother\'s shocked and\r\npained surprise) was Little Billee.\r\n\r\nAnd so were Sir Oliver Calthorpe and Sir Jacob Wilcox and Doctor Thorne\r\nand Antony and Lorrimer and the Greek!\r\n\r\nAnd so--in after-years, when grief had well pierced and torn and riddled\r\nher through and through, and time and age had healed the wounds, and\r\nnothing remained but the consciousness of great inward scars of\r\nrecollection to remind her how deep and jagged and wide the wounds had\r\nonce been--did Mrs. Bagot herself!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLate on one memorable Saturday afternoon, just as it was getting dusk in\r\nCharlotte Street, Trilby, in her pretty blue dressing-gown, lay on the\r\nsofa by the fire--her head well propped, her knees drawn up--looking\r\nvery placid and content.\r\n\r\nShe had spent the early part of the day dictating her will to the\r\nconscientious Taffy.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple document, although she was not without many valuable\r\ntrinkets to leave: quite a fortune! Souvenirs from many men and women\r\nshe had charmed by her singing, from royalties downward.\r\n\r\nShe had been looking them over with the faithful Marta, to whom she had\r\nalways thought they belonged. It was explained to her that they were\r\ngifts of Svengali\'s; since she did not remember when and where and by\r\nwhom they were presented to her, except a few that Svengali had given\r\nher himself, with many passionate expressions of his love, which seems\r\nto have been deep and constant and sincere; none the less so, perhaps,\r\nthat she could never return it!\r\n\r\nShe had left the bulk of these to the faithful Marta.\r\n\r\nBut to each of the trois Angliches she had bequeathed a beautiful ring,\r\nwhich was to be worn by their brides if they ever married, and the\r\nbrides didn\'t object.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Bagot she left a pearl necklace; to Miss Bagot her gold coronet\r\nof stars; and pretty (and most costly) gifts to each of the three\r\ndoctors who had attended her and been so assiduous in their care; and\r\nwho, as she was told, would make no charge for attending on Madame\r\nSvengali. And studs and scarf-pins to Antony, Lorrimer, the Greek,\r\nDodor, and Zouzou; and to Carnegie a little German-silver vinaigrette\r\nwhich had once belonged to Lord Witlow; and pretty souvenirs to the\r\nVinards, Ang\xc3\xa8le Boisse, Durien, and others.\r\n\r\nAnd she left a magnificent gold watch and chain to Gecko, with a most\r\naffectionate letter and a hundred pounds--which was all she had in money\r\nof her own.\r\n\r\nShe had taken great interest in discussing with Taffy the particular\r\nkind of trinket which would best suit the idiosyncrasy of each\r\nparticular legatee, and derived great comfort from the business-like and\r\nsympathetic conscientiousness with which the good Taffy entered upon all\r\nthese minuti\xc3\xa6--he was so solemn and serious about it, and took such\r\npains. She little guessed how his dumb but deeply feeling heart was\r\nharrowed!\r\n\r\nThis document had been duly signed and witnessed and intrusted to his\r\ncare; and Trilby lay tranquil and happy, and with a sense that nothing\r\nremained for her but to enjoy the fleeting hour, and make the most of\r\neach precious moment as it went by.\r\n\r\nShe was quite without pain of either mind or body, and surrounded by the\r\npeople she adored--Taffy, the Laird, and Little Billee, and Mrs. Bagot,\r\nand Marta, who sat knitting in a corner with her black mittens on, and\r\nher brass spectacles.\r\n\r\nShe listened to the chat and joined in it, laughing as usual; "love in\r\nher eyes sat playing," as she looked from one to another, for she loved\r\nthem all beyond expression. "Love on her lips was straying, and warbling\r\nin her breath," whenever she spoke; and her weakened voice was still\r\nlarger, fuller, softer than any other voice in the room, in the\r\nworld--of another kind, from another sphere.\r\n\r\nA cart drove up, there was a ring at the door, and presently a wooden\r\npacking-case was brought into the room.\r\n\r\nAt Trilby\'s request it was opened, and found to contain a large\r\nphotograph, framed and glazed, of Svengali, in the military uniform of\r\nhis own Hungarian band, and looking straight out of the picture,\r\nstraight at you. He was standing by his desk with his left hand turning\r\nover a leaf of music, and waving his b\xc3\xa2ton with his right. It was a\r\nsplendid photograph, by a Viennese photographer, and a most speaking\r\nlikeness; and Svengali looked truly fine--all made up of importance and\r\nauthority, and his big black eyes were full of stern command.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOR GECKO]\r\n\r\nMarta trembled as she looked. It was handed to Trilby, who exclaimed\r\nin surprise. She had never seen it. She had no photograph of him, and\r\nhad never possessed one.\r\n\r\nNo message of any kind, no letter of explanation, accompanied this\r\nunexpected present, which, from the postmarks on the case, seemed to\r\nhave travelled all over Europe to London, out of some remote province in\r\neastern Russia--out of the mysterious East! The poisonous\r\nEast--birthplace and home of an ill wind that blows nobody good.\r\n\r\nTrilby laid it against her legs as on a lectern, and lay gazing at it\r\nwith close attention for a long time, making a casual remark now and\r\nthen, as, "He was very handsome, I think"; or, "That uniform becomes him\r\nvery well. Why has he got it on, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "OUT OF THE MYSTERIOUS EAST"]\r\n\r\nThe others went on talking, and Mrs. Bagot made coffee.\r\n\r\nPresently Mrs. Bagot took a cup of coffee to Trilby, and found her still\r\nstaring intently at the portrait, but with her eyes dilated, and quite a\r\nstrange light in them.\r\n\r\n"Trilby, Trilby, your coffee! What is the matter, Trilby?"\r\n\r\nTrilby was smiling, with fixed eyes, and made no answer.\r\n\r\nThe others got up and gathered round her in some alarm. Marta seemed\r\nterror-stricken, and wished to snatch the photograph away, but was\r\nprevented from doing so; one didn\'t know what the consequences might be.\r\n\r\nTaffy rang the bell, and sent a servant for Dr. Thorne, who lived close\r\nby, in Fitzroy Square.\r\n\r\nPresently Trilby began to speak, quite softly, in French: "Encore une\r\nfois? bon! je veux bien! avec la voix blanche alors, n\'est-ce pas? et\r\npuis foncer au milieu. Et pas trop vite en commen\xc3\xa7ant! Battez bien la\r\nmesure, Svengali--que je puisse bien voir--car il fait d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 nuit! c\'est\r\n\xc3\xa7a! Allons, Gecko--donne-moi le ton!"\r\n\r\nThen she smiled, and seemed to beat time softly by moving her head a\r\nlittle from side to side, her eyes intent on Svengali\'s in the portrait,\r\nand suddenly she began to sing Chopin\'s Impromptu in A flat.\r\n\r\nShe hardly seemed to breathe as the notes came pouring out, without\r\nwords--mere vocalizing. It was as if breath were unnecessary for so\r\nlittle voice as she was using, though there was enough of it to fill the\r\nroom--to fill the house--to drown her small audience in holy, heavenly\r\nsweetness.\r\n\r\nShe was a consummate mistress of her art. How that could be seen! And\r\nalso how splendid had been her training! It all seemed as easy to her as\r\nopening and shutting her eyes, and yet how utterly impossible to anybody\r\nelse!\r\n\r\nBetween wonder, enchantment, and alarm they were frozen to statues--all\r\nexcept Marta, who ran out of the room, crying: "Gott im Himmel! wieder\r\nzur\xc3\xbcck! wieder zur\xc3\xbcck!"\r\n\r\nShe sang it just as she had sung it at the Salle des Bashibazoucks, only\r\nit sounded still more ineffably seductive, as she was using less\r\nvoice--using the essence of her voice, in fact--the pure spirit, the\r\nvery cream of it.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that these four watchers by that enchanted\r\ncouch were listening to not only the most divinely beautiful, but also\r\nthe most astounding feat of musical utterance ever heard out of a human\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nThe usual effect was produced. Tears were streaming down the cheeks of\r\nMrs. Bagot and Little Billee. Tears were in the Laird\'s eyes, a tear on\r\none of Taffy\'s whiskers--tears of sheer delight.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back to the quick movement again, after the adagio, her\r\nvoice grew louder and shriller, and sweet with a sweetness not of this\r\nearth; and went on increasing in volume as she quickened the time,\r\nnearing the end; and then came the dying away into all but nothing--a\r\nmere melodic breath; and then the little soft chromatic ascending\r\nrocket, up to E in alt, the last parting caress (which Svengali had\r\nintroduced as a finale, for it does not exist in the piano score).\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, she said: "\xc3\x87a y est-il, cette fois, Svengali? Ah! tant\r\nmieux, \xc3\xa0 la fin! c\'est pas malheureux! Et maintenant, mon ami, _je suis\r\nfatigu\xc3\xa9e--bon soir_!"\r\n\r\nHer head fell back on the pillow, and she lay fast asleep.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bagot took the portrait away gently. Little Billee knelt down and\r\nheld Trilby\'s hand in his and felt for her pulse, and could not find it.\r\n\r\nHe said, "Trilby! Trilby!" and put his ear to her mouth to hear her\r\nbreathe. Her breath was inaudible.\r\n\r\nBut soon she folded her hands across her breast, and uttered a little\r\nshort sigh, and in a weak voice said: "_Svengali.... Svengali....\r\nSvengali!..._"\r\n\r\nThey remained in silence round her for several minutes, terror-stricken.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came; he put his hand to her heart, his ear to her lips. He\r\nturned up one of her eyelids and looked at her eye. And then, his voice\r\nquivering with strong emotion, he stood up and said, "Madame Svengali\'s\r\ntrials and sufferings are all over!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, good God! is she _dead_?" cried Mrs. Bagot.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mrs. Bagot. She has been dead several minutes--perhaps a quarter\r\nof an hour."\r\n\r\n\r\nVINGT ANS APR\xc3\x88S\r\n\r\nPORTHOS-ATHOS, _alias_ Taffy Wynne, is sitting to breakfast (opposite\r\nhis wife) at a little table in the court-yard of that huge caravanserai\r\non the Boulevard des Capucines, Paris, where he had sat more than twenty\r\nyears ago with the Laird and Little Billee; where, in fact, he had\r\npulled Svengali\'s nose.\r\n\r\nLittle is changed in the aspect of the place: the same cosmopolite\r\ncompany, with more of the American element, perhaps; the same arrivals\r\nand departures in railway omnibuses, cabs, hired carriages; and, airing\r\nhis calves on the marble steps, stood just such another colossal and\r\nbeautiful old man in black cloth coat and knee-breeches and silk\r\nstockings as of yore, with probably the very same pinchbeck chain. Where\r\ndo they breed these magnificent old Frenchmen? In Germany, perhaps,\r\n"where all the good big waiters come from!"\r\n\r\nAnd also the same fine weather. It is always fine weather in the\r\ncourt-yard of the Grand H\xc3\xb4tel. As the Laird would say, they manage these\r\nthings better there!\r\n\r\nTaffy wears a short beard, which is turning gray. His kind blue eye is\r\nno longer choleric, but mild and friendly--as frank as ever; and full of\r\nhumorous patience. He has grown stouter; he is very big indeed, in all\r\nthree dimensions, but the symmetry and the gainliness of the athlete\r\nbelong to him still in movement and repose; and his clothes fit him\r\nbeautifully, though they are not new, and show careful beating and\r\nbrushing and ironing, and even a faint suspicion of all but\r\nimperceptible fine-drawing here and there.\r\n\r\nWhat a magnificent old man _he_ will make some day, should the Grand\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel ever run short of them! He looks as if he could be trusted down to\r\nthe ground--in all things, little or big; as if his word were as good as\r\nhis bond, and even better; his wink as good as his word, his nod as good\r\nas his wink; and, in truth, as he looks, so he is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'SVENGALI!... SVENGALI!... SVENGALI!...\'"]\r\n\r\nThe most cynical disbeliever in "the grand old name of gentleman," and\r\nits virtues as a noun of definition, would almost be justified in quite\r\ndogmatically asserting at sight, and without even being introduced,\r\nthat, at all events, Taffy is a "gentleman," inside and out, up and\r\ndown--from the crown of his head (which is getting rather bald) to the\r\nsole of his foot (by no means a small one, or a lightly shod--_ex pede\r\nHerculem_)!\r\n\r\nIndeed, this is always the first thing people say of Taffy--and the\r\nlast. It means, perhaps, that he may be a trifle dull. Well, one can\'t\r\nbe everything!\r\n\r\nPorthos was a trifle dull--and so was Athos, I think; and likewise his\r\nson, the faithful Viscount of Bragelonne--_bon chien chasse de race_!\r\nAnd so was Wilfred of Ivanhoe, the disinherited; and Edgar, the Lord of\r\nRavenswood! and so, for that matter, was Colonel Newcome, of immortal\r\nmemory!\r\n\r\nYet who does not love them--who would not wish to be like them, for\r\nbetter, for worse!\r\n\r\nTaffy\'s wife is unlike Taffy in many ways; but (fortunately for both)\r\nvery like him in some. She is a little woman, very well shaped, very\r\ndark, with black, wavy hair, and very small hands and feet; a very\r\ngraceful, handsome, and vivacious person; by no means dull; full,\r\nindeed, of quick perceptions and intuitions; deeply interested in all\r\nthat is going on about and around her, and with always lots to say about\r\nit, but not too much.\r\n\r\nShe distinctly belongs to the rare, and ever-blessed, and most precious\r\nrace of charmers.\r\n\r\nShe had fallen in love with the stalwart Taffy more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago in the Place St. Anatole des Arts, where he and she and her\r\nmother had tended the sick-couch of Little Billee--but she had never\r\ntold her love. _Tout vient \xc3\xa0 point, pour qui sait attendre!_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "TOUT VIENT \xc3\x80 POINT, POUR QUI SAIT ATTENDRE!"]\r\n\r\nThat is a capital proverb, and sometimes even a true one. Blanche Bagot\r\nhad found it to be both!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne terrible night, never to be forgotten, Taffy lay fast asleep in bed,\r\nat his rooms in Jermyn Street, for he was very tired; grief tires more\r\nthan anything, and brings a deeper slumber.\r\n\r\nThat day he had followed Trilby to her last home in Kensal Green, with\r\nLittle Billee, Mrs. Bagot, the Laird, Antony, the Greek, and Durien (who\r\nhad come over from Paris on purpose) as chief mourners; and very many\r\nother people, noble, famous, or otherwise, English and foreign; a\r\nsplendid and most representative gathering, as was duly chronicled in\r\nall the newspapers here and abroad; a fitting ceremony to close the\r\nbrief but splendid career of the greatest pleasure-giver of our time.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened by a tremendous ringing at the street-door bell, as if\r\nthe house were on fire; and then there was a hurried scrambling up in\r\nthe dark, a tumbling over stairs and kicking against banisters, and\r\nLittle Billee had burst into his room, calling out: "Oh! Taffy, Taffy!\r\nI\'m g-going mad--I\'m g-going m-mad! I\'m d-d-done for...."\r\n\r\n"All right, old fellow--just wait till I strike a light!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Taffy! I haven\'t slept for four nights--not a wink! She d-d-died\r\nwith Sv--Sv--Sv ... damn it, I can\'t get it out! that ruffian\'s name on\r\nher lips!... it was just as if he were calling her from the t-t-tomb!\r\nShe recovered her senses the very minute she saw his photograph--she was\r\nso f-fond of him she f-forgot everybody else! She\'s gone straight to\r\nhim, after all--in some other life!... to slave for him, and sing for\r\nhim, and help him to make better music than ever! Oh, T--T--oh--oh!\r\nTaffy--oh! oh! oh! catch hold! c-c-catch...." And Little Billee had all\r\nbut fallen on the floor in a fit.\r\n\r\nAnd all the old miserable business of five years before had begun over\r\nagain!\r\n\r\nThere has been too much sickness in this story, so I will tell as little\r\nas possible of poor Little Billee\'s long illness, his slow and only\r\npartial recovery, the paralysis of his powers as a painter, his quick\r\ndecline, his early death, his manly, calm, and most beautiful\r\nsurrender--the wedding of the moth with the star, of the night with the\r\nmorrow!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I, PETE COELESTES...."]\r\n\r\nFor all but blameless as his short life had been, and so full of\r\nsplendid promise and performance, nothing ever became him better than\r\nthe way he left it. It was as if he were starting on some distant holy\r\nquest, like some gallant knight of old--"A Bagot to the Rescue!" It\r\nshook the infallibility of a certain vicar down to its very foundations,\r\nand made him think more deeply about things than he had ever thought\r\nyet. It gave him pause!... and so wrung his heart that when, at the\r\nlast, he stooped to kiss his poor young dead friend\'s pure white\r\nforehead, he dropped a bigger tear on it than Little Billee (once so\r\ngiven to the dropping of big tears) had ever dropped in his life.\r\n\r\nBut it is all too sad to write about.\r\n\r\nIt was by Little Billee\'s bedside, in Devonshire, that Taffy had grown\r\nto love Blanche Bagot, and not very many weeks after it was all over\r\nthat Taffy had asked her to be his wife; and in a year they were\r\nmarried, and a very happy marriage it turned out--the one thing that\r\npoor Mrs. Bagot still looks upon as a compensation for all the griefs\r\nand troubles of her life.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year or two Blanche had perhaps been the most ardently\r\nloving of this well-assorted pair. That beautiful look of love surprised\r\n(which makes all women\'s eyes look the same) came into hers whenever she\r\nlooked at Taffy, and filled his heart with tender compunction, and a\r\nqueer sense of his own unworthiness.\r\n\r\nThen a boy was born to them, and that look fell on the boy, and the good\r\nTaffy caught it as it passed him by, and he felt a helpless, absurd\r\njealousy, that was none the less painful for being so ridiculous! and\r\nthen that look fell on another boy and yet another, so that it was\r\nthrough these boys that she looked at their father. Then _his_ eyes\r\ncaught the look, and kept it for their own use; and he grew never to\r\nlook at his wife without it; and as no daughter came, she retained for\r\nlife the monopoly of that most sweet and expressive regard.\r\n\r\nThey are not very rich. He is a far better sportsman than he will ever\r\nbe a painter; and if he doesn\'t sell his pictures, it is not because\r\nthey are too good for the public taste: indeed, he has no illusions on\r\nthat score himself, even if his wife has! He is quite the least\r\nconceited art-duffer I ever met--and I have met many far worse duffers\r\nthan Taffy.\r\n\r\nWould only that I might kill off his cousin Sir Oscar, and Sir Oscar\'s\r\nfive sons (the Wynnes are good at sons), and his seventeen grandsons,\r\nand the fourteen cousins (and their numerous male progeny), that stand\r\nbetween Taffy and the baronetcy, and whatever property goes with it, so\r\nthat he might be Sir Taffy, and dear Blanche Bagot (that was) might be\r\ncalled "my lady"! This Shakespearian holocaust would scarcely cost me a\r\npang!\r\n\r\nIt is a great temptation, when you have duly slain your first hero, to\r\nenrich hero number two beyond the dreams of avarice, and provide him\r\nwith a title and a castle and park, as well as a handsome wife and a\r\nnice family! But truth is inexorable--and, besides, they are just as\r\nhappy as they are.\r\n\r\nThey are well off enough, anyhow, to spend a week in Paris at last, and\r\neven to stop at the Grand H\xc3\xb4tel! now that two of their sons are at\r\nHarrow (where their father was before them), and the third is safe at a\r\npreparatory school at Elstree, Herts.\r\n\r\nIt is their first outing since the honeymoon, and the Laird should have\r\ncome with them.\r\n\r\nBut the good Laird of Cockpen (who is now a famous Royal Academician) is\r\npreparing for a honeymoon of his own. He has gone to Scotland to be\r\nmarried himself--to wed a fair and clever country-woman of just a\r\nsuitable age, for he has known her ever since she was a bright little\r\nlassie in short frocks, and he a promising A.R.A. (the pride of his\r\nnative Dundee)--a marriage of reason, and well-seasoned affection, and\r\nmutual esteem--and therefore sure to turn out a happy one! and in\r\nanother fortnight or so the pair of them will very possibly be sitting\r\nto breakfast opposite each other at that very corner table in the\r\ncourt-yard of the Grand H\xc3\xb4tel! and she will laugh at everything he\r\nsays--and they will live happily ever after.\r\n\r\nSo much for hero number three--D\'Artagnan! Here\'s to you, Sandy\r\nMcAlister, canniest, genialest, and most humorous of Scots! most\r\ndelicate, and dainty, and fanciful of British painters! "I trink your\r\nhealth, mit your family\'s--may you lif long--and brosper!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo Taffy and his wife have come for their second honeymoon, their\r\nIndian-summer honeymoon, alone; and are well content that it should be\r\nso. Two\'s always company for such a pair--the amusing one and the\r\namusable!--and they are making the most of it!\r\n\r\nThey have been all over the quartier latin, and revisited the\r\nwell-remembered spots; and even been allowed to enter the old studio,\r\nthrough the kindness of the concierge (who is no longer Madame Vinard).\r\nIt is tenanted by two American painters, who are coldly civil on being\r\nthus disturbed in the middle of their work.\r\n\r\nThe studio is very spick and span, and most respectable. Trilby\'s foot,\r\nand the poem, and the sheet of plate-glass have been improved away, and\r\na bookshelf put in their place. The new concierge (who has only been\r\nthere a year) knows nothing of Trilby, and of the Vinards, only that\r\nthey are rich and prosperous, and live somewhere in the south of France,\r\nand that Monsieur Vinard is mayor of his commune. _Que le bon Dieu les\r\nb\xc3\xa9nisse! c\'\xc3\xa9taient de bien braves gens._\r\n\r\nThen Mr. and Mrs. Taffy have also been driven (in an open cal\xc3\xa8che with\r\ntwo horses) through the Bois de Boulogne to St. Cloud; and to\r\nVersailles, where they lunched at the H\xc3\xb4tel des R\xc3\xa9servoirs--_parlez-moi\r\nde \xc3\xa7a_! and to St. Germain, and to Meudon (where they lunched at la loge\r\ndu garde champ\xc3\xaatre--a new one); they have visited the Salon, the Louvre,\r\nthe porcelain manufactory at S\xc3\xa8vres, the Gobelins, the H\xc3\xb4tel Cluny, the\r\nInvalides, with Napoleon\'s tomb, and seen half a dozen churches,\r\nincluding Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle; and dined with the Dodors\r\nat their charming villa near Asni\xc3\xa8res, and with the Zouzous at the\r\nsplendid H\xc3\xb4tel de la Rochemartel, and with the Duriens in the Parc\r\nMonceau (Dodor\'s food was best and Zouzou\'s worst; and at Durien\'s the\r\ncompany and talk were so good that one forgot to notice the food--and\r\nthat was a pity). And the young Dodors are all right--and so are the\r\nyoung Duriens. As for the young Zouzous, there aren\'t any--and that\'s a\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nAnd they\'ve been to the Vari\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9s and seen Madame Chaumont, and to the\r\nFran\xc3\xa7ais and seen Sarah Bernhardt and C\xc3\xb4quelin and Delaunay, and to the\r\nOp\xc3\xa9ra and heard Monsieur Lassalle.\r\n\r\nAnd to-day being their last day, they are going to laze and flane about\r\nthe boulevards, and buy things, and lunch anywhere, "sur le pouce," and\r\ndo the Bois once more and see tout Paris, and dine early at Durand\'s, or\r\nBignon\'s (or else the Caf\xc3\xa9 des Ambassadeurs), and finish up the\r\nwell-spent day at the "Mouches d\'Espagne"--the new theatre in the\r\nBoulevard Poissonni\xc3\xa8re--to see Madame Cantharidi in "Petits Bonheurs de\r\nContrebande," which they are told is immensely droll and quite\r\nproper--funny without being vulgar! Dodor was their informant--he had\r\ntaken Madame Dodor to see it three or four times.\r\n\r\nMadame Cantharidi, as everybody knows, is a very clever but extremely\r\nplain old woman with a cracked voice--of spotless reputation, and the\r\nirreproachable mother of a grown-up family whom she has brought up in\r\nperfection. They have never been allowed to see their mother (and\r\ngrandmother) act--not even the sons. Their excellent father (who adores\r\nboth them and her) has drawn the line at that!\r\n\r\nIn private life she is "quite the lady," but on the stage--well, go and\r\nsee her, and you will understand how she comes to be the idol of the\r\nParisian public. For she is the true and liberal dispenser to them of\r\nthat modern "esprit gaulois" which would make the good Rabelais turn\r\nuneasily in his grave and blush there like a Benedictine Sister.\r\n\r\nAnd truly she deserves the reverential love and gratitude of her chers\r\nParisiens! She amused them all through the Empire; during the _ann\xc3\xa9e\r\nterrible_ she was their only stay and comfort, and has been their chief\r\ndelight ever since, and is now.\r\n\r\nWhen they come back from _La Revanche_, may Madame Cantharidi be still\r\nat her post, "Les mouches d\'Espagne," to welcome the returning heroes,\r\nand exult and crow with them in her funny cracked old voice; or, haply,\r\neven console them once more, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "PETITS BONHEURS DE CONTREBANDE"]\r\n\r\n"Victors or vanquished, they will laugh the same!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Taffy is a poor French scholar. One must know French very well\r\nindeed (and many other things besides) to seize the subtle points of\r\nMadame Cantharidi\'s play (and by-play)!\r\n\r\nBut Madame Cantharidi has so droll a face and voice, and such very\r\ndroll, odd movements that Mrs. Taffy goes into fits of laughter as soon\r\nas the quaint little old lady comes on the stage. So heartily does she\r\nlaugh that a good Parisian bourgeois turns round and remarks to his\r\nwife: "V\'l\xc3\xa0 une jolie p\'tite Anglaise qui n\'est pas b\xc3\xa9gueule, an moins!\r\nEt l\' gros b\xc5\x93uf avec les yeux bleus en boules de loto--c\'est son\r\nmari, sans doute! il n\'a pas l\'air trop content par exemple, celui-l\xc3\xa0!"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the good Taffy (who knows French very well indeed) is\r\nquite scandalized, and very angry with Dodor for sending them there; and\r\nas soon as the first act is finished he means, without any fuss, to take\r\nhis wife away.\r\n\r\nAs he sits patiently, too indignant to laugh at what is really funny in\r\nthe piece (much of it is vulgar _without_ being funny), he finds himself\r\nwatching a little white-haired man in the orchestra, a fiddler, the\r\nshape of whose back seems somehow familiar, as he plays an _obbligato_\r\naccompaniment to a very broadly comic song of Madame Cantharidi\'s. He\r\nplays beautifully--like a master--and the loud applause is as much for\r\nhim as for the vocalist.\r\n\r\nPresently this fiddler turns his head so that his profile can be seen,\r\nand Taffy recognizes him.\r\n\r\nAfter five minutes\' thought, Taffy takes a leaf out of his pocket-book\r\nand writes (in perfectly grammatical French):\r\n\r\n     "DEAR GECKO,--You have not forgotten Taffy Wynne, I hope; and\r\n     Litrebili, and Litrebili\'s sister, who is now Mrs. Taffy Wynne. We\r\n     leave Paris to-morrow, and would like very much to see you once\r\n     more. Will you, after the play, come and sup with us at the Caf\xc3\xa9\r\n     Anglais? If so, look up and make \'yes\' with the head, and enchant\r\n\r\n     "Your well-devoted TAFFY WYNNE."\r\n\r\nHe gives this, folded, to an attendant--for "le premier violon--celui\r\nqui a des cheveux blancs."\r\n\r\nPresently he sees Gecko receive the note and read it and ponder for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nThen Gecko looks round the theatre, and Taffy waves his handkerchief and\r\ncatches the eye of the premier violon, who "makes \'yes\' with the head."\r\n\r\nAnd then, the first act over, Mr. and Mrs. Wynne leave the theatre; Mr.\r\nexplaining why, and Mrs. very ready to go, as she was beginning to feel\r\nstrangely uncomfortable without quite realizing as yet what was amiss\r\nwith the lively Madame Cantharidi.\r\n\r\nThey went to the Caf\xc3\xa9 Anglais and bespoke a nice little room on the\r\nentresol overlooking the boulevard, and ordered a nice little supper;\r\nsalmi of something very good, mayonnaise of lobster, and one or two\r\nother dishes better still--and chambertin of the best. Taffy was\r\nparticular about these things on a holiday, and regardless of expense.\r\nPorthos was very hospitable, and liked good food and plenty of it; and\r\nAthos dearly loved good wine!\r\n\r\nAnd then they went and sat at a little round table outside the Caf\xc3\xa9 de\r\nla Paix on the boulevard, near the Grand Op\xc3\xa9ra, where it is always very\r\ngay, and studied Paris life, and nursed their appetites till\r\nsupper-time.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven Gecko made his appearance--very meek and humble. He\r\nlooked old--ten years older than he really was--much bowed down, and as\r\nif he had roughed it all his life, and had found living a desperate\r\nlong, hard grind.\r\n\r\nHe kissed Mrs. Taffy\'s hand, and seemed half inclined to kiss Taffy\'s\r\ntoo, and was almost tearful in his pleasure at meeting them again, and\r\nhis gratitude at being asked to sup with them. He had soft, clinging,\r\ncaressing manners, like a nice dog\'s, that made you his friend at once.\r\nHe was obviously genuine and sincere, and quite pathetically simple, as\r\nhe always had been.\r\n\r\nAt first he could scarcely eat for nervous excitement; but Taffy\'s fine\r\nexample and Mrs. Taffy\'s genial, easy-going cordiality (and a couple of\r\nglasses of chambertin) soon put him at his ease and woke up his dormant\r\nappetite; which was a very large one, poor fellow!\r\n\r\nHe was told all about Little Billee\'s death, and deeply moved to hear\r\nthe cause which had brought it about, and then they talked of Trilby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTER GECKO]\r\n\r\nHe pulled her watch out of his waistcoat-pocket and reverently kissed\r\nit, exclaiming: "Ah! c\'\xc3\xa9tait un ange! un ange du Paradis! when I tell\r\nyou I lived with them for five years! Oh! her kindness, Dio, dio Maria!\r\nIt was \'Gecko this!\' and \'Gecko that!\' and \'Poor Gecko, your toothache,\r\nhow it worries me!\' and \'Gecko, how tired and pale you look--you\r\ndistress me so, looking like that! Shall I mix you a maitrank?\' And\r\n\'Gecko, you love artichokes \xc3\xa0 la Barigoule; they remind you of Paris--I\r\nhave heard you say so. Well, I have found out where to get artichokes,\r\nand I know how to do them \xc3\xa0 la Barigoule, and you shall have them for\r\ndinner to-day and to-morrow and all the week after!\' and we did!\r\n\r\n"Ach! dear kind one--what did I really care for artichokes \xc3\xa0 la\r\nBarigoule?...\r\n\r\n"And it was always like that--always--and to Svengali and old Marta just\r\nthe same! and she was never well--never! toujours souffrante!\r\n\r\n"And it was she who supported us all--in luxury and splendor sometimes!"\r\n\r\n"And _what_ an artist!" said Taffy.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! but all that was Svengali, you know. Svengali was the greatest\r\nartist I ever met! Monsieur, Svengali was a demon, a magician! I used to\r\nthink him a god! He found me playing in the streets for copper coins,\r\nand took me by the hand, and was my only friend, and taught me all I\r\never knew--and yet he could not play my instrument!\r\n\r\n"And now he is dead, I have forgotten how to play it myself! That\r\nEnglish jail! it demoralized me, ruined me forever! ach! quel enfer, nom\r\nde Dieu (pardon, madame)! I am just good enough to play the _obbligato_\r\nat the Mouches d\'Espagne, when the old Cantharidi sings,\r\n\r\n    "\'V\'l\xc3\xa0 mon mari qui r\'garde\r\n      Prends garde--ne m\'chatouille plus!\'\r\n\r\n"It does not want much of an _obbligato_, hein, a song so noble and so\r\nbeautiful as that!\r\n\r\n"And that song, monsieur, all Paris is singing it now. And that is the\r\nParis that went mad when Trilby sang the \'Nussbaum\' of Schumann at the\r\nSalle des Bashibazoucks. You heard her? Well!"\r\n\r\nAnd here poor Gecko tried to laugh a little sardonic laugh in falsetto,\r\nlike Svengali\'s, full of scorn and bitterness--and very nearly\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n"But what made you strike him with--with that knife, you know?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, monsieur, it had been coming on for a long time. He used to work\r\nTrilby too hard; it was killing her--it killed her at last! And then at\r\nthe end he was unkind to her and scolded her and called her\r\nnames--horrid names--and then one day in London he struck her. He struck\r\nher on the fingers with his b\xc3\xa2ton, and she fell down on her knees and\r\ncried ...\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, I would have defended Trilby against a locomotive going\r\ngrande vitesse! against my own father--against the Emperor of\r\nAustria--against the Pope! and I am a good Catholic, monsieur! I would\r\nhave gone to the scaffold for her, and to the devil after!"\r\n\r\nAnd he piously crossed himself.\r\n\r\n"But, Svengali--wasn\'t _he_ very fond of her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, monsieur! quant \xc3\xa0 \xc3\xa7a, passionately! But she did not love him as\r\nhe wished to be loved. She loved Litrebili, monsieur! Litrebili, the\r\nbrother of madame. And I suppose that Svengali grew angry and jealous at\r\nlast. He changed as soon as he came to Paris. Perhaps Paris reminded him\r\nof Litrebili--and reminded Trilby, too!"\r\n\r\n"But how on earth did Svengali ever manage to teach her how to sing\r\nlike that? She had no ear for music whatever when _we_ knew her!"\r\n\r\nGecko was silent for a while, and Taffy filled his glass, and gave him a\r\ncigar, and lit one himself.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, no--that is true. She had not much ear. But she had such a\r\nvoice as had never been heard. Svengali knew that. He had found it out\r\nlong ago. Litolff had found it out, too. One day Svengali heard Litolff\r\ntell Meyerbeer that the most beautiful female voice in Europe belonged\r\nto an English grisette who sat as a model to sculptors in the quartier\r\nlatin, but that unfortunately she was quite tone-deaf, and couldn\'t sing\r\none single note in tune. Imagine how Svengali chuckled! I see it from\r\nhere!\r\n\r\n"Well, we both taught her together--for three years--morning, noon, and\r\nnight--six--eight hours a day. It used to split me the heart to see her\r\nworked like that! We took her voice note by note--there was no end to\r\nher notes, each more beautiful than the other--velvet and gold,\r\nbeautiful flowers, pearls, diamonds, rubies--drops of dew and honey;\r\npeaches, oranges, and lemons! en veux-tu en voil\xc3\xa0!--all the perfumes and\r\nspices of the Garden of Eden! Svengali with his little flexible\r\nflageolet, I with my violin--that is how we taught her to make the\r\nsounds--and then how to use them. She was a ph\xc3\xa9nom\xc3\xa8ne, monsieur! She\r\ncould keep on one note and make it go through all the colors in the\r\nrainbow--according to the way Svengali looked at her. It would make you\r\nlaugh--it would make you cry--but, cry or laugh, it was the sweetest,\r\nthe most touching, the most beautiful note you ever heard--except all\r\nher others! and each had as many overtones as the bells in the Carillon\r\nde Notre Dame. She could run up and down the scales, chromatic scales,\r\nquicker and better and smoother than Svengali on the piano, and more in\r\ntune than any piano! and her shake--ach! twin stars, monsieur! She was\r\nthe greatest contralto, the greatest soprano the world has ever known!\r\nthe like of her has never been! the like of her will never be again! and\r\nyet she only sang in public for two years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'WE TOOK HER VOICE NOTE BY NOTE\'"]\r\n\r\n"Ach! those breaks and runs and sudden leaps from darkness into light\r\nand back again--from earth to heaven!... those slurs and swoops and\r\nslides \xc3\xa0 la Paganini from one note to another, like a swallow\r\nflying!... or a gull! Do you remember them? how they drove you mad? Let\r\nany other singer in the world try to imitate them--they would make you\r\nsick! That was Svengali ... he was a magician!\r\n\r\n"And how she looked, singing! do you remember? her hands behind her--her\r\ndear, sweet, slender foot on a little stool--her thick hair lying down\r\nall along her back! And that good smile like the Madonna\'s so soft and\r\nbright and kind! _Ach! Bel ucel di Dio!_ it was to make you weep for\r\nlove, merely to see her (_c\'\xc3\xa9tait \xc3\xa0 vous faire pleurer d\'amour, rien que\r\nde la voir_)! That was Trilby! Nightingale and bird-of-paradise in one!\r\n\r\n"Enfin she could do anything--utter any sound she liked, when once\r\nSvengali had shown her how--and he was the greatest master that ever\r\nlived! and when once she knew a thing, she knew it. _Et voil\xc3\xa0!_"\r\n\r\n"How strange," said Taffy, "that she should have suddenly gone out of\r\nher senses that night at Drury Lane, and so completely forgotten it all!\r\nI suppose she saw Svengali die in the box opposite, and that drove her\r\nmad!"\r\n\r\nAnd then Taffy told the little fiddler about Trilby\'s death-song, like a\r\nswan\'s, and Svengali\'s photograph. But Gecko had heard it all from\r\nMarta, who was now dead.\r\n\r\nGecko sat and smoked and pondered for a while, and looked from one to\r\nthe other. Then he pulled himself together with an effort, so to speak,\r\nand said, "Monsieur, she never went mad--not for one moment!"\r\n\r\n"What! Do you mean to say she _deceived_ us all?"\r\n\r\n"Non, monsieur! She could never deceive anybody, and never would. _She\r\nhad forgotten--voil\xc3\xa0 tout!_"\r\n\r\n"But hang it all, my friend, one doesn\'t _forget_ such a--"\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, listen! She is dead. And Svengali is dead--and Marta also.\r\nAnd I have a good little malady that will kill me soon, _Gott sei\r\ndank_--and without much pain.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you a secret.\r\n\r\n"_There were two Trilbys._ There was the Trilby you knew, who could not\r\nsing one single note in tune. She was an angel of paradise. She is now!\r\nBut she had no more idea of singing than I have of winning a\r\nsteeple-chase at the croix de Berny. She could no more sing than a\r\nfiddle can play itself! She could never tell one tune from another--one\r\nnote from the next. Do you remember how she tried to sing \'Ben Bolt\'\r\nthat day when she first came to the studio in the Place St. Anatole des\r\nArts? It was droll, _hein? \xc3\xa0 se boucher les oreilles_! Well, that was\r\nTrilby, your Trilby! that was my Trilby too--and I loved her as one\r\nloves an only love, an only sister, an only child--a gentle martyr on\r\nearth, a blessed saint in heaven! And that Trilby was enough for _me_!\r\n\r\n"And that was the Trilby that loved your brother, madame--oh! but with\r\nall the love that was in her! He did not know what he had lost, your\r\nbrother! Her love, it was immense, like her voice, and just as full of\r\ncelestial sweetness and sympathy! She told me everything! _ce pauvre\r\nLitrebili, ce qu\'il a perdu_!\r\n\r\n"But all at once--pr-r-r-out! presto! augenblick!... with one wave of\r\nhis hand over her--with one look of his eye--with a word--Svengali could\r\nturn her into the other Trilby, _his_ Trilby, and make her do whatever\r\nhe liked ... you might have run a red-hot needle into her and she would\r\nnot have felt it....\r\n\r\n"He had but to say \'Dors!\' and she suddenly became an unconscious Trilby\r\nof marble, who could produce wonderful sounds--just the sounds he\r\nwanted, and nothing else--and think his thoughts and wish his\r\nwishes--and love him at his bidding with a strange unreal factitious\r\nlove ... just his own love for himself turned inside out--_\xc3\xa0\r\nl\'envers_--and reflected back on him, as from a mirror ... _un \xc3\xa9cho, un\r\nsimulacre, quoi! pas autre chose!_.... It was not worth having! I was\r\nnot even jealous!\r\n\r\n"Well, that was the Trilby he taught how to sing--and--and I helped him,\r\nGod of heaven forgive me! That Trilby was just a singing-machine--an\r\norgan to play upon--an instrument of music--a Stradivarius--a flexible\r\nflageolet of flesh and blood--a voice, and nothing more--just the\r\nunconscious voice that Svengali sang with--for it takes two to sing like\r\nla Svengali, monsieur--the one who has got the voice, and the one who\r\nknows what to do with it.... So that when you heard her sing the\r\n\'Nussbaum,\' the \'Impromptu,\' you heard Svengali singing with her voice,\r\njust as you hear Joachim play a chaconne of Bach with his fiddle!...\r\nHerr Joachim\'s fiddle ... what does it know of Sebastian Bach? and as\r\nfor chaconnes ... _il s\'en moque pas mal, ce fameux violon!_ ...\r\n\r\n"And _our_ Trilby ... what did she know of Schumann, Chopin?--nothing at\r\nall! She mocked herself not badly of Nussbaums and impromptus ... they\r\nwould make her yawn to demantibulate her jaws!... When Svengali\'s Trilby\r\nwas being taught to sing ... when Svengali\'s Trilby was singing--or\r\nseemed to _you_ as if she were singing--_our_ Trilby had ceased to exist\r\n... _our_ Trilby was fast asleep ... in fact, _our_ Trilby was\r\n_dead_....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NIGHTINGALE\'S FIRST SONG]\r\n\r\n"Ah, monsieur ... that Trilby of Svengali\'s! I have heard her sing to\r\nkings and queens in royal palaces!... as no woman has ever sung before\r\nor since.... I have seen emperors and grand-dukes kiss her hand,\r\nmonsieur--and their wives and daughters kiss her lips, and weep....\r\n\r\n"I have seen the horses taken out of her sledge and the pick of the\r\nnobility drag her home to the hotel ... with torchlights and choruses\r\nand shoutings of glory and long life to her!... and serenades all night,\r\nunder her window!... _she_ never knew! she heard nothing--felt\r\nnothing--saw nothing! and she bowed to them, right and left, like a\r\nqueen!\r\n\r\n"I have played the fiddle for her while she sang in the streets, at\r\nfairs and festas and Kermessen ... and seen the people go mad to hear\r\nher ... and once, at Prague, Svengali fell down in a fit from sheer\r\nexcitement! and then, suddenly, _our_ Trilby woke up and wondered what\r\nit was all about ... and we took him home and put him to bed and left\r\nhim with Marta--and Trilby and I went together arm in arm all over the\r\ntown to fetch a doctor and buy things for supper--and that was the\r\nhappiest hour in all my life!\r\n\r\n"Ach! what an existence! what travels! what triumphs! what adventures!\r\nThings to fill a book--a dozen books--Those five happy years--with those\r\ntwo Trilbys! what recollections!... I think of nothing else, night or\r\nday ... even as I play the fiddle for old Cantharidi. Ach!... To think\r\nhow often I have played the fiddle for la Svengali ... to have done that\r\nis to have lived ... and then to come home to Trilby ... _our_ Trilby\r\n... the _real_ Trilby!... Got sei dank! Ich habe _geliebt und gelebet!\r\ngeliebt und gelebet! geliebt und gelebet!_ Cristo di Dio.... Sweet\r\nsister in heaven.... \xc3\x94 Dieu de Mis\xc3\xa8re, ayez piti\xc3\xa9 de nous...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis eyes were red, and his voice was high and shrill and tremulous and\r\nfull of tears; these remembrances were too much for him; and perhaps\r\nalso the chambertin! He put his elbows on the table and hid his face in\r\nhis hands and wept, muttering to himself in his own language (Whatever\r\nthat might have been--Polish, probably) as if he were praying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'ICH HABE _GELIEBT UND GELEBET_!\'"]\r\n\r\nTaffy and his wife got up and leaned on the window-bar and looked out\r\non the deserted boulevards, where an army of scavengers, noiseless and\r\ntaciturn, was cleansing the asphalt roadway. The night above was dark,\r\nbut "star-dials hinted of morn," and a fresh breeze had sprung up,\r\nmaking the leaves dance and rustle on the sycamore-trees along the\r\nBoulevard--a nice little breeze; just the sort of little breeze to do\r\nParis good. A four-wheel cab came by at a foot pace, the driver humming\r\na tune; Taffy hailed him; he said, "V\'l\xc3\xa0, m\'sieur!" and drew up.\r\n\r\nTaffy rang the bell, and asked for the bill, and paid it. Gecko had\r\napparently fallen asleep. Taffy gently woke him up, and told him how\r\nlate it was. The poor little man seemed dazed and rather tipsy, and\r\nlooked older than ever; sixty, seventy--any age you like. Taffy helped\r\nhim on with his great-coat, and, taking him by the arm, led him\r\ndown-stairs, giving him his card, and telling him how glad he was to\r\nhave seen him, and that he would write to him from England--a promise\r\nwhich was kept, one may be sure.\r\n\r\nGecko uncovered his fuzzy white head, and took Mrs. Taffy\'s hand and\r\nkissed it, and thanked her warmly for her "si bon et sympathique\r\naccueil."\r\n\r\nThen Taffy all but lifted him into the cab, the jolly cabman saying:\r\n\r\n"Ah! bon--connais bien, celui l\xc3\xa0; vous savez--c\'est lui qui joue du\r\nviolon aux Mouches d\'Espagne! Il a soup\xc3\xa9, l\'bourgeois; n\'est-ce pas,\r\nm\'sieur? \'petits bonheurs de contrebande,\' hein?... ayez pas peur! on\r\nvous aura soin de lui! il joue joliment bien, m\'sieur; n\'est-ce pas?"\r\n\r\nTaffy shook Gecko\'s hand, and asked,\r\n\r\n"O\xc3\xb9 restez-vous, Gecko?"\r\n\r\n"Quarante-huit, Rue des Pousse-cailloux, au cinqui\xc3\xa8me."\r\n\r\n"How strange!" said Taffy to his wife--"how touching! why, that\'s where\r\nTrilby used to live--the very number! the very floor!"\r\n\r\n"Oui, oui," said Gecko, waking up; "c\'est l\'ancienne mansarde \xc3\xa0\r\nTrilby--j\'y suis depuis douze ans--_j\'y suis, j\'y reste_...."\r\n\r\nAnd he laughed feebly at his mild little joke.\r\n\r\nTaffy told the address to the cabman, and gave him five francs.\r\n\r\n"Merci, m\'sieur! C\'est de l\'aut\' c\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 de l\'eau--pr\xc3\xa8s de la Sorbonne,\r\ns\'pas? On vous aura soin du bourgeois; soyez tranquille--ayez pas peur!\r\nquarante-huit; on y va! Bonsoir, monsieur et dame!" And he clacked his\r\nwhip and rattled away, singing:\r\n\r\n    "V\'l\xc3\xa0 mon mari qui r\'garde--\r\n       Prends garde!\r\n     Ne m\'chatouill\' plus!"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Wynne walked back to the hotel, which was not far. She hung\r\non to his big arm and crept close to him, and shivered a little. It was\r\nquite chilly. Their footsteps were very audible in the stillness;\r\n"pit-pat, flopety-clop," otherwise they were both silent. They were\r\ntired, yawny, sleepy, and very sad; and each was thinking (and knew the\r\nother was thinking) that a week in Paris was just enough--and how nice\r\nit would be, in just a few hours more, to hear the rooks cawing round\r\ntheir own quiet little English country home--where three jolly boys\r\nwould soon be coming for the holidays.\r\n\r\nAnd there we will leave them to their useful, hum-drum, happy domestic\r\nexistence--than which there is no better that I know of, at their time\r\nof life--and no better time of life than theirs!\r\n\r\n    "_O\xc3\xb9 peut-on \xc3\xaatre mieux qu\'au sein de ta famille?_"\r\n\r\nThat blessed harbor of refuge well within our reach, and having really\r\ncut our wisdom teeth at last, and learned the ropes, and left off\r\nhankering after the moon--we can do with so little down here....\r\n\r\n    A little work, a little play\r\n    To keep us going--and so, good-day!\r\n\r\n    A little warmth, a little light\r\n    Of love\'s bestowing--and so, good-night!\r\n\r\n    A little fun, to match the sorrow\r\n    Of each day\'s growing--and so, good-morrow!\r\n\r\n    A little trust that when we die\r\n    We reap our sowing! And so--good-bye!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE DU MAURIER\r\n\r\nTHE MARTIAN. A Novel. Illustrated by the Author.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
