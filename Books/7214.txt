One expresses the passionate revolt of a homeless\r\nwanderer against the conventional routine of modern life. The other\r\ncelebrates a root-fast existence bounded in every direction by\r\nmonotonous chores. The issuance of two such books from the same pen\r\nsuggests to the superficial view a complete reversal of position. The\r\ntruth, however, is that Hamsun stands today where he has always stood.\r\nHis objective is the same. If he has changed, it is only in the\r\nintensity of his feeling and the mode of his attack. What, above all, he\r\nhates and combats is the artificial uselessness of existence which to\r\nhim has become embodied in the life of the city as opposed to that of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nProblems do not enter into the novels of Hamsun in the same manner as\r\nthey did into the plays of Ibsen. Hamsun would seem to take life as it\r\nis, not with any pretense at its complete acceptability, but without\r\nhope or avowed intention of making it over. If his tolerance be never\r\nfree from satire, his satire is on the other hand always easily\r\ntolerant. One might almost suspect him of viewing life as something\r\nstatic against which all fight would be futile. Even life\'s worst\r\nbrutalities are related with an offhandedness of manner that makes you\r\nlook for the joke that must be at the bottom of them. The word\r\n_reform_ would seem to be strangely eliminated from his dictionary,\r\nor, if present, it might be found defined as a humorous conception of\r\nsomething intrinsically unachievable.\r\n\r\nHamsun would not be the artist he is if he were less deceptive. He has\r\nhis problems no less than Ibsen had, and he is much preoccupied with\r\nthem even when he appears lost in ribald laughter. They are different\r\nfrom Ibsen\'s, however, and in that difference lies one of the chief\r\nexplanations of Hamsun\'s position as an artist. All of Ibsen\'s problems\r\nbecame in the last instance reducible to a single relationship--that\r\nbetween the individual and his own self. To be himself was his cry and\r\nhis task. With this consummation in view, he plumbed every depth of\r\nhuman nature. This one thing achieved, all else became insignificant.\r\n\r\nHamsun begins where Ibsen ended, one might say. The one problem never\r\nconsciously raised by him as a problem is that of man\'s duty or ability\r\nto express his own nature. That is taken for granted. The figures\r\npopulating the works of Hamsun, whether centrally placed or moving\r\nshadowlike in the periphery, are first of all themselves--agressively,\r\ninevitably, unconsciously so, In other words, they are like their\r\ncreator. They may perish tragically or ridiculously as a result of their\r\ncommon inability to lay violent hand on their own natures. They may go\r\nthrough life warped and dwarfed for lack of an adjustment that to most\r\nof us might seem both easy and natural. Their own selves may become\r\nmore clearly revealed to them by harsh or happy contacts with life, and\r\nthey may change their surfaces accordingly. The one thing never\r\noccurring to them is that they might, for the sake of something or some\r\none outside of themselves, be anything but what they are.\r\n\r\nThere are interferences, however, and it is from these that Hamsun\'s\r\nproblems spring. A man may prosper or suffer by being himself, and in\r\nneither case is the fault his own. There are factors that more or less\r\nfatally influence and circumscribe the supremely important factor that\r\nis his own self. Roughly these fall into three groups suggestive of\r\nthree classes of relationships: (1) between man and his general\r\nenvironment; (2) between man and that ever-present force of life which\r\nwe call love; and (3) between man and life in its entirety, as an\r\nomnipotence that some of us call God and others leave unnamed. Hamsun\'s\r\ndeceptive preference for indirectness is shown by the fact that, while\r\nhe tries to make us believe that his work is chiefly preoccupied with\r\nproblems of the second class, his mind is really busy with those of the\r\nfirst class. The explanation is simple. Nothing helps like love to\r\nbring out the unique qualities of a man\'s nature. On the other hand,\r\nthere is nothing that does more to prevent a man from being himself than\r\nthe ruts of habit into which his environment always tends to drive him.\r\nThere are two kinds of environment, natural and human. Hamsun appears to\r\nthink that the less you have of one and the more of the other, the\r\nbetter for yourself and for humanity as a whole. The city to him is\r\nprimarily concentrated human environment, and as such bad. This phase of\r\nhis attitude toward life almost amounts to a phobia. It must be\r\nconnected with personal experiences of unusual depth and intensity.\r\nPerhaps it offers a key that may be well worth searching for. Hamsun was\r\nborn in the country, of and among peasants. In such surroundings he\r\ngrew up. The removal of his parents from the central inland part of\r\nNorway to the rocky northern coast meant a change of natural setting,\r\nbut not a human contact. The sea must have come into his life as a\r\nrevelation, and yet it plays an astonishingly small part in his work. It\r\nis always present, but always in the distance. You hear of it, but you\r\nare never taken to it.\r\n\r\nAt about fifteen, Hamsun had an experience which is rarely mentioned as\r\npart of the scant biographical material made available by his reserve\r\nconcerning his own personality. He returned to the old home of his\r\nparents in the Gudbrand Valley and worked for a few months as clerk in a\r\ncountry store--a store just like any one of those that figure so\r\nconspicuously in almost every one of his novels. The place and the work\r\nmust have made a revolutionary impression on him. It apparently aroused\r\nlongings, and it probably laid the basis for resistances and resentments\r\nthat later blossomed into weedlike abundance as he came in contact with\r\nreal city life. There runs through his work a strange sense of sympathy\r\nfor the little store on the border of the wilderness, but it is also\r\nstamped as the forerunner and panderer of the lures of the city.\r\n\r\nAs a boy of eighteen, when working in a tiny coast town as a cobbler\'s\r\napprentice, he ventured upon his first literary endeavors and actually\r\nmanaged to get two volumes printed at his own cost. The art of writing\r\nwas in his blood, exercising a call and a command that must have been\r\nfelt as a pain at times, and as a consecration at other times. Books\r\nand writing were connected with the city. Perhaps the hatred that later\r\ndays developed, had its roots in a thwarted passion. Even in the little\r\ncommunity where his first scribblings reached print he must have felt\r\nhimself in urban surroundings, and perhaps those first crude volumes\r\ndrew upon him laughter and scorn that his sensitive soul never forgot.\r\nIf something of the kind happened, the seed thus sown was nourished\r\nplentifully afterwards, when, as a young man, Hamsun pitted his\r\nambitions against the indifference first of Christiania and then of\r\nChicago. The result was a defeat that seemed the more bitter because it\r\nlooked like punishment incurred by straying after false gods.\r\n\r\nOthers have suffered in the same way, although, being less rigidly\r\nthemselves, they may not, like Hamsun, have taken a perverse pleasure in\r\ndriving home the point of the agony. Others have thought and said harsh\r\nthings of the cities. But no one that I can recall has equalled Hamsun\r\nin his merciless denunciation of the very principle of urbanity. The\r\ntruth of it seems to be that Hamsun\'s pilgrimage to the bee hives where\r\nmodern humanity clusters typically, was an essential violation of\r\nsomething within himself that mattered even more than his literary\r\nambition to his soul\'s integrity. Perhaps, if I am right, he is the\r\nfirst genuine peasant who has risen to such artistic mastery, reaching\r\nits ultimate heights through a belated recognition of his own proper\r\nsettings. Hamsun was sixty when he wrote "Growth of the Soil." It is the\r\nfirst work in which he celebrates the life of the open country for its\r\nown sake, and not merely as a contrast to the artificiality and\r\nselfishness of the cities. It was written, too, after he had definitely\r\nwithdrawn himself from the gathering places of the writers and the\r\nartists to give an equal share of his time and attention to the tilling\r\nof the soil that was at last his own. It is the harvest of his ultimate\r\nself-discovery.\r\n\r\nThe various phases of his campaign against city life are also\r\ninteresting and illuminating. Early in his career as a writer he tried\r\nan open attack in full force by a couple of novels, "Shallow Soil" and\r\n"Editor Lynge", dealing sarcastically with the literary Bohemia of the\r\nNorwegian capital. They were, on the whole, failures--artistically\r\nrather than commercially. They are among his poorest books. The attack\r\nwas never repeated in that form. He retired to the country, so to speak,\r\nand tried from there to strike at what he could reach of the ever\r\nexpanding, ever devouring city. After that the city, like the sea, is\r\nalways found in the distance. One feels it without ever seeing it.\r\nThere is fear as well as hatred in his treatment of it.\r\n\r\nIn the country it is represented not so much by the store, which, after\r\nall, fills an unmistakable need on the part of the rural population, as\r\nby the representatives of the various professions. For these Hamsun\r\nentertains a hostile feeling hardly less marked than that bestowed on\r\ntheir place of origin, whither, to his openly declared disgust, they are\r\nalways longing. It does not matter whether they are ministers or actors,\r\nlawyers or doctors--they are all tarred with the same brush. Their\r\ncommon characteristic is their rootlessness. They have no real home,\r\nbecause to Hamsun a home is unthinkable apart from a space of soil\r\npossessed in continuity by successive generations. They are always\r\ndespising the surroundings in which they find themselves temporarily,\r\nand their chief claim to distinction is a genuine or pretended knowledge\r\nof life on a large scale. Greatness is to them inseparably connected\r\nwith crowdedness, and what they call sophistication is at bottom nothing\r\nbut a wallowing in that herd instinct which takes the place of mankind\'s\r\nancient antagonist in Hamsun\'s books. Above all, their standards of\r\njudgment are not their own.\r\n\r\nFrom what has just been said one might conclude that the spirit of\r\nHamsun is fundamentally unsocial. So it is, in a way, but only in so far\r\nas we have come to think of social and urban as more or less\r\ninterchangeable terms. He has a social consciousness and a social\r\npassion of his own, but it is decentralized, one might say. He knows of\r\nno greater man than his own Isak of "Growth of the Soil"--a simple\r\npioneer in whose wake new homes spring up, an inarticulate and uncouth\r\npersonification of man\'s mastery of nature. When Hamsun speaks of Isak\r\npassing across the yearning, spring-stirred fields, "with the grain\r\nflung in fructifying waves from his reverent hands," he pictures it\r\ndeliberately in the light of a religious rite--the oldest and most\r\nsignificant known to man. It is as if the man who starved in\r\nChristiania and the western cities of the United States--not\r\nfiguratively, but literally--had once for all conceived a respect for\r\nman\'s principal food that has colored all subsequent life for him and\r\ndetermined his own attitude toward everything by a reference to its\r\nconnection or lack of connection with that substance.\r\n\r\nTaking it all in all, one may well call Hamsun old-fashioned. The\r\nvirtues winning his praise and the conditions that stir his longings are\r\nnot of the present day. There is in him something primitive that forms a\r\nsharp contrast to the modernity of his own style. Even in his most\r\nromantic exaggerations, as in "Hunger" and "Mysteries," he is a realist,\r\ndealing unrelentingly with life as it appears to us. It would hardly be\r\ntoo much to call his method scientific. But he uses it to aim tremendous\r\nexplosive charges at those human concentrations that made possible the\r\nforging of the weapons he wields so skilfully. Nor does he stop at a\r\nwish to see those concentrations scattered. The very ambitions and\r\nUtopias bred within them are anathema to his soul, that places\r\nsimplicity above cleanliness in divine proximity. Characteristically we\r\nfind that the one art treated with constant sympathy in his writings is\r\nthat of music, which probably is the earliest and certainly the one\r\nleast dependent on the herding of men in barracks. In place of what he\r\nwishes to take away he offers nothing but peace and the sense of genuine\r\ncreation that comes to the man who has just garnered the harvests of his\r\nown fields into his bulging barns. He is a prophet of plenty, but he has\r\nno answer ready when we ask him what we are going to do with it after we\r\nhave got it. Like a true son of the brooding North, he wishes to set us\r\nthinking, but he has no final solutions to offer.\r\n\r\nEDWIN BJOeRKMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThese last few days I have been thinking and thinking of the Nordland\r\nsummer, with its endless day. Sitting here thinking of that, and of a\r\nhut I lived in, and of the woods behind the hut. And writing things\r\ndown, by way of passing the time; to amuse myself, no more. The time\r\ngoes very slowly; I cannot get it to pass as quickly as I would, though\r\nI have nothing to sorrow for, and live as pleasantly as could be. I am\r\nwell content withal, and my thirty years are no age to speak of.\r\n\r\nA few days back someone sent me two feathers. Two bird\'s feathers in a\r\nsheet of note-paper with a coronet, and fastened with a seal. Sent from\r\na place a long way off; from one who need not have sent them back at\r\nall. That amused me too, those devilish green feathers.\r\n\r\nAnd for the rest I have no troubles, unless for a touch of gout now and\r\nagain in my left foot, from an old bullet-wound, healed long since.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, I remember, the time passed quickly--beyond all\r\ncomparison more quickly than time now. A summer was gone before I knew.\r\nTwo years ago it was, in 1855. I will write of it just to amuse\r\nmyself--of something that happened to me, or something I dreamed. Now, I\r\nhave forgotten many things belonging to that time, by having scarcely\r\nthought of them since. But I remember that the nights were very light.\r\nAnd many things seemed curious and unnatural. Twelve months to the\r\nyear--but night was like day, and never a star to be seen in the sky.\r\nAnd the people I met were strange, and of a different nature from those\r\nI had known before; sometimes a single night was enough to make them\r\nblossom out from childhood into the full of their glory, ripe and fully\r\ngrown. No witchery in this; only I had never seen the like before. No.\r\n\r\nIn a white, roomy home down by the sea I met with one who busied my\r\nthoughts for a little time. I do not always think of her now; not any\r\nmore. No; I have forgotten her. But I think of all the other things: the\r\ncry of the sea-birds, my hunting in the woods, my nights, and all the\r\nwarm hours of that summer. After all, it was only by the merest accident\r\nI happened to meet her; save for that, she would never have been in my\r\nthoughts for a day.\r\n\r\nFrom the hut where I lived, I could see a confusion of rocks and reefs\r\nand islets, and a little of the sea, and a bluish mountain peak or so;\r\nbehind the hut was the forest. A huge forest it was; and I was glad and\r\ngrateful beyond measure for the scent of roots and leaves, the thick\r\nsmell of the fir-sap, that is like the smell of marrow. Only the forest\r\ncould bring all things to calm within me; my mind was strong and at\r\nease. Day after day I tramped over the wooded hills with AEsop at my\r\nside, and asked no more than leave to keep on going there day after day,\r\nthough most of the ground was covered still with snow and soft slush. I\r\nhad no company but AEsop; now it is Cora, but at that time it was AEsop,\r\nmy dog that I afterwards shot.\r\n\r\nOften in the evening, when I came back to the hut after being out\r\nshooting all day, I could feel that kindly, homely feeling trickling\r\nthrough me from head to foot--a pleasant little inward shivering. And I\r\nwould talk to AEsop about it, saying how comfortable we were. "There, now\r\nwe\'ll get a fire going, and roast a bird on the hearth," I would say;\r\n"what do you say to that?" And when it was done, and we had both fed,\r\nAEsop would slip away to his place behind the hearth, while I lit a pipe\r\nand lay down on the bench for a while, listening to the dead soughing of\r\nthe trees. There was a slight breeze bearing down towards the hut, and I\r\ncould hear quite clearly the clutter of a grouse far away on the ridge\r\nbehind. Save for that, all was still.\r\n\r\nAnd many a time I fell asleep there as I lay, just as I was, fully\r\ndressed and all, and did not wake till the seabirds began calling. And\r\nthen, looking out of the window, I could see the big white buildings of\r\nthe trading station, the landing stage at Girilund, the store where I\r\nused to get my bread. And I would lie there a while, wondering how I\r\ncame to be there, in a hut on the fringe of a forest, away up in\r\nNordland.\r\n\r\nThen AEsop over by the hearth would shake out his long, slender body,\r\nrattling his collar, and yawning and wagging his tail, and I would jump\r\nup, after those three or four hours of sleep, fully rested and full of\r\njoy in everything ... everything.\r\n\r\nMany a night passed just that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nRain and storm--\'tis not such things that count. Many a time some little\r\njoy can come along on a rainy day, and make a man turn off somewhere to\r\nbe alone with his happiness--stand up somewhere and look out straight\r\nahead, laughing quietly now and again, and looking round. What is there\r\nto think of? One clear pane in a window, a ray of sunlight in the pane,\r\nthe sight of a little brook, or maybe a blue strip of sky between the\r\nclouds. It needs no more than that.\r\n\r\nAt other times, even quite unusual happenings cannot avail to lift a man\r\nfrom dulness and poverty of mind; one can sit in the middle of a\r\nballroom and be cool, indifferent, unaffected by anything. Sorrow and\r\njoy are from within oneself.\r\n\r\nOne day I remember now. I had gone down to the coast. The rain came on\r\nsuddenly, and I slipped into an open boathouse to sit down for a while.\r\nI was humming a little, but not for any joy or pleasure, only to pass\r\nthe time. AEsop was with me; he sat up listening, and I stopped humming\r\nand listened as well. Voices outside; people coming nearer. A mere\r\nchance--nothing more natural. A little party, two men and a girl, came\r\ntumbling in suddenly to where I sat, calling to one another and\r\nlaughing:\r\n\r\n"Quick! Get in here till it stops!"\r\n\r\nI got up.\r\n\r\nOne of the men had a white shirt front, soft, and now soaked with rain\r\ninto the bargain, and all bagging down; and in that wet shirt front a\r\ndiamond clasp. Long, pointed shoes he wore, too, that looked somewhat\r\naffected. I gave him good-day. It was Mack, the trader; I knew him\r\nbecause he was from the store where I used to get my bread. He had asked\r\nme to look in at the house any time, but I had not been there yet.\r\n\r\n"Aha, it\'s you, is it?" said Mack at sight of me. "We were going up to\r\nthe mill, but had to turn back. Ever see such weather--what? And when\r\nare you coming up to see us at Sirilund, Lieutenant?"\r\n\r\nHe introduced the little black-bearded man who was with him; a doctor,\r\nstaying down near the church.\r\n\r\nThe girl lifted her veil the least little bit, to her nose, and started\r\ntalking to AEsop in a whisper. I noticed her jacket; I could see from\r\nthe lining and the buttonholes that it had been dyed. Mack introduced me\r\nto her as well; his daughter, Edwarda.\r\n\r\nEdwarda gave me one glance through her veil, and went on whispering to\r\nthe dog, and reading on its collar:\r\n\r\n"So you\'re called AEsop, are you? Doctor, who was AEsop? All I can\r\nremember is that he wrote fables. Wasn\'t he a Phrygian? I can\'t\r\nremember."\r\n\r\nA child, a schoolgirl. I looked at her--she was tall, but with no figure\r\nto speak of, about fifteen or sixteen, with long, dark hands and no\r\ngloves. Like as not she had looked up AEsop in the dictionary that\r\nafternoon, to have it ready.\r\n\r\nMack asked me what sport I was having. What did I shoot mostly? I could\r\nhave one of his boats at any time if I wanted--only let him know. The\r\nDoctor said nothing at all. When they went off again, I noticed that the\r\nDoctor limped a little, and walked with a stick.\r\n\r\nI walked home as empty in mind as before, humming all indifferently.\r\nThat meeting in the boathouse had made no difference either way to me;\r\nthe one thing I remembered best of all was Mack\'s wet shirt front, with\r\na diamond clasp--the diamond all wet, too, and no great brilliance about\r\nit, either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a stone outside my hut, a tall grey stone. It looked as if it\r\nhad a sort of friendly feeling towards me; as if it noticed me when I\r\ncame by, and knew me again. I liked to go round that way past the\r\nstone, when I went out in the morning; it was like leaving a good friend\r\nthere, who I knew would be still waiting for me when I came back.\r\n\r\nThen up in the woods hunting, sometimes finding game, sometimes none...\r\n\r\nOut beyond the islands, the sea lay heavily calm. Many a time I have\r\nstood and looked at it from the hills, far up above. On a calm day, the\r\nships seemed hardly to move at all; I could see the same sail for three\r\ndays, small and white, like a gull on the water. Then, perhaps, if the\r\nwind veered round, the peaks in the distance would almost disappear, and\r\nthere came a storm, the south-westerly gale; a play for me to stand and\r\nwatch. All things in a seething mist. Earth and sky mingled together,\r\nthe sea flung up into fantastic dancing figures of men and horses and\r\nfluttering banners on the air. I stood in the shelter of an overhanging\r\nrock, thinking many things; my soul was tense. Heaven knows, I thought\r\nto myself, what it is I am watching here, and why the sea should open\r\nbefore my eyes. Maybe I am seeing now the inner brain of earth, how\r\nthings are at work there, boiling and foaming. AEsop was restless; now\r\nand again he would thrust up his muzzle and sniff, in a troubled way,\r\nwith legs quivering uneasily; when I took no notice, he lay down between\r\nmy feet and stared out to sea as I was doing. And never a cry, never a\r\nword of human voice to be heard anywhere; nothing; only the heavy rush\r\nof the wind about my head. There was a reef of rocks far out, lying all\r\napart; when the sea raged up over it the water towered like a crazy\r\nscrew; nay, like a sea-god rising wet in the air, and snorting, till\r\nhair and beard stood out like a wheel about his head. Then he plunged\r\ndown into the breakers once more.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of the storm, a little coal-black steamer fighting its\r\nway in...\r\n\r\nWhen I went down to the quay in the afternoon, the little coal-black\r\nsteamer had come in; it was the mail-packet. Many people had gathered on\r\nthe quayside to see the rare visitor; I noticed that all without\r\nexception had blue eyes, however different they might be in other ways.\r\nA young girl with a white woolen kerchief over her head stood a little\r\napart; she had very dark hair, and the white kerchief showed up\r\nstrangely against it. She looked at me curiously, at my leather suit, my\r\ngun; when I spoke to her, she was embarrassed, and turned her head away.\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n"You should always wear a white kerchief like that; it suits you well."\r\n\r\nJust then a burly man in an Iceland jersey came up and joined her; he\r\ncalled her Eva. Evidently she was his daughter. I knew the burly man; he\r\nwas the local smith, the blacksmith. Only a few days back he had mended\r\nthe nipple of one of my guns...\r\n\r\nAnd rain and wind did their work, and thawed away the snow. For some\r\ndays a cheerless cold hovered over the earth; rotten branches snapped,\r\nand the crows gathered in flocks, complaining. But it was not for long;\r\nthe sun was near, and one day it rose up behind the forest.\r\n\r\nIt sends a strip of sweetness through me from head to foot when the sun\r\ncomes up; I shoulder my gun with quiet delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nI was never short of game those days, but shot all I cared to--a hare, a\r\ngrouse, a ptarmigan--and when I happened to be down near the shore and\r\ncame within range of some seabird or other, I shot it too. It was a\r\npleasant time; the days grew longer and the air clearer; I packed up\r\nthings for a couple of days and set off up into the hills, up to the\r\nmountain peaks. I met reindeer Lapps, and they gave me cheese--rich\r\nlittle cheeses tasting of herbs. I went up that way more than once.\r\nThen, going home again, I always shot some bird or other to put in my\r\nbag. I sat down and put AEsop on the lead. Miles below me was the sea;\r\nthe mountainsides were wet and black with the water running down them,\r\ndripping and trickling always with the same little sound. That little\r\nsound of the water far up on the hills has shortened many an hour for me\r\nwhen I sat looking about. Here, I thought to myself, is a little endless\r\nsong trickling away all to itself, and no one ever hears it, and no one\r\never thinks of it, and still it trickles on nevertheless, to itself, all\r\nthe time, all the time! And I felt that the mountains were no longer\r\nquite deserted, as long as I could hear that little trickling song. Now\r\nand again something would happen: a clap of thunder shaking the earth, a\r\nmass of rock slipping loose and rushing down towards the sea, leaving a\r\ntrail of smoking dust behind. AEsop turned his nose to the wind at once,\r\nsniffing in surprise at the smell of burning that he could not\r\nunderstand. When the melting of the snow had made rifts in the hillside,\r\na shot, or even a sharp cry, was enough to loosen a great block and send\r\nit tumbling down...\r\n\r\nAn hour might pass, or perhaps more--the time went so quickly. I let\r\nAEsop loose, slung my bag over the other shoulder, and set off towards\r\nhome. It was getting late. Lower down in the forest, I came unfailingly\r\nupon my old, well-known path, a narrow ribbon of a path, with the\r\nstrangest bends and turns. I followed each one of them, taking my\r\ntime--there was no hurry. No one waiting for me at home. Free as a\r\nlord, a ruler, I could ramble about there in the peaceful woods, just as\r\nidly as I pleased. All the birds were silent; only the grouse was\r\ncalling far away--it was always calling.\r\n\r\nI came out of the wood and saw two figures ahead, two persons moving. I\r\ncame up with them. One was Edwarda, and I recognized her, and gave a\r\ngreeting; the Doctor was with her. I had to show them my gun; they\r\nlooked at my compass, my bag; I invited them to my hut, and they\r\npromised to come some day.\r\n\r\nIt was evening now. I went home and lit a fire, roasted a bird, and had\r\na meal. To-morrow there would be another day...\r\n\r\nAll things quiet and still. I lay that evening looking out the window.\r\nThere was a fairy glimmer at that hour over wood and field; the sun had\r\ngone down, and dyed the horizon with a rich red light that stood there\r\nstill as oil. The sky all open and clean; I stared into that clear sea,\r\nand it seemed as if I were lying face to face with the uttermost depth\r\nof the world; my heart beating tensely against it, and at home there.\r\nGod knows, I thought to myself, God knows why the sky is dressed in gold\r\nand mauve to-night, if there is not some festival going on up there in\r\nthe world, some great feast with music from the stars, and boats gliding\r\nalong river ways. It looks so!--And I closed my eyes, and followed the\r\nboats, and thoughts and thoughts floated through my mind...\r\n\r\nSo more than one day passed.\r\n\r\nI wandered about, noting how the snow turned to water, how the ice\r\nloosed its hold. Many a day I did not even fire a shot, when I had food\r\nenough in the hut--only wandered about in my freedom, and let the time\r\npass. Whichever way I turned, there was always just as much to see\r\nand hear--all things changing a little every day. Even the osier\r\nthickets and the juniper stood waiting for the spring. One day I went\r\nout to the mill; it was still icebound, but the earth around it had been\r\ntrampled through many and many a year, showing how men and more men had\r\ncome that way with sacks of corn on their shoulders, to be ground. It\r\nwas like walking among human beings to go there; and there were many\r\ndates and letters cut in the walls.\r\n\r\nWell, well...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nShall I write more? No, no. Only a little for my own amusement\'s sake,\r\nand because it passes the time for me to tell of how the spring came two\r\nyears back, and how everything looked then. Earth and sea began to smell\r\na little; there was a sweetish, rotting smell from the dead leaves in\r\nthe wood, and the magpies flew with twigs in their beaks, building their\r\nnests. A couple of days more, and the brooks began to swell and foam;\r\nhere and there a butterfly was to be seen, and the fishermen came home\r\nfrom their stations. The trader\'s two boats came in laden deep with\r\nfish, and anchored off the drying grounds; there was life and commotion\r\nall of a sudden out on the biggest of the islands, where the fish were\r\nto be spread on the rocks to dry. I could see it all from my window.\r\n\r\nBut no noise reached the hut; I was alone, and remained so. Now and\r\nagain someone would pass. I saw Eva, the blacksmith\'s girl; she had got\r\na couple of freckles on her nose.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Out for firewood," she answered quietly. She had a rope in her hand to\r\ncarry the wood, and her white kerchief on her head. I stood watching\r\nher, but she did not turn round.\r\n\r\nAfter that I saw no one for days.\r\n\r\nThe spring was urging, and the forest listened; it was a great delight\r\nto watch the thrushes sitting in the tree-tops staring at the sun and\r\ncrying; sometimes I would get up as early as two in the morning, just\r\nfor a share of the joy that went out from bird and beast at sunrise.\r\n\r\nThe spring had reached me too, maybe, and my blood beat at times as if\r\nit were footsteps. I sat in the hut, and thought of overhauling my\r\nfishing rods and lines and gear, but moved never a finger to any work at\r\nall, for a glad, mysterious restlessness that was in and out of my heart\r\nall the while. Then suddenly AEsop sprang up, stood and stiffened, and\r\ngave a short bark. Someone coming to the hut! I pulled off my cap\r\nquickly, and heard Edwarda\'s voice already at the door. Kindly and\r\nwithout ceremony she and the Doctor had come to pay me a visit, as they\r\nhad said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I heard her say, "he is at home." And she stepped forward, and\r\ngave me her hand in her simple girlish way. "We were here yesterday, but\r\nyou were out," she said.\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the rug over my wooden bedstead and looked round the\r\nhut; the Doctor sat down beside me on the long bench. We talked, chatted\r\naway at ease; I told them things, such as what kinds of animals there\r\nwere in the woods, and what game I could not shoot because of the closed\r\nseason. It was the closed season for grouse just now.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor did not say much this time either, but catching sight of my\r\npowder-horn, with a figure of Pan carved on it, he started to explain\r\nthe myth of Pan.\r\n\r\n"But," said Edwarda suddenly, "what do you live on when it\'s closed\r\nseason for all game?"\r\n\r\n"Fish," I said. "Fish mostly. But there\'s always something to eat."\r\n\r\n"But you might come up to us for your meals," she said. "There was an\r\nEnglishman here last year--he had taken the hut--and he often came to us\r\nfor meals."\r\n\r\nEdwarda looked at me and I at her. I felt at the moment something\r\ntouching my heart like a little fleeting welcome. It must have been the\r\nspring, and the bright day; I have thought it over since. Also, I\r\nadmired the curve of her eyebrows.\r\n\r\nShe said something about my place; how I had arranged things in the hut.\r\nI had hung up skins of several sorts on the walls, and birds\' wings; it\r\nlooked like a shaggy den on the inside. She liked it. "Yes, a den," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nI had nothing to offer my visitors that they would care about; I thought\r\nof it, and would have roasted a bird for them, just for amusement--let\r\nthem eat it hunter\'s fashion, with their fingers. It might amuse them.\r\n\r\nAnd I cooked the bird.\r\n\r\nEdwarda told about the Englishman. An old man, an eccentric, who talked\r\naloud to himself. He was a Roman Catholic, and always carried a little\r\nprayer-book, with red and black letters, about with him wherever he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n"Was he an Irishman then?" asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"An Irishman...?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--since he was a Roman Catholic."\r\n\r\nEdwarda blushed, and stammered and looked away.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, perhaps he was an Irishman."\r\n\r\nAfter that she lost her liveliness. I felt sorry for her, and tried to\r\nput matters straight again. I said:\r\n\r\n"No, of course you are right: he was an Englishman. Irishmen don\'t go\r\ntravelling about in Norway."\r\n\r\nWe agreed to row over one day and see the fish-drying grounds...\r\n\r\nWhen I had seen my visitors a few steps on their way, I walked home\r\nagain and sat down to work at my fishing gear. My hand-net had been hung\r\nfrom a nail by the door, and several of the meshes were damaged by rust;\r\nI sharpened up some hooks, knotted them to lengths of line, and looked\r\nto the other nets. How hard it seemed to do any work at all to-day!\r\nThoughts that had nothing to do with the business in hand kept coming\r\nand going; it occurred to me that I had done wrong in letting Edwarda\r\nsit on the bed all the time, instead of offering her a seat on the\r\nbench. I saw before me suddenly her brown face and neck; she had\r\nfastened her apron a little low down in front, to be long-waisted, as\r\nwas the fashion; the girlish contour of her thumb affected me tenderly,\r\nand the little wrinkles above the knuckle were full of kindliness. Her\r\nmouth was large and rich.\r\n\r\nI rose up and opened the door and looked out. I could hear nothing, and\r\nindeed there was nothing to listen for. I closed the door again; AEsop\r\ncame up from his resting-place and noticed that I was restless about\r\nsomething. Then it struck me that I might run after Edwarda and ask her\r\nfor a little silk thread to mend my net with. It would not be any\r\npretence--I could take down the net and show her where the meshes were\r\nspoiled by rust. I was already outside the door when I remembered that I\r\nhad silk thread myself in my fly-book; more indeed than I wanted. And I\r\nwent back slowly, discouraged--to think that I had silk thread myself.\r\n\r\nA breath of something strange met me as I entered the hut again; it\r\nseemed as if I were no longer alone there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nA man asked me if I had given up shooting; he had not heard me fire a\r\nshot up in the hills, though he had been out fishing for two days. No, I\r\nhad shot nothing; I had stayed at home in the hut until I had no more\r\nfood in the place.\r\n\r\nOn the third day I went out with my gun. The woods were getting green;\r\nthere was a smell of earth and trees. The young grass was already\r\nspringing up from the frozen moss. I was in a thoughtful mood, and sat\r\ndown several times. For three days I had not seen a soul except the one\r\nfisherman I had met the day before. I thought to myself, "Perhaps I may\r\nmeet someone this evening on the way home, at the edge of the wood,\r\nwhere I met the Doctor and Edwarda before. Perhaps they may be going\r\nfor a walk that way again--perhaps, perhaps not." But why should I think\r\nof those two in particular? I shot a couple of ptarmigan, and cooked one\r\nof them at once; then I tied up the dog.\r\n\r\nI lay down on the dry ground to eat. The earth was quiet--only a little\r\nbreath of wind and the sound of a bird here and there. I lay and watched\r\nthe branches waving gently in the breeze; the little wind was at its\r\nwork, carrying pollen from branch to branch and filling every innocent\r\nbloom; all the forest seemed filled with delight. A green worm thing, a\r\ncaterpillar, dragged itself end by end along a branch, dragging along\r\nunceasingly, as if it could not rest. It saw hardly anything, for all it\r\nhad eyes; often it stood straight up in the air, feeling about for\r\nsomething to take hold of; it looked like a stump of green thread sewing\r\na seam with long stitches along the branch. By evening, perhaps, it\r\nwould have reached its goal.\r\n\r\nQuiet as ever. I get up and move on, sit down and get up again. It is\r\nabout four o\'clock; about six I can start for home, and see if I happen\r\nto meet anyone. Two hours to wait; a little restless already, I brush\r\nthe dust and heather from my clothes. I know the places I pass by, trees\r\nand stones stand there as before in their solitude; the leaves rustle\r\nunderfoot as I walk. The monotonous breathing and the familiar trees and\r\nstones mean much to me; I am filled with a strange thankfulness;\r\neverything seems well disposed towards me, mingles with my being; I love\r\nit all. I pick up a little dry twig and hold it in my hand and sit\r\nlooking at it, and think my own thoughts; the twig is almost rotten, its\r\npoor bark touches me, pity fills my heart. And when I get up again, I do\r\nnot throw the twig far away, but lay it down, and stand liking it; at\r\nlast I look at it once more with wet eyes before I go away and leave it\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nFive o\'clock. The sun tells me false time today; I have been walking\r\nwestward the whole day, and come perhaps half an hour ahead of my sun\r\nmarks at the hut. I am quite aware of all this, but none the less there\r\nis an hour yet before six o\'clock, so I get up again and go on a little.\r\nAnd the leaves rustle under foot. An hour goes that way.\r\n\r\nI look down at the little stream and the little mill that has been\r\nicebound all the winter, and I stop. The mill is working; the noise of\r\nit wakes me, and I stop suddenly, there and then. "I have stayed out\r\ntoo long," I say aloud. A pang goes through me; I turn at once and begin\r\nwalking homewards, but all the time I know I have stayed out too long. I\r\nwalk faster, then run; AEsop understands there is something the matter,\r\nand pulls at the leash, drags me along, sniffs at the ground, and is all\r\nhaste. The dry leaves crackle about us.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to the edge of the wood there was no one there. No, all\r\nwas quiet; there was no one there.\r\n\r\n"There is no one here," I said to myself. And yet it was no worse than I\r\nhad expected.\r\n\r\nI did not stay long, but walked on, drawn by all my thoughts, passed by\r\nmy hut, and went down to Sirilund with AEsop and my bag and gun--with all\r\nmy belongings.\r\n\r\nHerr Mack received me with the greatest friendliness, and asked me to\r\nstay to supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nI fancy I can read a little in the souls of those about me--but perhaps\r\nit is not so. Oh, when my good days come, I feel as if I could see far\r\ninto others\' souls, though I am no great or clever head. We sit in a\r\nroom, some men, some women, and I, and I seem to see what is passing\r\nwithin them, and what they think of me. I find something in every swift\r\nlittle change of light in their eyes; sometimes the blood rises to their\r\ncheeks and reddens them; at other times they pretend to be looking\r\nanother way, and yet they watch me covertly from the side. There I sit,\r\nmarking all this, and no one dreams that I see through every soul. For\r\nyears past I have felt that I could read the souls of all I met. But\r\nperhaps it is not so...\r\n\r\nI stayed at Herr Mack\'s house all that evening. I might have gone off\r\nagain at once--it did not interest me to stay sitting there--but had I\r\nnot come because all my thoughts were drawing me that way? And how could\r\nI go again at once? We played whist and drank toddy after supper; I sat\r\nwith my back turned to the rest of the room, and my head bent down;\r\nbehind me Edwarda went in and out. The Doctor had gone home.\r\n\r\nHerr Mack showed me the design of his new lamps--the first paraffin\r\nlamps to be seen so far north. They were splendid things, with a heavy\r\nleaden base, and he lit them himself every evening--to prevent any\r\naccident. He spoke once or twice of his grandfather, the Consul.\r\n\r\n"This brooch was given to my grandfather, Consul Mack, by Carl Johan\r\nwith his own hands," he said, pointing one finger at the diamond in his\r\nshirt. His wife was dead; he showed me a painted portrait of her in one\r\nof the other rooms--a distinguished looking woman with a lace cap and a\r\nwinsome smile. In the same room, also, there was a bookcase, and some\r\nold French books, no less, that might have been an heirloom. The\r\nbindings were rich and gilded, and many owners had marked their names in\r\nthem. Among the books were several educational works; Herr Mack was a\r\nman of some intelligence.\r\n\r\nHis two assistants from the store were called in to make up the party at\r\nwhist. They played slowly and doubtfully, counted carefully, and made\r\nmistakes all the same. Edwarda helped one of them with his hand.\r\n\r\nI upset my glass, and felt ashamed, and stood up.\r\n\r\n"There--I have upset my glass," I said.\r\n\r\nEdwarda burst out laughing, and answered:\r\n\r\n"Well, we can see that."\r\n\r\nEveryone assured me laughingly that it did not matter. They gave me a\r\ntowel to wipe myself with, and we went on with the game. Soon it was\r\neleven o\'clock.\r\n\r\nI felt a vague displeasure at Edwarda\'s laugh. I looked at her, and\r\nfound that her face had become insignificant, hardly even pretty. At\r\nlast Herr Mack broke off the game, saying that his assistants must go to\r\nbed; then he leaned back on the sofa and began talking about putting up\r\na sign in front of his place. He asked my advice about it. What colour\r\ndid I think would be best? I was not interested, and answered "black,"\r\nwithout thinking at all. And Herr Mack at once agreed:\r\n\r\n"Black, yes--exactly what I had been thinking myself. \'Salt and barrels\'\r\nin heavy black letters--that ought to look as nice as anything...\r\nEdwarda, isn\'t it time you were going to bed?"\r\n\r\nEdwarda rose, shook hands with us both, said good-night, and left the\r\nroom. We sat on. We talked of the railway that had been finished last\r\nyear, and of the first telegraph line. "Wonder when we shall have the\r\ntelegraph up here."\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"It\'s like this," said Herr Mack. "Time goes on, and here am I,\r\nsix-and-forty, and hair and beard gone grey. You might see me in the\r\ndaytime and say I was a young man, but when the evening comes along, and\r\nI\'m all alone, I feel it a good deal. I sit here mostly playing\r\npatience. It works out all right as a rule, if you fudge a little.\r\nHaha!"\r\n\r\n"If you fudge a little?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nI felt as if I could read in his eyes...\r\n\r\nHe got up from his seat, walked over to the window, and looked out; he\r\nstooped a little, and the back of his neck was hairy. I rose in my turn.\r\nHe looked round and walked towards me in his long, pointed shoes, stuck\r\nboth thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, waved his arms a little, as if\r\nthey were wings, and smiled. Then he offered me his boat again if ever I\r\nwanted one, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute--I\'ll go with you," he said, and blew out the lamps.\r\n"Yes, yes, I feel like a little walk. It\'s not so late."\r\n\r\nWe went out.\r\n\r\nHe pointed up the road towards the blacksmith\'s and said:\r\n\r\n"This way--it\'s the shortest."\r\n\r\n"No," I said. "Round by the quay is the shortest way."\r\n\r\nWe argued the point a little, and did not agree. I was convinced that I\r\nwas right, and could not understand why he insisted. At last he\r\nsuggested that we should each go his own way; the one who got there\r\nfirst could wait at the hut.\r\n\r\nWe set off, and he was soon lost to sight in the wood.\r\n\r\nI walked at my usual pace, and reckoned to be there a good five minutes\r\nahead. But when I got to the hut he was there already. He called out as\r\nI came up:\r\n\r\n"What did I say? I always go this way--it _is_ the shortest."\r\n\r\nI looked at him in surprise; he was not heated, and did not appear to\r\nhave been running. He did not stay now, but said good-night in a\r\nfriendly way, and went back the way he had come.\r\n\r\nI stood there and thought to myself: This is strange! I ought to be some\r\njudge of distance, and I\'ve walked both those ways several times. My\r\ngood man, you\'ve been fudging again. Was the whole thing a pretence?\r\n\r\nI saw his back as he disappeared into the wood again.\r\n\r\nNext moment I started off in track of him, going quickly and cautiously;\r\nI could see him wiping his face all the way, and I was not so sure now\r\nthat he had not been running before. I walked very slowly now, and\r\nwatched him carefully; he stopped at the blacksmith\'s. I stepped into\r\nhiding, and saw the door open, and Herr Mack enter the house.\r\n\r\nIt was one o\'clock; I could tell by the look of the sea and the grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days passed as best they could; my only friend was the forest and\r\nthe great loneliness. Dear God! I had never before known what it was to\r\nbe so alone as on the first of those days. It was full spring now; I had\r\nfound wintergreen and milfoil already, and the chaffinches had come (I\r\nknew all the birds). Now and again I took a couple of coins from my\r\npocket and rattled them, to break the loneliness. I thought to myself:\r\n"What if Diderik and Iselin were to appear!"\r\n\r\nNight was coming on again; the sun just dipped into the sea and rose\r\nagain, red, refreshed, as if it had been down to drink. I could feel\r\nmore strangely on those nights than anyone would believe. Was Pan\r\nhimself there, sitting in a tree, watching me to see what I might do?\r\nWas his belly open, and he sitting there bent over as if drinking from\r\nhis own belly? But all that he did only that he might look up under his\r\nbrows and watch me; and the whole tree shook with his silent laughter\r\nwhen he saw how all my thoughts were running away with me. There was a\r\nrustling everywhere in the woods, beasts sniffing, birds calling one to\r\nanother; their signals filled the air. And it was flying year for the\r\nMaybug; its humming mingled with the buzz of the night moths, sounded\r\nlike a whispering here and a whispering there, all about in the woods.\r\nSo much there was to hear! For three nights I did not sleep; I thought\r\nof Diderik and Iselin.\r\n\r\n"See now," I thought, "they might come." And Iselin would lead Diderik\r\naway to a tree and say:\r\n\r\n"Stand here, Diderik, and keep guard; keep watch; I will let this\r\nhuntsman tie my shoestring."\r\n\r\nAnd the huntsman is myself, and she will give me a glance of her eyes\r\nthat I may understand. And when she comes, my heart knows all, and no\r\nlonger beats like a heart, but rings as a bell. I lay my hand on her.\r\n\r\n"Tie my shoe-string," she says, with flushed cheeks. ...\r\n\r\nThe sun dips down into the sea and rises again, red and refreshed, as if\r\nit had been to drink. And the air is full of whisperings.\r\n\r\nAn hour after, she speaks, close to my mouth:\r\n\r\n"Now I must leave you."\r\n\r\nAnd she turns and waves her hand to me as she goes, and her face is\r\nflushed still; her face is tender and full of delight. And again she\r\nturns and waves to me.\r\n\r\nBut Diderik steps out from under the tree and says:\r\n\r\n"Iselin, what have you done? I saw you."\r\n\r\nShe answers:\r\n\r\n"Diderik, what did you see? I have done nothing."\r\n\r\n"Iselin, I saw what you did," he says again; "I saw you."\r\n\r\nAnd then her rich, glad laughter rings through the wood, and she goes\r\noff with him, full of rejoicing from top to toe. And whither does she\r\ngo? To the next mortal man; to a huntsman in the woods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was midnight. AEsop had broken loose and been out hunting by himself;\r\nI heard him baying up in the hills, and when at last I got him back it\r\nwas one o\'clock. A girl came from herding goats; she fastened her\r\nstocking and hummed a tune and looked around. But where was her flock?\r\nAnd what was she doing in the woods at midnight? Ah, nothing, nothing.\r\nWalking there for restlessness, perhaps, for joy; \'twas her affair. I\r\nthought to myself, she had heard AEsop in the woods, and knew that I was\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAs she came up I rose and stood and looked at her, and I saw how slight\r\nand young she was. AEsop, too, stood looking at her.\r\n\r\n"Where do you come from?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"From the mill," she answered.\r\n\r\nBut what could she have been doing at the mill so late at night?\r\n\r\n"How can you venture into the woods so late?" I said--"you so slight and\r\nyoung?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n"I am not so young--I am nineteen."\r\n\r\nBut she could not be nineteen; I am certain she was lying by at least\r\ntwo years, and was only seventeen. But why should she lie to seem older?\r\n\r\n"Sit down," I said, "and tell me your name."\r\n\r\nAnd she sat down, blushing, by my side, and told me her name was\r\nHenriette.\r\n\r\nThen I asked her:\r\n\r\n"Have you a lover, Henriette, and has he ever taken you in his arms?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, smiling shyly.\r\n\r\n"How many times?"\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n"How many times?" I asked her again.\r\n\r\n"Twice," she answered softly.\r\n\r\nI drew her to me and said:\r\n\r\n"How did he do it? Was it like this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she whispered, trembling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nI had some talk with Edwarda.\r\n\r\n"We shall have rain before long," I said.\r\n\r\n"What time is it?" she asked.\r\n\r\nI looked at the sun and answered:\r\n\r\n"About five."\r\n\r\nShe asked:\r\n\r\n"Can you tell so nearly by the sun?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I answered; "I can."\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"But when you can\'t see the sun, how do you tell the time then?"\r\n\r\n"Then I can tell by other things. There\'s high tide and low tide, and\r\nthe grass that lies over at certain hours, and the song of the birds\r\nthat changes; some birds begin to sing when others leave off. Then, I\r\ncan tell the time by flowers that close in the afternoon, and leaves\r\nthat are bright green at some times and dull green at others--and then,\r\nbesides, I can feel it."\r\n\r\n"I see."\r\n\r\nNow I was expecting rain, and for Edwarda\'s sake I would not keep her\r\nthere any longer on the road; I raised my cap. But she stopped me\r\nsuddenly with a new question, and I stayed. She blushed, and asked me\r\nwhy I had come to the place at all? Why I went out shooting, and why\r\nthis and why that? For I never shot more than I needed for food, and\r\nleft my dog idle...\r\n\r\nShe looked flushed and humble. I understood that someone had been\r\ntalking about me, and she had heard it; she was not speaking for\r\nherself. And something about her called up a feeling of tenderness in\r\nme; she looked so helpless, I remembered that she had no mother; her\r\nthin arms gave her an ill-cared-for appearance. I could not help feeling\r\nit so.\r\n\r\nWell, I did not go out shooting just to murder things, but to live. I\r\nhad need of one grouse to-day, and so I did not shoot two, but would\r\nshoot the other to-morrow. Why kill more? I lived in the woods, as a son\r\nof the woods. And from the first of June it was closed time for hare and\r\nptarmigan; there was but little left for me to shoot at all now. Well\r\nand good: then I could go fishing, and live on fish. I would borrow her\r\nfather\'s boat and row out in that. No, indeed, I did no go out shooting\r\nfor the lust of killing things, but only to live in the woods. It was a\r\ngood place for me; I could lie down on the ground at meals, instead of\r\nsitting upright on a chair; I did not upset my glass there. In the woods\r\nI could do as I pleased; I could lie down flat on my back and close my\r\neyes if I pleased, and I could say whatever I liked to say. Often one\r\nmight feel a wish to say something, to speak aloud, and in the woods it\r\nsounded like speech from the very heart...\r\n\r\nWhen I asked her if she understood all this, she said, "Yes."\r\n\r\nAnd I went on, and told her more, because her eyes were on me. "If you\r\nonly knew all that I see out in the wilds!" I said. "In winter, I come\r\nwalking along, and see, perhaps, the tracks of ptarmigan in the snow.\r\nSuddenly the track disappears; the bird has taken wing. But from the\r\nmarks of the wings I can see which way the game has flown, and before\r\nlong I have tracked it down again. There is always a touch of newness in\r\nthat for me. In autumn, many a time there are shooting stars to watch.\r\nThen I think to myself, being all alone, What was that? A world seized\r\nwith convulsions all of a sudden? A world going all to pieces before my\r\neyes? To think that I--that _I_ should be granted the sight of shooting\r\nstars in my life! And when summer comes, then perhaps there may be a\r\nlittle living creature on every leaf; I can see that some of them have\r\nno wings; they can make no great way in the world, but must live and die\r\non that one little leaf where they came into the world.\r\n\r\n"Then sometimes I see the blue flies. But it all seems such a little\r\nthing to talk about--I don\'t know if you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I understand."\r\n\r\n"Good. Well, then sometimes I look at the grass, and perhaps the grass\r\nis looking at me again--who can say? I look at a single blade of grass;\r\nit quivers a little, maybe, and thinks me something. And I think to\r\nmyself: Here is a little blade of grass all a-quivering. Or if it\r\nhappens to be a fir tree I look at, then maybe the tree has one branch\r\nthat makes me think of it a little, too. And sometimes I meet people up\r\non the moors; it happens at times."\r\n\r\nI looked at her; she stood bending forward, listening. I hardly knew\r\nher. So lost in attention she was that she took no heed of herself, but\r\nwas ugly, foolish looking; her underlip hung far down.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," she said, and drew herself up.\r\n\r\nThe first drops of rain began to fall.\r\n\r\n"It is raining," said I.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Yes, it is raining," she said, and went away on the instant.\r\n\r\nI did not see her home; she went on her way alone; I hurried up to the\r\nhut. A few minutes passed. It began to rain heavily. Suddenly I heard\r\nsomeone running after me. I stopped short, and there was Edwarda.\r\n\r\n"I forgot," she said breathlessly. "We were going over to the\r\nislands--the drying grounds, you know. The Doctor is coming to-morrow;\r\nwill you have time then?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow? Yes, indeed. I shall have time enough."\r\n\r\n"I forgot it," she said again, and smiled.\r\n\r\nAs she went, I noticed her thin, pretty calves; they were wet far above\r\nthe ankle. Her shoes were worn through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was another day which I remember well. It was the day my summer\r\ncame. The sun began shining while it was still night, and dried up the\r\nwet ground for the morning. The air was soft and fine after the last\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I went down to the quay. The water was perfectly\r\nstill; we could hear talking and laughter away over at the island, where\r\nmen and girls were at work on the fish. It was a happy afternoon.\r\n\r\nAy, was it not a happy afternoon? We took hampers of food and wine with\r\nus; a big party we were, in two boats, with young women in light\r\ndresses. I was so happy that I hummed a tune.\r\n\r\nAnd when we were in the boat, I fell to thinking where all these young\r\npeople came from. There were the daughters of the Lensmand and the\r\ndistrict surgeon, a governess or so, and the ladies from the vicarage. I\r\nhad not seen them before; they were strangers to me; and yet, for all\r\nthat, they were as friendly as if we had known each other for years. I\r\nmade some mistakes! I had grown unaccustomed to being in society, and\r\noften said "Du" [Footnote: "Du"=thou, the familiar form of address\r\n(tutoyer), instead of "De"=you.] to the young ladies, but they did not\r\nseem offended. And once I said "dear," or "my dear," but they forgave me\r\nthat as well, and took no notice of it.\r\n\r\nHerr Mack had his unstarched shirt front on as usual, with the diamond\r\nstud. He seemed in excellent spirits, and called across to the other\r\nboat:\r\n\r\n"Hi, look after the hamper with the bottles, you madcaps there. Doctor,\r\nI shall hold you responsible for the wine."\r\n\r\n"Right!" cried the Doctor. And just those few words from one boat to\r\nanother seemed to me pleasant and merry to hear.\r\n\r\nEdwarda was wearing the same dress she had, worn the day before, as if\r\nshe had no other or did not care to put on another. Her shoes, too, were\r\nthe same. I fancied her hands were not quite clean; but she wore a brand\r\nnew hat, with feathers. She had taken her dyed jacket with her, and used\r\nit to sit on.\r\n\r\nAt Herr Mack\'s request I fired a shot just as we were about to land, in\r\nfact, two shots, both barrels--and they cheered. We rambled up over the\r\nisland, the workers greeted us all, and Herr Mack stopped to speak to\r\nhis folk. We found daisies and corn marigolds and put them in our\r\nbutton-holes; some found harebells.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a host of seabirds chattering and screaming, in the air\r\nand on the shore.\r\n\r\nWe camped out on a patch of grass where there were a few stunted birches\r\nwith white stems. The hampers were opened, and Herr Mack saw to the\r\nbottles. Light dresses, blue eyes, the ring of glasses, the sea, the\r\nwhite sails. And we sang a little.\r\n\r\nAnd cheeks were flushed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later, my whole being was joy; even little things affected me. A\r\nveil fluttering from a hat, a girl\'s hair coming down, a pair of eyes\r\nclosing in a laugh--and it touched me. That day, that day!\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard you\'ve such a queer little hut up there, Lieutenant?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a nest. And the very thing for me. Come and see me there one day;\r\nthere\'s no such hut anywhere else. And the great forest behind it."\r\n\r\nAnother came up and said kindly:\r\n\r\n"You have not been up here in the north before?"\r\n\r\n"No," I answered. "But I know all about it already, ladies. At night I\r\nam face to face with the mountains, the earth, and the sun. But I will\r\nnot try to use fine words. What a summer you have here! It bursts forth\r\none night when everyone is asleep, and in the morning there it is. I\r\nlooked out of my window and saw it myself. I have two little windows."\r\n\r\nA third came up. She was charming by reason of her voice and her small\r\nhands. How charming they all were! This one said:\r\n\r\n"Shall we change flowers? It brings luck, they say."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I answered, holding out my hand, "let us change flowers, and I\r\nthank you for it. How pretty you are! You have a lovely voice; I have\r\nbeen listening to it all the time."\r\n\r\nBut she drew back her harebells and said curtly:\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking about? It was not you I meant."\r\n\r\nIt was not me she meant! It hurt me to feel that I had been mistaken; I\r\nwished myself at home again, far away in my hut, where only the wind\r\ncould speak to me. "I beg your pardon," I said; "forgive me." The other\r\nladies looked at one another and moved away, so as not to humiliate me.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment someone came quickly over towards us. All could see\r\nher--it was Edwarda. She came straight to me. She said something, and\r\nthrew her arms round my neck; clasped her arms round my neck and kissed\r\nme again and again on the lips. Each time she said something, but I did\r\nnot hear what it was. I could not understand it all; my heart stood\r\nstill; I had only a feeling of her burning look. Then she slipped away\r\nfrom me; her little breast beat up and down. She stood there still, with\r\nher brown face and brown neck, tall and slender, with flashing eyes,\r\naltogether heedless. They were all looking at her. For the second time I\r\nwas fascinated by her dark eyebrows, that curved high up into her\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nBut, Heavens--the girl had kissed me openly in sight of them all!\r\n\r\n"What is it, Edwarda?" I asked, and I could hear my blood beating; hear\r\nit as it were from down in my throat, so that I could not speak\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," she answered. "Only--that I wanted to. It doesn\'t matter."\r\n\r\nI took off my cap and brushed back my hair mechanically as I stood\r\nlooking at her. "Doesn\'t matter...?"\r\n\r\nHerr Mack was saying something, a good way off; we could not hear his\r\nwords from where we were. But I was glad to think that Herr Mack had\r\nseen nothing, that he knew nothing of this. It was well indeed that he\r\nhad been away from the party just then. I felt relieved at that, and I\r\nstepped over to the others and said with a laugh, and seeming quite\r\nindifferent:\r\n\r\n"I would ask you all to forgive my unseemly behavior a moment ago; I am\r\nmyself extremely sorry about it. Edwarda kindly offered to change\r\nflowers with me, and I forgot myself. I beg her pardon and yours. Put\r\nyourself in my place; I live all alone, and am not accustomed to the\r\nsociety of ladies; besides which, I have been drinking wine, and am not\r\nused to that either. You must make allowances for that."\r\n\r\nAnd I laughed, and showed great indifference to such a trifle, that it\r\nmight be forgotten; but, inwardly, I was serious. Moreover, what I had\r\nsaid made no impression on Edwarda. She did not try to hide anything, to\r\nsmooth over the effect of her hasty action: on the contrary, she sat\r\ndown close to me and kept looking at me fixedly. Now and again she spoke\r\nto me. And afterwards, when we were playing "_Enke_," she said:\r\n\r\n"I shall have Lieutenant Glahn. I don\'t care to run after anyone else."\r\n\r\n"_Saa for Satan_, [Footnote: Expletive, equivalent to "The Devil!" or\r\n"Damnation!"] girl, be quiet!" I whispered, stamping my foot.\r\n\r\nShe gave me a look of surprise, made a wry face as if it hurt, and then\r\nsmiled bashfully. I was deeply moved at that; the helpless look in her\r\neyes and her little thin figure were more than I could resist; I was\r\ndrawn to her in that moment, and I took her long, slight hand in mine.\r\n\r\n"Afterwards," I said, "No more now. We can meet again to-morrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the night I heard AEsop get up from his corner and growl; I heard it\r\nthrough my sleep, but I was dreaming just then of shooting, the growl of\r\nthe dog fitted into the dream, and it did not wake me, quite. When I\r\nstepped out of the hut next morning there were tracks in the grass of a\r\npair of human feet; someone had been there--had gone first to one of my\r\nwindows, then to the other. The tracks were lost again down on the road.\r\n\r\nShe came towards me with hot cheeks, with a face all beaming.\r\n\r\n"Have you been waiting?" she said. "I was afraid you would have to\r\nwait."\r\n\r\nI had not been waiting; she was on the way before me.\r\n\r\n"Have you slept well?" I asked. I hardly knew what to say.\r\n\r\n"No, I haven\'t. I have been awake," she answered. And she told me she\r\nhad not slept that night, but had sat in a chair with her eyes closed.\r\nAnd she had been out of the house for a little walk.\r\n\r\n"Someone was outside my hut last night," I said. "I saw tracks in the\r\ngrass this morning."\r\n\r\nAnd her face colored; she took my hand there, on the road, and made no\r\nanswer. I looked at her, and said:\r\n\r\n"Was it you, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered, pressing close to me. "It was I. I hope I didn\'t\r\nwake you--I stepped as quietly as I could. Yes, it was I. I was near you\r\nagain. I am fond of you!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery day, every day I met her. I will tell the truth: I was glad to\r\nmeet her; aye, my heart flew. It is two years ago this year; now, I\r\nthink of it only when I please, the whole story just amuses and\r\ndistracts me. And as for the two green feathers, I will tell about them\r\nin good time.\r\n\r\nThere were several places where we could meet--at the mill, on the road,\r\neven in my hut. She came wherever I would. _"Goddag!"_ she cried, always\r\nfirst, and I answered _"Goddag!"_\r\n\r\n"You are happy to-day," she says, and her eyes sparkle.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am happy," I answer. "There is a speck there on your shoulder;\r\nit is dust, perhaps, a speck of mud from the road; I must kiss that\r\nlittle spot. No--let me--I will. Everything about you stirs me so! I am\r\nhalf out of my senses. I did not sleep last night."\r\n\r\nAnd that was true. Many a night I lay and could not sleep.\r\n\r\nWe walk side by side along the road.\r\n\r\n"What do you think--am I as you like me to be?" she asks. "Perhaps I\r\ntalk too much. No? Oh, but you must say what you really think.\r\nSometimes I think to myself this can never come to any good..."\r\n\r\n"What can never come to any good?" I ask.\r\n\r\n"This between us. That it cannot come to any good. You may believe it or\r\nnot, but I am shivering now with cold; I feel icy cold the moment I come\r\nto you. Just out of happiness."\r\n\r\n"It is the same with me," I answer. "I feel a shiver, too, when I see\r\nyou. But it will come to some good all the same. And, anyhow, let me pat\r\nyou on the back, to warm you."\r\n\r\nAnd she lets me, half unwillingly, and then I hit a little harder, for a\r\njest, and laugh, and ask if that doesn\'t make her feel better.\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, don\'t when I ask you; _please_," says she.\r\n\r\nThose few words! There was something so helpless about her saying it so,\r\nthe wrong way round: "Please don\'t when I ask you."...\r\n\r\nThen we went on along the road again. Was she displeased with me for my\r\njest, I wondered? And thought to myself: Well, let us see. And I said:\r\n\r\n"I just happened to think of something. Once when I was out on a sledge\r\nparty, there was a young lady who took a silk kerchief from her neck and\r\nfastened it round mine. In the evening, I said to her: \'You shall have\r\nyour kerchief again to-morrow; I will have it washed.\' \'No,\' she said,\r\n\'give it to me now; I will keep it just as it is, after you have worn\r\nit.\' And I gave it to her. Three years after, I met the same young lady\r\nagain. \'The kerchief,\' I said. And she brought it out. It lay in a\r\npaper, just as before; I saw it myself."\r\n\r\nEdwarda glanced up at me.\r\n\r\n"Yes? And what then?"\r\n\r\n"That is all," I said. "There was nothing more. But I thought it was\r\nnice of her."\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"Where is that lady now?"\r\n\r\n"Abroad."\r\n\r\nWe spoke no more of that. But when it was time for her to go home, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Well, good-night. But you won\'t go thinking of that lady any more, will\r\nyou? I don\'t think of anyone but you."\r\n\r\nI believed her. I saw that she meant what she said, and it was more than\r\nenough for me that she thought of no one else. I walked after her.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Edwarda," I said. And then I added with all my heart: "You\r\nare all too good for me, but I am thankful that you will have me; God\r\nwill reward you for that. I\'m not so fine as many you could have, no\r\ndoubt, but I am all yours--so endlessly yours, by my eternal\r\nsoul.----What are you thinking of now, to bring tears to your eyes?"\r\n\r\n"It was nothing," she answered. "It sounded so strange--that God would\r\nreward me for that. You say things that I ... Oh, I love you so!"\r\n\r\nAnd all at once she threw her arms round my neck, there in the middle of\r\nthe road, and kissed me.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone, I stepped aside into the woods to hide, to be alone\r\nwith my happiness. And then I hurried eagerly back to the road to see\r\nif anyone had noticed that I had gone in there. But I saw no one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer nights and still water, and the woods endlessly still. No cry, no\r\nfootsteps from the road. My heart seemed full as with dark wine.\r\n\r\nMoths and night-flies came flying noiselessly in through my window,\r\nlured by the glow from the hearth and the smell of the bird I had just\r\ncooked. They dashed against the roof with a dull sound, fluttered past\r\nmy ears, sending a cold shiver through me, and settled on my white\r\npowder-horn on the wall. I watched them; they sat trembling and looked\r\nat me--moths and spinners and burrowing things. Some of them looked like\r\npansies on the wing.\r\n\r\nI stepped outside the hut and listened. Nothing, no noise; all was\r\nasleep. The air was alight with flying insects, myriads of buzzing\r\nwings. Out at the edge of the wood were ferns and aconite, the trailing\r\narbutus was in bloom, and I loved its tiny flowers... Thanks, my God,\r\nfor every heather bloom I have ever seen; they have been like small\r\nroses on my way, and I weep for love of them... Somewhere near were\r\nwild carnations; I could not see them, but I could mark their scent.\r\n\r\nBut now, in the night hours, great white flowers have opened suddenly;\r\ntheir chalices are spread wide; they are breathing. And furry twilight\r\nmoths slip down into their petals, making the whole plant quiver. I go\r\nfrom one flower to another. They are drunken flowers. I mark the stages\r\nof their intoxication.\r\n\r\nLight footsteps, a human breathing, a happy "_Godaften_."\r\n\r\nAnd I answer, and throw myself down on the road.\r\n\r\n"_Godaften_, Edwarda," I say again, worn out with joy.\r\n\r\n"That you should care for me so!" she whispers.\r\n\r\nAnd I answered her: "If you knew how grateful I can be! You are mine,\r\nand my heart lies still within me all the day, thinking of you. You are\r\nthe loveliest girl on earth, and I have kissed you. Often I go red with\r\njoy, only to think that I have kissed you."\r\n\r\n"Why are you so fond of me this evening?" she asks.\r\n\r\nI was that for endless reasons; I needed only to think of her to feel\r\nso. That look of hers, from under the high-arched brows, and her rich,\r\ndark skin!\r\n\r\n"Should I not be fond of you?" I say again. "I thank every tree in my\r\npath because you are well and strong. Once at a dance there was a young\r\nlady who sat out dance after dance, and they let her sit there alone. I\r\ndidn\'t know her, but her face touched me, and I bowed to her. Well? But\r\nno, she shook her head. Would she not dance, I asked her? \'Can you\r\nimagine it?\' she said. \'My father was a handsome man, and my mother a\r\nperfect beauty, and my father won her by storm. But I was born lame.\'"\r\n\r\nEdwarda looked at me.\r\n\r\n"Let us sit down," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd we sat down in the heather.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what my friend says about you?" she began. "Your eyes are\r\nlike an animal\'s, she says, and when you look at her, it makes her mad.\r\nIt is just as if you touched her, she says."\r\n\r\nA strange joy thrilled me when I heard that, not for my own sake, but\r\nfor Edwarda\'s, and I thought to myself: There is only one whom I care\r\nfor: what does that one say of the look in my eyes? And I asked her:\r\n\r\n"Who was that, your friend?"\r\n\r\n"I will not tell you," she said. "But it was one of those that were out\r\non the island that day."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then."\r\n\r\nAnd then we spoke of other things.\r\n\r\n"My father is going to Russia in a few days," she said. "And I am going\r\nto have a party. Have you been out to Korholmerne? We must have two\r\nhampers of wine; the ladies from the vicarage are coming again, and\r\nfather has already given me the wine. And you won\'t look at her again,\r\nwill you? My friend, I mean. Please, you won\'t, _will_ you? Or I\r\nshall not ask her at all."\r\n\r\nAnd with no more words she threw herself passionately about my neck, and\r\nlooked at me, gazing into my face and breathing heavily. Her glance was\r\nsheer blackness.\r\n\r\nI got up abruptly, and, in my confusion, could only say:\r\n\r\n"So your father is going to Russia?"\r\n\r\n"What did you get up like that for, so quickly?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Because it is late, Edwarda," I said. "Now the white flowers are\r\nclosing again. The sun is getting up; it will soon be day."\r\n\r\nI went with her through the woodland and stood watching her as long as I\r\ncould; far down, she turned round and softly called good-night. Then\r\nshe disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the door of the blacksmith\'s house opened. A man with\r\na white shirt front came out, looked round, pulled his hat down farther\r\nover his forehead, and took the road down to Sirilund.\r\n\r\nEdwarda\'s good-night was still in my ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nA man can be drunk with joy. I fire off my gun, and an unforgettable\r\necho answers from hill to hill, floats out over the sea and rings in\r\nsome sleepy helmsman\'s ears. And what have I to be joyful about? A\r\nthought that came to me, a memory; a sound in the woods, a human being.\r\nI think of her, I close my eyes and stand still there on the road, and\r\nthink of her; I count the minutes.\r\n\r\nNow I am thirsty, and drink from the stream; now I walk a hundred paces\r\nforward and a hundred paces back; it must be late by now, I say to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nCan there be anything wrong? A month has passed, and a month is no long\r\ntime; there is nothing wrong. Heaven knows this month has been short.\r\nBut the nights are often long, and I am driven to wet my cap in the\r\nstream and let it dry, only to pass the time, while I am waiting.\r\n\r\nI reckoned my time by nights. Sometimes there would be an evening when\r\nEdwarda did not come--once she stayed away two evenings. Nothing wrong,\r\nno. But I felt then that perhaps my happiness had reached and passed its\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nAnd had it not?\r\n\r\n"Can you hear, Edwarda, how restless it is in the woods to-night?\r\nRustling incessantly in the undergrowth, and the big leaves trembling.\r\nSomething brewing, maybe--but it was not that I had in mind to say. I\r\nhear a bird away up on the hill--only a tomtit, but it has sat there\r\ncalling in the same place two nights now. Can you hear--the same, same\r\nnote again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I hear it. Why do you ask me that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, for no reason at all. It has been there two nights now. That was\r\nall... Thanks, thanks for coming this evening, love. I sat here,\r\nexpecting you this evening, or the next, looking forward to it, when you\r\ncame."\r\n\r\n"And I have been waiting too. I think of you, and I have picked up the\r\npieces of the glass you upset once, and kept them--do you remember?\r\nFather went away last night. I could not come, there was so much to do\r\nwith the packing, and reminding him of things. I knew you were waiting\r\nhere in the woods, and I cried, and went on packing."\r\n\r\nBut it is two evenings, I thought to myself. What was she doing the\r\nfirst evening? And why is there less joy in her eyes now than before?\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. The bird up in the hills was silent, the woods lay dead.\r\nNo, no, nothing wrong; all as before; she gave me her hand to say\r\ngood-night, and looked at me with love in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow?" I said.\r\n\r\n"No, not to-morrow," she answered.\r\n\r\nI did not ask her why.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow is our party," she said with a laugh. "I was only going to\r\nsurprise you, but you looked so miserable, I had to tell you at once. I\r\nwas going to send you an invitation all on paper."\r\n\r\nAnd my heart was lightened unspeakably.\r\n\r\nShe went off, nodding farewell.\r\n\r\n"One thing more," said I, standing where I was. "How long is it since\r\nyou gathered up the pieces of that glass and put them away?"\r\n\r\n"Why--a week ago, perhaps, or a fortnight. Yes, perhaps a fortnight.\r\nBut why do you ask? Well, I will tell you the truth--it was yesterday."\r\n\r\nYesterday! No longer ago than yesterday she had thought of me. All was\r\nwell again now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two boats lay ready, and we stepped on board. Talking and singing.\r\nThe place, Korholmerne, lay out beyond the islands; it took a good while\r\nto row across, and on the way we talked, one party with another, from\r\nboat to boat. The Doctor wore light things, as the ladies did; I had\r\nnever seen him so pleased before; he talked with the rest, instead of\r\nlistening in silence. I had an idea he had been drinking a little, and\r\nso was in good humor to-day. When we landed, he craved the attention of\r\nthe party for a moment, and bade us welcome. I thought to myself: This\r\nmeans that Edwarda has asked him to act as host.\r\n\r\nHe fell to entertaining the ladies in the most amiable manner. To\r\nEdwarda he was polite and kind, often fatherly, and pedantically\r\ninstructive, as he had been so many times before. She spoke of some date\r\nor other, saying: "I was born in \'38," and he asked, "Eighteen hundred\r\nand thirty-eight, I suppose you mean?" And if she had answered, "No, in\r\nnineteen hundred and thirty-eight," he would have shown no\r\nembarrassment, but only corrected her again, and said, "I think you must\r\nbe mistaken." When I said anything myself, he listened politely and\r\nattentively, and did not ignore me.\r\n\r\nA young girl came up to me with a greeting. I did not recognize her; I\r\ncould not remember her at all, and I said a few words in surprise, and\r\nshe laughed. It was one of the Dean\'s daughters. I had met her the day\r\nwe went to the island before, and had invited her to my hut. We talked\r\ntogether a little.\r\n\r\nAn hour or so passed by. I was feeling dull, and drank from the wine\r\npoured out for me, and mixed with the others, chatting with them all.\r\nAgain I made a mistake here and there: I was on doubtful ground, and\r\ncould not tell at the moment how to answer any little civility; now and\r\nthen I talked incoherently, or even found nothing at all to say, and\r\nthis troubled me. Over by the big rock which we were using as a table\r\nsat the Doctor, gesticulating.\r\n\r\n"Soul--what is the soul?" he was saying. The Dean\'s daughter had accused\r\nhim of being a free-thinker--well, and should not a man think freely?\r\nPeople imagined hell as a sort of house down under the ground, with the\r\ndevil as host--or rather as sovereign lord. Then he spoke of the altar\r\npicture in the chapel, a figure of the Christ, with a few Jews and\r\nJewesses; water into wine--well and good. But Christ had a halo round\r\nHis head. And what was a halo? Simply a yellow hoop fixed on three\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\nTwo of the ladies clasped their hands aghast, but the Doctor extricated\r\nhimself, and said jestingly:\r\n\r\n"Sounds horrible, doesn\'t it? I admit it. But if you repeat it and\r\nrepeat it again to yourself seven or eight times, and then think it over\r\na little, it soon sounds easier... Ladies, your very good health!"\r\n\r\nAnd he knelt on the grass before the two ladies, and instead of taking\r\nhis hat off and laying it before him he held it straight up in the air\r\nwith one hand, and emptied his glass with his head bent back. I was\r\naltogether carried away by his wonderful ease of manner, and would have\r\ndrunk with him myself but that his glass was empty.\r\n\r\nEdwarda was following him with her eyes. I placed myself near her, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Shall we play \'_Enke_\' to-day?"\r\n\r\nShe started slightly, and got up.\r\n\r\n"Be careful not to say \'_Du_\' to each other now," she whispered.\r\n\r\nNow I had not said "_Du_" at all. I walked away.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed. The day was getting long; I would have rowed home\r\nalone long before if there had been a third boat; AEsop lay tied up in\r\nthe hut, and perhaps he was thinking of me. Edwarda\'s thoughts must\r\nsurely be far away from me; she talked of how lovely it would be to\r\ntravel, and see strange places; her cheeks flushed at the thought, and\r\nshe even stumbled in her speech:\r\n\r\n"No one could be more happier than I the day ..."\r\n\r\n"\'More happier\'...?" said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"What?" said she.\r\n\r\n"\'More happier.\'"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"You said \'more happier,\' I think."\r\n\r\n"Did I? I\'m sorry. No one could be happier than I the day I stood on\r\nboard the ship. Sometimes I long for places I do not know myself."\r\n\r\nShe longed to be away; she did not think of me. I stood there, and read\r\nin her face that she had forgotten me. Well, there was nothing to be\r\nsaid--but I stood there myself and saw it in her face. And the minutes\r\ndragged so miserably slowly by! I asked several of the others if we\r\nought not to row back now; it was getting late, I said, and AEsop was\r\ntied up in the hut. But none of them wanted to go back.\r\n\r\nI went over again to the Dean\'s daughter, for the third time; I thought\r\nshe must be the one that had said I had eyes like an animal\'s. We drank\r\ntogether; she had quivering eyes, they were never still; she kept\r\nlooking at me and then looking away, all the time.\r\n\r\n"Froeken," I said, "do you not think people here in these parts are like\r\nthe short summer itself? In their feeling, I mean? Beautiful, but\r\nlasting only a little while?"\r\n\r\nI spoke loudly, very loudly, and I did so on purpose. And I went on\r\nspeaking loudly, and asked that young lady once more if she would not\r\nlike to come up one day and see my hut. "Heaven bless you for it," I\r\nsaid in my distress, and I was already thinking to myself how, perhaps,\r\nI might find something to give her as a present if she came. Perhaps I\r\nhad nothing to give her but my powder-horn, I thought.\r\n\r\nAnd she promised to come.\r\n\r\nEdwarda sat with her face turned away and let me talk as much as I\r\npleased. She listened to what the others said, putting in a word herself\r\nnow and again. The Doctor told the young ladies\' fortunes by their\r\nhands, and talked a lot; he himself had small, delicate hands, with a\r\nring on one finger. I felt myself unwanted, and sat down by myself\r\nawhile on a stone. It was getting late in the afternoon. Here I am, I\r\nsaid to myself, sitting all alone on a stone, and the only creature that\r\ncould make me move, she lets me sit. Well, then, I care no more than\r\nshe.\r\n\r\nA great feeling of forsakenness came over me. I could hear them talking\r\nbehind me, and I heard how Edwarda laughed; and at that I got up\r\nsuddenly and went over to the party. My excitement ran away with me.\r\n\r\n"Just a moment," I said. "It occurred to me while I was sitting there\r\nthat perhaps you might like to see my fly-book." And I took it out. "I\r\nam sorry I did not think of it before. Just look through it, if you\r\nplease; I should be only too delighted. You must all see it; there are\r\nboth red and yellow flies in it." And I held my cap in my hand as I\r\nspoke. I was myself aware that I had taken off my cap, and I knew that\r\nthis was wrong, so I put it on again at once.\r\n\r\nThere was deep silence for a moment, and no one offered to take the\r\nbook. At last the Doctor reached out his hand for it and said politely:\r\n\r\n"Thanks very much; let us look at the things. It\'s always been a marvel\r\nto me how those flies were put together."\r\n\r\n"I make them myself," I said, full of gratitude. And I went on at once\r\nto explain how it was done. It was simple enough: I bought the feathers\r\nand the hooks. They were not well made, but they were only for my own\r\nuse. One could get ready-made flies in the shops, and they were\r\nbeautiful things.\r\n\r\nEdwarda cast one careless glance at me and my book, and went on talking\r\nwith her girl friends.\r\n\r\n"Ah, here are some of the feathers," said the Doctor. "Look, these are\r\nreally fine."\r\n\r\nEdwarda looked up.\r\n\r\n"The green ones are pretty," she said; "let me look, Doctor."\r\n\r\n"Keep them," I cried. "Yes, do, I beg you, now. Two green feathers. Do,\r\nas a kindness, let them be a keepsake."\r\n\r\nShe looked at them and said:\r\n\r\n"They are green and gold, as you turn them in the sun. Thank you, if you\r\nwill give me them."\r\n\r\n"I should be glad to," I said.\r\n\r\nAnd she took the feathers.\r\n\r\nA little later the Doctor handed me the book and thanked me. Then he got\r\nup and asked if it were not nearly time to be getting back.\r\n\r\nI said: "Yes, for Heaven\'s sake. I have a dog tied up at home; look you,\r\nI have a dog, and he is my friend; he lies there thinking of me, and\r\nwhen I come home he stands with his forepaws at the window to greet me.\r\nIt has been a lovely day, and now it is nearly over; let us go back. I\r\nam grateful to you all."\r\n\r\nI waited on the shore to see which boat Edwarda chose, and made up my\r\nmind to go in the other one myself. Suddenly she called me. I looked at\r\nher in surprise; her face was flushed. Then she came up to me, held out\r\nher hand, and said tenderly:\r\n\r\n"Thank you for the feathers. You will come in the boat with me, won\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"If you wish it," I said.\r\n\r\nWe got into the boat, and she sat down beside me on the same seat, her\r\nknee touching mine. I looked at her, and she glanced at me for a moment\r\nin return. I began to feel myself repaid for that bitter day, and was\r\ngrowing happy again, when she suddenly changed her position, turned her\r\nback to me, and began talking to the Doctor, who was sitting at the\r\nrudder.\r\n\r\nFor a full quarter of an hour I did not exist for her. Then I did\r\nsomething I repent of, and have not yet forgotten. Her shoe fell off: I\r\nsnatched it up and flung it far out into the water, for pure joy that\r\nshe was near, or from some impulse to make myself remarked, to remind\r\nher of my existence--I do not know. It all happened so suddenly I did\r\nnot think, only felt that impulse.\r\n\r\nThe ladies set up a cry. I myself was as if paralyzed by what I had\r\ndone, but what was the good of that? It was done. The Doctor came to my\r\nhelp; he cried "Row," and steered towards the shoe. And the next moment\r\nthe boatman had caught hold of the shoe just as it had filled with water\r\nand was sinking; the man\'s arm was wet up to the elbow. Then there was a\r\nshout of "Hurra" from many in the boats, because the shoe was saved.\r\n\r\nI was deeply ashamed, and felt that my face changed color and winced, as\r\nI wiped the shoe with my handkerchief. Edwarda took it without a word.\r\nNot till a little while after did she say:\r\n\r\n"I never saw such a thing!"\r\n\r\n"No, did you ever?" I said. And I smiled and pulled myself together,\r\nmaking as if I had played that trick for some particular reason--as if\r\nthere were something behind it. But what could there be? The Doctor\r\nlooked at me, for the first time, contemptuously.\r\n\r\nA little time passed; the boats glided homeward; the feeling of\r\nawkwardness among the party disappeared; we sang; we were nearing the\r\nland. Edwarda said:\r\n\r\n"Oh, we haven\'t finished the wine: there is ever so much left. We must\r\nhave another party, a new party later on; we must have a dance, a ball\r\nin the big room."\r\n\r\nWhen we went ashore I made an apology to Edwarda.\r\n\r\n"If you knew how I wished myself back in my hut!" I said. "This has been\r\na long and painful day."\r\n\r\n"Has it been a painful day for you, Lieutenant?"\r\n\r\n"I mean," said I, trying to pass it off, "I mean, I have caused\r\nunpleasantness both to myself and others. I threw your shoe into the\r\nwater."\r\n\r\n"Yes--an extraordinary thing to do."\r\n\r\n"Forgive me," I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat worse things might still happen? I resolved to keep calm, whatever\r\nmight come; Heaven is my witness. Was it I who had forced myself on her\r\nfrom the first? No, no; never! I was but standing in her way one\r\nweek-day as she passed. What a summer it was here in the north! Already\r\nthe cockchafers had ceased to fly, and people were grown more and more\r\ndifficult to understand, for all that the sun shone on them day and\r\nnight. What were their blue eyes looking for, and what were they\r\nthinking behind their mysterious lashes? Well, after all, they were all\r\nequally indifferent to me. I took out my lines and went fishing for two\r\ndays, four days; but at night I lay with open eyes in the hut...\r\n\r\n"Edwarda, I have not seen you for four days."\r\n\r\n"Four days, yes--so it is. Oh, but I have been so busy. Come and look."\r\n\r\nShe led me into the big room. The tables had been moved out, the chairs\r\nset round the walls, everything shifted; the chandelier, the stove, and\r\nthe walls were fantastically decorated with heather and black stuff from\r\nthe store. The piano stood in one corner.\r\n\r\nThese were her preparations for "the ball."\r\n\r\n"What do you think of it?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Wonderful," I said.\r\n\r\nWe went out of the room.\r\n\r\nI said: "Listen, Edwarda--have you quite forgotten me?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t understand you," she answered in surprise. "You saw all I had\r\nbeen doing--how could I come and see you at the same time?"\r\n\r\n"No," I agreed; "perhaps you couldn\'t." I was sick and exhausted with\r\nwant of sleep, my speech grew meaningless and uncontrolled; I had been\r\nmiserable the whole day. "No, of course you could not come. But I was\r\ngoing to say ... in a word, something has changed; there is something\r\nwrong. Yes. But I cannot read in your face what it is. There is\r\nsomething very strange about your brow, Edwarda. Yes, I can see it now."\r\n\r\n"But I have not forgotten you," she cried, blushing, and slipped her arm\r\nsuddenly into mine.\r\n\r\n"No? Well, perhaps you have not forgotten me. But if so, then I do not\r\nknow what I am saying. One or the other."\r\n\r\n"You shall have an invitation to-morrow. You must dance with me. Oh, how\r\nwe will dance!"\r\n\r\n"Will you go a little way with me?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Now? No, I can\'t," she answered. "The Doctor will be here presently.\r\nHe\'s going to help me with something; there is a good deal still to be\r\ndone. And you think the room will look all right as it is? But don\'t you\r\nthink...?"\r\n\r\nA carriage stops outside.\r\n\r\n"Is the Doctor driving to-day?" I ask.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I sent a horse for him. I wanted to ..."\r\n\r\n"Spare his bad foot, yes. Well, I must be off. _Goddag, Goddag_, Doctor.\r\nPleased to see you again. Well and fit, I hope? Excuse my running\r\noff..."\r\n\r\nOnce down the steps outside, I turned round. Edwarda was standing at\r\nthe window watching me; she stood holding the curtains aside with both\r\nhands, to see; and her look was thoughtful. A foolish joy thrilled me; I\r\nhurried away from the house light-footed, with a darkness shading my\r\neyes; my gun was light as a walking-stick in my hand. If I could win\r\nher, I should become a good man, I thought. I reached the woods and\r\nthought again: If I might win her, I would serve her more untiringly\r\nthan any other; and even if she proved unworthy, if she took a fancy to\r\ndemand impossibilities, I would yet do all that I could, and be glad\r\nthat she was mine... I stopped, fell on my knees, and in humility and\r\nhope licked a few blades of grass by the roadside, and then got up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt last I began to feel almost sure. Her altered behavior of late--it\r\nwas only her manner. She had stood looking after me when I went; stood\r\nat the window following with her eyes till I disappeared. What more\r\ncould she do? My delight upset me altogether; I was hungry, and no\r\nlonger felt it.\r\n\r\nAEsop ran on ahead; a moment afterward he began to bark. I looked up; a\r\nwoman with a white kerchief on her head was standing by the corner of\r\nthe hut. It was Eva, the blacksmith\'s daughter.\r\n\r\n"_Goddag_, Eva!" I called to her.\r\n\r\nShe stood by the big grey stone, her face all red, sucking one finger.\r\n\r\n"Is it you, Eva? What is the matter?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"AEsop has bitten me," she answered, with some awkwardness, and cast down\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nI looked at her finger. She had bitten it herself. A thought flashed\r\ninto my mind, and I asked her:\r\n\r\n"Have you been waiting here long?"\r\n\r\n"No, not very long," she answered.\r\n\r\nAnd without a word more from either of us, I took her by the hand and\r\nlet her into the hut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nI came from my fishing as usual, and appeared at the "ball" with the gun\r\nand bag--only I had put on my best leather suit. It was late when I got\r\nto Sirilund; I heard them dancing inside. Someone called out: "Here\'s\r\nthe hunter, the Lieutenant." A few of the young people crowded round me\r\nand wanted to see my catch; I had shot a brace of seabirds and caught a\r\nfew haddock. Edwarda bade me welcome with a smile; she had been dancing,\r\nand was flushed.\r\n\r\n"The first dance with me," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd we danced. Nothing awkward happened; I turned giddy, but did not\r\nfall. My heavy boots made a certain amount of noise; I could hear it\r\nmyself, the noise, and resolved not to dance any more; I had even\r\nscratched their painted floor. But how glad I was that I had done\r\nnothing worse!\r\n\r\nHerr Mack\'s two assistants from the store were there, laboriously and\r\nwith a solemn concentration. The Doctor took part eagerly in the set\r\ndances. Besides these gentlemen, there were four other youngish men,\r\nsons of families belonging to the parish, the Dean, and the district\r\nsurgeons. A stranger, a commercial traveller, was there too; he made\r\nhimself remarked by his fine voice, and tralala\'ed to the music; now and\r\nagain he relieved the ladies at the piano.\r\n\r\nI cannot remember now what happened the first few hours, but I remember\r\neverything from the latter part of the night. The sun shone redly in\r\nthrough the windows all the time, and the seabirds slept. We had wine\r\nand cakes, we talked loud and sang, Edwarda\'s laugh sounded fresh and\r\ncareless through the room. But why had she never a word for me now? I\r\nwent towards where she was sitting, and would have said something polite\r\nto her, as best I could; she was wearing a black dress, her confirmation\r\ndress, perhaps, and it was grown too short for her, but it suited her\r\nwhen she danced, and I thought to tell her so.\r\n\r\n"That black dress..." I began.\r\n\r\nBut she stood up, put her arm round one of her girl friends, and walked\r\noff with her. This happened two or three times. Well, I thought to\r\nmyself, if it\'s like that... But then why should she stand looking\r\nsorrowfully after me from the window when I go? Well, \'tis her affair!\r\n\r\nA lady asked me to dance. Edwarda was sitting near, and I answered\r\nloudly:\r\n\r\n"No; I am going home directly."\r\n\r\nEdwarda threw a questioning glance at me, and said: "Going? Oh, no, you\r\nmustn\'t go."\r\n\r\nI started, and felt that I was biting my lip. I got up.\r\n\r\n"What you said then seemed very significant to me, Edwarda," I said\r\ndarkly, and made a few steps towards the door.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor put himself in my way, and Edwarda herself came hurrying up.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t misunderstand me," she said warmly. "I meant to say I hoped you\r\nwould be the last to go, the very last. And besides, it\'s only one\r\no\'clock... Listen," she went on with sparkling eyes, "you gave our\r\nboatmen five _daler_ for saving my shoe. It was too much." And she\r\nlaughed heartily and turned round to the rest.\r\n\r\nI stood with open mouth, disarmed and confused.\r\n\r\n"You are pleased to be witty," I said. "I never gave your boatman five\r\n_daler_ at all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, didn\'t you?" She opened the door to the kitchen, and called the\r\nboatmen in. "Jakob, you remember the day you rowed us out to\r\nKorholmerne, and you picked up my shoe when it fell into the water?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Jakob.\r\n\r\n"And you were given five _daler_ for saving it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you gave me..."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, that will do, you can go."\r\n\r\nNow what did she mean by that trick? I thought she was trying to shame\r\nme. She should not succeed; I was not going to have that to blush for.\r\nAnd I said loudly and distinctly:\r\n\r\n"I must point out to all here that this is either a mistake or a lie. I\r\nhave never so much as thought of giving the boatman five _daler_\r\nfor your shoe. I ought to have done so, perhaps, but up to now it has\r\nnot been done."\r\n\r\n"Whereupon we shall continue the dance," she said, frowning. "Why aren\'t\r\nwe dancing?"\r\n\r\n"She owes me an explanation of this," I said to myself, and watched for\r\nan opportunity to speak with her. She went into a side room, and I\r\nfollowed her.\r\n\r\n"_Skaal_," I said, and lifted a glass to drink with her.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing in my glass," she answered shortly.\r\n\r\nBut her glass was standing in front of her, quite full.\r\n\r\n"I thought that was your glass."\r\n\r\n"No, it is not mine," she answered, and turned away, and was in deep\r\nconversation with someone else.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon then," said I.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the guests had noticed this little scene.\r\n\r\nMy heart was hissing within me. I said offendedly: "But at least you owe\r\nme an explanation..."\r\n\r\nShe rose, took both my hands, and said earnestly:\r\n\r\n"But not to-day; not now. I am so miserable. Heavens, how you look at\r\nme. We were friends once..."\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed, I turned right about, and went in to the dancers again.\r\n\r\nA little after, Edwarda herself came in and took up her place by the\r\npiano, at which the travelling man was seated, playing a dance; her face\r\nat that moment was full of inward pain.\r\n\r\n"I have never learned to play," she said, looking at me with dark eyes.\r\n"If I only could!"\r\n\r\nI could make no answer to this. But my heart flew out towards her once\r\nmore, and I asked:\r\n\r\n"Why are you so unhappy all at once, Edwarda? If you knew how it hurts\r\nme to see--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what it is," she said. "Everything, perhaps. I wish all\r\nthese people would go away at once, all of them. No, not you--remember,\r\nyou must stay till the last."\r\n\r\nAnd again her words revived me, and my eyes saw the light in the\r\nsun-filled room. The Dean\'s daughter came over, and began talking to me;\r\nI wished her ever so far away, and gave her short answers. And I\r\npurposely kept from looking at her, for she had said that about my eyes\r\nbeing like an animal\'s. She turned to Edwarda and told her that once,\r\nsomewhere abroad--in Riga I think it was--a man had followed her along\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n"Kept walking after me, street after street, and smiling across at me,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n"Why, was he blind, then?" I broke in, thinking to please Edwarda. And I\r\nshrugged my shoulders as well.\r\n\r\nThe young lady understood my coarseness at once, and answered:\r\n\r\n"He must have been blind indeed, to run after any one so old and ugly as\r\nI am."\r\n\r\nBut I gained no thanks from Edwarda for that: she drew her friend away;\r\nthey whispered together and shook their heads. After that, I was left\r\naltogether to myself.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed. The seabirds began to wake out on the reefs; their\r\ncries sounded in through the open windows. A spasm of joy went through\r\nme at this first calling of the birds, and I longed to be out there on\r\nthe islands myself...\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, once more in good humor, drew the attention of all present.\r\nThe ladies were never tired of his society. Is that thing there my\r\nrival? I thought, noting his lame leg and miserable figure. He had taken\r\nto a new and amusing oath: he said _Doed og Pinsel_, [Footnote: A\r\nslight variation of the usual Doed og Pine (death and torture).] and\r\nevery time he used that comical expression I laughed aloud. In my misery\r\nI wished to give the fellow every advantage I could, since he was my\r\nrival. I let it be "Doctor" here and "Doctor" there, and called out\r\nmyself: "Listen to the Doctor!" and laughed aloud at the things he said.\r\n\r\n"I love this world," said the Doctor. "I cling to life tooth and nail.\r\nAnd when I come to die, then I hope to find a corner somewhere straight\r\nup over London and Paris, where I can hear the rumble of the human\r\ncancan all the time, all the time."\r\n\r\n"Splendid!" I cried, and choked with laughter, though I was not in the\r\nleast bit drunk.\r\n\r\nEdwarda too seemed delighted.\r\n\r\nWhen the guests began to go, I slipped away into the little room at the\r\nside and sat down to wait. I heard one after another saying good-bye on\r\nthe stairs; the Doctor also took his leave and went. Soon all the voices\r\nhad died away. My heart beat violently as I waited.\r\n\r\nEdwarda came in again. At sight of me she stood a moment in surprise;\r\nthen she said with a smile:\r\n\r\n"Oh, are you there? It was kind of you to wait till the last. I am tired\r\nout now."\r\n\r\nShe remained standing.\r\n\r\nI got up then, and said: "You will be wanting rest now. I hope you are\r\nnot displeased any more, Edwarda. You were so unhappy a while back, and\r\nit hurt me."\r\n\r\n"It will be all right when I have slept."\r\n\r\nI had no more to add. I went towards the door.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she said, offering her hand. "It was a pleasant evening."\r\nShe would have seen me to the door, but I tried to prevent her.\r\n\r\n"No need," I said; "do not trouble, I can find my way..."\r\n\r\nBut she went with me all the same. She stood in the passage waiting\r\npatiently while I found my cap, my gun, and my bag. There was a\r\nwalking-stick in the corner; I saw it well enough; I stared at it, and\r\nrecognized it--it was the Doctor\'s. When she marked what I was looking\r\nat, she blushed in confusion; it was plain to see from her face that she\r\nwas innocent, that she knew nothing of the stick. A whole minute passed.\r\nAt last she turned, furiously impatient, and said tremblingly:\r\n\r\n"Your stick--do not forget your stick."\r\n\r\nAnd there before my eyes she handed me the Doctor\'s stick.\r\n\r\nI looked at her. She was still holding out the stick; her hand trembled.\r\nTo make an end of it, I took the thing, and set it back in the corner.\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n"It is the Doctor\'s stick. I cannot understand how a lame man could\r\nforget his stick." "You and your lame man!" she cried bitterly, and took\r\na step forward towards me. "You are not lame--no; but even if you were,\r\nyou could not compare with him; no, you could never compare with him.\r\nThere!"\r\n\r\nI sought for some answer, but my mind was suddenly empty; I was silent.\r\nWith a deep bow, I stepped backwards out of the door, and down on to the\r\nsteps. There I stood a moment looking straight before me; then I moved\r\noff.\r\n\r\n"So, he has forgotten his stick," I thought to myself. "And he will come\r\nback this way to fetch it. He would not let _me_ be the last man to\r\nleave the house..." I walked up the road very slowly, keeping a\r\nlookout either way, and stopped at the edge of the wood. At last, after\r\nhalf an hour\'s waiting, the Doctor came walking towards me; he had seen\r\nme, and was walking quickly. Before he had time to speak I lifted my\r\ncap, to try him. He raised his hat in return. I went straight up to him\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n"I gave you no greeting."\r\n\r\nHe came a step nearer and stared at me.\r\n\r\n"You gave me no greeting...?"\r\n\r\n"No," said I.\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"Why, it is all the same to me what you did," he said, turning pale. "I\r\nwas going to fetch my stick; I left it behind." I could say nothing in\r\nanswer to this, but I took my revenge another way; I stretched out my\r\ngun before him, as if he were a dog, and said:\r\n\r\n"Over!"\r\n\r\nAnd I whistled, as if coaxing him to jump over.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he struggled with himself; his face took on the strangest\r\nplay of expression as he pressed his lips together and held his eyes\r\nfixed on the ground. Suddenly he looked at me sharply; a half smile lit\r\nup his features, and he said:\r\n\r\n"What do you really mean by all this?"\r\n\r\nI did not answer, but his words affected me.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he held out his hand to me, and said gently:\r\n\r\n"There is something wrong with you. If you will tell me what it is, then\r\nperhaps..."\r\n\r\nI was overwhelmed now with shame and despair; his calm words made me\r\nlose my balance. I wished to show him some kindness in return, and I\r\nput my arm round him, and said:\r\n\r\n"Forgive me this! No, what could be wrong with me? There is nothing\r\nwrong; I have no need of your help. You are looking for Edwarda,\r\nperhaps? You will find her at home. But make haste, or she will have\r\ngone to bed before you come; she was very tired, I could see it myself.\r\nI tell you the best news I can, now; it is true. You will find her at\r\nhome--go, then!" And I turned and hurried away from him, striking out\r\nwith a long stride up through the woods and back to the hut.\r\n\r\nFor a while I sat there on the bed just as I had come in, with my bag\r\nover my shoulder and my gun in my hand. Strange thoughts passed through\r\nmy mind. Why ever had I given myself away so to that Doctor? The thought\r\nthat I had put my arm round him and looked at him with wet eyes angered\r\nme; he would chuckle over it, I thought; perhaps at that very moment he\r\nmight be sitting laughing over it, with Edwarda. He had set his stick\r\naside in the hall. Yes, even if I were lame, I could not compare with\r\nthe Doctor. I could never compare with him--those were her words...\r\n\r\nI stepped out into the middle of the floor, cocked my gun, set the\r\nmuzzle against my left instep, and pulled the trigger. The shot passed\r\nthrough the middle of the foot and pierced the floor. AEsop gave a short\r\nterrified bark.\r\n\r\nA little after there came a knock at the door.\r\n\r\nIt was the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Sorry to disturb you," he began. "You went off so suddenly, I thought\r\nit might do no harm if we had a little talk together. Smell of powder,\r\nisn\'t there...?"\r\n\r\nHe was perfectly sober. "Did you see Edwarda? Did you get your stick?"\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n"I found my stick. But Edwarda had gone to bed... What\'s that? Heavens,\r\nman, you\'re bleeding!"\r\n\r\n"No, nothing to speak of. I was just putting the gun away, and it went\r\noff; it\'s nothing. Devil take you, am I obliged to sit here and give you\r\nall sorts of information about that...? You found your stick?"\r\n\r\nBut he did not heed my words; he was staring at my torn boot and the\r\ntrickle of blood. With a quick movement he laid down his stick and took\r\noff his gloves.\r\n\r\n"Sit still--I must get that boot off. I _thought_ it was a shot I\r\nheard."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I repented of it afterward--that business with the gun. It was a mad\r\nthing to do. It was not worth while any way, and it served no purpose,\r\nonly kept me tied down to the hut for weeks. I remember distinctly even\r\nnow all the discomfort and annoyance it caused; my washerwoman had to\r\ncome every day and stay there nearly all the time, making purchases of\r\nfood, looking after my housekeeping, for several weeks. Well, and\r\nthen...\r\n\r\nOne day the Doctor began talking about Edwarda. I heard her name, heard\r\nwhat she had said and done, and it was no longer of any great importance\r\nto me; it was as if he spoke of some distant, irrelevant thing. So\r\nquickly one can forget, I thought to myself, and wondered at it.\r\n\r\n"Well, and what do you think of Edwarda yourself, since you ask? I have\r\nnot thought of her for weeks, to tell the truth. Wait a bit--it seems to\r\nme there must have been something between you and her, you were so often\r\ntogether. You acted host one day at a picnic on the island, and she was\r\nhostess. Don\'t deny it, Doctor, there was something--a sort of\r\nunderstanding. No, for Heaven\'s sake don\'t answer me. You owe me no\r\nexplanation, I am not asking to be told anything at all--let us talk of\r\nsomething else if you like. How long before I can get about again?"\r\n\r\nI sat there thinking of what I had said. Why was I inwardly afraid lest\r\nthe Doctor should speak out? What was Edwarda to me? I had forgotten\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd later the talk turned on her again, and I interrupted him once\r\nmore--God knows what it was I dreaded to hear.\r\n\r\n"What do you break off like that for?" he asked. "Is it that you can\'t\r\nbear to hear me speak her name?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me," I said, "what is your honest opinion of Edwarda? I should be\r\ninterested to know."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"My honest opinion?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you may have something new to tell me to-day. Perhaps you have\r\nproposed, and been accepted. May I congratulate you? No? Ah, the devil\r\ntrust you--haha!"\r\n\r\n"So that was what you were afraid of?"\r\n\r\n"Afraid of? My dear Doctor!"\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, "I have not proposed and been accepted. But you have,\r\nperhaps. There\'s no proposing to Edwarda--she will take whomever she has\r\na fancy for. Did you take her for a peasant girl? You have met her, and\r\nseen for yourself. She is a child that\'s had too little whipping in her\r\ntime, and a woman of many moods. Cold? No fear of that! Warm? Ice, I\r\nsay. What is she, then? A slip of a girl, sixteen or seventeen--exactly.\r\nBut try to make an impression on that slip of a girl, and she\r\nwill laugh you to scorn for your trouble. Even her father can do nothing\r\nwith her; she obeys him outwardly, but, in point of fact, \'tis she\r\nherself that rules. She says you have eyes like an animal..."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong there--it was someone else said I had eyes like an\r\nanimal."\r\n\r\n"Someone else? Who?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. One of her girl friends. No, it was not Edwarda said\r\nthat. Wait a bit though; perhaps, after all, it was Edwarda..."\r\n\r\n"When you look at her, it makes her feel so and so, she says. But do you\r\nthink that brings you a hairbreadth nearer? Hardly. Look at her, use\r\nyour eyes as much as you please--but as soon as she marks what you are\r\ndoing, she will say to herself--\'Ho, here\'s this man looking at me with\r\nhis eyes, and thinks to win me that way.\' And with a single glance, or a\r\nword, she\'ll have you ten leagues away. Do you think I don\'t know her?\r\nHow old do you reckon her to be?" "She was born in \'38, she said."\r\n\r\n"A lie. I looked it up, out of curiosity. She\'s twenty, though she might\r\nwell pass for fifteen. She is not happy; there\'s a deal of conflict in\r\nthat little head of hers. When she stands looking out at the hills and\r\nthe sea, and her mouth gives that little twitch, that little spasm of\r\npain, then she is suffering; but she is too proud, too obstinate for\r\ntears. She is more than a bit romantic; a powerful imagination; she is\r\nwaiting for a prince. What was that about a certain five-_daler_ note\r\nyou were supposed to have given someone?"\r\n\r\n"A jest. It was nothing..."\r\n\r\n"It was something all the same. She did something of the same sort with\r\nme once. It\'s a year ago now. We were on board the mail-packet while it\r\nwas lying here in the harbour. It was raining, and very cold. A woman\r\nwith a child in her arms was sitting on deck, shivering. Edwarda asked\r\nher: \'Don\'t you feel cold?\' Yes, she did. \'And the little one too?\' Yes,\r\nthe little one was cold as well. \'Why don\'t you go into the cabin?\' asks\r\nEdwarda. \'I\'ve only a steerage ticket,\' says the woman. Edwarda looks at\r\nme. \'The woman here has only a steerage ticket,\' she says. \'Well, and\r\nwhat then?\' I say to myself. But I understand her look. I\'m not a rich\r\nman; what I have I\'ve worked to earn, and I think twice before I spend\r\nit; so I move away. If Edwarda wants someone to pay for the woman, let\r\nher do it herself; she and her father can better afford it than I. And\r\nsure enough, Edwarda paid. She\'s splendid in that way--no one can say\r\nshe hasn\'t a heart. But as true as I\'m sitting here she expected me to\r\npay for a saloon passage for the woman and child; I could see it in her\r\neyes. And what then, do you think? The woman gets up and thanks her for\r\nher kindness. \'Don\'t thank me--it was that gentleman there,\' says\r\nEdwarda, pointing to me as calmly as could be. What do you think of\r\nthat? The woman thanks me too; and what can I say? Simply had to leave\r\nit as it was. That\'s just one thing about her. But I could tell you many\r\nmore. And as for the five _daler_ to the boatman--she gave him the money\r\nherself. If you had done it, she would have flung her arms round you and\r\nkissed you on the spot. You should have been the lordly cavalier that\r\npaid an extravagant sum for a worn-out shoe--that would have suited her\r\nideas; she expected it. And as you didn\'t--she did it herself in your\r\nname. That\'s her way--reckless and calculating at the same time."\r\n\r\n"Is there no one, then, that can win her?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Severity\'s what she wants," said the Doctor, evading the question.\r\n"There\'s something wrong about it all; she has too free a hand; she can\r\ndo as she pleases, and have her own way all the time. People take\r\nnotice of her; no one ever disregards her; there is always something at\r\nhand for her to work on with effect. Have you noticed the way I treat\r\nher myself? Like a schoolgirl, a child; I order her about, criticise her\r\nway of speaking, watch her carefully, and show her up now and again. Do\r\nyou think she doesn\'t understand it? Oh, she\'s stiff and proud, it hurts\r\nher every time; but then again she is too proud to show it. But that\'s\r\nthe way she should be handled. When you came up here I had been at her\r\nfor a year like that, and it was beginning to tell; she cried with pain\r\nand vexation; she was growing more reasonable. Then you came along and\r\nupset it all. That\'s the way it goes--one lets go of her and another\r\ntakes her up again. After you, there\'ll be a third, I suppose--you never\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Oho," thought I to myself, "the Doctor has something to revenge." And I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Doctor, what made you trouble to tell me all that long story? What was\r\nit for? Am I to help you with her upbringing?"\r\n\r\n"And then she\'s fiery as a volcano," he went on, never heeding my\r\nquestion. "You asked if no one could ever win her? I don\'t see why not.\r\nShe is waiting for her prince, and he hasn\'t come yet. Again and again\r\nshe thinks she\'s found him, and finds out she\'s wrong; she thought you\r\nwere the one, especially because you had eyes like an animal. Haha! I\r\nsay, though, Herr Lieutenant, you ought at least to have brought your\r\nuniform with you. It would have been useful now. Why shouldn\'t she be\r\nwon? I have seen her wringing her hands with longing for someone to come\r\nand take her, carry her away, rule over her, body and soul. Yes ... but\r\nhe must come from somewhere--turn up suddenly one day, and be something\r\nout of the ordinary. I have an idea that Herr Mack is out on an\r\nexpedition; there\'s something behind this journey of his. He went off\r\nlike that once before, and brought a man back with him."\r\n\r\n"Brought a man back with him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but he was no good," said the Doctor, with a wry laugh. "He was a\r\nman about my own age, and lame, too, like myself. He wouldn\'t do for the\r\nprince."\r\n\r\n"And he went away again? Where did he go?" I asked, looking fixedly at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Where? Went away? Oh, I don\'t know," he answered confusedly. "Well,\r\nwell, we\'ve been talking too long about this already. That foot of\r\nyours--oh, you can begin to walk in a week\'s time. _Au revoir._"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nA woman\'s voice outside the hut. The blood rushed to my head--it was\r\nEdwarda. "Glahn--Glahn is ill, so I have heard."\r\n\r\nAnd my washerwoman answered outside the door:\r\n\r\n"He\'s nearly well again now."\r\n\r\nThat "Glahn--Glahn" went through me to the marrow of my bones; she said\r\nmy name twice, and it touched me; her voice was clear and ringing.\r\n\r\nShe opened my door without knocking, stepped hastily in, and looked at\r\nme. And suddenly all seemed as in the old days. There she was in her\r\ndyed jacket and her apron tied low in front, to give a longer waist. I\r\nsaw it all at once; and her look, her brown face with the eyebrows\r\nhigh-arched into the forehead, the strangely tender expression of her\r\nhands, all came on me so strongly that my brain was in a whirl. I have\r\nkissed _her_! I thought to myself.\r\n\r\nI got up and remained standing.\r\n\r\n"And you get up, you stand, when I come?" she said. "Oh, but sit down.\r\nYour foot is bad, you shot yourself. Heavens, how did it happen? I did\r\nnot know of it till just now. And I was thinking all the time: What can\r\nhave happened to Glahn? He never comes now. I knew nothing of it all.\r\nAnd you had shot yourself, and it was weeks ago, they tell me, and I\r\nknew never a word. How are you now? You are very pale: I should hardly\r\nrecognize you. And your foot--will you be lame now? The Doctor says you\r\nwill not be lame. Oh, I am so fond of you because you are not going to\r\nbe lame! I thank God for that. I hope you will forgive me for coming up\r\nlike this without letting you know; I ran nearly all the way..."\r\n\r\nShe bent over me, she was close to me, I felt her breath on my face; I\r\nreached out my hands to hold her. Then she moved away a little. Her eyes\r\nwere still dewy.\r\n\r\n"It happened this way," I stammered out. "I was putting the gun away in\r\nthe corner, but I held it awkwardly--up and down, like that; then\r\nsuddenly I heard the shot. It was an accident."\r\n\r\n"An accident," she said thoughtfully, nodding her head. "Let me see--it\r\nis the left foot--but why the left more than the right? Yes, of course,\r\nan accident..."\r\n\r\n"Yes, an accident," I broke in. "How should I know why it just happened\r\nto be the left foot? You can see for yourself--that\'s how I was holding\r\nthe gun--it couldn\'t be the right foot that way. It was a nuisance, of\r\ncourse." She looked at me curiously.\r\n\r\n"Well, and so you are getting on nicely," she said, looking around the\r\nhut. "Why didn\'t you send the woman down to us for food? What have you\r\nbeen living on?"\r\n\r\nWe went on talking for a few minutes. I asked her:\r\n\r\n"When you came in, your face was moved, and your eyes sparkled; you gave\r\nme your hand. But now your eyes are cold again. Am I wrong?"\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"One cannot always be the same..."\r\n\r\n"Tell me this one thing," I said. "What is it this time that I have said\r\nor done to displease you? Then, perhaps, I might manage better in\r\nfuture."\r\n\r\nShe looked out the window, towards the far horizon; stood looking out\r\nthoughtfully and answered me as I sat there behind her:\r\n\r\n"Nothing, Glahn. Just thoughts that come at times. Are you angry now?\r\nRemember, some give a little, but it is much for them to give; others\r\ncan give much, and it costs them nothing--and which has given more? You\r\nhave grown melancholy in your illness. How did we come to talk of all\r\nthis?" And suddenly she looked at me, her face flushed with joy. "But\r\nyou must get well soon, now. We shall meet again."\r\n\r\nAnd she held out her hand. Then it came into my head not to take her\r\nhand. I stood up, put my hands behind my back, and bowed deeply; that\r\nwas to thank her for her kindness in coming to pay me a visit.\r\n\r\n"You must excuse me if I cannot see you home," I said.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone, I sat down again to think it all over. I wrote a\r\nletter, and asked to have my uniform sent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first day in the woods.\r\n\r\nI was happy and weary; all the creatures came up close and looked at me;\r\nthere were insects on the trees and oil-beetles crawling on the road.\r\nWell met! I said to myself. The feeling of the woods went through and\r\nthrough my senses; I cried for love of it all, and was utterly happy; I\r\nwas dissolved in thanksgiving. Dear woods, my home, God\'s peace with\r\nyou from my heart... I stopped and turned all ways, named the things\r\nwith tears. Birds and trees and stones and grass and ants, I called them\r\nall by name, looked round and called them all in their order. I looked\r\nup to the hills and thought: Now, now I am coming, as if in answer to\r\ntheir calling. Far above, the dwarf falcon was hacking away--I knew\r\nwhere its nests were. But the sound of those falcons up in the hills\r\nsent my thoughts far away.\r\n\r\nAbout noon I rowed out and landed on a little island, an islet outside\r\nthe harbour. There were mauve-coloured flowers with long stalks reaching\r\nto my knees; I waded in strange growths, raspberry and coarse grass;\r\nthere were no animals, and perhaps there had never been any human being\r\nthere. The sea foamed gently against the rocks and wrapped me in a veil\r\nof murmuring; far up on the egg-cliffs, all the birds of the coast were\r\nflying and screaming. But the sea wrapped me round on all sides as in an\r\nembrace. Blessed be life and earth and sky, blessed be my enemies; in\r\nthis hour I will be gracious to my bitterest enemy, and bind the latchet\r\nof his shoe...\r\n\r\n"_Hiv ... ohoi..._" Sounds from one of Herr Mack\'s craft. My heart\r\nwas filled with sunshine at the well-known song. I rowed to the quay,\r\nwalked up past the fishers\' huts and home. The day was at an end. I had\r\nmy meal, sharing it with AEsop, and set out into the woods once more.\r\nSoft winds breathed silently in my face. And I blessed the winds\r\nbecause they touched my face; I told them that I blessed them; my very\r\nblood sang in my veins for thankfulness. AEsop laid one paw on my knee.\r\n\r\nWeariness came over me; I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lul! lul!_ Bells ringing! Some leagues out at sea rose a mountain.\r\nI said two prayers, one for my dog and one for myself, and we entered\r\ninto the mountain there. The gate closed behind us; I started at its\r\nclang, and woke.\r\n\r\nFlaming red sky, the sun there stamping before my eyes; the night, the\r\nhorizon, echoing with light. AEsop and I moved into the shade. All quiet\r\naround us. "No, we will not sleep now," I said to the dog, "we will go\r\nout hunting tomorrow; the red sun is shining on us, we will not go into\r\nthe mountain." ... And strange thoughts woke to life in me, and the\r\nblood rose to my head.\r\n\r\nExcited, yet still weak, I felt someone kissing me, and the kiss lay on\r\nmy lips. I looked round: there was nothing visible. "Iselin!" A sound in\r\nthe grass--it might be a leaf falling to the ground, or it might be\r\nfootsteps. A shiver through the woods--and I told myself it might be\r\nIselin\'s breathing. Here in these woods she has moved, Iselin; here she\r\nhas listened to the prayers of yellow-booted, green-cloaked huntsmen.\r\nShe lived out on my farm, two miles away; four generations ago she sat\r\nat her window, and heard the echo of horns in the forest. There were\r\nreindeer and wolf and bear, and the hunters were many, and all of them\r\nhad seen her grow up from a child, and each and all of them had waited\r\nfor her. One had seen her eyes, another heard her voice. When she was\r\ntwelve years old came Dundas. He was a Scotsman, and traded in fish, and\r\nhad many ships. He had a son. When she was sixteen, she saw young Dundas\r\nfor the first time. He was her first love...\r\n\r\nAnd such strange fancies flowed through me, and my head grew very heavy\r\nas I sat there; I closed my eyes and felt for Iselin\'s kiss. Iselin, are\r\nyou here, lover of life? And have you Diderik there? ... But my head\r\ngrew heavier still, and I floated off on the waves of sleep.\r\n\r\n_Lul! lul!_ A voice speaking, as if the Seven Stars themselves were\r\nsinging through my blood; Iselin\'s voice:\r\n\r\n"Sleep, sleep! I will tell you of my love while you sleep. I was\r\nsixteen, and it was springtime, with warm winds; Dundas came. It was\r\nlike the rushing of an eagle\'s flight. I met him one morning before the\r\nhunt set out; he was twenty-five, and came from far lands; he walked by\r\nmy side in the garden, and when he touched me with his arm I began to\r\nlove him. Two red spots showed in his forehead, and I could have kissed\r\nthose two red spots.\r\n\r\n"In the evening after the hunt I went to seek him in the garden, and I\r\nwas afraid lest I should find him. I spoke his name softly to myself,\r\nand feared lest he should hear. Then he came out from the bushes and\r\nwhispered: \'An hour after midnight!\' And then he was gone.\r\n\r\n"\'An hour after midnight,\' I said to myself--\'what did he mean by that?\r\nI cannot understand. He must have meant he was going away to far lands\r\nagain; an hour after midnight he was going away--but what was it to me?\'\r\n\r\n"An hour after midnight he came back."\r\n\r\n"\'May I sit there by you?\' he said.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes,\' I told him. \'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n"We sat there on the sofa; I moved away. I looked down.\r\n\r\n"\'You are cold,\' he said, and took my hand. A little after he said:\r\n\'How cold you are!\' and put his arm round me.\r\n\r\n"And I was warmed with his arm. So we sat a little while. Then a cock\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\n"\'Did you hear,\' he said, \'a cock crow? It is nearly dawn.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Are you quite sure it was the cock crow?\' I stammered.\r\n\r\n"Then the day came--already it was morning. Something was thrilling all\r\nthrough me. What hour was it that struck just now?\r\n\r\n"My maid came in.\r\n\r\n"\'Your flowers have not been watered,\' she said.\r\n\r\n"I had forgotten my flowers.\r\n\r\n"A carriage drove up to the gate.\r\n\r\n"\'Your cat has had no milk,\' said the maid.\r\n\r\n"But I had no thought for my flowers, or my cat; I asked:\r\n\r\n"\'Is that Dundas outside there? Ask him to come in here to me at once; I\r\nam expecting him; there was something...\'\r\n\r\n"He knocked. I opened the door.\r\n\r\n"\'Iselin!\' he cried, and kissed my lips a whole minute long.\r\n\r\n"\'I did not send for you,\' I whispered to him.\r\n\r\n"\'Did you not?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n"Then I answered:\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, I did--I sent for you. I was longing so unspeakably for you\r\nagain. Stay here with me a little.\'\r\n\r\n"And I covered my eyes for love of him. He did not loose me; I sank\r\nforward and hid myself close to him.\r\n\r\n"\'Surely that was something crowing again,\' he said, listening.\r\n\r\n"But when I heard what he said, I cut off his words as swiftly as I\r\ncould, and answered:\r\n\r\n"\'No, how can you imagine it? There was nothing crowing then.\'\r\n\r\n"He kissed me.\r\n\r\n"Then it was evening again, and Dundas was gone. Something golden\r\nthrilling through me. I stood before the glass, and two eyes all alight\r\nwith love looked out at me; I felt something moving in me at my own\r\nglance, and always that something thrilling and thrilling round my\r\nheart. Dear God! I had never seen myself with those eyes before, and I\r\nkissed my own lips, all love and desire, in the glass...\r\n\r\n"And now I have told you. Another time I will tell you of Svend\r\nHerlufsen. I loved him too; he lived a league away, on the island you\r\ncan see out there, and I rowed out to him myself on calm summer\r\nevenings, because I loved him. And I will tell you of Stamer. He was a\r\npriest, and I loved him. I love all..."\r\n\r\nThrough my helf-sleep I heard a cock crowing down at Sirilund.\r\n\r\n"Iselin, hear! A cock is crowing for us too!" I cried joyfully, and\r\nreached out my arms. I woke. AEsop was already moving. "Gone!" I said in\r\nburning sorrow, and looked round. There was no one--no one there. It was\r\nmorning now; the cock was still crowing down at Sirilund.\r\n\r\nBy the hut stood a woman--Eva. She had a rope in her hand; she was going\r\nto fetch wood. There was the morning of life in the young girl\'s figure\r\nas she stood there, all golden in the sun.\r\n\r\n"You must not think..." she stammered out.\r\n\r\n"What is it I must not think, Eva?"\r\n\r\n"I--I did not come this way to meet you; I was just passing..."\r\n\r\nAnd her face darkened in a blush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nMy foot continued to trouble me a good deal. It often itched at nights,\r\nand kept me awake; a sudden spasm would shoot through it, and in\r\nchangeable weather it was full of gout. It was like that for many days.\r\nBut it did not make me lame, after all.\r\n\r\nThe days went on.\r\n\r\nHerr Mack had returned, and I knew it soon enough. He took my boat away\r\nfrom me, and left me in difficulties, for it was still the closed\r\nseason, and there was nothing I could shoot. But why did he take the\r\nboat away from me like that? Two of Herr Mack\'s folk from the quay had\r\nrowed out with a stranger in the morning.\r\n\r\nI met the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"They have taken my boat away," I said.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a new man come," he said. "They have to row him out every day\r\nand back in the evening. He\'s investigating the sea-floor."\r\n\r\nThe newcomer was a Finn. Herr Mack had met him accidentally on board the\r\nsteamer; he had come from Spitzbergen with some collections of scales\r\nand small sea-creatures; they called him Baron. He had been given a big\r\nroom and another smaller one in Herr Mack\'s house. He caused quite a\r\nstir in the place.\r\n\r\n"I am in difficulties about meat; I might ask Edwarda for something for\r\nthis evening," I thought. I walked down to Sirilund. I noticed at once\r\nthat Edwarda was wearing a new dress. She seemed to have grown; her\r\ndress was much longer now.\r\n\r\n"Excuse my not getting up," she said, quite shortly, and offered her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"My daughter is not very well, I\'m sorry to say," said Herr Mack. "A\r\nchill--she has not been taking care of herself... You came to ask about\r\nyour boat, I suppose? I shall have to lend you another one instead. It\'s\r\nnot a new one, but as long as you bail it out every now and then ...\r\nWe\'ve a scientist come to stay with us, you see, and with a man like\r\nthat, of course, you understand... He has no time to spare; works all\r\nday and comes home in the evening. Don\'t go now till he comes; you will\r\nbe interested in meeting him. Here\'s his card, with coronet and all;\r\nhe\'s a Baron. A very nice man. I met him quite by accident."\r\n\r\nAha, I thought, so they don\'t ask you to supper. Well, thank Heaven, I\r\nonly came down by way of a trial; I can go home again--I\'ve still some\r\nfish left in the hut. Enough for a meal, I daresay. _Basta!_\r\n\r\nThe Baron came in. A little man, about forty, with a long, narrow face,\r\nprominent cheek bones, and a thinnish black beard. His glance was sharp\r\nand penetrating, but he wore strong glasses. His shirt studs, too, were\r\nornamented with a little five-pointed coronet, like the one on his card.\r\nHe stooped a little, and his thin hands were blue-veined, but the nails\r\nwere like yellow metal.\r\n\r\n"Delighted, Herr Lieutenant. Have you been here long, may I ask?"\r\n\r\n"A few months."\r\n\r\nA pleasant man. Herr Mack asked him to tell us about his scales and\r\nsea-things, and he did so willingly--told us what kind of clay there was\r\nround Korholmerne--went into his room and fetched a sample of weed from\r\nthe White Sea. He was constantly lifting up his right forefinger and\r\nshifting his thick gold spectacles back and forward on his nose. Herr\r\nMack was most interested. An hour passed.\r\n\r\nThe Baron spoke of my accident--that unfortunate shot. Was I well again\r\nnow? Pleased to hear it.\r\n\r\nNow who had told him of that? I asked:\r\n\r\n"And how did you hear of that, Baron?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, who was it, now? Froeken Mack, I think. Was it not you, Froeken\r\nMack?"\r\n\r\nEdwarda flushed hotly.\r\n\r\nI had come so poor! for days past, a dark misery had weighed me down.\r\nBut at the stranger\'s last words a joy fluttered through me on the\r\ninstant. I did not look at Edwarda, but in my mind I thanked her:\r\nThanks, for having spoken of me, named my name with your tongue, though\r\nit be all valueless to you. _Godnat._\r\n\r\nI took my leave. Edwarda still kept her seat, excusing herself, for\r\npoliteness\' sake, by saying she was unwell. Indifferently she gave me\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nAnd Herr Mack stood chatting eagerly with the Baron. He was talking of\r\nhis grandfather, Consul Mack:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know if I told you before, Baron; this diamond here was a gift\r\nfrom King Carl Johan, who pinned it to my grandfather\'s breast with his\r\nown hands."\r\n\r\nI went out to the front steps; no one saw me to the door. I glanced in\r\npassing through the windows of the sitting-room; and there stood\r\nEdwarda, tall, upright, holding the curtains apart with both hands,\r\nlooking out. I did not bow to her: I forgot everything; a swirl of\r\nconfusion overwhelmed me and drew me hurriedly away.\r\n\r\n"Halt! Stop a moment!" I said to myself, when I reached the woods. God\r\nin Heaven, but there must be an end of this! I felt all hot within on a\r\nsudden, and I groaned. Alas, I had no longer any pride in my heart; I\r\nhad enjoyed Edwarda\'s favour for a week, at the outside, but that was\r\nover long since, and I had not ordered my ways accordingly. From now on,\r\nmy heart should cry to her: Dust, air, earth on my way; God in Heaven,\r\nyes...\r\n\r\nI reached the hut, found my fish, and had a meal.\r\n\r\nHere are you burning out your life for the sake of a worthless\r\nschoolgirl, and your nights are full of desolate dreams. And a hot wind\r\nstands still about your head, a close, foul wind of last year\'s breath.\r\nYet the sky is quivering with the most wonderful blue, and the hills are\r\ncalling. Come, AEsop, _Hei_...\r\n\r\nA week passed. I hired the blacksmith\'s boat and fished for my meals.\r\nEdwarda and the Baron were always together in the evening when he came\r\nhome from his sea trips. I saw them once at the mill. One evening they\r\nboth came by my hut; I drew away from the window and barred the door. It\r\nmade no impression on me whatever to see them together; I shrugged my\r\nshoulders. Another evening I met them on the road, and exchanged\r\ngreetings; I left it to the Baron to notice me first, and merely put up\r\ntwo fingers to my cap, to be discourteous. I walked slowly past them,\r\nand looked carelessly at them as I did so.\r\n\r\nAnother day passed.\r\n\r\nHow many long days had not passed already? I was downcast, dispirited;\r\nmy heart pondered idly over things; even the kindly grey stone by the\r\nhut seemed to wear an expression of sorrow and despair when I went by.\r\nThere was rain in the air; the heat seemed gasping before me wherever I\r\nwent, and I felt the gout in my left foot; I had seen one of Herr Mack\'s\r\nhorses shivering in its harness in the morning; all these things were\r\nsignificant to me as signs of the weather. Best to furnish the house\r\nwell with food while the weather holds, I thought.\r\n\r\nI tied up AEsop, took my fishing tackle and my gun, and went down to the\r\nquay. I was quite unusually troubled in mind.\r\n\r\n"When will the mail-packet be in?" I asked a fisherman there.\r\n\r\n"The mail-packet? In three weeks\' time," he answered.\r\n\r\n"I am expecting my uniform," I said.\r\n\r\nThen I met one of Herr Mack\'s assistants from the store. I shook hands\r\nwith him, and said:\r\n\r\n"Tell me, do you never play whist now at Sirilund?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, often," he answered.\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"I have not been there lately," I said.\r\n\r\nI rowed out to my fishing grounds. The weather was mild, but oppressive.\r\nThe gnats gathered in swarms, and I had to smoke all the time to keep\r\nthem off. The haddock were biting; I fished with two hooks and made a\r\ngood haul. On the way back I shot a brace of guillemots.\r\n\r\nWhen I came in to the quay the blacksmith was there at work. A thought\r\noccurred to me; I asked him:\r\n\r\n"Going up my way?"\r\n\r\n"No," said he, "Herr Mack\'s given me a bit of work to do here that\'ll\r\nkeep me till midnight."\r\n\r\nI nodded, and thought to myself that it was well.\r\n\r\nI took my fish and went off, going round by way of the blacksmith\'s\r\nhouse. Eva was there alone.\r\n\r\n"I have been longing for you with all my heart," I told her. And I was\r\nmoved at the sight of her. She could hardly look me in the face for\r\nwonder. "I love your youth and your good eyes," I said. "Punish me\r\nto-day because I have thought more of another than of you. I tell you, I\r\nhave come here only to see you; you make me happy, I am fond of you. Did\r\nyou hear me calling for you last night?"\r\n\r\n"No," she answered, frightened.\r\n\r\n"I called Edwarda, but it was you I meant. I woke up and heard myself.\r\nYes, it was you I meant; it was only a mistake; I said \'Edwarda,\' but it\r\nwas only by accident. By Heaven, you are my dearest, Eva! Your lips are\r\nso red to-day. Your feet are prettier than Edwarda\'s--just look\r\nyourself and see."\r\n\r\nJoy such as I had never seen in her lit up her face; she made as if to\r\nturn away, but hesitated, and put one arm round my neck.\r\n\r\nWe talked together, sitting all the time on a long bench, talking to\r\neach other of many things. I said:\r\n\r\n"Would you believe it? Edwarda has not learnt to speak properly yet; she\r\ntalks like a child, and says \'more happier.\' I heard her myself. Would\r\nyou say she had a lovely forehead? I do not think so. She has a devilish\r\nforehead. And she does not wash her hands."\r\n\r\n"But we weren\'t going to talk of her any more."\r\n\r\n"Quite right. I forgot."\r\n\r\nA little pause. I was thinking of something, and fell silent.\r\n\r\n"Why are your eyes wet?" asked Eva.\r\n\r\n"She has a lovely forehead, though," I said, "and her hands are always\r\nclean. It was only an accident that they were dirty once. I did not mean\r\nto say what I did." But then I went on angrily, with clenched teeth: "I\r\nsit thinking of you all the time, Eva; but it occurs to me that perhaps\r\nyou have not heard what I am going to tell you now. The first time\r\nEdwarda saw AEsop, she said: \'AEsop--that was the name of a wise man--a\r\nPhrygian, he was.\' Now wasn\'t that simply silly? She had read it in a\r\nbook the same day, I\'m sure of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes," says Eva; "but what of it?"\r\n\r\n"And as far as I remember, she said, too, that AEsop had Xanthus for his\r\nteacher. Hahaha!"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Well, what the devil is the sense of telling a crowd of people that\r\nAEsop had Xanthus for his teacher? I ask you. Oh, you are not in the mood\r\nto-day, Eva, or you would laugh till your sides ached at that."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think it is funny," said Eva, and began laughing forcedly and in\r\nwonder. "But I don\'t understand it as well as you do."\r\n\r\nI sit silent and thoughtful, silent and thoughtful.\r\n\r\n"Do you like best to sit still and not talk?" asked Eva softly. Goodness\r\nshone in her eyes; she passed her hand over my hair.\r\n\r\n"You good, good soul," I broke out, and pressed her close to me. "I know\r\nfor certain I am perishing for love of you; I love you more and more;\r\nthe end of it will be that you must go with me when I go away. You shall\r\nsee. Could you go with me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered.\r\n\r\nI hardly heard that yes, but I felt it in her breath and all through\r\nher. We held each other fiercely.\r\n\r\nAn hour later I kissed Eva good-bye and went away. At the door I meet\r\nHerr Mack.\r\n\r\nHerr Mack himself.\r\n\r\nHe started--stared into the house--stopped there on the doorstep,\r\nstaring in. "Ho!" said he, and could say no more; he seemed thrown\r\naltogether off his balance.\r\n\r\n"You did not expect to find me here," I said, raising my cap.\r\n\r\nEva did not move.\r\n\r\nHerr Mack regained his composure; a curious confidence appeared in his\r\nmanner, and he answered:\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken: I came on purpose to find you. I wish to point out to\r\nyou that from the 1st of April it is forbidden to fire a shot within\r\nhalf a mile of the bird-cliffs. You shot two birds out at the island\r\nto-day; you were seen doing so."\r\n\r\n"I shot two guillemots," I said helplessly. I saw at once that the man\r\nwas in the right.\r\n\r\n"Two guillemots or two eiderducks--it is all the same. You were within\r\nthe prohibited limit."\r\n\r\n"I admit it," I said. "It had not occurred to me before."\r\n\r\n"But it ought to have occurred to you."\r\n\r\n"I also fired off both barrels once in May, at very nearly the same\r\nspot. It was on a picnic one day. And it was done at your own request."\r\n\r\n"That is another matter," answered Herr Mack shortly.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, devil take it, you know what you have to do, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly well," he answered.\r\n\r\nEva held herself in readiness; when I went out, she followed me; she had\r\nput on a kerchief, and walked away from the house; I saw her going down\r\ntowards the quay. Herr Mack walked back home.\r\n\r\nI thought it over. What a mind, to hit on that all at once, and save\r\nhimself! And those piercing eyes of his. A shot, two shots, a brace of\r\nguillemots--a fine, a payment. And then everything, _everything_, would\r\nbe settled with Herr Mack and his house. After all, it was going off so\r\nbeautifully quickly and neatly...\r\n\r\nThe rain was coming down already, in great soft drops. The magpies flew\r\nlow along the ground, and when I came home and turned AEsop loose he\r\nbegan eating the grass. The wind was beginning to rustle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nA league below me is the sea. It is raining, and I am up in the hills.\r\nAn overhanging rock shelters me from the rain. I smoke my pipe, smoke\r\none pipe after another; and every time I light it, the tobacco curls up\r\nlike little worms crawling from the ash. So also with the thoughts that\r\ntwirl in my head. Before me, on the ground, lies a bundle of dry twigs,\r\nfrom the ruin of a bird\'s nest. And as with that nest, so also with my\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nI remember every trifle of that day and the next. Hoho! I was hard put\r\nto it then! ...\r\n\r\nI sit here up in the hills and the sea and the air are voiceful, a\r\nseething and moaning of the wind and weather, cruel to listen to.\r\nFishing boats and small craft show far out with reefed sails, human\r\nbeings on board--making for somewhere, no doubt, and Heaven knows where\r\nall those lives are making for, think I. The sea flings itself up in\r\nfoam, and rolls and rolls, as if inhabited by great fierce figures that\r\nfling their limbs about and roar at one another; nay, a festival of ten\r\nthousand piping devils that duck their heads down between their\r\nshoulders and circle about, lashing the sea white with the tips of their\r\nwings. Far, far out lies a hidden reef, and from that hidden reef rises\r\na white merman, shaking his head after a leaky sailboat making out to\r\nsea before the wind. Hoho! out to sea, out to the desolate sea...\r\n\r\nI am glad to be alone, that none may see my eyes. I lean securely\r\nagainst the wall of rock, knowing that no one can observe me from\r\nbehind. A bird swoops over the crest with a broken cry; at the same\r\nmoment a boulder close by breaks loose and rolls down towards the sea.\r\nAnd I sit there still for a while, I sink into restfulness; a warm sense\r\nof comfort quivers in me because I can sit so pleasantly under shelter\r\nwhile the rain pours down outside. I button up my jacket, thanking God\r\nfor the warmth of it. A little while more. And I fall asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon. I went home; it was still raining. Then--an unexpected\r\nencounter. Edwarda stood there before me on the path. She was wet\r\nthrough, as if she had been out in the rain a long time, but she smiled.\r\nHo! I thought to myself, and my anger rose; I gripped my gun and walked\r\nfiercely although she herself was smiling.\r\n\r\n"_Goddag!_" she called, speaking first.\r\n\r\nI waited till I had come some paces nearer, and said:\r\n\r\n"Fair one, I give you greeting."\r\n\r\nShe started in surprise at my jesting tone. Alas, I knew not what I was\r\nsaying. She smiled timidly, and looked at me.\r\n\r\n"Have you been up in the hills to-day?" she asked. "Then you must be\r\nwet. I have a kerchief here, if you care for it; I can spare it... Oh,\r\nyou don\'t know me." And she cast down her eyes and shook her head when I\r\ndid not take her kerchief.\r\n\r\n"A kerchief?" I answer, grinning in anger and surprise. "But I have a\r\njacket here--won\'t you borrow it? I can spare it--I would have lent it\r\nto anyone. You need not be afraid to take it. I would have lent it to a\r\nfishwife, and gladly."\r\n\r\nI could see that she was eager to hear what I would say. She listened\r\nwith such attention that it made her look ugly; she forgot to hold her\r\nlips together. There she stood with the kerchief in her hand--a white\r\nsilk kerchief which she had taken from her neck. I tore off my jacket in\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake put it on again," she cried. "Don\'t do that! Are you\r\nso angry with me? _Herregud!_ put your jacket on, do, before you get wet\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\nI put on my jacket again.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" I asked sullenly.\r\n\r\n"No--nowhere ... I can\'t understand what made you take off your jacket\r\nlike that ..."\r\n\r\n"What have you done with the Baron to-day?" I went on. "The Count can\'t\r\nbe out at sea on a day like this."\r\n\r\n"Glahn, I just wanted to tell you something ..."\r\n\r\nI interrupted her:\r\n\r\n"May I beg you to convey my respects to the Duke?"\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other. I was ready to break in with further\r\ninterruptions as soon as she opened her mouth. At last a twinge of pain\r\npassed over her face; I turned away and said:\r\n\r\n"Seriously, you should send His Highness packing, Edwarda. He is not the\r\nman for you. I assure you, he has been wondering these last few days\r\nwhether to make you his wife or not--and that is not good enough for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t let us talk about that, please. Glahn, I have been thinking\r\nof you; you could take off your jacket and get wet through for another\'s\r\nsake; I come to you ..."\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders and went on:\r\n\r\n"I should advise you to take the Doctor instead. What have you against\r\nhim? A man in the prime of life, and a clever head--you should think it\r\nover."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but do listen a minute ..."\r\n\r\nAEsop, my dog, was waiting for me in the hut. I took off my cap, bowed\r\nto her again, and said:\r\n\r\n"Fair one, I give you farewell."\r\n\r\nAnd I started off.\r\n\r\nShe gave a cry:\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are tearing my heart out. I came to you to-day; I waited for\r\nyou here, and I smiled when you came. I was nearly out of my mind\r\nyesterday, because of something I had been thinking of all the time; my\r\nhead was in a whirl, and I thought of you all the time. To-day I was\r\nsitting at home, and someone came in; I did not look up, but I knew who\r\nit was. \'I rowed half a mile to-day,\' he said. \'Weren\'t you tired?\' I\r\nasked. \'Oh yes, very tired, and it blistered my hands,\' he said, and was\r\nvery concerned about it. And I thought: Fancy being concerned about\r\nthat! A little after he said: \'I heard someone whispering outside my\r\nwindow last night; it was your maid and one of the store men talking\r\nvery intimately indeed.\' \'Yes, they are to be married,\' I said. \'But\r\nthis was at two o\'clock in the morning!\' \'Well, what of it?\' said I,\r\nand, after a little: \'The night is their own.\' Then he shifted his gold\r\nspectacles a little up his nose, and observed: \'But don\'t you think, at\r\nthat hour of night, it doesn\'t look well?\' Still I didn\'t look up, and\r\nwe sat like that for ten minutes. \'Shall I bring you a shawl to put over\r\nyour shoulders?\' he asked. \'No, thank you,\' I answered. \'If only I dared\r\ntake your little hand,\' he said. I did not answer--I was thinking of\r\nsomething else. He laid a little box in my lap. I opened the box, and\r\nfound a brooch in it. There was a coronet on the brooch, and I counted\r\nten stones in it... Glahn, I have that brooch with me now; will you\r\nlook at it? It is trampled to bits--come, come and see how it is\r\ntrampled to bits... \'Well, and what am I to do with this brooch?\' I\r\nasked. \'Wear it,\' he answered. But I gave him back the brooch, and said,\r\n\'Let me alone--it is another I care for.\' \'What other?\' he asked. \'A\r\nhunter in the woods,\' I said. \'He gave me two lovely feathers once, for\r\na keepsake. Take back your brooch.\' But he would not. Then I looked at\r\nhim for the first time; his eyes were piercing. \'I will not take back\r\nthe brooch. You may do with it as you please; tread on it,\' he said. I\r\nstood up and put the brooch under my heel and trod on it. That was this\r\nmorning... For four hours I waited and waited; after dinner I went out.\r\nHe came to meet me on the road. \'Where are you going?\' he asked. \'To\r\nGlahn,\' I answered,\'to ask him not to forget me...\' Since one o\'clock I\r\nhave been waiting here. I stood by a tree and saw you coming--you were\r\nlike a god. I loved your figure, your beard, and your shoulders, loved\r\neverything about you... Now you are impatient; you want to go, only to\r\ngo; I am nothing to you, you will not look at me ..." I had stopped.\r\nWhen she had finished speaking I began walking on again. I was worn out\r\nwith despair, and I smiled; my heart was hard.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" I said, and stopped again. "You had something to say to me?"\r\n\r\nBut at this scorn of mine she wearied of me.\r\n\r\n"Something to say to you? But I have told you--did you not hear? No,\r\nnothing--I have nothing to tell you any more..."\r\n\r\nHer voice trembled strangely, but that did not move me.\r\n\r\nNext morning Edwarda was standing outside the hut when I went out.\r\n\r\nI had thought it all over during the night, and taken my resolve. Why\r\nshould I let myself be dazzled any longer by this creature of moods, a\r\nfisher-girl, a thing of no culture? Had not her name fastened for long\r\nenough on my heart, sucking it dry? Enough of that!--though it struck me\r\nthat, perhaps, I had come nearer to her by treating her with\r\nindifference and scorn. Oh, how grandly I had scorned her--after she had\r\nmade a long speech of several minutes, to say calmly: "Yes? You had\r\nsomething to say to me...?"\r\n\r\nShe was standing by the big stone. She was in great excitement, and\r\nwould have run towards me; her arms were already opened. But she\r\nstopped, and stood there wringing her hands. I took off my cap and bowed\r\nto her without a word.\r\n\r\n"Just one thing I wanted to say to you to-day, Glahn," she said\r\nentreatingly. And I did not move, but waited, just to hear what she\r\nwould say next. "I hear you have been down at the blacksmith\'s. One\r\nevening it was. Eva was alone in the house."\r\n\r\nI started at that, and answered:\r\n\r\n"Who told you that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t go about spying," she cried. "I heard it last evening; my\r\nfather told me. When I got home all wet through last night, my father\r\nsaid: \'You were rude to the Baron to-day.\' \'No,\' I answered. \'Where have\r\nyou been now?\' he asked again. I answered: \'With Glahn.\'\r\n\r\n"And then my father told me."\r\n\r\nI struggled with my despair; I said:\r\n\r\n"What is more, Eva has been here."\r\n\r\n"Has she been here? In the hut?"\r\n\r\n"More than once. I made her go in. We talked together."\r\n\r\n"Here too?"\r\n\r\nPause. "Be firm!" I said to myself; and then, aloud:\r\n\r\n"Since you are so kind as to mix yourself up in my affairs, I will not\r\nbe behindhand. I suggested yesterday that you should take the Doctor;\r\nhave you thought it over? For really, you know, the prince is simply\r\nimpossible."\r\n\r\nHer eyes lit with anger. "He is not, I tell you," she cried\r\npassionately. "No, he is better than you; he can move about in a house\r\nwithout breaking cups and glasses; he leaves my shoes alone. Yes! He\r\nknows how to move in society; but you are ridiculous--I am ashamed of\r\nyou--you are unendurable--do you understand that?"\r\n\r\nHer words struck deep; I bowed my head and said:\r\n\r\n"You are right; I am not good at moving in society. Be merciful. You do\r\nnot understand me; I live in the woods by choice--that is my happiness.\r\nHere, where I am all alone, it can hurt no one that I am as I am; but\r\nwhen I go among others, I have to use all my will power to be as I\r\nshould. For two years now I have been so little among people at all..."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no saying what mad thing you will do next," she went on. "And\r\nit is intolerable to be constantly looking after you."\r\n\r\nHow mercilessly she said it! A very bitter pain passed through me. I\r\nalmost toppled before her violence. Edwarda had not yet done; she went\r\non:\r\n\r\n"You might get Eva to look after you, perhaps. It\'s a pity though, that\r\nshe\'s married."\r\n\r\n"Eva! Eva married, did you say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, married!"\r\n\r\n"Why, who is her husband?"\r\n\r\n"Surely you know that. She is the blacksmith\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"I thought she was his daughter."\r\n\r\n"No, she is his wife. Do you think I am lying to you?"\r\n\r\nI had not thought about it at all; I was simply astonished. I just stood\r\nthere thinking: Is Eva married?\r\n\r\n"So you have made a happy choice," says Edwarda.\r\n\r\nWell, there seemed no end to the business. I was trembling with\r\nindignation, and I said:\r\n\r\n"But you had better take the Doctor, as I said. Take a friend\'s advice;\r\nthat prince of yours is an old fool." And in my excitement I lied about\r\nhim, exaggerated his age, declared he was bald, that he was almost\r\ntotally blind; I asserted, moreover, that he wore that coronet thing in\r\nhis shirt front wholly and solely to show off his nobility. "As for me,\r\nI have not cared to make his acquaintance, there is nothing in him of\r\nmark at all; he lacks the first principles; he is nothing."\r\n\r\n"But he is something, he is something," she cried, and her voice broke\r\nwith anger. "He is far more than you think, you thing of the woods. You\r\nwait. Oh, he shall talk to you--I will ask him myself. You don\'t believe\r\nI love him, but you shall see you are mistaken. I will marry him; I will\r\nthink of him night and day. Mark what I say: I love him. Let Eva come if\r\nshe likes--hahaha! Heavens, let her come--it is less than nothing to me.\r\nAnd now let me get away from here..."\r\n\r\nShe began walking down the path from the hut; she took a few small\r\nhurried steps, turned round, her face still pale as death, and moaned:\r\n"And let me never see your face again."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaves were yellowing; the potato-plants had grown to full height and\r\nstood in flower; the shooting season came round again; I shot hare and\r\nptarmigan and grouse; one day I shot an eagle. Calm, open sky, cool\r\nnights, many clear, clear tones and dear sounds in the woods and fields.\r\nThe earth was resting, vast and peaceful...\r\n\r\n"I have not heard anything from Herr Mack about the two guillemots I\r\nshot," I said to the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"You can thank Edwarda for that," he said. "I know. I heard that she\r\nset herself against it."\r\n\r\n"I do not thank her for it," said I...\r\n\r\nIndian summer--Indian summer. The stars lay like belts in through the\r\nyellowing woods; a new star came every day. The moon showed like a\r\nshadow; a shadow of gold dipped in silver...\r\n\r\n"Heaven help you, Eva, are you married?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you know that?"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t know."\r\n\r\nShe pressed my hand silently.\r\n\r\n"God help you, child, what are we to do now?" "What _you_ will. Perhaps\r\nyou are not going away just yet; I will be happy as long as you are\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"No, Eva."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--only as long as you are here."\r\n\r\nShe looked forsaken, kept pressing my hand.\r\n\r\n"No, Eva. Go--never any more!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNights pass and days come--three days already since this last talk. Eva\r\ncomes by with a load. How much wood has that child carried home from\r\nthe forest this summer alone?\r\n\r\n"Set the load down, Eva, and let me see if your eyes are as blue as\r\never."\r\n\r\nHer eyes were red.\r\n\r\n"No--smile again, Eva! I can resist no more; I am your, I am yours..."\r\n\r\nEvening. Eva sings, I hear her singing, and a warmth goes through me.\r\n\r\n"You are singing this evening, child?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am happy."\r\n\r\nAnd being smaller than I, she jumps up a little to put her arms round my\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n"But, Eva, you have scratched your hands. _Herregud_! oh, if you had not\r\nscratched them so!"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter."\r\n\r\nHer face beams wonderfully.\r\n\r\n"Eva, have you spoken to Herr Mack?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, once."\r\n\r\n"What did he say, and what did you?"\r\n\r\n"He is so hard with us now; he makes my husband work day and night down\r\nat the quay, and keeps me at all sorts of jobs as well. He has ordered\r\nme to do man\'s work now."\r\n\r\n"Why does he do that?"\r\n\r\nEva looks down.\r\n\r\n"Why does he do that, Eva?"\r\n\r\n"Because I love you."\r\n\r\n"But how could he know?"\r\n\r\n"I told him."\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n"Would to Heaven he were not so harsh with you, Eva."\r\n\r\n"But it doesn\'t matter. It doesn\'t matter at all now."\r\n\r\nAnd her voice is like a little tremulous song in the woods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe woods more yellow still. It is drawing towards autumn now; a few\r\nmore stars have come in the sky, and from now on the moon looks like a\r\nshadow of silver dipped in gold. There is no cold; nothing, only a cool\r\nstillness and a flow of life in the woods. Every tree stands in silent\r\nthought. The berries are ripe.\r\n\r\nThen--the twenty-second of August and the three iron nights. [Footnote:\r\n_Joernnaetter_. Used of the nights in August when the first frosts\r\nappear.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first iron night.\r\n\r\nAt nine the sun sets. A dull darkness settles over the earth, a star or\r\nso can be seen; two hours later there is a glow of the moon. I wander\r\nup in the woods with my gun and my dog. I light a fire, and the light of\r\nthe flames shines in between the fir-trunks. There is no frost.\r\n\r\n"The first iron night!" I say. And a confused, passionate delight in the\r\ntime and the place sends a strange shiver through me...\r\n\r\n"Hail, men and beasts and birds, to the lonely night in the woods, in\r\nthe woods! Hail to the darkness and God\'s murmuring between the trees,\r\nto the sweet, simple melody of silence in my ears, to green leaves and\r\nyellow! Hail to the life-sound I hear; a snout against the grass, a dog\r\nsniffing over the ground! A wild hail to the wildcat lying crouched,\r\nsighting and ready to spring on a sparrow in the dark, in the dark! Hail\r\nto the merciful silence upon earth, to the stars and the half moon; ay,\r\nto them and to it!" ...\r\n\r\nI rise and listen. No one has heard me. I sit down again.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for the lonely night, for the hills, the rush of the darkness\r\nand the sea through my heart! Thanks for my life, for my breath, for the\r\nboon of being alive to-night; thanks from my heart for these! Hear, east\r\nand west, oh, hear. It is the eternal God. This silence murmuring in my\r\nears is the blood of all Nature seething; it is God weaving through the\r\nworld and me. I see a glistening gossamer thread in the light of my\r\nfire; I hear a boat rowing across the harbour; the northern lights flare\r\nover the heavens to the north. By my immortal soul, I am full of thanks\r\nthat it is I who am sitting here!"\r\n\r\nSilence. A fir cone falls dully to the ground. A fir cone fell! I think\r\nto myself. The moon is high, the fire flickers over the half-burned\r\nbrands and is dying. And in the late night I wander home.\r\n\r\nThe second iron night; the same stillness and mild weather. My soul is\r\npondering. I walk mechanically over to a tree, pull my cap deep down\r\nover my eyes, and lean against that tree, with hands clasped behind my\r\nneck. I gazed and think; the flame from my fire dazzles my eyes, and I\r\ndo not feel it. I stand in that stupor for a while, looking at the fire;\r\nmy legs fail me first, and grow tired; thoroughly stiff, I sit down. Not\r\ntill then do I think of what I have been doing. Why should I stare so\r\nlong at the fire?\r\n\r\nAEsop lifts his head and listens; he hears footsteps; Eva appears among\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\n"I am very thoughtful and sad this evening," I say.\r\n\r\nAnd in sympathy she makes no answer.\r\n\r\n"I love three things," I go on. "I love a dream of love I once had; I\r\nlove you; and I love this spot of ground."\r\n\r\n"And which do you love most?"\r\n\r\n"The dream."\r\n\r\nAll still again. AEsop knows Eva; he lays his head on one side and looks\r\nat her. I murmur:\r\n\r\n"I saw a girl on the road to-day; she walked arm in arm with her lover.\r\nThe girl looked towards me, and could scarcely keep from laughing as I\r\npassed."\r\n\r\n"What was she laughing at?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. At me, I suppose. Why do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Did you know her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I bowed."\r\n\r\n"And didn\'t she know you?"\r\n\r\n"No, she acted as if she didn\'t know me... But why do you sit there\r\nworming things out of me? It is not a nice thing to do. You will not get\r\nme to tell you her name."\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\nI murmur again:\r\n\r\n"What was she laughing at? She is a flirt; but what was she laughing at?\r\nWhat had I done to harm her?"\r\n\r\nEva answers:\r\n\r\n"It was cruel of her to laugh at you."\r\n\r\n"No, it was not cruel of her," I cry. "How dare you sit there speaking\r\nill of her? She never did an unkind thing; it was only right that she\r\nshould laugh at me. Be quiet, devil take you, and leave me in peace--do\r\nyou hear?"\r\n\r\nAnd Eva, terrified, leaves me in peace. I look at her, and repent my\r\nharsh words at once; I fall down before her; wringing my hands.\r\n\r\n"Go home, Eva. It is you I love most; how could I love a dream? It was\r\nonly a jest; it is you I love. But go home now; I will come to you\r\nto-morrow; remember, I am yours; yes, do not forget it. Good-night."\r\n\r\nAnd Eva goes home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third iron night, a night of extremes! tension. If only there were\r\na little frost! Instead, still heat after the sun of the day; the night\r\nis like a lukewarm marsh. I light my fire...\r\n\r\n"Eva, it can be a delight at times to be dragged by the hair. So\r\nstrangely can the mind of a man be warped. He can be dragged by the hair\r\nover hill and dale, and if asked what is happening, can answer in\r\necstasy: \'I am being dragged by the hair!\' And if anyone asks: \'But\r\nshall I not help you, release you?\' he answers: \'No.\' And if they ask:\r\n\'But how can you endure it?\' he answers: \'I can endure it, for I love\r\nthe hand that drags me.\' Eva, do you know what it is to hope?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so."\r\n\r\n"Look you, Eva, hope is a strange thing, a very strange thing. You can\r\ngo out one morning along the road, hoping to meet one whom you are fond\r\nof. And do you? No. Why not? Because that one is busy that morning--is\r\nsomewhere else, perhaps... Once I got to know an old blind Lapp up in\r\nthe hills. For fifty-eight years he had seen nothing, and now he was\r\nover seventy. It seemed to him that his sight was getting better little\r\nby little; getting on gradually, he thought. If all went well he would\r\nbe able to make out the sun in a few years\' time. His hair was still\r\nblack, but his eyes were quite white. When we sat in his hut, smoking,\r\nhe would tell of all the things he had seen before he went blind. He\r\nwas hardy and strong; without feeling, indestructible; and he kept his\r\nhope. When I was going, he came out with me, and began pointing in\r\ndifferent ways. \'There\'s the south,\' he said, \'and there\'s north. Now\r\nyou go that way first, and when you get a little way down, turn off that\r\nway.\' \'Quite right,\' I said. And at that the Lapp laughed contentedly,\r\nand said: \'There! I did not know that forty or fifty years back, so I\r\nmust see better now than I used to--yes, it is improving all the time.\'\r\nAnd then he crouched down and crept into his hut again--the same old\r\nhut, his home on earth. And he sat down by the fire as before, full of\r\nhope that in some few years he would be able to make out the sun...\r\nEva, \'tis strange about hope. Here am I, for instance, hoping all the\r\ntime that I may forget the one I did not meet on the road this\r\nmorning..."\r\n\r\n"You talk so strangely."\r\n\r\n"It is the third of the iron nights. I promise you, Eva, to be a\r\ndifferent man to-morrow. Let me be alone now. You will not know me again\r\nto-morrow, I shall laugh and kiss you, my own sweet girl. Just\r\nthink--only this one night more, a few hours--and then I shall be a\r\ndifferent man. _Godnat_, Eva."\r\n\r\n_"Godnat."_\r\n\r\nI lie down closer to the fire, and look at the flames. A pine cone falls\r\nfrom the branch; a dry twig or so falls too. The night is like a\r\nboundless depth. I close my eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour, my senses begin swinging in a certain rhythm. I am\r\nringing in tune with the great stillness--ringing with it. I look at the\r\nhalf-moon; it stands in the sky like a white scale, and I have a feeling\r\nof love for it; I can feel myself blushing. "It is the moon!" I say\r\nsoftly and passionately; "it is the moon!" and my heart strikes toward\r\nit in a soft throbbing. So for some minutes. It is blowing a little; a\r\nstranger wind comes to me a mysterious current of air. What is it? I\r\nlook round, but see no one. The wind calls me, and my soul bows\r\nacknowledging the call; and I feel myself lifted into the air, pressed\r\nto an invisible breast; my eyes are dewed, I tremble--God is standing\r\nnear, watching me. Again several minutes pass. I turn my head round; the\r\nstranger wind is gone, and I see something like the back of a spirit\r\nwandering silently in through the woods...\r\n\r\nI struggle a short while with a heavy melancholy; I was worn out with\r\nemotions; I am deathly tired, and I sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke the night was past. Alas, I had been going about for a long\r\ntime in a sad state, full of fever, on the verge of falling down\r\nstricken with some sickness or other. Often things had seemed upside\r\ndown. I had been looking at everything through inflamed eyes. A deep\r\nmisery had possessed me.\r\n\r\nIt was over now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was autumn. The summer was gone. It passed as quickly as it had come;\r\nah, how quickly it was gone! The days were cold now. I went out shooting\r\nand fishing--sang songs in the woods. And there were days with a thick\r\nmist that came floating in from the sea, damming up everything behind a\r\nwall of murk.\r\n\r\nOne such day something happened. I lost my way, blundered through into\r\nthe woods of the annexe, and came to the Doctor\'s house. There were\r\nvisitors there--the young ladies I had met before--young people dancing,\r\njust like madcap foals.\r\n\r\nA carriage came rolling up and stopped outside the gate; Edwarda was in\r\nit. She started at sight of me. "Good-bye," I said quietly. But the\r\nDoctor held me back. Edwarda was troubled by my presence at first, and\r\nlooked down when I spoke; afterwards, she bore with me, and even went so\r\nfar as to ask me a question about something or other. She was strikingly\r\npale; the mist lay grey and cold upon her face. She did not get out of\r\nthe carriage.\r\n\r\n"I have come on an errand," she said. "I come from the parish church,\r\nand none of you were there to-day; they said you were here. I have been\r\ndriving for hours to find you. We are having a little party\r\nto-morrow--the Baron is going away next week--and I have been told to\r\ninvite you all. There will be dancing too. To-morrow evening."\r\n\r\nThey all bowed and thanked her.\r\n\r\nTo me, she went on:\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t stay away, will you? Don\'t send a note at the last minute\r\nmaking some excuse." She did not say that to any of the others. A little\r\nafter she drove away.\r\n\r\nI was so moved by this unexpected meeting that for a little while I was\r\nsecretly mad with joy. Then I took leave of the Doctor and his guests\r\nand set off for home. How gracious she was to me, how gracious she was\r\nto me! What could I do for her in return? My hands felt helpless; a\r\nsweet cold went through my wrists. _Herregud!_ I thought to myself, here\r\nam I with my limbs hanging helpless for joy; I cannot even clench my\r\nhands; I can only find tears in my eyes for my own helplessness. What is\r\nto be done about it?\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening when I reached home. I went round by the quay\r\nand asked a fisherman if the post-packet would not be in by to-morrow\r\nevening. Alas, no, the post-packet would not be in till some time next\r\nweek. I hurried up to the hut and began looking over my best suit. I\r\ncleaned it up and made it look decent; there were holes in it here and\r\nthere, and I wept and darned them.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished, I lay down on the bed. This rest lasted only a\r\nmoment. Then a thought struck me, and I sprang up and stood in the\r\nmiddle of the floor, dazed. The whole thing was just another trick! I\r\nshould not have been invited if I had not happened to be there when the\r\nothers were asked. And, moreover, she had given me the plainest possible\r\nhint to stay away--to send a note at the last moment, making some\r\nexcuse...\r\n\r\nI did not sleep all that night, and when morning came I went to the\r\nwoods cold, sleepless, and feverish. Ho, having a party at Sirilund!\r\nWhat then? I would neither go nor send any excuse. Herr Mack was a very\r\nthoughtful man; he was giving this party for the Baron; but I was not\r\ngoing--let them understand that! ...\r\n\r\nThe mist lay thick over valley and hills; a clammy rime gathered on my\r\nclothes and made them heavy, my face was cold and wet. Only now and then\r\ncame a breath of wind to make the sleeping mists rise and fall, rise and\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon, and getting dark; the mist hid everything\r\nfrom my eyes, and I had no sun to show the way. I drifted about for\r\nhours on the way home, but there was no hurry. I took the wrong road\r\nwith the greatest calmness, and came upon unknown places in the woods.\r\nAt last I stood my gun against a tree and consulted my compass. I marked\r\nout my way carefully and started off. It would be about eight or nine\r\no\'clock.\r\n\r\nThen something happened.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour, I heard music through the fog, and a few minutes\r\nlater I knew where I was: quite close to the main building at Sirilund.\r\nHad my compass misled me to the very place I was trying to avoid? A\r\nwell-known voice called me--the Doctor\'s. A minute later I was being led\r\nin.\r\n\r\nMy gun-barrel had perhaps affected the compass and, alas, set it wrong.\r\nThe same thing has happened to me since--one day this year. I do not\r\nknow what to think. Then, too, it may have been fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the evening I had a bitter feeling that I should not have come to\r\nthat party. My coming was hardly noticed at all, they were all so\r\noccupied with one another; Edwarda hardly bade me welcome. I began\r\ndrinking hard because I knew I was unwelcome; and yet I did not go away.\r\n\r\nHerr Mack smiled a great deal and put on his most amiable expression; he\r\nwas in evening dress, and looked well. He was now here, now there,\r\nmingling with his half a hundred guests, dancing one dance now and then,\r\njoking and laughing. There were secrets lurking in his eyes.\r\n\r\nA whirl of music and voices sounded through the house. Five of the rooms\r\nwere occupied by the guests, besides the big room where they were\r\ndancing. Supper was over when I arrived. Busy maids were running to and\r\nfro with glasses and wines, brightly polished coffee-pots, cigars and\r\npipes, cakes and fruit. There was no sparing of anything. The\r\nchandeliers in the rooms were filled with extra-thick candles that had\r\nbeen made for the occasion; the new oil lamps were lit as well. Eva was\r\nhelping in the kitchen; I caught a glimpse of her. To think that Eva\r\nshould be here too!\r\n\r\nThe Baron received a great deal of attention, though he was quiet and\r\nmodest and did not put himself forward. He, too, was in evening dress;\r\nthe tails of his coat were miserably crushed from the packing. He talked\r\na good deal with Edwarda, followed her with his eyes, drank with her,\r\nand called her Froeken, as he did the daughters of the Dean and of the\r\ndistrict surgeon. I felt the same dislike of him as before, and could\r\nhardly look at him without turning my eyes away with a wretched silly\r\ngrimace. When he spoke to me, I answered shortly and pressed my lips\r\ntogether after.\r\n\r\nI happen to remember one detail of that evening. I stood talking to a\r\nyoung lady, a fair-haired girl; and I said something or told some story\r\nthat made her laugh. It can hardly have been anything remarkable, but\r\nperhaps, in my excited state, I told it more amusingly than I remember\r\nnow--at any rate, I have forgotten it. But when I turned round, there\r\nwas Edwarda standing behind me. She gave me a glance of recognition.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I noticed that she drew the fair girl aside to find out what\r\nI had said. I cannot say how that look of Edwarda\'s cheered me, after I\r\nhad been going about from room to room like a sort of outcast all the\r\nevening; I felt better at once, and spoke to several people, and was\r\nentertaining. As far as I am aware, I did nothing awkward or wrong...\r\n\r\nI was standing outside on the steps. Eva came carrying some things from\r\none of the rooms. She saw me, came out, and touched my hands swiftly\r\nwith one of hers; then she smiled and went in again. Neither of us had\r\nspoken. When I turned to go in after her, there was Edwarda in the\r\npassage, watching me. She also said nothing. I went into the room.\r\n\r\n"Fancy--Lieutenant Glahn amuses himself having meetings with the\r\nservants on the steps!" said Edwarda suddenly, out loud. She was\r\nstanding in the doorway. Several heard what she said. She laughed, as\r\nif speaking in jest, but her face was very pale.\r\n\r\nI made no answer to this; I only murmured:\r\n\r\n"It was accidental; she just came out, and we met in the passage..."\r\n\r\nSome time passed--an hour, perhaps. A glass was upset over a lady\'s\r\ndress. As soon as Edwarda saw it, she cried:\r\n\r\n"What has happened? That was Glahn, of course."\r\n\r\nI had not done it: I was standing at the other end of the room when it\r\nhappened. After that I drank pretty hard again, and kept near the door,\r\nto be out of the way of the dancers.\r\n\r\nThe Baron still had the ladies constantly round him. He regretted that\r\nhis collections were packed away, so that he could not show them--that\r\nbunch of weed from the White Sea, the clay from Korholmerne, highly\r\ninteresting stone formations from the bottom of the sea. The ladies\r\npeeped curiously at his shirt studs, the five-pointed coronets--they\r\nmeant that he was a Baron, of course. All this time the Doctor created\r\nno sensation; even his witty oath, _Doed og Pinsel_, no longer had any\r\neffect. But when Edwarda was speaking, he was always on the spot,\r\ncorrecting her language, embarrassing her with little shades of meaning,\r\nkeeping her down with calm superiority.\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n"... until I go over the valley of death."\r\n\r\nAnd the Doctor asked:\r\n\r\n"Over what?"\r\n\r\n"The valley of death. Isn\'t that what it\'s called--the valley of death?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard of the river of death. I presume that is what you mean."\r\n\r\nLater on, she talked of having something guarded like a ...\r\n\r\n"Dragon," put in the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes, like a dragon," she answered.\r\n\r\nBut the Doctor said:\r\n\r\n"You can thank me for saving you there. I am sure you were going to say\r\nArgus."\r\n\r\nThe Baron raised his eyebrows and looked at the Doctor in surprise\r\nthrough his thick glasses, as if he had never heard such ridiculous\r\nthings. But the Doctor paid no heed. What did he care for the Baron?\r\n\r\nI still lurked by the door. The dancers swept through the room. I\r\nmanaged to start a conversation with the governess from the vicarage. We\r\ntalked about the war, the state of affairs in the Crimea, the happenings\r\nin France, Napoleon as Emperor, his protection of the Turks; the young\r\nlady had read the papers that summer, and could tell me the news. At\r\nlast we sat down on a sofa and went on talking.\r\n\r\nEdwarda, passing, stopped in front of us. Suddenly she said:\r\n\r\n"You must forgive me, Lieutenant, for surprising you outside like that.\r\nI will never do it again."\r\n\r\nAnd she laughed again, and did not look at me.\r\n\r\n"Edwarda," I said, "do stop."\r\n\r\nShe had spoken very formally, which meant no good, and her look was\r\nmalicious. I thought of the Doctor, and shrugged my shoulders\r\ncarelessly, as he would have done. She said:\r\n\r\n"But why don\'t you go out in the kitchen? Eva is there. I think you\r\nought to stay there."\r\n\r\nAnd there was hate in her eyes.\r\n\r\nI had not been to parties often; certainly I had never before heard such\r\na tone at any of the few I had been to. I said:\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you afraid of being misunderstood, Edwarda?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but how? Possibly, of course, but how?"\r\n\r\n"You sometimes speak without thinking. Just now, for instance, it\r\n_seemed_ to me as if you were actually telling me to go to the kitchen\r\nand stay there; and that, of course, must be a misunderstanding--I know\r\nquite well that you did not intend to be so rude."\r\n\r\nShe walked a few paces away from us. I could see by her manner that she\r\nwas thinking all the time of what I had said. She turned round, came\r\nback, and said breathlessly:\r\n\r\n"It was no misunderstanding, Lieutenant; you heard correctly--I did tell\r\nyou to go to the kitchen."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Edwarda!" broke out the terrified governess.\r\n\r\nAnd I began talking again about the war and the state of affairs in the\r\nCrimea; but my thoughts were far distant. I was no longer intoxicated,\r\nonly hopelessly confused. The earth seemed fading from under my feet,\r\nand I lost my composure, as at so many unfortunate times before. I got\r\nup from the sofa and made as if to go out. The Doctor stopped me.\r\n\r\n"I have just been hearing your praises," he said.\r\n\r\n"Praises! From whom?"\r\n\r\n"From Edwarda. She is still standing away off there in the corner,\r\nlooking at you with glowing eyes. I shall never forget it; her eyes were\r\nabsolutely in love, and she said out loud that she admired you."\r\n\r\n"Good," I said with a laugh. Alas, there was not a clear thought in my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nI went up to the Baron, bent over him as if to whisper something--and\r\nwhen I was close enough, I spat in his ear. He sprang up and stared\r\nidiotically at me. Afterwards I saw him telling Edwarda what had\r\noccurred; I saw how disgusted she was. She thought, perhaps, of her shoe\r\nthat I had thrown into the water, of the cups and glasses I had so\r\nunfortunately managed to break, and of all the other breaches of good\r\ntaste I had committed; doubtless all those things flashed into her mind\r\nagain. I was ashamed. It was all over with me; whichever way I turned, I\r\nmet frightened and astonished looks. And I stole away from Sirilund,\r\nwithout a word of leave-taking or of thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baron is going away. Well and good: I will load my gun, go up into\r\nthe hills, and fire a salvo in his honour and Edwarda\'s. I will bore a\r\ndeep hole in a rock and blow up a mountain in his honour and Edwarda\'s.\r\nAnd a great boulder shall roll down the hillside and dash mightily into\r\nthe sea just as his ship is passing by. I know a spot--a channel down\r\nthe hillside--where rocks have rolled before and made a clean road to\r\nthe sea. Far below there is a little boat-house.\r\n\r\n"Two mining drills," I say to the smith.\r\n\r\nAnd the smith whets two drills...\r\n\r\nEva has been put to driving back and forth between the mill and the\r\nquay, with one of Herr Mack\'s horses. She has to do a man\'s work,\r\ntransporting sacks of corn and flour. I meet her; her face is\r\nwonderfully fresh and glowing. Dear God, how tender and warm is her\r\nsmile! Every evening I meet her.\r\n\r\n"You look as if you had no troubles, Eva, my love."\r\n\r\n"You call me your love! I am an ignorant woman, but I will be true to\r\nyou. I will be true to you if I should die for it. Herr Mack grows\r\nharsher and harsher every day, but I do not mind it; he is furious, but\r\nI do not answer him. He took hold of my arm and went grey with fury.\r\nOne thing troubles me."\r\n\r\n"And what is it that troubles you?" "Herr Mack threatens you. He says to\r\nme: \'Aha, it\'s that lieutenant you\'ve got in your head all the time!\' I\r\nanswer: \'Yes, I am his.\' Then he says: \'Ah, you wait. I\'ll soon get rid\r\nof him.\' He said that yesterday."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter; let him threaten..." And with closed eyes she\r\nthrows her arms about my neck. A quiver passes through her. The horse\r\nstands waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI sit up in the hills, mining. The autumn air is crystal about me. The\r\nstrokes of my drill ring steady and even. AEsop looks at me with\r\nwondering eyes. Wave after wave of content swells through my breast. No\r\none knows that I am here among the lonely hills.\r\n\r\nThe birds of passage have gone; a happy journey and welcome back again!\r\nTitmouse and blackcap and a hedge-sparrow or so live now alone in the\r\nbush and undergrowth: tuitui! All is so curiously changed--the dwarf\r\nbirch bleeds redly against the grey stones, a harebell here and there\r\nshows among the heather, swaying and whispering a little song: sh! But\r\nhigh above all hovers an eagle with outstretched neck, on his way to the\r\ninland ridges.\r\n\r\nAnd the evening comes; I lay my drill and my hammer in under the rock\r\nand stop to rest. All things are glooming now. The moon glides up in the\r\nnorth; the rocks cast gigantic shadows. The moon is full; it looks like\r\na glowing island, like a round riddle of brass that I pass by and wonder\r\nat. AEsop gets up and is restless.\r\n\r\n"What is it, AEsop? As for me, I am tired of my sorrow; I will forget it,\r\ndrown it. Lie still, AEsop, I tell you; I will not be pestered. Eva asks:\r\n\'Do you think of me sometimes?\' I answer: \'Always.\' Eva asks again: \'And\r\nis it any joy to you, to think of me?\' I answer: \'Always a joy, never\r\nanything but a joy.\' Then says Eva: \'Your hair is turning grey.\' I\r\nanswer: \'Yes, it is beginning to turn grey.\' But Eva says: \'Is it\r\nsomething you think about, that is turning it grey?\' And to that I\r\nanswer: \'Maybe.\' At last Eva says: \'Then you do not think only of me...\'\r\nAEsop, lie still; I will tell you about something else instead..."\r\n\r\nBut AEsop stands sniffing excitedly down towards the valley, pointing,\r\nand dragging at my clothes. When at last I get up and follow, he cannot\r\nget along fast enough. A flush of red shows in the sky above the woods.\r\nI go on faster; and there before my eyes is a glow, a huge fire. I stop\r\nand stare at it, go on a few steps and stare again.\r\n\r\nMy hut is ablaze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fire was Herr Mack\'s doing. I saw through it from the first. I lost\r\nmy skins and my birds\' wings, I lost my stuffed eagle; everything was\r\ndestroyed. What now? I lay out for two nights under the open sky,\r\nwithout going to Sirilund to ask for shelter. At last I rented a\r\ndeserted fisher-hut by the quay. I stopped the cracks with dried moss,\r\nand slept on a load of red horseberry ling from the hills. Once more my\r\nneeds were filled.\r\n\r\nEdwarda sent me a message to say she had heard of my misfortune and that\r\nshe offered me, on her father\'s behalf, a room at Sirilund. Edwarda\r\ntouched! Edwarda generous! I sent no answer. Thank Heaven, I was no\r\nlonger without shelter, and it gave me a proud joy to make no answer to\r\nEdwarda\'s offer. I met her on the road, with the Baron; they were\r\nwalking arm in arm. I looked them both in the face and bowed as I\r\npassed. She stopped, and asked:\r\n\r\n"So you will not come and stay with us, Lieutenant?"\r\n\r\n"I am already settled in my new place," I said, and stopped also.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me; her bosom was heaving. "You would have lost nothing\r\nby coming to us," she said.\r\n\r\nThankfulness moved in my heart, but I could not speak.\r\n\r\nThe Baron walked on slowly.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you do not want to see me any more," she said.\r\n\r\n"I thank you, Edwarda, for offering me shelter when my house was\r\nburned," I said. "It was the kinder of you, since your father was hardly\r\nwilling." And with bared head I thanked her for her offer.\r\n\r\n"In God\'s name, will you not see me again, Glahn?" she said suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe Baron was calling.\r\n\r\n"The Baron is calling," I said, and took off my hat again respectfully.\r\n\r\nAnd I went up into the hills, to my mining. Nothing, nothing should\r\nmake me lose my self-possession any more. I met Eva. "There, what did I\r\nsay?" I cried. "Herr Mack cannot drive me away. He has burned my hut,\r\nand I already have another hut..." She was carrying a tar-bucket and\r\nbrush. "What now, Eva?"\r\n\r\nHerr Mack had a boat in a shed under the cliff, and had ordered her to\r\ntar it. He watched her every step--she had to obey.\r\n\r\n"But why in the shed there? Why not at the quay?"\r\n\r\n"Herr Mack ordered it so..\r\n\r\n"Eva, Eva, my love, they make a slave of you and you do not complain.\r\nSee! now you are smiling again, and life streams through your smile, for\r\nall that you are a slave."\r\n\r\nWhen I got up to my mining work, I found a surprise. I could see that\r\nsomeone had been on the spot. I examined the tracks and recognised the\r\nprint of Herr Mack\'s long, pointed shoes. What could he be ferreting\r\nabout here for? I thought to myself, and looked round. No one to be\r\nseen--I had no suspicion.\r\n\r\nAnd I fell to hammering with my drill, never dreaming what harm I did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mail-packet came; it brought my uniform; it was to take the Baron\r\nand all his cases of scales and seaweeds on board. Now it was loading\r\nup barrels of herrings and oil at the quay; towards evening it would be\r\noff again.\r\n\r\nI took my gun and put a heavy load of powder in each barrel. When I had\r\ndone that, I nodded to myself. I went up into the hills and filled my\r\nmine with powder as well; I nodded again. Now everything was ready. I\r\nlay down to wait.\r\n\r\nI waited for hours. All the time I could hear the steamer\'s winches at\r\nwork hoisting and lowering. It was already growing dusk. At last the\r\nwhistle sounded: the cargo was on board, the ship was putting off. I\r\nstill had some minutes to wait. The moon was not up, and I stared like\r\na madman through the gloom of the evening.\r\n\r\nWhen the first point of the bow thrust out past the islet, I lit my slow\r\nmatch and stepped hurriedly away. A minute passed. Suddenly there was a\r\nroar--a spurt of stone fragments in the air--the hillside trembled, and\r\nthe rock hurtled crashing down the abyss. The hills all round gave echo.\r\nI picked up my gun and fired off one barrel; the echo answered time and\r\ntime again. After a moment I fired the second barrel too; the air\r\ntrembled at the salute, and the echo flung the noise out into the wide\r\nworld; it was as if all the hills had united in a shout for the vessel\r\nsailing away.\r\n\r\nA little time passed; the air grew still, the echoes died away in all\r\nthe hills, and earth lay silent again. The ship disappeared in the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nI was still trembling with a strange excitement. I took my drills and\r\nmy gun under my arm and set off with slack knees down the hillside. I\r\ntook the shortest way, marking the smoking track left by my avalanche.\r\nAEsop followed me, shaking his head all the time and sneezing at the\r\nsmell of burning.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down to the shed, I found a sight that filled me with\r\nviolent emotion. A boat lay there, crushed by the falling rock. And\r\nEva--Eva lay beside it, mangled and broken, dashed to pieces by the\r\nshock--torn beyond recognition. Eva--lying there, dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat more have I to write? I fired no shot for many days; I had no food,\r\nand did not eat at all; I sat in my shed. Eva was carried to the church\r\nin Herr Mack\'s white-painted house-boat. I went there overland on\r\nfoot...\r\n\r\nEva is dead. Do you remember her little girlish head, with hair like a\r\nnun\'s? She came so quietly, laid down her head and smiled. And did you\r\nsee how full of life that smile was? Be still, AEsop; I remember a\r\nstrange saga story, of four generations ago, of Iselin\'s time, when\r\nStamer was a priest.\r\n\r\nA girl sat captive in a stone tower. She loved a lord. Why? Ask the\r\nwinds and the stars, ask the God of life, for there is none that knows\r\nsuch things. The lord was her friend and lover; but time went on, and\r\none fine day he saw another and his liking changed.\r\n\r\nLike a youth he loved his maid. Often he called her his blessing and his\r\ndove, and said: "Give me your heart!" And she did so. He said: "May I\r\nask for something, love?" And, wild with joy, she answered "Yes." And\r\nshe gave him all, and yet he did not thank her.\r\n\r\nThe other he loved as a slave, as a madman and a beggar. Why? Ask the\r\ndust of the road and the leaves that fall, ask the mysterious God of\r\nlife, for there is no other that knows such things. She gave him\r\nnothing--no, nothing did she give him--and yet he thanked her. She said,\r\n"Give me your peace and your understanding!" and he was only sorry that\r\nshe did not ask his life.\r\n\r\nAnd his maid was set in the tower...\r\n\r\n"What do you there, maiden, sitting and smiling?"\r\n\r\n"I think of something ten years back. It was then I met him."\r\n\r\n"You remember him still?"\r\n\r\n"I remember him still."\r\n\r\nAnd time goes on.\r\n\r\n"What do you there, maiden? And why do you sit and smile?"\r\n\r\n"I am embroidering his name on a cloth."\r\n\r\n"Whose name? His who shut you up here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the one I met twenty years ago."\r\n\r\n"You remember him still?"\r\n\r\n"I remember him as I did before."\r\n\r\nAnd time goes on...\r\n\r\n"What do you there, prisoner?"\r\n\r\n"I grow old, and can no longer see to sew; I scrape the plaster from the\r\nwalls. And of that I am making an urn to be a little gift for him."\r\n\r\n"Of whom are you speaking?"\r\n\r\n"Of my lover, who shut me in the tower."\r\n\r\n"And do you smile at that, because he locked you in the tower?"\r\n\r\n"I am thinking of what he will say now. \'Look, look,\' he will say,\'my\r\nmaiden has sent me a little urn; she has not forgotten me in thirty\r\nyears.\'"\r\n\r\nAnd time goes on...\r\n\r\n"What, prisoner! sit you there idle, and smile?"\r\n\r\n"I grow old, I grow old, my eyes are blind, I am only thinking."\r\n\r\n"Of him that you met forty years ago?"\r\n\r\n"Of him whom I met when I was young. Maybe it was forty years ago."\r\n\r\n"But do you not know, then, that he is dead? ... Pale beldam, you do\r\nnot answer; your lips are white, you breathe no more..."\r\n\r\nThere! That was the strange tale of the girl in the tower. Wait, AEsop,\r\nwait a little: there was something I forgot. One day she heard her\r\nlover\'s voice in the courtyard, and she fell on her knees and blushed.\r\nAnd that was when she was forty years...\r\n\r\nI bury you, Eva, and in humility kiss the sand above your grave. A\r\nluxuriant, rose-red memory flowers in me when I think of you; I am as if\r\ndrenched in blessing at the memory of your smile. You gave all; all did\r\nyou give, and it cost you nothing, for you were the wild child of life\r\nitself. But others, the miserly ones who begrudge even a glance, can\r\nhave all my thoughts. Why? Ask the twelve months and the ships on the\r\nsea; ask the mysterious God of the heart...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nA man said:\r\n\r\n"You never go out shooting now? AEsop is running loose in the woods; he\r\nis after a hare."\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n"Go and shoot it for me."\r\n\r\nSome days passed. Herr Mack looked me up. He was hollow-eyed; his face\r\nwas grey. I thought: Is it true that I can see through my fellows, or is\r\nit not? I do not know, myself.\r\n\r\nHerr Mack spoke of the landslip, the catastrophe. It was a misfortune,\r\na sad accident; I was in no way to blame.\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n"If it was someone who wished to separate Eva and me at any price, he\r\nhas gained his end. God\'s curse be on him!"\r\n\r\nHerr Mack looked at me suspiciously. He murmured something about the\r\nfine funeral. Nothing had been spared.\r\n\r\nI sat admiring the alertness of his mind. He would have no compensation\r\nfor the boat that my landslide had crushed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but surely," I said, "will you not have some payment for the boat\r\nand the tar-bucket and the brush?"\r\n\r\n"No, my dear Lieutenant," he answered. "How could you think of such a\r\nthing?" And he looked at me with hatred in his eyes.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks I saw nothing of Edwarda. Yes, once I met her at the\r\nstore: when I went to buy some bread, she stood inside the counter\r\nlooking over some different sorts of cloth stuff. Only the two\r\nassistants were there besides.\r\n\r\nI greeted her aloud, and she looked up, but did not answer. It occurred\r\nto me that I could not ask for bread while she was there; I turned to\r\nthe assistants and asked for powder and shot. While they were weighing\r\nit out, I watched her.\r\n\r\nA grey dress, much too small for her, with the buttonholes worn; her\r\nflat breast heaved restlessly. How she had grown that summer! Her brow\r\nwas knit in thought; those strangely curved eyebrows stood in her face\r\nlike two riddles; all her movements were grown more mature. I looked at\r\nher hands; the contour of her long, delicate fingers moved me violently,\r\nmade me tremble. She was still turning over the stuffs.\r\n\r\nI stood wishing that AEsop would run to her behind the counter--then I\r\ncould call him back at once and apologise. What would she say then?\r\n\r\n"Here you are," said the storekeeper.\r\n\r\nI paid for the things, took up my parcels, and took my leave of her. She\r\nlooked up, but again without speaking. Good, I thought to myself. She\r\nis the Baron\'s bride already, as like as not. And I went, without my\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nWhen I got outside, I looked up at the window. No one was watching me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThen one night the snow came, and it began to be cold in my hut. There\r\nwas a fireplace where I cooked my food, but the wood burned poorly and\r\nit was very draughty, though I had caulked the walls as well as I could.\r\nThe autumn was past, and the days were growing shorter. The first snow\r\nwas still melting under the rays of the sun. Presently the ground was\r\nbare again, but the nights were cold, and the water froze. And all the\r\ngrass and all the insects died.\r\n\r\nA secret stillness fell upon people; they pondered and were silent;\r\ntheir eyes awaited the winter. No more calling from the drying grounds:\r\nthe harbour lay quiet. Everything was moving towards the eternal winter\r\nof the northern lights, when the sun sleeps in the sea. Dull came the\r\nsound of the oars from a lonely boat.\r\n\r\nA girl came rowing.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been, my girl?"\r\n\r\n"Nowhere."\r\n\r\n"Nowhere? Look, I recognize you: I met you last summer."\r\n\r\nShe brought the boat in, stepped ashore, made fast.\r\n\r\n"You were herding goats. You stopped to fasten your stocking. I met you\r\none night."\r\n\r\nA little flush rose to her cheeks, and she laughed shyly.\r\n\r\n"Little goat-girl, come into the hut and let me look at you. I knew your\r\nname, too--it is Henriette."\r\n\r\nBut she walked past me without speaking. The autumn, the winter, had\r\nlaid hold of her too; her senses drowsed.\r\n\r\nAlready the sun had gone to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I put on my uniform for the first time, and went down to Sirilund.\r\nMy heart was beating.\r\n\r\nI remembered everything from the day when Edwarda had come hurrying to\r\nme and embraced me before them all. Now she had thrown me hither and\r\nthither for many months, and made my hair turn grey. My own fault? Yes,\r\nmy star had led me astray. I thought: How she would chuckle if I were to\r\nthrow myself at her feet and tell her the secret of my heart to-day!\r\nShe would offer me a chair and have wine brought in, and just as she was\r\nraising the glass to her lips to drink with me, she would say:\r\n"Lieutenant, I thank you for the time we have been together. I shall\r\nnever forget it!" But when I grew glad and felt a little hope, she\'d\r\npretend to drink, and set down the glass untouched. And she wouldn\'t\r\nhide from me that she\'d only been pretending to drink; she\'d be careful\r\nto let me see it. That was her way.\r\n\r\nGood--it was nearing the last hour now.\r\n\r\nAnd as I walked down the road I thought further: My uniform will impress\r\nher; the trappings are new and handsome. The sword will rattle against\r\nthe floor. A nervous joy thrilled me, and I whispered to myself: Who\r\nknows what may happen yet? I raised my head and threw out a hand. No\r\nmore humility now--a man\'s honour and pride! Whatever came of it, I\r\nwould make no more advances now. Pardon me, my fair one, for not asking\r\nyour hand...\r\n\r\nHerr Mack met me in the courtyard, greyer still, more hollow-eyed.\r\n\r\n"Going away? So? I suppose you\'ve not been very comfortable lately, eh?\r\nYour hut burned down..." And Herr Mack smiled.\r\n\r\nIn a moment it seemed as if the wisest man in the world stood before my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Go indoors, Lieutenant; Edwarda is there. Well, I will say good-bye.\r\nSee you on the quay, I suppose, when the vessel sails." He walked off,\r\nwith head bowed in thought, whistling.\r\n\r\nEdwarda was sitting indoors, reading. At the instant of my entering, she\r\nstarted at my uniform; she looked at me sideways like a bird, and even\r\nblushed. She opened her mouth.\r\n\r\n"I have come to say good-bye," I managed to get out at last.\r\n\r\nShe rose quickly to her feet, and I saw that my words had had some\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n"Glahn, are you going away? Now?"\r\n\r\n"As soon as the boat comes." I grasped her hand--both her hands--a\r\nsenseless delight took possession of me--I burst out, "Edwarda!" and\r\nstared at her.\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment she was cold--cold and defiant. Her whole being\r\nresisted me; she drew herself up. I found myself standing like a beggar\r\nbefore her. I loosed her hand and let her go. I remember that from that\r\nmoment I stood repeating mechanically: "Edwarda, Edwarda!" again and\r\nagain without thinking, and when she asked: "Yes? What were you going to\r\nsay?" I explained nothing.\r\n\r\n"To think you are going already," she said again. "Who will come next\r\nyear, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"Another," I answered. "The hut will be built up again, no doubt."\r\n\r\nPause. She was already reaching for her book.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry my father is not in," she said. "But I will tell him you\r\nwere here."\r\n\r\nI made no answer to this. I stepped forward, took her hand once more,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n_"Farvel,_ Edwarda."\r\n\r\n_"Farvel,"_ she answered.\r\n\r\nI opened the door as if to go. Already she was sitting with the book in\r\nher hand, reading--actually reading and turning the page. Nothing\r\naffected, not the least in the world affected by my saying good-bye.\r\n\r\nI coughed.\r\n\r\nShe turned and said in surprise:\r\n\r\n"Oh, are you not gone? I thought you were."\r\n\r\nHeaven alone knows, but it struck me that her surprise was too great;\r\nthat she was not careful, that she overdid it. And it came into my head\r\nthat perhaps she had known all the time that I was standing behind her.\r\n\r\n"I am going now," I said.\r\n\r\nThen she rose and came over to me.\r\n\r\n"I should like to have something to remember you by when you go," she\r\nsaid. "I thought of asking you for something, but perhaps it is too\r\nmuch. Will you give me AEsop?"\r\n\r\nI did not hesitate. I answered "Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then, perhaps, you would come and bring him to-morrow," she said.\r\n\r\nI went.\r\n\r\nI looked up at the window. No one there.\r\n\r\nIt was all over now...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last night in the hut. I sat in thought, I counted the hours; when\r\nthe morning came I made ready my last meal. It was a cold day.\r\n\r\nWhy had she asked me to come myself and bring the dog? Would she tell me\r\nsomething, speak to me, for the last time? I had nothing more to hope\r\nfor. And how would she treat AEsop? AEsop, AEsop, she will torture you! For\r\nmy sake she will whip you, caress you too, perhaps, but certainly whip\r\nyou, with and without reason; ruin you altogether...\r\n\r\nI called AEsop to me, patted him, put our two heads together, and picked\r\nup my gun. He was already whining with pleasure, thinking we were going\r\nout after game. I put our heads together once more; I laid the muzzle of\r\nthe gun against AEsop\'s neck and fired...\r\n\r\nI hired a man to carry AEsop\'s body to Edwarda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mail-packet was to sail in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nI went down to the quay. My things were already on board. Herr Mack\r\npressed my hand, and said encouragingly that it would be nice weather,\r\npleasant weather; he would not mind making the trip himself in such\r\nweather. The Doctor came walking down. Edwarda was with him; I felt my\r\nknees beginning to tremble.\r\n\r\n"Came to see you safely off," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\nI thanked him.\r\n\r\nEdwarda looked me straight in the face and said:\r\n\r\n"I must thank you for your dog." She pressed her lips together; they\r\nwere quite white. Again she had called me "_Eder_." [Footnote: The\r\nmost formal mode of address.]\r\n\r\n"When does the boat go?" the Doctor asked a man.\r\n\r\n"In half an hour."\r\n\r\nI said nothing.\r\n\r\nEdwarda was turning restlessly this way and that.\r\n\r\n"Doctor, don\'t you think we may as well go home again?" she said. "I\r\nhave done what I came for to do."\r\n\r\n"You have done what you came _to do_," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\nShe laughed, humiliated by his everlasting correction, and answered:\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t that almost what I said?"\r\n\r\n"No," he answered shortly.\r\n\r\nI looked at him. The little man stood there cold and firm; he had made a\r\nplan, and he carried it out to the last. And if he lost after all? In\r\nany case, he would never show it; his face never betrayed him.\r\n\r\nIt was getting dusk.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-bye," I said. "And thanks for--everything."\r\n\r\nEdwarda looked at me dumbly. Then she turned her head and stood looking\r\nout at the ship.\r\n\r\nI got into the boat. Edwarda was still standing on the quay. When I got\r\non board, the Doctor called out "Good-bye!" I looked over to the shore.\r\nEdwarda turned at the same time and walked hurriedly away from the quay,\r\nthe Doctor far behind. That was the last I saw of her.\r\n\r\nA wave of sadness went through my heart...\r\n\r\nThe vessel began to move; I could still see Herr Mack\'s sign: "Salt and\r\nBarrels." But soon it disappeared. The moon and the stars came out; the\r\nhills towered round about, and I saw the endless woods. There is the\r\nmill; there, there stood my hut, that was burned; the big grey stone\r\nstands there all alone on the site of the fire. Iselin, Eva...\r\n\r\nThe night of the northern lights spreads over valley and hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nI have written this to pass the time. It has amused me to look back to\r\nthat summer in Nordland, when I often counted the hours, but when time\r\nflew nevertheless. All is changed. The days will no longer pass.\r\n\r\nI have many a merry hour even yet. But time--it stands still, and I\r\ncannot understand how it can stand so still. I am out of the service,\r\nand free as a prince; all is well; I meet people, drive in carriages;\r\nnow and again I shut one eye and write with one finger up in the sky; I\r\ntickle the moon under the chin, and fancy that it laughs--laughs broadly\r\nat being tickled under the chin. All things smile. I pop a cork and\r\ncall gay people to me.\r\n\r\nAs for Edwarda, I do not think of her. Why should I not have forgotten\r\nher altogether, after all this time? I have some pride. And if anyone\r\nasks whether I have any sorrows, then I answer straight out, "No--none."\r\n\r\nCora lies looking at me. AEsop, it used to be, but now it is Cora that\r\nlies looking at me. The clock ticks on the mantel; outside my open\r\nwindow sounds the roar of the city. A knock at the door, and the postman\r\nhands me a letter. A letter with a coronet. I know who sent it; I\r\nunderstand it at once, or maybe I dreamed it one sleepless night. But in\r\nthe envelope there is no letter at all--only two green bird\'s feathers.\r\n\r\nAn icy horror thrills me; I turn cold. Two green feathers! I say to\r\nmyself: Well, and what of it? But why should I turn cold? Why, there is\r\na cursed draught from those windows.\r\n\r\nAnd I shut the windows.\r\n\r\nThere lie two bird\'s feathers, I think to myself again. I seem to know\r\nthem; they remind me of a little jest up in Nordland, just a little\r\nepisode among a host of others. It is amusing to see those two feathers\r\nagain. And suddenly I seem to see a face and hear a voice, and the voice\r\nsays: "Her, Herr Lieutenant: here are your feathers."\r\n\r\n"Your feathers."...\r\n\r\nCora, lie still--do you hear? I will kill you if you move!\r\n\r\nThe weather is hot, an intolerable heat is in the room; what was I\r\nthinking of to close the windows? Open them again--open the door too;\r\nopen it wide--this way, merry souls, come in! Hey, messenger, an\r\nerrand--go out and fetch me a host of people...\r\n\r\nAnd the day passes; but time stands still.\r\n\r\nNow I have written this for my own pleasure only, and amused myself with\r\nit as best I could. No sorrow weighs on me, but I long to be\r\naway--where, I do not know, but far away, perhaps in Africa or India.\r\nFor my place is in the woods, in solitude...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLAHN\'S DEATH\r\n\r\nA DOCUMENT OF 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glahn family can go on advertising as long as they please for\r\nLieutenant Thomas Glahn, who disappeared; but he will never come back.\r\nHe is dead, and, what is more, I know how he died.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I am not surprised that his people should still keep\r\non seeking information; for Thomas Glahn was in many ways an uncommon\r\nand likable man. I admit this, for fairness\' sake, and despite the fact\r\nthat Glahn is still repellant to my soul, so that the bare memory of him\r\narouses hatred. He was a splendidly handsome man, full of youth, and\r\nwith an irresistible manner. When he looked at you with his hot animal\r\neyes, you could not but feel his power; even I felt it so. A woman, they\r\nsay, said: "When he looks at me, I am lost; I feel a sensation as if he\r\nwere touching me."\r\n\r\nBut Thomas Glahn had his faults, and I have no intention of hiding them,\r\nseeing that I hate him. He could at times be full of nonsense like a\r\nchild, so kindly natured was he; and perhaps it was that which made him\r\nso irresistible to women. God knows! He could chat with them and laugh\r\nat their senseless twaddle; and so he made an impression. Once, speaking\r\nof a very corpulent man in the place, he said that he looked as if he\r\nwent about with his breeches full of lard. And he laughed at that joke\r\nhimself, though I should have been ashamed of it. Another time, after we\r\nhad come to live in the same house together, he showed his foolishness\r\nin an unmistakable way. My landlady came in one morning and asked what I\r\nwould have for breakfast, and in my hurry I happened to answer: "A bread\r\nand a slice of egg." Thomas Glahn was sitting in my room at the time--he\r\nlived in the attic up above, just under the roof--and he began to\r\nchuckle and laugh childishly over my little slip of the tongue. "A bread\r\nand a slice of egg!" he repeated time over and over, until I looked at\r\nhim in surprise and made him stop.\r\n\r\nMaybe I shall call to mind other ridiculous traits of his later on. If\r\nso, I will write them down too, and not spare him, seeing that he is\r\nstill my enemy. Why should I be generous? But I will admit that he\r\ntalked nonsense only when he was drunk. But is it not a great mistake to\r\nbe drunk at all?\r\n\r\nWhen I first met him, in the autumn of 1859, he was a man of\r\ntwo-and-thirty--we were of an age. He wore a full beard at that time,\r\nand affected woolen sports shirts with an exaggerated lowness of neck;\r\nnot content with that, he sometimes left the top button undone. His neck\r\nappeared to me at first to be remarkably handsome; but little by little\r\nhe made me his deadly enemy, and then I did not consider his neck\r\nhandsomer than mine, though I did not show off mine so openly. I met him\r\nfirst on a river boat, and we were going to the same place, on a hunting\r\ntrip; we agreed to go together up-country by ox-wagon when we came to\r\nthe end of the railway. I purposely refrained from stating the place we\r\nwere going to, not wishing to set anyone on the track. But the Glahns\r\ncan safely stop advertising for their relative; for he died at the place\r\nwe went to, which I will not name.\r\n\r\nI had heard of Thomas Glahn, by the way, before I met him; his name was\r\nnot unknown to me. I had heard of some affair of his with a young girl\r\nfrom Nordland, from a big house there, and that he had compromised her\r\nin some way, after which she broke it off. This he had sworn, in his\r\nfoolish obstinacy, to revenge upon himself, and the lady calmly let him\r\ndo as he pleased in that respect, considering it no business of hers.\r\nFrom that time onwards, Thomas Glahn\'s name began to be well known; he\r\nturned wild, mad; he drank, created scandal after scandal, and resigned\r\nhis commission in the army. A queer way of taking vengeance for a girl\'s\r\nrefusal!\r\n\r\nThere was also another story of his relations with that young lady, to\r\nthe effect that he had not compromised her in any way, but that her\r\npeople had showed him the door, and that she herself had helped in it,\r\nafter a Swedish Count, whose name I will not mention, had proposed to\r\nher. But this account I am less inclined to trust; I regard the first\r\nas true, for after all I hate Thomas Glahn and believe him capable of\r\nthe worst. But, however it may have been, he never spoke himself of the\r\naffair with that noble lady, and I did not ask him about it. What\r\nbusiness was it of mine?\r\n\r\nAs we sat there on the boat, I remember we talked about the little\r\nvillage we were making for, to which neither of us had been before.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a sort of hotel there, I believe," said Glahn, looking at the\r\nmap. "Kept by an old half-caste woman, so they say. The chief lives in\r\nthe next village, and has a heap of wives, by all accounts--some of them\r\nonly ten years old."\r\n\r\nWell, I knew nothing about the chief and his wives, or whether there was\r\na hotel in the place, so I said nothing. But Glahn smiled, and I thought\r\nhis smile was beautiful.\r\n\r\nI forgot, by the way, that he could not by any means be called a perfect\r\nman, handsome though he was. He told me himself that he had an old\r\ngunshot wound in his left foot, and that it was full of gout whenever\r\nthe weather changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nA week later we were lodged in the big hut that went by the name of\r\nhotel, with the old English half-caste woman. What a hotel it was! The\r\nwalls were of clay, with a little wood, and the wood was eaten through\r\nby the white ants that crawled about everywhere. I lived in a room next\r\nthe main parlor, with a green glass window looking on to the street--a\r\nsingle pane, not very clear at that--and Glahn had chosen a little bit\r\nof a hole up in the attic, much darker, and a poor place to live in. The\r\nsun heated the thatched roof and made his room almost insufferably hot\r\nat night and day; besides which, it was not a stair at all that led up\r\nto it, but a wretched bit of a ladder with four steps. What could I do?\r\nI let him take his choice, and said:\r\n\r\n"Here are two rooms, one upstairs and one down; take your choice."\r\n\r\nAnd Glahn looked at the two rooms and took the upper one, possibly to\r\ngive me the better of the two--but was I not grateful for it? I owe him\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAs long as the worst of the heat lasted, we left the hunting alone and\r\nstayed quietly in the hut, for the heat was extremely uncomfortable. We\r\nlay at night with a mosquito net over the bedplace, to keep off the\r\ninsects; but even then it happened sometimes that blind bats would come\r\nflying silently against our nets and tear them. This happened too often\r\nto Glahn, because he was obliged to have a trap in the roof open all the\r\ntime, on account of the heat; but it did not happen to me. In the\r\ndaytime we lay on mats outside the hut, and smoked and watched the life\r\nabout the other huts. The natives were brown, thick-lipped folk, all\r\nwith rings in their ears and dead, brown eyes; they were almost naked,\r\nwith just a strip of cotton cloth or plaited leaves round the middle,\r\nand the women had also a short petticoat of cotton stuff to cover them.\r\nAll the children went about stark naked night and day, with great big\r\nprominent bellies simply glistening with oil.\r\n\r\n"The women are too fat," said Glahn.\r\n\r\nAnd I too thought the women were too fat. Perhaps it was not Glahn at\r\nall, but myself, who thought so first; but I will not dispute his\r\nclaim--I am willing to give him the credit. As a matter of fact, not all\r\nthe women were ugly, though their faces were fat and swollen. I had met\r\na girl in the village, a young half-Tamil with long hair and snow-white\r\nteeth; she was the prettiest of them all. I came upon her one evening at\r\nthe edge of a rice field. She lay flat on her face in the high grass,\r\nkicking her legs in the air. She could talk to me, and we did talk, too,\r\nas long as I pleased. Glahn sat that evening in the middle of our\r\nvillage outside a hut with two other girls, very young--not more than\r\nten years old, perhaps. He sat there talking nonsense to them, and\r\ndrinking rice beer; that was the sort of thing he liked.\r\n\r\nA couple of days later, we went out shooting. We passed by tea gardens,\r\nrice fields, and grass plains; we left the village behind us and went in\r\nthe direction of the river, and came into forests of strange foreign\r\ntrees, bamboo and mango, tamarind, teak and salt trees, oil--and\r\ngum-bearing plants--Heaven knows what they all were; we had, between us,\r\nbut little knowledge of the things. But there was very little water in\r\nthe river, and so it remained until the rainy season. We shot wild\r\npigeons and partridges, and saw a couple of panthers one afternoon;\r\nparrots, too, flew over our heads. Glahn was a terribly accurate shot;\r\nhe never missed. But that was merely because his gun was better than\r\nmine; many times I too shot terribly accurately. I never boasted of it,\r\nbut Glahn would often say: "I\'ll get that fellow in the tail," or "that\r\none in the head." He would say that before he fired; and when the bird\r\nfell, sure enough, it was hit in the tail or the head as he had said.\r\nWhen we came upon the two panthers, Glahn was all for attacking them too\r\nwith his shot-gun, but I persuaded him to give it up, as it was getting\r\ndusk, and we had no more than two or three cartridges left. He boasted\r\nof that too--of having had the courage to attack panthers with a\r\nshot-gun.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry I did not fire at them after all," he said to me. "What do\r\nyou want to be so infernally cautious for? Do you want to go on living?"\r\n"I\'m glad you consider me wiser than yourself," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t let us quarrel over a trifle," he said.\r\n\r\nThose were his words, not mine; if he had wished to quarrel, I for my\r\npart had no wish to prevent him. I was beginning to feel some dislike\r\nfor him for his incautious behavior, and for his manner with women. Only\r\nthe night before, I had been walking quietly along with Maggie, the\r\nTamil girl that was my friend, and we were both as happy as could be.\r\nGlahn sits outside his hut, and nods and smiles to us as we pass. It was\r\nthen that Maggie saw him for the first time, and she was very\r\ninquisitive about him. So great an impression had he made on her that,\r\nwhen it was time to go, we went each our own way; she did not go back\r\nhome with me.\r\n\r\nGlahn would have put this by as of no importance when I spoke to him\r\nabout it. But I did not forget it. And it was not to me that he nodded\r\nand smiled as we passed by the hut! it was to Maggie.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that she chews?" he asked me.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," I answered. "She chews--I suppose that\'s what her teeth\r\nare for."\r\n\r\nAnd it was no news to me either that Maggie was always chewing\r\nsomething; I had noticed it long before. But it was not betel she was\r\nchewing, for her teeth were quite white; she had, however, a habit of\r\nchewing all sorts of other things--putting them in her mouth and chewing\r\nas if they were something nice. Anything would do--a piece of money, a\r\nscrap of paper, feathers--she would chew it all the same. Still, it was\r\nnothing to reproach her for, seeing that she was the prettiest girl in\r\nthe village, anyway. Glahn was jealous of me, that was all.\r\n\r\nI was friends again with Maggie, though, next evening, and we saw\r\nnothing of Glahn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA week passed, and we went out shooting every day, and shot a heap of\r\ngame. One morning, just as we were entering the forest, Glahn gripped me\r\nby the arm and whispered: "Stop!" At the same moment he threw up his\r\nrifle and fired. It was a young leopard he had shot, I might have fired\r\nmyself, but Glahn kept the honour to himself and fired first. Now he\'ll\r\nboast of that later on, I said to myself. We went up to the dead beast.\r\nIt was stone dead, the left flank all torn up and the bullet in its\r\nback.\r\n\r\nNow I do not like being gripped by the arm, so I said:\r\n\r\n"I could have managed that shot myself."\r\n\r\nGlahn looked at me.\r\n\r\nI said: "You think perhaps I couldn\'t have done it?"\r\n\r\nStill Glahn made no answer. Instead, he showed his childishness once\r\nmore, shooting the dead leopard again, this time through the head. I\r\nlooked at him in utter astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Well, you know," he explains, "I shouldn\'t like to have it said that I\r\nshot a leopard in the flank."\r\n\r\n"You are very amiable this evening," I said.\r\n\r\nIt was too much for his vanity to have made such a poor shot; he must\r\nalways be first. What a fool he was! But it was no business of mine,\r\nanyway. I was not going to show him up.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when we came back to the village with the dead leopard,\r\na lot of the natives came out to look at it. Glahn simply said we had\r\nshot it that morning, and made no sort of fuss about it himself at the\r\ntime. Maggie came up too.\r\n\r\n"Who shot it?" she asked.\r\n\r\nAnd Glahn answered:\r\n\r\n"You can see for yourself--twice hit. We shot it this morning when we\r\nwent out." And he turned the beast over and showed her the two bullet\r\nwounds, both that in the flank and that in the head. "That\'s where mine\r\nwent," he said, pointing to the side--in his idiotic fashion he wanted\r\nme to have the credit of having shot it in the head. I did not trouble\r\nto correct him; I said nothing. After that, Glahn began treating the\r\nnatives with rice beer--gave them any amount of it, as many as cared to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n"Both shot it," said Maggie to herself; but she was looking at Glahn all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nI drew her aside with me and said:\r\n\r\n"What are you looking at him all the time for? I am here too, I\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said. "And listen: I am coming this evening."\r\n\r\nIt was the day after this that Glahn got the letter. There came a letter\r\nfor him, sent up by express messenger from the river station, and it had\r\nmade a detour of a hundred and eighty miles. The letter was in a\r\nwoman\'s hand, and I thought to my self that perhaps it was from that\r\nformer friend of his, the noble lady. Glahn laughed nervously when he\r\nhad read it, and gave the messenger extra money for bringing it. But it\r\nwas not long before he turned silent and gloomy, and did nothing but sit\r\nstaring straight before him. That evening he got drunk--sat drinking\r\nwith an old dwarf of a native and his son, and clung hold of me too, and\r\ndid all he could to make me drink as well.\r\n\r\nThen he laughed out loud and said:\r\n\r\n"Here we are, the two of us, miles away in the middle of all India\r\nshooting game--what? Desperately funny, isn\'t it? And hurrah for all the\r\nlands and kingdoms of the earth, and hurrah for all the pretty women,\r\nmarried or unmarried, far and near. Hoho! Nice thing for a man when a\r\nmarried woman proposes to him, isn\'t it--a married woman?"\r\n\r\n"A countess," I said ironically. I said it very scornfully, and that cut\r\nhim. He grinned like a dog because it hurt him. Then suddenly he\r\nwrinkled his forehead and began blinking his eyes, and thinking hard if\r\nhe hadn\'t said too much--so mighty serious was he about his bit of a\r\nsecret. But just then a lot of children came running over to our hut and\r\ncrying out: "Tigers, ohoi, the tigers!" A child had been snapped up by a\r\ntiger quite close to the village, in a thicket between it and the river.\r\n\r\nThat was enough for Glahn, drunk as he was, and cut up about something\r\ninto the bargain. He picked up his rifle and raced off at once to the\r\nthicket--didn\'t even put on his hat. But why did he take his rifle\r\ninstead of a shot-gun, if he was really as plucky as all that? He had to\r\nwade across the river, and that was rather a risky thing in itself--but\r\nthen, the river was nearly dry now, till the rains. A little later I\r\nheard two shots, and then, close on them, a third. Three shots at a\r\nsingle beast, I thought; why, a lion would have fallen for two, and this\r\nwas only a tiger! But even those three shots were no use: the child was\r\ntorn to bits and half eaten by the time Glahn come up. If he hadn\'t been\r\ndrunk he wouldn\'t have made the attempt to save it.\r\n\r\nHe spent the night drinking and rioting in the hut next door. For two\r\ndays he was never sober for a minute, and he had found a lot of\r\ncompanions, too, to drink with him. He begged me in vain to take part in\r\nthe orgy. He was no longer careful of what he said, and taunted me with\r\nbeing jealous of him.\r\n\r\n"Your jealousy makes you blind," he said.\r\n\r\nMy jealousy? I, jealous of him?\r\n\r\n"Good Lord!" I said, "I jealous of you? What\'s there for me to be\r\njealous about?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, of course you\'re not jealous of me," he answered. "I saw Maggie\r\nthis evening, by the way. She was chewing something, as usual."\r\n\r\nI made no answer; I simply walked off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWe began going out shooting again. Glahn felt he had wronged me, and\r\nbegged my pardon.\r\n\r\n"And I\'m dead sick of the whole thing," he said. "I only wish you\'d make\r\na slip one day and put a bullet in my throat." It was that letter from\r\nthe Countess again, perhaps, that was smouldering in his mind. I\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n"As a man soweth, so shall he also reap."\r\n\r\nDay by day he grew more silent and gloomy. He had given up drinking\r\nnow, and didn\'t say a word, either; his cheeks grew hollow.\r\n\r\nOne day I heard talking and laughter outside my window; Glahn had turned\r\ncheerful again, and he stood there talking out loud to Maggie. He was\r\ngetting in all his fascinating tricks. Maggie must have come straight\r\nfrom her hut, and Glahn had been watching and waiting for her. They\r\neven had the nerve to stand there making up together right outside my\r\nglass window.\r\n\r\nI felt a trembling in all my limbs. I cocked my gun; then I let the\r\nhammer down again. I went outside and took Maggie by the arm; we walked\r\nout of the village in silence; Glahn went back into the hut again at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n"What were you talking with him again for?" I asked Maggie.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer.\r\n\r\nI was thoroughly desperate. My heart beat so I could hardly breathe. I\r\nhad never seen Maggie look so lovely as she did then--never seen a real\r\nwhite girl so beautiful. And I forgot she was a Tamil--forgot everything\r\nfor her sake.\r\n\r\n"Answer me," I said. "What were you talking to him for?"\r\n\r\n"I like him best," she said.\r\n\r\n"You like him better than me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nOh, indeed! She liked him better than me, though I was at least as good\r\na man! Hadn\'t I always been kind to her, and given her money and\r\npresents? And what had he done?\r\n\r\n"He makes fun of you; he says you\'re always chewing things," I said.\r\n\r\nShe did not understand that, and I explained it better; how she had a\r\nhabit of putting everything in her mouth and chewing it, and how Glahn\r\nlaughed at her for it. That made more impression on her than all the\r\nrest I said.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Maggie," I went on, "you shall be mine for always. Wouldn\'t\r\nyou like that? I\'ve been thinking it over. You shall go with me when I\r\nleave here; I will marry you, do you hear? and we\'ll go to our own\r\ncountry and live there. You\'d like that, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nAnd that impressed her too. Maggie grew lively and talked a lot as we\r\nwalked. She only mentioned Glahn once; she asked:\r\n\r\n"And will Glahn go with us when we go away?"\r\n\r\n"No," I said. "He won\'t. Are you sorry about that?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," she said quickly. "I am glad."\r\n\r\nShe said no more about him, and I felt easier. And Maggie went home\r\nwith me, too, when I asked her.\r\n\r\nWhen she went, a couple of hours later, I climbed up the ladder to\r\nGlahn\'s room and knocked at the thin reed door. He was in. I said:\r\n\r\n"I came to tell you that perhaps we\'d better not go out shooting\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said Glahn.\r\n\r\n"Because I\'m not so sure but I might make a little mistake and put a\r\nbullet in your throat."\r\n\r\nGlahn did not answer, and I went down again. After that warning he\r\nwould hardly dare to go out to-morrow--but what did he want to get\r\nMaggie out under my window for, and fool with her there at the top of\r\nhis voice? Why didn\'t he go back home again, if the letter really asked\r\nhim, instead of going about as he often did, clenching his teeth and\r\nshouting at the empty air: "Never, never! I\'ll be drawn and quartered\r\nfirst?"\r\n\r\nBut the morning after I had warned him, as I said, there was Glahn the\r\nsame as ever, standing by my bed, calling out:\r\n\r\n"Up with you, comrade! It\'s a lovely day; we must go out and shoot\r\nsomething. That was all nonsense you said yesterday."\r\n\r\nIt was no more than four o\'clock, but I got up at once and got ready to\r\ngo with him, in spite of my warning. I loaded my gun before starting\r\nout, and I let him see that I did. And it was not at all a lovely day,\r\nas he had said; it was raining, which showed that he was only trying to\r\nirritate me the more. But I took no notice, and went with him, saying\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAll that day we wandered round through the forest, each lost in his own\r\nthoughts. We shot nothing--lost one chance after another, through\r\nthinking of other things than sport. About noon, Glahn began walking a\r\nbit ahead of me, as if to give me a better chance of doing what I liked\r\nwith him. He walked right across the muzzle of my gun; but I bore with\r\nthat too. We came back that evening. Nothing had happened. I thought to\r\nmyself: "Perhaps he\'ll be more careful now, and leave Maggie alone."\r\n\r\n"This has been the longest day of my life," said Glahn when we got back\r\nto the hut.\r\n\r\nNothing more was said on either side.\r\n\r\nThe next few days he was in the blackest humor, seemingly all about the\r\nsame letter. "I can\'t stand it; no, it\'s more than I can bear," he would\r\nsay sometimes in the night; we could hear it all through the hut. His\r\nill temper carried him so far that he would not even answer the most\r\nfriendly questions when our landlady spoke to him; and he used to groan\r\nin his sleep. He must have a deal on his conscience, I thought--but why\r\nin the name of goodness didn\'t he go home? Just pride, no doubt; he\r\nwould not go back when he had been turned off once.\r\n\r\nI met Maggie every evening, and Glahn talked with her no more. I noticed\r\nthat she had given up chewing things altogether; she never chewed now. I\r\nwas pleased at that, and thought: She\'s given up chewing things; that is\r\none failing the less, and I love her twice as much as I did before!\r\n\r\nOne day she asked about Glahn--asked very cautiously. Was he not well?\r\nHad he gone away?\r\n\r\n"If he\'s not dead, or gone away," I said, "he\'s lying at home, no doubt.\r\nIt\'s all one to me. He\'s beyond all bearing now."\r\n\r\nBut just then, coming up to the hut, we saw Glahn lying on a mat on the\r\nground, hands at the back of his neck, staring up at the sky.\r\n\r\n"There he is," I said.\r\n\r\nMaggie went straight up to him, before I could stop her, and said in a\r\npleased sort of voice:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t chew things now--nothing at all. No feathers or money or bits\r\nof paper--you can see for yourself."\r\n\r\nGlahn scarcely looked at her. He lay still. Maggie and I went on. When\r\nI reproached her with having broken her promise and spoken to Glahn\r\nagain, she answered that she had only meant to show him he was wrong.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right--show him he\'s wrong," I said. "But do you mean it was\r\nfor his sake you stopped chewing things?"\r\n\r\nShe didn\'t answer. What, wouldn\'t she answer?\r\n\r\n"Do you hear? Tell me, was it for his sake?"\r\n\r\nAnd I could not think otherwise. Why should she do anything for Glahn\'s\r\nsake?\r\n\r\nThat evening Maggie promised to come to me, and she did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nShe came at ten o\'clock. I heard her voice outside; she was talking\r\nloud to a child whom she led by the hand. Why did she not come in, and\r\nwhat had she brought the child for? I watched her, and it struck me that\r\nshe was giving a signal by talking out loud to the child; I noticed,\r\ntoo, that she kept her eyes fixed on the attic--on Glahn\'s window up\r\nthere. Had he nodded to her, I wondered, or beckoned to her from inside\r\nwhen he heard her talking outside? Anyhow, I had sense enough myself to\r\nknow there was no need to look up aloft when talking to a child on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nI was going out to take her by the arm. But just then she let go the\r\nchild\'s hand, left the child standing there, and came in herself,\r\nthrough the door to the hut. She stepped into the passage. Well, there\r\nshe was at last; I would take care to give her a good talking to when\r\nshe came!\r\n\r\nWell, I stood there and heard Maggie step into the passage. There was no\r\nmistake: she was close outside my door. But instead of coming in to me,\r\nI heard her step up the ladder--up to the attic--to Glahn\'s hole up\r\nthere. I heard it only too well. I threw my door open wide, but Maggie\r\nhad gone up already. That was ten o\'clock.\r\n\r\nI went in, sat down in my room, and took my gun and loaded it. At twelve\r\no\'clock I went up the ladder and listened at Glahn\'s door. I could hear\r\nMaggie in there; I went down again. At one I went up again; all was\r\nquiet this time. I waited outside the door. Three o\'clock, four o\'clock,\r\nfive. Good, I thought to myself. But a little after, I heard a noise and\r\nmovement below in the hut, in my landlady\'s room; and I had to go down\r\nagain quickly, so as not to let her find me there. I might have\r\nlistened much more, but I had to go.\r\n\r\nIn the passage I said to myself: "See, here she went: she must have\r\ntouched my door with her arm as she passed, but she did not open the\r\ndoor: she went up the ladder, and here is the ladder itself--those four\r\nsteps, she has trodden them."\r\n\r\nMy bed still lay untouched, and I did not lie down now, but sat by the\r\nwindow, fingering my rifle now and again. My heart was not beating--it\r\nwas trembling.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later I heard Maggie\'s footstep on the ladder again. I lay\r\nclose up to the window and saw her walk out of the hut. She was wearing\r\nher little short cotton petticoat, that did not even reach to her knees,\r\nand over her shoulders a woolen scarf borrowed from Glahn. She walked\r\nslowly, as she always did, and did not so much as glance towards my\r\nwindow. Then she disappeared behind the huts.\r\n\r\nA little after came Glahn, with his rifle under his arm, all ready to go\r\nout. He looked gloomy, and did not even say good-morning. I noticed,\r\nthough, that he had got himself up and taken special care about his\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nI got ready at once and went with him. Neither of us said a word. The\r\nfirst two birds we shot were mangled horribly, through shooting them\r\nwith the rifle; but we cooked them under a tree as best we could, and\r\nate in silence. So the day wore on till noon.\r\n\r\nGlahn called out to me:\r\n\r\n"Sure your gun is loaded? We might come across something unexpectedly.\r\nLoad it, anyhow."\r\n\r\n"It is loaded," I answered.\r\n\r\nThen he disappeared a moment into the bush. I felt it would be a\r\npleasure to shoot him then--pick him off and shoot him down like a dog.\r\nThere was no hurry; he could still enjoy the thought of it for a bit. He\r\nknew well enough what I had in mind: that was why he had asked if my gun\r\nwere loaded. Even to-day he could not refrain from giving way to his\r\nbeastly pride. He had dressed himself up and put on a new shirt; his\r\nmanner was, lordly beyond all bounds.\r\n\r\nAbout one o\'clock he stopped, pale and angry, in front of me, and said:\r\n\r\n"I can\'t stand this! Look and see if you\'re loaded, man--if you\'ve\r\nanything in your gun."\r\n\r\n"Kindly look after your own gun," I answered. But I knew well enough\r\nwhy he kept asking about mine.\r\n\r\nAnd he turned away again. My answer had so effectively put him in his\r\nplace that he actually seemed cowed: he even hung his head as he walked\r\noff.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I shot a pigeon, and loaded again. While I was doing so,\r\nI caught sight of Glahn standing half hidden behind a tree, watching me\r\nto see if I really loaded. A little later he started singing a hymn--and\r\na wedding hymn into the bargain. Singing wedding hymns, and putting on\r\nhis best clothes, I thought to myself--that\'s his way of being extra\r\nfascinating to-day. Even before he had finished the hymn he began\r\nwalking softly in front of me, hanging his head, and still singing as he\r\nwalked. He was keeping right in front of the muzzle of my gun again, as\r\nif thinking to himself: Now it is coming, and that is why I am singing\r\nthis wedding hymn! But it did not come yet, and when he had finished his\r\nsinging he had to look back at me.\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t get much to-day anyhow, by the look of it," he said, with a\r\nsmile, as if excusing himself, and asking pardon of me for singing while\r\nwe were out after game. But even at that moment his smile was beautiful.\r\nIt was as if he were weeping inwardly, and his lips trembled, too, for\r\nall that he boasted of being able to smile at such a solemn moment.\r\n\r\nI was no woman, and he saw well enough that he made no impression on me.\r\nHe grew impatient, his face paled, he circled round me with hasty steps,\r\nshowing up now to the left, now to the right of me, and stopping every\r\nnow and then to wait for me to come up.\r\n\r\nAbout five, I heard a shot all of a sudden, and a bullet sang past my\r\nleft ear. I looked up. There was Glahn standing motionless a few paces\r\noff, staring at me; his smoking rifle lay along his arm. Had he tried to\r\nshoot me? I said:\r\n\r\n"You missed that time. You\'ve been shooting badly of late."\r\n\r\nBut he had not been shooting badly. He never missed. He had only been\r\ntrying to irritate me.\r\n\r\n"Then take your revenge, damn you!" he shouted back.\r\n\r\n"All in good time," I said, clenching my teeth.\r\n\r\nWe stood there looking at each other. And suddenly Glahn shrugged his\r\nshoulders and called out "Coward" to me. And why should he call me a\r\ncoward? I threw my rifle to my shoulder--aimed full in his face--fired.\r\n\r\nAs a man soweth...\r\n\r\nNow, there is no need, I insist, for the Glahns to make further\r\ninquiry about this man. It annoys me to be constantly seeing their\r\nadvertisements offering such and such reward for information about a\r\ndead man. Thomas Glahn was killed by accident--shot by accident when\r\nout on a hunting trip in India. The court entered his name, with the\r\nparticulars of his end, in a register with pierced and threaded\r\nleaves. And in that register it says that he is dead--_dead_, I tell\r\nyou--and what is more, that he was killed by accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pan, by Knut Hamsun\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PAN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 7214.txt or 7214.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/7/2/1/7214/\r\n\r\nProduced by Tim Becker, Eric Eldred, Charles Franks, and\r\nthe Online Distributed Team\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
