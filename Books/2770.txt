It was just on the edge of the twilight; and the\r\nlittle Peppers, all except Ben, the oldest of the flock, were enjoying\r\na "breathing spell," as their mother called it, which meant some\r\nquiet work suitable for the hour. All the "breathing spell" they could\r\nremember however, poor things; for times were always hard with them\r\nnowadays; and since the father died, when Phronsie was a baby, Mrs.\r\nPepper had had hard work to scrape together money enough to put bread\r\ninto her children\'s mouths, and to pay the rent of the little brown\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nBut she had met life too bravely to be beaten down now. So with a stout\r\nheart and a cheery face, she had worked away day after day at making\r\ncoats, and tailoring and mending of all descriptions; and she had seen\r\nwith pride that couldn\'t be concealed, her noisy, happy brood growing\r\nup around her, and filling her heart with comfort, and making the little\r\nbrown house fairly ring with jollity and fun.\r\n\r\n"Poor things!" she would say to herself, "they haven\'t had any bringing\r\nup; they\'ve just scrambled up!" And then she would set her lips together\r\ntightly, and fly at her work faster than ever. "I must get schooling for\r\nthem some way, but I don\'t see how!"\r\n\r\nOnce or twice she had thought, "Now the time is coming!" but it never\r\ndid: for winter shut in very cold, and it took so much more to feed and\r\nwarm them, that the money went faster than ever. And then, when the way\r\nseemed clear again, the store changed hands, so that for a long time she\r\nfailed to get her usual supply of sacks and coats to make; and that\r\nmade sad havoc in the quarters and half-dollars laid up as her nest egg.\r\nBut--"Well, it\'ll come some time," she would say to herself; "because it\r\nmust!" And so at it again she would fly, brisker than ever.\r\n\r\n"To help mother," was the great ambition of all the children, older\r\nand younger; but in Polly\'s and Ben\'s souls, the desire grew so\r\noverwhelmingly great as to absorb all lesser thoughts. Many and vast\r\nwere their secret plans, by which they were to astonish her at some\r\nfuture day, which they would only confide--as they did everything\r\nelse--to one another. For this brother and sister were everything to\r\neach other, and stood loyally together through "thick and thin."\r\n\r\nPolly was ten, and Ben one year older; and the younger three of the\r\n"Five Little Peppers," as they were always called, looked up to them\r\nwith the intensest admiration and love. What they failed to do, couldn\'t\r\nvery well be done by any One!\r\n\r\n"Oh dear!" exclaimed Polly as she sat over in the corner by the window\r\nhelping her mother pull out basting threads from a coat she had just\r\nfinished, and giving an impatient twitch to the sleeve, "I do wish we\r\ncould ever have any light--just as much as we want!"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t need any light to see these threads," said Mrs. Pepper,\r\nwinding up hers carefully, as she spoke, on an old spool. "Take care,\r\nPolly, you broke that; thread\'s dear now."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t help it," said Polly, vexedly; "it snapped; everything\'s\r\ndear now, it seems to me! I wish we could have--oh! ever an\' ever so\r\nmany candles; as many as we wanted. I\'d light \'em all, so there! and\r\nhave it light here one night, anyway!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and go dark all the rest of the year, like as anyway," observed\r\nMrs. Pepper, stopping to untie a knot. "Folks who do so never have any\r\ncandles," she added, sententiously.\r\n\r\n"How many\'d you have, Polly?" asked Joel, curiously, laying down his\r\nhammer, and regarding her with the utmost anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Oh, two hundred!" said Polly, decidedly. "I\'d have two hundred, all in\r\na row!"\r\n\r\n"Two hundred candles!" echoed Joel, in amazement. "My whockety! what a\r\nlot!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say such dreadful words, Joel," put in Polly, nervously, stopping\r\nto pick up her spool of basting thread that was racing away all by\r\nitself; "tisn\'t nice."\r\n\r\n"Tisn\'t worse than to wish you\'d got things you haven\'t," retorted Joel.\r\n"I don\'t believe you\'d light \'em all at once," he added, incredulously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I would too!" replied Polly, reckessly; "two hundred of \'em, if I\r\nhad a chance; all at once, so there, Joey Pepper!"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said little Davie, drawing a long sigh. "Why, \'twould be just like\r\nheaven, Polly! but wouldn\'t it cost money, though!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Polly, giving a flounce in her chair, which snapped\r\nanother thread; "oh dear me! I didn\'t mean to, mammy; well, I wouldn\'t\r\ncare how much money it cost, we\'d have as much light as we wanted, for\r\nonce; so!"\r\n\r\n"Mercy!" said Mrs. Pepper, "you\'d have the house afire! Two hundred\r\ncandles! who ever heard of such a thing!"\r\n\r\n"Would they burn?" asked Phronsie, anxiously, getting up from the floor\r\nwhere she was crouching with David, overseeing Joel nail on the cover of\r\nan old box; and going to Polly\'s side she awaited her answer patiently.\r\n\r\n"Burn?" said Polly. "There, that\'s done now, mamsie dear!" And she put\r\nthe coat, with a last little pat, into her mother\'s lap. "I guess they\r\nwould, Phronsie pet." And Polly caught up the little girl, and spun\r\nround and round the old kitchen till they were both glad to stop.\r\n\r\n"Then," said Phronsie, as Polly put her down, and stood breathless after\r\nher last glorious spin, "I do so wish we might, Polly; oh, just this\r\nvery one minute!"\r\n\r\nAnd Phronsie clasped her fat little hands in rapture at the thought.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Polly, giving a look up at the old clock in the corner;\r\n"deary me! it\'s half-past five; and most time for Ben to come home!"\r\n\r\nAway she flew to get supper. So for the next few moments nothing was\r\nheard but the pulling out of the old table into the middle of the floor,\r\nthe laying the cloth, and all the other bustle attendant upon the\r\nbeing ready for Ben. Polly went skipping around, cutting the bread,\r\nand bringing dishes; only stopping long enough to fling some scraps of\r\nreassuring nonsense to the two boys, who were thoroughly dismayed at\r\nbeing obliged to remove their traps into a corner.\r\n\r\nPhronsie still stood just where Polly left her. Two hundred candles! oh!\r\nwhat could it mean! She gazed up to the old beams overhead, and around\r\nthe dingy walls, and to the old black stove, with the fire nearly out,\r\nand then over everything the kitchen contained, trying to think how it\r\nwould seem. To have it bright and winsome and warm! to suit Polly--"oh!"\r\nshe screamed.\r\n\r\n"Goodness!" said Polly, taking her head out of the old cupboard in the\r\ncorner, "how you scared me, Phronsie!"\r\n\r\n"Would they ever go out?" asked the child gravely, still standing where\r\nPolly left her.\r\n\r\n"What?" asked Polly, stopping with a dish of cold potatoes in her hand.\r\n"What, Phronsie?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the candles," said the child, "the ever-an\'-ever so many pretty\r\nlights!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my senses!" cried Polly, with a little laugh, "haven\'t you\r\nforgotten that! Yes--no, that is, Phronsie, if we could have \'em at all,\r\nwe wouldn\'t ever let \'em go out!"\r\n\r\n"Not once?" asked Phronsie, coming up to Polly with a little skip, and\r\nnearly upsetting her, potatoes and all--"not once, Polly, truly?"\r\n\r\n"No, not forever-an\'-ever," said Polly; "take care, Phronsie! there goes\r\na potato; no, we\'d keep \'em always!"\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t want to," said Mrs. Pepper, coming out of the bedroom in\r\ntime to catch the last words; "they won\'t be good to-morrow; better have\r\nthem to-night, Polly."\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am!" said Polly, setting down her potato-dish on the table, and\r\nstaring at her mother with all her might--"have what, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the potatoes, to be sure," replied Mrs. Pepper; "didn\'t you say\r\nyou better keep them, child?"\r\n\r\n"Twasn\'t potatoes--at all," said Polly, with a little gasp; "twas--dear\r\nme! here\'s Ben!" For the door opened, and Phronsie, with a scream of\r\ndelight, bounded into Ben\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just jolly," said Ben, coming in, his chubby face all aglow, and\r\nhis big blue eyes shining so honest and true; "it\'s just jolly to get\r\nhome! supper ready, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly; "that is--all but--" and she dashed off for\r\nPhronsie\'s eating apron.\r\n\r\n"Sometime," said Phronsie, with her mouth half full, when the meal was\r\nnearly over, "we\'re going to be awful rich; we are, Ben, truly!"\r\n\r\n"No?" said Ben, affecting the most hearty astonishment; "you don\'t say\r\nso, Chick!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Phronsie, shaking her yellow head very wisely at him, and\r\ndiving down into her cup of very weak milk and water to see if Polly had\r\nput any sugar in by mistake--a proceeding always expectantly observed.\r\n"Yes, we are really, Bensie, very dreadful rich!"\r\n\r\n"I wish we could be rich now, then," said Ben, taking another generous\r\nslice of the brown bread; "in time for mamsie\'s birthday," and he cast a\r\nsorrowful glance at Polly.\r\n\r\n"I know," said Polly; "oh dear! if we only could celebrate it!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any other celebration," said Mrs. Pepper, beaming on\r\nthem so that a little flash of sunshine seemed to hop right down on the\r\ntable, "than to look round on you all; I\'m rich now, and that\'s a fact!"\r\n\r\n"Mamsie don\'t mind her five bothers," cried Polly, jumping up and\r\nrunning to hug her mother; thereby producing a like desire in all the\r\nothers, who immediately left their seats and followed her example.\r\n\r\n"Mother\'s rich enough," ejaculated Mrs. Pepper; her bright, black eyes\r\nglistening with delight, as the noisy troop filed back to their bread\r\nand potatoes; "if we can only keep together, dears, and grow up good, so\r\nthat the little brown house won\'t be ashamed of us, that\'s all I ask."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Polly, in a burst of confidence to Ben, after the table had\r\nbeen pushed back against the wall, the dishes nicely washed, wiped, and\r\nset up neatly in the cupboard, and all traces of the meal cleared away;\r\n"I don\'t care; let\'s try and get a celebration, somehow, for mamsie!"\r\n\r\n"How are you going to do it?" asked Ben, who was of a decidedly\r\npractical turn of mind, and thus couldn\'t always follow Polly in her\r\nflights of imagination.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Polly; "but we must some way."\r\n\r\n"Phoh! that\'s no good," said Ben, disdainfully; then seeing Polly\'s\r\nface, he added kindly: "let\'s think, though; and perhaps there\'ll be\r\nsome way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know," cried Polly, in delight; "I know the very thing, Ben!\r\nlet\'s make her a cake; a big one, you know, and--"\r\n\r\n"She\'ll see you bake it," said Ben; "or else she\'ll smell it, and that\'d\r\nbe just as bad."\r\n\r\n"No, she won\'t either," replied Polly. "Don\'t you know she\'s going to\r\nhelp Mrs. Henderson to-morrow; so there!"\r\n\r\n"So she is," said Ben; "good for you, Polly, you always think of\r\neverything!"\r\n\r\n"And then," said Polly, with a comfortable little feeling at her heart\r\nat Ben\'s praise, "why, we can have it all out of the way splendidly, you\r\nknow, when she comes home--and besides, Grandma Bascom\'ll tell me how.\r\nYou know we\'ve only got brown flour, Ben; I mean to go right over and\r\nask her now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, you mustn\'t," cried Ben, catching hold of her arm as she was\r\npreparing to fly off. "Mammy\'ll find it out; better wait till to-morrow;\r\nand besides Polly--" And Ben stopped, unwilling to dampen this\r\npropitious beginning. "The stove\'ll act like everything, to-morrow! I\r\nknow \'twill; then what\'ll you do!"\r\n\r\n"It sha\'n\'t!" said Polly, running up to look it in the face; "if it\r\ndoes, I\'ll shake it; the mean old thing!"\r\n\r\nThe idea of Polly\'s shaking the lumbering old black affair, sent Ben\r\ninto such a peal of laughter that it brought all the other children\r\nrunning to the spot; and nothing would do but they must one and all, be\r\ntold the reason. So Polly and Ben took them into confidence, which\r\nso elated them that half an hour after, when long past her bedtime,\r\nPhronsie declared, "I\'m not going to bed! I want to sit up like Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tease her," whispered Polly to Ben, who thought she ought to go;\r\nso she sat straight up on her little stool, winking like everything to\r\nkeep awake.\r\n\r\nAt last, as Polly was in the midst of one of her liveliest sallies, over\r\ntumbled Phronsie, a sleepy little heap, upon the floor.\r\n\r\n"I want--to go--to bed!" she said; "take me--Polly!"\r\n\r\n"I thought so," laughed Polly, and bundled her off into the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING HAPPINESS FOR MAMSIE\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so, the minute her mother had departed for the minister\'s house next\r\nmorning, and Ben had gone to his day\'s work, chopping wood for Deacon\r\nBlodgett, Polly assembled her force around the old stove, and proceeded\r\nto business. She and the children had been up betimes that morning to\r\nget through with the work; and now, as they glanced around with a look\r\nof pride on the neatly swept floor, the dishes all done, and everything\r\nin order, the moment their mother\'s back was turned they began to\r\nimplore Polly to hurry and begin.\r\n\r\n"It\'s most \'leven o\'clock," said Joel, who, having no work to do\r\noutside, that day, was prancing around, wild to help along the\r\nfestivities; "it\'s most \'leven o\'clock, Polly Pepper! you won\'t have it\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; \'tisn\'t either, Joe;" said Polly, with a very flushed face, and\r\nher arms full of kindlings, glancing up at the old clock as she spoke;\r\n"tisn\'t but quarter of nine; there, take care, Phronsie! you can\'t lift\r\noff the cover; do help her, Davie."\r\n\r\n"No; let me!" cried Joel, springing forward; "it\'s my turn; Dave got the\r\nshingles; it\'s my turn, Polly."\r\n\r\n"So \'tis," said Polly; "I forgot; there," as she flung in the wood,\r\nand poked it all up in a nice little heap coaxingly. "It can\'t help but\r\nburn; what a cake we\'ll have for mamsie!"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be so big," cried Phronsie, hopping around on one set of toes,\r\n"that mamsie won\'t know what to do, will she, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t believe she will," said Polly, gayly, stuffing in more\r\nwood; "Oh, dear! there goes Ben\'s putty; it\'s all come out!"\r\n\r\n"So it has," said Joel, going around back of the stove to explore; and\r\nthen he added cheerfully, "it\'s bigger\'n ever; oh! it\'s an awful big\r\nhole, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Now, whatever shall we do!" said Polly, in great distress; "that\r\nhateful old crack! and Ben\'s clear off to Deacon Blodgett\'s!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll run and get him," cried Joel, briskly; "I\'ll bring him right home\r\nin ten minutes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, you must not, Joe," cried Polly in alarm; "it wouldn\'t ever be\r\nright to take him off from his work; mamsie wouldn\'t like it."\r\n\r\n"What will you do, then?" asked Joel, pausing on his way to the door.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know," said Polly, getting down on her knees to\r\nexamine the crack; "I shall have to stuff it with paper, I s\'pose."\r\n\r\n"\'Twon\'t stay in," said Joel, scornfully; "don\'t you know you stuffed it\r\nbefore, last week?"\r\n\r\n"I know," said Polly, with a small sigh; and sitting down on the floor,\r\nshe remained quite still for a minute, with her two black hands thrust\r\nout straight before her.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you fix it?" asked Davie, soberly, coming up; "then we can\'t have\r\nthe cake."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" exclaimed Polly, springing up quickly; "don\'t be afraid;\r\nwe\'re going to have that cake! There, you ugly old thing, you!" (this\r\nto the stove) "see what you\'ve done!" as two big tears flew out of\r\nPhronsie\'s brown eyes at the direful prospect; and the sorrowful faces\r\nof the two boys looked up into Polly\'s own, for comfort. "I can fix it,\r\nI most know; do get some paper, Joe, as quick as you can."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know where there is any," said Joel, rummaging around; "it\'s all\r\ntore up; \'xcept the almanac; can\'t I take that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no!" cried Polly; "put it right back, Joe; I guess there\'s\r\nsome in the wood-shed."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t either," said little Davie, quickly; "Joel and I took it to\r\nmake kites with."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear," groaned Polly; "I don\'t know what we shall do; unless," as a\r\nbright thought struck her, "you let me have the kites, boys."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t," said Joel; "they\'re all flew away; and torn up."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, children," said Polly, turning round impressively upon them,\r\nthe effect of which was heightened by the extremely crocky appearance\r\nshe had gained in her explorations, "we must have some paper, or\r\nsomething to stop up that old hole with--some way, there!"\r\n\r\n"I know," said little Davie, "where we\'ll get it; it\'s upstairs;" and\r\nwithout another word he flew out of the room, and in another minute he\r\nput into Polly\'s hand an old leather boot-top, one of his most treasured\r\npossessions. "You can chip it," he said, "real fine, and then \'twill go\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"So we can," said Polly; "and you\'re a real good boy, Davie, to give it;\r\nthat\'s a splendid present to help celebrate for mamsie!"\r\n\r\n"I\'d a-given a boot-top," said Joel, looking grimly at the precious bit\r\nof leather which Polly was rapidly stripping into little bits, "if I\'d\r\na-hed it; I don\'t have anything!"\r\n\r\n"I know you would, Joey," said Polly, kindly; "there now, you\'ll stay,\r\nI guess!" as with the united efforts of the two boys, cheered on by\r\nPhronsie\'s enthusiastic little crow of delight, the leather was crowded\r\ninto place, and the fire began to burn.\r\n\r\n"Now, boys," said Polly, getting up, and drawing a long breath, "I\'m\r\ngoing over to Grandma Bascom\'s to get her to tell me how to make the\r\ncake; and you must stay and keep house."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to nail," said Joel; "I\'ve got lots to do."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Polly, tying on her hood; "Phronsie\'ll love to watch\r\nyou; I won\'t be gone long," and she was off.\r\n\r\n"Grandma Bascom," wasn\'t really the children\'s grandmother; only\r\neverybody in the village called her so by courtesy. Her cottage was over\r\nacross the lane, and just a bit around the corner; and Polly flew along\r\nand up to the door, fully knowing that now she would be helped out of\r\nher difficulty. She didn\'t stop to knock, as the old lady was so deaf\r\nshe knew she wouldn\'t hear her, but opened the door and walked in.\r\nGrandma was sweeping up the floor, already as neat as a pin; when she\r\nsaw Polly coming, she stopped, and leaned on her broom.\r\n\r\n"How\'s your ma?" she asked, when Polly had said "good morning," and then\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mammy\'s pretty well," shouted Polly into the old lady\'s ear; "and\r\nto-morrow\'s her birthday!"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow\'ll be a bad day!" said grandma. "Oh, don\'t never say that.\r\nYou mustn\'t borrow trouble, child."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t," said Polly; "I mean--it\'s her birthday, grandma!" this last\r\nso loud that grandma\'s cap-border vibrated perceptibly.\r\n\r\n"The land\'s sakes \'tis!" cried Mrs. Bascom, delightedly; "you don\'t say\r\nso!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly, skipping around the old lady, and giving her a small\r\nhug; "and we\'re going to give her a surprise."\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with her eyes?" asked grandma, sharply, turning\r\naround and facing her; "she\'s been a-sewin\' too stiddy, hain\'t she?"\r\n\r\n"A surprise!" shouted Polly, standing upon tiptoe, to bring her mouth on\r\na level with the old lady\'s ear; "a cake, grandma, a big one!"\r\n\r\n"A cake!" exclaimed grandma, dropping the broom to settle her cap, which\r\nPolly in her extreme endeavors to carry on the conversation, had knocked\r\nslightly awry; "well, that\'ll be fine."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly, picking up the broom, and flinging off her hood\r\nat the same time; "and, oh! won\'t you please tell me how to make it,\r\ngrandma!"\r\n\r\n"To be sure; to be sure;" cried the old lady, delighted beyond measure\r\nto give advice; "I\'ve got splendid receets; I\'ll go get \'em right off,"\r\nand she ambled to the door of the pantry.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll finish sweeping up," said Polly, which grandma didn\'t hear;\r\nso she took up the broom, and sent it energetically, and merrily flying\r\naway to the tune of her own happy thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they\'re right in here," said grandma, waddling back with an old\r\ntin teapot in her hand;--"goodness, child! what a dust you\'ve kicked\r\nup! that ain\'t the way to sweep." And she took the broom out of Polly\'s\r\nhand, who stood quite still in mortification.\r\n\r\n"There," she said, drawing it mildly over the few bits she could scrape\r\ntogether, and gently coaxing them into a little heap; "that\'s the way;\r\nand then they don\'t go all over the room.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," began poor Polly.\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t any matter," said Mrs. Bascom kindly, catching sight of Polly\'s\r\ndiscomfited face; "tain\'t a mite of matter; you\'ll sweep better next\r\ntime; now let\'s go to the cake;" and putting the broom into the corner,\r\nshe waddled back again to the table, followed by Polly, and proceeded\r\nto turn out the contents of the teapot, in search of just the right\r\n"receet."\r\n\r\nBut the right one didn\'t seem to appear; not even after the teapot was\r\nturned upside down and shaken by both grandma\'s and Polly\'s anxious\r\nhands. Every other "receet" seemed to tumble out gladly, and stare them\r\nin the face--little dingy rolls of yellow paper, with an ancient odor\r\nof spice still clinging to them; but all efforts to find this particular\r\none failed utterly.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t some other one do?" asked Polly, in the interval of fruitless\r\nsearching, when grandma bewailed and lamented, and wondered, "where I\r\ncould a put it!"\r\n\r\n"No, no, child," answered the old lady; "now, where do you s\'pose \'tis!"\r\nand she clapped both hands to her head, to see if she could possibly\r\nremember; "no, no, child," she repeated. "Why, they had it down to my\r\nniece Mirandy\'s weddin\'--\'twas just elegant! light as a feather; and\r\n\'twan\'t rich either," she added; "no eggs, nor--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I couldn\'t have eggs;" cried Polly, in amazement at the thought of\r\nsuch luxury; "and we\'ve only brown flour, grandma, you know."\r\n\r\n"Well, you can make it of brown," said Mrs. Bascom, kindly; "when the\r\nraisins is in \'twill look quite nice."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we haven\'t any raisins," answered Polly.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t any raisins!" echoed grandma, looking at her over her\r\nspectacles; "what are you goin\' to put in?"\r\n\r\n"Oh--cinnamon," said Polly, briskly; "we\'ve got plenty of that,\r\nand--it\'ll be good, I guess, grandma!" she finished, anxiously; "anyway,\r\nwe must have a cake; there isn\'t any other way to celebrate mamsie\'s\r\nbirthday."\r\n\r\n"Well, now," said grandma, bustling around; "I shouldn\'t be surprised\r\nif you had real good luck, Polly. And your ma\'ll set ever so much by it;\r\nnow, if we only could find that receet!" and returning to the charge she\r\ncommenced to fumble among her bits of paper again; "I never shall forget\r\nhow they eat on it; why, there wasn\'t a crumb left, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Polly, to whom "Mirandy\'s wedding cake" now became the\r\nheight of her desires; "if you only can find it! can\'t I climb up and\r\nlook on the pantry shelves?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe \'tis there," said Mrs. Bascom, slowly; "you might try; sometimes\r\nI do put things away, so\'s to have \'em safe."\r\n\r\nSo Polly got an old wooden chair, according to direction, and then\r\nmounted up on it, with grandma below to direct, she handed down bowl\r\nafter bowl, interspersed at the right intervals with cracked teacups and\r\nhandleless pitchers. But at the end of these explorations, "Mirandy\'s\r\nwedding cake" was further off than ever.\r\n\r\n"Tain\'t a mite o\' use," at last said the old lady, sinking down in\r\ndespair, while Polly perched on the top of the chair and looked at her;\r\n"I must a-give it away."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I have the next best one, then?" asked Polly, despairingly,\r\nfeeling sure that "Mirandy\'s wedding cake" would have celebrated the day\r\njust right; "and I must hurry right home, please," she added, getting\r\ndown from the chair, and tying on her hood; "or Phronsie won\'t know what\r\nto do."\r\n\r\nSo another "receet" was looked over, and selected; and with many\r\ncharges, and bits of advice not to let the oven get too hot, etc., etc.,\r\nPolly took the precious bit in her hand, and flew over home.\r\n\r\n"Now, we\'ve got to--" she began, bounding in merrily, with dancing eyes;\r\nbut her delight had a sudden stop, as she brought up so suddenly at\r\nthe sight within, that she couldn\'t utter another word. Phronsie was\r\ncrouching, a miserable little heap of woe, in one corner of the mother\'s\r\nbig calico-covered rocking-chair, and crying bitterly, while Joel hung\r\nover her in the utmost concern.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" gasped Polly. Flinging the "receet" on the table,\r\nshe rushed up to the old chair and was down on her knees before it, her\r\narms around the little figure. Phronsie turned, and threw herself into\r\nPolly\'s protecting arms, who gathered her up, and sitting down in the\r\ndepths of the chair, comforted her as only she could.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she asked of Joel, who was nervously begging Phronsie not\r\nto cry; "now, tell me all that\'s happened."\r\n\r\n"I was a-nailing," began Joel; "oh dear! don\'t cry, Phronsie! do stop\r\nher, Polly."\r\n\r\n"Go on," said Polly, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"I was a-nailing," began Joel, slowly; "and--and--Davie\'s gone to get\r\nthe peppermint," he added, brightening up.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Joe," said Polly, "all that\'s been going on," and she looked\r\nsternly into his face; "or I\'ll get Davie to," as little Davie came\r\nrunning back, with a bottle of castor oil, which in his flurry he had\r\nmistaken for peppermint. This he presented with a flourish to Polly, who\r\nwas too excited to see it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" cried Joel, in intense alarm; "Davie isn\'t going to! I\'ll\r\ntell, Polly; I will truly."\r\n\r\n"Go on, then," said Polly; "tell at once;" (feeling as if somebody\r\ndidn\'t tell pretty quick, she should tumble over.)\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joel, gathering himself up with a fresh effort, "the old\r\nhammer was a-shaking and Phronsie stuck her foot in the way--and--I\r\ncouldn\'t help it, Polly--no, I just couldn\'t, Polly."\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash, Polly tore off the little old shoe, and well-worn\r\nstocking, and brought to light Phronsie\'s fat little foot. Tenderly\r\ntaking hold of the white toes, the boys clustering around in the\r\ngreatest anxiety, she worked them back and forth, and up and down.\r\n"Nothing\'s broken," she said at last, and drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n"It\'s there," said Phronsie, through a rain of tears; "and it hurts,\r\nPolly;" and she began to wiggle the big toe, where around the nail was\r\nsettling a small black spot.\r\n\r\n"Poor little toe," began Polly, cuddling up the suffering foot. Just\r\nthen, a small and peculiar noise struck her ear; and looking up she saw\r\nJoel, with a very distorted face, making violent efforts to keep from\r\nbursting out into a loud cry. All his attempts, however, failed; and\r\nhe flung himself into Polly\'s lap in a perfect torrent of tears. "I\r\ndidn\'t--mean to--Polly," he cried; "\'twas the--ugly, old hammer! oh\r\ndear!"\r\n\r\n"There, there, Joey, dear," said Polly, gathering him up in the other\r\ncorner of the old chair, close to her side; "don\'t feel bad; I know you\r\ndidn\'t mean to," and she dropped a kiss on his stubby black hair.\r\n\r\nWhen Phronsie saw that anybody else could cry, she stopped immediately,\r\nand leaning over Polly, put one little fat hand on Joel\'s neck. "Don\'t\r\ncry," she said; "does your toe ache?"\r\n\r\nAt this, Joel screamed louder than ever; and Polly was at her wit\'s\r\nend to know what to do; for the boy\'s heart was almost broken. That he\r\nshould have hurt Phronsie! the baby, the pet of the whole house, upon\r\nwhom all their hearts centered--it was too much. So for the next few\r\nmoments, Polly had all she could do by way of comforting and consoling\r\nhim. Just as she had succeeded, the door opened, and Grandma Bascom\r\nwalked in.\r\n\r\n"Settin\' down?" said she; "I hope your cake ain\'t in, Polly," looking\r\nanxiously at the stove, "for I\'ve found it;" and she waved a small piece\r\nof paper triumphantly towards the rocking-chair as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Do tell her," said Polly to little David, "what\'s happened; for I can\'t\r\nget up."\r\n\r\nSo little Davie went up to the old lady, and standing on tiptoe,\r\nscreamed into her ear all the particulars he could think of, concerning\r\nthe accident that had just happened.\r\n\r\n"Hey?" said grandma, in a perfect bewilderment; "what\'s he a-sayin\',\r\nPolly--I can\'t make it out."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to go all over it again, David," said Polly, despairingly;\r\n"she didn\'t hear one word, I don\'t believe."\r\n\r\nSo David tried again; this time with better success. And then he got\r\ndown from his tiptoes, and escorted grandma to Phronsie, in flushed\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n"Land alive!" said the old lady, sitting down in the chair which he\r\nbrought her; "you got pounded, did you?" looking at Phronsie, as she\r\ntook the little foot in her ample hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Polly, quickly; "twasn\'t any one\'s fault; what\'ll we do\r\nfor it, grandma?"\r\n\r\n"Wormwood," said the old lady, adjusting her spectacles in extreme\r\ndeliberation, and then examining the little black and blue spot, which\r\nwas spreading rapidly, "is the very best thing; and I\'ve got some to\r\nhome--you run right over," she said, turning round on David, quickly,\r\n"an\' get it; it\'s a-hang-in\' by the chimbley."\r\n\r\n"Let me; let me!" cried Joel, springing out of the old chair, so\r\nsuddenly that grandma\'s spectacles nearly dropped off in fright; "oh! I\r\nwant to do it for Phronsie!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, let Joel, please," put in Polly; "he\'ll find it, grandma." So Joel\r\ndeparted with great speed; and presently returned, with a bunch of dry\r\nherbs, which dangled comfortingly by his side, as he came in.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'ll fix it," said Mrs. Bascom, getting up and taking off her\r\nshawl; "there\'s a few raisins for you, Polly; I don\'t want \'em, and\r\nthey\'ll make your cake go better," and she placed a little parcel on the\r\ntable as she spoke. "Yes, I\'ll put it to steep; an\' after it\'s put on\r\nreal strong, and tied up in an old cloth, Phronsie won\'t know as she\'s\r\ngot any toes!" and grandma broke up a generous supply of the herb, and\r\nput it into an old tin cup, which she covered up with a saucer, and\r\nplaced on the stove.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Polly; "I can\'t thank you! for the raisins and all--you\'re so\r\ngood!"\r\n\r\n"They\'re awful hard," said Joel, investigating into the bundle with\r\nDavie, which, however, luckily the old lady didn\'t hear.\r\n\r\n"There, don\'t try," she said cheerily; "an\' I found cousin Mirandy\'s\r\nweddin\' cake receet, for--"\r\n\r\n"Did you?" cried Polly; "oh! I\'m so glad!" feeling as if that were\r\ncomfort enough for a good deal.\r\n\r\n"Yes, \'twas in my Bible," said Mrs. Bascom; "I remember now; I put it\r\nthere to be ready to give John\'s folks when they come in; they wanted\r\nit; so you\'ll go all straight now; and I must get home, for I left some\r\nmeat a-boilin\'." So grandma put on her shawl, and waddled off, leaving a\r\ngreat deal of comfort behind her.\r\n\r\n"Now, says I," said Polly to Phronsie, when the little foot was snugly\r\ntied up in the wet wormwood, "you\'ve got to have one of mamsie\'s old\r\nslippers."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ho," laughed Phronsie; "won\'t that be funny, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"I should think it would," laughed Polly, back again, pulling on the\r\nbig cloth slipper, which Joel produced from the bedroom, the two boys\r\njoining uproariously, as the old black thing flapped dismally up and\r\ndown, and showed strong symptoms of flying off. "We shall have to tie it\r\non."\r\n\r\n"It looks like a pudding bag," said Joel, as Polly tied it securely\r\nthrough the middle with a bit of twine; "an old black pudding bag!" he\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n"Old black pudding bag!" echoed Phronsie, with a merry little crow; and\r\nthen all of a sudden she grew very sober, and looked intently at the\r\nfoot thrust out straight before her, as she still sat in the chair.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Phronsie?" asked Polly, who was bustling around, making\r\npreparations for the cake-making.\r\n\r\n"Can I ever wear my new shoes again?" asked the child, gravely, looking\r\ndismally at the black bundle before her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; my goodness, yes!" cried Polly; "as quick again as ever;\r\nyou\'ll be around again as smart as a cricket in a week--see if you\r\naren\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Will it go on?" asked Phronsie, still looking incredulously at the\r\nbundle, "and button up?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed!" cried Polly, again; "button into every one of the little\r\nholes, Phronsie Pepper; just as elegant as ever!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Phronsie; and then she gave a sigh of relief, and thought no\r\nmore of it, because Polly had said that all would be right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAMSIE\'S BIRTHDAY\r\n\r\n\r\n"Run down and get the cinnamon, will you, Joey?" said Polly; "it\'s in\r\nthe \'Provision Room."\r\n\r\nThe "Provision Room" was a little shed that was tacked on to the main\r\nhouse, and reached by a short flight of rickety steps; so called,\r\nbecause as Polly said, "\'twas a good place to keep provisions in, even\r\nif we haven\'t any; and besides," she always finished, "it sounds nice!"\r\n\r\n"Come on, Dave! then we\'ll get something to eat!"\r\n\r\nSo the cinnamon was handed up, and then Joel flew back to Davie.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Polly\'s cake was done, and ready for the oven. With many\r\nadmiring glances from herself, and Phronsie, who with Seraphina, an\r\nextremely old but greatly revered doll, tightly hugged in her arms was\r\nwatching everything with the biggest of eyes from the depths of the old\r\nchair, it was placed in the oven, the door shut to with a happy little\r\nbang, then Polly gathered Phronsie up in her arms, and sat down in the\r\nchair to have a good time with her and to watch the process of cooking.\r\n\r\nThere was a bumping noise that came from the "Provision Room" that\r\nsounded ominous, and then a smothered sound of words, followed by a\r\nscuffling over the old floor.\r\n\r\n"Boys!" called Polly. No answer; everything was just as still as a\r\nmouse. "Joel and David!" called Polly again, in her loudest tones.\r\n\r\n"Yes," came up the crooked stairs, in Davie\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Come up here, right away!" went back again from Polly. So up the stairs\r\ntrudged the two boys, and presented themselves rather sheepishly before\r\nthe big chair.\r\n\r\n"What was that noise?" she asked; "what have you been doing?"\r\n\r\n"Twasn\'t anything but the pail," answered Joel, not looking at her.\r\n\r\n"We had something to eat," said Davie, by way of explanation; "you\r\nalways let us."\r\n\r\n"I know," said Polly; "that\'s right, you can have as much bread as you\r\nwant to; but what you been doing with the pail?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Joel; "\'twouldn\'t hangup, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve been bumping it," said Polly; "oh! Joel, how could you! You\r\nmight have broken it; then what would mamsie say?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t," said Joel, stoutly, with his hands in his pockets, "bump it\r\nworse\'n Davie, so there!"\r\n\r\n"Why, Davie," said Polly, turning to him sorrowfully, "I shouldn\'t have\r\nthought you would!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m tired of hanging it up," said little Davie, vehemently; "and\r\nI said I wasn\'t a-goin\' to; Joel always makes me; I\'ve done it for two\r\nmillion times, I guess!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Polly, sinking back into the chair, "I don\'t know\r\nwhat I ever shall do; here\'s Phronsie hurt; and we want to celebrate\r\nto-morrow; and you two boys are bumping and banging out the bread pail,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! we won\'t!" cried both of the children, perfectly overwhelmed with\r\nremorse; "we\'ll hang it right up."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll hang it," said Davie, clattering off down the stairs with a will.\r\n\r\n"No, I will!" shouted Joel, going after him at double pace; and\r\npresently both came up with shining faces, and reported it nicely done.\r\n\r\n"And now," said Polly, after they had all sat around the stove another\r\nhalf-hour, watching and sniffing expectantly, "the cake\'s done!--dear\r\nme! it\'s turning black!"\r\n\r\nAnd quickly as possible Polly twitched it out with energy, and set it on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nOh, dear; of all things in the world! The beautiful cake over which so\r\nmany hopes had been formed, that was to have given so much happiness\r\non the morrow to the dear mother, presented a forlorn appearance as it\r\nstood there in anything but holiday attire. It was quite black on the\r\ntop, in the center of which was a depressing little dump, as if to say,\r\n"My feelings wouldn\'t allow me to rise to the occasion."\r\n\r\n"Now," said Polly, turning away with a little fling, and looking at\r\nthe stove, "I hope you\'re satisfied, you old thing; you\'ve spoiled our\r\nmamsie\'s birthday!" and without a bit of warning, she sat right down in\r\nthe middle of the floor and began to cry as hard as she could.\r\n\r\n"Well, I never!" said a cheery voice, that made the children skip.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Mrs. Beebe; oh, it\'s Mrs. Beebe!" cried Davie; "see, Polly."\r\n\r\nPolly scrambled up to her feet, ashamed to be caught thus, and whisked\r\naway the tears; the others explaining to their new visitor the sad\r\ndisappointment that had befallen them; and she was soon oh-ing, and\r\nah-ing enough to suit even their distressed little souls.\r\n\r\n"You poor creeters, you!" she exclaimed at last, for about the fiftieth\r\ntime. "Here, Polly, here\'s some posies for you, and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you!" cried Polly, with a radiant face, "why, Mrs. Beebe, we\r\ncan put them in here, can\'t we? the very thing!"\r\n\r\nAnd she set the little knot of flowers in the hollow of the cake, and\r\nthere they stood and nodded away to the delighted children, like brave\r\nlittle comforters, as they were.\r\n\r\n"The very thing!" echoed Mrs. Beebe, tickled to death to see their\r\ndelight; "it looks beautiful, I declare! and now, I must run right\r\nalong, or pa\'ll be worrying;" and so the good woman trotted out to her\r\nwaiting husband, who was impatient to be off. Mr. Beebe kept a little\r\nshoe shop in town; and always being of the impression if he left it for\r\nten minutes that crowds of customers would visit it. He was the most\r\nrestless of companions on any pleasure excursion.\r\n\r\n"And Phronsie\'s got hurt," said Mrs. Beebe, telling him the news, as he\r\nfinished tucking her up, and started the old horse.\r\n\r\n"Ho? you don\'t say so!" he cried; "whoa!"\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Mrs. Beebe; "how you scat me, pal what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"What?--the little girl that bought the shoes?" asked her husband.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied his wife, "she\'s hurt her foot."\r\n\r\n"Sho, now," said the old gentleman; "that\'s too bad," and he began to\r\nfeel in all his pockets industriously; "there, can you get out again,\r\nand take her that?" and he laid a small piece of peppermint candy, thick\r\nand white, in his wife\'s lap.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," cried Mrs. Beebe, good-naturedly, beginning to clamber over\r\nthe wheel.\r\n\r\nSo the candy was handed in to Phronsie, who insisted that Polly should\r\nhold her up to the window to thank Mr. Beebe. So amid nods, and shakings\r\nof hands, the Beebes drove off, and quiet settled down over the little\r\nbrown house again.\r\n\r\n"Now, children," said Polly, after Phronsie had made them take a bite of\r\nher candy all around, "let\'s get the cake put away safe, for mamsie may\r\ncome home early.\r\n\r\n"Where\'ll you put it?" asked Joel, wishing the world was all peppermint\r\ncandy.\r\n\r\n"Oh--in the cupboard," said Polly, taking it up; "there, Joe, you can\r\nclimb up, and put it clear back in the corner, oh! wait; I must take\r\nthe posies off, and keep them fresh in water;" so the cake was finally\r\ndeposited in a place of safety, followed by the eyes of all the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Polly, as they shut the door tight, "don\'t you go to looking\r\nat the cupboard, Joey, or mammy\'ll guess something."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I just open it a little crack, and take one smell when she isn\'t\r\nlooking?" asked Joel; "I should think you might, Polly; just one."\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly, firmly; "not one, Joe; she\'ll guess if you do." But\r\nMrs. Pepper was so utterly engrossed with her baby when she came home\r\nand heard the account of the accident, that she wouldn\'t have guessed\r\nif there\'d been a dozen cakes in the cupboard. Joel was consoled, as his\r\nmother assured him in a satisfactory way that she never should think\r\nof blaming him; and Phronsie was comforted and coddled to her heart\'s\r\ncontent. And so the evening passed rapidly and happily away; Ben\r\nsmuggling Phronsie off into a corner, where she told him all the doings\r\nof the day--the disappointment of the cake, and how it was finally\r\ncrowned with flowers; all of which Phronsie, with no small pride in\r\nbeing the narrator, related gravely to her absorbed listener. "And don\'t\r\nyou think, Bensie," she said, clasping her little hand in a convincing\r\nway over his two bigger, stronger ones, "that Polly\'s stove was very\r\nnaughty to make poor Polly cry?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do," said Ben, and he shut his lips tightly together.\r\n\r\nTo have Polly cry, hurt him more than he cared to have Phronsie see.\r\n\r\n"What are you staring at, Joe?" asked Polly, a few minutes later, as her\r\neyes fell upon Joel, who sat with his back to the cupboard, persistently\r\ngazing at the opposite wall.\r\n\r\n"Why, you told me yourself not to look at the cupboard," said Joel, in\r\nthe loudest of stage whispers.\r\n\r\n"Dear me; that\'ll make mammy suspect worse\'n anything else if you look\r\nlike that," said Polly.\r\n\r\n"What did you say about the cupboard?" asked Mrs. Pepper, who caught\r\nJoe\'s last word.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t tell," said Phronsie, shaking her head at her mother; "cause\r\nthere\'s a ca----" "Ugh!" and Polly clapped her hand on the child\'s\r\nmouth; "don\'t you want Ben to tell us a story?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!" cried little Phronsie, in which all the others joined with\r\na whoop of delight; so a most wonderful story, drawn up in Ben\'s best\r\nstyle, followed till bedtime.\r\n\r\nThe first thing Polly did in the morning, was to run to the old\r\ncupboard, followed by all the others, to see if the cake was safe; and\r\nthen it had to be drawn out, and dressed anew with the flowers, for they\r\nhad decided to have it on the breakfast table.\r\n\r\n"It looks better," whispered Polly to Ben, "than it did yesterday; and\r\naren\'t the flowers pretty?"\r\n\r\n"It looks good enough to eat, anyway," said Ben, smacking his lips.\r\n\r\n"Well, we tried," said Polly, stilling a sigh; "now, boys, call mamsie;\r\neverything\'s ready."\r\n\r\nOh! how surprised their mother appeared when she was ushered out to the\r\nfeast, and the full glory of the table burst upon her. Her delight in\r\nthe cake was fully enough to satisfy the most exacting mind. She\r\nadmired and admired it on every side, protesting that she shouldn\'t have\r\nsupposed Polly could possibly have baked it as good in the old stove;\r\nand then she cut it, and gave a piece to every child, with a little posy\r\non top. Wasn\'t it good, though! for like many other things, the cake\r\nproved better on trial than it looked, and so turned out to be really\r\nquite a good surprise all around.\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t I ever have a birthday?" asked Joel, finishing the last crumb\r\nof his piece; "I should think I might," he added, reflectively.\r\n\r\n"Why, you have, Joe," said Ben; "eight of \'em."\r\n\r\n"What a story!" ejaculated Joel; "when did I have \'em? I never had a\r\ncake; did I, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Not a cake-birthday, Joel," said his mother; "you haven\'t got to that\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"When\'s it coming?" asked Joel, who was decidedly of a matter-of-fact\r\nturn of mind.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Mrs. Pepper, laughing; "but there\'s plenty of time\r\nahead."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTROUBLE FOR THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do wish," said Joel, a few mornings after, pushing back his chair\r\nand looking discontentedly at his bowl of mush and molasses, "that we\r\ncould ever have something new besides this everlasting old breakfast!\r\nWhy can\'t we, mammy?"\r\n\r\n"Better be glad you\'ve got that, Joe," said Mrs. Pepper, taking another\r\ncold potato, and sprinkling on a little salt; "folks shouldn\'t complain\r\nso long as they\'ve anything to eat."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m so tired of it--same old thing!" growled Joel; "seems as if I\r\nsh\'d turn into a meal-bag or a molasses jug!"\r\n\r\n"Well, hand it over, then," proposed Ben, who was unusually hungry, and\r\nhad a hard day\'s work before him.\r\n\r\n"No," said Joel, alarmed at the prospect, and putting in an enormous\r\nmouthful; "it\'s better than nothing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said little Phronsie, catching Joel\'s tone, "it isn\'t nice;\r\nno, it isn\'t." And she put down her spoon so suddenly that the molasses\r\nspun off in a big drop, that trailed off the corner of the table, and\r\nmade Polly jump up and run for the floor-cloth.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Phronsie," she said, reprovingly; "you ought not to. Never mind,\r\npet," as she caught sight of two big tears trying to make a path in the\r\nlittle molasses-streaked face, "Polly\'ll wipe it up."\r\n\r\n"Sha\'n\'t we ever have anything else to eat, Polly?" asked the child,\r\ngravely, getting down from her high chair to watch the operation of\r\ncleaning the floor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Polly, cheerfully, "lots and lots--when our ship comes\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"What\'ll they be?" asked Phronsie, in the greatest delight, prepared for\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," said Polly; "ice cream for one thing, Phronsie, and\r\nmaybe, little cakes."\r\n\r\n"With pink on top?" interrupted Phronsie, getting down by Polly\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Polly, warming with her subject; "ever and ever so much\r\npink, Phronsie Pepper; more than you could eat!"\r\n\r\nPhronsie just clasped her hands and sighed. More than she could eat was\r\nbeyond her!\r\n\r\n"Hoh!" said Joel, who caught the imaginary bill of fare, "that\'s\r\nnothing, Polly. I\'d speak for a plum-puddin\'."\r\n\r\n"Like the one mother made us for Thanksgiving?" asked Polly, getting up\r\nand waiting a minute, cloth in hand, for the answer.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Joel, shutting one eye and looking up at the ceiling,\r\nmusingly, while he smacked his lips in remembrance; "wasn\'t that prime,\r\nthough!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly, thoughtfully; "would you have \'em all like that,\r\nJoe?"\r\n\r\n"Every one," replied Joe, promptly; "I\'d have seventy-five of \'em."\r\n\r\n"Seventy-five what?" asked Mrs. Pepper, who had gone into the bedroom,\r\nand now came out, a coat in hand, to sit down in the west window, where\r\nshe began to sew rapidly. "Better clear up the dishes, Polly, and set\r\nthe table back--seventy-five what, Joel?"\r\n\r\n"Plum-puddings," said Joel, kissing Phronsie.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" ejaculated Mrs. Pepper; "you don\'t know what you\'re saying,\r\nJoel Pepper; the house couldn\'t hold \'em!"\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t long," responded Joel; "we\'d eat \'em."\r\n\r\n"That would be foolish," interposed Ben; "I\'d have roast beef and\r\nfixings--and oysters--and huckleberry pie."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," cried Polly; "how nice, Ben! you always do think of the very\r\nbest things."\r\n\r\nBut Joel phoohed and declared he wouldn\'t waste his time "over old beef;\r\nhe\'d have something like!" And then he cried:\r\n\r\n"Come on, Dave, what\'d you choose?"\r\n\r\nLittle Davie had been quietly eating his breakfast amid all this\r\nchatter, and somehow thinking it might make the mother feel badly, he\r\nhad refrained from saying just how tiresome he had really found this\r\n"everlasting breakfast" as Joel called it. But now he looked up eagerly,\r\nhis answer all ready. "Oh, I know," he cried, "what would be most\r\nbeautiful! toasted bread--white bread--and candy."\r\n\r\n"What\'s candy?" asked Phronsie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t you know, Phronsie," cried Polly, "what Mrs. Beebe gave you\r\nthe day you got your shoes--the pink sticks; and--"\r\n\r\n"And the peppermint stick Mr. Beebe gave you, Phronsie," finished Joel,\r\nhis mouth watering at the remembrance.\r\n\r\n"That day, when you got your toe pounded," added Davie, looking at Joel.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Phronsie; "I want some now, I do!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Davie," said Polly, "you shall have that for breakfast when our\r\nship comes in then."\r\n\r\n"Your ships aren\'t ever coming," broke in Mrs. Pepper, wisely, "if you\r\nsit there talking--folks don\'t ever make any fortunes by wishing."\r\n\r\n"True enough," laughed Ben, jumping up and setting back his chair. "Come\r\non, Joe; you\'ve got to pile to-day."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Joel, dismally; "I wish Mr. Blodgett\'s wood was all\r\na-fire."\r\n\r\n"Never say that, Joel," said Mrs. Pepper, looking up sternly; "it\'s\r\nbiting your own nose off to wish that wood was a-fire--and besides it\'s\r\ndreadfully wicked."\r\n\r\nJoel hung his head, for his mother never spoke in that way unless she\r\nwas strongly moved; but he soon recovered, and hastened off for his\r\njacket.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I can\'t help you do the dishes, Polly," said David, running\r\nafter Joel.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to help her," said Phronsie; "I am."\r\n\r\nSo Polly got the little wooden tub that she always used, gave Phronsie\r\nthe well-worn cup-napkin, and allowed her to wipe the handleless cups\r\nand cracked saucers, which afforded the little one intense delight.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you wish, Polly," said little Phronsie, bustling around with a\r\nvery important air, nearly smothered in the depths of a big brown\r\napron that Polly had carefully tied under her chin, "that you didn\'t\r\never-an\'-ever have so many dishes to do?"\r\n\r\n"Um--maybe," said Polly, thoughtlessly. She was thinking of something\r\nelse besides cups and saucers just then; of how nice it would be to go\r\noff for just one day, and do exactly as she had a mind to in everything.\r\nShe even envied Ben and the boys who were going to work hard at Deacon\r\nBlodgett\'s woodpile.\r\n\r\n"Well, I tell you," said Phronsie, confidentially, setting down a\r\ncup that she had polished with great care, "I\'m going to do \'em all\r\nto-morrow, for you, Polly--I can truly; let me now, Polly, do."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said Polly, giving a great splash with her mop in the tub,\r\nashamed of her inward repinings. "Phronsie, you\'re no bigger than a\r\nmouse!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am," retorted Phronsie, very indignantly. Her face began to get\r\nvery red, and she straightened up so suddenly to show Polly just how\r\nvery big she was that her little head came up against the edge of the\r\ntub--over it went! a pile of saucers followed.\r\n\r\n"There now," cried Polly, "see what you\'ve done!"\r\n\r\n"Ow!" whimpered Phronsie, breaking into a subdued roar; "oh, Polly! it\'s\r\nall running down my back."\r\n\r\n"Is it?" said Polly, bursting out into a laugh; "never mind, Phronsie,\r\nI\'ll dry you."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, Polly!" said Mrs. Pepper, who had looked up in time to see the\r\ntub racing along by itself towards the "Provision Room" door, a stream\r\nof dish-water following in its wake, "she will be wet clear through; do\r\nget off her things, quick."\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," cried Polly, picking up the tub, and giving two or three quick\r\nsops to the floor. "Here you are, Pussy," grasping Phronsie, crying as\r\nshe was, and carrying her into the bedroom.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," wailed the child, still holding the wet dish towel; "I won\'t\r\never do it again, if you\'ll only let me do \'em all to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"When you\'re big and strong," said Polly, giving her a hug, "you shall\r\ndo \'em every day."\r\n\r\n"May I really?" said little Phronsie, blinking through the tears, and\r\nlooking radiant.\r\n\r\n"Yes, truly--every day."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll grow right away, I will," said Phronsie, bursting out\r\nmerrily; and she sat down and pulled off the well-worn shoes, into which\r\na big pool of dish-water had run, while Polly went for dry stockings.\r\n\r\n"So you shall," said Polly, coming back, a big piece of gingerbread in\r\nher hand; "and this\'ll make you grow, Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"O-o-h!" and Phronsie\'s little white teeth shut down quickly on the\r\ncomforting morsel. Gingerbread didn\'t come often enough into the Pepper\r\nhousehold to be lightly esteemed.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Mrs. Pepper, when order was restored, the floor washed\r\nup brightly, and every cup and platter in place, hobnobbing away to\r\nthemselves on the shelves of the old corner cupboard, and Polly had come\r\nas usual with needle and thread to help mother--Polly was getting so\r\nthat she could do the plain parts on the coats and jackets, which\r\nfilled her with pride at the very thought--"now," said Mrs. Pepper, "you\r\nneedn\'t help me this morning, Polly: I\'m getting on pretty smart; but\r\nyou may just run down to the parson\'s, and see how he is."\r\n\r\n"Is he sick?" asked Polly, in awe.\r\n\r\nTo have the parson sick, was something quite different from an ordinary\r\nperson\'s illness.\r\n\r\n"He\'s taken with a chill," said Mrs. Pepper, biting off a thread, "so\r\nMiss Huldy Folsom told me last night, and I\'m afraid he\'s going to have\r\na fever."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Polly, in dire distress; "whatever\'d we do, mammy!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know, I\'m sure," replied Mrs. Pepper, setting her stitches\r\nfirmly; "the Lord\'ll provide. So you run along, child, and see how he\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t Phronsie go?" asked Polly, pausing half-way to the bedroom door.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, I suppose she might," said Mrs. Pepper, assentingly.\r\n\r\n"No, she can\'t either," said Polly, coming back with her sun-bonnet in\r\nher hand, and shutting the door carefully after her, "cause she\'s fast\r\nasleep on the floor."\r\n\r\n"Is she?" said Mrs. Pepper; "well, she\'s been running so this morning,\r\nshe\'s tired out, I s\'pose."\r\n\r\n"And her face is dreadfully red," continued Polly, tying on her bonnet;\r\n"now, what\'ll I say, mammy?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I should think \'twould be," said Mrs. Pepper, replying to the\r\nfirst half of Polly\'s speech; "she cried so. Well, you just tell Mrs.\r\nHenderson your ma wants to know how Mr. Henderson is this morning, and\r\nif \'twas a chill he had yesterday, and how he slept last night, and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma," said Polly, "I can\'t ever remember all that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you can," said Mrs. Pepper, encouragingly; "just put your mind\r\non it, Polly; \'tisn\'t anything to what I used to have to remember--when\r\nI was a little girl, no bigger than you are."\r\n\r\nPolly sighed, and feeling sure that something must be the matter with\r\nher mind, gave her whole attention to the errand; till at last after a\r\nmultiplicity of messages and charges not to forget any one of them, Mrs.\r\nPepper let her depart.\r\n\r\nUp to the old-fashioned green door, with its brass knocker, Polly went,\r\nrunning over in her mind just which of the messages she ought to give\r\nfirst. She couldn\'t for her life think whether "if \'twas a chill he had\r\nyesterday?" ought to come before "how he slept?" She knocked timidly,\r\nhoping Mrs. Henderson would help her out of her difficulty by telling\r\nher without the asking. All other front doors in Badgertown were\r\nornaments, only opened on grand occasions, like a wedding or a funeral.\r\nBut the minister\'s was accessible alike to all. So Polly let fall the\r\nknocker, and awaited the answer.\r\n\r\nA scuffling noise sounded along the passage; and then Polly\'s soul sank\r\ndown in dire dismay. It was the minister\'s sister, and not gentle little\r\nMrs. Henderson. She never could get on with Miss Jerusha in the least.\r\nShe made her feel as she told her mother once--"as if I don\'t know what\r\nmy name is." And now here she was; and all those messages.\r\n\r\nMiss Jerusha unbolted the door, slid back the great bar, opened the\r\nupper half, and stood there. She was a big woman, with sharp black eyes,\r\nand spectacles--over which she looked--which to Polly was much worse,\r\nfor that gave her four eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, and what do you want?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I came to see--I mean my ma sent me," stammered poor Polly.\r\n\r\n"And who is your ma?" demanded Miss Jerusha, as much like a policeman as\r\nanything; "and where do you live?"\r\n\r\n"I live in Primrose Lane," replied Polly, wishing very much that she was\r\nback there.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to know where you live, before I know who you are," said\r\nMiss Jerusha; "you should answer the question I asked first; always\r\nremember that."\r\n\r\n"My ma\'s Mrs. Pepper," said Polly.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. who?" repeated Miss Jerusha.\r\n\r\nBy this time Polly was so worn that she came very near turning and\r\nfleeing, but she thought of her mother\'s disappointment in her, and the\r\nloss of the news, and stood quite still.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Jerusha?" a gentle voice here broke upon Polly\'s ear.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," responded Miss Jerusha, tartly, still holding the door\r\nmuch as if Polly were a robber; "it\'s a little girl, and I can\'t make\r\nout what she wants."\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s Polly Pepper!" exclaimed Mrs. Henderson, pleasantly. "Come\r\nin, child." She opened the other half of the big door, and led the\r\nway through the wide hall into a big, old-fashioned room, with painted\r\nfloor, and high, old side-board, and some stiff-backed rocking-chairs.\r\n\r\nMiss Jerusha stalked in also and seated herself by the window, and began\r\nto knit. Polly had just opened her mouth to tell her errand, when the\r\ndoor also opened suddenly and Mr. Henderson walked in.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Polly, and then she stopped, and the color flushed up into\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n"What is it, my dear?" and the minister took her hand kindly, and looked\r\ndown into her flushed face.\r\n\r\n"You are not going to have a fever, and be sick and die!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"I hope not, my little girl," he smiled back, encouragingly; and then\r\nPolly gave her messages, which now she managed easily enough.\r\n\r\n"There," broke in Miss Jerusha, "a cat can\'t sneeze in this town but\r\neverybody\'ll know it in quarter of an hour."\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs. Henderson took Polly out to see a brood of new little\r\nchicks, that had just popped their heads out into the world; and to\r\nPolly, down on her knees, admiring, the time passed very swiftly indeed.\r\n\r\n"Now I must go, ma\'am," she said at last, looking up into the lady\'s\r\nface, regretfully, "for mammy didn\'t say I was to stay."\r\n\r\n"Very well, dear; do you think you could carry a little pat of butter?\r\nI have some very nice my sister sent me, and I want your mother to share\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, ma\'am!" cried Polly, thinking, "how glad Davie\'ll be,\r\nfor he does so love butter! only--"\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit, then," said Mrs. Henderson, who didn\'t seem to notice the\r\nobjection. So she went into the house, and Polly went down again in\r\nadmiration before the fascinating little puff-balls.\r\n\r\nBut she was soon on the way, with a little pat of butter in a blue bowl,\r\ntied over with a clean cloth; happy in her gift for mammy, and in the\r\nknowledge of the minister being all well.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if Phronsie\'s awake," she thought to herself, turning in at\r\nthe little brown gate; "if she is, she shall have a piece of bread with\r\nlots of butter."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Mrs. Pepper, from the rocking-chair in the middle of the\r\nfloor. She had something in her arms. Polly stopped suddenly, almost\r\nletting the bowl fall.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Phronsie," said the mother, "and I don\'t know what the matter is\r\nwith her; you\'ll have to go for the doctor, Polly, and just as fast as\r\nyou can."\r\n\r\nPolly still stood, holding the bowl, and staring with all her might.\r\nPhronsie sick!\r\n\r\n"Don\'t wake her," said Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\nPoor Polly couldn\'t have stirred to save her life, for a minute; then\r\nshe said--"Where shall I go?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, run to Dr. Fisher\'s; and don\'t be gone long."\r\n\r\nPolly set down the bowl of butter, and sped on the wings of the wind for\r\nthe doctor. Something dreadful was the matter, she felt, for never had\r\na physician been summoned to the hearty Pepper family since she could\r\nremember, only when the father died. Fear lent speed to her feet; and\r\nsoon the doctor came, and bent over poor little Phronsie, who still lay\r\nin her mother\'s arms, in a burning fever.\r\n\r\n"It\'s measles," he pronounced, "that\'s all; no cause for alarm; you ever\r\nhad it?" he asked, turning suddenly around on Polly, who was watching\r\nwith wide-open eyes for the verdict.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," answered Polly, not knowing in the least what "measles" was.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do!" said Mrs. Pepper; "there haven\'t any of them had\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThe doctor was over by the little old table under the window, mixing up\r\nsome black-looking stuff in a tumbler, and he didn\'t hear her.\r\n\r\n"There," he said, putting a spoonful into Phronsie\'s mouth, "she\'ll get\r\nalong well enough; only keep her out of the cold." Then he pulled out a\r\nbig silver watch. He was a little thin man, and the watch was immense.\r\nPolly for her life couldn\'t keep her eyes off from it; if Ben could only\r\nhave one so fine!\r\n\r\n"Polly," whispered Mrs. Pepper, "run and get my purse; it\'s in the top\r\nbureau drawer."\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Polly, taking her eyes off, by a violent wrench, from\r\nthe fascinating watch; and she ran quickly and got the little old\r\nstocking-leg, where the hard earnings that staid long enough to be put\r\nanywhere, always found refuge. She put it into her mother\'s lap, and\r\nwatched while Mrs. Pepper counted out slowly one dollar in small pieces.\r\n\r\n"Here sir," said Mrs. Pepper, holding them out towards the doctor; "and\r\nthank you for coming."\r\n\r\n"Hey!" said the little man, spinning round; "that dollar\'s the Lord\'s!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pepper looked bewildered, and still sat holding it out. "And the\r\nLord has given it to you to take care of these children with; see that\r\nyou do it." And without another word he was gone.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t he good, mammy?" asked Polly, after the first surprise was over.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he was," said Mrs. Pepper. "Well, tie it up again, Polly, tie\r\nit up tight; we shall want it, I\'m sure," sighing at her little sick\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n"Mayn\'t I take Phronsie, ma?" asked Polly.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Phronsie. She had got mammy, and she meant to improve the\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\n"What is \'measles\' anyway, mammy?" asked Polly, sitting down on the\r\nfloor at their feet.\r\n\r\n"Oh, \'tis something children always have," replied Mrs. Pepper; "but I\'m\r\nsure I hoped it wouldn\'t come just yet."\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t have it," said Polly, decisively; "I know I sha\'n\'t! nor\r\nBen--nor Joe--nor--nor Davie--I guess," she added, hesitatingly, for\r\nDavie was the delicate one of the family; at least not nearly so strong\r\nas the others.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pepper looked at her anxiously; but Polly seemed as bright and\r\nhealthy as ever, as she jumped up and ran to put the kettle on the\r\nstove.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll the boys say, I wonder!" she thought to herself, feeling\r\nquite important that they really had sickness in the house. As long\r\nas Phronsie wasn\'t dangerous, it seemed quite like rich folks; and she\r\nforgot the toil, and the grind of poverty. She looked out from time to\r\ntime as she passed the window, but no boys came.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll put her in bed, Polly," said Mrs. Pepper, in a whisper, as\r\nPhronsie closed her eyes and breathed regularly.\r\n\r\n"And then will you have your dinner, ma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Pepper, "I don\'t care--if the boys come."\r\n\r\n"The boys\'ll never come," said Polly, impatiently; "I don\'t\r\nbelieve--why! here they are now!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Joel, coming in crossly, "I\'m so hungry--oh--butter!\r\nwhere\'d you get it? I thought we never should get here!"\r\n\r\n"I thought so too," said Polly. "Hush! why, where\'s Ben?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s just back," began Joel, commencing to eat, "and Davie; something\r\nis the matter with Ben--he says he feels funny."\r\n\r\n"Something the matter with Ben!" repeated Polly. She dropped the cup she\r\nheld, which broke in a dozen pieces.\r\n\r\n"Oh, whocky!" cried Joel; "see what you\'ve done, Polly Pepper!"\r\n\r\nBut Polly didn\'t hear; over the big, flat door-stone she sped, and\r\nmet Ben with little David, coming in the gate. His face was just like\r\nPhronsie\'s! And with a cold, heavy feeling at her heart, Polly realized\r\nthat this was no play.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ben!" she cried, flinging her arms around his neck, and bursting\r\ninto tears; "don\'t! please--I wish you wouldn\'t; Phronsie\'s got \'em, and\r\nthat\'s enough!"\r\n\r\n"Got what?" asked Ben, while Davie\'s eyes grew to their widest\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n"Oh, measles!" cried Polly, bursting out afresh; "the hate-fullest,\r\nhorridest measles! and now you\'re taken!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I\'m not," responded Ben, cheerfully, who knew what measles were;\r\n"wipe up, Polly; I\'m all right; only my head aches, and my eyes feel\r\nfunny."\r\n\r\nBut Polly, only half-reassured, controlled her sobs; and the sorrowful\r\ntrio repaired to mother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" ejaculated Mrs. Pepper, sinking in a chair in dismay, at\r\nsight of Ben\'s red face; "whatever\'ll we do now!"\r\n\r\nThe prop and stay of her life would be taken away if Ben should be laid\r\naside. No more stray half or quarter dollars would come to help her out\r\nwhen she didn\'t know where to turn.\r\n\r\nPolly cleared off the deserted table--for once Joel had all the bread\r\nand butter he wanted. Ben took some of Phronsie\'s medicine, and\r\ncrawled up into the loft, to bed; and quiet settled down on the little\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n"Polly," whispered Ben, as she tucked him in, "it\'ll be hard buckling-to\r\nnow, for you, but I guess you\'ll do it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Polly to herself, the next morning, trying to get a\r\nbreakfast for the sick ones out of the inevitable mush; "everything\'s\r\njust as bad as it can be! they can\'t ever eat this; I wish I had an\r\nocean of toast!"\r\n\r\n"Toast some of the bread in the pail, Polly," said Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\nShe looked worn and worried; she had been up nearly all night, back and\r\nforth from Ben\'s bed in the loft to restless, fretful little Phronsie in\r\nthe big four-poster in the bedroom; for Phronsie wouldn\'t get into the\r\ncrib. Polly had tried her best to help her, and had rubbed her eyes\r\ndiligently to keep awake, but she was wholly unaccustomed to it, and her\r\nhealthy, tired little body succumbed--and then when she awoke, shame and\r\nremorse filled her very heart.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t nice, ma," she said, glancing at the poor old pail, which\r\nshe had brought out of the "Provision Room." "Old brown bread! I want to\r\nfix \'em something nice."\r\n\r\n"Well, you can\'t, you know," said Mrs. Pepper, with a sigh; "but you\'ve\r\ngot butter now; that\'ll be splendid!"\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Polly, running to the corner cupboard where the\r\nprecious morsel in the blue bowl remained; "whatever should we do\r\nwithout it, mammy?"\r\n\r\n"Do without it!" said Mrs. Pepper; "same\'s we have done."\r\n\r\n"Well, \'twas splendid in Mrs. Henderson to give it to us, anyway," said\r\nPolly, longing for just one taste; "seems as if \'twas a year since I\r\nwas there--oh, ma!" and here Polly took up the thread that had been so\r\nrudely snapped; "don\'t you think, she\'s got ten of the prettiest--yes,\r\nthe sweetest little chickens you ever saw! Why can\'t we have some,\r\nmammy?"\r\n\r\n"Costs money," replied Mrs. Pepper. "We\'ve got too many in the house to\r\nhave any outside."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Polly, with a red face that was toasting about as much\r\nas the bread she was holding on the point of an old fork; "we never have\r\nhad anything. There," she added at last; "that\'s the best I can do; now\r\nI\'ll put the butter on this little blue plate; ain\'t that cunning, ma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Pepper, approvingly; "it takes you, Polly." So Polly\r\ntrotted first to Ben, up the crooked, low stairs to the loft; and while\r\nshe regaled him with the brown toast and butter, she kept her tongue\r\nflying on the subject of the little chicks, and all that she saw on the\r\nfamous Henderson visit. Poor Ben pretended hard to eat, but ate nothing\r\nreally; and Polly saw it all, and it cut her to the heart--so she talked\r\nfaster than ever.\r\n\r\n"Now," she said, starting to go back to Phronsie; "Ben Pepper, just as\r\nsoon as you get well, we\'ll have some chickens--so there!"\r\n\r\n"Guess we sha\'n\'t get \'em very soon," said Ben, despondently, "if I\'ve\r\ngot to lie here; and, besides, Polly, you know every bit we can save has\r\ngot to go for the new stove."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Polly, "I forgot that; so it has; seems to me\r\neverything\'s giving out!"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t bake any longer in the old thing," said Ben, turning over and\r\nlooking at her; "poor girl, I don\'t see how you\'ve stood it so long."\r\n\r\n"And we\'ve been stuffing it," cried Polly merrily, "till \'twon\'t stuff\r\nany more."\r\n\r\n"No," said Ben, turning back again, "that\'s all worn out."\r\n\r\n"Well, you must go to sleep," said Polly, "or mammy\'ll be up here; and\r\nPhronsie hasn\'t had her breakfast either."\r\n\r\nPhronsie was wailing away dismally, sitting up in the middle of the old\r\nbed. Her face pricked, she said, and she was rubbing it vigorously with\r\nboth fat little hands, and then crying worse than ever.\r\n\r\n"Oh me! oh my!" cried Polly; "how you look, Phronsie!"\r\n\r\n"I want my mammy!" cried poor Phronsie.\r\n\r\n"Mammy can\'t come now, Phronsie dear; she\'s sewing. See what Polly\'s got\r\nfor you--butter: isn\'t that splendid!"\r\n\r\nPhronsie stopped for just one moment, and took a mouthful; but the toast\r\nwas hard and dry, and she cried harder than before.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Polly, curling up on the bed beside her, "if you\'ll stop\r\ncrying, Phronsie Pepper, I\'ll tell you about the cunningest, yes, the\r\nvery cunningest little chickens you ever saw. One was white, and he\r\nlooked just like this," said Polly, tumbling over on the bed in a heap;\r\n"he couldn\'t stand up straight, he was so fat."\r\n\r\n"Did he bite?" asked Phronsie, full of interest.\r\n\r\n"No, he didn\'t bite me," said Polly; "but his mother put a bug in his\r\nmouth--just as I\'m doing you know," and she broke off a small piece of\r\nthe toast, put on a generous bit of butter, and held it over Phronsie\'s\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n"Did he swallow it?" asked the child, obediently opening her little red\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n"Oh, snapped it," answered Polly, "quick as ever he could, I tell you;\r\nbut \'twasn\'t good like this, Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"Did he have two bugs?" asked Phronsie, eying suspiciously the second\r\nmorsel of dry toast that Polly was conveying to her mouth.\r\n\r\n"Well, he would have had," replied Polly, "if there\'d been bugs enough;\r\nbut there were nine other chicks, Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"Poor chickies," said Phronsie, and looked lovingly at the rest of the\r\ntoast and butter on the plate; and while Polly fed it to her, listened\r\nwith absorbed interest to all the particulars concerning each and every\r\nchick in the Henderson hen-coop.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said Polly, towards evening, "I\'m going to sit up with Ben\r\nto-night; say I may, do, mother."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, you can\'t," replied Mrs. Pepper; "you\'ll get worn out; and then\r\nwhat shall I do? Joel can hand him his medicine."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joe would tumble to sleep, mammy," said Polly, "the first\r\nthing--let me."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Phronsie\'ll let me go to-night," said Mrs. Pepper,\r\nreflectively.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no she won\'t, I know," replied Polly, decisively; "she wants you\r\nall the time."\r\n\r\n"I will, Polly," said Davie, coming in with an armful of wood, in time\r\nto hear the conversation. "I\'ll give him his medicine, mayn\'t I, mammy?"\r\nand David let down his load, and came over where his mother and Polly\r\nsat sewing, to urge his rights.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said his mother, smiling on him. "Can you, do you\r\nthink?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am!" said Davie, straightening himself up.\r\n\r\nWhen they told Ben, he said he knew a better way than for Davie to\r\nwatch; he\'d have a string tied to Davie\'s arm, and the end he\'d hold in\r\nbed, and when \'twas time for medicine, he\'d pull the string, and that\r\nwould wake Davie up!\r\n\r\nPolly didn\'t sleep much more on her shake-down on the floor than if she\r\nhad watched with Ben; for Phronsie cried and moaned, and wanted a drink\r\nof water every two minutes, it seemed to her. As she went back into her\r\nnest after one of these travels, Polly thought: "Well, I don\'t care, if\r\nnobody else gets sick; if Ben\'ll only get well. To-morrow I\'m goin\' to\r\ndo mammy\'s sack she\'s begun for Mr. Jackson; it\'s all plain sew-in\',\r\njust like a bag; and I can do it, I know--" and so she fell into a\r\ntroubled sleep, only to be awakened by Phronsie\'s fretful little voice:\r\n"I want a drink of water, Polly, I do."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t she drink awfully, mammy?" asked Polly, after one of these\r\nexcursions out to the kitchen after the necessary draught.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Pepper; "and she mustn\'t have any more; \'twill hurt\r\nher." But Phronsie fell into a delicious sleep after that, and didn\'t\r\nwant any more, luckily.\r\n\r\n"Here, Joe," said Mrs. Pepper, the next morning, "take this coat up to\r\nMr. Peterses; and be sure you get the money for it."\r\n\r\n"How\'ll I get it?" asked Joe, who didn\'t relish the long, hot walk.\r\n\r\n"Why, tell \'em we\'re sick--Ben\'s sick," added Mrs. Pepper, as the most\r\ndecisive thing; "and we must have it; and then wait for it."\r\n\r\n"Tisn\'t pleasant up at the Peterses," grumbled Joel, taking the parcel\r\nand moving slowly off.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Polly," said Mrs. Pepper, "you needn\'t do that," seeing\r\nPolly take up some sewing after doing up the room and finishing the\r\nsemi-weekly bake; "you\'re all beat out with that tussle over the stove;\r\nthat sack\'ll have to go till next week."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t, mammy," said Polly, snipping off a basting thread; "we\'ve got\r\nto have the money; how much\'ll he give you for it?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty cents," replied Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Polly, "we\'ve got to get all the thirty centses we can,\r\nmammy dear; and I know I can do it, truly--try me once," she implored.\r\n\r\n"Well." Mrs. Pepper relented, slowly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t feel bad, mammy dear," comforted Polly, sewing away briskly;\r\n"Ben\'ll get well pretty soon, and then we\'ll be all right."\r\n\r\n"Maybe," said Mrs. Pepper; and went back to Phronsie, who could scarcely\r\nlet her out of her sight.\r\n\r\nPolly stitched away bravely. "Now if I do this good, mammy\'ll let me do\r\nit other times," she said to herself.\r\n\r\nDavie, too, worked patiently out of doors, trying to do Ben\'s chores.\r\nThe little fellow blundered over things that Ben would have accomplished\r\nin half the time, and he had to sit down often on the steps of the\r\nlittle old shed where the tools were kept, to wipe his hot face and\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n"Polly," said Mrs. Pepper, "hadn\'t you better stop a little? Dear me!\r\nhow fast you sew, child!"\r\n\r\nPolly gave a delighted little hum at her mother\'s evident approval.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to do \'em all next week, mammy," she said; "then Mr. Atkins\r\nwon\'t take \'em away from us, I guess."\r\n\r\nMr. Atkins kept the store, and gave out coats and sacks of coarse linen\r\nand homespun to Mrs. Pepper to make; and it was the fear of losing the\r\nwork that had made the mother\'s heart sink.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe anybody\'s got such children as I have," she said; and\r\nshe gave Polly a motherly little pat that the little daughter felt clear\r\nto the tips of her toes with a thrill of delight.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past two, long after dinner, Joe came walking in, hungry as a\r\nbeaver, but flushed and triumphant.\r\n\r\n"Why, where have you been all this time?" asked his mother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joe, you didn\'t stop to play?" asked Polly, from her perch where\r\nshe sat sewing, giving him a reproachful glance.\r\n\r\n"Stop to play!" retorted Joe, indignantly; "no, I guess I didn\'t! I\'ve\r\nbeen to Old Peterses."\r\n\r\n"Not all this time!" exclaimed Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have too," replied Joel, sturdily marching up to her. "And\r\nthere\'s your money, mother;" and he counted out a quarter of a dollar\r\nin silver pieces and pennies, which he took from a dingy wad of paper,\r\nstowed away in the depths of his pocket.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joe," said Mrs. Pepper, sinking back in her chair and looking at\r\nhim; "what do you mean?"\r\n\r\nPolly put her work in her lap, and waited to hear.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s my dinner, Polly?" asked Joel; "I hope it\'s a big one.\r\n\r\n"Yes, \'tis," said Polly; "you\'ve got lots to-day, it\'s in the corner of\r\nthe cupboard, covered up with the plate--so tell on, Joe."\r\n\r\n"That\'s elegant!" said Joel, coming back with the well-filled plate,\r\nBen\'s and his own share.\r\n\r\n"Do tell us, Joey," implored Polly; "mother\'s waiting."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joel, his mouth half full, "I waited--and he said the coat\r\nwas all right;--and--and--Mrs. Peters said \'twas all right;--and Mirandy\r\nPeters said \'twas all right; but they didn\'t any of \'em say anythin\'\r\nabout payin\', so I didn\'t think \'twas all right--and--and--can\'t I have\r\nsome more butter, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly, sorry to refuse him, he\'d been so good about the\r\nmoney; "the butter\'s got to be saved for Ben and Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Joe, "I wish Miss Henderson would send us some more, I do! I\r\nthink she might!"\r\n\r\n"For shame, Joe," said Mrs. Pepper; "she was very good to send this, I\r\nthink; now what else did you say?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joel, taking another mouthful of bread, "so I waited; you\r\ntold me to, mother, you know--and they all went to work; and they didn\'t\r\nmind me at all, and--there wasn\'t anything to look at, so I sat--and\r\nsat--Polly, can\'t I have some gingerbread?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly, "it\'s all gone; I gave the last piece to Phronsie the\r\nday she was taken sick."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Joel, "everything\'s gone."\r\n\r\n"Well, do go on, Joe, do."\r\n\r\n"And--then they had dinner; and Mr. Peters said, \'Hasn\'t that boy gone\r\nhome yet?\' and Mrs. Peters said, \'no\'--and he called me in, and asked me\r\nwhy I didn\'t run along home; and I said, Phronsie was sick, and Ben had\r\nthe squeezles--"\r\n\r\n"The what?" said Polly.\r\n\r\n"The squeezles," repeated Joel, irritably; "that\'s what you said."\r\n\r\n"It\'s measles, Joey," corrected Mrs. Pepper; "never mind, I wouldn\'t\r\nfeel bad."\r\n\r\n"Well, they all laughed, and laughed, and then I said you told me to\r\nwait till I did get the money."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joe," began Mrs. Pepper, "you shouldn\'t have told \'em so--what did\r\nhe say?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he laughed, and said I was a smart boy, and he\'d see; and Mirandy\r\nsaid, \'do pay him, pa, he must be tired to death\'--and don\'t you think,\r\nhe went to a big desk in the corner, and took out a box, and \'twas full\r\nmost of money--lots! oh! and he gave me mine--and--that\'s all; and I\'m\r\ntired to death." And Joel flung himself down on the floor, expanded his\r\nlegs as only Joel could, and took a comfortable roll.\r\n\r\n"So you must be," said Polly, pityingly, "waiting at those Peterses."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ever want to see any more Peterses," said Joel; never, never,\r\nnever!\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," thought Polly, as she sewed on into the afternoon, "I wonder\r\nwhat does all my eyes! feels just like sand in \'em;" and she rubbed and\r\nrubbed to thread her needle. But she was afraid her mother would see,\r\nso she kept at her sewing. Once in awhile the bad feeling would go away,\r\nand then she would forget all about it. "There now, who says I can\'t do\r\nit! that\'s most done," she cried, jumping up, and spinning across the\r\nroom, to stretch herself a bit, "and to-morrow I\'ll finish it."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mrs. Pepper, "if you can do that, Polly, you\'ll be the\r\ngreatest help I\'ve had yet."\r\n\r\nSo Polly tucked herself into the old shake-down with a thankful heart\r\nthat night, hoping for morning.\r\n\r\nAlas! when morning did come, Polly could hardly move. The measles! what\r\nshould she do! A faint hope of driving them off made her tumble out\r\nof bed, and stagger across the room to look in the old cracked\r\nlooking-glass. All hope was gone as the red reflection met her gaze.\r\nPolly was on the sick list now!\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be sick," she said; "at any rate, I\'ll keep around." An awful\r\nfeeling made her clutch the back of a chair, but she managed somehow to\r\nget into her clothes, and go groping blindly into the kitchen. Somehow,\r\nPolly couldn\'t see very well. She tried to set the table, but \'twas no\r\nuse. "Oh, dear," she thought, "whatever\'ll mammy do?"\r\n\r\n"Hulloa!" said Joel, coming in, "what\'s the matter, Polly?" Polly\r\nstarted at his sudden entrance, and, wavering a minute, fell over in a\r\nheap.\r\n\r\n"Oh ma! ma!" screamed Joel, running to the foot of the stairs leading to\r\nthe loft, where Mrs. Pepper was with Ben; "something\'s taken Polly! and\r\nshe fell; and I guess she\'s in the wood-box!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARD DAYS FOR POLLY\r\n\r\n\r\n"Ma," said David, coming softly into the bedroom, where poor Polly\r\nlay on the bed with Phronsie, her eyes bandaged with a soft old\r\nhandkerchief, "I\'ll set the table."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t any table to set," said Mrs. Pepper, sadly; "there isn\'t\r\nanybody to eat anything, Davie; you and Joel can get something out of\r\nthe cupboard."\r\n\r\n"Can we get whatever we\'ve a mind to, ma?" cried Joel, who followed\r\nDavie, rubbing his face with a towel after his morning ablutions.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied his mother, absently.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Dave!" cried Joel; "we\'ll have a breakfast!"\r\n\r\n"We mustn\'t," said little Davie, doubtfully, "eat the whole, Joey."\r\n\r\nBut that individual already had his head in the cupboard, which soon\r\nengrossed them both.\r\n\r\nDr. Fisher was called in the middle of the morning to see what was the\r\nmatter with Polly\'s eyes. The little man looked at her keenly over his\r\nspectacles; then he said, "When were you taken?"\r\n\r\n"This morning," answered Polly, her eyes smarting.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you feel badly before?" questioned the doctor. Polly thought\r\nback; and then she remembered that she had felt very badly; that when\r\nshe was baking over the old stove the day before her back had ached\r\ndreadfully; and that, somehow, when she sat down to sew, it didn\'t stop;\r\nonly her eyes had bothered her so; she didn\'t mind her back so much.\r\n\r\n"I thought so," said the doctor, when Polly answered. "And those eyes\r\nof yours have been used too much; what has she been doing, ma\'am?" He\r\nturned around sharply on Mrs. Pepper as he asked this.\r\n\r\n"Sewing," said Mrs. Pepper, "and everything; Polly does everything,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said the doctor; "well, she won\'t again in one spell; her eyes\r\nare very bad."\r\n\r\nAt this a whoop, small but terrible to hear, came from the middle of the\r\nbed; and Phronsie sat bolt upright. Everybody started; while Phronsie\r\nbroke out, "Don\'t make my Polly sick! oh! please don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Hey!" said the doctor; and he looked kindly at the small object with\r\na very red face in the middle of the bed. Then he added, gently, "We\'re\r\ngoing to make Polly well, little girl; so that she can see splendidly."\r\n\r\n"Will you, really?" asked the child, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the doctor; "we\'ll try hard; and you mustn\'t cry; \'cause\r\nthen Polly\'ll cry, and that will make her eyes very bad; very bad\r\nindeed," he repeated, impressively.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t cry," said Phronsie; "no, not one bit." And she wiped off the\r\nlast tear with her fat little hand, and watched to see what next was to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Polly was left, very rebellious indeed, in the big bed, with a\r\ncooling lotion on the poor eyes, that somehow didn\'t cool them one bit.\r\n\r\n"If \'twas anythin\' but my eyes, mammy, I could stand it," she bewailed,\r\nflouncing over and over in her impatience; "and who\'ll do all the work\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think of the work, Polly," said Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do anything but think," said poor Polly.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment a queer noise out in the kitchen was heard.\r\n\r\n"Do go out, mother, and see what \'tis," said Polly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come," said a cracked voice, close up by the bedroom door,\r\nfollowed by a big black cap, which could belong to no other than Grandma\r\nBascom, "to set by you a spell; what\'s the matter?" she asked, and\r\nstopped, amazed to see Polly in bed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Polly\'s taken," screamed Mrs. Pepper in her ear.\r\n\r\n"Taken!" repeated the old lady, "what is it--a fit?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Mrs. Pepper; "the same as Ben\'s got; and Phronsie; the\r\nmeasles."\r\n\r\n"The measles, has she?" said grandma; "well, that\'s bad; and Ben\'s away,\r\nyou say."\r\n\r\n"No, he isn\'t either," screamed Mrs. Pepper, "he\'s got them, too!"\r\n\r\n"Got two what?" asked grandma.\r\n\r\n"Measles! he\'s got the measles too," repeated Mrs. Pepper, loud as she\r\ncould; so loud that the old lady\'s cap trembled at the noise.\r\n\r\n"Oh! the dreadful!" said grandma; "and this girl too?" laying her hand\r\non Phronsie\'s head.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Pepper, feeling it a little relief to tell over her\r\nmiseries; "all three of them!"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t," said Joel, coming in in hopes that grandma had a stray\r\npeppermint or two in her pocket, as she sometimes did; "and I\'m not\r\ngoing to, either."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," groaned his mother; "that\'s what Polly said; and she\'s\r\ngot \'em bad. It\'s her eyes," she screamed to grandma, who looked\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Her eyes, is it?" asked Mrs. Bascom; "well, I\'ve got a receet that\r\ncousin Samanthy\'s folks had when John\'s children had \'em; and I\'ll run\r\nright along home and get it," and she started to go.\r\n\r\n"No, you needn\'t," screamed Mrs. Pepper; "thank you, Mrs. Bascom; but\r\nDr. Fisher\'s been here; and he put something on Polly\'s eyes; and he\r\nsaid it mustn\'t be touched."\r\n\r\n"Hey?" said the old lady; so Mrs. Pepper had to go all over it again,\r\ntill at last she made her understand that Polly\'s eyes were taken care\r\nof, and they must wait for time to do the rest.\r\n\r\n"You come along of me," whispered grandma, when at last her call was\r\ndone, to Joel who stood by the door. "I\'ve got some peppermints to home;\r\nI forgot to bring \'em."\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Joel, brightening up.\r\n\r\n"Where you going, Joe?" asked Mrs. Pepper, seeing him move off with Mrs.\r\nBascom; "I may want you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve got to go over to grandma\'s," said Joel briskly; "she wants\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t be gone long then," replied his mother.\r\n\r\n"There," said grandma, going into her "keeping-room" to an old-fashioned\r\nchest of drawers; opening one, she took therefrom a paper, from which\r\nshe shook out before Joe\'s delighted eyes some red and white peppermint\r\ndrops. "There now, you take these home; you may have some, but be\r\nsure you give the most to the sick ones; and Polly--let Polly have the\r\nbiggest."\r\n\r\n"She won\'t take \'em," said Joel, wishing he had the measles. "Well, you\r\ntry her," said grandma; "run along now." But it was useless to tell Joel\r\nthat, for he was half-way home already. He carried out grandma\'s wishes,\r\nand distributed conscientiously the precious drops. But when he came to\r\nPolly, she didn\'t answer; and looking at her in surprise he saw two big\r\ntears rolling out under the bandage and wetting the pillow.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want \'em, Joe," said Polly, when he made her understand that\r\n"twas peppermints, real peppermints;" "you may have \'em."\r\n\r\n"Try one, Polly; they\'re real good," said Joel, who had an undefined\r\nwish to comfort; "there, open your mouth."\r\n\r\nSo Polly opened her mouth, and Joel put one in with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it good?" he asked, watching her crunch it.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly, "real good; where\'d you get \'em?"\r\n\r\n"Over to Grandma Bascom\'s," said Joel; "she gave me lots for all of us;\r\nhave another, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly, "not yet; you put two on my pillow where I can reach\r\n\'em; and then you keep the rest, Joel."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll put three," said Joel, counting out one red and two white ones,\r\nand laying them on the pillow; "there!"\r\n\r\n"And I want another, Joey, I do," said Phronsie from the other side of\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n"Well, you may have one," said Joel; "a red one, Phronsie; yes, you may\r\nhave two. Now come on, Dave; we\'ll have the rest out by the wood-pile."\r\n\r\nHow they ever got through that day, I don\'t know. But late in the\r\nafternoon carriage wheels were heard; and then they stopped right at the\r\nPeppers\' little brown gate.\r\n\r\n"Polly," said Mrs. Pepper, running to the bedroom door, "it\'s Mrs.\r\nHenderson!"\r\n\r\n"Is it?" said Polly, from the darkened room, "oh! I\'m so glad! is Miss\r\nJerushy with her?" she asked, fearfully.\r\n\r\n"No," said Mrs. Pepper, going back to ascertain; "why, it\'s the parson\r\nhimself! Deary! how we look!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, mammy," called back Polly, longing to spring out of bed and\r\nfix up a bit.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to hear the children are sick," said Mrs. Henderson, coming\r\nin, in her sweet, gentle way.\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t know it," said the minister, "until this morning--can we see\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, sir," said Mrs. Pepper; "Ben\'s upstairs; and Polly and Phronsie\r\nare in here."\r\n\r\n"Poor little things!" said Mrs. Henderson, compassionately; "hadn\'t you\r\nbetter," turning to the minister, "go up and see Ben first, while I will\r\nvisit the little girls?"\r\n\r\nSo the minister mounted the crooked stairs; and Mrs. Henderson went\r\nstraight up to Polly\'s side; and the first thing Polly knew, a cool,\r\ngentle hand was laid on her hot head, and a voice said, "I\'ve come to\r\nsee my little chicken now!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma\'am," said Polly, bursting into a sob, "I don\'t care about my\r\neyes--only mammy--" and she broke right down.\r\n\r\n"I know," said the minister\'s wife, soothingly; "but it\'s for you to\r\nbear patiently, Polly--what do you suppose the chicks were doing when I\r\ncame away?" And Mrs. Henderson, while she held Polly\'s hand, smiled and\r\nnodded encouragingly to Phronsie, who was staring at her from the other\r\nside of the bed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, ma\'am," said Polly; "please tell us."\r\n\r\n"Well, they were all fighting over a grasshopper--yes, ten of them."\r\n\r\n"Which one got it?" asked Polly in intense interest; "oh! I hope the\r\nwhite one did!"\r\n\r\n"Well, he looked as much like winning as any of them," said the lady,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"Bless her!" thought Mrs. Pepper to herself out in the kitchen,\r\nfinishing the sack Polly had left; "she\'s a parson\'s wife, I say!"\r\n\r\nAnd then the minister came down from Ben\'s room, and went into the\r\nbedroom; and Mrs. Henderson went up-stairs into the loft.\r\n\r\n"So," he said kindly, as after patting Phronsie\'s head he came over and\r\nsat down by Polly, "this is the little girl who came to see me when I\r\nwas sick."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir," said Polly, "I\'m so glad you wasn\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Well, when I come again," said Mr. Henderson, rising after a merry\r\nchat, "I see I shall have to slip a book into my pocket, and read for\r\nthose poor eyes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you!" cried Polly; and then she stopped and blushed.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is it?" asked the minister, encouragingly.\r\n\r\n"Ben loves to hear reading," said Polly.\r\n\r\n"Does he? well, by that time, my little girl, I guess Ben will be\r\ndown-stairs; he\'s all right, Polly; don\'t you worry about him--and I\'ll\r\nsit in the kitchen, by the bedroom door, and you can hear nicely."\r\n\r\nSo the Hendersons went away. But somehow, before they went, a good many\r\nthings found their way out of the old-fashioned chaise into the Peppers\'\r\nlittle kitchen.\r\n\r\nBut Polly\'s eyes didn\'t get any better, with all the care; and the lines\r\nof worry on Mrs. Pepper\'s face grew deeper and deeper. At last, she just\r\nconfronted Dr. Fisher in the kitchen, one day after his visit to Polly,\r\nand boldly asked him if they ever could be cured. "I know she\'s--and\r\nthere isn\'t any use keeping it from me," said the poor woman--"she\'s\r\ngoing to be stone-blind!"\r\n\r\n"My good woman," Dr. Fisher\'s voice was very gentle; and he took the\r\nhard, brown hand in his own--"your little girl will not be blind; I\r\ntell you the truth; but it will take some time to make her eyes quite\r\nstrong--time, and rest. She has strained them in some way, but she will\r\ncome out of it."\r\n\r\n"Praise the Lord!" cried Mrs. Pepper, throwing her apron over her\r\nhead; and then she sobbed on, "and thank you, sir--I can\'t ever thank\r\nyou--for--for--if Polly was blind, we might as well give up!"\r\n\r\nThe next day, Phronsie, who had the doctor\'s permission to sit up, only\r\nshe was to be kept from taking cold, scampered around in stocking-feet\r\nin search of her shoes, which she hadn\'t seen since she was first taken\r\nsick.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I want on my very best shoes," she cried; "can\'t I, mammy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Phronsie; you must keep them nice," remonstrated her mother;\r\n"you can\'t wear \'em every-day, you know."\r\n\r\n"\'Tisn\'t every-day," said Phronsie, slowly; "it\'s only one day."\r\n\r\n"Well, and then you\'ll want \'em on again tomorrow," said her mother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I won\'t!" cried Phronsie; "never, no more to-morrow, if I can\r\nhave \'em to-day; please, mammy dear!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pepper went to the lowest drawer in the high bureau, and took\r\ntherefrom a small parcel done up in white tissue paper. Slowly unrolling\r\nthis before the delighted eyes of the child, who stood patiently\r\nwaiting, she disclosed the precious red-topped shoes which Phronsie\r\nimmediately clasped to her bosom.\r\n\r\n"My own, very own shoes! whole mine!" she cried, and trudged out into\r\nthe kitchen to put them on herself.\r\n\r\n"Hulloa!" cried Dr. Fisher, coming in about a quarter of an hour later\r\nto find her tugging laboriously at the buttons--"new shoes! I declare!"\r\n\r\n"My own!" cried Phronsie, sticking out one foot for inspection, where\r\nevery button was in the wrong button-hole, "and they\'ve got red tops,\r\ntoo!"\r\n\r\n"So they have," said the doctor, getting down on the floor beside her;\r\n"beautiful red tops, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Be-yew-ti-ful," sang the child delightedly.\r\n\r\n"Does Polly have new shoes every day?" asked the doctor in a low voice,\r\npretending to examine the other foot.\r\n\r\nPhronsie opened her eyes very wide at this.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, she don\'t have anything, Polly don\'t."\r\n\r\n"And what does Polly want most of all--do you know? see if you can tell\r\nme." And the doctor put on the most alluring expression that he could\r\nmuster.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know!" cried Phronsie, with a very wise look. "There now," cried\r\nthe doctor, "you\'re the girl for me! to think you know! so, what is it?"\r\n\r\nPhronsie got up very gravely, and with one shoe half on, she leaned over\r\nand whispered in the doctor\'s ear:\r\n\r\n"A stove!"\r\n\r\n"A what?" said the doctor, looking at her, and then at the old, black\r\nthing in the corner, that looked as if it were ashamed of itself; "why,\r\nshe\'s got one."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the child, "it won\'t burn; and sometimes Polly cries, she\r\ndoes, when she\'s all alone--and I see her."\r\n\r\n"Now," said the doctor, very sympathetically, "that\'s too bad; that is!\r\nand then what does she do?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ben stuffs it up," said the child, laughing; "and so does Polly\r\ntoo, with paper; and then it all tumbles out quick; oh! just as quick!"\r\nAnd Phronsie shook her yellow head at the dismal remembrance.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose," said the doctor, getting up, "that you know of any\r\nsmart little girl around here, about four years old and that knows how\r\nto button on her own red-topped shoes, that would like to go to ride\r\nto-morrow morning in my carriage with me?\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do!" cried Phronsie, hopping on one toe; "it\'s me!"\r\n\r\n"Very well, then," said Dr. Fisher, going to the bedroom door, "we\'ll\r\nlookout for to-morrow, then."\r\n\r\nTo poor Polly, lying in the darkened room, or sitting up in the big\r\nrocking-chair--for Polly wasn\'t really very sick in other respects,\r\nthe disease having all gone into the merry brown eyes--the time seemed\r\ninterminable. Not to do anything! The very idea at any time would have\r\nfilled her active, wide-awake little body with horror; and now, here she\r\nwas!\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, I can\'t bear it!" she said, when she knew by the noise in the\r\nkitchen that everybody was out there; so nobody heard, except a fat, old\r\nblack spider in the corner, and he didn\'t tell anyone!\r\n\r\n"I know it\'s a week," she said, "since dinnertime! If Ben were only\r\nwell, to talk to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, Polly," screamed Joel at that moment running in, "Ben\'s\r\na-comin\' down the stairs!"\r\n\r\n"Stop, Joe," said Mrs. Pepper; "you shouldn\'t have told; he wanted to\r\nsurprise Polly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, is he!" cried Polly, clasping her hands in rapture; "mammy, can\'t I\r\ntake off this horrid bandage, and see him?"\r\n\r\n"Dear me, no!" said Mrs. Pepper, springing forward; "not for the world,\r\nPolly! Dr. Fisher\'d have our ears off!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I can hear, any way," said Polly, resigning herself to the\r\nremaining comfort; "here he is! oh, Ben!"\r\n\r\n"There," said Ben, grasping Polly, bandage and all; "now we\'re all\r\nright; and say, Polly, you\'re a brick!"\r\n\r\n"Mammy told me not to say that the other day," said Joel, with a very\r\nvirtuous air.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t help it," said Ben, who was a little wild over Polly, and\r\nbesides, he had been sick himself, and had borne a good deal too.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Mrs. Pepper, after the first excitement was over, "you\'re\r\nso comfortable together, and Phronsie don\'t want me now, I\'ll go to the\r\nstore; I must get some more work if Mr. Atkins\'ll give it to me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be all right now, mammy, that Ben\'s here," cried Polly, settling\r\nback into her chair, with Phronsie on the stool at her feet.\r\n\r\n"I\'m goin\' to tell her stories, ma," cried Ben, "so you needn\'t worry\r\nabout us."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it funny, Ben," said Polly, as the gate clicked after the mother,\r\n"to be sitting still, and telling stories in the daytime?"\r\n\r\n"Rather funny!" replied Ben.\r\n\r\n"Well, do go on," said Joel, as usual, rolling on the floor, in a\r\ndreadful hurry for the story to begin. Little David looked up quietly,\r\nas he sat on Ben\'s other side, his hands clasped tight together, just as\r\neager, though he said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Well; once upon a time," began Ben delightfully, and launched into one\r\nof the stories that the children thought perfectly lovely.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bensie," cried Polly, entranced, as they listened with bated\r\nbreath, "however do you think of such nice things!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had time enough to think, the last week," said Ben, laughing, "to\r\nlast a life-time!"\r\n\r\n"Do go on," put in Joel, impatient at the delay.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t hurry him so," said Polly, reprovingly; "he isn\'t strong."\r\n\r\n"Ben," said David, drawing a long breath, his eyes very big--, "did he\r\nreally see a bear?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Ben; "oh! where was I?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you said Tommy heard a noise," said Polly, "and he thought it was\r\na bear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Ben; "I remember; \'twasn\'t a--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, make it a bear, Ben!" cried Joel, terribly disappointed; "don\'t let\r\nit be not a bear."\r\n\r\n"Why, I can\'t," said Ben; "twouldn\'t sound true."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, make it sound true," insisted Joel; "you can make anything\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Ben, laughing; "I suppose I must."\r\n\r\n"Make it two bears, Ben," begged little Phronsie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Phronsie, that\'s too much," cried Joel; "that\'ll spoil it; but\r\nmake it a big bear, do Ben, and have him bite him somewhere, and most\r\nkill him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joel!" cried Polly, while David\'s eyes got bigger than ever.\r\n\r\nSo Ben drew upon his powers as story-teller, to suit his exacting\r\naudience, and was making his bear work havoc upon poor Tommy in a way\r\ncaptivating to all, even Joel, when, "Well, I declare," sounded Mrs.\r\nPepper\'s cheery voice coming in upon them, "if this isn\'t comfortable!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mammy!" cried Phronsie, jumping out of Polly\'s arms, whither she\r\nhad taken refuge during the thrilling tale, and running to her mother\r\nwho gathered her baby up, "we\'ve had a bear! a real, live bear, we have!\r\nBen made him!"\r\n\r\n"Have you!" said Mrs. Pepper, taking off her shawl, and laying her\r\nparcel of work down on the table, "now, that\'s nice!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mammy!" cried Polly, "it does seem so good to be all together\r\nagain!"\r\n\r\n"And I thank the Lord!" said Mrs. Pepper, looking down on her happy\r\nlittle group; and the tears were in her eyes--"and children, we ought to\r\nbe very good and please Him, for He\'s been so good to us."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOUD OVER THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Phronsie, with many crows of delight, and much chattering, had\r\ngotten fairly started the following morning on her much-anticipated\r\ndrive with the doctor, the whole family excepting Polly drawn up around\r\nthe door to see them off, Mrs. Pepper resolved to snatch the time and\r\nrun down for an hour or two to one of her customers who had long been\r\nwaiting for a little "tailoring" to be done for her boys.\r\n\r\n"Now, Joel," she said, putting on her bonnet before the cracked\r\nlooking-glass, "you stay along of Polly; Ben must go up to bed, the\r\ndoctor said; and Davie\'s going to the store for some molasses; so you\r\nand Polly must keep house."\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Joel; "may I have somethin\' to eat, ma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Pepper; "but don\'t you eat the new bread; you may have\r\nas much as you want of the old."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there any molasses, mammy?" asked Joel, as she bade Polly\r\ngood-bye! and gave her numberless charges "to be careful of your eyes,"\r\nand "not to let a crack of light in through the curtain," as the old\r\ngreen paper shade was called.\r\n\r\n"No; if you\'re very hungry, you can eat bread," said Mrs. Pepper,\r\nsensibly.\r\n\r\n"Joel," said Polly, after the mother had gone, "I do wish you could read\r\nto me."\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t," said Joel, glad he didn\'t know how; "I thought the\r\nminister was comin\'."\r\n\r\n"Well, he was," said Polly, "but mammy said he had to go out of town to\r\na consequence."\r\n\r\n"A what!" asked Joel, very much impressed.\r\n\r\n"A con--" repeated Polly. "Well, it began with a con--and I am\r\nsure--yes, very sure it was consequence."\r\n\r\n"That must be splendid," said Joel, coming up to her chair, and\r\nslowly drawing a string he held in his hand back and forth, "to go to\r\nconsequences, and everything! When I\'m a man, Polly Pepper, I\'m going to\r\nbe a minister, and have a nice time, and go--just everywhere!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joel!" exclaimed Polly, quite shocked; "you couldn\'t be one; you\r\naren\'t good enough."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Joel, not at all dashed by her plainness, "I\'ll be\r\ngood then--when I\'m a big man; don\'t you suppose, Polly," as a new idea\r\nstruck him, "that Mr. Henderson ever is naughty?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly, very decidedly; "never, never, never!"\r\n\r\n"Then, I don\'t want to be one," said Joel, veering round with a sigh of\r\nrelief, "and besides I\'d rather have a pair of horses like Mr. Slocum\'s,\r\nand then I could go everywheres, I guess!"\r\n\r\n"And sell tin?" asked Polly, "just like Mr. Slocum?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Joel; "this is the way I\'d go--Gee-whop! gee-whoa!" and Joel\r\npranced with his imaginary steeds all around the room, making about as\r\nmuch noise as any other four boys, as he brought up occasionally against\r\nthe four-poster or the high old bureau.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said a voice close up by Polly\'s chair, that made her skip with\r\napprehension, it was so like Miss Jerusha Henderson\'s--Joel was whooping\r\naway behind the bedstead to his horses that had become seriously\r\nentangled, so he didn\'t hear anything. But when Polly said, bashfully,\r\n"I can\'t see anything, ma\'am," he came up red and shining to the\r\nsurface, and stared with all his might.\r\n\r\n"I came to see you, little girl," said Miss Jerusha severely, seating\r\nherself stiffly by Polly\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am," said Polly, faintly.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s this boy?" asked the lady, turning around squarely on Joel, and\r\neying him from head to foot.\r\n\r\n"He\'s my brother Joel," said Polly.\r\n\r\nJoel still stared.\r\n\r\n"Which brother?" pursued Miss Jerusha, like a census-taker.\r\n\r\n"He is next to me," said Polly, wishing her mother was home; "he\'s nine,\r\nJoel is."\r\n\r\n"He\'s big enough to do something to help his mother," said Miss\r\nJerusha, looking him through and through. "Don\'t you think you might do\r\nsomething, when the others are sick, and your poor mother is working so\r\nhard?" she continued, in a cold voice.\r\n\r\n"I do something," blurted out Joel, sturdily, "lots and lots!"\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t say \'lots," reproved Miss Jerusha, with a sharp look over\r\nher spectacles, "tisn\'t proper for boys to talk so; what do you do all\r\nday long?" she asked, turning back to Polly, after a withering glance at\r\nJoel, who still stared.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do anything, ma\'am," replied Polly, sadly, "I can\'t see to do\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Well, you might knit, I should think," said her visitor, "it\'s dreadful\r\nfor a girl as big as you are to sit all day idle; I had sore eyes once\r\nwhen I was a little girl--how old are you?" she asked, abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Eleven last month," said Polly.\r\n\r\n"Well, I wasn\'t only nine when I knit a stocking; and I had sore eyes,\r\ntoo; you see I was a very little girl, and--"\r\n\r\n"Was you ever little?" interrupted Joel, in extreme incredulity, drawing\r\nnear, and looking over the big square figure.\r\n\r\n"Hey?" said Miss Jerusha; so Joel repeated his question before Polly\r\ncould stop him.\r\n\r\n"Of course," answered Miss Jerusha; and then she added, tartly, "little\r\nboys shouldn\'t speak unless they\'re spoken to. Now," and she turned back\r\nto Polly again, "didn\'t you ever knit a stocking?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am," said Polly, "not a whole one."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" exclaimed Miss Jerusha; "did I ever!" And she raised her\r\nblack mitts in intense disdain. "A big girl like you never to knit a\r\nstocking! to think your mother should bring you up so! and--"\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t bring us up," screamed Joel, in indignation, facing her with\r\nblazing eyes.\r\n\r\n"Joel," said Polly, "be still."\r\n\r\n"And you\'re very impertinent, too," said Miss Jerusha; "a good child\r\nnever is impertinent."\r\n\r\nPolly sat quite still; and Miss Jerusha continued:\r\n\r\n"Now, I hope you will learn to be industrious; and when I come again, I\r\nwill see what you have done."\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t ever coming again," said Joel, defiantly; "no, never!"\r\n\r\n"Joel!" implored Polly, and in her distress she pulled up her bandage\r\nas she looked at him; "you know mammy\'ll be so sorry at you! Oh, ma\'am,\r\nand" she turned to Miss Jerusha, who was now thoroughly aroused to the\r\nduty she saw before her of doing these children good, "I don\'t know what\r\nis the reason, ma\'am; Joel never talks so; he\'s real good; and--"\r\n\r\n"It only shows," said the lady, seeing her way quite clear for a little\r\nexhortation, "that you\'ve all had your own way from infancy; and that\r\nyou don\'t do what you might to make your mother\'s life a happy one."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma\'am," cried Polly, and she burst into a flood of tears, "please,\r\nplease don\'t say that!"\r\n\r\n"And I say," screamed Joel, stamping his small foot, "if you make Polly\r\ncry you\'ll kill her! Don\'t Polly, don\'t!" and the boy put both arms\r\naround her neck, and soothed and comforted her in every way he could\r\nthink of. And Miss Jerusha, seeing no way to make herself heard,\r\ndisappeared feeling pity for children who would turn away from good\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nBut still Polly cried on; all the pent-up feelings that had been so long\r\ncontrolled had free vent now. She really couldn\'t stop! Joel, frightened\r\nto death, at last said, "I\'m going to wake up Ben."\r\n\r\nThat brought Polly to; and she sobbed out, "Oh, no, Jo--ey--I\'ll stop."\r\n\r\n"I will," said Joel, seeing his advantage; "I\'m going, Polly," and he\r\nstarted to the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m done now, Joe," said Polly, wiping her eyes, and choking back\r\nher thoughts--"oh, Joe! I must scream! my eyes aches so!" and poor Polly\r\nfairly writhed all over the chair.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll I do?" said Joel, at his wits\' end, running back, "do you want\r\nsome water?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," gasped Polly; "doctor wouldn\'t let me; oh! I wish mammy\'d\r\ncome!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and look for her," suggested Joel, feeling as if he must do\r\nsomething; and he\'d rather be out at the gate, than to see Polly suffer.\r\n\r\n"That won\'t bring her," said Polly; trying to keep still; "I\'ll try to\r\nwait."\r\n\r\n"Here she is now!" cried Joel, peeping out of the window; "oh! goody!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOEL\'S TURN\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well," Mrs. Pepper\'s tone was unusually blithe as she stepped into the\r\nkitchen--"you\'ve had a nice time, I suppose--what in the world!" and she\r\nstopped at the bedroom door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mammy, if you\'d been here!" said Joel, while Polly sat still, only\r\nholding on to her eyes as if they were going to fly out; "there\'s been\r\na big woman here; she came right in--and she talked awfully! and Polly\'s\r\nbeen a-cryin\', and her eyes ache dreadfully--and--"\r\n\r\n"Been crying!" repeated Mrs. Pepper, coming up to poor Polly. "Polly\r\nbeen crying!" she still repeated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mammy, I couldn\'t help it," said Polly; "she said--" and in spite\r\nof all she could do, the rain of tears began again, which bade fair to\r\nbe as uncontrolled as before. But Mrs. Pepper took her up firmly in her\r\narms, as if she were Phronsie, and sat down in the old rocking-chair and\r\njust patted her back.\r\n\r\n"There, there," she whispered, soothingly, "don\'t think of it, Polly;\r\nmother\'s got home."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mammy," said Polly, crawling up to the comfortable neck for\r\nprotection, "I ought not to mind; but \'twas Miss Jerusha Henderson; and\r\nshe said--"\r\n\r\n"What did she say?" asked Mrs. Pepper, thinking perhaps it to be the\r\nwiser thing to let Polly free her mind.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she said that we ought to be doing something; and I ought to knit,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"Go on," said her mother.\r\n\r\n"And then Joel got naughty; oh, mammy, he never did so before; and I\r\ncouldn\'t stop him," cried Polly, in great distress; "I really couldn\'t,\r\nmammy--and he talked to her; and he told her she wasn\'t ever coming here\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Joel shouldn\'t have said that," said Mrs. Pepper, and under her breath\r\nsomething was added that Polly even failed to hear--"but no more she\r\nisn\'t!"\r\n\r\n"And, mammy," cried Polly--and she flung her arms around her mother\'s\r\nneck and gave her a grasp that nearly choked Mrs. Pepper, "ain\'t I\r\nhelpin\' you some, mammy? Oh! I wish I could do something big for you?\r\nAin\'t you happy, mammy?"\r\n\r\n"For the land\'s sakes!" cried Mrs. Pepper, straining Polly to her heart,\r\n"whatever has that woman--whatever could she have said to you? Such a\r\ngirl as you are, too!" cried Mrs. Pepper, hugging Polly, and covering\r\nher with kisses so tender, that Polly, warmed and cuddled up to her\r\nheart\'s content, was comforted to the full.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mrs. Pepper, when at last she thought she had formed\r\nbetween Polly and Joel about the right idea of the visit, "well, now we\r\nwon\'t think of it, ever any more; \'tisn\'t worth it, Polly, you know."\r\n\r\nBut poor Polly! and poor mother! They both were obliged to think of it.\r\nNothing could avert the suffering of the next few days, caused by that\r\nlong flow of burning tears.\r\n\r\n"Nothing feels good on \'em, mammy," said Polly, at last, twisting her\r\nhands in the vain attempt to keep from rubbing the aching, inflamed eyes\r\nthat drove her nearly wild with their itching, "there isn\'t any use in\r\ntrying anything."\r\n\r\n"There will be use," energetically protested Mrs. Pepper, bringing\r\nanother cool bandage, "as long as you\'ve got an eye in your head, Polly\r\nPepper!"\r\n\r\nDr. Fisher\'s face, when he first saw the change that the fateful visit\r\nhad wrought, and heard the accounts, was very grave indeed. Everything\r\nhad been so encouraging on his last visit, that he had come very near\r\npromising Polly speedy freedom from the hateful bandage.\r\n\r\nBut the little Pepper household soon had something else to think of more\r\nimportant even than Polly\'s eyes, for now the heartiest, the jolliest\r\nof all the little group was down--Joel. How he fell sick, they scarcely\r\nknew, it all came so suddenly. The poor, bewildered family had hardly\r\ntime to think, before delirium and, perhaps, death stared them in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\nWhen Polly first heard it, by Phronsie\'s pattering downstairs and\r\nscreaming: "Oh, Polly, Joey\'s dre-ad-ful sick, he is!" she jumped right\r\nup, and tore off the bandage.\r\n\r\n"Now, I will help mother! I will, so there!" and in another minute she\r\nwould have been up in the sick room. But the first thing she knew, a\r\ngentle but firm hand was laid upon hers; and she found herself back\r\nagain in the old rocking-chair, and listening to the Doctor\'s words\r\nwhich were quite stern and decisive.\r\n\r\n"Now, I tell you," he said, "you must not take off that bandage again;\r\ndo you know the consequences? You will be blind! and then you will be a\r\ncare to your mother all your life!"\r\n\r\n"I shall be blind, anyway," said Polly, despairingly; "so \'twon\'t make\r\nany difference."\r\n\r\n"No; your eyes will come out of it all right, only I did hope," and the\r\ngood doctor\'s face fell--"that the other two boys would escape; but,"\r\nand he brightened up at sight of Polly\'s forlorn visage--"see you do\r\nyour part by keeping still."\r\n\r\nBut there came a day soon when everything was still around the once\r\nhappy little brown house--when only whispers were heard from white lips;\r\nand thoughts were fearfully left unuttered.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of one of these days, when Mrs. Pepper felt she could not\r\nexist an hour longer without sleep, kind Mrs. Beebe came to stay until\r\nthings were either better or worse.\r\n\r\nStill the cloud hovered, dark and forbidding. At last, one afternoon,\r\nwhen Polly was all alone, she could endure it no longer. She flung\r\nherself down by the side of the old bed, and buried her face in the gay\r\npatched bed-quilt.\r\n\r\n"Dear God," she said, "make me willing to have anything," she\r\nhesitated--"yes, anything happen; to be blind forever, and to have Joey\r\nsick, only make me good."\r\n\r\nHow long she staid there she never knew; for she fell asleep--the first\r\nsleep she had had since Joey was taken sick. And little Mrs. Beebe\r\ncoming in found her thus.\r\n\r\n"Polly," the good woman said, leaning over her, "you poor, pretty\r\ncreeter, you; I\'m goin\' to tell you somethin\'--there, there, just to\r\nthink! Joel\'s goin\' to get well!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Beebe!" cried Polly, tumbling over in a heap on the floor, her\r\nface, as much as could be seen under the bandage, in a perfect glow, "Is\r\nhe, really?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure; the danger\'s all over now," said the little old lady,\r\ninwardly thinking--"If I hadn\'t a-come!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, the Lord wants him to," cried Polly, in rapture; "don\'t he,\r\nMrs. Beebe?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure--to be sure," repeated the kind friend, only half\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t care about my eyes, then," cried Polly; and to Mrs.\r\nBeebe\'s intense astonishment and dismay, she spun round and round in the\r\nmiddle of the floor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Polly, Polly!" the little old lady cried, running up to her, "do\r\nstop! the doctor wouldn\'t let you! he wouldn\'t really, you know! it\'ll\r\nall go to your eyes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," repeated Polly, in the middle of a spin; but she\r\nstopped obediently; "seems as if I just as soon be blind as not; it\'s so\r\nbeautiful Joey\'s going to get well!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNSHINE AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as Joel was smitten down suddenly, so he came up quickly, and his\r\nhearty nature asserted itself by rapid strides toward returning health;\r\nand one morning he astonished them all by turning over suddenly and\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n"I want something to eat!"\r\n\r\n"Bless the Lord!" cried Mrs. Pepper, "now he\'s going to live!"\r\n\r\n"But he mustn\'t eat," protested Mrs. Beebe, in great alarm, trotting for\r\nthe cup of gruel. "Here, you pretty creeter you, here\'s something nice."\r\nAnd she temptingly held the spoon over Joel\'s mouth; but with a grimace\r\nhe turned away.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I want something to eat! some gingerbread or some bread and\r\nbutter."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" ejaculated Mrs. Beebe. "Gingerbread!" Poor Mrs. Pepper saw\r\nthe hardest part of her trouble now before her, as she realized that the\r\nreturning appetite must be fed only on strengthening food; for where it\r\nwas to come from she couldn\'t tell.\r\n\r\n"The Lord only knows where we\'ll get it," she groaned within herself.\r\n\r\nYes, He knew. A rap at the door, and little David ran down to find the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mammy," he said, "Mrs. Henderson sent it--see! see!" And in the\r\ngreatest excitement he placed in her lap a basket that smelt savory and\r\nnice even before it was opened. When it was opened, there lay a little\r\nbird delicately roasted, and folded in a clean napkin; also a glass of\r\njelly, crimson and clear.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joey," cried Mrs. Pepper, almost overwhelmed with joy, "see what\r\nMrs. Henderson sent you! now you can eat fit for a king!"\r\n\r\nThat little bird certainly performed its mission in life; for as Mrs.\r\nBeebe said, "It just touched the spot!" and from that very moment Joel\r\nimproved so rapidly they could hardly believe their eyes.\r\n\r\n"Hoh! I haven\'t been sick!" he cried on the third day, true to his\r\nnature. "Mammy, I want to get up."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no! you mustn\'t, Joel," cried Mrs. Pepper in a fright,\r\nrunning up to him as he was preparing to give the bedclothes a lusty\r\nkick; "you\'ll send \'em in."\r\n\r\n"Send what in?" asked Joel, looking up at his mother in terror, as the\r\ndreadful thought made him pause.\r\n\r\n"Why, the measles, Joey; they\'ll all go in if you get out."\r\n\r\n"How they goin\' to get in again, I\'d like to know?" asked Joel, looking\r\nat the little red spots on his hands in incredulity; say, ma!\r\n\r\n"Well, they will," said his mother, "as you\'ll find to your sorrow if\r\nyou get out of bed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Joel, beginning to whimper, as he drew into bed again,\r\n"when can I get up, mammy!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, in a day or two," responded Mrs. Pepper, cheerfully; "you\'re\r\ngetting on so finely you\'ll be as smart as a cricket! Shouldn\'t you\r\nsay he might get up in a day or two, Mrs. Beebe?" she appealed to that\r\nindividual who was knitting away cheerily in the corner.\r\n\r\n"Well, if he keeps on as he\'s begun, I shouldn\'t know what to think,"\r\nreplied Mrs. Beebe. "It beats all how quick he\'s picked up. I never see\r\nanything like it, I\'m sure!"\r\n\r\nAnd as Mrs. Beebe was a great authority in sickness, the old, sunny\r\ncheeriness began to creep into the brown house once more, and to bubble\r\nover as of yore.\r\n\r\n"Seems as if \'twas just good to live," said Mrs. Pepper, thankfully\r\nonce, when her thoughts were too much for her. "I don\'t believe I shall\r\never care how poor we are," she continued, "as long as we\'re together."\r\n\r\n"And that\'s just what the Lord meant, maybe," replied good Mrs. Beebe,\r\nwho was preparing to go home.\r\n\r\nJoel kept the house in a perfect uproar all through his getting well.\r\nMrs. Pepper observed one day, when he had been more turbulent than\r\nusual, that she was "almost worn to a thread."\r\n\r\n"Twasn\'t anything to take care of you, Joe," she added, "when you were\r\nreal sick, because then I knew where you were; but--well, you won\'t ever\r\nhave the measles again, I s\'pose, and that\'s some comfort!"\r\n\r\nLittle David, who had been nearly stunned by the sickness that had laid\r\naside his almost constant companion, could express his satisfaction and\r\njoy in no other way than by running every third minute and begging to do\r\nsomething for him. And Joel, who loved dearly to be waited on, improved\r\nevery opportunity that offered; which Mrs. Pepper observing, soon put a\r\nstop to.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll run his legs off, Joel," at last she said, when he sent David\r\nthe third time down to the wood-pile for a stick of just the exact\r\nthickness, and which the little messenger declared wasn\'t to be found.\r\n"Haven\'t you any mercy? You\'ve kept him going all day, too," she added,\r\nglancing at David\'s pale face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mammy," panted David, "don\'t; I love to go. Here Joe, is the best I\r\ncould find," handing him a nice smooth stick.\r\n\r\n"I know you do," said his mother; "but Joe\'s getting better now, and he\r\nmust learn to spare you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to spare folks," grumbled Joel, whittling away with\r\nenergy; "I\'ve been sick--real sick," he added, lifting his chubby face\r\nto his mother to impress the fact.\r\n\r\n"I know you have," she cried, running to kiss her boy; "but now, Joe,\r\nyou\'re most well. To-morrow I\'m going to let you go down-stairs; what do\r\nyou think of that!"\r\n\r\n"Hooray!" screamed Joel, throwing away the stick and clapping his hands,\r\nforgetting all about his serious illness, "that\'ll be prime!"\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you too sick to go, Joey?" asked Mrs. Pepper, mischievously.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not sick," cried Joel, in the greatest alarm, fearful his\r\nmother meant to take back the promise; "I\'ve never been sick. Oh, mammy!\r\nyou know you\'ll let me go, won\'t your?"\r\n\r\n"I guess so," laughed his mother.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Phron," cried Joel, giving her a whirl.\r\n\r\nDavid, who was too tired for active sport, sat on the floor and watched\r\nthem frolic in great delight.\r\n\r\n"Mammy," said he, edging up to her side as the sport went on, "do you\r\nknow, I think it\'s just good--it\'s--oh, it\'s so frisky since Joe got\r\nwell, isn\'t it, mammy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," said Mrs. Pepper, giving him a radiant look in return for\r\nhis; "and when Polly\'s around again with her two eyes all right--well, I\r\ndon\'t know what we shall do, I declare!"\r\n\r\n"Boo!" cried a voice, next morning, close to Polly\'s elbow, unmistakably\r\nJoel\'s.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joel Pepper!" she cried, whirling around, "is that really you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," cried that individual, confidently, "it\'s I; oh, I say, Polly,\r\nI\'ve had fun up-stairs, I tell you what!"\r\n\r\n"Poor boy!" said Polly, compassionately.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t a poor boy," cried Joel, indignantly; "I had splendid things\r\nto eat; oh, my!" and he closed one eye and smacked his lips in the\r\ndelightful memory.\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Polly, "and I\'m so glad, Joel."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose I\'ll ever get so many again," observed Joel,\r\nreflectively, after a minute\'s pause, as one and another of the wondrous\r\ndelicacies rose before his mind\'s eye; "not unless I have the measles\r\nagain--say, Polly, can\'t I have \'em again?"\r\n\r\n"Mercy, no!" cried Polly, in intense alarm, "I hope not."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t," said Joel, "I wish I could have \'em sixty--no--two\r\nhundred times, so there!"\r\n\r\n"Well, mammy couldn\'t take care of you," said Ben; "you don\'t know what\r\nyou\'re sayin\', Joe."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I wish I could have the things without the measles," said\r\nJoel, willing to accommodate; "only folks won\'t send \'em," he added, in\r\nan injured tone.\r\n\r\n"Polly\'s had the hardest time of all," said her mother, affectionately\r\npatting the bandage.\r\n\r\n"I think so too," put in Ben; "if my eyes were hurt I\'d give up."\r\n\r\n"So would I," said David; and Joel, to be in the fashion, cried also, "I\r\nknow I would;" while little Phronsie squeezed up to Polly\'s side, "And\r\nI, too."\r\n\r\n"Would what, Puss?" asked Ben, tossing her up high. "Have good things,"\r\ncried the child, in delight at understanding the others, "I would\r\nreally, Ben," she cried, gravely, when they all screamed.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope so," said Ben, tossing her higher yet. "Don\'t laugh at\r\nher, boys," put in Polly; "we\'re all going to have good times now,\r\nPhronsie, now we\'ve got well."\r\n\r\n"Yes," laughed the child from her high perch; "we aren\'t ever goin\' to\r\nbe sick again, ever--any more," she added impressively.\r\n\r\nThe good times were coming for Polly--coming pretty near, and she\r\ndidn\'t know it! All the children were in the secret; for as Mrs. Pepper\r\ndeclared, "They\'d have to know it; and if they were let into the secret\r\nthey\'d keep it better."\r\n\r\nSo they had individually and collectively been intrusted with the\r\nprecious secret, and charged with the extreme importance of "never\r\nletting any one know," and they had been nearly bursting ever since with\r\nthe wild desire to impart their knowledge.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I shall tell," said David, running to his mother at last;\r\n"oh, mammy, I don\'t dare stay near Polly, I do want to tell so bad."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, you won\'t, David," said his mother encouragingly, "when you\r\nknow mother don\'t want you to; and besides, think how Polly\'ll look when\r\nshe sees it."\r\n\r\n"I know," cried David in the greatest rapture, "I wouldn\'t tell for all\r\nthe world! I guess she\'ll look nice, don\'t you mother?" and he laughed\r\nin glee at the thought.\r\n\r\n"Poor child! I guess she will!" and then Mrs. Pepper laughed too, till\r\nthe little old kitchen rang with delight at the accustomed sound.\r\n\r\nThe children all had to play "clap in and clap out" in the bedroom while\r\nit came; and "stage coach," too--"anything to make a noise," Ben said.\r\nAnd then after they got nicely started in the game, he would be missing\r\nto help about the mysterious thing in the kitchen, which was safe since\r\nPolly couldn\'t see him go on account of her bandage. So she didn\'t\r\nsuspect in the least. And although the rest were almost dying to be\r\nout in the kitchen, they conscientiously stuck to their bargain to keep\r\nPolly occupied. Only Joel would open the door and peep once; and then\r\nPhronsie behind him began. "Oh, I see the sto----" but David swooped\r\ndown on her in a twinkling, and smothered the rest by tickling her.\r\n\r\nOnce they came very near having the whole thing pop out. "Whatever is\r\nthat noise in the kitchen?" asked Polly, as they all stopped to\r\ntake breath after the scuffle of "stage coach." "It sounds just like\r\ngrating."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and see," cried Joel, promptly; and then he flew out where his\r\nmother and Ben and two men were at work on a big, black thing in the\r\ncorner. The old stove, strange to say, was nowhere to be seen! Something\r\nelse stood in its place, a shiny, black affair, with a generous supply\r\nof oven doors, and altogether such a comfortable, home-like look about\r\nit, as if it would say--"I\'m going to make sunshine in this house!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joel," cried his mother, turning around on him with very black\r\nhands, "you haven\'t told!"\r\n\r\n"No," said Joel, "but she\'s hearin\' the noise, Polly is."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Ben, to one of the men.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t put it up without some noise," the man replied, "but we\'ll be\r\nas still as we can."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a big one, ma?" asked Joel, in the loudest of stage whispers,\r\nthat Polly on the other side of the door couldn\'t have failed to hear if\r\nPhronsie hadn\'t laughed just then.\r\n\r\n"Go back, Joe, do," said Ben, "play tag--anything," he implored, "we\'ll\r\nbe through in a few minutes."\r\n\r\n"It takes forever!" said Joel, disappearing within the bedroom door.\r\nLuckily for the secret, Phronsie just then ran a pin sticking up on the\r\narm of the old chair, into her finger; and Polly, while comforting her,\r\nforgot to question Joel. And then the mother came in, and though she had\r\nill-concealed hilarity in her voice, she kept chattering and bustling\r\naround with Polly\'s supper to such an extent that there was no chance\r\nfor a word to be got in.\r\n\r\nNext morning it seemed as if the "little brown house," would turn inside\r\nout with joy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mammy!" cried Polly, jumping into her arms the first thing, as Dr.\r\nFisher untied the bandage, "my eyes are new! just the same as if I\'d\r\njust got \'em! Don\'t they look different?" she asked, earnestly, running\r\nto the cracked glass to see for herself.\r\n\r\n"No," said Ben, "I hope not; the same brown ones, Polly."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Polly, hugging first one and then another, "everybody looks\r\ndifferent through them, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Oh," cried Joel, "come out into the kitchen, Polly; it\'s a great deal\r\nbetter out there."\r\n\r\n"May I?" asked Polly, who was in such a twitter looking at everything\r\nthat she didn\'t know which way to turn.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the doctor, smiling at her.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," sang Polly, "come mammy, we\'ll go first; isn\'t it just\r\nlovely--oh, MAMMY!" and Polly turned so very pale, and looked as if she\r\nwere going to tumble right over, that Mrs. Pepper grasped her arm in\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she asked, pointing to the corner, while all the children\r\nstood round in the greatest excitement.\r\n\r\n"Why," cried Phronsie, "it\'s a stove--don\'t you know, Polly?" But Polly\r\ngave one plunge across the room, and before anybody could think, she was\r\ndown on her knees with her arms flung right around the big, black thing,\r\nand laughing and crying over it, all in the same breath!\r\n\r\nAnd then they all took hold of hands and danced around it like wild\r\nlittle things; while Dr. Fisher stole out silently--and Mrs. Pepper\r\nlaughed till she wiped her eyes to see them go.\r\n\r\n"We aren\'t ever goin\' to have any more burnt bread," sang Polly, all out\r\nof breath.\r\n\r\n"Nor your back isn\'t goin\' to break any more," panted Ben, with a very\r\nred face.\r\n\r\n"Hooray!" screamed Joel and David, to fill any pause that might occur,\r\nwhile Phronsie gurgled and laughed at everything just as it came along.\r\nAnd then they all danced and capered again; all but Polly, who was\r\ndown before the precious stove examining and exploring into ovens and\r\neverything that belonged to it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma," she announced, coming up to Mrs. Pepper, who had been obliged\r\nto fly to her sewing again, and exhibiting a very crocky face and a\r\npair of extremely smutty hands, "it\'s most all ovens, and it\'s just\r\nsplendid!"\r\n\r\n"I know it," answered her mother, delighted in the joy of her child.\r\n"My! how black you are, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wish," cried Polly, as the thought struck her, "that Dr. Fisher\r\ncould see it! Where did he go to, ma?"\r\n\r\n"I guess Dr. Fisher has seen it before," said Mrs. Pepper, and then\r\nshe began to laugh. "You haven\'t ever asked where the stove came from,\r\nPolly."\r\n\r\nAnd to be sure, Polly had been so overwhelmed that if the stove had\r\nreally dropped from the clouds it would have been small matter of\r\nastonishment to her, as long as it had come; that was the main thing!\r\n\r\n"Mammy," said Polly, turning around slowly, with the stove-lifter in her\r\nhand, "did Dr. Fisher bring that stove?"\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t exactly bring it," answered her mother, "but I guess he knew\r\nsomething about it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s the splendidest, goodest man!" cried Polly, "that ever\r\nbreathed! Did he really get us that stove?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Pepper, "he would; I couldn\'t stop him. I don\'t know\r\nhow he found out you wanted one so bad; but he said it must be kept as a\r\nsurprise when your eyes got well."\r\n\r\n"And he saved my eyes!" cried Polly, full of gratitude. "I\'ve got a\r\nstove and two new eyes, mammy, just to think!"\r\n\r\n"We ought to be good after all our mercies," said Mrs. Pepper\r\nthankfully, looking around on her little group. Joel was engaged in the\r\npleasing occupation of seeing how far he could run his head into the\r\nbiggest oven, and then pulling it out to exhibit its blackness, thus\r\nengrossing the others in a perfect hubbub.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to bake my doctor some little cakes," declared Polly, when\r\nthere was comparative quiet.\r\n\r\n"Do, Polly," cried Joel, "and then leave one or two over."\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly; "we can\'t have any, because these must be very nice.\r\nMammy, can\'t I have some white on top, just once?" she pleaded.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," dubiously replied Mrs. Pepper; "eggs are dreadful dear,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Polly, recklessly; "I must just once for Dr.\r\nFisher."\r\n\r\n"I tell you, Polly," said Mrs. Pepper, "what you might do; you might\r\nmake him some little apple tarts--most every one likes them, you know."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Polly, with a sigh, "I s\'pose they\'ll have to do; but some\r\ntime, mammy, I\'m going to bake him a big cake, so there!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA THREATENED BLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, a few weeks after, Mrs. Pepper and Polly were busy in\r\nthe kitchen. Phronsie was out in the "orchard," as the one scraggy\r\napple-tree was called by courtesy, singing her rag doll to sleep under\r\nits sheltering branches. But "Baby" was cross and wouldn\'t go to sleep,\r\nand Phronsie was on the point of giving up, and returning to the house,\r\nwhen a strain of music made her pause with dolly in her apron. There\r\nshe stood with her finger in her mouth, in utter astonishment, wondering\r\nwhere the sweet sounds came from.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Phronsie!" screamed Polly, from the back door, "where are--oh,\r\nhere, come quick! it\'s the beau-ti-fullest!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" eagerly asked the little one, hopping over the stubby\r\ngrass, leaving poor, discarded "Baby" on its snubby nose where it\r\ndropped in her hurry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, a monkey!" cried Polly; "do hurry! the sweetest little monkey you\r\never saw!"\r\n\r\n"What is a monkey?" asked Phronsie, skurrying after Polly to the gate\r\nwhere her mother was waiting for them.\r\n\r\n"Why, a monkey\'s--a--monkey," explained Polly, "I don\'t know any\r\nbetter\'n that. Here he is! Isn\'t he splendid!" and she lifted Phronsie\r\nup to the big post where she could see finely.\r\n\r\n"O-oh! ow!" screamed little Phronsie, "see him, Polly! just see him!"\r\n\r\nA man with an organ was standing in the middle of the road playing away\r\nwith all his might, and at the end of a long rope was a lively little\r\nmonkey in a bright red coat and a smart cocked hat. The little creature\r\npulled off his hat, and with one long jump coming on the fence, he made\r\nPhronsie a most magnificent bow. Strange to say, the child wasn\'t in the\r\nleast frightened, but put out her little fat hand, speaking in gentle\r\ntones, "Poor little monkey! come here, poor little monkey!"\r\n\r\nTurning up his little wrinkled face, and glancing fearfully at his\r\nmaster, Jocko began to grimace and beg for something to eat. The man\r\npulled the string and struck up a merry tune, and in a minute the monkey\r\nspun around and around at such a lively pace, and put in so many queer\r\nantics that the little audience were fairly convulsed with laughter.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t pay you," said Mrs. Pepper, wiping her eyes, when at last the\r\nman pulled up the strap whistling to Jocko to jump up, "but I\'ll give\r\nyou something to eat; and the monkey, too, he shall have something for\r\nhis pains in amusing my children."\r\n\r\nThe man looked very cross when she brought him out only brown bread and\r\ntwo cold potatoes.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you got nothin\' better\'n that?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s as good as we have," answered Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\nThe man threw down the bread in the road. But Jocko thankfully ate his\r\nshare, Polly and Phronsie busily feeding him; and then he turned and\r\nsnapped up the portion his master had left in the dusty road.\r\n\r\nThen they moved on, Mrs. Pepper and Polly going back to their work in\r\nthe kitchen. A little down the road the man struck up another tune.\r\nPhronsie who had started merrily to tell "Baby" all about it, stopped a\r\nminute to hear, and--she didn\'t go back to the orchard!\r\n\r\nAbout two hours after, Polly said merrily:\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to call Phronsie in, mammy; she must be awfully tired and\r\nhungry by this time."\r\n\r\nShe sang gayly on the way, "I\'m coming, Phronsie, coming--why, where!--"\r\npeeping under the tree.\r\n\r\n"Baby" lay on its face disconsolately on the ground--and the orchard was\r\nempty! Phronsie was gone!\r\n\r\n"It\'s no use," said Ben, to the distracted household and such of the\r\nneighbors as the news had brought hurriedly to the scene, "to look any\r\nmore around here--but somebody must go toward Hingham; he\'d be likely to\r\ngo that way."\r\n\r\n"No one could tell where he would go," cried Polly, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n"But he\'d change, Ben, if he thought folks would think he\'d gone there,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\n"We must go all roads," said Ben, firmly; "one must take the stage to\r\nBoxville, and I\'ll take Deacon Brown\'s wagon on the Hingham road, and\r\nsomebody else must go to Toad Hollow."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go in the stage," screamed Joel, who could scarcely see out of his\r\neyes, he had cried so; "I\'ll find--find her--I know.\r\n\r\n"Be spry, then, Joe, and catch it at the corner!"\r\n\r\nEverybody soon knew that little Phronsie Pepper had gone off with "a\r\ncross organ man and an awful monkey!" and in the course of an hour\r\ndozens of people were out on the hot, dusty roads in search.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" asked a testy old gentleman in the stage, of Joel\r\nwho, in his anxiety to see both sides of the road at once, bobbed the\r\nold gentleman in the face so often as the stage lurched, that at last he\r\nknocked his hat over his eyes.\r\n\r\n"My sister\'s gone off with a monkey," explained Joel, bobbing over to\r\nthe other side, as he thought he caught sight of something pink that\r\nhe felt sure must be Phronsie\'s apron. "Stop! stop! there she is!"\r\nhe roared, and the driver, who had his instructions and was fully in\r\nsympathy, pulled up so suddenly that the old gentleman flew over into\r\nthe opposite seat.\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\nBut when they got up to it Joel saw that it was only a bit of pink\r\ncalico flapping on a clothes-line; so he climbed back and away they\r\nrumbled again.\r\n\r\nThe others were having the same luck. No trace could be found of the\r\nchild. To Ben, who took the Hingham road, the minutes seemed like hours.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go back," he muttered, "until I take her. I can\'t see mother\'s\r\nface!"\r\n\r\nBut the ten miles were nearly traversed; almost the last hope was gone.\r\nInto every thicket and lurking place by the road-side had he peered--but\r\nno Phronsie! Deacon Brown\'s horse began to lag.\r\n\r\n"Go on!" said Ben hoarsely; "oh, dear Lord, make me find her!"\r\n\r\nThe hot sun poured down on the boy\'s face, and he had no cap. What cared\r\nhe for that? On and on he went. Suddenly the horse stopped. Ben doubled\r\nup the reins to give him a cut, when "WHOA!" he roared so loud that the\r\nhorse in very astonishment gave a lurch that nearly flung him headlong.\r\nBut he was over the wheel in a twinkling, and up with a bound to a small\r\nthicket of scrubby bushes on a high hill by the road-side. Here lay a\r\nlittle bundle on the ground, and close by it a big, black dog; and over\r\nthe whole, standing guard, was a boy a little bigger than Ben, with\r\nhonest gray eyes. And the bundle was Phronsie!\r\n\r\n"Don\'t wake her up," said the boy, warningly, as Ben, with a hungry look\r\nin his eyes, leaped up the hill, "she\'s tired to death!"\r\n\r\n"She\'s my sister!" cried Ben, "our Phronsie!"\r\n\r\n"I know it," said the boy kindly; "but I wouldn\'t wake her up yet if I\r\nwere you. I\'ll tell you all about it," and he took Ben\'s hand which was\r\nas cold as ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFE\r\n\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, Prince," the boy added, encouragingly to the big dog\r\nwho, lifting his noble head, had turned two big eyes steadily on Ben.\r\n"He\'s all right! lie down again!"\r\n\r\nThen, flinging himself down on the grass, he told Ben how he came to\r\nrescue Phronsie.\r\n\r\n"Prince and I were out for a stroll," said he. "I live over in Hingham,"\r\npointing to the pretty little town just a short distance before them in\r\nthe hollow; "that is," laughing, "I do this summer. Well, we were out\r\nstrolling along about a mile below here on the cross-road; and all of a\r\nsudden, just as if they sprung right up out of the ground, I saw a man\r\nwith an organ, and a monkey, and a little girl, coming along the road.\r\nShe was crying, and as soon as Prince saw that, he gave a growl, and\r\nthen the man saw us, and he looked so mean and cringing I knew there\r\nmust be something wrong, and I inquired of him what he was doing with\r\nthat little girl, and then she looked up and begged so with her eyes,\r\nand all of a sudden broke away from him and ran towards me screaming--\'I\r\nwant Polly!\' Well, the man sprang after her; then I tell you--" here the\r\nboy forgot his caution about waking Phronsie--"we went for him, Prince\r\nand I! Prince is a noble fellow," (here the dog\'s ears twitched very\r\nperceptibly) "and he kept at that man; oh! how he bit him! till he had\r\nto run for fear the monkey would get killed."\r\n\r\n"Was Phronsie frightened?" asked Ben; "she\'s never seen strangers."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," said the boy, cheerily; "she just clung to me like\r\neverything--I only wish she was my sister," he added impulsively.\r\n\r\n"What were you going to do with her if I hadn\'t come along?" asked Ben.\r\n\r\n"Well, I got out on the main road," said the boy, "because I thought\r\nanybody who had lost her, would probably come through this way; but if\r\nsomebody hadn\'t come, I was going to carry her in to Hingham; and the\r\nfather and I\'d had to contrive some way to do."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Ben, as the boy finished and fastened his bright eyes on\r\nhim, "somebody did come along; and now I must get her home about as fast\r\nas I can for poor mammy--and Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the boy, "I\'ll help you lift her; perhaps she won\'t wake\r\nup."\r\n\r\nThe big dog moved away a step or two, but still kept his eye on\r\nPhronsie.\r\n\r\n"There," said the boy, brightly, as they laid the child on the wagon\r\nseat; "now when you get in you can hold her head; that\'s it," he added,\r\nseeing them both fixed to his satisfaction. But still Ben lingered.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," he tried to say.\r\n\r\n"I know," laughed the boy; "only it\'s Prince instead of me," and he\r\npulled forward the big black creature, who had followed faithfully down\r\nthe hill to see the last of it. "To the front, sir, there! We\'re coming\r\nto see you," he continued, "if you will let us--where do you live?"\r\n\r\n"Do come," said Ben, lighting up, for he was just feeling he couldn\'t\r\nbear to look his last on the merry, honest face; "anybody\'ll tell you\r\nwhere Mrs. Pepper lives."\r\n\r\n"Is she a Pepper?" asked the boy, laughing, and pointing to the\r\nunconscious little heap in the wagon; "and are you a Pepper?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ben, laughing too. "There are five of us besides mother.\r\n\r\n"Jolly! that\'s something like! Good-bye! Come on, Prince!" Then away\r\nhome to mother! Phronsie never woke up or turned over once till she was\r\nput, a little pink sleepy heap, into her mother\'s arms. Joel was there,\r\ncrying bitterly at his forlorn search. The testy old gentleman in the\r\nseat opposite had relented and ordered the coach about and brought\r\nhim home in an outburst of grief when all hope was gone. And one after\r\nanother they all had come back, disheartened, to the distracted mother.\r\nPolly alone, clung to hope!\r\n\r\n"Ben will bring her, mammy; I know God will let him," she whispered.\r\n\r\nBut when Ben did bring her, Polly, for the second time in her life,\r\ntumbled over with a gasp, into old Mrs. Bascom\'s lap.\r\n\r\nHome and mother! Little Phronsie slept all that night straight through.\r\nThe neighbors came in softly, and with awestruck visages stole into the\r\nbedroom to look at the child; and as they crept out again, thoughts\r\nof their own little ones tugging at their hearts, the tears would drop\r\nunheeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nUp the stairs of the hotel, two steps at a time, ran a boy with a big,\r\nblack dog at his heels. "Come on, Prince; soft, now," as they neared a\r\ndoor at the end of the corridors.\r\n\r\nIt opened into a corner room overlooking "the Park," as the small\r\nopen space in front of the hotel was called. Within the room there was\r\nsunshine and comfort, it being the most luxurious one in the house,\r\nwhich the proprietor had placed at the disposal of this most exacting\r\nguest. He didn\'t look very happy, however--the gentleman who sat in an\r\neasy chair by the window; a large, handsome old gentleman, whose whole\r\nbearing showed plainly that personal comfort had always been his, and\r\nwas, therefore, neither a matter of surprise nor thankfulness.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been?" he asked, turning around to greet the boy who\r\ncame in, followed by Prince.\r\n\r\n"Oh, such a long story, father!" he cried, flushed; his eyes sparkling\r\nas he flung back the dark hair from his forehead. "You can\'t even\r\nguess!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind now," said the old gentleman, testily; "your stories are\r\nalways long; the paper hasn\'t come--strange, indeed, that one must needs\r\nbe so annoyed! do ring that bell again."\r\n\r\nSo the bell was pulled; and a porter popped in his head.\r\n\r\n"What is it, sir?"\r\n\r\n"The paper," said the old gentleman, irritably; "hasn\'t it come yet?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir," said the man; and then he repeated, "taint in yet, please,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"Very well--you said so once; that\'s all," waving his hand; then as the\r\ndoor closed, he said to his son, "That pays one for coming to such an\r\nout-of-the-way country place as this, away from papers--I never will do\r\nit again."\r\n\r\nAs the old gentleman, against the advice of many friends who knew his\r\ndependence on externals, had determined to come to this very place, the\r\nboy was not much startled at the decisive words. He stood very quietly,\r\nhowever, until his father finished. Then he said:\r\n\r\n"It\'s too bad, father! supposing I tell you my story? Perhaps you\'ll\r\nenjoy hearing it while you wait--it\'s really quite newspaperish."\r\n\r\n"Well, you might as well tell it now, I suppose," said the old\r\ngentleman; "but it is a great shame about that paper! to advertise that\r\nmorning papers are to be obtained--it\'s a swindle, Jasper! a complete\r\nswindle!" and the old gentleman looked so very irate that the boy\r\nexerted himself to soothe him.\r\n\r\n"I know," he said; "but they can\'t help the trains being late."\r\n\r\n"They shouldn\'t have the trains late," said his father, unreasonably.\r\n"There\'s no necessity for all this prating about \'trains late.\' I\'m\r\nconvinced it\'s because they forgot to send down for the papers till they\r\nwere all sold."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that\'s it, father," said the boy, trying to change the\r\nsubject; "but you don\'t know how splendid Prince has been, nor--" "And\r\nthen such a breakfast!" continued the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n"My liver certainly will be in a dreadful state if these things\r\ncontinue!" And he got up, and going to the corner of the room, opened\r\nhis medicine chest, and taking a box of pills therefrom, he swallowed\r\ntwo, which done, he came back with a somewhat easier expression to his\r\nfavorite chair.\r\n\r\n"He was just splendid, father," began the boy; "he went for him, I tell\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"I hope, Jasper, your dog has not been doing anything violent," said the\r\nold gentleman. "I must caution you; he\'ll get you into trouble some day;\r\nand then there\'ll be a heavy bill to pay; he grows more irritable every\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"Irritable!" cried the boy, flinging his arms around the dog\'s neck, who\r\nwas looking up at the old gentleman in high disdain. "He\'s done the most\r\nsplendid thing you ever saw! Why, he saved a little girl, father, from\r\na cross old organ-man, and he drove that man--oh! you ought to have seen\r\nhim run!"\r\n\r\nAnd now that it was over, Jasper put back his head and laughed long and\r\nloud as he remembered the rapid transit of the musical pair.\r\n\r\n"Well, how do you know she wasn\'t the man\'s daughter?" asked his father,\r\ndetermined to find fault someway. "You haven\'t any business to go around\r\nthe country setting your dog on people. I shall have an awful bill\r\nto pay some day, Jasper--an awful bill!" he continued, getting up and\r\ncommencing to pace up and down the floor in extreme irritation.\r\n\r\n"Father," cried the boy, half laughing, half vexed, springing to his\r\nside, and keeping step with him, "we found her brother; he came along\r\nwhen we were by the side of the road. We couldn\'t go any further, for\r\nthe poor little thing was all tired out. And don\'t you think they live\r\nover in Badgertown, and--"\r\n\r\n"Well," said the old gentleman, pausing in his walk, and taking out\r\nhis watch to wonder if that paper would ever come, "she had probably\r\nfollowed the organ-man; so it served her right after all."\r\n\r\n"Well, but father," and the boy\'s dark eyes glowed, "she was such a\r\ncunning little thing! she wasn\'t more than four years old; and she had\r\nsuch a pretty little yellow head; and she said so funny--\'I want Polly."\r\n\r\n"Did she?" said the old gentleman, getting interested in spite of\r\nhimself; "what then?"\r\n\r\n"Why, then, sir," said Jasper, delighted at his success in diverting\r\nhis thoughts, "Prince and I waited--and waited; and I was just going to\r\nbring her here to ask you what we should do, when--" "Dear me!" said\r\nthe old gentleman, instinctively starting back as if he actually saw the\r\nforlorn little damsel, "you needn\'t ever bring such people here, Jasper!\r\nI don\'t know what to do with them, I\'m sure!"\r\n\r\n"Well," said the boy, laughing, "we didn\'t have to, did we, Prince?"\r\nstroking the big head of the dog who was slowly following the two as\r\nthey paced up and down, but keeping carefully on the side of his master;\r\n"for just as we really didn\'t know what to do, don\'t you think there was\r\na big wagon came along, drawn by the ricketiest old horse, and a boy in\r\nthe wagon looking both sides of the road, and into every bush, just as\r\nwild as he could be, and before I could think, hardly, he spied us, and\r\nif he didn\'t jump! I thought he\'d broken his leg--"\r\n\r\n"And I suppose he just abused you for what you had done," observed the\r\nold gentleman, petulantly; "that\'s about all the gratitude there is in\r\nthis world."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t seem to see me at all," said the boy. "I thought he\'d eat the\r\nlittle girl up."\r\n\r\n"Ought to have looked out for her better then," grumbled the old\r\ngentleman, determined to find fault with somebody.\r\n\r\n"And he\'s a splendid fellow, I just know," cried Jasper, waxing\r\nenthusiastic; "and his name is Pepper."\r\n\r\n"Pepper!" repeated his father; "no nice family ever had the name of\r\nPepper!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t care," and Jasper\'s laugh was loud and merry; "he\'s\r\nnice anyway,--I know; and the little thing\'s nice; and I\'m going to see\r\nthem--can\'t I, father?"\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said his father; "how can you, Jasper? You do have the\r\nstrangest tastes I ever saw!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s dreadful dull here," pleaded the boy, touching the right string;\r\n"you know that yourself, father, and I don\'t know any boys around here;\r\nand Prince and I are so lonely on our walks--do permit me, father!"\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman, who really cared very little about it, turned away,\r\nmuttering, "Well, I\'m sure I don\'t care; go where you like," when a\r\nknock was heard at the door, and the paper was handed in, which broke up\r\nthe conversation, and restored good humor.\r\n\r\nThe next day but one, Ben was out by the wood-pile, trying to break up\r\nsome kindlings for Polly who was washing up the dishes, and otherwise\r\npreparing for the delights of baking day.\r\n\r\n"Hulloa!" said a voice bethought he knew.\r\n\r\nHe turned around to see the merry-faced boy, and the big, black dog who\r\nimmediately began to wag his tail as if willing to recognize him.\r\n\r\n"You see I thought you\'d never look round," said the boy with a laugh.\r\n"How\'s the little girl?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! you have come, really," cried Ben, springing over the wood-pile\r\nwith a beaming face. "Polly!"\r\n\r\nBut Polly was already by the door, with dish-cloth in hand. "This is my\r\nsister, Polly," began Ben--and then stopped, not knowing the boy\'s name.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Jasper King," said the boy, stepping upon the flat stone by Polly\'s\r\nside; and taking off his cap, he put out his hand. "And this is Prince,"\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\nPolly put her hand in his, and received a hearty shake; and then she\r\nsprang over the big stove, dish-cloth and all, and just flung her arms\r\naround the dog\'s neck.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you splendid fellow, you!" said she. "Don\'t you know we all think\r\nyou\'re as good as gold?"\r\n\r\nThe dog submitted to the astonishing proceeding as if he liked it, while\r\nJasper, delighted with Polly\'s appreciation, beamed down on them, and\r\nstruck up friendship with her on the instant.\r\n\r\n"Now, I must call Phronsie," said Polly, getting up, her face as red as\r\na rose.\r\n\r\n"Is her name Phronsie?" asked the boy with interest.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s Sophronia," said Polly, "but we call her Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"What a very funny name," said Jasper, "Sophronia is, for such a little\r\nthing--and yours is Polly, is it not?" he asked, turning around suddenly\r\non her.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly; "no, not truly Polly; it\'s Mary, my real name is--but\r\nI\'ve always been Polly."\r\n\r\n"I like Polly best, too," declared Jasper, "it sounds so nice."\r\n\r\n"And his name is Ben," said Polly.\r\n\r\n"Ebenezer, you mean," said Ben, correcting her.\r\n\r\n"Well, we call him Ben," said Polly; "it don\'t ever seem as if there was\r\nany Ebenezer about it."\r\n\r\n"I should think not," laughed Jasper.\r\n\r\n"Well, I must get Phronsie," again said Polly, running back into the\r\nbedroom, where that small damsel was busily engaged in washing "Baby"\r\nin the basin of water that she had with extreme difficulty succeeded in\r\ngetting down on the floor. She had then, by means of a handful of soft\r\nsoap, taken from Polly\'s soap-bowl during the dish-washing, and a bit of\r\nold cotton, plastered both herself and "Baby" to a comfortable degree of\r\nstickiness.\r\n\r\n"Phronsie," said Polly--"dear me! what you doing? the big dog\'s out\r\nthere, you know, that scared the naughty organ-man; and the boy--" but\r\nbefore the words were half out, Phronsie had slipped from under her\r\nhands, and to Polly\'s extreme dismay, clattered out into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Here she is!" cried Jasper, meeting her at the door. The little soapy\r\nhands were grasped, and kissing her--"Ugh!" he said, as the soft soap\r\nplentifully spread on her face met his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Phronsie! you shouldn\'t," cried Polly, and then they all burst out\r\ninto a peal of laughter at Jasper\'s funny grimaces.\r\n\r\n"She\'s been washing \'Baby," explained Polly, wiping her eyes, and\r\nlooking at Phronsie who was hanging over Prince in extreme affection.\r\nEvidently Prince still regarded her as his especial property.\r\n\r\n"Have you got a baby?" asked Jasper. "I thought she was the baby,"\r\npointing to Phronsie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I mean her littlest dolly; she always calls her \'Baby," said Polly.\r\n"Come, Phronsie, and have your face washed, and a clean apron on."\r\n\r\nWhen Phronsie could be fairly persuaded that Prince would not run\r\naway during her absence, she allowed herself to be taken off; and soon\r\nre-appeared, her own, dainty little self. Ben, in the meantime, had\r\nbeen initiating Jasper into the mysteries of cutting the wood, the\r\ntool-house, and all the surroundings of the "little brown house." They\r\nhad received a re-inforcement in the advent of Joel and David, who\r\nstared delightedly at Phronsie\'s protector, made friends with the dog,\r\nand altogether had had such a thoroughly good time, that Phronsie,\r\ncoming back, clapped her hands in glee to hear them.\r\n\r\n"I wish mammy was home," said Polly, polishing up the last cup\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n"Let me put it up," said Jasper, taking it from her, "it goes up here,\r\ndon\'t it, with the rest?" reaching up to the upper-shelf of the old\r\ncupboard.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I should think you\'d have real good times!" said the boy,\r\nenviously. "I haven\'t a single sister or brother."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you?" said Polly, looking at him in extreme pity. "Yes, we do\r\nhave real fun," she added, answering his questioning look; "the house is\r\njust brimful sometimes, even if we are poor."\r\n\r\n"We aren\'t poor," said Joel, who never could bear to be pitied. Then,\r\nwith a very proud air, he said in a grand way, "At any rate, we aren\'t\r\ngoing to be, long, for something\'s coming!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Joey?" asked Ben, while the rest looked equally\r\namazed.\r\n\r\n"Our ships," said Joel confidently, as if they were right before their\r\neyes; at which they all screamed!\r\n\r\n"See Polly\'s stove!" cried Phronsie, wishing to entertain in her turn.\r\n"Here \'tis," running up to it, and pointing with her fat little finger.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see," cried Jasper, pretending to be greatly surprised; "it\'s\r\nnew, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the child; "it\'s very all new; four yesterdays ago!"\r\n\r\nAnd then Polly stopped in sweeping up and related, with many additions\r\nand explanations from the others, the history of the stove, and good Dr.\r\nFisher (upon whom they all dilated at great length), and the dreadful\r\nmeasles, and everything. And Jasper sympathized, and rejoiced with them\r\nto their hearts content, and altogether got so very home-like, that they\r\nall felt as if they had known him for a year. Ben neglected his work a\r\nlittle, but then visitors didn\'t come every day to the Peppers; so\r\nwhile Polly worked away at her bread, which she was "going to make like\r\nbiscuits," she said, the audience gathered in the little old kitchen was\r\nin the merriest mood, and enjoyed everything to the fullest extent.\r\n\r\n"Do put in another stick, Bensie dear," said Polly; "this bread won\'t be\r\nfit for anything!"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t this fun, though!" cried Jasper, running up to try the oven; "I\r\nwish I could ever bake," and he looked longingly at the little brown\r\nbiscuits waiting their turn out on the table.\r\n\r\n"You come out some day," said Polly, sociably, "and we\'ll all try\r\nbaking--mammy\'d like to have you, I know," feeling sure that nothing\r\nwould be too much for Mrs. Pepper to do for the protector of little\r\nPhronsie.\r\n\r\n"I will!" cried Jasper, perfectly delighted. "You can\'t think how\r\nawfully dull it is out in Hingham!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you live there?" asked Polly, with a gasp, almost dropping a tin\r\nfull of little brown lumps of dough she was carrying to the oven.\r\n\r\n"Live there!" cried Jasper; and then he burst out into a merry laugh.\r\n"No, indeed! I hope not! Why, we\'re only spending the summer there,\r\nfather and I, in the hotel."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s your mother?" asked Joel, squeezing in between Jasper and\r\nhis audience. And then they all felt instinctively that a very wrong\r\nquestion had been asked.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t any mother," said the boy, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nThey all stood quite still for a moment; then Polly said, "I wish you\'d\r\ncome out sometime; and you may bake--or anything else," she added; and\r\nthere was a kinder ring to her voice than ever.\r\n\r\nNo mother! Polly for her life, couldn\'t imagine how anybody could feel\r\nwithout a mother, but the very words alone smote her heart; and there\r\nwas nothing she wouldn\'t have done to give pleasure to one who had done\r\nso much for them.\r\n\r\n"I wish you could see our mother," she said, gently. "Why, here she\r\ncomes now! oh, mamsie, dear," she cried. "Do, Joe, run and take her\r\nbundle."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pepper stopped a minute to kiss Phronsie--her baby was dearer than\r\never to her now. Then her eye fell on Jasper, who stood respectfully\r\nwaiting and watching her with great interest.\r\n\r\n"Is this," she asked, taking it all in at the first glance--the boy with\r\nthe honest eyes as Ben had described him--and the big, black dog--"is\r\nthis the boy who saved my little girl?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma\'am," cried Jasper, "I didn\'t do much; \'twas Prince."\r\n\r\n"I guess you never\'ll know how much you did do," said Mrs. Pepper. Then\r\nlooking with a long, keen gaze into the boy\'s eyes that met her own so\r\nfrankly and kindly: "I\'ll trust him," she said to herself; "a boy with\r\nthose eyes can\'t help but be good."\r\n\r\n"Her eyes are just the same as Polly\'s," thought Jasper, "just such\r\nlaughing ones, only Polly\'s are brown," and he liked her on the spot.\r\n\r\nAnd then, somehow, the hubbub ceased. Polly went on with her work, and\r\nthe others separated, and Mrs. Pepper and Jasper had a long talk. When\r\nthe mother\'s eyes fell on Phronsie playing around on the floor, she gave\r\nthe boy a grateful smile that he thought was beautiful.\r\n\r\n"Well, I declare," said Jasper, at last, looking up at the old clock in\r\nthe corner by the side of the cupboard, "I\'m afraid I\'ll miss the stage,\r\nand then father never\'ll let me come again. Come, Prince."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t go," cried Phronsie, wailing. "Let doggie stay! Oh, make him\r\nstay, mammy!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t, Phronsie," said Mrs. Pepper, smiling, "if he thinks he ought\r\nto go."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come again," said Jasper, eagerly, "if I may, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nHe looked up at Mrs. Pepper as he stood cap in hand, waiting for the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we should be glad if your father\'ll be willing," she added;\r\nthinking, proudly, "My children are an honor to anybody, I\'m sure," as\r\nshe glanced around on the bright little group she could call her own.\r\n"But be sure, Jasper," and she laid her hand on his arm as she looked\r\ndown into his eyes, "that you father is willing, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, ma\'am," said the boy; "but he will be, I guess, if he feels\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"Then come on Thursday," said Polly; "and can\'t we bake something then,\r\nmammy?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t care," laughed Mrs. Pepper; "but you won\'t find much\r\nbut brown flour and meal to bake with."\r\n\r\n"Well, we can pretend," said Polly; "and we can cut the cakes with the\r\nheart-shape, and they\'ll do for anything.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll come," laughed Jasper, ready for such lovely fun in the old\r\nkitchen; "look out for me on Thursday, Ben!"\r\n\r\nSo Jasper and Prince took their leave, all the children accompanying\r\nthem to the gate; and then after seeing him fairly started on a smart\r\nrun to catch the stage, Prince scampering at his heels, they all began\r\nto sing his praises and to wish for Thursday to come.\r\n\r\nBut Jasper didn\'t come! Thursday came and went; a beautiful, bright,\r\nsunny day, but with no signs of the merry boy whom all had begun to\r\nlove, nor of the big black dog. The children had made all the needful\r\npreparations with much ostentation and bustle, and were in a state of\r\nexcited happiness, ready for any gale. But the last hope had to be given\r\nup, as the old clock ticked away hour after hour. And at last Polly\r\nhad to put Phronsie to bed, who wouldn\'t stop crying enough to eat her\r\nsupper at the dreadful disappointment.\r\n\r\n"He couldn\'t come, I know," said both Ben and Polly, standing staunchly\r\nup for their new friend; but Joel and David felt that he had broken his\r\nword.\r\n\r\n"He promised," said Joel, vindictively.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe his father\'d let him," said Polly, wiping away a sly\r\ntear; "I know Jasper\'d come, if he could."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pepper wisely kept her own counsel, simply giving them a kindly\r\ncaution:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you go to judging him, children, till you know."\r\n\r\n"Well, he promised," said Joel, as a settler.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you ashamed, Joel," said his mother, "to talk about any one\r\nwhose back is turned? Wait till he tells you the reason himself."\r\n\r\nJoel hung his head, and then began to tease David in the corner, to make\r\nup for his disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Ben had to go to the store after some more meal. As he\r\nwas going out rather dismally, the storekeeper, who was also postmaster,\r\ncalled out, "Oh, halloa, there!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked Ben, turning back, thinking perhaps Mr. Atkins\r\nhadn\'t given him the right change.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Mr. Atkins, stepping up to the Post-office department,\r\nquite smart with its array of boxes and official notices, where Ben had\r\nalways lingered, wishing there might be sometime a letter for him--or\r\nsome of them. "You\'ve got a sister Polly, haven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ben, wondering what was coming next.\r\n\r\n"Well, she\'s got a letter," said the postmaster, holding up a nice big\r\nenvelope, looking just like those that Ben had so many times wished\r\nfor. That magic piece of white paper danced before the boy\'s eyes for a\r\nminute; then he said, "It can\'t be for her, Mr. Atkins; why, she\'s never\r\nhad one."\r\n\r\n"Well, she\'s got one now, sure enough," said Mr. Atkins; "here \'tis,\r\nplain enough," and he read what he had no need to study much as it had\r\nalready passed examination by his own and his wife\'s faithful eyes:\r\n"Miss Polly Pepper, near the Turnpike, Badgertown\'--that\'s her, isn\'t\r\nit?" he added, laying it down before Ben\'s eyes. "Must be a first time\r\nfor everything, you know, my boy!" and he laughed long over his own\r\njoke; "so take it and run along home." For Ben still stood looking at\r\nit, and not offering to stir.\r\n\r\n"If you say so," said the boy, as if Mr. Atkins had given him something\r\nout of his own pocket; "but I\'m afraid \'tisn\'t for Polly." Then\r\nbuttoning up the precious letter in his jacket, he spun along home as\r\nnever before.\r\n\r\n"Polly! Polly!" he screamed. "Where is she, mother?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Mrs. Pepper, coming out of the bedroom. "Dear me!\r\nis anybody hurt, Ben?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Ben, in a state to believe anything, "but Polly\'s\r\ngot a letter."\r\n\r\n"Polly got a letter!" cried Mrs. Pepper; "what do you mean, Ben?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," repeated the boy, still holding out the precious letter;\r\n"but Mr. Atkins gave it to me; where is Polly?"\r\n\r\n"I know where she is," said Joel; "she\'s up-stairs." And he flew out in\r\na twinkling, and just as soon reappeared with Polly scampering after him\r\nin the wildest excitement.\r\n\r\nAnd then the kitchen was in an uproar as the precious missive was put\r\ninto Polly\'s hand; and they all gathered around her, wondering and\r\nexamining, till Ben thought he would go wild with the delay.\r\n\r\n"I wonder where it did come from," said Polly, in the greatest anxiety,\r\nexamining again the address.\r\n\r\n"Where does the postmark say?" asked Mrs. Pepper, looking over her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all rubbed out," said Polly, peering at it "you can\'t see\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Do open it," said Ben, "and then you\'ll find out."\r\n\r\n"But p\'raps \'tisn\'t for me," said Polly, timidly.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Atkins says \'tis," said Ben, impatiently; "here, I\'ll open it\r\nfor you, Polly."\r\n\r\n"No, let her open it for herself, Ben," protested his mother.\r\n\r\n"But she won\'t," said Ben; "do tear it open, Polly."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m goin\' to get a knife," she said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get one," cried Joel, running up to the table drawer; "here\'s one,\r\nPolly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," groaned Ben; "you never\'ll get it open at this rate!"\r\n\r\nBut at last it was cut; and they all holding their breath, gazed\r\nawe-struck, while Polly drew out the mysterious missive.\r\n\r\n"What does it say?" gasped Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\n"Dear Miss Polly," began both Ben and Polly in a breath. "Let Polly\r\nread," said Joel, who couldn\'t hear in the confusion.\r\n\r\n"Well, go on Polly," said Ben; "hurry!"\r\n\r\n"Dear Miss Polly, I was so sorry I couldn\'t come on Thursday--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s Jasper! it\'s Jasper!" cried all the children in a breath.\r\n\r\n"I told you so!" cried Ben and Polly, perfectly delighted to find their\r\nfriend vindicated fully--"there! Joey Pepper!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t care," cried Joe, nothing daunted, "he didn\'t come,\r\nanyway--do go on, Polly."\r\n\r\n"I was so sorry I couldn\'t come--" began Polly.\r\n\r\n"You read that," said Joel.\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Polly, "but it\'s just lovely; \'on Thursday; but my\r\nfather was sick, and I couldn\'t leave him. If you don\'t mind I\'ll come\r\nagain--I mean I\'ll come some other day, if it\'s just as convenient for\r\nyou, for I do so want the baking, and the nice time. I forgot to say\r\nthat I had a cold, to,\' (here Jasper had evidently had a struggle in his\r\nmind whether there should be two o\'s or one, and he had at last decided\r\nit, by crossing out one) but my father is willing I should come when I\r\nget well. Give my love to all, and especially remember me respectfully\r\nto your mother. Your friend,\r\n\r\n"JASPER ELYOT KING."\r\n\r\n"Oh, lovely! lovely!" cried Polly, flying around with the letter in her\r\nhand; "so he is coming!"\r\n\r\nBen was just as wild as she was, for no one knew but Polly just how the\r\nnew friend had stepped into his heart. Phronsie went to sleep happy,\r\nhugging "Baby."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you think, Baby, dear," she whispered sleepily, and Polly\r\nheard her say as she was tucking her in, "that Jasper is really comin\';\r\nreally--and the big, be-you-ti-ful doggie, too!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHRONSIE PAYS A DEBT OF GRATITUDE\r\n\r\n\r\n"And now I tell you," said Polly, the next day, "let\'s make Jasper\r\nsomething; can\'t we, ma?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, do! do!" cried all the other children, "let\'s; but what\'ll it be,\r\nPolly?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about this," interrupted Mrs. Pepper; "I don\'t see how you\r\ncould get anything to him if you could make it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we could, mamsie," said Polly, eagerly, running up to her; "for Ben\r\nknows; and he says we can do it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, if Ben and you have had your heads together, I suppose it\'s\r\nall right," laughed Mrs. Pepper, "but I don\'t see how you can do it."\r\n\r\n"Well, we can, mother, truly," put in Ben. "I\'ll tell you how, and\r\nyou\'ll say it\'ll be splendid. You see Deacon Blodgett\'s goin\' over to\r\nHingham, to-morrow; I heard him tell Miss Blodgett so; and he goes right\r\npast the hotel; and we can do it up real nice--and it\'ll please Jasper\r\nso--do, mammy!"\r\n\r\n"And it\'s real dull there, Jasper says," put in Polly, persuasively;\r\n"and just think, mammy, no brothers and sisters!" And Polly looked\r\naround on the others.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was no need to say anything more; her mother would have\r\nconsented to almost any plan then.\r\n\r\n"Well, go on, children," she said; "you may do it; I don\'t see but what\r\nyou can get \'em there well enough; but I\'m sure I don\'t know what you\r\ncan make."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t we," said Polly--and she knelt down by her mother\'s side and put\r\nher face in between the sewing in Mrs. Pepper\'s lap, and the eyes bent\r\nkindly down on her--"make some little cakes, real cakes I mean? now\r\ndon\'t say no, mammy!" she said, alarmed, for she saw a "no" slowly\r\ncoming in the eyes above her, as Mrs. Pepper began to shake her head.\r\n\r\n"But we haven\'t any white flour, Polly," began her mother. "I know,"\r\nsaid Polly; "but we\'ll make \'em of brown, it\'ll do, if you\'ll give us\r\nsome raisins--you know there\'s some in the bowl, mammy."\r\n\r\n"I was saving them for a nest egg," said Mrs. Pepper; meaning at some\r\nfuture time to indulge in another plum-pudding that the children so\r\nloved.\r\n\r\n"Well, do give \'em to us," cried Polly; "do, ma!"\r\n\r\n"I want \'em for a plum-pudding sometime," said Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\n"Ow!--" and Joel with a howl sprung up from the floor where he had been\r\ntrying to make a cart for "Baby" out of an old box, and joined Mrs.\r\nPepper and Polly. "No, don\'t give \'em away, ma!" he screamed; "let\'s\r\nhave our plum-pudding--now, Polly Pepper, you\'re a-goin\' to bake up all\r\nour raisins in nasty little cakes--and--"\r\n\r\n"Joey!" commanded Mrs. Pepper, "hush! what word did you say!"\r\n\r\n"Well," blubbered Joel, wiping his tears away with his grimy little\r\nhand, "Polly\'s--a-goin\'--to give--"\r\n\r\n"I should rather you\'d never have a plum-pudding than to say such\r\nwords," said Mrs. Pepper, sternly, taking up her work again. "And\r\nbesides, do you think what Jasper has done for you?" and her face grew\r\nvery white around the lips.\r\n\r\n"Well, he can have plum-puddings," said Joel, whimpering, "forever an\'\r\never, if he wants them--and--and--"\r\n\r\n"Well, Joey," said Polly, "there, don\'t feel bad," and she put her arms\r\naround him, and tried to wipe away the tears that still rolled down his\r\ncheeks. "We won\'t give \'em if you don\'t want us to; but Jasper\'s sick,\r\nand there isn\'t anything for him to do, and--" here she whispered slyly\r\nup into his ear, "don\'t you remember how you liked folks to send you\r\nthings when you had the measles?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," said Joel, beginning to smile through his tears; "wasn\'t\r\nit fun, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"I guess \'twas," laughed Polly back again, pleased at the return of\r\nsunshine. "Well, Jasper\'ll be just as pleased as you were, \'cause we\r\nlove him and want to do somethin\' for him, he was so good to Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"I will, Polly, I will," cried Joel, completely won over; "do let\'s make\r\n\'em for him; and put \'em in thick; oh! thick as you can;" and determined\r\nto do nothing by halves, Joel ran generously for the precious howl of\r\nraisins, and after setting it on the table, began to help Polly in all\r\nneedful preparations.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pepper smiled away to herself to see happiness restored to the\r\nlittle group. And soon a pleasant hum and bustle went on around the\r\nbaking table, the centre of attraction.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Phronsie, coming up to the table and standing on tip-toe to\r\nsee Polly measure out the flour, "I\'m a-goin\' to bake something for my\r\nsick man, I am."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Phronsie, you can\'t," began Polly.\r\n\r\n"Hey?" asked Joel, with a daub of flour on the tip of his chubby nose,\r\ngained by too much peering into Polly\'s flour-bag. "What did she say,\r\nPolly?" watching her shake the clouds of flour in the sieve.\r\n\r\n"She said she was goin\' to bake something for Jasper," said Polly.\r\n"There," as she whisked in the flour, "now that\'s done."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t say Jasper," said Phronsie; "I didn\'t say Jasper," she\r\nrepeated, emphatically.\r\n\r\n"Why, what did you say, Pet?" asked Polly, astonished, while little\r\nDavie repeated, "What did you say, Phronsie?"\r\n\r\n"I said my sick man," said Phronsie, shaking her yellow head; "poor sick\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"Who does she mean?" said Polly in despair, stopping a moment her\r\nviolent stirring that threatened to overturn the whole cake-bowl.\r\n\r\n"I guess she means Prince," said Joel. "Can\'t I stir, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Polly; "only one person must stir cake."\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Joel; "why, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," said Polly, "cause \'tis so; never mind now, Joel. Do\r\nyou mean Prince, Phronsie?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t mean Princey," said the child decisively; "I mean my sick\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"It\'s Jasper\'s father, I guess she means," said Mrs. Pepper over in the\r\ncorner; "but what in the world!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," cried Phronsie, perfectly delighted at being at last\r\nunderstood, and hopping on one toe; "my sick man."\r\n\r\n"I shall give up!" said Polly, tumbling over in a chair, with the cake\r\nspoon in her hand, from which a small sticky lump fell on her apron,\r\nwhich Joel immediately pounced upon and devoured. "What do you want to\r\nbake, Phronsie?" she gasped, holding the spoon sticking up straight, and\r\nstaring at the child.\r\n\r\n"A gingerbread boy," said the child, promptly; "he\'d like that best;\r\npoor, sick man!" and she commenced to climb up to active preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO JASPER\r\n\r\n\r\n"Mamsie, what shall we do?" implored Polly of her mother.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said her mother; "however did that get into her head, do\r\nyou suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I can\'t tell," said Polly, jumping up and beginning to stir\r\nbriskly to make up for lost time. "P\'r\'aps she heard us talking about\r\nJasper\'s having to take care of his sick father, and how hard it must be\r\nto be sick away from home."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Phronsie, "but he\'ll be glad to see my gingerbread boy, I\r\nguess; poor, sick man."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Phronsie," cried Polly, in great distress, "you aren\'t ever going\r\nto make a \'gingerbread boy\' to-day! see, we\'ll put in a cunning little\r\ncake for Mr. King--full of raisins, Phronsie; won\'t that be lovely!"\r\nand Polly began to fill a little scalloped tin with some of the cake\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\n"N-no," said the child, eying it suspiciously; "that isn\'t like a\r\n\'gingerbread boy,\' Polly; he\'ll like that best."\r\n\r\n"Mamsie," said Polly, "we can\'t let her make a dreadful, horrid\r\n\'gingerbread boy\' to send Mr. King! he never\'ll let Jasper come here\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Oh, let her," cried Joel; "she can bake it, and Dave an\' I\'ll eat it,"\r\nand he picked up a raisin that had fallen under the table and began\r\ncrunching it with great gusto.\r\n\r\n"That wouldn\'t be fair," said Polly, gloomily. "Do get her off from it,\r\nmammy."\r\n\r\n"Phronsie," said Mrs. Pepper, going up back of the child, who sat\r\npatiently in her high chair waiting for Polly to let her begin, "hadn\'t\r\nyou rather wait and give your \'gingerbread boy\' to Jasper for his\r\nfather, when he comes?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no," cried Phronsie, twisting in her chair in great\r\napprehension, "I want to send it now, I do."\r\n\r\n"Well, Polly," said her mother, laughing, "after all it\'s best, I think,\r\nto let her; it can\'t do any harm anyway--and instead of Mr. King\'s\r\nnot letting Jasper come, if he\'s a sensible man that won\'t make any\r\ndifference; and if he isn\'t, why, then there\'d be sure to something come\r\nup sometime to make trouble."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Polly, "I suppose she\'s got to; and perhaps," as a\r\nconsoling idea struck her, "perhaps she\'ll want to eat it up herself\r\nwhen it\'s done. Here, Phronsie," giving her a handful of the cake\r\nmixture, which she stiffened with flour to the right thickness, "there,\r\nyou can call that a \'gingerbread boy;\' see, won\'t it make a beautiful\r\none!"\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t think," said Mrs. Pepper, seeing Phronsie\'s delighted face,\r\nand laughing as she went back to her work, "but what that gingerbread\r\nboy\'ll go?"\r\n\r\nWhen the little cakes were done, eight of them, and set upon the table\r\nfor exhibition, they one and all protested that they never saw so fine a\r\nlot. Polly was delighted with the praise they received, and her mother\'s\r\ncommendation that she was "growing a better cook every day." "How glad\r\nJasper\'ll be, won\'t he, mamsie?" said she.\r\n\r\nThe children walked around and around the table, admiring and pointing\r\nout the chief points of attraction, as they appeared before their\r\ndiscriminating eyes.\r\n\r\n"I should choose that one," said Joel, pointing at one which was\r\nparticularly plummy, with a raisin standing up on one end with a festive\r\nair, as if to say, "there\'s lots of us inside, you better believe!"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t," said Davie, "I\'d have that--that\'s cracked so pretty."\r\n\r\n"So \'tis," said Mrs. Pepper; "they\'re all as light as a feather, Polly."\r\n\r\n"But my \'gingerbread boy," cried Phronsie, running eagerly along with a\r\nparticularly ugly looking specimen of a cake figure in her hand, "is the\r\nbe-yew-tifullest, isn\'t it, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," groaned Polly, "it looks just awfully, don\'t it, Ben!"\r\n\r\n"Hoh, hoh!" laughed Joel in derision; "his leg is crooked, see\r\nPhronsie--you better let Davie an\' me have it."\r\n\r\n"No, no," screamed the child in terror; "that\'s my sick man\'s\r\n\'gingerbread boy,\' it is!"\r\n\r\n"Joe, put it down," said Ben. "Yes, Phronsie, you shall have it; there,\r\nit\'s all safe;" and he put it carefully into Phronsie\'s apron, when she\r\nbreathed easier.\r\n\r\n"And he hasn\'t but one eye," still laughed Joel, while little Davie\r\ngiggled too.\r\n\r\n"He did have two," said Polly, "but she punched the other in with her\r\nthumb; don\'t, boys," she said, aside, "you\'ll make her feel bad; do stop\r\nlaughing. Now, how\'ll we send the things?"\r\n\r\n"Put \'em in a basket," said Ben; "that\'s nicest."\r\n\r\n"But we haven\'t got any basket," said Polly, "except the potato basket,\r\nand they\'d be lost in that."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t we take your work-basket, mamsie?" asked Ben; "they\'d look so\r\nnice in that."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Mrs. Pepper, "that wouldn\'t do; I couldn\'t spare it, and\r\nbesides, it\'s all broken at the side, Ben; that don\'t look nice."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Polly, sitting down on one of the hard wooden chairs\r\nto think, "I do wish we had things nice to send to sick people." And her\r\nforehead puckered up in a little hard knot.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have to do \'em up in a paper, Polly," said Ben; "there isn\'t\r\nany other way; they\'ll look nice in anything, \'cause they are nice," he\r\nadded, comfortingly.\r\n\r\n"If we only had some flowers," said Polly, "that would set \'em off."\r\n\r\n"You\'re always a-thinkin\' of flowers, Polly," said Ben. "I guess the\r\ncakes\'ll have to go without \'em."\r\n\r\n"I suppose they will," said Polly, stifling a little sigh. "Where\'s the\r\npaper?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a nice piece up-stairs," said Ben, "just right; I\'ll get it."\r\n\r\n"Put my \'gingerbread boy\' on top," cried Phronsie, handing him up.\r\n\r\nSo Polly packed the little cakes neatly in two rows, and laid the\r\n\'gingerbread boy\' in a fascinating attitude across the top.\r\n\r\n"He looks as if he\'d been struck by lightning!" said Ben, viewing him\r\ncritically as he came in the door with the paper.\r\n\r\n"Be still," said Polly, trying not to laugh; "that\'s because he baked so\r\nfunny; it made his feet stick out."\r\n\r\n"Children," said Mrs. Pepper, "how\'ll Jasper know where the cakes come\r\nfrom?"\r\n\r\n"Why, he\'ll know it\'s us," said Polly, "of course; \'cause it\'ll make him\r\nthink of the baking we\'re going to have when he gets well."\r\n\r\n"Well, but you don\'t say so," said Mrs. Pepper, smiling; "tisn\'t polite\r\nto send it this way."\r\n\r\n"Whatever\'ll we do, mammy!" said all four children in dismay, while\r\nPhronsie simply stared. "Can\'t we send \'em at all?"\r\n\r\n"Why yes," said their mother; "I hope so, I\'m sure, after you\'ve got \'em\r\nbaked; but you might answer Jasper\'s letter I should think, and tell him\r\nabout \'em, and the \'gingerbread boy\'."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear," said Polly, ready to fly, "I couldn\'t mamsie; I never wrote a\r\nletter."\r\n\r\n"Well, you never had one before, did you?" said her mother, composedly\r\nbiting her thread. "Never say you can\'t, Polly, \'cause you don\'t know\r\nwhat you can do till you\'ve tried."\r\n\r\n"You write, Ben," said Polly, imploringly.\r\n\r\n"No," said Ben, "I think the nicest way is for all to say somethin\',\r\nthen \'twon\'t be hard for any of us."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the paper," queried Polly, "coming from, I wonder!"\r\n\r\n"Joel," said Mrs. Pepper, "run to the bureau in the bedroom, and open\r\nthe top drawer, and get a green box there."\r\n\r\nSo Joel, quite important at the errand, departed, and presently put the\r\ndesignated box into his mother\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"There, now I\'m going to give you this," and she took out a small sheet\r\nof paper slightly yellowed by age; but being gilt-edged, it looked very\r\nmagnificent to the five pairs of eyes directed to it.\r\n\r\n"Now Ben, you get the ink bottle and the pen, and then go to work."\r\n\r\nSo Ben reached down from the upper shelf in the cupboard the ink bottle,\r\nand a pen in a black wooden penholder.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamsie," cried Polly, "that\'s where Phronsie bit it off when she\r\nwas a baby, isn\'t it?" holding up the stubby end where the little ball\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Pepper, "and now you\'re going to write about her\r\n\'gingerbread boy\' with it--well, time goes, to be sure." And she bent\r\nover her work again, harder than ever. Poor woman! if she could only\r\nscrape together enough money to get her children into school--that was\r\nthe earnest wish of her heart. She must do it soon, for Ben was twelve\r\nyears old; but with all her strivings and scrimpings she could only\r\nmanage to put bread into their mouths, and live from day to day. "I know\r\nI ought to be thankful for that," she said to herself, not taking time\r\neven to cry over her troubles. "But oh, the learning! they must have\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\n"Now," said Polly, "how\'ll we do it Ben?" as they ranged themselves\r\naround the table, on which reposed the cakes; "you begin."\r\n\r\n"How do folks begin a letter?" asked Ben in despair, of his mother.\r\n\r\n"How did Jasper begin his?" asked Mrs. Pepper back again. "Oh," cried\r\nPolly, running into the bedroom to get the precious missive. "Dear Miss\r\nPolly\'--that\'s what it says."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mrs. Pepper, "then you\'d better say, \'Dear Mister\r\nJasper\'--or you might say, \'Dear Mr. King.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" cried Polly, "that would be the father then--s\'pose he\r\nshould think we wrote to him!" and Polly looked horror-stricken to the\r\nlast degree.\r\n\r\n"There, there \'tis," said Ben: "\'Dear Mister Jasper\'--now what\'ll we\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\n"Why, say about the cakes," replied Polly.\r\n\r\n"And the \'gingerbread boy," cried Phronsie. "Oh, tell about him, Polly,\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, Phronsie," said Polly, "we will--why, tell him how we wish\r\nhe could have come, and that we baked him some cakes, and that we do so\r\nwant him to come just as soon as he can."\r\n\r\n"All right!" said Ben; so he went to work laboriously; only his\r\nhard breathing showing what a hard task it was, as the stiff old pen\r\nscratched up and down the paper.\r\n\r\n"There, that\'s done," he cried at length in great satisfaction, holding\r\nit up for inspection.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do wish," cried Polly in intense admiration, "I could write so\r\nnice and so fast as you can, Ben."\r\n\r\n"Read it, Polly," said Mrs. Pepper, in pride.\r\n\r\nSo Polly began: "Dear Mister Jasper we were all dreadfully sorry\r\nthat you didn\'t come and so we baked you some cakes.\'--You didn\'t say\r\nanything about his being sick, Ben."\r\n\r\n"I forgot it," said Ben, "but I put it in farther down--you\'ll see if\r\nyou read on."\r\n\r\n"Baked you some cakes--that is, Polly did, for this is Ben that\'s\r\nwriting."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t said that, Ben," said Polly, dissatisfied; "we all baked\r\n\'em, I\'m sure. \'And just as soon as you get well we do want you to come\r\nover and have the baking. We\'re real sorry you\'re sick--boneset\'s good\r\nfor colds."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ben!" said Mrs. Pepper, "I guess his father knows what to give\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"And oh! the bitter stuff!" cried Polly, with a wry face. "Well, it\'s\r\nhard work to write," said Ben, yawning. "I\'d rather chop wood."\r\n\r\n"I wish! knew how," exclaimed Joel, longingly.\r\n\r\n"Just you try every day; Ben\'ll teach you, Joe," said his mother,\r\neagerly, "and then I\'ll let you write."\r\n\r\n"I will!" cried Joe; "then, Dave, you\'ll see how I\'ll write--I tell\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"And I\'m goin\' to--ma, can\'t I?" said Davie, unwilling to be outdone.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you may, be sure," said Mrs. Pepper, delighted; "that\'ll make a\r\nman of you fast."\r\n\r\n"Oh, boys," said Polly, lifting a very red face, "you joggle the table\r\nso I can\'t do anything."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t jogglin\'," said Joel; "the old thing tipped. Look!" he\r\nwhispered to Davie, "see Polly, she\'s writing crooked."\r\n\r\nSo while the others hung around her and looked over her shoulder while\r\nthey made their various comments, Polly finished her part, and also held\r\nit up for inspection.\r\n\r\n"Let us see," said Ben, taking it up.\r\n\r\n"It\'s after, \'boneset\'s good for colds,\'" said Polly, puckering up her\r\nface again at the thought.\r\n\r\n"We most of us knew you were sick--I\'m Polly now--because you didn\'t\r\ncome; and we liked your letter telling us so. Oh, Polly! we weren\'t glad\r\nto hear he was sick!" cried Ben, in horror.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say so!" cried Polly, starting up. "Why, Ben Pepper, I never\r\nsaid so!" and she looked ready to cry.\r\n\r\n"It sounds something like it, don\'t it, mammy?" said Ben, unwilling to\r\ngive her pain, but appealing to Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\n"Polly didn\'t mean it," said her mother consolingly; "but if I were you,\r\nI\'d say something to explain it."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t put anything in now," said poor Polly; "there isn\'t any room\r\nnor any more paper either--what shall I do! I told you, Ben, I couldn\'t\r\nwrite." And Polly looked helplessly from one to the other for comfort.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you can," said Ben; "there, now I\'ll show you: write it fine,\r\nPolly--you write so big--little bits of letters, like these."\r\n\r\nSo Polly took the pen again with a sigh. "Now he won\'t think so, I\r\nguess," she said, much relieved, as Ben began to read again.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll begin yours again," Ben said: "We most of us knew you were sick\r\nbecause you didn\'t come, and we liked your letter telling us so because\r\nwe\'d all felt so badly, and Phronsie cried herself to sleep--" (that\'s\r\ngood, I\'m sure.) "The \'gingerbread boy\' is for your father--please\r\nexcuse it, but Phronsie would make it for him because he is sick. There\r\nisn\'t any more to write, and besides I can\'t write good, and Ben\'s\r\ntired. From all of us."\r\n\r\n"Why, how\'s he to know?" cried Ben. "That won\'t do to sign it."\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s say from Ben and Polly then," said Polly; "only all the\r\nothers want to be in the letter."\r\n\r\n"Well, they can\'t write," said Ben.\r\n\r\n"We might sign their names for \'em," suggested Polly.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s mine," said Ben, putting under the "From all of us" a big, bold\r\n"Ben."\r\n\r\n"And here\'s mine," echoed Polly, setting a slightly crooked "Polly" by\r\nits side.\r\n\r\n"Now Joe, you better let Ben hold your hand," said Polly, warningly. But\r\nJoel declaring he could write had already begun, so there was no hope\r\nfor it; and a big drop of ink falling from the pen, he spattered the "J"\r\nso that no one could tell what it was. The children looked at each other\r\nin despair.\r\n\r\n"Can we ever get it out, mammy?" said Polly, running to Mrs. Pepper with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said her mother. "How could you try it, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to," said Joel, looking very downcast and ashamed. "The\r\nugly old pen did it!"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Polly, "it\'s got to go; we can\'t help it." But she looked\r\nso sorrowful over it that half the pleasure was gone for Ben; for Polly\r\nwanted everything just right, and was very particular about things.\r\n\r\n"Now, Dave." Ben held his hand, and "David" went down next to Joel.\r\n\r\nBut when it was Phronsie\'s turn, she protested that Polly, and no one\r\nelse, must hold her hand.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a dreadful hard name to write--Phronsie is," said Polly, as she\r\nguided Phronsie\'s fat little hand that clung faithfully to the stubby\r\nold pen. "There, it\'s over now," she cried; "and I\'m thankful! I\r\nwouldn\'t write another for anything!"\r\n\r\n"Read it all over now, Ben," cried Mrs. Pepper, "and don\'t speak,\r\nchildren, till he gets through."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t it sound elegant!" said Polly, clasping her hands, when he had\r\nfinished. "I didn\'t think we ever could do it so nice, did you, Ben?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, I didn\'t," replied Ben, in a highly ecstatic frame of mind.\r\n"Now--oh! what\'ll we do for an envelope?" he asked in dismay.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to do without that," said Mrs. Pepper, "for there isn\'t any\r\nin the house--but see here, children," she added, as she saw the sorry\r\nfaces before her--"you just fold up the letter, and put it inside the\r\nparcel; that\'ll be just as good."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear," said Polly; "but it would have been splendid the other way,\r\nmammy--just like other folks!"\r\n\r\n"You must make believe this is like other folks," said Mrs. Pepper,\r\ncheerily, "when you can\'t do any other way."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ben, "that\'s so, Polly; tie \'em up quick\'s you can, and I\'ll\r\ntake \'em over to Deacon Blodgett\'s, for he\'s goin\' to start early in the\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\nSo after another last look all around, Polly put the cakes in the paper,\r\nand tied it with four or five strong knots, to avoid all danger of its\r\nundoing.\r\n\r\n"He never\'ll untie it, Polly," said Ben; "that\'s just like a girl\'s\r\nknots!"\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tie it then?" said Polly; "I\'m sure it\'s as good as\r\na boy\'s knots, and they always muss up a parcel so." And she gave a\r\nloving, approving little pat to the top of the package, which, despite\r\nits multitude of knots, was certainly very neat indeed.\r\n\r\nBen, grasping the pen again, "here goes for the direction.\r\n\r\n"Deary, yes!" said Polly. "I forgot all about that; I thought \'twas\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"How\'d you s\'pose he\'d get it?" asked Ben, coolly beginning the "M."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," replied Polly, looking over his shoulder; "s\'pose\r\nanybody else had eaten \'em up, Ben!" And she turned pale at the very\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"There," said Ben, at last, after a good many flourishes, "now \'tis\r\ndone! you can\'t think of another thing to do to it, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Mamsie, see!" cried Polly, running with it to Mrs. Pepper, "isn\'t that\r\nfine! \'Mr. Jasper E. King, at the Hotel Hingham."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Pepper, admiringly, to the content of all the children,\r\n"I should think it was!"\r\n\r\n"Let me take it in my hand," screamed Joel, reaching eagerly up for the\r\ntempting brown parcel.\r\n\r\n"Be careful then, Joe," said Polly, with an important air. So Joel took\r\na comfortable feel, and then Davie must have the same privilege. At\r\nlast it was off, and with intense satisfaction the children watched Ben\r\ndisappear with it down the long hill to Deacon Blodgett\'s.\r\n\r\nThe next day Ben came running in from his work at the deacon\'s.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Polly, you had \'em!" he screamed, all out of breath. "You had \'em!"\r\n\r\n"Had what?" asked Polly in astonishment. "Oh, Bensie, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Your flowers," he panted. "You sent some flowers to Jasper."\r\n\r\n"Flowers to Jasper!" repeated Polly, afraid Ben had gone out of his\r\nwits.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ben; "I\'ll begin at the beginning. You see, Polly, when I\r\nwent down this morning, Betsey was to set me to work. Deacon Blodgett\r\nand Mrs. Blodgett had started early, you know; and while I was\r\na-cleanin\' up the woodshed, as she told me, all of a sudden she said,\r\nas she stood in the door looking on, \'Oh, Ben, Mis\' Blodgett took some\r\nposies along with your parcel.\' \'What?\' said I; I didn\'t know as I\'d\r\nheard straight. \'Posies, I said,\' says Betsey; \'beautiful ones they\r\nwere, too, the best in the garding. I heard her tell Mr. Blodgett it\r\nwould be a pity if that sick boy couldn\'t have some flowers, and she\r\nknew the Pepper children were crazy about \'em, so she twisted \'em in\r\nthe string around the parcel, and there they stood up and looked fine, I\r\ntell you, as they drove away.\' So, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Bensie Pepper!" cried Polly, taking hold of his jacket, and spinning\r\nhim round, "I told you so! I told you so!"\r\n\r\n"I know you did," said Ben, as she gave him a parting whirl, "an\' I wish\r\nyou\'d say so about other things, Polly, if you can get \'em so easy."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOLLY DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh Ben," cried Jasper, overtaking him by a smart run as he was turning\r\nin at the little brown gate one morning three days after, "do wait."\r\n\r\n"Halloa!" cried Ben, turning around, and setting down his load--a bag of\r\nsalt and a basket of potatoes--and viewing Jasper and Prince with great\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Yes, here I am," said Jasper. "And how I\'ve run; that fellow on the\r\nstage was awful slow in getting here--oh, you\'re so good," he said\r\nand his eyes, brimful of gladness, beamed on Ben. "The cakes were just\r\nprime, and \'twas great fun to get your letter."\r\n\r\n"Did you like it?" asked Ben, the color up all over his brown\r\nface--"Like it!" cried Jasper. "Why \'twas just splendid; and the cakes\r\nwere royal! Isn\'t Polly smart though, to bake like that!" he added\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\n"I guess she is," said Ben, drawing himself up to his very tallest\r\ndimensions. "She knows how to do everything, Jasper King!"\r\n\r\n"I should think she did," responded the boy quickly. "I wish she was my\r\nsister," he finished longingly.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t," quickly replied Ben, "for then she wouldn\'t be mine;\r\nand I couldn\'t think of being without Polly! Was your father angry\r\nabout--about--\'the gingerbread boy\'?" he asked timidly, trembling for an\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear," cried Jasper, tumbling over on the grass, "don\'t, don\'t! I\r\nshan\'t be good for anything if you make me laugh! oh! wasn\'t it funny;"\r\nand he rolled over and over, shaking with glee.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ben, immensely relieved to find that no offence had been\r\ntaken. "But she would send it; Polly tried not to have her, and she\r\nmost cried when Phronsie was so determined, cause she said your father\r\nnever\'d let you come again--"\r\n\r\n"Twas just lovely in Phronsie," said the boy, sitting up and wiping his\r\neyes, "but oh it was so funny! you ought to have seen my father, Ben\r\nPepper."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then he was angry," cried Ben.\r\n\r\n"No indeed he wasn\'t!" said Jasper; "don\'t you think it! do you know it\r\ndid him lots of good, for he\'d been feeling real badly that morning, he\r\nhadn\'t eaten any breakfast, and when he saw that gingerbread boy--"\r\nhere Jasper rolled over again with a peal of laughter--"and heard the\r\nmessage, he just put back his head, and he laughed--why, I never heard\r\nhim laugh as he did then! the room shook all over; and he ate a big\r\ndinner, and all that afternoon he felt as good as could be. But he says\r\nhe\'s coming to see the little girl that baked it for him before we go\r\nhome."\r\n\r\nBen nearly tumbled over by the side of Jasper at these words--"Coming to\r\nsee us!" he gasped.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jasper, who had scarcely got over his own astonishment about\r\nit, for if the roof had suddenly whisked off on to the church steeple,\r\nhe couldn\'t have been more amazed than when he heard his father say\r\ncheerily: "Well, Jasper my boy, I guess I shall have to drive over and\r\nsee your little girl, since she\'s been polite enough to bake me this,"\r\npointing to the wild-looking "gingerbread boy."\r\n\r\n"Come in and tell \'em about it," cried Ben, radiantly, picking up his\r\npotatoes and salt. "It\'s all right, Polly!" he said in a jubilant voice,\r\n"for here\'s Jasper, and he\'ll tell you so himself."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Jasper warningly, "don\'t let Phronsie hear; well, here\'s\r\nmy pet now," and after bobbing lovingly to the others, with eyes beaming\r\nover with fun, he caught up the little girl who was screaming--"Oh,\r\nhere\'s Jasper! and my beyew-ti-ful doggie!"\r\n\r\n"Now Phronsie," he cried, "give me a kiss; you haven\'t any soft soap\r\nto-day, have you? no; that\'s a good, nice one, now; your \'gingerbread\r\nboy\' was just splendid!"\r\n\r\n"Did he eat it?" asked the child in grave delight.\r\n\r\n"Well--no--he hasn\'t eaten it yet," said Jasper, smiling on the others;\r\n"he\'s keeping it to look at, Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"I should think so!" groaned Polly.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Polly," Ben whispered; "Jasper\'s been a-tellin\' me about\r\nit; his father liked it--he did truly."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Polly, "I\'m so glad!"\r\n\r\n"He had eyes," said Phronsie, going back to the charms of the\r\n"gingerbread boy."\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Jasper admiringly; "so he did."\r\n\r\n"Rather deep sunk, one of \'em was," muttered Ben.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll bake you one, Jasper," said the child as he put her down; "I\r\nwill very truly--some day."\r\n\r\n"Will you," smiled Jasper; "well then," and there was a whispered\r\nconference with Phronsie that somehow sent that damsel into a blissful\r\nstate of delight. And then while Phronsie monopolized Prince, Jasper\r\ntold them all about the reception of the parcel--how very dull and\r\nforlorn he was feeling that morning, Prince and he shut up in-doors--and\r\nhow his father had had a miserable night, and had eaten scarcely no\r\nbreakfast, and just at this juncture there came a knock at the door,\r\n"and" said Jasper, "your parcel walked in, all dressed up in flowers!"\r\n\r\n"They weren\'t our flowers," said Polly, honestly. "Mrs. Blodgett put \'em\r\non."\r\n\r\n"Well she couldn\'t have, if you hadn\'t sent the parcel," said Jasper in\r\na tone of conviction.\r\n\r\nThen he launched out into a description of how they opened the\r\npackage--Prince looking on, and begging for one of the cakes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, didn\'t you give him one?" cried Polly at this. "Good old Prince!"\r\n\r\n"Yes I did," said Jasper, "the biggest one of all."\r\n\r\n"The one I guess," interrupted Joel, "with the big raisin on top."\r\n\r\nPolly spoke up quickly to save any more remarks on Joel\'s part. "Now\r\ntell us about your father--and the \'gingerbread boy.\'"\r\n\r\nSo Jasper broke out with a merry laugh, into this part of the story,\r\nand soon had them all in such a gale of merriment, that Phronsie stopped\r\nplaying out on the door-step with Prince, and came in to see what the\r\nmatter was.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Polly, trying to get her breath, just as Jasper was\r\nrelating how Mr. King set up the "gingerbread boy" on his writing table\r\nbefore him, while he leaned back in his chair for a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n"And to make it funnier still," said Jasper "don\'t you think, a little\r\npen-wiper he has, made like a cap, hanging on the pen-rack above him,\r\ntumbled off just at this very identical minute right on the head of the\r\n\'gingerbread boy,\' and there it stuck!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" they all screamed, "if we could only have seen it."\r\n\r\n"What was it?" asked Phronsie, pulling Polly\'s sleeve to make her hear.\r\n\r\nSo Jasper took her in his lap, and told how funny the "gingerbread boy"\r\nlooked with a cap on, and Phronsie clapped her hands, and laughed with\r\nthe rest, till the little old kitchen rang and rang again.\r\n\r\nAnd then they had the baking! and Polly tied one of her mother\'s ample\r\naprons on Jasper, as Mrs. Pepper had left directions if he should come\r\nwhile she was away; and he developed such a taste for cookery, and had\r\nso many splendid improvements on the Peppers\' simple ideas, that the\r\nchildren thought it the most fortunate thing in the world that he came;\r\nand one and all voted him a most charming companion.\r\n\r\n"You could cook a Thanksgiving dinner in this stove, just as easy as\r\nnot," said Jasper, putting into the oven something on a little cracked\r\nplate that would have been a pie if there were any centre; but lacking\r\nthat necessary accompaniment, probably was a short-cake. "Just as easy\r\nas not," he repeated with emphasis, slamming the door, to give point to\r\nhis remarks.\r\n\r\n"No, you couldn\'t either," said Ben at the table with equal decision;\r\n"not a bit of it, Jasper King!"\r\n\r\n"Why, Ben Pepper?" asked Jasper, "that oven\'s big enough! I should like\r\nto know why not?"\r\n\r\n"\'Cause there isn\'t anything to cook," said Ben coolly, cutting out a\r\npiece of dough for a jumble; "we don\'t keep Thanksgiving."\r\n\r\n"Not keep Thanksgiving!" said Jasper, standing quite still; "never had a\r\nThanksgiving! well, I declare," and then he stopped again.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Ben; "we had one once; \'twas last year--but that wasn\'t\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\n"Well then," said Jasper, leaning over the table, "I\'ll tell you what I\r\nshould think you\'d do--try Christmas."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s always worse," said Polly, setting down her rolling-pin to\r\nthink--which immediately rolled away by itself off from the table.\r\n\r\n"We never had a Christmas," said little Davie reflectively; "what are\r\nthey like, Jasper?"\r\n\r\nJasper sat quite still, and didn\'t reply to this question for a moment\r\nor two.\r\n\r\nTo be among children who didn\'t like Thanksgiving, and who "never\r\nhad seen a Christmas," and "didn\'t know what it was like," was a new\r\nrevelation to him.\r\n\r\n"They hang up stockings," said Polly softly.\r\n\r\nHow many, many times she had begged her mother to try it for the younger\r\nones; but there was never anything to put in them, and the winters were\r\ncold and hard, and the strictest economy only carried them through.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said little Phronsie in horror, "are their feet in \'em, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"No dear," said Polly; while Jasper instead of laughing, only stared.\r\nSomething requiring a deal of thought was passing through the boy\'s mind\r\njust then. "They shall have a Christmas!" he muttered, "I know father\'ll\r\nlet me." But he kept his thoughts to himself; and becoming his own gay,\r\nkindly self, he explained and told to Phronsie and the others, so many\r\nstories of past Christmases he had enjoyed, that the interest over the\r\nbaking soon dwindled away, until a horrible smell of something burning\r\nbrought them all to their senses.\r\n\r\n"Oh! the house is burning!" cried Polly. "Oh get a pail of water!"\r\n\r\n"Tisn\'t either," said Jasper, snuffing wisely; "oh! I know--I forgot all\r\nabout it--I do beg your pardon." And running to the stove, he knelt\r\ndown and drew out of the oven, a black, odorous mass, which with a\r\ncrest-fallen air he brought to Polly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m no end sorry I made such a mess of it," he said, "I meant it for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Tisn\'t any matter," said Polly kindly.\r\n\r\n"And now do you go on," cried Joel and David both in the same breath,\r\n"all about the Tree, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said the others; "if you\'re not tired, Jasper."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," cried their accommodating friend, "I love to tell about it;\r\nonly wait--let\'s help Polly clear up first."\r\n\r\nSo after all traces of the frolic had been tidied up, and made nice for\r\nthe mother\'s return, they took seats in a circle and Jasper regaled\r\nthem with story and reminiscence, till they felt as if fairy land were\r\nnothing to it!\r\n\r\n"How did you ever live through it, Jasper King," said Polly, drawing the\r\nfirst long breath she had dared to indulge in. "Such an elegant time!"\r\n\r\nJasper laughed. "I hope I\'ll live through plenty more of them," he said\r\nmerrily. "We\'re going to sister Marian\'s again, father and I; we always\r\nspend our Christmas there, you know, and she\'s to have all the cousins,\r\nand I don\'t know how many more; and a tree--but the best of all, there\'s\r\ngoing to be a German carol sung by choir boys--I shall like that best of\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"What are choir boys?" asked Polly who was intensely fond of music.\r\n\r\n"In some of the churches," explained Jasper, "the choir is all boys; and\r\nthey do chant, and sing anthems perfectly beautifully, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Do you play on the piano, and sing?" asked Polly, looking at him in\r\nawe.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the boy simply; "I\'ve played ever since I was a little\r\nfellow, no bigger\'n Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jasper!" cried Polly, clasping her hands, her cheeks all\r\naflame--"do you mean to say you do really and truly play on the piano?"\r\n\r\n"Why yes," said the boy, looking into her flashing eyes. "Polly\'s\r\nalways crazy about music," explained Ben; "she\'ll drum on the table, and\r\nanywhere, to make believe it\'s a piano."\r\n\r\n"There\'s Dr. Fisher going by," said Joel, who, now that they had gotten\r\non the subject of music, began to find prickles running up and down his\r\nlegs from sitting so still. "I wish he\'d stop."\r\n\r\n"Is he the one that cured your measles--and Polly\'s eyes?" asked Jasper\r\nrunning to the window. "I want to see him."\r\n\r\n"Well there he is," cried Ben, as the doctor put his head out of the gig\r\nand bowed and smiled to the little group in the window.\r\n\r\n"He\'s just lovely," cried Polly, "oh! I wish you knew him."\r\n\r\n"If father\'s sick again," said Jasper, "we\'ll have him--he looks nice,\r\nanyway--for father don\'t like the doctor over in Hingham--do you know\r\nperhaps we\'ll come again next summer; wouldn\'t that be nice!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried the children rapturously; "do come, Jasper, do!"\r\n\r\n"Well, maybe," said Jasper, "if father likes it and sister Marian and\r\nher family will come with us; they do some summers. You\'d like little\r\nDick, I know," turning to Phronsie. "And I guess all of you\'d like all\r\nof them," he added, looking at the group of interested listeners. "They\r\nwanted to come this year awfully; they said--\'Oh grandpapa, do let us go\r\nwith you and Jappy, and--"\r\n\r\n"What!" said the children.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Jasper with a laugh, "they call me Jappy--its easier to say\r\nthan Jasper; ever so many people do for short. You may if you want to,"\r\nhe said looking around on them all.\r\n\r\n"How funny!" laughed Polly, "But I don\'t know as it is any worse than\r\nPolly or Ben."\r\n\r\n"Or Phronsie," said Jappy. "Don\'t you like Jappy?" he said, bringing\r\nhis head down to her level, as she sat on the little stool at his feet,\r\ncontent in listening to the merry chat.\r\n\r\n"Is that the same as Jasper?" she asked gravely.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the very same," he said.\r\n\r\nWhen they parted--Jappy and the little Peppers were sworn friends; and\r\nthe boy, happy in his good times in the cheery little home, felt the\r\nhours long between the visits that his father, when he saw the change\r\nthat they wrought in his son, willingly allowed him to make.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear!" said Mrs. Pepper one day in the last of September--as a\r\ncarriage drawn by a pair of very handsome horses, stopped at their\r\ndoor, "here comes Mr. King I do believe; we never looked worse\'n we do\r\nto-day!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Polly, flying out of the bedroom. "Jappy\'s with\r\nhim, mamma, and it\'ll be nice I guess. At any rate, Phronsie\'s clean as\r\na pink," she thought to herself looking at the little maiden, busy with\r\n"baby" to whom she was teaching deportment in the corner. But there was\r\nno time to "fix up;" for a tall, portly gentleman, leaning on his\r\nheavy gold cane, was walking up from the little brown gate to the big\r\nflat-stone that served as a step. Jasper and Prince followed decorously.\r\n\r\n"Is this little Miss Pepper?" he asked pompously of Polly, who answered\r\nhis rap on the door. Now whether she was little "Miss Pepper" she never\r\nhad stopped to consider.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know sir; I\'m Polly." And then she blushed bright as a rose,\r\nand the laughing brown eyes looked beyond to Jasper, who stood on the\r\nwalk, and smiled encouragingly.\r\n\r\n"Is your mother in?" asked the old gentleman, who was so tall he could\r\nscarcely enter the low door. And then Mrs. Pepper came forward, and\r\nJasper introduced her, and the old gentleman bowed, and sat down in\r\nthe seat Polly placed for him. And Mrs. Pepper thanked him with a heart\r\noverflowing with gratitude, through lips that would tremble even\r\nthen, for all that Jasper had done for them. And the old gentleman\r\nsaid--"Humph!" but he looked at his son, and something shone in his eye\r\njust for a moment.\r\n\r\nPhronsie had retreated with "baby" in her arms behind the door on the\r\nnew arrival. But seeing everything progressing finely, and overcome by\r\nher extreme desire to see Jappy and Prince, she began by peeping out\r\nwith big eyes to observe how things were going on. Just then the old\r\ngentleman happened to say, "Well, where is my little girl that baked me\r\na cake so kindly?"\r\n\r\nThen Phronsie, forgetting all else but her "poor sick man," who also was\r\n"Jasper\'s father," rushed out from behind the door, and coming up to the\r\nstately old gentleman in the chair, she looked up pityingly, and said,\r\nshaking her yellow head, "Poor, sick man, was my boy good?"\r\n\r\nAfter that there was no more gravity and ceremony. In a moment, Phronsie\r\nwas perched upon old Mr. King\'s knee, and playing with his watch;\r\nwhile the others, freed from all restraint, were chatting and laughing\r\nhappily, till some of the cheeriness overflowed and warmed the heart of\r\nthe old gentleman.\r\n\r\n"We go to-morrow," he said, rising, and looking at his watch. "Why, is\r\nit possible that we have been here an hour! there, my little girl,\r\nwill you give me a kiss?" and he bent his handsome old head down to the\r\nchildish face upturned to his confidingly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go," said the child, as she put up her little lips in grave\r\nconfidence. "I do like you--I do!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Phronsie," began Mrs. Pepper.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t reprove her, madam," said the old gentleman, who liked it\r\nimmensely. "Yes, we go to-morrow," he said, looking around on the group\r\nto whom this was a blow they little expected. They had surely thought\r\nJasper was to stay a week longer.\r\n\r\n"I received a telegram this morning, that I must be in the city on\r\nThursday. And besides, madam," he said, addressing Mrs. Pepper, "I think\r\nthe climate is bad for me now, as it induces rheumatism. The hotel is\r\nalso getting unpleasant; there are many annoyances that I cannot put up\r\nwith; so that altogether, I do not regret it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pepper, not knowing exactly what to say to this, wisely said\r\nnothing. Meantime, Jappy and the little Peppers were having a sorry time\r\nover in the corner by themselves.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll write," cried Jasper, not liking to look at Polly just then,\r\nas he was sure he shouldn\'t want anyone to look at him, if he felt like\r\ncrying. "And you must answer \'em all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we will! we will!" they cried. "And Jappy, do come next summer,"\r\nsaid Joel.\r\n\r\n"If father\'ll only say yes, we will, I tell you!" he responded eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Come, my boy," said his father the third time; and Jasper knew by the\r\ntone that there must be no delay.\r\n\r\nMr. King had been nervously putting his hand in his pocket during the\r\nlast few moments that the children were together; but when he glanced\r\nat Mrs. Pepper\'s eyes, something made him draw it out again hastily,\r\nas empty as he put it in. "No, \'twouldn\'t do," he said to himself; "she\r\nisn\'t the kind of woman to whom one could offer money."\r\n\r\nThe children crowded back their tears, and hastily said their last\r\ngood-bye, some of them hanging on to Prince till the last moment.\r\n\r\nAnd then the carriage door shut with a bang, Jasper giving them a bright\r\nparting smile, and they were gone.\r\n\r\nAnd the Peppers went into their little brown house, and shut the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING A CHRISTMAS FOR THE LITTLE ONES\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so October came and went. The little Peppers were very lonely after\r\nJasper had gone; even Mrs. Pepper caught herself looking up one day when\r\nthe wind blew the door open suddenly, half expecting to see the merry\r\nwhole-souled boy, and the faithful dog come scampering in.\r\n\r\nBut the letters came--and that was a comfort; and it was fun to answer\r\nthem. The first one spoke of Jasper\'s being under a private tutor, with\r\nhis cousins; then they were less frequent, and they knew he was studying\r\nhard. Full of anticipations of Christmas himself, he urged the little\r\nPeppers to try for one. And the life and spirit of the letter was so\r\ncatching, that Polly and Ben found their souls fired within them to try\r\nat least to get for the little ones a taste of Christmastide.\r\n\r\n"Now, mammy," they said at last, one day in the latter part of October,\r\nwhen the crisp, fresh air filled their little healthy bodies with\r\nspringing vitality that must bubble over and rush into something,\r\n"we don\'t want a Thanksgiving--truly we don\'t. But may we try for a\r\nChristmas--just a little one," they added, timidly, "for the children?"\r\nBen and Polly always called the three younger ones of the flock "the\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\nTo their utter surprise, Mrs. Pepper looked mildly assenting, and\r\npresently she said, "Well, I don\'t see why you can\'t try; \'twon\'t do any\r\nharm, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\nYou see Mrs. Pepper had received a letter from Jasper, which at present\r\nshe didn\'t feel called upon to say anything about.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Polly, drawing a long breath, as she and Ben stole away into\r\na corner to "talk over" and lay plans, "what does it mean?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Ben; "as long as she\'s given us leave I don\'t care\r\nwhat it is."\r\n\r\n"I neither," said Polly, with the delicious feeling as if the whole\r\nworld were before them where to choose; "it\'ll be just gorgeous, Ben!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" asked Ben, who was not as much given to long words as\r\nPolly, who dearly loved to be fine in language as well as other things.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s something Jappy said one day; and I asked him, and he says\r\nit\'s fine, and lovely, and all that," answered Polly, delighted that she\r\nknew something she could really tell Ben.\r\n\r\n"Then why not say fine?" commented Ben, practically, with a little\r\nupward lift of his nose.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'d know, I\'m sure," laughed Polly. "Let\'s think what\'ll we do\r\nfor Christmas--how many weeks are there, anyway, Ben?" And she began to\r\ncount on her fingers.\r\n\r\n"That\'s no way," said Ben, "I\'m going to get the Almanac." So he went to\r\nthe old clock where hanging up by its side, was a "Farmer\'s Almanac."\r\n\r\n"Now, we\'ll know," he said, coming back to their corner. So with heads\r\ntogether they consulted and counted up till they found that eight weeks\r\nand three days remained in which to get ready.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Polly. "It\'s most a year, isn\'t it, Ben?"\r\n\r\n"\'Twon\'t be much time for us," said Ben, who thought of the many hours\r\nto be devoted to hard work that would run away with the time. "We\'d\r\nbetter begin right away, Polly."\r\n\r\n"Well, all right," said Polly, who could scarcely keep her fingers\r\nstill, as she thought of the many things she should so love to do if she\r\ncould. "But first, Ben, what let\'s do?"\r\n\r\n"Would you rather hang up their stockings?" asked Ben, as if he had\r\nunlimited means at his disposal; "or have a tree?"\r\n\r\n"Why," said Polly, with wide open eyes at the two magnificent ideas, "we\r\nhaven\'t got anything to put in the stockings when we hang \'em, Ben."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said Ben. "Now, wouldn\'t it be better to have a tree,\r\nPolly? I can get that easy in the woods, you know."\r\n\r\n"Well," interrupted Polly, eagerly, "we haven\'t got anything to hang on\r\nthat, either, Ben. You know Jappy said folks hang all sorts of presents\r\non the branches. So I don\'t see," she continued, impatiently, "as\r\nthat\'s any good. We can\'t do anything, Ben Pepper, so there! there isn\'t\r\nanything to do anything with," and with a flounce Polly sat down on\r\nthe old wooden stool, and folding her hands looked at Ben in a most\r\ndespairing way.\r\n\r\n"I know," said Ben, "we haven\'t got much."\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t got anything," said Polly, still looking at him. "Why, we\'ve\r\ngot a tree," replied Ben, hopefully. "Well, what\'s a tree," retorted\r\nPolly, scornfully. "Anybody can go out and look at a tree outdoors."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, I tell you, Polly," said Ben, sitting down on the floor\r\nbeside her, and speaking very slowly and decisively, "we\'ve got to do\r\nsomething \'cause we\'ve begun; and we might make a tree real pretty."\r\n\r\n"How?" asked Polly, ashamed of her ill-humor, but not in the least\r\nseeing how anything could be made of a tree. "How, Ben Pepper?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Ben, pleasantly, "we\'d set it up in the corner--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not in the corner," cried Polly, whose spirits began to rise\r\na little as she saw Ben so hopeful. "Put it in the middle of the room,\r\ndo!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care where you put it," said Ben, smiling, happy that Polly\'s\r\nusual cheerful energy had returned, "but I thought.--\'twill be a little\r\none, you know, and I thought \'twould look better in the corner."\r\n\r\n"What else?" asked Polly, eager to see how Ben would dress the tree.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Ben, "you know the Henderson boys gave me a lot of corn\r\nlast week."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see as that helps much," said Polly, still incredulous. "Do you\r\nmean hang the cobs on the branches, Ben? That would be just dreadful!"\r\n\r\n"I should think likely," laughed Ben. "No, indeed, Polly Pepper! but\r\nif we should pop a lot, oh! a bushel, and then we should string \'em, we\r\ncould wind it all in and out among the branches, and--"\r\n\r\n"Why, wouldn\'t that be pretty?" cried Polly, "real pretty--and we can do\r\nthat, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n"Yes," continued Ben; "and then, don\'t you know, there\'s some little\r\ncandle ends in that box in the Provision Room, maybe mammy\'d give us\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe but she would," cried Polly; "twould be just like\r\nJappy\'s if she would! Let\'s ask her now--this very same minute!"\r\n\r\nAnd they scampered hurriedly to Mrs. Pepper, who to their extreme\r\nastonishment, after all, said "yes," and smiled encouragingly on the\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t mammy good?" said Polly, with loving gratitude, as they seated\r\nthemselves again.\r\n\r\n"Now we\'re all right," exclaimed Ben, "and I tell you we can make the\r\ntree look perfectly splendid, Polly Pepper!"\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll tell you another thing, Ben," Polly said, "oh! something\r\nelegant! You must get ever so many hickory nuts; and you know those bits\r\nof bright paper I\'ve got in the bureau drawer? Well, we can paste them\r\non to the nuts and hang \'em on for the balls Jappy tells of."\r\n\r\n"Polly," cried Ben, "it\'ll be such a tree as never was, won\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but dear me," cried Polly, springing up, "the children are coming!\r\nWasn\'t it good, grandma wanted \'em to come over this afternoon, so\'s\r\nwe could talk! Now hush!" as the door opened to admit the noisy little\r\ntroop.\r\n\r\n"If you think of any new plan," whispered Ben, behind his hand, while\r\nMrs. Pepper engaged their attention, "you\'ll have to come out into the\r\nwood-shed to talk after this."\r\n\r\n"I know it," whispered Polly back again; "oh! we\'ve got just heaps of\r\nthings to think of, Bensie!"\r\n\r\nSuch a contriving and racking of brains as Polly and Ben set up after\r\nthis! They would bob over at each other, and smile with significant\r\ngesture as a new idea would strike one of them, in the most mysterious\r\nway that, if observed, would drive the others almost wild. And then,\r\nfrightened lest in some hilarious moment the secret should pop out,\r\nthe two conspirators would betake themselves to the wood-shed as before\r\nagreed on. But Joel, finding this out, followed them one day--or, as\r\nPolly said, tagged--so that was no good.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go behind the wood-pile," she said to Ben, in desperation; "he\r\ncan\'t hear there, if we whisper real soft."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he will," said Ben, who knew Joel\'s hearing faculties much better.\r\n"We\'ll have to wait till they\'re a-bed."\r\n\r\nSo after that, when nightfall first began to make its appearance, Polly\r\nwould hint mildly about bedtime.\r\n\r\n"You hustle us so!" said Joel, after he had been sent off to bed for two\r\nor three nights unusually early.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joey, it\'s good for you to get to bed," said Polly, coaxingly;\r\n"it\'ll make you grow, you know, real fast."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t grow a-bed," grumbled Joel, who thought something was in\r\nthe wind. "You and Ben are going to talk, I know, and wink your eyes, as\r\nsoon as we\'re gone."\r\n\r\n"Well, go along, Joe, that\'s a good boy," said Polly, laughing, "and\r\nyou\'ll know some day."\r\n\r\n"What\'ll you give me?" asked Joel, seeing a bargain, his foot on the\r\nlowest stair leading to the loft, "say, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I haven\'t got much to give," she said, cheerily; "but I\'ll tell you\r\nwhat, Joey--I\'ll tell you a story every day that you go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Will you?" cried Joe, hopping back into the room. "Begin now, Polly,\r\nbegin now!"\r\n\r\n"Why, you haven\'t been to bed yet," said Polly, "so I can\'t till\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have--you\'ve made us go for three--no, I guess fourteen nights,"\r\nsaid Joel, indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Well, you were made to go," laughed Polly. "I said if you\'d go good,\r\nyou know; so run along, Joe, and I\'ll tell you a nice one to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"It\'s got to be long," shouted Joel, when he saw he could get no more,\r\nmaking good time up to the loft.\r\n\r\nTo say that Polly, in the following days, was Master Joel\'s slave, was\r\nstating the case lightly. However, she thought by her story-telling she\r\ngot off easily, as each evening saw the boys drag their unwilling\r\nfeet to-bedward, and leave Ben and herself in peace to plan and work\r\nundisturbed. There they would sit by the little old table, around the\r\none tallow candle, while Mrs. Pepper sewed away busily, looking up to\r\nsmile or to give some bits of advice; keeping her own secret meanwhile,\r\nwhich made her blood leap fast, as the happy thoughts nestled in her\r\nheart of her little ones and their coming glee. And Polly made the\r\nloveliest of paper dolls for Phronsie out of the rest of the bits of\r\nbright paper; and Ben made windmills and whistles for the boys; and a\r\nfunny little carved basket with a handle, for Phronsie, out of a hickory\r\nnut shell; and a new pink calico dress for Seraphina peered out from\r\nthe top drawer of the old bureau in the bedroom, whenever anyone opened\r\nit--for Mrs. Pepper kindly let the children lock up their treasures\r\nthere as fast as completed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make Seraphina a bonnet," said Mrs. Pepper, "for there\'s that old\r\nbonnet-string in the bag, you know, Polly, that\'ll make it beautiful."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do, mother," cried Polly, "she\'s been wanting a new one awfully."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m going to knit some mittens for Joel and David," continued Mrs.\r\nPepper; "cause I can get the yarn cheap now. I saw some down at the\r\nstore yesterday I could have at half price."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe anybody\'ll have as good a Christmas as we shall," cried\r\nPolly, pasting on a bit of trimming to the gayest doll\'s dress; "no, not\r\neven Jappy."\r\n\r\nAn odd little smile played around Mrs. Pepper\'s mouth, but she said not\r\na word, and so the fun and the work went on.\r\n\r\nThe tree was to be set up in the Provision Room; that was finally\r\ndecided, as Mrs. Pepper showed the children how utterly useless it would\r\nbe to try having it in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll find the key, children," she said, "I think I know where \'tis, and\r\nthen we can keep them out."\r\n\r\n"Well, but it looks so," said Polly, demurring at the prospect.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Polly," said her mother; "at any rate it\'s clean."\r\n\r\n"Polly," said Ben, "we can put evergreen around, you know."\r\n\r\n"So we can," said Polly, brightly; "oh, Ben, you do think of the best\r\nthings; we couldn\'t have had them in the kitchen."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t let\'s hang the presents on the tree," continued Ben; "let\'s\r\nhave the children hang up their stockings; they want to, awfully--for I\r\nheard David tell Joel this morning before we got up--they thought I\r\nwas asleep, but I wasn\'t--that he did so wish they could, but, says he,\r\n\'Don\'t tell mammy, \'cause that\'ll make her feel bad."\r\n\r\n"The little dears!" said Mrs. Pepper, impulsively; "they shall have\r\ntheir stockings, too."\r\n\r\n"And we\'ll make the tree pretty enough," said Polly, enthusiastically;\r\n"we shan\'t want the presents to hang on; we\'ve got so many things. And\r\nthen we\'ll have hickory nuts to eat; and perhaps mammy\'ll let us make\r\nsome molasses candy the day before," she said, with a sly look at her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"You may," said Mrs. Pepper, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Oh, goody!" they both cried, hugging each other ecstatically.\r\n\r\n"And we\'ll have a frolic in the Provision Room afterwards," finished\r\nPolly; "oh! ooh!"\r\n\r\nAnd so the weeks flew by--one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,\r\neight! till only the three days remained, and to think the fun that\r\nPolly and Ben had had already!\r\n\r\n"It\'s better\'n a Christmas," they told their mother, "to get ready for\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s too bad you can\'t hang up your stockings," said Mrs. Pepper,\r\nlooking keenly at their flushed faces and bright eyes; "you\'ve never\r\nhung \'em up."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t any matter, mamsie," they both said, cheerily; "it\'s a\r\ngreat deal better to have the children have a nice time--oh, won\'t it be\r\nelegant! p\'r\'aps we\'ll have ours next year!"\r\n\r\nFor two days before, the house was turned upside down for Joel to find\r\nthe biggest stocking he could; but on Polly telling him it must be his\r\nown, he stopped his search, and bringing down his well-worn one, hung it\r\nby the corner of the chimney to be ready.\r\n\r\n"You put yours up the other side, Dave," he advised.\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t any nail," cried David, investigating.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll drive one," said Joel, so he ran out to the tool-house, as one\r\ncorner of the wood-shed was called, and brought in the hammer and one or\r\ntwo nails.\r\n\r\n"Phronsie\'s a-goin\' in the middle," he said, with a nail in his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m a-goin\' to hang up my stockin\'," cried the child, hopping from\r\none toe to the other.\r\n\r\n"Run get it, Phronsie," said Joel, "and I\'ll hang it up for you.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s two days before Christmas yet," said Polly, laughing; "how\r\nthey\'ll look hanging there so long."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Joel, giving a last thump to the nail; "we\'re\r\na-goin\' to be ready. Oh, dear! I wish \'twas to-night!"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t Seraphina hang up her stocking?" asked Phronsie, coming up to\r\nPolly\'s side; "and Baby, too?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, let her have part of yours," said Polly, "that\'ll be\r\nbest--Seraphina and Baby, and you have one stocking together."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," cried Phronsie, easily pleased; "that\'ll be best." So for\r\nthe next two days, they were almost distracted; the youngest ones asking\r\ncountless questions about Santa Claus, and how he possibly could get\r\ndown the chimney, Joel running his head up as far as he dared, to see if\r\nit was big enough.\r\n\r\n"I guess he can," he said, coming back in a sooty state, looking very\r\nmuch excited and delighted.\r\n\r\n"Will he be black like Joey?" asked Phronsie, pointing to his grimy\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly; "he don\'t ever get black."\r\n\r\n"Why?" they all asked; and then, over and over, they wanted the\r\ndelightful mystery explained.\r\n\r\n"We never\'ll get through this day," said Polly in despair, as the last\r\none arrived. "I wish \'twas to-night, for we\'re all ready."\r\n\r\n"Santy\'s coming! Santy\'s coming!" sang Phronsie, as the bright afternoon\r\nsunlight went down over the fresh, crisp snow, "for it\'s night now."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Santa is coming!" sang Polly; and "Santa Claus is coming," rang\r\nback and forth through the old kitchen, till it seemed as if the three\r\nlittle old stockings would hop down and join in the dance going on so\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad mine is red," said Phronsie, at last, stopping in the wild\r\njig, and going up to see if it was all safe, "cause then Santy\'ll know\r\nit\'s mine, won\'t he, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear," cried Polly, catching her up. "Oh, Phronsie! you are going\r\nto have a Christmas!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I wish," said Joel, "I had my name on mine! I know Dave\'ll get\r\nsome of my things."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Joe," said Mrs. Pepper, "Santa Claus is smart; he\'ll know yours\r\nis in the left-hand corner."\r\n\r\n"Will he?" asked Joel, still a little fearful.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, indeed," said Mrs. Pepper, confidently. "I never knew him to\r\nmake a mistake."\r\n\r\n"Now," said Ben, when they had all made a pretence of eating supper,\r\nfor there was such an excitement prevailing that no one sat still long\r\nenough to eat much, "you must every one fly off to bed as quick as ever\r\ncan be."\r\n\r\n"Will Santa Claus come faster then?" asked Joel.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ben, "just twice as fast."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going, then," said Joel; "but I ain\'t going to sleep, \'cause I mean\r\nto hear him come over the roof; then I\'m going to get up, for I do so\r\nwant a squint at the reindeer!"\r\n\r\n"I am, too," cried Davie, excitedly. "Oh, do come, Joe!" and he began to\r\nmount the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Good night," said Phronsie, going up to the centre of the\r\nchimney-piece, where the little red stocking dangled limpsily, "lift me\r\nup, Polly, do."\r\n\r\n"What you want to do?" asked Polly, running and giving her a jump. "What\r\nyou goin\' to do, Phronsie?"\r\n\r\n"I want to kiss it good night," said the child, with eyes big with\r\nanticipation and happiness, hugging the well worn toe of the little old\r\nstocking affectionately. "I wish I had something to give Santa, Polly, I\r\ndo!" she cried, as she held her fast in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Pet," said Polly, nearly smothering her with kisses; "if\r\nyou\'re a good girl, Phronsie, that pleases Santa the most of anything."\r\n\r\n"Does it?" cried Phronsie, delighted beyond measure, as Polly carried\r\nher into the bedroom, "then I\'ll be good always, I will!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS BELLS!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night Polly woke up with a start.\r\n\r\n"What in the world!" said she, and she bobbed up her head and looked\r\nover at her mother, who was still peacefully sleeping, and was just\r\ngoing to lie down again, when a second noise out in the kitchen made her\r\npause and lean on her elbow to listen. At this moment she thought she\r\nheard a faint whisper, and springing out of bed she ran to Phronsie\'s\r\ncrib--it was empty! As quick as a flash she sped out into the kitchen.\r\nThere, in front of the chimney, were two figures. One was Joel, and the\r\nother, unmistakably, was Phronsie!\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" gasped Polly, holding on to a chair.\r\n\r\nThe two little night-gowns turned around at this.\r\n\r\n"Why, I thought it was morning," said Joel, "and I wanted my stocking.\r\nOh!" as he felt the toe, which was generously stuffed, "give it to me,\r\nPolly Pepper, and I\'ll run right back to bed again!"\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Polly; "and you, too, Phronsie! Why, it\'s the middle of\r\nthe night! Did I ever!" and she had to pinch her mouth together tight\r\nto keep from bursting out into a loud laugh. "Oh, dear, I shall laugh!\r\ndon\'t look so scared, Phronsie, there won\'t anything hurt you." For\r\nPhronsie who, on hearing Joel fumbling around the precious stockings,\r\nhad been quite willing to hop out of bed and join him, had now, on\r\nPolly\'s saying the dire words "in the middle of the night," scuttled\r\nover to her protecting side like a frightened rabbit.\r\n\r\n"It never\'ll be morning," said Joel taking up first one cold toe and\r\nthen the other; "you might let us have \'em now, Polly."\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly sobering down; "you can\'t have yours till Davie wakes\r\nup, too. Scamper off to bed, Joey, dear, and forget all about \'em--and\r\nit\'ll be morning before you know it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'d rather go to bed," said Phronsie, trying to tuck up her feet in\r\nthe little flannel night-gown, which was rather short, "but I don\'t know\r\nthe way back, Polly. Take me, Polly, do," and she put up her arms to be\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I ain\'t a-goin\' back alone, either," whimpered Joel, coming up to\r\nPolly, too.\r\n\r\n"Why, you came down alone, didn\'t you?" whispered Polly, with a little\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I thought \'twas morning," said Joel, his teeth chattering with\r\nsomething beside the cold.\r\n\r\n"Well, you must think of the morning that\'s coming," said Polly,\r\ncheerily. "I\'ll tell you--you wait till I put Phronsie into the crib,\r\nand then I\'ll come back and go half-way up the stairs with you."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t never come down till it\'s mornin\' again," said Joel, bouncing\r\nalong the stairs, when Polly was ready to go with him, at a great rate.\r\n\r\n"Better not," laughed Polly, softly. "Be careful and not wake Davie nor\r\nBen."\r\n\r\n"I\'m in," announced Joel, in a loud whisper; and Polly could hear him\r\nsnuggle down among the warm bedclothes. "Call us when \'tis mornin\',\r\nPolly."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly, "I will; go to sleep."\r\n\r\nPhronsie had forgotten stockings and everything else on Polly\'s return,\r\nand was fast asleep in the old crib. The result of it was that the\r\nchildren slept over, when morning did really come; and Polly had to\r\nkeep her promise, and go to the foot of the stairs and call--"MERRY\r\nCHRISTMAS! oh, Ben! and Joel! and Davie!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!--oh!--oo-h!" and then the sounds that answered her, as with\r\nsmothered whoops of expectation they one and all flew into their\r\nclothes!\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash Joel and Davie were down and dancing around the\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\n"Mammy! mammy!" screamed Phronsie, hugging her stocking, which Ben\r\nlifted her up to unhook from the big nail, "Santy did come, he did!" and\r\nthen she spun around in the middle of the floor, not stopping to look in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Well, open it, Phronsie," called Davie, deep in the exploring of his\r\nown; "oh! isn\'t that a splendid wind-mill, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said that individual, who, having found a big piece of molasses\r\ncandy, was so engaged in enjoying a huge bite that, regardless alike of\r\nhis other gifts or of the smearing his face was getting, he gave himself\r\nwholly up to its delights.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joey," cried Polly, laughingly, "molasses candy for breakfast!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s prime!" cried Joel, swallowing the last morsel. "Now I\'m going\r\nto see what\'s this--oh, Dave, see here! see here!" he cried in intense\r\nexcitement, pulling out a nice little parcel which, unrolled, proved to\r\nbe a bright pair of stout mittens. "See if you\'ve got some--look quick!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have," said David, picking up a parcel about as big. "No, that\'s\r\nmolasses candy."\r\n\r\n"Just the same as I had," said Joel; "do look for the mittens. P\'r\'aps\r\nSanta Claus thought you had some--oh, dear!"\r\n\r\n"Here they are!" screamed Davie. "I have got some, Joe, just exactly\r\nlike yours! See, Joe!"\r\n\r\n"Goody!" said Joel, immensely relieved; for now he could quite enjoy his\r\nto see a pair on Davie\'s hands, also. "Look at Phron," he cried, "she\r\nhasn\'t got only half of her things out!"\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, Phronsie was so bewildered by her riches that she\r\nsat on the floor with the little red stocking in her lap, laughing and\r\ncooing to herself amid the few things she had drawn out. When she came\r\nto Seraphina\'s bonnet she was quite overcome. She turned it over and\r\nover, and smoothed out the little white feather that had once adorned\r\none of Grandma Bascom\'s chickens, until the two boys with their\r\nstockings, and the others sitting around in a group on the floor\r\nwatching them, laughed in glee to see her enjoyment.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Joel, at last, shaking his stocking; "I\'ve got all\r\nthere is. I wish there were forty Christmases coming!"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t!" screamed Davie; "there\'s some thing in the toe."\r\n\r\n"It\'s an apple, I guess," said Joel; "turn it up, Dave."\r\n\r\n"\'Tisn\'t an apple," exclaimed Davie, "tisn\'t round--it\'s long and thin;\r\nhere \'tis." And he pulled out a splendid long whistle on which he blew\r\na blast long and terrible, and Joel immediately following, all quiet was\r\nbroken up, and the wildest hilarity reigned.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know as you\'ll want any breakfast," at last said Mrs. Pepper,\r\nwhen she had got Phronsie a little sobered down.\r\n\r\n"I do, I do!" cried Joel.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! after your candy?" said Polly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all gone," said Joel, tooting around the table on his whistle.\r\n"What are we going to have for breakfast?"\r\n\r\n"Same as ever," said his mother; "it can\'t be Christmas all the time."\r\n\r\n"I wish \'twas," said little Davie; "forever and ever!"\r\n\r\n"Forever an\' ever," echoed little Phronsie, flying up, her cheeks like\r\ntwo pinks, and Seraphina in her arms with her bonnet on upside down.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear," said Polly, pinching Ben to keep still as they tumbled\r\ndown the little rickety steps to the Provision Room, after breakfast.\r\nThe children, content in their treasures, were holding high carnival in\r\nthe kitchen. "Suppose they should find it out now--I declare I should\r\nfeel most awfully. Isn\'t it elegant?" she asked, in a subdued whisper,\r\ngoing all around and around the tree, magnificent in its dress of bright\r\nred and yellow balls, white festoons, and little candle-ends all ready\r\nfor lighting. "Oh, Ben, did you lock the door?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said. "That\'s a mouse," he added, as a little rustling noise\r\nmade Polly stop where she stood back of the tree and prick up her ears\r\nin great distress of mind. "\'Tis elegant," he said, turning around\r\nin admiration, and taking in the tree which, as Polly said, was quite\r\n"gorgeous," and the evergreen branches twisted up on the beams and\r\nrafters, and all the other festive arrangements. "Even Jappy\'s isn\'t\r\nbetter, I don\'t believe!"\r\n\r\n"I wish Jappy was here," said Polly with a small sigh.\r\n\r\n"Well, he isn\'t," said Ben; "come, we must go back into the kitchen, or\r\nall the children will be out here. Look your last, Polly; \'twon\'t do to\r\ncome again till it\'s time to light up."\r\n\r\n"Mammy says she\'d rather do the lighting up," said Polly. "Had she?"\r\nsaid Ben, in surprise; "oh, I suppose she\'s afraid we\'ll set somethin\'\r\na-fire. Well, then, we shan\'t come in till we have it."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear to go," said Polly, turning reluctantly away; "it\'s most\r\nbeautiful--oh, Ben," and she faced him for the five-hundredth time with\r\nthe question, "is your Santa Claus dress all safe?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ben, "I\'ll warrant they won\'t find that in one hurry! Such a\r\ntime as we\'ve had to make it!"\r\n\r\n"I know it," laughed Polly; "don\'t that cotton wool look just like bits\r\nof fur, Ben?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ben, "and when the flour\'s shaken over me it\'ll be Santa\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to put back the hair into mamsie\'s cushion the first thing\r\nto-morrow," whispered Polly anxiously, "and we mustn\'t forget it,\r\nBensie."\r\n\r\n"I want to keep the wig awfully," said Ben. "You did make that just\r\nmagnificent, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"If you could see yourself," giggled Polly; "did you put it in the straw\r\nbed? and are you sure you pulled the ticking over it smooth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," replied Ben, "sure\'s my name\'s Ben Pepper! if you\'ll only\r\nkeep them from seeing me when I\'m in it till we\'re ready--that\'s all I\r\nask."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Polly a little relieved, "but I hope Joe won\'t look."\r\n\r\n"Come on! they\'re a-comin\'!" whispered Ben; "quick!"\r\n\r\n"Polly!" rang a voice dangerously near; so near that Polly, speeding\r\nover the stairs to intercept it, nearly fell on her nose.\r\n\r\n"Where you been?" asked one.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s have a concert," put in Ben; Polly was so out of breath that she\r\ncouldn\'t speak. "Come, now, each take a whistle, and we\'ll march round\r\nand round and see which can make the biggest noise."\r\n\r\nIn the rattle and laughter which this procession made all mystery was\r\nforgotten, and the two conspirators began to breathe freer.\r\n\r\nFive o\'clock! The small ones of the Pepper flock, being pretty well\r\ntired out with noise and excitement, all gathered around Polly and Ben,\r\nand clamored for a story.\r\n\r\n"Do, Polly, do," begged Joel. "It\'s Christmas, and \'twon\'t come again\r\nfor a year."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," said Polly, in such a twitter that she could hardly stand\r\nstill, and for the first time in her life refusing, "I can\'t think of a\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"I will then," said Ben; "we must do something," he whispered to Polly.\r\n\r\n"Tell it good," said Joel, settling himself.\r\n\r\nSo for an hour the small tyrants kept their entertainers well employed.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it growing awful dark?" said Davie, rousing himself at last, as\r\nBen paused to take breath.\r\n\r\nPolly pinched Ben.\r\n\r\n"Mammy\'s a-goin\' to let us know," he whispered in reply. "We must keep\r\non a little longer."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stop," said Joel, lifting his head where he sat on the floor.\r\n"What you whisperin\' for, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not," said Polly, glad to think she hadn\'t spoken.\r\n\r\n"Well, do go on, Ben," said Joel, lying down again.\r\n\r\n"Polly\'ll have to finish it," said Ben; "I\'ve got to go upstairs now."\r\n\r\nSo Polly launched out into such an extravagant story that they all,\r\nperforce, had to listen.\r\n\r\nAll this time Mrs. Pepper had been pretty busy in her way. And now she\r\ncame into the kitchen and set down her candle on the table. "Children,"\r\nshe said. Everybody turned and looked at her--her tone was so strange;\r\nand when they saw her dark eyes shining with such a new light, little\r\nDavie skipped right out into the middle of the room. "What\'s the matter,\r\nmammy?"\r\n\r\n"You may all come into the Provision Room," said she.\r\n\r\n"What for?" shouted Joel, in amazement; while the others jumped to their\r\nfeet, and stood staring.\r\n\r\nPolly flew around like a general, arranging her forces. "Let\'s march\r\nthere," said she; "Phronsie, you take hold of Davie\'s hand, and go\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"I\'m goin\' first," announced Joel, squeezing up past Polly. "No,\r\nyou mustn\'t, Joe," said Polly decidedly; "Phronsie and David are the\r\nyoungest."\r\n\r\n"They\'re always the youngest," said Joel, falling back with Polly to the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\n"Forward! MARCH!" sang Polly. "Follow mamsie!"\r\n\r\nDown the stairs they went with military step, and into the Provision\r\nRoom. And then, with one wild look, the little battalion broke ranks,\r\nand tumbling one over the other in decidedly unmilitary style, presented\r\na very queer appearance!\r\n\r\nAnd Captain Polly was the queerest of all; for she just gave one gaze at\r\nthe tree, and then sat right down on the floor, and said, "Oh! OH!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pepper was flying around delightedly, and saying, "Please to come\r\nright in," and "How do you do?"\r\n\r\nAnd before anybody knew it, there were the laughing faces of Mrs.\r\nHenderson and the Parson himself, Doctor Fisher and old Grandma Bascom;\r\nwhile the two Henderson boys, unwilling to be defrauded of any of the\r\nfun, were squeezing themselves in between everybody else, and coming up\r\nto Polly every third minute, and saying, "There--aren\'t you surprised?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s Fairyland!" cried little Davie, out of his wits with joy; "Oh!\r\naren\'t we in Fairyland, ma?"\r\n\r\nThe whole room was in one buzz of chatter and fun; and everybody beamed\r\non everybody else; and nobody knew what they said, till Mrs. Pepper\r\ncalled, "Hush! Santa Claus is coming!"\r\n\r\nA rattle at the little old window made everybody look there, just as a\r\ngreat snow-white head popped up over the sill.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" screamed Joel, "\'tis Santy!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a-comin\' in!" cried Davie in chorus, which sent Phronsie flying\r\nto Polly. In jumped a little old man, quite spry for his years; with\r\na jolly, red face and a pack on his back, and flew into their midst,\r\nprepared to do his duty; but what should he do, instead of making his\r\nspeech, "this jolly Old Saint--" but first fly up to Mrs. Pepper, and\r\nsay--"Oh, mammy how did you do it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s Ben!" screamed Phronsie; but the little Old Saint didn\'t hear,\r\nfor he and Polly took hold of hands, and pranced around that tree while\r\neverybody laughed till they cried to see them go!\r\n\r\nAnd then it all came out!\r\n\r\n"Order!" said Parson Henderson in his deepest tones; and then he put\r\ninto Santa Claus\' hands a letter, which he requested him to read.\r\nAnd the jolly Old Saint, although he was very old, didn\'t need any\r\nspectacles, but piped out in Ben\'s loudest tones:\r\n\r\n"Dear Friends--A Merry Christmas to you all! And that you\'ll have a good\r\ntime, and enjoy it all as much as I\'ve enjoyed my good times at your\r\nhouse, is the wish of your friend,\r\n\r\n"JASPER ELYOT KING"\r\n\r\n"Hurrah for Jappy!" cried Santa Claus, pulling his beard; and "Hurrah\r\nfor Jasper!" went all around the room; and this ended in three good\r\ncheers--Phronsie coming in too late with her little crow--which was just\r\nas well, however!\r\n\r\n"Do your duty now, Santa Claus!" commanded Dr. Fisher as master of\r\nceremonies; and everything was as still as a mouse!\r\n\r\nAnd the first thing she knew, a lovely brass cage, with a dear little\r\nbird with two astonished black eyes dropped down into Polly\'s hands. The\r\ncard on it said: "For Miss Polly Pepper, to give her music everyday in\r\nthe year."\r\n\r\n"Mammy," said Polly; and then she did the queerest thing of the whole!\r\nshe just burst into tears! "I never thought I should have a bird for my\r\nvery own!"\r\n\r\n"Hulloa!" said Santa Claus, "I\'ve got something myself!"\r\n\r\n"Santa Claus\' clothes are too old," laughed Dr. Fisher, holding up a\r\nstout, warm suit that a boy about as big as Ben would delight in.\r\n\r\nAnd then that wonderful tree just rained down all manner of lovely\r\nfruit. Gifts came flying thick and fast, till the air seemed full, and\r\neach one was greeted with a shout of glee, as it was put into the\r\nhands of its owner. A shawl flew down on Mrs. Pepper\'s shoulders; and\r\na work-basket tumbled on Polly\'s head; and tops and balls and fishing\r\npoles, sent Joel and David into a corner with howls of delight!\r\n\r\nBut the climax was reached when a large wax doll in a very gay pink silk\r\ndress, was put into Phronsie\'s hands, and Dr. Fisher, stooping down,\r\nread in loud tones: "FOR PHRONSIE, FROM ONE WHO ENJOYED HER GINGERBREAD\r\nBOY."\r\n\r\nAfter that, nobody had anything to say! Books jumped down unnoticed, and\r\ngay boxes of candy. Only Polly peeped into one of her books, and saw\r\nin Jappy\'s plain hand--"I hope we\'ll both read this next summer." And\r\nturning over to the title-page, she saw "A Complete Manual of Cookery."\r\n\r\n"The best is to come," said Mrs. Henderson in her gentle way. When there\r\nwas a lull in the gale, she took Polly\'s hand, and led her to a\r\nlittle stand of flowers in the corner concealed by a sheet--pinks and\r\ngeraniums, heliotropes and roses, blooming away, and nodding their\r\npretty heads at the happy sight--Polly had her flowers.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t we know?" cried the children at last, when everybody was\r\ntying on their hoods, and getting their hats to leave the festive scene,\r\n"how could you keep it secret, mammy?"\r\n\r\n"They all went to Mrs. Henderson\'s," said Mrs. Pepper; "Jasper wrote me,\r\nand asked where to send \'em, and Mrs. Henderson was so kind as to say\r\nthat they might come there. And we brought \'em over last evening, when\r\nyou were all abed. I couldn\'t have done it," she said, bowing to the\r\nParson and his wife, "if \'twasn\'t for their kindness--never, in all this\r\nworld!"\r\n\r\n"And I\'m sure," said the minister, looking around on the bright group,\r\n"if we can help along a bit of happiness like this, it is a blessed\r\nthing!"\r\n\r\nAnd here Joel had the last word. "You said \'twan\'t goin\' to be Christmas\r\nalways, mammy. I say," looking around on the overflow of treasures and\r\nthe happy faces--"it\'ll be just forever!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION AHEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that they couldn\'t thank Jasper enough! They tried to, lovingly,\r\nand an elaborate letter of thanks, headed by Mrs. Pepper, was drawn up\r\nand sent with a box of the results of Polly\'s diligent study of Jasper\'s\r\nbook. Polly stripped off recklessly her choicest buds and blossoms from\r\nthe gay little stand of flowers in the corner, that had already begun\r\nto blossom, and tucked them into every little nook in the box that could\r\npossibly hold a posy. But as for thanking him enough!\r\n\r\n"We can\'t do it, mammy," said Polly, looking around on all the happy\r\nfaces, and then up at Cherry, who was singing in the window, and who\r\nimmediately swelled up his little throat and poured out such a merry\r\nburst of song that she had to wait for him to finish. "No, not if we\r\ntried a thousand years!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a-goin\'," said Joel, who was busy as a bee with his new tools that\r\nthe tree had shaken down for him, "to make Jappy the splendidest box you\r\never saw, Polly! I guess that\'ll thank him!"\r\n\r\n"Do," cried Polly; "he\'d be so pleased, Joey."\r\n\r\n"And I," said Phronsie, over in the corner with her children, "I\'m goin\'\r\nto see my poor sick man sometime, Polly, I am!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" cried Polly, whirling around, and looking at her mother\r\nin dismay. "She\'ll be goin\' to-morrow! Oh, no, Phronsie, you can\'t; he\r\nlives miles and miles away--oh, ever so far!"\r\n\r\n"Does he live as far as the moon?" asked little Phronsie, carefully\r\nlaying Seraphina down, and looking up at Polly, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," said Polly, giving Cherry a piece of bread, and\r\nlaughing to see how cunning he looked. "Oh, no, of course not, but it\'s\r\nan awful long ways, Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Phronsie, determinedly, giving the new doll a\r\nloving little pat, "I\'m goin\' sometime, Polly, to thank my poor sick\r\nman, yes, I am!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see him next summer, Phronsie," sang Polly skipping around the\r\nkitchen, "and Jappy\'s sister Marian, the lovely lady, and all the boys.\r\nWon\'t that be nice?" and Polly stopped to pat the yellow head bending in\r\nmotherly attentions over her array of dolls.\r\n\r\n"Ye-es," said Phronsie, slowly; "the whole of \'em, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed!" said Polly, gayly; "the whole of \'em, Phronsie!\r\n\r\n"Hooray!" shouted the two boys, while Phronsie only gave a long sigh,\r\nand clasped her hands.\r\n\r\n"Better not be looking for summer," said Mrs. Pepper, "until you do\r\nyour duty by the winter; then you can enjoy it," and she took a fresh\r\nneedleful of thread.\r\n\r\n"Mamsie\'s right," said Ben, smiling over at her. And he threw down\r\nhis book and jumped for his cap. "Now for a good chop!" he cried, and\r\nsnatching a kiss from Phronsie, he rushed out of the door to his work,\r\nwhistling as he went.\r\n\r\n"Warn\'t Mr. Henderson good, ma," asked Polly, watching his retreating\r\nfigure, "to give Ben learning?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he was," replied Mrs. Pepper, enthusiastically. "We\'ve got a\r\nparson, if anybody has in this world!"\r\n\r\n"And Ben\'s learning," said Polly, swelling with pride, as she sat down\r\nby her mother, and began to sew rapidly, "so that he\'ll be a big man\r\nright off! Oh, dear," as a thought made her needle pause a minute in its\r\nquick flying in and out.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Polly?" Mrs. Pepper looked keenly at the troubled face and\r\ndowncast eyes.\r\n\r\n"Why--" began Polly, and then she finished very slowly, "I shan\'t know\r\nanything, and Ben\'ll be ashamed of me.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you will!" cried Mrs. Pepper, energetically, "you keep on trying,\r\nand the Lord\'ll send some way; don\'t you go to bothering your head about\r\nit now, Polly--it\'ll come when it\'s time."\r\n\r\n"Will it?" asked Polly, doubtfully, taking up her needle again.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed!" cried Mrs. Pepper, briskly; "come fly at your sewing;\r\nthat\'s your learning now."\r\n\r\n"So \'tis," said Polly, with a little laugh. "Now let\'s see which\'ll get\r\ntheir seam done first, mamsie?"\r\n\r\nAnd now letters flew thick and fast from the city to the little brown\r\nhouse, and back again, warming Jasper\'s heart, and filling the tedious\r\nmonths of that winter with more of jollity and fun than the lad ever\r\nenjoyed before; and never was fun and jollity more needed than now;\r\nfor Mr. King, having nothing to do, and each year finding himself less\r\ninclined to exercise any thoughtful energy for others, began to look at\r\nlife something in the light of a serious bore, and accordingly made it\r\ndecidedly disagreeable for all around him, and particularly for Jasper\r\nwho was his constant companion. But the boy was looking forward to\r\nsummer, and so held on bravely.\r\n\r\n"I do verily believe, Polly," he wrote, "that Badgertown\'ll see the\r\ngayest times it ever knew! Sister Marian wants to go, so that\'s all\r\nright. Now, hurrah for a good time--it\'s surely coming!"\r\n\r\nBut alas! for Jasper! as spring advanced, his father took a decided\r\naversion to Hingham, Badgertown, and all other places that could be\r\nmentioned in that vicinity.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a wretched climate," he asserted, over and over; "and the\r\nfoundation of all my ill feelings this winter was laid, I\'m convinced,\r\nin Hingham last summer."\r\n\r\nNo use to urge the contrary; and all Jasper\'s pleadings were equally\r\nvain. At last, sister Marian, who was kind-hearted to a fault, sorry to\r\nsee her brother\'s dismay and disappointment said, one day, "Why not have\r\none of the children come here? I should like it very much--do invite\r\nBen."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want Ben," said Jasper gloomily, "I want Polly." He added this\r\nin much the same tone as Phronsie\'s when she had rushed up to him the\r\nday she was lost, declaring, "I want Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Very well, then," said sister Marian, laughing, "I\'m sure I didn\'t mean\r\nto dictate which one; let it be Polly then; yes, I should prefer Polly\r\nmyself, I think, as we\'ve enough boys now," smiling to think of her own\r\nbrood of wide awake youngsters.\r\n\r\n"If you only will, father, I\'ll try to be ever so good!" said Jasper,\r\nturning suddenly to his father.\r\n\r\n"Jasper needs some change," said sister Marian kindly, "he really has\r\ngrown very pale and thin."\r\n\r\n"Hey!" said Mr. King, sharply, looking at him over his eyeglasses. "The\r\nboy\'s well enough; well enough!" But he twisted uneasily in his chair,\r\nall the same. At last he flung down his paper, twitched his fingers\r\nthrough his hair two or three times, and then burst out--"Well, why\r\ndon\'t you send for her? I\'m sure I don\'t care--I\'ll write myself, and I\r\nhad better do it now. Tell Thomas to be ready to take it right down; it\r\nmust get into this mail."\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. King had made up his mind to do anything, everybody else must\r\nimmediately give up their individual plans, and stand out of the way for\r\nhim to execute his at just that particular moment! Accordingly Thomas\r\nwas dragged from his work to post the letter, while the old gentleman\r\noccupied the time in pulling out his watch every third second until the\r\nslightly-out-of-breath Thomas reported on his return that the letter\r\ndid get in. Then Mr. King settled down satisfied, and everything went on\r\nsmoothly as before.\r\n\r\nBut Polly didn\'t come! A grateful, appreciative letter, expressed in\r\nMrs. Pepper\'s own stiff way, plainly showed the determination of that\r\ngood woman not to accept what was such a favor to her child.\r\n\r\nIn vain Mr. King stormed, and fretted, and begged, offering every\r\nadvantage possible--Polly should have the best foundation for a musical\r\neducation that the city could afford; also lessons in the schoolroom\r\nunder the boys\' private tutor--it was all of no avail. In vain sister\r\nMarian sent a gentle appeal, fully showing her heart was in it; nothing\r\nbroke down Mrs. Pepper\'s resolve, until, at last, the old gentleman\r\nwrote one day that Jasper, being in such failing health, really depended\r\non Polly to cheer him up. That removed the last straw that made it\r\n"putting one\'s self under an obligation," which to Mrs. Pepper\'s\r\nindependent soul, had seemed insurmountable.\r\n\r\nAnd now, it was decided that Polly was really to go! and pretty soon all\r\nBadgertown knew that Polly Pepper was going to the big city. And there\r\nwasn\'t a man, woman, or child but what greatly rejoiced that a sunny\r\ntime was coming to one of the chicks in the little brown house. With\r\nmany warm words, and some substantial gifts, kind friends helped forward\r\nthe "outing." Only one person doubted that this delightful chance should\r\nbe grasped at once--and that one was Polly herself!\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," she said, and stood quite pale and still, when the Hendersons\r\nadvised her mother\'s approval, and even Grandma Bascom said, "Go." "I\r\ncan\'t go and leave mammy to do all the work."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you see, Polly," said Mrs. Henderson, drawing her to her\r\nside, "that you will help your mother twice as much as you possibly\r\ncould here, by getting a good education? Think what your music will be;\r\nonly think, Polly!"\r\n\r\nPolly drew a long breath at this and turned away.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Polly!" cried Ben, though his voice choked, "if you give this up,\r\nthere never\'ll be another chance," and the boy put his arm around her,\r\nand whispered something in her ear.\r\n\r\n"I know," said Polly quietly--and then she burst out, "oh, but I can\'t!\r\n\'tisn\'t right."\r\n\r\n"Polly," said Mrs. Pepper--and never in all their lives had the children\r\nseen such a look in mamsie\'s eyes as met them then; "it does seem as\r\nif my heart would be broken if you didn\'t go!" And then she burst out\r\ncrying, right before them all!\r\n\r\n"Oh mammy," cried Polly, breaking away from everybody, and flinging\r\nherself into her arms. "I\'ll go--if you think I ought to. But it\'s too\r\ngood! don\'t cry--don\'t, mammy dear," and Polly stroked the careworn face\r\nlovingly, and patted the smooth hair that was still so black.\r\n\r\n"And, Polly," said Mrs. Pepper, smiling through her tears, "just think\r\nwhat a comfort you\'ll be to me, and us all," she added, taking in the\r\nchildren who were crowding around Polly as the centre of attraction.\r\n"Why, you\'ll be the making of us," she added hopefully.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do something," said Polly, her brown eyes kindling, "or I shan\'t\r\nbe worthy of you, mammy."\r\n\r\n"O, you\'ll do it," said Mrs. Pepper, confidently, "now that you\'re\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\nBut when Polly stepped into the stage, with her little hair trunk\r\nstrapped on behind, containing her one brown merino that Mrs. Henderson\r\nhad made over for her out of one of her own, and her two new ginghams,\r\nher courage failed again, and she astonished everybody, and nearly upset\r\na mild-faced old lady who was in the corner placidly eating doughnuts,\r\nby springing out and rushing up through the little brown gate, past\r\nall the family, drawn up to see her off. She flew over the old flat\r\ndoor-stone, and into the bedroom, where she flung herself down between\r\nthe old bed and Phronsie\'s crib, in a sudden torrent of tears. "I can\'t\r\ngo!" she sobbed--"oh I can\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Why, Polly!" cried Mrs. Pepper, hurrying in, followed by Joel and the\r\nrest of the troops at his heels. "What are you thinking of!"\r\n\r\n"Think of by-and-by, Polly," put in Ben, patting her on the back with\r\nan unsteady hand, while Joel varied the proceedings by running back\r\nand forth, screaming at the top of his lungs, "The stage\'s going! your\r\ntrunk\'ll be taken!"\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" ejaculated Mrs. Pepper, "do stop it somebody! there, Polly,\r\ncome now! Do as mother says!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try again," said poor Polly, choking back her sobs, and getting on\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\nThen Polly\'s tears were wiped away, her hat straightened, after which\r\nshe was kissed all round again by the whole family, Phronsie waiting\r\nfor the last two, and then was helped again into the stage, the bags and\r\nparcels, and a box for Jappy, which, as it wouldn\'t go into the trunk,\r\nJoel had insisted Polly should carry in her hand, were again piled\r\naround her, and Mr. Tisbett mounted to his seat, and with a crack of the\r\nwhip, bore her safely off this time.\r\n\r\nThe doughnut lady, viewing poor Polly with extreme sympathy, immediately\r\nforced upon her acceptance three of the largest and sugariest.\r\n\r\n"Twill do you good," she said, falling to, herself, on another with\r\ngood zeal. "I always eat \'em, and then there ain\'t any room for\r\nhomesickness!"\r\n\r\nAnd away, and away, and away they rumbled and jumbled to the cars.\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Tisbett put Polly and her numerous bundles under the care of\r\nthe conductor, with manifold charges and explicit directions, to see her\r\nsafely into Mr. King\'s own hands. He left her sitting straight up among\r\nher parcels, her sturdy little figure drawn up to its full height, and\r\nthe clear brown eyes regaining a little of their dancing light; for\r\nalthough a dreadful feeling tugged at her heart, as she thought of the\r\nlittle brown house she was fast flying away from, there was something\r\nelse; our Polly had begun to realize that now she was going to "help\r\nmother."\r\n\r\nAnd now they neared the big city, and everybody began to bustle around,\r\nand get ready to jump out, and the minute the train stopped, the crowd\r\npoured out from the cars, making way for the crowd pouring in, for this\r\nwas a through train.\r\n\r\n"All aboard!" sang the conductor. "Oh my senses!" springing to Polly; "I\r\nforgot you--here!"\r\n\r\nBut as quick as a flash he was pushed aside, and a bright, boyish figure\r\ndashed up.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Polly!" he said in such a ringing voice! and in another second,\r\nPolly and her bag, and the bundle of cakes and apples that Grandma\r\nBascom had put up for her, and Joel\'s box, were one and all bundled\r\nout upon the platform, and the train whizzed on, and there Mr. King was\r\nfuming up and down, berating the departing conductor, and speaking\r\nhis mind in regard to all the railroad officials he could think of. He\r\npulled himself up long enough to give Polly a hearty welcome; and then\r\naway again he flew in righteous indignation, while Jasper rushed off\r\ninto the baggage room with Polly\'s check.\r\n\r\nHowever, every now and then, turning to look down into the little rosy\r\nface beside him, the old gentleman would burst forth, "Bless me, child!\r\nI\'m glad you\'re here, Polly!--how could the fellow forget when--"\r\n\r\n"Oh well, you know," said Polly, with a happy little wriggle under her\r\nbrown coat, "I\'m here now."\r\n\r\n"So you are! so you are!" laughed the old gentleman suddenly; "where can\r\nJasper be so long."\r\n\r\n"They\'re all in the carriage," answered the boy skipping back. "Now,\r\nfather! now Polly!"\r\n\r\nHe was fairly bubbling over with joy and Mr. King forgot his dudgeon and\r\njoined in the general glee, which soon became so great that travellers\r\ngave many a glance at the merry trio who bundled away to Thomas and the\r\nwaiting grays.\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure you\'ve got the right check?" asked Mr. King, nervously,\r\ngetting into a handsome coach lined with dark green satin, and settling\r\ndown among its ample cushions with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," laughed Jasper; "Polly didn\'t have any one else\'s check, I\r\nguess."\r\n\r\nOver through the heart of the city, down narrow, noisy business\r\nstreets, out into wide avenues, with handsome stately mansions on either\r\nside--they flew along.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Polly; and then she stopped, and blushed very hard.\r\n\r\n"What is it, my dear?" asked Mr. King, kindly.\r\n\r\nPolly couldn\'t speak at first, but when Jasper stopped his merry chat\r\nand begged to know what it was, she turned on him, and burst out, "You\r\nlive here?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," laughed the boy; "why not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Polly again, her cheeks as red as two roses, "it\'s so\r\nlovely!"\r\n\r\nAnd then the carriage turned in at a brown stone gateway, and winding\r\nup among some fine old trees, stopped before a large, stately residence\r\nthat in Polly\'s eyes seemed like one of the castles of Ben\'s famous\r\nstories. And then Mr. King got out, and gallantly escorted Polly out,\r\nand up the steps, while Jasper followed with Polly\'s bag which he\r\ncouldn\'t be persuaded to resign to Thomas. A stiff waiter held the door\r\nopen--and then, the rest was only a pleasant, confused jumble of kind\r\nwelcoming words, smiling faces, with a background of high spacious\r\nwalls, bright pictures, and soft elegant hangings, everything and all\r\ninextricably mixed--till Polly herself seemed floating--away--away, fast\r\nto the Fairyland of her dreams; now, Mr. King was handing her around,\r\nlike a precious parcel, from one to the other--now Jasper was bobbing\r\nin and out everywhere, introducing her on all sides, and then Prince\r\nwas jumping up and trying to lick her face every minute--but best of all\r\nwas, when a lovely face looked down into hers, and Jasper\'s sister bent\r\nto kiss her.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to have you here, little Polly." The words were simple,\r\nbut Polly, lifting up her clear brown eyes, looked straight into the\r\nheart of the speaker, and from that moment never ceased to love her.\r\n\r\n"It was a good inspiraton," thought Mrs. Whitney to herself; "this\r\nlittle girl is going to be a comfort, I know." And then she set herself\r\nto conduct successfully her three boys into friendliness and good\r\nfellowship with Polly, for each of them was following his own sweet will\r\nin the capacity of host, and besides staring at her with all his might,\r\nwas determined to do the whole of the entertaining, a state of things\r\nwhich might become unpleasant. However, Polly stood it like a veteran.\r\n\r\n"This little girl must be very tired," said Mrs. Whitney, at last with a\r\nbright smile. "Besides I am going to have her to myself now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no," cried little Dick in alarm; "why, she\'s just come; we want\r\nto see her."\r\n\r\n"For shame, Dick!" said Percy, the eldest, a boy of ten years, who took\r\nevery opportunity to reprove Dick in public; "she\'s come a great ways,\r\nso she ought to rest, you know."\r\n\r\n"You wanted her to come out to the greenhouse yourself, you know you\r\ndid," put in Van, the next to Percy, who never would be reproved or\r\npatronized, "only she wouldn\'t go."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll come down to dinner," said Percy, politely, ignoring Van. "Then\r\nyou won\'t be tired, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not very tired now," said Polly, brightly, with a merry little\r\nlaugh, "only I\'ve never been in the cars before, and--"\r\n\r\n"Never been in the cars before!" exclaimed Van, crowding up, while Percy\r\nmade a big round O with his mouth, and little Dick\'s eyes stretched to\r\ntheir widest extent.\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly simply, "never in all my life."\r\n\r\n"Come, dear," said sister Marian, rising quickly, and taking Polly\'s\r\nhand; while Jasper, showing unmistakable symptoms of pitching into all\r\nthe three boys, followed with the bag.\r\n\r\nUp the broad oak staircase they went, Polly holding by Mrs. Whitney\'s\r\nsoft hand, as if for dear life, and Jasper tripping up two steps at a\r\ntime, in front of them. They turned after reaching the top, down a hall\r\nsoft to the foot and brightly lighted.\r\n\r\n"Now, Polly," said sister Marian, "I\'m going to have you here, right\r\nnext to my dressing room; this is your nest, little bird, and I hope\r\nyou\'ll be very happy in it."\r\n\r\nAnd here Mrs. Whitney turned up the gas, and then, just because she\r\ncouldn\'t help it, gathered Polly up in her arms without another word.\r\nJasper set down the bag on a chair, and came and stood by his sister\'s\r\nside, looking down at her as she stroked the brown wavy hair on her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n"It\'s so nice to have Polly here, sister," he said, and he put his hand\r\non Mrs. Whitney\'s neck; and then with the other hand took hold of both\r\nof Polly\'s chubby ones, who looked up and smiled; and in that smile the\r\nlittle brown house seemed to hop right out, and bring back in a flash\r\nall the nice times those eight happy weeks had brought him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, \'twas so perfectly splendid, sister Marian," he cried, flinging\r\nhimself down on the floor by her chair. "You don\'t know what good times\r\nwe had--does she, Polly?" and then he launched out into a perfect\r\nshower of "Don\'t you remember this?" or "Oh, Polly! you surely haven\'t\r\nforgotten that!" Mrs. Whitney good naturedly entering into it and\r\nenjoying it all with them, until, warned by the lateness of the hour,\r\nshe laughingly reminded Jasper of dinner, and dismissed him to prepare\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nWhen the three boys saw Polly coming in again, they welcomed her with\r\na cordial shout, for one and all, after careful measurement of her,\r\nhad succumbed entirely to Polly; and each was unwilling that the others\r\nshould get ahead of him in her regard.\r\n\r\n"This is your seat, Polly," said sister Marian, touching the chair next\r\nto her own.\r\n\r\nThereupon a small fight ensued between the little Whitneys, while Jasper\r\nlooked decidedly discomfited.\r\n\r\n"Let Polly sit next to me," said Van, as if a seat next to him was of\r\nall things most to be desired.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I want her," said little Dick.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw, Dick! you\'re too young," put in Percy. "You\'d spill the bread\r\nand butter all over her."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t either," said little Dick, indignantly, and beginning to\r\ncrawl into his seat; "I don\'t spill bread and butter, now Percy, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"See here," said Jasper, decidedly, "she\'s coming up here by father\r\nand me; that is, sister Marian," he finished more politely, "if you\'re\r\nwilling."\r\n\r\nAll this while Polly had stood quietly watching the group, the big,\r\nhandsome table, the bright lights, and the well-trained servants with\r\na curious feeling at her heart--what were the little-brown-house-people\r\ndoing?\r\n\r\n"Polly shall decide it," said sister Marian, laughing. "Now, where\r\nwill you sit, dear?" she added, looking down on the little quiet figure\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, by Jappy, please," said Polly, quickly, as if there could be no\r\ndoubt; "and kind Mr. King," she added, smiling at him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right; that\'s right, my dear," cried the old gentleman, pleased\r\nbeyond measure at her honest choice. And he pulled out her chair, and\r\nwaited upon her into it so handsomely that Polly was happy at once;\r\nwhile Jasper, with a proud toss of his dark, wavy hair, marched up\r\ndelightedly, and took the chair on her other side.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in two or three minutes it seemed as if Polly had always been\r\nthere; it was the most natural thing in the world that sister Marian\r\nshould smile down the table at the bright-faced narrator, who answered\r\nall their numerous questions, and entertained them all with accounts of\r\nBen\'s skill, of Phronsie\'s cunning ways, of the boys who made fun for\r\nall, and above everything else of the dear mother whom they all longed\r\nto help, and of all the sayings and doings in the little brown house. No\r\nwonder that the little boys forgot to eat; and for once never thought of\r\nthe attractions of the table. And when, as they left the table at last,\r\nlittle Dick rushed impulsively up to Polly, and flinging himself into\r\nher arms, declared, "I love you!--and you\'re my sister!" Nothing more\r\nwas needed to make Polly feel at home.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Whitney, and nodded to herself in the saying, "it was a\r\ngood thing; and a comfort, I believe, has come to this house this day!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAVE WORK AND THE REWARD\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd on the very first morrow came Polly\'s music teacher!\r\n\r\nThe big drawing-room, with its shaded light and draped furniture, with\r\nits thick soft carpet, on which no foot-fall could be heard, with all\r\nits beauty and loveliness on every side was nothing to Polly\'s eyes,\r\nonly the room that contained the piano!\r\n\r\nThat was all she saw! And when the teacher came he was simply the Fairy\r\n(an ugly little one, it is true, but still a most powerful being) who\r\nwas to unlock its mysteries, and conduct her into Fairyland itself. He\r\nwas a homely little Frenchman, with a long, curved nose, and an enormous\r\nblack moustache, magnificently waxed, who bowed elaborately, and called\r\nher "Mademoiselle Pep-paire;" but he had music in his soul, and Polly\r\ncouldn\'t reverence him too much.\r\n\r\nAnd now the big piano gave out new sounds; sounds that told of a strong\r\npurpose and steady patience. Every note was struck for mother and the\r\nhome brood. Monsieur Tourtelotte, after watching her keenly out of his\r\nlittle black eyes, would nod to himself like a mandarin, and the nod\r\nwould be followed by showers of extra politeness, as his appreciation of\r\nher patient energy and attention.\r\n\r\nEvery chance she could get, Polly would steal away into the drawing-room\r\nfrom Jappy and the three boys and all the attractions they could offer,\r\nand laboriously work away over and over at the tedious scales and\r\nexercises that were to be stepping-stones to so much that was glorious\r\nbeyond. Never had she sat still for so long a time in her active little\r\nlife; and now, with her arms at just such an angle, with the stiff,\r\nchubby fingers kept under training and restraint--well, Polly realized,\r\nyears after, that only her love of the little brown house could ever\r\nhave kept her from flying up and spinning around in perfect despair.\r\n\r\n"She likes it!" said Percy, in absolute astonishment, one day, when\r\nPolly had refused to go out driving with all the other children in the\r\npark, and had gone resolutely, instead, into the drawing-room and shut\r\nthe door. "She likes those hateful old exercises and she don\'t like\r\nanything else."\r\n\r\n"Much you know about it," said Jappy; "she\'s perfectly aching to go, now\r\nPercy Whitney!"\r\n\r\n"Well, why don\'t she then?" said Percy, opening his eyes to their widest\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n"Cause," said Jasper, stopping on his way to the door to look him full\r\nin the face, "she\'s commenced to learn to play, and there won\'t anything\r\nstop her."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to try," said Percy, gleefully. "I know lots of ways I can do\r\nto try, anyway."\r\n\r\n"See here, now," said Jasper, turning back, "you let her alone! Do\r\nyou hear?" he added, and there must have been something in his eye to\r\ncommand attention, for Percy instantly signified his intention not to\r\ntease this young music student in the least.\r\n\r\n"Come on then, old fellow," and Jasper swung his cap on his head,\r\n"Thomas will be like forty bears if we keep him waiting much longer."\r\n\r\nAnd Polly kept at it steadily day after day; getting through with the\r\nlessons in the schoolroom as quickly as possible to rush to her music,\r\nuntil presently the little Frenchman waxed enthusiastic to that degree\r\nthat, as day after day progressed and swelled into weeks, and each\r\nlesson came to an end, he would skip away on the tips of his toes, his\r\nnose in the air, and the waxed ends of his moustache, fairly trembling\r\nwith delight, "Ah, such patience as Mademoiselle Pep-paire has! I know\r\nno other such little Americane!"\r\n\r\n"I think," said Jasper one evening after dinner, when all the children\r\nwere assembled as usual in their favorite place on the big rug in front\r\nof the fire in the library, Prince in the middle of the group, his head\r\non his paws, watching everything in infinite satisfaction, "that Polly\'s\r\ngetting on in music as I never saw anyone do; and that\'s a fact!"\r\n\r\n"I mean to begin," said Van, ambitiously, sitting up straight and\r\nstaring at the glowing coals. "I guess I will to-morrow," which\r\nannouncement was received with a perfect shout--Van\'s taste being\r\nanything rather than of a musical nature.\r\n\r\n"If you do," said Jappy, when the merriment had a little subsided, "I\r\nshall go out of the house at every lesson; there won\'t anyone stay in\r\nit, Van."\r\n\r\n"I can bang all I want to, then," said Van, noways disturbed by the\r\nreflection, and pulling one of Prince\'s long ears, "you think you\'re so\r\nbig, Jappy, just because you\'re thirteen."\r\n\r\n"He\'s only three ahead of me, Van," bristled Percy, who never could\r\nforgive Jappy for being his uncle, much less the still greater sin of\r\nhaving been born three years earlier than himself.\r\n\r\n"Three\'s just as bad as four," said Van.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s tell stories," began Polly, who never could remember such goings\r\non in the little brown house; "we must each tell one," she added with\r\nthe greatest enthusiasm, "and see which will be the biggest and the\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Van, who perfectly revelled in Polly\'s stories, and who\r\nnow forgot his trials in the prospect of one, "You tell, Polly--you tell\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"Yes, do, Polly," said Jasper; "we\'d rather."\r\n\r\nSo Polly launched out into one of her gayest and finest; and soon\r\nthey were in such a peal of laughter, and had reached such heights of\r\nenjoyment, that Mr. King popped his head in at the door, and then came\r\nin, and took a seat in a big rocking-chair in the corner to hear the fun\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Van, leaning back with a long sigh, and wiping his\r\nflushed face as Polly wound up with a triumphant flourish, \'how ever do\r\nyou think of such things, Polly Pepper?\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t anything," said Jappy, bringing his handsome face out into\r\nthe strong light; "why, it\'s just nothing to what she has told time and\r\nagain in the little brown house in Badgertown;" and then he caught\r\nsight of Polly\'s face, which turned a little pale in the firelight as he\r\nspoke; and the brown eyes had such a pathetic droop in them that it went\r\nto the boy\'s very heart.\r\n\r\nWas Polly homesick? and so soon!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLY IS COMFORTED\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, it must be confessed. Polly was homesick. All her imaginations of\r\nher mother\'s hard work, increased by her absence, loomed up before her,\r\ntill she was almost ready to fly home without a minute\'s warning. At\r\nnight, when no one knew it, the tears would come racing over the poor,\r\nforlorn little face, and would not be squeezed back. It got to be\r\nnoticed finally; and one and all redoubled their exertions to make\r\neverything twice as pleasant as ever!\r\n\r\nThe only place, except in front of the grand piano, where Polly\r\napproached a state of comparative happiness, was in the greenhouse.\r\n\r\nHere she would stay, comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and\r\nrich exotics, rejoicing the heart of Old Turner the gardener, who since\r\nPolly\'s first rapturous entrance, had taken her into his good graces for\r\nall time.\r\n\r\nEvery chance she could steal after practice hours were over, and after\r\nthe clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied,\r\nwas seized to fly on the wings of the wind, to the flowers.\r\n\r\nBut even with the music and flowers the dancing light in the eyes went\r\ndown a little; and Polly, growing more silent and pale, moved around\r\nwith a little droop to the small figure that had only been wont to fly\r\nthrough the wide halls and spacious rooms with gay and springing step.\r\n\r\n"Polly don\'t like us," at last said Van one day in despair. "Then,\r\ndear," said Mrs. Whitney, "you must be kinder to her than ever;\r\nthink what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like it first rate to be away from Percy," said Van, reflectively;\r\n"I wouldn\'t come back in three, no, six weeks."\r\n\r\n"My son," said his mamma, "just stop and think how badly you would feel,\r\nif you really couldn\'t see Percy."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Van, and he showed signs of relenting a little at that;\r\n"but Percy is perfectly awful, mamma, you don\'t know; and he feels so\r\nsmart too," he said vindictively.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mrs. Whitney, softly, "let\'s think what we can do for\r\nPolly; it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little face."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways\r\nhe could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she\'d like my new\r\nbook of travels--or my velocipede," he added.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid those wouldn\'t quite answer the purpose," said his mamma,\r\nsmiling--"especially the last; yet we must think of something."\r\n\r\nBut just here Mr. King thought it about time to take matters into his\r\nhands. So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was\r\nby, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn\'t\r\nbe back to lunch.\r\n\r\nPolly sat in the drawing-room, near the edge of the twilight, practicing\r\naway bravely. Somehow, of all the days when the home feeling was the\r\nstrongest, this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer. If she\r\ncould only see Phronsie for just one moment! "I shall have to give up!"\r\nshe moaned. "I can\'t bear it!" and over went her head on the music rack.\r\n\r\n"Where is she?" said a voice over in front of the piano, in the\r\ngathering dusk--unmistakably Mr. King\'s.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s always at the piano," said Van. "She must be there now,\r\nsomewhere," and then somebody laughed. Then came in the loudest of\r\nwhispers from little Dick, "Oh, Jappy, what\'ll she say?"\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said one of the other boys; "do be still, Dick!"\r\n\r\nPolly sat up very straight, and whisked off the tears quickly. Up came\r\nMr. King with an enormous bundle in his arms; and he marched up to the\r\npiano, puffing with his exertions.\r\n\r\n"Here, Polly, hold your arms," he had only strength to gasp. And then he\r\nbroke out into a loud burst of merriment, in which all the troop joined,\r\nuntil the big room echoed with the sound.\r\n\r\nAt this, the bundle opened suddenly, and--out popped Phronsie!\r\n\r\n"Here I\'m! I\'m here, Polly!"\r\n\r\nBut Polly couldn\'t speak; and if Jasper hadn\'t caught her just in time,\r\nshe would have tumbled over backward from the stool, Phronsie and all!\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you glad I\'ve come, Polly?" asked Phronsie, with her little face\r\nclose to Polly\'s own.\r\n\r\nThat brought Polly to. "Oh, Phronsie!" she cried, and strained her to\r\nher heart; while the boys crowded around, and plied her with sudden\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n"Now you\'ll stay," cried Van; "say, Polly, won\'t you."\r\n\r\n"Weren\'t you awfully surprised?" cried Percy; "say, Polly, awfully?"\r\n\r\n"Is her name Phronsie," put in Dick, unwilling to be left out, and not\r\nthinking of anything else to ask.\r\n\r\n"Boys," whispered their mother, warningly, "she can\'t answer you; just\r\nlook at her face."\r\n\r\nAnd to be sure, our Polly\'s face was a study to behold. All its old\r\nsunniness was as nothing to the joy that now transfigured it.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over\r\nto Mr. King with Phronsie still in her arms. "Oh, you are the dearest\r\nand best Mr. King I ever saw! but how did you make mammy let her come?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he splendid!" cried Jasper in intense pride, swelling up. "Father\r\nknew how to do it."\r\n\r\nBut Polly\'s arms were around the old gentleman\'s neck, so she didn\'t\r\nhear. "There, there," he said soothingly, patting her brown, fuzzy head.\r\nSomething was going down the old gentleman\'s neck, that wet his collar,\r\nand made him whisper very tenderly in her ear, "don\'t give way now,\r\nPolly; Phronsie\'ll see you."\r\n\r\n"I know," gasped Polly, controlling her sobs; "I won\'t--only--I can\'t\r\nthank you!"\r\n\r\n"Phronsie," said Jasper quickly, "what do you suppose Prince said the\r\nother day?"\r\n\r\n"What?" asked Phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of Polly\'s\r\narms, and crowding up close to Jasper\'s side. "What did he, Jasper?"\r\n\r\n"Oh-ho, how funny!" laughed Van, while little Dick burst right out,\r\n"Japser!"\r\n\r\n"Be still," said Jappy warningly, while Phronsie stood surveying them\r\nall with grave eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, I asked him, \'Don\'t you want to see Phronsie Pepper, Prince?\' And\r\ndo you know, he just stood right upon his hind legs, Phronsie, and said:\r\n\'Bark! yes, Bark! Bark!\'"\r\n\r\n"Did he really, Jasper?" cried Phronsie, delighted beyond measure; and\r\nclasping her hands in rapture, "all alone by himself?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, all alone by himself," asserted Jasper, vehemently, and winking\r\nfuriously to the others to stop their laughing; "he did now, truly,\r\nPhronsie."\r\n\r\n"Then mustn\'t I go and see him now, Jasper? yes, pretty soon now?"\r\n\r\n"So you must," cried Jasper, enchanted at his success in amusing; "and\r\nI\'ll go with you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," cried Phronsie, shaking her yellow head. "Oh no, Jasper; I\r\nmust go by my very own self."\r\n\r\n"There Jap, you\'ve caught it," laughed Percy; while the others screamed\r\nat the sight of Jasper\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Oh Phronsie!" cried Polly, turning around at the last words; "how could\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind it, Polly," whispered Jasper; "twasn\'t her fault."\r\n\r\n"Phronsie," said Mrs. Whitney, smilingly, stooping over the child,\r\n"would you like to see a little pussy I have for you?"\r\n\r\nBut the chubby face didn\'t look up brightly, as usual: and the next\r\nmoment, without a bit of warning, Phronsie sprang past them all, even\r\nPolly, and flung herself into Mr. King\'s arms, in a perfect torrent of\r\nsobs. "Oh! let\'s go back!" was all they heard!\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" ejaculated the old gentleman, in the utmost amazement; "and\r\nsuch a time as I\'ve had to get her here too!" he added, staring around\r\non the astonished group, none of whom had a word to say.\r\n\r\nBut Polly stood like a statue! All Jasper\'s frantic efforts at comfort,\r\nutterly failed. To think that Phronsie had left her for any one!--even\r\ngood Mr. King! The room seemed to buzz, and everything to turn upside\r\ndown--and just then, she heard another cry--"Oh, I want Polly, I do!"\r\n\r\nWith a bound, Polly was at Mr. King\'s side, with her face on his coat,\r\nclose to the little tear-stained one. The fat, little arms unclasped\r\ntheir hold, and transferred themselves willingly to Polly\'s neck; and\r\nPhronsie hugged up comfortingly to Polly\'s heart, who poured into her\r\near all the loving words she had so longed to say.\r\n\r\nJust then there was a great rush and a scuffling noise; and something\r\nrushed up to Phronsie "Oh!" And then the next minute, she had her arms\r\naround Prince\'s neck, too, who was jumping all over her and trying as\r\nhard as he could, to express his overwhelming delight.\r\n\r\n"She\'s the cunningest little thing I ever saw," said Mrs. Whitney,\r\nenthusiastically, afterward, aside to Mr. King. "Such lovely yellow\r\nhair, and such exquisite brown eyes--the combination is very striking.\r\nHow did her mother ever let her go?" she asked impulsively, "I didn\'t\r\nbelieve you could persuade her, father."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t have any fears, if I worked it rightly," said the old\r\ngentleman complacently. "I wasn\'t coming without her, Marian, if it\r\ncould possibly be managed. The truth is, that Phronsie had been pining\r\nfor Polly to such an extent, that there was no other way but for her\r\nto have Polly; and her mother was just on the point, although it almost\r\nkilled her, of sending for Polly--as if we should have let her go!" he\r\ncried in high dudgeon; just as if he owned the whole of the Peppers, and\r\ncould dispose of them all to suit his fancy! "So you see, I was just in\r\ntime; in the very nick of time, in fact!"\r\n\r\n"So her mother was willing?" asked his daughter, curiously. "Oh, she\r\ncouldn\'t help it," cried Mr. King, beginning to walk up and down the\r\nfloor, and beaming as he recalled his successful strategy; "there wasn\'t\r\nthe smallest use in thinking of anything else. I told her \'twould just\r\nstop Polly from ever being a musician if she broke off now--and so\r\n\'twould, you know yourself, Marian, for we should never get the child\r\nhere again, if we let her go now; and I talked--well, I had to talk\r\nsome; but, well--the upshot is I did get her, and I did bring her--and\r\nhere she is!" And the old gentleman was so delighted with his success,\r\nthat he had to burst out into a series of short, happy bits of laughter,\r\nthat occupied quite a space of time. At last he came out of them, and\r\nwiped his face vigorously.\r\n\r\n"And to think how fond the little girl is of you, father!" said Mrs.\r\nWhitney, who hadn\'t yet gotten over her extreme surprise at the old\r\ngentleman\'s complete subjection to the little Peppers: he, whom all\r\nchildren had by instinct always approached so carefully, and whom every\r\none found it necessary to conciliate!\r\n\r\n"Well, she\'s a nice child," he said, "a very nice child; and,"\r\nstraightening himself up to his fullest height, and looking so very\r\nhandsome, that his daughter could not conceal her admiration, "I shall\r\nalways take care of Phronsie Pepper, Marian!"\r\n\r\n"So I hope," said Mrs. Whitney; "and father, I do believe they\'ll repay\r\nyou; for I do think there\'s good blood there; these children have a look\r\nabout them that shows them worthy to be trusted."\r\n\r\n"So they have: so they have," assented Mr. King, and then the\r\nconversation dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHRONSIE\r\n\r\n\r\nPhronsie was toiling up and down the long, oak staircase the next\r\nmorning; slowly going from one step to the other, drawing each little\r\nfat foot into place laboriously, but with a pleased expression on her\r\nface that only gave some small idea of the rapture within. Up and down\r\nshe had been going for a long time, perfectly fascinated; seeming to\r\ncare for nothing else in the world but to work her way up to the top of\r\nthe long flight, only to turn and come down again. She had been going\r\non so for some time, till at last, Polly, who was afraid she would tire\r\nherself all out, sat down at the foot and begged and implored the little\r\ngirl, who had nearly reached the top, to stop and rest.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be tired to death, Phronsie!" she said, looking up at the small\r\nfigure on its toilsome journey. "Why you must have gone up a million\r\ntimes! Do sit down, pet; we\'re all going out riding, Phronsie, this\r\nafternoon; and you can\'t go if you\'re all tired out."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be tired, Polly," said Phronsie, turning around and looking at\r\nher, "do let me go just once more!"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Polly, who never could refuse her anything, "just once,\r\nPhronsie, and then you must stop."\r\n\r\nSo Phronsie kept on her way rejoicing, while Polly still sat on the\r\nlowest stair, and drummed impatiently on the stair above her, waiting\r\nfor her to get through.\r\n\r\nJappy came through the hall and found them thus. "Halloa, Polly!" he\r\nsaid, stopping suddenly; "what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Phronsie\'s been going so," said Polly, looking up at the little\r\nfigure above them, which had nearly reached the top in delight, "that I\r\ncan\'t stop her. She has really, Jappy, almost all the morning; you can\'t\r\nthink how crazy she is over it."\r\n\r\n"Is that so?" said Jasper, with a little laugh. "Hulloa, Phronsie, is\r\nit nice?" and he tossed a kiss to the little girl, and then sat down by\r\nPolly.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Phronsie, turning to come down, "it\'s the beyew-tiflest place\r\nI ever saw, Jasper! the very be-yew-tiflest!"\r\n\r\n"I wish she could have her picture painted," whispered Jasper,\r\nenthusiastically. "Look at her now, Polly, quick!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly, "isn\'t she sweet!"\r\n\r\n"Sweet!" said Jasper. "I should think she was!"\r\n\r\nThe sunlight through an oriel window fell on the childish face and\r\nfigure, glinting the yellow hair, and lighting up the radiant face, that\r\nyet had a tender, loving glance for the two who waited for her below.\r\nOne little foot was poised, just in the act of stepping down to the next\r\nlower stair, and the fat hand grasped the polished railing, expressive\r\nof just enough caution to make it truly childish. In after years Jasper\r\nnever thought of Phronsie without bringing up this picture on that April\r\nmorning, when Polly and he sat at the foot of the stairs, and looked up\r\nand saw it.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Jap?" called one of the boys; and then there was a clatter out\r\ninto the hall.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" and Van came to a full stop of amazement and\r\nstared at them.\r\n\r\n"Resting," said Jappy, concisely, "what do you want, Van?"\r\n\r\n"I want you," said Van, "we can\'t do anything without you, Jappy; you\r\nknow that."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Jasper, getting up. "Come on, Polly, we must go."\r\n\r\n"And Phronsie," said Van, anxiously, looking up to Phronsie, who had\r\nnearly reached them by this time, "we want her, too."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Polly, running up and meeting her to give her a hug;\r\n"I don\'t go unless she does."\r\n\r\n"Where are we going, Polly?" asked Phronsie, looking back longingly to\r\nher beloved stairs as she was borne off.\r\n\r\n"To the greenhouse, chick!" said Jasper, "to help Turner; and it\'ll be\r\ngood fun, won\'t it, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"What is a greenhouse?" asked the child, wonderingly. "All green,\r\nJasper?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear me," said Van, doubling up, "do you suppose she thinks it\'s\r\npainted green?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s green inside, Phronsie, dear," said Jasper, kindly, "and that\'s\r\nthe best of all."\r\n\r\nWhen Phronsie was really let loose in the greenhouse she thought it\r\ndecidedly best of all; and she went into nearly as much of a rapture as\r\nPolly did on her first visit to it.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments she was cooing and jumping among the plants, while old\r\nTurner, staid and particular as he was, laughed to see her go.\r\n\r\n"She\'s your sister, Miss Mary, ain\'t she?" at last he asked, as Phronsie\r\nbent lovingly over a little pot of heath, and just touched one little\r\nleaf carefully with her finger.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly, "but she don\'t look like me."\r\n\r\n"She is like you," said Turner, respectfully, "if she don\'t look like\r\nyou; and the flowers know it, too," he added, "and they\'ll love to see\r\nher coming, just as they do you."\r\n\r\nFor Polly had won the old gardener\'s heart completely by her passionate\r\nlove for flowers, and nearly every morning a little nosegay, fresh and\r\nbeautiful, came up to the house for "Miss Mary."\r\n\r\nAnd now nobody liked to think of the time, or to look back to it, when\r\nPhronsie hadn\'t been in the house. When the little feet went pattering\r\nthrough halls and over stairs, it seemed to bring sunshine and happiness\r\ninto every one\'s heart just to hear the sounds. Polly and the boys in\r\nthe schoolroom would look up from their books and nod away brightly to\r\neach other, and then fall to faster than ever on their lessons, to get\r\nthrough the quicker to be with her again.\r\n\r\nOne thing Phronsie always insisted on, and kept to it\r\npertinaciously--and that was to go into the drawing-room with Polly\r\nwhen she went to practice, and there, with one of her numerous family of\r\ndolls, to sit down quietly in some corner and wait till she got through.\r\n\r\nDay after day she did it, until Polly, who was worried to think how\r\ntedious it must be for her, would look around and say, "Oh, childie, do\r\nrun out and play."\r\n\r\n"I want to stay," Phronsie would beg in an injured tone; "please let me,\r\nPolly."\r\n\r\nSo Polly would jump and give her a kiss, and then, delighted to know\r\nthat she was there, would go at her practicing with twice the vigor and\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nBut Phronsie\'s chief occupation, at least when she wasn\'t with Polly,\r\nwas the entertainment and amusement of Mr. King. And never was she very\r\nlong absent from his side, which so pleased the old gentleman that\r\nhe could scarcely contain himself, as with a gravity befitting the\r\nimportance of her office, she would follow him around in a happy\r\ncontented way, that took with him immensely. And now-a-days, no one ever\r\nsaw the old gentleman going out of a morning, when Jasper was busy with\r\nhis lessons, without Phronsie by his side, and many people turned to see\r\nthe portly figure with the handsome head bent to catch the prattle of\r\na little sunny-haired child, who trotted along, clasping his hand\r\nconfidingly. And nearly all of them stopped to gaze the second time\r\nbefore they could convince themselves that it was really that queer,\r\nstiff old Mr. King of whom they had heard so much.\r\n\r\nAnd now the accumulation of dolls in the house became something\r\nalarming, for Mr. King, observing Phronsie\'s devotion to her family,\r\nthought there couldn\'t possibly be too many of them; so he scarcely\r\never went out without bringing home one at least to add to them, until\r\nPhronsie had such a remarkable collection as would have driven almost\r\nany other child nearly crazy with delight. She, however, regarded them\r\nsomething in the light of a grave responsibility, to be taken care of\r\ntenderly, to be watched over carefully as to just the right kind of\r\nbringing up; and to have small morals and manners taught in just the\r\nright way.\r\n\r\nPhronsie was playing in the corner of Mrs. Whitney\'s little boudoir,\r\nengaged in sending out invitations for an elaborate tea-party to be\r\ngiven by one of the dolls, when Polly rushed in with consternation in\r\nher tones, and dismay written all over her face.\r\n\r\n"What is it, dear?" asked Mrs. Whitney, looking up from her embroidery.\r\n\r\n"Why," said Polly, "how could I! I don\'t see--but I\'ve forgotten to\r\nwrite to mamsie to-day; it\'s Wednesday, you know, and there\'s Monsieur\r\ncoming." And poor Polly looked out in despair to see the lively little\r\nmusic teacher advancing towards the house at an alarming rate of speed.\r\n\r\n"That is because you were helping Van so long last evening over his\r\nlessons," said Mrs. Whitney; "I am so sorry."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," cried Polly honestly, "I had plenty of time--but I forgot\r\n\'twas mamsie\'s day. What will she do!"\r\n\r\n"You will have to let it go now till the afternoon, dear; there\'s no\r\nother way; it can go in the early morning mail."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," sighed Polly, "I suppose I must." And she went down to meet\r\nMonsieur with a very distressed little heart.\r\n\r\nPhronsie laid down the note of invitation she was scribbling, and\r\nstopped to think; and a moment or two after, at a summons from a caller,\r\nMrs. Whitney left the room.\r\n\r\n"I know I ought to," said Phronsie to herself and the dolls, "yes, I\r\nknow I had; mamsie will feel, oh! so bad, when she don\'t get Polly\'s\r\nletter; and I know the way, I do, truly."\r\n\r\nShe got up and went to the window, where she thought a minute; and then,\r\ncoming back, she took up her little stubby pencil, and bending over a\r\nsmall bit of paper, she commenced to trace with laborious efforts and\r\nmuch hard breathing, some very queer hieroglyphics that to her seemed to\r\nbe admirable, as at last she held them up with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," she said then, getting up and bowing to the dolls who sat\r\namong the interrupted invitations, "I won\'t be gone but a little bit of\r\none minute," and she went out determinedly and shut the door.\r\n\r\nNobody saw the little figure going down the carriage drive, so of course\r\nnobody could stop her. When Phronsie got to the gateway she looked up\r\nand down the street carefully, either way.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, at last, "it was down here, I\'m very sure, I went with\r\ngrandpa," and immediately turned down the wrong way, and went on and\r\non, grasping carefully her small, and by this time rather soiled bit of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nAt last she reached the business streets; and although she didn\'t come\r\nto the Post Office, she comforted herself by the thought--"it must be\r\ncoming soon. I guess it\'s round this corner."\r\n\r\nShe kept turning corner after corner, until, at last, a little anxious\r\nfeeling began to tug at her heart; and she began to think--"I wish I\r\ncould see Polly--" And now, she had all she could do to get out of\r\nthe way of the crowds of people who were pouring up and down the\r\nthoroughfare. Everybody jostled against her, and gave her a push. "Oh\r\ndear!" thought Phronsie, "there\'s such a many big people!" and then\r\nthere was no time for anything else but to stumble in and out, to\r\nkeep from being crushed completely beneath their feet. At last, an old\r\nhuckster woman, in passing along, knocked off her bonnet with the end\r\nof her big basket, which flew around and struck Phronsie\'s head. Not\r\nstopping to look into the piteous brown eyes, she strode on without a\r\nword. Phronsie turned in perfect despair to go down a street that looked\r\nas if there might be room enough for her in it. Thoroughly frightened,\r\nshe plunged over the crossing, to reach it!\r\n\r\n"Look out!" cried a ringing voice. "Stop!"\r\n\r\n"The little girl\'ll be killed!" said others with bated breath, as a\r\npowerful pair of horses whose driver could not pull them up in time,\r\ndashed along just in front of her! With one cry, Phronsie sprang between\r\ntheir feet, and reached the opposite curbstone in safety!\r\n\r\nThe plunge brought her up against a knot of gentlemen who were standing\r\ntalking on the corner.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this!" asked one, whose back being next to the street, hadn\'t\r\nseen the commotion, as the small object dashed into their midst, and\r\nfell up against him.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you see that narrow escape?" asked a second, whose face had\r\npaled in witnessing it. "This little girl was nearly killed a moment\r\nago--careless driving enough!" And he put out his hand to catch the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n"Bless me!" cried a third, whirling around suddenly, "Bless me! you\r\ndon\'t say so! why--" With a small cry, but gladsome and distinct in its\r\nutterance, Phronsie gave one look--"Oh, grandpa!" was all she could say.\r\n\r\n"Oh! where--" Mr. King couldn\'t possibly have uttered another word, for\r\nthen his breath gave out entirely, as he caught the small figure.\r\n\r\n"I went to the Post Office," said the child, clinging to him in delight,\r\nher tangled hair waving over the little white face, into which a faint\r\npink color was quickly coming back. "Only it wouldn\'t come; and I walked\r\nand walked--where is it, grandpa?" And Phronsie gazed up anxiously into\r\nthe old gentleman\'s face.\r\n\r\n"She went to the Post Office!" turning around on the others fiercely,\r\nas if they had contradicted him--"Why, my child, what were you going to\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\n"Mamsie\'s letter," said Phronsie, holding up for inspection the precious\r\nbit, which by this time, was decidedly forlorn, "Polly couldn\'t write;\r\nand Mamsie\'d feel so bad not to get one--she would really" said the\r\nchild, shaking her head very soberly, "for Polly said so."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve been--oh! I can\'t think of it," said Mr. King, tenderly\r\ntaking her up on his shoulder, "well, we must get home now, or I don\'t\r\nknow what Polly will do!" And without stopping to say a word to his\r\nfriends, he hailed a passing carriage, and putting Phronsie in, he\r\ncommanded the driver to get them as quickly as possible to their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they were home. Mr. King pushed into the house with his\r\nburden. "Don\'t anybody know," he burst out, puffing up the stairs, and\r\nscolding furiously at every step, "enough to take better care of this\r\nchild, than to have such goings on!"\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, father?" asked Mrs. Whitney, coming up the stairs,\r\nafter him. "What has happened out of the way?"\r\n\r\n"Out of the way!" roared the old gentleman, irascibly, "well, if you\r\nwant Phronsie racing off to the Post Office by herself, and nearly\r\ngetting killed, poor child! yes, Marian, I say nearly killed!" he\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" gasped Mrs. Whitney.\r\n\r\n"Why, where have you been?" asked the old gentleman, who wouldn\'t let\r\nPhronsie get down out of his arms, under any circumstances; so there she\r\nlay, poking up her head like a little bird, and trying to say she wasn\'t\r\nin the least hurt, "where\'s everybody been not to know she\'d gone?" he\r\nexclaimed, "where\'s Polly--and Jasper--and all of \'em?"\r\n\r\n"Polly\'s taking her music lesson," said Mrs. Whitney. "Oh, Phronsie\r\ndarling!" and she bent over the child in her father\'s arms, and nearly\r\nsmothered her with kisses.\r\n\r\n"Twas a naughty horse," said Phronsie, sitting up straight and looking\r\nat her, "or I should have found the Post Office; and I lost off my\r\nbonnet, too," she added, for the first time realizing her loss, putting\r\nher hand to her head; "a bad old woman knocked it off with a basket--and\r\nnow mamsie won\'t get her letter!" and she waved the bit, which she still\r\ngrasped firmly between her thumb and finger, sadly towards Mrs. Whitney.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," groaned that lady, "how could we talk before her! But who\r\nwould have thought it! Darling," and she took the little girl from her\r\nfather\'s arms, who at last let her go, "don\'t think of your mamma\'s\r\nletter; we\'ll tell her how it was," and she sat down in the first chair\r\nthat she could reach; while Phronsie put her tumbled little head down on\r\nthe kind shoulder and gave a weary little sigh.\r\n\r\n"It was so long," she said, "and my shoes hurt," and she thrust out the\r\ndusty little boots, that spoke pathetically of the long and unaccustomed\r\ntramp.\r\n\r\n"Poor little lamb!" said Mr. King, getting down to unbutton them. "What\r\na shame!" he mumbled pulling off half of the buttons in his frantic\r\nendeavors to get them off quickly.\r\n\r\nBut Phronsie never heard the last of his observations, for in a minute\r\nshe was fast asleep. The tangled hair fell off from the tired little\r\nface; the breathing came peaceful and regular, and with her little hand\r\nfast clasped in Mrs. Whitney\'s she slept on and on.\r\n\r\nPolly came flying up-stairs, two or three at a time, and humming a scrap\r\nof her last piece that she had just conquered.\r\n\r\n"Phronsie," she called, with a merry little laugh, "where--"\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Mr. King, warningly, and then just because he couldn\'t\r\nexplain there without waking Phronsie up, he took hold of Polly\'s two\r\nshoulders and marched her into the next room, where he carefully closed\r\nthe door, and told her the whole thing, using his own discretion about\r\nthe very narrow escape she had passed through. He told enough, however,\r\nfor Polly to see what had been so near them; and she stood there so\r\nquietly, alternately paling and flushing as he proceeded, till at last,\r\nwhen he finished, Mr. King was frightened almost to death at the sight\r\nof her face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, goodness me, Polly!" he said, striding up to her, and then fumbling\r\naround on the table to find a glass of water, "you are not going to\r\nfaint, are you? Phronsie\'s all well now, she isn\'t hurt in the least, I\r\nassure you; I assure you--where is a glass of water! Marian ought to see\r\nthat there\'s some here--that stupid Jane!" and in utter bewilderment\r\nhe was fussing here and there, knocking down so many things in general,\r\nthat the noise soon brought Polly to, with a little gasp.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t mind me, dear Mr. King--I\'m--all well."\r\n\r\n"So you are," said the old gentleman, setting up a toilet bottle that he\r\nhad knocked over, "so you are; I didn\'t think you\'d go and tumble over,\r\nPolly, I really didn\'t," and he beamed admiringly down on her.\r\n\r\nAnd then Polly crept away to Mrs. Whitney\'s side where she threw herself\r\ndown on the floor, to watch the little sleeping figure. Her hand was\r\ngathered up, into the kind one that held Phronsie\'s; and there they\r\nwatched and watched and waited.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Phronsie, suddenly, turning over with a little sigh,\r\nand bobbing up her head to look at Polly; "I\'m so hungry! I haven\'t had\r\nanything to eat in ever an\' ever so long, Polly!" and she gazed at her\r\nwith a very injured countenance.\r\n\r\n"So you must be," said Mrs. Whitney, kissing the flushed little face.\r\n"Polly must ring the bell for Jane to bring this little bird some\r\ncrumbs.\r\n\r\n"Can I have a great many?" asked Phronsie, lifting her eyes, with the\r\ndewy look of sleep still lingering in them, "as many as two birdies?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear," said Mrs. Whitney, laughing; "I think as many as three\r\nlittle birdies could eat, Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Phronsie, and leaned back satisfied, while Polly gave the\r\norder, which was presently followed by Jane with a well-filled tray.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Jappy, when he heard the account of the adventure, "I say\r\nthat letter ought to go to your mother, Polly."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Polly, "it would scare mamsie most to death, Jappy!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell her the whole," said Jasper, quickly, "I didn\'t mean\r\nthat--about the horses and all that--but only enough to let her see how\r\nPhronsie tried to get it to her."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m going to write to your brother Joel," said Van, drawing up to\r\nthe library table; "I\'ll scare him, Polly, I guess; he won\'t tell your\r\nmother."\r\n\r\n"Your crow-tracks\'ll scare him enough without anything else," said\r\nPercy, pleasantly, who really could write very nicely, while Polly broke\r\nout in an agony:\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Van, you mustn\'t! you mustn\'t!"\r\n\r\n"If Van does," said Jasper, decidedly, "it\'ll be the last time he\'ll\r\nwrite to the \'brown house,\' I can tell him; and besides, he\'ll go to\r\nCoventry." This had the desired effect.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s all write," said Polly.\r\n\r\nSo a space on the table was cleared, and the children gathered around\r\nit, when there was great scratching of pens, and clearing of ideas;\r\nwhich presently resulted in a respectable budget of letters, into which\r\nPhronsie\'s was lovingly tucked in the centre; and then they all filed\r\nout to put it into the letterbox in the hall, for Thomas to mail with\r\nthe rest in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING READY FOR MAMSIE AND THE BOYS\r\n\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll tell you, Marian, what I am going to do."\r\n\r\nMr. King\'s voice was pitched on a higher key than usual; and extreme\r\ndetermination was expressed in every line of his face. He had met Mrs.\r\nWhitney at the foot of the staircase, dressed for paying visits. "Oh,\r\nare you going out?" he said, glancing impatiently at her attire. "And\r\nI\'d just started to speak to you on a matter of great importance! Of the\r\ngreatest importance indeed!" he repeated irritably, as he stood with one\r\ngloved hand resting on the balustrade.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s no matter, father," she replied pleasantly; "if it\'s really\r\nimportant, I can postpone going for another day, and--"\r\n\r\n"Really important!" repeated the old gentleman irascibly. "Haven\'t I\r\njust told you it\'s of the greatest importance? There\'s no time to be\r\nlost; and with my state of health too, it\'s of the utmost consequence\r\nthat I shouldn\'t be troubled. It\'s very bad for me; I should think you\r\nwould realize that, Marian."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell Thomas to take the carriage directly back," said Mrs. Whitney\r\nstepping to the door. "Or stay, father; I\'ll just run up and send the\r\nchildren out for a little drive. The horses ought to be used too, you\r\nknow," she said lightly, preparing to run up to carry out the changed\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n"Never mind that now," said Mr. King abruptly. "I want you to give me\r\nyour attention directly." And walking towards the library door, getting\r\na fresh accession of impatience with every step, he beckoned her to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nBut his progress was somewhat impeded by little Dick--or rather, little\r\nDick and Prince, who were standing at the top of the stairs to see Mrs.\r\nWhitney off. When he saw his mother retrace her steps, supposing her\r\nyielding to the urgent entreaties that he was sending after her to stay\r\nat home, the child suddenly changed his "Good-byes" to vociferous howls\r\nof delight, and speedily began to plunge down the stairs to welcome her.\r\n\r\nBut the staircase was long, and little Dick was in a hurry, and besides,\r\nPrince was in the way. The consequence was, nobody knew just how, that\r\na bumping noise struck into the conversation that made the two below in\r\nthe hall look up quickly, to see the child and dog come rolling over the\r\nstairs at a rapid rate.\r\n\r\n"Zounds!" cried the old gentleman. "Here, Thomas, Thomas!" But as that\r\nindividual was waiting patiently outside the door on the carriage box,\r\nthere was small hope of his being in time to catch the boy, who was\r\nalready in his mother\'s arms, not quite clear by the suddenness of the\r\nwhole thing, as to how he came there.\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! Dicky\'s hurt!" cried somebody up above--followed by every\r\none within hearing distance, and all came rushing to the spot to ask a\r\nthousand questions all in the same minute.\r\n\r\nThere sat Mrs. Whitney in one of the big carved chairs, with little Dick\r\nin her lap, and Prince walking gravely around and around him with the\r\ngreatest expression of concern on his noble face. Mr. King was storming\r\nup and down, and calling on everybody to bring a "bowl of water, and\r\nsome brown paper; and be quick!" interpolated with showers of blame on\r\nPrince for sitting on the stairs, and tripping people up! while Dick\r\nmeanwhile was laughing and chatting, and enjoying the distinction of\r\nmaking so many people run, and of otherwise being the object of so much\r\nattention!\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he was sitting on the stairs, father," said Jasper, who,\r\nwhen he saw that Dicky was really unhurt, began to vindicate his dog.\r\n"He never does that; do you Sir?" he said patting the head that was\r\nlifted up to him, as if to be defended.\r\n\r\n"And I expect we shall all be killed some day, Jasper," said Mr. King,\r\nwarming with his subject; and forgetting all about the brown paper and\r\nwater which he had ordered, and which was now waiting for him at his\r\nelbow, "just by that creature."\r\n\r\n"He\'s the noblest--" began Jasper, throwing his arms around his neck; an\r\nexample which was immediately followed by the Whitney boys, and the two\r\nlittle Peppers. When Dick saw this, he began to struggle to get down to\r\nadd himself to the number.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the brown paper?" began Mr. King, seeing this and whirling\r\naround suddenly. "Hasn\'t any body brought it yet?"\r\n\r\n"Here \'tis sir," said Jane, handing him a generous supply. "Oh, I don\'t\r\nwant to," cried little Dick in dismay, seeing his grandfather advance\r\nwith an enormous piece of paper, which previously wet in the bowl of\r\nwater, was now unpleasantly clammy and wet--"oh, no, I don\'t want to be\r\nall stuck up with old horrid wet paper!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, dear!" said his mamma, soothingly. "Grandpapa wants to put it\r\non--there--" as Mr. King dropped it scientifically on his head, and then\r\nproceeded to paste another one over his left eye.\r\n\r\n"And I hope they\'ll all drop off," cried Dick, savagely, shaking his\r\nhead to facilitate matters. "Yes, I do, every single one of \'em!" he\r\nadded, with an expression that seen under the brown bits was anything\r\nbut benign.\r\n\r\n"Was Prince on the stairs, Dick?" asked Jasper, coming up and peering\r\nunder his several adornments. "Tell us how you fell!"\r\n\r\n"No," said little Dick, crossly, and giving his head another shake.\r\n"He was up in the hall--oh, dear, I want to get down," and he began to\r\nstretch his legs and to struggle with so much energy, that two or three\r\npieces fell off, and landed on the floor to his intense delight.\r\n\r\n"And how did you fall then?" said Jasper, perseveringly. "Can\'t you\r\nremember, Dicky, boy?"\r\n\r\n"I pushed Princey," said Dick, feeling, with freedom from some of\r\nhis encumbrances, more disposed for conversation, "and made him go\r\nahead--and then I fell on top of him--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"I guess Prince has saved him, father," cried Jasper, turning around\r\nwith eyes full of pride and love on the dog, who was trying as hard as\r\nhe could to tell all the children how much he enjoyed their caresses.\r\n\r\nAnd so it all came about that the consultation so summarily interrupted\r\nwas never held. For, as Mrs. Whitney was about retiring that evening,\r\nMr. King rapped at her door, on his way to bed.\r\n\r\n"Oh," he said popping in his head, in response to her invitation to come\r\nin, "it\'s nothing--only I thought I\'d just tell you a word or two about\r\nwhat I\'ve decided to do."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean what you wanted to see me about this afternoon?" asked Mrs.\r\nWhitney, who hadn\'t thought of it since. "Do come in, father."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no consequence," said the old gentleman; "no consequence at all,"\r\nhe repeated, waving his hand emphatically, "because I\'ve made up my mind\r\nand arranged all my plans--it\'s only about the Peppers--"\r\n\r\n"The Peppers?" repeated Mrs. Whitney.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Well, the fact of it is, I\'m going to have them here for a\r\nvisit--the whole of them, you understand; that\'s all there is to it.\r\nAnd I shall go down to see about all the arrangements--Jasper and I--day\r\nafter to-morrow," said the old gentleman, as if he owned the whole\r\nPepper family inclusive, and was the only responsible person to be\r\nconsulted about their movements.\r\n\r\n"Will they come?" asked Mrs. Whitney, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"Come? of course," said Mr. King, sharply, "there isn\'t any other way;\r\nor else Mrs. Pepper will be sending for her children--and of course you\r\nknow, Marian, we couldn\'t allow that--well, that\'s all; so good night,"\r\nand the door closed on his retreating footsteps.\r\n\r\nAnd so Polly and Phronsie soon knew that mamsie and the boys were to\r\nbe invited! And then the grand house, big as it was, didn\'t seem large\r\nenough to contain them.\r\n\r\n"I declare," said Jasper, next day, when they had been laughing and\r\nplanning till they were all as merry as grigs, "if this old dungeon\r\ndon\'t begin to seem a little like \'the little brown house,\' Polly."\r\n\r\n"Twon\'t," answered Polly, hopping around on one toe, followed by\r\nPhronsie, "till mamsie and the boys get here, Jasper King!"\r\n\r\n"Well, they\'ll be here soon," said Jappy, pleased at Polly\'s exultation\r\nover it, "for we\'re going to-morrow to do the inviting."\r\n\r\n"And Polly\'s to write a note to slip into Marian\'s," said Mr. King,\r\nputting his head in at the door. "And if you want your mother to come,\r\nchild, why, you\'d better mention it as strong as you can."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to write," said Phronsie, pulling up after a prolonged skip,\r\nall out of breath. "I\'m going to write, and beg mamsie dear. Then she\'ll\r\ncome, I guess."\r\n\r\n"I guess she will," said Mr. King, looking at her. "You go on, Phronsie,\r\nand write; and that letter shall go straight in my coat pocket alone by\r\nitself."\r\n\r\n"Shall it?" asked Phronsie, coming up to him, "and nobody will take it\r\nout till you give it to mamsie?"\r\n\r\n"No, nobody shall touch it," said the old gentleman, stooping to kiss\r\nthe upturned face, "till I put it into her own hand."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Phronsie, in the greatest satisfaction, "I\'m going to write\r\nthis very one minute!" and she marched away to carry her resolve into\r\nimmediate execution.\r\n\r\nBefore they got through they had quite a bundle of invitations and\r\npleadings; for each of the three boys insisted on doing his part, so\r\nthat when they were finally done up in an enormous envelope and put into\r\nMr. King\'s hands, he told them with a laugh that there was no use for\r\nJappy and himself to go, as those were strong enough to win almost\r\nanybody\'s consent.\r\n\r\nHowever, the next morning they set off, happy in their hopes, and\r\nbearing the countless messages, which the children would come up every\r\nnow and then to intrust to them, declaring that they had forgotten to\r\nput them in the letters.\r\n\r\n"You\'d had to have had an express wagon to carry the letters if you had\r\nput them all in," at last cried Jasper. "You\'ve given us a bushel of\r\nthings to remember."\r\n\r\n"And oh! don\'t forget to ask Ben to bring Cherry," cried Polly, the last\r\nminute as they were driving off although she had put it in her letter at\r\nleast a dozen times; "and oh, dear! of course the flowers can\'t come."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got plenty here," said Jasper. "You would not know what to do\r\nwith them, Polly."\r\n\r\n"Well, I do wish mamsie would give some to kind Mrs. Henderson, then,"\r\nsaid Polly, on the steps, clasping her hands anxiously, while Jasper\r\ntold Thomas to wait till he heard the rest of the message, "and to\r\ngrandma--you know Grandma Bascom; she was so good to us," she said\r\nimpulsively. "And, oh! don\'t let her forget to carry some to dear, dear\r\nDr. Fisher; and don\'t forget to give him our love, Jappy; don\'t forget\r\nthat!" and Polly ran down the steps to the carriage door, where she\r\ngazed up imploringly to the boy\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I guess I won\'t," cried Jasper, "when I think how he saved your eyes,\r\nPolly! He\'s the best fellow I know!" he finished in an impulsive burst.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t let mamsie forget to carry some in to good old Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBeebe in town--where Phronsie got her shoes, you know; that is, if\r\nmamsie can," she added, remembering how very busy her mother would be.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll carry them myself," said Jasper; "we\'re going to stay over till\r\nthe next day, you know."\r\n\r\n"O!" cried Polly, radiant as a rose, "will you, really, Jappy? you\'re so\r\ngood!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will," said Jasper, "everything you want done, Polly; anything\r\nelse?" he asked, quickly, as Mr. King, impatient to be off, showed\r\nunmistakable symptoms of hurrying up Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Polly, "only do look at the little brown house, Jasper,\r\nas much as you can," and Polly left the rest unfinished. Jasper seemed\r\nto understand, however, for he smiled brightly as he said, looking into\r\nthe brown eyes, "I\'ll do it all, Polly; every single thing." And then\r\nthey were off.\r\n\r\nMamsie and the boys! could Polly ever wait till the next afternoon that\r\nwould bring the decision?\r\n\r\nLong before it was possibly time for the carriage to come back from the\r\ndepot, Polly, with Phronsie and the three boys, who, improving Jasper\'s\r\nabsence, had waited upon her with the grace and persistence of cavaliers\r\nof the olden time, were drawn up at the old stone gateway.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Van with an impatient fling; "they never will come!"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t they, Polly?" asked Phronsie, anxiously, and standing quite\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, yes," said Polly, with a little laugh, "Van only means they\'ll\r\nbe a good while, Phronsie. They\'re sure to come some time."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Phronsie, quite relieved; and she commenced her capering\r\nagain in extreme enjoyment.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going," said little Dick, "to run down and meet them." Accordingly\r\noff he went, and was immediately followed by Percy, who started with the\r\nlaudable desire of bringing him back; but finding it so very enjoyable,\r\nhe stayed himself and frolicked with Dick, till the others, hearing the\r\nfun, all took hold of hands and flew off to join them.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Polly, when they recovered their breath a little, "let\'s all\r\nturn our backs to the road; and the minute we hear the carriage we must\r\nwhirl round; and the one who sees \'em first can ask first \'Is mamsie\r\ncoming?"\r\n\r\n"All right," cried the boys.\r\n\r\n"Turn round, Dick," said Percy, with a little shove, for Dick was\r\nstaring with all his might right down the road. And so they all flew\r\naround till they looked like five statues set up to grace the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n"Suppose a big dog should come," suggested Van, pleasantly, "and snap at\r\nour backs!"\r\n\r\nAt this little Dick gave a small howl, and turned around in a fright.\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t any dog coming," said Polly. "What does make you say such\r\nawful things, Van?"\r\n\r\n"I hear a noise," said Phronsie; and so they all whirled around in\r\nexpectation. But it proved to be only a market wagon coming at a furious\r\npace down the road, with somebody\'s belated dinner. So they all had to\r\nwhirl back again as before. The consequence was that when the carriage\r\ndid come, nobody heard it.\r\n\r\nJasper, looking out, was considerably astonished to see, drawn up in\r\nsolemn array with their backs to the road, five children, who stood as\r\nif completely petrified.\r\n\r\n"What in the world!" he began, and called to Thomas to stop, whose\r\nenergetic "Whoa!" reaching the ears of the frozen line, caused it to\r\nbreak ranks, and spring into life at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\n"Oh, is she coming Jappy? Is she? Is she?" they all screamed together,\r\nswarming up to the carriage door, and over the wheels.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jasper looking at Polly.\r\n\r\nAt that, Phronsie made a little cheese and sat right down on the\r\npavement in an ecstasy.\r\n\r\n"Get in here, all of you;" said Jasper merrily; "help Polly in first.\r\nFor shame Dick! don\'t scramble so."\r\n\r\n"Dick always shoves," said Percy, escorting Polly up with quite an air.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t either," said Dick; "you pushed me awful, just a little while\r\nago," he added indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Do say awfully," corrected Van, crowding up to get in. "You leave off\r\nyour lys so," he finished critically.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about any lees," said little Dick, who, usually\r\nso good natured, was now thoroughly out of temper; "I want to get in\r\nand go home," and he showed evident symptoms of breaking into a perfect\r\nroar.\r\n\r\n"There," said Polly, lilting him up, "there he goes! now--one, two,\r\nthree!" and little Dick was spun in so merrily that the tears changed\r\ninto a happy laugh.\r\n\r\n"Now then, bundle in, all the rest of you," put in Mr. King, who seemed\r\nto be in the best of spirits. "That\'s it; go on, Thomas!"\r\n\r\n"When are they coming?" Polly found time to ask in the general jumble.\r\n\r\n"In three weeks from to-morrow," said Jasper. "And everything\'s all\r\nright, Polly! and the whole of them, Cherry and all, will be here then!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Polly.\r\n\r\n"Here we are!" cried Van, jumping out almost before the carriage door\r\nwas open. "Mamma; mamma," he shouted to Mrs. Whitney in the doorway,\r\n"the Peppers are coming, and the little brown house too!--everything and\r\neverybody!"\r\n\r\n"They are!" said Percy, as wild as his brother; "and everything\'s just\r\nsplendid! Jappy said so."\r\n\r\n"Everything\'s coming," said little Dick, tumbling up the steps--"and the\r\nbird--and--and--"\r\n\r\n"And mamsie!" finished Phronsie, impatient to add her part--while Polly\r\ndidn\'t say anything--only looked.\r\n\r\nThree weeks! "I can\'t wait!" thought Polly at first, in counting\r\nover the many hours before the happy day would come. But on Jasper\'s\r\nsuggesting that they should all do something to get ready for the\r\nvisitors, and have a general trimming up with vines and flowers\r\nbeside--the time passed away much more rapidly than was feared.\r\n\r\nPolly chose a new and more difficult piece of music to learn to surprise\r\nmamsie. Phronsie had aspired to an elaborate pin-cushion, that was\r\nnearly done, made of bits of worsted and canvas, over whose surface\r\nshe had wandered according to her own sweet will, in a way charming to\r\nbehold.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to do," said Van in despair, "cause I don\'t know what\r\nshe\'d like."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you draw her a little picture?" asked Polly. "She\'d like that."\r\n\r\n"Does she like pictures?" asked Van with the greatest interest.\r\n\r\n"Yes indeed!" said Polly, "I guess you\'d think so if you could see her!"\r\n\r\n"I know what I shall do," with a dignified air said Percy, who couldn\'t\r\ndraw, and therefore looked down on all Van\'s attempts with the greatest\r\nscorn. "And it won\'t be any old pictures either," he added.\r\n\r\n"What is it, old fellow?" asked Jasper, "tell on, now, your grand plan."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not going to tell," said Percy, with the greatest secrecy,\r\n"until the very day."\r\n\r\n"What will you do, sir?" asked Jasper, pulling one of Dick\'s ears, who\r\nstood waiting to speak, as if his mind was made up, and wouldn\'t be\r\nchanged for anyone!\r\n\r\n"I shall give Ben one of my kitties--the littlest and the best!" he\r\nsaid, with heroic self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA perfect shout greeted this announcement.\r\n\r\n"Fancy Ben going round with one of those awful little things," whispered\r\nJappy to Polly, who shook at the very thought.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t laugh! oh, it\'s dreadful to laugh at him, Jappy," she said, when\r\nshe could get voice enough.\r\n\r\n"No, I sha\'n\'t tell," said Percy, when the fun had subsided; who,\r\nfinding that no one teased him to divulge his wonderful plan, kept\r\ntrying to harrow up their feelings by parading it.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t then," screamed Van, who was nearly dying to know. "I don\'t\r\nbelieve it\'s so very dreadful much, anyway."\r\n\r\n"What\'s yours, Jappy?" asked Polly, "I know yours will be just\r\nsplendid."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, it isn\'t," said Jasper, smiling brightly, "but as I didn\'t know\r\nwhat better I could do, I\'m going to get a little stand, and then beg\r\nsome flowers of Turner to fill it, and--"\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s mine!" screamed Percy, in the greatest disappointment.\r\n"That\'s just what I was going to do!"\r\n\r\n"Hoh, hoh!" shouted Van; "I thought you wouldn\'t tell, Mr. Percy! hoh,\r\nhoh!"\r\n\r\n"Hoh, hoh!" echoed Dick.\r\n\r\n"Hush," said Jappy. "Why, Percy, I didn\'t know as you had thought of\r\nthat," he said kindly. "Well, then, you do it, and I\'ll take something\r\nelse. I don\'t care as long as Mrs. Pepper gets \'em."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t exactly mean that," began Percy; "mine was roots and little\r\nflowers growing."\r\n\r\n"He means what he gets in the woods," said Polly, explaining; "don\'t\r\nyou, Percy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the boy. "And then I was going to put stones and things in\r\namong them to make them look pretty."\r\n\r\n"And they will," cried Jasper. "Go ahead, Percy, they\'ll look real\r\npretty, and then Turner will give you some flowers for the stand, I\r\nknow; I\'ll ask him to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Will you?" cried Percy, "that\'ll be fine!"\r\n\r\n"Mine is the best," said Van, just at this juncture; but it was said a\r\nlittle anxiously, as he saw how things were prospering with Percy; "for\r\nmy flowers in the picture will always be there, and your old roots and\r\nthings will die."\r\n\r\n"What will yours be, then, Jappy?" asked Polly very soberly. "The stand\r\nof flowers would have been just lovely! and you do fix them so nice,"\r\nshe added sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll find something else," said Jappy, cheerfully, who had quite\r\nset his heart on giving the flowers. "Let me see--I might carve her a\r\nbracket."\r\n\r\n"Do," cried Polly, clapping her hands enthusiastically. "And do carve a\r\nlittle bird, like the one you did on your father\'s."\r\n\r\n"I will," said Jasper, "just exactly like it. Now, we\'ve got something\r\nto do, before we welcome the \'little brown house\' people--so let\'s fly\r\nat it, and the time won\'t seem so long."\r\n\r\nAnd at last the day came when they could all say--To-morrow they\'ll be\r\nhere!\r\n\r\nWell, the vines were all up; and pots of lovely climbing ferns, and all\r\nmanner of pretty green things had been arranged and re-arranged a dozen\r\ntimes till everything was pronounced perfect; and a big green "Welcome"\r\nover the library door, made of laurel leaves, by the patient fingers\r\nof all the children, stared down into their admiring eyes as much as to\r\nsay, "I\'ll do my part!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," said Phronsie, when evening came, and the children were, as\r\nusual, assembled on the rug before the fire, their tongues running wild\r\nwith anticipation and excitement, "I don\'t mean to go to bed at all,\r\nPolly; I don\'t truly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you do," said Polly laughing; "then you\'ll be all fresh and\r\nrested to see mammy when she does come."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Phronsie, shaking her head soberly, and speaking in an\r\ninjured tone. "I\'m not one bit tired, Polly; not one bit."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t go yet, Phronsie," said Polly. "You can sit up half an hour\r\nyet, if you want to."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want to go to bed at all," said the child anxiously, "for\r\nthen I may be asleep when mamsie comes, Polly."\r\n\r\n"She\'s afraid she won\'t wake up," said Percy, laughing. "Oh, there\'ll be\r\noceans of time before they come, Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"What is oceans," asked Phronsie, coming up and looking at him,\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\n"He means mamsie won\'t get here till afternoon," said Polly, catching\r\nher up and kissing her; "then I guess you\'ll be awake, Phronsie, pet."\r\n\r\nSo Phronsie allowed herself to be persuaded, at the proper time, to be\r\ncarried off and inducted into her little nightgown. And when Polly went\r\nup to bed, she found the little pin-cushion, with its hieroglyphics,\r\nthat she had insisted on taking to bed with her, still tightly grasped\r\nin the little fat hand.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll roll over and muss it," thought Polly; "and then she\'ll feel bad\r\nin the morning. I guess I\'d better lay it on the bureau."\r\n\r\nSo she drew it carefully away, without awaking the little sleeper, and\r\nplaced it where she knew Phronsie\'s eyes would rest on it the first\r\nthing in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt was going on towards the middle of the night when Phronsie, whose\r\nexciting dreams of mamsie and the boys wouldn\'t let her rest quietly,\r\nwoke up; and in the very first flash she thought of her cushion.\r\n\r\n"Why, where--" she said, in the softest little tones, only half awake,\r\n"why, Polly, where is it?" and she began to feel all around her pillow\r\nto see if it had fallen down there.\r\n\r\nBut Polly\'s brown head with its crowd of anticipations and busy\r\nplans was away off in dreamland, and she breathed on and on perfectly\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\n"I guess I better," said Phronsie to herself, now thoroughly awake, and\r\nsitting up in bed, "not wake her up. Poor Polly\'s tired; I can find it\r\nmyself, I know I can."\r\n\r\nSo she slipped out of bed, and prowling around on the floor, felt all\r\nabout for the little cushion.\r\n\r\n"\'Tisn\'t here, oh, no, it isn\'t," she sighed at last, and getting up,\r\nshe stood still a moment, lost in thought. "Maybe Jane\'s put it out\r\nin the hall," she said, as a bright thought struck her. "I can get it\r\nthere," and out she pattered over the soft carpet to the table at the\r\nend of the long hall, where Jane often placed the children\'s playthings\r\nover night. As she was coming back after her fruitless search, she\r\nstopped to peep over the balustrade down the fascinating flight of\r\nstairs, now so long and dark. Just then a little faint ray of light shot\r\nup from below, and met her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Why!" she said in gentle surprise, "they\'re all down-stairs! I guess\r\nthey\'re making something for mamsie--I\'m going to see."\r\n\r\nSo, carefully picking her way over the stairs with her little bare feet,\r\nand holding on to the balustrade at every step, she went slowly down,\r\nguided by the light, which, as she neared the bottom of the flight, she\r\nsaw came from the library door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, isn\'t it funny!" and she gave a little happy laugh. "They won\'t\r\nknow I\'m comin\'!" and now the soft little feet went pattering over the\r\nthick carpet, until she stood just within the door. There she stopped\r\nperfectly still.\r\n\r\nTwo dark figures, big and powerful, were bending over something that\r\nPhronsie couldn\'t see, between the two big windows. A lantern on the\r\nfloor flung its rays over them as they were busily occupied; and the\r\nfirelight from the dying coals made the whole stand out distinctly to\r\nthe gaze of the motionless little figure.\r\n\r\n"Why! what are you doing with my grandpa\'s things?"\r\n\r\nThe soft, clear notes fell like a thunderbolt upon the men. With a start\r\nthey brought themselves up, and stared--only to see a little white-robed\r\nfigure, with its astonished eyes uplifted with childlike, earnest gaze,\r\nas she waited for her answer.\r\n\r\nFor an instant they were powerless to move; and stood as if frozen to\r\nthe spot, till Phronsie, moving one step forward, piped forth:\r\n\r\n"Naughty men, to touch my dear grandpa\'s things!"\r\n\r\nWith a smothered cry one of them started forward with arm uplifted; but\r\nthe other sprang like a cat and intercepted the blow.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" was all he said. A noise above the stairs--a rushing sound\r\nthrough the hall! Something will save Phronsie, for the household is\r\naroused! The two men sprang through the window, having no time to catch\r\nthe lantern or their tools, as Polly, followed by one and another,\r\nrushed in and surrounded the child.\r\n\r\n"What!" gasped Polly, and got no further.\r\n\r\n"STOP, THIEF!" roared Mr. King, hurrying over the stairs. The children,\r\nfrightened at the strange noises, began to cry and scream, as they\r\ncame running through the halls to the spot. Jasper rushed for the\r\nmen-servants.\r\n\r\nAnd there stood Phronsie, surrounded by the pale group. "Twas two\r\nnaughty men," she said, lifting her little face with the grieved,\r\nastonished look still in the big brown eyes, "and they were touching my\r\ngrandpa\'s things, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"I should think they were," said Jasper, running over amongst the few\r\nscattered tools and the lantern, to the windows, where, on the floor,\r\nwas a large table cover hastily caught up by the corners, into which a\r\nvast variety of silver, jewelry, and quantities of costly articles were\r\ngathered ready for flight. "They\'ve broken open your safe, father!" he\r\ncried in excitement, "see!"\r\n\r\n"And they put up their hand--one man did," went on Phronsie. "And the\r\nother said \'Stop!\'--oh, Polly, you hurt me!" she cried, as Polly, unable\r\nto bear the strain any longer, held her so tightly she could hardly\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\n"Go on," said Jasper, "how did they look?"\r\n\r\n"All black," said the child, pushing back her wavy hair and looking at\r\nhim, "very all black, Jasper."\r\n\r\n"And their faces, Phronsie?" said Mr. King, getting down on his old\r\nknees on the floor beside her. "Bless me! somebody else ask her, I can\'t\r\ntalk!"\r\n\r\n"How did their faces look, Phronsie, dear?" asked Jasper, taking one of\r\nthe cold hands in his. "Can\'t you think?"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Phronsie--and then she gave a funny little laugh, "two big\r\nholes, Jasper, that\'s all they had!"\r\n\r\n"She means they were masked," whispered Jasper.\r\n\r\n"What did you get up for?" Mrs. Whitney asked. "Dear child, what made\r\nyou get out of bed?"\r\n\r\n"Why, my cushion-pin," said Phronsie looking worried at once. "I\r\ncouldn\'t find it, and--"\r\n\r\nBut just at this, without a bit of warning, Polly tumbled over in a dead\r\nfaint.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was all confusion again.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on the following afternoon, it turned out that the Peppers,\r\nabout whose coming there had been so many plans and expectations, just\r\nwalked in as if they had always lived there. The greater excitement\r\ncompletely swallowed up the less!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHICH TREATS OF A GOOD MANY MATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n"Phooh!" said Joel a few mornings after the emptying of the little brown\r\nhouse into the big one, when he and Van were rehearsing for the fiftieth\r\ntime all the points of the eventful night, "phooh! if I\'d been here they\r\nwouldn\'t have got away, I guess!"\r\n\r\n"What would you have done?" asked Van, bristling up at this reflection\r\non their courage, and squaring up to him. "What would you have done,\r\nJoel Pepper?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d a-pitched right into \'em--like--everything!" said Joel valiantly;\r\n"and a-caught \'em! Yes, every single one of the Bunglers!"\r\n\r\n"The what?" said Van, bursting into a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n"The Bunglers," said Joel with a red face. "That\'s what you said they\r\nwere, anyway," he added positively.\r\n\r\n"I said Burglars," said Van, doubling up with amusement, while Joel\r\nstood, a little sturdy figure, regarding him with anything but a sweet\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n"Well anyway, I\'d a-caught \'em, so there!" he said, as Van at last\r\nshowed signs of coming out of his fit of laughter, and got up and wiped\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n"How\'d you have caught \'em?" asked Van, scornfully surveying the square\r\nlittle country figure before him. "You can\'t hit any.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t?" said Joel, the black eyes flashing volumes, and coming up in\r\nfront of Van. "You better believe I can, Van Whitney!"\r\n\r\n"Come out in the back yard and try then," said Van hospitably, perfectly\r\ndelighted at the prospect, and flying alone towards the door. "Come\r\nright out and try."\r\n\r\n"All right!" said Joel, following sturdily, equally delighted to show\r\nhis skill.\r\n\r\n"There," said Van, taking off his jacket, and flinging it on the grass,\r\nwhile Joel immediately followed suit with his little homespun one.\r\n"Now we can begin perfectly splendid! I won\'t hit hard," he added\r\npatronizingly, as both boys stood ready.\r\n\r\n"Hit as hard as you\'ve a-mind to," said Joel, "I\'m a-going to."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you may," said Van politely, "because you\'re company. All\r\nright--now!"\r\n\r\nSo at it they went. Before very many minutes were over, Van relinquished\r\nall ideas of treating his company with extra consideration, and was\r\nonly thinking how he could possibly hold his own with the valiant little\r\ncountry lad. Oh, if he could only be called to his lessons--anything\r\nthat would summon him into the house! Just then a window above their\r\nheads was suddenly thrown up, and his mamma\'s voice in natural surprise\r\nand distress called quickly: "Children what are you doing? Oh, Van, how\r\ncould you!"\r\n\r\nBoth contestants turned around suddenly. Joel looked up steadily. "We\'re\r\na-hitting, ma\'am; he said I couldn\'t, and so we came out and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Vanny," said Mrs. Whitney reproachfully, "to treat a little guest\r\nin this way!"\r\n\r\n"I wanted to," said Joel cheerfully; "twas great fun. Let\'s begin again,\r\nVan!"\r\n\r\n"We mustn\'t," said Van, readily giving up the charming prospect, and\r\nbeginning to edge quickly towards the house. "Mamma wouldn\'t like it you\r\nknow. He hits splendidly, mamma," he added generously, looking up. "He\r\ndoes really."\r\n\r\n"And so does Van," cried Joel, his face glowing at the praise. "We\'ll\r\ncome out every day," he added slipping into his jacket, and turning\r\nenthusiastically back to Van.\r\n\r\n"And perhaps he could have pitched into the Burglars," finished Van,\r\nignoring the invitation, and tumbling into his jacket with alarming\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n"I know I could!" cried Joel, scampering after him into the house. "If\r\nI\'d only a-been here!"\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Ben?" said Van, bounding into the hall, and flinging himself\r\ndown on one of the chairs. "Oh dear, I\'m so hot! Say, Joe, where do you\r\ns\'pose Ben is?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," replied Joel, who didn\'t even puff.\r\n\r\n"I saw him a little while ago with master Percy," said Jane, who was\r\ngoing through the hall.\r\n\r\n"There now! and they\'ve gone off somewhere," cried Van in extreme\r\nirritation, and starting up quickly. "I know they have. Which way did\r\nthey go, Jane? And how long ago?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," replied Jane carelessly, "half an hour maybe; and\r\nthey didn\'t go nowhere as I see, at least they were talking at the door,\r\nand I was going up-stairs."\r\n\r\n"Right here?" cried Van, and stamping with his foot to point out the\r\nexact place; "at this door, Jane?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Jane; "at that very door," and then she went into the\r\ndining-room to her work.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear me!" cried Van, and flying out on the veranda, he began to peer\r\nwildly up and down the drive. "And they\'ve gone to some splendid\r\nplace, I know, and wouldn\'t tell us. That\'s just like Percy!" he added\r\nvindictively, "he\'s always stealing away! don\'t you see \'em, Joel? oh,\r\ndo come out and look!"\r\n\r\n"\'Tisn\'t any use," said Joel coolly, sitting down on the chair Van had\r\njust vacated, and swinging his feet comfortably; "they\'re miles away if\r\nthey\'ve been gone half an hour. I\'m goin\' up-stairs," and he sprang up,\r\nand energetically pranced to the stairs.\r\n\r\n"They aren\'t up-stairs!" screamed Van, in scorn, bounding into the hall.\r\n"Don\'t go; I know that they\'ve gone down to the museum!"\r\n\r\n"The what?" exclaimed Joel, nearly at the top, peering over the railing.\r\n"What\'s that you said--what is it?"\r\n\r\n"A museum," shouted Van, "and it\'s a perfectly elegant place, Joel\r\nPepper, and Percy knows I like to go; and now he\'s taken Ben off;\r\nand he\'ll show him all the things! and they\'ll all be old when I take\r\nhim--and--and--oh! I hope the snakes will bite him!" he added, trying to\r\nthink of something bad enough.\r\n\r\n"Do they have snakes there?" asked Joel, staring.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they do," snapped out Van. "They have everything!"\r\n\r\n"Well, they shan\'t bite Ben!" cried Joel in terror. "Oh! do you suppose\r\nthey will?" and he turned right straight around on the stairs, and\r\nlooked at Van.\r\n\r\n"No," said Van, "they won\'t bite--what\'s the matter, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they may," said Joel, his face working, and screwing both fists\r\ninto his eyes; at last he burst right out into a torrent of sobs. "Oh,\r\ndon\'t let \'em Van--don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Why, they can\'t," said Van in an emphatic voice, running up the stairs\r\nto Joel\'s side, frightened to death at his tears.\r\n\r\nThen he began to shake his jacket sleeve violently to bring him back to\r\nreason, "Wait Joe! oh, do stop! oh, dear, what shall I do! I tell you,\r\nthey can\'t bite," he screamed as loud as he could into his ear.\r\n\r\n"You said--you--hoped--they--would," said Joel\'s voice in smothered\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n"Well, they won\'t anyway," said Van decidedly. "Cause they\'re all\r\nstuffed--so there now!"\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t they alive--nor anythin\'?" asked Joel, bringing one black eye\r\ninto sight from behind his chubby hands.\r\n\r\n"No," said Van, "they\'re just as dead as anything, Joel Pepper--been\r\ndead years! and there\'s old crabs there too, old dead crabs--and they\'re\r\njust lovely! Oh, such a lots of eggs as they\'ve got! And there are\r\nshells and bugs and stones--and an awful old crocodile, and--" "Oh,\r\ndear!" sighed Joel, perfectly overcome at such a vision, and sitting\r\ndown on the stairs to think. "Well, mamsie\'ll know where Ben is," he\r\nsaid, springing up. "And then I tell you Van, we\'ll just tag \'em!"\r\n\r\n"So she will," cried Van. "Why didn\'t we think of that before? I wanted\r\nto think."\r\n\r\n"I did," said Joel. "That was where I was goin\'."\r\n\r\nWithout any more ado they rushed into Mrs. Pepper\'s big, sunny room,\r\nthere to see, seated at the square table between the two large windows,\r\nthe two lost ones bending over what seemed to be an object of the\r\ngreatest importance, for Polly was hanging over Ben\'s shoulder with\r\nintense pride and delight, which she couldn\'t possibly conceal, and\r\nDavie was crowded as near as he could get to Percy\'s elbow.\r\n\r\nPhronsie and little Dick were perched comfortably on the corner of the\r\ntable, surveying the whole scene in quiet rapture; and Mrs. Pepper with\r\nher big mending basket, was ensconced over by the deep window seat just\r\non the other side of the room, underneath Cherry\'s cage, and looking up\r\nbetween quick energetic stitches, over at the busy group, with the most\r\nplacid expression on her face.\r\n\r\n"Oh!--what you doin\'?" cried Joel, flying up to them. "Let us see, do\r\nBen!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" exclaimed Van, squeezing in between Percy and Ben.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t--" began Percy. "There, see, you\'ve knocked his elbow and spoilt\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, he hasn\'t," said Ben, putting down his pencil, and taking up a\r\npiece of rubber. "There, see it all comes out--as good as ever."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it just elegant?" said Percy in the most pleased tone, and\r\nwriggling his toes under the table to express his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Van, craning his neck to get a better view of the picture,\r\nnow nearly completed, "It\'s perfectly splendid. How\'d you do it, Ben?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," replied Ben with a smile, carefully shading in a few\r\nlast touches. "It just drew itself."\r\n\r\n"Tisn\'t anything to what he can do," said Polly, standing up as tall as\r\nshe could, and beaming at Ben, "He used to draw most beautiful at home."\r\n\r\n"Better than this?" asked Van, with great respect and taking up the\r\npicture, after some demur on Percy\'s part, and examining it critically.\r\n"I don\'t believe it, Polly."\r\n\r\n"Phooh; he did!" exclaimed Joel, looking over his shoulder at a\r\nwonderful view of a dog in an extremely excited state of mind running\r\ndown an interminable hill to bark at a locomotive and train of cars\r\nwhizzing along a curve in the foreground. "Lots better\'n that! Ben can\r\ndo anything!" he added, in an utterly convincing way.\r\n\r\n"Now give it back," cried Percy, holding out his hand in alarm. "I\'m\r\ngoing to ask mamma to have it framed; and then I\'m going to hang\r\nit right over my bed," he finished, as Van reluctantly gave up the\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\n"Did you draw all the time in the little brown house?" asked Van, lost\r\nin thought. "How I wish I\'d been there!"\r\n\r\n"Dear, no!" cried Polly with a little skip, turning away to laugh. "He\r\ndidn\'t have hardly any time, and--"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n"Cause there was things to do," said Polly. "But sometimes when it\r\nrained, and he couldn\'t go out and work, and there wasn\'t anything to\r\ndo in the house--then we\'d have--oh!" and she drew a long breath at the\r\nmemory, "such a time, you can\'t think!"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you wish it would always rain?" asked Van, still gazing at the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n"Dear, no!" began Polly.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t," broke in Joel, in horror. "I wouldn\'t a-had it rain for\r\nanything!--only once in a while," he added, as he thought of the good\r\ntimes that Polly had spoken of.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas nice outdoors," said little Davie, reflectively; "and nice\r\ninside, too." And then he glanced over to his mother, who gave him a\r\nsmile in return. "And \'twas nice always."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Van, returning to the picture, "I do wish you\'d tell me how\r\nto draw, Ben. I can\'t do anything but flowers," he said in a discouraged\r\nway.\r\n\r\n"Flowers aren\'t anything," said Percy, pleasantly. "That\'s girls\' work;\r\nbut dogs and horses and cars--those are just good!"\r\n\r\n"Will you, Ben?" asked Van, looking down into the big blue eyes, so\r\nkindly turned up to his.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed I will," cried Ben, "that is, all I know; \'tisn\'t much, but\r\neverything I can, I\'ll tell you."\r\n\r\n"Then I can learn, can\'t I?" cried Van joyfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell me too, Ben," cried Percy, "will you? I want to learn too."\r\n\r\n"And me!" cried Dick, bending forward, nearly upsetting Phronsie as he\r\ndid so. "Yes, say I may, Ben, do!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re too little," began Percy. But Ben nodded his head at Dick,\r\nwhich caused him to clap his hands and return to his original position,\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess we\'re going to, too," said Joel. "Dave an\' me; there\r\nisn\'t anybody goin\' to learn without us."\r\n\r\n"Of course not," said Polly, "Ben wouldn\'t leave you out, Joey."\r\n\r\nPhronsie sat quite still all this time, on the corner of the table, her\r\nfeet tucked up under her, and her hands clasped in her lap, and never\r\nsaid a word. But Ben looking up, saw the most grieved expression\r\nsettling on her face, as the large eyes were fixed in wonder on the\r\nfaces before her.\r\n\r\n"And there\'s my pet," he cried in enthusiasm, and reaching over the\r\ntable, he caught hold of one of the little fat hands. "Why we couldn\'t\r\nthink of getting along without her! She shall learn to draw--she shall!"\r\n\r\n"Really, Bensie?" said Phronsie, the sunlight breaking all over the\r\ngloomy little visage, and setting the brown eyes to dancing. "Real,\r\ntrue, splendid pictures?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the splendidest," said Ben, "the very splendidest pictures,\r\nPhronsie Pepper, you ever saw!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Phronsie; and before any one knew what she was about,\r\nshe tripped right into the middle of the table, over the papers and\r\neverything, and gave a happy little whirl!\r\n\r\n"Dear me, Phronsie!" cried Polly catching her up and hugging her; "you\r\nmustn\'t dance on the table."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to learn," said Phronsie, coming out of Polly\'s embrace, "to\r\ndraw whole pictures, all alone by myself--Ben said so!"\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Polly, "and then you shall draw one for mamsie--you\r\nshall!"\r\n\r\n"I will," said Phronsie, dreadfully excited; "I\'ll draw her a cow, and\r\ntwo chickens, Polly, just like Grandma Bascom\'s!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," whispered Polly, "but don\'t you tell her yet till you get it\r\ndone, Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t," said Phronsie in the loudest of tones--but putting her mouth\r\nclose to Polly\'s ear. "And then she\'ll be so s\'prised, Polly! won\'t\r\nshe?"\r\n\r\nJust then came Jasper\'s voice at the door. "Can I come in?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, do, Jappy," cried Polly, rushing along with Phronsie in her arms to\r\nopen the door. "We\'re so glad you\'ve got home!"\r\n\r\n"So am I," said Jasper, coming in, his face flushed and his eyes\r\nsparkling; "I thought father never would be through downtown, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to learn to draw," said Percy, over by the table, who\r\nwouldn\'t on any account leave his seat by Ben, though he was awfully\r\ntired of sitting still so long, for fear somebody else would hop into\r\nit. "Ben\'s going to teach us."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is," put in Van, bounding up to Jasper and pulling at all the\r\nbuttons on his jacket he could reach, to command attention.\r\n\r\n"And us," said Joel, coming up too. "You forgot us, Van."\r\n\r\n"The whole of us--every single one in this room," said Van decidedly,\r\n"all except Mrs. Pepper."\r\n\r\n"Hulloa!" said Jasper, "that is a class! Well, Professor Ben, you\'ve got\r\nto teach me then, for I\'m coming too."\r\n\r\n"You?" said Ben, turning around his chair, and looking at him; "I can\'t\r\nteach you anything, Jappy. You know everything already."\r\n\r\n"Let him come, anyway," said Polly, hopping up and down.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m coming, Professor," laughed Jasper. "Never you fear, Polly;\r\nI\'ll be on hand when the rest of the class comes in!"\r\n\r\n"And Van," said Mrs. Pepper, pausing a minute in her work, and smiling\r\nover at him in a lull in the chatter--"I think flowers are most\r\nbeautiful!" and she pointed to a little framed picture on the mantel,\r\nof the bunch of buttercups and one huge rose that Van had with infinite\r\npatience drawn, and then colored to suit his fancy.\r\n\r\n"Do you?" cried Van, perfectly delighted; and leaving the group he\r\nrushed up to her side. "Do you really think they\'re nice, Mrs. Pepper?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do," said Mrs. Pepper briskly, and beaming on him; "I think\r\neverything of them, and I shall keep them as long as I live, Van!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said Van, very much pleased, "I shall paint you ever so\r\nmany more--just as many as you want!"\r\n\r\n"Do!" said Mrs. Pepper, taking up her work again. "And I\'ll hang them\r\nevery one up."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will," said Van; "and I\'ll go right to work on one to-morrow.\r\nWhat you mending our jackets for?" he asked abruptly as a familiar hole\r\ncaught his attention.\r\n\r\n"Because they\'re torn," said Mrs. Pepper cheerfully, "an\' they won\'t\r\nmend themselves."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you let Jane?" he persisted. "She always does them."\r\n\r\n"Jane\'s got enough to do," replied Mrs. Pepper, smiling away as hard\r\nas she could, "and I haven\'t, so I\'m going to look around and pick up\r\nsomething to keep my hands out of mischief as much as I can, while I\'m\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Do you ever get into mischief?" asked little Dick, coming up and\r\nlooking into Mrs. Pepper\'s face wonderingly. "Why, you\'re a big woman!"\r\n\r\n"Dear me, yes!" said Mrs. Pepper. "The bigger you are, the more mischief\r\nyou can get into. You\'ll find that out, Dickey."\r\n\r\n"And then do you have to stand in a corner?" asked Dick, determined\r\nto find out just what were the consequences, and reverting to his most\r\ndreaded punishment.\r\n\r\n"No," said Mrs. Pepper laughing. "Corners are for little folks; but\r\nwhen people who know better, do wrong, there aren\'t any corners they can\r\ncreep into, or they\'d get into them pretty quick!"\r\n\r\n"I wish," said little Dick, "you\'d let me get into your lap. That would\r\nbe a nice corner!"\r\n\r\n"Do, mamsie," said Polly, coming up, "that\'s just the way I used to\r\nfeel; and I\'ll finish the mending."\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Pepper put down her work, and moved the big basket for little\r\nDick to clamber up, when he laid his head contentedly back in her\r\nmotherly arms with a sigh of happiness. Phronsie regarded him with a\r\nvery grave expression. At last she drew near: "I\'m tired; do, mamsie,\r\ntake me!"\r\n\r\n"So mamsie will," said Mrs. Pepper, opening her arms, when Phronsie\r\nimmediately crawled up into their protecting shelter, with a happy\r\nlittle crow.\r\n\r\n"Oh, now, tell us a story, Mrs. Pepper," cried Van; "please, please do!"\r\n\r\n"No, no;" exclaimed Percy, scuttling out of his chair, and coming up,\r\n"let\'s talk of the little brown house. Do tell us what you used to do\r\nthere--that\'s best."\r\n\r\n"So \'tis!" cried Van; "ALL the nice times you used to have in it! Wait\r\njust a minute, do." And he ran back for a cricket which he placed\r\nat Mrs. Pepper\'s feet; and then sitting down on it, he leaned on her\r\ncomfortable lap, in order to hear better.\r\n\r\n"Wait for me too, till I get a chair," called Percy, starting. "Don\'t\r\nbegin till I get there."\r\n\r\n"Here, let me, Percy," said Ben; and he drew forward a big easy-chair\r\nthat the boy was tugging at with all his might.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'m ready, too," said Polly, setting small finishing stitches\r\nquickly with a merry little flourish, and drawing her chair nearer her\r\nmother\'s as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Now begin, please," said Van, "all the nice times you know."\r\n\r\n"She couldn\'t tell all the nice times if she had ten years to tell them\r\nin, could she, Polly?" said Jasper.\r\n\r\n"Well, in the first place then," said Mrs. Pepper, clearing her throat,\r\n"the little brown house had got to be, you know, so we made up our minds\r\nto make it just the nicest brown house that ever was!"\r\n\r\n"And it was!" declared Jasper, with an emphatic ring to his voice. "The\r\nvery nicest place in the whole world!"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear," broke in Van enviously; "Jappy\'s always said so. I wish we\'d\r\nbeen there, too!"\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t want anybody but Jappy," said Joel not very politely.\r\n\r\n"Oh Joey, for shame!" cried Polly.\r\n\r\n"Jappy used to bake," cried little Davie; "an\' we all made pies; an\'\r\nthen we sat round an\' ate \'em, an\' then told stories."\r\n\r\n"Oh what fun!" cried Percy. "Do tell us!"\r\n\r\nSo the five little Peppers and Jasper flew off into reminiscences and\r\naccounts of the funny doings, and Mrs. Pepper joined in heartily till\r\nthe room got very merry with the glee and enthusiasm called forth; so\r\nmuch so, that nobody heard Mrs. Whitney knock gently at the door, and\r\nnobody answering, she was obliged to come in by herself.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," she cried, merrily, looking at the swarm of little ones\r\naround Mrs. Pepper and the big chair. "You are having a nice time! May I\r\ncome and listen?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you will, sister," cried Jasper, springing off from his arm of\r\nthe chair, while Ben flew from the other side, to hurry and get her a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nPercy and Van rushed too, knocking over so many things that they didn\'t\r\nhelp much; and little Dick poked his head out from Mrs. Pepper\'s arms\r\nwhen he saw his mamma sitting down to stay and began to scramble down to\r\nget into her lap.\r\n\r\n"There now," said Mrs. Whitney, smiling over at Mrs. Pepper, who was\r\nsmiling at her. "You have your baby, and I have mine! Now children,\r\nwhat\'s it all about? What has Mrs. Pepper been telling you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the little brown house," cried Dicky, his cheeks all a-flame. "The\r\ndearest little house mamma! I wish I could live in one!\r\n\r\n"Twouldn\'t be the same without the Peppers in it," said Jasper. "Not a\r\nbit of it!"\r\n\r\n"And they had such perfectly elegant times," cried Percy, enviously,\r\ndrawing up to her side. "Oh, you can\'t think, mamma!"\r\n\r\n"Well now," said his mamma, "do go on, and let me hear some of the nice\r\ntimes."\r\n\r\nSo away they launched again, and Mrs. Whitney was soon enjoying it as\r\nhugely as the children, when a heavy step sounded in the middle of the\r\nroom, and a voice spoke in such a tone that everybody skipped.\r\n\r\n"Well, I should like to know what all this means! I\'ve been all over the\r\nhouse, and not a trace of anybody could I find."\r\n\r\n"Oh father!" cried Mrs. Whitney. "Van, dear, get up and get grandpapa a\r\nchair."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" said the old gentleman, waving him off impatiently. "I\'m not\r\ngoing to stay; I must go and lie down. My head is in a bad condition\r\nto-day; very bad indeed," he added.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Phronsie, popping up her head and looking at him. "I must get\r\nright down."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Phronsie?" asked Mrs. Pepper, trying to hold her\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I must," said Phronsie, energetically wriggling. "My poor sick\r\nman wants me, he does." And flying out of her mother\'s arms, she ran up\r\nto Mr. King, and standing on tiptoe, said softly, "I\'ll rub your head,\r\ngrandpa dear, poor sick man; yes I will."\r\n\r\n"And you\'re the best child," cried the old gentleman, catching her\r\nup and marching over to the other side of the room where there was a\r\nlounging chair. "There now, you and I, Phronsie, will stay by ourselves.\r\nThen my head will feel better."\r\n\r\nAnd he sat down and drew her into his arms.\r\n\r\n"Does it ache very bad?" said Phronsie, in a soft little voice. Then\r\nreaching up she began to pat and smooth it gently with one little hand,\r\n"Very bad, dear grandpa?"\r\n\r\n"It won\'t," said the old gentleman, "if you only keep on taking care of\r\nit, little Phronsie."\r\n\r\n"Then," said the child, perfectly delighted, "I\'m going to take all care\r\nof you, grandpa, always!"\r\n\r\n"So you shall, so you shall!" cried Mr. King, no less delighted than she\r\nwas. "Mrs. Pepper!"\r\n\r\n"Sir?" said Mrs. Pepper, trying to answer, which she couldn\'t do very\r\nwell surrounded as she was by the crowd of little chatterers. "Yes, Sir;\r\nexcuse me what is it, sir?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to come to an understanding about this thing," said the old\r\ngentleman, "and I can\'t talk much to-day, because my headache won\'t\r\nallow it."\r\n\r\nHere the worried look came into Phronsie\'s face again, and she began to\r\ntry to smooth his head with both little hands.\r\n\r\n"And so I must say it all in as few words as possible," he continued.\r\n\r\n"What is it, sir?" again asked Mrs. Pepper, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n"Well, the fact is, I\'ve got to have somebody who will keep this house.\r\nNow Marian, not a word!" as he saw symptoms of Mrs. Whitney\'s joining\r\nin the conversation. "You\'ve been good; just as good as can be under the\r\ncircumstances; but Mason will be home in the fall, and then I suppose\r\nyou\'ll have to go with him. Now I," said the old gentleman, forgetting\r\nall about his head, and straightening himself up suddenly in the chair,\r\n"am going to get things into shape, so that the house will be kept for\r\nall of us; so that we can come or go. And how can I do it better than to\r\nhave the Peppers--you, Mrs. Pepper, and all your children--come here and\r\nlive, and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, father!" cried Jasper, rushing up to him; and flinging his arms\r\naround his neck, he gave him such a hug as he hadn\'t received for many a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n"Goodness, Jasper!" cried his father, feeling of his throat. "How can\r\nyou express your feelings so violently! And, besides, you interrupt."\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, sir," said Jasper, swallowing his excitement, and trying to\r\ncontrol his eagerness.\r\n\r\n"Do you say yes, Mrs. Pepper?" queried the old gentleman impatiently.\r\n"I must get this thing fixed up to-day. I\'m really too ill to be worried\r\nma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Why sir," stammered Mrs. Pepper, "I don\'t know what to say. I couldn\'t\r\nthink of imposing all my children on you, and--"\r\n\r\n"Imposing! Who\'s talking of imposing!" said Mr. King in a loud key.\r\n"I want my house kept; will you live here and keep it? That is the\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"But sir," began Mrs. Pepper again, "you don\'t think--"\r\n\r\n"I do think; I tell you, ma\'am, I do think," snapped the old gentleman.\r\n"It\'s just because I have thought that I\'ve made up my mind. Will you do\r\nit Mrs. Pepper?"\r\n\r\n"What are you goin\' to do, mamsie?" asked Joel quickly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know as I\'m going to do anything yet," said poor Mrs. Pepper,\r\nwho was almost stunned.\r\n\r\n"To come here and live!" cried Jasper, unable to keep still any\r\nlonger--and springing to the children. "Don\'t you want to, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"To live!" screamed Joel. "Oh whickety, yes! Do ma, do come here and\r\nlive--do!"\r\n\r\n"To live?" echoed Phronsie, over in the old gentleman\'s lap. "In this\r\nbe-yew-ti-ful place? Oh, oh!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamsie!" that was all Polly could say.\r\n\r\nAnd even Ben had his arms around his mother\'s neck, whispering "Do" into\r\nher ear, while little Davie got into her lap and teased her with all his\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n"What shall I do!" cried the poor woman. "Did ever anybody see the\r\nlike?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the very best thing you could possibly do," cried the old\r\ngentleman. "Don\'t you see it\'s for the children\'s advantage? They\'ll get\r\nsuch educations, Mrs. Pepper, as you want for them. And it accommodates\r\nme immensely. What obstacle can there be to it?"\r\n\r\n"If I was only sure \'twas best?" said Mrs. Pepper doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear Mrs. Pepper," said Mrs. Whitney, laying her hand on hers. "Can\r\nyou doubt it?"\r\n\r\n"Then," said Mr. King, getting up, but still holding on to Phronsie,\r\n"we\'ll consider it settled. This is your home, children," he said,\r\nwaving his hand at the five little Peppers in a bunch. And having thus\r\nsummarily disposed of the whole business, he marched out with Phronsie\r\non his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLY\'S DISMAL MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything had gone wrong with Polly that day. It began with her boots.\r\n\r\nOf all things in the world that tried Polly\'s patience most were the\r\ntroublesome little black buttons that originally adorned those useful\r\nparts of her clothing, and that were fondly supposed to be there when\r\nneeded. But they never were. The little black things seemed to be\r\ninvested with a special spite, for one by one they would hop off on the\r\nslightest provocation, and go rolling over the floor, just when she was\r\nin her most terrible hurry, compelling her to fly for needle and thread\r\non the instant. For one thing Mrs. Pepper was very strict about--and\r\nthat was, Polly should do nothing else till the buttons were all on\r\nagain, and the boots buttoned up firm and snug.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear!" said Polly, sitting down on the floor, and pulling on her\r\nstockings. "There now, see that hateful old shoe, mamsie!" And she\r\nthrust out one foot in dismay.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with it?" said Mrs. Pepper straightening the things\r\non the bureau. "You haven\'t worn it out already, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no," said Polly, with a little laugh. "I hope not yet, but it\'s\r\nthese dreadful hateful old buttons!" And she twitched the boot off from\r\nher foot with such an impatient little pull, that three or four more\r\nwent flying under the bed. "There now--there\'s a lot more. I don\'t care!\r\nI wish they\'d all go; they might as well!" she cried, tossing that boot\r\non the floor in intense scorn, while she investigated the state of the\r\nother one.\r\n\r\n"Are they all off?" asked Phronsie, pulling herself up out of a little\r\nheap in the middle of the bed, and leaning over the side, where she\r\nviewed Polly sorrowfully. "Every one, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Polly, "but I wish they were, mean old things; when I was\r\ngoing down to play a duet with Jasper! We should have had a good long\r\ntime before breakfast. Oh, mayn\'t I go just once, mamsie? Nobody\'ll\r\nsee me if I tuck my foot under the piano; and I can sew \'em on\r\nafterwards--there\'ll be plenty of time. Do, just once, mamsie!"\r\n\r\n"No," said Mrs. Pepper firmly, "there isn\'t any time but now. And piano\r\nplaying isn\'t very nice when you\'ve got to stick your toes under it to\r\nkeep your shoes on."\r\n\r\n"Well then," grumbled Polly, hopping around in her stocking-feet, "where\r\nis the work-basket, mamsie? Oh--here it is on the window-seat." A rattle\r\nof spools, scissors and necessary utensils showed plainly that Polly had\r\nfound it, followed by a jumble of words and despairing ejaculations as\r\nshe groped hurriedly under chairs and tables to collect the scattered\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nWhen she got back with a very red face, she found Phronsie, who had\r\ncrawled out of bed, sitting down on the floor in her little nightgown\r\nand examining the boot with profound interest.\r\n\r\n"I can sew \'em, Polly," she said, holding up her hand for the big needle\r\nthat Polly was trying to thread--"I can now truly; let me, Polly, do!"\r\n\r\n"Dear no!" said Polly with a little laugh, beginning to be very much\r\nashamed. "What could you do with your little mites of hands pulling\r\nthis big thread through that old leather? There, scamper into bed again;\r\nyou\'ll catch cold out here.\r\n\r\n"Tisn\'t very cold," said Phronsie, tucking up her toes under the\r\nnight-gown, but Polly hurried her into bed, where she curled herself\r\nup under the clothes, watching her make a big knot. But the knot\r\ndidn\'t stay; for when Polly drew up the long thread triumphantly to\r\nthe end--out it flew, and away the button hopped again as if glad to be\r\nreleased. And then the thread kinked horribly, and got all twisted up in\r\ndisagreeable little snarls that took all Polly\'s patience to unravel.\r\n\r\n"It\'s because you\'re in such a hurry," said Mrs. Pepper, who was getting\r\nPhronsie\'s clothes. And coming over across the room she got down on\r\none knee, and looked over Polly\'s shoulder. "There now, let mother see\r\nwhat\'s the matter."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear," said Polly, resigning the needle with a big sigh, and leaning\r\nback to take a good stretch, followed by Phronsie\'s sympathizing eyes;\r\n"they never\'ll be on! And there goes the first bell!" as the loud sounds\r\nunder Jane\'s vigorous ringing pealed up over the stairs. "There won\'t\r\nbe time anyway, now! I wish there wasn\'t such a thing as shoes in the\r\nworld!" And she gave a flounce and sat up straight in front of her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"Polly!" said Mrs. Pepper sternly, deftly fastening the little buttons\r\ntightly into place with quick, firm stitches, "better be glad you\'ve got\r\nthem to sew at all. There now, here they are. Those won\'t come off in a\r\nhurry!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamsie!" cried Polly, ignoring for a moment the delights of the\r\nfinished shoe to fling her arms around her mother\'s neck and give her a\r\ngood hug. "You\'re just the splendidest, goodest mamsie in all the world.\r\nAnd I\'m a hateful, cross old bear, so I am!" she cried remorsefully,\r\nbuttoning herself into her boots. Which done, she flew at the rest of\r\nher preparations and tried to make up for lost time.\r\n\r\nBut \'twas all of no use. The day seemed to be always just racing ahead\r\nof her, and turning a corner, before she could catch up to it, and Ben\r\nand the other boys only caught dissolving views of her as she flitted\r\nthrough halls or over stairs.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Polly?" said Percy at last, coming with great dissatisfaction\r\nin his voice to the library door. "We\'ve called her, I guess a million\r\ntimes, and she won\'t hurry."\r\n\r\n"What do you want to have her do?" asked Jasper, looking up from the\r\nsofa where he had flung himself with a book.\r\n\r\n"Why, she said she\'d make Van and me our sails you know," said Percy,\r\nholding up a rather forlorn looking specimen of a boat, but which the\r\nboys had carved with the greatest enthusiasm, "and we want her now."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you let her alone till she\'s ready to come?" said Jasper quickly.\r\n"You\'re always teasing her to do something," he added.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t tease," said Percy indignantly, coming up to the sofa, boat\r\nin hand, to enforce his words. "She said she\'d love to do \'em, so there,\r\nJasper King!"\r\n\r\n"Coming! coming!" sang Polly over the stairs, and bobbing into the\r\nlibrary, "Oh--here you are, Percy! I couldn\'t come before; mamsie wanted\r\nme. Now, says I, for the sails." And she began to flap out a long white\r\npiece of cotton cloth on the table to trim into just the desired shape.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t the way," said Percy, crowding up, the brightness that had\r\nflashed over his face at Polly\'s appearance beginning to fade. "Hoh!\r\nthose won\'t be good for anything--those ain\'t sails."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t finished," said Polly, snipping away vigorously, and longing\r\nto get back to mamsie. "Wait till they\'re done; then they\'ll be good--as\r\ngood as can be!"\r\n\r\n"And it\'s bad enough to have to make them," put in Jasper, flinging\r\naside his book and rolling over to watch them, "without having to be\r\nfound fault with every second, Percy."\r\n\r\n"They\'re too big," said Percy, surveying them critically, and then\r\nlooking at his boat.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that corner\'s coming off," cried Polly cheerfully, giving it a\r\nsharp cut that sent it flying on the floor. "And they won\'t be too big\r\nwhen they\'re done, Percy, all hemmed and everything. There," as she held\r\none up for inspection, "that\'s just the way I used to make Ben\'s and\r\nmine, when we sailed boats."\r\n\r\n"Is it?" asked Percy, looking with more respect at the piece of cloth\r\nPolly was waving alluringly before him. "Just exactly like it, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Polly, laying it down again for a pattern--"oh, how does\r\nthis go--oh--that\'s it, there--yes, this is just exactly like Bensie\'s\r\nand mine--that was when I was ever so little; and then I used to make\r\nJoel\'s and Davie\'s afterwards and--"\r\n\r\n"And were theirs just like this?" asked Percy, laying his hand on the\r\nsail she had finished cutting out.\r\n\r\n"Pre-cisely," said Polly, with a pin in her mouth. "Just as like as two\r\npeas, Percy Whitney."\r\n\r\n"Then I like them," cried Percy, veering round and regarding them with\r\ngreat satisfaction--as Van bounded in with a torrent of complaints, and\r\ngreat disappointment in every line of his face.\r\n\r\n"Oh now, that\'s too bad!" he cried, seeing Polly fold up the remaining\r\nbits of cloth, and pick up the scraps on the floor. "And you\'ve gone\r\nand let her cut out every one of \'em, and never told me a word! You\'re a\r\nmean, old hateful thing, Percy Whitney!"\r\n\r\n"Oh don\'t!" said Polly, on her knees on the floor.\r\n\r\n"I forgot--" began Percy, "and she cut \'em so quick--and--"\r\n\r\n"And I\'ve been waiting," said Van, in a loud wrathful key, "and\r\nwaiting--and waiting!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Van," said Jasper consolingly, getting off from the sofa\r\nand coming up to the table.\r\n\r\n"They\'re done and done beautifully, aren\'t they?" he said, holding up\r\none.\r\n\r\nBut this only proved fresh fuel for the fire of Van\'s indignation.\r\n\r\n"And you shan\'t have \'em, so!" he cried, making a lunge at the one on\r\nthe table, "for I made most of the boat, there!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, you didn\'t!" cried Percy in the greatest alarm, hanging on to\r\nthe boat in his hand. "I cut--all the keel--and the bow--and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear!" said Polly, in extreme dismay, looking at Jasper. "Come, I\'ll\r\ntell you what I\'ll do, boys."\r\n\r\n"What?" said Van, cooling off a little, and allowing Percy to edge into\r\na corner with the beloved boat and one sail. "What will you, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make you another pair of sails," said Polly groaning within\r\nherself as she thought of the wasted minutes, "and then you can see me\r\ncut \'em, Van."\r\n\r\n"Will you really," he said, delight coming all over his flushed face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will," cried Polly, "wait a minute till I get some more cloth."\r\nAnd she started for the door.\r\n\r\n"Oh now, that\'s too bad!" said Jasper. "To have to cut more of those\r\ntiresome old things! Van, let her off!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I won\'t! I won\'t!" he cried in the greatest alarm, running up to\r\nher as she stood by the door. "You did say so, Polly! You know you did!"\r\n\r\n"Of course I did, Vanny," said Polly, smiling down into his eager face,\r\n"and we\'ll have a splendid pair in just--one--minute!" she sang.\r\n\r\nAnd so the sails were cut out, and the hems turned down and basted, and\r\ntucked away into Polly\'s little work-basket ready for the sewing on the\r\nmorrow. And then Mr. King came in and took Jasper off with him; and the\r\ntwo Whitney boys went up to mamma for a story; and Polly sat down in\r\nmamsie\'s room to tackle her French exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLY\'S BIG BUNDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room was very quiet; but presently Phronsie strayed in, and seeing\r\nPolly studying, climbed up in a chair by the window to watch the birds\r\nhop over the veranda and pick up worms in the grass beside the carriage\r\ndrive. And then came Mrs. Pepper with the big mending basket, and\r\nensconced herself opposite by the table; and nothing was to be heard but\r\nthe "tick, tick" of the clock, and an occasional dropping of a spool\r\nof thread, or scissors, from the busy hands flying in and out among the\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden there was a great rustling in Cherry\'s cage that swung\r\nin the big window on the other side of the room. And then he set up a\r\nloud and angry chirping, flying up and down, and opening his mouth as if\r\nhe wanted to express his mind, but couldn\'t, and otherwise acting in a\r\nvery strange and unaccountable manner.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Mrs. Pepper, "what\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s Cherry," said Polly, lifting up her head from "Fasquelle,"\r\n"and--oh, dear me!" and flinging down the pile of books in her lap on a\r\nchair, she rushed across the room and flew up to the cage and began to\r\nwildly gesticulate and explain and shower down on him every endearing\r\nname she could think of.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" asked her mother, turning around in her chair in\r\nperfect astonishment. "What upon earth, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"How could I!" cried Polly, in accents of despair, not heeding her\r\nmother\'s question. "Oh, mamsie, will he die, do you think?"\r\n\r\n"I guess not," said Mrs. Pepper, laying down her work and coming up to\r\nthe cage, while Phronsie scrambled off from her chair and hurried to the\r\nscene. "Why, he does act queer, don\'t he? P\'raps he\'s been eating too\r\nmuch?"\r\n\r\n"Eating!" said Polly, "oh mamsie, he hasn\'t had anything." And she\r\npointed with shame and remorse to the seed-cup with only a few dried\r\nhusks in the very bottom.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Polly," began Mrs. Pepper; but seeing the look on her face, she\r\nchanged her tone for one more cheerful. "Well, hurry and get him some\r\nnow; he\'ll be all right, poor little thing, in a minute. There, there,"\r\nshe said, nodding persuasively at the cage, "you pretty creature you! so\r\nyou sha\'n\'t be starved."\r\n\r\nAt the word "starved," Polly winced as though a pin had been pointed at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t any, mamsie, in the house," she stammered; "he had the last\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"And you forgot him to-day?" asked Mrs. Pepper, with a look in her black\r\neyes Polly didn\'t like.\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said poor Polly in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Well, he must have something right away," said Mrs. Pepper, decidedly.\r\n"That\'s certain."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll run right down to Fletcher\'s and get it," cried Polly.\r\n\r\n"Twon\'t take me but a minute, mamsie; Jasper\'s gone, and Thomas, too, so\r\nI\'ve got to go," she added, as she saw her mother hesitate.\r\n\r\n"If you could wait till Ben gets home," said Mrs. Pepper, slowly. "I\'m\r\nmost afraid it will rain, Polly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, mamsie," cried Polly, feeling as if she could fly to the ends\r\nof the earth to atone, and longing beside for the brisk walk down town.\r\nGoing up to the window she pointed triumphantly to the little bit of\r\nblue sky still visible. "There, now, see, it can\'t rain yet awhile."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mrs. Pepper, while Phronsie, standing in a chair with her\r\nface pressed close to the cage, was telling Cherry through the bars "not\r\nto be hungry, please don\'t!" which he didn\'t seem to mind in the least,\r\nbut went on screaming harder than ever! "And besides, \'tisn\'t much use\r\nto wait for Ben. Nobody knows where he\'ll get shoes to fit himself and\r\nJoe and Davie, in one afternoon! But be sure, Polly, to hurry, for it\'s\r\ngetting late, and I shall be worried about you.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamsie," said Polly, turning back just a minute, "I know the way to\r\nFletcher\'s just as easy as anything. I couldn\'t get lost."\r\n\r\n"I know you do," said Mrs. Pepper, "but it\'ll be dark early on account\r\nof the shower. Well," she said, pulling out her well-worn purse from her\r\npocket, "if it does sprinkle, you get into a car, Polly, remember."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I will," she cried, taking the purse.\r\n\r\n"And there\'s ten cents for your bird seed in that pocket," said Mrs.\r\nPepper, pointing to a coin racing away into a corner by itself.\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Polly, wild to be off.\r\n\r\n"And there\'s a five-cent piece in that one for you to ride up with,"\r\nsaid her mother, tying up the purse carefully. "Remember, for you to\r\nride up with. Well, I guess you better ride up anyway, Polly, come to\r\nthink, and then you\'ll get home all the quicker."\r\n\r\n"Where you going?" asked Phronsie, who on seeing the purse knew there\r\nwas some expedition on foot, and beginning to clamber down out of the\r\nchair. "Oh, I want to go too, I do. Take me, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. Pet, I can\'t," cried Polly, "I\'ve got to hurry like\r\neverything!"\r\n\r\n"I can hurry too," cried Phronsie, drawing her small figure to its\r\nutmost height, "oh, so fast, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"And it\'s ever so far," cried Polly, in despair, as she saw the small\r\nunder lip of the child begin to quiver. "Oh, dear me, mamsie, what shall\r\nI do!"\r\n\r\n"Run right along," said Mrs. Pepper, briskly. "Now, Phronsie, you and I\r\nought to take care of Cherry, poor thing."\r\n\r\nAt this Phronsie turned and wiped away two big tears, while she gazed up\r\nat the cage in extreme commiseration.\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'ll give him a piece of bread," said Mrs. Pepper to herself.\r\nAt this word "bread," Polly, who was half way down the hall, came\r\nrunning back.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamsie, don\'t," she said. "It made him sick before, don\'t you know\r\nit did--so fat and stuffy."\r\n\r\n"Well, hurry along then," said Mrs. Pepper, and Polly was off.\r\n\r\nOver the ground she sped, only intent on reaching the bird store, her\r\nspeed heightened by the dark and rolling bank of cloud that seemed to\r\nshut right down suddenly over her and envelop her warningly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s good I\'ve got the money to ride up with," she thought to herself,\r\nhurrying along through the busy streets, filled now with anxious crowds\r\nhomeward rushing to avoid the threatening shower. "Well, here I am," she\r\nsaid with a sigh of relief, as she at last reached Mr. Fletcher\'s big\r\nbird store.\r\n\r\nHere she steadily resisted all temptations to stop and look at the new\r\narrivals of birds, and to feed the carrier-pigeons who seemed to be\r\nexpecting her, and who turned their soft eyes up at her reproachfully\r\nwhen she failed to pay her respects to them. Even the cunning\r\nblandishments of a very attractive monkey that always had entertained\r\nthe children on their numerous visits, failed to interest her now.\r\nMamsie would be worrying, she knew; and besides, the sight of so many\r\nbirds eating their suppers out of generously full seed-cups, only filled\r\nher heart with remorse as she thought of poor Cherry and his empty one.\r\n\r\nSo she put down her ten cents silently on the counter, and took up the\r\nlittle package of seed, and went out.\r\n\r\nBut what a change! The cloud that had seemed but a cloud when she went\r\nin, was now fast descending in big ominous sprinkles that told of a\r\nheavy shower to follow. Quick and fast they came, making everybody fly\r\nto the nearest shelter.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Polly to herself, holding fast her little package.\r\n"I\'ll run and get in the car--then I\'ll be all right."\r\n\r\nSo she went on with nimble footsteps, dodging the crowd, and soon came\r\nto the corner. A car was just in sight--that was fine! Polly put her\r\nhand in her pocket for her purse, to have it all ready--but as quickly\r\ndrew it out again and stared wildly at the car, which she allowed to\r\npass by. Her pocket was empty!\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," she said to herself, as a sudden gust of wind blew around\r\nthe corner, and warned her to move on, "now what shall I do! Well, I\r\nmust hurry. Nothing for it but to run now!"\r\n\r\nAnd secretly glad at the chance for a good hearty run along the hard\r\npavements, a thing she had been longing to do ever since she came to the\r\ncity, Polly gathered her bundle of seed up under her arm, and set out\r\nfor a jolly race. She was enjoying it hugely, when--a sudden turn of the\r\ncorner brought her up against a gentleman, who, having his umbrella down\r\nto protect his face, hadn\'t seen her till it was too late.\r\n\r\nPolly never could tell how it was done; but the first thing she knew she\r\nwas being helped up from the wet, slippery pavement by a kind hand; and\r\na gentleman\'s voice said in the deepest concern:\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon; it was extremely careless in me."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no matter," said Polly, hopping up with a little laugh, and\r\nstraightening her hat. "Only--" and she began to look for her parcel\r\nthat had been sent spinning.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" said the gentleman, bending down and beginning to explore,\r\ntoo, in the darkness.\r\n\r\n"My bundle," began Polly. "Oh, dear!"\r\n\r\nNo need to ask for it now! There lay the paper wet and torn, down at\r\ntheir feet. The seed lay all over the pavement, scattered far and wide\r\neven out to the puddles in the street. And not a cent of money to get\r\nany more with! The rain that was falling around them as they stood there\r\nsent with the sound of every drop such a flood of misery into Polly\'s\r\nheart!\r\n\r\n"What was it, child?" asked the gentleman, peering sharply to find out\r\nwhat the little shiny things were.\r\n\r\n"Bird-seed," gasped Polly.\r\n\r\n"Is that all?" said the gentleman with a happy laugh. "I\'m very glad."\r\n\r\n"All!" Polly\'s heart stood still as she thought of Cherry, stark and\r\nstiff in the bottom of his cage, if he didn\'t get it soon. "Now," said\r\nthe kind tones, briskly, "come, little girl, we\'ll make this all right\r\nspeedily. Let\'s see--here\'s a bird store. Now, then."\r\n\r\n"But, sir--" began Polly, holding back.\r\n\r\nEven Cherry had better die than to do anything her mother wouldn\'t like.\r\nBut the gentleman already had her in the shop, and was delighting the\r\nheart of the shop-keeper by ordering him to do up a big package of all\r\nkinds of seed. And then he added a cunning arrangement for birds to\r\nswing in, and two or three other things that didn\'t have anything to do\r\nwith birds at all. And then they came out on the wet, slippery street\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, little girl," said the gentleman, tucking the bundle under\r\nhis arm, and opening the umbrella; then he took hold of Polly\'s hand,\r\nwho by this time was glad of a protector. "Where do you live? For I\'m\r\ngoing to take you safely home this time where umbrellas can\'t run into\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Polly, with a little skip. "Thank you sir! It\'s up to Mr.\r\nKing\'s; and--"\r\n\r\n"What!" said the gentleman, stopping short in the midst of an immense\r\npuddle, and staring at her, "Mr. Jasper King\'s?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know sir," said Polly, "what his other name is. Yes it must be\r\nJasper; that\'s what Jappy\'s is, anyway," she added with a little laugh,\r\nwishing very much that she could see Jappy at that identical moment.\r\n\r\n"Jappy!" said the stranger, still standing as if petrified. "And are\r\nthere little Whitney children in the same house!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Polly, raising her clear, brown eyes up at him. The gas\r\nlighter was just beginning his rounds, and the light from a neighboring\r\nlamp flashed full on Polly\'s face as she spoke, showing just how clear\r\nand brown the eyes were. "There\'s Percy, and Van, and little Dick--oh,\r\nhe\'s so cunning!" she cried, impulsively.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman\'s face looked very queer just then; but he merely said:\r\n\r\n"Why, you must be Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I am," said Polly, pleased to think he knew her. And then she\r\ntold him how she\'d forgotten Cherry\'s seed, and all about it. "And\r\noh, sir," she said, and her voice began to tremble, "Mamsie\'ll be so\r\nfrightened if I don\'t get there soon!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going up there myself, so that it all happens very nicely," said\r\nthe gentleman, commencing to start off briskly, and grasping her hand\r\ntighter. "Now, then, Polly."\r\n\r\nSo off they went at a very fast pace; she, skipping through the puddles\r\nthat his long, even strides carried him safely over, chattered away\r\nby his side under the umbrella, and answered his many questions, and\r\naltogether got so very well acquainted that by the time they turned in\r\nat the old stone gateway, she felt as if she had known him for years.\r\n\r\nAnd there, the first thing they either of them saw, down in a little\r\ncorner back of the tall evergreens, was a small heap that rose as they\r\nsplashed up the carriage-drive, and resolved itself into a very red\r\ndress and a very white apron, as it rushed impulsively up and flung\r\nitself into Polly\'s wet arms:\r\n\r\n"And I was so tired waiting, Polly!"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear me, Phronsie!" cried Polly, huddling her up from the dark, wet\r\nground. "You\'ll catch your death! What will mamsie say!"\r\n\r\nThe stranger, amazed at this new stage of the proceedings, was vainly\r\ntrying to hold the umbrella over both, till the procession could move on\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Phronsie, shaking her yellow head decidedly, "they\'re all\r\nlooking for you, Polly." She pointed one finger solemnly up to the big\r\ncarved door as she spoke. At that Polly gathered her up close and began\r\nto walk with rapid footsteps up the path.\r\n\r\n"Do let me carry you, little girl," said Polly\'s kind friend\r\npersuasively, bending down to the little face on Polly\'s neck.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no, no!" said Phronsie, at each syllable grasping Polly around\r\nthe throat in perfect terror, and waving him off with a very crumpled,\r\nmangy bit of paper, that had already done duty to wipe off the copious\r\ntears during her anxious watch. "Don\'t let him, Polly, don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"There sha\'n\'t anything hurt you," said Polly, kissing her reassuringly,\r\nand stepping briskly off with her burden, just as the door burst open,\r\nand Joel flew out on the veranda steps, followed by the rest of the\r\ntroop in the greatest state of excitement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, whickety! she\'s come!" he shouted, springing up to her over the\r\npuddles, and crowding under the umbrella. "Where\'d you get Phronsie?" he\r\nasked, standing quite still at sight of the little feet tucked up to get\r\nout of the rain. And without waiting for an answer he turned and shot\r\nback into the house proclaiming in stentorian tones, "Ma, Polly\'s\r\ncome--an\' she\'s got Phronsie--an\' an awful big man--and they\'re out by\r\nthe gate!"\r\n\r\n"Phronsie!" said Mrs. Pepper, springing to her feet, "why, I thought she\r\nwas up-stairs with Jane."\r\n\r\n"Now, somebody," exclaimed old Mr. King, who sat by the library table\r\nvainly trying to read a newspaper, which he now threw down in extreme\r\nirritation as he rose quickly and went to the door to welcome the\r\nwanderers, "somebody ought to watch that poor child, whose business\r\nit is to know where she is! She\'s caught her death-cold, no doubt, no\r\ndoubt!"\r\n\r\nOutside, in the rain, the children revolved around and around Polly and\r\nPhronsie, hugging and kissing them, until nobody could do much more than\r\nbreathe, not seeming to notice the stranger, who stood quietly waiting\r\ntill such time as he could be heard.\r\n\r\nAt last, in a lull in the scramble, as they were dragging Polly and her\r\nburden up the steps, each wild for the honor of escorting her into the\r\nhouse, he cried out in laughing tones:\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t anybody going to kiss me, I wonder!"\r\n\r\nThe two little Whitneys, who were eagerly clutching Polly\'s arms,\r\nturned around; and Percy rubbed his eyes in a puzzled way, as Joel said,\r\nstopping a minute to look up at the tall figure:\r\n\r\n"We don\'t ever kiss strangers--mamsie\'s told us not to."\r\n\r\n"For shame, Joey!" cried Polly, feeling her face grow dreadfully red in\r\nthe darkness, "the gentleman\'s been so kind to me!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, my boy," said the stranger, laughing and bending down\r\nto Joel\'s upturned, sturdy countenance, at the same instant that Mrs.\r\nPepper flung open the big door, and a bright, warm light fell straight\r\nacross his handsome face. And then--well, then Percy gave a violent\r\nbound, and upsetting Joel as he did so, wriggled his way down the\r\nsteps--at the same time that Van, on Polly\'s other side, rushed up to\r\nthe gentleman:\r\n\r\n"Papa--oh, papa!"\r\n\r\nPolly, half way up the steps, turned around, and then, at the rush of\r\nfeeling that gathered at her heart, sat right down on the wet slippery\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n"Why, Polly Pepper!" exclaimed Joel, not minding his own upset. "You\'re\r\nright in all the slush--mother won\'t like it, I tell you!"\r\n\r\n"Hush!" cried Polly, catching his arm, "he\'s come--oh, Joel--he\'s come!"\r\n\r\n"Who?" cried Joel, staring around blindly, "who, Polly?" Polly had just\r\nopened her lips to explain, when Mr. King\'s portly, handsome figure\r\nappeared in the doorway. "Do come in, children--why--good gracious,\r\nMason!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," cried the stranger, lightly, dropping his big bundle and umbrella\r\nas he passed in the door, with his little sons clinging to him. "Where\r\nis Marian?"\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you write?" asked the old gentleman, testily. "These\r\nsurprises aren\'t the right sort of things," and he began to feel\r\nvigorously of his heart. "Here, Mrs. Pepper, be so good as to call Mrs.\r\nWhitney."\r\n\r\n"Pepper! Pepper!" repeated Mr. Whitney, perplexedly.\r\n\r\n"She\'s coming--I hear her up-stairs," cried Van Whitney. "Oh, let me\r\ntell her!" He struggled to get down from his father\'s arms as he said\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n"No, I shall--I heard her first!" cried Percy. "Oh, dear me! Grandpapa\'s\r\ngoing to!"\r\n\r\nMr. King advanced to the foot of the staircase as his daughter, all\r\nunconscious, ran down with a light step, and a smile on her face.\r\n\r\n"Has Polly come?" she asked, seeing only her father. "Yes," replied the\r\nold gentleman, shortly, "and she\'s brought a big bundle, Marian!"\r\n\r\n"A big bundle?" she repeated wonderingly, and gazing at him.\r\n\r\n"A very big bundle," he said, and taking hold of her shoulders he turned\r\nher around on--her husband.\r\n\r\nSo Polly and Phronsie crept in unnoticed after all.\r\n\r\n"I wish Ben was here," said little Davie, capering around the Whitney\r\ngroup, "an\' Jappy, I do!"\r\n\r\n"Where are they!" asked Polly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know," said Joel, tugging at his shoe-string. "See--aren\'t these\r\nprime!" He held up a shining black shoe, fairly bristling with newness,\r\nfor Polly to admire.\r\n\r\n"Splendid," she cried heartily; "but where are the boys?"\r\n\r\n"They went after you," said Davie, "after we came home with our shoes."\r\n\r\n"No, they didn\'t," contradicted Joel, flatly; and sitting down on the\r\nfloor he began to tie and untie his new possessions. "When we came home\r\nBen drew us pictures--lots of \'em--don\'t you know?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Davie, nodding his head, "so he did; that was when we\r\nall cried \'cause you weren\'t home, Polly."\r\n\r\n"He drawed me a be-yew-tiful one," cried Phronsie, holding up her mangy\r\nbit; "see, Polly, see!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the little brown house," said Davie, looking over her shoulder\r\nas Phronsie put it carefully into Polly\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all washed out," said Polly, smoothing it out, "when you staid out\r\nin the rain."\r\n\r\nPhronsie\'s face grew very grave at that.\r\n\r\n"Bad, naughty old rain," she said, and then she began to cry as hard as\r\nshe could.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, don\'t!" cried Polly in dismay, trying her best to stop her,\r\n"oh, Phronsie, do stop!" she implored, pointing into the next room\r\nwhence the sound of happy voices issued, "they\'ll all hear you!"\r\n\r\nBut Phronsie in her grief didn\'t care, but wailed on steadily.\r\n\r\n"Who is it anyway?" cried Joel, tired of admiring his precious shoes,\r\nand getting up to hear them squeak, "that great big man, you know,\r\nPolly, that came in with you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I thought I told you," said Polly, at her wit\'s end over Phronsie.\r\n"It\'s Percy and Van\'s father, Joey!"\r\n\r\n"Whockey!" cried Joel, completely stunned, "really and truly, Polly\r\nPepper?"\r\n\r\n"Really and truly," cried Polly, bundling Phronsie up in her arms to lay\r\nthe little wet cheek against hers.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m going to peek," cried Joel, squeaking across the floor to\r\ncarry his threat into execution.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you mustn\'t, Joe!" cried Polly, frightened lest he should. "Come\r\nright back, or I\'ll tell mamsie!"\r\n\r\n"They\'re all comin\' in, anyway," cried little Davie, delightedly, and\r\nscuttling over to Polly\'s side.\r\n\r\n"And here are the little friends I\'ve heard so much about!" cried\r\nMr. Whitney coming in amongst them. "Oh, you needn\'t introduce me to\r\nPolly--she brought me home!"\r\n\r\n"They\'re all Pepperses," said Percy, waving his hand, and doing the\r\nbusiness up at one stroke.\r\n\r\n"Only the best of \'em isn\'t here," observed Van, rather ungallantly, "he\r\ndraws perfectly elegant, papa!"\r\n\r\n"I like Polly best, I do!" cried little Dick, tumbling after. "Peppers!"\r\nagain repeated Mr. Whitney in a puzzled way.\r\n\r\n"And here is Mrs. Pepper," said old Mr. King, pompously drawing her\r\nforward, "the children\'s mother, and--"\r\n\r\nBut here Mrs. Pepper began to act in a very queer way, rubbing her eyes\r\nand twisting one corner of her black apron in a decidedly nervous manner\r\nthat, as the old gentleman looked up, he saw with astonishment presently\r\ncommunicated itself to the gentleman opposite.\r\n\r\n"Is it," said Mr. Whitney, putting out his hand and grasping the hard,\r\ntoil-worn one in the folds of the apron, "is it cousin Mary?"\r\n\r\n"And aren\'t you cousin John?" she asked, the tears in her bright black\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Of all things in this world!" cried the old gentleman, waving his\r\nhead helplessly from one to the other. "Will somebody have the extreme\r\ngoodness to tell us what all this means?"\r\n\r\nAt this the little Peppers crowded around their mother, and into all the\r\nvacant places they could find, to get near the fascinating scene.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Whitney, sitting down and drawing his wife to his side,\r\n"it\'s a long story. You see, when I was a little youngster, and--"\r\n\r\n"You were John Whitney then," put in Mrs. Pepper, slyly. "That\'s the\r\nreason I never knew when they were all talking of Mason Whitney."\r\n\r\n"John Whitney I was," said Mr. Whitney, laughing, "or rather, Johnny and\r\nJack. But Grandmother Mason, when I grew older, wanted me called by my\r\nmiddle name to please grandfather. But to go back--when I was a little\r\nshaver, about as big as Percy here--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa!" began Percy, deprecatingly. To be called "a little shaver"\r\nbefore all the others!\r\n\r\n"He means, dearie," said his mamma, reassuringly, "when he was a boy\r\nlike you. Now hear what papa is going to say."\r\n\r\n"Well, I was sent up into Vermont to stay at the old place. There was a\r\nlittle girl there; a bright, black-eyed little girl. She was my cousin,\r\nand her name was Mary Bartlett."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s Mary Bartlett?" asked Joel, interrupting.\r\n\r\n"There she is, sir," said Mr. Whitney, pointing to Mrs. Pepper, who was\r\nlaughing and crying together.\r\n\r\n"Where?" said Joel, utterly bewildered. "I don\'t see any Mary Bartlett.\r\nWhat does he mean, Polly?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Polly. "Wait, Joey," she whispered, "he\'s going to\r\ntell us all about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, this little cousin and I went to the district school, and had\r\nmany good times together. And then my parents sent for me, and I went to\r\nGermany to school; and when I came back I lost sight of her. All I could\r\nfind out was that she had married an Englishman by the name of Pepper."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried all the children together.\r\n\r\n"And I always supposed she had gone to England for despite all\r\nmy exertions, I could find no trace of her. Ah, Mary," he said\r\nreproachfully, "why didn\'t you let me know where you were?"\r\n\r\n"I heard," said Mrs. Pepper, "that you\'d grown awfully rich, and I\r\ncouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"You always were a proud little thing," he said laughing. "Well, but,"\r\nbroke in Mr. King, unable to keep silence any longer, "I\'d like to\r\ninquire, Mason, why you didn\'t find all this out before, in Marian\'s\r\nletters, when she mentioned Mrs. Pepper?"\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t ever mention her," said Mr. Whitney, turning around to face\r\nhis questioner, "not as Mrs. Pepper--never once by name. It was always\r\neither \'Polly\'s mother,\' or \'Phronsie\'s mother.\' Just like a woman," he\r\nadded, with a mischievous glance at his wife, "not to be explicit."\r\n\r\n"And just like a man," she retorted, with a happy little laugh, "not to\r\nask for explanations."\r\n\r\n"I hear Jappy," cried Polly, in a glad voice, "and Ben--oh, good!" as\r\na sound of rushing footsteps was heard over the veranda steps, and down\r\nthe long hall.\r\n\r\nThe door was thrown suddenly open, and Jasper plunged in, his face\r\nflushed with excitement, and after him Ben, looking a little as he did\r\nwhen Phronsie was lost, while Prince squeezed panting in between the two\r\nboys.\r\n\r\n"Has Polly got--" began Jasper.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I\'m here," cried Polly, springing up to them; "oh, Ben!"\r\n\r\n"She has," cried Joel, disentangling himself from the group, "don\'t you\r\nsee, Jappy?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s all home," echoed Phronsie, flying up. "Oh, Ben, do draw me\r\nanother little house!"\r\n\r\n"And see--see!" cried the little Whitneys, pointing with jubilant\r\nfingers to their papa, "see what she brought!"\r\n\r\nJasper turned around at that--and then rushed forward.\r\n\r\n"Oh, brother Mason!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Jasper," said Mr. Whitney, a whole wealth of affection beaming on\r\nthe boy, "how you have stretched up in six months!"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I?" said Jasper, laughing, and drawing himself up to his\r\nfullest height.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a-standin\' on tip-toe," said Joel critically, who was hovering\r\nnear. "I most know he is!" and he bent down to examine the position of\r\nJasper\'s heels.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it, Joe!" cried Jasper, with a merry laugh, and setting\r\nboth feet with a convincing thud on the floor.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, I\'ll be just as big," cried Joel, "when I\'m thirteen,\r\nso!"\r\n\r\nJust then a loud and quick rap on the table made all the children skip,\r\nand stopped everybody\'s tongue. It came from Mr. King.\r\n\r\n"Phronsie," said he, "come here, child. I can\'t do anything without\r\nyou," and held out his hand. Phronsie immediately left Ben, who was\r\nhanging over Polly as if he never meant to let her go out of his sight\r\nagain, and went directly over to the old gentleman\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Now, then!" He swung her upon his shoulder, where she perched like a\r\nlittle bird, gravely surveying the whole group. One little hand stole\r\naround the old gentleman\'s neck, and patted his cheek softly, which so\r\npleased him that for a minute or two he stood perfectly still so that\r\neverybody might see it.\r\n\r\n"Now, Phronsie, you must tell all these children so that they\'ll\r\nunderstand--say everything just as I tell you, mind!"\r\n\r\n"I will," said Phronsie, shaking her small head wisely, "every single\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, now begin--"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, now begin," said Phronsie, looking down on the faces with\r\nan air as much like Mr. King\'s as was possible, and finishing up with\r\ntwo or three little nods.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, dear, that isn\'t it," cried the old gentleman, "I\'ll tell you.\r\nSay, Phronsie, \'you are all cousins--every one.\'"\r\n\r\n"You are all cousins--every one," repeated little Phronsie, simply,\r\nshaking her yellow head into the very middle of the group.\r\n\r\n"Does she mean it, grandpapa? Does she mean it?" cried Percy, in the\r\ngreatest excitement.\r\n\r\n"As true as everything?" demanded Joel, crowding in between them.\r\n\r\n"As true as--truth!" said the old gentleman solemnly, patting the\r\nchild\'s little fat hand. "So make the most of it."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Polly, with a long sigh. And then Jasper and she took hold of\r\nhands and had a good spin!\r\n\r\nJoel turned around with two big eyes on Percy.\r\n\r\n"We\'re cousins!" he said.\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Percy, "and so\'s Van!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Van, flying up, "and I\'m cousin to Polly, too--that\'s best!"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I be a Cousin?" cried little Dick, crowding up, with two red\r\ncheeks. "Isn\'t anybody going to be a cousin to me, too?"\r\n\r\n"Everybody but Jasper," said the old gentleman, laughing heartily at\r\nthem. "You and I, my boy," he turned to his son, "are left out in the\r\ncold."\r\n\r\nAt this a scream, loud and terrible to hear, struck upon them all, as\r\nJoel flung himself flat on the floor.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t Jappy--our--cousin? I--want--Jappy!"\r\n\r\n"Goodness!" exclaimed the old gentleman, in the greatest alarm, "what is\r\nthe matter with the boy! Do somebody stop him!"\r\n\r\n"Joel," said Jasper, leaning over him, and trying to help Polly lift him\r\nup. "I\'ll tell you how we\'ll fix it! I\'ll be your brother. That\'s best\r\nof all--brother to Polly, and Ben and the whole of you--then we\'ll see!"\r\n\r\nJoel bolted up at that, and began to smile through the tears running\r\ndown the rosy face.\r\n\r\n"Will you, really?" he said, "just like Ben--and everything?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t be as good as Ben," said Jappy, laughing, "but I\'ll be a real\r\nbrother like him."\r\n\r\n"Phoo--phoo! Then I don\'t care!" cried Joel wiping off the last tear\r\non the back of his chubby hand. "Now I guess we\'re better\'n you," he\r\nexclaimed with a triumphant glance over at the little Whitneys, as he\r\nbegan to make the new shoes skip at a lively pace up and down the long\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" they both cried in great distress.\r\n\r\n"Now, papa, Jappy\'s going to be Joey\'s brother--and he isn\'t anything\r\nbut our old uncle! Make him be ours more, papa, do!"\r\n\r\nAnd then Polly sprang up.\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh--deary me!" And she rushed out into the hall and began to\r\ntug violently at the big bundle, tossed down in a corner. "Cherry\'ll\r\ndie--Cherry\'ll die!" she cried, "do somebody help me off with the\r\nstring!"\r\n\r\nBut Polly already had it off by the time Jasper\'s knife was half out\r\nof his pocket, and was kneeling down on the floor scooping out a big\r\nhandful of the seed.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t hurry so, Polly," said Jasper, as she jumped up to fly up-stairs.\r\n"He\'s had some a perfect age--he\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"What!" said Polly, stopping so suddenly that two or three little seeds\r\nflew out of the outstretched hand and went dancing away to the foot of\r\nthe stairs by themselves.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I heard him scolding away there when I first came home," said\r\nJasper, "so I just ran down a block or two, and got him some."\r\n\r\n"Is that all there is in that big bundle?" said Joel in a disappointed\r\ntone, who had followed with extreme curiosity to see its contents.\r\n"Phoo!--that\'s no fun--old bird-seed!"\r\n\r\n"I know," said Polly with a gay little laugh, pointing with the handful\r\nof seed into the library, "but I shouldn\'t have met the other big bundle\r\nif it hadn\'t have been for this, Joe!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Five Little Peppers And How They Grew, by \r\nMargaret Sidney\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2770.txt or 2770.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/7/7/2770/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Reed\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
