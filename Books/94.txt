He had lived there\r\nas a student, but for twenty years and more, since he had been\r\nProfessor of Philosophy in a Western university, he had seldom come\r\nEast except to take a steamer for some foreign port. Wilson was\r\nstanding quite still, contemplating with a whimsical smile the slanting\r\nstreet, with its worn paving, its irregular, gravely colored houses,\r\nand the row of naked trees on which the thin sunlight was still\r\nshining. The gleam of the river at the foot of the hill made him blink\r\na little, not so much because it was too bright as because he found it\r\nso pleasant. The few passers-by glanced at him unconcernedly, and even\r\nthe children who hurried along with their school-bags under their arms\r\nseemed to find it perfectly natural that a tall brown gentleman should\r\nbe standing there, looking up through his glasses at the gray\r\nhousetops.\r\n\r\nThe sun sank rapidly; the silvery light had faded from the bare boughs\r\nand the watery twilight was setting in when Wilson at last walked down\r\nthe hill, descending into cooler and cooler depths of grayish shadow.\r\nHis nostril, long unused to it, was quick to detect the smell of wood\r\nsmoke in the air, blended with the odor of moist spring earth and the\r\nsaltiness that came up the river with the tide. He crossed Charles\r\nStreet between jangling street cars and shelving lumber drays, and\r\nafter a moment of uncertainty wound into Brimmer Street. The street was\r\nquiet, deserted, and hung with a thin bluish haze. He had already fixed\r\nhis sharp eye upon the house which he reasoned should be his objective\r\npoint, when he noticed a woman approaching rapidly from the opposite\r\ndirection. Always an interested observer of women, Wilson would have\r\nslackened his pace anywhere to follow this one with his impersonal,\r\nappreciative glance. She was a person of distinction he saw at once,\r\nand, moreover, very handsome. She was tall, carried her beautiful head\r\nproudly, and moved with ease and certainty. One immediately took for\r\ngranted the costly privileges and fine spaces that must lie in the\r\nbackground from which such a figure could emerge with this rapid and\r\nelegant gait. Wilson noted her dress, too,\xe2\x80\x94for, in his way, he had an\r\neye for such things,\xe2\x80\x94particularly her brown furs and her hat. He got a\r\nblurred impression of her fine color, the violets she wore, her white\r\ngloves, and, curiously enough, of her veil, as she turned up a flight\r\nof steps in front of him and disappeared.\r\n\r\nWilson was able to enjoy lovely things that passed him on the wing as\r\ncompletely and deliberately as if they had been dug-up marvels, long\r\nanticipated, and definitely fixed at the end of a railway journey. For\r\na few pleasurable seconds he quite forgot where he was going, and only\r\nafter the door had closed behind her did he realize that the young\r\nwoman had entered the house to which he had directed his trunk from the\r\nSouth Station that morning. He hesitated a moment before mounting the\r\nsteps. \xe2\x80\x9cCan that,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured in amazement,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccan that possibly have\r\nbeen Mrs. Alexander?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the servant admitted him, Mrs. Alexander was still standing in the\r\nhallway. She heard him give his name, and came forward holding out her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, indeed, Professor Wilson? I was afraid that you might get\r\nhere before I did. I was detained at a concert, and Bartley telephoned\r\nthat he would be late. Thomas will show you your room. Had you rather\r\nhave your tea brought to you there, or will you have it down here with\r\nme, while we wait for Bartley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson was pleased to find that he had been the cause of her rapid\r\nwalk, and with her he was even more vastly pleased than before. He\r\nfollowed her through the drawing-room into the library, where the wide\r\nback windows looked out upon the garden and the sunset and a fine\r\nstretch of silver-colored river. A harp-shaped elm stood stripped\r\nagainst the pale-colored evening sky, with ragged last year\xe2\x80\x99s birds\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnests in its forks, and through the bare branches the evening star\r\nquivered in the misty air. The long brown room breathed the peace of a\r\nrich and amply guarded quiet. Tea was brought in immediately and placed\r\nin front of the wood fire. Mrs. Alexander sat down in a high-backed\r\nchair and began to pour it, while Wilson sank into a low seat opposite\r\nher and took his cup with a great sense of ease and harmony and\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had a long journey, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Alexander asked, after\r\nshowing gracious concern about his tea. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am so sorry Bartley is\r\nlate. He\xe2\x80\x99s often tired when he\xe2\x80\x99s late. He flatters himself that it is a\r\nlittle on his account that you have come to this Congress of\r\nPsychologists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson assented, selecting his muffin carefully; \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope\r\nhe won\xe2\x80\x99t be tired tonight. But, on my own account, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to have a\r\nfew moments alone with you, before Bartley comes. I was somehow afraid\r\nthat my knowing him so well would not put me in the way of getting to\r\nknow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of you.\xe2\x80\x9d She nodded at him above her cup and smiled,\r\nbut there was a little formal tightness in her tone which had not been\r\nthere when she greeted him in the hall.\r\n\r\nWilson leaned forward. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I said something awkward? I live very far\r\nout of the world, you know. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you would exactly\r\nfade dim, even if Bartley were here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander laughed relentingly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not so vain! How terribly\r\ndiscerning you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked straight at Wilson, and he felt that this quick, frank\r\nglance brought about an understanding between them.\r\n\r\nHe liked everything about her, he told himself, but he particularly\r\nliked her eyes; when she looked at one directly for a moment they were\r\nlike a glimpse of fine windy sky that may bring all sorts of weather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you noticed something,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Alexander went on, \xe2\x80\x9cit must have\r\nbeen a flash of the distrust I have come to feel whenever I meet any of\r\nthe people who knew Bartley when he was a boy. It is always as if they\r\nwere talking of someone I had never met. Really, Professor Wilson, it\r\nwould seem that he grew up among the strangest people. They usually say\r\nthat he has turned out very well, or remark that he always was a fine\r\nfellow. I never know what reply to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson chuckled and leaned back in his chair, shaking his left foot\r\ngently. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect the fact is that we none of us knew him very well,\r\nMrs. Alexander. Though I will say for myself that I was always\r\nconfident he\xe2\x80\x99d do something extraordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders gave a slight movement, suggestive of\r\nimpatience. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I should think that might have been a safe prediction.\r\nAnother cup, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank you. But predicting, in the case of boys, is not so easy as\r\nyou might imagine, Mrs. Alexander. Some get a bad hurt early and lose\r\ntheir courage; and some never get a fair wind. Bartley\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he dropped his\r\nchin on the back of his long hand and looked at her admiringly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBartley\r\ncaught the wind early, and it has sung in his sails ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander sat looking into the fire with intent preoccupation, and\r\nWilson studied her half-averted face. He liked the suggestion of stormy\r\npossibilities in the proud curve of her lip and nostril. Without that,\r\nhe reflected, she would be too cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know what he was really like when he was a boy. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe he remembers,\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you smoke, Mr.\r\nWilson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson lit a cigarette. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he does. He was never\r\nintrospective. He was simply the most tremendous response to stimuli I\r\nhave ever known. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what to do with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA servant came in and noiselessly removed the tea-tray. Mrs. Alexander\r\nscreened her face from the firelight, which was beginning to throw\r\nwavering bright spots on her dress and hair as the dusk deepened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI now and again hear stories about things that\r\nhappened when he was in college.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that isn\xe2\x80\x99t what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson wrinkled his brows and looked at\r\nher with the smiling familiarity that had come about so quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nyou want is a picture of him, standing back there at the other end of\r\ntwenty years. You want to look down through my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dropped her hands in her lap. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\r\nwant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment they heard the front door shut with a jar, and Wilson\r\nlaughed as Mrs. Alexander rose quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere he is. Away with\r\nperspective! No past, no future for Bartley; just the fiery moment. The\r\nonly moment that ever was or will be in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door from the hall opened, a voice called \xe2\x80\x9cWinifred?\xe2\x80\x9d hurriedly,\r\nand a big man came through the drawing-room with a quick, heavy tread,\r\nbringing with him a smell of cigar smoke and chill out-of-doors air.\r\nWhen Alexander reached the library door, he switched on the lights and\r\nstood six feet and more in the archway, glowing with strength and\r\ncordiality and rugged, blond good looks. There were other\r\nbridge-builders in the world, certainly, but it was always Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npicture that the Sunday Supplement men wanted, because he looked as a\r\ntamer of rivers ought to look. Under his tumbled sandy hair his head\r\nseemed as hard and powerful as a catapult, and his shoulders looked\r\nstrong enough in themselves to support a span of any one of his ten\r\ngreat bridges that cut the air above as many rivers.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Alexander took Wilson up to his study. It was a large room\r\nover the library, and looked out upon the black river and the row of\r\nwhite lights along the Cambridge Embankment. The room was not at all\r\nwhat one might expect of an engineer\xe2\x80\x99s study. Wilson felt at once the\r\nharmony of beautiful things that have lived long together without\r\nobtrusions of ugliness or change. It was none of Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s doing, of\r\ncourse; those warm consonances of color had been blending and mellowing\r\nbefore he was born. But the wonder was that he was not out of place\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x94that it all seemed to glow like the inevitable background for\r\nhis vigor and vehemence. He sat before the fire, his shoulders deep in\r\nthe cushions of his chair, his powerful head upright, his hair rumpled\r\nabove his broad forehead. He sat heavily, a cigar in his large, smooth\r\nhand, a flush of after-dinner color in his face, which wind and sun and\r\nexposure to all sorts of weather had left fair and clear-skinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are off for England on Saturday, Bartley, Mrs. Alexander tells\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for a few weeks only. There\xe2\x80\x99s a meeting of British engineers, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m doing another bridge in Canada, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, every one knows about that. And it was in Canada that you met your\r\nwife, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, at Allway. She was visiting her great-aunt there. A most\r\nremarkable old lady. I was working with MacKeller then, an old Scotch\r\nengineer who had picked me up in London and taken me back to Quebec\r\nwith him. He had the contract for the Allway Bridge, but before he\r\nbegan work on it he found out that he was going to die, and he advised\r\nthe committee to turn the job over to me. Otherwise I\xe2\x80\x99d never have got\r\nanything good so early. MacKeller was an old friend of Mrs. Pemberton,\r\nWinifred\xe2\x80\x99s aunt. He had mentioned me to her, so when I went to Allway\r\nshe asked me to come to see her. She was a wonderful old lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike her niece?\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson queried.\r\n\r\nBartley laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had been very handsome, but not in Winifred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway. When I knew her she was little and fragile, very pink and white,\r\nwith a splendid head and a face like fine old lace, somehow,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nperhaps I always think of that because she wore a lace scarf on her\r\nhair. She had such a flavor of life about her. She had known Gordon and\r\nLivingstone and Beaconsfield when she was young,\xe2\x80\x94every one. She was the\r\nfirst woman of that sort I\xe2\x80\x99d ever known. You know how it is in the\r\nWest,\xe2\x80\x94old people are poked out of the way. Aunt Eleanor fascinated me\r\nas few young women have ever done. I used to go up from the works to\r\nhave tea with her, and sit talking to her for hours. It was very\r\nstimulating, for she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate stupidity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been then that your luck began, Bartley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson,\r\nflicking his cigar ash with his long finger. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s curious, watching\r\nboys,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I did you justice in the\r\nmatter of ability. Yet I always used to feel that there was a weak spot\r\nwhere some day strain would tell. Even after you began to climb, I\r\nstood down in the crowd and watched you with\xe2\x80\x94well, not with confidence.\r\nThe more dazzling the front you presented, the higher your facade rose,\r\nthe more I expected to see a big crack zigzagging from top to\r\nbottom,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he indicated its course in the air with his forefinger,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthen\r\na crash and clouds of dust. It was curious. I had such a clear picture\r\nof it. And another curious thing, Bartley,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson spoke with\r\ndeliberateness and settled deeper into his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cis that I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\r\nit any longer. I am sure of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! It\xe2\x80\x99s not I you feel sure of; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nWinifred. People often make that mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m serious, Alexander. You\xe2\x80\x99ve changed. You have decided to leave\r\nsome birds in the bushes. You used to want them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander\xe2\x80\x99s chair creaked. \xe2\x80\x9cI still want a good many,\xe2\x80\x9d he said rather\r\ngloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer a man much. You work like the\r\ndevil and think you\xe2\x80\x99re getting on, and suddenly you discover that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve only been getting yourself tied up. A million details drink you\r\ndry. Your life keeps going for things you don\xe2\x80\x99t want, and all the while\r\nyou are being built alive into a social structure you don\xe2\x80\x99t care a rap\r\nabout. I sometimes wonder what sort of chap I\xe2\x80\x99d have been if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen this sort; I want to go and live out his potentialities, too. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten that there are birds in the bushes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley stopped and sat frowning into the fire, his shoulders thrust\r\nforward as if he were about to spring at something. Wilson watched him,\r\nwondering. His old pupil always stimulated him at first, and then\r\nvastly wearied him. The machinery was always pounding away in this man,\r\nand Wilson preferred companions of a more reflective habit of mind. He\r\ncould not help feeling that there were unreasoning and unreasonable\r\nactivities going on in Alexander all the while; that even after dinner,\r\nwhen most men achieve a decent impersonality, Bartley had merely closed\r\nthe door of the engine-room and come up for an airing. The machinery\r\nitself was still pounding on.\r\n\r\nBartley\xe2\x80\x99s abstraction and Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s reflections were cut short by a\r\nrustle at the door, and almost before they could rise Mrs. Alexander\r\nwas standing by the hearth. Alexander brought a chair for her, but she\r\nshook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear, thank you. I only came in to see whether you and Professor\r\nWilson were quite comfortable. I am going down to the music-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not practice here? Wilson and I are growing very dull. We are\r\ntired of talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I beg you, Mrs. Alexander,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson began, but he got no further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t find me too noisy. I am working on the\r\nSchumann \xe2\x80\x98Carnival,\xe2\x80\x99 and, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t practice a great many hours, I\r\nam very methodical,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Alexander explained, as she crossed to an\r\nupright piano that stood at the back of the room, near the windows.\r\n\r\nWilson followed, and, having seen her seated, dropped into a chair\r\nbehind her. She played brilliantly and with great musical feeling.\r\nWilson could not imagine her permitting herself to do anything badly,\r\nbut he was surprised at the cleanness of her execution. He wondered how\r\na woman with so many duties had managed to keep herself up to a\r\nstandard really professional. It must take a great deal of time,\r\ncertainly, and Bartley must take a great deal of time. Wilson reflected\r\nthat he had never before known a woman who had been able, for any\r\nconsiderable while, to support both a personal and an intellectual\r\npassion. Sitting behind her, he watched her with perplexed admiration,\r\nshading his eyes with his hand. In her dinner dress she looked even\r\nyounger than in street clothes, and, for all her composure and\r\nself-sufficiency, she seemed to him strangely alert and vibrating, as\r\nif in her, too, there were something never altogether at rest. He felt\r\nthat he knew pretty much what she demanded in people and what she\r\ndemanded from life, and he wondered how she squared Bartley. After ten\r\nyears she must know him; and however one took him, however much one\r\nadmired him, one had to admit that he simply wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t square. He was a\r\nnatural force, certainly, but beyond that, Wilson felt, he was not\r\nanything very really or for very long at a time.\r\n\r\nWilson glanced toward the fire, where Bartley\xe2\x80\x99s profile was still\r\nwreathed in cigar smoke that curled up more and more slowly. His\r\nshoulders were sunk deep in the cushions and one hand hung large and\r\npassive over the arm of his chair. He had slipped on a purple velvet\r\nsmoking-coat. His wife, Wilson surmised, had chosen it. She was clearly\r\nvery proud of his good looks and his fine color. But, with the glow of\r\nan immediate interest gone out of it, the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s face looked tired,\r\neven a little haggard. The three lines in his forehead, directly above\r\nthe nose, deepened as he sat thinking, and his powerful head drooped\r\nforward heavily. Although Alexander was only forty-three, Wilson\r\nthought that beneath his vigorous color he detected the dulling\r\nweariness of on-coming middle age.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, at the hour when the river was beginning to redden\r\nunder the declining sun, Wilson again found himself facing Mrs.\r\nAlexander at the tea-table in the library.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, when he was bidden to give an account of himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere was a long morning with the psychologists, luncheon with Bartley\r\nat his club, more psychologists, and here I am. I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked forward to\r\nthis hour all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander smiled at him across the vapor from the kettle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do\r\nyou remember where we stopped yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly. I was going to show you a picture. But I doubt whether I\r\nhave color enough in me. Bartley makes me feel a faded monochrome. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get at the young Bartley except by means of color.\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson paused\r\nand deliberated. Suddenly he broke out: \xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a remarkable\r\nstudent, you know, though he was always strong in higher mathematics.\r\nHis work in my own department was quite ordinary. It was as a\r\npowerfully equipped nature that I found him interesting. That is the\r\nmost interesting thing a teacher can find. It has the fascination of a\r\nscientific discovery. We come across other pleasing and endearing\r\nqualities so much oftener than we find force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Alexander, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the thing we all live\r\nupon. It is the thing that takes us forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson thought she spoke a little wistfully. \xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d he assented\r\nwarmly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt builds the bridges into the future, over which the feet of\r\nevery one of us will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow interested I am to hear you put it in that way. The bridges into\r\nthe future\xe2\x80\x94I often say that to myself. Bartley\xe2\x80\x99s bridges always seem to\r\nme like that. Have you ever seen his first suspension bridge in Canada,\r\nthe one he was doing when I first knew him? I hope you will see it\r\nsometime. We were married as soon as it was finished, and you will\r\nlaugh when I tell you that it always has a rather bridal look to me. It\r\nis over the wildest river, with mists and clouds always battling about\r\nit, and it is as delicate as a cobweb hanging in the sky. It really was\r\na bridge into the future. You have only to look at it to feel that it\r\nmeant the beginning of a great career. But I have a photograph of it\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew a portfolio from behind a bookcase. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there, you\r\nsee, on the hill, is my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson took up the photograph. \xe2\x80\x9cBartley was telling me something about\r\nyour aunt last night. She must have been a delightful person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinifred laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bridge, you see, was just at the foot of the\r\nhill, and the noise of the engines annoyed her very much at first. But\r\nafter she met Bartley she pretended to like it, and said it was a good\r\nthing to be reminded that there were things going on in the world. She\r\nloved life, and Bartley brought a great deal of it in to her when he\r\ncame to the house. Aunt Eleanor was very worldly in a frank,\r\nEarly-Victorian manner. She liked men of action, and disliked young men\r\nwho were careful of themselves and who, as she put it, were always\r\ntrimming their wick as if they were afraid of their oil\xe2\x80\x99s giving out.\r\nMacKeller, Bartley\xe2\x80\x99s first chief, was an old friend of my aunt, and he\r\ntold her that Bartley was a wild, ill-governed youth, which really\r\npleased her very much. I remember we were sitting alone in the dusk\r\nafter Bartley had been there for the first time. I knew that Aunt\r\nEleanor had found him much to her taste, but she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything.\r\nPresently she came out, with a chuckle: \xe2\x80\x98MacKeller found him sowing\r\nwild oats in London, I believe. I hope he didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop him too soon.\r\nLife coquets with dashing fellows. The coming men are always like that.\r\nWe must have him to dinner, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99 And we did. She grew much fonder\r\nof Bartley than she was of me. I had been studying in Vienna, and she\r\nthought that absurd. She was interested in the army and in politics,\r\nand she had a great contempt for music and art and philosophy. She used\r\nto declare that the Prince Consort had brought all that stuff over out\r\nof Germany. She always sniffed when Bartley asked me to play for him.\r\nShe considered that a newfangled way of making a match of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander came in a few moments later, he found Wilson and his\r\nwife still confronting the photograph. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, let us get that out of the\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWinifred, Thomas can bring my trunk down.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to go over to New York to-morrow night and take a fast\r\nboat. I shall save two days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of his arrival in London, Alexander went immediately to\r\nthe hotel on the Embankment at which he always stopped, and in the\r\nlobby he was accosted by an old acquaintance, Maurice Mainhall, who\r\nfell upon him with effusive cordiality and indicated a willingness to\r\ndine with him. Bartley never dined alone if he could help it, and\r\nMainhall was a good gossip who always knew what had been going on in\r\ntown; especially, he knew everything that was not printed in the\r\nnewspapers. The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists,\r\nMainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and\r\nits outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them. He had\r\nwritten a number of books himself; among them a \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Dancing,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Costume,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cKey to Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Sonnets,\xe2\x80\x9d a study of \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nPoetry of Ernest Dowson,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. Although Mainhall\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm was often\r\ntiresome, and although he was often unable to distinguish between facts\r\nand vivid figments of his imagination, his imperturbable good nature\r\novercame even the people whom he bored most, so that they ended by\r\nbecoming, in a reluctant manner, his friends. In appearance, Mainhall\r\nwas astonishingly like the conventional stage-Englishman of American\r\ndrama: tall and thin, with high, hitching shoulders and a small head\r\nglistening with closely brushed yellow hair. He spoke with an extreme\r\nOxford accent, and when he was talking well, his face sometimes wore\r\nthe rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music.\r\nMainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer. He had\r\npreconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was\r\nthat they should be engineers or mechanics. He hated them when they\r\npresumed to be anything else.\r\n\r\nWhile they sat at dinner Mainhall acquainted Bartley with the fortunes\r\nof his old friends in London, and as they left the table he proposed\r\nthat they should go to see Hugh MacConnell\xe2\x80\x99s new comedy, \xe2\x80\x9cBog Lights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really quite the best thing MacConnell\xe2\x80\x99s done,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained as\r\nthey got into a hansom. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tremendously well put on, too. Florence\r\nMerrill and Cyril Henderson. But Hilda Burgoyne\xe2\x80\x99s the hit of the piece.\r\nHugh\xe2\x80\x99s written a delightful part for her, and she\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\ninexpressible. It\xe2\x80\x99s been on only two weeks, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been half a dozen\r\ntimes already. I happen to have MacConnell\xe2\x80\x99s box for tonight or there\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe no chance of our getting places. There\xe2\x80\x99s everything in seeing Hilda\r\nwhile she\xe2\x80\x99s fresh in a part. She\xe2\x80\x99s apt to grow a bit stale after a\r\ntime. The ones who have any imagination do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHilda Burgoyne!\xe2\x80\x9d Alexander exclaimed mildly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of\r\nher for\xe2\x80\x94years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMainhall laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you can\xe2\x80\x99t have heard much at all, my dear\r\nAlexander. It\xe2\x80\x99s only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold\r\nof her, that she\xe2\x80\x99s come up. Myself, I always knew she had it in her. If\r\nwe had one real critic in London\xe2\x80\x94but what can one expect? Do you know,\r\nAlexander,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the\r\nhansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdo you know,\r\nI sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself. In a way, it\r\nwould be a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then they drove up to the Duke of York\xe2\x80\x99s, so Alexander did not\r\ncommit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre. When they\r\nentered the stage-box on the left the first act was well under way, the\r\nscene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland. As they\r\nsat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the stage.\r\nMiss Burgoyne and her donkey were thrusting their heads in at the half\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s small probability of her\r\nrecognizing me. She doubtless hasn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of me for years.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt\r\nthe enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught\r\nup by the current of MacConnell\xe2\x80\x99s irresistible comedy. The audience had\r\ncome forewarned, evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a\r\ndonkey-girl ran upon the stage there was a deep murmur of approbation,\r\nevery one smiled and glowed, and Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a\r\nlittle nearer the brass railing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured in Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s ear, as the curtain fell on the\r\nfirst act, \xe2\x80\x9cone almost never sees a part like that done without\r\nsmartness or mawkishness. Of course, Hilda is Irish,\xe2\x80\x94the Burgoynes have\r\nbeen stage people for generations,\xe2\x80\x94and she has the Irish voice. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelightful to hear it in a London theatre. That laugh, now, when she\r\ndoubles over at the hips\xe2\x80\x94who ever heard it out of Galway? She saves her\r\nhand, too. She\xe2\x80\x99s at her best in the second act. She\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nMacConnell\xe2\x80\x99s poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy\r\ntale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe second act opened before Philly Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s underground still, with\r\nPeggy and her battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of potheen\r\nacross the bog, and to bring Philly word of what was doing in the world\r\nwithout, and of what was happening along the roadsides and ditches with\r\nthe first gleam of fine weather. Alexander, annoyed by Mainhall\xe2\x80\x99s sighs\r\nand exclamations, watched her with keen, half-skeptical interest. As\r\nMainhall had said, she was the second act; the plot and feeling alike\r\ndepended upon her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the\r\nshrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately, and sometimes\r\ntogether, in her mirthful brown eyes. When she began to dance, by way\r\nof showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night,\r\nthe house broke into a prolonged uproar. After her dance she withdrew\r\nfrom the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of Philly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nburrow, where she sat singing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rising of the Moon\xe2\x80\x9d and making a\r\nwreath of primroses for her donkey.\r\n\r\nWhen the act was over Alexander and Mainhall strolled out into the\r\ncorridor. They met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew\r\nalmost every one, and he babbled on incontinently, screwing his small\r\nhead about over his high collar. Presently he hailed a tall, bearded\r\nman, grim-browed and rather battered-looking, who had his opera cloak\r\non his arm and his hat in his hand, and who seemed to be on the point\r\nof leaving the theatre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMacConnell, let me introduce Mr. Bartley Alexander. I say! It\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nfamously to-night, Mac. And what an audience! You\xe2\x80\x99ll never do anything\r\nlike this again, mark me. A man writes to the top of his bent only\r\nonce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep-set faded\r\neyes and made a wry face. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd have I done anything so fool as that,\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I was saying,\xe2\x80\x9d Mainhall lounged a little nearer and\r\ndropped into a tone even more conspicuously confidential. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever bring Hilda out like this again. Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npossibly be better, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMacConnell grunted. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll do well enough if she keeps her pace and\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t go off on us in the middle of the season, as she\xe2\x80\x99s more than\r\nlike to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Hugh,\xe2\x80\x9d Mainhall murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s hit terribly hard. He\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nwanting to marry Hilda these three years and more. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take up\r\nwith anybody, you know. Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in\r\nconfidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.\r\nOne of your countrymen, Alexander, by the way; an American student whom\r\nshe met in Paris, I believe. I dare say it\xe2\x80\x99s quite true that there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnever been any one else.\xe2\x80\x9d Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a\r\nloftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid\r\nexcitement was tingling through him. Blinking up at the lights,\r\nMainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s an elegant little\r\nperson, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that.\r\nHere comes Sir Harry Towne. He\xe2\x80\x99s another who\xe2\x80\x99s awfully keen about her.\r\nLet me introduce you. Sir Harry Towne, Mr. Bartley Alexander, the\r\nAmerican engineer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met Mr. Alexander and his\r\nwife in Tokyo.\r\n\r\nMainhall cut in impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Sir Harry, the little girl\xe2\x80\x99s going famously to-night, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Harry wrinkled his brows judiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, I thought the\r\ndance a bit conscious to-night, for the first time. The fact is, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeeling rather seedy, poor child. Westmere and I were back after the\r\nfirst act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself. A\r\nlittle attack of nerves, possibly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nLord Westmere, of course,\xe2\x80\x94the stooped man with the long gray mustache,\r\ntalking to Lady Dowle. Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they reached their box the house was darkened and the orchestra\r\nwas playing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cloak of Old Gaul.\xe2\x80\x9d In a moment Peggy was on the stage\r\nagain, and Alexander applauded vigorously with the rest. He even leaned\r\nforward over the rail a little. For some reason he felt pleased and\r\nflattered by the enthusiasm of the audience. In the half-light he\r\nlooked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously,\r\nrecalling with amusement Sir Harry\xe2\x80\x99s judicial frown. He was beginning\r\nto feel a keen interest in the slender, barefoot donkey-girl who\r\nslipped in and out of the play, singing, like some one winding through\r\na hilly field. He leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as\r\nMainhall himself when, at the end of the play, she came again and again\r\nbefore the curtain, panting a little and flushed, her eyes dancing and\r\nher eager, nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander returned to his hotel\xe2\x80\x94he shook Mainhall at the door of\r\nthe theatre\xe2\x80\x94he had some supper brought up to his room, and it was late\r\nbefore he went to bed. He had not thought of Hilda Burgoyne for years;\r\nindeed, he had almost forgotten her. He had last written to her from\r\nCanada, after he first met Winifred, telling her that everything was\r\nchanged with him\xe2\x80\x94that he had met a woman whom he would marry if he\r\ncould; if he could not, then all the more was everything changed for\r\nhim. Hilda had never replied to his letter. He felt guilty and unhappy\r\nabout her for a time, but after Winifred promised to marry him he\r\nreally forgot Hilda altogether. When he wrote her that everything was\r\nchanged for him, he was telling the truth. After he met Winifred\r\nPemberton he seemed to himself like a different man. One night when he\r\nand Winifred were sitting together on the bridge, he told her that\r\nthings had happened while he was studying abroad that he was sorry\r\nfor,\xe2\x80\x94one thing in particular,\xe2\x80\x94and he asked her whether she thought she\r\nought to know about them. She considered a moment and then said \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\r\nthink not, though I am glad you ask me. You see, one can\xe2\x80\x99t be jealous\r\nabout things in general; but about particular, definite, personal\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here she had thrown her hands up to his shoulders with a\r\nquick, impulsive gesture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9coh, about those I should be very jealous. I\r\nshould torture myself\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d After that it was easy to\r\nforget, actually to forget. He wondered to-night, as he poured his\r\nwine, how many times he had thought of Hilda in the last ten years. He\r\nhad been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the same,\xe2\x80\x9d he lifted his glass, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s to you, little Hilda.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made things come your way, and I never thought you\xe2\x80\x99d do it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cshe always had that combination of\r\nsomething homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft. But\r\nI never thought she\xe2\x80\x99d do anything. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t much ambition then, and\r\nshe was too fond of trifles. She must care about the theatre a great\r\ndeal more than she used to. Perhaps she has me to thank for something,\r\nafter all. Sometimes a little jolt like that does one good. She was a\r\ndaft, generous little thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad she\xe2\x80\x99s held her own since. After\r\nall, we were awfully young. It was youth and poverty and proximity, and\r\neverything was young and kindly. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if she could laugh\r\nabout it with me now. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder\xe2\x80\x94 But they\xe2\x80\x99ve probably spoiled\r\nher, so that she\xe2\x80\x99d be tiresome if one met her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next evening Alexander dined alone at a club, and at about nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock he dropped in at the Duke of York\xe2\x80\x99s. The house was sold out and\r\nhe stood through the second act. When he returned to his hotel he\r\nexamined the new directory, and found Miss Burgoyne\xe2\x80\x99s address still\r\ngiven as off Bedford Square, though at a new number. He remembered\r\nthat, in so far as she had been brought up at all, she had been brought\r\nup in Bloomsbury. Her father and mother played in the provinces most of\r\nthe year, and she was left a great deal in the care of an old aunt who\r\nwas crippled by rheumatism and who had had to leave the stage\r\naltogether. In the days when Alexander knew her, Hilda always managed\r\nto have a lodging of some sort about Bedford Square, because she clung\r\ntenaciously to such scraps and shreds of memories as were connected\r\nwith it. The mummy room of the British Museum had been one of the chief\r\ndelights of her childhood. That forbidding pile was the goal of her\r\ntruant fancy, and she was sometimes taken there for a treat, as other\r\nchildren are taken to the theatre. It was long since Alexander had\r\nthought of any of these things, but now they came back to him quite\r\nfresh, and had a significance they did not have when they were first\r\ntold him in his restless twenties. So she was still in the old\r\nneighborhood, near Bedford Square. The new number probably meant\r\nincreased prosperity. He hoped so. He would like to know that she was\r\nsnugly settled. He looked at his watch. It was a quarter past ten; she\r\nwould not be home for a good two hours yet, and he might as well walk\r\nover and have a look at the place. He remembered the shortest way.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm, smoky evening, and there was a grimy moon. He went\r\nthrough Covent Garden to Oxford Street, and as he turned into Museum\r\nStreet he walked more slowly, smiling at his own nervousness as he\r\napproached the sullen gray mass at the end. He had not been inside the\r\nMuseum, actually, since he and Hilda used to meet there; sometimes to\r\nset out for gay adventures at Twickenham or Richmond, sometimes to\r\nlinger about the place for a while and to ponder by Lord Elgin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarbles upon the lastingness of some things, or, in the mummy room,\r\nupon the awful brevity of others. Since then Bartley had always thought\r\nof the British Museum as the ultimate repository of mortality, where\r\nall the dead things in the world were assembled to make one\xe2\x80\x99s hour of\r\nyouth the more precious. One trembled lest before he got out it might\r\nsomehow escape him, lest he might drop the glass from over-eagerness\r\nand see it shivered on the stone floor at his feet. How one hid his\r\nyouth under his coat and hugged it! And how good it was to turn one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback upon all that vaulted cold, to take Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s arm and hurry out of\r\nthe great door and down the steps into the sunlight among the\r\npigeons\xe2\x80\x94to know that the warm and vital thing within him was still\r\nthere and had not been snatched away to flush C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s lean cheek or to\r\nfeed the veins of some bearded Assyrian king. They in their day had\r\ncarried the flaming liquor, but to-day was his! So the song used to run\r\nin his head those summer mornings a dozen years ago. Alexander walked\r\nby the place very quietly, as if he were afraid of waking some one.\r\n\r\nHe crossed Bedford Square and found the number he was looking for. The\r\nhouse, a comfortable, well-kept place enough, was dark except for the\r\nfour front windows on the second floor, where a low, even light was\r\nburning behind the white muslin sash curtains. Outside there were\r\nwindow boxes, painted white and full of flowers. Bartley was making a\r\nthird round of the Square when he heard the far-flung hoof-beats of a\r\nhansom-cab horse, driven rapidly. He looked at his watch, and was\r\nastonished to find that it was a few minutes after twelve. He turned\r\nand walked back along the iron railing as the cab came up to Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnumber and stopped. The hansom must have been one that she employed\r\nregularly, for she did not stop to pay the driver. She stepped out\r\nquickly and lightly. He heard her cheerful \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, cabby,\xe2\x80\x9d as she\r\nran up the steps and opened the door with a latchkey. In a few moments\r\nthe lights flared up brightly behind the white curtains, and as he\r\nwalked away he heard a window raised. But he had gone too far to look\r\nup without turning round. He went back to his hotel, feeling that he\r\nhad had a good evening, and he slept well.\r\n\r\nFor the next few days Alexander was very busy. He took a desk in the\r\noffice of a Scotch engineering firm on Henrietta Street, and was at\r\nwork almost constantly. He avoided the clubs and usually dined alone at\r\nhis hotel. One afternoon, after he had tea, he started for a walk down\r\nthe Embankment toward Westminster, intending to end his stroll at\r\nBedford Square and to ask whether Miss Burgoyne would let him take her\r\nto the theatre. But he did not go so far. When he reached the Abbey, he\r\nturned back and crossed Westminster Bridge and sat down to watch the\r\ntrails of smoke behind the Houses of Parliament catch fire with the\r\nsunset. The slender towers were washed by a rain of golden light and\r\nlicked by little flickering flames; Somerset House and the bleached\r\ngray pinnacles about Whitehall were floated in a luminous haze. The\r\nyellow light poured through the trees and the leaves seemed to burn\r\nwith soft fires. There was a smell of acacias in the air everywhere,\r\nand the laburnums were dripping gold over the walls of the gardens. It\r\nwas a sweet, lonely kind of summer evening. Remembering Hilda as she\r\nused to be, was doubtless more satisfactory than seeing her as she must\r\nbe now\xe2\x80\x94and, after all, Alexander asked himself, what was it but his own\r\nyoung years that he was remembering?\r\n\r\nHe crossed back to Westminster, went up to the Temple, and sat down to\r\nsmoke in the Middle Temple gardens, listening to the thin voice of the\r\nfountain and smelling the spice of the sycamores that came out heavily\r\nin the damp evening air. He thought, as he sat there, about a great\r\nmany things: about his own youth and Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s; above all, he thought of\r\nhow glorious it had been, and how quickly it had passed; and, when it\r\nhad passed, how little worth while anything was. None of the things he\r\nhad gained in the least compensated. In the last six years his\r\nreputation had become, as the saying is, popular. Four years ago he had\r\nbeen called to Japan to deliver, at the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s request, a course of\r\nlectures at the Imperial University, and had instituted reforms\r\nthroughout the islands, not only in the practice of bridge-building but\r\nin drainage and road-making. On his return he had undertaken the bridge\r\nat Moorlock, in Canada, the most important piece of bridge-building\r\ngoing on in the world,\xe2\x80\x94a test, indeed, of how far the latest practice\r\nin bridge structure could be carried. It was a spectacular undertaking\r\nby reason of its very size, and Bartley realized that, whatever else he\r\nmight do, he would probably always be known as the engineer who\r\ndesigned the great Moorlock Bridge, the longest cantilever in\r\nexistence. Yet it was to him the least satisfactory thing he had ever\r\ndone. He was cramped in every way by a niggardly commission, and was\r\nusing lighter structural material than he thought proper. He had\r\nvexations enough, too, with his work at home. He had several bridges\r\nunder way in the United States, and they were always being held up by\r\nstrikes and delays resulting from a general industrial unrest.\r\n\r\nThough Alexander often told himself he had never put more into his work\r\nthan he had done in the last few years, he had to admit that he had\r\nnever got so little out of it. He was paying for success, too, in the\r\ndemands made on his time by boards of civic enterprise and committees\r\nof public welfare. The obligations imposed by his wife\xe2\x80\x99s fortune and\r\nposition were sometimes distracting to a man who followed his\r\nprofession, and he was expected to be interested in a great many worthy\r\nendeavors on her account as well as on his own. His existence was\r\nbecoming a network of great and little details. He had expected that\r\nsuccess would bring him freedom and power; but it had brought only\r\npower that was in itself another kind of restraint. He had always meant\r\nto keep his personal liberty at all costs, as old MacKeller, his first\r\nchief, had done, and not, like so many American engineers, to become a\r\npart of a professional movement, a cautious board member, a Nestor _de\r\npontibus_. He happened to be engaged in work of public utility, but he\r\nwas not willing to become what is called a public man. He found himself\r\nliving exactly the kind of life he had determined to escape. What, he\r\nasked himself, did he want with these genial honors and substantial\r\ncomforts? Hardships and difficulties he had carried lightly; overwork\r\nhad not exhausted him; but this dead calm of middle life which\r\nconfronted him,\xe2\x80\x94of that he was afraid. He was not ready for it. It was\r\nlike being buried alive. In his youth he would not have believed such a\r\nthing possible. The one thing he had really wanted all his life was to\r\nbe free; and there was still something unconquered in him, something\r\nbesides the strong work-horse that his profession had made of him. He\r\nfelt rich to-night in the possession of that unstultified survival; in\r\nthe light of his experience, it was more precious than honors or\r\nachievement. In all those busy, successful years there had been nothing\r\nso good as this hour of wild light-heartedness. This feeling was the\r\nonly happiness that was real to him, and such hours were the only ones\r\nin which he could feel his own continuous identity\xe2\x80\x94feel the boy he had\r\nbeen in the rough days of the old West, feel the youth who had worked\r\nhis way across the ocean on a cattle-ship and gone to study in Paris\r\nwithout a dollar in his pocket. The man who sat in his offices in\r\nBoston was only a powerful machine. Under the activities of that\r\nmachine the person who, in such moments as this, he felt to be himself,\r\nwas fading and dying. He remembered how, when he was a little boy and\r\nhis father called him in the morning, he used to leap from his bed into\r\nthe full consciousness of himself. That consciousness was Life itself.\r\nWhatever took its place, action, reflection, the power of concentrated\r\nthought, were only functions of a mechanism useful to society; things\r\nthat could be bought in the market. There was only one thing that had\r\nan absolute value for each individual, and it was just that original\r\nimpulse, that internal heat, that feeling of one\xe2\x80\x99s self in one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander walked back to his hotel, the red and green lights were\r\nblinking along the docks on the farther shore, and the soft white stars\r\nwere shining in the wide sky above the river.\r\n\r\nThe next night, and the next, Alexander repeated this same foolish\r\nperformance. It was always Miss Burgoyne whom he started out to find,\r\nand he got no farther than the Temple gardens and the Embankment. It\r\nwas a pleasant kind of loneliness. To a man who was so little given to\r\nreflection, whose dreams always took the form of definite ideas,\r\nreaching into the future, there was a seductive excitement in renewing\r\nold experiences in imagination. He started out upon these walks half\r\nguiltily, with a curious longing and expectancy which were wholly\r\ngratified by solitude. Solitude, but not solitariness; for he walked\r\nshoulder to shoulder with a shadowy companion\xe2\x80\x94not little Hilda\r\nBurgoyne, by any means, but some one vastly dearer to him than she had\r\never been\xe2\x80\x94his own young self, the youth who had waited for him upon the\r\nsteps of the British Museum that night, and who, though he had tried to\r\npass so quietly, had known him and come down and linked an arm in his.\r\n\r\nIt was not until long afterward that Alexander learned that for him\r\nthis youth was the most dangerous of companions.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday evening, at Lady Walford\xe2\x80\x99s, Alexander did at last meet Hilda\r\nBurgoyne. Mainhall had told him that she would probably be there. He\r\nlooked about for her rather nervously, and finally found her at the\r\nfarther end of the large drawing-room, the centre of a circle of men,\r\nyoung and old. She was apparently telling them a story. They were all\r\nlaughing and bending toward her. When she saw Alexander, she rose\r\nquickly and put out her hand. The other men drew back a little to let\r\nhim approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Alexander! I am delighted. Have you been in London long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley bowed, somewhat laboriously, over her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cLong enough to\r\nhave seen you more than once. How fine it all is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed as if she were pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you think so. I like it.\r\nWon\xe2\x80\x99t you join us here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Burgoyne was just telling us about a donkey-boy she had in Galway\r\nlast summer,\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Harry Towne explained as the circle closed up again.\r\nLord Westmere stroked his long white mustache with his bloodless hand\r\nand looked at Alexander blankly. Hilda was a good story-teller. She was\r\nsitting on the edge of her chair, as if she had alighted there for a\r\nmoment only. Her primrose satin gown seemed like a soft sheath for her\r\nslender, supple figure, and its delicate color suited her white Irish\r\nskin and brown hair. Whatever she wore, people felt the charm of her\r\nactive, girlish body with its slender hips and quick, eager shoulders.\r\nAlexander heard little of the story, but he watched Hilda intently. She\r\nmust certainly, he reflected, be thirty, and he was honestly delighted\r\nto see that the years had treated her so indulgently. If her face had\r\nchanged at all, it was in a slight hardening of the mouth\xe2\x80\x94still eager\r\nenough to be very disconcerting at times, he felt\xe2\x80\x94and in an added air\r\nof self-possession and self-reliance. She carried her head, too, a\r\nlittle more resolutely.\r\n\r\nWhen the story was finished, Miss Burgoyne turned pointedly to\r\nAlexander, and the other men drifted away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I saw you in MacConnell\xe2\x80\x99s box with Mainhall one evening, but\r\nI supposed you had left town before this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him frankly and cordially, as if he were indeed merely an\r\nold friend whom she was glad to meet again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been mooning about here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda laughed gayly. \xe2\x80\x9cMooning! I see you mooning! You must be the\r\nbusiest man in the world. Time and success have done well by you, you\r\nknow. You\xe2\x80\x99re handsomer than ever and you\xe2\x80\x99ve gained a grand manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander blushed and bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cTime and success have been good friends\r\nto both of us. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you tremendously pleased with yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed again and shrugged her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, so-so. But I want to\r\nhear about you. Several years ago I read such a lot in the papers about\r\nthe wonderful things you did in Japan, and how the Emperor decorated\r\nyou. What was it, Commander of the Order of the Rising Sun? That sounds\r\nlike \xe2\x80\x98The Mikado.\xe2\x80\x99 And what about your new bridge\xe2\x80\x94in Canada, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s to be the longest one in the world and has some queer name I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley shook his head and smiled drolly. \xe2\x80\x9cSince when have you been\r\ninterested in bridges? Or have you learned to be interested in\r\neverything? And is that a part of success?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how absurd! As if I were not always interested!\xe2\x80\x9d Hilda exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think we won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about bridges here, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d Bartley\r\nlooked down at the toe of her yellow slipper which was tapping the rug\r\nimpatiently under the hem of her gown. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I wonder whether you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthink me impertinent if I asked you to let me come to see you sometime\r\nand tell you about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I? Ever so many people come on Sunday afternoons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. Mainhall offered to take me. But you must know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nin London several times within the last few years, and you might very\r\nwell think that just now is a rather inopportune time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe cut him short. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. One of the pleasantest things about\r\nsuccess is that it makes people want to look one up, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\r\nmean. I\xe2\x80\x99m like every one else\xe2\x80\x94more agreeable to meet when things are\r\ngoing well with me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose it gives me any pleasure to do\r\nsomething that people like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it? Oh, how fine it all is, your coming on like this! But I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to think it was because of that I wanted to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe spoke very seriously and looked down at the floor.\r\n\r\nHilda studied him in wide-eyed astonishment for a moment, and then\r\nbroke into a low, amused laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mr. Alexander, you have\r\nstrange delicacies. If you please, that is exactly why you wish to see\r\nme. We understand that, do we not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley looked ruffled and turned the seal ring on his little finger\r\nabout awkwardly.\r\n\r\nHilda leaned back in her chair, watching him indulgently out of her\r\nshrewd eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, but don\xe2\x80\x99t try to pose for me, or to\r\nbe anything but what you are. If you care to come, it\xe2\x80\x99s yourself I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe glad to see, and you thinking well of yourself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to wear a\r\ncloak of humility; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become you. Stalk in as you are and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake excuses. I\xe2\x80\x99m not accustomed to inquiring into the motives of my\r\nguests. That would hardly be safe, even for Lady Walford, in a great\r\nhouse like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSunday afternoon, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alexander, as she rose to join her\r\nhostess. \xe2\x80\x9cHow early may I come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand and flushed and laughed. He bent over it a little\r\nstiffly. She went away on Lady Walford\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and as he stood watching\r\nher yellow train glide down the long floor he looked rather sullen. He\r\nfelt that he had not come out of it very brilliantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne\xe2\x80\x99s invitation and\r\ncalled at her apartment. He found it a delightful little place and he\r\nmet charming people there. Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty\r\nand competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the\r\ntea. Alexander arrived early, and some twenty-odd people dropped in\r\nduring the course of the afternoon. Hugh MacConnell came with his\r\nsister, and stood about, managing his tea-cup awkwardly and watching\r\nevery one out of his deep-set, faded eyes. He seemed to have made a\r\nresolute effort at tidiness of attire, and his sister, a robust, florid\r\nwoman with a splendid joviality about her, kept eyeing his freshly\r\ncreased clothes apprehensively. It was not very long, indeed, before\r\nhis coat hung with a discouraged sag from his gaunt shoulders and his\r\nhair and beard were rumpled as if he had been out in a gale. His dry\r\nhumor went under a cloud of absent-minded kindliness which, Mainhall\r\nexplained, always overtook him here. He was never so witty or so sharp\r\nhere as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he behaved as if he were an\r\nelderly relative come in to a young girl\xe2\x80\x99s party.\r\n\r\nThe editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and Lady Kildare,\r\nthe Irish philanthropist, brought her young nephew, Robert Owen, who\r\nhad come up from Oxford, and who was visibly excited and gratified by\r\nhis first introduction to Miss Burgoyne. Hilda was very nice to him,\r\nand he sat on the edge of his chair, flushed with his conversational\r\nefforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar. Sarah\r\nFrost, the novelist, came with her husband, a very genial and placid\r\nold scholar who had become slightly deranged upon the subject of the\r\nfourth dimension. On other matters he was perfectly rational and he was\r\neasy and pleasing in conversation. He looked very much like Agassiz,\r\nand his wife, in her old-fashioned black silk dress, overskirted and\r\ntight-sleeved, reminded Alexander of the early pictures of Mrs.\r\nBrowning. Hilda seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and\r\nBartley himself was so pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse\r\nthat he took his leave when they did, and walked with them over to\r\nOxford Street, where they waited for their \xe2\x80\x98bus. They asked him to come\r\nto see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndear, unworldly little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the philosopher absently; \xe2\x80\x9cmore\r\nlike the stage people of my young days\xe2\x80\x94folk of simple manners. There\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t many such left. American tours have spoiled them, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\r\nThey have all grown very smart. Lamb wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care a great deal about\r\nmany of them, I fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon. He had\r\na long talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and\r\nhe left in a discontented state of mind. For the rest of the week he\r\nwas nervous and unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were\r\npreparing for immediate departure. On Thursday afternoon he cut short a\r\ncommittee meeting, jumped into a hansom, and drove to Bedford Square.\r\nHe sent up his card, but it came back to him with a message scribbled\r\nacross the front.\r\n\r\nSo sorry I can\xe2\x80\x99t see you.  Will you come and dine with me Sunday\r\nevening at half-past seven?\r\n\r\n\r\nH.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the\r\npretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him\r\nupstairs. Hilda was writing in her living-room, under the light of a\r\ntall desk lamp. Bartley recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn\r\nthat first evening at Lady Walford\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes\r\nof her canary slippers to her smoothly parted brown hair. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery, very pretty. Every one at Lady Walford\xe2\x80\x99s was looking at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda curtsied. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that why you think it pretty? I\xe2\x80\x99ve no need for fine\r\nclothes in Mac\xe2\x80\x99s play this time, so I can afford a few duddies for\r\nmyself. It\xe2\x80\x99s owing to that same chance, by the way, that I am able to\r\nask you to dinner. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need Marie to dress me this season, so she\r\nkeeps house for me, and my little Galway girl has gone home for a\r\nvisit. I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I\r\nremember you don\xe2\x80\x99t like English cookery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander walked about the room, looking at everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I\r\nthink this is. Where did you get those etchings? They\xe2\x80\x99re quite unusual,\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas. She is very\r\nmuch interested in the American artist who did them. They are all\r\nsketches made about the Villa d\xe2\x80\x99Este, you see. He painted that group of\r\ncypresses for the Salon, and it was bought for the Luxembourg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander walked over to the bookcases. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the air of the whole\r\nplace here that I like. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t got anything that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong.\r\nSeems to me it looks particularly well to-night. And you have so many\r\nflowers. I like these little yellow irises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRooms always look better by lamplight\xe2\x80\x94in London, at least. Though\r\nMarie is clean\xe2\x80\x94really clean, as the French are. Why do you look at the\r\nflowers so critically? Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden market\r\nyesterday morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alexander simply. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how glad I am to\r\nhave you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying\r\nsuch nice things about you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got awfully nice friends,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nhumbly, picking up a little jade elephant from her desk. \xe2\x80\x9cThose fellows\r\nare all very loyal, even Mainhall. They don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of any one else as\r\nthey do of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a neat little sum\r\nin the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway. It\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nworth much, but I love it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to save something every year,\r\nand that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor\r\nCousin Mike over bad seasons. He\xe2\x80\x99s that gifted, you know, but he will\r\ndrink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve traveled a bit, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dining-room,\xe2\x80\x9d Hilda explained, as she led the way, \xe2\x80\x9cis the tiniest\r\nplace you have ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a tiny room, hung all round with French prints, above which ran\r\na shelf full of china. Hilda saw Alexander look up at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly rare,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut some of it was my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s. Heaven knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all\r\nour wanderings, or in what baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t been stowed away. We always had our tea out of those blue cups\r\nwhen I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and\r\nsometimes on a trunk at the theatre\xe2\x80\x94queer theatres, for that matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful little dinner. There was watercress soup, and sole,\r\nand a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two\r\nsmall rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of\r\nwhich Bartley had always been very fond. He drank it appreciatively and\r\nremarked that there was still no other he liked so well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some champagne for you, too. I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink it myself, but I\r\nlike to see it behave when it\xe2\x80\x99s poured. There is nothing else that\r\nlooks so jolly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it so well as this.\xe2\x80\x9d Bartley held the\r\nyellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the\r\nglass slowly about. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have traveled, you say. Have you been in Paris\r\nmuch these late years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda lowered one of the candle-shades carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I go over\r\nto Paris often. There are few changes in the old Quarter. Dear old\r\nMadame Anger is dead\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I, though! I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry to hear it. How did her son turn out? I\r\nremember how she saved and scraped for him, and how he always lay abed\r\ntill ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He was the laziest fellow at the Beaux Arts; and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s saying a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is still clever and lazy. They say he is a good architect\r\nwhen he will work. He\xe2\x80\x99s a big, handsome creature, and he hates\r\nAmericans as much as ever. But Angel\xe2\x80\x94do you remember Angel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly. Did she ever get back to Brittany and her _bains de mer?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no. Poor Angel! She got tired of cooking and scouring the coppers\r\nin Madame Anger\xe2\x80\x99s little kitchen, so she ran away with a soldier, and\r\nthen with another soldier. Too bad! She still lives about the Quarter,\r\nand, though there is always a _soldat_, she has become a _blanchisseuse\r\nde fin_. She did my blouses beautifully the last time I was there, and\r\nwas so delighted to see me again. I gave her all my old clothes, even\r\nmy old hats, though she always wears her Breton headdress. Her hair is\r\nstill like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby\xe2\x80\x99s, and she has\r\nthe same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back\r\nto her _bains de mer_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles and\r\nbroke into a low, happy laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cHow jolly it was being young, Hilda! Do\r\nyou remember that first walk we took together in Paris? We walked down\r\nto the Place Saint-Michel to buy some lilacs. Do you remember how sweet\r\nthey smelled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do. Come, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have our coffee in the other room, and you\r\ncan smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda rose quickly, as if she wished to change the drift of their talk,\r\nbut Bartley found it pleasant to continue it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a warm, soft spring evening that was,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, as they sat\r\ndown in the study with the coffee on a little table between them; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthe sky, over the bridges, was just the color of the lilacs. We walked\r\non down by the river, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda laughed and looked at him questioningly. He saw a gleam in her\r\neyes that he remembered even better than the episode he was recalling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we did,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered demurely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was on the Quai we met\r\nthat woman who was crying so bitterly. I gave her a spray of lilac, I\r\nremember, and you gave her a franc. I was frightened at your\r\nprodigality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect it was the last franc I had. What a strong brown face she\r\nhad, and very tragic. She looked at us with such despair and longing,\r\nout from under her black shawl. What she wanted from us was neither our\r\nflowers nor our francs, but just our youth. I remember it touched me\r\nso. I would have given her some of mine off my back, if I could. I had\r\nenough and to spare then,\xe2\x80\x9d Bartley mused, and looked thoughtfully at\r\nhis cigar.\r\n\r\nThey were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the\r\nmoney: \xe2\x80\x9cGod give you a happy love!\xe2\x80\x9d It was not in the ingratiating tone\r\nof the habitual beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, vibrating with pity for their youth and despair at\r\nthe terribleness of human life; it had the anguish of a voice of\r\nprophecy. Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized that he was in\r\nlove. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so\r\nsharply, had frightened them both. They went home sadly with the\r\nlilacs, back to the Rue Saint-Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm.\r\nWhen they reached the house where Hilda lodged, Bartley went across the\r\ncourt with her, and up the dark old stairs to the third landing; and\r\nthere he had kissed her for the first time. He had shut his eyes to\r\ngive him the courage, he remembered, and she had trembled so\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nBartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her. \xe2\x80\x9cDear me,\r\nwhy did you do that? I had quite forgotten\xe2\x80\x94I was back there. It was\r\nvery jolly,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nHilda laughed and went over to the piano. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we are neither of us\r\ntwenty now, you know. Have I told you about my new play? Mac is writing\r\none; really for me this time. You see, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen nothing else. What kind of a part is it? Shall you wear\r\nyellow gowns? I hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was looking at her round slender figure, as she stood by the piano,\r\nturning over a pile of music, and he felt the energy in every line of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a dress-up part. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to fancy me in fine\r\nfeathers. He says I ought to be minding the pigs at home, and I suppose\r\nI ought. But he\xe2\x80\x99s given me some good Irish songs. Listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down at the piano and sang. When she finished, Alexander shook\r\nhimself out of a reverie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSing \xe2\x80\x98The Harp That Once,\xe2\x80\x99 Hilda. You used to sing it so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. Of course I can\xe2\x80\x99t really sing, except the way my mother and\r\ngrandmother did before me. Most actresses nowadays learn to sing\r\nproperly, so I tried a master; but he confused me, just!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, sing it, Hilda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really too warm in this room to sing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander went over and opened the window for her. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid\r\nto let the wind low like that on your neck? Can\xe2\x80\x99t I get a scarf or\r\nsomething?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk a theatre lady if she\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of drafts!\xe2\x80\x9d Hilda laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nperhaps, as I\xe2\x80\x99m so warm\xe2\x80\x94give me your handkerchief. There, just in\r\nfront.\xe2\x80\x9d He slipped the corners carefully under her shoulder-straps.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, that will do. It looks like a bib.\xe2\x80\x9d She pushed his hand away\r\nquickly and stood looking out into the deserted square. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t London a\r\ntomb on Sunday night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander caught the agitation in her voice. He stood a little behind\r\nher, and tried to steady himself as he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s soft and misty. See\r\nhow white the stars are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke. They stood close\r\ntogether, looking out into the wan, watery sky, breathing always more\r\nquickly and lightly, and it seemed as if all the clocks in the world\r\nhad stopped. Suddenly he moved the clenched hand he held behind him and\r\ndropped it violently at his side. He felt a tremor run through the\r\nslender yellow figure in front of him.\r\n\r\nShe caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him\r\nwithout turning round. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, take it. You must go now, Bartley.\r\nGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered\r\nin her ear: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are giving me a chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Take it and go. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair, you know. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander unclenched the two hands at his sides. With one he threw down\r\nthe window and with the other\xe2\x80\x94still standing behind her\xe2\x80\x94he drew her\r\nback against him.\r\n\r\nShe uttered a little cry, threw her arms over her head, and drew his\r\nface down to hers. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to let me love you a little,\r\nBartley?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the afternoon of the day before Christmas. Mrs. Alexander had\r\nbeen driving about all the morning, leaving presents at the houses of\r\nher friends. She lunched alone, and as she rose from the table she\r\nspoke to the butler: \xe2\x80\x9cThomas, I am going down to the kitchen now to see\r\nNorah. In half an hour you are to bring the greens up from the cellar\r\nand put them in the library. Mr. Alexander will be home at three to\r\nhang them himself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the stepladder, and plenty of tacks and\r\nstring. You may bring the azaleas upstairs. Take the white one to Mr.\r\nAlexander\xe2\x80\x99s study. Put the two pink ones in this room, and the red one\r\nin the drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little before three o\xe2\x80\x99clock Mrs. Alexander went into the library to\r\nsee that everything was ready. She pulled the window shades high, for\r\nthe weather was dark and stormy, and there was little light, even in\r\nthe streets. A foot of snow had fallen during the morning, and the wide\r\nspace over the river was thick with flying flakes that fell and\r\nwreathed the masses of floating ice. Winifred was standing by the\r\nwindow when she heard the front door open. She hurried to the hall as\r\nAlexander came stamping in, covered with snow. He kissed her joyfully\r\nand brushed away the snow that fell on her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had asked you to meet me at the office and walk home with me,\r\nWinifred. The Common is beautiful. The boys have swept the snow off the\r\npond and are skating furiously. Did the cyclamens come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour ago. What splendid ones! But aren\xe2\x80\x99t you frightfully\r\nextravagant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for Christmas-time. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go upstairs and change my coat. I shall\r\nbe down in a moment. Tell Thomas to get everything ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander reappeared, he took his wife\xe2\x80\x99s arm and went with her\r\ninto the library. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did the azaleas get here? Thomas has got the\r\nwhite one in my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him to put it there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, I say, it\xe2\x80\x99s much the finest of the lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I had it put there. There is too much color in that room\r\nfor a red one, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley began to sort the greens. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks very splendid there, but I\r\nfeel piggish to have it. However, we really spend more time there than\r\nanywhere else in the house. Will you hand me the holly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe climbed up the stepladder, which creaked under his weight, and began\r\nto twist the tough stems of the holly into the frame-work of the\r\nchandelier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to tell you that I had a letter from Wilson, this morning,\r\nexplaining his telegram. He is coming on because an old uncle up in\r\nVermont has conveniently died and left Wilson a little money\xe2\x80\x94something\r\nlike ten thousand. He\xe2\x80\x99s coming on to settle up the estate. Won\xe2\x80\x99t it be\r\njolly to have him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how fine that he\xe2\x80\x99s come into a little money. I can see him posting\r\ndown State Street to the steamship offices. He will get a good many\r\ntrips out of that ten thousand. What can have detained him? I expected\r\nhim here for luncheon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose trains from Albany are always late. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be along sometime this\r\nafternoon. And now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to go upstairs and lie down for an\r\nhour? You\xe2\x80\x99ve had a busy morning and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be tired\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter his wife went upstairs Alexander worked energetically at the\r\ngreens for a few moments. Then, as he was cutting off a length of\r\nstring, he sighed suddenly and sat down, staring out of the window at\r\nthe snow. The animation died out of his face, but in his eyes there was\r\na restless light, a look of apprehension and suspense. He kept clasping\r\nand unclasping his big hands as if he were trying to realize something.\r\nThe clock ticked through the minutes of a half-hour and the afternoon\r\noutside began to thicken and darken turbidly. Alexander, since he first\r\nsat down, had not changed his position. He leaned forward, his hands\r\nbetween his knees, scarcely breathing, as if he were holding himself\r\naway from his surroundings, from the room, and from the very chair in\r\nwhich he sat, from everything except the wild eddies of snow above the\r\nriver on which his eyes were fixed with feverish intentness, as if he\r\nwere trying to project himself thither. When at last Lucius Wilson was\r\nannounced, Alexander sprang eagerly to his feet and hurried to meet his\r\nold instructor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Wilson. What luck! Come into the library. We are to have a lot\r\nof people to dinner to-night, and Winifred\xe2\x80\x99s lying down. You will\r\nexcuse her, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? And now what about yourself? Sit down and tell\r\nme everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99d rather move about, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting in\r\nthe train for a week, it seems to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson stood before the fire\r\nwith his hands behind him and looked about the room. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _have_ been\r\nbusy. Bartley, if I\xe2\x80\x99d had my choice of all possible places in which to\r\nspend Christmas, your house would certainly be the place I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nchosen. Happy people do a great deal for their friends. A house like\r\nthis throws its warmth out. I felt it distinctly as I was coming\r\nthrough the Berkshires. I could scarcely believe that I was to see Mrs.\r\nBartley again so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Wilson. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be as glad to see you. Shall we have tea\r\nnow? I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring for Thomas to clear away this litter. Winifred says I\r\nalways wreck the house when I try to do anything. Do you know, I am\r\nquite tired. Looks as if I were not used to work, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAlexander laughed and dropped into a chair. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sailing the\r\nday after New Year\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain? Why, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been over twice since I was here in the spring,\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I was in London about ten days in the summer. Went to escape the\r\nhot weather more than anything else. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be gone more than a month\r\nthis time. Winifred and I have been up in Canada for most of the\r\nautumn. That Moorlock Bridge is on my back all the time. I never had so\r\nmuch trouble with a job before.\xe2\x80\x9d Alexander moved about restlessly and\r\nfell to poking the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I seen in the papers that there is some trouble about a\r\ntidewater bridge of yours in New Jersey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t amount to anything. It\xe2\x80\x99s held up by a steel strike. A\r\nbother, of course, but the sort of thing one is always having to put up\r\nwith. But the Moorlock Bridge is a continual anxiety. You see, the\r\ntruth is, we are having to build pretty well to the strain limit up\r\nthere. They\xe2\x80\x99ve crowded me too much on the cost. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well if\r\neverything goes well, but these estimates have never been used for\r\nanything of such length before. However, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done.\r\nThey hold me to the scale I\xe2\x80\x99ve used in shorter bridges. The last thing\r\na bridge commission cares about is the kind of bridge you build.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Bartley had finished dressing for dinner he went into his study,\r\nwhere he found his wife arranging flowers on his writing-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese pink roses just came from Mrs. Hastings,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I am sure she meant them for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley looked about with an air of satisfaction at the greens and the\r\nwreaths in the windows. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you a moment, Winifred? I have just now\r\nbeen thinking that this is our twelfth Christmas. Can you realize it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe went up to the table and took her hands away from the flowers,\r\ndrying them with his pocket handkerchief. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been awfully happy\r\nones, all of them, haven\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d He took her in his arms and bent\r\nback, lifting her a little and giving her a long kiss. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are happy,\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t you Winifred? More than anything else in the world, I want you\r\nto be happy. Sometimes, of late, I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought you looked as if you were\r\ntroubled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it\xe2\x80\x99s only when you are troubled and harassed that I feel worried,\r\nBartley. I wish you always seemed as you do to-night. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nalways.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked earnestly and inquiringly into his eyes.\r\n\r\nAlexander took her two hands from his shoulders and swung them back and\r\nforth in his own, laughing his big blond laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m growing older, my dear; that\xe2\x80\x99s what you feel. Now, may I show you\r\nsomething? I meant to save them until to-morrow, but I want you to wear\r\nthem to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d He took a little leather box out of his pocket and\r\nopened it. On the white velvet lay two long pendants of curiously\r\nworked gold, set with pearls. Winifred looked from the box to Bartley\r\nand exclaimed:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you ever find such gold work, Bartley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s old Flemish. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it fine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are the most beautiful things, dear. But, you know, I never wear\r\nearrings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know. But I want you to wear them. I have always wanted\r\nyou to. So few women can. There must be a good ear, to begin with, and\r\na nose\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he waved his hand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cabove reproach. Most women look silly in\r\nthem. They go only with faces like yours\xe2\x80\x94very, very proud, and just a\r\nlittle hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinifred laughed as she went over to the mirror and fitted the delicate\r\nsprings to the lobes of her ears. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bartley, that old foolishness\r\nabout my being hard. It really hurts my feelings. But I must go down\r\nnow. People are beginning to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley drew her arm about his neck and went to the door with her. \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\nhard to me, Winifred,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cNever, never hard to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft alone, he paced up and down his study. He was at home again, among\r\nall the dear familiar things that spoke to him of so many happy years.\r\nHis house to-night would be full of charming people, who liked and\r\nadmired him. Yet all the time, underneath his pleasure and hopefulness\r\nand satisfaction, he was conscious of the vibration of an unnatural\r\nexcitement. Amid this light and warmth and friendliness, he sometimes\r\nstarted and shuddered, as if some one had stepped on his grave.\r\nSomething had broken loose in him of which he knew nothing except that\r\nit was sullen and powerful, and that it wrung and tortured him.\r\nSometimes it came upon him softly, in enervating reveries. Sometimes it\r\nbattered him like the cannon rolling in the hold of the vessel. Always,\r\nnow, it brought with it a sense of quickened life, of stimulating\r\ndanger. To-night it came upon him suddenly, as he was walking the\r\nfloor, after his wife left him. It seemed impossible; he could not\r\nbelieve it. He glanced entreatingly at the door, as if to call her\r\nback. He heard voices in the hall below, and knew that he must go down.\r\nGoing over to the window, he looked out at the lights across the river.\r\nHow could this happen here, in his own house, among the things he\r\nloved? What was it that reached in out of the darkness and thrilled\r\nhim? As he stood there he had a feeling that he would never escape. He\r\nshut his eyes and pressed his forehead against the cold window glass,\r\nbreathing in the chill that came through it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat this,\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat this should have happened to _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn New Year\xe2\x80\x99s day a thaw set in, and during the night torrents of rain\r\nfell. In the morning, the morning of Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s departure for England,\r\nthe river was streaked with fog and the rain drove hard against the\r\nwindows of the breakfast-room. Alexander had finished his coffee and\r\nwas pacing up and down. His wife sat at the table, watching him. She\r\nwas pale and unnaturally calm. When Thomas brought the letters, Bartley\r\nsank into his chair and ran them over rapidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a note from old Wilson. He\xe2\x80\x99s safe back at his grind, and says\r\nhe had a bully time. \xe2\x80\x98The memory of Mrs. Bartley will make my whole\r\nwinter fragrant.\xe2\x80\x99 Just like him. He will go on getting measureless\r\nsatisfaction out of you by his study fire. What a man he is for looking\r\non at life!\xe2\x80\x9d Bartley sighed, pushed the letters back impatiently, and\r\nwent over to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a nasty sort of day to sail. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nnotion to call it off. Next week would be time enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would only mean starting twice. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really help you out\r\nat all,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Alexander spoke soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99d come back late for\r\nall your engagements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley began jingling some loose coins in his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish things\r\nwould let me rest. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of work, tired of people, tired of\r\ntrailing about.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked out at the storm-beaten river.\r\n\r\nWinifred came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat you always say, poor Bartley! At bottom you really like all these\r\nthings. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you remember that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his arm about her. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, life runs smoothly enough with\r\nsome people, and with me it\xe2\x80\x99s always a messy sort of patchwork. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike the song; peace is where I am not. How can you face it all with so\r\nmuch fortitude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with that clear gaze which Wilson had so much\r\nadmired, which he had felt implied such high confidence and fearless\r\npride. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I faced that long ago, when you were on your first bridge,\r\nup at old Allway. I knew then that your paths were not to be paths of\r\npeace, but I decided that I wanted to follow them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley and his wife stood silent for a long time; the fire crackled in\r\nthe grate, the rain beat insistently upon the windows, and the sleepy\r\nAngora looked up at them curiously.\r\n\r\nPresently Thomas made a discreet sound at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cShall Edward bring\r\ndown your trunks, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; they are ready. Tell him not to forget the big portfolio on the\r\nstudy table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomas withdrew, closing the door softly. Bartley turned away from his\r\nwife, still holding her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt never gets any easier, Winifred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both started at the sound of the carriage on the pavement outside.\r\nAlexander sat down and leaned his head on his hand. His wife bent over\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cCourage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gayly. Bartley rose and rang the bell. Thomas\r\nbrought him his hat and stick and ulster. At the sight of these, the\r\nsupercilious Angora moved restlessly, quitted her red cushion by the\r\nfire, and came up, waving her tail in vexation at these ominous\r\nindications of change. Alexander stooped to stroke her, and then\r\nplunged into his coat and drew on his gloves. His wife held his stick,\r\nsmiling. Bartley smiled too, and his eyes cleared. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll work like the\r\ndevil, Winifred, and be home again before you realize I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nkissed her quickly several times, hurried out of the front door into\r\nthe rain, and waved to her from the carriage window as the driver was\r\nstarting his melancholy, dripping black horses. Alexander sat with his\r\nhands clenched on his knees. As the carriage turned up the hill, he\r\nlifted one hand and brought it down violently. \xe2\x80\x9cThis time\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he spoke\r\naloud and through his set teeth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis time I\xe2\x80\x99m going to end it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the third day out, Alexander was sitting well to\r\nthe stern, on the windward side where the chairs were few, his rugs\r\nover him and the collar of his fur-lined coat turned up about his ears.\r\nThe weather had so far been dark and raw. For two hours he had been\r\nwatching the low, dirty sky and the beating of the heavy rain upon the\r\niron-colored sea. There was a long, oily swell that made exercise\r\nlaborious. The decks smelled of damp woolens, and the air was so humid\r\nthat drops of moisture kept gathering upon his hair and mustache. He\r\nseldom moved except to brush them away. The great open spaces made him\r\npassive and the restlessness of the water quieted him. He intended\r\nduring the voyage to decide upon a course of action, but he held all\r\nthis away from him for the present and lay in a blessed gray oblivion.\r\nDeep down in him somewhere his resolution was weakening and\r\nstrengthening, ebbing and flowing. The thing that perturbed him went on\r\nas steadily as his pulse, but he was almost unconscious of it. He was\r\nsubmerged in the vast impersonal grayness about him, and at intervals\r\nthe sidelong roll of the boat measured off time like the ticking of a\r\nclock. He felt released from everything that troubled and perplexed\r\nhim. It was as if he had tricked and outwitted torturing memories, had\r\nactually managed to get on board without them. He thought of nothing at\r\nall. If his mind now and again picked a face out of the grayness, it\r\nwas Lucius Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s, or the face of an old schoolmate, forgotten for\r\nyears; or it was the slim outline of a favorite greyhound he used to\r\nhunt jack-rabbits with when he was a boy.\r\n\r\nToward six o\xe2\x80\x99clock the wind rose and tugged at the tarpaulin and\r\nbrought the swell higher. After dinner Alexander came back to the wet\r\ndeck, piled his damp rugs over him again, and sat smoking, losing\r\nhimself in the obliterating blackness and drowsing in the rush of the\r\ngale. Before he went below a few bright stars were pricked off between\r\nheavily moving masses of cloud.\r\n\r\nThe next morning was bright and mild, with a fresh breeze. Alexander\r\nfelt the need of exercise even before he came out of his cabin. When he\r\nwent on deck the sky was blue and blinding, with heavy whiffs of white\r\ncloud, smoke-colored at the edges, moving rapidly across it. The water\r\nwas roughish, a cold, clear indigo breaking into whitecaps. Bartley\r\nwalked for two hours, and then stretched himself in the sun until\r\nlunch-time.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon he wrote a long letter to Winifred. Later, as he\r\nwalked the deck through a splendid golden sunset, his spirits rose\r\ncontinually. It was agreeable to come to himself again after several\r\ndays of numbness and torpor. He stayed out until the last tinge of\r\nviolet had faded from the water. There was literally a taste of life on\r\nhis lips as he sat down to dinner and ordered a bottle of champagne. He\r\nwas late in finishing his dinner, and drank rather more wine than he\r\nhad meant to. When he went above, the wind had risen and the deck was\r\nalmost deserted. As he stepped out of the door a gale lifted his heavy\r\nfur coat about his shoulders. He fought his way up the deck with keen\r\nexhilaration. The moment he stepped, almost out of breath, behind the\r\nshelter of the stern, the wind was cut off, and he felt, like a rush of\r\nwarm air, a sense of close and intimate companionship. He started back\r\nand tore his coat open as if something warm were actually clinging to\r\nhim beneath it. He hurried up the deck and went into the saloon parlor,\r\nfull of women who had retreated thither from the sharp wind. He threw\r\nhimself upon them. He talked delightfully to the older ones and played\r\naccompaniments for the younger ones until the last sleepy girl had\r\nfollowed her mother below. Then he went into the smoking-room. He\r\nplayed bridge until two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and managed to lose a\r\nconsiderable sum of money without really noticing that he was doing so.\r\n\r\nAfter the break of one fine day the weather was pretty consistently\r\ndull. When the low sky thinned a trifle, the pale white spot of a sun\r\ndid no more than throw a bluish lustre on the water, giving it the dark\r\nbrightness of newly cut lead. Through one after another of those gray\r\ndays Alexander drowsed and mused, drinking in the grateful moisture.\r\nBut the complete peace of the first part of the voyage was over.\r\nSometimes he rose suddenly from his chair as if driven out, and paced\r\nthe deck for hours. People noticed his propensity for walking in rough\r\nweather, and watched him curiously as he did his rounds. From his\r\nabstraction and the determined set of his jaw, they fancied he must be\r\nthinking about his bridge. Every one had heard of the new cantilever\r\nbridge in Canada.\r\n\r\nBut Alexander was not thinking about his work. After the fourth night\r\nout, when his will suddenly softened under his hands, he had been\r\ncontinually hammering away at himself. More and more often, when he\r\nfirst wakened in the morning or when he stepped into a warm place after\r\nbeing chilled on the deck, he felt a sudden painful delight at being\r\nnearer another shore. Sometimes when he was most despondent, when he\r\nthought himself worn out with this struggle, in a flash he was free of\r\nit and leaped into an overwhelming consciousness of himself. On the\r\ninstant he felt that marvelous return of the impetuousness, the intense\r\nexcitement, the increasing expectancy of youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable. The\r\nstop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that\r\nhe noted dimly through his growing impatience. He had planned to stop\r\nin Liverpool; but, instead, he took the boat train for London.\r\n\r\nEmerging at Euston at half-past three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon,\r\nAlexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to\r\nBedford Square. When Marie met him at the door, even her strong sense\r\nof the proprieties could not restrain her surprise and delight. She\r\nblushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran\r\nupstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and\r\nunbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nliving-room. The room was empty when he entered. A coal fire was\r\ncrackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already\r\nbeginning to grow dark outside. Alexander did not sit down. He stood\r\nhis ground over by the windows until Hilda came in. She called his name\r\non the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a\r\nchange in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell\r\njust when she did it. She merely brushed his cheek with her lips and\r\nput a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a grand\r\nthing to happen on a raw day! I felt it in my bones when I woke this\r\nmorning that something splendid was going to turn up. I thought it\r\nmight be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along. I never\r\ndreamed it would be you, Bartley. But why do you let me chatter on like\r\nthis? Come over to the fire; you\xe2\x80\x99re chilled through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a\r\nstool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her\r\nchin, laughing like a happy little girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen? You haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken\r\na word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got in about ten minutes ago. I landed at Liverpool this morning and\r\ncame down on the boat train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze. Hilda\r\nwatched him with perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something troubling you, Bartley. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley bent lower over the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the whole thing that troubles\r\nme, Hilda. You and I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda took a quick, soft breath. She looked at his heavy shoulders and\r\nbig, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about us, Bartley?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a thin voice.\r\n\r\nHe locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers\r\nclose to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock\r\nticked and a street vendor began to call under the window. At last\r\nAlexander brought out one word:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright. She\r\nlooked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows,\r\nand back again to Bartley. She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with\r\nher hand, then sank back upon her stool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything you wish me to, Bartley,\xe2\x80\x9d she said tremulously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stand seeing you miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t live with myself any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered roughly.\r\n\r\nHe rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably\r\nabout the room, seeming to find it too small for him. He pulled up a\r\nwindow as if the air were heavy.\r\n\r\nHilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing,\r\ndark shadows growing about her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt . . . it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always made you miserable, has it?\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyelids\r\nfell and her lips quivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways. But it\xe2\x80\x99s worse now. It\xe2\x80\x99s unbearable. It tortures me every\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why _now?_\xe2\x80\x9d she asked piteously, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\nHe ignored her question. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a man who can live two lives,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on feverishly. \xe2\x80\x9cEach life spoils the other. I get nothing but\r\nmisery out of either. The world is all there, just as it used to be,\r\nbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t get at it any more. There is this deception between me and\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that word \xe2\x80\x9cdeception,\xe2\x80\x9d spoken with such self-contempt, the color\r\nflashed back into Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s face as suddenly as if she had been struck by\r\na whiplash. She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were\r\nclasped tightly in front of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you\xe2\x80\x94could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if\r\nI were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was myself I\r\nwas defying, Hilda. I have thought about it until I am worn out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her and his haggard face softened. He put out his hand\r\ntoward her as he looked away again into the fire.\r\n\r\nShe crept across to him, drawing her stool after her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you\r\nfirst begin to feel like this, Bartley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the very first. The first was\xe2\x80\x94sort of in play, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda\xe2\x80\x99s face quivered, but she whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think it must have\r\nbeen. But why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me when you were here in the summer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant to, but somehow I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. We had only a\r\nfew days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was happy, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d She pressed his hand gently in gratitude.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you happy then, at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the\r\nfragrance of those days. Something of their troubling sweetness came\r\nback to Alexander, too. He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was then. You know. But afterward. . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him.\r\nPresently it stole back to his coat sleeve. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease tell me one thing,\r\nBartley. At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hand shut down quickly over the questioning fingers on his sleeves.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Hilda; I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply.\r\n\r\nShe leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything. I wanted\r\nyou to eat all the cakes and have them, too. I somehow believed that I\r\ncould take all the bad consequences for you. I wanted you always to be\r\nhappy and handsome and successful\xe2\x80\x94to have all the things that a great\r\nman ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great\r\nmen are not permitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the\r\ndeepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much\r\nlonger struggle together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, Bartley. I was wrong. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. You\xe2\x80\x99ve only to\r\ntell me now. What must I do that I\xe2\x80\x99ve not done, or what must I not do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want me to say it?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to tell me\r\nthat you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the\r\nworld among people? I can do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said heavily.\r\n\r\nHilda shivered and sat still. Bartley leaned his head in his hands and\r\nspoke through his teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a clean break, Hilda. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee you at all, anywhere. What I mean is that I want you to promise\r\nnever to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I\r\nbeg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda sprang up like a flame. She stood over him with her hands\r\nclenched at her side, her body rigid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late to ask that. Do you hear me, Bartley?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late. I won\xe2\x80\x99t promise. It\xe2\x80\x99s abominable of you to ask me. Keep\r\naway if you wish; when have I ever followed you? But, if you come to\r\nme, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as I see fit. The shamefulness of your asking me to do\r\nthat! If you come to me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as I see fit. Do you understand?\r\nBartley, you\xe2\x80\x99re cowardly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander rose and shook himself angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know I\xe2\x80\x99m cowardly.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of myself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust myself any more. I carried it all\r\nlightly enough at first, but now I don\xe2\x80\x99t dare trifle with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting the better of me. It\xe2\x80\x99s different now. I\xe2\x80\x99m growing older, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got my young self here with you. It\xe2\x80\x99s through him that I\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nto wish for you all and all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d He took her roughly in his arms.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nBartley, what am I to do? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you let me be angry with you? You\r\nask me to stay away from you because you want me! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nobody\r\nbut you. I will do anything you say\xe2\x80\x94but that! I will ask the least\r\nimaginable, but I must have _something!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley turned away and sank down in his chair again. Hilda sat on the\r\narm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust something Bartley. I must have you to think of through the months\r\nand months of loneliness. I must see you. I must know about you. The\r\nsight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful\xe2\x80\x94can I\r\nnever make you understand what that means to me?\xe2\x80\x9d She pressed his\r\nshoulders gently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, loving some one as I love you makes the\r\nwhole world different. If I\xe2\x80\x99d met you later, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t loved you so\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s all over, long ago. Then came all those years without\r\nyou, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and\r\npoor Mac, and me never heeding\xe2\x80\x94hard as a steel spring. And then you\r\ncame back, not caring very much, but it made no difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up\r\nany longer. Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her\r\nmouth and her wet, tired eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve tortured each other enough\r\nfor tonight. Forget everything except that I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I have forgotten everything but that already,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, your dear arms!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the fortnight that Alexander was in London he drove himself\r\nhard. He got through a great deal of personal business and saw a great\r\nmany men who were doing interesting things in his own profession. He\r\ndisliked to think of his visits to London as holidays, and when he was\r\nthere he worked even harder than he did at home.\r\n\r\nThe day before his departure for Liverpool was a singularly fine one.\r\nThe thick air had cleared overnight in a strong wind which brought in a\r\ngolden dawn and then fell off to a fresh breeze. When Bartley looked\r\nout of his windows from the Savoy, the river was flashing silver and\r\nthe gray stone along the Embankment was bathed in bright, clear\r\nsunshine. London had wakened to life after three weeks of cold and\r\nsodden rain. Bartley breakfasted hurriedly and went over his mail while\r\nthe hotel valet packed his trunks. Then he paid his account and walked\r\nrapidly down the Strand past Charing Cross Station. His spirits rose\r\nwith every step, and when he reached Trafalgar Square, blazing in the\r\nsun, with its fountains playing and its column reaching up into the\r\nbright air, he signaled to a hansom, and, before he knew what he was\r\nabout, told the driver to go to Bedford Square by way of the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s apartment she met him, fresh as the morning\r\nitself. Her rooms were flooded with sunshine and full of the flowers he\r\nhad been sending her. She would never let him give her anything else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you busy this morning, Hilda?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked as he sat down, his hat\r\nand gloves in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up and about three hours, working at my part. We open\r\nin February, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then you\xe2\x80\x99ve worked enough. And so have I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all my men,\r\nmy packing is done, and I go up to Liverpool this evening. But this\r\nmorning we are going to have a holiday. What do you say to a drive out\r\nto Kew and Richmond? You may not get another day like this all winter.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a fine April day at home. May I use your telephone? I want to\r\norder the carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how jolly! There, sit down at the desk. And while you are\r\ntelephoning I\xe2\x80\x99ll change my dress. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be long. All the morning\r\npapers are on the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda was back in a few moments wearing a long gray squirrel coat and a\r\nbroad fur hat.\r\n\r\nBartley rose and inspected her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you wear some of those pink\r\nroses?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they came only this morning, and they have not even begun to open.\r\nI was saving them. I am so unconsciously thrifty!\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed as she\r\nlooked about the room. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been sending me far too many flowers,\r\nBartley. New ones every day. That\xe2\x80\x99s too often; though I do love to open\r\nthe boxes, and I take good care of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t you let me send you any of those jade or ivory things you\r\nare so fond of? Or pictures? I know a good deal about pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda shook her large hat as she drew the roses out of the tall glass.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there are some things you can\xe2\x80\x99t do. There\xe2\x80\x99s the carriage. Will you\r\nbutton my gloves for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartley took her wrist and began to button the long gray suede glove.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow gay your eyes are this morning, Hilda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying. It always stirs me up a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pushed the top of the glove up slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you learn to take\r\nhold of your parts like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had nothing else to think of. Come, the carriage is waiting.\r\nWhat a shocking while you take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in no hurry. We\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey found all London abroad. Piccadilly was a stream of rapidly moving\r\ncarriages, from which flashed furs and flowers and bright winter\r\ncostumes. The metal trappings of the harnesses shone dazzlingly, and\r\nthe wheels were revolving disks that threw off rays of light. The parks\r\nwere full of children and nursemaids and joyful dogs that leaped and\r\nyelped and scratched up the brown earth with their paws.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going until to-morrow, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Bartley announced suddenly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll cut off a day in Liverpool. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t felt so jolly this long\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda looked up with a smile which she tried not to make too glad. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink people were meant to be happy, a little,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThey had lunch at Richmond and then walked to Twickenham, where they\r\nhad sent the carriage. They drove back, with a glorious sunset behind\r\nthem, toward the distant gold-washed city. It was one of those rare\r\nafternoons when all the thickness and shadow of London are changed to a\r\nkind of shining, pulsing, special atmosphere; when the smoky vapors\r\nbecome fluttering golden clouds, nacreous veils of pink and amber; when\r\nall that bleakness of gray stone and dullness of dirty brick trembles\r\nin aureate light, and all the roofs and spires, and one great dome, are\r\nfloated in golden haze. On such rare afternoons the ugliest of cities\r\nbecomes the most poetic, and months of sodden days are offset by a\r\nmoment of miracle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like that with us Londoners, too,\xe2\x80\x9d Hilda was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\r\nis awfully grim and cheerless, our weather and our houses and our ways\r\nof amusing ourselves. But we can be happier than anybody. We can go mad\r\nwith joy, as the people do out in the fields on a fine Whitsunday. We\r\nmake the most of our moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thrust her little chin out defiantly over her gray fur collar, and\r\nBartley looked down at her and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a plucky one, you.\xe2\x80\x9d He patted her glove with his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nyou are a plucky one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. Not about some things, at any rate. It\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t take pluck to fight for one\xe2\x80\x99s moment, but it takes pluck to go\r\nwithout\xe2\x80\x94a lot. More than I have. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d she added fiercely.\r\n\r\nAfter miles of outlying streets and little gloomy houses, they reached\r\nLondon itself, red and roaring and murky, with a thick dampness coming\r\nup from the river, that betokened fog again to-morrow. The streets were\r\nfull of people who had worked indoors all through the priceless day and\r\nhad now come hungrily out to drink the muddy lees of it. They stood in\r\nlong black lines, waiting before the pit entrances of the\r\ntheatres\xe2\x80\x94short-coated boys, and girls in sailor hats, all shivering and\r\nchatting gayly. There was a blurred rhythm in all the dull city\r\nnoises\xe2\x80\x94in the clatter of the cab horses and the rumbling of the busses,\r\nin the street calls, and in the undulating tramp, tramp of the crowd.\r\nIt was like the deep vibration of some vast underground machinery, and\r\nlike the muffled pulsations of millions of human hearts.\r\n\r\n[See \xe2\x80\x9cThe Barrel Organ by Alfred Noyes. Ed.] [I have placed it at the\r\nend for your convenience]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeems good to get back, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Bartley whispered, as they drove\r\nfrom Bayswater Road into Oxford Street. \xe2\x80\x9cLondon always makes me want to\r\nlive more than any other city in the world. You remember our priestess\r\nmummy over in the mummy-room, and how we used to long to go and bring\r\nher out on nights like this? Three thousand years! Ugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, I believe she used to feel it when we stood there and\r\nwatched her and wished her well. I believe she used to remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Hilda\r\nsaid thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s go to some awfully jolly place for dinner before\r\nwe go home. I could eat all the dinners there are in London to-night.\r\nWhere shall I tell the driver? The Piccadilly Restaurant? The music\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are too many people there whom one knows. Why not that little\r\nFrench place in Soho, where we went so often when you were here in the\r\nsummer? I love it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been there with any one but you.\r\nSometimes I go by myself, when I am particularly lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, the sole\xe2\x80\x99s good there. How many street pianos there are\r\nabout to-night! The fine weather must have thawed them out. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nfive miles of \xe2\x80\x98Il Trovatore\xe2\x80\x99 now. They always make me feel jaunty. Are\r\nyou comfy, and not too tired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not tired at all. I was just wondering how people can ever die.\r\nWhy did you remind me of the mummy? Life seems the strongest and most\r\nindestructible thing in the world. Do you really believe that all those\r\npeople rushing about down there, going to good dinners and clubs and\r\ntheatres, will be dead some day, and not care about anything? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve it, and I know I shan\xe2\x80\x99t die, ever! You see, I feel too\xe2\x80\x94too\r\npowerful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped. Bartley sprang out and swung her quickly to the\r\npavement. As he lifted her in his two hands he whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare\xe2\x80\x94powerful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last rehearsal was over, a tedious dress rehearsal which had lasted\r\nall day and exhausted the patience of every one who had to do with it.\r\nWhen Hilda had dressed for the street and came out of her\r\ndressing-room, she found Hugh MacConnell waiting for her in the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fog\xe2\x80\x99s thicker than ever, Hilda. There have been a great many\r\naccidents to-day. It\xe2\x80\x99s positively unsafe for you to be out alone. Will\r\nyou let me take you home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow good of you, Mac. If you are going with me, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\nwalk. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no exercise to-day, and all this has made me nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said MacConnell dryly. Hilda pulled down her veil\r\nand they stepped out into the thick brown wash that submerged St.\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s Lane. MacConnell took her hand and tucked it snugly under his\r\narm. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I was such a savage. I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I made an\r\nass of myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder you were peppery. Those things are\r\nawfully trying. How do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagnificently. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I got so stirred up. We are going to hear\r\nfrom this, both of us. And that reminds me; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got news for you. They\r\nare going to begin repairs on the theatre about the middle of March,\r\nand we are to run over to New York for six weeks. Bennett told me\r\nyesterday that it was decided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda looked up delightedly at the tall gray figure beside her. He was\r\nthe only thing she could see, for they were moving through a dense\r\nopaqueness, as if they were walking at the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mac, how glad I am! And they love your things over there, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you be glad for\xe2\x80\x94any other reason, Hilda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMacConnell put his hand in front of her to ward off some dark object.\r\nIt proved to be only a lamp-post, and they beat in farther from the\r\nedge of the pavement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Mac?\xe2\x80\x9d Hilda asked nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just thinking there might be people over there you\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to\r\nsee,\xe2\x80\x9d he brought out awkwardly. Hilda said nothing, and as they walked\r\non MacConnell spoke again, apologetically: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my\r\nknowing about it, Hilda. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stiffen up like that. No one else knows,\r\nand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to find out anything. I felt it, even before I knew\r\nwho he was. I knew there was somebody, and that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey crossed Oxford Street in silence, feeling their way. The busses\r\nhad stopped running and the cab-drivers were leading their horses. When\r\nthey reached the other side, MacConnell said suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you are\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerribly, dangerously happy, Mac,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Hilda spoke quietly, pressing the\r\nrough sleeve of his greatcoat with her gloved hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought me too old for you, Hilda,\xe2\x80\x94oh, of course you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever said just that,\xe2\x80\x94and here this fellow is not more than eight years\r\nyounger than I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt that if I could get out of my old case\r\nI might win you yet. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fine, brave youth I carry inside me, only\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll never be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Mac. That has nothing to do with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s because you seem\r\ntoo close to me, too much my own kind. It would be like marrying Cousin\r\nMike, almost. I really tried to care as you wanted me to, away back in\r\nthe beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here we are, turning out of the Square. You are not angry with\r\nme, Hilda? Thank you for this walk, my dear. Go in and get dry things\r\non at once. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be having a great night to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mac, for everything. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMacConnell trudged off through the fog, and she went slowly upstairs.\r\nHer slippers and dressing gown were waiting for her before the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall certainly see him in New York. He will see by the papers that we\r\nare coming. Perhaps he knows it already,\xe2\x80\x9d Hilda kept thinking as she\r\nundressed. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he will be at the dock. No, scarcely that; but I\r\nmay meet him in the street even before he comes to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d Marie\r\nplaced the tea-table by the fire and brought Hilda her letters. She\r\nlooked them over, and started as she came to one in a handwriting that\r\nshe did not often see; Alexander had written to her only twice before,\r\nand he did not allow her to write to him at all. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Marie. You\r\nmay go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda sat down by the table with the letter in her hand, still\r\nunopened. She looked at it intently, turned it over, and felt its\r\nthickness with her fingers. She believed that she sometimes had a kind\r\nof second-sight about letters, and could tell before she read them\r\nwhether they brought good or evil tidings. She put this one down on the\r\ntable in front of her while she poured her tea. At last, with a little\r\nshiver of expectancy, she tore open the envelope and read:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nBOSTON, February \xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HILDA:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nIt is after twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Every one else is in bed and I am sitting\r\nalone in my study. I have been happier in this room than anywhere else\r\nin the world. Happiness like that makes one insolent. I used to think\r\nthese four walls could stand against anything. And now I scarcely know\r\nmyself here. Now I know that no one can build his security upon the\r\nnobleness of another person. Two people, when they love each other,\r\ngrow alike in their tastes and habits and pride, but their moral\r\nnatures (whatever we may mean by that canting expression) are never\r\nwelded. The base one goes on being base, and the noble one noble, to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nThe last week has been a bad one; I have been realizing how things used\r\nto be with me. Sometimes I get used to being dead inside, but lately it\r\nhas been as if a window beside me had suddenly opened, and as if all\r\nthe smells of spring blew in to me. There is a garden out there, with\r\nstars overhead, where I used to walk at night when I had a single\r\npurpose and a single heart. I can remember how I used to feel there,\r\nhow beautiful everything about me was, and what life and power and\r\nfreedom I felt in myself. When the window opens I know exactly how it\r\nwould feel to be out there. But that garden is closed to me. How is it,\r\nI ask myself, that everything can be so different with me when nothing\r\nhere has changed? I am in my own house, in my own study, in the midst\r\nof all these quiet streets where my friends live. They are all safe and\r\nat peace with themselves. But I am never at peace. I feel always on the\r\nedge of danger and change.\r\n\r\nI keep remembering locoed horses I used to see on the range when I was\r\na boy. They changed like that. We used to catch them and put them up in\r\nthe corral, and they developed great cunning. They would pretend to eat\r\ntheir oats like the other horses, but we knew they were always scheming\r\nto get back at the loco.\r\n\r\nIt seems that a man is meant to live only one life in this world. When\r\nhe tries to live a second, he develops another nature. I feel as if a\r\nsecond man had been grafted into me. At first he seemed only a\r\npleasure-loving simpleton, of whose company I was rather ashamed, and\r\nwhom I used to hide under my coat when I walked the Embankment, in\r\nLondon. But now he is strong and sullen, and he is fighting for his\r\nlife at the cost of mine. That is his one activity: to grow strong. No\r\ncreature ever wanted so much to live. Eventually, I suppose, he will\r\nabsorb me altogether. Believe me, you will hate me then.\r\n\r\nAnd what have you to do, Hilda, with this ugly story? Nothing at all.\r\nThe little boy drank of the prettiest brook in the forest and he became\r\na stag. I write all this because I can never tell it to you, and\r\nbecause it seems as if I could not keep silent any longer. And because\r\nI suffer, Hilda. If any one I loved suffered like this, I\xe2\x80\x99d want to\r\nknow it. Help me, Hilda!\r\n\r\nB.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last Saturday in April, the New York \xe2\x80\x9cTimes\xe2\x80\x9d published an\r\naccount of the strike complications which were delaying Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s New\r\nJersey bridge, and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at\r\nhis office on West Tenth Street.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the day after this notice appeared, Alexander worked all day\r\nat his Tenth Street rooms. His business often called him to New York,\r\nand he had kept an apartment there for years, subletting it when he\r\nwent abroad for any length of time. Besides his sleeping-room and bath,\r\nthere was a large room, formerly a painter\xe2\x80\x99s studio, which he used as a\r\nstudy and office. It was furnished with the cast-off possessions of his\r\nbachelor days and with odd things which he sheltered for friends of his\r\nwho followed itinerant and more or less artistic callings. Over the\r\nfireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s big\r\nwork-table stood in front of one of the three windows, and above the\r\ncouch hung the one picture in the room, a big canvas of charming color\r\nand spirit, a study of the Luxembourg Gardens in early spring, painted\r\nin his youth by a man who had since become a portrait-painter of\r\ninternational renown. He had done it for Alexander when they were\r\nstudents together in Paris.\r\n\r\nSunday was a cold, raw day and a fine rain fell continuously. When\r\nAlexander came back from dinner he put more wood on his fire, made\r\nhimself comfortable, and settled down at his desk, where he began\r\nchecking over estimate sheets. It was after nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock and he was\r\nlighting a second pipe, when he thought he heard a sound at his door.\r\nHe started and listened, holding the burning match in his hand; again\r\nhe heard the same sound, like a firm, light tap. He rose and crossed\r\nthe room quickly. When he threw open the door he recognized the figure\r\nthat shrank back into the bare, dimly lit hallway. He stood for a\r\nmoment in awkward constraint, his pipe in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her. He\r\npointed to a chair by the fire and went back to his worktable. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was standing behind the table, turning over a pile of blueprints\r\nnervously. The yellow light from the student\xe2\x80\x99s lamp fell on his hands\r\nand the purple sleeves of his velvet smoking-jacket, but his flushed\r\nface and big, hard head were in the shadow. There was something about\r\nhim that made Hilda wish herself at her hotel again, in the street\r\nbelow, anywhere but where she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I know, Bartley,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthat after this you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t owe me the least consideration. But we sail on Tuesday. I saw\r\nthat interview in the paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I\r\nthought I had to see you. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. Good-night; I\xe2\x80\x99m going now.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nturned and her hand closed on the door-knob.\r\n\r\nAlexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\r\nHilda; you\xe2\x80\x99re wet through. Let me take off your coat\xe2\x80\x94and your boots;\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re oozing water.\xe2\x80\x9d He knelt down and began to unlace her shoes,\r\nwhile Hilda shrank into the chair. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, put your feet on this stool.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you walked down\xe2\x80\x94and without overshoes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda hid her face in her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid to take a cab. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee, Bartley, that I\xe2\x80\x99m terribly frightened? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this a\r\nhundred times to-day. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be any more angry than you can help. I was\r\nall right until I knew you were in town. If you\xe2\x80\x99d sent me a note, or\r\ntelephoned me, or anything! But you won\xe2\x80\x99t let me write to you, and I\r\nhad to see you after that letter, that terrible letter you wrote me\r\nwhen you got home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander faced her, resting his arm on the mantel behind him, and\r\nbegan to brush the sleeve of his jacket. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the way you mean to\r\nanswer it, Hilda?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked unsteadily.\r\n\r\nShe was afraid to look up at him. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t you mean even to say\r\ngoodby to me, Bartley? Did you mean just to\xe2\x80\x94quit me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncame to tell you that I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to do as you asked me. But it\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nuse talking about that now. Give me my things, please.\xe2\x80\x9d She put her\r\nhand out toward the fender.\r\n\r\nAlexander sat down on the arm of her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you think I had\r\nforgotten you were in town, Hilda? Do you think I kept away by\r\naccident? Did you suppose I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were sailing on Tuesday?\r\nThere is a letter for you there, in my desk drawer. It was to have\r\nreached you on the steamer. I was all the morning writing it. I told\r\nmyself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of myself, a\r\nletter would be better than nothing. Marks on paper mean something to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cThey never did to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nBartley! Did you write to me? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you telephone me to let me\r\nknow that you had? Then I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander slipped his arm about her. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it before, Hilda,\r\non my honor I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, but I believe it was because, deep down in me\r\nsomewhere, I was hoping I might drive you to do just this. I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched\r\nthat door all day. I\xe2\x80\x99ve jumped up if the fire crackled. I think I have\r\nfelt that you were coming.\xe2\x80\x9d He bent his face over her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI felt that you were feeling that. But when I\r\ncame, I thought I had been mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander started up and began to walk up and down the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t mistaken. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up in Canada with my bridge, and I\r\narranged not to come to New York until after you had gone. Then, when\r\nyour manager added two more weeks, I was already committed.\xe2\x80\x9d He dropped\r\nupon the stool in front of her and sat with his hands hanging between\r\nhis knees. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do, Hilda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I wanted to see you about, Bartley. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do what\r\nyou asked me to do when you were in London. Only I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it more\r\ncompletely. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter much! One of them. Only not Mac. I\xe2\x80\x99m too fond of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander moved restlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you joking, Hilda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know very well. I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought about it a great deal, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nquite decided. I never used to understand how women did things like\r\nthat, but I know now. It\xe2\x80\x99s because they can\xe2\x80\x99t be at the mercy of the\r\nman they love any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander flushed angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s better to be at the mercy of a man\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder such circumstances, infinitely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a flash in her eyes that made Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s fall. He got up and\r\nwent over to the window, threw it open, and leaned out. He heard Hilda\r\nmoving about behind him. When he looked over his shoulder she was\r\nlacing her boots. He went back and stood over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHilda you\xe2\x80\x99d better think a while longer before you do that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what I ought to say, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99d be happy; truly I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you trying to frighten me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot-heel down firmly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you what I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind to do. I suppose I would\r\nbetter do it without telling you. But afterward I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have an\r\nopportunity to explain, for I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander started to speak, but caught himself. When Hilda rose he sat\r\ndown on the arm of her chair and drew her back into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so much alarmed if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how utterly reckless\r\nyou _can_ be. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything like that rashly.\xe2\x80\x9d His face grew\r\ntroubled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happy. You are not that kind of woman. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever have another hour\xe2\x80\x99s peace if I helped to make you do a thing like\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d He took her face between his hands and looked down into it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee, you are different, Hilda. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know you are?\xe2\x80\x9d His voice grew\r\nsofter, his touch more and more tender. \xe2\x80\x9cSome women can do that sort of\r\nthing, but you\xe2\x80\x94you can love as queens did, in the old time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda had heard that soft, deep tone in his voice only once before. She\r\nclosed her eyes; her lips and eyelids trembled. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly one, Bartley.\r\nOnly one. And he threw it back at me a second time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt the strength leap in the arms that held her so lightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry him again, Hilda. Try him once again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up into his eyes, and hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday afternoon a Boston lawyer, who had been trying a case in\r\nVermont, was standing on the siding at White River Junction when the\r\nCanadian Express pulled by on its northward journey. As the day-coaches\r\nat the rear end of the long train swept by him, the lawyer noticed at\r\none of the windows a man\xe2\x80\x99s head, with thick rumpled hair. \xe2\x80\x9cCurious,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought; \xe2\x80\x9cthat looked like Alexander, but what would he be doing back\r\nthere in the daycoaches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, Alexander.\r\n\r\nThat morning a telegram from Moorlock had reached him, telling him that\r\nthere was serious trouble with the bridge and that he was needed there\r\nat once, so he had caught the first train out of New York. He had taken\r\na seat in a day-coach to avoid the risk of meeting any one he knew, and\r\nbecause he did not wish to be comfortable. When the telegram arrived,\r\nAlexander was at his rooms on Tenth Street, packing his bag to go to\r\nBoston. On Monday night he had written a long letter to his wife, but\r\nwhen morning came he was afraid to send it, and the letter was still in\r\nhis pocket. Winifred was not a woman who could bear disappointment. She\r\ndemanded a great deal of herself and of the people she loved; and she\r\nnever failed herself. If he told her now, he knew, it would be\r\nirretrievable. There would be no going back. He would lose the thing he\r\nvalued most in the world; he would be destroying himself and his own\r\nhappiness. There would be nothing for him afterward. He seemed to see\r\nhimself dragging out a restless existence on the Continent\xe2\x80\x94Cannes,\r\nHy\xc3\xa8res, Algiers, Cairo\xe2\x80\x94among smartly dressed, disabled men of every\r\nnationality; forever going on journeys that led nowhere; hurrying to\r\ncatch trains that he might just as well miss; getting up in the morning\r\nwith a great bustle and splashing of water, to begin a day that had no\r\npurpose and no meaning; dining late to shorten the night, sleeping late\r\nto shorten the day.\r\n\r\nAnd for what? For a mere folly, a masquerade, a little thing that he\r\ncould not let go. _And he could even let it go_, he told himself. But\r\nhe had promised to be in London at mid-summer, and he knew that he\r\nwould go. . . . It was impossible to live like this any longer.\r\n\r\nAnd this, then, was to be the disaster that his old professor had\r\nforeseen for him: the crack in the wall, the crash, the cloud of dust.\r\nAnd he could not understand how it had come about. He felt that he\r\nhimself was unchanged, that he was still there, the same man he had\r\nbeen five years ago, and that he was sitting stupidly by and letting\r\nsome resolute offshoot of himself spoil his life for him. This new\r\nforce was not he, it was but a part of him. He would not even admit\r\nthat it was stronger than he; but it was more active. It was by its\r\nenergy that this new feeling got the better of him. His wife was the\r\nwoman who had made his life, gratified his pride, given direction to\r\nhis tastes and habits. The life they led together seemed to him\r\nbeautiful. Winifred still was, as she had always been, Romance for him,\r\nand whenever he was deeply stirred he turned to her. When the grandeur\r\nand beauty of the world challenged him\xe2\x80\x94as it challenges even the most\r\nself-absorbed people\xe2\x80\x94he always answered with her name. That was his\r\nreply to the question put by the mountains and the stars; to all the\r\nspiritual aspects of life. In his feeling for his wife there was all\r\nthe tenderness, all the pride, all the devotion of which he was\r\ncapable. There was everything but energy; the energy of youth which\r\nmust register itself and cut its name before it passes. This new\r\nfeeling was so fresh, so unsatisfied and light of foot. It ran and was\r\nnot wearied, anticipated him everywhere. It put a girdle round the\r\nearth while he was going from New York to Moorlock. At this moment, it\r\nwas tingling through him, exultant, and live as quicksilver,\r\nwhispering, \xe2\x80\x9cIn July you will be in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlready he dreaded the long, empty days at sea, the monotonous Irish\r\ncoast, the sluggish passage up the Mersey, the flash of the boat train\r\nthrough the summer country. He closed his eyes and gave himself up to\r\nthe feeling of rapid motion and to swift, terrifying thoughts. He was\r\nsitting so, his face shaded by his hand, when the Boston lawyer saw him\r\nfrom the siding at White River Junction.\r\n\r\nWhen at last Alexander roused himself, the afternoon had waned to\r\nsunset. The train was passing through a gray country and the sky\r\noverhead was flushed with a wide flood of clear color. There was a\r\nrose-colored light over the gray rocks and hills and meadows. Off to\r\nthe left, under the approach of a weather-stained wooden bridge, a\r\ngroup of boys were sitting around a little fire. The smell of the wood\r\nsmoke blew in at the window. Except for an old farmer, jogging along\r\nthe highroad in his box-wagon, there was not another living creature to\r\nbe seen. Alexander looked back wistfully at the boys, camped on the\r\nedge of a little marsh, crouching under their shelter and looking\r\ngravely at their fire. They took his mind back a long way, to a\r\ncampfire on a sandbar in a Western river, and he wished he could go\r\nback and sit down with them. He could remember exactly how the world\r\nhad looked then.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark and Alexander was still thinking of the boys, when it\r\noccurred to him that the train must be nearing Allway. In going to his\r\nnew bridge at Moorlock he had always to pass through Allway. The train\r\nstopped at Allway Mills, then wound two miles up the river, and then\r\nthe hollow sound under his feet told Bartley that he was on his first\r\nbridge again. The bridge seemed longer than it had ever seemed before,\r\nand he was glad when he felt the beat of the wheels on the solid\r\nroadbed again. He did not like coming and going across that bridge, or\r\nremembering the man who built it. And was he, indeed, the same man who\r\nused to walk that bridge at night, promising such things to himself and\r\nto the stars? And yet, he could remember it all so well: the quiet\r\nhills sleeping in the moonlight, the slender skeleton of the bridge\r\nreaching out into the river, and up yonder, alone on the hill, the big\r\nwhite house; upstairs, in Winifred\xe2\x80\x99s window, the light that told him\r\nshe was still awake and still thinking of him. And after the light went\r\nout he walked alone, taking the heavens into his confidence, unable to\r\ntear himself away from the white magic of the night, unwilling to sleep\r\nbecause longing was so sweet to him, and because, for the first time\r\nsince first the hills were hung with moonlight, there was a lover in\r\nthe world. And always there was the sound of the rushing water\r\nunderneath, the sound which, more than anything else, meant death; the\r\nwearing away of things under the impact of physical forces which men\r\ncould direct but never circumvent or diminish. Then, in the exaltation\r\nof love, more than ever it seemed to him to mean death, the only other\r\nthing as strong as love. Under the moon, under the cold, splendid\r\nstars, there were only those two things awake and sleepless; death and\r\nlove, the rushing river and his burning heart.\r\n\r\nAlexander sat up and looked about him. The train was tearing on through\r\nthe darkness. All his companions in the day-coach were either dozing or\r\nsleeping heavily, and the murky lamps were turned low. How came he here\r\namong all these dirty people? Why was he going to London? What did it\r\nmean\xe2\x80\x94what was the answer? How could this happen to a man who had lived\r\nthrough that magical spring and summer, and who had felt that the stars\r\nthemselves were but flaming particles in the far-away infinitudes of\r\nhis love?\r\n\r\nWhat had he done to lose it? How could he endure the baseness of life\r\nwithout it? And with every revolution of the wheels beneath him, the\r\nunquiet quicksilver in his breast told him that at midsummer he would\r\nbe in London. He remembered his last night there: the red foggy\r\ndarkness, the hungry crowds before the theatres, the hand-organs, the\r\nfeverish rhythm of the blurred, crowded streets, and the feeling of\r\nletting himself go with the crowd. He shuddered and looked about him at\r\nthe poor unconscious companions of his journey, unkempt and\r\ntravel-stained, now doubled in unlovely attitudes, who had come to\r\nstand to him for the ugliness he had brought into the world.\r\n\r\nAnd those boys back there, beginning it all just as he had begun it; he\r\nwished he could promise them better luck. Ah, if one could promise any\r\none better luck, if one could assure a single human being of happiness!\r\nHe had thought he could do so, once; and it was thinking of that that\r\nhe at last fell asleep. In his sleep, as if it had nothing fresher to\r\nwork upon, his mind went back and tortured itself with something years\r\nand years away, an old, long-forgotten sorrow of his childhood.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander awoke in the morning, the sun was just rising through\r\npale golden ripples of cloud, and the fresh yellow light was vibrating\r\nthrough the pine woods. The white birches, with their little unfolding\r\nleaves, gleamed in the lowlands, and the marsh meadows were already\r\ncoming to life with their first green, a thin, bright color which had\r\nrun over them like fire. As the train rushed along the trestles,\r\nthousands of wild birds rose screaming into the light. The sky was\r\nalready a pale blue and of the clearness of crystal. Bartley caught up\r\nhis bag and hurried through the Pullman coaches until he found the\r\nconductor. There was a stateroom unoccupied, and he took it and set\r\nabout changing his clothes. Last night he would not have believed that\r\nanything could be so pleasant as the cold water he dashed over his head\r\nand shoulders and the freshness of clean linen on his body.\r\n\r\nAfter he had dressed, Alexander sat down at the window and drew into\r\nhis lungs deep breaths of the pine-scented air. He had awakened with\r\nall his old sense of power. He could not believe that things were as\r\nbad with him as they had seemed last night, that there was no way to\r\nset them entirely right. Even if he went to London at midsummer, what\r\nwould that mean except that he was a fool? And he had been a fool\r\nbefore. That was not the reality of his life. Yet he knew that he would\r\ngo to London.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the train stopped at Moorlock. Alexander sprang to\r\nthe platform and hurried up the siding, waving to Philip Horton, one of\r\nhis assistants, who was anxiously looking up at the windows of the\r\ncoaches. Bartley took his arm and they went together into the station\r\nbuffet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have my coffee first, Philip. Have you had yours? And now, what\r\nseems to be the matter up here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man, in a hurried, nervous way, began his explanation.\r\n\r\nBut Alexander cut him short. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you stop work?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\nThe young engineer looked confused. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t stopped work yet, Mr.\r\nAlexander. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that I could go so far without definite\r\nauthorization from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say in your telegram exactly what you thought, and\r\nask for your authorization? You\xe2\x80\x99d have got it quick enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really, Mr. Alexander, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be absolutely sure, you know,\r\nand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to take the responsibility of making it public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander pushed back his chair and rose. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything I do can be made\r\npublic, Phil. You say that you believe the lower chords are showing\r\nstrain, and that even the workmen have been talking about it, and yet\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on adding weight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Mr. Alexander, but I had counted on your getting here\r\nyesterday. My first telegram missed you somehow. I sent one Sunday\r\nevening, to the same address, but it was returned to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you a carriage out there? I must stop to send a wire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander went up to the telegraph-desk and penciled the following\r\nmessage to his wife:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI may have to be here for some time. Can you come up at once? Urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARTLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moorlock Bridge lay three miles above the town. When they were\r\nseated in the carriage, Alexander began to question his assistant\r\nfurther. If it were true that the compression members showed strain,\r\nwith the bridge only two thirds done, then there was nothing to do but\r\npull the whole structure down and begin over again. Horton kept\r\nrepeating that he was sure there could be nothing wrong with the\r\nestimates.\r\n\r\nAlexander grew impatient. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all true, Phil, but we never were\r\njustified in assuming that a scale that was perfectly safe for an\r\nordinary bridge would work with anything of such length. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very\r\nwell on paper, but it remains to be seen whether it can be done in\r\npractice. I should have thrown up the job when they crowded me. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall nonsense to try to do what other engineers are doing when you know\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re not sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut just now, when there is such competition,\xe2\x80\x9d the younger man\r\ndemurred. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd certainly that\xe2\x80\x99s the new line of development.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander shrugged his shoulders and made no reply.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the bridge works, Alexander began his examination\r\nimmediately. An hour later he sent for the superintendent. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\r\nhad better stop work out there at once, Dan. I should say that the\r\nlower chord here might buckle at any moment. I told the Commission that\r\nwe were using higher unit stresses than any practice has established,\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ve put the dead load at a low estimate. Theoretically it worked\r\nout well enough, but it had never actually been tried.\xe2\x80\x9d Alexander put\r\non his overcoat and took the superintendent by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look so\r\nchopfallen, Dan. It\xe2\x80\x99s a jolt, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to face it. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nend of the world, you know. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll go out and call the men off\r\nquietly. They\xe2\x80\x99re already nervous, Horton tells me, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no use\r\nalarming them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll send the end riveters in\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexander and the superintendent picked their way out slowly over the\r\nlong span. They went deliberately, stopping to see what each gang was\r\ndoing, as if they were on an ordinary round of inspection. When they\r\nreached the end of the river span, Alexander nodded to the\r\nsuperintendent, who quietly gave an order to the foreman. The men in\r\nthe end gang picked up their tools and, glancing curiously at each\r\nother, started back across the bridge toward the river-bank. Alexander\r\nhimself remained standing where they had been working, looking about\r\nhim. It was hard to believe, as he looked back over it, that the whole\r\ngreat span was incurably disabled, was already as good as condemned,\r\nbecause something was out of line in the lower chord of the cantilever\r\narm.\r\n\r\nThe end riveters had reached the bank and were dispersing among the\r\ntool-houses, and the second gang had picked up their tools and were\r\nstarting toward the shore. Alexander, still standing at the end of the\r\nriver span, saw the lower chord of the cantilever arm give a little,\r\nlike an elbow bending. He shouted and ran after the second gang, but by\r\nthis time every one knew that the big river span was slowly settling.\r\nThere was a burst of shouting that was immediately drowned by the\r\nscream and cracking of tearing iron, as all the tension work began to\r\npull asunder. Once the chords began to buckle, there were thousands of\r\ntons of ironwork, all riveted together and lying in midair without\r\nsupport. It tore itself to pieces with roaring and grinding and noises\r\nthat were like the shrieks of a steam whistle. There was no shock of\r\nany kind; the bridge had no impetus except from its own weight. It\r\nlurched neither to right nor left, but sank almost in a vertical line,\r\nsnapping and breaking and tearing as it went, because no integral part\r\ncould bear for an instant the enormous strain loosed upon it. Some of\r\nthe men jumped and some ran, trying to make the shore.\r\n\r\nAt the first shriek of the tearing iron, Alexander jumped from the\r\ndownstream side of the bridge. He struck the water without injury and\r\ndisappeared. He was under the river a long time and had great\r\ndifficulty in holding his breath. When it seemed impossible, and his\r\nchest was about to heave, he thought he heard his wife telling him that\r\nhe could hold out a little longer. An instant later his face cleared\r\nthe water. For a moment, in the depths of the river, he had realized\r\nwhat it would mean to die a hypocrite, and to lie dead under the last\r\nabandonment of her tenderness. But once in the light and air, he knew\r\nhe should live to tell her and to recover all he had lost. Now, at\r\nlast, he felt sure of himself. He was not startled. It seemed to him\r\nthat he had been through something of this sort before. There was\r\nnothing horrible about it. This, too, was life, and life was activity,\r\njust as it was in Boston or in London. He was himself, and there was\r\nsomething to be done; everything seemed perfectly natural. Alexander\r\nwas a strong swimmer, but he had gone scarcely a dozen strokes when the\r\nbridge itself, which had been settling faster and faster, crashed into\r\nthe water behind him. Immediately the river was full of drowning men. A\r\ngang of French Canadians fell almost on top of him. He thought he had\r\ncleared them, when they began coming up all around him, clutching at\r\nhim and at each other. Some of them could swim, but they were either\r\nhurt or crazed with fright. Alexander tried to beat them off, but there\r\nwere too many of them. One caught him about the neck, another gripped\r\nhim about the middle, and they went down together. When he sank, his\r\nwife seemed to be there in the water beside him, telling him to keep\r\nhis head, that if he could hold out the men would drown and release\r\nhim. There was something he wanted to tell his wife, but he could not\r\nthink clearly for the roaring in his ears. Suddenly he remembered what\r\nit was. He caught his breath, and then she let him go.\r\n\r\nThe work of recovering the dead went on all day and all the following\r\nnight. By the next morning forty-eight bodies had been taken out of the\r\nriver, but there were still twenty missing. Many of the men had fallen\r\nwith the bridge and were held down under the debris. Early on the\r\nmorning of the second day a closed carriage was driven slowly along the\r\nriver-bank and stopped a little below the works, where the river boiled\r\nand churned about the great iron carcass which lay in a straight line\r\ntwo thirds across it. The carriage stood there hour after hour, and\r\nword soon spread among the crowds on the shore that its occupant was\r\nthe wife of the Chief Engineer; his body had not yet been found. The\r\nwidows of the lost workmen, moving up and down the bank with shawls\r\nover their heads, some of them carrying babies, looked at the rusty\r\nhired hack many times that morning. They drew near it and walked about\r\nit, but none of them ventured to peer within. Even half-indifferent\r\nsightseers dropped their voices as they told a newcomer: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see that\r\ncarriage over there? That\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Alexander. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t found him yet.\r\nShe got off the train this morning. Horton met her. She heard it in\r\nBoston yesterday\xe2\x80\x94heard the newsboys crying it in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt noon Philip Horton made his way through the crowd with a tray and a\r\ntin coffee-pot from the camp kitchen. When he reached the carriage he\r\nfound Mrs. Alexander just as he had left her in the early morning,\r\nleaning forward a little, with her hand on the lowered window, looking\r\nat the river. Hour after hour she had been watching the water, the\r\nlonely, useless stone towers, and the convulsed mass of iron wreckage\r\nover which the angry river continually spat up its yellow foam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose poor women out there, do they blame him very much?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\nas she handed the coffee-cup back to Horton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody blames him, Mrs. Alexander. If any one is to blame, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s I. I should have stopped work before he came. He said so as soon\r\nas I met him. I tried to get him here a day earlier, but my telegram\r\nmissed him, somehow. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time really to explain to me. If\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d got here Monday, he\xe2\x80\x99d have had all the men off at once. But, you\r\nsee, Mrs. Alexander, such a thing never happened before. According to\r\nall human calculations, it simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorton leaned wearily against the front wheel of the cab. He had not\r\nhad his clothes off for thirty hours, and the stimulus of violent\r\nexcitement was beginning to wear off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to tell me the worst, Mr. Horton. Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me to\r\nthe dread of finding out things that people may be saying. If he is\r\nblamed, if he needs any one to speak for him,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for the first time her\r\nvoice broke and a flush of life, tearful, painful, and confused, swept\r\nover her rigid pallor,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif he needs any one, tell me, show me what to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d She began to sob, and Horton hurried away.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon he was carrying his\r\nhat in his hand, and Winifred knew as soon as she saw him that they had\r\nfound Bartley. She opened the carriage door before he reached her and\r\nstepped to the ground.\r\n\r\nHorton put out his hand as if to hold her back and spoke pleadingly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you drive up to my house, Mrs. Alexander? They will take him up\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me to him now, please. I shall not make any trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe group of men down under the riverbank fell back when they saw a\r\nwoman coming, and one of them threw a tarpaulin over the stretcher.\r\nThey took off their hats and caps as Winifred approached, and although\r\nshe had pulled her veil down over her face they did not look up at her.\r\nShe was taller than Horton, and some of the men thought she was the\r\ntallest woman they had ever seen. \xe2\x80\x9cAs tall as himself,\xe2\x80\x9d some one\r\nwhispered. Horton motioned to the men, and six of them lifted the\r\nstretcher and began to carry it up the embankment. Winifred followed\r\nthem the half-mile to Horton\xe2\x80\x99s house. She walked quietly, without once\r\nbreaking or stumbling. When the bearers put the stretcher down in\r\nHorton\xe2\x80\x99s spare bedroom, she thanked them and gave her hand to each in\r\nturn. The men went out of the house and through the yard with their\r\ncaps in their hands. They were too much confused to say anything as\r\nthey went down the hill.\r\n\r\nHorton himself was almost as deeply perplexed. \xe2\x80\x9cMamie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his\r\nwife, when he came out of the spare room half an hour later, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you\r\ntake Mrs. Alexander the things she needs? She is going to do everything\r\nherself. Just stay about where you can hear her and go in if she wants\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything happened as Alexander had foreseen in that moment of\r\nprescience under the river. With her own hands she washed him clean of\r\nevery mark of disaster. All night he was alone with her in the still\r\nhouse, his great head lying deep in the pillow. In the pocket of his\r\ncoat Winifred found the letter that he had written her the night before\r\nhe left New York, water-soaked and illegible, but because of its\r\nlength, she knew it had been meant for her.\r\n\r\nFor Alexander death was an easy creditor. Fortune, which had smiled\r\nupon him consistently all his life, did not desert him in the end. His\r\nharshest critics did not doubt that, had he lived, he would have\r\nretrieved himself. Even Lucius Wilson did not see in this accident the\r\ndisaster he had once foretold.\r\n\r\nWhen a great man dies in his prime there is no surgeon who can say\r\nwhether he did well; whether or not the future was his, as it seemed to\r\nbe. The mind that society had come to regard as a powerful and reliable\r\nmachine, dedicated to its service, may for a long time have been sick\r\nwithin itself and bent upon its own destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Wilson had been living in London for six years and he was\r\njust back from a visit to America. One afternoon, soon after his\r\nreturn, he put on his frock-coat and drove in a hansom to pay a call\r\nupon Hilda Burgoyne, who still lived at her old number, off Bedford\r\nSquare. He and Miss Burgoyne had been fast friends for a long time. He\r\nhad first noticed her about the corridors of the British Museum, where\r\nhe read constantly. Her being there so often had made him feel that he\r\nwould like to know her, and as she was not an inaccessible person, an\r\nintroduction was not difficult. The preliminaries once over, they came\r\nto depend a great deal upon each other, and Wilson, after his day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreading, often went round to Bedford Square for his tea. They had much\r\nmore in common than their memories of a common friend. Indeed, they\r\nseldom spoke of him. They saved that for the deep moments which do not\r\ncome often, and then their talk of him was mostly silence. Wilson knew\r\nthat Hilda had loved him; more than this he had not tried to know.\r\n\r\nIt was late when Wilson reached Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s apartment on this particular\r\nDecember afternoon, and he found her alone. She sent for fresh tea and\r\nmade him comfortable, as she had such a knack of making people\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow good you were to come back before Christmas! I quite dreaded the\r\nHolidays without you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve helped me over a good many Christmases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe smiled at him gayly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if you needed me for that! But, at any rate, I needed _you_. How\r\nwell you are looking, my dear, and how rested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe peered up at her from his low chair, balancing the tips of his long\r\nfingers together in a judicial manner which had grown on him with\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHilda laughed as she carefully poured his cream. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means that I was\r\nlooking very seedy at the end of the season, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Well, we must\r\nshow wear at last, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson took the cup gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, no need to remind a man of\r\nseventy, who has just been home to find that he has survived all his\r\ncontemporaries. I was most gently treated\xe2\x80\x94as a sort of precious relic.\r\nBut, do you know, it made me feel awkward to be hanging about still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy? Never mention it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Hilda looked appreciatively at the\r\nProfessor\xe2\x80\x99s alert face, with so many kindly lines about the mouth and\r\nso many quizzical ones about the eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to hang about for\r\nme, you know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t even let you go home again. You must stay put,\r\nnow that I have you back. You\xe2\x80\x99re the realest thing I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cDear me, am I? Out of so many conquests and the\r\nspoils of conquered cities! You\xe2\x80\x99ve really missed me? Well, then, I\r\nshall hang. Even if you have at last to put ME in the mummy-room with\r\nthe others. You\xe2\x80\x99ll visit me often, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery day in the calendar. Here, your cigarettes are in this drawer,\r\nwhere you left them.\xe2\x80\x9d She struck a match and lit one for him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\r\ndid, after all, enjoy being at home again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. I found the long railway journeys trying. People live a\r\nthousand miles apart. But I did it thoroughly; I was all over the\r\nplace. It was in Boston I lingered longest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you saw Mrs. Alexander?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften. I dined with her, and had tea there a dozen different times, I\r\nshould think. Indeed, it was to see her that I lingered on and on. I\r\nfound that I still loved to go to the house. It always seemed as if\r\nBartley were there, somehow, and that at any moment one might hear his\r\nheavy tramp on the stairs. Do you know, I kept feeling that he must be\r\nup in his study.\xe2\x80\x9d The Professor looked reflectively into the grate. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould really have liked to go up there. That was where I had my last\r\nlong talk with him. But Mrs. Alexander never suggested it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson was a little startled by her tone, and he turned his head so\r\nquickly that his cuff-link caught the string of his nose-glasses and\r\npulled them awry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Why, dear me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She probably never\r\nthought of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda bit her lip. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what made me say that. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nto interrupt. Go on please, and tell me how it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was like that. Almost as if he were there. In a way, he\r\nreally is there. She never lets him go. It\xe2\x80\x99s the most beautiful and\r\ndignified sorrow I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known. It\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful that it has its\r\ncompensations, I should think. Its very completeness is a compensation.\r\nIt gives her a fixed star to steer by. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drift. We sat there\r\nevening after evening in the quiet of that magically haunted room, and\r\nwatched the sunset burn on the river, and felt him. Felt him with a\r\ndifference, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda leaned forward, her elbow on her knee, her chin on her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a difference? Because of her, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson\xe2\x80\x99s brow wrinkled. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething like that, yes. Of course, as time\r\ngoes on, to her he becomes more and more their simple personal\r\nrelation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda studied the droop of the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s head intently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\naltogether like that? You felt it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wholly fair to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson shook himself and readjusted his glasses. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, fair enough. More\r\nthan fair. Of course, I always felt that my image of him was just a\r\nlittle different from hers. No relation is so complete that it can hold\r\nabsolutely all of a person. And I liked him just as he was; his\r\ndeviations, too; the places where he didn\xe2\x80\x99t square.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda considered vaguely. \xe2\x80\x9cHas she grown much older?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and no. In a tragic way she is even handsomer. But colder. Cold\r\nfor everything but him. \xe2\x80\x98Forget thyself to marble\xe2\x80\x99; I kept thinking of\r\nthat. Her happiness was a happiness _\xc3\xa0 deux_, not apart from the world,\r\nbut actually against it. And now her grief is like that. She saves\r\nherself for it and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even go through the form of seeing people\r\nmuch. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. It would be better for her, and might be so good for\r\nthem, if she could let other people in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of letting him out a little, of sharing him with\r\nsomebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson put down his cup and looked up with vague alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cDear me, it\r\ntakes a woman to think of that, now! I don\xe2\x80\x99t, you know, think we ought\r\nto be hard on her. More, even, than the rest of us she didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose\r\nher destiny. She underwent it. And it has left her chilled. As to her\r\nnot wishing to take the world into her confidence\xe2\x80\x94well, it is a pretty\r\nbrutal and stupid world, after all, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda leaned forward. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know, I know. Only I can\xe2\x80\x99t help being\r\nglad that there was something for him even in stupid and vulgar people.\r\nMy little Marie worshiped him. When she is dusting I always know when\r\nshe has come to his picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! He left an echo. The ripples go on in all of\r\nus. He belonged to the people who make the play, and most of us are\r\nonly onlookers at the best. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder too much at Mrs.\r\nAlexander. She must feel how useless it would be to stir about, that\r\nshe may as well sit still; that nothing can happen to her after\r\nBartley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda softly, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing can happen to one after Bartley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both sat looking into the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARREL ORGAN by Alfred Noyes\r\n\r\n\r\n    There\xe2\x80\x99s a barrel-organ caroling across a golden street,\r\n    In the City as the sun sinks low;\r\nAnd the music\xe2\x80\x99s not immortal; but the world has made it sweet\r\n    And fulfilled it with the sunset glow;\r\nAnd it pulses through the pleasures of the City and the pain\r\n    That surround the singing organ like a large eternal light;\r\nAnd they\xe2\x80\x99ve given it a glory and a part to play again\r\n    In the Symphony that rules the day and the night.\r\n\r\nAnd now it\xe2\x80\x99s marching onward through the realms of old romance,\r\n    And trolling out a fond familiar tune,\r\nAnd now it\xe2\x80\x99s roaring cannon down to fight the King of France,\r\n    And now it\xe2\x80\x99s prattling softly to the moon,\r\nAnd all around the organ there\xe2\x80\x99s a sea without a shore\r\n    Of human joys and wonders and regrets;\r\nTo remember and to recompense the music evermore\r\n    For what the cold machinery forgets. . . .\r\n\r\nYes; as the music changes,\r\n    Like a prismatic glass,\r\nIt takes the light and ranges\r\n    Through all the moods that pass;\r\nDissects the common carnival\r\n    Of passions and regrets,\r\nAnd gives the world a glimpse of all\r\n    The colors it forgets.\r\n\r\nAnd there _La Traviata_ sights\r\n    Another sadder song;\r\nAnd there _Il Trovatore_ cries\r\n    A tale of deeper wrong;\r\nAnd bolder knights to battle go\r\n    With sword and shield and lance,\r\nThan ever here on earth below\r\n    Have whirled into\xe2\x80\x94_a dance!_\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nGo down to Kew in lilac time;

Hark, a hundred thousand feet\r\nAre marching on to glory through the poppies and the wheat\r\n    In the land where the dead dreams go.\r\n\r\n        So it\xe2\x80\x99s Jeremiah, Jeremiah,\r\n            What have you to say\r\n        When you meet the garland girls\r\n            Tripping on their way?\r\n\r\n        All around my gala hat\r\n            I wear a wreath of roses\r\n        (A long and lonely year it is\r\n            I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited for the May!)\r\n\r\n        If any one should ask you,\r\n            The reason why I wear it is,\r\n        My own love, my true love, is coming home to-day.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s buy a bunch of violets for the lady\r\n    (_It\xe2\x80\x99s lilac time in London; it\xe2\x80\x99s lilac time in London!_)\r\nBuy a bunch of violets for the lady;\r\n    While the sky burns blue above:\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the street you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it shady\r\n    (_It\xe2\x80\x99s lilac time in London; it\xe2\x80\x99s lilac time in London!_)\r\nBut buy a bunch of violets for the lady;\r\n    And tell her she\xe2\x80\x99s your own true love.\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a barrel-organ caroling across a golden street,\r\n    In the City as the sun sinks glittering and slow;\r\nAnd the music\xe2\x80\x99s not immortal, but the world has made it sweet\r\nAnd enriched it with the harmonies that make a song complete\r\nIn the deeper heavens of music where the night and morning meet,\r\n    As it dies into the sunset glow;\r\n\r\nAnd it pulses through the pleasures of the City and the pain\r\n    That surround the singing organ like a large eternal light,\r\nAnd they\xe2\x80\x99ve given it a glory and a part of play again\r\n    In the Symphony that rules the day and night.\r\n\r\n        And there, as the music changes,\r\n            The song runs round again;\r\n        Once more it turns and ranges\r\n            Through all its joy and pain:\r\n        Dissects the common carnival\r\n            Of passions and regrets;\r\n        And the wheeling world remembers all\r\n            The wheeling song forgets.\r\n\r\n        Once more _La Traviata_ sighs\r\n            Another sadder song:\r\n        Once more _Il Trovatore_ cries\r\n            A tale of deeper wrong;\r\n        Once more the knights to battle go\r\n            With sword and shield and lance,\r\n        Till once, once more, the shattered foe\r\n            Has whirled into\xe2\x80\x94_a dance!_\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n_Come down to Kew in lilac time; in lilac time; in lilac time;\r\n    Come down to Kew in lilac time;_ (_it isn\xe2\x80\x99t far from London!_)\r\n_And you shall wander hand in hand with love in summer\xe2\x80\x99s wonderland;\r\n    Come down to Kew in lilac time;_ (_it isn\xe2\x80\x99t far from London!_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALEXANDER\xe2\x80\x99S BRIDGE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
