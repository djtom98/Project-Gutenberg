Yet he was\r\nunwilling to take leave, treating his engagement as settled, without some\r\nmore conventional glance in that direction than he could find an opening\r\nfor in the manner of the large affable lady who sat there drawing a pair\r\nof soiled gants de Suede through a fat jewelled hand and, at once\r\npressing and gliding, repeated over and over everything but the thing he\r\nwould have liked to hear.  He would have liked to hear the figure of his\r\nsalary; but just as he was nervously about to sound that note the little\r\nboy came back--the little boy Mrs. Moreen had sent out of the room to\r\nfetch her fan.  He came back without the fan, only with the casual\r\nobservation that he couldn\'t find it.  As he dropped this cynical\r\nconfession he looked straight and hard at the candidate for the honour of\r\ntaking his education in hand.  This personage reflected somewhat grimly\r\nthat the thing he should have to teach his little charge would be to\r\nappear to address himself to his mother when he spoke to her--especially\r\nnot to make her such an improper answer as that.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Moreen bethought herself of this pretext for getting rid of\r\ntheir companion Pemberton supposed it was precisely to approach the\r\ndelicate subject of his remuneration.  But it had been only to say some\r\nthings about her son that it was better a boy of eleven shouldn\'t catch.\r\nThey were extravagantly to his advantage save when she lowered her voice\r\nto sigh, tapping her left side familiarly, "And all overclouded by\r\n_this_, you know; all at the mercy of a weakness--!"  Pemberton gathered\r\nthat the weakness was in the region of the heart.  He had known the poor\r\nchild was not robust: this was the basis on which he had been invited to\r\ntreat, through an English lady, an Oxford acquaintance, then at Nice, who\r\nhappened to know both his needs and those of the amiable American family\r\nlooking out for something really superior in the way of a resident tutor.\r\n\r\nThe young man\'s impression of his prospective pupil, who had come into\r\nthe room as if to see for himself the moment Pemberton was admitted, was\r\nnot quite the soft solicitation the visitor had taken for granted.\r\nMorgan Moreen was somehow sickly without being "delicate," and that he\r\nlooked intelligent--it is true Pemberton wouldn\'t have enjoyed his being\r\nstupid--only added to the suggestion that, as with his big mouth and big\r\nears he really couldn\'t be called pretty, he might too utterly fail to\r\nplease.  Pemberton was modest, was even timid; and the chance that his\r\nsmall scholar might prove cleverer than himself had quite figured, to his\r\nanxiety, among the dangers of an untried experiment.  He reflected,\r\nhowever, that these were risks one had to run when one accepted a\r\nposition, as it was called, in a private family; when as yet one\'s\r\nuniversity honours had, pecuniarily speaking, remained barren.  At any\r\nrate when Mrs. Moreen got up as to intimate that, since it was understood\r\nhe would enter upon his duties within the week she would let him off now,\r\nhe succeeded, in spite of the presence of the child, in squeezing out a\r\nphrase about the rate of payment.  It was not the fault of the conscious\r\nsmile which seemed a reference to the lady\'s expensive identity, it was\r\nnot the fault of this demonstration, which had, in a sort, both vagueness\r\nand point, if the allusion didn\'t sound rather vulgar.  This was exactly\r\nbecause she became still more gracious to reply: "Oh I can assure you\r\nthat all that will be quite regular."\r\n\r\nPemberton only wondered, while he took up his hat, what "all that" was to\r\namount to--people had such different ideas.  Mrs. Moreen\'s words,\r\nhowever, seemed to commit the family to a pledge definite enough to\r\nelicit from the child a strange little comment in the shape of the\r\nmocking foreign ejaculation "Oh la-la!"\r\n\r\nPemberton, in some confusion, glanced at him as he walked slowly to the\r\nwindow with his back turned, his hands in his pockets and the air in his\r\nelderly shoulders of a boy who didn\'t play.  The young man wondered if he\r\nshould be able to teach him to play, though his mother had said it would\r\nnever do and that this was why school was impossible.  Mrs. Moreen\r\nexhibited no discomfiture; she only continued blandly: "Mr. Moreen will\r\nbe delighted to meet your wishes.  As I told you, he has been called to\r\nLondon for a week.  As soon as he comes back you shall have it out with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nThis was so frank and friendly that the young man could only reply,\r\nlaughing as his hostess laughed: "Oh I don\'t imagine we shall have much\r\nof a battle."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll give you anything you like," the boy remarked unexpectedly,\r\nreturning from the window.  "We don\'t mind what anything costs--we live\r\nawfully well."\r\n\r\n"My darling, you\'re too quaint!" his mother exclaimed, putting out to\r\ncaress him a practised but ineffectual hand.  He slipped out of it, but\r\nlooked with intelligent innocent eyes at Pemberton, who had already had\r\ntime to notice that from one moment to the other his small satiric face\r\nseemed to change its time of life.  At this moment it was infantine, yet\r\nit appeared also to be under the influence of curious intuitions and\r\nknowledges.  Pemberton rather disliked precocity and was disappointed to\r\nfind gleams of it in a disciple not yet in his teens.  Nevertheless he\r\ndivined on the spot that Morgan wouldn\'t prove a bore.  He would prove on\r\nthe contrary a source of agitation.  This idea held the young man, in\r\nspite of a certain repulsion.\r\n\r\n"You pompous little person!  We\'re not extravagant!"  Mrs. Moreen gaily\r\nprotested, making another unsuccessful attempt to draw the boy to her\r\nside.  "You must know what to expect," she went on to Pemberton.\r\n\r\n"The less you expect the better!" her companion interposed.  "But we\r\n_are_ people of fashion."\r\n\r\n"Only so far as _you_ make us so!" Mrs. Moreen tenderly mocked.  "Well\r\nthen, on Friday--don\'t tell me you\'re superstitious--and mind you don\'t\r\nfail us.  Then you\'ll see us all.  I\'m so sorry the girls are out.  I\r\nguess you\'ll like the girls.  And, you know, I\'ve another son, quite\r\ndifferent from this one."\r\n\r\n"He tries to imitate me," Morgan said to their friend.\r\n\r\n"He tries?  Why he\'s twenty years old!" cried Mrs. Moreen.\r\n\r\n"You\'re very witty," Pemberton remarked to the child--a proposition his\r\nmother echoed with enthusiasm, declaring Morgan\'s sallies to be the\r\ndelight of the house.\r\n\r\nThe boy paid no heed to this; he only enquired abruptly of the visitor,\r\nwho was surprised afterwards that he hadn\'t struck him as offensively\r\nforward: "Do you _want_ very much to come?"\r\n\r\n"Can you doubt it after such a description of what I shall hear?"\r\nPemberton replied.  Yet he didn\'t want to come at all; he was coming\r\nbecause he had to go somewhere, thanks to the collapse of his fortune at\r\nthe end of a year abroad spent on the system of putting his scant\r\npatrimony into a single full wave of experience.  He had had his full\r\nwave but couldn\'t pay the score at his inn.  Moreover he had caught in\r\nthe boy\'s eyes the glimpse of a far-off appeal.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll do the best I can for you," said Morgan; with which he turned\r\naway again.  He passed out of one of the long windows; Pemberton saw him\r\ngo and lean on the parapet of the terrace.  He remained there while the\r\nyoung man took leave of his mother, who, on Pemberton\'s looking as if he\r\nexpected a farewell from him, interposed with: "Leave him, leave him;\r\nhe\'s so strange!"  Pemberton supposed her to fear something he might say.\r\n"He\'s a genius--you\'ll love him," she added.  "He\'s much the most\r\ninteresting person in the family."  And before he could invent some\r\ncivility to oppose to this she wound up with: "But we\'re all good, you\r\nknow!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a genius--you\'ll love him!" were words that recurred to our\r\naspirant before the Friday, suggesting among many things that geniuses\r\nwere not invariably loveable.  However, it was all the better if there\r\nwas an element that would make tutorship absorbing: he had perhaps taken\r\ntoo much for granted it would only disgust him.  As he left the villa\r\nafter his interview he looked up at the balcony and saw the child leaning\r\nover it.  "We shall have great larks!" he called up.\r\n\r\nMorgan hung fire a moment and then gaily returned: "By the time you come\r\nback I shall have thought of something witty!"\r\n\r\nThis made Pemberton say to himself "After all he\'s rather nice."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Friday he saw them all, as Mrs. Moreen had promised, for her\r\nhusband had come back and the girls and the other son were at home.  Mr.\r\nMoreen had a white moustache, a confiding manner and, in his buttonhole,\r\nthe ribbon of a foreign order--bestowed, as Pemberton eventually learned,\r\nfor services.  For what services he never clearly ascertained: this was a\r\npoint--one of a large number--that Mr. Moreen\'s manner never confided.\r\nWhat it emphatically did confide was that he was even more a man of the\r\nworld than you might first make out.  Ulick, the firstborn, was in\r\nvisible training for the same profession--under the disadvantage as yet,\r\nhowever, of a buttonhole but feebly floral and a moustache with no\r\npretensions to type.  The girls had hair and figures and manners and\r\nsmall fat feet, but had never been out alone.  As for Mrs. Moreen\r\nPemberton saw on a nearer view that her elegance was intermittent and her\r\nparts didn\'t always match.  Her husband, as she had promised, met with\r\nenthusiasm Pemberton\'s ideas in regard to a salary.  The young man had\r\nendeavoured to keep these stammerings modest, and Mr. Moreen made it no\r\nsecret that _he_ found them wanting in "style."  He further mentioned\r\nthat he aspired to be intimate with his children, to be their best\r\nfriend, and that he was always looking out for them.  That was what he\r\nwent off for, to London and other places--to look out; and this vigilance\r\nwas the theory of life, as well as the real occupation, of the whole\r\nfamily.  They all looked out, for they were very frank on the subject of\r\nits being necessary.  They desired it to be understood that they were\r\nearnest people, and also that their fortune, though quite adequate for\r\nearnest people, required the most careful administration.  Mr. Moreen, as\r\nthe parent bird, sought sustenance for the nest.  Ulick invoked support\r\nmainly at the club, where Pemberton guessed that it was usually served on\r\ngreen cloth.  The girls used to do up their hair and their frocks\r\nthemselves, and our young man felt appealed to to be glad, in regard to\r\nMorgan\'s education, that, though it must naturally be of the best, it\r\ndidn\'t cost too much.  After a little he _was_ glad, forgetting at times\r\nhis own needs in the interest inspired by the child\'s character and\r\nculture and the pleasure of making easy terms for him.\r\n\r\nDuring the first weeks of their acquaintance Morgan had been as puzzling\r\nas a page in an unknown language--altogether different from the obvious\r\nlittle Anglo-Saxons who had misrepresented childhood to Pemberton.\r\nIndeed the whole mystic volume in which the boy had been amateurishly\r\nbound demanded some practice in translation.  To-day, after a\r\nconsiderable interval, there is something phantasmagoria, like a\r\nprismatic reflexion or a serial novel, in Pemberton\'s memory of the\r\nqueerness of the Moreens.  If it were not for a few tangible tokens--a\r\nlock of Morgan\'s hair cut by his own hand, and the half-dozen letters\r\nreceived from him when they were disjoined--the whole episode and the\r\nfigures peopling it would seem too inconsequent for anything but\r\ndreamland.  Their supreme quaintness was their success--as it appeared to\r\nhim for a while at the time; since he had never seen a family so\r\nbrilliantly equipped for failure.  Wasn\'t it success to have kept him so\r\nhatefully long?  Wasn\'t it success to have drawn him in that first\r\nmorning at dejeuner, the Friday he came--it was enough to _make_ one\r\nsuperstitious--so that he utterly committed himself, and this not by\r\ncalculation or on a signal, but from a happy instinct which made them,\r\nlike a band of gipsies, work so neatly together?  They amused him as much\r\nas if they had really been a band of gipsies.  He was still young and had\r\nnot seen much of the world--his English years had been properly arid;\r\ntherefore the reversed conventions of the Moreens--for they had _their_\r\ndesperate proprieties--struck him as topsy-turvy.  He had encountered\r\nnothing like them at Oxford; still less had any such note been struck to\r\nhis younger American ear during the four years at Yale in which he had\r\nrichly supposed himself to be reacting against a Puritan strain.  The\r\nreaction of the Moreens, at any rate, went ever so much further.  He had\r\nthought himself very sharp that first day in hitting them all off in his\r\nmind with the "cosmopolite" label.  Later it seemed feeble and\r\ncolourless--confessedly helplessly provisional.\r\n\r\nHe yet when he first applied it felt a glow of joy--for an instructor he\r\nwas still empirical--rise from the apprehension that living with them\r\nwould really be to see life.  Their sociable strangeness was an\r\nintimation of that--their chatter of tongues, their gaiety and good\r\nhumour, their infinite dawdling (they were always getting themselves up,\r\nbut it took forever, and Pemberton had once found Mr. Moreen shaving in\r\nthe drawing-room), their French, their Italian and, cropping up in the\r\nforeign fluencies, their cold tough slices of American.  They lived on\r\nmacaroni and coffee--they had these articles prepared in perfection--but\r\nthey knew recipes for a hundred other dishes.  They overflowed with music\r\nand song, were always humming and catching each other up, and had a sort\r\nof professional acquaintance with Continental cities.  They talked of\r\n"good places" as if they had been pickpockets or strolling players.  They\r\nhad at Nice a villa, a carriage, a piano and a banjo, and they went to\r\nofficial parties.  They were a perfect calendar of the "days" of their\r\nfriends, which Pemberton knew them, when they were indisposed, to get out\r\nof bed to go to, and which made the week larger than life when Mrs.\r\nMoreen talked of them with Paula and Amy.  Their initiations gave their\r\nnew inmate at first an almost dazzling sense of culture.  Mrs. Moreen had\r\ntranslated something at some former period--an author whom it made\r\nPemberton feel borne never to have heard of.  They could imitate Venetian\r\nand sing Neapolitan, and when they wanted to say something very\r\nparticular communicated with each other in an ingenious dialect of their\r\nown, an elastic spoken cipher which Pemberton at first took for some\r\npatois of one of their countries, but which he "caught on to" as he would\r\nnot have grasped provincial development of Spanish or German.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the family language--Ultramoreen," Morgan explained to him drolly\r\nenough; but the boy rarely condescended to use it himself, though he\r\ndealt in colloquial Latin as if he had been a little prelate.\r\n\r\nAmong all the "days" with which Mrs. Moreen\'s memory was taxed she\r\nmanaged to squeeze in one of her own, which her friends sometimes forgot.\r\nBut the house drew a frequented air from the number of fine people who\r\nwere freely named there and from several mysterious men with foreign\r\ntitles and English clothes whom Morgan called the princes and who, on\r\nsofas with the girls, talked French very loud--though sometimes with some\r\noddity of accent--as if to show they were saying nothing improper.\r\nPemberton wondered how the princes could ever propose in that tone and so\r\npublicly: he took for granted cynically that this was what was desired of\r\nthem.  Then he recognised that even for the chance of such an advantage\r\nMrs. Moreen would never allow Paula and Amy to receive alone.  These\r\nyoung ladies were not at all timid, but it was just the safeguards that\r\nmade them so candidly free.  It was a houseful of Bohemians who wanted\r\ntremendously to be Philistines.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, however, certainly they achieved no rigour--they were\r\nwonderfully amiable and ecstatic about Morgan.  It was a genuine\r\ntenderness, an artless admiration, equally strong in each.  They even\r\npraised his beauty, which was small, and were as afraid of him as if they\r\nfelt him of finer clay.  They spoke of him as a little angel and a\r\nprodigy--they touched on his want of health with long vague faces.\r\nPemberton feared at first an extravagance that might make him hate the\r\nboy, but before this happened he had become extravagant himself.  Later,\r\nwhen he had grown rather to hate the others, it was a bribe to patience\r\nfor him that they were at any rate nice about Morgan, going on tiptoe if\r\nthey fancied he was showing symptoms, and even giving up somebody\'s "day"\r\nto procure him a pleasure.  Mixed with this too was the oddest wish to\r\nmake him independent, as if they had felt themselves not good enough for\r\nhim.  They passed him over to the new members of their circle very much\r\nas if wishing to force some charity of adoption on so free an agent and\r\nget rid of their own charge.  They were delighted when they saw Morgan\r\ntake so to his kind playfellow, and could think of no higher praise for\r\nthe young man.  It was strange how they contrived to reconcile the\r\nappearance, and indeed the essential fact, of adoring the child with\r\ntheir eagerness to wash their hands of him.  Did they want to get rid of\r\nhim before he should find them out?  Pemberton was finding them out month\r\nby month.  The boy\'s fond family, however this might be, turned their\r\nbacks with exaggerated delicacy, as if to avoid the reproach of\r\ninterfering.  Seeing in time how little he had in common with them--it\r\nwas by _them_ he first observed it; they proclaimed it with complete\r\nhumility--his companion was moved to speculate on the mysteries of\r\ntransmission, the far jumps of heredity.  Where his detachment from most\r\nof the things they represented had come from was more than an observer\r\ncould say--it certainly had burrowed under two or three generations.\r\n\r\nAs for Pemberton\'s own estimate of his pupil, it was a good while before\r\nhe got the point of view, so little had he been prepared for it by the\r\nsmug young barbarians to whom the tradition of tutorship, as hitherto\r\nrevealed to him, had been adjusted.  Morgan was scrappy and surprising,\r\ndeficient in many properties supposed common to the genus and abounding\r\nin others that were the portion only of the supernaturally clever.  One\r\nday his friend made a great stride: it cleared up the question to\r\nperceive that Morgan _was_ supernaturally clever and that, though the\r\nformula was temporarily meagre, this would be the only assumption on\r\nwhich one could successfully deal with him.  He had the general quality\r\nof a child for whom life had not been simplified by school, a kind of\r\nhomebred sensibility which might have been as bad for himself but was\r\ncharming for others, and a whole range of refinement and\r\nperception--little musical vibrations as taking as picked-up\r\nairs--begotten by wandering about Europe at the tail of his migratory\r\ntribe.  This might not have been an education to recommend in advance,\r\nbut its results with so special a subject were as appreciable as the\r\nmarks on a piece of fine porcelain.  There was at the same time in him a\r\nsmall strain of stoicism, doubtless the fruit of having had to begin\r\nearly to bear pain, which counted for pluck and made it of less\r\nconsequence that he might have been thought at school rather a polyglot\r\nlittle beast.  Pemberton indeed quickly found himself rejoicing that\r\nschool was out of the question: in any million of boys it was probably\r\ngood for all but one, and Morgan was that millionth.  It would have made\r\nhim comparative and superior--it might have made him really require\r\nkicking.  Pemberton would try to be school himself--a bigger seminary\r\nthan five hundred grazing donkeys, so that, winning no prizes, the boy\r\nwould remain unconscious and irresponsible and amusing--amusing, because,\r\nthough life was already intense in his childish nature, freshness still\r\nmade there a strong draught for jokes.  It turned out that even in the\r\nstill air of Morgan\'s various disabilities jokes flourished greatly.  He\r\nwas a pale lean acute undeveloped little cosmopolite, who liked\r\nintellectual gymnastics and who also, as regards the behaviour of\r\nmankind, had noticed more things than you might suppose, but who\r\nnevertheless had his proper playroom of superstitions, where he smashed a\r\ndozen toys a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Nice once, toward evening, as the pair rested in the open air after a\r\nwalk, and looked over the sea at the pink western lights, he said\r\nsuddenly to his comrade: "Do you like it, you know--being with us all in\r\nthis intimate way?"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, why should I stay if I didn\'t?"\r\n\r\n"How do I know you\'ll stay?  I\'m almost sure you won\'t, very long."\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t mean to dismiss me," said Pemberton.\r\n\r\nMorgan debated, looking at the sunset.  "I think if I did right I ought\r\nto."\r\n\r\n"Well, I know I\'m supposed to instruct you in virtue; but in that case\r\ndon\'t do right."\r\n\r\n"\'You\'re very young--fortunately," Morgan went on, turning to him again.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, compared with you!"\r\n\r\n"Therefore it won\'t matter so much if you do lose a lot of time."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way to look at it," said Pemberton accommodatingly.\r\n\r\nThey were silent a minute; after which the boy asked: "Do you like my\r\nfather and my mother very much?"\r\n\r\n"Dear me, yes.  They\'re charming people."\r\n\r\nMorgan received this with another silence; then unexpectedly, familiarly,\r\nbut at the same time affectionately, he remarked: "You\'re a jolly old\r\nhumbug!"\r\n\r\nFor a particular reason the words made our young man change colour.  The\r\nboy noticed in an instant that he had turned red, whereupon he turned red\r\nhimself and pupil and master exchanged a longish glance in which there\r\nwas a consciousness of many more things than are usually touched upon,\r\neven tacitly, in such a relation.  It produced for Pemberton an\r\nembarrassment; it raised in a shadowy form a question--this was the first\r\nglimpse of it--destined to play a singular and, as he imagined, owing to\r\nthe altogether peculiar conditions, an unprecedented part in his\r\nintercourse with his little companion.  Later, when he found himself\r\ntalking with the youngster in a way in which few youngsters could ever\r\nhave been talked with, he thought of that clumsy moment on the bench at\r\nNice as the dawn of an understanding that had broadened.  What had added\r\nto the clumsiness then was that he thought it his duty to declare to\r\nMorgan that he might abuse him, Pemberton, as much as he liked, but must\r\nnever abuse his parents.  To this Morgan had the easy retort that he\r\nhadn\'t dreamed of abusing them; which appeared to be true: it put\r\nPemberton in the wrong.\r\n\r\n"Then why am I a humbug for saying _I_ think them charming?" the young\r\nman asked, conscious of a certain rashness.\r\n\r\n"Well--they\'re not your parents."\r\n\r\n"They love you better than anything in the world--never forget that,"\r\nsaid Pemberton.\r\n\r\n"Is that why you like them so much?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re very kind to me," Pemberton replied evasively.\r\n\r\n"You _are_ a humbug!" laughed Morgan, passing an arm into his tutor\'s.\r\nHe leaned against him looking oft at the sea again and swinging his long\r\nthin legs.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t kick my shins," said Pemberton while he reflected "Hang it, I\r\ncan\'t complain of them to the child!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s another reason, too," Morgan went on, keeping his legs still.\r\n\r\n"Another reason for what?"\r\n\r\n"Besides their not being your parents."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you," said Pemberton.\r\n\r\n"Well, you will before long.  All right!"\r\n\r\nHe did understand fully before long, but he made a fight even with\r\nhimself before he confessed it.  He thought it the oddest thing to have a\r\nstruggle with the child about.  He wondered he didn\'t hate the hope of\r\nthe Moreens for bringing the struggle on.  But by the time it began any\r\nsuch sentiment for that scion was closed to him.  Morgan was a special\r\ncase, and to know him was to accept him on his own odd terms.  Pemberton\r\nhad spent his aversion to special cases before arriving at knowledge.\r\nWhen at last he did arrive his quandary was great.  Against every\r\ninterest he had attached himself.  They would have to meet things\r\ntogether.  Before they went home that evening at Nice the boy had said,\r\nclinging to his arm:\r\n\r\n"Well, at any rate you\'ll hang on to the last."\r\n\r\n"To the last?"\r\n\r\n"Till you\'re fairly beaten."\r\n\r\n"_You_ ought to be fairly beaten!" cried the young man, drawing him\r\ncloser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nA year after he had come to live with them Mr. and Mrs. Moreen suddenly\r\ngave up the villa at Nice.  Pemberton had got used to suddenness, having\r\nseen it practised on a considerable scale during two jerky little\r\ntours--one in Switzerland the first summer, and the other late in the\r\nwinter, when they all ran down to Florence and then, at the end of ten\r\ndays, liking it much less than they had intended, straggled back in\r\nmysterious depression.  They had returned to Nice "for ever," as they\r\nsaid; but this didn\'t prevent their squeezing, one rainy muggy May night,\r\ninto a second-class railway-carriage--you could never tell by which class\r\nthey would travel--where Pemberton helped them to stow away a wonderful\r\ncollection of bundles and bags.  The explanation of this manoeuvre was\r\nthat they had determined to spend the summer "in some bracing place"; but\r\nin Paris they dropped into a small furnished apartment--a fourth floor in\r\na third-rate avenue, where there was a smell on the staircase and the\r\nportier was hateful--and passed the next four months in blank indigence.\r\n\r\nThe better part of this baffled sojourn was for the preceptor and his\r\npupil, who, visiting the Invalides and Notre Dame, the Conciergerie and\r\nall the museums, took a hundred remunerative rambles.  They learned to\r\nknow their Paris, which was useful, for they came back another year for a\r\nlonger stay, the general character of which in Pemberton\'s memory to-day\r\nmixes pitiably and confusedly with that of the first.  He sees Morgan\'s\r\nshabby knickerbockers--the everlasting pair that didn\'t match his blouse\r\nand that as he grew longer could only grow faded.  He remembers the\r\nparticular holes in his three or four pair of coloured stockings.\r\n\r\nMorgan was dear to his mother, but he never was better dressed than was\r\nabsolutely necessary--partly, no doubt, by his own fault, for he was as\r\nindifferent to his appearance as a German philosopher.  "My dear fellow,\r\nyou _are_ coming to pieces," Pemberton would say to him in sceptical\r\nremonstrance; to which the child would reply, looking at him serenely up\r\nand down: "My dear fellow, so are you!  I don\'t want to cast you in the\r\nshade."  Pemberton could have no rejoinder for this--the assertion so\r\nclosely represented the fact.  If however the deficiencies of his own\r\nwardrobe were a chapter by themselves he didn\'t like his little charge to\r\nlook too poor.  Later he used to say "Well, if we\'re poor, why, after\r\nall, shouldn\'t we look it?" and he consoled himself with thinking there\r\nwas something rather elderly and gentlemanly in Morgan\'s disrepair--it\r\ndiffered from the untidiness of the urchin who plays and spoils his\r\nthings.  He could trace perfectly the degrees by which, in proportion as\r\nher little son confined himself to his tutor for society, Mrs. Moreen\r\nshrewdly forbore to renew his garments.  She did nothing that didn\'t\r\nshow, neglected him because he escaped notice, and then, as he\r\nillustrated this clever policy, discouraged at home his public\r\nappearances.  Her position was logical enough--those members of her\r\nfamily who did show had to be showy.\r\n\r\nDuring this period and several others Pemberton was quite aware of how he\r\nand his comrade might strike people; wandering languidly through the\r\nJardin des Plantes as if they had nowhere to go, sitting on the winter\r\ndays in the galleries of the Louvre, so splendidly ironical to the\r\nhomeless, as if for the advantage of the calorifere.  They joked about it\r\nsometimes: it was the sort of joke that was perfectly within the boy\'s\r\ncompass.  They figured themselves as part of the vast vague hand-to-mouth\r\nmultitude of the enormous city and pretended they were proud of their\r\nposition in it--it showed them "such a lot of life" and made them\r\nconscious of a democratic brotherhood.  If Pemberton couldn\'t feel a\r\nsympathy in destitution with his small companion--for after all Morgan\'s\r\nfond parents would never have let him really suffer--the boy would at\r\nleast feel it with him, so it came to the same thing.  He used sometimes\r\nto wonder what people would think they were--to fancy they were looked\r\naskance at, as if it might be a suspected case of kidnapping.  Morgan\r\nwouldn\'t be taken for a young patrician with a preceptor--he wasn\'t smart\r\nenough; though he might pass for his companion\'s sickly little brother.\r\nNow and then he had a five-franc piece, and except once, when they bought\r\na couple of lovely neckties, one of which he made Pemberton accept, they\r\nlaid it out scientifically in old books.  This was sure to be a great\r\nday, always spent on the quays, in a rummage of the dusty boxes that\r\ngarnish the parapets.  Such occasions helped them to live, for their\r\nbooks ran low very soon after the beginning of their acquaintance.\r\nPemberton had a good many in England, but he was obliged to write to a\r\nfriend and ask him kindly to get some fellow to give him something for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf they had to relinquish that summer the advantage of the bracing\r\nclimate the young man couldn\'t but suspect this failure of the cup when\r\nat their very lips to have been the effect of a rude jostle of his own.\r\nThis had represented his first blow-out, as he called it, with his\r\npatrons; his first successful attempt--though there was little other\r\nsuccess about it--to bring them to a consideration of his impossible\r\nposition.  As the ostensible eve of a costly journey the moment had\r\nstruck him as favourable to an earnest protest, the presentation of an\r\nultimatum.  Ridiculous as it sounded, he had never yet been able to\r\ncompass an uninterrupted private interview with the elder pair or with\r\neither of them singly.  They were always flanked by their elder children,\r\nand poor Pemberton usually had his own little charge at his side.  He was\r\nconscious of its being a house in which the surface of one\'s delicacy got\r\nrather smudged; nevertheless he had preserved the bloom of his scruple\r\nagainst announcing to Mr. and Mrs. Moreen with publicity that he\r\nshouldn\'t be able to go on longer without a little money.  He was still\r\nsimple enough to suppose Ulick and Paula and Amy might not know that\r\nsince his arrival he had only had a hundred and forty francs; and he was\r\nmagnanimous enough to wish not to compromise their parents in their eyes.\r\nMr. Moreen now listened to him, as he listened to every one and to every\r\nthing, like a man of the world, and seemed to appeal to him--though not\r\nof course too grossly--to try and be a little more of one himself.\r\nPemberton recognised in fact the importance of the character--from the\r\nadvantage it gave Mr. Moreen.  He was not even confused or embarrassed,\r\nwhereas the young man in his service was more so than there was any\r\nreason for.  Neither was he surprised--at least any more than a gentleman\r\nhad to be who freely confessed himself a little shocked--though not\r\nperhaps strictly at Pemberton.\r\n\r\n"We must go into this, mustn\'t we, dear?" he said to his wife.  He\r\nassured his young friend that the matter should have his very best\r\nattention; and he melted into space as elusively as if, at the door, he\r\nwere taking an inevitable but deprecatory precedence.  When, the next\r\nmoment, Pemberton found himself alone with Mrs. Moreen it was to hear her\r\nsay "I see, I see"--stroking the roundness of her chin and looking as if\r\nshe were only hesitating between a dozen easy remedies.  If they didn\'t\r\nmake their push Mr. Moreen could at least disappear for several days.\r\nDuring his absence his wife took up the subject again spontaneously, but\r\nher contribution to it was merely that she had thought all the while they\r\nwere getting on so beautifully.  Pemberton\'s reply to this revelation was\r\nthat unless they immediately put down something on account he would leave\r\nthem on the spot and for ever.  He knew she would wonder how he would get\r\naway, and for a moment expected her to enquire.  She didn\'t, for which he\r\nwas almost grateful to her, so little was he in a position to tell.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t, you _know_ you won\'t--you\'re too interested," she said.  "You\r\nare interested, you know you are, you dear kind man!"  She laughed with\r\nalmost condemnatory archness, as if it were a reproach--though she\r\nwouldn\'t insist; and flirted a soiled pocket-handkerchief at him.\r\n\r\nPemberton\'s mind was fully made up to take his step the following week.\r\nThis would give him time to get an answer to a letter he had despatched\r\nto England.  If he did in the event nothing of the sort--that is if he\r\nstayed another year and then went away only for three months--it was not\r\nmerely because before the answer to his letter came (most unsatisfactory\r\nwhen it did arrive) Mr. Moreen generously counted out to him, and again\r\nwith the sacrifice to "form" of a marked man of the world, three hundred\r\nfrancs in elegant ringing gold.  He was irritated to find that Mrs.\r\nMoreen was right, that he couldn\'t at the pinch bear to leave the child.\r\nThis stood out clearer for the very reason that, the night of his\r\ndesperate appeal to his patrons, he had seen fully for the first time\r\nwhere he was.  Wasn\'t it another proof of the success with which those\r\npatrons practised their arts that they had managed to avert for so long\r\nthe illuminating flash?  It descended on our friend with a breadth of\r\neffect which perhaps would have struck a spectator as comical, after he\r\nhad returned to his little servile room, which looked into a close court\r\nwhere a bare dirty opposite wall took, with the sound of shrill clatter,\r\nthe reflexion of lighted back windows.  He had simply given himself away\r\nto a band of adventurers.  The idea, the word itself, wore a romantic\r\nhorror for him--he had always lived on such safe lines.  Later it assumed\r\na more interesting, almost a soothing, sense: it pointed a moral, and\r\nPemberton could enjoy a moral.  The Moreens were adventurers not merely\r\nbecause they didn\'t pay their debts, because they lived on society, but\r\nbecause their whole view of life, dim and confused and instinctive, like\r\nthat of clever colour-blind animals, was speculative and rapacious and\r\nmean.  Oh they were "respectable," and that only made them more immondes.\r\nThe young man\'s analysis, while he brooded, put it at last very\r\nsimply--they were adventurers because they were toadies and snobs.  That\r\nwas the completest account of them--it was the law of their being.  Even\r\nwhen this truth became vivid to their ingenious inmate he remained\r\nunconscious of how much his mind had been prepared for it by the\r\nextraordinary little boy who had now become such a complication in his\r\nlife.  Much less could he then calculate on the information he was still\r\nto owe the extraordinary little boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was during the ensuing time that the real problem came up--the\r\nproblem of how far it was excusable to discuss the turpitude of parents\r\nwith a child of twelve, of thirteen, of fourteen.  Absolutely inexcusable\r\nand quite impossible it of course at first appeared; and indeed the\r\nquestion didn\'t press for some time after Pemberton had received his\r\nthree hundred francs.  They produced a temporary lull, a relief from the\r\nsharpest pressure.  The young man frugally amended his wardrobe and even\r\nhad a few francs in his pocket.  He thought the Moreens looked at him as\r\nif he were almost too smart, as if they ought to take care not to spoil\r\nhim.  If Mr. Moreen hadn\'t been such a man of the world he would perhaps\r\nhave spoken of the freedom of such neckties on the part of a subordinate.\r\nBut Mr. Moreen was always enough a man of the world to let things\r\npass--he had certainly shown that.  It was singular how Pemberton guessed\r\nthat Morgan, though saying nothing about it, knew something had happened.\r\nBut three hundred francs, especially when one owed money, couldn\'t last\r\nfor ever; and when the treasure was gone--the boy knew when it had\r\nfailed--Morgan did break ground.  The party had returned to Nice at the\r\nbeginning of the winter, but not to the charming villa.  They went to an\r\nhotel, where they stayed three months, and then moved to another\r\nestablishment, explaining that they had left the first because, after\r\nwaiting and waiting, they couldn\'t get the rooms they wanted.  These\r\napartments, the rooms they wanted, were generally very splendid; but\r\nfortunately they never _could_ get them--fortunately, I mean, for\r\nPemberton, who reflected always that if they had got them there would\r\nhave been a still scantier educational fund.  What Morgan said at last\r\nwas said suddenly, irrelevantly, when the moment came, in the middle of a\r\nlesson, and consisted of the apparently unfeeling words: "You ought to\r\nfiler, you know--you really ought."\r\n\r\nPemberton stared.  He had learnt enough French slang from Morgan to know\r\nthat to filer meant to cut sticks.  "Ah my dear fellow, don\'t turn me\r\noff!"\r\n\r\nMorgan pulled a Greek lexicon toward him--he used a Greek-German--to look\r\nout a word, instead of asking it of Pemberton.  "You can\'t go on like\r\nthis, you know."\r\n\r\n"Like what, my boy?"\r\n\r\n"You know they don\'t pay you up," said Morgan, blushing and turning his\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pay me?" Pemberton stared again and feigned amazement.  "What on\r\nearth put that into your head?"\r\n\r\n"It has been there a long time," the boy replied rummaging his book.\r\n\r\nPemberton was silent, then he went on: "I say, what are you hunting for?\r\nThey pay me beautifully."\r\n\r\n"I\'m hunting for the Greek for awful whopper," Morgan dropped.\r\n\r\n"Find that rather for gross impertinence and disabuse your mind.  What do\r\nI want of money?"\r\n\r\n"Oh that\'s another question!"\r\n\r\nPemberton wavered--he was drawn in different ways.  The severely correct\r\nthing would have been to tell the boy that such a matter was none of his\r\nbusiness and bid him go on with his lines.  But they were really too\r\nintimate for that; it was not the way he was in the habit of treating\r\nhim; there had been no reason it should be.  On the other hand Morgan had\r\nquite lighted on the truth--he really shouldn\'t be able to keep it up\r\nmuch longer; therefore why not let him know one\'s real motive for\r\nforsaking him?  At the same time it wasn\'t decent to abuse to one\'s pupil\r\nthe family of one\'s pupil; it was better to misrepresent than to do that.\r\nSo in reply to his comrade\'s last exclamation he just declared, to\r\ndismiss the subject, that he had received several payments.\r\n\r\n"I say--I say!" the boy ejaculated, laughing.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," Pemberton insisted.  "Give me your written\r\nrendering."\r\n\r\nMorgan pushed a copybook across the table, and he began to read the page,\r\nbut with something running in his head that made it no sense.  Looking up\r\nafter a minute or two he found the child\'s eyes fixed on him and felt in\r\nthem something strange.  Then Morgan said: "I\'m not afraid of the stern\r\nreality."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t yet seen the thing you _are_ afraid of--I\'ll do you that\r\njustice!"\r\n\r\nThis came out with a jump--it was perfectly true--and evidently gave\r\nMorgan pleasure.  "I\'ve thought of it a long time," he presently resumed.\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t think of it any more."\r\n\r\nThe boy appeared to comply, and they had a comfortable and even an\r\namusing hour.  They had a theory that they were very thorough, and yet\r\nthey seemed always to be in the amusing part of lessons, the intervals\r\nbetween the dull dark tunnels, where there were waysides and jolly views.\r\nYet the morning was brought to a violent as end by Morgan\'s suddenly\r\nleaning his arms on the table, burying his head in them and bursting into\r\ntears: at which Pemberton was the more startled that, as it then came\r\nover him, it was the first time he had ever seen the boy cry and that the\r\nimpression was consequently quite awful.\r\n\r\nThe next day, after much thought, he took a decision and, believing it to\r\nbe just, immediately acted on it.  He cornered Mr. and Mrs. Moreen again\r\nand let them know that if on the spot they didn\'t pay him all they owed\r\nhim he wouldn\'t only leave their house but would tell Morgan exactly what\r\nhad brought him to it.\r\n\r\n"Oh you _haven\'t_ told him?" cried Mrs. Moreen with a pacifying hand on\r\nher well-dressed bosom.\r\n\r\n"Without warning you?  For what do you take me?" the young man returned.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Moreen looked at each other; he could see that they\r\nappreciated, as tending to their security, his superstition of delicacy,\r\nand yet that there was a certain alarm in their relief.  "My dear\r\nfellow," Mr. Moreen demanded, "what use can you have, leading the quiet\r\nlife we all do, for such a lot of money?"--a question to which Pemberton\r\nmade no answer, occupied as he was in noting that what passed in the mind\r\nof his patrons was something like: "Oh then, if we\'ve felt that the\r\nchild, dear little angel, has judged us and how he regards us, and we\r\nhaven\'t been betrayed, he must have guessed--and in short it\'s\r\n_general_!" an inference that rather stirred up Mr. and Mrs. Moreen, as\r\nPemberton had desired it should.  At the same time, if he had supposed\r\nhis threat would do something towards bringing them round, he was\r\ndisappointed to find them taking for granted--how vulgar their perception\r\n_had_ been!--that he had already given them away.  There was a mystic\r\nuneasiness in their parental breasts, and that had been the inferior\r\nsense of it.  None the less however, his threat did touch them; for if\r\nthey had escaped it was only to meet a new danger.  Mr. Moreen appealed\r\nto him, on every precedent, as a man of the world; but his wife had\r\nrecourse, for the first time since his domestication with them, to a fine\r\nhauteur, reminding him that a devoted mother, with her child, had arts\r\nthat protected her against gross misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n"I should misrepresent you grossly if I accused you of common honesty!"\r\nour friend replied; but as he closed the door behind him sharply,\r\nthinking he had not done himself much good, while Mr. Moreen lighted\r\nanother cigarette, he heard his hostess shout after him more touchingly:\r\n\r\n"Oh you do, you _do_, put the knife to one\'s throat!"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, very early, she came to his room.  He recognised her\r\nknock, but had no hope she brought him money; as to which he was wrong,\r\nfor she had fifty francs in her hand.  She squeezed forward in her\r\ndressing-gown, and he received her in his own, between his bath-tub and\r\nhis bed.  He had been tolerably schooled by this time to the "foreign\r\nways" of his hosts.  Mrs. Moreen was ardent, and when she was ardent she\r\ndidn\'t care what she did; so she now sat down on his bed, his clothes\r\nbeing on the chairs, and, in her preoccupation, forgot, as she glanced\r\nround, to be ashamed of giving him such a horrid room.  What Mrs.\r\nMoreen\'s ardour now bore upon was the design of persuading him that in\r\nthe first place she was very good-natured to bring him fifty francs, and\r\nthat in the second, if he would only see it, he was really too absurd to\r\nexpect to be paid.  Wasn\'t he paid enough without perpetual money--wasn\'t\r\nhe paid by the comfortable luxurious home he enjoyed with them all,\r\nwithout a care, an anxiety, a solitary want?  Wasn\'t he sure of his\r\nposition, and wasn\'t that everything to a young man like him, quite\r\nunknown, with singularly little to show, the ground of whose exorbitant\r\npretensions it had never been easy to discover?  Wasn\'t he paid above all\r\nby the sweet relation he had established with Morgan--quite ideal as from\r\nmaster to pupil--and by the simple privilege of knowing and living with\r\nso amazingly gifted a child; than whom really (and she meant literally\r\nwhat she said) there was no better company in Europe?  Mrs. Moreen\r\nherself took to appealing to him as a man of the world; she said "Voyons,\r\nmon cher," and "My dear man, look here now"; and urged him to be\r\nreasonable, putting it before him that it was truly a chance for him.\r\nShe spoke as if, according as he _should_ be reasonable, he would prove\r\nhimself worthy to be her son\'s tutor and of the extraordinary confidence\r\nthey had placed in him.\r\n\r\nAfter all, Pemberton reflected, it was only a difference of theory and\r\nthe theory didn\'t matter much.  They had hitherto gone on that of\r\nremunerated, as now they would go on that of gratuitous, service; but why\r\nshould they have so many words about it?  Mrs. Moreen at all events\r\ncontinued to be convincing; sitting there with her fifty francs she\r\ntalked and reiterated, as women reiterate, and bored and irritated him,\r\nwhile he leaned against the wall with his hands in the pockets of his\r\nwrapper, drawing it together round his legs and looking over the head of\r\nhis visitor at the grey negations of his window.  She wound up with\r\nsaying: "You see I bring you a definite proposal."\r\n\r\n"A definite proposal?"\r\n\r\n"To make our relations regular, as it were--to put them on a comfortable\r\nfooting."\r\n\r\n"I see--it\'s a system," said Pemberton.  "A kind of organised blackmail."\r\n\r\nMrs. Moreen bounded up, which was exactly what he wanted.  "What do you\r\nmean by that?"\r\n\r\n"You practise on one\'s fears--one\'s fears about the child if one should\r\ngo away."\r\n\r\n"And pray what would happen to him in that event?" she demanded, with\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\n"Why he\'d be alone with _you_."\r\n\r\n"And pray with whom _should_ a child be but with those whom he loves\r\nmost?"\r\n\r\n"If you think that, why don\'t you dismiss me?"\r\n\r\n"Do you pretend he loves you more than he loves _us_?" cried Mrs. Moreen.\r\n\r\n"I think he ought to.  I make sacrifices for him.  Though I\'ve heard of\r\nthose _you_ make I don\'t see them."\r\n\r\nMrs. Moreen stared a moment; then with emotion she grasped her inmate\'s\r\nhand.  "_Will_ you make it--the sacrifice?"\r\n\r\nHe burst out laughing.  "I\'ll see.  I\'ll do what I can.  I\'ll stay a\r\nlittle longer.  Your calculation\'s just--I _do_ hate intensely to give\r\nhim up; I\'m fond of him and he thoroughly interests me, in spite of the\r\ninconvenience I suffer.  You know my situation perfectly.  I haven\'t a\r\npenny in the world and, occupied as you see me with Morgan, am unable to\r\nearn money."\r\n\r\nMrs. Moreen tapped her undressed arm with her folded bank-note.  "Can\'t\r\nyou write articles?  Can\'t you translate as _I_ do?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about translating; it\'s wretchedly paid."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to earn what I can," said Mrs. Moreen with prodigious virtue.\r\n\r\n"You ought to tell me who you do it for."  Pemberton paused a moment, and\r\nshe said nothing; so he added: "I\'ve tried to turn off some little\r\nsketches, but the magazines won\'t have them--they\'re declined with\r\nthanks."\r\n\r\n"You see then you\'re not such a phoenix," his visitor pointedly\r\nsmiled--"to pretend to abilities you\'re sacrificing for our sake."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t time to do things properly," he ruefully went on.  Then as it\r\ncame over him that he was almost abjectly good-natured to give these\r\nexplanations he added: "If I stay on longer it must be on one\r\ncondition--that Morgan shall know distinctly on what footing I am."\r\n\r\nMrs. Moreen demurred.  "Surely you don\'t want to show off to a child?"\r\n\r\n"To show _you_ off, do you mean?"\r\n\r\nAgain she cast about, but this time it was to produce a still finer\r\nflower.  "And _you_ talk of blackmail!"\r\n\r\n"You can easily prevent it," said Pemberton.\r\n\r\n"And _you_ talk of practising on fears," she bravely pushed on.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there\'s no doubt I\'m a great scoundrel."\r\n\r\nHis patroness met his eyes--it was clear she was in straits.  Then she\r\nthrust out her money at him.  "Mr. Moreen desired me to give you this on\r\naccount."\r\n\r\n"I\'m much obliged to Mr. Moreen, but we _have_ no account."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t take it?"\r\n\r\n"That leaves me more free," said Pemberton.\r\n\r\n"To poison my darling\'s mind?" groaned Mrs. Moreen.\r\n\r\n"Oh your darling\'s mind--!" the young man laughed.\r\n\r\nShe fixed him a moment, and he thought she was going to break out\r\ntormentedly, pleadingly: "For God\'s sake, tell me what _is_ in it!"  But\r\nshe checked this impulse--another was stronger.  She pocketed the\r\nmoney--the crudity of the alternative was comical--and swept out of the\r\nroom with the desperate concession: "You may tell him any horror you\r\nlike!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nA couple of days after this, during which he had failed to profit by so\r\nfree a permission, he had been for a quarter of an hour walking with his\r\ncharge in silence when the boy became sociable again with the remark:\r\n"I\'ll tell you how I know it; I know it through Zenobie."\r\n\r\n"Zenobie?  Who in the world is _she_?"\r\n\r\n"A nurse I used to have--ever so many years ago.  A charming woman.  I\r\nliked her awfully, and she liked me."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no accounting for tastes.  What is it you know through her?"\r\n\r\n"Why what their idea is.  She went away because they didn\'t fork out.\r\nShe did like me awfully, and she stayed two years.  She told me all about\r\nit--that at last she could never get her wages.  As soon as they saw how\r\nmuch she liked me they stopped giving her anything.  They thought she\'d\r\nstay for nothing--just _because_, don\'t you know?"  And Morgan had a\r\nqueer little conscious lucid look.  "She did stay ever so long--as long\r\nan she could.  She was only a poor girl.  She used to send money to her\r\nmother.  At last she couldn\'t afford it any longer, and went away in a\r\nfearful rage one night--I mean of course in a rage against _them_.  She\r\ncried over me tremendously, she hugged me nearly to death.  She told me\r\nall about it," the boy repeated.  "She told me it was their idea.  So I\r\nguessed, ever so long ago, that they have had the same idea with you."\r\n\r\n"Zenobie was very sharp," said Pemberton.  "And she made you so."\r\n\r\n"Oh that wasn\'t Zenobie; that was nature.  And experience!" Morgan\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n"Well, Zenobie was a part of your experience."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I was a part of hers, poor dear!" the boy wisely sighed.  "And\r\nI\'m part of yours."\r\n\r\n"A very important part.  But I don\'t see how you know that I\'ve been\r\ntreated like Zenobie."\r\n\r\n"Do you take me for the biggest dunce you\'ve known?" Morgan asked.\r\n"Haven\'t I been conscious of what we\'ve been through together?"\r\n\r\n"What we\'ve been through?"\r\n\r\n"Our privations--our dark days."\r\n\r\n"Oh our days have been bright enough."\r\n\r\nMorgan went on in silence for a moment.  Then he said: "My dear chap,\r\nyou\'re a hero!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re another!" Pemberton retorted.\r\n\r\n"No I\'m not, but I ain\'t a baby.  I won\'t stand it any longer.  You must\r\nget some occupation that pays.  I\'m ashamed, I\'m ashamed!" quavered the\r\nboy with a ring of passion, like some high silver note from a small\r\ncathedral cloister, that deeply touched his friend.\r\n\r\n"We ought to go off and live somewhere together," the young man said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go like a shot if you\'ll take me."\r\n\r\n"I\'d get some work that would keep us both afloat," Pemberton continued.\r\n\r\n"So would I.  Why shouldn\'t I work?  I ain\'t such a beastly little muff\r\nas that comes to."\r\n\r\n"The difficulty is that your parents wouldn\'t hear of it.  They\'d never\r\npart with you; they worship the ground you tread on.  Don\'t you see the\r\nproof of it?" Pemberton developed.  "They don\'t dislike me; they wish me\r\nno harm; they\'re very amiable people; but they\'re perfectly ready to\r\nexpose me to any awkwardness in life for your sake."\r\n\r\nThe silence in which Morgan received his fond sophistry struck Pemberton\r\nsomehow as expressive.  After a moment the child repeated: "You are a\r\nhero!"  Then he added: "They leave me with you altogether.  You\'ve all\r\nthe responsibility.  They put me off on you from morning till night.  Why\r\nthen should they object to my taking up with you completely?  I\'d help\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"They\'re not particularly keen about my being helped, and they delight in\r\nthinking of you as _theirs_.  They\'re tremendously proud of you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not proud of _them_.  But you know that," Morgan returned.\r\n\r\n"Except for the little matter we speak of they\'re charming people," said\r\nPemberton, not taking up the point made for his intelligence, but\r\nwondering greatly at the boy\'s own, and especially at this fresh reminder\r\nof something he had been conscious of from the first--the strangest thing\r\nin his friend\'s large little composition, a temper, a sensibility, even a\r\nprivate ideal, which made him as privately disown the stuff his people\r\nwere made of.  Morgan had in secret a small loftiness which made him\r\nacute about betrayed meanness; as well as a critical sense for the\r\nmanners immediately surrounding him that was quite without precedent in a\r\njuvenile nature, especially when one noted that it had not made this\r\nnature "old-fashioned," as the word is of children--quaint or wizened or\r\noffensive.  It was as if he had been a little gentleman and had paid the\r\npenalty by discovering that he was the only such person in his family.\r\nThis comparison didn\'t make him vain, but it could make him melancholy\r\nand a trifle austere.  While Pemberton guessed at these dim young things,\r\nshadows of shadows, he was partly drawn on and partly checked, as for a\r\nscruple, by the charm of attempting to sound the little cool shallows\r\nthat were so quickly growing deeper.  When he tried to figure to himself\r\nthe morning twilight of childhood, so as to deal with it safely, he saw\r\nit was never fixed, never arrested, that ignorance, at the instant he\r\ntouched it, was already flushing faintly into knowledge, that there was\r\nnothing that at a given moment you could say an intelligent child didn\'t\r\nknow.  It seemed to him that he himself knew too much to imagine Morgan\'s\r\nsimplicity and too little to disembroil his tangle.\r\n\r\nThe boy paid no heed to his last remark; he only went on: "I\'d have\r\nspoken to them about their idea, as I call it, long ago, if I hadn\'t been\r\nsure what they\'d say."\r\n\r\n"And what would they say?"\r\n\r\n"Just what they said about what poor Zenobie told me--that it was a\r\nhorrid dreadful story, that they had paid her every penny they owed her."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps they had," said Pemberton.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they\'ve paid you!"\r\n\r\n"Let us pretend they have, and n\'en parlons plus."\r\n\r\n"They accused her of lying and cheating"--Morgan stuck to historic truth.\r\n"That\'s why I don\'t want to speak to them."\r\n\r\n"Lest they should accuse me, too?"  To this Morgan made no answer, and\r\nhis companion, looking down at him--the boy turned away his eyes, which\r\nhad filled--saw what he couldn\'t have trusted himself to utter.  "You\'re\r\nright.  Don\'t worry them," Pemberton pursued.  "Except for that, they\r\n_are_ charming people."\r\n\r\n"Except for _their_ lying and _their_ cheating?"\r\n\r\n"I say--I say!" cried Pemberton, imitating a little tone of the lad\'s\r\nwhich was itself an imitation.\r\n\r\n"We must be frank, at the last; we _must_ come to an understanding," said\r\nMorgan with the importance of the small boy who lets himself think he is\r\narranging great affairs--almost playing at shipwreck or at Indians.  "I\r\nknow all about everything."\r\n\r\n"I dare say your father has his reasons," Pemberton replied, but too\r\nvaguely, as he was aware.\r\n\r\n"For lying and cheating?"\r\n\r\n"For saving and managing and turning his means to the best account.  He\r\nhas plenty to do with his money.  You\'re an expensive family."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m very expensive," Morgan concurred in a manner that made his\r\npreceptor burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"He\'s saving for _you_," said Pemberton.  "They think of you in\r\neverything they do."\r\n\r\n"He might, while he\'s about it, save a little--"  The boy paused, and his\r\nfriend waited to hear what.  Then Morgan brought out oddly: "A little\r\nreputation."\r\n\r\n"Oh there\'s plenty of that.  That\'s all right!"\r\n\r\n"Enough of it for the people they know, no doubt.  The people they know\r\nare awful."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean the princes?  We mustn\'t abuse the princes."\r\n\r\n"Why not?  They haven\'t married Paula--they haven\'t married Amy.  They\r\nonly clean out Ulick."\r\n\r\n"You _do_ know everything!" Pemberton declared.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t, after all.  I don\'t know what they live on, or how they\r\nlive, or _why_ they live!  What have they got and how did they get it?\r\nAre they rich, are they poor, or have they a modeste aisance?  Why are\r\nthey always chiveying me about--living one year like ambassadors and the\r\nnext like paupers?  Who are they, any way, and what are they?  I\'ve\r\nthought of all that--I\'ve thought of a lot of things.  They\'re so beastly\r\nworldly.  That\'s what I hate most--oh, I\'ve _seen_ it!  All they care\r\nabout is to make an appearance and to pass for something or other.  What\r\nthe dickens do they want to pass for?  What _do_ they, Mr. Pemberton?"\r\n\r\n"You pause for a reply," said Pemberton, treating the question as a joke,\r\nyet wondering too and greatly struck with his mate\'s intense if imperfect\r\nvision.  "I haven\'t the least idea."\r\n\r\n"And what good does it do?  Haven\'t I seen the way people treat them--the\r\n\'nice\' people, the ones they want to know?  They\'ll take anything from\r\nthem--they\'ll lie down and be trampled on.  The nice ones hate that--they\r\njust sicken them.  You\'re the only really nice person we know."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure?  They don\'t lie down for me!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you shan\'t lie down for them.  You\'ve got to go--that\'s what\r\nyou\'ve got to do," said Morgan.\r\n\r\n"And what will become of you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh I\'m growing up.  I shall get off before long.  I\'ll see you later."\r\n\r\n"You had better let me finish you," Pemberton urged, lending himself to\r\nthe child\'s strange superiority.\r\n\r\nMorgan stopped in their walk, looking up at him.  He had to look up much\r\nless than a couple of years before--he had grown, in his loose leanness,\r\nso long and high.  "Finish me?" he echoed.\r\n\r\n"There are such a lot of jolly things we can do together yet.  I want to\r\nturn you out--I want you to do me credit."\r\n\r\nMorgan continued to look at him.  "To give you credit--do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, you\'re too clever to live."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I\'m afraid you think.  No, no; it isn\'t fair--I can\'t\r\nendure it.  We\'ll separate next week.  The sooner it\'s over the sooner to\r\nsleep."\r\n\r\n"If I hear of anything--any other chance--I promise to go," Pemberton\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nMorgan consented to consider this.  "But you\'ll be honest," he demanded;\r\n"you won\'t pretend you haven\'t heard?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m much more likely to pretend I have."\r\n\r\n"But what can you hear of, this way, stuck in a hole with us?  You ought\r\nto be on the spot, to go to England--you ought to go to America."\r\n\r\n"One would think you were _my_ tutor!" said Pemberton.\r\n\r\nMorgan walked on and after a little had begun again: "Well, now that you\r\nknow I know and that we look at the facts and keep nothing back--it\'s\r\nmuch more comfortable, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, it\'s so amusing, so interesting, that it will surely be\r\nquite impossible for me to forego such hours as these."\r\n\r\nThis made Morgan stop once more.  "You _do_ keep something back.  Oh\r\nyou\'re not straight--_I_ am!"\r\n\r\n"How am I not straight?"\r\n\r\n"Oh you\'ve got your idea!"\r\n\r\n"My idea?"\r\n\r\n"Why that I probably shan\'t make old--make older--bones, and that you can\r\nstick it out till I\'m removed."\r\n\r\n"You _are_ too clever to live!" Pemberton repeated.\r\n\r\n"I call it a mean idea," Morgan pursued.  "But I shall punish you by the\r\nway I hang on."\r\n\r\n"Look out or I\'ll poison you!" Pemberton laughed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m stronger and better every year.  Haven\'t you noticed that there\r\nhasn\'t been a doctor near me since you came?"\r\n\r\n"_I\'m_ your doctor," said the young man, taking his arm and drawing him\r\ntenderly on again.\r\n\r\nMorgan proceeded and after a few steps gave a sigh of mingled weariness\r\nand relief.  "Ah now that we look at the facts it\'s all right!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThey looked at the facts a good deal after this and one of the first\r\nconsequences of their doing so was that Pemberton stuck it out, in his\r\nfriend\'s parlance, for the purpose.  Morgan made the facts so vivid and\r\nso droll, and at the same time so bald and so ugly, that there was\r\nfascination in talking them over with him, just as there would have been\r\nheartlessness in leaving him alone with them.  Now that the pair had such\r\nperceptions in common it was useless for them to pretend they didn\'t\r\njudge such people; but the very judgement and the exchange of perceptions\r\ncreated another tie.  Morgan had never been so interesting as now that he\r\nhimself was made plainer by the sidelight of these confidences.  What\r\ncame out in it most was the small fine passion of his pride.  He had\r\nplenty of that, Pemberton felt--so much that one might perhaps wisely\r\nwish for it some early bruises.  He would have liked his people to have a\r\nspirit and had waked up to the sense of their perpetually eating\r\nhumble-pie.  His mother would consume any amount, and his father would\r\nconsume even more than his mother.  He had a theory that Ulick had\r\nwriggled out of an "affair" at Nice: there had once been a flurry at\r\nhome, a regular panic, after which they all went to bed and took\r\nmedicine, not to be accounted for on any other supposition.  Morgan had a\r\nromantic imagination, led by poetry and history, and he would have liked\r\nthose who "bore his name"--as he used to say to Pemberton with the humour\r\nthat made his queer delicacies manly--to carry themselves with an air.\r\nBut their one idea was to get in with people who didn\'t want them and to\r\ntake snubs as it they were honourable scars.  Why people didn\'t want them\r\nmore he didn\'t know--that was people\'s own affair; after all they weren\'t\r\nsuperficially repulsive, they were a hundred times cleverer than most of\r\nthe dreary grandees, the "poor swells" they rushed about Europe to catch\r\nup with.  "After all they _are_ amusing--they are!" he used to pronounce\r\nwith the wisdom of the ages.  To which Pemberton always replied:\r\n"Amusing--the great Moreen troupe?  Why they\'re altogether delightful;\r\nand if it weren\'t for the hitch that you and I (feeble performers!) make\r\nin the ensemble they\'d carry everything before them."\r\n\r\nWhat the boy couldn\'t get over was the fact that this particular blight\r\nseemed, in a tradition of self-respect, so undeserved and so arbitrary.\r\nNo doubt people had a right to take the line they liked; but why should\r\nhis people have liked the line of pushing and toadying and lying and\r\ncheating?  What had their forefathers--all decent folk, so far as he\r\nknew--done to them, or what had he done to them?  Who had poisoned their\r\nblood with the fifth-rate social ideal, the fixed idea of making smart\r\nacquaintances and getting into the monde chic, especially when it was\r\nforedoomed to failure and exposure?  They showed so what they were after;\r\nthat was what made the people they wanted not want _them_.  And never a\r\nwince for dignity, never a throb of shame at looking each other in the\r\nface, never any independence or resentment or disgust.  If his father or\r\nhis brother would only knock some one down once or twice a year!  Clever\r\nas they were they never guessed the impression they made.  They were\r\ngood-natured, yes--as good-natured as Jews at the doors of\r\nclothing-shops!  But was that the model one wanted one\'s family to\r\nfollow?  Morgan had dim memories of an old grandfather, the maternal, in\r\nNew York, whom he had been taken across the ocean at the age of five to\r\nsee: a gentleman with a high neck-cloth and a good deal of pronunciation,\r\nwho wore a dress-coat in the morning, which made one wonder what he wore\r\nin the evening, and had, or was supposed to have "property" and something\r\nto do with the Bible Society.  It couldn\'t have been but that he was a\r\ngood type.  Pemberton himself remembered Mrs. Clancy, a widowed sister of\r\nMr. Moreen\'s, who was as irritating as a moral tale and had paid a\r\nfortnight\'s visit to the family at Nice shortly after he came to live\r\nwith them.  She was "pure and refined," as Amy said over the banjo, and\r\nhad the air of not knowing what they meant when they talked, and of\r\nkeeping something rather important back.  Pemberton judged that what she\r\nkept back was an approval of many of their ways; therefore it was to be\r\nsupposed that she too was of a good type, and that Mr. and Mrs. Moreen\r\nand Ulick and Paula and Amy might easily have been of a better one if\r\nthey would.\r\n\r\nBut that they wouldn\'t was more and more perceptible from day to day.\r\nThey continued to "chivey," as Morgan called it, and in due time became\r\naware of a variety of reasons for proceeding to Venice.  They mentioned a\r\ngreat many of them--they were always strikingly frank and had the\r\nbrightest friendly chatter, at the late foreign breakfast in especial,\r\nbefore the ladies had made up their faces, when they leaned their arms on\r\nthe table, had something to follow the demitasse, and, in the heat of\r\nfamiliar discussion as to what they "really ought" to do, fell inevitably\r\ninto the languages in which they could tutoyer.  Even Pemberton liked\r\nthem then; he could endure even Ulick when he heard him give his little\r\nflat voice for the "sweet sea-city."  That was what made him have a\r\nsneaking kindness for them--that they were so out of the workaday world\r\nand kept him so out of it.  The summer had waned when, with cries of\r\necstasy, they all passed out on the balcony that overhung the Grand\r\nCanal.  The sunsets then were splendid and the Dorringtons had arrived.\r\nThe Dorringtons were the only reason they hadn\'t talked of at breakfast;\r\nbut the reasons they didn\'t talk of at breakfast always came out in the\r\nend.  The Dorringtons on the other hand came out very little; or else\r\nwhen they did they stayed--as was natural--for hours, during which\r\nperiods Mrs. Moreen and the girls sometimes called at their hotel (to see\r\nif they had returned) as many as three times running.  The gondola was\r\nfor the ladies, as in Venice too there were "days," which Mrs. Moreen\r\nknew in their order an hour after she arrived.  She immediately took one\r\nherself, to which the Dorringtons never came, though on a certain\r\noccasion when Pemberton and his pupil were together at St. Mark\'s--where,\r\ntaking the best walks they had ever had and haunting a hundred churches,\r\nthey spent a great deal of time--they saw the old lord turn up with Mr.\r\nMoreen and Ulick, who showed him the dim basilica as if it belonged to\r\nthem.  Pemberton noted how much less, among its curiosities, Lord\r\nDorrington carried himself as a man of the world; wondering too whether,\r\nfor such services, his companions took a fee from him.  The autumn at any\r\nrate waned, the Dorringtons departed, and Lord Verschoyle, the eldest\r\nson, had proposed neither for Amy nor for Paula.\r\n\r\nOne sad November day, while the wind roared round the old palace and the\r\nrain lashed the lagoon, Pemberton, for exercise and even somewhat for\r\nwarmth--the Moreens were horribly frugal about fires; it was a cause of\r\nsuffering to their inmate--walked up and down the big bare sala with his\r\npupil.  The scagliola floor was cold, the high battered casements shook\r\nin the storm, and the stately decay of the place was unrelieved by a\r\nparticle of furniture.  Pemberton\'s spirits were low, and it came over\r\nhim that the fortune of the Moreens was now even lower.  A blast of\r\ndesolation, a portent of disgrace and disaster, seemed to draw through\r\nthe comfortless hall.  Mr. Moreen and Ulick were in the Piazza, looking\r\nout for something, strolling drearily, in mackintoshes, under the\r\narcades; but still, in spite of mackintoshes, unmistakeable men of the\r\nworld.  Paula and Amy were in bed--it might have been thought they were\r\nstaying there to keep warm.  Pemberton looked askance at the boy at his\r\nside, to see to what extent he was conscious of these dark omens.  But\r\nMorgan, luckily for him, was now mainly conscious of growing taller and\r\nstronger and indeed of being in his fifteenth year.  This fact was\r\nintensely interesting to him and the basis of a private theory--which,\r\nhowever, he had imparted to his tutor--that in a little while he should\r\nstand on his own feet.  He considered that the situation would\r\nchange--that in short he should be "finished," grown up, producible in\r\nthe world of affairs and ready to prove himself of sterling ability.\r\nSharply as he was capable at times of analysing, as he called it, his\r\nlife, there were happy hours when he remained, as he also called it--and\r\nas the name, really, of their right ideal--"jolly" superficial; the proof\r\nof which was his fundamental assumption that he should presently go to\r\nOxford, to Pemberton\'s college, and, aided and abetted by Pemberton, do\r\nthe most wonderful things.  It depressed the young man to see how little\r\nin such a project he took account of ways and means: in other connexions\r\nhe mostly kept to the measure.  Pemberton tried to imagine the Moreens at\r\nOxford and fortunately failed; yet unless they were to adopt it as a\r\nresidence there would be no modus vivendi for Morgan.  How could he live\r\nwithout an allowance, and where was the allowance to come from?  He,\r\nPemberton, might live on Morgan; but how could Morgan live on _him_?\r\nWhat was to become of him anyhow?  Somehow the fact that he was a big boy\r\nnow, with better prospects of health, made the question of his future\r\nmore difficult.  So long as he was markedly frail the great consideration\r\nhe inspired seemed enough of an answer to it.  But at the bottom of\r\nPemberton\'s heart was the recognition of his probably being strong enough\r\nto live and not yet strong enough to struggle or to thrive.  Morgan\r\nhimself at any rate was in the first flush of the rosiest consciousness\r\nof adolescence, so that the beating of the tempest seemed to him after\r\nall but the voice of life and the challenge of fate.  He had on his\r\nshabby little overcoat, with the collar up, but was enjoying his walk.\r\n\r\nIt was interrupted at last by the appearance of his mother at the end of\r\nthe sala.  She beckoned him to come to her, and while Pemberton saw him,\r\ncomplaisant, pass down the long vista and over the damp false marble, he\r\nwondered what was in the air.  Mrs. Moreen said a word to the boy and\r\nmade him go into the room she had quitted.  Then, having closed the door\r\nafter him, she directed her steps swiftly to Pemberton.  There was\r\nsomething in the air, but his wildest flight of fancy wouldn\'t have\r\nsuggested what it proved to be.  She signified that she had made a\r\npretext to get Morgan out of the way, and then she enquired--without\r\nhesitation--if the young man could favour her with the loan of three\r\nlouis.  While, before bursting into a laugh, he stared at her with\r\nsurprise, she declared that she was awfully pressed for the money; she\r\nwas desperate for it--it would save her life.\r\n\r\n"Dear lady, c\'est trop fort!"  Pemberton laughed in the manner and with\r\nthe borrowed grace of idiom that marked the best colloquial, the best\r\nanecdotic, moments of his friends themselves.  "Where in the world do you\r\nsuppose I should get three louis, du train dont vous allez?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you worked--wrote things.  Don\'t they pay you?"\r\n\r\n"Not a penny."\r\n\r\n"Are you such a fool as to work for nothing?"\r\n\r\n"You ought surely to know that."\r\n\r\nMrs. Moreen stared, then she coloured a little.  Pemberton saw she had\r\nquite forgotten the terms--if "terms" they could be called--that he had\r\nended by accepting from herself; they had burdened her memory as little\r\nas her conscience.  "Oh yes, I see what you mean--you\'ve been very nice\r\nabout that; but why drag it in so often?"  She had been perfectly urbane\r\nwith him ever since the rough scene of explanation in his room the\r\nmorning he made her accept _his_ "terms"--the necessity of his making his\r\ncase known to Morgan.  She had felt no resentment after seeing there was\r\nno danger Morgan would take the matter up with her.  Indeed, attributing\r\nthis immunity to the good taste of his influence with the boy, she had\r\nonce said to Pemberton "My dear fellow, it\'s an immense comfort you\'re a\r\ngentleman."  She repeated this in substance now.  "Of course you\'re a\r\ngentleman--that\'s a bother the less!"  Pemberton reminded her that he had\r\nnot "dragged in" anything that wasn\'t already in as much as his foot was\r\nin his shoe; and she also repeated her prayer that, somewhere and\r\nsomehow, he would find her sixty francs.  He took the liberty of hinting\r\nthat if he could find them it wouldn\'t be to lend them to _her_--as to\r\nwhich he consciously did himself injustice, knowing that if he had them\r\nhe would certainly put them at her disposal.  He accused himself, at\r\nbottom and not unveraciously, of a fantastic, a demoralised sympathy with\r\nher.  If misery made strange bedfellows it also made strange sympathies.\r\nIt was moreover a part of the abasement of living with such people that\r\none had to make vulgar retorts, quite out of one\'s own tradition of good\r\nmanners.  "Morgan, Morgan, to what pass have I come for you?" he groaned\r\nwhile Mrs. Moreen floated voluminously down the sala again to liberate\r\nthe boy, wailing as she went that everything was too odious.\r\n\r\nBefore their young friend was liberated there came a thump at the door\r\ncommunicating with the staircase, followed by the apparition of a\r\ndripping youth who poked in his head.  Pemberton recognised him as the\r\nbearer of a telegram and recognised the telegram as addressed to himself.\r\nMorgan came back as, after glancing at the signature--that of a relative\r\nin London--he was reading the words: "Found a jolly job for you,\r\nengagement to coach opulent youth on own terms.  Come at once."  The\r\nanswer happily was paid and the messenger waited.  Morgan, who had drawn\r\nnear, waited too and looked hard at Pemberton; and Pemberton, after a\r\nmoment, having met his look, handed him the telegram.  It was really by\r\nwise looks--they knew each other so well now--that, while the\r\ntelegraph-boy, in his waterproof cape, made a great puddle on the floor,\r\nthe thing was settled between them.  Pemberton wrote the answer with a\r\npencil against the frescoed wall, and the messenger departed.  When he\r\nhad gone the young man explained himself.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make a tremendous charge; I\'ll earn a lot of money in a short time,\r\nand we\'ll live on it."\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope the opulent youth will be a dismal dunce--he probably\r\nwill--" Morgan parenthesised--"and keep you a long time a-hammering of it\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"Of course the longer he keeps me the more we shall have for our old\r\nage."\r\n\r\n"But suppose _they_ don\'t pay you!" Morgan awfully suggested.\r\n\r\n"Oh there are not two such--!"  But Pemberton pulled up; he had been on\r\nthe point of using too invidious a term.  Instead of this he said "Two\r\nsuch fatalities."\r\n\r\nMorgan flushed--the tears came to his eyes.  "Dites toujours two such\r\nrascally crews!"  Then in a different tone he added: "Happy opulent\r\nyouth!"\r\n\r\n"Not if he\'s a dismal dunce."\r\n\r\n"Oh they\'re happier then.  But you can\'t have everything, can you?" the\r\nboy smiled.\r\n\r\nPemberton held him fast, hands on his shoulders--he had never loved him\r\nso.  "What will become of you, what will you do?"  He thought of Mrs.\r\nMoreen, desperate for sixty francs.\r\n\r\n"I shall become an homme fait."  And then as if he recognised all the\r\nbearings of Pemberton\'s allusion: "I shall get on with them better when\r\nyou\'re not here."\r\n\r\n"Ah don\'t say that--it sounds as if I set you against them!"\r\n\r\n"You do--the sight of you.  It\'s all right; you know what I mean.  I\r\nshall be beautiful.  I\'ll take their affairs in hand; I\'ll marry my\r\nsisters."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll marry yourself!" joked Pemberton; as high, rather tense\r\npleasantry would evidently be the right, or the safest, tone for their\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not purely in this strain that Morgan suddenly asked:\r\n"But I say--how will you get to your jolly job?  You\'ll have to telegraph\r\nto the opulent youth for money to come on."\r\n\r\nPemberton bethought himself.  "They won\'t like that, will they?"\r\n\r\n"Oh look out for them!"\r\n\r\nThen Pemberton brought out his remedy.  "I\'ll go to the American Consul;\r\nI\'ll borrow some money of him--just for the few days, on the strength of\r\nthe telegram."\r\n\r\nMorgan was hilarious.  "Show him the telegram--then collar the money and\r\nstay!"\r\n\r\nPemberton entered into the joke sufficiently to reply that for Morgan he\r\nwas really capable of that; but the boy, growing more serious, and to\r\nprove he hadn\'t meant what he said, not only hurried him off to the\r\nConsulate--since he was to start that evening, as he had wired to his\r\nfriend--but made sure of their affair by going with him.  They splashed\r\nthrough the tortuous perforations and over the humpbacked bridges, and\r\nthey passed through the Piazza, where they saw Mr. Moreen and Ulick go\r\ninto a jeweller\'s shop.  The Consul proved accommodating--Pemberton said\r\nit wasn\'t the letter, but Morgan\'s grand air--and on their way back they\r\nwent into Saint Mark\'s for a hushed ten minutes.  Later they took up and\r\nkept up the fun of it to the very end; and it seemed to Pemberton a part\r\nof that fun that Mrs. Moreen, who was very angry when he had announced\r\nher his intention, should charge him, grotesquely and vulgarly and in\r\nreference to the loan she had vainly endeavoured to effect, with bolting\r\nlest they should "get something out" of him.  On the other hand he had to\r\ndo Mr. Moreen and Ulick the justice to recognise that when on coming in\r\nthey heard the cruel news they took it like perfect men of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he got at work with the opulent youth, who was to be taken in hand\r\nfor Balliol, he found himself unable to say if this aspirant had really\r\nsuch poor parts or if the appearance were only begotten of his own long\r\nassociation with an intensely living little mind.  From Morgan he heard\r\nhalf a dozen times: the boy wrote charming young letters, a patchwork of\r\ntongues, with indulgent postscripts in the family Volapuk and, in little\r\nsquares and rounds and crannies of the text, the drollest\r\nillustrations--letters that he was divided between the impulse to show\r\nhis present charge as a vain, a wasted incentive, and the sense of\r\nsomething in them that publicity would profane.  The opulent youth went\r\nup in due course and failed to pass; but it seemed to add to the\r\npresumption that brilliancy was not expected of him all at once that his\r\nparents, condoning the lapse, which they good-naturedly treated as little\r\nas possible as if it were Pemberton\'s, should have sounded the rally\r\nagain, begged the young coach to renew the siege.\r\n\r\nThe young coach was now in a position to lend Mrs. Moreen three louis,\r\nand he sent her a post-office order even for a larger amount.  In return\r\nfor this favour he received a frantic scribbled line from her: "Implore\r\nyou to come back instantly--Morgan dreadfully ill."  They were on there\r\nrebound, once more in Paris--often as Pemberton had seen them depressed\r\nhe had never seen them crushed--and communication was therefore rapid.\r\nHe wrote to the boy to ascertain the state of his health, but awaited the\r\nanswer in vain.  He accordingly, after three days, took an abrupt leave\r\nof the opulent youth and, crossing the Channel, alighted at the small\r\nhotel, in the quarter of the Champs Elysees, of which Mrs. Moreen had\r\ngiven him the address.  A deep if dumb dissatisfaction with this lady and\r\nher companions bore him company: they couldn\'t be vulgarly honest, but\r\nthey could live at hotels, in velvety entresols, amid a smell of burnt\r\npastilles, surrounded by the most expensive city in Europe.  When he had\r\nleft them in Venice it was with an irrepressible suspicion that something\r\nwas going to happen; but the only thing that could have taken place was\r\nagain their masterly retreat.  "How is he? where is he?" he asked of Mrs.\r\nMoreen; but before she could speak these questions were answered by the\r\npressure round hid neck of a pair of arms, in shrunken sleeves, which\r\nstill were perfectly capable of an effusive young foreign squeeze.\r\n\r\n"Dreadfully ill--I don\'t see it!" the young man cried.  And then to\r\nMorgan: "Why on earth didn\'t you relieve me?  Why didn\'t you answer my\r\nletter?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Moreen declared that when she wrote he was very bad, and Pemberton\r\nlearned at the same time from the boy that he had answered every letter\r\nhe had received.  This led to the clear inference that Pemberton\'s note\r\nhad been kept from him so that the game practised should not be\r\ninterfered with.  Mrs. Moreen was prepared to see the fact exposed, as\r\nPemberton saw the moment he faced her that she was prepared for a good\r\nmany other things.  She was prepared above all to maintain that she had\r\nacted from a sense of duty, that she was enchanted she had got him over,\r\nwhatever they might say, and that it was useless of him to pretend he\r\ndidn\'t know in all his bones that his place at such a time was with\r\nMorgan.  He had taken the boy away from them and now had no right to\r\nabandon him.  He had created for himself the gravest responsibilities and\r\nmust at least abide by what he had done.\r\n\r\n"Taken him away from you?" Pemberton exclaimed indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Do it--do it for pity\'s sake; that\'s just what I want.  I can\'t stand\r\n_this_--and such scenes.  They\'re awful frauds--poor dears!"  These words\r\nbroke from Morgan, who had intermitted his embrace, in a key which made\r\nPemberton turn quickly to him and see that he had suddenly seated\r\nhimself, was breathing in great pain, and was very pale.\r\n\r\n"_Now_ do you say he\'s not in a state, my precious pet?" shouted his\r\nmother, dropping on her knees before him with clasped hands, but touching\r\nhim no more than if he had been a gilded idol.  "It will pass--it\'s only\r\nfor an instant; but don\'t say such dreadful things!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m all right--all right," Morgan panted to Pemberton, whom he sat\r\nlooking up at with a strange smile, his hands resting on either side of\r\nthe sofa.\r\n\r\n"Now do you pretend I\'ve been dishonest, that I\'ve deceived?" Mrs. Moreen\r\nflashed at Pemberton as she got up.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t _he_ says it, it\'s I!" the boy returned, apparently easier, but\r\nsinking back against the wall; while his restored friend, who had sat\r\ndown beside him, took his hand and bent over him.\r\n\r\n"Darling child, one does what one can; there are so many things to\r\nconsider," urged Mrs. Moreen.  "It\'s his _place_--his only place.  You\r\nsee _you_ think it is now."\r\n\r\n"Take me away--take me away," Morgan went on, smiling to Pemberton with\r\nhis white face.\r\n\r\n"Where shall I take you, and how--oh _how_, my boy?" the young man\r\nstammered, thinking of the rude way in which his friends in London held\r\nthat, for his convenience, with no assurance of prompt return, he had\r\nthrown them over; of the just resentment with which they would already\r\nhave called in a successor, and of the scant help to finding fresh\r\nemployment that resided for him in the grossness of his having failed to\r\npass his pupil.\r\n\r\n"Oh we\'ll settle that.  You used to talk about it," said Morgan.  "If we\r\ncan only go all the rest\'s a detail."\r\n\r\n"Talk about it as much as you like, but don\'t think you can attempt it.\r\nMr. Moreen would never consent--it would be so _very_ hand-to-mouth,"\r\nPemberton\'s hostess beautifully explained to him.  Then to Morgan she\r\nmade it clearer: "It would destroy our peace, it would break our hearts.\r\nNow that he\'s back it will be all the same again.  You\'ll have your life,\r\nyour work and your freedom, and we\'ll all be happy as we used to be.\r\nYou\'ll bloom and grow perfectly well, and we won\'t have any more silly\r\nexperiments, will we?  They\'re too absurd.  It\'s Mr. Pemberton\'s\r\nplace--every one in his place.  You in yours, your papa in his, me in\r\nmine--n\'est-ce pas, cheri?  We\'ll all forget how foolish we\'ve been and\r\nhave lovely times."\r\n\r\nShe continued to talk and to surge vaguely about the little draped stuffy\r\nsalon while Pemberton sat with the boy, whose colour gradually came back;\r\nand she mixed up her reasons, hinting that there were going to be\r\nchanges, that the other children might scatter (who knew?--Paula had her\r\nideas) and that then it might be fancied how much the poor old\r\nparent-birds would want the little nestling.  Morgan looked at Pemberton,\r\nwho wouldn\'t let him move; and Pemberton knew exactly how he felt at\r\nhearing himself called a little nestling.  He admitted that he had had\r\none or two bad days, but he protested afresh against the wrong of his\r\nmother\'s having made them the ground of an appeal to poor Pemberton.\r\nPoor Pemberton could laugh now, apart from the comicality of Mrs.\r\nMoreen\'s mustering so much philosophy for her defence--she seemed to\r\nshake it out of her agitated petticoats, which knocked over the light\r\ngilt chairs--so little did their young companion, _marked_, unmistakeably\r\nmarked at the best, strike him as qualified to repudiate any advantage.\r\n\r\nHe himself was in for it at any rate.  He should have Morgan on his hands\r\nagain indefinitely; though indeed he saw the lad had a private theory to\r\nproduce which would be intended to smooth this down.  He was obliged to\r\nhim for it in advance; but the suggested amendment didn\'t keep his heart\r\nrather from sinking, any more than it prevented him from accepting the\r\nprospect on the spot, with some confidence moreover that he should do so\r\neven better if he could have a little supper.  Mrs. Moreen threw out more\r\nhints about the changes that were to be looked for, but she was such a\r\nmixture of smiles and shudders--she confessed she was very nervous--that\r\nhe couldn\'t tell if she were in high feather or only in hysterics.  If\r\nthe family was really at last going to pieces why shouldn\'t she recognise\r\nthe necessity of pitching Morgan into some sort of lifeboat?  This\r\npresumption was fostered by the fact that they were established in\r\nluxurious quarters in the capital of pleasure; that was exactly where\r\nthey naturally _would_ be established in view of going to pieces.\r\nMoreover didn\'t she mention that Mr. Moreen and the others were enjoying\r\nthemselves at the opera with Mr. Granger, and wasn\'t _that_ also\r\nprecisely where one would look for them on the eve of a smash?  Pemberton\r\ngathered that Mr. Granger was a rich vacant American--a big bill with a\r\nflourishy heading and no items; so that one of Paula\'s "ideas" was\r\nprobably that this time she hadn\'t missed fire--by which straight shot\r\nindeed she would have shattered the general cohesion.  And if the\r\ncohesion was to crumble what would become of poor Pemberton?  He felt\r\nquite enough bound up with them to figure to his alarm as a dislodged\r\nblock in the edifice.\r\n\r\nIt was Morgan who eventually asked if no supper had been ordered for him;\r\nsitting with him below, later, at the dim delayed meal, in the presence\r\nof a great deal of corded green plush, a plate of ornamental biscuit and\r\nan aloofness marked on the part of the waiter.  Mrs. Moreen had explained\r\nthat they had been obliged to secure a room for the visitor out of the\r\nhouse; and Morgan\'s consolation--he offered it while Pemberton reflected\r\non the nastiness of lukewarm sauces--proved to be, largely, that his\r\ncircumstance would facilitate their escape.  He talked of their\r\nescape--recurring to it often afterwards--as if they were making up a\r\n"boy\'s book" together.  But he likewise expressed his sense that there\r\nwas something in the air, that the Moreens couldn\'t keep it up much\r\nlonger.  In point of fact, as Pemberton was to see, they kept it up for\r\nfive or six months.  All the while, however, Morgan\'s contention was\r\ndesigned to cheer him.  Mr. Moreen and Ulick, whom he had met the day\r\nafter his return, accepted that return like perfect men of the world.  If\r\nPaula and Amy treated it even with less formality an allowance was to be\r\nmade for them, inasmuch as Mr. Granger hadn\'t come to the opera after\r\nall.  He had only placed his box at their service, with a bouquet for\r\neach of the party; there was even one apiece, embittering the thought of\r\nhis profusion, for Mr. Moreen and Ulick.  "They\'re all like that," was\r\nMorgan\'s comment; "at the very last, just when we think we\'ve landed them\r\nthey\'re back in the deep sea!"\r\n\r\nMorgan\'s comments in these days were more and more free; they even\r\nincluded a large recognition of the extraordinary tenderness with which\r\nhe had been treated while Pemberton was away.  Oh yes, they couldn\'t do\r\nenough to be nice to him, to show him they had him on their mind and make\r\nup for his loss.  That was just what made the whole thing so sad and\r\ncaused him to rejoice after all in Pemberton\'s return--he had to keep\r\nthinking of their affection less, had less sense of obligation.\r\nPemberton laughed out at this last reason, and Morgan blushed and said:\r\n"Well, dash it, you know what I mean."  Pemberton knew perfectly what he\r\nmeant; but there were a good many things that--dash it too!--it didn\'t\r\nmake any clearer.  This episode of his second sojourn in Paris stretched\r\nitself out wearily, with their resumed readings and wanderings and\r\nmaunderings, their potterings on the quays, their hauntings of the\r\nmuseums, their occasional lingerings in the Palais Royal when the first\r\nsharp weather came on and there was a comfort in warm emanations, before\r\nChevet\'s wonderful succulent window.  Morgan wanted to hear all about the\r\nopulent youth--he took an immense interest in him.  Some of the details\r\nof his opulence--Pemberton could spare him none of them--evidently fed\r\nthe boy\'s appreciation of all his friend had given up to come back to\r\nhim; but in addition to the greater reciprocity established by that\r\nheroism he had always his little brooding theory, in which there was a\r\nfrivolous gaiety too, that their long probation was drawing to a close.\r\nMorgan\'s conviction that the Moreens couldn\'t go on much longer kept pace\r\nwith the unexpended impetus with which, from month to month, they did go\r\non.  Three weeks after Pemberton had rejoined them they went on to\r\nanother hotel, a dingier one than the first; but Morgan rejoiced that his\r\ntutor had at least still not sacrificed the advantage of a room outside.\r\nHe clung to the romantic utility of this when the day, or rather the\r\nnight, should arrive for their escape.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, in this complicated connexion, our friend felt his\r\ncollar gall him.  It was, as he had said to Mrs. Moreen in Venice, trop\r\nfort--everything was trop fort.  He could neither really throw off his\r\nblighting burden nor find in it the benefit of a pacified conscience or\r\nof a rewarded affection.  He had spent all the money accruing to him in\r\nEngland, and he saw his youth going and that he was getting nothing back\r\nfor it.  It was all very well of Morgan to count it for reparation that\r\nhe should now settle on him permanently--there was an irritating flaw in\r\nsuch a view.  He saw what the boy had in his mind; the conception that as\r\nhis friend had had the generosity to come back he must show his gratitude\r\nby giving him his life.  But the poor friend didn\'t desire the gift--what\r\ncould he do with Morgan\'s dreadful little life?  Of course at the same\r\ntime that Pemberton was irritated he remembered the reason, which was\r\nvery honourable to Morgan and which dwelt simply in his making one so\r\nforget that he was no more than a patched urchin.  If one dealt with him\r\non a different basis one\'s misadventures were one\'s own fault.  So\r\nPemberton waited in a queer confusion of yearning and alarm for the\r\ncatastrophe which was held to hang over the house of Moreen, of which he\r\ncertainly at moments felt the symptoms brush his cheek and as to which he\r\nwondered much in what form it would find its liveliest effect.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would take the form of sudden dispersal--a frightened sauve\r\nqui peut, a scuttling into selfish corners.  Certainly they were less\r\nelastic than of yore; they were evidently looking for something they\r\ndidn\'t find.  The Dorringtons hadn\'t re-appeared, the princes had\r\nscattered; wasn\'t that the beginning of the end?  Mrs. Moreen had lost\r\nher reckoning of the famous "days"; her social calendar was blurred--it\r\nhad turned its face to the wall.  Pemberton suspected that the great, the\r\ncruel discomfiture had been the unspeakable behaviour of Mr. Granger, who\r\nseemed not to know what he wanted, or, what was much worse, what they\r\nwanted.  He kept sending flowers, as if to bestrew the path of his\r\nretreat, which was never the path of a return.  Flowers were all very\r\nwell, but--Pemberton could complete the proposition.  It was now\r\npositively conspicuous that in the long run the Moreens were a social\r\nfailure; so that the young man was almost grateful the run had not been\r\nshort.  Mr. Moreen indeed was still occasionally able to get away on\r\nbusiness and, what was more surprising, was likewise able to get back.\r\nUlick had no club but you couldn\'t have discovered it from his\r\nappearance, which was as much as ever that of a person looking at life\r\nfrom the window of such an institution; therefore Pemberton was doubly\r\nsurprised at an answer he once heard him make his mother in the desperate\r\ntone of a man familiar with the worst privations.  Her question Pemberton\r\nhad not quite caught; it appeared to be an appeal for a suggestion as to\r\nwhom they might get to take Amy.  "Let the Devil take her!" Ulick\r\nsnapped; so that Pemberton could see that they had not only lost their\r\namiability but had ceased to believe in themselves.  He could also see\r\nthat if Mrs. Moreen was trying to get people to take her children she\r\nmight be regarded as closing the hatches for the storm.  But Morgan would\r\nbe the last she would part with.\r\n\r\nOne winter afternoon--it was a Sunday--he and the boy walked far together\r\nin the Bois de Boulogne.  The evening was so splendid, the cold\r\nlemon-coloured sunset so clear, the stream of carriages and pedestrians\r\nso amusing and the fascination of Paris so great, that they stayed out\r\nlater than usual and became aware that they should have to hurry home to\r\narrive in time for dinner.  They hurried accordingly, arm-in-arm,\r\ngood-humoured and hungry, agreeing that there was nothing like Paris\r\nafter all and that after everything too that had come and gone they were\r\nnot yet sated with innocent pleasures.  When they reached the hotel they\r\nfound that, though scandalously late, they were in time for all the\r\ndinner they were likely to sit down to.  Confusion reigned in the\r\napartments of the Moreens--very shabby ones this time, but the best in\r\nthe house--and before the interrupted service of the table, with objects\r\ndisplaced almost as if there had been a scuffle and a great wine-stain\r\nfrom an overturned bottle, Pemberton couldn\'t blink the fact that there\r\nhad been a scene of the last proprietary firmness.  The storm had\r\ncome--they were all seeking refuge.  The hatches were down, Paula and Amy\r\nwere invisible--they had never tried the most casual art upon Pemberton,\r\nbut he felt they had enough of an eye to him not to wish to meet him as\r\nyoung ladies whose frocks had been confiscated--and Ulick appeared to\r\nhave jumped overboard.  The host and his staff, in a word, had ceased to\r\n"go on" at the pace of their guests, and the air of embarrassed\r\ndetention, thanks to a pile of gaping trunks in the passage, was\r\nstrangely commingled with the air of indignant withdrawal.  When Morgan\r\ntook all this in--and he took it in very quickly--he coloured to the\r\nroots of his hair.  He had walked from his infancy among difficulties and\r\ndangers, but he had never seen a public exposure.  Pemberton noticed in a\r\nsecond glance at him that the tears had rushed into his eyes and that\r\nthey were tears of a new and untasted bitterness.  He wondered an\r\ninstant, for the boy\'s sake, whether he might successfully pretend not to\r\nunderstand.  Not successfully, he felt, as Mr. and Mrs. Moreen,\r\ndinnerless by their extinguished hearth, rose before him in their little\r\ndishonoured salon, casting about with glassy eyes for the nearest port in\r\nsuch a storm.  They were not prostrate but were horribly white, and Mrs.\r\nMoreen had evidently been crying.  Pemberton quickly learned however that\r\nher grief was not for the loss of her dinner, much as she usually enjoyed\r\nit, but the fruit of a blow that struck even deeper, as she made all\r\nhaste to explain.  He would see for himself, so far as that went, how the\r\ngreat change had come, the dreadful bolt had fallen, and how they would\r\nnow all have to turn themselves about.  Therefore cruel as it was to them\r\nto part with their darling she must look to him to carry a little further\r\nthe influence he had so fortunately acquired with the boy--to induce his\r\nyoung charge to follow him into some modest retreat.  They depended on\r\nhim--that was the fact--to take their delightful child temporarily under\r\nhis protection; it would leave Mr. Moreen and herself so much more free\r\nto give the proper attention (too little, alas! had been given) to the\r\nreadjustment of their affairs.\r\n\r\n"We trust you--we feel we _can_," said Mrs. Moreen, slowly rubbing her\r\nplump white hands and looking with compunction hard at Morgan, whose\r\nchin, not to take liberties, her husband stroked with a paternal\r\nforefinger.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes--we feel that we _can_.  We trust Mr. Pemberton fully, Morgan,"\r\nMr. Moreen pursued.\r\n\r\nPemberton wondered again if he might pretend not to understand; but\r\neverything good gave way to the intensity of Morgan\'s understanding.  "Do\r\nyou mean he may take me to live with him for ever and ever?" cried the\r\nboy.  "May take me away, away, anywhere he likes?"\r\n\r\n"For ever and ever?  Comme vous-y-allez!" Mr. Moreen laughed indulgently.\r\n"For as long as Mr. Pemberton may be so good."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve struggled, we\'ve suffered," his wife went on; "but you\'ve made him\r\nso your own that we\'ve already been through the worst of the sacrifice."\r\n\r\nMorgan had turned away from his father--he stood looking at Pemberton\r\nwith a light in his face.  His sense of shame for their common humiliated\r\nstate had dropped; the case had another side--the thing was to clutch at\r\n_that_.  He had a moment of boyish joy, scarcely mitigated by the\r\nreflexion that with this unexpected consecration of his hope--too sudden\r\nand too violent; the turn taken was away from a _good_ boy\'s book--the\r\n"escape" was left on their hands.  The boyish joy was there an instant,\r\nand Pemberton was almost scared at the rush of gratitude and affection\r\nthat broke through his first abasement.  When he stammered "My dear\r\nfellow, what do you say to _that_?" how could one not say something\r\nenthusiastic?  But there was more need for courage at something else that\r\nimmediately followed and that made the lad sit down quietly on the\r\nnearest chair.  He had turned quite livid and had raised his hand to his\r\nleft side.  They were all three looking at him, but Mrs. Moreen suddenly\r\nbounded forward.  "Ah his darling little heart!" she broke out; and this\r\ntime, on her knees before him and without respect for the idol, she\r\ncaught him ardently in her arms.  "You walked him too far, you hurried\r\nhim too fast!" she hurled over her shoulder at Pemberton.  Her son made\r\nno protest, and the next instant, still holding him, she sprang up with\r\nher face convulsed and with the terrified cry "Help, help! he\'s going,\r\nhe\'s gone!"  Pemberton saw with equal horror, by Morgan\'s own stricken\r\nface, that he was beyond their wildest recall.  He pulled him half out of\r\nhis mother\'s hands, and for a moment, while they held him together, they\r\nlooked all their dismay into each other\'s eyes, "He couldn\'t stand it\r\nwith his weak organ," said Pemberton--"the shock, the whole scene, the\r\nviolent emotion."\r\n\r\n"But I thought he _wanted_ to go to you!", wailed Mrs. Moreen.\r\n\r\n"I _told_ you he didn\'t, my dear," her husband made answer.  Mr. Moreen\r\nwas trembling all over and was in his way as deeply affected as his wife.\r\nBut after the very first he took his bereavement as a man of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PUPIL***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 1032.txt or 1032.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/3/1032\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
