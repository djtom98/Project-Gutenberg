A sort of tennis-court arranged\r\nand decorated for a theatrical performance.\r\n\r\nThe hall is oblong and seen obliquely, so that one of its sides forms the back\r\nof the right foreground, and meeting the left background makes an angle with\r\nthe stage, which is partly visible.\r\n\r\nOn both sides of the stage are benches.  The curtain is composed of two\r\ntapestries which can be drawn aside.  Above a harlequin\'s mantle are the royal\r\narms.  There are broad steps from the stage to the hall; on either side of\r\nthese steps are the places for the violinists.  Footlights.\r\n\r\nTwo rows, one over the other, of side galleries:  the highest divided into\r\nboxes.  No seats in the pit of the hall, which is the real stage of the\r\ntheater; at the back of the pit, i.e., on the right foreground, some benches\r\nforming steps, and underneath, a staircase which leads to the upper seats.  An\r\nimprovised buffet ornamented with little lusters, vases, glasses, plates of\r\ntarts, cakes, bottles, etc.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the theater is in the center of the background, under the\r\ngallery of the boxes.  A large door, half open to let in the spectators.  On\r\nthe panels of this door, in different corners, and over the buffet, red\r\nplacards bearing the words, \'La Clorise.\'\r\n\r\nAt the rising of the curtain the hall is in semi-darkness, and still empty.\r\nThe lusters are lowered in the middle of the pit ready to be lighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene 1.I.\r\n\r\nThe public, arriving by degrees.  Troopers, burghers, lackeys, pages, a\r\npickpocket, the doorkeeper, etc., followed by the marquises.  Cuigy,\r\nBrissaille, the buffet-girl, the violinists, etc.\r\n\r\n(A confusion of loud voices is heard outside the door.  A trooper enters\r\nhastily.)\r\n\r\nTHE DOORKEEPER (following him):\r\n  Hollo!  You there!  Your money!\r\n\r\nTHE TROOPER:\r\n  I enter gratis.\r\n\r\nTHE DOORKEEPER:\r\n  Why?\r\n\r\nTHE TROOPER:\r\n  Why?

You shall presently see some renowned actors. . .\r\n\r\nTHE PICKPOCKET (making the gestures of one who pulls something stealthily,\r\nwith little jerks):\r\n  Thus for handkerchiefs--\r\n\r\nTHE BURGHER:\r\n  Montfleury. . .\r\n\r\nSOME ONE (shouting from the upper gallery):\r\n  Light up, below there!\r\n\r\nTHE BURGHER:\r\n  . . .Bellerose, L\'Epy, La Beaupre, Jodelet!\r\n\r\nA PAGE (in the pit):\r\n  Here comes the buffet-girl!\r\n\r\nTHE BUFFET-GIRL (taking her place behind the buffet):\r\n  Oranges, milk, raspberry-water, cedar bitters!\r\n\r\n(A hubbub outside the door is heard.)\r\n\r\nA FALSETTO VOICE:\r\n  Make place, brutes!\r\n\r\nA LACKEY (astonished):\r\n  The Marquises!--in the pit?. . .\r\n\r\nANOTHER LACKEY:\r\n  Oh! only for a minute or two!\r\n\r\n(Enter a band of young marquises.)\r\n\r\nA MARQUIS (seeing that the hall is half empty):\r\n  What now!  So we make our entrance like a pack of woolen-drapers!\r\nPeaceably, without disturbing the folk, or treading on their toes!--Oh, fie!\r\nFie!\r\n(Recognizing some other gentlemen who have entered a little before him):\r\n  Cuigy!  Brissaille!\r\n\r\n(Greetings and embraces.)\r\n\r\nCUIGY:\r\n  True to our word!. . .Troth, we are here before the candles are lit.\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS:\r\n  Ay, indeed!  Enough!  I am of an ill humor.\r\n\r\nANOTHER:\r\n  Nay, nay, Marquis! see, for your consolation, they are coming to light up!\r\n\r\nALL THE AUDIENCE (welcoming the entrance of the lighter):\r\n  Ah!. . .\r\n\r\n(They form in groups round the lusters as they are lit.  Some people have\r\ntaken their seats in the galleries.  Ligniere, a distinguished-looking roue,\r\nwith disordered shirt-front arm-in-arm with christian de Neuvillette.\r\nChristian, who is dressed elegantly, but rather behind the fashion, seems\r\npreoccupied, and keeps looking at the boxes.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene 1.II.\r\n\r\nThe same.  Christian, Ligniere, then Ragueneau and Le Bret.\r\n\r\nCUIGY:\r\n  Ligniere!\r\n\r\nBRISSAILLE (laughing):\r\n  Not drunk as yet?\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (aside to Christian):\r\n  I may introduce you?\r\n(Christian nods in assent):\r\n  Baron de Neuvillette.\r\n\r\n(Bows.)\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIENCE (applauding as the first luster is lighted and drawn up):\r\n  Ah!\r\n\r\nCUIGY (to Brissaille, looking at Christian):\r\n  \'Tis a pretty fellow!\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS (who has overheard):\r\n  Pooh!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (introducing them to Christian):\r\n  My lords De Cuigy.  De Brissaille. . .\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN (bowing):\r\n  Delighted!. . .\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS (to second):\r\n  He is not ill to look at, but certes, he is not costumed in the latest mode.\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (to Cuigy):\r\n  This gentleman comes from Touraine.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  Yes, I have scarce been twenty days in Paris; tomorrow I join the Guards, in\r\nthe Cadets.\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS (watching the people who are coming into the boxes):\r\n  There is the wife of the Chief-Justice.\r\n\r\nTHE BUFFET-GIRL:\r\n  Oranges, milk. . .\r\n\r\nTHE VIOLINISTS (tuning up):\r\n  La--la--\r\n\r\nCUIGY (to Christian, pointing to the hall, which is filling fast):\r\n  \'Tis crowded.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  Yes, indeed.\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS:\r\n  All the great world!\r\n\r\n(They recognize and name the different elegantly dressed ladies who enter the\r\nboxes, bowing low to them.  The ladies send smiles in answer.)\r\n\r\nSECOND MARQUIS:\r\n  Madame de Guemenee.\r\n\r\nCUIGY:\r\n  Madame de Bois-Dauphin.\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS:\r\n  Adored by us all!\r\n\r\nBRISSAILLE:\r\n  Madame de Chavigny. . .\r\n\r\nSECOND MARQUIS:\r\n  Who sports with our poor hearts!. . .\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Ha! so Monsieur de Corneille has come back from Rouen!\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN (to his father):\r\n  Is the Academy here?\r\n\r\nTHE BURGHER:\r\n  Oh, ay, I see several of them.  There is Boudu, Boissat,\r\nand Cureau de la Chambre, Porcheres, Colomby, Bourzeys,\r\nBourdon, Arbaud. . .all names that will live!  \'Tis fine!\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS:\r\n  Attention!

Do you know them all, Marquis?\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS:\r\n  Ay, Marquis, I do, every one!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (drawing Christian aside):\r\n  Friend, I but came here to give you pleasure.  The lady comes not.  I will\r\nbetake me again to my pet vice.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN (persuasively):\r\n  No, no!  You, who are ballad-maker to Court and City alike, can tell me\r\nbetter than any who the lady is for whom I die of love.  Stay yet awhile.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST VIOLIN (striking his bow on the desk):\r\n  Gentlemen violinists!\r\n\r\n(He raises his bow.)\r\n\r\nTHE BUFFET-GIRL:\r\n  Macaroons, lemon-drink. . .\r\n\r\n(The violins begin to play.)\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  Ah!  I fear me she is coquettish, and over nice and fastidious!\r\nI, who am so poor of wit, how dare I speak to her--how address her?\r\nThis language that they speak to-day--ay, and write--confounds me;\r\nI am but an honest soldier, and timid withal.  She has ever her place,\r\nthere, on the right--the empty box, see you!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (making as if to go):\r\n  I must go.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN (detaining him):\r\n  Nay, stay.\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  I cannot.  D\'Assoucy waits me at the tavern, and here one dies of thirst.\r\n\r\nTHE BUFFET-GIRL (passing before him with a tray):\r\n  Orange drink?\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Ugh!\r\n\r\nTHE BUFFET-GIRL:\r\n  Milk?\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Pah!\r\n\r\nTHE BUFFET-GIRL:\r\n  Rivesalte?\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Stay.\r\n(To Christian):\r\n  I will remain awhile.--Let me taste this rivesalte.\r\n\r\n(He sits by the buffet; the girl pours some out for him.)\r\n\r\nCRIES (from all the audience, at the entrance of a plump little man, joyously\r\nexcited):\r\n  Ah!  Ragueneau!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (to Christian):\r\n  \'Tis the famous tavern-keeper Ragueneau.\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU (dressed in the Sunday clothes of a pastry-cook, going up quickly to\r\nLigniere):\r\n  Sir, have you seen Monsieur de Cyrano?\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (introducing him to Christian):\r\n  The pastry-cook of the actors and the poets!\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU (overcome):\r\n  You do me too great honor. . .\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Nay, hold your peace, Maecenas that you are!\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  True, these gentlemen employ me. . .\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  On credit!\r\n  He is himself a poet of a pretty talent. . .\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  So they tell me.\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  --Mad after poetry!\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  \'Tis true that, for a little ode. . .\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  You give a tart. . .\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  Oh!--a tartlet!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Brave fellow!  He would fain fain excuse himself!\r\n  --And for a triolet, now, did you not give in exchange. . .\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  Some little rolls!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (severely):\r\n  They were milk-rolls!  And as for the theater, which you love?\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  Oh! to distraction!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  How pay you your tickets, ha?--with cakes.\r\n  Your place, to-night, come tell me in my ear, what did it cost you?\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  Four custards, and fifteen cream-puffs.\r\n(He looks around on all sides):\r\n  Monsieur de Cyrano is not here?  \'Tis strange.\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Why so?\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  Montfleury plays!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Ay, \'tis true that that old wine-barrel is to take Phedon\'s part to-night;\r\nbut what matter is that to Cyrano?\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  How?  Know you not?  He has got a hot hate for Montfleury, and so!--has\r\nforbid him strictly to show his face on the stage for one whole month.\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (drinking his fourth glass):\r\n  Well?\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  Montfleury will play!\r\n\r\nCUIGY:\r\n  He can not hinder that.\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  Oh! oh! that I have come to see!\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS:\r\n  Who is this Cyrano?\r\n\r\nCUIGY:\r\n  A fellow well skilled in all tricks of fence.\r\n\r\nSECOND MARQUIS:\r\n  Is he of noble birth?\r\n\r\nCUIGY:\r\n  Ay, noble enough.  He is a cadet in the Guards.\r\n(Pointing to a gentleman who is going up and down the hall as if searching for\r\nsome one):\r\n  But \'tis his friend Le Bret, yonder, who can best tell you.\r\n(He calls him):\r\n  Le Bret!\r\n(Le Bret comes towards them):\r\n  Seek you for De Bergerac?\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  Ay, I am uneasy. . .\r\n\r\nCUIGY:\r\n  Is it not true that he is the strangest of men?\r\n\r\nLE BRET (tenderly):\r\n  True, that he is the choicest of earthly beings!\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  Poet!\r\n\r\nCUIGY:\r\n  Soldier!\r\n\r\nBRISSAILLE:\r\n  Philosopher!\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  Musician!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  And of how fantastic a presence!\r\n\r\nRAGENEAU:\r\n  Marry, \'twould puzzle even our grim painter Philippe de Champaigne to\r\nportray him!  Methinks, whimsical, wild, comical as he is, only Jacques\r\nCallot, now dead and gone, had succeeded better, and had made of him the\r\nmaddest fighter of all his visored crew--with his triple-plumed beaver and\r\nsix-pointed doublet--the sword-point sticking up \'neath his mantle like an\r\ninsolent cocktail!  He\'s prouder than all the fierce Artabans of whom Gascony\r\nhas ever been and will ever be the prolific Alma Mater!  Above his Toby ruff\r\nhe carries a nose!--ah, good my lords, what a nose is his!  When one sees it\r\none is fain to cry aloud, \'Nay! \'tis too much!  He plays a joke on us!\'  Then\r\none laughs, says \'He will anon take it off.\'  But no!--Monsieur de Bergerac\r\nalways keeps it on.\r\n\r\nLE BRET (throwing back his head):\r\n  He keeps it on--and cleaves in two any man who dares remark on it!\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU (proudly):\r\n  His sword--\'tis one half of the Fates\' shears!\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS (shrugging his shoulders):\r\n  He will not come!\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  I say he will! and I wager a fowl--a la Ragueneau.\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS (laughing):\r\n  Good!\r\n\r\n(Murmurs of admiration in hall.  Roxane has just appeared in her box.  She\r\nseats herself in front, the duenna at the back.  Christian, who is paying the\r\nbuffet-girl, does not see her entrance.)\r\n\r\nSECOND MARQUIS (with little cries of joy):\r\n  Ah, gentlemen! she is fearfully--terribly--ravishing!\r\n\r\nFIRST MARQUIS:\r\n  When one looks at her one thinks of a peach smiling at a strawberry!\r\n\r\nSECOND MARQUIS:\r\n  And what freshness!  A man approaching her too near might chance to get a\r\nbad chill at the heart!\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN (raising his head, sees Roxane, and catches Ligniere by the arm):\r\n  \'Tis she!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Ah! is it she?\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  Ay, tell me quick--I am afraid.\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (tasting his rivesalte in sips):\r\n  Magdaleine Robin--Roxane, so called!  A subtle wit--a precieuse.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  Woe is me!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Free.  An orphan.  The cousin of Cyrano, of whom we were now speaking.\r\n\r\n(At this moment an elegant nobleman, with blue ribbon across his breast,\r\nenters the box, and talks with Roxane, standing.)\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN (starting):\r\n  Who is yonder man?\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE (who is becoming tipsy, winking at him):\r\n  Ha! ha!  Count de Guiche.  Enamored of her.  But wedded to the niece of\r\nArmand de Richelieu.  Would fain marry Roxane to a certain sorry fellow, one\r\nMonsieur de Valvert, a viscount--and--accommodating!  She will none of that\r\nbargain; but De Guiche is powerful, and can persecute the daughter of a plain\r\nuntitled gentleman.  More by token, I myself have exposed this cunning plan of\r\nhis to the world, in a song which. . .Ho! he must rage at me!  The end hit\r\nhome. . .Listen!\r\n\r\n(He gets up staggering, and raises his glass, ready to sing.)\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  No.  Good-night.\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Where go you?\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  To Monsieur de Valvert!\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  Have a care!  It is he who will kill you\r\n(showing him Roxane by a look):\r\n  Stay where you are--she is looking at you.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  It is true!\r\n\r\n(He stands looking at her.  The group of pickpockets seeing him thus, head in\r\nair and open-mouthed, draw near to him.)\r\n\r\nLIGNIERE:\r\n  \'Tis I who am going.  I am athirst!  And they expect me--in the taverns!\r\n\r\n(He goes out, reeling.)\r\n\r\nLE BRET (who has been all round the hall, coming back to Ragueneau reassured):\r\n  No sign of Cyrano.\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU (incredulously):\r\n  All the same. . .\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  A hope is left to me--that he has not seen the playbill!\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIENCE:\r\n  Begin, begin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene 1.III.\r\n\r\nThe same, all but Ligniere.  De Guiche, Valvert, then Montfleury.\r\n\r\nA marquis (watching De Guiche, who comes down from Roxane\'s box, and crosses\r\nthe pit surrounded by obsequious noblemen, among them the Viscount de\r\nValvert):\r\n  He pays a fine court, your De Guiche!\r\n\r\nANOTHER:\r\n  Faugh!. . .Another Gascon!\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST:\r\n  Ay, but the cold, supple Gascon--that is the stuff success is made of!\r\nBelieve me, we had best make our bow to him.\r\n\r\n(They go toward De Guiche.)\r\n\r\nSECOND MARQUIS:\r\n  What fine ribbons!

A large kitchen at the corner of the Rue\r\nSt. Honore and the Rue de l\'Arbre Sec, which are seen in the background\r\nthrough the glass door, in the gray dawn.\r\n\r\nOn the left, in the foreground, a counter, surmounted by a stand in forged\r\niron, on which are hung geese, ducks, and water peacocks.  In great china\r\nvases are tall bouquets of simple flowers, principally yellow sunflowers.\r\n\r\nOn the same side, farther back, an immense open fireplace, in front of which,\r\nbetween monster firedogs, on each of which hangs a little saucepan; the roasts\r\nare dripping into the pans.\r\n\r\nOn the right, foreground with door.\r\n\r\nFarther back, staircase leading to a little room under the roof, the entrance\r\nof which is visible through the open shutter.  In this room a table is laid.\r\nA small Flemish luster is alight.  It is a place for eating and drinking.  A\r\nwooden gallery, continuing the staircase, apparently leads to other similar\r\nlittle rooms.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the shop an iron hoop is suspended from the ceiling by a\r\nstring with which it can be drawn up and down, and big game is hung around it.\r\n\r\nThe ovens in the darkness under the stairs give forth a red glow.  The copper\r\npans shine.  The spits are turning.  Heaps of food formed into pyramids.  Hams\r\nsuspended.  It is the busy hour of the morning.  Bustle and hurry of\r\nscullions, fat cooks, and diminutive apprentices, their caps profusely\r\ndecorated with cock\'s feathers and wings of guinea-fowl.\r\n\r\nOn metal and wicker plates they are bringing in piles of cakes and tarts.\r\n\r\nTables laden with rolls and dishes of food.  Other tables surrounded with\r\nchairs are ready for the consumers.\r\n\r\nA small table in a corner covered with papers, at which Ragueneau is seated\r\nwriting on the rising of the curtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene 2.I.\r\n\r\nRagueneau, pastry-cooks, then Lise.

A perspective of little\r\nstreets.  On the right Roxane\'s house and the wall of her garden overhung with\r\nthick foliage.  Window and balcony over the door.  A bench in front.\r\n\r\nFrom the bench and the stones jutting out of the wall it is easy to climb to\r\nthe balcony.  In front of an old house in the same style of brick and stone.\r\nThe knocker of this door is bandaged with linen like a sore thumb.\r\n\r\nAt the rising of the curtain the duenna is seated on the bench.\r\n\r\nThe window on Roxane\'s balcony is wide open.\r\n\r\nRagueneau is standing near the door in a sort of livery.  He has just finished\r\nrelating something to the duenna, and is wiping his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene 3.I.\r\n\r\nRagueneau, the duenna.  Then Roxane, Cyrano, and two pages.\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  --And then, off she went, with a musketeer!  Deserted and ruined too, I\r\nwould make an end of all, and so hanged myself.  My last breath was drawn:--\r\nthen in comes Monsieur de Bergerac!  He cuts me down, and begs his cousin to\r\ntake me for her steward.\r\n\r\nTHE DUENNA:\r\n  Well, but how came it about that you were thus ruined?\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  Oh!  Lise loved the warriors, and I loved the poets!  What cakes there were\r\nthat Apollo chanced to leave were quickly snapped up by Mars.  Thus ruin was\r\nnot long a-coming.\r\n\r\nTHE DUENNA (rising, and calling up to the open window):\r\n  Roxane, are you ready?  They wait for us!\r\n\r\nROXANE\'S VOICE (from the window):\r\n  I will but put me on a cloak!\r\n\r\nTHE DUENNA (to Ragueneau, showing him the door opposite):\r\n  They wait us there opposite, at Clomire\'s house.  She receives them all\r\nthere to-day--the precieuses, the poets; they read a discourse on the Tender\r\nPassion.\r\n\r\nRAGUENEAU:\r\n  The Tender Passion?\r\n\r\nTHE DUENNA (in a mincing voice):\r\n  Ay, indeed!\r\n(Calling up to the window):\r\n  Roxane, an you come not down quickly, we shall miss the discourse on the\r\nTender Passion!\r\n\r\nROXANE\'S VOICE:\r\n  I come!  I come!\r\n\r\n(A sound of stringed instruments approaching.)\r\n\r\nCYRANO\'S VOICE (behind the scenes, singing):\r\n  La, la, la, la!\r\n\r\nTHE DUENNA (surprised):\r\n  They serenade us?\r\n\r\nCYRANO (followed by two pages with arch-lutes):\r\n  I tell you they are demi-semi-quavers, demi-semi-fool!\r\n\r\nFIRST PAGE (ironically):\r\n  You know then, Sir, to distinguish between semi-quavers and demi-semi-\r\nquavers?\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  Is not every disciple of Gassendi a musician?\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE (playing and singing):\r\n  La, la!\r\n\r\nCYRANO (snatching the lute from him, and going on with the phrase):\r\n  In proof of which, I can continue!

We were disputing a nice point in\r\ngrammar; contradictions raged hotly--\'\'Tis so!\'  \'Nay, \'tis so!\' when suddenly\r\nhe shows me these two long-shanks, whom he takes about with him as an escort,\r\nand who are skillful in scratching lute-strings with their skinny claws!  \'I\r\nwill wager you a day\'s music,\' says he!--And lost it!  Thus, see you, till\r\nPhoebus\' chariot starts once again, these lute-twangers are at my heels,\r\nseeing all I do, hearing all I say, and accompanying all with melody.  \'Twas\r\npleasant at the first, but i\' faith, I begin to weary of it already!\r\n(To the musicians):\r\n  Ho there! go serenade Montfleury for me!  Play a dance to him!\r\n(The pages go toward the door.  To the duenna):\r\n  I have come, as is my wont, nightly, to ask Roxane whether. . .\r\n(To the pages, who are going out):\r\n  Play a long time,--and play out of tune!\r\n(To the duenna):\r\n  . . .Whether her soul\'s elected is ever the same, ever faultless!\r\n\r\nROXANE (coming out of the house):\r\n  Ah!  How handsome he is, how brilliant a wit!  And--how well I love him!\r\n\r\nCYRANO (smiling):\r\n  Christian has so brilliant a wit?\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  Brighter than even your own, cousin!\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  Be it so, with all my heart!\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  Ah! methinks \'twere impossible that there could breathe a man on this earth\r\nskilled to say as sweetly as he all the pretty nothings that mean so much--\r\nthat mean all!

That is ill said!  But lo! men are ever thus!  Because he is fair to\r\nsee, you would have it that he must be dull of speech.\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  He hath an eloquent tongue in telling his love?\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  In telling his love? why, \'tis not simple telling, \'tis dissertation, \'tis\r\nanalysis!\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  How is he with the pen?\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  Still better!

Dost begin, sweet,\r\n  To understand?  So late, dost understand me?\r\n  Feel\'st thou my soul, here, through the darkness mounting?\r\n  Too fair the night!  Too fair, too fair the moment!\r\n  That I should speak thus, and that you should hearken!\r\n  Too fair!  In moments when my hopes rose proudest,\r\n  I never hoped such guerdon.  Naught is left me\r\n  But to die now!  Have words of mine the power\r\n  To make you tremble,--throned there in the branches?\r\n  Ay, like a leaf among the leaves, you tremble!\r\n  You tremble!

Hurt I modesty?\r\n  If so--the kiss I asked--oh, grant it not.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN (to Cyrano, pulling him by his cloak):\r\n  Why?\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  Silence, Christian!

Arms strewn about, drums, etc.  Day is breaking with a faint glimmer\r\nof yellow sunrise in the east.  Sentinels at different points.  Watch-fires.\r\nThe cadets of Gascony, wrapped in their mantles, are sleeping.  Carbon de\r\nCastel-Jaloux and Le Bret are keeping watch.  They are very pale and thin.\r\nChristian sleeps among the others in his cloak in the foreground, his face\r\nilluminated by the fire.  Silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene 4.I.\r\n\r\nChristian, Carbon de Castel-Jaloux, Le Bret, the cadets, then Cyrano.\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  \'Tis terrible.\r\n\r\nCARBON:\r\n  Not a morsel left.\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  Mordioux!\r\n\r\nCARBON (making a sign that he should speak lower):\r\n  Curse under your breath.

To take letters at each day\'s dawn.  To risk. . .\r\n\r\nCYRANO (stopping before Christian):\r\n  I promised he should write often.\r\n(He looks at him):\r\n  He sleeps.  How pale he is!

I ran but little risk.  I have found me a spot\r\nto pass the Spanish lines, where each night they lie drunk.\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  You should try to bring us back provision.\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  A man must carry no weight who would get by there!  But there will be\r\nsurprise for us this night.  The French will eat or die. . .if I mistake not!\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  Oh!. . .tell me!. . .\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  Nay, not yet.  I am not certain. . .You will see!\r\n\r\nCARBON:\r\n  It is disgraceful that we should starve while we\'re besieging!\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  Alas, how full of complication is this siege of Arras!  To think that while\r\nwe are besieging, we should ourselves be caught in a trap and besieged by the\r\nCardinal Infante of Spain.\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  It were well done if he should be besieged in his turn.\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  I am in earnest.\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  Oh! indeed!\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  To think you risk a life so precious. . .for the sake of a letter. .\r\n.Thankless one.\r\n(Seeing him turning to enter the tent):\r\n  Where are you going?\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  I am going to write another.\r\n\r\n(He enters the tent and disappears.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene 4.II.\r\n\r\nThe same, all but Cyrano.  The day is breaking in a rosy light.  The town of\r\nArras is golden in the horizon.  The report of cannon is heard in the\r\ndistance, followed immediately by the beating of drums far away to the left.\r\nOther drums are heard much nearer.  Sounds of stirring in the camp. Voices of\r\nofficers in the distance.\r\n\r\nCARBON (sighing):\r\n  The reveille!\r\n(The cadets move and stretch themselves):\r\n  Nourishing sleep!

The cadets stifle their laughter in their cards and dice-boxes. De\r\nGuiche turns and looks at them; they instantly become grave, and set to play.\r\nOne of them whistles indifferently the air just played by the fifer.)\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE (taking the scarf):\r\n  I thank you.  It will now enable me\r\n  To make a signal,--that I had forborne\r\n  To make--till now.\r\n\r\n(He goes to the rampart, climbs it, and waves the scarf thrice.)\r\n\r\nALL:\r\n  What\'s that?\r\n\r\nTHE SENTINEL (from the top of the rampart):\r\n  See you yon man\r\n  Down there, who runs?. . .\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE (descending):\r\n  \'Tis a false Spanish spy\r\n  Who is extremely useful to my ends.\r\n  The news he carries to the enemy\r\n  Are those I prompt him with--so, in a word,\r\n  We have an influence on their decisions!\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  Scoundrel!\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE (carelessly knotting on his scarf):\r\n  \'Tis opportune.  What were we saying?\r\n  Ah! I have news for you.  Last evening\r\n  --To victual us--the Marshal did attempt\r\n  A final effort:--secretly he went\r\n  To Dourlens, where the King\'s provisions be.\r\n  But--to return to camp more easily--\r\n  He took with him a goodly force of troops.\r\n  Those who attacked us now would have fine sport!\r\n  Half of the army\'s absent from the camp!\r\n\r\nCARBON:\r\n  Ay, if the Spaniards knew, \'twere ill for us,\r\n  But they know nothing of it?\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE:\r\n  Oh! they know.\r\n  They will attack us.\r\n\r\nCARBON:\r\n  Ah!\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE:\r\n  For my false spy\r\n  Came to warn me of their attack.  He said,\r\n  \'I can decide the point for their assault;\r\n  Where would you have it?  I will tell them \'tis\r\n  The least defended--they\'ll attempt you there.\'\r\n  I answered, \'Good.  Go out of camp, but watch\r\n  My signal.

Who will push a drum hither for me?\r\n(She seats herself on the drum they roll forward):\r\n  So!  I thank you.\r\n(She laughs):\r\n  My carriage was fired at\r\n(proudly):\r\n  by the patrol!

It was simple enough, for I had but to\r\npass on and on, as far as I saw the country laid waste.  Ah, what horrors were\r\nthere!  Had I not seen, then I could never have believed it!  Well, gentlemen,\r\nif such be the service of your King, I would fainer serve mine!\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  But \'tis sheer madness!

I but drove quietly forward in my carriage, and when some\r\nhidalgo of haughty mien would have stayed me, lo! I showed at the window my\r\nsweetest smile, and these Senors being (with no disrespect to you) the most\r\ngallant gentlemen in the world,--I passed on!\r\n\r\nCARBON:\r\n  True, that smile is a passport!  But you must have been asked frequently to\r\ngive an account of where you were going, Madame?\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  Yes, frequently.  Then I would answer, \'I go to see my lover.\'  At that word\r\nthe very fiercest Spaniard of them all would gravely shut the carriage-door,\r\nand, with a gesture that a king might envy, make signal to his men to lower\r\nthe muskets leveled at me;--then, with melancholy but withal very graceful\r\ndignity--his beaver held to the wind that the plumes might flutter bravely, he\r\nwould bow low, saying to me, \'Pass on, Senorita!\'\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  But, Roxane. . .\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  Forgive me that I said, \'my lover!\'  But bethink you, had I said \'my\r\nhusband,\' not one of them had let me pass!\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  But. . .\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  What ails you?\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE:\r\n  You must leave this place!\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  I?\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  And that instantly!\r\n\r\nLE BRET:\r\n  No time to lose.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  Indeed, you must.\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  But wherefore must I?\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN (embarrassed):\r\n  \'Tis that. . .\r\n\r\nCYRANO (the same):\r\n  --In three quarters of an hour. . .\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE (the same):\r\n  --Or for. . .\r\n\r\nCARBON (the same):\r\n  It were best. . .\r\n\r\nLE BRET (the same):\r\n  You might. . .\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  You are going to fight?--I stay here.\r\n\r\nALL:\r\n  No, no!\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  He is my husband!\r\n(She throws herself into Christian\'s arms):\r\n  They shall kill us both together!\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN:\r\n  Why do you look at me thus?\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  I will tell you why!\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE (in despair):\r\n  \'Tis a post of mortal danger!\r\n\r\nROXANE (turning round):\r\n  Mortal danger!\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  Proof enough, that he has put us here!\r\n\r\nROXANE (to De Guiche):\r\n  So, Sir, you would have made a widow of me?\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE:\r\n  Nay, on my oath. . .\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  I will not go!  I am reckless now, and I shall not stir from here!--Besides,\r\n\'tis amusing!\r\n\r\nCYRANO:\r\n  Oh-ho!  So our precieuse is a heroine!\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  Monsieur de Bergerac, I am your cousin.\r\n\r\nA CADET:\r\n  We will defend you well!\r\n\r\nROXANE (more and more excited):\r\n  I have no fear of that, my friends!\r\n\r\nANOTHER (in ecstasy):\r\n  The whole camp smells sweet of orris-root!\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  And, by good luck, I have chosen a hat that will suit well with the\r\nbattlefield!\r\n(Looking at De Guiche):\r\n  But were it not wisest that the Count retire?\r\n  They may begin the attack.\r\n\r\nDE GUICHE:\r\n  That is not to be brooked!

Naught shall make me stir from this spot!\r\n\r\nCARBON (who, like the others, has been buckling, dusting, brushing his hat,\r\nsettling his plume, and drawing on his cuffs, advances to Roxane, and\r\nceremoniously):\r\n  It is perchance more seemly, since things are thus, that I present to you\r\nsome of these gentlemen who are about to have the honor of dying before your\r\neyes.\r\n(Roxane bows, and stands leaning on Christian\'s arm, while Carbon introduces\r\nthe cadets to her):\r\n  Baron de Peyrescous de Colignac!\r\n\r\nTHE CADET (with a low reverence):\r\n  Madame. . .\r\n\r\nCARBON (continuing):\r\n  Baron de Casterac de Cahuzac,--Vidame de Malgouyre Estressac Lesbas\r\nd\'Escarabiot, Chevalier d\'Antignac-Juzet, Baron Hillot de Blagnac-Salechan de\r\nCastel Crabioules. . .\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  But how many names have you each?\r\n\r\nBARON HILLOT:\r\n  Scores!\r\n\r\nCARBON (to Roxane):\r\n  Pray, upon the hand that holds your kerchief.\r\n\r\nROXANE (opens her hand, and the handkerchief falls):\r\n  Why?\r\n\r\n(The whole company start forward to pick it up.)\r\n\r\nCARBON (quickly raising it):\r\n  My company had no flag.  But now, by my faith, they will have the fairest in\r\nall the camp!\r\n\r\nROXANE (smiling):\r\n  \'Tis somewhat small.\r\n\r\nCARBON (tying the handkerchief on the staff of his lance):\r\n  But--\'tis of lace!\r\n\r\nA CADET (to the rest):\r\n  I could die happy, having seen so sweet a face, if I had something in my\r\nstomach--were it but a nut!\r\n\r\nCARBON (who has overheard, indignantly):\r\n  Shame on you!  What, talk of eating when a lovely woman!. . .\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  But your camp air is keen; I myself am famished.  Pasties, cold fricassee,\r\nold wines--there is my bill of fare?

An enormous plane tree in the middle of the stage, standing\r\nalone.  On the right, among big boxwood trees, a semicircular stone bench.\r\n\r\nThe whole background of the stage is crossed by an alley of chestnut trees\r\nleading on the right hand to the door of a chapel seen through the branches.\r\nThrough the double row of trees of this alley are seen lawns, other alleys,\r\nclusters of trees, winding of the park, the sky.\r\n\r\nThe chapel opens by a little side door on to a colonnade which is wreathed\r\nwith autumn leaves, and is lost to view a little farther on in the right-hand\r\nforeground behind the boxwood.\r\n\r\nIt is autumn.  All the foliage is red against the fresh green of the lawns.\r\nThe green boxwood and yews stand out dark.\r\n\r\nUnder each tree a patch of yellow leaves.\r\n\r\nThe stage is strewn with dead leaves, which rustle under foot in the alleys,\r\nand half cover the steps and benches.\r\n\r\nBetween the benches on the right hand and the tree a large embroidery frame,\r\nin front of which a little chair has been set.\r\n\r\nBaskets full of skeins and balls of wool.  A tapestry begun.\r\n\r\nAt the rising of the curtains nuns are walking to and fro in the park; some\r\nare seated on the bench around an older Sister.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are falling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene 5.I.\r\n\r\nMother Marguerite, Sister Martha, Sister Claire, other sisters.\r\n\r\nSISTER MARTHA (to Mother Marguerite):\r\n  Sister Claire glanced in the mirror, once--nay, twice, to see if her coif\r\nsuited.\r\n\r\nMOTHER MARGUERITE (to Sister Claire):\r\n  \'Tis not well.\r\n\r\nSISTER CLAIRE:\r\n  But I saw Sister Martha take a plum\r\n  Out of the tart.\r\n\r\nMOTHER MARGUERITE (to Sister Martha):\r\n  That was ill done, my sister.\r\n\r\nSISTER CLAIRE:\r\n  A little glance!\r\n\r\nSISTER MARTHA:\r\n  And such a little plum!\r\n\r\nMOTHER MARGUERITE:\r\n  I shall tell this to Monsieur Cyrano.\r\n\r\nSISTER CLAIRE:\r\n  Nay, prithee do not!--he will mock!\r\n\r\nSISTER MARTHA:\r\n  He\'ll say we nuns are vain!\r\n\r\nSISTER CLAIRE:\r\n  And greedy!\r\n\r\nMOTHER MARGUERITE (smiling):\r\n  Ay, and kind!\r\n\r\nSISTER CLAIRE:\r\n  Is it not true, pray, Mother Marguerite,\r\n  That he has come, each week, on Saturday\r\n  For ten years, to the convent?\r\n\r\nMOTHER MARGUERITE:\r\n  Ay! and more!\r\n  Ever since--fourteen years ago--the day\r\n  His cousin brought here, \'midst our woolen coifs,\r\n  The worldly mourning of her widow\'s veil,\r\n  Like a blackbird\'s wing among the convent doves!\r\n\r\nSISTER MARTHA:\r\n  He only has the skill to turn her mind\r\n  From grief--unsoftened yet by Time--unhealed!\r\n\r\nALL THE SISTERS:\r\n  He is so droll!--It\'s cheerful when he comes!--\r\n  He teases us!--But we all like him well!--\r\n  --We make him pasties of angelica!\r\n\r\nSISTER MARTHA:\r\n  But, he is not a faithful Catholic!\r\n\r\nSISTER CLAIRE:\r\n  We will convert him!\r\n\r\nTHE SISTERS:\r\n  Yes!

De Guiche, imposing-looking and visibly aged, walks by her side.\r\nThey saunter slowly.  Mother Marguerite rises):\r\n  \'Tis time we go in; Madame Madeleine\r\n  Walks in the garden with a visitor.\r\n\r\nSISTER MARTHA (to Sister Claire, in a low voice):\r\n  The Marshal of Grammont?\r\n\r\nSISTER CLAIRE (looking at him):\r\n  \'Tis he, I think.\r\n\r\nSISTER MARTHA:\r\n  \'Tis many months now since he came to see her.\r\n\r\nTHE SISTERS:\r\n  He is so busy!--The Court,--the camp!. . .\r\n\r\nSISTER CLAIRE:\r\n  The world!\r\n\r\n(They go out.

Two sisters, for a moment.\r\n\r\nROXANE:\r\n  Ah! what a beauty in September\'s close!\r\n  My sorrow\'s eased.  April\'s joy dazzled it,\r\n  But autumn wins it with her dying calm.\r\n(She seats herself at the embroidery frame.

Cyrano, very pale, his hat pulled down over his eyes,\r\nappears.  The sister who had announced him retires.  He descends the steps\r\nslowly, with a visible difficulty in holding himself upright, bearing heavily\r\non his cane.  Roxane still works at her tapestry):\r\n  Time has dimmed the tints. . .\r\n  How harmonize them now?\r\n(To Cyrano, with playful reproach):\r\n  For the first time\r\n  Late!--For the first time, all these fourteen years!\r\n\r\nCYRANO (who has succeeded in reaching the chair, and has seated himself--in a\r\nlively voice, which is in great contrast with his pale face):\r\n  Ay!

Sister Martha crosses the\r\npark from the chapel to the flight of steps.  Roxane, seeing her, signs to her\r\nto approach.)\r\n\r\nROXANE (to Cyrano):\r\n  How now?  You have not teased the Sister?\r\n\r\nCYRANO (hastily opening his eyes):\r\n  True!\r\n(In a comically loud voice):\r\n  Sister! come here!\r\n(The sister glides up to him):\r\n  Ha! ha!  What?

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
