Few English plays have such a\r\npeculiar history. Written in French in 1892 it was in full\r\nrehearsal by Madame Bernhardt at the Palace Theatre when it was\r\nprohibited by the Censor. Oscar Wilde immediately announced his\r\nintention of changing his nationality, a characteristic jest,\r\nwhich was only taken seriously, oddly enough, in Ireland. The\r\ninterference of the Censor has seldom been more popular or more\r\nheartily endorsed by English critics. On its publication in book\r\nform "Salome" was greeted by a chorus of ridicule, and it may be\r\nnoted in passing that at least two of the more violent reviews\r\nwere from the pens of unsuccessful dramatists, while all those\r\nwhose French never went beyond Ollendorff were glad to find in\r\nthat venerable school classic an unsuspected asset in their\r\neducation--a handy missile with which to pelt "Salome" and its\r\nauthor. The correctness of the French was, of course, impugned,\r\nalthough the scrip had been passed by a distinguished French\r\nwriter, to whom I have heard the whole work attributed. The\r\nTimes, while depreciating the drama, gave its author credit for\r\na _tour de force_, in being capable of writing a French play for\r\nMadame Bernhardt, and this drew from him the following letter:--\r\n\r\n     The Times, Thursday, March 2, 1893, p. 4.\r\n\r\n      MR. OSCAR WILDE ON "SALOME."\r\n\r\n      To the Editor of The Times.\r\n\r\n      Sir, My attention has been drawn to a review of\r\n      "Salome" which was published in your columns last\r\n      week. The opinions of English critics on a French work\r\n      of mine have, of course, little, if any, interest for\r\n      me. I write simply to ask you to allow me to correct a\r\n      misstatement that appears in the review in question.\r\n\r\n      The fact that the greatest tragic actress of any stage\r\n      now living saw in my play such beauty that she was\r\n      anxious to produce it, to take herself the part of the\r\n      heroine, to lend to the entire poem the glamour of her\r\n      personality, and to my prose the music of her\r\n      flute-like voice--this was naturally, and always will\r\n      be, a source of pride and pleasure to me, and I look\r\n      forward with delight to seeing Mme. Bernhardt present\r\n      my play in Paris, that vivid centre of art, where\r\n      religious dramas are often performed. But my play was\r\n      in no sense of the words written for this great\r\n      actress. I have never written a play for any actor or\r\n      actress, nor shall I ever do so. Such work is for the\r\n      artisan in literature--not for the artist.\r\n\r\n      I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n      OSCAR WILDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen "Salome" was translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas,\r\nthe illustrator, Aubrey Beardsley, shared some of the obloquy\r\nheaped on Wilde. It is interesting that he should have found\r\ninspiration for his finest work in a play he never admired and by\r\na writer he cordially disliked. The motives are, of course, made\r\nto his hand, and never was there a more suitable material for\r\nthat odd tangent art in which there are no tactile values. The\r\namusing caricatures of Wilde which appear in the _Frontispiece_,\r\n"Enter Herodias" and "The Eyes of Herod," are the only pieces of\r\nvraisemblance in these exquisite designs. The colophon is a real\r\nmasterpiece and a witty criticism of the play as well.\r\n\r\nOn the production of "Salome" by the New Stage Club in May,\r\n1905,[1] the dramatic critics again expressed themselves\r\nvehemently, vociferating their regrets that the play had been\r\ndragged from its obscurity. The obscure drama, however, had\r\nbecome for five years past part of the literature of Europe. It\r\nis performed regularly or intermittently in Holland, Sweden,\r\nItaly, France, and Russia, and it has been translated into every\r\nEuropean language, including the Czech. It forms part of the\r\nrepertoire of the German stage, where it is performed more often\r\nthan any play by any English writer except Shakespeare. Owing,\r\nperhaps, to what I must call its _obscure_ popularity in the\r\ncontinental theatres, Dr. Strauss was preparing his remarkable\r\nopera at the very moment when there appeared the criticisms to\r\nwhich I refer, and since the production of the opera in Dresden\r\nin December, 1905, English musical journalists and correspondents\r\nalways refer to the work as founded on Wilde\'s drama. That is the\r\nonly way in which they can evade an awkward truth--a palpable\r\ncontravention to their own wishes and theories. The music,\r\nhowever, has been set to the actual words of "Salome" in Madame\r\nHedwig Lachmann\'s admirable translation. The words have not been\r\ntransfigured into ordinary operatic nonsense to suit the score,\r\nor the susceptibilities of the English people. I observe that\r\nadmirers of Dr. Strauss are a little mortified that the great\r\nmaster should have found an occasion for composition in a play\r\nwhich they long ago consigned to oblivion and the shambles of\r\nAubrey Beardsley. Wilde himself, in a rhetorical period, seems to\r\nhave contemplated the possibility of his prose drama for a\r\nmusical theme. In "De Profundis" he says: "The refrains, whose\r\nrecurring motifs make \'Salome\' so like a piece of music, and bind\r\nit together as a ballad."\r\n\r\nHe was still incarcerated in 1896, when Mons. Luigne Poe produced\r\nthe play for the first time at the Theatre Libre in Paris, with\r\nLina Muntz in the title role. A rather pathetic reference to this\r\noccasion occurs in a letter Wilde wrote to me from Reading:--\r\n\r\n"Please say how gratified I was at the performance of my play,\r\nand have my thanks conveyed to Luigne Poe. It is something that\r\nat a time of disgrace and shame I should still be regarded as an\r\nartist. I wish I could feel more pleasure, but I seem dead to all\r\nemotions except those of anguish and despair. However, please let\r\nLuigne Poe know that I am sensible of the honour he has done me.\r\nHe is a poet himself. Write to me in answer to this, and try and\r\nsee what Lemaitre, Bauer, and Sarcey said of \'Salome.\'"\r\n\r\nThe bias of personal friendship precludes me from praising or\r\ndefending "Salome," even if it were necessary to do so. Nothing I\r\nmight say would add to the reputation of its detractors. Its\r\nsources are obvious; particularly Flaubert and Maeterlinck, in\r\nwhose peculiar and original style it is an essay. A critic, for\r\nwhom I have a greater regard than many of his contemporaries,\r\nsays that "Salome" is only a catalogue; but a catalogue can be\r\nintensely dramatic, as we know when the performance takes place\r\nat Christie\'s; few plays are more exciting than an auction in\r\nKing Street when the stars are fighting _for_ Sisera.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that Wilde confuses Herod the Great (_Mat._\r\nxi. 1), Herod Antipas (_Mat._ xiv. 3), and Herod Agrippa (Acts\r\nxiii), but the confusion is intentional, as in mediaeval mystery\r\nplays Herod is taken for a type, not an historical character, and\r\nthe criticism is about as valuable as that of people who\r\nlaboriously point out the anachronisms in Beardsley\'s designs.\r\nWith reference to the charge of plagiarism brought against\r\n"Salome" and its author, I venture to mention a personal\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nWilde complained to me one day that someone in a well-known novel\r\nhad stolen an idea of his. I pleaded in defence of the culprit\r\nthat Wilde himself was a fearless literary thief. "My dear\r\nfellow," he said, with his usual drawling emphasis, "when I see a\r\nmonstrous tulip with four wonderful petals in someone else\'s\r\ngarden, I am impelled to grow a monstrous tulip with five\r\nwonderful petals, but that is no reason why someone should grow a\r\ntulip with only three petals." THAT WAS OSCAR WILDE.\r\n\r\nROBERT ROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A more recent performance of "Salome" (1906), by the Literary\r\nTheatre Club, has again produced an ebullition of rancour and\r\ndeliberate misrepresentation on the part of the dramatic critics,\r\nthe majority of whom are anxious to parade their ignorance of the\r\ncontinental stage. The production was remarkable on account of\r\nthe beautiful dresses and mounting, for which Mr. Charles\r\nRicketts was responsible, and the marvellous impersonation of\r\nHerod by Mr. Robert Farquharson. Wilde used to say that "Salome"\r\nwas a mirror in which everyone could see himself. The artist,\r\nart; the dull, dulness; the vulgar, vulgarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE PICTURES BY AUBREY BEARDSLEY.\r\n\r\n1. THE WOMAN IN THE MOON. 2. TITLE PAGE. 3.

How strange the moon seems! She is like a woman\r\nrising from a tomb. She is like a dead woman. You would fancy she\r\nwas looking for dead things.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nShe has a strange look. She is like a little princess who wears a\r\nyellow veil, and whose feet are of silver. She is like a princess\r\nwho has little white doves for feet. You would fancy she was\r\ndancing.\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\r\n\r\nShe is like a woman who is dead. She moves very slowly.\r\n\r\n[_Noise in the banqueting-hall._]\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWhat an uproar! Who are those wild beasts howling?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThe Jews. They are always like that. They are disputing about\r\ntheir religion.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWhy do they dispute about their religion?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nI cannot tell. They are always doing it. The Pharisees, for\r\ninstance, say that there are angels, and the Sadducees declare\r\nthat angels do not exist.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nI think it is ridiculous to dispute about such things.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nHow beautiful is the Princess Salome to-night!\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\r\n\r\nYou are always looking at her. You look at her too much. It is\r\ndangerous to look at people in such fashion. Something terrible\r\nmay happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEACOCK SKIRT]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nShe is very beautiful to-night.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThe Tetrarch has a sombre look.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nYes; he has a sombre look.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nHe is looking at something.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nHe is looking at some one.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nAt whom is he looking?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nI cannot tell.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nHow pale the Princess is! Never have I seen her so pale. She is\r\nlike the shadow of a white rose in a mirror of silver.\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\r\n\r\nYou must not look at her. You look too much at her.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nHerodias has filled the cup of the Tetrarch.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nIs that the Queen Herodias, she who wears a black mitre sewn with\r\npearls, and whose hair is powdered with blue dust?\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nYes; that is Herodias, the Tetrarch\'s wife.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThe Tetrarch is very fond of wine. He has wine of three sorts.\r\nOne which is brought from the Island of Samothrace, and is purple\r\nlike the cloak of Caesar.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nI have never seen Caesar.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nAnother that comes from a town called Cyprus, and is yellow like\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nI love gold.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nAnd the third is a wine of Sicily. That wine is red like blood.\r\n\r\nTHE NUBIAN\r\n\r\nThe gods of my country are very fond of blood. Twice in the year\r\nwe sacrifice to them young men and maidens; fifty young men and\r\na hundred maidens. But it seems we never give them quite enough,\r\nfor they are very harsh to us.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nIn my country there are no gods left. The Romans have driven them\r\nout. There are some who say that they have hidden themselves in\r\nthe mountains, but I do not believe it. Three nights I have been\r\non the mountains seeking them everywhere. I did not find them.\r\nAnd at last I called them by their names, and they did not come.\r\nI think they are dead.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThe Jews worship a God that you cannot see.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nI cannot understand that.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nIn fact, they only believe in things that you cannot see.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nThat seems to me altogether ridiculous.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nAfter me shall come another mightier than I. I am not worthy so\r\nmuch as to unloose the latchet of his shoes. When he cometh, the\r\nsolitary places shall be glad. They shall blossom like the lily.\r\nThe eyes of the blind shall see the day, and the ears of the deaf\r\nshall be opened. The new-born child shall put his hand upon the\r\ndragon\'s lair, he shall lead the lions by their manes.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nMake him be silent. He is always saying ridiculous things.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nNo, no. He is a holy man. He is very gentle, too. Every day, when\r\nI give him to eat he thanks me.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nWho is he?\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nA prophet.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nWhat is his name?\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nJokanaan.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nWhence comes he?\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nFrom the desert, where he fed on locusts and wild honey. He was\r\nclothed in camel\'s hair, and round his loins he had a leathern\r\nbelt. He was very terrible to look upon. A great multitude used\r\nto follow him. He even had disciples.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nWhat is he talking of?\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWe can never tell. Sometimes he says terrible things, but it is\r\nimpossible to understand what he says.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nMay one see him?\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nNo. The Tetrarch has forbidden it.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nThe Princess has hidden her face behind her fan! Her little white\r\nhands are fluttering like doves that fly to their dove-cots. They\r\nare like white butterflies. They are just like white butterflies.\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\r\n\r\nWhat is that to you? Why do you look at her? You must not look at\r\nher.... Something terrible may happen.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\n[_Pointing to the cistern._]\r\n\r\nWhat a strange prison!\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nIt is an old cistern.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nAn old cistern! It must be very unhealthy.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nOh no! For instance, the Tetrarch\'s brother, his elder brother,\r\nthe first husband of Herodias the Queen, was imprisoned there for\r\ntwelve years. It did not kill him. At the end of the twelve years\r\nhe had to be strangled.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nStrangled? Who dared to do that?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\n[_Pointing to the Executioner, a huge Negro._]\r\n\r\nThat man yonder, Naaman.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nHe was not afraid?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nOh no! The Tetrarch sent him the ring.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nWhat ring?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLACK CAPE]\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThe death-ring. So he was not afraid.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nYet it is a terrible thing to strangle a king.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWhy? Kings have but one neck, like other folk.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\r\n\r\nI think it terrible.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nThe Princess rises! She is leaving the table! She looks very\r\ntroubled. Ah, she is coming this way. Yes, she is coming towards\r\nus. How pale she is! Never have I seen her so pale.\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\r\n\r\nDo not look at her. I pray you not to look at her.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nShe is like a dove that has strayed.... She is like a narcissus\r\ntrembling in the wind.... She is like a silver flower.\r\n\r\n[_Enter Salome_.]\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI will not stay. I cannot stay. Why does the Tetrarch look at me\r\nall the while with his mole\'s eyes under his shaking eyelids? It\r\nis strange that the husband of my mother looks at me like that.\r\nI know not what it means. In truth, yes, I know it.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nYou have just left the feast, Princess?\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nHow sweet the air is here! I can breathe here! Within there are\r\nJews from Jerusalem who are tearing each other in pieces over\r\ntheir foolish ceremonies, and barbarians who drink and drink, and\r\nspill their wine on the pavement, and Greeks from Smyrna with\r\npainted eyes and painted cheeks, and frizzed hair curled in\r\ntwisted coils, and silent, subtle Egyptians, with long nails of\r\njade and russett cloaks, and Romans brutal and coarse, with their\r\nuncouth jargon. Ah! how I loathe the Romans! They are rough and\r\ncommon, and they give themselves the airs of noble lords.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nWill you be seated, Princess?\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\r\n\r\nWhy do you speak to her? Why do you look at her? Oh! something\r\nterrible will happen.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nHow good to see the moon! She is like a little piece of money,\r\nyou would think she was a little silver flower. The moon is cold\r\nand chaste. I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin\'s beauty.\r\nYes, she is a virgin. She has never defiled herself. She has\r\nnever abandoned herself to men, like the other goddesses.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nThe Lord hath come. The son of man hath come. The centaurs have\r\nhidden themselves in the rivers, and the sirens have left the\r\nrivers, and are lying beneath the leaves of the forest.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nWho was that who cried out?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThe prophet, Princess.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nAh, the prophet! He of whom the Tetrarch is afraid?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of that, Princess. It was the prophet Jokanaan\r\nwho cried out.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nIs it your pleasure that I bid them bring your litter, Princess?\r\nThe night is fair in the garden.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nHe says terrible things about my mother, does he not?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWe never understand what he says, Princess.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nYes; he says terrible things about her.\r\n\r\n[_Enter a Slave_.]\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE\r\n\r\nPrincess, the Tetrarch prays you to return to the feast.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI will not go back.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nPardon me, Princess, but if you do not return some misfortune may\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nIs he an old man, this prophet?\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nPrincess, it were better to return. Suffer me to lead you in.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nThis prophet ... is he an old man?\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nNo, Princess, he is quite a young man.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nYou cannot be sure. There are those who say he is Elias.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nWho is Elias?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nA very ancient prophet of this country, Princess.\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE\r\n\r\nWhat answer may I give the Tetrarch from the Princess?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nRejoice not thou, land of Palestine, because the rod of him who\r\nsmote thee is broken.

I would speak with him.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nI fear it is impossible, Princess. The Tetrarch does not wish any\r\none to speak with him. He has even forbidden the high priest to\r\nspeak with him.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI desire to speak with him.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, Princess.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI will speak with him.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nWould it not be better to return to the banquet?\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nBring forth this prophet.\r\n\r\n                             [_Exit the slave._]\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWe dare not, Princess.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\n[_Approaching the cistern and looking down into it._]\r\n\r\nHow black it is, down there!

I am sure that some misfortune will\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\n[_Going up to the young Syrian._]\r\n\r\nYou will do this tiling for me, will you not, Narraboth? You will\r\ndo this thing for me. I have always been kind to you. You will do\r\nit for me. I would but look at this strange prophet. Men have\r\ntalked so much of him. Often have I heard the Tetrarch talk of\r\nhim. I think the Tetrarch is afraid of him. Are you, even you,\r\nalso afraid of him, Narraboth?\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nI fear him not, Princess; there is no man I fear. But the\r\nTetrarch has formally forbidden that any man should raise the\r\ncover of this well.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nYou will do this thing for me, Narraboth, and to-morrow when I\r\npass in my litter beneath the gateway of the idol-sellers I will\r\nlet fall for you a little flower, a little green flower.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nPrincess, I cannot, I cannot.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\n[_Smiling_.]\r\n\r\nYou will do this thing for me, Narraboth. You know that you will\r\ndo this thing for me. And to-morrow when I pass in my litter by\r\nthe bridge of the idol-buyers, I will look at you through the\r\nmuslin veils, I will look at you, Narraboth, it may be I will\r\nsmile at you. Look at me, Narraboth, look at me. Ah! you know\r\nthat you will do what I ask of you. You know it well.... I know\r\nthat you will do this thing.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\n[_Signing to the third soldier._]\r\n\r\nLet the prophet come forth.... The Princess Salome desires to see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nAh!\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\r\n\r\nOh! How strange the moon looks. You would think it was the hand\r\nof a dead woman who is seeking to cover herself with a shroud.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nShe has a strange look! She is like a little princess, whose eyes\r\nare eyes of amber. Through the clouds of muslin she is smiling\r\nlike a little princess.\r\n\r\n[_The prophet comes out of the cistern.

Though she will never repent, but will stick fast in\r\nher abominations; bid her come, for the fan of the Lord is in His\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nBut he is terrible, he is terrible!\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nDo not stay here, Princess, I beseech you.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nIt is his eyes above all that are terrible. They are like black\r\nholes burned by torches in a Tyrian tapestry. They are like black\r\ncaverns where dragons dwell. They are like the black caverns of\r\nEgypt in which the dragons make their lairs. They are like black\r\nlakes troubled by fantastic moons....

He is like an\r\nimage of silver. I am sure he is chaste as the moon is. He is\r\nlike a moonbeam, like a shaft of silver. His flesh must be cool\r\nlike ivory. I would look closer at him.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nNo, no, Princess.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI must look at him closer.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nPrincess!

Thy body is white like the\r\nlilies of a field that the mower hath never mowed. Thy body is\r\nwhite like the snows that lie on the mountains, like the snows\r\nthat lie on the mountains of Judaea, and come down into the\r\nvalleys. The roses in the garden of the Queen of Arabia are not\r\nso white as thy body. Neither the roses in the garden of the\r\nQueen of Arabia, the perfumed garden of spices of the Queen of\r\nArabia, nor the feet of the dawn when they light on the leaves,\r\nnor the breast of the moon when she lies on the breast of the\r\nsea.... There is nothing in the world so white as thy body. Let\r\nme touch thy body.\r\n\r\nJOKANAAN\r\n\r\nBack! daughter of Babylon! By woman came evil into the world.\r\nSpeak not to me. I will not listen to thee. I listen but to the\r\nvoice of the Lord God.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nThy body is hideous. It is like the body of a leper. It is like a\r\nplastered wall where vipers have crawled; like a plastered wall\r\nwhere the scorpions have made their nest. It is like a whitened\r\nsepulchre full of loathsome things. It is horrible, thy body is\r\nhorrible. It is of thy hair that I am enamoured, Jokanaan. Thy\r\nhair is like clusters of grapes, like the clusters of black\r\ngrapes that hang from the vine-trees of Edom in the land of the\r\nEdomites. Thy hair is like the cedars of Lebanon, like the great\r\ncedars of Lebanon that give their shade to the lions and to the\r\nrobbers who would hide themselves by day. The long black nights,\r\nwhen the moon hides her face, when the stars are afraid, are not\r\nso black. The silence that dwells in the forest is not so black.\r\nThere is nothing in the world so black as thy hair.... Let me\r\ntouch thy hair.\r\n\r\nJOKANAAN\r\n\r\nBack, daughter of Sodom! Touch me not. Profane not the temple of\r\nthe Lord God.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nThy hair is horrible. It is covered with mire and dust. It is\r\nlike a crown of thorns which they have placed on thy forehead. It\r\nis like a knot of black serpents writhing round thy neck. I love\r\nnot thy hair.... It is thy mouth that I desire, Jokanaan. Thy\r\nmouth is like a band of scarlet on a tower of ivory. It is like a\r\npomegranate cut with a knife of ivory. The pomegranate-flowers\r\nthat blossom in the gardens of Tyre, and are redder than roses,\r\nare not so red. The red blasts of trumpets that herald the\r\napproach of kings, and make afraid the enemy, are not so red.\r\nThy mouth is redder than the feet of those who tread the wine in\r\nthe wine-press. Thy mouth is redder than the feet of the doves\r\nwho haunt the temples and are fed by the priests. It is redder\r\nthan the feet of him who cometh from a forest where he hath slain\r\na lion, and seen gilded tigers. Thy mouth is like a branch of\r\ncoral that fishers have found in the twilight of the sea, the\r\ncoral that they keep for the kings!... It is like the vermilion\r\nthat the Moabites find in the mines of Moab, the vermilion that\r\nthe kings take from them. It is like the bow of the King of the\r\nPersians, that is painted with vermilion, and is tipped with\r\ncoral. There is nothing in the world so red as thy mouth.... Let\r\nme kiss thy mouth.\r\n\r\nJOKANAAN\r\n\r\nNever! daughter of Babylon! Daughter of Sodom! Never.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan. I will kiss thy mouth.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nPrincess, Princess, thou who art like a garden of myrrh, thou who\r\nart the dove of all doves, look not at this man, look not at him!\r\nDo not speak such words to him. I cannot suffer them....\r\nPrincess, Princess, do not speak these things.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\r\n\r\nAh! [_He kills himself and falls between Salome and Jokanaan._]\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\r\n\r\nThe young Syrian has slain himself! The young captain has slain\r\nhimself! He has slain himself who was my friend! I gave him a\r\nlittle box of perfumes and ear-rings wrought in silver, and now\r\nhe has killed himself! Ah, did he not foretell that some\r\nmisfortune would happen? I, too, foretold it, and it has\r\nhappened. Well I knew that the moon was seeking a dead thing, but\r\nI knew not that it was he whom she sought. Ah! why did I not hide\r\nhim from the moon? If I had hidden him in a cavern she would not\r\nhave seen him.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nPrincess, the young captain has just killed himself.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nLet me kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nJOKANAAN\r\n\r\nArt thou not afraid, daughter of Herodias? Did I not tell thee\r\nthat I had heard in the palace the beatings of the wings of the\r\nangel of death, and hath he not come, the angel of death?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTER HERODIAS]\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nLet me kiss thy mouth.\r\n\r\nJOKANAAN\r\n\r\nDaughter of adultery, there is but one who can save thee, it is\r\nHe of whom I spake. Go seek Him. He is in a boat on the sea of\r\nGalilee, and He talketh with His disciples. Kneel down on the\r\nshore of the sea, and call unto Him by His name. When He cometh\r\nto thee (and to all who call on Him He cometh), bow thyself at\r\nHis feet and ask of Him the remission of thy sins.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nLet me kiss thy mouth.\r\n\r\nJOKANAAN\r\n\r\nCursed be thou! daughter of an incestuous mother, be thou\r\naccursed!\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nJOKANAAN\r\n\r\nI do no wish to look at thee. I will not look at thee, thou art\r\naccursed, Salome, thou art accursed. [_He goes down into the\r\ncistern._]\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan; I will kiss thy mouth.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWe must bear away the body to another place. The Tetrarch does\r\nnot care to see dead bodies, save the bodies of those whom he\r\nhimself has slain.\r\n\r\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\r\n\r\nHe was my brother, and nearer to me than a brother. I gave him a\r\nlittle box full of perfumes, and a ring of agate that he wore\r\nalways on his hand. In the evening we used to walk by the river,\r\namong the almond trees, and he would tell me of the things of his\r\ncountry. He spake ever very low. The sound of his voice was like\r\nthe sound of the flute, of a flute player. Also he much loved to\r\ngaze at himself in the river. I used to reproach him for that.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nYou are right; we must hide the body. The Tetrarch must not see\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThe Tetrarch will not come to this place. He never comes on the\r\nterrace. He is too much afraid of the prophet.\r\n\r\n[_Enter Herod, Herodias, and all the Court._]\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nWhere is Salome? Where is the Princess? Why did she not return to\r\nthe banquet as I commanded her? Ah! there she is!\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nYou must not look at her! You are always looking at her!\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nThe moon has a strange look to-night. Has she not a strange look?\r\nShe is like a mad woman, a mad woman who is seeking everywhere\r\nfor lovers. She is naked too. She is quite naked. The clouds are\r\nseeking to clothe her nakedness, but she will not let them. She\r\nshows herself naked in the sky. She reels through the clouds like\r\na drunken woman.... I am sure she is looking for lovers. Does she\r\nnot reel like a drunken woman? She is like a mad woman, is she\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nNo; the moon is like the moon, that is all. Let us go within....\r\nYou have nothing to do here.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI will stay here! Manesseh, lay carpets there. Light torches,\r\nbring forth the ivory tables, and the tables of jasper. The air\r\nhere is delicious. I will drink more wine with my guests. We must\r\nshow all honours to the ambassadors of Caesar.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nIt is not because of them that you remain.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nYes; the air is delicious. Come, Herodias, our guests await us.\r\nAh! I have slipped! I have slipped in blood! It is an ill omen.\r\nIt is a very evil omen. Wherefore is there blood here?... and\r\nthis body, what does this body here? Think you I am like the King\r\nof Egypt, who gives no feast to his guests but that he shows them\r\na corpse? Whose is it? I will not look on it.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nIt is our captain, sire. He is the young Syrian whom you made\r\ncaptain only three days ago.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI gave no order that he should be slain.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nHe killed himself, sire.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nFor what reason? I had made him captain.\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWe do not know, sire. But he killed himself.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nThat seems strange to me. I thought it was only the Roman\r\nphilosophers who killed themselves. Is it not true, Tigellinus,\r\nthat the philosophers at Rome kill themselves?\r\n\r\nTIGELLINUS\r\n\r\nThere are some who kill themselves, sire. They are the Stoics.\r\nThe Stoics are coarse people. They are ridiculous people. I\r\nmyself regard them as being perfectly ridiculous.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI also. It is ridiculous to kill oneself.\r\n\r\nTIGELLINUS\r\n\r\nEverybody at Rome laughs at them. The Emperor has written a\r\nsatire against them. It is recited everywhere.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nAh! he has written a satire against them? Caesar is wonderful. He\r\ncan do everything.... It is strange that the young Syrian has\r\nkilled himself. I am sorry he has killed himself. I am very\r\nsorry; for he was fair to look upon. He was even very fair. He\r\nhad very languorous eyes. I remember that I saw that he looked\r\nlanguorously at Salome. Truly, I thought he looked too much at\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nThere are others who look at her too much.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nHis father was a king. I drove him from his kingdom. And you made\r\na slave of his mother, who was a queen, Herodias. So he was here\r\nas my guest, as it were, and for that reason I made him my\r\ncaptain. I am sorry he is dead. Ho! why have you left the body\r\nhere? I will not look at it--away with it! [_They take away the\r\nbody._] It is cold here. There is a wind blowing. Is there not a\r\nwind blowing?\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nNo; there is no wind.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI tell you there is a wind that blows.... And I hear in the air\r\nsomething that is like the beating of wings, like the beating of\r\nvast wings. Do you not hear it?\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI hear nothing.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI hear it no longer. But I heard it. It was the blowing of the\r\nwind, no doubt. It has passed away. But no, I hear it again. Do\r\nyou not hear it? It is just like the beating of wings.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI tell you there is nothing. You are ill. Let us go within.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI am not ill. It is your daughter who is sick. She has the mien\r\nof a sick person. Never have I seen her so pale.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI have told you not to look at her.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nPour me forth wine [_wine is brought_]. Salome, come drink a\r\nlittle wine with me. I have here a wine that is exquisite. Caesar\r\nhimself sent it me. Dip into it thy little red lips, that I may\r\ndrain the cup.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI am not thirsty, Tetrarch.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nYou hear how she answers me, this daughter of yours?\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nShe does right. Why are you always gazing at her?\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nBring me ripe fruits [_fruits are brought_]. Salome, come and eat\r\nfruit with me. I love to see in a fruit the mark of thy little\r\nteeth. Bite but a little of this fruit and then I will eat what\r\nis left.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI am not hungry, Tetrarch.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\n[_To Herodias._] You see how you have brought up this daughter of\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nMy daughter and I come of a royal race. As for thee, thy father\r\nwas a camel driver! He was also a robber!\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nThou liest!\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nThou knowest well that it is true.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nSalome, come and sit next to me. I will give thee the throne of\r\nthy mother.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI am not tired, Tetrarch.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nYou see what she thinks of you.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nBring me--what is it that I desire? I forget. Ah! ah! I remember.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EYES OF HEROD]\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nLo! the time is come! That which I foretold has come to pass,\r\nsaith the Lord God. Lo! the day of which I spoke.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nBid him be silent. I will not listen to his voice. This man is\r\nfor ever vomiting insults against me.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nHe has said nothing against you. Besides, he is a very great\r\nprophet.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI do not believe in prophets. Can a man tell what will come to\r\npass? No man knows it. Moreover, he is for ever insulting me. But\r\nI think you are afraid of him.... I know well that you are afraid\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI am not afraid of him. I am afraid of no man.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI tell you, you are afraid of him. If you are not afraid of him\r\nwhy do you not deliver him to the Jews, who for these six months\r\npast have been clamouring for him?\r\n\r\nA JEW\r\n\r\nTruly, my lord, it were better to deliver him into our hands.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nEnough on this subject. I have already given you my answer. I\r\nwill not deliver him into your hands. He is a holy man. He is a\r\nman who has seen God.\r\n\r\nA JEW\r\n\r\nThat cannot be. There is no man who hath seen God since the\r\nprophet Elias. He is the last man who saw God. In these days God\r\ndoth not show Himself. He hideth Himself. Therefore great evils\r\nhave come upon the land.\r\n\r\nANOTHER JEW\r\n\r\nVerily, no man knoweth if Elias the prophet did indeed see God.\r\nPeradventure it was but the shadow of God that he saw.\r\n\r\nA THIRD JEW\r\n\r\nGod is at no time hidden. He showeth Himself at all times and in\r\neverything. God is in what is evil even as He is in what is good.\r\n\r\nA FOURTH JEW\r\n\r\nThat must not be said. It is a very dangerous doctrine. It is a\r\ndoctrine that cometh from the schools at Alexandria, where men\r\nteach the philosophy of the Greeks. And the Greeks are Gentiles:\r\nThey are not even circumcised.\r\n\r\nA FIFTH JEW\r\n\r\nNo one can tell how God worketh. His ways are very mysterious. It\r\nmay be that the things which we call evil are good, and that the\r\nthings which we call good are evil. There is no knowledge of any\r\nthing. We must needs submit to everything, for God is very\r\nstrong. He breaketh in pieces the strong together with the weak,\r\nfor He regardeth not any man.\r\n\r\nFIRST JEW\r\n\r\nThou speaketh truly. God is terrible; He breaketh the strong and\r\nthe weak as a man brays corn in a mortar. But this man hath never\r\nseen God. No man hath seen God since the prophet Elias.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nMake them be silent. They weary me.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nBut I have heard it said that Jokanaan himself is your prophet\r\nElias.\r\n\r\nTHE JEW\r\n\r\nThat cannot be. It is more than three hundred years since the\r\ndays of the prophet Elias.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nThere be some who say that this man is the prophet Elias..\r\n\r\nA NAZARENE\r\n\r\nI am sure that he is the prophet Elias.\r\n\r\nTHE JEW\r\n\r\nNay, but he is not the prophet Elias.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nSo the day is come, the day of the Lord, and I hear upon the\r\nmountains the feet of Him who shall be the Saviour of the world.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean? The Saviour of the world.\r\n\r\nTIGELLINUS\r\n\r\nIt is a title that Caesar takes.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nBut Caesar is not coming into Judaea. Only yesterday I received\r\nletters from Rome. They contained nothing concerning this matter.\r\nAnd you, Tigellinus, who were at Rome during the winter, you\r\nheard nothing concerning this matter, did you?\r\n\r\nTIGELLINUS\r\n\r\nSire, I heard nothing concerning the matter. I was explaining the\r\ntitle. It is one of Caesar\'s titles.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nBut Caesar cannot come. He is too gouty. They say that his feet\r\nare like the feet of an elephant. Also there are reasons of\r\nState. He who leaves Rome loses Rome. He will not come. Howbeit,\r\nCaesar is lord, he will come if he wishes. Nevertheless, I do not\r\nthink he will come.\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nIt was not concerning Caesar that the prophet spake these words,\r\nsire.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nNot of Caesar?\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nNo, sire.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nConcerning whom then did he speak?\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nConcerning Messias who has come.\r\n\r\nA JEW\r\n\r\nMessiah hath not come.\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nHe hath come, and everywhere He worketh miracles.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS Ho! ho! miracles! I do not believe in miracles. I have\r\nseen too many. [_To the page._] My fan!\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nThis man worketh true miracles. Thus, at a marriage which took\r\nplace in a little town of Galilee, a town of some importance, He\r\nchanged water into wine. Certain persons who were present related\r\nit to me. Also He healed two lepers that were seated before the\r\nGate of Capernaum simply by touching them.\r\n\r\nSECOND NAZARENE\r\n\r\nNay, it was blind men that he healed at Capernaum.\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nNay; they were lepers. But He hath healed blind people also, and\r\nHe was seen on a mountain talking with angels.\r\n\r\nA SADDUCEE\r\n\r\nAngels do not exist.\r\n\r\nA PHARISEE\r\n\r\nAngels exist, but I do not believe that this Man has talked with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nHe was seen by a great multitude of people talking with angels.\r\n\r\nA SADDUCEE\r\n\r\nNot with angels.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nHow these men weary me! They are ridiculous! [_To the page._]\r\nWell! my fan! [_The page gives her the fan._] You have a\r\ndreamer\'s look; you must not dream. It is only sick people who\r\ndream. [_She strikes the page with her fan._]\r\n\r\nSECOND NAZARENE\r\n\r\nThere is also the miracle of the daughter of Jairus.\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nYes, that is sure. No man can gainsay it.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nThese men are mad. They have looked too long on the moon. Command\r\nthem to be silent.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nWhat is this miracle of the daughter of Jairus?\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Jairus was dead. He raised her from the dead.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nHe raises the dead?\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nYea, sire, He raiseth the dead.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI do not wish Him to do that. I forbid Him to do that. I allow no\r\nman to raise the dead. This Man must be found and told that I\r\nforbid Him to raise the dead. Where is this Man at present?\r\n\r\nSECOND NAZARENE\r\n\r\nHe is in every place, my lord, but it is hard to find Him.\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nIt is said that He is now in Samaria.\r\n\r\nA JEW\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that this is not Messias, if He is in Samaria.\r\nIt is not to the Samaritans that Messias shall come. The\r\nSamaritans are accursed. They bring no offerings to the Temple.\r\n\r\nSECOND NAZARENE\r\n\r\nHe left Samaria a few days since. I think that at the present\r\nmoment He is in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nFIRST NAZARENE\r\n\r\nNo; He is not there. I have just come from Jerusalem. For two\r\nmonths they have had no tidings of Him.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nNo matter! But let them find Him, and tell Him from me, I will\r\nnot allow him to raise the dead! To change water into wine, to\r\nheal the lepers and the blind.... He may do these things if He\r\nwill. I say nothing against these things. In truth I hold it a\r\ngood deed to heal a leper. But I allow no man to raise the dead.\r\nIt would be terrible if the dead came back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STOMACH DANCE]\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nAh! the wanton! The harlot! Ah! the daughter of Babylon with her\r\ngolden eyes and her gilded eyelids!--Thus saith the Lord God, Let\r\nthere come up against her a multitude of men. Let the people take\r\nstones and stone her....\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nCommand him to be silent.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nLet the war captains pierce her with their swords, let them crush\r\nher beneath their shields.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nNay, but it is infamous.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nIt is thus that I will wipe out all wickedness from the earth,\r\nand that all women shall learn not to imitate her abominations.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nYou hear what he says against me? You allow him to revile your\r\nwife?\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nHe did not speak your name.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nWhat does that matter? You know well that it is I whom he seeks\r\nto revile. And I am your wife, am I not?\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nOf a truth, dear and noble Herodias, you are my wife, and before\r\nthat you were the wife of my brother.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nIt was you who tore me from his arms.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nOf a truth I was stronger.... But let us not talk of that matter.\r\nI do not desire to talk of it. It is the cause of the terrible\r\nwords that the prophet has spoken. Peradventure on account of it\r\na misfortune will come. Let us not speak of this matter. Noble\r\nHerodias, we are not mindful of our guests. Fill thou my cup, my\r\nwell-beloved. Fill with wine the great goblets of silver, and the\r\ngreat goblets of glass. I will drink to Caesar. There are Romans\r\nhere, we must drink to Caesar.\r\n\r\nALL\r\n\r\nCaesar! Caesar!\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nDo you not see your daughter, how pale she is?\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nWhat is it to you if she be pale or not?\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nNever have I seen her so pale.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nYou must not look at her.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nIn that day the sun shall become black like sackcloth of hair,\r\nand the moon shall become like blood, and the stars of the\r\nheavens shall fall upon the earth like ripe figs that fall from\r\nthe fig-tree, and the kings of the earth shall be afraid.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nAh! Ah! I should like to see that day of which he speaks, when\r\nthe moon shall become like blood, and when the stars shall fall\r\nupon the earth like ripe figs. This prophet talks like a drunken\r\nman ... but I cannot suffer the sound of his voice. I hate his\r\nvoice. Command him to be silent.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI will not. I cannot understand what it is that he saith, but it\r\nmay be an omen.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI do not believe in omens. He speaks like a drunken man.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nIt may be he is drunk with the wine of God.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nWhat wine is that, the wine of God? From what vineyards is it\r\ngathered? In what wine-press may one find it?\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\n[_From this point he looks all the while at Salome._]\r\n\r\nTigellinus, when you were at Rome of late, did the Emperor speak\r\nwith you: on the subject of...?\r\n\r\nTIGELLINUS\r\n\r\nOn what subject, sire?\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nOn what subject? Ah! I asked you a question, did I not? I have\r\nforgotten what I would have asked you.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nYou are looking again at my daughter. You must not look at her. I\r\nhave already said so.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nYou say nothing else.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI say it again.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nAnd that restoration of the Temple about which they have talked\r\nso much, will anything be done? They say the veil of the\r\nSanctuary has disappeared, do they not?\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nIt was thyself didst steal it. Thou speakest at random. I will\r\nnot stay here. Let us go within.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nDance for me, Salome.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI will not have her dance.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI have no desire to dance, Tetrarch.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nSalome, daughter of Herodias, dance for me.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nLet her alone.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI command thee to dance, Salome.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI will not dance, Tetrarch.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\n[_Laughing_].\r\n\r\nYou see how she obeys you.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nWhat is it to me whether she dance or not? It is naught to me.\r\nTo-night I am happy, I am exceeding happy. Never have I been so\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThe Tetrarch has a sombre look. Has he not a sombre look?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nYes, he has a sombre look.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nWherefore should I not be happy? Caesar, who is lord of the world,\r\nwho is lord of all things, loves me well. He has just sent me\r\nmost precious gifts. Also he has promised me to summon to Rome\r\nthe King of Cappadocia, who is my enemy. It may be that at Rome\r\nhe will crucify him, for he is able to do all things that he\r\nwishes. Verily, Caesar is lord. Thus you see I have a right to be\r\nhappy. Indeed, I am happy. I have never been so happy. There is\r\nnothing in the world that can mar my happiness.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nHe shall be seated on this throne. He shall be clothed in scarlet\r\nand purple. In his hand he shall bear a golden cup full of his\r\nblasphemies. And the angel of the Lord shall smite him. He shall\r\nbe eaten of worms.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nYou hear what he says about you. He says that you will be eaten\r\nof worms.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nIt is not of me that he speaks. He speaks never against me. It is\r\nof the King of Cappadocia that he speaks; the King of Cappadocia,\r\nwho is mine enemy. It is he who shall be eaten of worms. It is\r\nnot I. Never has he spoken word against me, this prophet, save\r\nthat I sinned in taking to wife the wife of my brother. It may be\r\nhe is right. For, of a truth, you are sterile.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI am sterile, I? You say that, you that are ever looking at my\r\ndaughter, you that would have her dance for your pleasure? It is\r\nabsurd to say that. I have borne a child. You have gotten no\r\nchild, no, not even from one of your slaves. It is you who are\r\nsterile, not I.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nPeace, woman! I say that you are sterile. You have borne me no\r\nchild, and the prophet says that our marriage is not a true\r\nmarriage. He says that it is an incestuous marriage, a marriage\r\nthat will bring evils.... I fear he is right; I am sure that he\r\nis right. But it is not the moment to speak of such things. I\r\nwould be happy at this moment. Of a truth, I am happy. There is\r\nnothing I lack.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI am glad you are of so fair a humour to-night. It is not your\r\ncustom. But it is late. Let us go within. Do not forget that we\r\nhunt at sunrise. All honours must be shown to Caesar\'s\r\nambassadors, must they not?\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER\r\n\r\nWhat a sombre look the Tetrarch wears.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nYes, he wears a sombre look.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nSalome, Salome, dance for me. I pray thee dance for me. I am sad\r\nto-night. Yes; I am passing sad to-night. When I came hither I\r\nslipped in blood, which is an evil omen; and I heard, I am sure I\r\nheard in the air a beating of wings, a beating of giant wings. I\r\ncannot tell what they mean ... I am sad to-night. Therefore dance\r\nfor me. Dance for me, Salome, I beseech you. If you dance for me\r\nyou may ask of me what you will, and I will give it you, even\r\nunto the half of my kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOILETTE OF SALOME--I]\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\n[_Rising._] Will you indeed give me whatsoever I shall ask,\r\nTetrarch?\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nDo not dance, my daughter.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nEverything, even the half of my kingdom.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nYou swear it, Tetrarch?\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI swear it, Salome.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nDo not dance, my daughter.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nBy what will you swear, Tetrarch?\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nBy my life, by my crown, by my gods. Whatsoever you desire I will\r\ngive it you, even to the half of my kingdom, if you will but\r\ndance for me. O, Salome, Salome, dance for me!\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nYou have sworn, Tetrarch.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI have sworn, Salome.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nAll this I ask, even the half of your kingdom.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nMy daughter, do not dance.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nEven to the half of my kingdom. Thou wilt be passing fair as a\r\nqueen, Salome, if it please thee to ask for the half of my\r\nkingdom. Will she not be fair as a queen? Ah! it is cold here!\r\nThere is an icy wind, and I hear ... wherefore do I hear in the\r\nair this beating of wings? Ah! one might fancy a bird, a huge\r\nblack bird that hovers over the terrace. Why can I not see it,\r\nthis bird? The beat of its wings is terrible. The breath of the\r\nwind of its wings is terrible. It is a chill wind. Nay, but it is\r\nnot cold, it is hot. I am choking. Pour water on my hands. Give\r\nme snow to eat. Loosen my mantle. Quick! quick! loosen my mantle.\r\nNay, but leave it. It is my garland that hurts me, my garland of\r\nroses. The flowers are like fire. They have burned my forehead.\r\n[_He tears the wreath from his head and throws it on the table._]\r\nAh! I can breathe now. How red those petals are! They are like\r\nstains of blood on the cloth. That does not matter. You must not\r\nfind symbols in everything you see. It makes life impossible. It\r\nwere better to say that stains of blood are as lovely as rose\r\npetals. It were better far to say that.... But we will not speak\r\nof this. Now I am happy, I am passing happy. Have I not the\r\nright to be happy? Your daughter is going to dance for me. Will\r\nyou not dance for me, Salome? You have promised to dance for me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOILETTE OF SALOME--II]\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI will not have her dance.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI will dance for you, Tetrarch.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nYou hear what your daughter says. She is going to dance for me.\r\nYou do well to dance for me, Salome. And when you have danced for\r\nme, forget not to ask of me whatsoever you wish. Whatsoever you\r\nwish I will give it you, even to the half of my kingdom. I have\r\nsworn it, have I not?\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nYou have sworn it, Tetrarch.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nAnd I have never broken my word. I am not of those who break\r\ntheir oaths. I know not how to lie. I am the slave of my word,\r\nand my word is the word of a king. The King of Cappadocia always\r\nlies, but he is no true king. He is a coward. Also he owes me\r\nmoney that he will not repay. He has even insulted my\r\nambassadors. He has spoken words that were wounding. But Caesar\r\nwill crucify him when he comes to Rome. I am sure that Caesar will\r\ncrucify him. And if not, yet will he die, being eaten of worms.\r\nThe prophet has prophesied it. Well! wherefore dost thou tarry,\r\nSalome?\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI am awaiting until my slaves bring perfumes to me and the seven\r\nveils, and take off my sandals. [_Slaves bring perfumes and the\r\nseven veils, and take off the sandals of Salome._]\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nAh, you are going to dance with naked feet. \'Tis well!--\'Tis\r\nwell. Your little feet will be like white doves. They will be\r\nlike little white flowers that dance upon the trees.... No, no,\r\nshe is going to dance on blood. There is blood spilt on the\r\nground. She must not dance on blood. It were an evil omen.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nWhat is it to you if she dance on blood? Thou hast waded deep\r\nenough therein....\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nWhat is it to me? Ah! look at the moon! She has become red. She\r\nhas become red as blood. Ah! the prophet prophesied truly. He\r\nprophesied that the moon would become red as blood. Did he not\r\nprophesy it? All of you heard him. And now the moon has become\r\nred as blood. Do ye not see it?\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nOh, yes, I see it well, and the stars are falling like ripe figs,\r\nare they not? and the sun is becoming black like sackcloth of\r\nhair, and the kings of the earth are afraid. That at least one\r\ncan see. The prophet, for once in his life, was right, the kings\r\nof the earth are afraid.... Let us go within. You are sick. They\r\nwill say at Rome that you are mad. Let us go within, I tell you.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\r\n\r\nWho is this who cometh from Edom, who is this who cometh from\r\nBozra, whose raiment is dyed with purple, who shineth in the\r\nbeauty of his garments, who walketh mighty in his greatness?\r\nWherefore is thy raiment stained with scarlet?\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nLet us go within. The voice of that man maddens me. I will not\r\nhave my daughter dance while he is continually crying out. I will\r\nnot have her dance while you look at her in this fashion. In a\r\nword, I will not have her dance.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nDo not rise, my wife, my queen, it will avail thee nothing. I\r\nwill not go within till she hath danced. Dance, Salome, dance for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nDo not dance, my daughter.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI am ready, Tetrarch.\r\n\r\n[_Salome dances the dance of the seven veils._]\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nAh! wonderful! wonderful! You see that she has danced for me,\r\nyour daughter. Come near, Salome, come near, that I may give you\r\nyour reward. Ah! I pay the dancers well. I will pay thee royally.\r\nI will give thee whatsoever thy soul desireth. What wouldst thou\r\nhave? Speak.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\n[_Kneeling_].\r\n\r\nI would that they presently bring me in a silver charger....\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\n[Laughing.]\r\n\r\nIn a silver charger? Surely yes, in a silver charger. She is\r\ncharming, is she not? What is it you would have in a silver\r\ncharger, O sweet and fair Salome, you who are fairer than all the\r\ndaughters of Judaea? What would you have them bring thee in a\r\nsilver charger? Tell me. Whatsoever it may be, they shall give it\r\nyou. My treasures belong to thee. What is it, Salome?\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\n[_Rising_].\r\n\r\nThe head of Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nAh! that is well said, my daughter.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nNo, no!\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nThat is well said, my daughter.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nNo, no, Salome. You do not ask me that. Do not listen to your\r\nmother\'s voice. She is ever giving you evil counsel. Do not heed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI do not heed my mother. It is for mine own pleasure that I ask\r\nthe head of Jokanaan in a silver charger. You hath sworn, Herod.\r\nForget not that you have sworn an oath.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI know it. I have sworn by my gods. I know it well. But I pray\r\nyou, Salome, ask of me something else. Ask of me the half of my\r\nkingdom, and I will give it you. But ask not of me what you have\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI ask of you the head of Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nNo, no, I do not wish it.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nYou have sworn, Herod.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nYes, you have sworn. Everybody heard you. You swore it before\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nBe silent! It is not to you I speak.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nMy daughter has done well to ask the head of Jokanaan. He has\r\ncovered me with insults. He has said monstrous things against me.\r\nOne can see that she loves her mother well. Do not yield, my\r\ndaughter. He has sworn, he has sworn.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nBe silent, speak not to me!... Come, Salome, be reasonable. I\r\nhave never been hard to you. I have ever loved you.... It may be\r\nthat I have loved you too much. Therefore ask not this thing of\r\nme. This is a terrible thing, an awful thing to ask of me.\r\nSurely, I think thou art jesting. The head of a man that is cut\r\nfrom his body is ill to look upon, is it not? It is not meet\r\nthat the eyes of a virgin should look upon such a thing. What\r\npleasure could you have in it? None. No, no, it is not what you\r\ndesire. Hearken to me. I have an emerald, a great round emerald,\r\nwhich Caesar\'s minion sent me. If you look through this emerald\r\nyou can see things which happen at a great distance. Caesar\r\nhimself carries such an emerald when he goes to the circus. But\r\nmy emerald is larger. I know well that it is larger. It is the\r\nlargest emerald in the whole world. You would like that, would\r\nyou not? Ask it of me and I will give it you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DANCER\'S REWARD]\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nI demand the head of Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nYou are not listening. You are not listening. Suffer me to speak,\r\nSalome.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nThe head of Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nNo, no, you would not have that. You say that to trouble me,\r\nbecause I have looked at you all this evening. It is true, I have\r\nlooked at you all this evening. Your beauty troubled me. Your\r\nbeauty has grievously troubled me, and I have looked at you too\r\nmuch. But I will look at you no more. Neither at things, nor at\r\npeople should one look. Only in mirrors should one look, for\r\nmirrors do but show us masks. Oh! oh! bring wine! I thirst....\r\nSalome, Salome, let us be friends. Come now!... Ah! what would I\r\nsay? What was\'t? Ah! I remember!... Salome--nay, but come nearer\r\nto me; I fear you will not hear me--Salome, you know my white\r\npeacocks, my beautiful white peacocks, that walk in the garden\r\nbetween the myrtles and the tall cypress trees. Their beaks are\r\ngilded with gold, and the grains that they eat are gilded with\r\ngold also, and their feet are stained with purple. When they cry\r\nout the rain comes, and the moon shows herself in the heavens\r\nwhen they spread their tails. Two by two they walk between the\r\ncypress trees and the black myrtles, and each has a slave to tend\r\nit. Sometimes they fly across the trees, and anon they crouch in\r\nthe grass, and round the lake. There are not in all the world\r\nbirds so wonderful. There is no king in all the world who\r\npossesses such wonderful birds. I am sure that Caesar himself has\r\nno birds so fair as my birds. I will give you fifty of my\r\npeacocks. They will follow you whithersoever you go, and in the\r\nmidst of them you will be like the moon in the midst of a great\r\nwhite cloud.... I will give them all to you. I have but a\r\nhundred, and in the whole world there is no king who has peacocks\r\nlike unto my peacocks. But I will give them all to you. Only you\r\nmust loose me from my oath, and must not ask of me that which you\r\nhave asked of me.\r\n\r\n                        [_He empties the cup of wine._]\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nGive me the head of Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nWell said, my daughter! As for you, you are ridiculous with your\r\npeacocks.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nBe silent! You cry out always; you cry out like a beast of prey.\r\nYou must not. Your voice wearies me. Be silent, I say Salome,\r\nthink of what you are doing. This man comes perchance from God.\r\nHe is a holy man. The finger of God has touched him. God has put\r\ninto his mouth terrible words. In the palace as in the desert God\r\nis always with him.... At least it is possible. One does not\r\nknow. It is possible that God is for him and with him.\r\nFurthermore, if he died some misfortune might happen to me. In\r\nany case, he said that the day he dies a misfortune will happen\r\nto some one. That could only be to me. Remember, I slipped in\r\nblood when I entered. Also, I heard a beating of wings in the\r\nair, a beating of mighty wings. These are very evil omens, and\r\nthere were others. I am sure there were others though I did not\r\nsee them. Well, Salome, you do not wish a misfortune to happen to\r\nme? You do not wish that. Listen to me, then.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nGive me the head of Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nAh! you are not listening to me. Be calm. I--I am calm. I am\r\nquite calm. Listen. I have jewels hidden in this place--jewels\r\nthat your mother even has never seen; jewels that are marvellous.\r\nI have a collar of pearls, set in four rows. They are like unto\r\nmoons chained with rays of silver. They are like fifty moons\r\ncaught in a golden net. On the ivory of her breast a queen has\r\nworn it. Thou shalt be as fair as a queen when thou wearest it. I\r\nhave amethysts of two kinds, one that is black like wine, and one\r\nthat is red like wine which has been coloured with water. I have\r\ntopazes, yellow as are the eyes of tigers, and topazes that are\r\npink as the eyes of a wood-pigeon, and green topazes that are as\r\nthe eyes of cats. I have opals that burn always, with an icelike\r\nflame, opals that make sad men\'s minds, and are fearful of the\r\nshadows. I have onyxes like the eyeballs of a dead woman. I have\r\nmoonstones that change when the moon changes, and are wan when\r\nthey see the sun. I have sapphires big like eggs, and as blue as\r\nblue flowers. The sea wanders within them and the moon comes\r\nnever to trouble the blue of their waves. I have chrysolites and\r\nberyls and chrysoprases and rubies. I have sardonyx and hyacinth\r\nstones, and stones of chalcedony, and I will give them all to\r\nyou, all, and other things will I add to them. The King of the\r\nIndies has but even now sent me four fans fashioned from the\r\nfeathers of parrots, and the King of Numidia a garment of ostrich\r\nfeathers. I have a crystal, into which it is not lawful for a\r\nwoman to look, nor may young men behold it until they have been\r\nbeaten with rods. In a coffer of nacre I have three wondrous\r\nturquoises. He who wears them on his forehead can imagine things\r\nwhich are not, and he who carries them in his hand can make women\r\nsterile. These are great treasures above all price. They are\r\ntreasures without price. But this is not all. In an ebony coffer\r\nI have two cups of amber, that are like apples of gold. If an\r\nenemy pour poison into these cups, they become like an apple of\r\nsilver. In a coffer incrusted with amber I have sandals incrusted\r\nwith glass. I have mantles that have been brought from the land\r\nof the Seres, and bracelets decked about with carbuncles and with\r\njade that come from the city of Euphrates.... What desirest thou\r\nmore than this, Salome? Tell me the thing that thou desirest, and\r\nI will give it thee. All that thou askest I will give thee, save\r\none thing. I will give thee all that is mine, save one life. I\r\nwill give thee the mantle of the high priest. I will give thee\r\nthe veil of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS\r\n\r\nOh! oh!\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\nGive me the head of Jokanaan.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\n[_Sinking back in his seat_]. Let her be given what she asks! Of\r\na truth she is her mother\'s child! [_The first Soldier\r\napproaches. Herodias draws from the hand of the Tetrarch the ring\r\nof death and gives it to the Soldier, who straightway bears it to\r\nthe Executioner. The Executioner looks scared._] Who has taken my\r\nring? There was a ring on my right hand. Who has drunk my wine?\r\nThere was wine in my cup. It was full of wine. Someone has drunk\r\nit! Oh! surely some evil will befall some one. [_The Executioner\r\ngoes down into the cistern._] Ah! Wherefore did I give my oath?\r\nKings ought never to pledge their word. If they keep it not, it\r\nis terrible, and if they keep it, it is terrible also.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nMy daughter has done well.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nI am sure that some misfortune will happen.\r\n\r\nSALOME\r\n\r\n[_She leans over the cistern and listens._]\r\n\r\nThere is no sound. I hear nothing. Why does he not cry out, this\r\nman? Ah! if any man sought to kill me, I would cry out, I would\r\nstruggle, I would not suffer.... Strike, strike, Naaman, strike,\r\nI tell you.... No, I hear nothing. There is a silence, a terrible\r\nsilence. Ah! something has fallen upon the ground. I heard\r\nsomething fall. It is the sword of the headsman. He is afraid,\r\nthis slave. He has let his sword fall. He dare not kill him. He\r\nis a coward, this slave! Let soldiers be sent. [_She sees the\r\nPage of Herodias and addresses him._] Come hither, thou wert the\r\nfriend of him who is dead, is it not so? Well, I tell thee, there\r\nare not dead men enough. Go to the soldiers and bid them go down\r\nand bring me the thing I ask, the thing the Tetrarch has promised\r\nme, the thing that is mine. [_The Page recoils. She turns to the\r\nsoldiers._] Hither, ye soldiers. Get ye down into this cistern\r\nand bring me the head of this man. [_The Soldiers recoil._]\r\nTetrarch, Tetrarch, command your soldiers that they bring me the\r\nhead of Jokanaan.\r\n\r\n[_A huge black arm, the arm of the Executioner, comes forth from\r\nthe cistern, bearing on a silver shield the head of Jokanaan.\r\nSalome seizes it. Herod hides his face with his cloak. Herodias\r\nsmiles and fans herself. The Nazarenes fall on their knees and\r\nbegin to pray._]\r\n\r\nAh! thou wouldst not suffer me to kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan. Well!\r\nI will kiss it now. I will bite it with my teeth as one bites a\r\nripe fruit. Yes, I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan. I said it; did\r\nI not say it? I said it. Ah! I will kiss it now.... But,\r\nwherefore dost thou not look at me, Jokanaan? Thine eyes that\r\nwere so terrible, so full of rage and scorn, are shut now.\r\nWherefore are they shut? Open thine eyes! Lift up thine eyelids,\r\nJokanaan! Wherefore dost thou not look at me? Art thou afraid of\r\nme, Jokanaan, that thou wilt not look at me?... And thy tongue,\r\nthat was like a red snake darting poison, it moves no more, it\r\nsays nothing now, Jokanaan, that scarlet viper that spat its\r\nvenom upon me. It is strange, is it not? How is it that the red\r\nviper stirs no longer?... Thou wouldst have none of me, Jokanaan.\r\nThou didst reject me. Thou didst speak evil words against me.\r\nThou didst treat me as a harlot, as a wanton, me, Salome,\r\ndaughter of Herodias, Princess of Judaea! Well, Jokanaan, I still\r\nlive, but thou, thou art dead, and thy head belongs to me. I can\r\ndo with it what I will. I can throw it to the dogs and to the\r\nbirds of the air. That which the dogs leave, the birds of the air\r\nshall devour.... Ah, Jokanaan, Jokanaan, thou wert the only man\r\nthat I have loved. All other men are hateful to me. But thou,\r\nthou wert beautiful! Thy body was a column of ivory set on a\r\nsilver socket. It was a garden full of doves and of silver\r\nlilies. It was a tower of silver decked with shields of ivory.\r\nThere was nothing in the world so white as thy body. There was\r\nnothing in the world so black as thy hair. In the whole world\r\nthere was nothing so red as thy mouth. Thy voice was a censer\r\nthat scattered strange perfumes, and when I looked on thee I\r\nheard a strange music. Ah! wherefore didst thou not look at me,\r\nJokanaan? Behind thine hands and thy curses thou didst hide thy\r\nface. Thou didst put upon thine eyes the covering of him who\r\nwould see his God. Well, thou hast seen thy God, Jokanaan, but\r\nme, me, thou didst never see. If thou hadst seen me thou wouldst\r\nhave loved me. I, I saw thee, Jokanaan, and I loved thee. Oh, how\r\nI loved thee! I love thee yet, Jokanaan, I love thee only.... I\r\nam athirst for thy beauty; I am hungry for thy body; and neither\r\nwine nor fruits can appease my desire. What shall I do now,\r\nJokanaan? Neither the floods nor the great waters can quench my\r\npassion. I was a princess, and thou didst scorn me. I was a\r\nvirgin, and thou didst take my virginity from me. I was chaste,\r\nand thou didst fill my veins with fire.... Ah! ah! wherefore\r\ndidst thou not look at me, Jokanaan? If thou hadst looked at me\r\nthou hadst loved me. Well I know that thou wouldst have loved me,\r\nand the mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death.\r\nLove only should one consider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLIMAX]\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\nShe is monstrous, thy daughter, she is altogether monstrous. In\r\ntruth, what she has done is a great crime. I am sure that it was\r\na crime against an unknown God.\r\n\r\nHERODIAS\r\n\r\nI approve of what my daughter has done. And I will stay here now.\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\n[_Rising_].\r\n\r\nAh! There speaks the incestuous wife! Come! I will not stay here.\r\nCome, I tell thee. Surely some terrible thing will befall.\r\nManasseh, Issachar, Ozias, put out the torches. I will not look\r\nat things, I will not suffer things to look at me. Put out the\r\ntorches! Hide the moon! Hide the stars! Let us hide ourselves in\r\nour palace, Herodias. I begin to be afraid.\r\n\r\n[_The slaves put out the torches. The stars disappear. A great\r\nblack cloud crosses the moon and conceals it completely. The\r\nstage becomes very dark. The Tetrarch begins to climb the\r\nstaircase._]\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF SALOME\r\n\r\nAh! I have kissed thy mouth, Jokanaan, I have kissed thy mouth.\r\nThere was a bitter taste on thy lips. Was it the taste of\r\nblood?... But perchance it is the taste of love.... They say that\r\nlove hath a bitter taste.... But what of that? what of that? I\r\nhave kissed thy mouth, Jokanaan.\r\n\r\n[_A moonbeam falls on Salome covering her with light._]\r\n\r\nHEROD\r\n\r\n[_Turning round and seeing Salome_.]\r\n\r\nKill that woman!\r\n\r\n[_The soldiers rush forward and crush beneath their shields\r\nSalome, daughter of Herodias, Princess of Judaea._]\r\n\r\nCURTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUL DE LAMPE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Salome, by Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SALOME ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 42704.txt or 42704.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/2/7/0/42704/\r\n\r\nProduced by Marc D\'Hooghe at http://www.freeliterature.org\r\n(Images generously made available by the Internet Archive.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
