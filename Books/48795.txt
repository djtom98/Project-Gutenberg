Let me call especial attention to the three\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Birds\xe2\x80\x9d borders, at pp. 365, 371, 377. The way, in which he has\r\nmanaged to introduce the most minute details of the stanzas to be\r\nillustrated, seems to me a triumph of artistic ingenuity.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me here express my sincere gratitude to the many Reviewers who have\r\nnoticed, whether favorably or unfavorably, the previous Volume. Their\r\nunfavorable remarks were, most probably, well-deserved; the favorable\r\nones less probably so. Both kinds have no doubt served to make the book\r\nknown, and have helped the reading Public to form their opinions of it.\r\nLet me also here assure them that it is not from any want of respect for\r\ntheir criticisms, that I have carefully forborne from reading _any_ of\r\nthem. I am strongly of opinion that an author had far better _not_ read\r\nany reviews of his books: the unfavorable ones are almost certain to\r\nmake him cross, and the favorable ones conceited; and _neither_ of these\r\nresults is desirable.\r\n\r\nCriticisms have, however, reached me from private sources, to some of\r\nwhich I propose to offer a reply.\r\n\r\nOne such critic complains that Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s strictures, on sermons and on\r\nchoristers, are too severe. Let me say, in reply, that I do _not_ hold\r\nmyself responsible for _any_ of the opinions expressed by the characters\r\nin my book. They are simply opinions which, it seemed to me, might\r\nprobably be held by the persons into whose mouths I put them, and which\r\nwere worth consideration.\r\n\r\nOther critics have objected to certain innovations in spelling, such as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctraveler.\xe2\x80\x9d In reply, I can only plead my firm\r\nconviction that the popular usage is _wrong_. As to \xe2\x80\x9cca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d it will\r\nnot be disputed that, in all _other_ words ending in \xe2\x80\x9cn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d these\r\nletters are an abbreviation of \xe2\x80\x9cnot\xe2\x80\x9d; and it is surely absurd to suppose\r\nthat, in this solitary instance, \xe2\x80\x9cnot\xe2\x80\x9d is represented by \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d! In fact\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d is the _proper_ abbreviation for \xe2\x80\x9ccan it,\xe2\x80\x9d just as \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d is for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis it.\xe2\x80\x9d Again, in \xe2\x80\x9cwo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d the first apostrophe is needed, because the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cwould\xe2\x80\x9d is here _abridged_ into \xe2\x80\x9cwo\xe2\x80\x9d: but I hold it proper to spell\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d with only _one_ apostrophe, because the word \xe2\x80\x9cdo\xe2\x80\x9d is here\r\n_complete_. As to such words as \xe2\x80\x9ctraveler,\xe2\x80\x9d I hold the correct principle\r\nto be, to _double_ the consonant when the accent falls on that syllable;\r\notherwise to leave it _single_. This rule is observed in most cases\r\n(e.g. we double the \xe2\x80\x9cr\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cpreferred,\xe2\x80\x9d but leave it single in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9coffered\xe2\x80\x9d), so that I am only extending, to other cases, an existing\r\nrule. I admit, however, that I do not spell \xe2\x80\x9cparallel,\xe2\x80\x9d as the rule\r\nwould have it; but here we are constrained, by the etymology, to insert\r\nthe double \xe2\x80\x9cl\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to Vol. I. were two puzzles, on which my readers might\r\nexercise their ingenuity. One was, to detect the 3 lines of \xe2\x80\x9cpadding,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich I had found it necessary to supply in the passage extending from\r\nthe top of p. 35 to the middle of p. 38. They are the 14th, 15th, and\r\n16th lines of p. 37. The other puzzle was, to determine which (if any)\r\nof the 8 stanzas of the Gardener\xe2\x80\x99s Song (see pp. 65, 78, 83, 90, 106,\r\n116, 164, 168) were adapted to the context, and which (if any) had the\r\ncontext adapted to them. The last of them is the only one that was\r\nadapted to the context, the \xe2\x80\x9cGarden-Door that opened with a key\xe2\x80\x9d having\r\nbeen substituted for some creature (a Cormorant, I think) \xe2\x80\x9cthat nestled\r\nin a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d At pp. 78, 106, and 164, the context was adapted to the\r\nstanza. At p. 90, neither stanza nor context was altered: the connection\r\nbetween them was simply a piece of good luck.\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to Vol. I., at pp. ix., x., I gave an account of the\r\nmaking-up of the story of \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie and Bruno.\xe2\x80\x9d A few more details may\r\nperhaps be acceptable to my Readers.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1873, as I _now_ believe, that the idea first occurred to me\r\nthat a little fairy-tale (written, in 1867, for \xe2\x80\x9cAunt Judy\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nunder the title \xe2\x80\x9cBruno\xe2\x80\x99s Revenge\xe2\x80\x9d) might serve as the nucleus of a\r\nlonger story. This I surmise, from having found the original draft of\r\nthe last paragraph of Vol. II., dated 1873. So that this paragraph has\r\nbeen waiting 20 years for its chance of emerging into print\xe2\x80\x94more than\r\ntwice the period so cautiously recommended by Horace for \xe2\x80\x98repressing\xe2\x80\x99\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s literary efforts!\r\n\r\nIt was in February, 1885, that I entered into negotiations, with Mr.\r\nHarry Furniss, for illustrating the book. Most of the substance of\r\n_both_ Volumes was then in existence in manuscript: and my original\r\nintention was to publish the _whole_ story at once. In September, 1885,\r\nI received from Mr. Furniss the first set of drawings\xe2\x80\x94the four which\r\nillustrate \xe2\x80\x9cPeter and Paul\xe2\x80\x9d (see I. pp. 144, 147, 150, 154): in\r\nNovember, 1886, I received the second set\xe2\x80\x94the three which illustrate the\r\nProfessor\xe2\x80\x99s song about the \xe2\x80\x9clittle man\xe2\x80\x9d who had \xe2\x80\x9ca little gun\xe2\x80\x9d (Vol. II.\r\npp. 265, 266, 267): and in January, 1887, I received the third set\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfour which illustrate the \xe2\x80\x9cPig-Tale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we went on, illustrating first one bit of the story, and then\r\nanother, without any idea of sequence. And it was not till March, 1889,\r\nthat, having calculated the number of pages the story would occupy, I\r\ndecided on dividing it into _two_ portions, and publishing it half at a\r\ntime. This necessitated the writing of a _sort_ of conclusion for the\r\nfirst Volume: and _most_ of my Readers, I fancy, regarded this as the\r\n_actual_ conclusion, when that Volume appeared in December, 1889. At any\r\nrate, among all the letters I received about it, there was only _one_\r\nwhich expressed _any_ suspicion that it was not a _final_ conclusion.\r\nThis letter was from a child. She wrote \xe2\x80\x9cwe were so glad, when we came\r\nto the end of the book, to find that there was no ending-up, for that\r\nshows us that you are going to write a sequel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may interest some of my Readers to know the _theory_ on which this\r\nstory is constructed. It is an attempt to show what might _possibly_\r\nhappen, supposing that Fairies really existed; and that they were\r\nsometimes visible to us, and we to them; and that they were sometimes\r\nable to assume human form: and supposing, also, that human beings might\r\nsometimes become conscious of what goes on in the Fairy-world\xe2\x80\x94by actual\r\ntransference of their immaterial essence, such as we meet with in\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Esoteric Buddhism.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI have supposed a Human being to be capable of various psychical states,\r\nwith varying degrees of consciousness, as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n(_a_) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of the presence of\r\nFairies;\r\n\r\n(_b_) the \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 state, in which, while conscious of actual\r\nsurroundings, he is _also_ conscious of the presence of Fairies;\r\n\r\n(_c_) a form of trance, in which, while _un_conscious of actual\r\nsurroundings, and apparently asleep, he (i.e. his immaterial essence)\r\nmigrates to other scenes, in the actual world, or in Fairyland, and is\r\nconscious of the presence of Fairies.\r\n\r\nI have also supposed a Fairy to be capable of migrating from Fairyland\r\ninto the actual world, and of assuming, at pleasure, a Human form; and\r\nalso to be capable of various psychical states, viz.\r\n\r\n(_a_) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of the presence of Human\r\nbeings;\r\n\r\n(_b_) a sort of \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 state, in which he is conscious, if in the\r\nactual world, of the presence of actual Human beings; if in Fairyland,\r\nof the presence of the immaterial essences of Human beings.\r\n\r\nI will here tabulate the passages, in both Volumes, where abnormal\r\nstates occur.\r\n\r\n  Historian\xe2\x80\x99s Locality and State.

A few more such\r\ndetails may perhaps interest my Readers:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI. p. 203. The very peculiar use, here made of a dead mouse, comes from\r\nreal life. I once found two very small boys, in a garden, playing a\r\nmicroscopic game of \xe2\x80\x98Single-Wicket.\xe2\x80\x99 The bat was, I think, about the\r\nsize of a table-spoon; and the utmost distance attained by the ball, in\r\nits most daring flights, was some 4 or 5 yards. The _exact_ length was\r\nof course a matter of _supreme_ importance; and it was always carefully\r\nmeasured out (the batsman and the bowler amicably sharing the toil) with\r\na dead mouse!\r\n\r\nI. p. 259. The two quasi-mathematical Axioms, quoted by Arthur at p. 259\r\nof Vol. I., (\xe2\x80\x9cThings that are greater than the same are greater than one\r\nanother,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAll angles are equal\xe2\x80\x9d) were actually enunciated, in all\r\nseriousness, by undergraduates at a University situated not 100 miles\r\nfrom Ely.\r\n\r\nII. p. 10. Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s remark (\xe2\x80\x9cI can, if I like, &c.\xe2\x80\x9d) was actually made by\r\na little boy.\r\n\r\nII. p. 12. So also was his remark (\xe2\x80\x9cI know what it _doesn\xe2\x80\x99t_ spell.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\nAnd his remark (\xe2\x80\x9cI just twiddled my eyes, &c.\xe2\x80\x9d) I heard from the lips of\r\na little girl, who had just solved a puzzle I had set her.\r\n\r\nII. p. 57. Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s soliloquy (\xe2\x80\x9cFor its father, &c.\xe2\x80\x9d) was actually spoken\r\nby a little girl, looking out of the window of a railway-carriage.\r\n\r\nII. p. 138. The remark, made by a guest at the dinner-party, when asking\r\nfor a dish of fruit (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been wishing for them, &c.\xe2\x80\x9d) I heard made by\r\nthe great Poet-Laureate, whose loss the whole reading-world has so\r\nlately had to deplore.\r\n\r\nII. p. 163. Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s speech, on the subject of the age of \xe2\x80\x98Mein Herr,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nembodies the reply of a little girl to the question \xe2\x80\x9cIs your grandmother\r\nan _old_ lady?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if she\xe2\x80\x99s an _old_ lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said this\r\ncautious young person; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s _eighty-three_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nII. p. 203. The speech about \xe2\x80\x98Obstruction\xe2\x80\x99 is no mere creature of my\r\nimagination! It is copied _verbatim_ from the columns of the Standard,\r\nand was spoken by Sir William Harcourt, who was, at the time, a member\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x98Opposition,\xe2\x80\x99 at the \xe2\x80\x98National Liberal Club,\xe2\x80\x99 on July the 16th,\r\n1890.\r\n\r\nII. p. 329. The Professor\xe2\x80\x99s remark, about a dog\xe2\x80\x99s tail, that \xe2\x80\x9cit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbite at _that_ end,\xe2\x80\x9d was actually made by a child, when warned of the\r\ndanger he was incurring by pulling the dog\xe2\x80\x99s tail.\r\n\r\nII. p. 374. The dialogue between Sylvie and Bruno, which occupies lines\r\n6 to 15, is a _verbatim_ report (merely substituting \xe2\x80\x9ccake\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cpenny\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\nof a dialogue overheard between two children.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne story in this Volume\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s Picnic\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I can vouch for as suitable\r\nfor telling to children, having tested it again and again; and, whether\r\nmy audience has been a dozen little girls in a village-school, or some\r\nthirty or forty in a London drawing-room, or a hundred in a High School,\r\nI have always found them earnestly attentive, and keenly appreciative of\r\nsuch fun as the story supplied.\r\n\r\nMay I take this opportunity of calling attention to what I flatter\r\nmyself was a successful piece of name-coining, at p. 42 of Vol. I. Does\r\nnot the name \xe2\x80\x98Sibimet\xe2\x80\x99 fairly embody the character of the Sub-Warden?\r\nThe gentle Reader has no doubt observed what a singularly useless\r\narticle in a house a brazen trumpet is, if you simply leave it lying\r\nabout, and never blow it!\r\n\r\nReaders of the first Volume, who have amused themselves by trying to\r\nsolve the two puzzles propounded at pp. xi., xii. of the Preface, may\r\nperhaps like to exercise their ingenuity in discovering which (if any)\r\nof the following parallelisms were intentional, and which (if any)\r\naccidental.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Birds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Events, and Persons.\r\n  Stanza       1.

Some day, I hope to publish an essay on this subject. At present,\r\nI will content myself with stating the net result I have arrived at.\r\n\r\nIt is, that God has given to Man an absolute right to take the _lives_\r\nof other animals, for _any_ reasonable cause, such as the supply of\r\nfood: but that He has _not_ given to Man the right to inflict _pain_,\r\nunless when _necessary_: that mere pleasure, or advantage, does not\r\nconstitute such a necessity: and, consequently, that pain, inflicted for\r\nthe purposes of _Sport_, is cruel, and therefore wrong. But I find it a\r\nfar more complex question than I had supposed; and that the \xe2\x80\x98case\xe2\x80\x99, on\r\nthe side of the Sportsman, is a much stronger one than I had supposed.\r\nSo, for the present, I say no more about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjections have been raised to the severe language I have put into the\r\nmouth of \xe2\x80\x98Arthur\xe2\x80\x99, at p. 277, on the subject of \xe2\x80\x98Sermons,\xe2\x80\x99 and at pp.\r\n273, 274, on the subjects of Choral Services and \xe2\x80\x98Choristers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI have already protested against the assumption that I am ready to\r\nendorse the opinions of characters in my story. But, in these two\r\ninstances, I admit that I am much in sympathy with \xe2\x80\x98Arthur.\xe2\x80\x99 In my\r\nopinion, far too many sermons are expected from our preachers; and, as a\r\nconsequence, a great many are preached, which are not worth listening\r\nto; and, as a consequence of _that_, we are very apt _not_ to listen.\r\nThe reader of this paragraph probably heard a sermon last Sunday\r\nmorning? Well, let him, if he can, name the text, and state how the\r\npreacher treated it!\r\n\r\nThen, as to \xe2\x80\x98Choristers,\xe2\x80\x99 and all the other accessories\xe2\x80\x94of music,\r\nvestments, processions, &c.,\xe2\x80\x94which have come, along with them, into\r\nfashion\xe2\x80\x94while freely admitting that the \xe2\x80\x98Ritual\xe2\x80\x99 movement was sorely\r\nneeded, and that it has effected a vast improvement in our\r\nChurch-Services, which had become dead and dry to the last degree, I\r\nhold that, like many other desirable movements, it has gone too far in\r\nthe opposite direction, and has introduced many new dangers.\r\n\r\nFor the Congregation this new movement involves the danger of learning\r\nto think that the Services are done _for_ them; and that their bodily\r\n_presence_ is all they need contribute. And, for Clergy and Congregation\r\nalike, it involves the danger of regarding these elaborate Services as\r\n_ends in themselves_, and of forgetting that they are simply _means_,\r\nand the very hollowest of mockeries, unless they bear fruit in our\r\n_lives_.\r\n\r\nFor the Choristers it seems to involve the danger of self-conceit, as\r\ndescribed at p. 274, the danger of regarding those parts of the Service,\r\nwhere their help is not required, as not worth attending to, the danger\r\nof coming to regard the Service as a mere outward form\xe2\x80\x94a series of\r\npostures to be assumed, and of words to be said or sung, while the\r\n_thoughts_ are elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94and the danger of \xe2\x80\x98familiarity\xe2\x80\x99 breeding\r\n\xe2\x80\x98contempt\xe2\x80\x99 for sacred things.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate these last two forms of danger, from my own\r\nexperience. Not long ago, I attended a Cathedral-Service, and was placed\r\nimmediately behind a row of men, members of the Choir; and I could not\r\nhelp noticing that they treated the _Lessons_ as a part of the Service\r\nto which they needed not to give _any_ attention, and as affording them\r\na convenient opportunity for arranging music-books, &c., &c. Also I have\r\nfrequently seen a row of little choristers, after marching in procession\r\nto their places, kneel down, as if about to pray, and rise from their\r\nknees after a minute spent in looking about them, it being but too\r\nevident that the attitude was a mere mockery. Surely it is very\r\ndangerous, for these children, to thus accustom them to _pretend_ to\r\npray? As an instance of irreverent treatment of holy things, I will\r\nmention a custom, which no doubt many of my readers have noticed in\r\nChurches where the Clergy and Choir enter in procession, viz. that, at\r\nthe end of the private devotions, which are carried on in the vestry,\r\nand which are of course inaudible to the Congregation, the final \xe2\x80\x9cAmen\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nis _shouted_, loud enough to be heard all through the Church. This\r\nserves as a signal, to the Congregation, to prepare to rise when the\r\nprocession appears: and it admits of no dispute that it is for this\r\npurpose that it is thus shouted. When we remember to Whom that \xe2\x80\x9cAmen\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\n_really_ addressed, and consider that it is here _used_ for the same\r\npurpose as one of the Church-bells, we must surely admit that it is a\r\npiece of gross irreverence? To _me_ it is much as if I were to see a\r\nBible used as a footstool.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the dangers, for the Clergy themselves, introduced by\r\nthis new movement, let me mention the fact that, according to _my_\r\nexperience, Clergymen of this school are _specially_ apt to retail comic\r\nanecdotes, in which the most sacred names and words\xe2\x80\x94sometimes actual\r\ntexts from the Bible\xe2\x80\x94are used as themes for jesting. Many such things\r\nare repeated as having been originally said by _children_, whose utter\r\nignorance of evil must no doubt acquit _them_, in the sight of God, of\r\nall blame; but it must be otherwise for those who _consciously_ use such\r\ninnocent utterances as material for their unholy mirth.\r\n\r\nLet me add, however, _most_ earnestly, that I fully believe that this\r\nprofanity is, in many cases, _un_conscious: the \xe2\x80\x98environment\xe2\x80\x99 (as I have\r\ntried to explain at p. 123) makes all the difference between man and\r\nman; and I rejoice to think that many of these profane stories\xe2\x80\x94which _I_\r\nfind so painful to listen to, and should feel it a sin to repeat\xe2\x80\x94give to\r\n_their_ ears no pain, and to _their_ consciences no shock; and that\r\n_they_ can utter, not less sincerely than myself, the two prayers,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hallowed be Thy Name_\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c_from hardness of heart, and contempt of\r\nThy Word and Commandment, Good Lord, deliver us!_\xe2\x80\x9d To which I would\r\ndesire to add, for their sake and for my own, Keble\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful\r\npetition, \xe2\x80\x9c_help us, this and every day, To live more nearly as we\r\npray!_\xe2\x80\x9d It is, in fact, for its _consequences_\xe2\x80\x94for the grave dangers,\r\nboth to speaker and to hearer, which it involves\xe2\x80\x94rather than for what it\r\nis _in itself_, that I mourn over this clerical habit of profanity in\r\nsocial talk. To the _believing_ hearer it brings the danger of loss of\r\nreverence for holy things, by the mere act of listening to, and\r\nenjoying, such jests; and also the temptation to retail them for the\r\namusement of others. To the _unbelieving_ hearer it brings a welcome\r\nconfirmation of his theory that religion is a fable, in the spectacle of\r\nits accredited champions thus betraying their trust. And to the speaker\r\nhimself it must surely bring the danger of _loss of faith_. For surely\r\nsuch jests, if uttered with no consciousness of harm, must necessarily\r\nbe also uttered with no consciousness, at the moment, of the _reality_\r\nof God, as a _living being_, who hears all we say. And he, who allows\r\nhimself the habit of thus uttering holy words, with no thought of their\r\nmeaning, is but too likely to find that, for him, God has become a myth,\r\nand heaven a poetic fancy\xe2\x80\x94that, for him, the light of life is gone, and\r\nthat he is at heart an atheist, lost in \xe2\x80\x9c_a darkness that may be felt_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is, I fear, at the present time, an increasing tendency to\r\nirreverent treatment of the name of God and of subjects connected with\r\nreligion. Some of our theatres are helping this downward movement by the\r\ngross caricatures of clergymen which they put upon the stage: some of\r\nour clergy are themselves helping it, by showing that they can lay aside\r\nthe spirit of reverence, along with their surplices, and can treat as\r\njests, when _outside_ their churches, names and things to which they pay\r\nan almost superstitious veneration when _inside_: the \xe2\x80\x9cSalvation Army\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhas, I fear, with the best intentions, done much to help it, by the\r\ncoarse familiarity with which they treat holy things: and surely every\r\none, who desires to _live_ in the spirit of the prayer \xe2\x80\x9c_Hallowed be thy\r\nName_,\xe2\x80\x9d ought to do what he can, however little that may be, to check\r\nit. So I have gladly taken this unique opportunity, however unfit the\r\ntopic may seem for the Preface to a book of this kind, to express some\r\nthoughts which have weighed on my mind for a long time. I did not\r\nexpect, when I wrote the Preface to Vol. I, that it would be read to any\r\nappreciable extent: but I rejoice to believe, from evidence that has\r\nreached me, that it _has_ been read by many, and to hope that this\r\nPreface will also be so: and I think that, among them, some will be\r\nfound ready to sympathise with the views I have put forwards, and ready\r\nto help, with their prayers and their example, the revival, in Society,\r\nof the waning spirit of reverence.\r\n\r\n                                                      _Christmas_, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                            PAGE\r\n  I.

Eric\r\nLindon was lounging, with rather a \xe2\x80\x98bored\xe2\x80\x99 expression of face, over a\r\nnewspaper; and we fell into conversation with a mutual satisfaction\r\nwhich neither of us tried to conceal.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I ventured to introduce what was just then the main\r\nsubject of my thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so the Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d (a name we had adopted by a\r\ntacit agreement, as a convenient compromise between the formality of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doctor Forester\xe2\x80\x99 and the intimacy\xe2\x80\x94to which Eric Lindon hardly seemed\r\nentitled\xe2\x80\x94of \xe2\x80\x98Arthur\xe2\x80\x99) \xe2\x80\x9chas gone abroad by this time, I suppose? Can you\r\ngive me his present address?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is still at Elveston\xe2\x80\x94I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have not been\r\nthere since I last met you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not know which part of this intelligence to wonder at most. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nmight I ask\xe2\x80\x94if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t taking too much of a liberty\xe2\x80\x94when your\r\nwedding-bells are to\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps they _have_ rung, already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eric, in a steady voice, which betrayed scarcely a trace of\r\nemotion: \xe2\x80\x9c_that_ engagement is at an end. I am still \xe2\x80\x98Benedick the\r\n_un_married man.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this, the thick-coming fancies\xe2\x80\x94all radiant with new possibilities\r\nof happiness for Arthur\xe2\x80\x94were far too bewildering to admit of any further\r\nconversation, and I was only too glad to avail myself of the first\r\ndecent excuse, that offered itself, for retiring into silence.\r\n\r\nThe next day I wrote to Arthur, with as much of a reprimand for his long\r\nsilence as I could bring myself to put into words, begging him to tell\r\nme how the world went with him.\r\n\r\nNeeds must that three or four days\xe2\x80\x94possibly more\xe2\x80\x94should elapse before I\r\ncould receive his reply; and never had I known days drag their slow\r\nlength along with a more tedious indolence.\r\n\r\nTo while away the time, I strolled, one afternoon, into Kensington\r\nGardens, and, wandering aimlessly along any path that presented itself,\r\nI soon became aware that I had somehow strayed into one that was wholly\r\nnew to me. Still, my elfish experiences seemed to have so completely\r\nfaded out of my life that nothing was further from my thoughts than the\r\nidea of again meeting my fairy-friends, when I chanced to notice a small\r\ncreature, moving among the grass that fringed the path, that did not\r\nseem to be an insect, or a frog, or any other living thing that I could\r\nthink of. Cautiously kneeling down, and making an _ex tempore_ cage of\r\nmy two hands, I imprisoned the little wanderer, and felt a sudden thrill\r\nof surprise and delight on discovering that my prisoner was no other\r\nthan _Bruno_ himself!\r\n\r\nBruno took the matter _very_ coolly, and, when I had replaced him on the\r\nground, where he would be within easy conversational distance, he began\r\ntalking, just as if it were only a few minutes since last we had met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoos oo know what the _Rule_ is,\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen oo catches a\r\nFairy, withouten its having tolded oo where it was?\xe2\x80\x9d (Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s notions of\r\nEnglish Grammar had certainly _not_ improved since our last meeting.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there was any Rule about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _think_ oo\xe2\x80\x99ve got a right to _eat_ me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little fellow,\r\nlooking up into my face with a winning smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not pruffickly\r\nsure. Oo\xe2\x80\x99d better not do it wizout asking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt did indeed seem reasonable not to take so irrevocable a step as\r\n_that_, without due enquiry. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly _ask_ about it, first,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet whether you would be _worth_ eating!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess I\xe2\x80\x99m _deliciously_ good to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno remarked in a satisfied\r\ntone, as if it were something to be rather proud of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are you doing here, Bruno?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That\xe2\x80\x99s_ not my name!\xe2\x80\x9d said my cunning little friend. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t oo know my\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Oh Bruno!\xe2\x80\x99? That\xe2\x80\x99s what Sylvie always calls me, when I says mine\r\nlessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, what are you doing here, oh Bruno?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoing mine lessons, a-course!\xe2\x80\x9d With that roguish twinkle in his eye,\r\nthat always came when he knew he was talking nonsense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ the way you do your lessons, is it? And do you remember\r\nthem well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways can \xe2\x80\x99member _mine_ lessons,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\nlessons that\xe2\x80\x99s so _dreffully_ hard to \xe2\x80\x99member!\xe2\x80\x9d He frowned, as if in\r\nagonies of thought, and tapped his forehead with his knuckles. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n_ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ think enough to understand them!\xe2\x80\x9d he said despairingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwants _double_ thinking, I believe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where\xe2\x80\x99s Sylvie gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what _I_ want to know!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno disconsolately. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\never\xe2\x80\x99s the good of setting me lessons, when she isn\xe2\x80\x99t here to \xe2\x80\x99splain\r\nthe hard bits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ find her for you!\xe2\x80\x9d I volunteered; and, getting up, I wandered\r\nround the tree under whose shade I had been reclining, looking on all\r\nsides for Sylvie. In another minute I _again_ noticed some strange thing\r\nmoving among the grass, and, kneeling down, was immediately confronted\r\nwith Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s innocent face, lighted up with a joyful surprise at seeing\r\nme, and was accosted, in the sweet voice I knew so well, with what\r\nseemed to be the _end_ of a sentence whose beginning I had failed to\r\ncatch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and I think he ought to have _finished_ them by this time. So I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing back to him. Will you come too? It\xe2\x80\x99s only just round at the other\r\nside of this tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was but a few steps for _me_; but it was a great many for Sylvie; and\r\nI had to be very careful to walk slowly, in order not to leave the\r\nlittle creature so far behind as to lose sight of her.\r\n\r\nTo find Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s _lessons_ was easy enough: they appeared to be neatly\r\nwritten out on large smooth ivy-leaves, which were scattered in some\r\nconfusion over a little patch of ground where the grass had been worn\r\naway; but the pale student, who ought by rights to have been bending\r\nover them, was nowhere to be seen: we looked in all directions, for some\r\ntime, in vain; but at last Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s sharp eyes detected him, swinging on\r\na tendril of ivy, and Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s stern voice commanded his instant return\r\nto _terra firma_ and to the business of Life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SYLVIE\xe2\x80\x99S TRUANT-PUPIL]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleasure first and business afterwards\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to be the motto of these\r\ntiny folk, so many hugs and kisses had to be interchanged before\r\nanything else could be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Bruno,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said reproachfully, \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you you were to\r\ngo on with your lessons, unless you heard to the contrary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I _did_ heard to the contrary!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno insisted, with a mischievous\r\ntwinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ did you hear, you wicked boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were a sort of noise in the air,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno: \xe2\x80\x9ca sort of a\r\nscrambling noise.

You know you _can_, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse I can, if I _like_,\xe2\x80\x9d the pale student replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t if\r\nI _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie had a way\xe2\x80\x94which I could not too highly admire\xe2\x80\x94of evading Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlogical perplexities by suddenly striking into a new line of thought;\r\nand this masterly stratagem she now adopted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must say _one_ thing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid oo know, Mister Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno thoughtfully remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Sylvie\r\nca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t count? Whenever she says \xe2\x80\x98I must say _one_ thing,\xe2\x80\x99 I _know_ quite\r\nwell she\xe2\x80\x99ll say _two_ things! And she always doos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo heads are better than one, Bruno,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, but with no very\r\ndistinct idea as to what I meant by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind having two _heads_,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said softly to himself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cone head to eat mine dinner, and one head to argue wiz Sylvie\xe2\x80\x94doos oo\r\nthink oo\xe2\x80\x99d look prettier if oo\xe2\x80\x99d got _two_ heads, Mister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe case did not, I assured him, admit of a doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason why Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s so cross\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno went on very seriously,\r\nalmost sadly.\r\n\r\nSylvie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes grew large and round with surprise at this new line of\r\nenquiry\xe2\x80\x94her rosy face being perfectly radiant with good humour. But she\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better to tell me after the lessons are over?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said with a resigned air: \xe2\x80\x9conly she wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be cross\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only three lessons to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cSpelling, and\r\nGeography, and Singing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _Arithmetic_?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a head for Arithmetic\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse I haven\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cMine head\xe2\x80\x99s for _hair_. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a\r\n_lot_ of heads!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and he ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t learn his Multiplication-table\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like _History_ ever so much better,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cOo has to\r\n_repeat_ that Muddlecome table\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and you have to repeat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, oo hasn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cHistory repeats itself. The\r\nProfessor said so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie was arranging some letters on a board\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94E\xe2\x80\x94V\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94L. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Bruno,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does _that_ spell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno looked at it, in solemn silence, for a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cI knows what it\r\n_doosn\xe2\x80\x99t_ spell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _does_ it spell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno took another look at the mysterious letters. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98LIVE,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbackwards!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. (I thought it was, indeed.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _did_ you manage to see that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just twiddled my eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, \xe2\x80\x9cand then I saw it directly. Now\r\nmay I sing the King-fisher Song?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeography next,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know the Rules?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thinks there oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be such a lot of Rules, Sylvie! I thinks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there _ought_ to be such a lot of Rules, you wicked, wicked boy!\r\nAnd how dare you _think_ at all about it? And shut up that mouth\r\ndirectly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, as \xe2\x80\x98that mouth\xe2\x80\x99 didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem inclined to shut up of itself, Sylvie\r\nshut it for him\xe2\x80\x94with both hands\xe2\x80\x94and sealed it with a kiss, just as you\r\nwould fasten up a letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that Bruno is fastened up from talking,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, turning to\r\nme, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the Map he does his lessons on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd there it was, a large Map of the World, spread out on the ground. It\r\nwas so large that Bruno had to crawl about on it, to point out the\r\nplaces named in the \xe2\x80\x98King-fisher Lesson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a King-fisher sees a Lady-bird flying away, he says \xe2\x80\x98_Ceylon_, if\r\nyou _Candia_!\xe2\x80\x99 And when he catches it, he says \xe2\x80\x98Come to _Media_! And if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re _Hungary_ or thirsty, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some _Nubia_!\xe2\x80\x99 When he takes\r\nit in his claws, he says \xe2\x80\x98_Europe!_\xe2\x80\x99 When he puts it into his beak, he\r\nsays \xe2\x80\x98_India!_\xe2\x80\x99 When he\xe2\x80\x99s swallowed it, he says \xe2\x80\x98_Eton!_\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s _quite_ perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you may sing the King-fisher\r\nSong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill _oo_ sing the chorus?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said to me.\r\n\r\nI was just beginning to say \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the _words_,\xe2\x80\x9d when\r\nSylvie silently turned the map over, and I found the words were all\r\nwritten on the back. In one respect it was a _very_ peculiar song: the\r\nchorus to each verse came in the _middle_, instead of at the _end_ of\r\nit. However, the tune was so easy that I soon picked it up, and managed\r\nthe chorus as well, perhaps, as it is possible for _one_ person to\r\nmanage such a thing. It was in vain that I signed to Sylvie to help me:\r\nshe only smiled sweetly and shook her head.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cKing Fisher courted Lady Bird\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  _Sing Beans, sing Bones, sing Butterflies!_\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Find me my match,\xe2\x80\x99 he said,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98With such a noble head\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  With such a beard, as white as curd\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    With such expressive eyes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yet pins have heads,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady Bird\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  _Sing Prunes, sing Prawns, sing Primrose-Hill!_\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98And, where you stick them in,\r\n    They stay, and thus a pin\r\n  Is very much to be preferred\r\n    To one that\xe2\x80\x99s never still!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oysters have beards,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady Bird\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  _Sing Flies, sing Frogs, sing Fiddle-strings!_\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98I love them, for I know\r\n    _They_ never chatter so:\r\n  They would not say one single word\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Not if you crowned them Kings!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Needles have eyes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady Bird\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  _Sing Cats, sing Corks, sing Cowslip-tea!_\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98And they are sharp\xe2\x80\x94just what\r\n      Your Majesty is _not:_\r\n  So get you gone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis too absurd\r\n      To come a-courting _me_!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING FISHER\xe2\x80\x99S WOOING]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he went away,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno added as a kind of postscript, when the last\r\nnote of the song had died away. \xe2\x80\x9cJust like he always did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my _dear_ Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie exclaimed, with her hands over her ears.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99: you should say \xe2\x80\x98_what_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Bruno replied, doggedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI only says \xe2\x80\x98what!\xe2\x80\x99 when oo doosn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak loud, so as I can hear oo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did he go to?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, hoping to prevent an argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went more far than he\xe2\x80\x99d never been before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should never say \xe2\x80\x98more far,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie corrected him: \xe2\x80\x9cyou should say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_farther_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _oo_ shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98more broth,\xe2\x80\x99 when we\xe2\x80\x99re at dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno\r\nretorted: \xe2\x80\x9coo should say \xe2\x80\x98_brother_\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Sylvie evaded an argument by turning away, and beginning to\r\nroll up the Map. \xe2\x80\x9cLessons are over!\xe2\x80\x9d she proclaimed in her sweetest\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd has there been no _crying_ over them?\xe2\x80\x9d I enquired. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle boys\r\n_always_ cry over their lessons, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never cries after twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99cause then it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting so near to dinner-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said in a low voice; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGeography-day, and when he\xe2\x80\x99s been disobe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ a fellow you are to talk, Sylvie!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno hastily interposed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoos oo think the world was _made_ for oo to talk in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where would you _have_ me talk, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, evidently\r\nquite ready for an argument.\r\n\r\nBut Bruno answered resolutely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to argue about it, \xe2\x80\x99cause\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s getting late, and there wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be time\xe2\x80\x94but oo\xe2\x80\x99s as \xe2\x80\x99ong as ever oo\r\ncan be!\xe2\x80\x9d And he rubbed the back of his hand across his eyes, in which\r\ntears were beginning to glitter.\r\n\r\n_Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s_ eyes filled with tears in a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it, Bruno,\r\n_darling_!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered; and the rest of the argument was lost \xe2\x80\x98amid\r\nthe tangles of Ne\xc3\xa6ra\xe2\x80\x99s hair,\xe2\x80\x99 while the two disputants hugged and kissed\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nBut this new form of argument was brought to a sudden end by a flash of\r\nlightning, which was closely followed by a peal of thunder, and by a\r\ntorrent of rain-drops, which came hissing and spitting, almost like live\r\ncreatures, through the leaves of the tree that sheltered us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s raining cats and dogs!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all the _dogs_ has come down _first_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno: \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nbut _cats_ coming down now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn another minute the pattering ceased, as suddenly as it had begun. I\r\nstepped out from under the tree, and found that the storm was over; but\r\nI looked in vain, on my return, for my tiny companions. They had\r\nvanished with the storm, and there was nothing for it but to make the\r\nbest of my way home.\r\n\r\nOn the table lay, awaiting my return, an envelope of that peculiar\r\nyellow tint which always announces a telegram, and which must be, in the\r\nmemories of so many of us, inseparably linked with some great and sudden\r\nsorrow\xe2\x80\x94something that has cast a shadow, never in this world to be\r\nwholly lifted off, on the brightness of Life. No doubt it has _also_\r\nheralded\xe2\x80\x94for many of us\xe2\x80\x94some sudden news of joy; but this, I think, is\r\nless common: human life seems, on the whole, to contain more of sorrow\r\nthan of joy. And yet the world goes on. Who knows why?\r\n\r\nThis time, however, there was no shock of sorrow to be faced: in fact,\r\nthe few words it contained (\xe2\x80\x9cCould not bring myself to write. Come soon.\r\nAlways welcome. A letter follows this. Arthur.\xe2\x80\x9d) seemed so like Arthur\r\nhimself speaking, that it gave me quite a thrill of pleasure, and I at\r\nonce began the preparations needed for the journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                             LOVE\xe2\x80\x99S CURFEW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFayfield Junction! Change for Elveston!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat subtle memory could there be, linked to these commonplace words,\r\nthat caused such a flood of happy thoughts to fill my brain? I\r\ndismounted from the carriage in a state of joyful excitement for which I\r\ncould not at first account. True, I had taken this very journey, and at\r\nthe same hour of the day, six months ago; but many things had happened\r\nsince then, and an old man\xe2\x80\x99s memory has but a slender hold on recent\r\nevents: I sought \xe2\x80\x98the missing link\xe2\x80\x99 in vain. Suddenly I caught sight of\r\na bench\xe2\x80\x94the only one provided on the cheerless platform\xe2\x80\x94with a lady\r\nseated on it, and the whole forgotten scene flashed upon me as vividly\r\nas if it were happening over again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThis bare platform is, for me, rich with the memory\r\nof a dear friend! She was sitting on that very bench, and invited me to\r\nshare it, with some quotation from Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x94I forget what. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try\r\nthe Earl\xe2\x80\x99s plan for the Dramatisation of Life, and fancy that figure to\r\nbe Lady Muriel; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t undeceive myself too soon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I strolled along the platform, resolutely \xe2\x80\x98making-believe\xe2\x80\x99 (as\r\nchildren say) that the casual passenger, seated on that bench, was the\r\nLady Muriel I remembered so well. She was facing away from me, which\r\naided the elaborate cheatery I was practising on myself: but, though I\r\nwas careful, in passing the spot, to look the other way, in order to\r\nprolong the pleasant illusion, it was inevitable that, when I turned to\r\nwalk back again, I should see who it was. It was Lady Muriel herself!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98SPEND IT ALL FOR MINNIE\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\nThe whole scene now returned vividly to my memory; and, to make this\r\nrepetition of it stranger still, there was the same old man, whom I\r\nremembered seeing so roughly ordered off, by the Station-Master, to make\r\nroom for his titled passenger. The same, but \xe2\x80\x98with a difference\xe2\x80\x99: no\r\nlonger tottering feebly along the platform, but actually seated at Lady\r\nMuriel\xe2\x80\x99s side, and in conversation with her! \xe2\x80\x9cYes, put it in your\r\npurse,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cand remember you\xe2\x80\x99re to spend it all for\r\n_Minnie_. And mind you bring her something nice, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do her real\r\ngood! And give her my love!\xe2\x80\x9d So intent was she on saying these words,\r\nthat, although the sound of my footstep had made her lift her head and\r\nlook at me, she did not at first recognise me.\r\n\r\nI raised my hat as I approached, and then there flashed across her face\r\na genuine look of joy, which so exactly recalled the sweet face of\r\nSylvie, when last we met in Kensington Gardens, that I felt quite\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\nRather than disturb the poor old man at her side, she rose from her\r\nseat, and joined me in my walk up and down the platform, and for a\r\nminute or two our conversation was as utterly trivial and commonplace as\r\nif we were merely two casual guests in a London drawing-room. Each of us\r\nseemed to shrink, just at first, from touching on the deeper interests\r\nwhich linked our lives together.\r\n\r\nThe Elveston train had drawn up at the platform, while we talked; and,\r\nin obedience to the Station-Master\xe2\x80\x99s obsequious hint of \xe2\x80\x9cThis way, my\r\nLady! Time\xe2\x80\x99s up!\xe2\x80\x9d, we were making the best of our way towards the end\r\nwhich contained the sole first-class carriage, and were just passing the\r\nnow-empty bench, when Lady Muriel noticed, lying on it, the purse in\r\nwhich her gift had just been so carefully bestowed, the owner of which,\r\nall unconscious of his loss, was being helped into a carriage at the\r\nother end of the train. She pounced on it instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor old man!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cHe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go off, and think he\xe2\x80\x99s lost it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet _me_ run with it! I can go quicker than you!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. But she was\r\nalready half-way down the platform, flying (\xe2\x80\x98running\xe2\x80\x99 is much too\r\nmundane a word for such fairy-like motion) at a pace that left all\r\npossible efforts of _mine_ hopelessly in the rear.\r\n\r\nShe was back again before I had well completed my audacious boast of\r\nspeed in running, and was saying, quite demurely, as we entered our\r\ncarriage, \xe2\x80\x9cand you really think _you_ could have done it quicker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI plead \xe2\x80\x98Guilty\xe2\x80\x99 of gross exaggeration, and\r\nthrow myself on the mercy of the Court!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court will overlook it\xe2\x80\x94for this once!\xe2\x80\x9d Then her manner suddenly\r\nchanged from playfulness to an anxious gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not looking your best!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with an anxious glance. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nfact, I think you look _more_ of an invalid than when you left us. I\r\nvery much doubt if London agrees with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _may_ be the London air,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cor it may be the hard work\xe2\x80\x94or my\r\nrather lonely life: anyhow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve _not_ been feeling very well, lately.\r\nBut Elveston will soon set me up again. Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s prescription\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\ndoctor, you know, and I heard from him this morning\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x98plenty of ozone,\r\nand new milk, and _pleasant society_\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleasant society?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel, with a pretty make-believe of\r\nconsidering the question. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, really I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where we can find\r\n_that_ for you! We have so few neighbours. But new milk we _can_ manage.\r\nDo get it of my old friend Mrs. Hunter, up there, on the hill-side. You\r\nmay rely upon the _quality_. And her little Bessie comes to school every\r\nday, and passes your lodgings. So it would be very easy to send it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll follow your advice, with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and\r\narrange about it tomorrow. I know Arthur will want a walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find it quite an easy walk\xe2\x80\x94under three miles, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve settled that point, let me retort your own remark\r\nupon yourself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think _you\xe2\x80\x99re_ looking quite your best!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay not,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied in a low voice; and a sudden shadow seemed\r\nto overspread her face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had some troubles lately. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter\r\nabout which I\xe2\x80\x99ve been long wishing to consult you, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t easily\r\nwrite about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m _so_ glad to have this opportunity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d she began again, after a minute\xe2\x80\x99s silence, and with a\r\nvisible embarrassment of manner most unusual in her, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a promise,\r\ndeliberately and solemnly given, is _always_ binding\xe2\x80\x94except, of course,\r\nwhere its fulfilment would involve some actual _sin_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t think of any other exception at this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nbranch of casuistry is usually, I believe, treated as a question of\r\ntruth and untruth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely that _is_ the principle?\xe2\x80\x9d she eagerly interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cI always\r\nthought the Bible-teaching about it consisted of such texts as \xe2\x80\x98_lie not\r\none to another_\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought about that point,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand it seems to me that\r\nthe essence of _lying_ is the intention of _deceiving_. If you give a\r\npromise, fully _intending_ to fulfil it, you are certainly acting\r\ntruthfully _then_; and, if you afterwards break it, that does not\r\ninvolve any _deception_. I cannot call it _untruthful_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother pause of silence ensued. Lady Muriel\xe2\x80\x99s face was hard to read:\r\nshe looked pleased, I thought, but also puzzled; and I felt curious to\r\nknow whether her question had, as I began to suspect, some bearing on\r\nthe breaking off of her engagement with Captain (now Major) Lindon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have relieved me from a great fear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the thing is of\r\ncourse _wrong_, somehow. What texts would _you_ quote, to prove it\r\nwrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny that enforce the payment of _debts_. If _A_ promises something to\r\n_B_, _B_ has a claim upon _A_. And _A_\xe2\x80\x99s sin, if he breaks his promise,\r\nseems to me more analogous to _stealing_ than to _lying_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a new way of looking at it\xe2\x80\x94to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems a\r\n_true_ way, also. However, I won\xe2\x80\x99t deal in generalities, with an old\r\nfriend like you! For we _are_ old friends, somehow. Do you know, I think\r\nwe _began_ as old friends?\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a playfulness of tone that ill\r\naccorded with the tears that glistened in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much for saying so,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI like to think of you\r\nas an _old_ friend,\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94though you don\xe2\x80\x99t look it!\xe2\x80\x9d would have been the\r\nalmost necessary sequence, with any other lady; but she and I seemed to\r\nhave long passed out of the time when compliments, or any such\r\ntrivialities, were possible.)\r\n\r\nHere the train paused at a station, where two or three passengers\r\nentered the carriage; so no more was said till we had reached our\r\njourney\xe2\x80\x99s end.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Elveston, she readily adopted my suggestion that we\r\nshould walk up together; so, as soon as our luggage had been duly taken\r\ncharge of\xe2\x80\x94hers by the servant who met her at the station, and mine by\r\none of the porters\xe2\x80\x94we set out together along the familiar lanes, now\r\nlinked in my memory with so many delightful associations. Lady Muriel at\r\nonce recommenced the conversation at the point where it had been\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew of my engagement to my cousin Eric. Did you also hear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted, anxious to spare her the pain of giving any\r\ndetails. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard it had all come to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to tell you how it happened,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cas that is the\r\nvery point I want your advice about. I had long realised that we were\r\nnot in sympathy in religious belief. His ideas of Christianity are very\r\nshadowy; and even as to the existence of a God he lives in a sort of\r\ndreamland. But it has not affected his life! I feel sure, now, that the\r\nmost absolute Atheist _may_ be leading, though walking blindfold, a pure\r\nand noble life. And if you knew half the good deeds\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she broke off\r\nsuddenly, and turned away her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entirely agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd have we not our Saviour\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\npromise that such a life shall surely lead to the light?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a broken voice, still keeping her head\r\nturned away. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I told him. He said he would believe, for _my_\r\nsake, if he could. And he wished, for _my_ sake, he could see things as\r\nI did. But that is all wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cGod _cannot_\r\napprove such low motives as that! Still it was not _I_ that broke it\r\noff. I knew he loved me; and I had _promised_; and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it was _he_ that broke it off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe released me unconditionally.\xe2\x80\x9d She faced me again now, having quite\r\nrecovered her usual calmness of manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what difficulty remains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is _this_, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he did it of his own free will. Now,\r\nsupposing he did it _against_ his will, merely to satisfy my scruples,\r\nwould not his claim on me remain just as strong as ever? And would not\r\nmy promise be as binding as ever? My father says \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99; but I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nfearing he is biased by his love for me. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked no one else. I\r\nhave many friends\xe2\x80\x94friends for the bright sunny weather; not friends for\r\nthe clouds and storms of life; not _old_ friends like you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me think a little,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: and for some minutes we walked on in\r\nsilence, while, pained to the heart at seeing the bitter trial that had\r\ncome upon this pure and gentle soul, I strove in vain to see my way\r\nthrough the tangled skein of conflicting motives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she loves him truly,\xe2\x80\x9d (I seemed at last to grasp the clue to the\r\nproblem) \xe2\x80\x9cis not _that_, for her, the voice of God? May she not hope\r\nthat she is sent to him, even as Ananias was sent to Saul in his\r\nblindness, that he may receive his sight?\xe2\x80\x9d Once more I seemed to hear\r\nArthur whispering \xe2\x80\x9c_What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save\r\nthy husband?_\xe2\x80\x9d and I broke the silence with the words \xe2\x80\x9cIf you still love\r\nhim truly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do _not_!\xe2\x80\x9d she hastily interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least\xe2\x80\x94not in _that_ way. I\r\n_believe_ I loved him when I promised; but I was very young: it is hard\r\nto know. But, whatever the feeling was, it is dead _now_. The motive on\r\n_his_ side is Love: on _mine_ it is\xe2\x80\x94Duty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there was a long silence. The whole skein of thought was tangled\r\nworse than ever. This time _she_ broke the silence. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I said my heart was not _his_, I did not mean it\r\nwas any one else\xe2\x80\x99s! At present I feel bound to _him_; and, till I know I\r\nam absolutely free, in the sight of God, to love any other than him,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never even _think_ of any one else\xe2\x80\x94in _that_ way, I mean. I would\r\ndie sooner!\xe2\x80\x9d I had never imagined my gentle friend capable of such\r\npassionate utterances.\r\n\r\nI ventured on no further remark until we had nearly arrived at the\r\nHall-gate; but, the longer I reflected, the clearer it became to me that\r\nno call of Duty demanded the sacrifice\xe2\x80\x94possibly of the happiness of a\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94which she seemed ready to make. I tried to make this clear to _her_\r\nalso, adding some warnings on the dangers that surely awaited a union in\r\nwhich mutual love was wanting. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only argument for it, worth\r\nconsidering,\xe2\x80\x9d I said in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x9cseems to be his supposed\r\n_reluctance_ in releasing you from your promise. I have tried to give to\r\nthat argument its _full_ weight, and my conclusion is that it does _not_\r\naffect the rights of the case, or invalidate the release he has given\r\nyou. My belief is that you are _entirely_ free to act as _now_ seems\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am _very_ grateful to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve it, please!\r\nI ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t put it into proper words!\xe2\x80\x9d and the subject was dropped by\r\nmutual consent: and I only learned, long afterwards, that our discussion\r\nhad really served to dispel the doubts that had harassed her so long.\r\n\r\nWe parted at the Hall-gate, and I found Arthur eagerly awaiting my\r\narrival; and, before we parted for the night, I had heard the whole\r\nstory\xe2\x80\x94how he had put off his journey from day to day, feeling that he\r\n_could_ not go away from the place till his fate had been irrevocably\r\nsettled by the wedding taking place: how the preparations for the\r\nwedding, and the excitement in the neighbourhood, had suddenly come to\r\nan end, and he had learned (from Major Lindon, who called to wish him\r\ngood-bye) that the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent: how\r\nhe had instantly abandoned all his plans for going abroad, and had\r\ndecided to stay on at Elveston, for a year or two at any rate, till his\r\nnewly-awakened hopes should prove true or false; and how, since that\r\nmemorable day, he had avoided all meetings with Lady Muriel, fearing to\r\nbetray his feelings before he had had any sufficient evidence as to how\r\nshe regarded him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is nearly six weeks since all that happened,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x9cand we can meet in the ordinary way, now, with\r\nno need for any painful allusions. I would have written to tell you all\r\nthis: only I kept hoping from day to day, that\xe2\x80\x94that there would be\r\n_more_ to tell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how should there be _more_, you foolish fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d I fondly urged,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you never even go near her? Do you expect the offer to come from\r\n_her_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur was betrayed into a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly expect\r\n_that_. But I\xe2\x80\x99m a desperate coward. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what _reasons_ have you heard of for breaking off the engagement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good many,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur replied, and proceeded to count them on his\r\nfingers. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, it was found that she was dying of\xe2\x80\x94something; so _he_\r\nbroke it off. Then it was found that _he_ was dying of\xe2\x80\x94some other thing;\r\nso _she_ broke it off. Then the Major turned out to be a confirmed\r\ngamester; so the _Earl_ broke it off. Then the Earl insulted him; so the\r\n_Major_ broke it off. It got a good deal broken off, all things\r\nconsidered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have all this on the very best authority, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly! And communicated in the strictest confidence! Whatever\r\ndefects Elveston society suffers from, _want of information_ isn\xe2\x80\x99t one\r\nof them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor _reticence_, either, it seems. But, seriously, do you know the real\r\nreason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not feel that I had any right to enlighten him; so I changed the\r\nsubject, to the less engrossing one of \xe2\x80\x9cnew milk,\xe2\x80\x9d and we agreed that I\r\nshould walk over, next day, to Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s farm, Arthur undertaking to set\r\nme part of the way, after which he had to return to keep a\r\nbusiness-engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                            STREAKS OF DAWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day proved warm and sunny, and we started early, to enjoy the\r\nluxury of a good long chat before he would be obliged to leave me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis neighbourhood has more than its due proportion of the _very_\r\npoor,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, as we passed a group of hovels, too dilapidated to\r\ndeserve the name of \xe2\x80\x9ccottages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the few rich,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur replied, \xe2\x80\x9cgive more than their due proportion\r\nof help in charity. So the balance is kept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the _Earl_ does a good deal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _gives_ liberally; but he has not the health or strength to do more.\r\nLady Muriel does more in the way of school-teaching and cottage-visiting\r\nthan she would like me to reveal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _she_, at least, is not one of the \xe2\x80\x98idle mouths\xe2\x80\x99 one so often\r\nmeets with among the upper classes. I have sometimes thought they would\r\nhave a hard time of it, if suddenly called on to give their _raison\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre_, and to show cause why they should be allowed to live any\r\nlonger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cof what we may call \xe2\x80\x98idle mouths\xe2\x80\x99 (I\r\nmean persons who absorb some of the material _wealth_ of a community\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe form of food, clothes, and so on\xe2\x80\x94without contributing its equivalent\r\nin the form of productive _labour_) is a complicated one, no doubt. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntried to think it out. And it seemed to me that the simplest form of the\r\nproblem, to start with, is a community without _money_, who buy and sell\r\nby _barter_ only; and it makes it yet simpler to suppose the food and\r\nother things to be capable of _keeping_ for many years without\r\nspoiling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours is an excellent plan,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your solution of the\r\nproblem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe commonest type of \xe2\x80\x98idle mouths,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cis no doubt due to\r\nmoney being left by parents to their own children. So I imagined a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94either exceptionally clever, or exceptionally strong and\r\nindustrious\xe2\x80\x94who had contributed so much valuable labour to the needs of\r\nthe community that its equivalent, in clothes, &c., was (say) five times\r\nas much as he needed for himself. We cannot deny his _absolute_ right to\r\ngive the superfluous wealth as he chooses. So, if he leaves _four_\r\nchildren behind him (say two sons and two daughters), with enough of all\r\nthe necessaries of life to last them a life-time, I cannot see that the\r\n_community_ is in any way wronged if they choose to do nothing in life\r\nbut to \xe2\x80\x98eat, drink, and be merry.\xe2\x80\x99 Most certainly, the community could\r\nnot fairly say, in reference to _them_, \xe2\x80\x98_if a man will not work,\r\nneither let him eat_.\xe2\x80\x99 Their reply would be crushing. \xe2\x80\x98The labour has\r\nalready been _done_, which is a fair equivalent for the food we are\r\neating; and you have had the benefit of it. On what principle of justice\r\ncan you demand _two_ quotas of work for _one_ quota of food?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet surely,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something wrong _somewhere_, if these\r\nfour people are well able to do useful work, and if that work is\r\nactually _needed_ by the community, and they elect to sit idle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think there _is_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur: \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems to me to arise from a\r\nLaw of God\xe2\x80\x94that every one shall do as much as he can to help others\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnot from any _rights_, on the part of the community, to exact labour as\r\nan equivalent for food that has already been fairly earned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the _second_ form of the problem is where the \xe2\x80\x98idle mouths\xe2\x80\x99\r\npossess _money_ instead of _material_ wealth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Arthur: \xe2\x80\x9cand I think the simplest case is that of\r\n_paper_-money. _Gold_ is itself a form of material wealth; but a\r\nbank-note is merely a _promise_ to hand over so much _material_ wealth\r\nwhen called upon to do so. The father of these four \xe2\x80\x98idle mouths,\xe2\x80\x99 had\r\ndone (let us say) five thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x99 worth of useful work for the\r\ncommunity. In return for this, the community had given him what amounted\r\nto a written promise to hand over, whenever called upon to do so, five\r\nthousand pounds\xe2\x80\x99 worth of food, &c. Then, if he only uses _one_ thousand\r\npounds\xe2\x80\x99 worth himself, and leaves the rest of the notes to his children,\r\nsurely they have a full right to _present_ these written promises, and\r\nto say \xe2\x80\x98hand over the food, for which the equivalent labour has been\r\nalready done.\xe2\x80\x99 Now I think _this_ case well worth stating, publicly and\r\nclearly. I should like to drive it into the heads of those Socialists\r\nwho are priming our ignorant paupers with such sentiments as \xe2\x80\x98Look at\r\nthem bloated haristocrats! Doing not a stroke o\xe2\x80\x99 work for theirselves,\r\nand living on the sweat of _our_ brows!\xe2\x80\x99 I should like to _force_ them\r\nto see that the _money_, which those \xe2\x80\x98haristocrats\xe2\x80\x99 are spending,\r\nrepresents so much labour _already done_ for the community, and whose\r\nequivalent, in _material_ wealth, is _due from the community_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight not the Socialists reply \xe2\x80\x98Much of this money does not represent\r\n_honest_ labour _at all_. If you could trace it back, from owner to\r\nowner, though you might begin with several legitimate steps, such as\r\ngift, or bequeathing by will, or \xe2\x80\x98value received,\xe2\x80\x99 you would soon reach\r\nan owner who had no moral right to it, but had got it by fraud or other\r\ncrimes; and of course his successors in the line would have no better\r\nright to it than _he_ had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut surely that involves the\r\nlogical fallacy of _proving too much_? It is _quite_ as applicable to\r\n_material_ wealth, as it is to _money_. If we once begin to go back\r\nbeyond the fact that the _present_ owner of certain property came by it\r\nhonestly, and to ask whether any previous owner, in past ages, got it by\r\nfraud, would _any_ property be secure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a minute\xe2\x80\x99s thought, I felt obliged to admit the truth of this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy general conclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur continued, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the mere standpoint of\r\nhuman _rights_, man against man, was this\xe2\x80\x94that if some wealthy \xe2\x80\x98idle\r\nmouth,\xe2\x80\x99 who has come by his money in a lawful way, even though not one\r\natom of the labour it represents has been his own doing, chooses to\r\nspend it on his own needs, without contributing any labour to the\r\ncommunity from whom he buys his food and clothes, that community has no\r\n_right_ to interfere with him. But it\xe2\x80\x99s quite another thing, when we\r\ncome to consider the _divine_ law. Measured by _that_ standard, such a\r\nman is undoubtedly doing wrong, if he fails to use, for the good of\r\nthose in need, the strength or the skill, that God has given him. That\r\nstrength and skill do _not_ belong to the community, to be paid to\r\n_them_ as a _debt_: they do _not_ belong to the man _himself_, to be\r\nused for his _own_ enjoyment: they _do_ belong to God, to be used\r\naccording to _His_ will; and we are not left in doubt as to what that\r\nwill is. \xe2\x80\x98_Do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again._\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9can \xe2\x80\x98idle mouth\xe2\x80\x99 very often gives away a great deal in\r\ncharity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn _so-called_ \xe2\x80\x98charity,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected me. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me if I seem to\r\nspeak _un_charitably. I would not dream of _applying_ the term to any\r\n_individual_. But I would say, _generally_, that a man who gratifies\r\nevery fancy that occurs to him\xe2\x80\x94denying himself in _nothing_\xe2\x80\x94and merely\r\ngives to the poor some part, or even _all_, of his _superfluous_ wealth,\r\nis only deceiving himself if he calls it _charity_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, even in giving away _superfluous_ wealth, he _may_ be denying\r\nhimself the miser\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure in hoarding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grant you that, gladly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cGiven that he _has_ that\r\nmorbid craving, he is doing a good deed in restraining it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, even in spending on _himself_,\xe2\x80\x9d I persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cour typical rich man\r\noften does good, by employing people who would otherwise be out of work:\r\nand that is often better than pauperising them by _giving_ the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not like to quit the\r\nsubject without exposing the _two_ fallacies of that statement\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nhave gone so long uncontradicted that Society now accepts it as an\r\naxiom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even see _one_, myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is merely the fallacy of _ambiguity_\xe2\x80\x94the assumption that \xe2\x80\x98_doing\r\ngood_\xe2\x80\x99 (that is, benefiting somebody) is necessarily _a good thing to\r\ndo_ (that is, a _right_ thing). The other is the assumption that, if one\r\nof two specified acts is _better_ than another, it is necessarily a\r\n_good_ act in itself. I should like to call this the fallacy of\r\n_comparison_\xe2\x80\x94meaning that it assumes that what is _comparatively_ good\r\nis therefore _positively_ good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is _your_ test of a good act?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it shall be _our best_,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur confidently replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd even\r\n_then_ \xe2\x80\x98_we are unprofitable servants_.\xe2\x80\x99 But let me illustrate the two\r\nfallacies. Nothing illustrates a fallacy so well as an extreme case,\r\nwhich fairly comes under it. Suppose I find two children drowning in a\r\npond. I rush in, and save one of the children, and then walk away,\r\nleaving the other to drown. Clearly I have \xe2\x80\x98_done good_,\xe2\x80\x99 in saving a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s life? But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. Again, supposing I meet an inoffensive stranger,\r\nand knock him down, and walk on. Clearly that is \xe2\x80\x98_better_\xe2\x80\x99 than if I\r\nhad proceeded to jump upon him and break his ribs? But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose \xe2\x80\x98buts\xe2\x80\x99 are quite unanswerable,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I should like an\r\ninstance from _real_ life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us take one of those abominations of modern Society, a\r\nCharity-Bazaar. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting question to think out\xe2\x80\x94how much of\r\nthe money, that reaches the object in view, is _genuine_ charity; and\r\nwhether even _that_ is spent in the _best_ way. But the subject needs\r\nregular classification, and analysis, to understand it properly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be glad to _have_ it analysed,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cit has often puzzled\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I am really not boring you. Let us suppose our Charity-Bazaar\r\nto have been organised to aid the funds of some Hospital: and that A, B,\r\nC _give_ their services in making articles to sell, and in acting as\r\nsalesmen, while X, Y, Z buy the articles, and the money so paid goes to\r\nthe Hospital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two distinct species of such Bazaars: one, where the payment\r\nexacted is merely the _market-value_ of the goods supplied, that is,\r\nexactly what you would have to pay at a shop: the other, where\r\n_fancy-prices_ are asked. We must take these separately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, the \xe2\x80\x98market-value\xe2\x80\x99 case. Here A, B, C are exactly in the same\r\nposition as ordinary shopkeepers; the only difference being that they\r\ngive the proceeds to the Hospital. Practically, they are _giving their\r\nskilled labour_ for the benefit of the Hospital. This seems to me to be\r\ngenuine charity. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how they could use it better. But X, Y,\r\nZ, are exactly in the same position as any ordinary purchasers of goods.\r\nTo talk of \xe2\x80\x98charity\xe2\x80\x99 in connection with _their_ share of the business,\r\nis sheer nonsense. Yet they are very likely to do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecondly, the case of \xe2\x80\x98fancy-prices.\xe2\x80\x99 Here I think the simplest plan is\r\nto divide the payment into two parts, the \xe2\x80\x98market-value\xe2\x80\x99 and the excess\r\nover that. The \xe2\x80\x98market-value\xe2\x80\x99 part is on the same footing as in the\r\nfirst case: the _excess_ is all we have to consider. Well, A, B, C do\r\nnot _earn_ it; so we may put _them_ out of the question: it is a _gift_,\r\nfrom X, Y, Z, to the Hospital. And my opinion is that it is not given in\r\nthe best way: far better buy what they choose to _buy_, and give what\r\nthey choose to _give_, as two _separate_ transactions: then there is\r\n_some_ chance that their motive in giving may be real charity, instead\r\nof a mixed motive\xe2\x80\x94half charity, half self-pleasing. \xe2\x80\x98The trail of the\r\nserpent is over it all.\xe2\x80\x99 And _therefore_ it is that I hold all such\r\nspurious \xe2\x80\x98Charities\xe2\x80\x99 in _utter_ abomination!\xe2\x80\x9d He ended with unusual\r\nenergy, and savagely beheaded, with his stick, a tall thistle at the\r\nroad-side, behind which I was startled to see Sylvie and Bruno standing.\r\nI caught at his arm, but too late to stop him. Whether the stick reached\r\nthem, or not, I could not feel sure: at any rate they took not the\r\nsmallest notice of it, but smiled gaily, and nodded to me; and I saw at\r\nonce that they were only visible to _me_: the \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 influence had not\r\nreached to _Arthur_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you try to save it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c_That\xe2\x80\x99s_ not the wheedling\r\nSecretary of a Charity-Bazaar! I only wish it were!\xe2\x80\x9d he added grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoos oo know, that stick went right froo my head!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. (They\r\nhad run round to me by this time, and each had secured a hand.) \xe2\x80\x9cJust\r\nunder my chin! I _are_ glad I aren\xe2\x80\x99t a thistle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve threshed _that_ subject out, anyhow!\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking too much, for _your_ patience and for my\r\nstrength. I must be turning soon. This is about the end of my tether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cTake, O boatman, thrice thy fee;\r\n  Take, I give it willingly;\r\n  For, invisible to thee,\r\n  Spirits twain have crossed with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI quoted, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor utterly inappropriate and irrelevant quotations,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Arthur,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are \xe2\x80\x98ekalled by few, and excelled by none\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d And we strolled on.\r\n\r\nAs we passed the head of the lane that led down to the beach, I noticed\r\na single figure, moving slowly along it, seawards. She was a good way\r\noff, and had her back to us: but it was Lady Muriel, unmistakably.\r\nKnowing that Arthur had not seen her, as he had been looking, in the\r\nother direction, at a gathering rain-cloud, I made no remark, but tried\r\nto think of some plausible pretext for sending him back by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity instantly presented itself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting tired,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be prudent to go further. I had better\r\nturn here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned with him, for a few steps, and as we again approached the head\r\nof the lane, I said, as carelessly as I could, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go back by the\r\nroad. It\xe2\x80\x99s too hot and dusty. Down this lane, and along the beach, is\r\nnearly as short; and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a breeze off the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I will,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur began; but at that moment we came into\r\nsight of Lady Muriel, and he checked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s too far round.\r\nYet it certainly _would_ be cooler\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stood, hesitating, looking\r\nfirst one way and then the other\xe2\x80\x94a melancholy picture of utter infirmity\r\nof purpose!\r\n\r\nHow long this humiliating scene would have continued, if _I_ had been\r\nthe only external influence, it is impossible to say; for at this moment\r\nSylvie, with a swift decision worthy of Napoleon himself, took the\r\nmatter into her own hands. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go and drive _her_, up this way,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid to Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get _him_ along!\xe2\x80\x9d And she took hold of the stick\r\nthat Arthur was carrying, and gently pulled him down the lane.\r\n\r\nHe was totally unconscious that any will but his own was acting on the\r\nstick, and appeared to think it had taken a horizontal position simply\r\nbecause he was pointing with it. \xe2\x80\x9cAre not those _orchises_ under the\r\nhedge there?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that decides me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll gather some as I\r\ngo along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98ARE NOT THOSE ORCHISES?\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bruno had run on beyond Lady Muriel, and, with much jumping\r\nabout and shouting (shouts audible to no one but Sylvie and myself),\r\nmuch as if he were driving sheep, he managed to turn her round and make\r\nher walk, with eyes demurely cast upon the ground, in our direction.\r\n\r\nThe victory was ours! And, since it was evident that the lovers, thus\r\nurged together, _must_ meet in another minute, I turned and walked on,\r\nhoping that Sylvie and Bruno would follow my example, as I felt sure\r\nthat the fewer the spectators the better it would be for Arthur and his\r\ngood angel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what sort of meeting was it?\xe2\x80\x9d I wondered, as I paced dreamily on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                             THE DOG-KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shooked hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, who was trotting at my side, in answer\r\nto the unspoken question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they looked _ever_ so pleased!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie added from the other side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we must get on, now, as quick as we can,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I knew\r\nthe best way to Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s farm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to know in this cottage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose they will. Bruno, would you run in and ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie stopped him, laughingly, as he ran off. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI must make you _visible_ first, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _audible_ too, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as she took the jewel, that hung\r\nround her neck, and waved it over his head, and touched his eyes and\r\nlips with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie: \xe2\x80\x9cand _once_, do you know, I made him _audible_, and\r\nforgot to make him _visible_! And he went to buy some sweeties in a\r\nshop. And the man _was_ so frightened! A voice seemed to come out of the\r\nair, \xe2\x80\x98Please, I want two ounces of barley-sugar drops!\xe2\x80\x99 And a shilling\r\ncame _bang_ down upon the counter! And the man said \xe2\x80\x98I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t _see_\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98It doosn\xe2\x80\x99t sinnify seeing _me_, so long as oo can\r\nsee the _shilling_!\xe2\x80\x99 But the man said he never sold barley-sugar drops\r\nto people he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t _see_. So we had to\xe2\x80\x94_Now_, Bruno, you\xe2\x80\x99re ready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd away he trotted.\r\n\r\nSylvie spent the time, while we were waiting for him, in making\r\n_herself_ visible also. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather awkward, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained\r\nto me, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we meet people, and they can see _one_ of us, and ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee the _other_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two Bruno returned, looking rather disconsolate. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngot friends with him, and he were _cross_!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe asked me who I\r\nwere. And I said \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m Bruno: who is _these_ peoples?\xe2\x80\x99 And he said \xe2\x80\x98One\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy half-brother, and t\xe2\x80\x99other\xe2\x80\x99s my half-sister: and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want no more\r\ncompany! Go along with yer!\xe2\x80\x99 And I said \xe2\x80\x98I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t go along _wizout_ mine\r\nself!\xe2\x80\x99 And I said \xe2\x80\x98Oo shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have _bits_ of peoples lying about like\r\nthat! It\xe2\x80\x99s welly untidy!\xe2\x80\x99 And he said \xe2\x80\x98Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to _me_!\xe2\x80\x99 And he\r\npushted me outside! And he shutted the door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you never asked where Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s farm was?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t room for any questions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cThe room were so crowded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree people _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ crowd a room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _did_, though,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno persisted. \xe2\x80\x9c_He_ crowded it most. He\xe2\x80\x99s such\r\na welly _thick_ man\xe2\x80\x94so as oo couldn\xe2\x80\x99t knock him down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI failed to see the drift of Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s argument. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely _anybody_ could\r\nbe knocked down,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cthick or thin wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo couldn\xe2\x80\x99t knock _him_ down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s more wider than he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh: so, when he\xe2\x80\x99s lying down, he\xe2\x80\x99s more higher than when he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstanding: so a-course oo couldn\xe2\x80\x99t knock him _down_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s another cottage,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ ask the way, _this_ time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no need to go in, this time, as the woman was standing in the\r\ndoorway, with a baby in her arms, talking to a respectably dressed man\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfarmer, as I guessed\xe2\x80\x94who seemed to be on his way to the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and when there\xe2\x80\x99s _drink_ to be had,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s just the\r\nworst o\xe2\x80\x99 the lot, is your Willie. So they tell me. He gets fairly mad\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have given \xe2\x80\x99em the lie to their faces, a twelvemonth back!\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nwoman said in a broken voice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut a\xe2\x80\x99 canna noo! A\xe2\x80\x99 canna noo!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nchecked herself, on catching sight of us, and hastily retreated into the\r\nhouse, shutting the door after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you can tell me where Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s farm is?\xe2\x80\x9d I said to the man, as\r\nhe turned away from the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can _that_, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m John Hunter hissel,\r\nat your sarvice. It\xe2\x80\x99s nobbut half a mile further\xe2\x80\x94the only house in\r\nsight, when you get round bend o\xe2\x80\x99 the road yonder. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find my good\r\nwoman within, if so be you\xe2\x80\x99ve business wi\xe2\x80\x99 _her_. Or mebbe I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as\r\nwell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to order some milk. Perhaps I had better\r\narrange it with your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9c_She_ minds all _that_. Good day t\xe2\x80\x99ye, Master\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nto your bonnie childer, as well!\xe2\x80\x9d And he trudged on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe should have said \xe2\x80\x98_child_,\xe2\x80\x99 not \xe2\x80\x98_childer_\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot a _childer_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe meant _both_ of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno persisted. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99cause he said \xe2\x80\x98bonnie\xe2\x80\x99, oo know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at any rate he _looked_ at us both,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie maintained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then he _must_ have seen we\xe2\x80\x99re not _both_ bonnie!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno\r\nretorted. \xe2\x80\x9cA-_course_ I\xe2\x80\x99m much uglier than _oo_! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he mean\r\n_Sylvie_, Mister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted over his shoulder, as he ran off.\r\n\r\nBut there was no use in replying, as he had already vanished round the\r\nbend of the road. When we overtook him he was climbing a gate, and was\r\ngazing earnestly into the field, where a horse, a cow, and a kid were\r\nbrowsing amicably together. \xe2\x80\x9cFor its father, a _Horse_,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cFor its mother, a _Cow_. For their dear little child, a\r\n_little_ Goat, is the most curiousest thing I ever seen in my world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBruno\xe2\x80\x99s World!\xe2\x80\x9d I pondered. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose every child has a world of\r\nhis own\xe2\x80\x94and every man, too, for the matter of that. I wonder if _that\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\nthe cause for all the misunderstanding there is in Life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat _must_ be Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s farm!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie, pointing to a house on the\r\nbrow of the hill, led up to by a cart-road. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no other farm in\r\nsight, _this_ way; and you _said_ we must be nearly there by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had _thought_ it, while Bruno was climbing the gate, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember having _said_ it. However, Sylvie was evidently in the right.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet down, Bruno,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand open the gate for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing we\xe2\x80\x99s with oo, _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ it, Mister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, as\r\nwe entered the field. \xe2\x80\x9cThat big dog might have bited oo, if oo\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\nalone! Oo needn\xe2\x80\x99t be _flightened_ of it!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, clinging tight\r\nto my hand to encourage me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt aren\xe2\x80\x99t fierce!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFierce!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie scornfully echoed, as the dog\xe2\x80\x94a magnificent\r\nNewfoundland\xe2\x80\x94that had come galloping down the field to meet us, began\r\ncurveting round us, in gambols full of graceful beauty, and welcoming us\r\nwith short joyful barks. \xe2\x80\x9cFierce! Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s as gentle as a lamb!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94why, Bruno, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it? It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it _are_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno, rushing forwards and throwing his arms round\r\nits neck. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you _dear_ dog!\xe2\x80\x9d And it seemed as if the two children\r\nwould never have done hugging and stroking it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how _ever_ did he get _here_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk him, Sylvie. I\r\ndoosn\xe2\x80\x99t know how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then began an eager talk in Doggee, which of course was lost upon\r\n_me_; and I could only _guess_, when the beautiful creature, with a sly\r\nglance at me, whispered something in Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, that _I_ was now the\r\nsubject of conversation. Sylvie looked round laughingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked me who you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I said \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s our\r\n_friend_.\xe2\x80\x99 And he said \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\xe2\x80\x99 And I said \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s _Mister\r\nSir_.\xe2\x80\x99 And he said \xe2\x80\x98Bosh!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is \xe2\x80\x98Bosh!\xe2\x80\x99 in Doggee?\xe2\x80\x9d I enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same as in English,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly, when a _dog_ says it,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of a whisper, that\xe2\x80\x99s half a _cough_ and half a _bark_. Nero,\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x98_Bosh!_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Nero, who had now begun gamboling round us again, said \xe2\x80\x9c_Bosh!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nseveral times; and I found that Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s description of the sound was\r\nperfectly accurate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s behind this long wall?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as we walked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the _Orchard_,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie replied, after a consultation with Nero.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, there\xe2\x80\x99s a boy getting down off the wall, at that far corner. And\r\nnow he\xe2\x80\x99s running away across the field. I do believe he\xe2\x80\x99s been stealing\r\nthe apples!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno set off after him, but returned to us in a few moments, as he had\r\nevidently no chance of overtaking the young rascal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch him!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wiss I\xe2\x80\x99d started a little sooner.\r\nHis pockets _was_ full of apples!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Dog-King looked up at Sylvie, and said something in Doggee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of _course_ you can!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow stupid not to think\r\nof it! _Nero_\xe2\x80\x99ll hold him for us, Bruno! But I\xe2\x80\x99d better make him\r\ninvisible, first.\xe2\x80\x9d And she hastily got out the Magic Jewel, and began\r\nwaving it over Nero\xe2\x80\x99s head, and down along his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter him, good Doggie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie exclaimed reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sent\r\nhim off so quick! I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done the tail!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Nero was coursing like a greyhound down the field: so at least\r\nI concluded from all _I_ could see of him\xe2\x80\x94the long feathery tail, which\r\nfloated like a meteor through the air\xe2\x80\x94and in a very few seconds he had\r\ncome up with the little thief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got him safe, by one foot!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sylvie, who was eagerly watching\r\nthe chase. \xe2\x80\x9cNow there\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we walked, quite leisurely, down the field, to where the frightened\r\nlad stood. A more curious sight I had seldom seen, in all my \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexperiences. Every bit of him was in violent action, except the left\r\nfoot, which was apparently glued to the ground\xe2\x80\x94there being nothing\r\nvisibly holding it: while, at some little distance, the long feathery\r\ntail was waving gracefully from side to side, showing that Nero, at\r\nleast, regarded the whole affair as nothing but a magnificent game of\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as gravely as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot the crahmp in me ahnkle!\xe2\x80\x9d the thief groaned in reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 me fut\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone to sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to blubber aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, look here!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said in a commanding tone, getting in front of\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cOo\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give up those apples!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lad glanced at me, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to reckon _my_ interference as\r\nworth anything. Then he glanced at Sylvie: _she_ clearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t count\r\nfor very much, either. Then he took courage. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll take a better man\r\nthan any of _yer_ to get \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted defiantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROYAL THIEF-TAKER]\r\n\r\nSylvie stooped and patted the invisible Nero. \xe2\x80\x9cA _little_ tighter!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered. And a sharp yell from the ragged boy showed how promptly the\r\nDog-King had taken the hint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter _now_?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs your ankle worse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99ll get worse, and worse, and worse,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno solemnly assured him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctill oo gives up those apples!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently the thief was convinced of this at last, and he sulkily began\r\nemptying his pockets of the apples. The children watched from a little\r\ndistance, Bruno dancing with delight at every fresh yell extracted from\r\nNero\xe2\x80\x99s terrified prisoner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s three more in that pocket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother hint from Sylvie to the Dog-King\xe2\x80\x94another sharp yell from the\r\nthief, now convicted of lying also\xe2\x80\x94and the remaining three apples were\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him go, please,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said in Doggee, and the lad limped away at\r\na great pace, stooping now and then to rub the ailing ankle, in fear,\r\nseemingly, that the \xe2\x80\x98crahmp\xe2\x80\x99 might attack it again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98SUMMAT WRONG WI\xe2\x80\x99 MY SPECTACLES!\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\nBruno ran back, with his booty, to the orchard wall, and pitched the\r\napples over it one by one. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99s welly afraid _some_ of them\xe2\x80\x99s gone under\r\nthe wrong trees!\xe2\x80\x9d he panted, on overtaking us again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _wrong_ trees!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cTrees _ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ do wrong! There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno such things as _wrong_ trees!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there\xe2\x80\x99s no such things as _right_ trees, neither!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno.\r\nAnd Sylvie gave up the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute, please!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to me. \xe2\x80\x9cI must make Nero _visible_,\r\nyou know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, _please_ don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno, who had by this time mounted on the\r\nRoyal back, and was twisting the Royal hair into a bridle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\n_such_ fun to have him like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it _does_ look funny,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie admitted, and led the way to the\r\nfarm-house, where the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife stood, evidently much perplexed at\r\nthe weird procession now approaching her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s summat gone wrong wi\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nspectacles, I doubt!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, as she took them off, and began\r\ndiligently rubbing them with a corner of her apron.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sylvie had hastily pulled Bruno down from his steed, and had\r\njust time to make His Majesty wholly visible before the spectacles were\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nAll was natural, now; but the good woman still looked a little uneasy\r\nabout it. \xe2\x80\x9cMy eyesight\xe2\x80\x99s getting bad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I see you _now_,\r\nmy darlings! You\xe2\x80\x99ll give me a kiss, wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno got behind me, in a moment: however Sylvie put up _her_ face, to\r\nbe kissed, as representative of _both_, and we all went in together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                             MATILDA JANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to me, my little gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said our hostess, lifting Bruno into\r\nher lap, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell me everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cThere wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be time. Besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t _know_\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good woman looked a little puzzled, and turned to Sylvie for help.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he like _riding_?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I _think_ so,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie gently replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just had a ride on\r\n_Nero_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Nero\xe2\x80\x99s a grand dog, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Were you ever outside a _horse_, my\r\nlittle man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Always!_\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said with great decision. \xe2\x80\x9cNever was _inside_ one. Was\r\n_oo_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I thought it well to interpose, and to mention the business on\r\nwhich we had come, and so relieved her, for a few minutes, from Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperplexing questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd those dear children will like a bit of cake, _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ warrant!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe farmer\xe2\x80\x99s hospitable wife, when the business was concluded, as she\r\nopened her cupboard, and brought out a cake. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you waste the\r\ncrust, little gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as she handed a good slice of it to\r\nBruno. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what the poetry-book says about wilful waste?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat doos he say about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him, Bessie!\xe2\x80\x9d And the mother looked down, proudly and lovingly, on\r\na rosy little maiden, who had just crept shyly into the room, and was\r\nleaning against her knee. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that your poetry-book says about\r\nwilful waste?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_For wilful waste makes woeful want_,\xe2\x80\x9d Bessie recited, in an almost\r\ninaudible whisper: \xe2\x80\x9c_and you may live to say \xe2\x80\x98How much I wish I had the\r\ncrust that then I threw away!\xe2\x80\x99_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow try if _you_ can say it, my dear! _For wilful_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_For wifful_\xe2\x80\x94sumfinoruvver\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno began, readily enough; and then\r\nthere came a dead pause. \xe2\x80\x9cCa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t remember no more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you _learn_ from it, then? You can tell us _that_, at any\r\nrate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno ate a little more cake, and considered: but the moral did not seem\r\nto him to be a very obvious one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie prompted him in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno softly repeated: and then, with sudden inspiration,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9calways to look where it goes to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere _what_ goes to, darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the _crust_, a course!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, if I lived to say \xe2\x80\x98_How\r\nmuch I wiss I had the crust_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 (and all that), I\xe2\x80\x99d know where I frew it\r\nto!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis new interpretation quite puzzled the good woman. She returned to\r\nthe subject of \xe2\x80\x98Bessie.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to see Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s doll, my\r\ndears! Bessie, take the little lady and gentleman to see Matilda Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie\xe2\x80\x99s shyness thawed away in a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cMatilda Jane has just woke\r\nup,\xe2\x80\x9d she stated, confidentially, to Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cWo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you help me on with\r\nher frock? Them strings _is_ such a bother to tie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tie _strings_,\xe2\x80\x9d we heard, in Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s gentle voice, as the two\r\nlittle girls left the room together. Bruno ignored the whole proceeding,\r\nand strolled to the window, quite with the air of a fashionable\r\ngentleman. Little girls, and dolls, were not at all in his line.\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith the fond mother proceeded to tell me (as what mother is\r\nnot ready to do?) of all Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s virtues (and vices too, for the matter\r\nof that) and of the many fearful maladies which, notwithstanding those\r\nruddy cheeks and that plump little figure, had nearly, time and again,\r\nswept her from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen the full stream of loving memories had nearly run itself out, I\r\nbegan to question her about the working men of that neighbourhood, and\r\nspecially the \xe2\x80\x98Willie,\xe2\x80\x99 whom we had heard of at his cottage. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a\r\ngood fellow once,\xe2\x80\x9d said my kind hostess: \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s the drink has ruined\r\nhim! Not that I\xe2\x80\x99d rob them of the drink\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the most of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94but there\xe2\x80\x99s some as is too weak to stand agin\xe2\x80\x99 temptations: it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nthousand pities, for _them_, as they ever built the Golden Lion at the\r\ncorner there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Golden Lion?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the new Public,\xe2\x80\x9d my hostess explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it stands right in the\r\nway, and handy for the workmen, as they come back from the brickfields,\r\nas it might be to-day, with their week\xe2\x80\x99s wages. A deal of money gets\r\nwasted that way. And some of \xe2\x80\x99em gets drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only they could have it in their own houses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I mused, hardly\r\nknowing I had said the words out loud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d she eagerly exclaimed. It was evidently a solution, of the\r\nproblem, that she had already thought out. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only you could manage,\r\nso\xe2\x80\x99s each man to have his own little barrel in his own house\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhardly be a drunken man in the length and breadth of the land!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then I told her the old story\xe2\x80\x94about a certain cottager who bought\r\nhimself a little barrel of beer, and installed his wife as bar-keeper:\r\nand how, every time he wanted his mug of beer, he regularly paid her\r\nover the counter for it: and how she never would let him go on \xe2\x80\x98tick,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand was a perfectly inflexible bar-keeper in never letting him have more\r\nthan his proper allowance: and how, every time the barrel needed\r\nrefilling, she had plenty to do it with, and something over for her\r\nmoney-box: and how, at the end of the year, he not only found himself in\r\nfirst-rate health and spirits, with that undefinable but quite\r\nunmistakeable air which always distinguishes the sober man from the one\r\nwho takes \xe2\x80\x98a drop too much,\xe2\x80\x99 but had quite a box full of money, all\r\nsaved out of his own pence!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only they\xe2\x80\x99d all do like that!\xe2\x80\x9d said the good woman, wiping her eyes,\r\nwhich were overflowing with kindly sympathy. \xe2\x80\x9cDrink hadn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be\r\nthe curse it is to some\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a _curse_,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it is used wrongly. Any of God\xe2\x80\x99s gifts\r\nmay be turned into a curse, unless we use it wisely. But we must be\r\ngetting home. Would you call the little girls? Matilda Jane has seen\r\nenough of company, for _one_ day, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll find \xe2\x80\x99em in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said my hostess, as she rose to leave the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe that young gentleman saw which way they went?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they, Bruno?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t in the field,\xe2\x80\x9d was Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s rather evasive reply, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99cause\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but _pigs_ there, and Sylvie isn\xe2\x80\x99t a pig. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimperrupt me any more, \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m telling a story to this fly; and it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t attend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re among the apples, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife. So\r\nwe left Bruno to finish his story, and went out into the orchard, where\r\nwe soon came upon the children, walking sedately side by side, Sylvie\r\ncarrying the doll, while little Bess carefully shaded its face, with a\r\nlarge cabbage-leaf for a parasol.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they caught sight of us, little Bess dropped her cabbage-leaf\r\nand came running to meet us, Sylvie following more slowly, as her\r\nprecious charge evidently needed great care and attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m its Mamma, and Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s the Head-Nurse,\xe2\x80\x9d Bessie explained: \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nSylvie\xe2\x80\x99s taught me ever such a pretty song, for me to sing to Matilda\r\nJane!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hear it once more, Sylvie,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, delighted at getting the\r\nchance I had long wished for, of hearing her sing. But Sylvie turned shy\r\nand frightened in a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, _please_ not!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in an earnest\r\n\xe2\x80\x98aside\xe2\x80\x99 to me. \xe2\x80\x9cBessie knows it quite perfect now. Bessie can sing it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye! Let Bessie sing it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the proud mother. \xe2\x80\x9cBessie has a\r\nbonny voice of her own,\xe2\x80\x9d (this again was an \xe2\x80\x98aside\xe2\x80\x99 to me) \xe2\x80\x9cthough I say\r\nit as shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie was only too happy to accept the \xe2\x80\x98encore.\xe2\x80\x99 So the plump little\r\nMamma sat down at our feet, with her hideous daughter reclining stiffly\r\nacross her lap (it was one of a kind that wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t sit down, under _any_\r\namount of persuasion), and, with a face simply beaming with delight,\r\nbegan the lullaby, in a shout that _ought_ to have frightened the poor\r\nbaby into fits. The Head-Nurse crouched down behind her, keeping herself\r\nrespectfully in the back-ground, with her hands on the shoulders of her\r\nlittle mistress, so as to be ready to act as Prompter, if required, and\r\nto supply \xe2\x80\x98_each gap in faithless memory void_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BESSIE\xe2\x80\x99S SONG]\r\n\r\nThe shout, with which she began, proved to be only a momentary effort.\r\nAfter a very few notes, Bessie toned down, and sang on in a small but\r\nvery sweet voice. At first her great black eyes were fixed on her\r\nmother, but soon her gaze wandered upwards, among the apples, and she\r\nseemed to have quite forgotten that she had any other audience than her\r\nBaby, and her Head-Nurse, who once or twice supplied, almost inaudibly,\r\nthe right note, when the singer was getting a little \xe2\x80\x98flat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cMatilda Jane, you never look\r\n  At any toy or picture-book:\r\n  I show you pretty things in vain\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  You must be blind, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cI ask you riddles, tell you tales,\r\n  But _all_ our conversation fails:\r\n  You _never_ answer me again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  I fear you\xe2\x80\x99re dumb, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cMatilda, darling, when I call,\r\n  You never seem to hear at all:\r\n  I shout with all my might and main\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  But you\xe2\x80\x99re _so_ deaf, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cMatilda Jane, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind;\r\n  For, though you\xe2\x80\x99re deaf, and dumb, and blind,\r\n  There\xe2\x80\x99s _some one_ loves you, it is plain\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  And that is _me,_ Matilda Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sang three of the verses in a rather perfunctory style, but the last\r\nstanza evidently excited the little maiden. Her voice rose, ever clearer\r\nand louder: she had a rapt look on her face, as if suddenly inspired,\r\nand, as she sang the last few words, she clasped to her heart the\r\ninattentive Matilda Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss it now!\xe2\x80\x9d prompted the Head-Nurse. And in a moment the simpering\r\nmeaningless face of the Baby was covered with a shower of passionate\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a bonny song!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x9cWho made the words,\r\ndearie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll look for Bruno,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said demurely, and left us\r\nhastily. The curious child seemed always afraid of being praised, or\r\neven noticed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSylvie planned the words,\xe2\x80\x9d Bessie informed us, proud of her superior\r\ninformation: \xe2\x80\x9cand Bruno planned the music\xe2\x80\x94and _I_ sang it!\xe2\x80\x9d (this last\r\ncircumstance, by the way, we did not need to be told).\r\n\r\nSo we followed Sylvie, and all entered the parlour together. Bruno was\r\nstill standing at the window, with his elbows on the sill. He had,\r\napparently, finished the story that he was telling to the fly, and had\r\nfound a new occupation. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t imperrupt!\xe2\x80\x9d he said as we came in. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncounting the Pigs in the field!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many are there?\xe2\x80\x9d I enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a thousand and four,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean \xe2\x80\x98about a thousand,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie corrected him. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no good\r\nsaying \xe2\x80\x98_and four_\xe2\x80\x99: you _ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ be sure about the four!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re as wrong as ever!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno exclaimed triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nthe _four_ I _can_ be sure about; \xe2\x80\x99cause they\xe2\x80\x99re here, grubbling under\r\nthe window! It\xe2\x80\x99s the _thousand_ I isn\xe2\x80\x99t pruffickly sure about!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut some of them have gone into the sty,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, leaning over him\r\nto look out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno; \xe2\x80\x9cbut they went so slowly and so fewly, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nto count _them_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must be going, children,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWish Bessie good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie\r\nflung her arms round the little maiden\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and kissed her: but Bruno\r\nstood aloof, looking unusually shy. (\xe2\x80\x9cI never kiss _nobody_ but Sylvie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe explained to me afterwards.) The farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife showed us out: and we\r\nwere soon on our way back to Elveston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s the new public-house that we were talking about, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI said, as we came in sight of a long low building, with the words \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nGolden Lion\xe2\x80\x99 over the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if _her_ Willie\xe2\x80\x99s inside? Run\r\nin, Bruno, and see if he\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI interposed, feeling that Bruno was, in a sort of way, in _my_ care.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not a place to send a child into.\xe2\x80\x9d For already the revelers were\r\ngetting noisy: and a wild discord of singing, shouting, and meaningless\r\nlaughter came to us through the open windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t _see_ him, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie explained. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\r\nBruno!\xe2\x80\x9d She clasped the jewel, that always hung round her neck, between\r\nthe palms of her hands, and muttered a few words to herself. What they\r\nwere I could not at all make out, but some mysterious change seemed\r\ninstantly to pass over us. My feet seemed to me no longer to press the\r\nground, and the dream-like feeling came upon me, that I was suddenly\r\nendowed with the power of floating in the air. I could still just _see_\r\nthe children: but their forms were shadowy and unsubstantial, and their\r\nvoices sounded as if they came from some distant place and time, they\r\nwere so unreal. However, I offered no further opposition to Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing into the house. He was back again in a few moments. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re talking about him inside, and saying how\r\ndrunk he was last week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, one of the men lounged out through the door, a\r\npipe in one hand and a mug of beer in the other, and crossed to where we\r\nwere standing, so as to get a better view along the road. Two or three\r\nothers leaned out through the open window, each holding his mug of beer,\r\nwith red faces and sleepy eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cCanst see him, lad?\xe2\x80\x9d one of them asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dunnot know,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said, taking a step forwards, which brought us\r\nnearly face to face. Sylvie hastily pulled me out of his way. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see us. What would have\r\nhappened if I had staid in his way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to _us_; but\r\n_you_ may be different.\xe2\x80\x9d She said this in her usual voice, but the man\r\ntook no sort of notice, though she was standing close in front of him,\r\nand looking up into his face as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming now!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno, pointing down the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe be a-coomin noo!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the man, stretching out his arm exactly\r\nover Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s head, and pointing with his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _chorus_ agin!\xe2\x80\x9d was shouted out by one of the red-faced men in the\r\nwindow: and forthwith a dozen voices yelled, to a harsh discordant\r\nmelody, the refrain:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s him, an\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 me,\r\n            Roarin\xe2\x80\x99 laddies!\r\n  We loves a bit o spree,\r\n  Roarin\xe2\x80\x99 laddies we,\r\n            Roarin\xe2\x80\x99 laddies\r\n            Roarin\xe2\x80\x99 laddies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man lounged back again to the house, joining lustily in the chorus\r\nas he went: so that only the children and I were in the road when\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Willie\xe2\x80\x99 came up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                             WILLIE\xe2\x80\x99S WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe made for the door of the public-house, but the children intercepted\r\nhim. Sylvie clung to one arm; while Bruno, on the opposite side, was\r\npushing him with all his strength, with many inarticulate cries of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee-up! Gee-back! Woah then!\xe2\x80\x9d which he had picked up from the\r\nwaggoners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Willie\xe2\x80\x99 took not the least notice of them: he was simply conscious that\r\n_something_ had checked him: and, for want of any other way of\r\naccounting for it, he seemed to regard it as his own act.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RESCUE OF WILLIE]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wunnut coom in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said: \xe2\x80\x9cnot to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mug o\xe2\x80\x99 beer wunnut hurt \xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x9d his friends shouted in chorus. \xe2\x80\x9c_Two_\r\nmugs wunnut hurt \xe2\x80\x99ee! Nor a dozen mugs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m agoan whoam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, withouten thy drink, Willie man?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the others. But \xe2\x80\x98Willie\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99 would have no more discussion, and turned doggedly away, the\r\nchildren keeping one on each side of him, to guard him against any\r\nchange in his sudden resolution.\r\n\r\nFor a while he walked on stoutly enough, keeping his hands in his\r\npockets, and softly whistling a tune, in time to his heavy tread: his\r\nsuccess, in appearing entirely at his ease, was _almost_ complete; but a\r\ncareful observer would have noted that he had forgotten the second part\r\nof the air, and that, when it broke down, he instantly began it again,\r\nbeing too nervous to think of another, and too restless to endure\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nIt was not the old fear that possessed him now\xe2\x80\x94the old fear, that had\r\nbeen his dreary companion every Saturday night he could remember, as he\r\nhad reeled along, steadying himself against gates and garden-palings,\r\nand when the shrill reproaches of his wife had seemed to his dazed brain\r\nonly the echo of a yet more piercing voice within, the intolerable wail\r\nof a hopeless remorse: it was a wholly new fear that had come to him\r\nnow: life had taken on itself a new set of colours, and was lighted up\r\nwith a new and dazzling radiance, and he did not see, as yet, how his\r\nhome-life, and his wife and child, would fit into the new order of\r\nthings: the very novelty of it all was, to his simple mind, a perplexity\r\nand an overwhelming terror.\r\n\r\nAnd now the tune died into sudden silence on the trembling lips, as he\r\nturned a sharp corner, and came in sight of his own cottage, where his\r\nwife stood, leaning with folded arms on the wicket-gate, and looking up\r\nthe road with a pale face, that had in it no glimmer of the light of\r\nhope\xe2\x80\x94only the heavy shadow of a deep stony despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine an\xe2\x80\x99 early, lad! Fine an\xe2\x80\x99 early!\xe2\x80\x9d The words might have been words\r\nof welcoming, but oh, the bitterness of the tone in which she said it!\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat brings thee from thy merry mates, and all the fiddling and the\r\njigging? Pockets empty, I doubt? Or thou\xe2\x80\x99st come, mebbe, for to see thy\r\nlittle one die? The bairnie\xe2\x80\x99s clemmed, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve nor bite nor sup to gie\r\nher. But what does _thou_ care?\xe2\x80\x9d She flung the gate open, and met him\r\nwith blazing eyes of fury.\r\n\r\nThe man said no word. Slowly, and with downcast eyes, he passed into the\r\nhouse, while she, half terrified at his strange silence, followed him in\r\nwithout another word; and it was not till he had sunk into a chair, with\r\nhis arms crossed on the table and with drooping head, that she found her\r\nvoice again.\r\n\r\nIt seemed entirely natural for us to go in with them: at another time\r\none would have asked leave for this, but I felt, I knew not why, that we\r\nwere in some mysterious way invisible, and as free to come and to go as\r\ndisembodied spirits.\r\n\r\nThe child in the cradle woke up, and raised a piteous cry, which in a\r\nmoment brought the children to its side: Bruno rocked the cradle, while\r\nSylvie tenderly replaced the little head on the pillow from which it had\r\nslipped. But the mother took no heed of the cry, nor yet of the\r\nsatisfied \xe2\x80\x98coo\xe2\x80\x99 that it set up when Sylvie had made it happy again: she\r\nonly stood gazing at her husband, and vainly trying, with white\r\nquivering lips (I believe she thought he was mad), to speak in the old\r\ntones of shrill upbraiding that he knew so well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou\xe2\x80\x99st spent all thy wages\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear thou hast\xe2\x80\x94on the devil\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\ndrink\xe2\x80\x94and thou\xe2\x80\x99st been and made thysen a beast again\xe2\x80\x94as thou allus\r\ndost\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasna!\xe2\x80\x9d the man muttered, his voice hardly rising above a whisper, as\r\nhe slowly emptied his pockets on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 wage, Missus,\r\nevery penny on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman gasped, and put one hand to her heart, as if under some great\r\nshock of surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThen _how_\xe2\x80\x99s thee gotten th\xe2\x80\x99 drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hasna_ gotten it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered her, in a tone more sad than sullen. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhanna touched a drop this blessed day. No!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried aloud, bringing his\r\nclenched fist heavily down upon the table, and looking up at her with\r\ngleaming eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cnor I\xe2\x80\x99ll never touch another drop o\xe2\x80\x99 the cursed\r\ndrink\xe2\x80\x94till I die\xe2\x80\x94so help me God my Maker!\xe2\x80\x9d His voice, which had suddenly\r\nrisen to a hoarse shout, dropped again as suddenly: and once more he\r\nbowed his head, and buried his face in his folded arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIE\xe2\x80\x99S WIFE]\r\n\r\nThe woman had dropped upon her knees by the cradle, while he was\r\nspeaking. She neither looked at him nor seemed to hear him. With hands\r\nclasped above her head, she rocked herself wildly to and fro. \xe2\x80\x9cOh my\r\nGod! Oh my God!\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said, over and over again.\r\n\r\nSylvie and Bruno gently unclasped her hands and drew them down\xe2\x80\x94till she\r\nhad an arm round each of them, though she took no notice of them, but\r\nknelt on with eyes gazing upwards, and lips that moved as if in silent\r\nthanksgiving. The man kept his face hidden, and uttered no sound: but\r\none could _see_ the sobs that shook him from head to foot.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he raised his head\xe2\x80\x94his face all wet with tears. \xe2\x80\x9cPolly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said softly; and then, louder, \xe2\x80\x9cOld Poll!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she rose from her knees and came to him, with a dazed look, as if\r\nshe were walking in her sleep. \xe2\x80\x9cWho was it called me old Poll?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked: her voice took on it a tender playfulness: her eyes sparkled; and\r\nthe rosy light of Youth flushed her pale cheeks, till she looked more\r\nlike a happy girl of seventeen than a worn woman of forty. \xe2\x80\x9cWas that my\r\nown lad, my Willie, a-waiting for me at the stile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face too was transformed, in the same magic light, to the likeness\r\nof a bashful boy: and boy and girl they seemed, as he wound an arm about\r\nher, and drew her to his side, while with the other hand he thrust from\r\nhim the heap of money, as though it were something hateful to the touch.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTak it, lass,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctak it all! An\xe2\x80\x99 fetch us summat to eat: but\r\nget a sup o\xe2\x80\x99 milk, first, for t\xe2\x80\x99 bairn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy _little_ bairn!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured as she gathered up the coins. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own\r\nlittle lassie!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she moved to the door, and was passing out, but a\r\nsudden thought seemed to arrest her: she hastily returned\xe2\x80\x94first to kneel\r\ndown and kiss the sleeping child, and then to throw herself into her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s arms and be strained to his heart. The next moment she was on\r\nher way, taking with her a jug that hung on a peg near the door: we\r\nfollowed close behind.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far before we came in sight of a swinging sign-board\r\nbearing the word \xe2\x80\x98DAIRY\xe2\x80\x99 on it, and here she went in, welcomed by a\r\nlittle curly white dog, who, not being under the \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 influence, saw\r\nthe children, and received them with the most effusive affection. When I\r\ngot inside, the dairyman was in the act of taking the money. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nthysen, Missus, or for t\xe2\x80\x99 bairn?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when he had filled the jug,\r\npausing with it in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor t\xe2\x80\x99 _bairn_!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThink\xe2\x80\x99st tha I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntouch a drop _mysen_, while as _she_ hadna got her fill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Missus,\xe2\x80\x9d the man replied, turning away with the jug in his\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just mak sure it\xe2\x80\x99s good measure.\xe2\x80\x9d He went back among his\r\nshelves of milk-bowls, carefully keeping his back towards her while he\r\nemptied a little measure of cream into the jug, muttering to himself\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmebbe it\xe2\x80\x99ll hearten her up a bit, the little lassie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman never noticed the kind deed, but took back the jug with a\r\nsimple \xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Master,\xe2\x80\x9d and went her way: but the children had\r\nbeen more observant, and, as we followed her out, Bruno remarked \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nwere _welly_ kind: and I loves that man: and if I was welly rich I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive him a hundred pounds\xe2\x80\x94and a bun. That little grummeling dog doosn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow its business!\xe2\x80\x9d He referred to the dairyman\xe2\x80\x99s little dog, who had\r\napparently quite forgotten the affectionate welcome he had given us on\r\nour arrival, and was now following at a respectful distance, doing his\r\nbest to \xe2\x80\x98_speed the parting guest_\xe2\x80\x99 with a shower of little shrill\r\nbarks, that seemed to tread on one another\xe2\x80\x99s heels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ a dog\xe2\x80\x99s business?\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cDogs ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t keep shops\r\nand give change!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSisters\xe2\x80\x99 businesses _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ to laugh at their brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno replied\r\nwith perfect gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd dogs\xe2\x80\x99 businesses is to _bark_\xe2\x80\x94not like that:\r\nit should finish one bark before it begins another: and it should\xe2\x80\x94Oh\r\nSylvie, there\xe2\x80\x99s some dindledums!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in another moment the happy children were flying across the common,\r\nracing for the patch of dandelions.\r\n\r\nWhile I stood watching them, a strange dreamy feeling came upon me: a\r\nrailway-platform seemed to take the place of the green sward, and,\r\ninstead of the light figure of Sylvie bounding along, I seemed to see\r\nthe flying form of Lady Muriel; but whether Bruno had also undergone a\r\ntransformation, and had become the old man whom she was running to\r\novertake, I was unable to judge, so instantaneously did the feeling come\r\nand go.\r\n\r\nWhen I re-entered the little sitting-room which I shared with Arthur, he\r\nwas standing with his back to me, looking out of the open window, and\r\nevidently had not heard me enter. A cup of tea, apparently just tasted\r\nand pushed aside, stood on the table, on the opposite side of which was\r\na letter, just begun, with the pen lying across it: an open book lay on\r\nthe sofa: the London paper occupied the easy chair; and on the little\r\ntable, which stood by it, I noticed an unlighted cigar and an open box\r\nof cigar-lights: all things betokened that the Doctor, usually so\r\nmethodical and so self-contained, had been trying every form of\r\noccupation, and could settle to none!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very unlike _you_, Doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d I was beginning, but checked\r\nmyself, as he turned at the sound of my voice, in sheer amazement at the\r\nwonderful change that had taken place in his appearance. Never had I\r\nseen a face so radiant with happiness, or eyes that sparkled with such\r\nunearthly light! \xe2\x80\x9cEven thus,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cmust the herald-angel have\r\nlooked, who brought to the shepherds, watching over their flocks by\r\nnight, that sweet message of \xe2\x80\x98_peace on earth, good-will to men_\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear friend!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as if in answer to the question that I\r\nsuppose he read in my face. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true! It is true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo need to ask _what_ was true. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you both!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as I felt\r\nthe happy tears brimming to my eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were made for each other!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe we were. And _what_ a change it makes\r\nin one\xe2\x80\x99s Life! This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same world! That isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sky I saw\r\nyesterday! Those clouds\xe2\x80\x94I never saw such clouds in all my life before!\r\nThey look like troops of hovering angels!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo _me_ they looked very ordinary clouds indeed: but then _I_ had not\r\nfed \xe2\x80\x98_on honey-dew, And drunk the milk of Paradise_\xe2\x80\x99!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants to see you\xe2\x80\x94at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, descending suddenly to the\r\nthings of earth. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says _that_ is the _one_ drop yet wanting in her\r\ncup of happiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go at once,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as I turned to leave the room. \xe2\x80\x9cWo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ncome with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, with a sudden effort\xe2\x80\x94which proved an utter\r\nfailure\xe2\x80\x94to resume his professional manner. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I _look_ like coming with\r\nyou? Have you never heard that two is company, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ heard it: and I\xe2\x80\x99m painfully aware that_ I_ am\r\n_Number Three_! But, _when_ shall we three meet again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_When the hurly-burly\xe2\x80\x99s done!_\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with a happy laugh, such as\r\nI had not heard from him for many a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                               MEIN HERR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I went on my lonely way, and, on reaching the Hall, I found Lady\r\nMuriel standing at the garden-gate waiting for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need to _give_ you joy, or to _wish_ you joy?\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone _whatever_!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with the joyous laugh of a child. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\n_give_ people what they haven\xe2\x80\x99t got: we _wish_ for something that is yet\r\nto come. For _me_, it\xe2\x80\x99s all _here_! It\xe2\x80\x99s all _mine_! Dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsuddenly broke off, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think Heaven ever begins on _Earth_, for any\r\nof us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor _some_,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor some, perhaps, who are simple and childlike.\r\nYou know He said \xe2\x80\x98of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel clasped her hands, and gazed up into the cloudless sky, with\r\na look I had often seen in Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if it had begun for\r\n_me_,\xe2\x80\x9d she almost whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if _I_ were one of the happy\r\nchildren, whom He bid them bring near to Him, though the people would\r\nhave kept them back. Yes, He has seen me in the throng. He has read the\r\nwistful longing in my eyes. He has beckoned me to Him. They have _had_\r\nto make way for me. He has taken me up in His arms. He has put His hands\r\nupon me and blessed me!\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, breathless in her perfect\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think He has!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must come and speak to my father,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, as we stood side by\r\nside at the gate, looking down the shady lane. But, even as she said the\r\nwords, the \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 sensation came over me like a flood: I saw the dear\r\nold Professor approaching us, and also saw, what was stranger still,\r\nthat he was visible to _Lady Muriel_!\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? Had the fairy-life been merged in the real life? Or\r\nwas Lady Muriel \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 also, and thus able to enter into the\r\nfairy-world along with me? The words were on my lips (\xe2\x80\x9cI see an old\r\nfriend of mine in the lane: if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know him, may I introduce him\r\nto you?\xe2\x80\x9d) when the strangest thing of all happened: Lady Muriel spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see an old friend of mine in the lane,\xe2\x80\x9d she said: \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhim, may I introduce him to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI seemed to wake out of a dream: for the \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 feeling was still\r\nstrong upon me, and the figure outside seemed to be changing at every\r\nmoment, like one of the shapes in a kaleidoscope: now he was the\r\n_Professor_, and now he was somebody else! By the time he had reached\r\nthe gate, he certainly was somebody else: and I felt that the proper\r\ncourse was for _Lady Muriel_, not for _me_, to introduce him. She\r\ngreeted him kindly, and, opening the gate, admitted the venerable old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94a German, obviously\xe2\x80\x94who looked about him with dazed eyes, as if\r\n_he_, too, had but just awaked from a dream!\r\n\r\nNo, it was certainly _not_ the Professor! My old friend _could_ not have\r\ngrown that magnificent beard since last we met: moreover, he would have\r\nrecognised _me_, for I was certain that _I_ had not changed much in the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he simply looked at me vaguely, and took off his hat in\r\nresponse to Lady Muriel\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cLet me introduce Mein Herr to you\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nwhile in the words, spoken in a strong German accent, \xe2\x80\x9cproud to make\r\nyour acquaintance, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d I could detect no trace of an idea that we had\r\never met before.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel led us to the well-known shady nook, where preparations for\r\nafternoon tea had already been made, and, while she went in to look for\r\nthe Earl, we seated ourselves in two easy-chairs, and \xe2\x80\x98Mein Herr\xe2\x80\x99 took\r\nup Lady Muriel\xe2\x80\x99s work, and examined it through his large spectacles (one\r\nof the adjuncts that made him so provokingly like the Professor).\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHemming pocket-handkerchiefs?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, musingly. \xe2\x80\x9cSo _that_ is what\r\nthe English miladies occupy themselves with, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the one accomplishment,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cin which Man has never yet\r\nrivaled Woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Lady Muriel returned with her father; and, after he had exchanged\r\nsome friendly words with \xe2\x80\x98Mein Herr,\xe2\x80\x99 and we had all been supplied with\r\nthe needful \xe2\x80\x98creature-comforts,\xe2\x80\x99 the newcomer returned to the suggestive\r\nsubject of Pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard of Fortunatus\xe2\x80\x99s Purse, Miladi? Ah, so! Would you be\r\nsurprised to hear that, with three of these leetle handkerchiefs, you\r\nshall make the Purse of Fortunatus, quite soon, quite easily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel eagerly replied, as she took a heap of\r\nthem into her lap, and threaded her needle. \xe2\x80\x9c_Please_ tell me how, Mein\r\nHerr! I\xe2\x80\x99ll make one before I touch another drop of tea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr, possessing himself of two of the\r\nhandkerchiefs, spreading one upon the other, and holding them up by two\r\ncorners, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall first join together these upper corners, the right\r\nto the right, the left to the left; and the opening between them shall\r\nbe the _mouth_ of the Purse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA very few stitches sufficed to carry out _this_ direction. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, if I\r\nsew the other three edges together,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cthe bag is\r\ncomplete?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, Miladi: the _lower_ edges shall _first_ be joined\xe2\x80\x94ah, not so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(as she was beginning to sew them together). \xe2\x80\x9cTurn one of them over, and\r\njoin the _right_ lower corner of the one to the _left_ lower corner of\r\nthe other, and sew the lower edges together in what you would call _the\r\nwrong way_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ see!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel, as she deftly executed the order. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd a\r\nvery twisted, uncomfortable, uncanny-looking bag it makes! But the\r\n_moral_ is a lovely one. Unlimited wealth can only be attained by doing\r\nthings _in the wrong way_! And how are we to join up these\r\nmysterious\xe2\x80\x94no, I mean _this_ mysterious opening?\xe2\x80\x9d (twisting the thing\r\nround and round with a puzzled air.) \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it _is_ one opening. I\r\nthought it was _two_, at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen the puzzle of the Paper Ring?\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr said, addressing\r\nthe Earl. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere you take a slip of paper, and join its ends together,\r\nfirst twisting one, so as to join the _upper_ corner of _one_ end to the\r\n_lower_ corner of the _other_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw one made, only yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d the Earl replied. \xe2\x80\x9cMuriel, my child,\r\nwere you not making one, to amuse those children you had to tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know that Puzzle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring has only _one_\r\nsurface, and only _one_ edge. It\xe2\x80\x99s very mysterious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _bag_ is just like that, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cIs not the\r\n_outer_ surface of one side of it continuous with the _inner_ surface of\r\nthe other side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly it _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ a bag, just yet. How shall\r\nwe fill up this opening, Mein Herr?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man impressively, taking the bag from her, and\r\nrising to his feet in the excitement of the explanation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe edge of\r\nthe opening consists of _four_ handkerchief-edges, and you can trace it\r\ncontinuously, round and round the opening: down the right edge of _one_\r\nhandkerchief, up the left edge of the _other_, and then down the left\r\nedge of the _one_, and up the right edge of the _other_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you can!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel murmured thoughtfully, leaning her head on her\r\nhand, and earnestly watching the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that _proves_ it to be\r\nonly _one_ opening!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORTUNATUS\xe2\x80\x99 PURSE]\r\n\r\nShe looked so strangely like a child, puzzling over a difficult lesson,\r\nand Mein Herr had become, for the moment, so strangely like the old\r\nProfessor, that I felt utterly bewildered: the \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 feeling was on me\r\nin its full force, and I felt almost _impelled_ to say \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nunderstand it, Sylvie?\xe2\x80\x9d However I checked myself by a great effort, and\r\nlet the dream (if indeed it _was_ a dream) go on to its end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, this _third_ handkerchief,\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9chas _also_ four\r\nedges, which you can trace continuously round and round: all you need do\r\nis to join its four edges to the four edges of the opening. The Purse is\r\nthen complete, and its outer surface\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ see!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel eagerly interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cIts _outer_ surface will be\r\ncontinuous with its _inner_ surface! But it will take time. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sew it\r\nup after tea.\xe2\x80\x9d She laid aside the bag and resumed her cup of tea. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhy do you call it Fortunatus\xe2\x80\x99s Purse, Mein Herr?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dear old man beamed upon her, with a jolly smile, looking more\r\nexactly like the Professor than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see, my child\xe2\x80\x94I should\r\nsay Miladi? Whatever is _inside_ that Purse, is _outside_ it; and\r\nwhatever is _outside_ it, is _inside_ it. So you have all the wealth of\r\nthe world in that leetle Purse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis pupil clapped her hands, in unrestrained delight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly\r\nsew the third handkerchief in\xe2\x80\x94_some_ time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said: \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nup your time by trying it now. Tell us some more wonderful things,\r\nplease!\xe2\x80\x9d And her face and her voice so _exactly_ recalled Sylvie, that I\r\ncould not help glancing round, half-expecting to see _Bruno_ also!\r\n\r\nMein Herr began thoughtfully balancing his spoon on the edge of his\r\nteacup, while he pondered over this request. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething wonderful\xe2\x80\x94like\r\n Fortunatus\xe2\x80\x99s Purse? _That_ will give you\xe2\x80\x94when it is made\xe2\x80\x94wealth beyond\r\nyour wildest dreams: but it will not give you _Time_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pause of silence ensued\xe2\x80\x94utilised by Lady Muriel for the very practical\r\npurpose of refilling the teacups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn _your_ country,\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr began with a startling abruptness, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nbecomes of all the wasted Time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel looked grave. \xe2\x80\x9cWho can tell?\xe2\x80\x9d she half-whispered to herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll one knows is that it is gone\xe2\x80\x94past recall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in _my_\xe2\x80\x94I mean in a country _I_ have visited,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey store it up: and it comes in _very_ useful, years afterwards! For\r\nexample, suppose you have a long tedious evening before you: nobody to\r\ntalk to: nothing you care to do: and yet hours too soon to go to bed.\r\nHow do _you_ behave then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI get _very_ cross,\xe2\x80\x9d she frankly admitted: \xe2\x80\x9cand I want to throw things\r\nabout the room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen that happens to\xe2\x80\x94to the people I have visited, they never act _so_.\r\nBy a short and simple process\xe2\x80\x94which I cannot explain to you\xe2\x80\x94they store\r\nup the useless hours: and, on some _other_ occasion, when they happen to\r\n_need_ extra time, they get them out again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Earl was listening with a slightly incredulous smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy cannot\r\nyou _explain_ the process?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired.\r\n\r\nMein Herr was ready with a quite unanswerable reason. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you have\r\nno _words_, in _your_ language, to convey the ideas which are needed. I\r\ncould explain it in\xe2\x80\x94in\xe2\x80\x94but you would not understand it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel, graciously dispensing with the _name_ of\r\nthe unknown language. \xe2\x80\x9cI never learnt it\xe2\x80\x94at least, not to speak it\r\n_fluently_, you know. _Please_ tell us some more wonderful things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey run their railway-trains without any engines\xe2\x80\x94nothing is needed but\r\nmachinery to _stop_ them with. Is _that_ wonderful enough, Miladi?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where does the _force_ come from?\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to ask.\r\n\r\nMein Herr turned quickly round, to look at the new speaker. Then he took\r\noff his spectacles, and polished them, and looked at me again, in\r\nevident bewilderment. I could see he was thinking\xe2\x80\x94as indeed _I_ was\r\nalso\xe2\x80\x94that we _must_ have met before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey use the force of _gravity_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a force known also in\r\n_your_ country, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that would need a railway going _down-hill_,\xe2\x80\x9d the Earl remarked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t have _all_ your railways going down-hill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _all_ do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot from _both_ ends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom _both_ ends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I give it up!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you explain the process?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout using that\r\nlanguage, that I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t speak fluently?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr. \xe2\x80\x9cEach railway is in a long tunnel, perfectly\r\nstraight: so of course the _middle_ of it is nearer the centre of the\r\nglobe than the two ends: so every train runs half-way _down_-hill, and\r\nthat gives it force enough to run the _other_ half _up_-hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. I understand that perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the\r\nvelocity, in the _middle_ of the tunnel, must be something _fearful_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mein Herr\xe2\x80\x99 was evidently much gratified at the intelligent interest\r\nLady Muriel took in his remarks. At every moment the old man seemed to\r\ngrow more chatty and more fluent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would like to know our methods of\r\n_driving_?\xe2\x80\x9d he smilingly enquired. \xe2\x80\x9cTo us, a run-away horse is of no\r\nimport at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel slightly shuddered. \xe2\x80\x9cTo _us_ it is a very real danger,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because your carriage is wholly _behind_ your horse. Your horse\r\nruns. Your carriage follows. Perhaps your horse has the bit in his\r\nteeth. Who shall stop him? You fly, ever faster and faster! Finally\r\ncomes the inevitable upset!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose _your_ horse manages to get the bit in his teeth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter! We would not concern ourselves. Our horse is harnessed in\r\nthe very centre of our carriage. Two wheels are in front of him, and two\r\nbehind. To the roof is attached one end of a broad belt. This goes under\r\nthe horse\xe2\x80\x99s body, and the other end is attached to a leetle\xe2\x80\x94what you\r\ncall a \xe2\x80\x98windlass,\xe2\x80\x99 I think. The horse takes the bit in his teeth. He\r\nruns away. We are flying at ten miles an hour! We turn our little\r\nwindlass, five turns, six turns, seven turns, and\xe2\x80\x94poof! Our horse is off\r\nthe ground! _Now_ let him gallop in the air, as much as he pleases: our\r\n_carriage_ stands still. We sit round him, and watch him till he is\r\ntired. Then we let him down. Our horse is glad, very much glad, when his\r\nfeet once more touch the ground!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl, who had been listening attentively. \xe2\x80\x9cAre there\r\nany other peculiarities in your carriages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the _wheels_, sometimes, my Lord. For your health, _you_ go to sea:\r\nto be pitched, to be rolled, occasionally to be drowned. _We_ do all\r\nthat on land: we are pitched, as you; we are rolled, as you; but\r\n_drowned_, no! There is no water!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are the wheels like, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are _oval_, my Lord. Therefore the carriages rise and fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and pitch the carriage backwards and forwards: but how do they\r\nmake it _roll_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do not match, my Lord. The _end_ of one wheel answers to the\r\n_side_ of the opposite wheel. So first one side of the carriage rises,\r\nthen the other. And it pitches all the while. Ah, you must be a good\r\nsailor, to drive in our boat-carriages!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can easily believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl.\r\n\r\nMein Herr rose to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cI must leave you now, Miladi,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nconsulting his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cI have another engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only wish we had stored up some extra time!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel said, as she\r\nshook hands with him. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we could have kept you a little longer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn _that_ case I would gladly stay,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mein Herr. \xe2\x80\x9cAs it is\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nfear I must say good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you first meet him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Lady Muriel, when Mein Herr had\r\nleft us. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where does he live? And what is his real name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe first\xe2\x80\x94met\xe2\x80\x94him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she musingly replied, \xe2\x80\x9creally, I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t remember\r\n_where_! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea where he lives! And I never heard any other\r\nname! It\xe2\x80\x99s very curious. It never occurred to me before to consider what\r\na mystery he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope we shall meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9che interests me very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be at our farewell-party, this day fortnight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you will come? Muriel is anxious to gather all our friends\r\naround us once more, before we leave the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he explained to me\xe2\x80\x94as Lady Muriel had left us together\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nwas so anxious to get his daughter away from a place full of so many\r\npainful memories connected with the now-canceled engagement with Major\r\nLindon, that they had arranged to have the wedding in a months time,\r\nafter which Arthur and his wife were to go on a foreign tour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget Tuesday week!\xe2\x80\x9d he said as we shook hands at parting. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nonly wish you could bring with you those charming children, that you\r\nintroduced to us in the summer. Talk of the mystery of Mein Herr! That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_nothing_ to the mystery that seems to attend _them_! I shall never\r\nforget those marvellous flowers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bring them if I possibly can,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. But how to _fulfil_ such\r\na promise, I mused to myself on my way back to our lodgings, was a\r\nproblem entirely beyond my skill!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                           IN A SHADY PLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ten days glided swiftly away: and, the day before the great party\r\nwas to take place, Arthur proposed that we should stroll down to the\r\nHall, in time for afternoon-tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better go _alone_?\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely _I_ shall be very\r\nmuch _de trop_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a kind of _experiment_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c_Fiat experimentum in\r\ncorpore vili!_\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a graceful bow of mock politeness towards\r\nthe unfortunate victim. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I shall have to bear the sight,\r\nto-morrow night, of my lady-love making herself agreable to everybody\r\n_except_ the right person, and I shall bear the agony all the better if\r\nwe have a dress-rehearsal beforehand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My_ part in the play being, apparently, that of the sample _wrong_\r\nperson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur said musingly, as we set forth: \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no such part\r\nin a regular company. \xe2\x80\x98Heavy Father\xe2\x80\x99? _That_ won\xe2\x80\x99t do: that\xe2\x80\x99s filled\r\nalready. \xe2\x80\x98Singing Chambermaid\xe2\x80\x99? Well, the \xe2\x80\x98First Lady\xe2\x80\x99 doubles _that_\r\npart. \xe2\x80\x98Comic Old Man\xe2\x80\x99? You\xe2\x80\x99re not comic enough. After all, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no part for you but the \xe2\x80\x98Well-dressed Villain\xe2\x80\x99: only,\xe2\x80\x9d with a\r\ncritical side-glance, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a _leetle_ uncertain about the dress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe found Lady Muriel alone, the Earl having gone out to make a call, and\r\nat once resumed old terms of intimacy, in the shady arbour where the\r\ntea-things seemed to be always waiting. The only novelty in the\r\narrangements (one which Lady Muriel seemed to regard as _entirely_ a\r\nmatter of course), was that two of the chairs were placed _quite_ close\r\ntogether, side by side. Strange to say, _I_ was not invited to occupy\r\n_either_ of them!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been arranging, as we came along, about letter-writing,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur\r\nbegan. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will want to know how we\xe2\x80\x99re enjoying our Swiss tour: and of\r\ncourse we must pretend we _are_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d she meekly assented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the skeleton-in-the-cupboard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94is always a difficulty,\xe2\x80\x9d she quickly put in, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling\r\nabout, and when there are no cupboards in the hotels. However, _ours_ is\r\na _very_ portable one; and will be neatly packed, in a nice leather\r\ncase\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut please don\xe2\x80\x99t think about _writing_,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\xe2\x80\x99ve anything\r\nmore attractive on hand. I delight in _reading_ letters, but I know well\r\nhow tiring it is to _write_ them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_, sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur assented. \xe2\x80\x9cFor instance, when you\xe2\x80\x99re very\r\nshy of the person you have to write to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that show itself in the _letter_?\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel enquired. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse, when I hear any one _talking_\xe2\x80\x94_you_, for instance\xe2\x80\x94I can see how\r\n_desperately_ shy he is! But can you see that in a _letter_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, when you hear any one talk _fluently_\xe2\x80\x94_you_, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94you can see how desperately _un_-shy she is\xe2\x80\x94not to say saucy!\r\nBut the shyest and most intermittent talker must _seem_ fluent in\r\nletter-writing. He may have taken half-an-hour to _compose_ his second\r\nsentence; but there it is, close after the first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen letters don\xe2\x80\x99t express all that they _might_ express?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s merely because our system of letter-writing is incomplete. A shy\r\nwriter _ought_ to be able to show that he is so. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he make\r\n_pauses_ in writing, just as he would do in speaking? He might leave\r\nblank spaces\xe2\x80\x94say half a page at a time. And a _very_ shy girl\xe2\x80\x94if there\r\n_is_ such a thing\xe2\x80\x94might write a sentence on the _first_ sheet of her\r\nletter\xe2\x80\x94then put in a couple of _blank_ sheets\xe2\x80\x94then a sentence on the\r\n_fourth_ sheet: and so on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite foresee that _we_\xe2\x80\x94I mean this clever little boy and myself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLady Muriel said to me, evidently with the kind wish to bring me into\r\nthe conversation, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94are going to become famous\xe2\x80\x94of course all our\r\ninventions are common property now\xe2\x80\x94for a new Code of Rules for\r\nLetter-writing! Please invent some more, little boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, another thing _greatly_ needed, little girl, is some way of\r\nexpressing that we _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ mean anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain yourself, little boy! Surely _you_ can find no difficulty in\r\nexpressing a _total_ absence of meaning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that you should be able, when you _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ mean a thing to be\r\ntaken seriously, to express that wish. For human nature is so\r\nconstituted that whatever you write seriously is taken as a joke, and\r\nwhatever you mean as a joke is taken seriously! At any rate, it is so in\r\nwriting to a _lady_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you\xe2\x80\x99re not used to writing to ladies!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel remarked,\r\nleaning back in her chair, and gazing thoughtfully into the sky. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshould try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many ladies may I begin writing to? As\r\nmany as I can count on the fingers of both hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs many as you can count on the _thumbs_ of _one_ hand!\xe2\x80\x9d his lady-love\r\nreplied with much severity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a _very_ naughty little boy he is!\r\n_Isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ he?\xe2\x80\x9d (with an appealing glance at me).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a little fractious,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s cutting a tooth.\xe2\x80\x9d While\r\nto myself I said \xe2\x80\x9cHow _exactly_ like Sylvie talking to Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants his tea.\xe2\x80\x9d (The naughty little boy volunteered the\r\ninformation.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s getting very tired, at the mere _prospect_ of the\r\ngreat party to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he shall have a good rest beforehand!\xe2\x80\x9d she soothingly replied.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tea isn\xe2\x80\x99t made yet. Come, little boy, lean well back in your chair,\r\nand think about nothing\xe2\x80\x94or about _me_, whichever you prefer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, all the same!\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur sleepily murmured, watching her\r\nwith loving eyes, as she moved her chair away to the tea table, and\r\nbegan to make the tea. \xe2\x80\x9cThen he\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for his tea, like a good,\r\npatient little boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I bring you the London Papers?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw them\r\nlying on the table as I came out, but my father said there was nothing\r\nin them, except that horrid murder-trial.\xe2\x80\x9d (Society was just then\r\nenjoying its daily thrill of excitement in studying the details of a\r\nspecially sensational murder in a thieves\xe2\x80\x99 den in the East of London.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no appetite for horrors,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope we have\r\nlearned the lesson they should teach us\xe2\x80\x94though we are very apt to read\r\nit backwards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98I AM SITTING AT YOUR FEET\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak in riddles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease explain yourself. See\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d suiting the action to the word, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sitting at your feet, just\r\nas if you were a second Gamaliel! Thanks, no.\xe2\x80\x9d (This was to me, who had\r\nrisen to bring her chair back to its former place.) \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb\r\nyourself. This tree and the grass make a very nice easy-chair. _What_ is\r\nthe lesson that one always reads wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur was silent for a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to be clear what it _is_ I\r\nmean,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, slowly and thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I say anything to\r\n_you_\xe2\x80\x94because you _think_ about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnything approaching to a compliment was so unusual an utterance for\r\nArthur, that it brought a flush of pleasure to her cheek, as she replied\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is _you_, that give me the ideas to think about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x99s first thought,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cin reading of anything\r\nspecially vile or barbarous, as done by a fellow-creature, is apt to be\r\nthat we see a new depth of Sin revealed _beneath_ us: and we seem to\r\ngaze down into that abyss from some higher ground, far apart from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I understand you now. You mean that one ought to think\xe2\x80\x94not\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94but \xe2\x80\x98God, be merciful\r\nto me also, who might be, but for Thy grace, a sinner as vile as he!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant a great deal more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up quickly, but checked herself, and waited in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne must begin further back, I think. Think of some other man, the same\r\nage as this poor wretch. Look back to the time when they both began\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94before they had sense enough to know Right from Wrong. _Then_, at\r\nany rate, they were equal in God\xe2\x80\x99s sight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have, then, two distinct epochs at which we may contemplate the two\r\nmen whose lives we are comparing. At the first epoch they are, so far as\r\nmoral responsibility is concerned, on precisely the same footing: they\r\nare alike incapable of doing right or wrong. At the second epoch the one\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94I am taking an extreme case, for contrast\xe2\x80\x94has won the esteem and\r\nlove of all around him: his character is stainless, and his name will be\r\nheld in honour hereafter: the other man\xe2\x80\x99s history is one unvaried record\r\nof crime, and his life is at last forfeited to the outraged laws of his\r\ncountry. Now what have been the causes, in each case, of each man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncondition being what it is at the second epoch? They are of two\r\nkinds\xe2\x80\x94one acting from within, the other from without. These two kinds\r\nneed to be discussed separately\xe2\x80\x94that is, if I have not already tired you\r\nwith my prosing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a special delight to me to\r\nhave a question discussed in this way\xe2\x80\x94analysed and arranged, so that one\r\ncan understand it. Some books, that profess to argue out a question, are\r\nto me intolerably wearisome, simply because the ideas are all arranged\r\nhap-hazard\xe2\x80\x94a sort of \xe2\x80\x98first come, first served.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very encouraging,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur replied, with a pleased look. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ncauses, acting from _within_, which make a man\xe2\x80\x99s character what it is at\r\nany given moment, are his successive acts of volition\xe2\x80\x94that is, his acts\r\nof choosing whether he will do this or that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are to assume the existence of Free-Will?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, in order to have\r\nthat point made quite clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf not,\xe2\x80\x9d was the quiet reply, \xe2\x80\x9c_cadit quaestio_: and I have no more to\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe _will_ assume it!\xe2\x80\x9d the rest of the audience\xe2\x80\x94the majority, I may say,\r\nlooking at it from Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s point of view\xe2\x80\x94imperiously proclaimed. The\r\norator proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe causes, acting from _without_, are his surroundings\xe2\x80\x94what Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer calls his \xe2\x80\x98environment.\xe2\x80\x99 Now the point I want to make\r\nclear is this, that a man is responsible for his acts of choosing, but\r\n_not_ responsible for his environment. Hence, if these two men make, on\r\nsome given occasion, when they are exposed to equal temptation, equal\r\nefforts to resist and to choose the right, their condition, in the sight\r\nof God, must be the same. If He is pleased in the one case, so will He\r\nbe in the other; if displeased in the one case, so also in the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so, no doubt: I see it quite clearly,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, owing to their different environments, the one may win a great\r\nvictory over the temptation, while the other falls into some black abyss\r\nof crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you would not say those men were equally guilty in the sight\r\nof God?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cor else I must give up my belief in God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfect justice. But let me put one more case, which will show my\r\nmeaning even more forcibly. Let the one man be in a high social\r\nposition\xe2\x80\x94the other, say, a common thief. Let the one be tempted to some\r\ntrivial act of unfair dealing\xe2\x80\x94something which he can do with the\r\nabsolute certainty that it will never be discovered\xe2\x80\x94something which he\r\ncan with perfect ease forbear from doing\xe2\x80\x94and which he distinctly knows\r\nto be a sin. Let the other be tempted to some terrible crime\xe2\x80\x94as men\r\nwould consider it\xe2\x80\x94but under an almost overwhelming pressure of\r\nmotives\xe2\x80\x94of course not _quite_ overwhelming, as that would destroy all\r\nresponsibility. Now, in this case, let the second man make a _greater_\r\neffort at resistance than the first. Also suppose _both_ to fall under\r\nthe temptation\xe2\x80\x94I say that the second man is, in God\xe2\x80\x99s sight, _less_\r\nguilty than the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel drew a long breath. \xe2\x80\x9cIt upsets all one\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of Right and\r\nWrong\xe2\x80\x94just at first! Why, in that dreadful murder-trial, you would say,\r\nI suppose, that it was possible that the least guilty man in the Court\r\nwas the murderer, and that possibly the judge who tried him, by yielding\r\nto the temptation of making one unfair remark, had committed a crime\r\noutweighing the criminal\xe2\x80\x99s whole career!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I should,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur firmly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds like a paradox,\r\nI admit. But just think what a grievous sin it must be, in God\xe2\x80\x99s sight,\r\nto yield to some very slight temptation, which we could have resisted\r\nwith perfect ease, and to do it deliberately, and in the full light of\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s Law. What penance can atone for a sin like _that_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t reject your theory,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how it seems to widen the\r\npossible area of Sin in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel anxiously enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not so, not so!\xe2\x80\x9d was the eager reply. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me it seems to clear away\r\nmuch of the cloud that hangs over the world\xe2\x80\x99s history. When this view\r\nfirst made itself clear to me, I remember walking out into the fields,\r\nrepeating to myself that line of Tennyson \xe2\x80\x98_There seemed no room for\r\nsense of wrong!_\xe2\x80\x99 The thought, that perhaps the real guilt of the human\r\nrace was infinitely less than I fancied it\xe2\x80\x94that the millions, whom I had\r\nthought of as sunk in hopeless depths of sin, were perhaps, in God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsight, scarcely sinning at all\xe2\x80\x94was more sweet than words can tell! Life\r\nseemed more bright and beautiful, when once that thought had come! \xe2\x80\x98_A\r\nlivelier emerald twinkles in the grass, A purer sapphire melts into the\r\nsea!_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d His voice trembled as he concluded, and the tears stood in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel shaded her face with her hand, and was silent for a minute.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a beautiful thought,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking up at last. \xe2\x80\x9cThank\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94Arthur, for putting it into my head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Earl returned in time to join us at tea, and to give us the very\r\nunwelcome tidings that a fever had broken out in the little harbour-town\r\nthat lay below us\xe2\x80\x94a fever of so malignant a type that, though it had\r\nonly appeared a day or two ago, there were already more than a dozen\r\ndown in it, two or three of whom were reported to be in imminent danger.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the eager questions of Arthur\xe2\x80\x94who of course took a deep\r\nscientific interest in the matter\xe2\x80\x94he could give very few _technical_\r\ndetails, though he had met the local doctor. It appeared, however, that\r\nit was an almost _new_ disease\xe2\x80\x94at least in _this_ century, though it\r\n_might_ prove to be identical with the \xe2\x80\x98Plague\xe2\x80\x99 recorded in\r\nHistory\xe2\x80\x94_very_ infectious, and frightfully rapid in its action. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will\r\nnot, however, prevent our party to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in conclusion. \xe2\x80\x9cNone\r\nof the guests belong to the infected district, which is, as you know,\r\nexclusively peopled by fishermen: so you may come without any fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur was very silent, all the way back, and, on reaching our lodgings,\r\nimmediately plunged into medical studies, connected with the alarming\r\nmalady of whose arrival we had just heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                          THE FAREWELL-PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Arthur and I reached the Hall in good time, as\r\nonly a few of the guests\xe2\x80\x94it was to be a party of eighteen\xe2\x80\x94had as yet\r\narrived; and these were talking with the Earl, leaving us the\r\nopportunity of a few words apart with our hostess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that _very_ learned-looking man with the large spectacles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nArthur enquired. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t met him here before, have I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s a new friend of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel: \xe2\x80\x9ca German, I believe.\r\nHe _is_ such a dear old thing! And quite the most learned man I ever\r\nmet\xe2\x80\x94with _one_ exception, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d she added humbly, as Arthur drew\r\nhimself up with an air of offended dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the young lady in blue, just beyond him, talking to that\r\nforeign-looking man. Is _she_ learned, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m told she\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful\r\npiano-forte-player. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear her to-night. I asked that\r\nforeigner to take her in, because _he\xe2\x80\x99s_ very musical, too. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nFrench Count, I believe; and he sings _splendidly_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScience\xe2\x80\x94music\xe2\x80\x94singing\xe2\x80\x94you have indeed got a complete party!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArthur. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel quite a privileged person, meeting all these stars. I\r\n_do_ love music!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the party isn\xe2\x80\x99t _quite_ complete!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbrought us those two beautiful children,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, turning to me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe brought them here to tea, you know, one day last summer,\xe2\x80\x9d again\r\naddressing Arthur; \xe2\x80\x9cand they _are_ such darlings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are, _indeed_,\xe2\x80\x9d I assented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you brought them with you? You promised my father you\r\n_would_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut really it was impossible to bring them\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d Here I most certainly _meant_ to conclude the sentence: and it\r\nwas with a feeling of utter amazement, which I cannot adequately\r\ndescribe, that I heard myself _going on speaking_. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94but they are to\r\njoin me here in the course of the evening\xe2\x80\x9d were the words, uttered in\r\n_my_ voice, and seeming to come from _my_ lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m _so_ glad!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel joyfully replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI _shall_ enjoy\r\nintroducing them to some of my friends here! When do you expect them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took refuge in silence. The only _honest_ reply would have been \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nwas not _my_ remark. _I_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it, and _it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true_!\xe2\x80\x9d But I had\r\nnot the moral courage to make such a confession. The character of a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98lunatic\xe2\x80\x99 is not, I believe, very difficult to _acquire_: but it is\r\namazingly difficult to _get rid of_: and it seemed quite certain that\r\nany such speech as _that_ would _quite_ justify the issue of a writ \xe2\x80\x98_de\r\nlunatico inquirendo_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLady Muriel evidently thought I had failed to hear her question, and\r\nturned to Arthur with a remark on some other subject; and I had time to\r\nrecover from my shock of surprise\xe2\x80\x94or to awake out of my momentary\r\n\xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 condition, whichever it was.\r\n\r\nWhen things around me seemed once more to be real, Arthur was saying\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid there\xe2\x80\x99s no help for it: they _must_ be finite in number.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be sorry to have to believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cYet, when\r\none comes to think of it, there _are_ no new melodies, now-a-days. What\r\npeople talk of as \xe2\x80\x98the last new song\xe2\x80\x99 always recalls to _me_ some tune\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve known as a child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day must come\xe2\x80\x94if the world lasts long enough\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nevery possible tune will have been composed\xe2\x80\x94every possible pun\r\nperpetrated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (Lady Muriel wrung her hands, like a tragedy-queen) \xe2\x80\x9cand,\r\nworse than that, every possible _book_ written! For the number of\r\n_words_ is finite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll make very little difference to the _authors_,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of saying \xe2\x80\x98_what_ book shall I write?\xe2\x80\x99 an author will ask\r\nhimself \xe2\x80\x98_which_ book shall I write?\xe2\x80\x99 A mere verbal distinction!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel gave me an approving smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBut _lunatics_ would always\r\nwrite new books, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThey _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ write the sane\r\nbooks over again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cBut _their_ books would come to an end, also. The\r\nnumber of lunatic _books_ is as finite as the number of lunatics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _that_ number is becoming greater every year,\xe2\x80\x9d said a pompous man,\r\nwhom I recognised as the self-appointed showman on the day of the\r\npicnic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, when ninety per cent. of us are\r\nlunatics,\xe2\x80\x9d (he seemed to be in a wildly nonsensical mood) \xe2\x80\x9cthe asylums\r\nwill be put to their proper use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d the pompous man gravely enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_To shelter the sane!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9c_We_ shall bar ourselves in. The\r\nlunatics will have it all their own way, _outside_. They\xe2\x80\x99ll do it a\r\nlittle queerly, no doubt. Railway-collisions will be always happening:\r\nsteamers always blowing up: most of the towns will be burnt down: most\r\nof the ships sunk\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd most of the men _killed_!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the pompous man, who was\r\nevidently hopelessly bewildered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur assented. \xe2\x80\x9cTill at last there will be _fewer_\r\nlunatics than sane men. Then _we_ come out: _they_ go in: and things\r\nreturn to their normal condition!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pompous man frowned darkly, and bit his lip, and folded his arms,\r\nvainly trying to think it out. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is _jesting_!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself\r\nat last, in a tone of withering contempt, as he stalked away.\r\n\r\nBy this time the other guests had arrived; and dinner was announced.\r\nArthur of course took down Lady Muriel: and _I_ was pleased to find\r\nmyself seated at her other side, with a severe-looking old lady (whom I\r\nhad not met before, and whose name I had, as is usual in introductions,\r\nentirely failed to catch, merely gathering that it sounded like a\r\ncompound-name) as my partner for the banquet.\r\n\r\nShe appeared, however, to be acquainted with Arthur, and confided to me\r\nin a low voice her opinion that he was \xe2\x80\x9ca very argumentative young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nArthur, for his part, seemed well inclined to show himself worthy of the\r\ncharacter she had given him, and, hearing her say \xe2\x80\x9cI never take wine\r\nwith my soup!\xe2\x80\x9d (this was _not_ a confidence to me, but was launched upon\r\nSociety, as a matter of general interest), he at once challenged a\r\ncombat by asking her \xe2\x80\x9c_when_ would you say that property _commence_ in a\r\nplate of soup?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is _my_ soup,\xe2\x80\x9d she sternly replied: \xe2\x80\x9cand what is before you is\r\n_yours_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur: \xe2\x80\x9cbut _when_ did I begin to own it? Up to the\r\nmoment of its being put into the plate, it was the property of our host:\r\nwhile being offered round the table, it was, let us say, held in trust\r\nby the waiter: did it become mine when I accepted it? Or when it was\r\nplaced before me? Or when I took the first spoonful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a _very_ argumentative young man!\xe2\x80\x9d was all the old lady would\r\nsay: but she said it audibly, this time, feeling that Society had a\r\nright to know it.\r\n\r\nArthur smiled mischievously. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind betting you a shilling,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Eminent Barrister next you\xe2\x80\x9d (It certainly _is_\r\npossible to say words so as to make them begin with capitals!) \xe2\x80\x9cca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanswer me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _never_ bet,\xe2\x80\x9d she sternly replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even sixpenny points at _whist_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Never!_\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9c_Whist_ is innocent enough: but whist played\r\nfor _money_!\xe2\x80\x9d She shuddered.\r\n\r\nArthur became serious again. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t take that view,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI consider that the introduction of small stakes for card-playing\r\nwas one of the most _moral_ acts Society ever did, _as_ Society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was it so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it took Cards, once for all, out of the category of games at\r\nwhich _cheating_ is possible. Look at the way Croquet is demoralising\r\nSociety. Ladies are beginning to cheat at it, terribly: and, if they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfound out, they only laugh, and call it fun. But when there\xe2\x80\x99s _money_ at\r\nstake, that is out of the question. The swindler is _not_ accepted as a\r\nwit. When a man sits down to cards, and cheats his friends out of their\r\nmoney, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much _fun_ out of it\xe2\x80\x94unless he thinks it fun to be\r\nkicked down stairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all gentlemen thought as badly of ladies as _you_ do,\xe2\x80\x9d my neighbour\r\nremarked with some bitterness, \xe2\x80\x9cthere would be very few\xe2\x80\x94very few\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nseemed doubtful how to end her sentence, but at last took \xe2\x80\x9choneymoons\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas a safe word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, the mischievous smile returning to his\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x9cif only people would adopt _my_ theory, the number of\r\nhoneymoons\xe2\x80\x94quite of a new kind\xe2\x80\x94would be greatly increased!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay we hear about this new kind of honeymoon?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet _X_ be the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur began, in a slightly raised voice, as\r\nhe now found himself with an audience of _six_, including \xe2\x80\x98Mein Herr,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwho was seated at the other side of my polynomial partner. \xe2\x80\x9cLet _X_ be\r\nthe gentleman, and _Y_ the lady to whom he thinks of proposing. He\r\napplies for an Experimental Honeymoon. It is granted. Forthwith the\r\nyoung couple\xe2\x80\x94accompanied by the great-aunt of _Y_, to act as\r\nchaperone\xe2\x80\x94start for a month\xe2\x80\x99s tour, during which they have many a\r\nmoonlight-walk, and many a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ conversation, and each can form\r\na more correct estimate of the other\xe2\x80\x99s character, in four _weeks_, than\r\nwould have been possible in as many _years_, when meeting under the\r\nordinary restrictions of Society. And it is only after their _return_\r\nthat _X_ finally decides whether he will, or will not, put the momentous\r\nquestion to _Y_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn nine cases out of ten,\xe2\x80\x9d the pompous man proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9che would decide\r\nto break it off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, in nine cases out of ten,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9can unsuitable match\r\nwould be prevented, and _both_ parties saved from misery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only really _unsuitable_ matches,\xe2\x80\x9d the old lady remarked, \xe2\x80\x9care\r\nthose made without sufficient _Money_. Love may come _afterwards_. Money\r\nis needed _to begin with_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis remark was cast loose upon Society, as a sort of general challenge;\r\nand, as such, it was at once accepted by several of those within\r\nhearing: _Money_ became the key-note of the conversation for some time;\r\nand a fitful echo of it was again heard, when the dessert had been\r\nplaced upon the table, the servants had left the room, and the Earl had\r\nstarted the wine in its welcome progress round the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad to see you keep up the old customs,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Lady\r\nMuriel as I filled her glass. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really delightful to experience,\r\nonce more, the peaceful feeling that comes over one when the waiters\r\nhave left the room\xe2\x80\x94when one can converse without the feeling of being\r\noverheard, and without having dishes constantly thrust over one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder. How much more sociable it is to be able to pour out the wine\r\nfor the ladies, and to hand the dishes to those who wish for them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, kindly send those peaches down here,\xe2\x80\x9d said a fat\r\nred-faced man, who was seated beyond our pompous friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nwishing for them\xe2\x80\x94diagonally\xe2\x80\x94for some time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it _is_ a ghastly innovation,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel replied, \xe2\x80\x9cletting the\r\nwaiters carry round the wine at dessert. For one thing, they _always_\r\ntake it the wrong way round\xe2\x80\x94which of course brings bad luck to\r\n_everybody_ present!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter go the _wrong_ way than not go _at all_!\xe2\x80\x9d said our host. \xe2\x80\x9cWould\r\nyou kindly help yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d (This was to the fat red-faced man.) \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nnot a teetotaler, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed but I _am_!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, as he pushed on the bottles. \xe2\x80\x9cNearly\r\ntwice as much money is spent in England on _Drink_, as on any other\r\narticle of food. Read this card.\xe2\x80\x9d (What faddist ever goes about without\r\na pocketful of the appropriate literature?) \xe2\x80\x9cThe stripes of different\r\ncolours represent the amounts spent on various articles of food. Look at\r\nthe highest three. Money spent on butter and on cheese, thirty-five\r\nmillions: on bread, seventy millions: on _intoxicating liquors_, one\r\nhundred and thirty-six millions! If I had my way, I would close every\r\npublic-house in the land! Look at that card, and read the motto. _That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhere all the money goes to!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen the _Anti-Teetotal Card_?\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur innocently enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir, I have not!\xe2\x80\x9d the orator savagely replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost exactly like this one. The coloured stripes are the same. Only,\r\ninstead of the words \xe2\x80\x98Money spent on,\xe2\x80\x99 it has \xe2\x80\x98Incomes derived from sale\r\nof\xe2\x80\x99; and, instead of \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s where all the money goes to,\xe2\x80\x99 its motto is\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_That\xe2\x80\x99s where all the money comes from!_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe red-faced man scowled, but evidently considered Arthur beneath his\r\nnotice. So Lady Muriel took up the cudgels. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hold the theory,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cthat people can preach teetotalism more effectually by\r\nbeing teetotalers themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I do!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the red-faced man. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, here is a case in\r\npoint,\xe2\x80\x9d unfolding a newspaper-cutting: \xe2\x80\x9clet me read you this letter from\r\na teetotaler. _To the Editor. Sir, I was once a moderate drinker, and\r\nknew a man who drank to excess. I went to him. \xe2\x80\x98Give up this drink,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98It will ruin your health!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You drink,\xe2\x80\x99 he said: \xe2\x80\x98why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98but I know when to leave off.\xe2\x80\x99 He turned away from\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x98You drink in your way,\xe2\x80\x99 he said: \xe2\x80\x98let me drink in mine. Be off!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen I saw that, to do any good with him, I must forswear drink. From\r\nthat hour I haven\xe2\x80\x99t touched a drop!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! What do you say to _that_?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked round triumphantly, while\r\nthe cutting was handed round for inspection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very curious!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Arthur, when it had reached him. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you\r\nhappen to see a letter, last week, about early rising? It was strangely\r\nlike this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe red-faced man\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity was roused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did it appear?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me read it to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. He took some papers from his\r\npocket, opened one of them, and read as follows. \xe2\x80\x9c_To the Editor. Sir, I\r\nwas once a moderate sleeper, and knew a man who slept to excess. I\r\npleaded with him. \xe2\x80\x98Give up this lying in bed,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98It will ruin\r\nyour health!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You go to bed,\xe2\x80\x99 he said: \xe2\x80\x98why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98but I know when to get up in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99 He turned away from\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x98You sleep in your way,\xe2\x80\x99 he said: \xe2\x80\x98let me sleep in mine. Be off!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen I saw that to do any good with him, I must forswear sleep. From\r\nthat hour I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to bed!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur folded and pocketed his paper, and passed on the\r\nnewspaper-cutting. None of us dared to laugh, the red-faced man was\r\nevidently so angry. \xe2\x80\x9cYour parallel doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run on all fours!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsnarled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Moderate_ drinkers never do so!\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur quietly replied. Even the\r\nstern old lady laughed at this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it needs many other things to make a _perfect_ dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady\r\nMuriel, evidently anxious to change the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cMein Herr! What is\r\n_your_ idea of a perfect dinner-party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man looked round smilingly, and his gigantic spectacles seemed\r\nmore gigantic than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cA _perfect_ dinner-party?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, it must be presided over by our present hostess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, of _course_!\xe2\x80\x9d she gaily interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what _else_, Mein Herr?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can but tell you what I have seen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr, \xe2\x80\x9cin mine own\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe country I have traveled in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused for a full minute, and gazed steadily at the ceiling\xe2\x80\x94with so\r\ndreamy an expression on his face, that I feared he was going off into a\r\nreverie, which seemed to be his normal state. However, after a minute,\r\nhe suddenly began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat which chiefly causes the failure of a dinner-party, is the\r\nrunning-short\xe2\x80\x94not of meat, nor yet of drink, but of _conversation_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn an _English_ dinner-party,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never known\r\n_small-talk_ run short!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr respectfully replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98small-talk.\xe2\x80\x99 I said \xe2\x80\x98conversation.\xe2\x80\x99 All such topics as the weather, or\r\npolitics, or local gossip, are unknown among us. They are either vapid\r\nor controversial. What we need for _conversation_ is a topic of\r\n_interest_ and of _novelty_. To secure these things we have tried\r\nvarious plans\xe2\x80\x94Moving-Pictures, Wild-Creatures, Moving-Guests, and a\r\nRevolving-Humorist. But this last is only adapted to _small_ parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us have it in four separate Chapters, please!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel,\r\nwho was evidently deeply interested\xe2\x80\x94as, indeed, most of the party were,\r\nby this time: and, all down the table, talk had ceased, and heads were\r\nleaning forwards, eager to catch fragments of Mein Herr\xe2\x80\x99s oration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChapter One! Moving-Pictures!\xe2\x80\x9d was proclaimed in the silvery voice of\r\nour hostess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dining-table is shaped like a circular ring,\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr began, in\r\nlow dreamy tones, which, however, were perfectly audible in the silence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe guests are seated at the inner side as well as the outer, having\r\nascended to their places by a winding-staircase, from the room below.\r\nAlong the middle of the table runs a little railway; and there is an\r\nendless train of trucks, worked round by machinery; and on each truck\r\nthere are two pictures, leaning back to back. The train makes two\r\ncircuits during dinner; and, when it has been _once_ round, the waiters\r\nturn the pictures round in each truck, making them face the other way.\r\nThus _every_ guest sees _every_ picture!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and the silence seemed deader than ever. Lady Muriel looked\r\naghast. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, if this goes on,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to drop\r\na pin! Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ fault, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d (In answer to an appealing look from\r\nMein Herr.) \xe2\x80\x9cI was forgetting my duty. Chapter Two! Wild-Creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe found the Moving-Pictures a _little_ monotonous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople didn\xe2\x80\x99t care to talk Art through a whole dinner; so we tried\r\nWild-Creatures. Among the flowers, which we laid (just as _you_ do)\r\nabout the table, were to be seen, here a mouse, there a beetle; here a\r\nspider,\xe2\x80\x9d (Lady Muriel shuddered) \xe2\x80\x9cthere a wasp; here a toad, there a\r\nsnake;\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cFather!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel, plaintively. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear\r\n_that_?\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cso we had plenty to talk about!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when you got stung\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the old lady began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were all chained-up, dear Madam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the old lady gave a satisfied nod.\r\n\r\nThere was no silence to follow, _this_ time. \xe2\x80\x9cThird Chapter!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady\r\nMuriel proclaimed at once, \xe2\x80\x9cMoving-Guests!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven the Wild-Creatures proved monotonous,\xe2\x80\x9d the orator proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nwe left the guests to choose their own subjects; and, to avoid monotony,\r\nwe changed _them_. We made the table of _two_ rings; and the inner ring\r\nmoved slowly round, all the time, along with the floor in the middle and\r\nthe inner row of guests. Thus _every_ inner guest was brought\r\nface-to-face with _every_ outer guest. It was a little confusing,\r\nsometimes, to have to _begin_ a story to one friend and _finish_ it to\r\nanother; but _every_ plan has its faults, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFourth Chapter!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel hastened to announce. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nRevolving-Humorist!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a _small_ party we found it an excellent plan to have a round\r\ntable, with a hole cut in the middle large enough to hold _one_ guest.\r\nHere we placed our _best_ talker. He revolved slowly, facing every other\r\nguest in turn: and he told lively anecdotes the whole time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the pompous man. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would make me\r\ngiddy, revolving like that! I should decline to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d here it appeared to\r\ndawn upon him that perhaps the assumption he was making was not\r\nwarranted by the circumstances: he took a hasty gulp of wine, and choked\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut Mein Herr had relapsed into reverie, and made no further remark.\r\nLady Muriel gave the signal, and the ladies left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                           JABBERING AND JAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the last lady had disappeared, and the Earl, taking his place at\r\nthe head of the table, had issued the military order \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen! Close\r\nup the ranks, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d, and when, in obedience to his command, we\r\nhad gathered ourselves compactly round him, the pompous man gave a deep\r\nsigh of relief, filled his glass to the brim, pushed on the wine, and\r\nbegan one of his favorite orations. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are charming, no doubt!\r\nCharming, but very frivolous. They drag us down, so to speak, to a lower\r\nlevel. They\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not all pronouns require antecedent _nouns_?\xe2\x80\x9d the Earl gently\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pompous man, with lofty condescension. \xe2\x80\x9cI had\r\noverlooked the noun. The ladies. We regret their absence. Yet we console\r\nourselves. _Thought is free._ With them, we are limited to _trivial_\r\ntopics\xe2\x80\x94Art, Literature, Politics, and so forth. One can bear to discuss\r\n_such_ paltry matters with a lady. But no man, in his senses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\nlooked sternly round the table, as if defying contradiction) \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94ever yet\r\ndiscussed _WINE_ with a lady!\xe2\x80\x9d He sipped his glass of port, leaned back\r\nin his chair, and slowly raised it up to his eye, so as to look through\r\nit at the lamp. \xe2\x80\x9cThe vintage, my Lord?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired, glancing at his\r\nhost.\r\n\r\nThe Earl named the date.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I had supposed. But one likes to be certain. The _tint_ is, perhaps,\r\nslightly pale. But the _body_ is unquestionable. And as for the\r\n_bouquet_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, that magic Bouquet! How vividly that single word recalled the scene!\r\nThe little beggar-boy turning his somersault in the road\xe2\x80\x94the sweet\r\nlittle crippled maiden in my arms\xe2\x80\x94the mysterious evanescent\r\nnurse-maid\xe2\x80\x94all rushed tumultuously into my mind, like the creatures of a\r\ndream: and through this mental haze there still boomed on, like the\r\ntolling of a bell, the solemn voice of the great connoisseur of _WINE_!\r\n\r\nEven _his_ utterances had taken on themselves a strange and dream-like\r\nform. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed\xe2\x80\x94and _why_ is it, I pause to ask, that, in taking\r\nup the broken thread of a dialogue, one _always_ begins with this\r\ncheerless monosyllable? After much anxious thought, I have come to the\r\nconclusion that the object in view is the same as that of the schoolboy,\r\nwhen the sum he is working has got into a hopeless muddle, and when in\r\ndespair he takes the sponge, washes it all out, and begins again. Just\r\nin the same way the bewildered orator, by the simple process of denying\r\n_everything_ that has been hitherto asserted, makes a clean sweep of the\r\nwhole discussion, and can \xe2\x80\x98start fair\xe2\x80\x99 with a fresh theory. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nresumed: \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like cherry-jam, after all. That\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_\r\nsay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for _all_ qualities!\xe2\x80\x9d an eager little man shrilly interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\n_richness_ of general tone I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that it _has_ a rival. But for\r\n_delicacy_ of modulation\xe2\x80\x94for what one may call the \xe2\x80\x98_harmonics_\xe2\x80\x99 of\r\nflavour\xe2\x80\x94give _me_ good old _raspberry_-jam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me one word!\xe2\x80\x9d The fat red-faced man, quite hoarse with\r\nexcitement, broke into the dialogue. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too important a question to\r\nbe settled by Amateurs! I can give you the views of a\r\n_Professional_\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the most experienced jam-taster now living. Why,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve known him fix the age of strawberry-jam, to a _day_\xe2\x80\x94and we all know\r\nwhat a difficult jam it is to give a date to\xe2\x80\x94on a single tasting! Well,\r\nI put to him the _very_ question you are discussing. His words were\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_cherry_-jam is best, for mere _chiaroscuro_ of flavour:\r\n_raspberry_-jam lends itself best to those resolved discords that linger\r\nso lovingly on the tongue: but, for rapturous _utterness_ of saccharine\r\nperfection, it\xe2\x80\x99s _apricot-jam first and the rest nowhere_!\xe2\x80\x99 That was\r\nwell put, _wasn\xe2\x80\x99t_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsummately put!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the eager little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your friend well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pompous man. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a jam-taster, he\r\nhas no rival! Yet I scarcely think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut here the discussion became general: and his words were lost in a\r\nconfused medley of names, every guest sounding the praises of his own\r\nfavorite jam. At length, through the din, our host\xe2\x80\x99s voice made itself\r\nheard. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us join the ladies!\xe2\x80\x9d These words seemed to recall me to\r\nwaking life; and I felt sure that, for the last few minutes, I had\r\nrelapsed into the \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 state.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange dream!\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself as we trooped upstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cGrown men\r\ndiscussing, as seriously as if they were matters of life and death, the\r\nhopelessly trivial details of mere _delicacies_, that appeal to no\r\nhigher human function than the nerves of the tongue and palate! What a\r\nhumiliating spectacle such a discussion would be in waking life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen, on our way to the drawing-room, I received from the housekeeper my\r\nlittle friends, clad in the daintiest of evening costumes, and looking,\r\nin the flush of expectant delight, more radiantly beautiful than I had\r\never seen them before, I felt no shock of surprise, but accepted the\r\nfact with the same unreasoning apathy with which one meets the events of\r\na dream, and was merely conscious of a vague anxiety as to how they\r\nwould acquit themselves in so novel a scene\xe2\x80\x94forgetting that Court-life\r\nin Outland was as good training as they could need for Society in the\r\nmore substantial world.\r\n\r\nIt would be best, I thought, to introduce them as soon as possible to\r\nsome good-natured lady-guest, and I selected the young lady whose\r\npiano-forte-playing had been so much talked of. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you like\r\nchildren,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I introduce two little friends of mine? This is\r\nSylvie\xe2\x80\x94and this is Bruno.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady kissed Sylvie very graciously. She would have done the\r\nsame for _Bruno_, but he hastily drew back out of reach. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir faces\r\nare new to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had not anticipated so inconvenient a question; and, fearing that it\r\nmight embarrass Sylvie, I answered for her. \xe2\x80\x9cThey come from some\r\ndistance. They are only here just for this one evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far have you come, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d the young lady persisted.\r\n\r\nSylvie looked puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cA mile or two, I _think_,\xe2\x80\x9d she said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mile or _three_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98a mile or _three_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie corrected him.\r\n\r\nThe young lady nodded approval. \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie\xe2\x80\x99s quite right. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t usual to\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x98a mile or _three_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be usual\xe2\x80\x94if we said it often enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\nIt was the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s turn to look puzzled now. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very quick, for\r\nhis age!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not more than seven, are you, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so many as _that_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m _one_. Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s _one_.\r\nSylvie and me is _two_. _Sylvie_ taught me to count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t _counting_ you, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d the young lady laughingly\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t oo _learnt_ to count?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\nThe young lady bit her lip. \xe2\x80\x9cDear! What embarrassing questions he _does_\r\nask!\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a half-audible \xe2\x80\x98aside.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBruno, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said reprovingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _what_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask\xe2\x80\x94that sort of questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ sort of questions?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno mischievously persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _she_ told you not,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie replied, with a shy glance at the\r\nyoung lady, and losing all sense of grammar in her confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t pronounce it!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno triumphantly cried. And he turned to the\r\nyoung lady, for sympathy in his victory. \xe2\x80\x9cI _knewed_ she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npronounce \xe2\x80\x98umbrella-sting\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady thought it best to return to the arithmetical problem.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I asked if you were _seven_, you know, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean \xe2\x80\x98how many\r\n_children_?\xe2\x80\x99 I meant \xe2\x80\x98how many _years_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly got _two_ ears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s got _seven_ ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you belong to this little girl?\xe2\x80\x9d the young lady continued,\r\nskilfully evading the anatomical problem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I doosn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to _her_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie belongs to _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he clasped his arms round her as he added \xe2\x80\x9cShe are my very mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a little sister at home,\r\nexactly like _your_ sister? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99d love each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d be very extremely useful to each other,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said,\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want no looking-glasses to brush their\r\nhair wiz.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, my child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, each one would do for the other one\xe2\x80\x99s looking-glass, a-course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Bruno.\r\n\r\nBut here Lady Muriel, who had been standing by, listening to this\r\nbewildering dialogue, interrupted it to ask if the young lady would\r\nfavour us with some music; and the children followed their new friend to\r\nthe piano.\r\n\r\nArthur came and sat down by me. \xe2\x80\x9cIf rumour speaks truly,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe are to have a real treat!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, amid a breathless silence, the\r\nperformance began.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those players whom Society talks of as \xe2\x80\x98brilliant,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nshe dashed into the loveliest of Haydn\xe2\x80\x99s Symphonies in a style that was\r\nclearly the outcome of years of patient study under the best masters. At\r\nfirst it seemed to be the perfection of piano-forte-playing; but in a\r\nfew minutes I began to ask myself, wearily, \xe2\x80\x9c_What_ is it that is\r\nwanting? _Why_ does one get no pleasure from it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I set myself to listen intently to every note; and the mystery\r\nexplained itself. There _was_ an almost-perfect mechanical\r\n_correctness_\xe2\x80\x94and there was nothing else! False notes, of course, did\r\nnot occur: she knew the piece too well for _that_; but there was just\r\nenough irregularity of _time_ to betray that the player had no real\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ear\xe2\x80\x99 for music\xe2\x80\x94just enough inarticulateness in the more elaborate\r\npassages to show that she did not think her audience worth taking real\r\npains for\xe2\x80\x94just enough mechanical monotony of accent to take all _soul_\r\nout of the heavenly modulations she was profaning\xe2\x80\x94in short, it was\r\nsimply irritating; and, when she had rattled off the finale and had\r\nstruck the final chord as if, the instrument being now done with, it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how many wires she broke, I could not even _affect_ to\r\njoin in the stereotyped \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _thank_ you!\xe2\x80\x9d which was chorused around me.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel joined us for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it _beautiful_?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered, to Arthur, with a mischievous smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. But the gentle sweetness of his face quite\r\nneutralised the apparent rudeness of the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch execution, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what she _deserves_,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur doggedly replied: \xe2\x80\x9cbut people are\r\nso prejudiced against capital\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to talk nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel cried. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\r\n_do_ like Music, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? You said so just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I like _Music_?\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor repeated softly to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nLady Muriel, there is Music and Music. Your question is painfully vague.\r\nYou might as well ask \xe2\x80\x98Do you like _People_?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel bit her lip, frowned, and stamped with one tiny foot. As a\r\ndramatic representation of ill-temper, it was distinctly _not_ a\r\nsuccess. However, it took in _one_ of her audience, and Bruno hastened\r\nto interpose, as peacemaker in a rising quarrel, with the remark \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\r\nlikes Peoples!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur laid a loving hand on the little curly head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? _All_\r\nPeoples?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _all_ Peoples,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno explained. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly but Sylvie\xe2\x80\x94and Lady\r\nMuriel\xe2\x80\x94and him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to the Earl) \xe2\x80\x9cand oo\xe2\x80\x94and oo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t point at people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very rude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s World,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are only _four_ People\xe2\x80\x94worth\r\nmentioning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s World!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel repeated thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cA bright and\r\nflowery world. Where the grass is always green, where the breezes always\r\nblow softly, and the rain-clouds never gather; where there are no wild\r\nbeasts, and no deserts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _must_ be deserts,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur decisively remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least if it\r\nwas _my_ ideal world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what possible use is there in a _desert_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Surely_ you would have no wilderness in your ideal world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut indeed I _would_!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA wilderness would be\r\nmore necessary than a railway; and _far_ more conducive to general\r\nhappiness than church-bells!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what would you use it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_To practise music in_,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the young ladies, that have\r\nno ear for music, but insist on learning it, should be conveyed, every\r\nmorning, two or three miles into the wilderness. There each would find a\r\ncomfortable room provided for her, and also a cheap second-hand\r\npiano-forte, on which she might play for hours, without adding one\r\nneedless pang to the sum of human misery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel glanced round in alarm, lest these barbarous sentiments\r\nshould be overheard. But the fair musician was at a safe distance. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nany rate you must allow that she\xe2\x80\x99s a sweet girl?\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly. As sweet as _eau sucr\xc3\xa9e_, if you choose\xe2\x80\x94and nearly as\r\ninteresting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are incorrigible!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel, and turned to me. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\r\nfound Mrs. Mills an interesting companion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ her name, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI fancied there was _more_ of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there is: and it will be \xe2\x80\x98at your proper peril\xe2\x80\x99 (whatever that may\r\nmean) if you ever presume to address her as \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Mills.\xe2\x80\x99 She is \xe2\x80\x98Mrs.\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x94Atkinson\xe2\x80\x94Mills\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is one of those would-be grandees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cwho think that,\r\nby tacking on to their surname all their spare Christian-names, with\r\nhyphens between, they can give it an aristocratic flavour. As if it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble enough to remember _one_ surname!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the room was getting crowded, as the guests, invited for\r\nthe evening-party, were beginning to arrive, and Lady Muriel had to\r\ndevote herself to the task of welcoming them, which she did with the\r\nsweetest grace imaginable. Sylvie and Bruno stood by her, deeply\r\ninterested in the process.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you like my friends?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to them. \xe2\x80\x9cSpecially my dear old\r\nfriend, Mein Herr (What\xe2\x80\x99s become of him, I wonder? Oh, there he is!),\r\nthat old gentleman in spectacles, with a long beard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a grand old gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, gazing admiringly at \xe2\x80\x98Mein\r\nHerr,\xe2\x80\x99 who had settled down in a corner, from which his mild eyes beamed\r\non us through a gigantic pair of spectacles. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a lovely beard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he call his-self?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe calls himself \xe2\x80\x98Mein Herr,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie whispered in reply.\r\n\r\nBruno shook his head impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what he calls his _hair_, not\r\nhis _self_, oo silly!\xe2\x80\x9d He appealed to me. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat doos he call his _self_,\r\nMister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the only name _I_ know of,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he looks very lonely.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you pity his grey hairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pities his _self_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, still harping on the misnomer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\ndoosn\xe2\x80\x99t pity his _hair_, one bit. His _hair_ ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t feel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe met him this afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d been to see Nero, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d had _such_ fun with him, making him invisible again! And we saw\r\nthat nice old gentleman as we came back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s go and talk to him, and cheer him up a little,\xe2\x80\x9d I said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand perhaps we shall find out what he calls himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                          THE MAN IN THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children came willingly. With one of them on each side of me, I\r\napproached the corner occupied by \xe2\x80\x98Mein Herr.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t object to\r\n_children_, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Crabbed age and youth cannot live together!_\xe2\x80\x9d the old man cheerfully\r\nreplied, with a most genial smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNow take a good look at me, my\r\nchildren! You would guess me to be an _old_ man, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first sight, though his face had reminded me so mysteriously of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nProfessor,\xe2\x80\x9d he had seemed to be decidedly a _younger_ man: but, when I\r\ncame to look into the wonderful depth of those large dreamy eyes, I\r\nfelt, with a strange sense of awe, that he was incalculably _older_: he\r\nseemed to gaze at us out of some by-gone age, centuries away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEIN HERR\xe2\x80\x99S FAIRY-FRIENDS]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if oo\xe2\x80\x99re an _old_ man,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno answered, as the children,\r\nwon over by the gentle voice, crept a little closer to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI thinks\r\noo\xe2\x80\x99re _eighty-three_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very exact!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he anything like right?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr gently replied, \xe2\x80\x9creasons which I am not\r\nat liberty to explain, for not mentioning _definitely_ any Persons,\r\nPlaces, or Dates. One remark only I will permit myself to make\xe2\x80\x94that the\r\nperiod of life, between the ages of a hundred-and-sixty-five and a\r\nhundred-and-seventy-five, is a specially _safe_ one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you make that out?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus. You would consider swimming to be a very safe amusement, if you\r\nscarcely ever heard of any one dying of it. Am I not right in thinking\r\nthat you never heard of any one dying between those two ages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t prove\r\n_swimming_ to be safe, on the same principle. It is no uncommon thing to\r\nhear of some one being _drowned_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn _my_ country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr, \xe2\x80\x9cno one is _ever_ drowned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no water deep enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty! But we ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t _sink_. We are all _lighter than water_. Let me\r\nexplain,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, seeing my look of surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you desire a\r\nrace of _pigeons_ of a particular shape or colour, do you not select,\r\nfrom year to year, those that are nearest to the shape or colour you\r\nwant, and keep those, and part with the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWe call it \xe2\x80\x98Artificial Selection.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, _we_ have practised that for some\r\ncenturies\xe2\x80\x94constantly selecting the _lightest_ people: so that, now,\r\n_everybody_ is lighter than water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you never can be drowned at _sea_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! It is only on the _land_\xe2\x80\x94for instance, when attending a play in\r\na theatre\xe2\x80\x94that we are in such a danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can that happen at a _theatre_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur theatres are all _underground_. Large tanks of water are placed\r\nabove. If a fire breaks out, the taps are turned, and in one minute the\r\ntheatre is flooded, up to the very roof! Thus the fire is extinguished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_And_ the audience, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a minor matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr carelessly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they have\r\nthe comfort of knowing that, whether drowned or not, they are all\r\n_lighter than water_. We have not yet reached the standard of making\r\npeople lighter than _air_: but we are _aiming_ at it; and, in another\r\nthousand years or so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat doos oo do wiz the peoples that\xe2\x80\x99s too heavy?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno solemnly\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have applied the same process,\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr continued, not noticing\r\nBruno\xe2\x80\x99s question, \xe2\x80\x9cto many other purposes. We have gone on selecting\r\n_walking-sticks_\xe2\x80\x94always keeping those that walked _best_\xe2\x80\x94till we have\r\nobtained some, that can walk by themselves! We have gone on selecting\r\n_cotton-wool_, till we have got some lighter than air! You\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea\r\nwhat a useful material it is! We call it \xe2\x80\x98Imponderal.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you use it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, chiefly for _packing_ articles, to go by Parcel-Post. It makes\r\nthem weigh _less than nothing_, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do the Post-Office people know what you have to pay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty of the new system!\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr cried exultingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\npay _us_: we don\xe2\x80\x99t pay _them_! I\xe2\x80\x99ve often got as much as five shillings\r\nfor sending a parcel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut doesn\xe2\x80\x99t your Government object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they _do_ object, a little. They say it comes so expensive, in\r\nthe long run. But the thing\xe2\x80\x99s as clear as daylight, by their own rules.\r\nIf I send a parcel, that weighs a pound _more_ than nothing, I _pay_\r\nthree-pence: so, of course, if it weighs a pound _less_ than nothing, I\r\nought to _receive_ three-pence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is _indeed_ a useful article!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet even \xe2\x80\x98Imponderal\xe2\x80\x99 has its disadvantages,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI bought\r\nsome, a few days ago, and put it into my _hat_, to carry it home, and\r\nthe hat simply floated away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad oo some of that funny stuff in oor hat _today_?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno enquired.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSylvie and me saw oo in the road, and oor hat were ever so high up!\r\nWeren\xe2\x80\x99t it, Sylvie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that was quite another thing.\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a drop or\r\ntwo of rain falling: so I put my hat on the top of my stick\xe2\x80\x94as an\r\numbrella, you know. As I came along the road,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, turning to\r\nme, \xe2\x80\x9cI was overtaken by\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94a shower of rain?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it _looked_ more like the tail of a dog,\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas the most curious thing! Something rubbed affectionately against my\r\nknee. And I looked down. And I could see _nothing_! Only, about a yard\r\noff, there was a dog\xe2\x80\x99s tail, wagging, all by itself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _Sylvie_!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno murmured reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cOo didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish making\r\nhim visible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m _so_ sorry!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, looking very penitent. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant to rub it\r\nalong his back, but we were in such a hurry. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go and finish him\r\ntomorrow. Poor thing! Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll get no supper tonight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Course_ he won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody never gives bones to a dog\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntail!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMein Herr looked from one to the other in blank astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not\r\nunderstand you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had lost my way, and I was consulting a\r\npocket-map, and somehow I had dropped one of my gloves, and this\r\ninvisible _Something_, that had rubbed against my knee, actually brought\r\nit back to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse he did!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s _welly_ fond of fetching things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMein Herr looked so thoroughly bewildered that I thought it best to\r\nchange the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a useful thing a pocket-map is!\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from _your_ Nation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmap-making. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve carried it much further than _you_. What do you\r\nconsider the _largest_ map that would be really useful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout six inches to the mile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly _six inches_!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mein Herr. \xe2\x80\x9cWe very soon got to six\r\n_yards_ to the mile. Then we tried a _hundred_ yards to the mile. And\r\nthen came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map of the\r\ncountry, on the scale of _a mile to the mile_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you used it much?\xe2\x80\x9d I enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has never been spread out, yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr: \xe2\x80\x9cthe farmers\r\nobjected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the\r\nsunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure\r\nyou it does nearly as well. Now let me ask you _another_ question. What\r\nis the smallest _world_ you would care to inhabit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ know!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno, who was listening intently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like a little\r\nteeny-tiny world, just big enough for Sylvie and me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you would have to stand on opposite sides of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you would never see your sister _at all_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99d have no _lessons_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying experiments in _that_\r\ndirection!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not _experiments_ exactly. We do not profess to _construct_\r\nplanets. But a scientific friend of mine, who has made several\r\nballoon-voyages, assures me he has visited a planet so small that he\r\ncould walk right round it in twenty minutes! There had been a great\r\nbattle, just before his visit, which had ended rather oddly: the\r\nvanquished army ran away at full speed, and in a very few minutes found\r\nthemselves face-to-face with the victorious army, who were marching home\r\nagain, and who were so frightened at finding themselves between _two_\r\narmies, that they surrendered at once! Of course that lost them the\r\nbattle, though, as a matter of fact, they had killed _all_ the soldiers\r\non the other side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKilled soldiers _ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ run away,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno thoughtfully remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Killed\xe2\x80\x99 is a technical word,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mein Herr. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the little planet\r\nI speak of, the bullets were made of soft black stuff, which marked\r\neverything it touched. So, after a battle, all you had to do was to\r\ncount how many soldiers on each side were \xe2\x80\x98killed\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that means \xe2\x80\x98marked on\r\nthe _back_,\xe2\x80\x99 for marks in _front_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98kill\xe2\x80\x99 any, unless they ran away?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy scientific friend found out a better plan than _that_. He pointed\r\nout that, if only the bullets were sent _the other way round the world_,\r\nthey would hit the enemy in the _back_. After that, the _worst_ marksmen\r\nwere considered the _best_ soldiers; and _the very worst of all_ always\r\ngot First Prize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did you decide which was _the very worst of all_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasily. The _best_ possible shooting is, you know, to hit what is\r\nexactly in _front_ of you: so of course the _worst_ possible is to hit\r\nwhat is exactly _behind_ you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were strange people in that little planet!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were indeed! Perhaps their method of _government_ was the\r\nstrangest of all. In _this_ planet, I am told, a Nation consists of a\r\nnumber of Subjects, and one King: but, in the little planet I speak of,\r\nit consisted of a number of _Kings_, and one _Subject_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you are \xe2\x80\x98told\xe2\x80\x99 what happens in _this_ planet,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I\r\nventure to guess that you yourself are a visitor from some _other_\r\nplanet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno clapped his hands in his excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cIs oo the Man-in-the-Moon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe cried.\r\n\r\nMein Herr looked uneasy. \xe2\x80\x9cI am _not_ in the Moon, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nevasively. \xe2\x80\x9cTo return to what I was saying. I think _that_ method of\r\ngovernment ought to answer _well_. You see, the Kings would be sure to\r\nmake Laws contradicting each other: so the Subject could never be\r\npunished, because, _whatever_ he did, he\xe2\x80\x99d be obeying _some_ Law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, whatever he did, he\xe2\x80\x99d be _dis_obeying _some_ Law!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he\xe2\x80\x99d _always_ be punished!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel was passing at the moment, and caught the last word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to be punished _here_!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking Bruno in her\r\narms. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Liberty-Hall! Would you lend me the children for a\r\nminute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children desert us, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Mein Herr, as she carried\r\nthem off: \xe2\x80\x9cso we old folk must keep each other company!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! We\xe2\x80\x99re old folk _now_; and yet I was a\r\nchild myself, once\xe2\x80\x94at least I fancy so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt _did_ seem a rather unlikely fancy, I could not help owning to\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94looking at the shaggy white hair, and the long beard\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\ncould _ever_ have been a child. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are fond of young people?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung _men_,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cNot of _children_ exactly. I used to teach\r\nyoung men\xe2\x80\x94many a year ago\xe2\x80\x94in my dear old University!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite catch its _name_?\xe2\x80\x9d I hinted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not name it,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man replied mildly. \xe2\x80\x9cNor would you know the\r\nname if I did. Strange tales I could tell you of all the changes I have\r\nwitnessed there! But it would weary you, I fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, _indeed_!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cPray go on. What kind of changes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the old man seemed to be more in a humour for questions than for\r\nanswers. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying his hand impressively on my arm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctell me something. For I am a stranger in your land, and I know little\r\nof _your_ modes of education: yet something tells me _we_ are further on\r\nthan _you_ in the eternal cycle of change\xe2\x80\x94and that many a theory _we_\r\nhave tried and found to fail, _you_ also will try, with a wilder\r\nenthusiasm: you also will find to fail, with a bitterer despair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was strange to see how, as he talked, and his words flowed more and\r\nmore freely, with a certain rhythmic eloquence, his features seemed to\r\nglow with an inner light, and the whole man seemed to be transformed, as\r\nif he had grown fifty years younger in a moment of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n                              FAIRY-MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silence that ensued was broken by the voice of the musical young\r\nlady, who had seated herself near us, and was conversing with one of the\r\nnewly-arrived guests. \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a tone of scornful surprise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe _are_ to have something new in the way of music, it appears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked round for an explanation, and was nearly as much astonished as\r\nthe speaker herself: it was _Sylvie_ whom Lady Muriel was leading to the\r\npiano!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo try it, my darling!\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you can play very\r\nnicely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie looked round at me, with tears in her eyes. I tried to give her\r\nan encouraging smile, but it was evidently a great strain on the nerves\r\nof a child so wholly unused to be made an exhibition of, and she was\r\nfrightened and unhappy. Yet here came out the perfect sweetness of her\r\ndisposition: I could see that she was resolved to forget herself, and do\r\nher best to give pleasure to Lady Muriel and her friends. She seated\r\nherself at the instrument, and began instantly. Time and expression, so\r\nfar as one could judge, were perfect: but her touch was one of such\r\nextraordinary lightness that it was at first scarcely possible, through\r\nthe hum of conversation which still continued, to catch a note of what\r\nshe was playing.\r\n\r\nBut in a minute the hum had died away into absolute silence, and we all\r\nsat, entranced and breathless, to listen to such heavenly music as none\r\nthen present could ever forget.\r\n\r\nHardly touching the notes at first, she played a sort of introduction in\r\na minor key\xe2\x80\x94like an embodied twilight; one felt as though the lights\r\nwere growing dim, and a mist were creeping through the room. Then there\r\nflashed through the gathering gloom the first few notes of a melody so\r\nlovely, so delicate, that one held one\xe2\x80\x99s breath, fearful to lose a\r\nsingle note of it. Ever and again the music dropped into the pathetic\r\nminor key with which it had begun, and, each time that the melody forced\r\nits way, so to speak, through the enshrouding gloom into the light of\r\nday, it was more entrancing, more magically sweet. Under the airy touch\r\nof the child, the instrument actually seemed to _warble_, like a bird.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Rise up, my love, my fair one_,\xe2\x80\x9d it seemed to sing, \xe2\x80\x9c_and come away!\r\nFor lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers\r\nappear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come!_\xe2\x80\x9d One\r\ncould fancy one heard the tinkle of the last few drops, shaken from the\r\ntrees by a passing gust\xe2\x80\x94that one saw the first glittering rays of the\r\nsun, breaking through the clouds.\r\n\r\nThe Count hurried across the room in great excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cI _cannot_\r\nremember myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cof the name of this so charming an air!\r\nIt is of an opera, most surely. Yet not even will the _opera_ remind his\r\nname to me! What you call him, dear child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98HOW CALL YOU THE OPERA?\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\nSylvie looked round at him with a rapt expression of face. She had\r\nceased playing, but her fingers still wandered fitfully over the keys.\r\nAll fear and shyness had quite passed away now, and nothing remained but\r\nthe pure joy of the music that had thrilled our hearts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe title of it!\xe2\x80\x9d the Count repeated impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cHow call you the\r\nopera?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what an opera _is_,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie half-whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, then, call you the _air_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any name for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie replied, as she rose from the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is marvellous!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Count, following the child, and\r\naddressing himself to me, as if I were the proprietor of this musical\r\nprodigy, and so _must_ know the origin of her music. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard her\r\nplay this, sooner\xe2\x80\x94I would say \xe2\x80\x98before this occasion\xe2\x80\x99? How call you the\r\nair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head; but was saved from more questions by Lady Muriel, who\r\ncame up to petition the Count for a song.\r\n\r\nThe Count spread out his hands apologetically, and ducked his head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Milady, I have already respected\xe2\x80\x94I would say prospected\xe2\x80\x94all your\r\nsongs; and there shall be none fitted to my voice! They are not for\r\nbasso voices!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you look at them again?\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel implored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s help him!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno whispered to Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get him\xe2\x80\x94_you_ know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cShall _we_ look for a song for you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said sweetly to\r\nthe Count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais _oui_!\xe2\x80\x9d the little man exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we may!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, while, each taking a hand of the\r\ndelighted Count, they led him to the music-stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is still hope!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel over her shoulder, as she\r\nfollowed them.\r\n\r\nI turned to \xe2\x80\x98Mein Herr,\xe2\x80\x99 hoping to resume our interrupted conversation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were remarking\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I began: but at this moment Sylvie came to call\r\nBruno, who had returned to my side, looking unusually serious. \xe2\x80\x9c_Do_\r\ncome, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d she entreated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know we\xe2\x80\x99ve nearly found it!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, in\r\na whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cThe locket\xe2\x80\x99s in my _hand_, now. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it out while\r\nthey were looking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Bruno drew back. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man called me names,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat names?\xe2\x80\x9d I enquired with some curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich sort of song he liked. And he said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_A_ song of _a_ man, not of _a_ lady.\xe2\x80\x99 And I said \xe2\x80\x98Shall Sylvie and me\r\nfind you the song of Mister Tottles?\xe2\x80\x99 And he said \xe2\x80\x98Wait, eel!\xe2\x80\x99 And I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n_not_ an eel, oo know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m _sure_ he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nFrench\xe2\x80\x94you know he ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t talk English so well as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno relented visibly. \xe2\x80\x9cCourse he knows no better, if he\xe2\x80\x99s Flench!\r\nFlenchmen _never_ can speak English so goodly as _us_!\xe2\x80\x9d And Sylvie led\r\nhim away, a willing captive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice children!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, taking off his spectacles and rubbing\r\nthem carefully. Then he put them on again, and watched with an approving\r\nsmile, while the children tossed over the heap of music, and we just\r\ncaught Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s reproving words, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re _not_ making hay, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis has been a long interruption to our conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cPray\r\nlet us go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the gentle old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was much interested in what you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He paused a moment, and passed his\r\nhand uneasily across his brow. \xe2\x80\x9cOne forgets,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was I\r\nsaying? Oh! Something you were to tell me. Yes. Which of your teachers\r\ndo you value the most highly, those whose words are easily understood,\r\nor those who puzzle you at every turn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt obliged to admit that we generally admired most the teachers we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way it begins. Well, _we_ were at\r\nthat stage some eighty years ago\xe2\x80\x94or was it ninety? Our favourite teacher\r\ngot more obscure every year; and every year we admired him more\xe2\x80\x94just as\r\n_your_ Art-fanciers call _mist_ the fairest feature in a landscape, and\r\nadmire a view with frantic delight when they can see nothing! Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you how it ended. It was Moral Philosophy that our idol lectured\r\non. Well, his pupils couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make head or tail of it, but they got it\r\nall by heart; and, when Examination-time came, they wrote it down; and\r\nthe Examiners said \xe2\x80\x98Beautiful! What depth!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what good was it to the young men _afterwards_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mein Herr. \xe2\x80\x9c_They_ became teachers in\r\ntheir turn, and _they_ said all these things over again; and _their_\r\npupils wrote it all down; and the Examiners accepted it; and nobody had\r\nthe ghost of an idea what it all meant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did it end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ended this way. We woke up one fine day, and found there was no one\r\nin the place that knew _anything_ about Moral Philosophy. So we\r\nabolished it, teachers, classes, examiners, and all. And if any one\r\nwanted to learn anything about it, he had to make it out for himself;\r\nand after another twenty years or so there were several men that really\r\nknew something about it! Now tell me another thing. How long do you\r\nteach a youth before you examine him, in your Universities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him, three or four years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so, just what _we_ did!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe taught \xe2\x80\x99em a bit, and,\r\njust as they were beginning to take it in, we took it all out again! We\r\npumped our wells dry before they were a quarter full\xe2\x80\x94we stripped our\r\norchards while the apples were still in blossom\xe2\x80\x94we applied the severe\r\nlogic of arithmetic to our chickens, while peacefully slumbering in\r\ntheir shells! Doubtless it\xe2\x80\x99s the early bird that picks up the worm\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nif the bird gets up so outrageously early that the worm is still deep\r\nunderground, what _then_ is its chance of a breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot much, I admitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow see how that works!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to pump your\r\nwells so soon\xe2\x80\x94and I suppose you tell me that is what you _must_ do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn an over-crowded country like this, nothing but\r\nCompetitive Examinations\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMein Herr threw up his hands wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, _again_?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought it was dead, fifty years ago! Oh this Upas tree of Competitive\r\nExaminations! Beneath whose deadly shade all the original genius, all\r\nthe exhaustive research, all the untiring life-long diligence by which\r\nour fore-fathers have so advanced human knowledge, must slowly but\r\nsurely wither away, and give place to a system of Cookery, in which the\r\nhuman mind is a sausage, and all we ask is, how much indigestible stuff\r\ncan be crammed into it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlways, after these bursts of eloquence, he seemed to forget himself for\r\na moment, and only to hold on to the thread of thought by some single\r\nword. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, _crammed_,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWe went through all that stage of\r\nthe disease\xe2\x80\x94had it bad, I warrant you! Of course, as the Examination was\r\nall in all, we tried to put in just what was wanted\xe2\x80\x94and the _great_\r\nthing to aim at was, that the Candidate should know absolutely _nothing_\r\nbeyond the needs of the Examination! I don\xe2\x80\x99t say it was ever _quite_\r\nachieved: but one of my own pupils (pardon an old man\xe2\x80\x99s egotism) came\r\nvery near it. After the Examination, he mentioned to me the few facts\r\nwhich he knew but had _not_ been able to bring in, and I can assure you\r\nthey were trivial, Sir, absolutely trivial!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI feebly expressed my surprise and delight.\r\n\r\nThe old man bowed, with a gratified smile, and proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cAt that time,\r\nno one had hit on the much more rational plan of watching for the\r\nindividual scintillations of genius, and rewarding them as they\r\noccurred. As it was, we made our unfortunate pupil into a Leyden-jar,\r\ncharged him up to the eyelids\xe2\x80\x94then applied the knob of a Competitive\r\nExamination, and drew off one magnificent spark, which very often\r\ncracked the jar! What mattered _that_? We labeled it \xe2\x80\x98First Class\r\nSpark,\xe2\x80\x99 and put it away on the shelf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the more rational system\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes! _that_ came next. Instead of giving the whole reward of\r\nlearning in one lump, we used to pay for every good answer as it\r\noccurred. How well I remember lecturing in those days, with a heap of\r\nsmall coins at my elbow! It was \xe2\x80\x98A _very_ good answer, Mr. Jones!\xe2\x80\x99 (that\r\nmeant a shilling, mostly). \xe2\x80\x98Bravo, Mr. Robinson!\xe2\x80\x99 (that meant\r\nhalf-a-crown). Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how _that_ worked. Not one single fact\r\nwould any of them take in, without a fee! And when a clever boy came up\r\nfrom school, he got paid more for learning than we got paid for teaching\r\nhim! Then came the wildest craze of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, _another_ craze?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the last one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cI must have tired you out with\r\nmy long story. Each College wanted to get the clever boys: so we adopted\r\na system which we had heard was very popular in England: the Colleges\r\ncompeted against each other, and the boys let themselves out to the\r\nhighest bidder! What geese we were! Why, they were bound to come to the\r\nUniversity _somehow_. We needn\xe2\x80\x99t have paid \xe2\x80\x99em! And all our money went\r\nin getting clever boys to come to one College rather than another! The\r\ncompetition was so keen, that at last mere money-payments were not\r\nenough. Any College, that wished to secure some specially clever young\r\nman, had to waylay him at the Station, and hunt him through the streets.\r\nThe first who touched him was allowed to have him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat hunting-down of the scholars, as they arrived, must have been a\r\ncurious business,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cCould you give me some idea of what it was\r\nlike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cI will describe to you the very last\r\nHunt that took place, before that form of Sport (for it was actually\r\nreckoned among the _Sports_ of the day: we called it \xe2\x80\x98Cub-Hunting\xe2\x80\x99) was\r\nfinally abandoned. I witnessed it myself, as I happened to be passing by\r\nat the moment, and was what we called \xe2\x80\x98in at the death.\xe2\x80\x99 I can see it\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in an excited tone, gazing into vacancy with those\r\nlarge dreamy eyes of his. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like yesterday; and yet it\r\nhappened\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He checked himself hastily, and the remaining words died\r\naway into a whisper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOLAR-HUNTING: THE PURSUED]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_How_ many years ago did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, much interested in the\r\nprospect of at last learning _some_ definite fact in his history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOLAR-HUNTING: THE PURSUERS]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Many_ years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThe scene at the Railway-Station had\r\nbeen (so they told me) one of wild excitement. Eight or nine Heads of\r\nColleges had assembled at the gates (no one was allowed inside), and the\r\nStation-Master had drawn a line on the pavement, and insisted on their\r\nall standing behind it. The gates were flung open! The young man darted\r\nthrough them, and fled like lightning down the street, while the Heads\r\nof Colleges actually _yelled_ with excitement on catching sight of him!\r\nThe Proctor gave the word, in the old statutory form, \xe2\x80\x98_Semel!_ _Bis!_\r\n_Ter!_ _Currite!_\xe2\x80\x99, and the Hunt began! Oh, it was a fine sight, believe\r\nme! At the first corner he dropped his Greek Lexicon: further on, his\r\nrailway-rug: then various small articles: then his umbrella: lastly,\r\nwhat I suppose he prized most, his hand-bag: but the game was up: the\r\nspherical Principal of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf _which_ College?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94of _one_ of the Colleges,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9chad put into operation the\r\nTheory\xe2\x80\x94his own discovery\xe2\x80\x94of Accelerated Velocity, and captured him just\r\nopposite to where I stood. I shall never forget that wild breathless\r\nstruggle! But it was soon over. Once in those great bony hands, escape\r\nwas impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask why you speak of him as the \xe2\x80\x98_spherical_\xe2\x80\x99 Principal?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe epithet referred to his _shape_, which was a perfect _sphere_. You\r\nare aware that a bullet, another instance of a perfect sphere, when\r\nfalling in a perfectly straight line, moves with Accelerated Velocity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my spherical friend (as I am proud to call him) set himself to\r\ninvestigate the _causes_ of this. He found them to be _three_. One; that\r\nit is a perfect _sphere_. Two; that it moves in a _straight line_.\r\nThree; that its direction is _not upwards_. When these three conditions\r\nare fulfilled, you get Accelerated Velocity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cif you will excuse my differing from you. Suppose we\r\napply the theory to _horizontal_ motion. If a bullet is fired\r\n_horizontally_, it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94it does _not_ move in a _straight line_,\xe2\x80\x9d he quietly finished my\r\nsentence for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI yield the point,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did your friend do next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next thing was to apply the theory, as you rightly suggest, to\r\n_horizontal_ motion. But the moving body, ever tending to _fall_, needs\r\n_constant support_, if it is to move in a true horizontal line. \xe2\x80\x98What,\r\nthen,\xe2\x80\x99 he asked himself, \xe2\x80\x98will _give constant support to a moving\r\nbody_?\xe2\x80\x99 And his answer was \xe2\x80\x98_Human legs!_\xe2\x80\x99 _That_ was the discovery that\r\nimmortalised his name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name being\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not mentioned it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the gentle reply of my most unsatisfactory\r\ninformant. \xe2\x80\x9cHis next step was an obvious one. He took to a diet of\r\nsuet-dumplings, until his body had become a perfect sphere. _Then_ he\r\nwent out for his first experimental run\xe2\x80\x94which nearly cost him his life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was _that_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, he had no idea of the _tremendous_ new Force in Nature\r\nthat he was calling into play. He began too fast. In a very few minutes\r\nhe found himself moving at a hundred miles an hour! And, if he had not\r\nhad the presence of mind to charge into the middle of a haystack (which\r\nhe scattered to the four winds) there can be no doubt that he would have\r\nleft the Planet he belonged to, and gone right away into Space!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how came that to be the _last_ of the Cub-Hunts?\xe2\x80\x9d I enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, it led to a rather scandalous dispute between two of the\r\nColleges. _Another_ Principal had laid his hand on the young man, so\r\nnearly at the same moment as the _spherical_ one, that there was no\r\nknowing which had touched him first. The dispute got into print, and did\r\nus no credit, and, in short, Cub-Hunts came to an end. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nwhat cured us of that wild craze of ours, the bidding against each\r\nother, for the clever scholars, just as if they were articles to be sold\r\nby auction! Just when the craze had reached its highest point, and when\r\none of the Colleges had actually advertised a Scholarship of one\r\nthousand pounds _per annum_, one of our tourists brought us the\r\nmanuscript of an old African legend\xe2\x80\x94I happen to have a copy of it in my\r\npocket. Shall I translate it for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray go on,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, though I felt I was getting _very_ sleepy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                          WHAT TOTTLES MEANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMein Herr unrolled the manuscript, but, to my great surprise, instead of\r\n_reading_ it, he began to _sing_ it, in a rich mellow voice that seemed\r\nto ring through the room.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cOne thousand pounds per annuum\r\n  Is not so bad a figure, come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  Cried Tottles. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I tell you, flat,\r\n  A man may marry well on that!\r\n  To say \xe2\x80\x98the Husband needs the Wife\xe2\x80\x99\r\n  Is not the way to represent it.\r\n  The crowning joy of Woman\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\n  Is _Man_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  The blissful Honey-moon is past:\r\n  The Pair have settled down at last:\r\n  Mamma-in-law their home will share,\r\n  And make their happiness her care.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cYour income is an ample one;\r\n  Go it, my children!\xe2\x80\x9d (And they went it).\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cI rayther think this kind of fun\r\n  Won\xe2\x80\x99t last!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  They took a little country-box\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  A box at Covent Garden also:\r\n  They lived a life of double-knocks,\r\n  Acquaintances began to call so:\r\n  Their London house was much the same\r\n  (It took three hundred, clear, to rent it):\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cLife is a very jolly game!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  Cried happy Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98Contented with a frugal lot\xe2\x80\x99\r\n  (He always used that phrase at Gunter\xe2\x80\x99s),\r\n  He bought a handy little yacht\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  A dozen serviceable hunters\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  The fishing of a Highland Loch\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  A sailing-boat to circumvent it\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThe sounding of that Gaelic \xe2\x80\x98och\xe2\x80\x99\r\n  Beats _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\nHere, with one of those convulsive starts that wake one up in the very\r\nact of dropping off to sleep, I became conscious that the deep musical\r\ntones that thrilled me did _not_ belong to Mein Herr, but to the French\r\nCount. The old man was still conning the manuscript.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _beg_ your pardon for keeping you waiting!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just\r\nmaking sure that I knew the English for all the words. I am quite ready\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d And he read me the following Legend:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a city that stands in the very centre of Africa, and is rarely\r\nvisited by the casual tourist, the people had always bought eggs\xe2\x80\x94a daily\r\nnecessary in a climate where egg-flip was the usual diet\xe2\x80\x94from a Merchant\r\nwho came to their gates once a week. And the people always bid wildly\r\nagainst each other: so there was quite a lively auction every time the\r\nMerchant came, and the last egg in his basket used to fetch the value of\r\ntwo or three camels, or thereabouts. And eggs got dearer every week. And\r\nstill they drank their egg-flip, and wondered where all their money went\r\nto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EGG-MERCHANT]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there came a day when they put their heads together. And they\r\nunderstood what donkeys they had been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd next day, when the Merchant came, only _one_ Man went forth. And he\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x98Oh, thou of the hook-nose and the goggle-eyes, thou of the\r\nmeasureless beard, how much for that lot of eggs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Merchant answered him \xe2\x80\x98I _could_ let thee have that lot at ten\r\nthousand piastres the dozen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Man chuckled inwardly, and said \xe2\x80\x98_Ten_ piastres the dozen I\r\noffer thee, and no more, oh descendant of a distinguished grandfather!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Merchant stroked his beard, and said \xe2\x80\x98Hum! I will await the\r\ncoming of thy friends,\xe2\x80\x99 So he waited. And the Man waited with him. And\r\nthey waited both together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manuscript breaks off here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mein Herr, as he rolled it up\r\nagain; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was enough to open our eyes. We saw what simpletons we\r\nhad been\xe2\x80\x94buying our Scholars much as those ignorant savages bought their\r\neggs\xe2\x80\x94and the ruinous system was abandoned. If only we could have\r\nabandoned, along with it, all the _other_ fashions we had borrowed from\r\nyou, instead of carrying them to their logical results! But it was not\r\nto be. What ruined my country, and drove me from my home, was the\r\nintroduction\xe2\x80\x94into the _Army_, of all places\xe2\x80\x94of your theory of Political\r\nDichotomy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I trouble you too much,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I ask you to explain what\r\nyou mean by \xe2\x80\x98the Theory of Political Dichotomy\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo trouble at all!\xe2\x80\x9d was Mein Herr\xe2\x80\x99s most courteous reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite\r\nenjoy talking, when I get so good a listener. What started the thing,\r\nwith us, was the report brought to us, by one of our most eminent\r\nstatesmen, who had stayed some time in England, of the way affairs were\r\nmanaged there. It was a political necessity (so he assured us, and we\r\nbelieved him, though we had never discovered it till that moment) that\r\nthere should be _two_ Parties, in every affair and on every subject. In\r\n_Politics_, the two Parties, which you had found it necessary to\r\ninstitute, were called, he told us, \xe2\x80\x98Whigs\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Tories\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must have been some time ago?\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _was_ some time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this was the way the affairs\r\nof the British Nation were managed. (You will correct me if I\r\nmisrepresent it. I do but repeat what our traveler told us.) These two\r\nParties\xe2\x80\x94which were in chronic hostility to each other\xe2\x80\x94took turns in\r\nconducting the Government; and the Party, that happened _not_ to be in\r\npower, was called the \xe2\x80\x98Opposition\xe2\x80\x99, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the right name,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere have always been, so long as we\r\nhave had a Parliament at all, _two_ Parties, one \xe2\x80\x98in\xe2\x80\x99, and one \xe2\x80\x98out\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the function of the \xe2\x80\x98Ins\xe2\x80\x99 (if I may so call them) was to do the\r\nbest they could for the national welfare\xe2\x80\x94in such things as making war or\r\npeace, commercial treaties, and so forth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the function of the \xe2\x80\x98Outs\xe2\x80\x99 was (so our traveller assured us, though\r\nwe were very incredulous at first) to _prevent_ the \xe2\x80\x98Ins\xe2\x80\x99 from\r\nsucceeding in any of these things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo _criticize_ and to _amend_ their proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d I corrected him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould be _unpatriotic_ to _hinder_ the Government in doing what was for\r\nthe good of the Nation! We have always held a _Patriot_ to be the\r\ngreatest of heroes, and an _unpatriotic_ spirit to be one of the worst\r\nof human ills!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman courteously replied, taking\r\nout his pocket-book. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a few memoranda here, of a correspondence I\r\nhad with our tourist, and, if you will allow me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just refresh my\r\nmemory\xe2\x80\x94although I quite agree with you\xe2\x80\x94it is, as you say, one of the\r\nworst of human ills\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d And, here Mein Herr began singing again:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  But oh, the worst of human ills\r\n  (Poor Tottles found) are \xe2\x80\x98little bills\xe2\x80\x99!\r\n  And, with no balance in the Bank,\r\n  What wonder that his spirits sank?\r\n  Still, as the money flowed away,\r\n  He wondered how on earth she spent it.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cYou cost me twenty pounds a day,\r\n  _At least_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  She sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cThose Drawing Rooms, you know!\r\n  I really never thought about it:\r\n  Mamma declared we ought to go\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  We should be Nobodies without it.\r\n  That diamond-circlet for my brow\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  I quite believed that _she_ had sent it,\r\n  Until the Bill came in just now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c_Viper_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  Poor Mrs. T. could bear no more,\r\n  But fainted flat upon the floor.\r\n  Mamma-in-law, with anguish wild,\r\n  Seeks, all in vain, to rouse her child.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cQuick! Take this box of smelling-salts!\r\n  Don\xe2\x80\x99t scold her, James, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll repent it,\r\n  She\xe2\x80\x99s a _dear_ girl, with all her faults\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cShe _is_!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cI was a donkey,\xe2\x80\x9d Tottles cried,\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cTo choose your daughter for my bride!\r\n  \xe2\x80\x99Twas _you_ that bid us cut a dash!\r\n  \xe2\x80\x99Tis _you_ have brought us to this smash!\r\n  You don\xe2\x80\x99t suggest one single thing\r\n  That can in any way prevent it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  Then what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of arguing?\r\n  _Shut up!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\nOnce more I started into wakefulness, and realised that Mein Herr was\r\nnot the singer. He was still consulting his memoranda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is exactly what my friend told me,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, after conning over\r\nvarious papers. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_Unpatriotic_\xe2\x80\x99 is the very word I had used, in writing\r\nto him, and \xe2\x80\x98_hinder_\xe2\x80\x99 is the very word he used in his reply! Allow me\r\nto read you a portion of his letter:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_I can assure you_,\xe2\x80\x99 he writes, \xe2\x80\x98_that, unpatriotic as you may think\r\n  it, the recognised function of the \xe2\x80\x98Opposition\xe2\x80\x99 is to hinder, in every\r\n  manner not forbidden by the Law, the action of the Government. This\r\n  process is called \xe2\x80\x98Legitimate Obstruction\xe2\x80\x99: and the greatest triumph\r\n  the \xe2\x80\x98Opposition\xe2\x80\x99 can ever enjoy, is when they are able to point out\r\n  that, owing to their \xe2\x80\x98Obstruction\xe2\x80\x99, the Government have failed in\r\n  everything they have tried to do for the good of the Nation!_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend has not put it _quite_ correctly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Opposition\r\nwould no doubt be glad to point out that the Government had failed\r\n_through their own fault_; but _not_ that they had failed on account of\r\n_Obstruction_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d he gently replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me now to read to you this\r\nnewspaper-cutting, which my friend enclosed in his letter. It is part of\r\nthe report of a public speech, made by a Statesman who was at the time a\r\nmember of the \xe2\x80\x98Opposition\xe2\x80\x99:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_At the close of the Session, he thought they had no reason to be\r\n  discontented with the fortunes of the campaign. They had routed the\r\n  enemy at every point. But the pursuit must be continued. They had only\r\n  to follow up a disordered and dispirited foe._\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow to what portion of your national history would you guess that the\r\nspeaker was referring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, the number of _successful_ wars we have waged during the last\r\ncentury,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, with a glow of British pride, \xe2\x80\x9cis _far_ too great\r\nfor me to guess, with any chance of success, _which_ it was we were then\r\nengaged in. However, I will name \xe2\x80\x98_India_\xe2\x80\x99 as the most probable. The\r\nMutiny was no doubt, all but crushed, at the time that speech was made.\r\nWhat a fine, manly, _patriotic_ speech it must have been!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed\r\nin an outburst of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, in a tone of gentle pity. \xe2\x80\x9cYet my friend\r\ntells me that the \xe2\x80\x98_disordered and dispirited foe_\xe2\x80\x99 simply meant the\r\nStatesmen who happened to be in power at the moment; that the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_pursuit_\xe2\x80\x99 simply meant \xe2\x80\x98Obstruction\xe2\x80\x99; and that the words \xe2\x80\x98_they had\r\nrouted the enemy_\xe2\x80\x99 simply meant that the \xe2\x80\x98Opposition\xe2\x80\x99 had succeeded in\r\nhindering the Government from doing any of the work which the Nation had\r\nempowered them to do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought it best to say nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed queer to _us_, just at first,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, after courteously\r\nwaiting a minute for me to speak: \xe2\x80\x9cbut, when once we had mastered the\r\nidea, our respect for your Nation was so great that we carried it into\r\nevery department of life! It was \xe2\x80\x98_the beginning of the end_\xe2\x80\x99 with us.\r\nMy country never held up its head again!\xe2\x80\x9d And the poor old gentleman\r\nsighed deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us change the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not distress yourself, I beg!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with an effort to recover himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI had rather\r\nfinish my story! The next step (after reducing our Government to\r\nimpotence, and putting a stop to all useful legislation, which did not\r\ntake us long to do) was to introduce what we called \xe2\x80\x98the glorious\r\nBritish Principle of Dichotomy\xe2\x80\x99 into _Agriculture_. We persuaded many of\r\nthe well-to-do farmers to divide their staff of labourers into two\r\nParties, and to set them one against the other. They were called, like\r\nour political Parties, the \xe2\x80\x98Ins\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Outs\xe2\x80\x99: the business of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ins\xe2\x80\x99 was to do as much of ploughing, sowing, or whatever might be\r\nneeded, as they could manage in a day, and at night they were paid\r\naccording to the amount they had _done_: the business of the \xe2\x80\x98Outs\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\nto hinder them, and _they_ were paid for the amount they had _hindered_.\r\nThe farmers found they had to pay only _half_ as much wages as they did\r\nbefore, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t observe that the amount of work done was only a\r\n_quarter_ as much as was done before: so they took it up quite\r\nenthusiastically, _at first_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _afterwards_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d I enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _afterwards_ they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it quite so well. In a very short\r\ntime, things settled down into a regular routine. No work _at all_ was\r\ndone. So the \xe2\x80\x98Ins\xe2\x80\x99 got no wages, and the \xe2\x80\x98Outs\xe2\x80\x99 got full pay. And the\r\nfarmers never discovered, till most of them were ruined, that the\r\nrascals had agreed to manage it so, and had shared the pay between them!\r\nWhile the thing lasted, there were funny sights to be seen! Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\noften watched a ploughman, with two horses harnessed to the plough,\r\ndoing his best to get it _forwards_; while the opposition-ploughman,\r\nwith three donkeys harnessed at the _other_ end, was doing _his_ best to\r\nget it _backwards_! And the plough never moving an inch, _either_ way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _we_ never did anything like _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply because you were less _logical_ than we were,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mein\r\nHerr. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is _sometimes_ an advantage in being a donk\xe2\x80\x94Excuse me! No\r\n_personal_ allusion intended. All this happened _long ago_, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the Dichotomy-Principle succeed in _any_ direction?\xe2\x80\x9d I enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn _none_,\xe2\x80\x9d Mein Herr candidly confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt had a _very_ short trial\r\nin _Commerce_. The shop-keepers _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ take it up, after once trying\r\nthe plan of having half the attendants busy in folding up and carrying\r\naway the goods which the other half were trying to spread out upon the\r\ncounters. They said the Public didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at it,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we tried \xe2\x80\x98the British Principle\xe2\x80\x99 for some years. And the end of\r\nit all was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d His voice suddenly dropped, almost to a whisper; and large\r\ntears began to roll down his cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94the end was that we got involved\r\nin a war; and there was a great battle, in which we far out-numbered the\r\nenemy. But what could one expect, when only _half_ of our soldiers were\r\nfighting, and the other half pulling them back? It ended in a crushing\r\ndefeat\xe2\x80\x94an utter rout. This caused a Revolution; and most of the\r\nGovernment were banished. I myself was accused of Treason, for having so\r\nstrongly advocated \xe2\x80\x98the British Principle.\xe2\x80\x99 My property was all\r\nforfeited, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94I was driven into exile! \xe2\x80\x98Now the mischief\xe2\x80\x99s done,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthey said, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll kindly leave the country?\xe2\x80\x99 It nearly broke my\r\nheart, but I had to go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe melancholy tone became a wail: the wail became a chant: the chant\r\nbecame a song\xe2\x80\x94though whether it was _Mein Herr_ that was singing, this\r\ntime, or somebody else, I could not feel certain.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, now the mischief\xe2\x80\x99s done, perhaps\r\n  You\xe2\x80\x99ll kindly go and pack your traps?\r\n  Since _two_ (your daughter and your son)\r\n  Are Company, but _three_ are none.\r\n  A course of saving we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin:\r\n  When change is needed, _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ invent it:\r\n  Don\xe2\x80\x99t think to put _your_ finger in\r\n  _This_ pie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\nThe music seemed to die away. Mein Herr was again speaking in his\r\nordinary voice. \xe2\x80\x9cNow tell me one thing more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I right in\r\nthinking that in _your_ Universities, though a man may reside some\r\nthirty or forty years, you examine him, once for all, at the end of the\r\nfirst three or four?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so, undoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d I admitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPractically, then, you examine a man at the _beginning_ of his career!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe old man said to himself rather than to me. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what guarantee have\r\nyou that he _retains_ the knowledge for which you have rewarded\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94beforehand, as _we_ should say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d I admitted, feeling a little puzzled at the drift of his\r\nremarks. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do _you_ secure that object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy examining him at the _end_ of his thirty or forty years\xe2\x80\x94not at the\r\nbeginning,\xe2\x80\x9d he gently replied. \xe2\x80\x9cOn an average, the knowledge then found\r\nis about one-fifth of what it was at first\xe2\x80\x94the process of forgetting\r\ngoing on at a very steady uniform rate\xe2\x80\x94and he, who forgets _least_, gets\r\n_most_ honour, and most rewards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you give him the money when he needs it no longer? And you make\r\nhim live most of his life on _nothing_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly that. He gives his orders to the tradesmen: they supply him, for\r\nforty, sometimes fifty, years, at their own risk: then he gets his\r\nFellowship\xe2\x80\x94which pays him in _one_ year as much as _your_ Fellowships\r\npay in fifty\xe2\x80\x94and then he can easily pay all his bills, with interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose he fails to get his Fellowship? That must occasionally\r\nhappen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat occasionally happens.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Mein Herr\xe2\x80\x99s turn, now, to make\r\nadmissions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what becomes of the tradesmen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey calculate accordingly. When a man appears to be getting alarmingly\r\nignorant, or stupid, they will sometimes refuse to supply him any\r\nlonger. You have no idea with what enthusiasm a man will begin to rub up\r\nhis forgotten sciences or languages, when his butcher has cut off the\r\nsupply of beef and mutton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who are the Examiners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young men who have just come, brimming over with knowledge. You\r\nwould think it a curious sight,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto see mere boys examining\r\nsuch old men. I have known a man set to examine his own grandfather. It\r\nwas a little painful for both of them, no doubt. The old gentleman was\r\nas bald as a coot\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow bald would that be?\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea why I asked this question. I felt\r\nI was getting foolish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n                            BRUNO\xe2\x80\x99S PICNIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs bald as bald,\xe2\x80\x9d was the bewildering reply. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Bruno, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\na story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell _oo_ a story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, beginning in a great hurry for\r\nfear of Sylvie getting the start of him: \xe2\x80\x9conce there were a Mouse\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle tiny Mouse\xe2\x80\x94such a tiny little Mouse! Oo never saw such a tiny\r\nMouse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid nothing ever happen to it, Bruno?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you anything\r\nmore to tell us, besides its being so tiny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing never happened to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno solemnly replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did nothing never happen to it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie, who was sitting, with\r\nher head on Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, patiently waiting for a chance of\r\nbeginning _her_ story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were too tiny,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That\xe2\x80\x99s_ no reason!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever tiny it was, things might happen\r\nto it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno looked pityingly at me, as if he thought me very stupid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt were\r\ntoo tiny,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything happened to it, it would die\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwere so _very_ tiny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally that\xe2\x80\x99s enough about its being tiny!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie put in. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ninvented any more about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t invented no more yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t begin a story till you\xe2\x80\x99ve invented more! Now\r\nbe quiet, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy, and listen to _my_ story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bruno, having quite exhausted all his inventive faculty, by\r\nbeginning in too great a hurry, quietly resigned himself to listening.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell about the other Bruno, please,\xe2\x80\x9d he said coaxingly.\r\n\r\nSylvie put her arms round his neck, and began:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wind was whispering among the trees,\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good manners!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBruno interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about manners,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie) \xe2\x80\x9cand it was\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x94a nice moony evening, and the Owls were hooting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretend they weren\xe2\x80\x99t Owls!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno pleaded, stroking her cheek with his\r\nfat little hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like Owls. Owls have such great big eyes.\r\nPretend they were Chickens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid of their great big eyes, Bruno?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t _\xe2\x80\x99fraid_ of nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno answered in as careless a tone as he\r\ncould manage: \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re ugly with their great big eyes. I think if they\r\ncried, the tears would be as big\xe2\x80\x94oh, as big as the moon!\xe2\x80\x9d And he laughed\r\nmerrily. \xe2\x80\x9cDoos Owls cry ever, Mister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOwls cry never,\xe2\x80\x9d I said gravely, trying to copy Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s way of\r\nspeaking: \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to be sorry for, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but they have!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re ever so sorry, \xe2\x80\x99cause\r\nthey killed the poor little Mouses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99re not sorry when they\xe2\x80\x99re _hungry_, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing about Owls!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno scornfully remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, they\xe2\x80\x99re very, _very_ sorry they killed the little\r\nMouses, \xe2\x80\x99cause if they _hadn\xe2\x80\x99t_ killed them there\xe2\x80\x99d be sumfin for\r\nsupper, oo know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno was evidently getting into a dangerously inventive state of mind,\r\nso Sylvie broke in with \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m going on with the story. So the\r\nOwls\xe2\x80\x94the Chickens, I mean\xe2\x80\x94were looking to see if they could find a nice\r\nfat Mouse for their supper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretend it was a nice \xe2\x80\x99abbit!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it _wasn\xe2\x80\x99t_ a nice habit, to kill Mouses,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie argued. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npretend _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98_habit_,\xe2\x80\x99 oo silly fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno replied with a merry\r\ntwinkle in his eye. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99_abbits_\xe2\x80\x94that runs about in the fields!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRabbit? Well it can be a Rabbit, if you like. But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t alter my\r\nstory so much, Bruno. A Chicken _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ eat a Rabbit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it might have wished to see if it could try to eat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it wished to see if it could try\xe2\x80\x94oh, really, Bruno, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnonsense! I shall go back to the Owls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, pretend they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t great eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they saw a little Boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie went on, disdaining to make any\r\nfurther corrections. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he asked them to tell him a story. And the\r\nOwls hooted and flew away\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cOo shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98_flewed_;\xe2\x80\x99 oo should\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x98_flied_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno whispered. But Sylvie wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear.) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he met\r\na Lion. And he asked the Lion to tell him a story. And the Lion said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98yes,\xe2\x80\x99 it would. And, while the Lion was telling him the story, it\r\nnibbled some of his head off\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98nibbled\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno entreated. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly little things\r\nnibble\xe2\x80\x94little thin sharp things, with edges\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, it \xe2\x80\x98_nubbled_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when it had nubbled _all_\r\nhis head off, he went away, and he never said \xe2\x80\x98thank you\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat were very rude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak, he might have\r\nnodded\xe2\x80\x94no, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t nod. Well, he might have shaked _hands_ with the\r\nLion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten that part!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cHe _did_ shake hands with\r\nit. He came back again, you know, and he thanked the Lion very much, for\r\ntelling him the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen his head had growed up again?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, it grew up in a minute. And the Lion begged pardon, and said it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t nubble off little boys\xe2\x80\x99 heads\xe2\x80\x94not never no more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno looked much pleased at this change of events. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that are a\r\n_really_ nice story!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c_Aren\xe2\x80\x99t_ it a nice story, Mister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to hear another story about that Boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo would _I_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, stroking Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s cheek again. \xe2\x80\x9c_Please_\r\ntell about Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s Picnic; and don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about _nubbly_ Lions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t, if it frightens you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Flightens_ me!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno exclaimed indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t _that_! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x99cause \xe2\x80\x98nubbly\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99s such a grumbly word to say\xe2\x80\x94when one person\xe2\x80\x99s got her\r\nhead on another person\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. When she talks like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexplained to me, \xe2\x80\x9cthe talking goes down bofe sides of my face\xe2\x80\x94all the\r\nway to my chin\xe2\x80\x94and it _doos_ tickle so! It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make a beard\r\ngrow, that it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said this with great severity, but it was evidently meant for a joke:\r\nso Sylvie laughed\xe2\x80\x94a delicious musical little laugh, and laid her soft\r\ncheek on the top of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s curly head, as if it were a pillow,\r\nwhile she went on with the story. \xe2\x80\x9cSo this Boy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t _me_, oo know!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd oo needn\xe2\x80\x99t try to\r\nlook as if it was, Mister Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI represented, respectfully, that I was trying to look as if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94he was a middling good Boy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe were a _welly_ good Boy!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno corrected her. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he never did\r\nnothing he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t told to do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a good Boy!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat _do_ make a good Boy!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno insisted.\r\n\r\nSylvie gave up the point. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he was a _very_ good Boy, and he always\r\nkept his promises, and he had a big cupboard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94for to keep all his promises in!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he kept _all_ his promises,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, with a mischievous look in\r\nher eyes, \xe2\x80\x9che wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like _some_ Boys I know of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had to put _salt_ with them, a-course,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said gravely: \xe2\x80\x9coo\r\nca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t keep promises when there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any salt. And he kept his birthday\r\non the second shelf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long did he keep his birthday?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI never can keep _mine_\r\nmore than twenty-four hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a birthday _stays_ that long by itself!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cOo doosn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how to keep birthdays! This Boy kept _his_ a whole year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then the next birthday would begin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it would be\r\nhis birthday _always_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it were,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cDoos _oo_ have treats on _oor_ birthday,\r\nMister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen oo\xe2\x80\x99re _good_, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it _is_ a sort of treat, being good, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sort of _treat_!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of _punishment_, _I_\r\nthink!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie interrupted, almost sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow _can_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but it _is_,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno persisted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, look here, Mister Sir!\r\n_This_ is being good!\xe2\x80\x9d And he sat bolt upright, and put on an absurdly\r\nsolemn face. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst oo must sit up as straight as pokers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94as _a_ poker,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie corrected him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94as straight as _pokers_,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno firmly repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cThen oo must clasp\r\noor hands\xe2\x80\x94_so_. Then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t oo brushed oor hair? Go and brush it\r\n_toreckly_!\xe2\x80\x99 Then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Bruno, oo mustn\xe2\x80\x99t dog\xe2\x80\x99s-ear the daisies!\xe2\x80\x99 Did oo\r\nlearn _oor_ spelling wiz daisies, Mister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to hear about that Boy\xe2\x80\x99s _Birthday_,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nBruno returned to the story instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, so this Boy said \xe2\x80\x98Now it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy Birthday!\xe2\x80\x99 And so\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m tired!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly broke off, laying his head\r\nin Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s lap. \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie knows it best. Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s grown-upper than me. Go\r\non, Sylvie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie patiently took up the thread of the story again. \xe2\x80\x9cSo he said \xe2\x80\x98Now\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s my Birthday. Whatever shall I do to keep my Birthday? All _good_\r\nlittle Boys\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (Sylvie turned away from Bruno, and made a great pretence\r\nof whispering to _me_) \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94all _good_ little Boys\xe2\x80\x94Boys that learn their\r\nlessons quite perfect\xe2\x80\x94they always keep their birthdays, you know. So of\r\ncourse _this_ little Boy kept _his_ Birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo may call him Bruno, if oo like,\xe2\x80\x9d the little fellow carelessly\r\nremarked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt weren\xe2\x80\x99t _me_, but it makes it more interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Bruno said to himself \xe2\x80\x98The properest thing to do is to have a\r\nPicnic, all by myself, on the top of the hill. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll take some Milk,\r\nand some Bread, and some Apples: and first and foremost, I want some\r\n_Milk_!\xe2\x80\x99 So, first and foremost, Bruno took a milk-pail\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he went and milkted the Cow!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie, meekly accepting the new verb. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Cow said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Moo! What are you going to do with all that Milk?\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please\xe2\x80\x99m, I want it for my Picnic.\xe2\x80\x99 And the Cow said \xe2\x80\x98Moo! But I hope\r\nyou wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t _boil_ any of it?\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98No, _indeed_ I won\xe2\x80\x99t! New\r\nMilk\xe2\x80\x99s so nice and so warm, it wants no boiling!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want no boiling,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno offered as an amended version.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Bruno put the Milk in a bottle. And then Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Now I want some\r\nBread!\xe2\x80\x99 So he went to the Oven, and he took out a delicious new Loaf.\r\nAnd the Oven\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94ever so light and so puffy!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno impatiently corrected her. \xe2\x80\x9cOo\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave out so many words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie humbly apologised. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94a delicious new Loaf, ever so light and so\r\npuffy. And the Oven said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here Sylvie made a long pause. \xe2\x80\x9cReally I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know _what_ an Oven begins with, when it wants to speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth children looked appealingly at me; but I could only say,\r\nhelplessly, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea! _I_ never heard an Oven speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two we all sat silent; and then Bruno said, very softly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOven begins wiz \xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Good_ little boy!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe does his spelling _very_\r\nnicely. _He\xe2\x80\x99s cleverer than he knows!_\xe2\x80\x9d she added, aside, to _me_. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nthe Oven said \xe2\x80\x98O! What are you going to do with all that Bread?\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nBruno said \xe2\x80\x98Please\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 Is an Oven \xe2\x80\x98Sir\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x99 would you say?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlooked to me for a reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Both_, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to me the safest thing to say.\r\n\r\nSylvie adopted the suggestion instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cSo Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Please, Sirm, I\r\nwant it for my Picnic.\xe2\x80\x99 And the Oven said \xe2\x80\x98O! But I hope you wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_toast_ any of it?\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98No, _indeed_ I wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t! New Bread\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso light and so puffy, it wants no toasting!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt never doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want no toasting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cI _wiss_ oo wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay it so short!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Bruno put the Bread in the hamper. Then Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Now I want some\r\nApples!\xe2\x80\x99 So he took the hamper, and he went to the Apple-Tree, and he\r\npicked some lovely ripe Apples. And the Apple-Tree said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here followed\r\nanother long pause.\r\n\r\nBruno adopted his favourite expedient of tapping his forehead; while\r\nSylvie gazed earnestly upwards, as if she hoped for some suggestion from\r\nthe birds, who were singing merrily among the branches overhead. But no\r\nresult followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _does_ an Apple-tree begin with, when it wants to speak?\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie\r\nmurmured despairingly, to the irresponsive birds.\r\n\r\nAt last, taking a leaf out of Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s book, I ventured on a remark.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98Apple-tree\xe2\x80\x99 always begin with \xe2\x80\x98Eh!\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of _course_ it does! How _clever_ of you!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie cried\r\ndelightedly.\r\n\r\nBruno jumped up, and patted me on the head. I tried not to feel\r\nconceited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the Apple Tree said \xe2\x80\x98Eh! What are you going to do with all those\r\nApples?\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Please, Sir, I want them for my Picnic,\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nthe Apple-Tree said \xe2\x80\x98Eh! But I hope you wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t _bake_ any of them?\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nBruno said \xe2\x80\x98No, _indeed_ I wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t! Ripe Apples are so nice and so sweet,\r\nthey want no baking!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey never doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno was beginning, but Sylvie corrected herself\r\nbefore he could get the words out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98They never doesn\xe2\x80\x99t nonow want no baking.\xe2\x80\x99 So Bruno put the Apples in\r\nthe hamper, along with the Bread, and the bottle of Milk. And he set off\r\nto have a Picnic, on the top of the hill, all by himself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t greedy, oo know, to have it all by himself,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said,\r\npatting me on the cheek to call my attention; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99cause he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got no\r\nbrothers and sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very sad to have no _sisters_, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said thoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99cause he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nlessons to do. So he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie went on. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, as he was walking along the road, he heard behind\r\nhim such a curious sort of noise\xe2\x80\x94a sort of a Thump! Thump! Thump!\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever _is_ that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I know!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x98Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly my Watch a-ticking!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Were_ it his Watch a-ticking?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno asked me, with eyes that fairly\r\nsparkled with mischievous delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt of it!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. And Bruno laughed exultingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Bruno thought a little harder. And he said \xe2\x80\x98No! It _ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ be my\r\nWatch a-ticking; because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t _got_ a Watch!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno peered up anxiously into my face, to see how I took it. I hung my\r\nhead, and put a thumb into my mouth, to the evident delight of the\r\nlittle fellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Bruno went a little further along the road. And then he heard it\r\nagain, that queer noise\xe2\x80\x94Thump! Thump! Thump! \xe2\x80\x98What ever _is_ that?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBruno. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I know!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x98Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s only the Carpenter a-mending\r\nmy Wheelbarrow!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Were_ it the Carterpenter a-mending his Wheelbarrow?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno asked me.\r\n\r\nI brightened up, and said \xe2\x80\x9cIt _must_ have been!\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone of absolute\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nBruno threw his arms round Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s neck. \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a\r\nperfectly audible whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says it _must_ have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Bruno thought a little harder. And he said \xe2\x80\x98No! It _ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ be the\r\nCarpenter amending my Wheelbarrow, because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t _got_ a\r\nWheelbarrow!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time I hid my face in my hands, quite unable to meet Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s look\r\nof triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Bruno went a little further along the road. And then he heard that\r\nqueer noise again\xe2\x80\x94Thump! Thump! Thump! So he thought he\xe2\x80\x99d look round,\r\n_this_ time, just to _see_ what it was. And what should it be but a\r\ngreat Lion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great big Lion,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno corrected her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great big Lion. And Bruno was ever so frightened, and he ran\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t _flightened_ a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno interrupted. (He was evidently\r\nanxious for the reputation of his namesake.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe runned away to get a\r\ngood look at the Lion; \xe2\x80\x99cause he wanted to see if it were the same Lion\r\nwhat used to nubble little Boys\xe2\x80\x99 heads off; and he wanted to know how\r\nbig it was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he ran away, to get a good look at the Lion. And the Lion trotted\r\nslowly after him. And the Lion called after him, in a very gentle voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Little Boy, little Boy! You needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of _me_! I\xe2\x80\x99m a very\r\n_gentle_ old Lion now. I _never_ nubble little Boys\xe2\x80\x99 heads off, as I\r\nused to do.\xe2\x80\x99 And so Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you _really_, Sir? Then what do\r\nyou live on?\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo _see_ he weren\xe2\x80\x99t a bit flightened!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said to me, patting my\r\ncheek again. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99cause he remembered to call it \xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 oo know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said that no doubt that was the _real_ test whether a person was\r\nfrightened or not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Lion said \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I live on bread-and-butter, and cherries, and\r\nmarmalade, and plum-cake\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and _apples_!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, \xe2\x80\x98and apples.\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come with me to my\r\nPicnic?\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lion said \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I should like it _very much indeed_!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd Bruno and the Lion went away together.\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that _all_?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, despondingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _quite_ all,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie slily replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a sentence or two\r\nmore. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there, Bruno?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d with a carelessness that was evidently put on: \xe2\x80\x9cjust a sentence\r\nor two more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, as they were walking along, they looked over a hedge, and who\r\nshould they see but a little black Lamb! And the Lamb was ever so\r\nfrightened. And it ran\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were _really_ flightened!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ran away. And Bruno ran after it. And he called \xe2\x80\x98Little Lamb! You\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of _this_ Lion! It _never_ kills things! It lives on\r\ncherries, and marmalade\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and _apples_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cOo _always_ forgets the apples!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you come with us to my Picnic?\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lamb\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I should like it _very much indeed_, if my Ma will let me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s go and ask your Ma!\xe2\x80\x99 And they went to the old\r\nSheep. And Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Please, may your little Lamb come to my Picnic?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd the Sheep said \xe2\x80\x98Yes, if it\xe2\x80\x99s learnt all its lessons.\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lamb\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, Ma! I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt _all_ my lessons!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretend it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any lessons!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno earnestly pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that would never do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cI ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t leave out all about\r\nthe lessons! And the old Sheep said \xe2\x80\x98Do you know your A B C yet? Have\r\nyou learnt A?\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lamb said \xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, Ma! I went to the A-field, and\r\nI helped them to make A!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Very good, my child! And have you learnt B?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, Ma! I went to the B-hive, and the B gave me some honey!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Very\r\ngood, my child! And have you learnt C?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, Ma! I went to the\r\nC-side, and I saw the ships sailing on the C!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Very good, my child! You\r\nmay go to Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s Picnic.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STARTING FOR BRUNO\xe2\x80\x99S PICNIC]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they set off. And Bruno walked in the middle, so that the Lamb\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t see the Lion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were _flightened_,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and it trembled so; and it got paler and paler; and, before they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngot to the top of the hill, it was a _white_ little Lamb\xe2\x80\x94as white as\r\nsnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _Bruno_ weren\xe2\x80\x99t flightened!\xe2\x80\x9d said the owner of that name. \xe2\x80\x9cSo _he_\r\nstaid black!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ stay black! He staid _pink_!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss you like this, you know, if you were _black_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo\xe2\x80\x99d _have_ to!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said with great decision. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, Bruno wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_Bruno_, oo know\xe2\x80\x94I mean, Bruno wasn\xe2\x80\x99t _me_\xe2\x80\x94I mean\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense,\r\nSylvie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said very humbly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, as they went\r\nalong, the Lion said \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I used to do when I was a\r\nyoung Lion. I used to hide behind trees, to watch for little Boys.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Bruno cuddled a little closer to her.) \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And, if a little thin scraggy\r\nBoy came by, why, I used to let him go. But, if a little fat juicy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno could bear no more. \xe2\x80\x9cPretend he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t juicy!\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded,\r\nhalf-sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie briskly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be done in a moment!\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x94if a little fat juicy Boy came by, why, I used to spring out and\r\ngobble him up! Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve no _idea_ what a delicious thing it is\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle juicy Boy!\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Oh, if you please, Sir, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ talk\r\nabout eating little boys! It makes me so _shivery_!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe real Bruno shivered, in sympathy with the hero.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Lion said \xe2\x80\x98Oh, well, we won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it, then! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what happened on my wedding-day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like _this_ part better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, patting my cheek to keep me\r\nawake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98There was, oh, such a lovely wedding-breakfast! At _one_ end of the\r\ntable there was a large plum-pudding. And at the other end there was a\r\nnice roasted _Lamb_! Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve no _idea_ what a delicious thing it is\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nnice roasted Lamb!\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lamb said \xe2\x80\x98Oh, if you please, Sir, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\ntalk about eating Lambs! It makes me so _shivery_!\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lion said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, well, we won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it, then!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n                           THE LITTLE FOXES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, when they got to the top of the hill, Bruno opened the hamper: and\r\nhe took out the Bread, and the Apples, and the Milk: and they ate, and\r\nthey drank. And when they\xe2\x80\x99d finished the Milk, and eaten half the Bread\r\nand half the Apples, the Lamb said \xe2\x80\x98Oh, my paws is so sticky! I want to\r\nwash my paws!\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lion said \xe2\x80\x98Well, go down the hill, and wash them\r\nin the brook, yonder. We\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for you!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt never comed back!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno solemnly whispered to me.\r\n\r\nBut Sylvie overheard him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not to whisper, Bruno! It spoils the\r\nstory! And when the Lamb had been gone a long time, the Lion said to\r\nBruno \xe2\x80\x98Do go and see after that silly little Lamb! It must have lost its\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno went down the hill. And when he got to the brook, he saw\r\nthe Lamb sitting on the bank: and who should be sitting by it but an old\r\nFox!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know who _should_ be sitting by it,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said thoughtfully to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cA old Fox _were_ sitting by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the old Fox were saying,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie went on, for once conceding the\r\ngrammatical point, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be ever so happy with us, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll only come and see us! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got three little Foxes there, and we\r\ndo love little Lambs so dearly!\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lamb said \xe2\x80\x98But you never _eat_\r\nthem, do you, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 And the Fox said \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no! What, _eat_ a Lamb? We\r\nnever _dream_ of doing such a thing!\xe2\x80\x99 So the Lamb said \xe2\x80\x98Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x99 And off they went, hand in hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Fox were welly extremely wicked, _weren\xe2\x80\x99t_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie, rather shocked at such violent language. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so bad as that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nice,\xe2\x80\x9d the little fellow corrected himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so Bruno went back to the Lion. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, come quick!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98The Fox\r\nhas taken the Lamb to his house with him! I\xe2\x80\x99m _sure_ he means to eat\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x99 And the Lion said \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll come as quick as ever I can!\xe2\x80\x99 And they\r\ntrotted down the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo oo think he caught the Fox, Mister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. I shook my\r\nhead, not liking to speak: and Sylvie went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when they got to the house, Bruno looked in at the window. And\r\nthere he saw the three little Foxes sitting round the table, with their\r\nclean pinafores on, and spoons in their hands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoons in their hands!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno repeated in an ecstasy of delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Fox had got a great big knife\xe2\x80\x94all ready to kill the poor little\r\nLamb\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cOo needn\xe2\x80\x99t be flightened, Mister Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno put in, in a\r\nhasty whisper.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98ENTER THE LION\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd just as he was going to do it, Bruno heard a great ROAR\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (The\r\nreal Bruno put his hand into mine, and held tight), \xe2\x80\x9cand the Lion came\r\n_bang_ through the door, and the next moment it had bitten off the old\r\nFox\xe2\x80\x99s head! And Bruno jumped in at the window, and went leaping round\r\nthe room, and crying out \xe2\x80\x98Hooray! Hooray! The old Fox is dead! The old\r\nFox is dead!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno got up in some excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I do it now?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired.\r\n\r\nSylvie was quite decided on this point. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThe speeches come next, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? You always love the\r\nspeeches, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I doos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno: and sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lion\xe2\x80\x99s speech. \xe2\x80\x98Now, you silly little Lamb, go home to your mother,\r\nand never listen to old Foxes again. And be very good and obedient.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lamb\xe2\x80\x99s speech. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed, Sir, I will, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 and the Lamb went\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cBut _oo_ needn\xe2\x80\x99t go away!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite the\r\nnicest part\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s coming now!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie smiled. She liked having an\r\nappreciative audience.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lion\xe2\x80\x99s speech to Bruno. \xe2\x80\x98Now, Bruno, take those little Foxes home\r\nwith you, and teach them to be good obedient little Foxes! Not like that\r\nwicked old thing there, that\xe2\x80\x99s got no head!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThat hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got no\r\nhead,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno repeated.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBruno\xe2\x80\x99s speech to the Lion. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed, Sir, I will, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 And the\r\nLion went away.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cIt gets betterer and betterer, now,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno whispered\r\nto me, \xe2\x80\x9cright away to the end!\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBruno\xe2\x80\x99s speech to the little Foxes. \xe2\x80\x98Now, little Foxes, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to\r\nhave your first lesson in being good. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put you into the\r\nhamper, along with the Apples and the Bread: and you\xe2\x80\x99re not to eat the\r\nApples: and you\xe2\x80\x99re not to eat the Bread: and you\xe2\x80\x99re not to eat\r\n_anything_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94till we get to my house: and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll have your supper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little Foxes\xe2\x80\x99 speech to Bruno. The little Foxes said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Bruno put the Apples into the hamper\xe2\x80\x94and the little Foxes\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nBread\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThey had picnicked all the Milk,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno explained in a\r\nwhisper) \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and he set off to go to his house.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re getting near the\r\nend now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, when he had got a little way, he thought he would look into the\r\nhamper, and see how the little Foxes were getting on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he opened the door\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9c_you\xe2\x80\x99re_ not telling the story! So he\r\nopened the door, and behold, there were no Apples! So Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Eldest\r\nlittle Fox, have _you_ been eating the Apples?\xe2\x80\x99 And the eldest little\r\nFox said \xe2\x80\x98No no no!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (It is impossible to give the tone in which Sylvie\r\nrepeated this rapid little \xe2\x80\x98No no no!\xe2\x80\x99 The nearest I can come to it is\r\nto say that it was much as if a young and excited duck had tried to\r\nquack the words. It was too quick for a quack, and yet too harsh to be\r\nanything else.) \xe2\x80\x9cThen he said \xe2\x80\x98Second little Fox, have _you_ been eating\r\nthe Apples?\xe2\x80\x99 And the second little Fox said \xe2\x80\x98No no no!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Youngest little Fox, have _you_ been eating the Apples?\xe2\x80\x99 And the\r\nyoungest little Fox _tried_ to say \xe2\x80\x98No no no!\xe2\x80\x99 but its mouth was so\r\nfull, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and it only said \xe2\x80\x98Wauch! Wauch! Wauch!\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno\r\nlooked into its mouth. And its mouth was full of Apples! And Bruno shook\r\nhis head, and he said \xe2\x80\x98Oh dear, oh dear! What bad creatures these Foxes\r\nare!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno was listening intently: and, when Sylvie paused to take breath, he\r\ncould only just gasp out the words \xe2\x80\x9cAbout the Bread?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bread comes next. So he shut the door again;\r\nand he went a little further; and then he thought he\xe2\x80\x99d just peep in once\r\nmore. And behold, there was no Bread!\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do \xe2\x80\x98behold\xe2\x80\x99 _mean_?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBruno. \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he said \xe2\x80\x98Eldest little Fox, have _you_\r\nbeen eating the Bread?\xe2\x80\x99 And the eldest little Fox said \xe2\x80\x98No no no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Second little Fox, have _you_ been eating the Bread?\xe2\x80\x99 And the second\r\nlittle Fox only said \xe2\x80\x98Wauch! Wauch! Wauch!\xe2\x80\x99 And Bruno looked into its\r\nmouth, and its mouth was full of Bread!\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cIt might have chokeded it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bruno.) \xe2\x80\x9cSo he said \xe2\x80\x98Oh dear, oh dear! What _shall_ I do with these\r\nFoxes?\xe2\x80\x99 And he went a little further.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cNow comes the most interesting\r\npart,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno whispered.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when Bruno opened the hamper again, what do you think he saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cOnly _two_ Foxes!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno cried in a great hurry.) \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nit so quick. However, he _did_ see only _two_ Foxes. And he said \xe2\x80\x98Eldest\r\nlittle Fox, have you been eating the youngest little Fox?\xe2\x80\x99 And the\r\neldest little Fox said \xe2\x80\x98No no no!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Second little Fox, have _you_ been\r\neating the youngest little Fox?\xe2\x80\x99 And the second little Fox did its very\r\nbest to say \xe2\x80\x98No no no!\xe2\x80\x99 but it could only say \xe2\x80\x98Weuchk! Weuchk! Weuchk!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd when Bruno looked into its mouth, it was half full of Bread, and\r\nhalf full of Fox!\xe2\x80\x9d (Bruno said nothing in the pause this time. He was\r\nbeginning to pant a little, as he knew the crisis was coming.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when he\xe2\x80\x99d got nearly home, he looked once more into the hamper, and\r\nhe saw\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno began, but a generous thought struck him, and he looked\r\nat me. \xe2\x80\x9c_Oo_ may say it, _this_ time, Mister Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. It was\r\na noble offer, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rob him of the treat. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Bruno,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cyou say it much the best.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94_one_\xe2\x80\x94Fox!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said with\r\ngreat solemnity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98WHIHUAUCH! WHIHUAUCH!\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Eldest little Fox,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, dropping the narrative-form in her\r\neagerness, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ve been _so_ good that I can hardly believe _you\xe2\x80\x99ve_\r\nbeen disobedient: but I\xe2\x80\x99m _afraid_ you\xe2\x80\x99ve been eating your little\r\nsister?\xe2\x80\x99 And the eldest little Fox said \xe2\x80\x98Whihuauch! Whihuauch!\xe2\x80\x99 and then\r\nit choked. And Bruno looked into its mouth, and it _was_ full!\xe2\x80\x9d (Sylvie\r\npaused to take breath, and Bruno lay back among the daisies, and looked\r\nat me triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it _grand_, Mister Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. I tried\r\nhard to assume a critical tone. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s grand,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cbut it frightens\r\none so!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOo may sit a little closer to _me_, if oo like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so Bruno went home: and took the hamper into the kitchen, and\r\nopened it. And he saw\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie looked at _me_, this time, as if she\r\nthought I had been rather neglected and ought to be allowed _one_ guess,\r\nat any rate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t guess!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno cried eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99fraid I _must_ tell him!\r\nThere weren\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94_nuffin_ in the hamper!\xe2\x80\x9d I shivered in terror, and Bruno\r\nclapped his hands with delight. \xe2\x80\x9cHe _is_ flightened, Sylvie! Tell the\r\nrest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Bruno said \xe2\x80\x98Eldest little Fox, have you been eating _yourself_, you\r\nwicked little Fox?\xe2\x80\x99 And the eldest little Fox said \xe2\x80\x98Whihuauch!\xe2\x80\x99 And then\r\nBruno saw there was only its _mouth_ in the hamper! So he took the\r\nmouth, and he opened it, and shook, and shook! And at last he shook the\r\nlittle Fox out of its own mouth! And then he said \xe2\x80\x98Open your mouth\r\nagain, you wicked little thing!\xe2\x80\x99 And he shook, and shook! And he shook\r\nout the second little Fox! And he said \xe2\x80\x98Now open _your_ mouth!\xe2\x80\x99 And he\r\nshook, and shook! And he shook out the youngest little Fox, and all the\r\nApples, and all the Bread!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then Bruno stood the little Foxes up against the wall: and he made\r\nthem a little speech. \xe2\x80\x98Now, little Foxes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve begun very wickedly\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be punished. First you\xe2\x80\x99ll go up to the nursery, and wash\r\nyour faces, and put on clean pinafores. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the bell ring\r\nfor supper. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll come down: and _you won\xe2\x80\x99t have any supper_: but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a good _whipping_! Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll go to bed. Then in the\r\nmorning you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the bell ring for breakfast. _But you won\xe2\x80\x99t have any\r\nbreakfast!_ You\xe2\x80\x99ll have a good _whipping_! Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll have your\r\nlessons. And, perhaps, if you\xe2\x80\x99re _very_ good, when dinner-time comes,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little dinner, and no more whipping!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cHow _very_ kind\r\nhe was!\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered to Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9c_Middling_ kind,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno corrected me\r\ngravely.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the little Foxes ran up to the nursery. And soon Bruno went into the\r\nhall, and rang the big bell. \xe2\x80\x98Tingle, tingle, tingle! Supper, supper,\r\nsupper!\xe2\x80\x99 Down came the little Foxes, in such a hurry for their supper!\r\nClean pinafores! Spoons in their hands! And, when they got into the\r\ndining-room, there was ever such a white table-cloth on the table! But\r\nthere was nothing on it but a big whip. And they had _such_ a whipping!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(I put my handkerchief to my eyes, and Bruno hastily climbed upon my\r\nknee and stroked my face. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly _one_ more whipping, Mister Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry more than oo ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t help!\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next morning early, Bruno rang the big bell again. \xe2\x80\x98Tingle,\r\ntingle, tingle! Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!\xe2\x80\x99 Down came the little\r\nFoxes! Clean pinafores! Spoons in their hands! No breakfast! Only the\r\nbig whip! Then came lessons,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie hurried on, for I still had my\r\nhandkerchief to my eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the little Foxes were ever so good! And\r\nthey learned their lessons backwards, and forwards, and upside-down. And\r\nat last Bruno rang the big bell again. \xe2\x80\x98Tingle, tingle, tingle! Dinner,\r\ndinner, dinner!\xe2\x80\x99 And when the little Foxes came down\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cHad they clean\r\npinafores on?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno enquired. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd spoons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you _know_ they had!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be _certain_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.) \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94they\r\ncame as slow as slow! And they said \xe2\x80\x98Oh! There\xe2\x80\x99ll be no dinner! There\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nonly be the big whip!\xe2\x80\x99 But, when they got into the room, they saw the\r\nmost _lovely_ dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cBuns?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno, clapping his hands.) \xe2\x80\x9cBuns,\r\nand cake, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and jam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.) \xe2\x80\x9cYes, jam\xe2\x80\x94and soup\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and _sugar plums_!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno put in once more; and Sylvie seemed\r\nsatisfied.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ever after that, they _were_ such good little Foxes! They did their\r\nlessons as good as gold\xe2\x80\x94and they never did what Bruno told them not\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94and they never ate each other any more\xe2\x80\x94and _they never ate\r\nthemselves_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe story came to an end so suddenly, it almost took my breath away;\r\nhowever I did my best to make a pretty speech of thanks. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery\xe2\x80\x94very\xe2\x80\x94very much so, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure!\xe2\x80\x9d I seemed to hear myself say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n                          BEYOND THESE VOICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite catch what you said!\xe2\x80\x9d were the next words that reached\r\nmy ear, but certainly _not_ in the voice either of Sylvie or of Bruno,\r\nwhom I could just see, through the crowd of guests, standing by the\r\npiano, and listening to the Count\xe2\x80\x99s song. Mein Herr was the speaker. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t quite catch what you said!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt you\r\ntake _my_ view of it. Thank you _very_ much for your kind attention.\r\nThere is only but _one_ verse left to be sung!\xe2\x80\x9d These last words were\r\nnot in the gentle voice of Mein Herr, but in the deep bass of the French\r\nCount. And, in the silence that followed, the final stanza of \xe2\x80\x98Tottles\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrang through the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98NEVER!\xe2\x80\x99 YELLED TOTTLES]\r\n\r\n  See now this couple settled down\r\n  In quiet lodgings, out of town:\r\n  Submissively the tearful wife\r\n  Accepts a plain and humble life:\r\n  Yet begs one boon on bended knee:\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98My ducky-darling, don\xe2\x80\x99t resent it!\r\n  Mamma might come for two or three\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98NEVER!\xe2\x80\x99 yelled Tottles. And he meant it.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the song was followed by quite a chorus of thanks and\r\ncompliments from all parts of the room, which the gratified singer\r\nresponded to by bowing low in all directions. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is to me a great\r\nprivilege,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Lady Muriel, \xe2\x80\x9cto have met with this so marvellous\r\na song. The accompaniment to him is so strange, so mysterious: it is as\r\nif a new music were to be invented! I will play him once again so as\r\nthat to show you what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d He returned to the piano, but the song\r\nhad vanished.\r\n\r\nThe bewildered singer searched through the heap of music lying on an\r\nadjoining table, but it was not there, either. Lady Muriel helped in the\r\nsearch: others soon joined: the excitement grew. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _can_ have become\r\nof it?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Muriel. Nobody knew: one thing only was certain,\r\nthat no one had been near the piano since the Count had sung the last\r\nverse of the song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevare mind him!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, most good-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall give it you\r\nwith memory alone!\xe2\x80\x9d He sat down, and began vaguely fingering the notes;\r\nbut nothing resembling the tune came out. Then he, too, grew excited.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what oddness! How much of singularity! That I might lose, not the\r\nwords alone, but the tune also\xe2\x80\x94that is quite curious, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all supposed it, heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was that sweet little boy, who found it for me,\xe2\x80\x9d the Count\r\nsuggested. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite perhaps _he_ is the thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cBruno! Where are you, my\r\ndarling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no Bruno replied: it seemed that the two children had vanished as\r\nsuddenly, and as mysteriously, as the song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are playing us a trick!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel gaily exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nonly an _ex tempore_ game of Hide-and-Seek! That little Bruno is an\r\nembodied Mischief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was a welcome one to most of us, for some of the guests\r\nwere beginning to look decidedly uneasy. A general search was set on\r\nfoot with much enthusiasm: curtains were thrown back and shaken,\r\ncupboards opened, and ottomans turned over; but the number of possible\r\nhiding-places proved to be strictly limited; and the search came to an\r\nend almost as soon as it had begun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must have run out, while we were wrapped up in the song,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady\r\nMuriel said, addressing herself to the Count, who seemed more agitated\r\nthan the others; \xe2\x80\x9cand no doubt they\xe2\x80\x99ve found their way back to the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by _this_ door!\xe2\x80\x9d was the earnest protest of a knot of two or three\r\ngentlemen, who had been grouped round the door (one of them actually\r\nleaning against it) for the last half-hour, as they declared. \xe2\x80\x9c_This_\r\ndoor has not been opened since the song began!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn uncomfortable silence followed this announcement. Lady Muriel\r\nventured no further conjectures, but quietly examined the fastenings of\r\nthe windows, which opened as doors. They all proved to be well fastened,\r\n_inside_.\r\n\r\nNot yet at the end of her resources, Lady Muriel rang the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk the\r\nhousekeeper to step here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand to bring the children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalking-things with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve brought them, my Lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the obsequious housekeeper, entering\r\nafter another minute of silence. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought the young lady would have\r\ncome to my room to put on her boots. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your boots, my love!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded cheerfully, looking in all directions for the children. There was\r\nno answer, and she turned to Lady Muriel with a puzzled smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHave the\r\nlittle darlings hid themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see them, just now,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel replied, rather evasively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can leave their things here, Wilson. _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ dress them, when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re ready to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two little hats, and Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s walking-jacket, were handed round\r\namong the ladies, with many exclamations of delight. There certainly was\r\na sort of witchery of beauty about them. Even the little boots did not\r\nmiss their share of favorable criticism. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch natty little things!\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nmusical young lady exclaimed, almost fondling them as she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwhat tiny tiny feet they must have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinally, the things were piled together on the centre-ottoman, and the\r\nguests, despairing of seeing the children again, began to wish\r\ngood-night and leave the house.\r\n\r\nThere were only some eight or nine left\xe2\x80\x94to whom the Count was\r\nexplaining, for the twentieth time, how he had had his eye on the\r\nchildren during the last verse of the song; how he had then glanced\r\nround the room, to see what effect \xe2\x80\x9cde great chest-note\xe2\x80\x9d had had upon\r\nhis audience; and how, when he looked back again, they had both\r\ndisappeared\xe2\x80\x94when exclamations of dismay began to be heard on all sides,\r\nthe Count hastily bringing his story to an end to join in the outcry.\r\n\r\nThe walking-things had all disappeared!\r\n\r\nAfter the utter failure of the search for the _children_, there was a\r\nvery half-hearted search made for their _apparel_. The remaining guests\r\nseemed only too glad to get away, leaving only the Count and our four\r\nselves.\r\n\r\nThe Count sank into an easy-chair, and panted a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho then _are_ these dear children, I pray you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy come\r\nthey, why go they, in this so little ordinary a fashion? That the music\r\nshould make itself to vanish\xe2\x80\x94that the hats, the boots, should make\r\nthemselves to vanish\xe2\x80\x94how is it, I pray you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea where they are!\xe2\x80\x9d was all I could say, on finding myself\r\nappealed to, by general consent, for an explanation.\r\n\r\nThe Count seemed about to ask further questions, but checked himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hour makes himself to become late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to you a very\r\ngood night, my Lady. I betake myself to my bed\xe2\x80\x94to dream\xe2\x80\x94if that indeed I\r\nbe not dreaming now!\xe2\x80\x9d And he hastily left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay awhile, stay awhile!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl, as I was about to follow the\r\nCount. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ are not a guest, you know! Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s friend is at _home_\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as, with true English instincts, we drew our chairs\r\ntogether round the fire-place, though no fire was burning\xe2\x80\x94Lady Muriel\r\nhaving taken the heap of music on her knee, to have one more search for\r\nthe strangely-vanished song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you sometimes feel a wild longing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, addressing herself\r\nto me, \xe2\x80\x9cto have something more to do with your hands, while you talk,\r\nthan just holding a cigar, and now and then knocking off the ash? Oh, I\r\nknow all that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say!\xe2\x80\x9d (This was to Arthur, who appeared\r\nabout to interrupt her.) \xe2\x80\x9cThe Majesty of Thought supersedes the work of\r\nthe fingers. A Man\xe2\x80\x99s severe thinking, _plus_ the shaking-off a\r\ncigar-ash, comes to the same total as a Woman\xe2\x80\x99s trivial fancies, _plus_\r\nthe most elaborate embroidery. _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ your sentiment, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, only\r\nbetter expressed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur looked into the radiant, mischievous face, with a grave and very\r\ntender smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said resignedly: \xe2\x80\x9cthat is my sentiment,\r\nexactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest of body, and activity of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d I put in. \xe2\x80\x9cSome writer tells us\r\n_that_ is the acme of human happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of _bodily_ rest, at any rate!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel replied, glancing at\r\nthe three recumbent figures around her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what you call activity of\r\n_mind_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94is the privilege of young Physicians _only_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl. \xe2\x80\x9cWe old\r\nmen have no claim to be active! _What can an old man do but die?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good many other things, I should _hope_,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur said earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe. Still you have the advantage of me in many ways, dear boy!\r\nNot only that _your_ day is dawning while _mine_ is setting, but your\r\n_interest_ in Life\xe2\x80\x94somehow I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t help envying you _that_. It will be\r\nmany a year before you lose your hold of _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet surely many human interests _survive_ human Life?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany do, no doubt. And _some_ forms of Science; but only _some_, I\r\nthink. Mathematics, for instance: _that_ seems to possess an endless\r\ninterest: one ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t imagine _any_ form of Life, or _any_ race of\r\nintelligent beings, where Mathematical truth would lose its meaning. But\r\nI fear _Medicine_ stands on a different footing. Suppose you discover a\r\nremedy for some disease hitherto supposed to be incurable. Well, it is\r\ndelightful for the moment, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94full of interest\xe2\x80\x94perhaps it brings\r\nyou fame and fortune. But what then? Look on, a few years, into a life\r\nwhere disease has no existence. What is your discovery worth, _then_?\r\nMilton makes Jove promise too much. \xe2\x80\x98_Of so much fame in heaven expect\r\nthy meed._\xe2\x80\x99 Poor comfort, when one\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98fame\xe2\x80\x99 concerns matters that will\r\nhave ceased to have a meaning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care to make any _fresh_ medical\r\ndiscoveries,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cI see no help for _that_\xe2\x80\x94though I shall be\r\nsorry to give up my favorite studies. Still, medicine, disease, pain,\r\nsorrow, sin\xe2\x80\x94I fear they\xe2\x80\x99re all linked together. Banish sin, and you\r\nbanish them all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Military_ science is a yet stronger instance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout\r\nsin, _war_ would surely be impossible. Still any mind, that has had in\r\nthis life any keen interest, not in _itself_ sinful, will surely find\r\nitself _some_ congenial line of work hereafter. Wellington may have no\r\nmore _battles_ to fight\xe2\x80\x94and yet\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98We doubt not that, for one so true,\r\n  There must be other, nobler work to do,\r\n  Than when he fought at Waterloo,\r\n        And Victor he must ever be!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lingered over the beautiful words, as if he loved them: and his\r\nvoice, like distant music, died away into silence.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two he began again. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m not wearying you, I would\r\nlike to tell you an idea of the future Life which has haunted me for\r\nyears, like a sort of waking nightmare\xe2\x80\x94I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t reason myself out of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray do,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur and I replied, almost in a breath. Lady Muriel put\r\naside the heap of music, and folded her hands together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one idea,\xe2\x80\x9d the Earl resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat has seemed to me to overshadow\r\nall the rest, is that of _Eternity_\xe2\x80\x94involving, as it seems to do, the\r\nnecessary _exhaustion_ of all subjects of human interest. Take Pure\r\nMathematics, for instance\xe2\x80\x94a Science independent of our present\r\nsurroundings. I have studied it, myself, a little. Take the subject of\r\ncircles and ellipses\xe2\x80\x94what we call \xe2\x80\x98curves of the second degree.\xe2\x80\x99 In a\r\nfuture Life, it would only be a question of so many years (or _hundreds_\r\nof years, if you like), for a man to work out _all_ their properties.\r\nThen he _might_ go to curves of the third degree. Say _that_ took ten\r\ntimes as long (you see we have _unlimited_ time to deal with). I can\r\nhardly imagine his _interest_ in the subject holding out even for those;\r\nand, though there is no limit to the _degree_ of the curves he might\r\nstudy, yet surely the time, needed to exhaust _all_ the novelty and\r\ninterest of the subject, would be absolutely _finite_? And so of all\r\nother branches of Science. And, when I transport myself, in thought,\r\nthrough some thousands or millions of years, and fancy myself possessed\r\nof as much Science as one created reason can carry, I ask myself \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nthen? With nothing more to learn, can one rest content on _knowledge_,\r\nfor the eternity yet to be lived through?\xe2\x80\x99 It has been a very wearying\r\nthought to me. I have sometimes fancied one _might_, in that event, say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is better _not_ to be,\xe2\x80\x99 and pray for personal _annihilation_\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nNirvana of the Buddhists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is only half the picture,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides working for\r\n_oneself_, may there not be the helping of _others_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, surely!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel exclaimed in a tone of relief, looking at\r\nher father with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as there _were_ any others needing help.\r\nBut, given ages and ages more, surely all created reasons would at\r\nlength reach the same dead level of _satiety_. And _then_ what is there\r\nto look forward to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that weary feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cI have gone through\r\nit all, more than once. Now let me tell you how I have put it to myself.\r\nI have imagined a little child, playing with toys on his nursery-floor,\r\nand yet able to _reason_, and to look on, thirty years ahead. Might he\r\nnot say to himself \xe2\x80\x98By that time I shall have had enough of bricks and\r\nninepins. How weary Life will be!\xe2\x80\x99 Yet, if we look forward through those\r\nthirty years, we find him a great statesman, full of interests and joys\r\nfar more intense than his baby-life could give\xe2\x80\x94joys wholly inconceivable\r\nto his baby-mind\xe2\x80\x94joys such as no baby-language could in the faintest\r\ndegree describe. Now, may not our life, a million years hence, have the\r\nsame relation, to our life now, that the man\xe2\x80\x99s life has to the child\xe2\x80\x99s?\r\nAnd, just as one might try, all in vain, to express to that child, in\r\nthe language of bricks and ninepins, the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98politics,\xe2\x80\x99 so\r\nperhaps all those descriptions of Heaven, with its music, and its\r\nfeasts, and its streets of gold, may be only attempts to describe, in\r\n_our_ words, things for which we _really_ have no words at all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think that, in _your_ picture of another life, you are in fact\r\ntransplanting that child into political life, without making any\r\nallowance for his growing up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl. \xe2\x80\x9cThe music of Heaven _may_ be\r\nsomething beyond our powers of thought. Yet the music of Earth is sweet!\r\nMuriel, my child, sing us something before we go to bed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, as he rose and lit the candles on the cottage-piano,\r\nlately banished from the drawing-room to make room for a \xe2\x80\x98semi-grand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a song here, that I have never heard you sing.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98Hail to thee, blithe spirit!\r\n    Bird thou never wert,\r\n  That from Heaven, or near it,\r\n    Pourest thy full heart!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nhe read from the page he had spread open before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our little life here,\xe2\x80\x9d the Earl went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis, to that grand time,\r\nlike a child\xe2\x80\x99s summer-day! One gets tired as night draws on,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nwith a touch of sadness in his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cand one gets to long for bed! For\r\nthose welcome words \xe2\x80\x98Come, child, \xe2\x80\x99tis bed-time!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n                             TO THE RESCUE!\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ bed-time!\xe2\x80\x9d said a sleepy little voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe owls hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone\r\nto bed, and I s\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t go to seep wizout oo sings to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know the owls have only just got\r\nup? But the _frogs_ have gone to bed, ages ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _I_ aren\xe2\x80\x99t a frog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I sing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie, skilfully avoiding the argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Mister Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno lazily replied, clasping his hands behind his\r\ncurly head, and lying back on his fern-leaf, till it almost bent over\r\nwith his weight. \xe2\x80\x9cThis aren\xe2\x80\x99t a comfable leaf, Sylvie. Find me a\r\ncomfabler\xe2\x80\x94please!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as an after-thought, in obedience to a\r\nwarning finger held up by Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cI doosn\xe2\x80\x99t like being feet-upwards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty sight to see\xe2\x80\x94the motherly way in which the fairy-child\r\ngathered up her little brother in her arms, and laid him on a stronger\r\nleaf. She gave it just a touch to set it rocking, and it went on\r\nvigorously by itself, as if it contained some hidden machinery. It\r\ncertainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the wind, for the evening-breeze had quite died away\r\nagain, and not a leaf was stirring over our heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does that one leaf rock so, without the others?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Sylvie.\r\nShe only smiled sweetly and shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know _why_,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt always does, if it\xe2\x80\x99s got a fairy-child on it. It _has_ to, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can people see the leaf rock, who ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t see the Fairy on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cA leaf\xe2\x80\x99s a leaf, and everybody can see\r\nit; but Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s Bruno, and they ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t see _him_, unless they\xe2\x80\x99re eerie,\r\nlike you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I understood how it was that one sometimes sees\xe2\x80\x94going through the\r\nwoods in a still evening\xe2\x80\x94one fern-leaf rocking steadily on, all by\r\nitself. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you ever seen that? Try if you can see the fairy-sleeper\r\non it, next time; but don\xe2\x80\x99t _pick_ the leaf, whatever you do; let the\r\nlittle one sleep on!\r\n\r\nBut all this time Bruno was getting sleepier and sleepier. \xe2\x80\x9cSing, sing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe murmured fretfully. Sylvie looked to me for instructions. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall\r\nit be?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you sing him the nursery-song you once told me of?\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one that had been put through the mind-mangle, you know. \xe2\x80\x98_The\r\nlittle man that had a little gun_,\xe2\x80\x99 I think it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that are one of the _Professor\xe2\x80\x99s_ songs!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cI likes\r\nthe little man; and I likes the way they spinned him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94like a\r\nteetle-totle-tum.\xe2\x80\x9d And he turned a loving look on the gentle old man who\r\nwas sitting at the other side of his leaf-bed, and who instantly began\r\nto sing, accompanying himself on his Outlandish guitar, while the snail,\r\non which he sat, waved its horns in time to the music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRUNO\xe2\x80\x99S BED-TIME]\r\n\r\n  In stature the Manlet was dwarfish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    No burly big Blunderbore he:\r\n  And he wearily gazed on the crawfish\r\n    His Wifelet had dressed for his tea.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cNow reach me, sweet Atom, my gunlet,\r\n    And hurl the old shoelet for luck:\r\n  Let me hie to the bank of the runlet,\r\n              And shoot thee a Duck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  She has reached him his minikin gunlet:\r\n    She has hurled the old shoelet for luck:\r\n  She is busily baking a bunlet,\r\n    To welcome him home with his Duck.\r\n  On he speeds, never wasting a wordlet,\r\n    Though thoughtlets cling, closely as wax,\r\n  To the spot where the beautiful birdlet\r\n                So quietly quacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98LONG CEREMONIOUS CALLS\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n  Where the Lobsterlet lurks, and the Crablet\r\n    So slowly and sleepily crawls:\r\n  Where the Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s at home, and the Dablet\r\n    Pays long ceremonious calls:\r\n  Where the Grublet is sought by the Froglet:\r\n    Where the Frog is pursued by the Duck:\r\n  Where the Ducklet is chased by the Doglet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n              So runs the world\xe2\x80\x99s luck!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VOICES]\r\n\r\n  He has loaded with bullet and powder:\r\n    His footfall is noiseless as air:\r\n  But the Voices grow louder and louder,\r\n    And bellow, and bluster, and blare.\r\n  They bristle before him and after,\r\n    They flutter above and below,\r\n  Shrill shriekings of lubberly laughter,\r\n                Weird wailings of woe!\r\n\r\n  They echo without him, within him:\r\n    They thrill through his whiskers and beard:\r\n  Like a teetotum seeming to spin him,\r\n    With sneers never hitherto sneered.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAvengement,\xe2\x80\x9d they cry, \xe2\x80\x9con our Foelet!\r\n    Let the Manikin weep for our wrongs!\r\n  Let us drench him, from toplet to toelet,\r\n              With Nursery-Songs!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98HIS SOUL SHALL BE SAD FOR THE SPIDER\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall muse upon \xe2\x80\x98Hey!

Nay, it\r\nwas only _one_ of the three who had the chivalry to go beyond the\r\ncommon-place \xe2\x80\x9cthank you,\xe2\x80\x9d and to quote the Poet\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite description\r\nof how Geraint, when waited on by Enid, was moved\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cTo stoop and kiss the tender little thumb\r\n  That crossed the platter as she laid it down,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nand to suit the action to the word\xe2\x80\x94an audacious liberty for which, I\r\nfeel bound to report, he was _not_ duly reprimanded.\r\n\r\nAs no topic of conversation seemed to occur to any one, and as we were,\r\nall four, on those delightful terms with one another (the only terms, I\r\nthink, on which any friendship, that deserves the name of _intimacy_,\r\ncan be maintained) which involve no sort of necessity for _speaking_ for\r\nmere speaking\xe2\x80\x99s sake, we sat in silence for some minutes.\r\n\r\nAt length I broke the silence by asking \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any fresh news from\r\nthe harbour about the Fever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone since this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d the Earl said, looking very grave. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\r\nwas alarming enough. The Fever is spreading fast: the London doctor has\r\ntaken fright and left the place, and the only one now available isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nregular doctor at all: he is apothecary, and doctor, and dentist, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what other trades, all in one. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad outlook for those\r\npoor fishermen\xe2\x80\x94and a worse one for all the women and children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many are there of them altogether?\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were nearly one hundred, a week ago.\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl: \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\r\nhave been twenty or thirty deaths since then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what religious ministrations are there to be had?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are three brave men down there,\xe2\x80\x9d the Earl replied, his voice\r\ntrembling with emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cgallant heroes as ever won the Victoria Cross!\r\nI am certain that no one of the three will ever leave the place merely\r\nto save his own life. There\xe2\x80\x99s the Curate: his wife is with him: they\r\nhave no children. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the Roman Catholic Priest. And there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe Wesleyan Minister. They go amongst their own flocks, mostly; but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntold that those who are dying like to have _any_ of the three with them.\r\nHow slight the barriers seem to be that part Christian from Christian,\r\nwhen one has to deal with the great facts of Life and the reality of\r\nDeath!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it must be, and so it should be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur was beginning, when the\r\nfront-door bell rang, suddenly and violently.\r\n\r\nWe heard the front-door hastily opened, and voices outside: then a knock\r\nat the door of the smoking-room, and the old house-keeper appeared,\r\nlooking a little scared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo persons, my Lord, to speak with Dr. Forester.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur stepped outside at once, and we heard his cheery \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut the answer was less audible, the only words I could distinctly catch\r\nbeing \xe2\x80\x9cten since morning, and two more just\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there _is_ a doctor there?\xe2\x80\x9d we heard Arthur say: and a deep voice,\r\nthat we had not heard before, replied \xe2\x80\x9cDead, Sir. Died three hours ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel shuddered, and hid her face in her hands: but at this moment\r\nthe front-door was quietly closed, and we heard no more.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes we sat quite silent: then the Earl left the room, and\r\nsoon returned to tell us that Arthur had gone away with the two\r\nfishermen, leaving word that he would be back in about an hour. And,\r\ntrue enough, at the end of that interval\xe2\x80\x94during which very little was\r\nsaid, none of us seeming to have the heart to talk\xe2\x80\x94the front-door once\r\nmore creaked on its rusty hinges, and a step was heard in the passage,\r\nhardly to be recognised as Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, so slow and uncertain was it, like\r\na blind man feeling his way.\r\n\r\nHe came in, and stood before Lady Muriel, resting one hand heavily on\r\nthe table, and with a strange look in his eyes, as if he were walking in\r\nhis sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuriel\xe2\x80\x94my love\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he paused, and his lips quivered: but after a minute\r\nhe went on more steadily. \xe2\x80\x9cMuriel\xe2\x80\x94my darling\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x94_want_ me\xe2\x80\x94down in the\r\nharbour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Must_ you go?\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, rising and laying her hands on his\r\nshoulders, and looking up into his face with her great eyes brimming\r\nover with tears. \xe2\x80\x9cMust _you_ go, Arthur? It may mean\xe2\x80\x94death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe met her gaze without flinching. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _does_ mean death,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a\r\nhusky whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x94darling\xe2\x80\x94I am _called_. And even my life itself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis voice failed him, and he said no more.\r\n\r\nFor a minute she stood quite silent, looking upwards with a helpless\r\ngaze, as if even prayer were now useless, while her features worked and\r\nquivered with the great agony she was enduring. Then a sudden\r\ninspiration seemed to come upon her and light up her face with a strange\r\nsweet smile. \xe2\x80\x9c_Your_ life?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not _yours_ to give!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur had recovered himself by this time, and could reply quite firmly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not _mine_ to give. It is _yours_, now,\r\nmy\xe2\x80\x94wife that is to be! And you\xe2\x80\x94do _you_ forbid me to go? Will you not\r\nspare me, my own beloved one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill clinging to him, she laid her head softly on his breast. She had\r\nnever done such a thing in my presence before, and I knew how deeply she\r\nmust be moved. \xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ spare you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, calmly and quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nGod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to God\xe2\x80\x99s poor,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to God\xe2\x80\x99s poor,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen must it be, sweet love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98WILL YOU NOT SPARE ME?\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have much to do before then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he told us how he had spent his hour of absence. He had been to\r\nthe Vicarage, and had arranged for the wedding to take place at eight\r\nthe next morning (there was no legal obstacle, as he had, some time\r\nbefore this, obtained a Special License) in the little church we knew so\r\nwell. \xe2\x80\x9cMy old friend here,\xe2\x80\x9d indicating me, \xe2\x80\x9cwill act as \xe2\x80\x98Best Man,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nknow: your father will be there to give you away: and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94you will\r\ndispense with bride\xe2\x80\x99s-maids, my darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded: no words came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I can go with a willing heart\xe2\x80\x94to do God\xe2\x80\x99s work\xe2\x80\x94knowing that we\r\nare _one_\xe2\x80\x94and that we are together in _spirit_, though not in bodily\r\npresence\xe2\x80\x94and are most of all together when we pray! Our _prayers_ will\r\ngo up together\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you must not stay longer now, my\r\ndarling! Go home and take some rest. You will need all your strength\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will be here in good time to-morrow.\r\nGood night, my own own darling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed his example, and we two left the house together. As we walked\r\nback to our lodgings, Arthur sighed deeply once or twice, and seemed\r\nabout to speak\xe2\x80\x94but no words came, till we had entered the house, and had\r\nlit our candles, and were at our bedroom-doors. Then Arthur said \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nnight, old fellow! God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d I echoed, from the very depths of my heart.\r\n\r\nWe were back again at the Hall by eight in the morning, and found Lady\r\nMuriel and the Earl, and the old Vicar, waiting for us. It was a\r\nstrangely sad and silent party that walked up to the little church and\r\nback; and I could not help feeling that it was much more like a funeral\r\nthan a wedding: to Lady Muriel it _was_ in fact, a funeral rather than a\r\nwedding, so heavily did the presentiment weigh upon her (as she told us\r\nafterwards) that her newly-won husband was going forth to his death.\r\n\r\nThen we had breakfast; and, all too soon, the vehicle was at the door,\r\nwhich was to convey Arthur, first to his lodgings, to pick up the things\r\nhe was taking with him, and then as far towards the death-stricken\r\nhamlet as it was considered safe to go. One or two of the fishermen were\r\nto meet him on the road, to carry his things the rest of the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you quite sure you are taking all that you will need?\xe2\x80\x9d Lady\r\nMuriel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that I shall need as a _doctor_, certainly. And my own personal\r\nneeds are few: I shall not even take any of my own wardrobe\xe2\x80\x94there is a\r\nfisherman\xe2\x80\x99s suit, ready-made, that is waiting for me at my lodgings. I\r\nshall only take my watch, and a few books, and\xe2\x80\x94stay\xe2\x80\x94there _is_ one book\r\nI should like to add, a pocket-Testament\xe2\x80\x94to use at the bedsides of the\r\nsick and dying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake mine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel: and she ran upstairs to fetch it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has\r\nnothing written in it but \xe2\x80\x98Muriel,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she returned with it:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshall I inscribe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my own one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, taking it from her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _could_ you\r\ninscribe better than that? Could any human name mark it more clearly as\r\nmy own individual property? Are _you_ not mine? Are you not,\xe2\x80\x9d (with all\r\nthe old playfulness of manner) \xe2\x80\x9cas Bruno would say, \xe2\x80\x98my _very mine_\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bade a long and loving adieu to the Earl and to me, and left the\r\nroom, accompanied only by his wife, who was bearing up bravely, and\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94_outwardly_, at least\xe2\x80\x94less overcome than her old father. We waited\r\nin the room a minute or two, till the sound of wheels had told us that\r\nArthur had driven away; and even then we waited still, for the step of\r\nLady Muriel, going upstairs to her room, to die away in the distance.\r\nHer step, usually so light and joyous, now sounded slow and weary, like\r\none who plods on under a load of hopeless misery; and I felt almost as\r\nhopeless, and almost as wretched, as she. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we four destined _ever_\r\nto meet again, on this side the grave?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked myself, as I walked to\r\nmy home. And the tolling of a distant bell seemed to answer me, \xe2\x80\x9cNo! No!\r\nNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n                          A NEWSPAPER-CUTTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _EXTRACT FROM THE \xe2\x80\x9cFAYFIELD CHRONICLE.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n_Our readers will have followed with painful interest, the accounts we\r\nhave from time to time published of the terrible epidemic which has,\r\nduring the last two months, carried off most of the inhabitants of the\r\nlittle fishing-harbour adjoining the village of Elveston. The last\r\nsurvivors, numbering twenty-three only, out of a population which, three\r\nshort months ago, exceeded one hundred and twenty, were removed on\r\nWednesday last, under the authority of the Local Board, and safely\r\nlodged in the County Hospital: and the place is now veritably \xe2\x80\x98a city of\r\nthe dead,\xe2\x80\x99 without a single human voice to break its silence._\r\n\r\n_The rescuing party consisted of six sturdy fellows\xe2\x80\x94fishermen from the\r\nneighbourhood\xe2\x80\x94directed by the resident Physician of the Hospital, who\r\ncame over for that purpose, heading a train of hospital-ambulances. The\r\nsix men had been selected\xe2\x80\x94from a much larger number who had volunteered\r\nfor this peaceful \xe2\x80\x98forlorn hope\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94for their strength and robust health,\r\nas the expedition was considered to be, even now, when the malady has\r\nexpended its chief force, not unattended with danger._\r\n\r\n_Every precaution that science could suggest, against the risk of\r\ninfection, was adopted: and the sufferers were tenderly carried on\r\nlitters, one by one, up the steep hill, and placed in the ambulances\r\nwhich, each provided with a hospital nurse, were waiting on the level\r\nroad. The fifteen miles, to the Hospital, were done at a walking-pace,\r\nas some of the patients were in too prostrate a condition to bear\r\njolting, and the journey occupied the whole afternoon._\r\n\r\n_The twenty-three patients consist of nine men, six women, and eight\r\nchildren. It has not been found possible to identify them all, as some\r\nof the children\xe2\x80\x94left with no surviving relatives\xe2\x80\x94are infants; and two\r\nmen and one woman are not yet able to make rational replies, the\r\nbrain-powers being entirely in abeyance. Among a more well-to-do-race,\r\nthere would no doubt have been names marked on the clothes; but here no\r\nsuch evidence is forthcoming._\r\n\r\n_Besides the poor fishermen and their families, there were but five\r\npersons to be accounted for: and it was ascertained, beyond a doubt,\r\nthat all five are numbered with the dead. It is a melancholy pleasure to\r\nplace on record the names of these genuine martyrs\xe2\x80\x94than whom none,\r\nsurely, are more worthy to be entered on the glory-roll of England\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheroes! They are as follows:\xe2\x80\x94_\r\n\r\n_The Rev. James Burgess, M.A., and Emma his wife. He was the Curate at\r\nthe Harbour, not thirty years old, and had been married only two years.\r\nA written record was found in their house, of the dates of their\r\ndeaths._\r\n\r\n_Next to theirs we will place the honoured name of Dr. Arthur Forester,\r\nwho, on the death of the local physician, nobly faced the imminent peril\r\nof death, rather than leave these poor folk uncared for in their last\r\nextremity. No record of his name, or of the date of his death, was\r\nfound: but the corpse was easily identified, although dressed in the\r\nordinary fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s suit (which he was known to have adopted when he\r\nwent down there), by a copy of the New Testament, the gift of his wife,\r\nwhich was found, placed next his heart, with his hands crossed over it.\r\nIt was not thought prudent to remove the body, for burial elsewhere: and\r\naccordingly it was at once committed to the ground, along with four\r\nothers found in different houses, with all due reverence. His wife,\r\nwhose maiden name was Lady Muriel Orme, had been married to him on the\r\nvery morning on which he undertook his self-sacrificing mission._\r\n\r\n_Next we record the Rev. Walter Saunders, Wesleyan Minister. His death\r\nis believed to have taken place two or three weeks ago, as the words\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Died October 5\xe2\x80\x99 were found written on the wall of the room which he is\r\nknown to have occupied\xe2\x80\x94the house being shut up, and apparently not\r\nhaving been entered for some time._\r\n\r\n_Last\xe2\x80\x94though not a whit behind the other four in glorious self-denial\r\nand devotion to duty\xe2\x80\x94let us record the name of Father Francis, a young\r\nJesuit Priest who had been only a few months in the place. He had not\r\nbeen dead many hours when the exploring party came upon the body, which\r\nwas identified, beyond the possibility of doubt, by the dress, and by\r\nthe crucifix which was, like the young Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Testament, clasped\r\nclosely to his heart._\r\n\r\n_Since reaching the hospital, two of the men and one of the children\r\nhave died. Hope is entertained for all the others: though there are two\r\nor three cases where the vital powers seem to be so entirely exhausted\r\nthat it is but \xe2\x80\x98hoping against hope\xe2\x80\x99 to regard ultimate recovery as even\r\npossible._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n                             A FAIRY-DUET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year\xe2\x80\x94what an eventful year it had been for me!\xe2\x80\x94was drawing to a\r\nclose, and the brief wintry day hardly gave light enough to recognise\r\nthe old familiar objects, bound up with so many happy memories, as the\r\ntrain glided round the last bend into the station, and the hoarse cry of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElveston! Elveston!\xe2\x80\x9d resounded along the platform.\r\n\r\nIt was sad to return to the place, and to feel that I should never again\r\nsee the glad smile of welcome, that had awaited me here so few months\r\nago. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, if I were to find him here,\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered, as in solitary\r\nstate I followed the porter, who was wheeling my luggage on a barrow,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand if he _were_ to \xe2\x80\x98_strike a sudden hand in mine, And ask a thousand\r\nthings of home_,\xe2\x80\x99 I should not\xe2\x80\x94no, \xe2\x80\x98_I should not feel it to be\r\nstrange_\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving given directions to have my luggage taken to my old lodgings, I\r\nstrolled off alone, to pay a visit, before settling down in my own\r\nquarters, to my dear old friends\xe2\x80\x94for such I indeed felt them to be,\r\nthough it was barely half a year since first we met\xe2\x80\x94the Earl and his\r\nwidowed daughter.\r\n\r\nThe shortest way, as I well remembered, was to cross through the\r\nchurchyard. I pushed open the little wicket-gate and slowly took my way\r\namong the solemn memorials of the quiet dead, thinking of the many who\r\nhad, during the past year, disappeared from the place, and had gone to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98join the majority.\xe2\x80\x99 A very few steps brought me in sight of the object\r\nof my search. Lady Muriel, dressed in the deepest mourning, her face\r\nhidden by a long crape veil, was kneeling before a little marble cross,\r\nround which she was fastening a wreath of flowers.\r\n\r\nThe cross stood on a piece of level turf, unbroken by any mound, and I\r\nknew that it was simply a memorial-cross, for one whose dust reposed\r\nelsewhere, even before reading the simple inscription:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                         _In loving Memory of_\r\n                         ARTHUR FORESTER, M.D.\r\n              _whose mortal remains lie buried by the sea:\r\n             whose spirit has returned to God who gave it_.\r\n\r\n               _\xe2\x80\x9cGreater love hath no man than this, that\r\n               a man lay down his life for his friends.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nShe threw back her veil on seeing me approach, and came forwards to meet\r\nme, with a quiet smile, and far more self-possessed than I could have\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite like old times, seeing _you_ here again!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in\r\ntones of genuine pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been to see my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI was on my way there, and came through here as the\r\nshortest way. I hope he is well, and you also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, we are both quite well. And you? Are you any better yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much better, I fear: but no worse, I am thankful to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us sit here awhile, and have a quiet chat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. The\r\ncalmness\xe2\x80\x94almost indifference\xe2\x80\x94of her manner quite took me by surprise. I\r\nlittle guessed what a fierce restraint she was putting upon herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can be so quiet here,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI come here every\xe2\x80\x94every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very peaceful,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got my letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I delayed writing. It is so hard to say\xe2\x80\x94on _paper_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. It was kind of you. You were with us when we saw the last of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe paused a moment, and went on more hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI went down to the\r\nharbour several times, but no one knows which of those vast graves it\r\nis. However, they showed me the house he died in: that was some comfort.\r\nI stood in the very room where\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d She struggled in vain to go on.\r\nThe flood-gates had given way at last, and the outburst of grief was the\r\nmost terrible I had ever witnessed. Totally regardless of my presence,\r\nshe flung herself down on the turf, burying her face in the grass, and\r\nwith her hands clasped round the little marble cross, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling,\r\nmy darling!\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd God meant your life to be so beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE CHURCH-YARD]\r\n\r\nI was startled to hear, thus repeated by Lady Muriel, the very words of\r\nthe darling child whom I had seen weeping so bitterly over the dead\r\nhare. Had some mysterious influence passed, from that sweet\r\nfairy-spirit, ere she went back to Fairyland, into the human spirit that\r\nloved her so dearly? The idea seemed too wild for belief. And yet, are\r\nthere not \xe2\x80\x98_more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our\r\nphilosophy_\xe2\x80\x99?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod _meant_ it to be beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cand surely it _was_\r\nbeautiful? God\xe2\x80\x99s purpose never fails!\xe2\x80\x9d I dared say no more, but rose and\r\nleft her. At the entrance-gate to the Earl\xe2\x80\x99s house I waited, leaning on\r\nthe gate and watching the sun set, revolving many memories\xe2\x80\x94some happy,\r\nsome sorrowful\xe2\x80\x94until Lady Muriel joined me.\r\n\r\nShe was quite calm again now. \xe2\x80\x9cDo come in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father will be\r\nso pleased to see you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man rose from his chair, with a smile, to welcome me; but his\r\nself-command was far less than his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s, and the tears coursed\r\ndown his face as he grasped both my hands in his, and pressed them\r\nwarmly.\r\n\r\nMy heart was too full to speak; and we all sat silent for a minute or\r\ntwo. Then Lady Muriel rang the bell for tea. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _do_ take five o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\ntea, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to me, with the sweet playfulness of manner I\r\nremembered so well, \xe2\x80\x9ceven though you _ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ work your wicked will on\r\nthe Law of Gravity, and make the teacups descend into Infinite Space, a\r\nlittle faster than the tea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis remark gave the tone to our conversation. By a tacit mutual\r\nconsent, we avoided, during this our first meeting after her great\r\nsorrow, the painful topics that filled our thoughts, and talked like\r\nlight-hearted children who had never known a care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever ask yourself the question,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel began, _\xc3\xa0 propos_\r\nof nothing, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the _chief_ advantage of being a Man instead of a\r\nDog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think there are advantages on the _Dog\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\nside of the question, as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with that pretty mock-gravity that became her\r\nso well: \xe2\x80\x9cbut, on _Man\xe2\x80\x99s_ side, the chief advantage seems to me to\r\nconsist in _having pockets_! It was borne in upon me\xe2\x80\x94upon _us_, I should\r\nsay; for my father and I were returning from a walk\xe2\x80\x94only yesterday. We\r\nmet a dog carrying home a bone. What it wanted it for, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea:\r\ncertainly there was no _meat_ on it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA strange sensation came over me, that I had heard all this, or\r\nsomething exactly like it, before: and I almost expected her next words\r\nto be \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps he meant to make a cloak for the winter?\xe2\x80\x9d However what\r\nshe really said was \xe2\x80\x9cand my father tried to account for it by some\r\nwretched joke about _pro bono publico_. Well, the dog laid down the\r\nbone\xe2\x80\x94_not_ in disgust with the pun, which would have shown it to be a\r\ndog of taste\xe2\x80\x94but simply to rest its jaws, poor thing! I _did_ pity it\r\nso! Won\xe2\x80\x99t you join my _Charitable Association for supplying dogs with\r\npockets_? How would _you_ like to have to carry your walking-stick in\r\nyour mouth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIgnoring the difficult question as to the _raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre_ of a\r\nwalking-stick, supposing one had no _hands_, I mentioned a curious\r\ninstance, I had once witnessed, of reasoning by a dog. A gentleman, with\r\na lady, and child, and a large dog, were down at the end of a pier on\r\nwhich I was walking. To amuse his child, I suppose, the gentleman put\r\ndown on the ground his umbrella and the lady\xe2\x80\x99s parasol, and then led the\r\nway to the other end of the pier, from which he sent the dog back for\r\nthe deserted articles. I was watching with some curiosity. The dog came\r\nracing back to where I stood, but found an unexpected difficulty in\r\npicking up the things it had come for. With the umbrella in its mouth,\r\nits jaws were so far apart that it could get no firm grip on the\r\nparasol. After two or three failures, it paused and considered the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThen it put down the umbrella and began with the parasol. Of course that\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t open its jaws nearly so wide, and it was able to get a good hold\r\nof the umbrella, and galloped off in triumph. One couldn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that it\r\nhad gone through a real train of logical thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entirely agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel: \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t orthodox\r\nwriters condemn that view, as putting Man on the level of the lower\r\nanimals? Don\xe2\x80\x99t they draw a sharp boundary-line between Reason and\r\nInstinct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat certainly _was_ the orthodox view, a generation ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nEarl. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth of Religion seemed ready to stand or fall with the\r\nassertion that Man was the only reasoning animal. But that is at an end\r\nnow. Man can still claim _certain_ monopolies\xe2\x80\x94for instance, such a use\r\nof _language_ as enables us to utilise the work of many, by \xe2\x80\x98division of\r\nlabour.\xe2\x80\x99 But the belief, that we have a monopoly of _Reason_, has long\r\nbeen swept away. Yet no catastrophe has followed. As some old poet says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_God is where he was_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost religious believers would _now_ agree with Bishop Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand not reject a line of argument, even if it led straight to the\r\nconclusion that animals have some kind of _soul_, which survives their\r\nbodily death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _would_ like to know _that_ to be true!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nonly for the sake of the poor horses. Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought that, if\r\nanything _could_ make me cease to believe in a God of perfect justice,\r\nit would be the sufferings of horses\xe2\x80\x94without guilt to deserve it, and\r\nwithout any compensation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only part of the great Riddle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy innocent\r\nbeings _ever_ suffer. It _is_ a great strain on Faith\xe2\x80\x94but not a\r\n_breaking_ strain, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sufferings of _horses_,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9care chiefly caused by _Man\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\ncruelty. So _that_ is merely one of the many instances of Sin causing\r\nsuffering to others than the Sinner himself. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you find a\r\n_greater_ difficulty in sufferings inflicted by animals upon each other?\r\nFor instance, a cat playing with a mouse. Assuming it to have no _moral_\r\nresponsibility, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a greater mystery than a man over-driving a\r\nhorse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it _is_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel, looking a mute appeal to her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat right have we to make that assumption?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl. \xe2\x80\x9c_Many_ of\r\nour religious difficulties are merely deductions from unwarranted\r\nassumptions. The wisest answer to most of them, is, I think, \xe2\x80\x98_behold,\r\nwe know not anything_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mentioned \xe2\x80\x98division of labour,\xe2\x80\x99 just now,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely it is\r\ncarried to a wonderful perfection in a hive of bees?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo wonderful\xe2\x80\x94so entirely super-human\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl, \xe2\x80\x9cand so entirely\r\ninconsistent with the intelligence they show in other ways\xe2\x80\x94that I feel\r\nno doubt at all that it is _pure_ Instinct, and _not_, as some hold, a\r\nvery high order of Reason. Look at the utter stupidity of a bee, trying\r\nto find its way out of an open window! It _doesn\xe2\x80\x99t_ try, in any\r\nreasonable sense of the word: it simply bangs itself about! We should\r\ncall a puppy _imbecile_, that behaved so. And yet we are asked to\r\nbelieve that its intellectual level is above Sir Isaac Newton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you hold that _pure_ Instinct contains no _Reason_ at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl, \xe2\x80\x9cI hold that the work of a bee-hive\r\ninvolves Reason of the _highest_ order. But none of it is done by the\r\n_Bee_. _God_ has reasoned it all out, and has put into the mind of the\r\nBee the _conclusions_, only, of the reasoning process.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do their minds come to work _together_?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat right have we to assume that they _have_ minds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpecial pleading, special pleading!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel cried, in a most\r\nunfilial tone of triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you yourself said, just now, \xe2\x80\x98the mind\r\nof the Bee\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did _not_ say \xe2\x80\x98_minds_,\xe2\x80\x99 my child,\xe2\x80\x9d the Earl gently replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nhas occurred to me, as the most probable solution of the \xe2\x80\x98Bee\xe2\x80\x99-mystery,\r\nthat a swarm of Bees _have only one mind among them_. We often see one\r\nmind animating a most complex collection of limbs and organs, _when\r\njoined together_. How do we know that any material connection is\r\nnecessary? May not mere neighbourhood be enough? If so, a swarm of bees\r\nis simply a single animal whose many limbs are not quite close\r\ntogether!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a bewildering thought,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand needs a night\xe2\x80\x99s rest to\r\ngrasp it properly. Reason and Instinct _both_ tell me I ought to go\r\nhome. So, good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x98set\xe2\x80\x99 you part of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had no walk\r\nto-day. It will do me good, and I have more to say to you. Shall we go\r\nthrough the wood? It will be pleasanter than over the common, even\r\nthough it _is_ getting a little dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe turned aside into the shade of interlacing boughs, which formed an\r\narchitecture of almost perfect symmetry, grouped into lovely groined\r\narches, or running out, far as the eye could follow, into endless\r\naisles, and chancels, and naves, like some ghostly cathedral, fashioned\r\nout of the dream of a moon-struck poet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways, in this wood,\xe2\x80\x9d she began after a pause (silence seemed natural\r\nin this dim solitude), \xe2\x80\x9cI begin thinking of Fairies! May I ask you a\r\nquestion?\xe2\x80\x9d she added hesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe in Fairies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe momentary impulse was so strong to tell her of my experiences in\r\nthis very wood, that I had to make a real effort to keep back the words\r\nthat rushed to my lips. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean, by \xe2\x80\x98believe,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98believe in their\r\n_possible_ existence,\xe2\x80\x99 I say \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 For their _actual_ existence, of\r\ncourse, one would need _evidence_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were saying, the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would accept\r\n_anything_, on good evidence, that was not _\xc3\xa0 priori_ impossible. And I\r\nthink you named _Ghosts_ as an instance of a _provable_ phenomenon.\r\nWould _Fairies_ be another instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so.\xe2\x80\x9d And again it was hard to check the wish to say more:\r\nbut I was not yet sure of a sympathetic listener.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you any theory as to what sort of place they would occupy in\r\nCreation? Do tell me what you think about them! Would they, for instance\r\n(supposing such beings to exist), would they have any moral\r\nresponsibility? I mean\xe2\x80\x9d (and the light bantering tone suddenly changed\r\nto one of deep seriousness) \xe2\x80\x9cwould they be capable of _sin_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can reason\xe2\x80\x94on a lower level, perhaps, than men and women\xe2\x80\x94never\r\nrising, I think, above the faculties of a child; and they have a moral\r\nsense, most surely. Such a being, without _free will_, would be an\r\nabsurdity. So I am driven to the conclusion that they _are_ capable of\r\nsin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe in them?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried delightedly, with a sudden motion as if\r\nabout to clap her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cNow tell me, have you any reason for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd still I strove to keep back the revelation I felt sure was coming.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that there is _life_ everywhere\xe2\x80\x94not _material_ only, not\r\nmerely what is palpable to our senses\xe2\x80\x94but immaterial and invisible as\r\nwell. We believe in our own immaterial essence\xe2\x80\x94call it \xe2\x80\x98soul,\xe2\x80\x99 or\r\n\xe2\x80\x98spirit,\xe2\x80\x99 or what you will. Why should not other similar essences exist\r\naround us, _not_ linked on to a visible and _material_ body? Did not God\r\nmake this swarm of happy insects, to dance in this sunbeam for one hour\r\nof bliss, for no other object, that we can imagine, than to swell the\r\nsum of conscious happiness? And where shall we dare to draw the line,\r\nand say \xe2\x80\x98He has made all these and no more\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d she assented, watching me with sparkling eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut these\r\nare only reasons for not _denying_. You have more reasons than this,\r\nhave you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, feeling I might safely tell all now. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I could\r\nnot find a fitter time or place to say it. I have _seen_ them\xe2\x80\x94and in\r\nthis very wood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel asked no more questions. Silently she paced at my side, with\r\nhead bowed down and hands clasped tightly together. Only, as my tale\r\nwent on, she drew a little short quick breath now and then, like a child\r\npanting with delight. And I told her what I had never yet breathed to\r\nany other listener, of my double life, and, more than that (for _mine_\r\nmight have been but a noonday-dream), of the double life of those two\r\ndear children.\r\n\r\nAnd when I told her of Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s wild gambols, she laughed merrily; and\r\nwhen I spoke of Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s sweetness and her utter unselfishness and\r\ntrustful love, she drew a deep breath, like one who hears at last some\r\nprecious tidings for which the heart has ached for a long while; and the\r\nhappy tears chased one another down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often longed to meet an angel,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, so low that I\r\ncould hardly catch the words. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m _so_ glad I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Sylvie! My heart\r\nwent out to the child the first moment that I saw her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Listen!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nbroke off suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Sylvie singing! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow her voice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard _Bruno_ sing, more than once,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cbut I never heard\r\nSylvie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only heard her _once_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was that day when\r\nyou brought us those mysterious flowers. The children had run out into\r\nthe garden; and I saw Eric coming in that way, and went to the window to\r\nmeet him: and Sylvie was singing, under the trees, a song I had never\r\nheard before. The words were something like \xe2\x80\x98I think it is Love, I feel\r\nit is Love.\xe2\x80\x99 Her voice sounded far away, like a dream, but it was\r\nbeautiful beyond all words\xe2\x80\x94as sweet as an infant\xe2\x80\x99s first smile, or the\r\nfirst gleam of the white cliffs when one is coming _home_ after weary\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94a voice that seemed to fill one\xe2\x80\x99s whole being with peace and\r\nheavenly thoughts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Listen!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, breaking off again in her\r\nexcitement. \xe2\x80\x9cThat _is_ her voice, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the very song!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could distinguish no words, but there was a dreamy sense of music in\r\nthe air that seemed to grow ever louder and louder, as if coming nearer\r\nto us. We stood quite silent, and in another minute the two children\r\nappeared, coming straight towards us through an arched opening among the\r\ntrees. Each had an arm round the other, and the setting sun shed a\r\ngolden halo round their heads, like what one sees in pictures of saints.\r\nThey were looking in our direction, but evidently did not see us, and I\r\nsoon made out that Lady Muriel had for once passed into a condition\r\nfamiliar to _me_, that we were both of us \xe2\x80\x98eerie,\xe2\x80\x99 and that, though we\r\ncould see the children so plainly, we were quite invisible to _them_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FAIRY-DUET]\r\n\r\nThe song ceased just as they came into sight: but, to my delight, Bruno\r\ninstantly said \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s sing it all again, Sylvie! It _did_ sound so\r\npretty!\xe2\x80\x9d And Sylvie replied \xe2\x80\x9cVery well. It\xe2\x80\x99s _you_ to begin, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Bruno began, in the sweet childish treble I knew so well:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cSay, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping,\r\n    That lures the bird home to her nest?\r\n  Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping,\r\n    To cuddle and croon it to rest?\r\n  What\xe2\x80\x99s the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms,\r\n    Till it cooes with the voice of the dove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now ensued quite the strangest of all the strange experiences that\r\nmarked the wonderful year whose history I am writing\xe2\x80\x94the experience of\r\n_first_ hearing Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s voice in song. Her part was a very short\r\none\xe2\x80\x94only a few words\xe2\x80\x94and she sang it timidly, and very low indeed,\r\nscarcely audibly, but the _sweetness_ of her voice was simply\r\nindescribable; I have never heard any earthly music like it.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a secret, and so let us whisper it low\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    And the name of the secret is Love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn me the first effect of her voice was a sudden sharp pang that seemed\r\nto pierce through one\xe2\x80\x99s very heart. (I had felt such a pang only once\r\nbefore in my life, and it had been from _seeing_ what, at the moment,\r\nrealised one\xe2\x80\x99s idea of perfect beauty\xe2\x80\x94it was in a London exhibition,\r\nwhere, in making my way through a crowd, I suddenly met, face to face, a\r\nchild of quite unearthly beauty.) Then came a rush of burning tears to\r\nthe eyes, as though one could weep one\xe2\x80\x99s soul away for pure delight. And\r\nlastly there fell on me a sense of awe that was almost terror\xe2\x80\x94some such\r\nfeeling as Moses must have had when he heard the words \xe2\x80\x9c_Put off thy\r\nshoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy\r\nground_.\xe2\x80\x9d The figures of the children became vague and shadowy, like\r\nglimmering meteors: while their voices rang together in exquisite\r\nharmony as they sang:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFor I think it is Love,\r\n      For I feel it is Love,\r\n  For I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it is nothing but Love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time I could see them clearly once more. Bruno again sang by\r\nhimself:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cSay, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning,\r\n    Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease?\r\n  That stirs the vexed soul with an aching\xe2\x80\x94a yearning\r\n    For the brotherly hand-grip of peace?\r\n  Whence the music that fills all our being\xe2\x80\x94that thrills\r\n    Around us, beneath, and above?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie sang more courageously, this time: the words seemed to carry her\r\naway, out of herself:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes:\r\n    But the name of the secret is Love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd clear and strong the chorus rang out:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFor I think it is Love,\r\n      For I feel it is Love,\r\n  For I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it is nothing but Love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more we heard Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s delicate little voice alone:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cSay whose is the skill that paints valley and hill,\r\n    Like a picture so fair to the sight?\r\n  That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow,\r\n    Till the little lambs leap with delight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again uprose that silvery voice, whose angelic sweetness I could\r\nhardly bear:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold,\r\n    Though \xe2\x80\x99tis sung, by the angels above,\r\n  In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    And the name of the secret is Love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Bruno joined in again with\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFor I think it is Love,\r\n      For I feel it is Love,\r\n  For I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it is nothing but Love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat _are_ pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d the little fellow exclaimed, as the children passed\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94so closely that we drew back a little to make room for them, and it\r\nseemed we had only to reach out a hand to touch them: but this we did\r\nnot attempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use to try and stop them!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as they passed away into the\r\nshadows. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they could not even _see_ us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel echoed with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cOne would _like_ to\r\nmeet them again, in living form! But I feel, somehow, _that_ can never\r\nbe. They have passed out of _our_ lives!\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed again; and no more\r\nwas said, till we came out into the main road, at a point near my\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will leave you here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to get back before\r\ndark: and I have a cottage-friend to visit, first. Good night, dear\r\nfriend! Let us see you soon\xe2\x80\x94and often!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with an affectionate\r\nwarmth that went to my very heart. \xe2\x80\x9c_For those are few we hold as\r\ndear!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night!\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cTennyson said that of a worthier friend than\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTennyson didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he was talking about!\xe2\x80\x9d she saucily rejoined,\r\nwith a touch of her old childish gaiety; and we parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n                          GAMMON AND SPINACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy landlady\xe2\x80\x99s welcome had an extra heartiness about it: and though, with\r\na rare delicacy of feeling, she made no direct allusion to the friend\r\nwhose companionship had done so much to brighten life for me, I felt\r\nsure that it was a kindly sympathy with my solitary state that made her\r\nso specially anxious to do all she could think of to ensure my comfort,\r\nand make me feel at home.\r\n\r\nThe lonely evening seemed long and tedious: yet I lingered on, watching\r\nthe dying fire, and letting Fancy mould the red embers into the forms\r\nand faces belonging to bygone scenes. Now it seemed to be Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroguish smile that sparkled for a moment, and died away: now it was\r\nSylvie\xe2\x80\x99s rosy cheek: and now the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s jolly round face, beaming\r\nwith delight. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, my little ones!\xe2\x80\x9d he seemed to say. And\r\nthen the red coal, which for the moment embodied the dear old Professor,\r\nbegan to wax dim, and with its dying lustre the words seemed to die away\r\ninto silence. I seized the poker, and with an artful touch or two\r\nrevived the waning glow, while Fancy\xe2\x80\x94no coy minstrel she\xe2\x80\x94sang me once\r\nagain the magic strain I loved to hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, little ones!\xe2\x80\x9d the cheery voice repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI told them\r\nyou were coming. Your rooms are all ready for you. And the Emperor and\r\nthe Empress\xe2\x80\x94well, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re rather pleased than otherwise! In\r\nfact, Her Highness said \xe2\x80\x98I hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in time for the Banquet!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThose were her very words, I assure you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Uggug be at the Banquet?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno asked. And both children looked\r\nuneasy at the dismal suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course he will!\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s his\r\n_birthday_, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? And his health will be drunk, and all that\r\nsort of thing. What would the Banquet be without _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver so much nicer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. But he said it in a _very_ low voice,\r\nand nobody but Sylvie heard him.\r\n\r\nThe Professor chuckled again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be a jolly Banquet, now _you\xe2\x80\x99ve_\r\ncome, my little man! I _am_ so glad to see you again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99fraid we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very long in coming,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno politely remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor assented. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, you\xe2\x80\x99re very short now\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re come: that\xe2\x80\x99s _some_ comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went on to enumerate the\r\nplans for the day. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lecture comes first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c_That_ the\r\nEmpress _insists_ on. She says people will eat so much at the Banquet,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll be too sleepy to attend to the Lecture afterwards\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s right. There\xe2\x80\x99ll just be a little _refreshment_, when the people\r\nfirst arrive\xe2\x80\x94as a kind of surprise for the Empress, you know. Ever since\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s been\xe2\x80\x94well, not _quite_ so clever as she once was\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve found it\r\ndesirable to concoct little surprises for her. _Then_ comes the\r\nLecture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? The Lecture you were getting ready\xe2\x80\x94ever so long ago?\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the one,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor rather reluctantly admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\n_has_ taken a goodish time to prepare. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got so many other things to\r\nattend to. For instance, I\xe2\x80\x99m Court-Physician. I have to keep all the\r\nRoyal Servants in good health\xe2\x80\x94and that reminds me!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, ringing\r\nthe bell in a great hurry. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Medicine-Day! We only give Medicine\r\nonce a week. If we were to begin giving it every day, the bottles would\r\n_soon_ be empty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if they were ill on the _other_ days?\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, ill on the wrong _day_!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that would\r\nnever do! A Servant would be dismissed _at once_, who was ill on the\r\nwrong day! This is the Medicine for _today_,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, taking down a\r\nlarge jug from a shelf. \xe2\x80\x9cI mixed it, myself, first thing this morning.\r\nTaste it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding out the jug to Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cDip in your finger,\r\nand taste it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno did so, and made such an excruciatingly wry face that Sylvie\r\nexclaimed, in alarm, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bruno, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s welly extremely nasty!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said, as his face resumed its\r\nnatural shape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNasty?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of _course_ it is! What would\r\nMedicine be, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t _nasty_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor faltered, rather taken aback by the\r\npromptness of Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s reply, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94that _that_ would never do! Medicine\r\n_has_ to be nasty, you know. Be good enough to take this jug, down into\r\nthe Servants\xe2\x80\x99 Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the footman who answered the bell: \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ntell them it\xe2\x80\x99s their Medicine for _today_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of them is to drink it?\xe2\x80\x9d the footman asked, as he carried off the\r\njug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not settled _that_ yet!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor briskly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome and settle that, soon. Tell them not to begin, on any account, till\r\nI come! It\xe2\x80\x99s really _wonderful_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to the children, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nsuccess I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in curing Diseases! Here are some of my memoranda.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ntook down from the shelf a heap of little bits of paper, pinned together\r\nin twos and threes. \xe2\x80\x9cJust look at _this_ set, now. \xe2\x80\x98_Under-Cook Number\r\nThirteen recovered from Common Fever\xe2\x80\x94Febris Communis_.\xe2\x80\x99 And now see\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s pinned to it. \xe2\x80\x98_Gave Under-Cook Number Thirteen a Double Dose of\r\nMedicine_.\xe2\x80\x99 _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ something to be proud of, _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut which happened _first_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie, looking very much puzzled.\r\n\r\nThe Professor examined the papers carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are not _dated_, I\r\nfind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a slightly dejected air: \xe2\x80\x9cso I fear I ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou. But they _both_ happened: there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt of _that_. The\r\n_Medicine\xe2\x80\x99s_ the great thing, you know. The _Diseases_ are much less\r\nimportant. You can keep a _Medicine_, for years and years: but nobody\r\never wants to keep a _Disease_! By the way, come and look at the\r\nplatform. The Gardener asked me to come and see if it would do. We may\r\nas well go before it gets dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d like to, very much!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie replied. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Bruno, put on your\r\nhat. Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep the dear Professor waiting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t find my hat!\xe2\x80\x9d the little fellow sadly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI were rolling\r\nit about. And it\xe2\x80\x99s rolled itself away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s rolled in _there_,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie suggested, pointing to a dark\r\nrecess, the door of which stood half open: and Bruno ran in to look.\r\nAfter a minute he came slowly out again, looking very grave, and\r\ncarefully shut the cupboard-door after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt aren\xe2\x80\x99t in there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with such unusual solemnity, that\r\nSylvie\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity was roused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ in there, Bruno?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s cobwebs\xe2\x80\x94and two spiders\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno thoughtfully replied, checking\r\noff the catalogue on his fingers, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and the cover of a picture-book\xe2\x80\x94and\r\na tortoise\xe2\x80\x94and a dish of nuts\xe2\x80\x94and an old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Professor, trotting across the room in great\r\nexcitement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it must be the Other Professor, that\xe2\x80\x99s been lost for\r\never so long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OTHER PROFESSOR FOUND]\r\n\r\nHe opened the door of the cupboard wide: and there he was, the Other\r\nProfessor, sitting in a chair, with a book on his knee, and in the act\r\nof helping himself to a nut from a dish, which he had taken down off a\r\nshelf just within his reach. He looked round at us, but said nothing\r\ntill he had cracked and eaten the nut. Then he asked the old question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the Lecture all ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll begin in an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor said, evading the question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, we must have something to surprise the Empress. And then comes\r\nthe Banquet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Banquet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Other Professor, springing up, and filling the\r\nroom with a cloud of dust. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99d better go and\xe2\x80\x94and brush myself a\r\nlittle. What a state I\xe2\x80\x99m in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _does_ want brushing!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor said, with a critical air,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s your hat, little man! I had put it on by mistake. I\xe2\x80\x99d quite\r\nforgotten I had _one_ on, already. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go and look at the platform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s that nice old Gardener singing still!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno exclaimed in\r\ndelight, as we went out into the garden. \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe he\xe2\x80\x99s been singing\r\nthat very song ever since we went away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course he has!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the\r\nthing to leave off, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be _what_ thing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno: but the Professor thought it\r\nbest not to hear the question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing with that hedgehog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe shouted at the Gardener, whom they found standing upon one foot,\r\nsinging softly to himself, and rolling a hedgehog up and down with the\r\nother foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wanted fur to know what hedgehogs lives on: so I be a-keeping\r\nthis here hedgehog\xe2\x80\x94fur to see if it eats potatoes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better keep a potato,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor; \xe2\x80\x9cand see if hedgehogs\r\neat it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat be the roight way, sure-ly!\xe2\x80\x9d the delighted Gardener exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\nyou come to see the platform?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor cheerily replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the children have come\r\nback, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Gardener looked round at them with a grin. Then he led the way to\r\nthe Pavilion; and as he went he sang:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cHe looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Double Rule of Three:\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98And all its Mystery,\xe2\x80\x99 he said,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Is clear as day to me!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been _months_ over that song,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nfinished yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere be only one verse more,\xe2\x80\x9d the Gardener sadly replied. And, with\r\ntears streaming down his cheeks, he sang the last verse:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cHe thought he saw an Argument\r\n    That proved he was the Pope:\r\n  He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Bar of Mottled Soap.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98A fact so dread,\xe2\x80\x99 he faintly said,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Extinguishes all hope!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChoking with sobs, the Gardener hastily stepped on a few yards ahead of\r\nthe party, to conceal his emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid _he_ see the Bar of Mottled Soap?\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie enquired, as we followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cThat song is his own history, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears of an ever-ready sympathy glittered in Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99s _welly_\r\nsorry he isn\xe2\x80\x99t the Pope!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ sorry, Sylvie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I hardly know,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie replied in the vaguest manner. \xe2\x80\x9cWould it\r\nmake him any happier?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked the Professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make the _Pope_ any happier,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe platform _lovely_?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as we entered the Pavilion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve put an extra beam under it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Gardener, patting it\r\naffectionately as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now it\xe2\x80\x99s that strong, as\xe2\x80\x94as a mad\r\nelephant might dance upon it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you _very_ much!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor heartily rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthat we shall exactly require\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s convenient to know.\xe2\x80\x9d And he led\r\nthe children upon the platform, to explain the arrangements to them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are three seats, you see, for the Emperor and the Empress and\r\nPrince Uggug. But there must be two more chairs here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking\r\ndown at the Gardener. \xe2\x80\x9cOne for Lady Sylvie, and one for the smaller\r\nanimal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd may I help in the Lecture?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cI can do some\r\nconjuring-tricks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a _conjuring_ lecture,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor said, as\r\nhe arranged some curious-looking machines on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, what\r\ncan you do? Did you ever go through a table, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9c_Haven\xe2\x80\x99t_ I, Sylvie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor was evidently surprised, though he tried not to show it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis must be looked into,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself, taking out a\r\nnote-book. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd first\xe2\x80\x94what kind of table?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno whispered to Sylvie, putting his arms round her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a _bony_ word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can say it well enough, if you only\r\ntry. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuddle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the bewildered Professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe means the multiplication-table,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie explained.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked annoyed, and shut up his note-book again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s _quite_ another thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt are ever so many other things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9c_Aren\xe2\x80\x99t_ it, Sylvie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA loud blast of trumpets interrupted this conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the\r\nentertainment has _begun_!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor exclaimed, as he hurried the\r\nchildren into the Reception-Saloon. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea it was so late!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA small table, containing cake and wine, stood in a corner of the\r\nSaloon; and here we found the Emperor and Empress waiting for us. The\r\nrest of the Saloon had been cleared of furniture, to make room for the\r\nguests. I was much struck by the great change a few months had made in\r\nthe faces of the Imperial Pair. A vacant stare was now the _Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\nusual expression; while over the face of the _Empress_ there flitted,\r\never and anon, a meaningless smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re come at last!\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperor sulkily remarked, as the Professor\r\nand the children took their places. It was evident that he was _very_\r\nmuch out of temper: and we were not long in learning the cause of this.\r\nHe did not consider the preparations, made for the Imperial party, to be\r\nsuch as suited their rank. \xe2\x80\x9cA common mahogany table!\xe2\x80\x9d he growled,\r\npointing to it contemptuously with his thumb. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it made of\r\ngold, I should like to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have taken a very long\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor began, but the Emperor\r\ncut the sentence short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the cake! Ordinary plum! Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it made of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cThen the wine! Merely old Madeira! Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94? Then this\r\nchair! That\xe2\x80\x99s worst of all. Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it a throne? One _might_ excuse\r\nthe other omissions, but I _ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ get over the chair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _I_ ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t get over,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Empress, in eager sympathy with her\r\nangry husband, \xe2\x80\x9cis the _table_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is much to be regretted!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor mildly replied, as soon as\r\nhe had a chance of speaking. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought he strengthened\r\nthe remark. \xe2\x80\x9c_Everything_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Society in general, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\n_very much_ to be regretted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA murmur of \xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d rose from the crowded Saloon.\r\n\r\nThere was a rather awkward pause: the Professor evidently didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow to begin. The Empress leant forwards, and whispered to him. \xe2\x80\x9cA few\r\njokes, you know, Professor\xe2\x80\x94just to put people at their ease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true, Madam!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor meekly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThis little boy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Please_ don\xe2\x80\x99t make any jokes about _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno exclaimed, his eyes\r\nfilling with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t if you\xe2\x80\x99d rather I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the kind-hearted Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas only something about a Ship\xe2\x80\x99s Buoy: a harmless pun\xe2\x80\x94but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d Here he turned to the crowd and addressed them in a loud voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLearn your A\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cYour B\xe2\x80\x99s! Your C\xe2\x80\x99s! And your D\xe2\x80\x99s! _Then_\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be at your ease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter from all the assembly, and then a great\r\ndeal of confused whispering. \xe2\x80\x9c_What_ was it he said? Something about\r\nbees, I fancy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Empress smiled in her meaningless way, and fanned herself. The poor\r\nProfessor looked at her timidly: he was clearly at his wits\xe2\x80\x99 end again,\r\nand hoping for another hint. The Empress whispered again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome spinach, you know, Professor, as a surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor beckoned to the Head-Cook, and said something to him in a\r\nlow voice. Then the Head-Cook left the room, followed by all the other\r\ncooks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to get things started,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor remarked to Bruno.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen once we get started, it\xe2\x80\x99ll go on all right, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf oo want to startle people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, \xe2\x80\x9coo should put live frogs on\r\ntheir backs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the cooks all came in again, in a procession, the Head-Cook coming\r\nlast and carrying something, which the others tried to hide by waving\r\nflags all round it. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but flags, Your Imperial Highness! Nothing\r\nbut flags!\xe2\x80\x9d he kept repeating, as he set it before her. Then all the\r\nflags were dropped in a moment, as the Head-Cook raised the cover from\r\nan enormous dish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS IS SURPRISED!\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d the Empress said faintly, as she put her spy-glass to her\r\neye. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s _Spinach_, I declare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer Imperial Highness is surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor explained to the\r\nattendants: and some of them clapped their hands. The Head-Cook made a\r\nlow bow, and in doing so dropped a spoon on the table, as if by\r\naccident, just within reach of the Empress, who looked the other way and\r\npretended not to see it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ surprised!\xe2\x80\x9d the Empress said to Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but Sylvie put her hand over his\r\nmouth, and spoke for him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s rather tired, I think. He wants the\r\nLecture to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want the _supper_ to begin,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno corrected her.\r\n\r\nThe Empress took up the spoon in an absent manner, and tried to balance\r\nit across the back of her hand, and in doing this she dropped it into\r\nthe dish: and, when she took it out again, it was full of spinach. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ncurious!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and put it into her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cIt tastes just like\r\n_real_ spinach! I thought it was an imitation\xe2\x80\x94but I do believe it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreal!\xe2\x80\x9d And she took another spoonful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be real much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\nBut the Empress had had enough spinach by this time, and somehow\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nfailed to notice the exact process\xe2\x80\x94we all found ourselves in the\r\nPavilion, and the Professor in the act of beginning the long-expected\r\nLecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n                        THE PROFESSOR\xe2\x80\x99S LECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Science\xe2\x80\x94in fact, in most things\xe2\x80\x94it is usually best _to begin at the\r\nbeginning_. In _some_ things, of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to begin at the\r\n_other_ end. For instance, if you wanted to paint a dog green, it\r\n_might_ be best to begin with the _tail_, as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bite at _that_\r\nend. And so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay _I_ help oo?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me to do _what_?\xe2\x80\x9d said the puzzled Professor, looking up for a\r\nmoment, but keeping his finger on the book he was reading from, so as\r\nnot to lose his place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo paint a dog green!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9c_Oo_ can begin wiz its _mouf_, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t got to the _Experiments_ yet.\r\nAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d returning to his note-book, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the Axioms of\r\nScience. After that I shall exhibit some Specimens. Then I shall explain\r\na Process or two. And I shall conclude with a few Experiments. An\r\n_Axiom_, you know, is a thing that you accept without contradiction. For\r\ninstance, if I were to say \xe2\x80\x98Here we are!\xe2\x80\x99, that would be accepted\r\nwithout any contradiction, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice sort of remark to _begin_ a\r\nconversation with. So it would be an _Axiom_. Or again, supposing I were\r\nto say \xe2\x80\x98Here we are not!\xe2\x80\x99 _that_ would be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94a fib!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _Bruno_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie in a warning whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it would be\r\nan _Axiom_, if the Professor said it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94that would be accepted, if people were civil,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nProfessor; \xe2\x80\x9cso it would be _another_ Axiom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _might_ be an Axledum,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said: \xe2\x80\x9cbut it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be _true_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIgnorance of Axioms,\xe2\x80\x9d the Lecturer continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis a great drawback in\r\nlife. It wastes so much time to have to say them over and over again.\r\nFor instance, take the Axiom \xe2\x80\x98_Nothing is greater than itself_\xe2\x80\x99; that\r\nis, \xe2\x80\x98_Nothing can contain itself_.\xe2\x80\x99 How often you hear people say \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nwas so excited, he was quite unable to contain himself,\xe2\x80\x99 Why, _of\r\ncourse_ he was unable! The _excitement_ had nothing to do with it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, look here, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor, who was getting a little\r\nrestless. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many Axioms are you going to give us? At _this_ rate, we\r\nsha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t get to the _Experiments_ till to-morrow-week!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sooner than _that_, I assure you!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor replied, looking\r\nup in alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are only,\xe2\x80\x9d (he referred to his notes again) \xe2\x80\x9conly\r\n_two_ more, that are really _necessary_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead \xe2\x80\x99em out, and get on to the _Specimens_,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _First_ Axiom,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor read out in a great hurry, \xe2\x80\x9cconsists\r\nof these words, \xe2\x80\x98_Whatever is, is_.\xe2\x80\x99 And the Second consists of _these_\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x98_Whatever isn\xe2\x80\x99t, isn\xe2\x80\x99t_.\xe2\x80\x99 We will now go on to the _Specimens_.\r\nThe first tray contains Crystals and other Things.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew it towards\r\nhim, and again referred to his note-book. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of the labels\xe2\x80\x94owing to\r\ninsufficient adhesion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here he stopped again, and carefully examined\r\nthe page with his eyeglass. \xe2\x80\x9cI ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t quite read the rest of the\r\nsentence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it _means_ that the labels have come\r\nloose, and the Things have got mixed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet _me_ stick \xe2\x80\x99em on again!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno eagerly, and began licking\r\nthem, like postage-stamps, and dabbing them down upon the Crystals and\r\nthe other Things. But the Professor hastily moved the tray out of his\r\nreach. \xe2\x80\x9cThey _might_ get fixed to the _wrong_ Specimens, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any _wrong_ peppermints in the tray!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno boldly\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9c_Should_ he, Sylvie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sylvie only shook her head.\r\n\r\nThe Professor heard him not. He had taken up one of the bottles, and was\r\ncarefully reading the label through his eye-glass. \xe2\x80\x9cOur first\r\nSpecimen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, as he placed the bottle in front of the other\r\nThings, \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x94that is, it is called\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d here he took it up, and examined\r\nthe label again, as if he thought it might have changed since he last\r\nsaw it, \xe2\x80\x9cis called Aqua Pura\xe2\x80\x94common water\xe2\x80\x94the fluid that cheers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHip! Hip! Hip!\xe2\x80\x9d the Head-Cook began enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94but _not_ inebriates!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor went on quickly, but only just in\r\ntime to check the \xe2\x80\x9cHooroar!\xe2\x80\x9d which was beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur second Specimen,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, carefully opening a small jar, \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhere he removed the lid, and a large beetle instantly darted out, and\r\nwith an angry buzz went straight out of the Pavilion, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94or rather, I\r\nshould say,\xe2\x80\x9d looking sadly into the empty jar, \xe2\x80\x9cit _was_\xe2\x80\x94a curious kind\r\nof Blue Beetle. Did any one happen to remark\xe2\x80\x94as it went past\xe2\x80\x94three blue\r\nspots under each wing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody had remarked them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor said with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity. Unless you\r\nremark that kind of thing _at the moment_, it\xe2\x80\x99s very apt to get\r\noverlooked! The _next_ Specimen, at any rate, will not fly away! It\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94in short, or perhaps, more correctly, at _length_\xe2\x80\x94an _Elephant_. You\r\nwill observe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d Here he beckoned to the Gardener to come up on the\r\nplatform, and with his help began putting together what looked like an\r\nenormous dog-kennel, with short tubes projecting out of it on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen _Elephants_ before,\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperor grumbled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but not through a _Megaloscope_!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor eagerly replied.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know you can\xe2\x80\x99t see a _Flea_, properly, without a\r\n_magnifying_-glass\xe2\x80\x94what we call a _Microscope_. Well, just in the same\r\nway, you ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t see an _Elephant_, properly, without a\r\n_minimifying_-glass. There\xe2\x80\x99s one in each of these little tubes. And\r\n_this_ is a _Megaloscope_! The Gardener will now bring in the next\r\nSpecimen. Please open _both_ curtains, down at the end there, and make\r\nway for the Elephant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general rush to the sides of the Pavilion, and all eyes were\r\nturned to the open end, watching for the return of the Gardener, who had\r\ngone away singing \xe2\x80\x9c_He thought he saw an Elephant That practised on a\r\nFife!_\xe2\x80\x9d There was silence for a minute: and then his harsh voice was\r\nheard again in the distance. \xe2\x80\x9c_He looked again_\xe2\x80\x94come up, then! _He\r\nlooked again, and found it was_\xe2\x80\x94woa back! _and, found it was A letter\r\nfrom his_\xe2\x80\x94make way there! He\xe2\x80\x99s a-coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ELEPHANT\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\nAnd in marched, or waddled\xe2\x80\x94it is hard to say which is the right word\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nElephant, on its hind-legs, and playing on an enormous fife which it\r\nheld with its fore-feet.\r\n\r\nThe Professor hastily threw open a large door at the end of the\r\nMegaloscope, and the huge animal, at a signal from the Gardener, dropped\r\nthe fife, and obediently trotted into the machine, the door of which was\r\nat once shut by the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Specimen is now ready for\r\nobservation!\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is exactly the size of the Common\r\nMouse\xe2\x80\x94_Mus Communis_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general rush to the tubes, and the spectators watched with\r\ndelight the minikin creature, as it playfully coiled its trunk round the\r\nProfessor\xe2\x80\x99s extended finger, finally taking its stand upon the palm of\r\nhis hand, while he carefully lifted it out, and carried it off to\r\nexhibit to the Imperial party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a _darling_?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I stroke it, please? I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntouch it _welly_ gently!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Empress inspected it solemnly with her eye-glass. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very\r\nsmall,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a deep voice. \xe2\x80\x9cSmaller than elephants usually are, I\r\nbelieve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor gave a start of delighted surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s _true_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe murmured to himself. Then louder, turning to the audience, \xe2\x80\x9cHer\r\nImperial Highness has made a remark which is perfectly sensible!\xe2\x80\x9d And a\r\nwild cheer arose from that vast multitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next Specimen,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor proclaimed, after carefully placing\r\nthe little Elephant in the tray, among the Crystals and other Things,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis a _Flea_, which we will enlarge for the purposes of observation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTaking a small pill-box from the tray, he advanced to the Megaloscope,\r\nand reversed all the tubes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Specimen is ready!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, with his\r\neye at one of the tubes, while he carefully emptied the pill-box through\r\na little hole at the side. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is now the size of the Common\r\nHorse\xe2\x80\x94_Equus Communis_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another general rush, to look through the tubes, and the\r\nPavilion rang with shouts of delight, through which the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanxious tones could scarcely be heard. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep the door of the Microscope\r\n_shut_!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the creature were to escape, _this size_, it\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But the mischief was done. The door had swung open, and in\r\nanother moment the Monster had got out, and was trampling down the\r\nterrified, shrieking spectators.\r\n\r\nBut the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s presence of mind did not desert him. \xe2\x80\x9cUndraw those\r\ncurtains!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. It was done. The Monster gathered its legs\r\ntogether, and in one tremendous bound vanished into the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere _is_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor, rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the next Province, I fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThat jump would\r\ntake it at _least_ five miles! The next thing is to explain a Process or\r\ntwo. But I find there is hardly room enough to operate\xe2\x80\x94the smaller\r\nanimal is rather in my way\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho does he mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno whispered to Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe means _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie whispered back. \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe kind enough to move\xe2\x80\x94angularly\xe2\x80\x94to _this_ corner,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor said,\r\naddressing himself to Bruno.\r\n\r\nBruno hastily moved his chair in the direction indicated. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I move\r\nangrily enough?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. But the Professor was once more absorbed\r\nin his Lecture, which he was reading from his note-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will now explain the Process of\xe2\x80\x94the name is blotted, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to\r\nsay. It will be illustrated by a number of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d here he examined the\r\npage for some time, and at last said \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to be either\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Experiments\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Specimens\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be _Experiments_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen plenty of\r\n_Specimens_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, certainly!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor assented. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will have some\r\nExperiments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay _I_ do them?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno eagerly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear no!\xe2\x80\x9d The Professor looked dismayed. \xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nwould happen if _you_ did them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor nobody doosn\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99ll happen if _oo_ doos them!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno\r\nretorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur First Experiment requires a Machine. It has two knobs\xe2\x80\x94only\r\n_two_\xe2\x80\x94you can count them, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Head-Cook stepped forwards, counted them, and retired satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you _might_ press those two knobs together\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the way\r\nto do it. Or you _might_ turn the Machine upside-down\xe2\x80\x94but _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ not\r\nthe way to do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _are_ the way to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, who was listening very\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\nThe Professor smiled benignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a voice like\r\nthe heading of a chapter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Way To Do It! Permit me!\xe2\x80\x9d and in a moment\r\nhe had whisked Bruno upon the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI divide my subject,\xe2\x80\x9d he began,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinto three parts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll get down!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno whispered to Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cIt aren\xe2\x80\x99t nice to\r\nbe divided!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a knife, silly boy!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie whispered in reply. \xe2\x80\x9cStand\r\nstill! You\xe2\x80\x99ll break all the bottles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first part is to take hold of the knobs,\xe2\x80\x9d putting them into Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cThe second part is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here he turned the handle, and, with a\r\nloud \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d, Bruno dropped both the knobs, and began rubbing his elbows.\r\n\r\nThe Professor chuckled in delight. \xe2\x80\x9cIt had a sensible effect. _Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a _sensible_ effect!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt were\r\nvery silly indeed. It jingled my elbows, and it banged my back, and it\r\ncrinkled my hair, and it buzzed among my bones!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re only inventing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo doosn\xe2\x80\x99t know nuffin about it!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno replied. \xe2\x80\x9cOo wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there to\r\nsee. Nobody ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t go among my bones. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Second Experiment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor announced, as Bruno returned to\r\nhis place, still thoughtfully rubbing his elbows, \xe2\x80\x9cis the production of\r\nthat seldom-seen-but-greatly-to-be-admired phenomenon, Black Light! You\r\nhave seen White Light, Red Light, Green Light, and so on: but never,\r\ntill this wonderful day, have any eyes but mine seen _Black Light_! This\r\nbox,\xe2\x80\x9d carefully lifting it upon the table, and covering it with a heap\r\nof blankets, \xe2\x80\x9cis quite full of it. The way I made it was this\xe2\x80\x94I took a\r\nlighted candle into a dark cupboard and shut the door. Of course the\r\ncupboard was then full of _Yellow_ Light. Then I took a bottle of Black\r\nink, and poured it over the candle: and, to my delight, every atom of\r\nthe Yellow Light turned _Black_! That was indeed the proudest moment of\r\nmy life! Then I filled a box with it. And now\xe2\x80\x94would any one like to get\r\nunder the blankets and see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDead silence followed this appeal: but at last Bruno said \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ get\r\nunder, if it won\xe2\x80\x99t jingle my elbows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSatisfied on this point, Bruno crawled under the blankets, and, after a\r\nminute or two, crawled out again, very hot and dusty, and with his hair\r\nin the wildest confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you see in the box?\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie eagerly enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw _nuffin_!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno sadly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt were too dark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has described the appearance of the thing exactly!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor\r\nexclaimed with enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Light, and Nothing, look so extremely\r\nalike, at first sight, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder he failed to distinguish\r\nthem! We will now proceed to the Third Experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor came down, and led the way to where a post had been driven\r\nfirmly into the ground. To one side of the post was fastened a chain,\r\nwith an iron weight hooked on to the end of it, and from the other side\r\nprojected a piece of whalebone, with a ring at the end of it. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a\r\n_most_ interesting Experiment!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor announced. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will need\r\n_time_, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid: but that is a trifling disadvantage. Now observe. If\r\nI were to unhook this weight, and let go, it would fall to the ground.\r\nYou do not deny _that_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody denied it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in the same way, if I were to bend this piece of whalebone round\r\nthe post\xe2\x80\x94thus\xe2\x80\x94and put the ring over this hook\xe2\x80\x94thus\xe2\x80\x94it stays bent: but,\r\nif I unhook it, it straightens itself again. You do not deny _that_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain, nobody denied it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, suppose we left things just as they are, for a long time.\r\nThe force of the _whalebone_ would get exhausted, you know, and it would\r\nstay bent, even when you unhooked it. Now, _why_ shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the same\r\nthing happen with the _weight_? The _whalebone_ gets so used to being\r\nbent, that it ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t _straighten_ itself any more. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\n_weight_ get so used to being held up, that it ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t _fall_ any more?\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ want to know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what _we_ want to know!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long must we wait?\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I _think_ a thousand years\r\nwill do to _begin_ with,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we will cautiously unhook the\r\nweight: and, if it _still_ shows (as perhaps it will) a _slight_\r\ntendency to fall, we will hook it on to the chain again, and leave it\r\nfor _another_ thousand years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Empress experienced one of those flashes of Common Sense which\r\nwere the surprise of all around her. \xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile there\xe2\x80\x99ll be time for\r\nanother Experiment,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will _indeed_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the delighted Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us return to\r\nthe platform, and proceed to the _Fourth_ Experiment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor this concluding Experiment, I will take a certain Alkali, or Acid\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nforget which. Now you\xe2\x80\x99ll see what will happen when I mix it with Some\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhere he took up a bottle, and looked at it doubtfully, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94when I mix it\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94with Something\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Emperor interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the _name_ of the stuff?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the _name_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor: \xe2\x80\x9cand the label has\r\ncome off.\xe2\x80\x9d He emptied it quickly into the other bottle, and, with a\r\ntremendous bang, both bottles flew to pieces, upsetting all the\r\nmachines, and filling the Pavilion with thick black smoke. I sprang to\r\nmy feet in terror, and\xe2\x80\x94and found myself standing before my solitary\r\nhearth, where the poker, dropping at last from the hand of the sleeper,\r\nhad knocked over the tongs and the shovel, and had upset the kettle,\r\nfilling the air with clouds of steam. With a weary sigh, I betook myself\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EXPLOSION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n                              THE BANQUET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Heaviness may endure for a night: but joy cometh in the morning._\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nnext day found me quite another being. Even the memories of my lost\r\nfriend and companion were sunny as the genial weather that smiled around\r\nme. I did not venture to trouble Lady Muriel, or her father, with\r\nanother call so soon: but took a walk into the country, and only turned\r\nhomewards when the low sunbeams warned me that day would soon be over.\r\n\r\nOn my way home, I passed the cottage where the old man lived, whose face\r\nalways recalled to me the day when I first met Lady Muriel; and I\r\nglanced in as I passed, half-curious to see if he were still living\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nYes: the old man was still alive. He was sitting out in the porch,\r\nlooking just as he did when I first saw him at Fayfield Junction\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nseemed only a few days ago!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, pausing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Maister!\xe2\x80\x9d he cheerfully responded. \xe2\x80\x9cWo\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t ee step in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stepped in, and took a seat on the bench in the porch. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to\r\nsee you looking so hearty,\xe2\x80\x9d I began. \xe2\x80\x9cLast time, I remember, I chanced\r\nto pass just as Lady Muriel was coming away from the house. Does she\r\nstill come to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has na forgotten me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t lose her\r\nbonny face for many days together. Well I mind the very first time she\r\ncome, after we\xe2\x80\x99d met at Railway Station. She told me as she come to mak\xe2\x80\x99\r\namends. Dear child! Only think o\xe2\x80\x99 that! To mak\xe2\x80\x99 amends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make amends for what?\xe2\x80\x9d I enquired. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could _she_ have done to\r\nneed it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it were loike this, you see? We were both on us a-waiting fur t\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntrain at t\xe2\x80\x99 Junction. And I had setten mysen down upat t\xe2\x80\x99 bench. And\r\nStation-Maister, _he_ comes and he orders me off\xe2\x80\x94fur t\xe2\x80\x99 mak\xe2\x80\x99 room for\r\nher Ladyship, you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember it all,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was there myself, that day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Was_ you, now? Well, an\xe2\x80\x99 she axes my pardon fur\xe2\x80\x99t. Think o\xe2\x80\x99 that, now!\r\n_My_ pardon! An owd ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-weel like me! Ah! She\xe2\x80\x99s been here many a\r\ntime, sin\xe2\x80\x99 then. Why, she were in here only yestere\xe2\x80\x99en, as it were,\r\nasittin\xe2\x80\x99, as it might be, where you\xe2\x80\x99re a-sitting now, an\xe2\x80\x99 lookin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsweeter and kinder nor an angel! An\xe2\x80\x99 she says \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve not got your\r\nMinnie, now,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, \xe2\x80\x98to fettle for ye.\xe2\x80\x99 Minnie was my\r\ngrand-daughter, Sir, as lived wi\xe2\x80\x99 me. She died, a matter of two months\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94or it may be three. She was a bonny lass\xe2\x80\x94and a good lass, too. Eh,\r\nbut life has been rare an\xe2\x80\x99 lonely without her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe covered his face in his hands: and I waited a minute or two, in\r\nsilence, for him to recover himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she says \xe2\x80\x98Just tak\xe2\x80\x99 _me_ fur your Minnie!\xe2\x80\x99 she says. \xe2\x80\x98Didna Minnie\r\nmak\xe2\x80\x99 your tea fur you?\xe2\x80\x99 says she. \xe2\x80\x98Ay,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. An she mak\xe2\x80\x99s the tea.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An\xe2\x80\x99 didna Minnie light your pipe?\xe2\x80\x99 says she. \xe2\x80\x98Ay,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. An\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nlights the pipe for me. \xe2\x80\x98An\xe2\x80\x99 didna Minnie set out your tea in t\xe2\x80\x99 porch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 I says \xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking you\xe2\x80\x99re Minnie hersen!\xe2\x80\x99 An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe cries a bit. We both on us cries a bit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain I kept silence for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 while I smokes my pipe, she sits an\xe2\x80\x99 talks to me\xe2\x80\x94as loving an\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\npleasant! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound I thowt it were Minnie come again! An\xe2\x80\x99 when she\r\ngets up to go, I says \xe2\x80\x98Winnot ye shak\xe2\x80\x99 hands wi\xe2\x80\x99 me?\xe2\x80\x99 says I. An\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsays \xe2\x80\x98Na,\xe2\x80\x99 she says: \xe2\x80\x98a cannot _shak\xe2\x80\x99 hands_ wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee!\xe2\x80\x99 she says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry she said _that_,\xe2\x80\x9d I put in, thinking it was the only instance\r\nI had ever known of pride of rank showing itself in Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, it werena _pride_!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, reading my thoughts.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says \xe2\x80\x98_Your_ Minnie never _shook hands_ wi\xe2\x80\x99 you!\xe2\x80\x99 she says. \xe2\x80\x98An\xe2\x80\x99\r\n_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ your Minnie now,\xe2\x80\x99 she says. An\xe2\x80\x99 she just puts her dear arms about\r\nmy neck\xe2\x80\x94and she kisses me on t\xe2\x80\x99 cheek\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 may God in Heaven bless her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd here the poor old man broke down entirely, and could say no more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98A CANNOT SHAK\xe2\x80\x99 HANDS WI\xe2\x80\x99 THEE!\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless her!\xe2\x80\x9d I echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd good night to you!\xe2\x80\x9d I pressed his hand,\r\nand left him. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Muriel,\xe2\x80\x9d I said softly to myself as I went\r\nhomewards, \xe2\x80\x9ctruly you know how to \xe2\x80\x98mak\xe2\x80\x99 amends\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeated once more by my lonely fireside, I tried to recall the strange\r\nvision of the night before, and to conjure up the face of the dear old\r\nProfessor among the blazing coals. \xe2\x80\x9cThat black one\xe2\x80\x94with just a touch of\r\nred\xe2\x80\x94would suit him well,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter such a catastrophe, it would\r\nbe sure to be covered with black stains\xe2\x80\x94and he would say:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe result of _that_ combination\xe2\x80\x94you may have noticed?\xe2\x80\x94was an\r\n_Explosion_! Shall I repeat the Experiment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d was the general cry. And we all\r\ntrooped off, in hot haste, to the Banqueting-Hall, where the feast had\r\nalready begun.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in helping the dishes, and very speedily every guest\r\nfound his plate filled with good things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always maintained the principle,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor began, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\r\nis a good rule to take some food\xe2\x80\x94occasionally. The great advantage of\r\ndinner-parties\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, actually here\xe2\x80\x99s the Other\r\nProfessor!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s no place left for him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OTHER PROFESSOR\xe2\x80\x99S FALL]\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor came in reading a large book, which he held close to\r\nhis eyes. One result of his not looking where he was going was that he\r\ntripped up, as he crossed the Saloon, flew up into the air, and fell\r\nheavily on his face in the middle of the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the kind-hearted Professor, as he helped him up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be _me_, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t trip,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Other Professor.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked much shocked. \xe2\x80\x9cAlmost _anything_ would be better\r\nthan _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt never does,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, aside to Bruno,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto be anybody else, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Bruno gravely replied \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99s got nuffin on my plate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor hastily put on his spectacles, to make sure that the\r\n_facts_ were all right, to begin with: then he turned his jolly round\r\nface upon the unfortunate owner of the empty plate. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would you\r\nlike next, my little man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said, a little doubtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll take some\r\nplum-pudding, please\xe2\x80\x94while I think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d (This was a whisper from Sylvie.) \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t good manners to\r\nask for a dish before it comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bruno whispered back \xe2\x80\x9cBut I might forget to ask for some, when it\r\ncomes, oo know\xe2\x80\x94I _do_ forget things, sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, seeing Sylvie\r\nabout to whisper more.\r\n\r\nAnd _this_ assertion Sylvie did not venture to contradict.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a chair had been placed for the Other Professor, between the\r\nEmpress and Sylvie. Sylvie found him a rather uninteresting neighbour:\r\nin fact, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afterwards remember that he had made more than\r\n_one_ remark to her during the whole banquet, and that was \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\ncomfort a Dictionary is!\xe2\x80\x9d (She told Bruno, afterwards, that she had been\r\ntoo much afraid of him to say more than \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d in reply; and that\r\nhad been the end of their conversation. On which Bruno expressed a very\r\ndecided opinion that _that_ wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth calling a \xe2\x80\x98conversation\xe2\x80\x99 at\r\nall. \xe2\x80\x9cOo should have asked him a riddle!\xe2\x80\x9d he added triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\n_I_ asked the Professor _three_ riddles! One was that one you asked me\r\nin the morning, \xe2\x80\x98How many pennies is there in two shillings?\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nanother was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bruno!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9c_That_ wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nriddle!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt _were_!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno fiercely replied.)\r\n\r\nBy this time a waiter had supplied Bruno with a plateful of _something_,\r\nwhich drove the plum-pudding out of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother advantage of dinner-parties,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor cheerfully\r\nexplained, for the benefit of any one that would listen, \xe2\x80\x9cis that it\r\nhelps you to _see_ your friends. If you want to _see_ a man, offer him\r\nsomething to eat. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same rule with a mouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis Cat\xe2\x80\x99s very kind to the Mouses,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said, stooping to stroke a\r\nremarkably fat specimen of the race, that had just waddled into the\r\nroom, and was rubbing itself affectionately against the leg of his\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Sylvie, pour some milk in your saucer. Pussie\xe2\x80\x99s ever so\r\nthirsty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want _my_ saucer?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got one yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno: \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wanted _mine_ for to give it some\r\n_more_ milk in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie looked unconvinced: however it seemed quite impossible for her\r\n_ever_ to refuse what her brother asked: so she quietly filled her\r\nsaucer with milk, and handed it to Bruno, who got down off his chair to\r\nadminister it to the cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe room\xe2\x80\x99s very hot, with all this crowd,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor said to\r\nSylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why they don\xe2\x80\x99t put some lumps of ice in the grate? You\r\nfill it with lumps of coal in the winter, you know, and you sit round it\r\nand enjoy the warmth. How jolly it would be to fill it now with lumps of\r\nice, and sit round it and enjoy the coolth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHot as it was, Sylvie shivered a little at the idea. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very cold\r\n_outside_,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy feet got almost frozen to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the _shoemaker\xe2\x80\x99s_ fault!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor cheerfully replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\noften I\xe2\x80\x99ve explained to him that he _ought_ to make boots with little\r\niron frames under the soles, to hold lamps! But he never _thinks_. No\r\none would suffer from cold, if only they would _think_ of those little\r\nthings. I always use hot ink, myself, in the winter. Very few people\r\never think of _that_! Yet how simple it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s very simple,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said politely. \xe2\x80\x9cHas the cat had enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThis was to Bruno, who had brought back the saucer only half-emptied.\r\n\r\nBut Bruno did not hear the question. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s somebody scratching at the\r\ndoor and wanting to come in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And he scrambled down off his\r\nchair, and went and cautiously peeped out through the door-way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it wanted to come in?\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie asked, as he returned to his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were a Mouse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it peepted in.

The Cat\xe2\x80\x99s _welly_ kind to Mouses.\xe2\x80\x99 And it said \xe2\x80\x98But I\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nsome imporkant business, what I _must_ attend to.\xe2\x80\x99 And it said \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncall again to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99 And it said \xe2\x80\x98Give my love to the Cat.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fat cat it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lord Chancellor, leaning across the\r\nProfessor to address his small neighbour. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite a wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was awfully fat when it camed in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno: \xe2\x80\x9cso it would be more\r\nwonderfuller if it got thin all in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that was the reason, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d the Lord Chancellor suggested,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhy you didn\xe2\x80\x99t give it the rest of the milk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cIt were a betterer reason.

P\xe2\x80\x99raps they\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t play with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy _should_ they?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Other Professor, suddenly waking up out of\r\na deep reverie. \xe2\x80\x9cThey might be asleep, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, if _I_ was awake,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said cunningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but they might indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d the Other Professor protested. \xe2\x80\x9cBoys don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nall go to sleep at once, you know. So these boys\xe2\x80\x94but who are you talking\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _never_ remembers to ask that first!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor whispered to the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the rest of _me_, a-course!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno exclaimed triumphantly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing I was two or three boys!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor sighed, and seemed to be sinking back into his\r\nreverie; but suddenly brightened up again, and addressed the Professor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more to be done _now_, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s the dinner to finish,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor said with a\r\nbewildered smile: \xe2\x80\x9cand the heat to bear. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy the\r\ndinner\xe2\x80\x94such as it is; and that you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind the heat\xe2\x80\x94such as it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sentence _sounded_ well, but somehow I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand it;\r\nand the Other Professor seemed to be no better off. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch as it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_what_?\xe2\x80\x9d he peevishly enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t as hot as it might be,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor replied, catching at the\r\nfirst idea that came to hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see what you mean _now_!\xe2\x80\x9d the Other Professor graciously\r\nremarked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very badly expressed, but I quite see it _now_! Thirteen\r\nminutes and a half ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, looking first at Bruno and then at\r\nhis watch as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cyou said \xe2\x80\x98this Cat\xe2\x80\x99s very kind to the Mouses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nIt must be a singular animal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it _are_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, after carefully examining the Cat, to make\r\nsure how many there were of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you know it\xe2\x80\x99s kind to the Mouses\xe2\x80\x94or, more correctly\r\nspeaking, the _Mice_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Cause it _plays_ with the Mouses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno; \xe2\x80\x9cfor to amuse them, oo\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is just what I _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ know,\xe2\x80\x9d the Other Professor rejoined.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy belief is, it plays with them to _kill_ them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s quite a _accident_!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno began, so eagerly, that it was\r\nevident he had already propounded this very difficulty to the Cat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\n\xe2\x80\x99splained all that to me, while it were drinking the milk. It said \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nteaches the Mouses new games: the Mouses likes it ever so much.\xe2\x80\x99 It said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sometimes little accidents happens: sometimes the Mouses kills\r\ntheirselves.\xe2\x80\x99 It said \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99s always _welly_ sorry, when the Mouses kills\r\ntheirselves.\xe2\x80\x99 It said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it was so _very_ sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, rather disdainfully, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _eat_ the Mouses after they\xe2\x80\x99d killed themselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this difficulty, also, had evidently not been lost sight of in the\r\nexhaustive ethical discussion just concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (the orator\r\nconstantly omitted, as superfluous, his own share in the dialogue, and\r\nmerely gave us the replies of the Cat) \xe2\x80\x9cIt said \xe2\x80\x98Dead Mouses _never_\r\nobjecks to be eaten.\xe2\x80\x99 It said \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no use wasting good Mouses.\xe2\x80\x99 It\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x98Wifful\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 sumfinoruvver. It said \xe2\x80\x98And oo may live to say \xe2\x80\x98How much\r\nI wiss I had the Mouse that then I frew away!\xe2\x80\x99 It said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt hadn\xe2\x80\x99t _time_ to say such a lot of things!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie interrupted\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo doosn\xe2\x80\x99t know how Cats speaks!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno rejoined contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cCats\r\nspeaks _welly_ quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n                             THE PIG-TALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time the appetites of the guests seemed to be nearly satisfied,\r\nand even _Bruno_ had the resolution to say, when the Professor offered\r\nhim a fourth slice of plum-pudding, \xe2\x80\x9cI thinks three helpings is enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Professor started as if he had been electrified. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\r\nhad nearly forgotten the most important part of the entertainment! The\r\nOther Professor is to recite a Tale of a Pig\xe2\x80\x94I mean a Pig-Tale,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncorrected himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has Introductory Verses at the beginning, and at\r\nthe end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t have Introductory Verses at the _end_, can it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till you hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor: \xe2\x80\x9cthen you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nsure it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t some in the _middle_, as well.\xe2\x80\x9d Here he rose to his feet,\r\nand there was an instant silence through the Banqueting-Hall: they\r\nevidently expected a speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies, and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor began, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Other Professor is so\r\nkind as to recite a Poem. The title of it is \xe2\x80\x98The Pig-Tale.\xe2\x80\x99 He never\r\nrecited it before!\xe2\x80\x9d (General cheering among the guests.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe will never\r\nrecite it again!\xe2\x80\x9d (Frantic excitement, and wild cheering all down the\r\nhall, the Professor himself mounting the table in hot haste, to lead the\r\ncheering, and waving his spectacles in one hand and a spoon in the\r\nother.)\r\n\r\nThen the Other Professor got up, and began:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are dining\r\n      Warily and well,\r\n      Hid in mossy cell:\r\n  Hid, I say, by waiters\r\n  Gorgeous in their gaiters\xe2\x80\x94\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ve a Tale to tell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98TEACHING TIGRESSES TO SMILE\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are feeding\r\n      Justices with jam,\r\n      Rich in frizzled ham:\r\n  Rich, I say, in oysters\r\n  Haunting shady cloisters\xe2\x80\x94\r\n      That is what I am.\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are teaching\r\n      Tigresses to smile,\r\n      Innocent of guile:\r\n  Smile, I say, not smirkle\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  Mouth a semicircle,\r\n      That\xe2\x80\x99s the proper style.\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are sleeping\r\n      All among the pins,\r\n      Where the loser wins:\r\n  Where, I say, he sneezes\r\n  When and how he pleases\xe2\x80\x94\r\n      So the Tale begins.\r\n\r\n  There was a Pig that sat alone\r\n    Beside a ruined Pump:\r\n  By day and night he made his moan\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  It would have stirred a heart of stone\r\n  To see him wring his hoofs and groan,\r\n    Because he could not jump.\r\n\r\n  A certain Camel heard him shout\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    A Camel with a hump.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, is it Grief, or is it Gout?\r\n  What is this bellowing about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  That Pig replied, with quivering snout,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I cannot jump!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  That Camel scanned him, dreamy-eyed.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMethinks you are too plump.\r\n  I never knew a Pig so wide\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  That wobbled so from side to side\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  Who could, however much he tried,\r\n    Do such a thing as _jump_!\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cYet mark those trees, two miles away,\r\n    All clustered in a clump:\r\n  If you could trot there twice a day,\r\n  Nor ever pause for rest or play,\r\n  In the far future\xe2\x80\x94Who can say?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    You may be fit to jump.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98HORRID WAS THAT PIG\xe2\x80\x99S DESPAIR!\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n  That Camel passed, and left him there,\r\n    Beside the ruined Pump.\r\n  Oh, horrid was that Pig\xe2\x80\x99s despair!\r\n  His shrieks of anguish filled the air.\r\n  He wrung his hoofs, he rent his hair,\r\n    Because he could not jump.\r\n\r\n  There was a Frog that wandered by\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    A sleek and shining lump:\r\n  Inspected him with fishy eye,\r\n  And said \xe2\x80\x9cO Pig, what makes you cry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  And bitter was that Pig\xe2\x80\x99s reply,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I cannot jump!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  That Frog he grinned a grin of glee,\r\n    And hit his chest a thump\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cO Pig,\xe2\x80\x9d said, \xe2\x80\x9cbe ruled by me,\r\n  And you shall see what you shall see.\r\n  This minute, for a trifling fee,\r\n    I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you how to jump!\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be faint from many a fall,\r\n    And bruised by many a bump:\r\n  But, if you persevere through all,\r\n  And practise first on something small,\r\n  Concluding with a ten-foot wall,\r\n    You\xe2\x80\x99ll find that you can jump!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  That Pig looked up with joyful start:\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOh Frog, you _are_ a trump!\r\n  Your words have healed my inward smart\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  Come, name your fee and do your part:\r\n  Bring comfort to a broken heart,\r\n    By teaching me to jump!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cMy fee shall be a mutton-chop,\r\n    My goal this ruined Pump.\r\n  Observe with what an airy flop\r\n  I plant myself upon the top!\r\n  Now bend your knees and take a hop,\r\n    For that\xe2\x80\x99s the way to jump!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FATAL JUMP]\r\n\r\n  Uprose that Pig, and rushed, full whack,\r\n    Against the ruined Pump:\r\n  Rolled over like an empty sack,\r\n  And settled down upon his back,\r\n  While all his bones at once went \xe2\x80\x98Crack!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n    It was a fatal jump.\r\n\r\nWhen the Other Professor had recited this Verse, he went across to the\r\nfire-place, and put his head up the chimney.

You _know_ you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, taking a fresh mouthful: \xe2\x80\x9che _gived_ it\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie considered this for a moment: then she saw her way out of it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, ask him to give _me_ some!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to enjoy that cake?\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoos that mean \xe2\x80\x98munch\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno whispered to Sylvie.\r\n\r\nSylvie nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt means \xe2\x80\x98to munch\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98to _like_ to munch.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno smiled at the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cI _doos_ enjoy it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor caught the word. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re enjoying\r\n_yourself_, little Man?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired.\r\n\r\nBruno\xe2\x80\x99s look of horror quite startled him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, _indeed_ I aren\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor looked thoroughly puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry some cowslip wine!\xe2\x80\x9d And he filled a glass and handed it to Bruno.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink this, my dear, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite another man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho shall I be?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno, pausing in the act of putting it to his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask so many questions!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie interposed, anxious to save the\r\npoor old man from further bewilderment. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we get the Professor to\r\ntell us a story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno adopted the idea with enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9c_Please_ do!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried eagerly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSumfin about tigers\xe2\x80\x94and bumble-bees\xe2\x80\x94and robin-redbreasts, oo knows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you always have _live_ things in stories?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nProfessor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you have events, or circumstances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _please_ invent a story like that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno.\r\n\r\nThe Professor began fluently enough. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce a coincidence was taking a\r\nwalk with a little accident, and they met an explanation\xe2\x80\x94a _very_ old\r\nexplanation\xe2\x80\x94so old that it was quite doubled up, and looked more like a\r\nconundrum\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Please_ go on!\xe2\x80\x9d both children exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe Professor made a candid confession. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very difficult sort to\r\ninvent, I find. Suppose Bruno tells one, first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno was only too happy to adopt the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce there were a Pig, and a Accordion, and two Jars of\r\nOrange-marmalade\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _dramatis person\xc3\xa6_,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, when the Pig played on the Accordion,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno went on, \xe2\x80\x9cone of the\r\nJars of Orange-marmalade didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the tune, and the other Jar of\r\nOrange-marmalade did like the tune\xe2\x80\x94I _know_ I shall get confused among\r\nthose Jars of Orange-marmalade, Sylvie!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will now recite the other Introductory Verses,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Other\r\nProfessor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98BLESSED BY HAPPY STAGS\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are choking\r\n      Baronets with bun,\r\n      Taught to fire a gun:\r\n  Taught, I say, to splinter\r\n  Salmon in the winter\xe2\x80\x94\r\n      Merely for the fun.\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are hiding\r\n      Crimes in carpet-bags,\r\n      Blessed by happy stags:\r\n  Blessed, I say, though beaten\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  Since our friends are eaten\r\n      When the memory flags.\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are tasting\r\n      Gratitude and gold,\r\n      Pale with sudden cold\r\n  Pale, I say, and wrinkled\xe2\x80\x94\r\n  When the bells have tinkled\r\n      And the Tale is told.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next thing to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor cheerfully remarked to the\r\nLord Chancellor, as soon as the applause, caused by the recital of the\r\nPig-Tale, had come to an end, \xe2\x80\x9cis to drink the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s health, is it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly!\xe2\x80\x9d the Lord Chancellor replied with much solemnity, as he\r\nrose to his feet to give the necessary directions for the ceremony.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFill your glasses!\xe2\x80\x9d he thundered. All did so, instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cDrink the\r\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s health!\xe2\x80\x9d A general gurgling resounded all through the Hall.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree cheers for the Emperor!\xe2\x80\x9d The faintest possible sound followed\r\n_this_ announcement: and the Chancellor, with admirable presence of\r\nmind, instantly proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cA speech from the Emperor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had begun his speech almost before the words were uttered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever unwilling to be Emperor\xe2\x80\x94since you all wish me to be Emperor\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nknow how badly the late Warden managed things\xe2\x80\x94with such enthusiasm as\r\nyou have shown\xe2\x80\x94he persecuted you\xe2\x80\x94he taxed you too heavily\xe2\x80\x94you know who\r\nis fittest man to be Emperor\xe2\x80\x94my brother had no sense\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow long this curious speech might have lasted it is impossible to say,\r\nfor just at this moment a hurricane shook the palace to its foundations,\r\nbursting open the windows, extinguishing some of the lamps, and filling\r\nthe air with clouds of dust, which took strange shapes in the air, and\r\nseemed to form words.\r\n\r\nBut the storm subsided as suddenly as it had risen\xe2\x80\x94the casements swung\r\ninto their places again: the dust vanished: all was as it had been a\r\nminute ago\xe2\x80\x94with the exception of the Emperor and Empress, over whom had\r\ncome a wondrous change. The vacant stare, the meaningless smile, had\r\npassed away: all could see that these two strange beings had returned to\r\ntheir senses.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor continued his speech as if there had been no interruption.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we have behaved\xe2\x80\x94my wife and I\xe2\x80\x94like two arrant Knaves. We deserve no\r\nbetter name. When my brother went away, you lost the best Warden you\r\never had. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing my best, wretched hypocrite that I am, to\r\ncheat you into making me an Emperor. Me! One that has hardly got the\r\nwits to be a shoe-black!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor wrung his hands in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is mad, good\r\npeople!\xe2\x80\x9d he was beginning. But both speeches stopped suddenly\xe2\x80\x94and, in\r\nthe dead silence that followed, a knocking was heard at the outer door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d was the general cry. People began running in and out. The\r\nexcitement increased every moment. The Lord Chancellor, forgetting all\r\nthe rules of Court-ceremony, ran full speed down the hall, and in a\r\nminute returned, pale and gasping for breath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n                          THE BEGGAR\xe2\x80\x99S RETURN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Imperial Highnesses!\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the old Beggar again! Shall\r\nwe set the dogs at him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring him here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor could scarcely believe his ears. \xe2\x80\x9c_Here_, your Imperial\r\nHighness? Did I rightly understand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring him here!\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperor thundered once more. The Chancellor\r\ntottered down the hall\xe2\x80\x94and in another minute the crowd divided, and the\r\npoor old Beggar was seen entering the Banqueting-Hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD BEGGAR\xe2\x80\x99S RETURN]\r\n\r\nHe was indeed a pitiable object: the rags, that hung about him, were all\r\nsplashed with mud: his white hair and his long beard were tossed about\r\nin wild disorder. Yet he walked upright, with a stately tread, as if\r\nused to command: and\xe2\x80\x94strangest sight of all\xe2\x80\x94Sylvie and Bruno came with\r\nhim, clinging to his hands, and gazing at him with looks of silent love.\r\n\r\nMen looked eagerly to see how the Emperor would receive the bold\r\nintruder. Would he hurl him from the steps of the da\xc3\xafs? But no. To their\r\nutter astonishment, the Emperor knelt as the beggar approached, and with\r\nbowed head murmured \xe2\x80\x9cForgive us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive us!\xe2\x80\x9d the Empress, kneeling at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s side, meekly\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nThe Outcast smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cRise up!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d And men saw\r\nwith wonder that a change had passed over the old beggar, even as he\r\nspoke. What had seemed, but now, to be vile rags and splashes of mud,\r\nwere seen to be in truth kingly trappings, broidered with gold, and\r\nsparkling with gems. All knew him now, and bent low before the Elder\r\nBrother, the true Warden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother mine, and Sister mine!\xe2\x80\x9d the Warden began, in a clear voice that\r\nwas heard all through that vast hall. \xe2\x80\x9cI come not to disturb you. Rule\r\non, as Emperor, and rule wisely. For I am chosen King of Elfland.\r\nTo-morrow I return there, taking nought from hence, save only\xe2\x80\x94save\r\nonly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d his voice trembled, and with a look of ineffable tenderness, he\r\nlaid his hands in silence on the heads of the two little ones who clung\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nBut he recovered himself in a moment, and beckoned to the Emperor to\r\nresume his place at the table. The company seated themselves again\xe2\x80\x94room\r\nbeing found for the Elfin-King between his two children\xe2\x80\x94and the Lord\r\nChancellor rose once more, to propose the next toast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next toast\xe2\x80\x94the hero of the day\xe2\x80\x94why, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t here!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off in\r\nwild confusion.\r\n\r\nGood gracious! Everybody had forgotten Prince Uggug!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was told of the Banquet, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Chancellor. \xe2\x80\x9c_That_ would be the duty of the\r\nGold Stick in Waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the Gold Stick come forwards!\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperor gravely said.\r\n\r\nThe Gold Stick came forwards. \xe2\x80\x9cI attended on His Imperial Fatness,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthe statement made by the trembling official. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him of the Lecture\r\nand the Banquet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat followed?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor: for the unhappy man seemed almost too\r\nfrightened to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Imperial Fatness was graciously pleased to be sulky. His Imperial\r\nFatness was graciously pleased to box my ears. His Imperial Fatness was\r\ngraciously pleased to say \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t-care\xe2\x80\x99 came to a bad end,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie whispered to Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nsure, but I _believe_ he was hanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor overheard her. \xe2\x80\x9c_That_ result,\xe2\x80\x9d he blandly remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nmerely a case of mistaken identity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth children looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to explain. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t-care\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Care\xe2\x80\x99 were twin-brothers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Care,\xe2\x80\x99 you know, killed the Cat. And they caught \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t-care\xe2\x80\x99 by\r\nmistake, and hanged him instead. And so \xe2\x80\x98Care\xe2\x80\x99 is alive still. But he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery unhappy without his brother. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they say \xe2\x80\x98Begone, dull\r\nCare!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very extremely interesting.\r\nWhy, it seems to explain _everything_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not quite _everything_,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor modestly rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nare two or three scientific difficulties\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was your general impression as to His Imperial Fatness?\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nEmperor asked the Gold Stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy impression was that His Imperial Fatness was getting more\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore _what_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll listened breathlessly for the next word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore PRICKLY!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be sent for _at once_!\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperor exclaimed. And the Gold\r\nStick went off like a shot. The Elfin-King sadly shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nuse, no use!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cLoveless, loveless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPale, trembling, speechless, the Gold Stick came slowly back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does not the Prince appear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can easily guess,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cHis Imperial Fatness is,\r\nwithout doubt, a little preoccupied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruno turned a look of solemn enquiry on his old friend. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do that\r\nword mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Professor took no notice of the question. He was eagerly\r\nlistening to the Gold Stick\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease your Highness! His Imperial Fatness is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Not a word more could\r\nhe utter.\r\n\r\nThe Empress rose in an agony of alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to him!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\nAnd there was a general rush for the door.\r\n\r\nBruno slipped off his chair in a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cMay we go too?\xe2\x80\x9d he eagerly\r\nasked. But the King did not hear the question, as the Professor was\r\nspeaking to him. \xe2\x80\x9c_Preoccupied_, your Majesty!\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\r\nwhat he is, no doubt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay we go and see him?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno repeated. The King nodded assent, and the\r\nchildren ran off. In a minute or two they returned, slowly and gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said the King. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94what _you_ said,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno replied, looking at the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nhard word.\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked to Sylvie for assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorcupine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor corrected her. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_Pre-occupied_,\xe2\x80\x99 you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98PORCUPINE!\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s _porcupine_,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that other word at all.\r\nAnd please will you come? The house is all in an uproar.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cAnd oo\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter bring an uproar-glass wiz oo!\xe2\x80\x9d added Bruno.)\r\n\r\nWe got up in great haste, and followed the children upstairs. No one\r\ntook the least notice of _me_, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all surprised at this, as\r\nI had long realised that I was quite invisible to them all\xe2\x80\x94even to\r\nSylvie and Bruno.\r\n\r\nAll along the gallery, that led to the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, an excited\r\ncrowd was surging to and fro, and the Babel of voices was deafening:\r\nagainst the door of the room three strong men were leaning, vainly\r\ntrying to shut it\xe2\x80\x94for some great animal inside was constantly bursting\r\nit half open, and we had a glimpse, before the men could push it back\r\nagain, of the head of a furious wild beast, with great fiery eyes and\r\ngnashing teeth. Its voice was a sort of mixture\xe2\x80\x94there was the roaring of\r\na lion, and the bellowing of a bull, and now and then a scream like a\r\ngigantic parrot. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no judging by the voice!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor cried\r\nin great excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the men at the door.\r\nAnd a general chorus of voices answered him \xe2\x80\x9cPorcupine! Prince Uggug has\r\nturned into a Porcupine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA new Specimen!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the delighted Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cPray let me go in.\r\nIt should be labeled at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the strong men only pushed him back. \xe2\x80\x9cLabel it, indeed! Do you want\r\nto be eaten up?\xe2\x80\x9d they cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about Specimens, Professor!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor, pushing his\r\nway through the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cTell us how to keep him safe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA large cage!\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor promptly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBring a large cage,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to the people generally, \xe2\x80\x9cwith strong bars of steel, and a\r\nportcullis made to go up and down like a mouse-trap! Does any one happen\r\nto have such a thing about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t sound a likely sort of thing for any one to have about him;\r\nhowever, they brought him one directly: curiously enough, there happened\r\nto be one standing in the gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it facing the opening of the door, and draw up the portcullis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThis was done in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlankets now!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a most interesting\r\nExperiment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere happened to be a pile of blankets close by: and the Professor had\r\nhardly said the word, when they were all unfolded and held up like\r\ncurtains all around. The Professor rapidly arranged them in two rows, so\r\nas to make a dark passage, leading straight from the door to the mouth\r\nof the cage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow fling the door open!\xe2\x80\x9d This did not need to be done: the three men\r\nhad only to leap out of the way, and the fearful monster flung the door\r\nopen for itself, and, with a yell like the whistle of a steam-engine,\r\nrushed into the cage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown with the portcullis!\xe2\x80\x9d No sooner said than done: and all breathed\r\nfreely once more, on seeing the Porcupine safely caged.\r\n\r\nThe Professor rubbed his hands in childish delight. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Experiment has\r\nsucceeded!\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAll that is needed now is to feed it three\r\ntimes a day, on chopped carrots and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about its food, just now!\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperor interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us\r\nreturn to the Banquet. Brother, will you lead the way?\xe2\x80\x9d And the old man,\r\nattended by his children, headed the procession down stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cSee the\r\nfate of a loveless life!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Bruno, as they returned to their\r\nplaces. To which Bruno made reply, \xe2\x80\x9cI always loved Sylvie, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nget prickly like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _is_ prickly, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor, who had caught the\r\nlast words, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we must remember that, however porcupiny, he is royal\r\nstill! After this feast is over, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a little present to\r\nPrince Uggug\xe2\x80\x94just to soothe him, you know: it isn\xe2\x80\x99t pleasant living in a\r\ncage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you give him for a birthday-present?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA small saucer of chopped carrots,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cIn giving\r\nbirthday-presents, _my_ motto is\xe2\x80\x94cheapness! I should think I save forty\r\npounds a year by giving\xe2\x80\x94oh, _what_ a twinge of pain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy old enemy!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cLumbago\xe2\x80\x94rheumatism\xe2\x80\x94that sort of\r\nthing. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and lie down a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d And he hobbled out of the\r\nSaloon, watched by the pitying eyes of the two children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be better soon!\xe2\x80\x9d the Elfin-King said cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cBrother!\xe2\x80\x9d turning\r\nto the Emperor, \xe2\x80\x9cI have some business to arrange with you to-night. The\r\nEmpress will take care of the children.\xe2\x80\x9d And the two Brothers went away\r\ntogether, arm-in-arm.\r\n\r\nThe Empress found the children rather sad company. They could talk of\r\nnothing but \xe2\x80\x9cthe dear Professor,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a pity he\xe2\x80\x99s so ill!\xe2\x80\x9d, till\r\nat last she made the welcome proposal \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go and see him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children eagerly grasped the hands she offered them: and we went off\r\nto the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s study, and found him lying on the sofa, covered up\r\nwith blankets, and reading a little manuscript-book. \xe2\x80\x9cNotes on Vol.\r\nThree!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, looking up at us. And there, on a table near him,\r\nlay the book he was seeking when first I saw him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are you now, Professor?\xe2\x80\x9d the Empress asked, bending over the\r\ninvalid.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked up, and smiled feebly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs devoted to your Imperial\r\nHighness as ever!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a weak voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAll of me, that is not\r\nLumbago, is Loyalty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sweet sentiment!\xe2\x80\x9d the Empress exclaimed with tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nseldom hear anything so beautiful as that\xe2\x80\x94even in a Valentine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must take you to stay at the seaside,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo you ever so much good! And the Sea\xe2\x80\x99s so grand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a Mountain\xe2\x80\x99s grander!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there grand about the Sea?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you could\r\nput it all into a teacup!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Some_ of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie corrected him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99d only want a certain number of tea-cups to hold it _all_.\r\nAnd _then_ where\xe2\x80\x99s the grandeur? Then as to a Mountain\xe2\x80\x94why, you could\r\ncarry it all away in a wheel-barrow, in a certain number of years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look grand\xe2\x80\x94the bits of it in the wheel-barrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie\r\ncandidly admitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when oo put it together again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re older,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll know that you _ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nput Mountains together again so easily! One lives and one learns, you\r\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it needn\xe2\x80\x99t be the _same_ one, need it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t it do,\r\nif _I_ live, and if _Sylvie_ learns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t_ learn without living!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I _can_ live without learning!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cOo just try me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I meant, was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor began, looking much puzzled,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94was\xe2\x80\x94that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know _everything_, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I _do_ know everything I know!\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the little fellow. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow ever so many things! Everything, \xe2\x80\x99cept the things I _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ know.\r\nAnd Sylvie knows all the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor sighed, and gave it up. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what a Boojum is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ know!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the thing what wrenches people out of\r\ntheir boots!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe means \xe2\x80\x98bootjack,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie explained in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t wrench people out of _boots_,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor mildly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nBruno laughed saucily. \xe2\x80\x9cOo _can_, though! Unless they\xe2\x80\x99re _welly_ tight\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce upon a time there was a Boojum\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor began, but stopped\r\nsuddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI forget the rest of the Fable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there was a\r\nlesson to be learned from it. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I forget _that_, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ tell oo a Fable!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno began in a great hurry. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce there were\r\na Locust, and a Magpie, and a Engine-driver. And the Lesson is, to learn\r\nto get up early\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nput the Lesson so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you invent that Fable?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cLast week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cA deal shorter ago than that. Guess again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ca\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t guess,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t invented yet!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno exclaimed triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\n_have_ invented a lovely one! Shall I say it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve _finished_ inventing it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sylvie. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd let the Lesson be\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to try again\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruno with great decision. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lesson are \xe2\x80\x98_not_ to try\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOnce there were a lovely china man, what stood on the\r\nchimbley-piece. And he stood, and he stood. And one day he tumbleded\r\noff, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt his self one bit. Only he _would_ try again. And\r\nthe next time he tumbleded off, he hurted his self welly much, and\r\nbreaked off ever so much varnish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did he come back on the chimney-piece after his first tumble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Empress. (It was the first sensible question she had asked in\r\nall her life.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ put him there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you know something about his tumbling,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nProfessor. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you pushed him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Bruno replied, very seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t pushed him _much_\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwere a _lovely_ china man,\xe2\x80\x9d he added hastily, evidently very anxious to\r\nchange the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my children!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Elfin-King, who had just entered the room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have a little chat together, before you go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d And he was\r\nleading them away, but at the door they let go his hands, and ran back\r\nagain to wish the Professor good night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98GOOD-NIGHT, PROFESSOR!\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night, Professor, good night!\xe2\x80\x9d And Bruno solemnly shook hands with\r\nthe old man, who gazed at him with a loving smile, while Sylvie bent\r\ndown to press her sweet lips upon his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night, little ones!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may leave me now\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nruminate. I\xe2\x80\x99m as jolly as the day is long, except when it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to\r\nruminate on some very difficult subject. All of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured\r\nsleepily as we left the room, \xe2\x80\x9call of me, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t _Bonhommie_, is\r\nRumination!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ did he say, Bruno?\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie enquired, as soon as we were safely\r\nout of hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _think_ he said \xe2\x80\x98All of me that isn\xe2\x80\x99t Bone-disease is Rheumatism.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhatever _are_ that knocking, Sylvie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie stopped, and listened anxiously. It sounded like some one kicking\r\nat a door. \xe2\x80\x9cI _hope_ it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that Porcupine breaking loose!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go on!\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nuffin to wait for, oo\r\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n                           LIFE OUT OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sound of kicking, or knocking, grew louder every moment: and at last\r\na door opened somewhere near us. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you say \xe2\x80\x98come in!\xe2\x80\x99 Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d my\r\nlandlady asked timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, come in!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA note has just been left for you, Sir, by the baker\xe2\x80\x99s boy. He said he\r\nwas passing the Hall, and they asked him to come round and leave it\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe note contained five words only. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease come at once. Muriel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden terror seemed to chill my very heart. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Earl is ill!\xe2\x80\x9d I said\r\nto myself. \xe2\x80\x9cDying, perhaps!\xe2\x80\x9d And I hastily prepared to leave the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo bad news, Sir, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d my landlady said, as she saw me out. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nboy said as some one had arrived unexpectedly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope that is it!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. But my feelings were those of fear rather\r\nthan of hope: though, on entering the house, I was somewhat reassured by\r\nfinding luggage lying in the entrance, bearing the initials \xe2\x80\x9cE. L.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only Eric Lindon after all!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, half relieved and half\r\nannoyed. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely she need not have sent for me for _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Muriel met me in the passage. Her eyes were gleaming\xe2\x80\x94but it was the\r\nexcitement of joy, rather than of grief. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a surprise for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that Eric Lindon is here?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, vainly trying to disguise\r\nthe involuntary bitterness of my tone. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_The funeral baked meats did\r\ncoldly furnish forth the marriage-tables_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help repeating\r\nto myself. How cruelly I was misjudging her!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she eagerly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least\xe2\x80\x94Eric _is_ here. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d her\r\nvoice quivered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is _another_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo need for further question. I eagerly followed her in. There on the\r\nbed, he lay\xe2\x80\x94pale and worn\xe2\x80\x94the mere shadow of his old self\xe2\x80\x94my old friend\r\ncome back again from the dead!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArthur!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. I could not say another word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, back again, old boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, smiling as I grasped his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He_,\xe2\x80\x9d indicating Eric, who stood near, \xe2\x80\x9csaved my life\xe2\x80\x94_He_ brought me\r\nback. Next to God, we must thank _him_, Muriel, my wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilently I shook hands with Eric and with the Earl: and with one consent\r\nwe moved into the shaded side of the room, where we could talk without\r\ndisturbing the invalid, who lay, silent and happy, holding his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand in his, and watching her with eyes that shone with the deep steady\r\nlight of Love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been delirious till to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d Eric explained in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\neven to-day he has been wandering more than once. But the sight of _her_\r\nhas been new life to him.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he went on to tell us, in would-be\r\ncareless tones\xe2\x80\x94I knew how he hated any display of feeling\xe2\x80\x94how he had\r\ninsisted on going back to the plague-stricken town, to bring away a man\r\nwhom the doctor had abandoned as dying, but who _might_, he fancied,\r\nrecover if brought to the hospital: how he had seen nothing in the\r\nwasted features to remind him of Arthur, and only recognised him when he\r\nvisited the hospital a month after: how the doctor had forbidden him to\r\nannounce the discovery, saying that any shock to the over taxed brain\r\nmight kill him at once: how he had staid on at the hospital, and nursed\r\nthe sick man by night and day\xe2\x80\x94all this with the studied indifference of\r\none who is relating the commonplace acts of some chance acquaintance!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this was his _rival_!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man who had won from him the\r\nheart of the woman he loved!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98HIS WIFE KNELT DOWN AT HIS SIDE\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sun is setting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Muriel, rising and leading the way to\r\nthe open window. \xe2\x80\x9cJust look at the western sky! What lovely crimson\r\ntints! We shall have a glorious day to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d We had followed her\r\nacross the room, and were standing in a little group, talking in low\r\ntones in the gathering gloom, when we were startled by the voice of the\r\nsick man, murmuring words too indistinct for the ear to catch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is wandering again,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Muriel whispered, and returned to the\r\nbedside. We drew a little nearer also: but no, this had none of the\r\nincoherence of delirium. \xe2\x80\x9c_What reward shall I give unto the Lord_,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ntremulous lips were saying, \xe2\x80\x9c_for all the benefits that He hath done\r\nunto me? I will receive the cup of salvation, and call\xe2\x80\x94and call_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nhere the poor weakened memory failed, and the feeble voice died into\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nHis wife knelt down at the bedside, raised one of his arms, and drew it\r\nacross her own, fondly kissing the thin white hand that lay so\r\nlistlessly in her loving grasp. It seemed to me a good opportunity for\r\nstealing away without making her go through any form of parting: so,\r\nnodding to the Earl and Eric, I silently left the room. Eric followed me\r\ndown the stairs, and out into the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Life or Death?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him, as soon as we were far enough from\r\nthe house for me to speak in ordinary tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is _Life_!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied with eager emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctors are quite\r\nagreed as to _that_. All he needs now, they say, is rest, and perfect\r\nquiet, and good nursing. He\xe2\x80\x99s quite sure to get rest and quiet, here:\r\nand, as for the nursing why, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just _possible_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (he tried\r\nhard to make his trembling voice assume a playful tone) \xe2\x80\x9che may even get\r\nfairly well nursed, in his present quarters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you so much for coming out to tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd, thinking he had now said all he had come to say, I held out my hand\r\nto bid him good night. He grasped it warmly, and added, turning his face\r\naway as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, there is one other thing I wanted to say.\r\nI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d like to know that\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99m not\xe2\x80\x94not in the mind I was in\r\nwhen last we met. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94that I can accept Christian belief\xe2\x80\x94at least,\r\nnot yet. But all this came about so strangely. And she had prayed, you\r\nknow. And I had prayed. And\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d his voice broke, and I could only just\r\ncatch the concluding words, \xe2\x80\x9c_there is a God that answers prayer!_ I\r\nknow it for certain now.\xe2\x80\x9d He wrung my hand once more, and left me\r\nsuddenly. Never before had I seen him so deeply moved.\r\n\r\nSo, in the gathering twilight, I paced slowly homewards, in a tumultuous\r\nwhirl of happy thoughts: my heart seemed full, and running over, with\r\njoy and thankfulness: all that I had so fervently longed for, and prayed\r\nfor, seemed now to have come to pass. And, though I reproached myself,\r\nbitterly, for the unworthy suspicion I had for one moment harboured\r\nagainst the true-hearted Lady Muriel, I took comfort in knowing it had\r\nbeen but a passing thought.\r\n\r\nNot Bruno himself could have mounted the stairs with so buoyant a step,\r\nas I felt my way up in the dark, not pausing to strike a light in the\r\nentry, as I knew I had left the lamp burning in my sitting-room.\r\n\r\nBut it was no common _lamplight_ into which I now stepped, with a\r\nstrange, new, dreamy sensation of some subtle witchery that had come\r\nover the place. Light, richer and more golden than any lamp could give,\r\nflooded the room, streaming in from a window I had somehow never noticed\r\nbefore, and lighting up a group of three shadowy figures, that grew\r\nmomently more distinct\xe2\x80\x94a grave old man in royal robes, leaning back in\r\nan easy chair, and two children, a girl and a boy, standing at his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you the Jewel still, my child?\xe2\x80\x9d the old man was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _yes_!\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie exclaimed with unusual eagerness. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n_ever_ lose it or forget it?\xe2\x80\x9d She undid the ribbon round her neck, as\r\nshe spoke, and laid the Jewel in her father\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nBruno looked at it admiringly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lovely brightness!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just like a little red star! May I take it in my hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie nodded: and Bruno carried it off to the window, and held it aloft\r\nagainst the sky, whose deepening blue was already spangled with stars.\r\nSoon he came running back in some excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie! Look here!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see right through it when I hold it up to the sky. And it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t red a bit: it\xe2\x80\x99s, oh such a lovely blue! And the words are all\r\ndifferent! Do look at it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie was quite excited, too, by this time; and the two children\r\neagerly held up the Jewel to the light, and spelled out the legend\r\nbetween them, \xe2\x80\x9cALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLUE LOCKET]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is the _other_ Jewel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bruno. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember,\r\nSylvie? The one you _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ choose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie took it from him, with a puzzled look, and held it, now up to the\r\nlight, now down. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blue, _one_ way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly to herself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s red, the _other_ way! Why, I thought there were _two_ of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94Father!\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly exclaimed, laying the Jewel once more in his\r\nhand, \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe it was the _same_ Jewel all the time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you choosed it from _itself_,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno thoughtfully remarked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, _could_ Sylvie choose a thing from itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my own one,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man replied to Sylvie, not noticing Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nembarrassing question, \xe2\x80\x9cit _was_ the same Jewel\xe2\x80\x94but you chose quite\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d And he fastened the ribbon round her neck again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSYLVIE WILL LOVE ALL\xe2\x80\x94ALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruno murmured, raising\r\nhimself on tiptoe to kiss the \xe2\x80\x98little red star.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, when you look\r\n_at_ it, it\xe2\x80\x99s red and fierce like the sun\xe2\x80\x94and, when you look _through_\r\nit, it\xe2\x80\x99s gentle and blue like the sky!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s own sky,\xe2\x80\x9d Sylvie said, dreamily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s own sky,\xe2\x80\x9d the little fellow repeated, as they stood, lovingly\r\nclinging together, and looking out into the night. \xe2\x80\x9cBut oh, Sylvie, what\r\nmakes the sky such a _darling_ blue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSylvie\xe2\x80\x99s sweet lips shaped themselves to reply, but her voice sounded\r\nfaint and very far away. The vision was fast slipping from my eager\r\ngaze: but it seemed to me, in that last bewildering moment, that not\r\nSylvie but an angel was looking out through those trustful brown eyes,\r\nand that not Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s but an angel\xe2\x80\x99s voice was whispering\r\n\r\n                             \xe2\x80\x9cIt is love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x98IT IS LOVE!\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GENERAL INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n[N.B. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99 refers to \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie and Bruno,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98II\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie and Bruno\r\nConcluded.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n  Accelerated Velocity, causes of; II. 190\r\n  Air, Cotton-wool lighter than, how to obtain; II. 166\r\n  Animal-Suffering, mystery of; II. 296\r\n  Anti-Teetotal Card; II. 139\r\n  Artistic effect said to require Indistinctness; I. 241\r\n  Asylums, Lunatic-, future use for; II. 132\r\n  Axioms of Science; II. 330\r\n\r\n                                   B\r\n  Badgers, the Three (Poem); I. 247\r\n  Barometer, sideways motion of; I. 13\r\n  Baron Doppelgeist; I. 85\r\n  Bath, Portable, for Tourists; I. 25\r\n  Bazaars, Charity-; II. 44\r\n  Beauty, Pain of realising; II. 337\r\n  Bed, reason for never going to; II. 141\r\n  Bees, Mind of; II. 29\r\n  Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s Song; II. 76\r\n  Bible-Selections for Children; I. xiii\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9d    \xe2\x80\x9d    learning by heart; I. xiv\r\n  Black Light, how to produce; II. 341\r\n  Boat, motion of, how to imitate on land; II. 108\r\n  Books, or Minds.

Our own age is\r\nmore fortunate, on this single score at least, having a larger and far\r\nnobler proportion of female writers; among whom, since the death of\r\nGeorge Eliot, there is none left whose touch is so exquisite and\r\nmasterly, whose love is so thoroughly according to knowledge, whose\r\nbright and sweet invention is so fruitful, so truthful, or so delightful\r\nas Mrs. Molesworth\xe2\x80\x99s. Any chapter of _The Cuckoo Clock_ or the\r\nenchanting _Adventures of Herr Baby_ is worth a shoal of the very best\r\nnovels dealing with the characters and fortunes of mere adults.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. A.\r\nC.

I cannot easily speak too highly of her work. It is a\r\ncurious art she has, not wholly English in its spirit, but a cross of\r\nthe old English with the Italian. Indeed, I should say Mrs. Molesworth\r\nhad also been a close student of the German and Russian, and had some\r\nway, catching and holding the spirit of all, created a method and tone\r\nquite her own.... Her characters are admirable and real.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_St. Louis\r\nGlobe-Democrat._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Molesworth has a rare gift for composing stories for children.\r\nWith a light yet forcible touch, she paints sweet and artless, yet\r\nnatural and strong, characters.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Congregationalist._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Molesworth always has in her books those charming touches of\r\nnature that are sure to charm small people. Her stories are so likely to\r\nhave been true that men \xe2\x80\x98grown up\xe2\x80\x99 do not disdain them.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Home Journal._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo English writer of childish stories has a better reputation than Mrs.\r\nMolesworth, and none with whose stories we are familiar deserves it\r\nbetter. She has a motherly knowledge of the child nature, a clear sense\r\nof character, the power of inventing simple incidents that interest, and\r\nthe ease which comes of continuous practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Mail and Express._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristmas would hardly be Christmas without one of Mrs. Molesworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstories. No one has quite the same power of throwing a charm and an\r\ninterest about the most commonplace every-day doings as she has, and no\r\none has ever blended fairy-land and reality with the same\r\nskill.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Educational Times._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Molesworth is justly a great favorite with children; her stories\r\nfor them are always charmingly interesting and healthful in\r\ntone.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Boston Home Journal._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Molesworth\xe2\x80\x99s books are cheery, wholesome, and particularly well\r\nadapted to refined life. It is safe to add that Mrs. Molesworth is the\r\nbest English prose writer for children.... A new volume from Mrs.\r\nMolesworth is always a treat.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_The Beacon._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo holiday season would be complete for a host of young readers without\r\na volume from the hand of Mrs. Molesworth.... It is one of the\r\npeculiarities of Mrs. Molesworth\xe2\x80\x99s stories that older readers can no\r\nmore escape their charm than younger ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Christian Union._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Molesworth ranks with George Macdonald and Mrs. Ewing as a writer\r\nof children\xe2\x80\x99s stories that possess real literary merit.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Milwaukee\r\nSentinel._\r\n\r\n                 THE SET, TEN VOLUMES, IN BOX, $10.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TELL ME A STORY, and HERR BABY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo delightful that we are inclined to join in the petition, and we hope\r\nshe may soon tell us more stories.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Athen\xc3\xa6um._\r\n\r\n\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cCARROTS\xe2\x80\x9d; Just a Little Boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the cleverest and most pleasing stories it has been our good\r\nfortune to meet with for some time.

Mrs. Molesworth is one of\r\nthose sunny, genial writers who has genius for writing acceptably for\r\nthe young. She has the happy faculty of blending enough real with\r\nromance to make her stories very practical for good without robbing them\r\nof any of their exciting interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Chicago Inter-Ocean._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Molesworth is one of the few writers of tales for children whose\r\nsentiment though of the sweetest kind is never sickly; whose religious\r\nfeeling is never concealed yet never obtruded; whose books are always\r\ngood but never \xe2\x80\x98goody.\xe2\x80\x99 Little Ted with his soft heart, clever head, and\r\nbrave spirit is no morbid presentment of the angelic child \xe2\x80\x98too good to\r\nlive,\xe2\x80\x99 and who is certainly a nuisance on earth, but a charming\r\ncreature, if not a portrait, whom it is a privilege to meet even in\r\nfiction.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_The Academy._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CUCKOO CLOCK.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful little story....

It relates the\r\nadventures of two lovable English children lost in Paris, and is just\r\nwonderful enough to pleasantly wring the youthful heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_New York\r\nTribune._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, in its way, indeed, a little classic, of which the real beauty\r\nand pathos can hardly be appreciated by young people.... It is not too\r\nmuch to say of the story that it is perfect of its kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Critic and\r\nGood Literature._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a charming little juvenile story from the pen of Mrs.\r\nMolesworth, detailing the various adventures of a couple of motherless\r\nchildren in searching for their father, whom they had missed in Paris,\r\nwhere they had gone to meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Montreal Star._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE TAPESTRY ROOM.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Molesworth is the queen of children\xe2\x80\x99s fairy-land. She knows how to\r\nmake use of the vague, fresh, wondering instincts of childhood, and to\r\ninvest familiar things with fairy glamour.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Athen\xc3\xa6um._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story told is a charming one of what may be called the neo-fairy\r\nsort.... There has been nothing better of its kind done anywhere for\r\nchildren, whether we consider its capacity to awaken interest or its\r\nwholesomeness.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Evening Post._\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHRISTMAS-TREE LAND.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is conceived after a happy fancy, as it relates the supposititious\r\njourney of a party of little ones through that part of fairy-land where\r\nChristmas-trees are supposed to most abound. There is just enough of the\r\nold-fashioned fancy about fairies mingled with the \xe2\x80\x98modern improvements\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto incite and stimulate the youthful imagination to healthful action.\r\nThe pictures by Walter Crane are, of course, not only well executed in\r\nthemselves, but in charming consonance with the spirit of the\r\ntale.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Troy Times._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Christmas-Tree Land_, by Mrs. Molesworth, is a book to make younger\r\nreaders open their eyes wide with delight. A little boy and a little\r\ngirl, domiciled in a great white castle, wander on their holidays\r\nthrough the surrounding fir-forests, and meet with the most delightful\r\npleasures. There is a fascinating, mysterious character in their\r\nadventures and enough of the fairylike and wonderful to puzzle and\r\nenchant all the little ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Boston Home Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A CHRISTMAS POSY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a collection of eight of those inimitable stories for children\r\nwhich none could write better than Mrs. Molesworth. Her books are prime\r\nfavorites with children of all ages, and they are as good and wholesome\r\nas they are interesting and popular. This makes a very handsome book,\r\nand its illustrations are excellent.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Christian at Work._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_A Christmas Posy_, by Mrs. Molesworth, is lovely and fragrant. Mrs.\r\nMolesworth succeeds by right to the place occupied with so much honor by\r\nthe late Mrs. Ewing, as a writer of charming stories for children. The\r\npresent volume is a cluster of delightful short stories. Mr. Crane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nillustrations are in harmony with the text.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Christian Intelligencer._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE CHILDREN OF THE CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The Children of the Castle_, by Mrs. Molesworth, is another of those\r\ndelightful juvenile stories of which this author has written so many. It\r\nis a fascinating little book, with a charming plot, a sweet, pure\r\natmosphere, and teaches a wholesome moral in the most winning\r\nmanner.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_B. S. E. Gazette._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The Children of the Castle_ are delightful creations, actual little\r\ngirls, living in an actual castle, but often led by their fancies into a\r\nshadowy fairy-land. There is a charming refinement of style and spirit\r\nabout the story from beginning to end; an imaginative child will find\r\nendless pleasure in it, and the lesson of gentleness and unselfishness\r\nis so artistically managed that it does not seem like a lesson, but only\r\na part of the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Milwaukee Sentinel._\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FOUR WINDS FARM.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Molesworth\xe2\x80\x99s books are always delightful, but of all none is more\r\ncharming than the volume with which she greets the holidays this season.\r\n_Four Winds Farm_ is one of the most delicate and pleasing books for a\r\nchild that has seen the light this many a day. It is full of fancy and\r\nof that instinctive sympathy with childhood which makes this author\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooks so attractive and so individual.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Boston Courier._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill more delicately fanciful is Mrs. Molesworth\xe2\x80\x99s lovely little tale\r\nof the _Four Winds Farm_. It is neither a dream nor a fairy story, but\r\nconcerns the fortune of a real little boy, named Gratian; yet the dream\r\nand the fairy tale seem to enter into his life, and make part of it. The\r\nfarmhouse in which the child lives is set exactly at the meeting-place\r\nof the four winds, and they, from the moment of his birth, have acted as\r\nhis self-elected godmothers.... All the winds love the boy, and, held in\r\nthe balance of their influence, he grows up as a boy should, simply and\r\ntruly, with a tender heart and firm mind. The idea of this little book\r\nis essentially poetical.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Literary World._\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NURSE HEATHERDALE\xe2\x80\x99S STORY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Nurse Heatherdale\xe2\x80\x99s Story_ is all about a small boy, who was good\r\nenough, yet was always getting into some trouble through complications\r\nin which he was not to blame. The same sort of things happens to men and\r\nwomen. He is an orphan, though he is cared for in a way by relations,\r\nwho are not so very rich, yet are looked on as well fixed. After many\r\nyouthful trials and disappointments he falls into a big stroke of good\r\nluck, which lifts him and goes to make others happy. Those who want a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s book will find nothing to harm and something to interest in this\r\nsimple story.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Commercial Advertiser._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 \xe2\x80\x9cUS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Molesworth\xe2\x80\x99s _Us, an Old-Fashioned Story_, is very charming.

Her bright and\r\nsweet invention is so truthful, her characters so faithfully drawn, and\r\nthe teaching of her stories so tender and noble, that while they please\r\nand charm they insensibly distil into the youthful mind the most\r\nvaluable lessons.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
