No longer associated with\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cdivine right\xe2\x80\x9d of kings, it has survived the downfall of feudal and\r\ntheocratic systems as a mystic personal emanation in place of a coercive\r\nweapon of statecraft.\r\n\r\nFreed from its ancient shackles of dogma and despotism it eludes\r\nanalysis. We know not how to gauge its effect on others, nor even upon\r\nourselves. Like the wind, it permeates the atmosphere we breathe, and\r\nbaffles while it stimulates the mind with its intangible but compelling\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThis psychic power, which the dead weight of materialism is impotent\r\nto suppress, is revealed in the lives and writings of men of the most\r\ndiverse creeds and nationalities. Apart from those who, like Buddha\r\nand Mahomet, have been raised to the height of demi-gods by worshipping\r\nmillions, there are names which leap inevitably to the mind--such names\r\nas Savonarola, Luther, Calvin, Rousseau--which stand for types and\r\nexemplars of spiritual aspiration. To this high priesthood of the quick\r\namong the dead, who can doubt that time will admit Leo Tolstoy--a genius\r\nwhose greatness has been obscured from us rather than enhanced by his\r\nduality; a realist who strove to demolish the mysticism of Christianity,\r\nand became himself a mystic in the contemplation of Nature; a man of\r\nardent temperament and robust physique, keenly susceptible to human\r\npassions and desires, who battled with himself from early manhood until\r\nthe spirit, gathering strength with years, inexorably subdued the flesh.\r\n\r\nTolstoy the realist steps without cavil into the front rank of modern\r\nwriters; Tolstoy the idealist has been constantly derided and scorned by\r\nmen of like birth and education with himself--his altruism denounced as\r\nimpracticable, his preaching compared with his mode of life to prove\r\nhim inconsistent, if not insincere. This is the prevailing attitude of\r\npoliticians and literary men.\r\n\r\nMust one conclude that the mass of mankind has lost touch with idealism?\r\nOn the contrary, in spite of modern materialism, or even because of it,\r\nmany leaders of spiritual thought have arisen in our times, and have won\r\nthe ear of vast audiences. Their message is a call to a simpler life, to\r\na recognition of the responsibilities of wealth, to the avoidance of war\r\nby arbitration, and sinking of class hatred in a deep sense of universal\r\nbrotherhood.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, when an idealistic creed is formulated in precise and\r\ndogmatic language, it invariably loses something of its pristine beauty\r\nin the process of transmutation. Hence the Positivist philosophy\r\nof Comte, though embodying noble aspirations, has had but a limited\r\ninfluence. Again, the poetry of Robert Browning, though less frankly\r\naltruistic than that of Cowper or Wordsworth, is inherently ethical, and\r\nreveals strong sympathy with sinning and suffering humanity, but it is\r\nmasked by a manner that is sometimes uncouth and frequently obscure.\r\nOwing to these, and other instances, idealism suggests to the world\r\nat large a vague sentimentality peculiar to the poets, a bloodless\r\nabstraction toyed with by philosophers, which must remain a closed book\r\nto struggling humanity.\r\n\r\nYet Tolstoy found true idealism in the toiling peasant who believed in\r\nGod, rather than in his intellectual superior who believed in himself\r\nin the first place, and gave a conventional assent to the existence of a\r\ndeity in the second. For the peasant was still religious at heart with\r\na naive unquestioning faith--more characteristic of the fourteenth or\r\nfifteenth century than of to-day--and still fervently aspired to God\r\nalthough sunk in superstition and held down by the despotism of the\r\nGreek Church. It was the cumbrous ritual and dogma of the orthodox state\r\nreligion which roused Tolstoy to impassioned protests, and led him step\r\nby step to separate the core of Christianity from its sacerdotal shell,\r\nthus bringing upon himself the ban of excommunication.\r\n\r\nThe signal mark of the reprobation of \xe2\x80\x9cHoly Synod\xe2\x80\x9d was slow in\r\ncoming--it did not, in fact, become absolute until a couple of years\r\nafter the publication of \xe2\x80\x9cResurrection,\xe2\x80\x9d in 1901, in spite of the\r\nattitude of fierce hostility to Church and State which Tolstoy had\r\nmaintained for so long. This hostility, of which the seeds were\r\nprimarily sown by the closing of his school and inquisition of his\r\nprivate papers in the summer of 1862, soon grew to proportions\r\nfar greater than those arising from a personal wrong. The dumb and\r\nsubmissive moujik found in Tolstoy a living voice to express his\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\nTolstoy was well fitted by nature and circumstances to be the peasant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspokesman. He had been brought into intimate contact with him in the\r\nvarying conditions of peace and war, and he knew him at his worst and\r\nbest. The old home of the family, Yasnaya Polyana, where Tolstoy, his\r\nbrothers and sister, spent their early years in charge of two guardian\r\naunts, was not only a halting-place for pilgrims journeying to and from\r\nthe great monastic shrines, but gave shelter to a number of persons of\r\nenfeebled minds belonging to the peasant class, with whom the devout and\r\nkindly Aunt Alexandra spent many hours daily in religious conversation\r\nand prayer.\r\n\r\nIn \xe2\x80\x9cChildhood\xe2\x80\x9d Tolstoy apostrophises with feeling one of those\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinnocents,\xe2\x80\x9d a man named Grisha, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose faith was so strong that you\r\nfelt the nearness of God, your love so ardent that the words flowed from\r\nyour lips uncontrolled by your reason. And how did you celebrate his\r\nMajesty when, words failing you, you prostrated yourself on the ground,\r\nbathed in tears\xe2\x80\x9d This picture of humble religious faith was amongst\r\nTolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s earliest memories, and it returned to comfort him and uplift\r\nhis soul when it was tossed and engulfed by seas of doubt. But the\r\naffection he felt in boyhood towards the moujiks became tinged with\r\ncontempt when his attempts to improve their condition--some of which are\r\ndescribed in \xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenina\xe2\x80\x9d and in the \xe2\x80\x9cLandlord\xe2\x80\x99s Morning\xe2\x80\x9d--ended in\r\nfailure, owing to the ignorance and obstinacy of the people. It was not\r\ntill he passed through the ordeal of war in Turkey and the Crimea\r\nthat he discovered in the common soldier who fought by his side an\r\nunconscious heroism, an unquestioning faith in God, a kindliness and\r\nsimplicity of heart rarely possessed by his commanding officer.\r\n\r\nThe impressions made upon Tolstoy during this period of active service\r\ngave vivid reality to the battle-scenes in \xe2\x80\x9cWar and Peace,\xe2\x80\x9d and are\r\ntraceable in the reflections and conversation of the two heroes, Prince\r\nAndre and Pierre Besukhov. On the eve of the battle of Borodino,\r\nPrince Andre, talking with Pierre in the presence of his devoted\r\nsoldier-servant Timokhine, says,--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Success cannot possibly be, nor has\r\nit ever been, the result of strategy or fire-arms or numbers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then what does it result from?\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98From the feeling that is in me, that is in him\xe2\x80\x99--pointing to\r\nTimokhine--\xe2\x80\x98and that is in each individual soldier.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then contrasts the different spirit animating the officers and the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The former,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98have nothing in view but their personal\r\ninterests. The critical moment for them is the moment at which they are\r\nable to supplant a rival, to win a cross or a new order. I see only one\r\nthing. To-morrow one hundred thousand Russians and one hundred thousand\r\nFrenchmen will meet to fight; they who fight the hardest and spare\r\nthemselves the least will win the day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s the truth, your Excellency, the real truth,\xe2\x80\x99 murmurs\r\nTimokhine; \xe2\x80\x98it is not a time to spare oneself. Would you believe it, the\r\nmen of my battalion have not tasted brandy? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a day for that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n they said.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the momentous battle which followed, Pierre was struck by the\r\nsteadfastness under fire which has always distinguished the Russian\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fall of each man acted as an increasing stimulus. The faces of the\r\nsoldiers brightened more and more, as if challenging the storm let loose\r\non them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this picture of fine \xe2\x80\x9cmorale\xe2\x80\x9d is that of the young\r\nwhite-faced officer, looking nervously about him as he walks backwards\r\nwith lowered sword.\r\n\r\nIn other places Tolstoy does full justice to the courage and patriotism\r\nof all grades in the Russian army, but it is constantly evident that\r\nhis sympathies are most heartily with the rank and file. What genuine\r\nfeeling and affection rings in this sketch of Plato, a common soldier,\r\nin \xe2\x80\x9cWar and Peace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlato Karataev was about fifty, judging by the number of campaigns in\r\nwhich he had served; he could not have told his exact age himself, and\r\nwhen he laughed, as he often did, he showed two rows of strong, white\r\nteeth. There was not a grey hair on his head or in his beard, and his\r\nbearing wore the stamp of activity, resolution, and above all, stoicism.\r\nHis face, though much lined, had a touching expression of simplicity,\r\nyouth, and innocence. When he spoke, in his soft sing-song voice, his\r\nspeech flowed as from a well-spring. He never thought about what he\r\nhad said or was going to say next, and the vivacity and the rhythmical\r\ninflections of his voice gave it a penetrating persuasiveness. Night and\r\nmorning, when going to rest or getting up, he said, \xe2\x80\x98O God, let me\r\nsleep like a stone and rise up like a loaf.\xe2\x80\x99 And, sure enough, he had no\r\nsooner lain down than he slept like a lump of lead, and in the morning\r\non waking he was bright and lively, and ready for any work. He could\r\ndo anything, just not very well nor very ill; he cooked, sewed, planed\r\nwood, cobbled his boots, and was always occupied with some job or other,\r\nonly allowing himself to chat and sing at night. He sang, not like a\r\nsinger who knows he has listeners, but as the birds sing to God, the\r\nFather of all, feeling it as necessary as walking or stretching himself.\r\nHis singing was tender, sweet, plaintive, almost feminine, in keeping\r\nwith his serious countenance. When, after some weeks of captivity his\r\nbeard had grown again, he seemed to have got rid of all that was not his\r\ntrue self, the borrowed face which his soldiering life had given him,\r\nand to have become, as before, a peasant and a man of the people. In the\r\neyes of the other prisoners Plato was just a common soldier, whom they\r\nchaffed at times and sent on all manner of errands; but to Pierre he\r\nremained ever after the personification of simplicity and truth, such as\r\nhe had divined him to be since the first night spent by his side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis clearly is a study from life, a leaf from Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCrimean\r\nJournal.\xe2\x80\x9d It harmonises with the point of view revealed in the \xe2\x80\x9cLetters\r\nfrom Sebastopol\xe2\x80\x9d (especially in the second and third series), and shows,\r\nlike them, the change effected by the realities of war in the intolerant\r\nyoung aristocrat, who previously excluded all but the comme-il-faut from\r\nhis consideration. With widened outlook and new ideals he returned to\r\nSt. Petersburg at the close of the Crimean campaign, to be welcomed by\r\nthe elite of letters and courted by society. A few years before he would\r\nhave been delighted with such a reception. Now it jarred on his awakened\r\nsense of the tragedy of existence. He found himself entirely out of\r\nsympathy with the group of literary men who gathered round him, with\r\nTurgenev at their head. In Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes they were false, paltry, and\r\nimmoral, and he was at no pains to disguise his opinions. Dissension,\r\nleading to violent scenes, soon broke out between Turgenev and Tolstoy;\r\nand the latter, completely disillusioned both in regard to his great\r\ncontemporary and to the literary world of St. Petersburg, shook off the\r\ndust of the capital, and, after resigning his commission in the army,\r\nwent abroad on a tour through Germany, Switzerland, and France.\r\n\r\nIn France his growing aversion from capital punishment became\r\nintensified by his witnessing a public execution, and the painful\r\nthoughts aroused by the scene of the guillotine haunted his sensitive\r\nspirit for long. He left France for Switzerland, and there, among\r\nbeautiful natural surroundings, and in the society of friends, he\r\nenjoyed a respite from mental strain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fresh, sweet-scented flower seemed to have blossomed in my spirit; to\r\nthe weariness and indifference to all things which before possessed\r\nme had succeeded, without apparent transition, a thirst for love, a\r\nconfident hope, an inexplicable joy to feel myself alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose halcyon days ushered in the dawn of an intimate friendship between\r\nhimself and a lady who in the correspondence which ensued usually\r\nstyled herself his aunt, but was in fact a second cousin. This lady, the\r\nCountess Alexandra A. Tolstoy, a Maid of Honour of the Bedchamber, moved\r\nexclusively in Court circles. She was intelligent and sympathetic, but\r\nstrictly orthodox and mondaine, so that, while Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s view of\r\nlife gradually shifted from that of an aristocrat to that of a social\r\nreformer, her own remained unaltered; with the result that at the end\r\nof some forty years of frank and affectionate interchange of ideas,\r\nthey awoke to the painful consciousness that the last link of mutual\r\nunderstanding had snapped and that their friendship was at an end.\r\n\r\nBut the letters remain as a valuable and interesting record of one\r\nof Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s rare friendships with women, revealing in his unguarded\r\nconfidences fine shades of his many-sided nature, and throwing light on\r\nthe impression he made both on his intimates and on those to whom he was\r\nonly known as a writer, while his moral philosophy was yet in embryo.\r\nThey are now about to appear in book form under the auspices of M.\r\nStakhovich, to whose kindness in giving me free access to the originals\r\nI am indebted for the extracts which follow. From one of the countess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst letters we learn that the feelings of affection, hope, and\r\nhappiness which possessed Tolstoy in Switzerland irresistibly\r\ncommunicated themselves to those about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are good in a very uncommon way,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is why\r\nit is difficult to feel unhappy in your company. I have never seen you\r\nwithout wishing to be a better creature. Your presence is a consoling\r\nidea . . . know all the elements in you that revive one\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\npossibly without your being even aware of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few years later she gives him an amusing account of the impression his\r\nwritings had already made on an eminent statesman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe you a small episode. Not long ago, when lunching with the\r\nEmperor, I sat next our little Bismarck, and in a spirit of mischief I\r\nbegan sounding him about you. But I had hardly uttered your name when he\r\nwent off at a gallop with the greatest enthusiasm, firing off the list\r\nof your perfections left and right, and so long as he declaimed your\r\npraises with gesticulations, cut and thrust, powder and shot, it was\r\nall very well and quite in character; but seeing that I listened with\r\ninterest and attention my man took the bit in his teeth, and flung\r\nhimself into a psychic apotheosis. On reaching full pitch he began to\r\nget muddled, and floundered so helplessly in his own phrases! all the\r\nwhile chewing an excellent cutlet to the bone, that at last I realised\r\nnothing but the tips of his ears--those two great ears of his. What a\r\npity I can\xe2\x80\x99t repeat it verbatim! but how? There was nothing left but a\r\njumble of confused sounds and broken words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTolstoy on his side is equally expansive, and in the early stages of the\r\ncorrespondence falls occasionally into the vein of self-analysis which\r\nin later days became habitual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a child I believed with passion and without any thought. Then at the\r\nage of fourteen I began to think about life and preoccupied myself with\r\nreligion, but it did not adjust itself to my theories and so I broke\r\nwith it. Without it I was able to live quite contentedly for ten years\r\n. . . everything in my life was evenly distributed, and there was no\r\nroom for religion. Then came a time when everything grew intelligible;\r\nthere were no more secrets in life, but life itself had lost its\r\nsignificance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe goes on to tell of the two years that he spent in the Caucasus before\r\nthe Crimean War, when his mind, jaded by youthful excesses, gradually\r\nregained its freshness, and he awoke to a sense of communion with Nature\r\nwhich he retained to his life\xe2\x80\x99s end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my notes of that time, and now reading them over I am not able\r\nto understand how a man could attain to the state of mental exaltation\r\nwhich I arrived at. It was a torturing but a happy time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFurther on he writes,--\xe2\x80\x9cIn those two years of intellectual work, I\r\ndiscovered a truth which is ancient and simple, but which yet I know\r\nbetter than others do. I found out that immortal life is a reality, that\r\nlove is a reality, and that one must live for others if one would be\r\nunceasingly happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point one realises the gulf which divides the Slavonic from\r\nthe English temperament. No average Englishman of seven-and-twenty (as\r\nTolstoy was then) would pursue reflections of this kind, or if he did,\r\nhe would in all probability keep them sedulously to himself.\r\n\r\nTo Tolstoy and his aunt, on the contrary, it seemed the most natural\r\nthing in the world to indulge in egoistic abstractions and to expatiate\r\non them; for a Russian feels none of the Anglo-Saxon\xe2\x80\x99s mauvaise honte\r\nin describing his spiritual condition, and is no more daunted by\r\nmetaphysics than the latter is by arguments on politics and sport.\r\n\r\nTo attune the Anglo-Saxon reader\xe2\x80\x99s mind to sympathy with a mentality\r\nso alien to his own, requires that Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s environment should be\r\ndescribed more fully than most of his biographers have cared to do. This\r\nprefatory note aims, therefore, at being less strictly biographical\r\nthan illustrative of the contributory elements and circumstances which\r\nsub-consciously influenced Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual evolution, since it is\r\napparent that in order to judge a man\xe2\x80\x99s actions justly one must be able\r\nto appreciate the motives from which they spring; those motives in turn\r\nrequiring the key which lies in his temperament, his associations, his\r\nnationality. Such a key is peculiarly necessary to English or American\r\nstudents of Tolstoy, because of the marked contrast existing between the\r\nRussian and the Englishman or American in these respects, a contrast\r\nby which Tolstoy himself was forcibly struck during the visit to\r\nSwitzerland, of which mention has been already made. It is difficult\r\nto restrain a smile at the poignant mental discomfort endured by\r\nthe sensitive Slav in the company of the frigid and silent English\r\nfrequenters of the Schweitzerhof (\xe2\x80\x9cJournal of Prince D. Nekhludov,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Lucerne, 1857), whose reserve, he realised, was \xe2\x80\x9cnot based on pride,\r\nbut on the absence of any desire to draw nearer to each other\xe2\x80\x9d; while he\r\nlooked back regretfully to the pension in Paris where the table d\xe2\x80\x99 hote\r\nwas a scene of spontaneous gaiety. The problem of British taciturnity\r\npassed his comprehension; but for us the enigma of Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s temperament\r\nis half solved if we see him not harshly silhouetted against a\r\nblank wall, but suffused with his native atmosphere, amid his native\r\nsurroundings. Not till we understand the main outlines of the Russian\r\ntemperament can we realise the individuality of Tolstoy himself: the\r\npersonality that made him lovable, the universality that made him great.\r\n\r\nSo vast an agglomeration of races as that which constitutes the Russian\r\nempire cannot obviously be represented by a single type, but it will\r\nsuffice for our purposes to note the characteristics of the inhabitants\r\nof Great Russia among whom Tolstoy spent the greater part of his\r\nlifetime and to whom he belonged by birth and natural affinities.\r\n\r\nIt may be said of the average Russian that in exchange for a precocious\r\nchildhood he retains much of a child\xe2\x80\x99s lightness of heart throughout\r\nhis later years, alternating with attacks of morbid despondency. He\r\nis usually very susceptible to feminine charm, an ardent but unstable\r\nlover, whose passions are apt to be as shortlived as they are violent.\r\nStory-telling and long-winded discussions give him keen enjoyment,\r\nfor he is garrulous, metaphysical, and argumentative. In money\r\nmatters careless and extravagant, dilatory and venal in affairs; fond,\r\nespecially in the peasant class, of singing, dancing, and carousing; but\r\nhis irresponsible gaiety and heedlessness of consequences balanced by\r\na fatalistic courage and endurance in the face of suffering and danger.\r\nCapable, besides, of high flights of idealism, which result in epics,\r\nbut rarely in actions, owing to the Slavonic inaptitude for sustained\r\nand organised effort. The Englishman by contrast appears cold and\r\ncalculating, incapable of rising above questions of practical utility;\r\nneither interested in other men\xe2\x80\x99s antecedents and experiences nor\r\nwilling to retail his own. The catechism which Plato puts Pierre\r\nthrough on their first encounter (\xe2\x80\x9cWar and Peace\xe2\x80\x9d) as to his family,\r\npossessions, and what not, are precisely similar to those to which\r\nI have been subjected over and over again by chance acquaintances in\r\ncountry-houses or by fellow travellers on journeys by boat or train. The\r\nnaivete and kindliness of the questioner makes it impossible to resent,\r\nthough one may feebly try to parry his probing. On the other hand he\r\noffers you free access to the inmost recesses of his own soul, and\r\nstupefies you with the candour of his revelations. This, of course,\r\nrelates more to the landed and professional classes than to the peasant,\r\nwho is slower to express himself, and combines in a curious way a firm\r\nbelief in the omnipotence and wisdom of his social superiors with a\r\nrooted distrust of their intentions regarding himself. He is like a\r\nbeast of burden who flinches from every approach, expecting always a\r\nkick or a blow. On the other hand, his affection for the animals\r\nwho share his daily work is one of the most attractive points\r\nin his character, and one which Tolstoy never wearied of\r\nemphasising--describing, with the simple pathos of which he was master,\r\nthe moujik inured to his own privations but pitiful to his horse,\r\nshielding him from the storm with his own coat, or saving him from\r\nstarvation with his own meagre ration; and mindful of him even in his\r\nprayers, invoking, like Plato, the blessings of Florus and Laura, patron\r\nsaints of horses, because \xe2\x80\x9cone mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget the animals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of a people so embedded in the soil bear a closer\r\nrelation to their native landscape than our own migratory populations,\r\nand patriotism with them has a deep and vital meaning, which is\r\nexpressed unconsciously in their lives.\r\n\r\nThis spirit of patriotism which Tolstoy repudiated is none the less\r\nthe animating power of the noble epic, \xe2\x80\x9cWar and Peace,\xe2\x80\x9d and of his\r\npeasant-tales, of his rare gift of reproducing the expressive Slav\r\nvernacular, and of his magical art of infusing his pictures of Russian\r\nscenery not merely with beauty, but with spiritual significance. I can\r\nthink of no prose writer, unless it be Thoreau, so wholly under the\r\nspell of Nature as Tolstoy; and while Thoreau was preoccupied with\r\nthe normal phenomena of plant and animal life, Tolstoy, coming near to\r\nPantheism, found responses to his moods in trees, and gained spiritual\r\nexpansion from the illimitable skies and plains. He frequently brings\r\nhis heroes into touch with Nature, and endows them with all the innate\r\nmysticism of his own temperament, for to him Nature was \xe2\x80\x9ca guide to\r\nGod.\xe2\x80\x9d So in the two-fold incident of Prince Andre and the oak tree (\xe2\x80\x9cWar\r\nand Peace\xe2\x80\x9d) the Prince, though a man of action rather than of sentiment\r\nand habitually cynical, is ready to find in the aged oak by the\r\nroadside, in early spring, an animate embodiment of his own despondency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Springtime, love, happiness?--are you still cherishing those deceptive\r\nillusions?\xe2\x80\x99 the old oak seemed to say. \xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it the same fiction ever?\r\nThere is neither spring, nor love, nor happiness! Look at those poor\r\nweather-beaten firs, always the same . . . look at the knotty arms\r\nissuing from all up my poor mutilated trunk--here I am, such as they\r\nhave made me, and I do not believe either in your hopes or in your\r\nillusions.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd after thus exercising his imagination, Prince Andre still casts\r\nbackward glances as he passes by, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the oak maintained its obstinate\r\nand sullen immovability in the midst of the flowers and grass growing at\r\nits feet. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, that oak is right, right a thousand times over. One must\r\nleave illusions to youth. But the rest of us know what life is worth; it\r\nhas nothing left to offer us.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSix weeks later he returns homeward the same way, roused from his\r\nmelancholy torpor by his recent meeting with Natasha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day was hot, there was storm in the air; a slight shower watered\r\nthe dust on the road and the grass in the ditch; the left side of the\r\nwood remained in the shade; the right side, lightly stirred by the wind,\r\nglittered all wet in the sun; everything was in flower, and from near\r\nand far the nightingales poured forth their song. \xe2\x80\x98I fancy there was an\r\noak here that understood me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Prince Andre to himself, looking\r\nto the left and attracted unawares by the beauty of the very tree he\r\nsought. The transformed old oak spread out in a dome of deep, luxuriant,\r\nblooming verdure, which swayed in a light breeze in the rays of the\r\nsetting sun. There were no longer cloven branches nor rents to be seen;\r\nits former aspect of bitter defiance and sullen grief had disappeared;\r\nthere were only the young leaves, full of sap that had pierced through\r\nthe centenarian bark, making the beholder question with surprise if this\r\npatriarch had really given birth to them. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, it is he, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nPrince Andre, and he felt his heart suffused by the intense joy which\r\nthe springtime and this new life gave him . . . \xe2\x80\x98No, my life cannot end\r\nat thirty-one! . . . It is not enough myself to feel what is within me,\r\nothers must know it too! Pierre and that \xe2\x80\x9cslip\xe2\x80\x9d of a girl, who would\r\nhave fled into cloudland, must learn to know me! My life must colour\r\ntheirs, and their lives must mingle with mine!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn letters to his wife, to intimate friends, and in his diary, Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove of Nature is often-times expressed. The hair shirt of the ascetic\r\nand the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s mantle fall from his shoulders, and all the poet in\r\nhim wakes when, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a feeling akin to ecstasy,\xe2\x80\x9d he looks up from his\r\nsmooth-running sledge at \xe2\x80\x9cthe enchanting, starry winter sky overhead,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n or in early spring feels on a ramble \xe2\x80\x9cintoxicated by the beauty of the\r\nmorning,\xe2\x80\x9d while he notes that the buds are swelling on the lilacs, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe birds no longer sing at random,\xe2\x80\x9d but have begun to converse.\r\n\r\nBut though such allusions abound in his diary and private\r\ncorrespondence, we must turn to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cossacks,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cConjugal Happiness\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n for the exquisitely elaborated rural studies, which give those early\r\nromances their fresh idyllic charm.\r\n\r\nWhat is interesting to note is that this artistic freshness and joy in\r\nNature coexisted with acute intermittent attacks of spiritual lassitude.\r\nIn \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cossacks,\xe2\x80\x9d the doubts, the mental gropings of Olenine--whose\r\npersonality but thinly veils that of Tolstoy--haunt him betimes even\r\namong the delights of the Caucasian woodland; Serge, the fatalistic\r\nhero of \xe2\x80\x9cConjugal Happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d calmly acquiesces in the inevitableness\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9clove\xe2\x80\x99s sad satiety\xe2\x80\x9d amid the scent of roses and the songs of\r\nnightingales.\r\n\r\nDoubt and despondency, increased by the vexations and failures attending\r\nhis philanthropic endeavours, at length obsessed Tolstoy to the verge of\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe disputes over arbitration had become so painful to me, the\r\nschoolwork so vague, my doubts arising from the wish to teach others,\r\nwhile dissembling my own ignorance of what should be taught, were so\r\nheartrending that I fell ill. I might then have reached the despair to\r\nwhich I all but succumbed fifteen years later, if there had not been a\r\nside of life as yet unknown to me which promised me salvation: this was\r\nfamily life\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cMy Confession\xe2\x80\x9d).\r\n\r\nIn a word, his marriage with Mademoiselle Sophie Andreevna Bers\r\n(daughter of Dr. Bers of Moscow) was consummated in the autumn of\r\n1862--after a somewhat protracted courtship, owing to her extreme\r\nyouth--and Tolstoy entered upon a period of happiness and mental peace\r\nsuch as he had never known. His letters of this period to Countess A. A.\r\nTolstoy, his friend Fet, and others, ring with enraptured allusions to\r\nhis new-found joy. Lassitude and indecision, mysticism and altruism, all\r\nwere swept aside by the impetus of triumphant love and of all-sufficing\r\nconjugal happiness. When in June of the following year a child was born,\r\nand the young wife, her features suffused with \xe2\x80\x9ca supernatural beauty\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n lay trying to smile at the husband who knelt sobbing beside her, Tolstoy\r\nmust have realised that for once his prophetic intuition had been\r\nunequal to its task. If his imagination could have conceived in\r\nprenuptial days what depths of emotion might be wakened by fatherhood,\r\nhe would not have treated the birth of Masha\xe2\x80\x99s first child in \xe2\x80\x9cConjugal\r\nHappiness\xe2\x80\x9d as a trivial material event, in no way affecting the mutual\r\nrelations of the disillusioned pair. He would have understood that at\r\nthis supreme crisis, rather than in the vernal hour of love\xe2\x80\x99s avowal,\r\nthe heart is illumined with a joy which is fated \xe2\x80\x9cnever to return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe parting of the ways, so soon reached by Serge and Masha, was in fact\r\ndelayed in Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s own life by his wife\xe2\x80\x99s intelligent assistance in\r\nhis literary work as an untiring amanuensis, and in the mutual anxieties\r\nand pleasures attending the care of a large family of young children.\r\nWider horizons opened to his mental vision, his whole being was\r\nquickened and invigorated. \xe2\x80\x9cWar and Peace,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenina,\xe2\x80\x9d all the\r\nsplendid fruit of the teeming years following upon his marriage, bear\r\nwitness to the stimulus which his genius had received. His dawning\r\nrecognition of the power and extent of female influence appears\r\nincidentally in the sketches of high society in those two masterpieces\r\nas well as in the eloquent closing passages of \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then must we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (1886). Having affirmed that \xe2\x80\x9cit is women who form public opinion, and\r\nin our day women are particularly powerful,\xe2\x80\x9d he finally draws a picture\r\nof the ideal wife who shall urge her husband and train her children\r\nto self-sacrifice. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch women rule men and are their guiding stars. O\r\nwomen--mothers! The salvation of the world lies in your hands!\xe2\x80\x9d In that\r\nappeal to the mothers of the world there lurks a protest which in\r\nlater writings developed into overwhelming condemnation. True, he chose\r\nmotherhood for the type of self-sacrificing love in the treatise \xe2\x80\x9cOn\r\nLife,\xe2\x80\x9d which appeared soon after \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then must we do?\xe2\x80\x9d but maternal\r\nlove, as exemplified in his own home and elsewhere, appeared to him as a\r\nnoble instinct perversely directed.\r\n\r\nThe roots of maternal love are sunk deep in conservatism. The child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphysical well-being is the first essential in the mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes--the\r\ngrowth of a vigorous body by which a vigorous mind may be fitly\r\ntenanted--and this form of materialism which Tolstoy as a father\r\naccepted, Tolstoy as idealist condemned; while the penury he courted as\r\na lightening of his soul\xe2\x80\x99s burden was averted by the strenuous exertions\r\nof his wife. So a rift grew without blame attaching to either, and\r\nTolstoy henceforward wandered solitary in spirit through a wilderness\r\nof thought, seeking rest and finding none, coming perilously near to\r\nsuicide before he reached haven.\r\n\r\nTo many it will seem that the finest outcome of that period of mental\r\ngroping, internal struggle, and contending with current ideas, lies in\r\nthe above-mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then must we do?\xe2\x80\x9d Certain it is that no human\r\ndocument ever revealed the soul of its author with greater sincerity.\r\nNot for its practical suggestions, but for its impassioned humanity, its\r\ninfectious altruism, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then must we do?\xe2\x80\x9d takes its rank among the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s few living books. It marks that stage of Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s evolution\r\nwhen he made successive essays in practical philanthropy which filled\r\nhim with discouragement, yet were \xe2\x80\x9cof use to his soul\xe2\x80\x9d in teaching him\r\nhow far below the surface lie the seeds of human misery. The slums of\r\nMoscow, crowded with beings sunk beyond redemption; the famine-stricken\r\nplains of Samara where disease and starvation reigned, notwithstanding\r\nthe stream of charity set flowing by Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s appeals and\r\nnotwithstanding his untiring personal devotion, strengthened further the\r\nconviction, so constantly affirmed in his writings, of the impotence of\r\nmoney to alleviate distress. Whatever negations of this dictum our own\r\nsystems of charitable organizations may appear to offer, there can be no\r\nquestion but that in Russia it held and holds true.\r\n\r\nThe social condition of Russia is like a tideless sea, whose sullen\r\nquiescence is broken from time to time by terrific storms which spend\r\nthemselves in unavailing fury. Reaction follows upon every forward\r\nmotion, and the advance made by each succeeding generation is barely\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nBut in the period of peace following upon the close of the Crimean\r\nWar the soul of the Russian people was deeply stirred by the spirit of\r\nProgress, and hope rose high on the accession of Alexander II.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of the serfs was only one among a number of projected\r\nreforms which engaged men\xe2\x80\x99s minds. The national conscience awoke and\r\nechoed the cry of the exiled patriot Herzen, \xe2\x80\x9cNow or never!\xe2\x80\x9d Educational\r\nenterprise was aroused, and some forty schools for peasant children\r\nwere started on the model of that opened by Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana\r\n(1861). The literary world throbbed with new life, and a brilliant\r\ncompany of young writers came to the surface, counting among them names\r\nof European celebrity, such as Dostoevsky, Nekrassov, and Saltykov.\r\nUnhappily the reign of Progress was short. The bureaucratic circle\r\nhemming in the Czar took alarm, and made haste to secure their\r\nascendancy by fresh measures of oppression. Many schools were closed,\r\nincluding that of Tolstoy, and the nascent liberty of the Press was\r\nstifled by the most rigid censorship.\r\n\r\nIn this lamentable manner the history of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s internal misrule\r\nand disorder has continued to repeat itself for the last sixty\r\nyears, revolving in the same vicious circle of fierce repression and\r\npersecution and utter disregard of the rights of individuals, followed\r\nby fierce reprisals on the part of the persecuted; the voice of protest\r\nno sooner raised than silenced in a prison cell or among Siberian\r\nsnow-fields, yet rising again and again with inextinguishable\r\nreiteration; appeals for political freedom, for constitutional\r\ngovernment, for better systems and wider dissemination of education, for\r\nliberty of the Press, and for an enlightened treatment of the masses,\r\ncallously received and rejected. The answer with which these appeals\r\nhave been met by the rulers of Russia is only too well known to the\r\ncivilised world, but the obduracy of Pharoah has called forth the\r\nplagues of Egypt. Despite the unrivalled agrarian fertility of Russia,\r\nfamines recur with dire frequency, with disease and riot in their train,\r\nwhile the ignominious termination of the Russo-Japanese war showed that\r\neven the magnificent morale of the Russian soldier had been undermined\r\nand was tainted by the rottenness of the authorities set over him. What\r\nin such circumstances as these can a handful of philanthropists achieve,\r\nand what avails alms-giving or the scattering of largesse to a people on\r\nthe point of spiritual dissolution?\r\n\r\nIn these conditions Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s abhorrence of money, and his assertion\r\nof its futility as a panacea for human suffering, appears not merely\r\ncomprehensible but inevitable, and his renunciation of personal property\r\nthe strictly logical outcome of his conclusions. The partition of his\r\nestates between his wife and children, shortly before the outbreak of\r\nthe great famine in 1892, served to relieve his mind partially; and\r\nthe writings of Henry George, with which he became acquainted at this\r\ncritical time, were an additional incentive to concentrate his thoughts\r\non the land question. He began by reading the American propagandist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSocial Problems,\xe2\x80\x9d which arrested his attention by its main principles\r\nand by the clearness and novelty of his arguments. Deeply impressed by\r\nthe study of this book, no sooner had he finished it than he possessed\r\nhimself of its forerunner, \xe2\x80\x9cProgress and Poverty,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the essence\r\nof George\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary doctrines is worked out.\r\n\r\nThe plan of land nationalisation there explained provided Tolstoy with\r\nwell thought-out and logical reasons for a policy that was already more\r\nthan sympathetic to him. Here at last was a means of ensuring economic\r\nequality for all, from the largest landowner to the humblest peasant--a\r\npractical suggestion how to reduce the inequalities between rich and\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nHenry George\xe2\x80\x99s ideas and methods are easy of comprehension. The land was\r\nmade by God for every human creature that was born into the world, and\r\ntherefore to confine the ownership of land to the few is wrong. If a man\r\nwants a piece of land, he ought to pay the rest of the community for the\r\nenjoyment of it. This payment or rent should be the only tax paid into\r\nthe Treasury of the State. Taxation on men\xe2\x80\x99s own property (the produce\r\nof their own labour) should be done away with, and a rent graduated\r\naccording to the site-value of the land should be substituted.\r\nMonopolies would cease without violently and unjustly disturbing society\r\nwith confiscation and redistribution. No one would keep land idle if he\r\nwere taxed according to its value to the community, and not according\r\nto the use to which he individually wished to put it. A man would then\r\nreadily obtain possession of land, and could turn it to account and\r\ndevelop it without being taxed on his own industry. All human beings\r\nwould thus become free in their lives and in their labour. They would no\r\nlonger be forced to toil at demoralising work for low wages; they\r\nwould be independent producers instead of earning a living by providing\r\nluxuries for the rich, who had enslaved them by monopolising the land.\r\nThe single tax thus created would ultimately overthrow the present\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccivilisation\xe2\x80\x9d which is chiefly built up on wage-slavery.\r\n\r\nTolstoy gave his whole-hearted adhesion to this doctrine, predicting a\r\nday of enlightenment when men would no longer tolerate a form of slavery\r\nwhich he considered as revolting as that which had so recently been\r\nabolished. Some long conversations with Henry George, while he was on\r\na visit to Yasnaya Polyana, gave additional strength to Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconviction that in these theories lay the elements essential to the\r\ntransformation and rejuvenation of human nature, going far towards\r\nthe levelling of social inequalities. But to inoculate the landed\r\nproprietors of Russia as a class with those theories was a task which\r\neven his genius could not hope to accomplish.\r\n\r\nHe recognised the necessity of proceeding from the particular to the\r\ngeneral, and that the perfecting of human institutions was impossible\r\nwithout a corresponding perfection in the individual. To this end\r\ntherefore the remainder of his life was dedicated. He had always held in\r\naversion what he termed external epidemic influences: he now endeavoured\r\nto free himself not only from all current conventions, but from every\r\nassociation which he had formerly cherished. Self-analysis and general\r\nobservation had taught him that men are sensual beings, and that\r\nsensualism must die for want of food if it were not for sex instincts,\r\nif it were not for Art, and especially for Music. This view of life he\r\nforcibly expressed in the \xe2\x80\x9cKreutzer Sonata,\xe2\x80\x9d in which Woman and Music,\r\nthe two magnets of his youth, were impeached as powers of evil. Already,\r\nin \xe2\x80\x9cWar and Peace\xe2\x80\x9d and in \xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenina,\xe2\x80\x9d his descriptions of female\r\ncharms resembled catalogues of weapons against which a man must arm\r\nhimself or perish. The beautiful Princess Helena, with her gleaming\r\nshoulders, her faultless white bosom, and her eternal smile is evidently\r\nan object of aversion to her creator; even as the Countess Betsy, with\r\nher petty coquetries and devices for attracting attention at the Opera\r\nand elsewhere, is a target for his contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cWoman is a stumbling-block\r\nin a man\xe2\x80\x99s career,\xe2\x80\x9d remarks a philosophical husband in \xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenina.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to love a woman and do any good work, and the only way\r\nto escape being reduced to inaction is to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven in his correspondence with the Countess A. A. Tolstoy this\r\nslighting tone prevails. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman has but one moral weapon instead\r\nof the whole male arsenal. That is love, and only with this weapon is\r\nfeminine education successfully carried forward.\xe2\x80\x9d Tolstoy, in fact,\r\nbetrayed a touch of orientalism in his attitude towards women. In part\r\nno doubt as a result of his motherless youth, in part to the fact\r\nthat his idealism was never stimulated by any one woman as it was by\r\nindividual men, his views retained this colouring on sex questions while\r\nthey became widened and modified in almost every other field of human\r\nphilosophy. It was only that, with a revulsion of feeling not seldom\r\nexperienced by earnest thinkers, attraction was succeeded by a repulsion\r\nwhich reached the high note of exasperation when he wrote to a man\r\nfriend, \xe2\x80\x9cA woman in good health--why, she is a regular beast of prey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNone the less, he showed great kindness and sympathy to the women who\r\nsought his society, appealing to him for guidance. One of these (an\r\nAmerican, and herself a practical philanthropist), Miss Jane Addams,\r\nexpressed with feeling her sense of his personal influence. \xe2\x80\x9cThe glimpse\r\nof Tolstoy has made a profound impression on me, not so much by what he\r\nsaid, as the life, the gentleness, the soul of him. I am sure you will\r\nunderstand my saying that I got more of Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy from our\r\nconversations than I had gotten from our books.\xe2\x80\x9d (Quoted by Aylmer Maude\r\nin his \xe2\x80\x9cLife of Tolstoy.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\nAs frequently happens in the lives of reformers, Tolstoy found himself\r\nmore often in affinity with strangers than with his own kin. The\r\nestrangement of his ideals from those of his wife necessarily affected\r\ntheir conjugal relations, and the decline of mutual sympathy inevitably\r\ninduced physical alienation. The stress of mental anguish arising from\r\nthese conditions found vent in pages of his diaries (much of which I\r\nhave been permitted to read), pages containing matter too sacred and\r\nintimate to use. The diaries shed a flood of light on Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s ideas,\r\nmotives, and manner of life, and have modified some of my opinions,\r\nexplaining many hitherto obscure points, while they have also enhanced\r\nmy admiration for the man. They not only touch on many delicate\r\nsubjects--on his relations to his wife and family--but they also give\r\nthe true reasons for leaving his home at last, and explain why he did\r\nnot do so before. The time, it seems to me, is not ripe for disclosures\r\nof this nature, which so closely concern the living.\r\n\r\nDespite a strong rein of restraint his mental distress permeates the\r\ntouching letter of farewell which he wrote some sixteen years before his\r\ndeath. He, however, shrank from acting upon it, being unable to satisfy\r\nhimself that it was a right step. This letter has already appeared in\r\nforeign publications,* but it is quoted here because \xe2\x80\x9cI have suffered\r\nlong, dear Sophie, from the discord between my life and my beliefs.\r\n\r\n     * And in Birukov\xe2\x80\x99s short Life of Tolstoy, 1911.  of the\r\n     light which it throws on the character and disposition of\r\n     the writer, the workings of his mind being of greater moment\r\n     to us than those impulsive actions by which he was too often\r\n     judged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot constrain you to alter your life or your accustomed ways.\r\nNeither have I had the strength to leave you ere this, for I thought\r\nmy absence might deprive the little ones, still so young, of whatever\r\ninfluence I may have over them, and above all that I should grieve\r\nyou. But I can no longer live as I have lived these last sixteen years,\r\nsometimes battling with you and irritating you, sometimes myself giving\r\nway to the influences and seductions to which I am accustomed and which\r\nsurround me. I have now resolved to do what I have long desired: to go\r\naway . . . Even as the Hindoos, at the age of sixty, betake themselves\r\nto the jungle; even as every aged and religious-minded man desires to\r\nconsecrate the last years of his life to God and not to idle talk, to\r\nmaking jokes, to gossiping, to lawn-tennis; so I, having reached the\r\nage of seventy, long with all my soul for calm and solitude, and if not\r\nperfect harmony, at least a cessation from this horrible discord between\r\nmy whole life and my conscience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had gone away openly there would have been entreaties,\r\ndiscussions: I should have wavered, and perhaps failed to act on my\r\ndecision, whereas it must be so. I pray of you to forgive me if my\r\naction grieves you. And do you, Sophie, in particular let me go, neither\r\nseeking me out, nor bearing me ill-will, nor blaming me . . . the\r\nfact that I have left you does not mean that I have cause of complaint\r\nagainst you . . . I know you were not able, you were incapable of\r\nthinking and seeing as I do, and therefore you could not change your\r\nlife and make sacrifices to that which you did not accept. Besides, I do\r\nnot blame you; on the contrary, I remember with love and gratitude the\r\nthirty-five long years of our life in common, and especially the first\r\nhalf of the time when, with the courage and devotion of your maternal\r\nnature, you bravely bore what you regarded as your mission. You have\r\ngiven largely of maternal love and made some heavy sacrifices . . . but\r\nduring the latter part of our life together, during the last fifteen\r\nyears, our ways have parted. I cannot think myself the guilty one; I\r\nknow that if I have changed it is not owing to you, or to the world,\r\nbut because I could not do otherwise; nor can I judge you for not having\r\nfollowed me, and I thank you for what you have given me and will ever\r\nremember it with affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, my dear Sophie, I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe personal isolation he craved was never to be his; but the isolation\r\nof spirit essential to leadership, whether of thought or action, grew\r\nyear by year, so that in his own household he was veritably \xe2\x80\x9cin it but\r\nnot of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt times his loneliness weighed upon him, as when he wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cYou would\r\nfind it difficult to imagine how isolated I am, to what an extent my\r\ntrue self is despised by those who surround me.\xe2\x80\x9d But he must, none\r\nthe less, have realised, as all prophets and seers have done, that\r\nsolitariness of soul and freedom from the petty complexities of social\r\nlife are necessary to the mystic whose constant endeavour is to simplify\r\nand to winnow, the transient from the eternal.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the isolation of his inner life he remained--or it might\r\nmore accurately be said he became--the most accessible of men.\r\n\r\nAppeals for guidance came to him from all parts of the world--America,\r\nFrance, China, Japan--while Yasnaya Polyana was the frequent resort of\r\nthose needing advice, sympathy, or practical assistance. None appealed\r\nto him in vain; at the same time, he was exceedingly chary of explicit\r\nrules of conduct. It might be said of Tolstoy that he became a spiritual\r\nleader in spite of himself, so averse was he from assuming authority.\r\nHis aim was ever to teach his followers themselves to hear the inward\r\nmonitory voice, and to obey it of their own accord. \xe2\x80\x9cTo know the meaning\r\nof Life, you must first know the meaning of Love,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthen see that you do what love bids you.\xe2\x80\x9d His distrust of \xe2\x80\x9cepidemic\r\nideas\xe2\x80\x9d extended to religious communities and congregations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must not go to meet each other, but go each of us to God. You say\r\nit is easier to go all together? Why yes, to dig or to mow. But one can\r\nonly draw near to God in isolation . . . I picture the world to myself\r\nas a vast temple, in which the light falls from above in the very\r\ncentre. To meet together all must go towards the light. There we shall\r\nfind ourselves, gathered from many quarters, united with men we did not\r\nexpect to see; therein is joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe humility which had so completely supplanted his youthful arrogance,\r\nand which made him shrink from impelling others to follow in his steps,\r\nendued him also with the teachableness of a child towards those whom\r\nhe accepted as his spiritual mentors. It was a peasant nonconformist\r\nwriter, Soutaev, who by conversing with him on the revelations of the\r\nGospels helped him to regain his childhood\xe2\x80\x99s faith, and incidentally\r\nbrought him into closer relations with religious, but otherwise\r\nuntaught, men of the people. He saw how instead of railing against fate\r\nafter the manner of their social superiors, they endured sickness and\r\nmisfortune with a calm confidence that all was by the will of God, as it\r\nmust be and should be. From his peasant teachers he drew the watchwords\r\nFaith, Love, and Labour, and by their light he established that concord\r\nin his own life without which the concord of the universe remains\r\nimpossible to realise. The process of inward struggle--told with\r\nunsparing truth in \xe2\x80\x9cConfession\xe2\x80\x9d--is finely painted in \xe2\x80\x9cFather Serge,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n whose life story points to the conclusion at which Tolstoy ultimately\r\narrived, namely, that not in withdrawal from the common trials and\r\ntemptations of men, but in sharing them, lies our best fulfilment of our\r\nduty towards mankind and towards God. Tolstoy gave practical effect to\r\nthis principle, and to this long-felt desire to be of use to the poor of\r\nthe country, by editing and publishing, aided by his friend Chertkov,*\r\nmodern literature has awakened so universal a sense of sympathy and\r\nadmiration, perhaps because none has been so entirely a labour of love.\r\n\r\n     * In Russia and out of it Mr. Chertkov has been the subject\r\n     of violent attack.  Many of the misunderstandings of\r\n     Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s later years have also been attributed by critics,\r\n     and by those who hate or belittle his ideas, to the\r\n     influence of this friend. These attacks are very regrettable\r\n     and require a word of protest. From tales, suited to the\r\n     means and intelligence of the humblest peasant. The\r\n     undertaking was initiated in 1885, and continued for many\r\n     years to occupy much of Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s time and energies. He\r\n     threw himself with ardour into his editorial duties; reading\r\n     and correcting manuscripts, returning them sometimes to the\r\n     authors with advice as to their reconstruction, and making\r\n     translations from foreign works--all this in addition to his\r\n     own original contributions, in which he carried out the\r\n     principle which he constantly laid down for his\r\n     collaborators, that literary graces must be set aside, and\r\n     that the mental calibre of those for whom the books were\r\n     primarily intended must be constantly borne in mind. He\r\n     attained a splendid fulfilment of his own theories,\r\n     employing the moujik\xe2\x80\x99s expressive vernacular in portraying\r\n     his homely wisdom, religious faith, and goodness of nature.\r\n     Sometimes the prevailing simplicity of style and motive is\r\n     tinged with a vague colouring of oriental legend, but the\r\n     personal accent is marked throughout. No similar achievement\r\n     in the beginning Mr. Chertkov has striven to spread the\r\n     ideas of Tolstoy, and has won neither glory nor money from\r\n     his faithful and single-hearted devotion.  He has carried on\r\n     his work with a rare love and sympathy in spite of\r\n     difficulties. No one appreciated or valued his friendship\r\n     and self-sacrifice more than Tolstoy himself, who was firmly\r\n     attached to him from the date of his first meeting,\r\n     consulting him and confiding in him at every moment, even\r\n     during Mr. Chertkov\xe2\x80\x99s long exile.\r\n\r\nThe series of educational primers which Tolstoy prepared and published\r\nconcurrently with the \xe2\x80\x9cPopular Tales\xe2\x80\x9d have had an equally large, though\r\nexclusively Russian, circulation, being admirably suited to their\r\npurpose--that of teaching young children the rudiments of history,\r\ngeography, and science. Little leisure remained for the service of Art.\r\n\r\nThe history of Tolstoy as a man of letters forms a separate page of his\r\nbiography, and one into which it is not possible to enter in the brief\r\ncompass of this introduction. It requires, however, a passing allusion.\r\nTolstoy even in his early days never seems to have approached near to\r\nthat manner of life which the literary man leads: neither to have shut\r\nhimself up in his study, nor to have barred the entrance to disturbing\r\nfriends. On the one hand, he was fond of society, and during his brief\r\nresidence in St. Petersburg was never so engrossed in authorship as to\r\nforego the pleasure of a ball or evening entertainment. Little wonder,\r\nwhen one looks back at the brilliant young officer surrounded and petted\r\nby the great hostesses of Russia. On the other hand, he was no devotee\r\nat the literary altar. No patron of literature could claim him as his\r\nconstant visitor; no inner circle of men of letters monopolised his idle\r\nhours. Afterwards, when he left the capital and settled in the country,\r\nhe was almost entirely cut off from the association of literary men, and\r\nnever seems to have sought their companionship. Nevertheless, he had all\r\nthrough his life many fast friends, among them such as the poet Fet,\r\nthe novelist Chekhov, and the great Russian librarian Stassov, who often\r\ncame to him. These visits always gave him pleasure. The discussions,\r\nwhether on the literary movements of the day or on the merits of Goethe\r\nor the humour of Gogol, were welcome interruptions to his ever-absorbing\r\nmetaphysical studies. In later life, also, though never in touch with\r\nthe rising generation of authors, we find him corresponding with them,\r\ncriticising their style and subject matter. When Andreev, the most\r\nmodern of all modern Russian writers, came to pay his respects to\r\nTolstoy some months before his death, he was received with cordiality,\r\nalthough Tolstoy, as he expressed himself afterwards, felt that there\r\nwas a great gulf fixed between them.\r\n\r\nLiterature, as literature, had lost its charm for him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nperfectly right,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes to a friend; \xe2\x80\x9cI care only for the idea, and\r\nI pay no attention to my style.\xe2\x80\x9d The idea was the important thing to\r\nTolstoy in everything that he read or wrote. When his attention was\r\ndrawn to an illuminating essay on the poet Lermontov he was pleased with\r\nit, not because it demonstrated Lermontov\xe2\x80\x99s position in the literary\r\nhistory of Russia, but because it pointed out the moral aims which\r\nunderlay the wild Byronism of his works. He reproached the novelist\r\nLeskov, who had sent him his latest novel, for the \xe2\x80\x9cexuberance\xe2\x80\x9d of his\r\nflowers of speech and for his florid sentences--beautiful in their way,\r\nhe says, but inexpedient and unnecessary. He even counselled the younger\r\ngeneration to give up poetry as a form of expression and to use prose\r\ninstead. Poetry, he maintained, was always artificial and obscure.\r\nHis attitude towards the art of writing remained to the end one of\r\nhostility. Whenever he caught himself working for art he was wont to\r\nreproach himself, and his diaries contain many recriminations against\r\nhis own weakness in yielding to this besetting temptation. Yet to these\r\nvery lapses we are indebted for this collection of fragments.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of stories and plays contained in these volumes\r\ndate from the years following upon Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s pedagogic activity. Long\r\nintervals, however, elapsed in most cases between the original synopsis\r\nand the final touches. Thus \xe2\x80\x9cFather Serge,\xe2\x80\x9d of which he sketched the\r\noutline to Mr. Chertkov in 1890, was so often put aside to make way for\r\npurely ethical writings that not till 1898 does the entry occur in his\r\ndiary, \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day, quite unexpectedly, I finished Serge.\xe2\x80\x9d A year previously\r\na dramatic incident had come to his knowledge, which he elaborated\r\nin the play entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man who was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d It ran on the lines\r\nfamiliarised by Enoch Arden and similar stories, of a wife deserted\r\nby her husband and supported in his absence by a benefactor, whom\r\nshe subsequently marries. In this instance the supposed dead man was\r\nsuddenly resuscitated as the result of his own admissions in his\r\ncups, the wife and her second husband being consequently arrested and\r\ncondemned to a term of imprisonment. Tolstoy seriously attacked the\r\nsubject during the summer of 1900, and having brought it within a\r\nmeasurable distance of completion in a shorter time than was usual with\r\nhim, submitted it to the judgment of a circle of friends. The drama made\r\na deep impression on the privileged few who read it, and some mention of\r\nit appeared in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards a young man came to see Tolstoy in private. He begged\r\nhim to refrain from publishing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man who was dead,\xe2\x80\x9d as it was the\r\nhistory of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s life, and would distress her gravely, besides\r\npossibly occasioning further police intervention. Tolstoy promptly\r\nconsented, and the play remained, as it now appears, in an unfinished\r\ncondition. He had already felt doubtful whether \xe2\x80\x9cit was a thing God\r\nwould approve,\xe2\x80\x9d Art for Art\xe2\x80\x99s sake having in his eyes no right to\r\nexistence. For this reason a didactic tendency is increasingly evident\r\nin these later stories. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the Ball\xe2\x80\x9d gives a painful picture of\r\nRussian military cruelty; \xe2\x80\x9cThe Forged Coupon\xe2\x80\x9d traces the cancerous\r\ngrowth of evil, and demonstrates with dramatic force the cumulative\r\nmisery resulting from one apparently trivial act of wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nOf the three plays included in these volumes, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Light that shines\r\nin Darkness\xe2\x80\x9d has a special claim to our attention as an example of\r\nautobiography in the guise of drama. It is a specimen of Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s gift\r\nof seeing himself as others saw him, and viewing a question in all\r\nits bearings. It presents not actions but ideas, giving with entire\r\nimpartiality the opinions of his home circle, of his friends, of the\r\nChurch and of the State, in regard to his altruistic propaganda and\r\nto the anarchism of which he has been accused. The scene of the\r\nrenunciation of the estates of the hero may be taken as a literal\r\nversion of what actually took place in regard to Tolstoy himself,\r\nwhile the dialogues by which the piece is carried forward are more like\r\nverbatim records than imaginary conversations.\r\n\r\nThis play was, in addition, a medium by which Tolstoy emphasised\r\nhis abhorrence of military service, and probably for this reason its\r\nproduction is absolutely forbidden in Russia. A word may be said here on\r\nTolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s so-called Anarchy, a term admitting of grave misconstruction.\r\nIn that he denied the benefit of existing governments to the people\r\nover whom they ruled, and in that he stigmatised standing armies as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccollections of disciplined murderers,\xe2\x80\x9d Tolstoy was an Anarchist; but in\r\nthat he reprobated the methods of violence, no matter how righteous\r\nthe cause at stake, and upheld by word and deed the gospel of Love\r\nand submission, he cannot be judged guilty of Anarchism in its full\r\nsignificance. He could not, however, suppress the sympathy which he\r\nfelt with those whose resistance to oppression brought them into deadly\r\nconflict with autocracy. He found in the Caucasian chieftain, Hadji\r\nMurat, a subject full of human interest and dramatic possibilities; and\r\nthough some eight years passed before he corrected the manuscript for\r\nthe last time (in 1903), it is evident from the numbers of entries in\r\nhis diary that it had greatly occupied his thoughts so far back even\r\nas the period which he spent in Tiflis prior to the Crimean war. It was\r\nthen that the final subjugation of the Caucasus took place, and Shamil\r\nand his devoted band made their last struggle for freedom. After the\r\nlapse of half a century, Tolstoy gave vent in \xe2\x80\x9cHadji Murat\xe2\x80\x9d to the\r\nresentment which the military despotism of Nicholas I. had roused in his\r\nsensitive and fearless spirit.\r\n\r\nCourage was the dominant note in Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s character, and none have\r\nexcelled him in portraying brave men. His own fearlessness was of the\r\nrarest, in that it was both physical and moral. The mettle tried and\r\nproved at Sebastopol sustained him when he had drawn on himself the\r\nbitter animosity of \xe2\x80\x9cHoly Synod\xe2\x80\x9d and the relentless anger of Czardom.\r\nIn spite of his nonresistance doctrine, Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s courage was not of\r\nthe passive order. It was his natural bent to rouse his foes to combat,\r\nrather than wait for their attack, to put on the defensive every\r\nfalsehood and every wrong of which he was cognisant. Truth in himself\r\nand in others was what he most desired, and that to which he strove at\r\nall costs to attain. He was his own severest critic, weighing his own\r\nactions, analysing his own thoughts, and baring himself to the eyes\r\nof the world with unflinching candour. Greatest of autobiographers, he\r\nextenuates nothing: you see the whole man with his worst faults and\r\nbest qualities; weaknesses accentuated by the energy with which they\r\nare charactered, apparent waste of mental forces bent on solving the\r\ninsoluble, inherited tastes and prejudices, altruistic impulses\r\nand virile passions, egoism and idealism, all strangely mingled and\r\ncontinually warring against each other, until from the death-throes of\r\nspiritual conflict issued a new birth and a new life. In the ancient\r\nScripture \xe2\x80\x9cGod is love\xe2\x80\x9d Tolstoy discerned fresh meaning, and strove with\r\nsuperhuman energy to bring home that meaning to the world at large. His\r\ndoctrine in fact appears less as a new light in the darkness than as a\r\nrevival of the pure flame of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Mystic of the Galilean hills,\xe2\x80\x9d whose\r\nteaching he accepted while denying His divinity.\r\n\r\nOf Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs in regard to the Christian religion it may be said\r\nthat with advancing years he became more and more disposed to regard\r\nreligious truth as one continuous stream of spiritual thought flowing\r\nthrough the ages of man\xe2\x80\x99s history, emanating principally from the\r\ninspired prophets and seers of Israel, India, and China. Finally,\r\nin 1909, in a letter to a friend he summed up his conviction in the\r\nfollowing words:--\xe2\x80\x9cFor me the doctrine of Jesus is simply one of those\r\nbeautiful religious doctrines which we have received from Egyptian,\r\nJewish, Hindoo, Chinese, and Greek antiquity. The two great principles\r\nof Jesus: love of God--in a word absolute perfection--and love of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneighbour, that is to say, love of all men without distinction, have\r\nbeen preached by all the sages of the world--Krishna, Buddha, Lao-tse,\r\nConfucius, Socrates, Plato, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and among the\r\nmoderns, Rousseau, Pascal, Kant, Emerson, Channing, and many others.\r\nReligious and moral truth is everywhere and always the same. I have\r\nno predilection whatever for Christianity. If I have been particularly\r\ninterested in the doctrine of Jesus it is, firstly, because I was born\r\nin that religion and have lived among Christians; secondly, because I\r\nhave found a great spiritual joy in freeing the doctrine in its purity\r\nfrom the astounding falsifications wrought by the Churches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s life-work was indeed a splendid striving to free truth from\r\nfalsehood, to simplify the complexities of civilisation and demonstrate\r\ntheir futility. Realists as gifted have come and gone and left but\r\nlittle trace. It is conceivable that the great trilogy of \xe2\x80\x9cAnna\r\nKarenina,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWar and Peace,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cResurrection\xe2\x80\x9d may one day be forgotten,\r\nbut Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s teaching stands on firmer foundations, and has stirred the\r\nhearts of thousands who are indifferent to the finest display of psychic\r\nanalysis. He has taught men to venture beyond the limits set by reason,\r\nto rise above the actual and to find the meaning of life in love. It was\r\nhis mission to probe our moral ulcers to the roots and to raise moribund\r\nideals from the dust, breathing his own vitality into them, till they\r\nrose before our eyes as living aspirations. The spiritual joy of\r\nwhich he wrote was no rhetorical hyperbole; it was manifest in the man\r\nhimself, and was the fount of the lofty idealism which made him not only\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Conscience of Russia\xe2\x80\x9d but of the civilised world.\r\n\r\nIdealism is one of those large abstractions which are invested by\r\nvarious minds with varying shades of meaning, and which find expression\r\nin an infinite number of forms. Ideals bred and fostered in the heart of\r\nman receive at birth an impress from the life that engenders them, and\r\nwhen that life is tempest-tossed the thought that springs from it\r\nmust bear a birth-mark of the storm. That birth-mark is stamped on all\r\nTolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s utterances, the simplest and the most metaphysical. But though\r\nhe did not pass scathless through the purging fires, nor escape with\r\neyes undimmed from the mystic light which flooded his soul, his ideal is\r\nnot thereby invalidated. It was, he admitted, unattainable, but none\r\nthe less a state of perfection to which we must continually aspire,\r\nundaunted by partial failure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing wrong in not living up to the ideal which you have\r\nmade for yourself, but what is wrong is, if on looking back, you cannot\r\nsee that you have made the least step nearer to your ideal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow far Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s doctrines may influence succeeding generations it is\r\nimpossible to foretell; but when time has extinguished what is merely\r\npersonal or racial, the divine spark which he received from his great\r\nspiritual forerunners in other times and countries will undoubtedly be\r\nfound alight. His universality enabled him to unite himself closely with\r\nthem in mental sympathy; sometimes so closely, as in the case of J. J.\r\nRousseau, as to raise analogies and comparisons designed to show that he\r\nmerely followed in a well-worn pathway. Yet the similarity of Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nideas to those of the author of the \xe2\x80\x9cContrat Social\xe2\x80\x9d hardly goes beyond\r\na mutual distrust of Art and Science as aids to human happiness\r\nand virtue, and a desire to establish among mankind a true sense of\r\nbrotherhood. For the rest, the appeals which they individually made to\r\nHumanity were as dissimilar as the currents of their lives, and equally\r\ndissimilar in effect.\r\n\r\nThe magic flute of Rousseau\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence breathed fanaticism into his\r\ndisciples, and a desire to mass themselves against the foes of liberty.\r\nTolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s trumpet-call sounds a deeper note. It pierces the heart,\r\nsummoning each man to the inquisition of his own conscience, and to\r\njustify his existence by labour, that he may thereafter sleep the sleep\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nThe exaltation which he awakens owes nothing to rhythmical language\r\nnor to subtle interpretations of sensuous emotion; it proceeds from a\r\nperception of eternal truth, the truth that has love, faith, courage,\r\nand self-sacrifice for the cornerstones of its enduring edifice.\r\n\r\n                                                    C.

The Governor of the province\r\nhad sent him an extraordinarily stupid minute, almost assuming that his\r\ndealings had been dishonest.\r\n\r\nFedor Mihailovich felt embittered, and wrote at once a sharp answer. On\r\nhis return home everything seemed to go contrary to his wishes.\r\n\r\nIt was five minutes to five, and he expected the dinner to be served at\r\nonce, but he was told it was not ready. He banged the door and went to\r\nhis study. Somebody knocked at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought; and shouted,--\xe2\x80\x9cWho is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened and a boy of fifteen came in, the son of Fedor\r\nMihailovich, a pupil of the fifth class of the local school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the first of the month to-day, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! You want your money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that the father should pay his son a monthly\r\nallowance of three roubles as pocket money. Fedor Mihailovich frowned,\r\ntook out of his pocket-book a coupon of two roubles fifty kopeks which\r\nhe found among the bank-notes, and added to it fifty kopeks in silver\r\nout of the loose change in his purse. The boy kept silent, and did not\r\ntake the money his father proffered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, please give me some more in advance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not ask for it, but I have borrowed a small sum from a friend,\r\nand promised upon my word of honour to pay it off. My honour is dear to\r\nme, and that is why I want another three roubles. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like asking\r\nyou; but, please, father, give me another three roubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, father, but just for once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an allowance of three roubles and you ought to be content. I\r\nhad not fifty kopeks when I was your age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, all my comrades have much more. Petrov and Ivanitsky have fifty\r\nroubles a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I tell you that if you behave like them you will be a scoundrel.\r\nMind that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there to mind? You never understand my position. I shall be\r\ndisgraced if I don\xe2\x80\x99t pay my debt. It is all very well for you to speak\r\nas you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe off, you silly boy! Be off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFedor Mihailovich jumped from his seat and pounced upon his son. \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\noff, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou deserve a good thrashing, all you boys!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis son was at once frightened and embittered. The bitterness was even\r\ngreater than the fright. With his head bent down he hastily turned to\r\nthe door. Fedor Mihailovich did not intend to strike him, but he was\r\nglad to vent his wrath, and went on shouting and abusing the boy till he\r\nhad closed the door.\r\n\r\nWhen the maid came in to announce that dinner was ready, Fedor\r\nMihailovich rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel hungry any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to the dining-room with a sullen face. At table his wife made\r\nsome remark, but he gave her such a short and angry answer that she\r\nabstained from further speech. The son also did not lift his eyes from\r\nhis plate, and was silent all the time. The trio finished their dinner\r\nin silence, rose from the table and separated, without a word.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the boy went to his room, took the coupon and the change\r\nout of his pocket, and threw the money on the table. After that he took\r\noff his uniform and put on a jacket.\r\n\r\nHe sat down to work, and began to study Latin grammar out of a\r\ndog\xe2\x80\x99s-eared book. After a while he rose, closed and bolted the door,\r\nshifted the money into a drawer, took out some cigarette papers, rolled\r\none up, stuffed it with cotton wool, and began to smoke.\r\n\r\nHe spent nearly two hours over his grammar and writing books without\r\nunderstanding a word of what he saw before him; then he rose and began\r\nto stamp up and down the room, trying to recollect all that his father\r\nhad said to him. All the abuse showered upon him, and worst of all his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s angry face, were as fresh in his memory as if he saw and heard\r\nthem all over again. \xe2\x80\x9cSilly boy! You ought to get a good thrashing!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthe more he thought of it the angrier he grew. He remembered also how\r\nhis father said: \xe2\x80\x9cI see what a scoundrel you will turn out. I know you\r\nwill. You are sure to become a cheat, if you go on like that.\xe2\x80\x9d He had\r\ncertainly forgotten how he felt when he was young! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat crime have I\r\ncommitted, I wonder? I wanted to go to the theatre, and having no money\r\nborrowed some from Petia Grouchetsky. Was that so very wicked of me?\r\nAnother father would have been sorry for me; would have asked how it all\r\nhappened; whereas he just called me names. He never thinks of anything\r\nbut himself. When it is he who has not got something he wants--that is a\r\ndifferent matter! Then all the house is upset by his shouts. And I--I am\r\na scoundrel, a cheat, he says. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t love him, although he is my\r\nfather. It may be wrong, but I hate him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. The servant brought a letter--a message\r\nfrom his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want an answer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the servant.\r\n\r\nThe letter ran as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cI ask you now for the third time to pay me\r\nback the six roubles you have borrowed; you are trying to avoid me. That\r\nis not the way an honest man ought to behave. Will you please send the\r\namount by my messenger? I am myself in a frightful fix. Can you not get\r\nthe money somewhere?--Yours, according to whether you send the money or\r\nnot, with scorn, or love, Grouchetsky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere we have it! Such a pig! Could he not wait a while? I will have\r\nanother try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitia went to his mother. This was his last hope. His mother was very\r\nkind, and hardly ever refused him anything. She would probably have\r\nhelped him this time also out of his trouble, but she was in great\r\nanxiety: her younger child, Petia, a boy of two, had fallen ill. She got\r\nangry with Mitia for rushing so noisily into the nursery, and refused\r\nhim almost without listening to what he had to say. Mitia muttered\r\nsomething to himself and turned to go. The mother felt sorry for him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, Mitia,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI have not got the money you want now, but I\r\nwill get it for you to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mitia was still raging against his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the use of having it to-morrow, when I want it to-day? I am\r\ngoing to see a friend. That is all I have got to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out, banging the door. . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else is left to me. He will tell me how to pawn my watch,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought, touching his watch in his pocket.\r\n\r\nMitia went to his room, took the coupon and the watch from the drawer,\r\nput on his coat, and went to Mahin.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMAHIN was his schoolfellow, his senior, a grown-up young man with a\r\nmoustache. He gambled, had a large feminine acquaintance, and always had\r\nready cash. He lived with his aunt. Mitia quite realised that Mahin was\r\nnot a respectable fellow, but when he was in his company he could not\r\nhelp doing what he wished. Mahin was in when Mitia called, and was just\r\npreparing to go to the theatre. His untidy room smelt of scented soap\r\nand eau-de-Cologne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awful, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahin, when Mitia telling him about his\r\ntroubles, showed the coupon and the fifty kopeks, and added that he\r\nwanted nine roubles more. \xe2\x80\x9cWe might, of course, go and pawn your watch.\r\nBut we might do something far better.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mahin winked an eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething quite simple.\xe2\x80\x9d Mahin took the coupon in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cPut ONE\r\nbefore the 2.50 and it will be 12.50.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do such coupons exist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly; the thousand roubles notes have coupons of 12.50. I\r\nhave cashed one in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes or no?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mahin, taking the pen and smoothing the coupon\r\nwith the fingers of his left hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mitia, and again his father\xe2\x80\x99s hard words\r\ncame back to his memory. \xe2\x80\x9cScoundrel! As you called me that, I might as\r\nwell be it.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked into Mahin\xe2\x80\x99s face. Mahin looked at him, smiling\r\nwith perfect ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahin carefully wrote the unit in front of 2.50.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let us go to the shop across the road; they sell photographers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmaterials there. I just happen to want a frame--for this young person\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d He took out of his pocket a photograph of a young lady with large\r\neyes, luxuriant hair, and an uncommonly well-developed bust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she not sweet? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes . . . of course . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see.--But let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahin took his coat, and they left the house.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE two boys, having rung the door-bell, entered the empty shop,\r\nwhich had shelves along the walls and photographic appliances on them,\r\ntogether with show-cases on the counters. A plain woman, with a kind\r\nface, came through the inner door and asked from behind the counter what\r\nthey required.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice frame, if you please, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what price?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the woman; she wore mittens on her swollen\r\nfingers with which she rapidly handled picture-frames of different\r\nshapes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are fifty kopeks each; and these are a little more expensive.\r\nThere is rather a pretty one, of quite a new style; one rouble and\r\ntwenty kopeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I will have this. But could not you make it cheaper? Let us\r\nsay one rouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t bargain in our shop,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopkeeper with a dignified\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will take it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahin, and put the coupon on the counter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrap up the frame and give me change. But please be quick. We must be\r\noff to the theatre, and it is getting late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have plenty of time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopkeeper, examining the coupon\r\nvery closely because of her shortsightedness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will look lovely in that frame, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahin,\r\nturning to Mitia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no small change?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the shop-woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, I have not. My father gave me that, so I have to cash it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you have one rouble twenty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only fifty kopeks in cash. But what are you afraid of? You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink, I suppose, that we want to cheat you and give you bad money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything of the sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better give it to me back. We will cash it somewhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much have I to pay you back? Eleven and something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a calculation on the counter, opened the desk, took out\r\na ten-roubles note, looked for change and added to the sum six\r\ntwenty-kopeks coins and two five-kopek pieces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease make a parcel of the frame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahin, taking the money in a\r\nleisurely fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d She made a parcel and tied it with a string.\r\n\r\nMitia only breathed freely when the door bell rang behind them, and they\r\nwere again in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are ten roubles for you, and let me have the rest. I will give it\r\nback to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahin went off to the theatre, and Mitia called on Grouchetsky to repay\r\nthe money he had borrowed from him.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAN hour after the boys were gone Eugene Mihailovich, the owner of the\r\nshop, came home, and began to count his receipts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you clumsy fool! Idiot that you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, addressing his\r\nwife, after having seen the coupon and noticed the forgery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have often seen you, Eugene, accepting coupons in payment, and\r\nprecisely twelve rouble ones,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted his wife, very humiliated,\r\ngrieved, and all but bursting into tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they\r\ncontrived to cheat me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were pupils of the school,\r\nin uniform. One of them was quite a handsome boy, and looked so comme il\r\nfaut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA comme il faut fool, that is what you are!\xe2\x80\x9d The husband went on\r\nscolding her, while he counted the cash. . . . When I accept coupons, I\r\nsee what is written on them. And you probably looked only at the boys\xe2\x80\x99\r\npretty faces. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better behave yourself in your old age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife could not stand this, and got into a fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is just like you men! Blaming everybody around you. But when it is\r\nyou who lose fifty-four roubles at cards--that is of no consequence in\r\nyour eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a different matter\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, and went to her room.\r\nThere she began to remind herself that her family was opposed to her\r\nmarriage, thinking her present husband far below her in social rank, and\r\nthat it was she who insisted on marrying him. Then she went on thinking\r\nof the child she had lost, and how indifferent her husband had been to\r\ntheir loss. She hated him so intensely at that moment that she wished\r\nfor his death. Her wish frightened her, however, and she hurriedly began\r\nto dress and left the house. When her husband came from the shop to the\r\ninner rooms of their flat she was gone. Without waiting for him she had\r\ndressed and gone off to friends--a teacher of French in the school, a\r\nRussified Pole, and his wife--who had invited her and her husband to a\r\nparty in their house that evening.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE guests at the party had tea and cakes offered to them, and sat down\r\nafter that to play whist at a number of card-tables.\r\n\r\nThe partners of Eugene Mihailovich\xe2\x80\x99s wife were the host himself, an\r\nofficer, and an old and very stupid lady in a wig, a widow who owned a\r\nmusic-shop; she loved playing cards and played remarkably well. But it\r\nwas Eugene Mihailovich\xe2\x80\x99s wife who was the winner all the time. The best\r\ncards were continually in her hands. At her side she had a plate with\r\ngrapes and a pear and was in the best of spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Eugene Mihailovich? Why is he so late?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the hostess, who\r\nplayed at another table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably busy settling accounts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugene Mihailovich\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nhas to pay off the tradesmen, to get in firewood.\xe2\x80\x9d The quarrel she had\r\nwith her husband revived in her memory; she frowned, and her hands, from\r\nwhich she had not taken off the mittens, shook with fury against him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there he is.--We have just been speaking of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hostess\r\nto Eugene Mihailovich, who came in at that very moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so\r\nlate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was busy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Eugene Mihailovich, in a gay voice, rubbing his\r\nhands. And to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s surprise he came to her side and said,--\xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow, I managed to get rid of the coupon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I used it to pay for a cartload of firewood I bought from a\r\npeasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Eugene Mihailovich related with great indignation to the company\r\npresent--his wife adding more details to his narrative--how his wife had\r\nbeen cheated by two unscrupulous schoolboys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and now let us sit down to work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking his place at\r\none of the whist-tables when his turn came, and beginning to shuffle the\r\ncards.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nEUGENE MIHAILOVICH had actually used the coupon to buy firewood from the\r\npeasant Ivan Mironov, who had thought of setting up in business on the\r\nseventeen roubles he possessed. He hoped in this way to earn another\r\neight roubles, and with the twenty-five roubles thus amassed he intended\r\nto buy a good strong horse, which he would want in the spring for work\r\nin the fields and for driving on the roads, as his old horse was almost\r\nplayed out.\r\n\r\nIvan Mironov\xe2\x80\x99s commercial method consisted in buying from the stores a\r\ncord of wood and dividing it into five cartloads, and then driving about\r\nthe town, selling each of these at the price the stores charged for\r\na quarter of a cord. That unfortunate day Ivan Mironov drove out very\r\nearly with half a cartload, which he soon sold. He loaded up again with\r\nanother cartload which he hoped to sell, but he looked in vain for a\r\ncustomer; no one would buy it. It was his bad luck all that day to come\r\nacross experienced towns-people, who knew all the tricks of the peasants\r\nin selling firewood, and would not believe that he had actually brought\r\nthe wood from the country as he assured them. He got hungry, and felt\r\ncold in his ragged woollen coat. It was nearly below zero when evening\r\ncame on; his horse which he had treated without mercy, hoping soon to\r\nsell it to the knacker\xe2\x80\x99s yard, refused to move a step. So Ivan Mironov\r\nwas quite ready to sell his firewood at a loss when he met Eugene\r\nMihailovich, who was on his way home from the tobacconist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuy my cartload of firewood, sir. I will give it to you cheap. My poor\r\nhorse is tired, and can\xe2\x80\x99t go any farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the country, sir. This firewood is from our place. Good dry wood,\r\nI can assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood wood indeed! I know your tricks. Well, what is your price?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIvan Mironov began by asking a high price, but reduced it once, and\r\nfinished by selling the cartload for just what it had cost him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m giving it to you cheap, just to please you, sir.--Besides, I am\r\nglad it is not a long way to your house,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nEugene Mihailovich did not bargain very much. He did not mind paying a\r\nlittle more, because he was delighted to think he could make use of the\r\ncoupon and get rid of it. With great difficulty Ivan Mironov managed\r\nat last, by pulling the shafts himself, to drag his cart into the\r\ncourtyard, where he was obliged to unload the firewood unaided and pile\r\nit up in the shed. The yard-porter was out. Ivan Mironov hesitated at\r\nfirst to accept the coupon, but Eugene Mihailovich insisted, and as he\r\nlooked a very important person the peasant at last agreed.\r\n\r\nHe went by the backstairs to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 room, crossed himself before\r\nthe ikon, wiped his beard which was covered with icicles, turned up the\r\nskirts of his coat, took out of his pocket a leather purse, and out\r\nof the purse eight roubles and fifty kopeks, and handed the change\r\nto Eugene Mihailovich. Carefully folding the coupon, he put it in the\r\npurse. Then, according to custom, he thanked the gentleman for his\r\nkindness, and, using the whip-handle instead of the lash, he belaboured\r\nthe half-frozen horse that he had doomed to an early death, and betook\r\nhimself to a public-house.\r\n\r\nArriving there, Ivan Mironov called for vodka and tea for which he paid\r\neight kopeks. Comfortable and warm after the tea, he chatted in the very\r\nbest of spirits with a yard-porter who was sitting at his table. Soon\r\nhe grew communicative and told his companion all about the conditions\r\nof his life. He told him he came from the village Vassilievsky, twelve\r\nmiles from town, and also that he had his allotment of land given to\r\nhim by his family, as he wanted to live apart from his father and his\r\nbrothers; that he had a wife and two children; the elder boy went to\r\nschool, and did not yet help him in his work. He also said he lived in\r\nlodgings and intended going to the horse-fair the next day to look for a\r\ngood horse, and, may be, to buy one. He went on to state that he had now\r\nnearly twenty-five roubles--only one rouble short--and that half of it\r\nwas a coupon. He took the coupon out of his purse to show to his new\r\nfriend. The yard-porter was an illiterate man, but he said he had had\r\nsuch coupons given him by lodgers to change; that they were good; but\r\nthat one might also chance on forged ones; so he advised the peasant,\r\nfor the sake of security, to change it at once at the counter. Ivan\r\nMironov gave the coupon to the waiter and asked for change. The waiter,\r\nhowever, did not bring the change, but came back with the manager, a\r\nbald-headed man with a shining face, who was holding the coupon in his\r\nfat hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour money is no good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, showing the coupon, but apparently\r\ndetermined not to give it back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coupon must be all right. I got it from a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is bad, I tell you. The coupon is forged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForged? Give it back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not. You fellows have got to be punished for such tricks. Of\r\ncourse, you did it yourself--you and some of your rascally friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the money. What right have you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSidor! Call a policeman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barman to the waiter. Ivan Mironov\r\nwas rather drunk, and in that condition was hard to manage. He seized\r\nthe manager by the collar and began to shout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me back my money, I say. I will go to the gentleman who gave it to\r\nme. I know where he lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manager had to struggle with all his force to get loose from Ivan\r\nMironov, and his shirt was torn,--\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way you behave! Get\r\nhold of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter took hold of Ivan Mironov; at that moment the policeman\r\narrived. Looking very important, he inquired what had happened, and\r\nunhesitatingly gave his orders:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him to the police-station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs to the coupon, the policeman put it in his pocket; Ivan Mironov,\r\ntogether with his horse, was brought to the nearest station.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIVAN MIRONOV had to spend the night in the police-station, in the\r\ncompany of drunkards and thieves. It was noon of the next day when he\r\nwas summoned to the police officer; put through a close examination,\r\nand sent in the care of a policeman to Eugene Mihailovich\xe2\x80\x99s shop. Ivan\r\nMironov remembered the street and the house.\r\n\r\nThe policeman asked for the shopkeeper, showed him the coupon and\r\nconfronted him with Ivan Mironov, who declared that he had received the\r\ncoupon in that very place. Eugene Mihailovich at once assumed a very\r\nsevere and astonished air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad, my good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen this man\r\nbefore in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing the policeman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sin, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan Mironov. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of the hour when you will\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you must be dreaming! You have sold your firewood to some one\r\nelse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugene Mihailovich. \xe2\x80\x9cBut wait a minute. I will go and ask my\r\nwife whether she bought any firewood yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d Eugene Mihailovich left\r\nthem and immediately called the yard-porter Vassily, a strong, handsome,\r\nquick, cheerful, well-dressed man.\r\n\r\nHe told Vassily that if any one should inquire where the last supply of\r\nfirewood was bought, he was to say they\xe2\x80\x99d got it from the stores, and\r\nnot from a peasant in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA peasant has come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Vassily, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has declared to the\r\npolice that I gave him a forged coupon. He is a fool and talks nonsense,\r\nbut you, are a clever man. Mind you say that we always get the firewood\r\nfrom the stores. And, by the way, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking some time of giving\r\nyou money to buy a new jacket,\xe2\x80\x9d added Eugene Mihailovich, and gave the\r\nman five roubles. Vassily looking with pleasure first at the five rouble\r\nnote, then at Eugene Mihailovich\xe2\x80\x99s face, shook his head and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, those peasant folks have no brains. Ignorance, of course. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou be uneasy. I know what I have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIvan Mironov, with tears in his eyes, implored Eugene Mihailovich over\r\nand over again to acknowledge the coupon he had given him, and the\r\nyard-porter to believe what he said, but it proved quite useless; they\r\nboth insisted that they had never bought firewood from a peasant in the\r\nstreet. The policeman brought Ivan Mironov back to the police-station,\r\nand he was charged with forging the coupon. Only after taking the advice\r\nof a drunken office clerk in the same cell with him, and bribing the\r\npolice officer with five roubles, did Ivan Mironov get out of jail,\r\nwithout the coupon, and with only seven roubles left out of the\r\ntwenty-five he had the day before.\r\n\r\nOf these seven roubles he spent three in the public-house and came home\r\nto his wife dead drunk, with a bruised and swollen face.\r\n\r\nHis wife was expecting a child, and felt very ill. She began to scold\r\nher husband; he pushed her away, and she struck him. Without answering a\r\nword he lay down on the plank and began to weep bitterly.\r\n\r\nNot till the next day did he tell his wife what had actually happened.\r\nShe believed him at once, and thoroughly cursed the dastardly rich man\r\nwho had cheated Ivan. He was sobered now, and remembering the advice\r\na workman had given him, with whom he had many a drink the day before,\r\ndecided to go to a lawyer and tell him of the wrong the owner of the\r\nphotograph shop had done him.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE lawyer consented to take proceedings on behalf of Ivan Mironov, not\r\nso much for the sake of the fee, as because he believed the peasant, and\r\nwas revolted by the wrong done to him.\r\n\r\nBoth parties appeared in the court when the case was tried, and the\r\nyard-porter Vassily was summoned as witness. They repeated in the court\r\nall they had said before to the police officials. Ivan Mironov again\r\ncalled to his aid the name of the Divinity, and reminded the shopkeeper\r\nof the hour of death. Eugene Mihailovich, although quite aware of his\r\nwickedness, and the risks he was running, despite the rebukes of his\r\nconscience, could not now change his testimony, and went on calmly to\r\ndeny all the allegations made against him.\r\n\r\nThe yard-porter Vassily had received another ten roubles from his\r\nmaster, and, quite unperturbed, asserted with a smile that he did not\r\nknow anything about Ivan Mironov. And when he was called upon to take\r\nthe oath, he overcame his inner qualms, and repeated with assumed ease\r\nthe terms of the oath, read to him by the old priest appointed to the\r\ncourt. By the holy Cross and the Gospel, he swore that he spoke the\r\nwhole truth.\r\n\r\nThe case was decided against Ivan Mironov, who was sentenced to pay five\r\nroubles for expenses. This sum Eugene Mihailovich generously paid for\r\nhim. Before dismissing Ivan Mironov, the judge severely admonished him,\r\nsaying he ought to take care in the future not to accuse respectable\r\npeople, and that he also ought to be thankful that he was not forced to\r\npay the costs, and that he had escaped a prosecution for slander, for\r\nwhich he would have been condemned to three months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offer my humble thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan Mironov; and, shaking his head,\r\nleft the court with a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing seemed to have ended well for Eugene Mihailovich and\r\nthe yard-porter Vassily. But only in appearance. Something had happened\r\nwhich was not noticed by any one, but which was much more important than\r\nall that had been exposed to view.\r\n\r\nVassily had left his village and settled in town over two years ago. As\r\ntime went on he sent less and less money to his father, and he did not\r\nask his wife, who remained at home, to join him. He was in no need of\r\nher; he could in town have as many wives as he wished, and much better\r\nones too than that clumsy, village-bred woman. Vassily, with each\r\nrecurring year, became more and more familiar with the ways of the town\r\npeople, forgetting the conventions of a country life. There everything\r\nwas so vulgar, so grey, so poor and untidy. Here, in town, all seemed on\r\nthe contrary so refined, nice, clean, and rich; so orderly too. And he\r\nbecame more and more convinced that people in the country live just like\r\nwild beasts, having no idea of what life is, and that only life in\r\ntown is real. He read books written by clever writers, and went to the\r\nperformances in the Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Palace. In the country, people would not\r\nsee such wonders even in dreams. In the country old men say: \xe2\x80\x9cObey the\r\nlaw, and live with your wife; work; don\xe2\x80\x99t eat too much; don\xe2\x80\x99t care for\r\nfinery,\xe2\x80\x9d while here, in town, all the clever and learned people--those,\r\nof course, who know what in reality the law is--only pursue their own\r\npleasures. And they are the better for it.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the incident of the forged coupon, Vassily could not\r\nactually believe that rich people lived without any moral law. But after\r\nthat, still more after having perjured himself, and not being the worse\r\nfor it in spite of his fears--on the contrary, he had gained ten roubles\r\nout of it--Vassily became firmly convinced that no moral laws whatever\r\nexist, and that the only thing to do is to pursue one\xe2\x80\x99s own interests\r\nand pleasures. This he now made his rule in life. He accordingly got as\r\nmuch profit as he could out of purchasing goods for lodgers. But this\r\ndid not pay all his expenses. Then he took to stealing, whenever chance\r\noffered--money and all sorts of valuables. One day he stole a purse full\r\nof money from Eugene Mihailovich, but was found out. Eugene Mihailovich\r\ndid not hand him over to the police, but dismissed him on the spot.\r\n\r\nVassily had no wish whatever to return home to his village, and remained\r\nin Moscow with his sweetheart, looking out for a new job. He got one as\r\nyard-porter at a grocer\xe2\x80\x99s, but with only small wages. The next day after\r\nhe had entered that service he was caught stealing bags. The grocer did\r\nnot call in the police, but gave him a good thrashing and turned him\r\nout. After that he could not find work. The money he had left was soon\r\ngone; he had to sell all his clothes and went about nearly in rags. His\r\nsweetheart left him. But notwithstanding, he kept up his high spirits,\r\nand when the spring came he started to walk home.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nPETER NIKOLAEVICH SVENTIZKY, a short man in black spectacles (he had\r\nweak eyes, and was threatened with complete blindness), got up, as was\r\nhis custom, at dawn of day, had a cup of tea, and putting on his short\r\nfur coat trimmed with astrachan, went to look after the work on his\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nPeter Nikolaevich had been an official in the Customs, and had gained\r\neighteen thousand roubles during his service. About twelve years ago he\r\nquitted the service--not quite of his own accord: as a matter of fact he\r\nhad been compelled to leave--and bought an estate from a young landowner\r\nwho had dissipated his fortune. Peter Nikolaevich had married at an\r\nearlier period, while still an official in the Customs. His wife, who\r\nbelonged to an old noble family, was an orphan, and was left without\r\nmoney. She was a tall, stoutish, good-looking woman. They had no\r\nchildren. Peter Nikolaevich had considerable practical talents and a\r\nstrong will. He was the son of a Polish gentleman, and knew nothing\r\nabout agriculture and land management; but when he acquired an estate of\r\nhis own, he managed it so well that after fifteen years the waste piece\r\nof land, consisting of three hundred acres, became a model estate. All\r\nthe buildings, from the dwelling-house to the corn stores and the shed\r\nfor the fire engine were solidly built, had iron roofs, and were painted\r\nat the right time. In the tool house carts, ploughs, harrows, stood in\r\nperfect order, the harness was well cleaned and oiled. The horses were\r\nnot very big, but all home-bred, grey, well fed, strong and devoid of\r\nblemish.\r\n\r\nThe threshing machine worked in a roofed barn, the forage was kept in\r\na separate shed, and a paved drain was made from the stables. The cows\r\nwere home-bred, not very large, but giving plenty of milk; fowls were\r\nalso kept in the poultry yard, and the hens were of a special kind,\r\nlaying a great quantity of eggs. In the orchard the fruit trees were\r\nwell whitewashed and propped on poles to enable them to grow straight.\r\nEverything was looked after--solid, clean, and in perfect order. Peter\r\nNikolaevich rejoiced in the perfect condition of his estate, and was\r\nproud to have achieved it--not by oppressing the peasants, but, on the\r\ncontrary, by the extreme fairness of his dealings with them.\r\n\r\nAmong the nobles of his province he belonged to the advanced party, and\r\nwas more inclined to liberal than conservative views, always taking the\r\nside of the peasants against those who were still in favour of serfdom.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTreat them well, and they will be fair to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say. Of\r\ncourse, he did not overlook any carelessness on the part of those who\r\nworked on his estate, and he urged them on to work if they were lazy;\r\nbut then he gave them good lodging, with plenty of good food, paid their\r\nwages without any delay, and gave them drinks on days of festival.\r\n\r\nWalking cautiously on the melting snow--for the time of the year was\r\nFebruary--Peter Nikolaevich passed the stables, and made his way to the\r\ncottage where his workmen were lodged. It was still dark, the darker\r\nbecause of the dense fog; but the windows of the cottage were lighted.\r\nThe men had already got up. His intention was to urge them to begin\r\nwork. He had arranged that they should drive out to the forest and bring\r\nback the last supply of firewood he needed before spring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, seeing the door of the stable wide open.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, who is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo answer. Peter Nikolaevich stepped into the stable. It was dark; the\r\nground was soft under his feet, and the air smelt of dung; on the right\r\nside of the door were two loose boxes for a pair of grey horses. Peter\r\nNikolaevich stretched out his hand in their direction--one box was\r\nempty. He put out his foot--the horse might have been lying down. But\r\nhis foot did not touch anything solid. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere could they have taken the\r\nhorse?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. They certainly had not harnessed it; all the sledges\r\nstood still outside. Peter Nikolaevich went out of the stable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStepan, come here!\xe2\x80\x9d he called.\r\n\r\nStepan was the head of the workmen\xe2\x80\x99s gang. He was just stepping out of\r\nthe cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a cheerful voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, is that you, Peter\r\nNikolaevich? Our men are coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is the stable door open?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it. I say, Proshka, bring the\r\nlantern!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProshka came with the lantern. They all went to the stable, and Stepan\r\nknew at once what had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThieves have been here, Peter Nikolaevich,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lock is\r\nbroken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the brigands! I don\xe2\x80\x99t see \xe2\x80\x98Mashka.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Hawk\xe2\x80\x99 is here. But \xe2\x80\x98Beauty\xe2\x80\x99\r\nis not. Nor yet \xe2\x80\x98Dapple-grey.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree horses had been stolen!\r\n\r\nPeter Nikolaevich did not utter a word at first. He only frowned and\r\ntook deep breaths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a while. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I could lay hands on them! Who was\r\non guard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter. He evidently fell asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter Nikolaevich called in the police, and making an appeal to all the\r\nauthorities, sent his men to track the thieves. But the horses were not\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWicked people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Nikolaevich. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could they! I was always\r\nso kind to them. Now, wait! Brigands! Brigands the whole lot of them. I\r\nwill no longer be kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIN the meanwhile the horses, the grey ones, had all been disposed of;\r\nMashka was sold to the gipsies for eighteen roubles; Dapple-grey was\r\nexchanged for another horse, and passed over to another peasant who\r\nlived forty miles away from the estate; and Beauty died on the way.\r\nThe man who conducted the whole affair was--Ivan Mironov. He had\r\nbeen employed on the estate, and knew all the whereabouts of Peter\r\nNikolaevich. He wanted to get back the money he had lost, and stole the\r\nhorses for that reason.\r\n\r\nAfter his misfortune with the forged coupon, Ivan Mironov took to drink;\r\nand all he possessed would have gone on drink if it had not been for his\r\nwife, who locked up his clothes, the horses\xe2\x80\x99 collars, and all the rest\r\nof what he would otherwise have squandered in public-houses. In his\r\ndrunken state Ivan Mironov was continually thinking, not only of the man\r\nwho had wronged him, but of all the rich people who live on robbing\r\nthe poor. One day he had a drink with some peasants from the suburbs\r\nof Podolsk, and was walking home together with them. On the way the\r\npeasants, who were completely drunk, told him they had stolen a horse\r\nfrom a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. Ivan Mironov got angry, and began to abuse the\r\nhorse-thieves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shame!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA horse is like a brother to the peasant. And\r\nyou robbed him of it? It is a great sin, I tell you. If you go in for\r\nstealing horses, steal them from the landowners. They are worse than\r\ndogs, and deserve anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe talk went on, and the peasants from Podolsk told him that it\r\nrequired a great deal of cunning to steal a horse on an estate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know all the ins and outs of the place, and must have somebody\r\non the spot to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to Ivan Mironov that he knew a landowner--Sventizky;\r\nhe had worked on his estate, and Sventizky, when paying him off, had\r\ndeducted one rouble and a half for a broken tool. He remembered well the\r\ngrey horses which he used to drive at Sventizky\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nIvan Mironov called on Peter Nikolaevich pretending to ask for\r\nemployment, but really in order to get the information he wanted. He\r\ntook precautions to make sure that the watchman was absent, and that\r\nthe horses were standing in their boxes in the stable. He brought the\r\nthieves to the place, and helped them to carry off the three horses.\r\n\r\nThey divided their gains, and Ivan Mironov returned to his wife with\r\nfive roubles in his pocket. He had nothing to do at home, having no\r\nhorse to work in the field, and therefore continued to steal horses in\r\ncompany with professional horse-thieves and gipsies.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nPETER NIKOLAEVICH SVENTIZKY did his best to discover who had stolen his\r\nhorses. He knew somebody on the estate must have helped the thieves,\r\nand began to suspect all his staff. He inquired who had slept out that\r\nnight, and the gang of the working men told him Proshka had not been in\r\nthe whole night. Proshka, or Prokofy Nikolaevich, was a young fellow who\r\nhad just finished his military service, handsome, and skilful in all he\r\ndid; Peter Nikolaevich employed him at times as coachman. The district\r\nconstable was a friend of Peter Nikolaevich, as were the provincial\r\nhead of the police, the marshal of the nobility, and also the rural\r\ncouncillor and the examining magistrate. They all came to his house\r\non his saint\xe2\x80\x99s day, drinking the cherry brandy he offered them with\r\npleasure, and eating the nice preserved mushrooms of all kinds to\r\naccompany the liqueurs. They all sympathised with him in his trouble and\r\ntried to help him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always used to take the side of the peasants,\xe2\x80\x9d said the district\r\nconstable, \xe2\x80\x9cand there you are! I was right in saying they are worse than\r\nwild beasts. Flogging is the only way to keep them in order. Well,\r\nyou say it is all Proshka\xe2\x80\x99s doings. Is it not he who was your coachman\r\nsometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you kindly call him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProshka was summoned before the constable, who began to examine him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere were you that night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProshka pushed back his hair, and his eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so? All the men say you were not in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please, your honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy pleasure has nothing to do with the matter. Tell me where you were\r\nthat night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Policeman, bring him to the police-station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reason why Proshka did not say where he had been that night was that\r\nhe had spent it with his sweetheart, Parasha, and had promised not to\r\ngive her away. He kept his word. No proofs were discovered against him,\r\nand he was soon discharged. But Peter Nikolaevich was convinced that\r\nProkofy had been at the bottom of the whole affair, and began to hate\r\nhim. One day Proshka bought as usual at the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s two measures of\r\noats. One and a half he gave to the horses, and half a measure he\r\ngave back to the merchant; the money for it he spent in drink. Peter\r\nNikolaevich found it out, and charged Prokofy with cheating. The judge\r\nsentenced the man to three months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.\r\n\r\nProkofy had a rather proud nature, and thought himself superior to\r\nothers. Prison was a great humiliation for him. He came out of it very\r\ndepressed; there was nothing more to be proud of in life. And more than\r\nthat, he felt extremely bitter, not only against Peter Nikolaevich, but\r\nagainst the whole world.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, as all the people around him noticed, Prokofy became\r\nanother man after his imprisonment, both careless and lazy; he took to\r\ndrink, and he was soon caught stealing clothes at some woman\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nand found himself again in prison.\r\n\r\nAll that Peter Nikolaevich discovered about his grey horses was the hide\r\nof one of them, Beauty, which had been found somewhere on the estate.\r\nThe fact that the thieves had got off scot-free irritated Peter\r\nNikolaevich still more. He was unable now to speak of the peasants or\r\nto look at them without anger. And whenever he could he tried to oppress\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nAFTER having got rid of the coupon, Eugene Mihailovich forgot all about\r\nit; but his wife, Maria Vassilievna, could not forgive herself for\r\nhaving been taken in, nor yet her husband for his cruel words. And most\r\nof all she was furious against the two boys who had so skilfully cheated\r\nher. From the day she had accepted the forged coupon as payment, she\r\nlooked closely at all the schoolboys who came in her way in the streets.\r\nOne day she met Mahin, but did not recognise him, for on seeing her\r\nhe made a face which quite changed his features. But when, a fortnight\r\nafter the incident with the coupon, she met Mitia Smokovnikov face to\r\nface, she knew him at once.\r\n\r\nShe let him pass her, then turned back and followed him, and arriving\r\nat his house she made inquiries as to whose son he was. The next day she\r\nwent to the school and met the divinity instructor, the priest Michael\r\nVedensky, in the hall. He asked her what she wanted. She answered that\r\nshe wished to see the head of the school. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not quite well,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe priest. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I be of any use to you, or give him your message?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria Vassilievna thought that she might as well tell the priest what\r\nwas the matter. Michael Vedensky was a widower, and a very ambitious\r\nman. A year ago he had met Mitia Smokovnikov\xe2\x80\x99s father in society, and\r\nhad had a discussion with him on religion. Smokovnikov had beaten\r\nhim decisively on all points; indeed, he had made him appear quite\r\nridiculous. Since that time the priest had decided to pay special\r\nattention to Smokovnikov\xe2\x80\x99s son; and, finding him as indifferent to\r\nreligious matters as his father was, he began to persecute him, and even\r\nbrought about his failure in examinations.\r\n\r\nWhen Maria Vassilievna told him what young Smokovnikov had done to her,\r\nVedensky could not help feeling an inner satisfaction. He saw in the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s conduct a proof of the utter wickedness of those who are not\r\nguided by the rules of the Church. He decided to take advantage of this\r\ngreat opportunity of warning unbelievers of the perils that threatened\r\nthem. At all events, he wanted to persuade himself that this was the\r\nonly motive that guided him in the course he had resolved to take. But\r\nat the bottom of his heart he was only anxious to get his revenge on the\r\nproud atheist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is very sad indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Michael, toying with the cross\r\nhe was wearing over his priestly robes, and passing his hands over its\r\npolished sides. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad you have given me your confidence. As a\r\nservant of the Church I shall admonish the young man--of course with the\r\nutmost kindness. I shall certainly do it in the way that befits my holy\r\noffice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Michael to himself, really thinking that he had\r\nforgotten the ill-feeling the boy\xe2\x80\x99s father had towards him. He firmly\r\nbelieved the boy\xe2\x80\x99s soul to be the only object of his pious care.\r\n\r\nThe next day, during the divinity lesson which Father Michael was giving\r\nto Mitia Smokovnikov\xe2\x80\x99s class, he narrated the incident of the forged\r\ncoupon, adding that the culprit had been one of the pupils of the\r\nschool. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very wicked thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut to deny the\r\ncrime is still worse. If it is true that the sin has been committed by\r\none of you, let the guilty one confess.\xe2\x80\x9d In saying this, Father Michael\r\nlooked sharply at Mitia Smokovnikov. All the boys, following his glance,\r\nturned also to Mitia, who blushed, and felt extremely ill at ease, with\r\nlarge beads of perspiration on his face. Finally, he burst into tears,\r\nand ran out of the classroom. His mother, noticing his trouble, found\r\nout the truth, ran at once to the photographer\xe2\x80\x99s shop, paid over the\r\ntwelve roubles and fifty kopeks to Maria Vassilievna, and made her\r\npromise to deny the boy\xe2\x80\x99s guilt. She further implored Mitia to hide the\r\ntruth from everybody, and in any case to withhold it from his father.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when Fedor Mihailovich had heard of the incident in\r\nthe divinity class, and his son, questioned by him, had denied all\r\naccusations, he called at once on the head of the school, told him what\r\nhad happened, expressed his indignation at Father Michael\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, and\r\nsaid he would not let matters remain as they were.\r\n\r\nFather Michael was sent for, and immediately fell into a hot dispute\r\nwith Smokovnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stupid woman first falsely accused my son, then retracts her\r\naccusation, and you of course could not hit on anything more sensible to\r\ndo than to slander an honest and truthful boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not slander him, and I must beg you not to address me in such a\r\nway. You forget what is due to my cloth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cloth is of no consequence to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour perversity in matters of religion is known to everybody in the\r\ntown!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Father Michael; and he was so transported with anger that\r\nhis long thin head quivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen! Father Michael!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the director of the school,\r\ntrying to appease their wrath. But they did not listen to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my duty as a priest to look after the religious and moral\r\neducation of our pupils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, cease your pretence to be religious! Oh, stop all this humbug\r\nof religion! As if I did not know that you believe neither in God nor\r\nDevil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consider it beneath my dignity to talk to a man like you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFather Michael, very much hurt by Smokovnikov\xe2\x80\x99s last words, the more so\r\nbecause he knew they were true.\r\n\r\nMichael Vedensky carried on his studies in the academy for priests,\r\nand that is why, for a long time past, he ceased to believe in what he\r\nconfessed to be his creed and in what he preached from the pulpit; he\r\nonly knew that men ought to force themselves to believe in what he tried\r\nto make himself believe.\r\n\r\nSmokovnikov was not shocked by Father Michael\xe2\x80\x99s conduct; he only thought\r\nit illustrative of the influence the Church was beginning to exercise\r\non society, and he told all his friends how his son had been insulted by\r\nthe priest.\r\n\r\nSeeing not only young minds, but also the elder generation, contaminated\r\nby atheistic tendencies, Father Michael became more and more convinced\r\nof the necessity of fighting those tendencies. The more he condemned the\r\nunbelief of Smokovnikov, and those like him, the more confident he\r\ngrew in the firmness of his own faith, and the less he felt the need\r\nof making sure of it, or of bringing his life into harmony with it. His\r\nfaith, acknowledged as such by all the world around him, became Father\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s very best weapon with which to fight those who denied it.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts aroused in him by his conflict with Smokovnikov, together\r\nwith the annoyance of being blamed by his chiefs in the school, made him\r\ncarry out the purpose he had entertained ever since his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death--of\r\ntaking monastic orders, and of following the course carried out by some\r\nof his fellow-pupils in the academy. One of them was already a bishop,\r\nanother an archimandrite and on the way to become a bishop.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the term Michael Vedensky gave up his post in the school,\r\ntook orders under the name of Missael, and very soon got a post as\r\nrector in a seminary in a town on the river Volga.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE the yard-porter Vassily was marching on the open road down to\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nHe walked in daytime, and when night came some policeman would get\r\nhim shelter in a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. He was given bread everywhere, and\r\nsometimes he was asked to sit down to the evening meal. In a village in\r\nthe Orel district, where he had stayed for the night, he heard that\r\na merchant who had hired the landowner\xe2\x80\x99s orchard for the season,\r\nwas looking out for strong and able men to serve as watchmen for the\r\nfruit-crops. Vassily was tired of tramping, and as he had also no desire\r\nwhatever to go back to his native village, he went to the man who owned\r\nthe orchard, and got engaged as watchman for five roubles a month.\r\n\r\nVassily found it very agreeable to live in his orchard shed, and all the\r\nmore so when the apples and pears began to grow ripe, and when the men\r\nfrom the barn supplied him every day with large bundles of fresh straw\r\nfrom the threshing machine. He used to lie the whole day long on the\r\nfragrant straw, with fresh, delicately smelling apples in heaps at his\r\nside, looking out in every direction to prevent the village boys from\r\nstealing fruit; and he used to whistle and sing meanwhile, to amuse\r\nhimself. He knew no end of songs, and had a fine voice. When peasant\r\nwomen and young girls came to ask for apples, and to have a chat with\r\nhim, Vassily gave them larger or smaller apples according as he liked\r\ntheir looks, and received eggs or money in return. The rest of the time\r\nhe had nothing to do, but to lie on his back and get up for his meals\r\nin the kitchen. He had only one shirt left, one of pink cotton, and that\r\nwas in holes. But he was strongly built and enjoyed excellent health.\r\nWhen the kettle with black gruel was taken from the stove and served to\r\nthe working men, Vassily used to eat enough for three, and filled the\r\nold watchman on the estate with unceasing wonder. At nights Vassily\r\nnever slept. He whistled or shouted from time to time to keep off\r\nthieves, and his piercing, cat-like eyes saw clearly in the darkness.\r\n\r\nOne night a company of young lads from the village made their way\r\nstealthily to the orchard to shake down apples from the trees. Vassily,\r\ncoming noiselessly from behind, attacked them; they tried to escape, but\r\nhe took one of them prisoner to his master.\r\n\r\nVassily\xe2\x80\x99s first shed stood at the farthest end of the orchard, but after\r\nthe pears had been picked he had to remove to another shed only forty\r\npaces away from the house of his master. He liked this new place very\r\nmuch. The whole day long he could see the young ladies and gentlemen\r\nenjoying themselves; going out for drives in the evenings and quite late\r\nat nights, playing the piano or the violin, and singing and dancing.\r\nHe saw the ladies sitting with the young students on the window sills,\r\nengaged in animated conversation, and then going in pairs to walk the\r\ndark avenue of lime trees, lit up only by streaks of moonlight. He saw\r\nthe servants running about with food and drink, he saw the cooks, the\r\nstewards, the laundresses, the gardeners, the coachmen, hard at work\r\nto supply their masters with food and drink and constant amusement.\r\nSometimes the young people from the master\xe2\x80\x99s house came to the shed,\r\nand Vassily offered them the choicest apples, juicy and red. The young\r\nladies used to take large bites out of the apples on the spot, praising\r\ntheir taste, and spoke French to one another--Vassily quite understood\r\nit was all about him--and asked Vassily to sing for them.\r\n\r\nVassily felt the greatest admiration for his master\xe2\x80\x99s mode of living,\r\nwhich reminded him of what he had seen in Moscow; and he became more and\r\nmore convinced that the only thing that mattered in life was money.\r\nHe thought and thought how to get hold of a large sum of money. He\r\nremembered his former ways of making small profits whenever he could,\r\nand came to the conclusion that that was altogether wrong. Occasional\r\nstealing is of no use, he thought. He must arrange a well-prepared plan,\r\nand after getting all the information he wanted, carry out his purpose\r\nso as to avoid detection.\r\n\r\nAfter the feast of Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the last crop\r\nof autumn apples was gathered; the master was content with the results,\r\npaid off Vassily, and gave him an extra sum as reward for his faithful\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nVassily put on his new jacket, and a new hat--both were presents from\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s son--but did not make his way homewards. He hated the very\r\nthought of the vulgar peasants\xe2\x80\x99 life. He went back to Moscow in company\r\nof some drunken soldiers, who had been watchmen in the orchard together\r\nwith him. On his arrival there he at once resolved, under cover of\r\nnight, to break into the shop where he had been employed, and beaten,\r\nand then turned out by the proprietor without being paid. He knew the\r\nplace well, and knew where the money was locked up. So he bade the\r\nsoldiers, who helped him, keep watch outside, and forcing the courtyard\r\ndoor entered the shop and took all the money he could lay his hands on.\r\nAll this was done very cleverly, and no trace was left of the burglary.\r\nThe money Vassily had found in the shop amounted to 370 roubles. He gave\r\na hundred roubles to his assistants, and with the rest left for another\r\ntown where he gave way to dissipation in company of friends of both\r\nsexes. The police traced his movements, and when at last he was arrested\r\nand put into prison he had hardly anything left out of the money which\r\nhe had stolen.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nIVAN MIRONOV had become a very clever, fearless and successful\r\nhorse-thief. Afimia, his wife, who at first used to abuse him for his\r\nevil ways, as she called it, was now quite content and felt proud of her\r\nhusband, who possessed a new sheepskin coat, while she also had a warm\r\njacket and a new fur cloak.\r\n\r\nIn the village and throughout the whole district every one knew quite\r\nwell that Ivan Mironov was at the bottom of all the horse-stealing; but\r\nnobody would give him away, being afraid of the consequences. Whenever\r\nsuspicion fell on him, he managed to clear his character. Once during\r\nthe night he stole horses from the pasture ground in the village\r\nKolotovka. He generally preferred to steal horses from landowners or\r\ntradespeople. But this was a harder job, and when he had no chance of\r\nsuccess he did not mind robbing peasants too. In Kolotovka he drove off\r\nthe horses without making sure whose they were. He did not go himself\r\nto the spot, but sent a young and clever fellow, Gerassim, to do the\r\nstealing for him. The peasants only got to know of the theft at dawn;\r\nthey rushed in all directions to hunt for the robbers. The horses,\r\nmeanwhile, were hidden in a ravine in the forest lands belonging to the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIvan Mironov intended to leave them there till the following night, and\r\nthen to transport them with the utmost haste a hundred miles away to\r\na man he knew. He visited Gerassim in the forest, to see how he was\r\ngetting on, brought him a pie and some vodka, and was returning home\r\nby a side track in the forest where he hoped to meet nobody. But by\r\nill-luck, he chanced on the keeper of the forest, a retired soldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say! Have you been looking for mushrooms?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the soldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were none to be found,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ivan Mironov, showing the basket\r\nof lime bark he had taken with him in case he might want it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mushrooms are scarce this summer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier. He stood\r\nstill for a moment, pondered, and then went his way. He clearly saw that\r\nsomething was wrong. Ivan Mironov had no business whatever to take early\r\nmorning walks in that forest. The soldier went back after a while and\r\nlooked round. Suddenly he heard the snorting of horses in the ravine. He\r\nmade his way cautiously to the place whence the sounds came. The grass\r\nin the ravine was trodden down, and the marks of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs were\r\nclearly to be seen. A little further he saw Gerassim, who was sitting\r\nand eating his meal, and the horses tied to a tree.\r\n\r\nThe soldier ran to the village and brought back the bailiff, a police\r\nofficer, and two witnesses. They surrounded on three sides the spot\r\nwhere Gerassim was sitting and seized the man. He did not deny anything;\r\nbut, being drunk, told them at once how Ivan Mironov had given him\r\nplenty of drink, and induced him to steal the horses; he also said that\r\nIvan Mironov had promised to come that night in order to take the horses\r\naway. The peasants left the horses and Gerassim in the ravine, and\r\nhiding behind the trees prepared to lie in ambush for Ivan Mironov. When\r\nit grew dark, they heard a whistle. Gerassim answered it with a similar\r\nsound. The moment Ivan Mironov descended the slope, the peasants\r\nsurrounded him and brought him back to the village. The next morning\r\na crowd assembled in front of the bailiff\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. Ivan Mironov was\r\nbrought out and subjected to a close examination. Stepan Pelageushkine,\r\na tall, stooping man with long arms, an aquiline nose, and a gloomy\r\nface was the first to put questions to him. Stepan had terminated\r\nhis military service, and was of a solitary turn of mind. When he had\r\nseparated from his father, and started his own home, he had his first\r\nexperience of losing a horse. After that he worked for two years in\r\nthe mines, and made money enough to buy two horses. These two had been\r\nstolen by Ivan Mironov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me where my horses are!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Stepan, pale with fury,\r\nalternately looking at the ground and at Ivan Mironov\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nIvan Mironov denied his guilt. Then Stepan aimed so violent a blow at\r\nhis face that he smashed his nose and the blood spurted out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell the truth, I say, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIvan Mironov kept silent, trying to avoid the blows by stooping. Stepan\r\nhit him twice more with his long arm. Ivan Mironov remained silent,\r\nturning his head backwards and forwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeat him, all of you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the bailiff, and the whole crowd rushed\r\nupon Ivan Mironov. He fell without a word to the ground, and then\r\nshouted,--\xe2\x80\x9cDevils, wild beasts, kill me if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want! I am\r\nnot afraid of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStepan seized a stone out of those that had been collected for the\r\npurpose, and with a heavy blow smashed Ivan Mironov\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nIVAN MIRONOV\xe2\x80\x99S murderers were brought to trial, Stepan Pelageushkine\r\namong them. He had a heavier charge to answer than the others, all the\r\nwitnesses having stated that it was he who had smashed Ivan Mironov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead with a stone. Stepan concealed nothing when in court. He contented\r\nhimself with explaining that, having been robbed of his two last horses,\r\nhe had informed the police. Now it was comparatively easy at that time\r\nto trace the horses with the help of professional thieves among the\r\ngipsies. But the police officer would not even permit him, and no search\r\nhad been ordered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else could be done with such a man. He has ruined us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did not the others attack him. It was you alone who broke his\r\nhead open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is false. We all fell upon him. The village agreed to kill him.\r\nI only gave the final stroke. What is the use of inflicting unnecessary\r\nsufferings on a man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judges were astonished at Stepan\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful coolness in narrating\r\nthe story of his crime--how the peasants fell upon Ivan Mironov, and\r\nhow he had given the final stroke. Stepan actually did not see anything\r\nparticularly revolting in this murder. During his military service\r\nhe had been ordered on one occasion to shoot a soldier, and, now with\r\nregard to Ivan Mironov, he saw nothing loathsome in it. \xe2\x80\x9cA man shot is\r\na dead man--that\xe2\x80\x99s all. It was him to-day, it might be me to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought. Stepan was only sentenced to one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment, which was\r\na mild punishment for what he had done. His peasant\xe2\x80\x99s dress was taken\r\naway from him and put in the prison stores, and he had a prison suit and\r\nfelt boots given to him instead. Stepan had never had much respect for\r\nthe authorities, but now he became quite convinced that all the chiefs,\r\nall the fine folk, all except the Czar--who alone had pity on the\r\npeasants and was just--all were robbers who suck blood out of the\r\npeople. All he heard from the deported convicts, and those sentenced to\r\nhard labour, with whom he had made friends in prisons, confirmed him\r\nin his views. One man had been sentenced to hard labour for having\r\nconvicted his superiors of a theft; another for having struck an\r\nofficial who had unjustly confiscated the property of a peasant; a third\r\nbecause he forged bank notes. The well-to-do-people, the merchants,\r\nmight do whatever they chose and come to no harm; but a poor peasant,\r\nfor a trumpery reason or for none at all, was sent to prison to become\r\nfood for vermin.\r\n\r\nHe had visits from his wife while in prison. Her life without him was\r\nmiserable enough, when, to make it worse, her cottage was destroyed by\r\nfire. She was completely ruined, and had to take to begging with her\r\nchildren. His wife\xe2\x80\x99s misery embittered Stepan still more. He got on very\r\nbadly with all the people in the prison; was rude to every one; and\r\none day he nearly killed the cook with an axe, and therefore got an\r\nadditional year in prison. In the course of that year he received the\r\nnews that his wife was dead, and that he had no longer a home.\r\n\r\nWhen Stepan had finished his time in prison, he was taken to the prison\r\nstores, and his own dress was taken down from the shelf and handed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I to go now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the prison officer, putting on his old\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no home. I shall have to go on the road. Robbery will not be a\r\npleasant occupation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case you will soon be back here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Stepan left the prison. Nevertheless he took the road to his own\r\nplace. He had nowhere else to turn.\r\n\r\nOn his way he stopped for a night\xe2\x80\x99s rest in an inn that had a public bar\r\nattached to it. The inn was kept by a fat man from the town, Vladimir,\r\nand he knew Stepan. He knew that Stepan had been put into prison through\r\nill luck, and did not mind giving him shelter for the night. He was a\r\nrich man, and had persuaded his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s wife to leave her husband\r\nand come to live with him. She lived in his house as his wife, and\r\nhelped him in his business as well.\r\n\r\nStepan knew all about the innkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s affairs--how he had wronged the\r\npeasant, and how the woman who was living with him had left her husband.\r\nHe saw her now sitting at the table in a rich dress, and looking very\r\nhot as she drank her tea. With great condescension she asked Stepan to\r\nhave tea with her. No other travellers were stopping in the inn that\r\nnight. Stepan was given a place in the kitchen where he might sleep.\r\nMatrena--that was the woman\xe2\x80\x99s name--cleared the table and went to her\r\nroom. Stepan went to lie down on the large stove in the kitchen, but\r\nhe could not sleep, and the wood splinters put on the stove to dry were\r\ncrackling under him, as he tossed from side to side. He could not help\r\nthinking of his host\xe2\x80\x99s fat paunch protruding under the belt of his\r\nshirt, which had lost its colour from having been washed ever so many\r\ntimes. Would not it be a good thing to make a good clean incision in\r\nthat paunch. And that woman, too, he thought.\r\n\r\nOne moment he would say to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI had better go from here\r\nto-morrow, bother them all!\xe2\x80\x9d But then again Ivan Mironov came back\r\nto his mind, and he went on thinking of the innkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s paunch and\r\nMatrena\xe2\x80\x99s white throat bathed in perspiration. \xe2\x80\x9cKill I must, and it must\r\nbe both!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe heard the cock crow for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do it at once, or dawn will be here.\xe2\x80\x9d He had seen in the evening\r\nbefore he went to bed a knife and an axe. He crawled down from the\r\nstove, took the knife and axe, and went out of the kitchen door. At that\r\nvery moment he heard the lock of the entrance door open. The innkeeper\r\nwas going out of the house to the courtyard. It all turned out contrary\r\nto what Stepan desired. He had no opportunity of using the knife;\r\nhe just swung the axe and split the innkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s head in two. The man\r\ntumbled down on the threshold of the door, then on the ground.\r\n\r\nStepan stepped into the bedroom. Matrena jumped out of bed, and remained\r\nstanding by its side. With the same axe Stepan killed her also.\r\n\r\nThen he lighted the candle, took the money out of the desk, and left the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nIN a small district town, some distance away from the other buildings,\r\nan old man, a former official, who had taken to drink, lived in his own\r\nhouse with his two daughters and his son-in-law. The married daughter\r\nwas also addicted to drink and led a bad life, and it was the elder\r\ndaughter, the widow Maria Semenovna, a wrinkled woman of fifty, who\r\nsupported the whole family. She had a pension of two hundred and fifty\r\nroubles a year, and the family lived on this. Maria Semenovna did all\r\nthe work in the house, looked after the drunken old father, who was very\r\nweak, attended to her sister\xe2\x80\x99s child, and managed all the cooking and\r\nthe washing of the family. And, as is always the case, whatever there\r\nwas to do, she was expected to do it, and was, moreover, continually\r\nscolded by all the three people in the house; her brother-in-law used\r\neven to beat her when he was drunk. She bore it all patiently, and as\r\nis also always the case, the more work she had to face, the quicker\r\nshe managed to get through it. She helped the poor, sacrificing her own\r\nwants; she gave them her clothes, and was a ministering angel to the\r\nsick.\r\n\r\nOnce the lame, crippled village tailor was working in Maria Semenovna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. He had to mend her old father\xe2\x80\x99s coat, and to mend and repair\r\nMaria Semenovna\xe2\x80\x99s fur-jacket for her to wear in winter when she went to\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe lame tailor was a clever man, and a keen observer: he had seen many\r\ndifferent people owing to his profession, and was fond of reflection,\r\ncondemned as he was to a sedentary life.\r\n\r\nHaving worked a week at Maria Semenovna\xe2\x80\x99s, he wondered greatly about\r\nher life. One day she came to the kitchen, where he was sitting with his\r\nwork, to wash a towel, and began to ask him how he was getting on. He\r\ntold her of the wrong he had suffered from his brother, and how he now\r\nlived on his own allotment of land, separated from that of his brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I should have been better off that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am\r\nnow just as poor as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is much better never to change, but to take life as it comes,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMaria Semenovna. \xe2\x80\x9cTake life as it comes,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I wonder at you, Maria Semenovna,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lame tailor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nalone do the work, and you are so good to everybody. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrepay you in kind, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria Semenovna did not utter a word in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you have found out in books that we are rewarded in heaven\r\nfor the good we do here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know that. But we must try to do the best we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it said so in books?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn books as well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and read to him the Sermon on the Mount.\r\nThe tailor was much impressed. When he had been paid for his job and\r\ngone home, he did not cease to think about Maria Semenovna, both what\r\nshe had said and what she had read to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nPETER NIKOLAEVICH SVENTIZKY\xe2\x80\x99S views of the peasantry had now changed for\r\nthe worse, and the peasants had an equally bad opinion of him. In the\r\ncourse of a single year they felled twenty-seven oaks in his forest, and\r\nburnt a barn which had not been insured. Peter Nikolaevich came to the\r\nconclusion that there was no getting on with the people around him.\r\n\r\nAt that very time the landowner, Liventsov, was trying to find a manager\r\nfor his estate, and the Marshal of the Nobility recommended Peter\r\nNikolaevich as the ablest man in the district in the management of land.\r\nThe estate owned by Liventsov was an extremely large one, but there was\r\nno revenue to be got out of it, as the peasants appropriated all\r\nits wealth to their own profit. Peter Nikolaevich undertook to bring\r\neverything into order; rented out his own land to somebody else; and\r\nsettled with his wife on the Liventsov estate, in a distant province on\r\nthe river Volga.\r\n\r\nPeter Nikolaevich was always fond of order, and wanted things to be\r\nregulated by law; and now he felt less able of allowing those raw and\r\nrude peasants to take possession, quite illegally too, of property that\r\ndid not belong to them. He was glad of the opportunity of giving them a\r\ngood lesson, and set seriously to work at once. One peasant was sent to\r\nprison for stealing wood; to another he gave a thrashing for not having\r\nmade way for him on the road with his cart, and for not having lifted\r\nhis cap to salute him. As to the pasture ground which was a subject of\r\ndispute, and was considered by the peasants as their property, Peter\r\nNikolaevich informed the peasants that any of their cattle grazing on it\r\nwould be driven away by him.\r\n\r\nThe spring came and the peasants, just as they had done in previous\r\nyears, drove their cattle on to the meadows belonging to the landowner.\r\nPeter Nikolaevich called some of the men working on the estate and\r\nordered them to drive the cattle into his yard. The peasants were\r\nworking in the fields, and, disregarding the screaming of the women,\r\nPeter Nikolaevich\xe2\x80\x99s men succeeded in driving in the cattle. When they\r\ncame home the peasants went in a crowd to the cattle-yard on the estate,\r\nand asked for their cattle. Peter Nikolaevich came out to talk to them\r\nwith a gun slung on his shoulder; he had just returned from a ride of\r\ninspection. He told them that he would not let them have their cattle\r\nunless they paid a fine of fifty kopeks for each of the horned cattle,\r\nand twenty kopeks for each sheep. The peasants loudly declared that\r\nthe pasture ground was their property, because their fathers and\r\ngrandfathers had used it, and protested that he had no right whatever to\r\nlay hand on their cattle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive back our cattle, or you will regret it,\xe2\x80\x9d said an old man coming up\r\nto Peter Nikolaevich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I regret it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Peter Nikolaevich, turning pale, and\r\ncoming close to the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive them back, you villain, and don\xe2\x80\x99t provoke us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Peter Nikolaevich, and slapped the old man in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dare to strike me? Come along, you fellows, let us take back our\r\ncattle by force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd drew close to him. Peter Nikolaevich tried to push his way,\r\nthrough them, but the peasants resisted him. Again he tried force.\r\n\r\nHis gun, accidentally discharged in the melee, killed one of the\r\npeasants. Instantly the fight began. Peter Nikolaevich was trodden down,\r\nand five minutes later his mutilated body was dragged into the ravine.\r\n\r\nThe murderers were tried by martial law, and two of them sentenced to\r\nthe gallows.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nIN the village where the lame tailor lived, in the Zemliansk district\r\nof the Voronesh province, five rich peasants hired from the landowner a\r\nhundred and five acres of rich arable land, black as tar, and let it out\r\non lease to the rest of the peasants at fifteen to eighteen roubles\r\nan acre. Not one acre was given under twelve roubles. They got a very\r\nprofitable return, and the five acres which were left to each of their\r\ncompany practically cost them nothing. One of the five peasants died,\r\nand the lame tailor received an offer to take his place.\r\n\r\nWhen they began to divide the land, the tailor gave up drinking vodka,\r\nand, being consulted as to how much land was to be divided, and to\r\nwhom it should be given, he proposed to give allotments to all on equal\r\nterms, not taking from the tenants more than was due for each piece of\r\nland out of the sum paid to the landowner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are no heathens, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all very well for\r\nthe masters to be unfair, but we are true Christians. We must do as God\r\nbids. Such is the law of Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you got that law from?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in the Book, in the Gospels; just come to me on Sunday, I will\r\nread you a few passages, and we will have a talk afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did not all come to him on Sunday, but three came, and he began\r\nreading to them.\r\n\r\nHe read five chapters of St. Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s Gospel, and they talked. One man\r\nonly, Ivan Chouev, accepted the lesson and carried it out completely,\r\nfollowing the rule of Christ in everything from that day. His family\r\ndid the same. Out of the arable land he took only what was his due, and\r\nrefused to take more.\r\n\r\nThe lame tailor and Ivan had people calling on them, and some of these\r\npeople began to grasp the meaning of the Gospels, and in consequence\r\ngave up smoking, drinking, swearing, and using bad language and tried to\r\nhelp one another. They also ceased to go to church, and took their\r\nikons to the village priest, saying they did not want them any more. The\r\npriest was frightened, and reported what had occurred to the bishop.\r\nThe bishop was at a loss what to do. At last he resolved to send the\r\narchimandrite Missael to the village, the one who had formerly been\r\nMitia Smokovnikov\xe2\x80\x99s teacher of religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nASKING Father Missael on his arrival to take a seat, the bishop told him\r\nwhat had happened in his diocese.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all comes from weakness of spirit and from ignorance. You are a\r\nlearned man, and I rely on you. Go to the village, call the parishioners\r\ntogether, and convince them of their error.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your Grace bids me go, and you give me your blessing, I will do my\r\nbest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Missael. He was very pleased with the task entrusted\r\nto him. Every opportunity he could find to demonstrate the firmness of\r\nhis faith was a boon to him. In trying to convince others he was chiefly\r\nintent on persuading himself that he was really a firm believer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo your best. I am greatly distressed about my flock,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bishop,\r\nleisurely taking a cup with his white plump hands from the servant who\r\nbrought in the tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is there only one kind of jam? Bring another,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the\r\nservant. \xe2\x80\x9cI am greatly distressed,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, turning to Father\r\nMissael.\r\n\r\nMissael earnestly desired to prove his zeal; but, being a man of small\r\nmeans, he asked to be paid for the expenses of his journey; and being\r\nafraid of the rough people who might be ill-dis-posed towards him,\r\nhe also asked the bishop to get him an order from the governor of the\r\nprovince, so that the local police might help him in case of need. The\r\nbishop complied with his wishes, and Missael got his things ready with\r\nthe help of his servant and his cook. They furnished him with a case\r\nfull of wine, and a basket with the victuals he might need in going to\r\nsuch a lonely place. Fully provided with all he wanted, he started for\r\nthe village to which he was commissioned. He was pleasantly conscious of\r\nthe importance of his mission. All his doubts as to his own faith passed\r\naway, and he was now fully convinced of its reality.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts, far from being concerned with the real foundation of his\r\ncreed--this was accepted as an axiom--were occupied with the arguments\r\nused against the forms of worship.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE village priest and his wife received Father Missael with great\r\nhonours, and the next day after he had arrived the parishioners were\r\ninvited to assemble in the church. Missael in a new silk cassock, with\r\na large cross on his chest, and his long hair carefully combed, ascended\r\nthe pulpit; the priest stood at his side, the deacons and the choir at\r\na little distance behind him, and the side entrances were guarded by the\r\npolice. The dissenters also came in their dirty sheepskin coats.\r\n\r\nAfter the service Missael delivered a sermon, admonishing the dissenters\r\nto return to the bosom of their mother, the Church, threatening them\r\nwith the torments of hell, and promising full forgiveness to those who\r\nwould repent.\r\n\r\nThe dissenters kept silent at first. Then, being asked questions, they\r\ngave answers. To the question why they dissented, they said that their\r\nchief reason was the fact that the Church worshipped gods made of wood,\r\nwhich, far from being ordained, were condemned by the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nWhen asked by Missael whether they actually considered the holy ikons to\r\nbe mere planks of wood, Chouev answered,--\xe2\x80\x9cJust look at the back of any\r\nikon you choose and you will see what they are made of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen asked why they turned against the priests, their answer was that\r\nthe Scripture says: \xe2\x80\x9cAs you have received it without fee, so you must\r\ngive it to the others; whereas the priests require payment for the grace\r\nthey bestow by the sacraments.\xe2\x80\x9d To all attempts which Missael made\r\nto oppose them by arguments founded on Holy Writ, the tailor and Ivan\r\nChouev gave calm but very firm answers, contradicting his assertions by\r\nappeal to the Scriptures, which they knew uncommonly well.\r\n\r\nMissael got angry and threatened them with persecution by the\r\nauthorities. Their answer was: It is said, I have been persecuted and so\r\nwill you be.\r\n\r\nThe discussion came to nothing, and all would have ended well if Missael\r\nhad not preached the next day at mass, denouncing the wicked seducers of\r\nthe faithful and saying that they deserved the worst punishment. Coming\r\nout of the church, the crowd of peasants began to consult whether it\r\nwould not be well to give the infidels a good lesson for disturbing the\r\nminds of the community. The same day, just when Missael was enjoying\r\nsome salmon and gangfish, dining at the village priest\xe2\x80\x99s in company with\r\nthe inspector, a violent brawl arose in the village. The peasants came\r\nin a crowd to Chouev\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, and waited for the dissenters to come\r\nout in order to give them a thrashing.\r\n\r\nThe dissenters assembled in the cottage numbered about twenty men and\r\nwomen. Missael\xe2\x80\x99s sermon and the attitude of the orthodox peasants,\r\ntogether with their threats, aroused in the mind of the dissenters angry\r\nfeelings, to which they had before been strangers. It was near evening,\r\nthe women had to go and milk the cows, and the peasants were still\r\nstanding and waiting at the door.\r\n\r\nA boy who stepped out of the door was beaten and driven back into the\r\nhouse. The people within began consulting what was to be done, and could\r\ncome to no agreement. The tailor said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must bear whatever is done to\r\nus, and not resist.\xe2\x80\x9d Chouev replied that if they decided on that course\r\nthey would, all of them, be beaten to death. In consequence, he seized\r\na poker and went out of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9clet us follow the\r\nlaw of Moses!\xe2\x80\x9d And, falling upon the peasants, he knocked out one man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye, and in the meanwhile all those who had been in his house contrived\r\nto get out and make their way home.\r\n\r\nChouev was thrown into prison and charged with sedition and blasphemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nTwo years previous to those events a strong and handsome young girl\r\nof an eastern type, Katia Turchaninova, came from the Don military\r\nsettlements to St. Petersburg to study in the university college for\r\nwomen. In that town she met a student, Turin, the son of a district\r\ngovernor in the Simbirsk province, and fell in love with him. But her\r\nlove was not of the ordinary type, and she had no desire to become his\r\nwife and the mother of his children. He was a dear comrade to her, and\r\ntheir chief bond of union was a feeling of revolt they had in common,\r\nas well as the hatred they bore, not only to the existing forms of\r\ngovernment, but to all those who represented that government. They\r\nhad also in common the sense that they both excelled their enemies\r\nin culture, in brains, as well as in morals. Katia Turchaninova was a\r\ngifted girl, possessed of a good memory, by means of which she\r\neasily mastered the lectures she attended. She was successful in her\r\nexaminations, and, apart from that, read all the newest books. She was\r\ncertain that her vocation was not to bear and rear children, and even\r\nlooked on such a task with disgust and contempt. She thought herself\r\nchosen by destiny to destroy the present government, which was fettering\r\nthe best abilities of the nation, and to reveal to the people a higher\r\nstandard of life, inculcated by the latest writers of other countries.\r\nShe was handsome, a little inclined to stoutness: she had a good\r\ncomplexion, shining black eyes, abundant black hair. She inspired the\r\nmen she knew with feelings she neither wished nor had time to share,\r\nbusy as she was with propaganda work, which consisted chiefly in mere\r\ntalking. She was not displeased, however, to inspire these feelings;\r\nand, without dressing too smartly, did not neglect her appearance. She\r\nliked to be admired, as it gave her opportunities of showing how little\r\nshe prized what was valued so highly by other women.\r\n\r\nIn her views concerning the method of fighting the government she went\r\nfurther than the majority of her comrades, and than her friend Turin;\r\nall means, she taught, were justified in such a struggle, not excluding\r\nmurder. And yet, with all her revolutionary ideas, Katia Turchaninova\r\nwas in her soul a very kind girl, ready to sacrifice herself for the\r\nwelfare and the happiness of other people, and sincerely pleased when\r\nshe could do a kindness to anybody, a child, an old person, or an\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nShe went in the summer to stay with a friend, a schoolmistress in\r\na small town on the river Volga. Turin lived near that town, on his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s estate. He often came to see the two girls; they gave each\r\nother books to read, and had long discussions, expressing their common\r\nindignation with the state of affairs in the country. The district\r\ndoctor, a friend of theirs, used also to join them on many occasions.\r\n\r\nThe estate of the Turins was situated in the neighbourhood of the\r\nLiventsov estate, the one that was entrusted to the management of Peter\r\nNikolaevich Sventizky. Soon after Peter Nikolaevich had settled there,\r\nand begun to enforce order, young Turin, having observed an independent\r\ntendency in the peasants on the Liventsov estate, as well as their\r\ndetermination to uphold their rights, became interested in them. He came\r\noften to the village to talk with the men, and developed his socialistic\r\ntheories, insisting particularly on the nationalisation of the land.\r\n\r\nAfter Peter Nikolaevich had been murdered, and the murderers sent\r\nto trial, the revolutionary group of the small town boiled over with\r\nindignation, and did not shrink from openly expressing it. The fact\r\nof Turin\xe2\x80\x99s visits to the village and his propaganda work among the\r\nstudents, became known to the authorities during the trial. A search was\r\nmade in his house; and, as the police found a few revolutionary leaflets\r\namong his effects, he was arrested and transferred to prison in St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nKatia Turchaninova followed him to the metropolis, and went to visit\r\nhim in prison. She was not admitted on the day she came, and was told to\r\ncome on the day fixed by regulations for visits to the prisoners. When\r\nthat day arrived, and she was finally allowed to see him, she had\r\nto talk to him through two gratings separating the prisoner from his\r\nvisitor. This visit increased her indignation against the authorities.\r\nAnd her feelings become all the more revolutionary after a visit she\r\npaid to the office of a gendarme officer who had to deal with the Turin\r\ncase. The officer, a handsome man, seemed obviously disposed to grant\r\nher exceptional favours in visiting the prisoner, if she would allow him\r\nto make love to her. Disgusted with him, she appealed to the chief of\r\npolice. He pretended--just as the officer did when talking officially\r\nto her--to be powerless himself, and to depend entirely on orders coming\r\nfrom the minister of state. She sent a petition to the minister asking\r\nfor an interview, which was refused.\r\n\r\nThen she resolved to do a desperate thing and bought a revolver.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nTHE minister was receiving petitioners at the usual hour appointed for\r\nthe reception. He had talked successively to three of them, and now a\r\npretty young woman with black eyes, who was holding a petition in her\r\nleft hand, approached. The minister\xe2\x80\x99s eyes gleamed when he saw how\r\nattractive the petitioner was, but recollecting his high position he put\r\non a serious face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, coming down to where she stood. Without\r\nanswering his question the young woman quickly drew a revolver from\r\nunder her cloak and aiming it at the minister\xe2\x80\x99s chest fired--but missed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe minister rushed at her, trying to seize her hand, but she escaped,\r\nand taking a step back, fired a second time. The minister ran out of the\r\nroom. The woman was immediately seized. She was trembling violently, and\r\ncould not utter a single word; after a while she suddenly burst into a\r\nhysterical laugh. The minister was not even wounded.\r\n\r\nThat woman was Katia Turchaninova. She was put into the prison of\r\npreliminary detention. The minister received congratulations and\r\nmarks of sympathy from the highest quarters, and even from the emperor\r\nhimself, who appointed a commission to investigate the plot that had led\r\nto the attempted assassination. As a matter of fact there was no plot\r\nwhatever, but the police officials and the detectives set to work\r\nwith the utmost zeal to discover all the threads of the non-existing\r\nconspiracy. They did everything to deserve the fees they were paid;\r\nthey got up in the small hours of the morning, searched one house after\r\nanother, took copies of papers and of books they found, read diaries,\r\npersonal letters, made extracts from them on the very best notepaper and\r\nin beautiful handwriting, interrogated Katia Turchaninova ever so\r\nmany times, and confronted her with all those whom they suspected of\r\nconspiracy, in order to extort from her the names of her accomplices.\r\n\r\nThe minister, a good-natured man at heart, was sincerely sorry for the\r\npretty girl. But he said to himself that he was bound to consider his\r\nhigh state duties imposed upon him, even though they did not imply much\r\nwork and trouble. So, when his former colleague, a chamberlain and a\r\nfriend of the Turins, met him at a court ball and tried to rouse his\r\npity for Turin and the girl Turchaninova, he shrugged his shoulders,\r\nstretching the red ribbon on his white waistcoat, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cJe ne\r\ndemanderais pas mieux que de relacher cette pauvre fillette, mais vous\r\nsavez le devoir.\xe2\x80\x9d And in the meantime Katia Turchaninova was kept\r\nin prison. She was at times in a quiet mood, communicated with her\r\nfellow-prisoners by knocking on the walls, and read the books that were\r\nsent to her. But then came days when she had fits of desperate fury,\r\nknocking with her fists against the wall, screaming and laughing like a\r\nmad-woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nONE day Maria Semenovna came home from the treasurer\xe2\x80\x99s office, where she\r\nhad received her pension. On her way she met a schoolmaster, a friend of\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, Maria Semenovna! Have you received your money?\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nschoolmaster asked, in a loud voice from the other side of the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Maria Semenovna. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was not much; just enough to\r\nfill the holes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there must be some tidy pickings out of such a lot of money,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe schoolmaster, and passed on, after having said good-bye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria Semenovna. While she was looking at her friend,\r\nshe met a tall man face to face, who had very long arms and a stern look\r\nin his eyes. Coming to her house, she was very startled on again seeing\r\nthe same man with the long arms, who had evidently followed her. He\r\nremained standing another moment after she had gone in, then turned and\r\nwalked away.\r\n\r\nMaria Semenovna felt somewhat frightened at first. But when she had\r\nentered the house, and had given her father and her nephew Fedia the\r\npresents she had brought for them, and she had patted the dog Treasure,\r\nwho whined with joy, she forgot her fears. She gave the money to her\r\nfather and began to work, as there was always plenty for her to do.\r\n\r\nThe man she met face to face was Stepan.\r\n\r\nAfter he had killed the innkeeper, he did not return to town. Strange to\r\nsay, he was not sorry to have committed that murder. His mind went back\r\nto the murdered man over and over again during the following day; and\r\nhe liked the recollection of having done the thing so skilfully, so\r\ncleverly, that nobody-would ever discover it, and he would not therefore\r\nbe prevented from murdering other people in the same way. Sitting in the\r\npublic-house and having his tea, he looked at the people around him with\r\nthe same thought how he should murder them. In the evening he called at\r\na carter\xe2\x80\x99s, a man from his village, to spend the night at his house. The\r\ncarter was not in. He said he would wait for him, and in the meanwhile\r\nbegan talking to the carter\xe2\x80\x99s wife. But when she moved to the stove,\r\nwith her back turned to him, the idea entered his mind to kill her. He\r\nmarvelled at himself at first, and shook his head; but the next moment\r\nhe seized the knife he had hidden in his boot, knocked the woman down\r\non the floor, and cut her throat. When the children began to scream, he\r\nkilled them also and went away. He did not look out for another place to\r\nspend the night, but at once left the town. In a village some distance\r\naway he went to the inn and slept there. The next day he returned to the\r\ndistrict town, and there he overheard in the street Maria Semenovna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntalk with the schoolmaster. Her look frightened him, but yet he made\r\nup his mind to creep into her house, and rob her of the money she had\r\nreceived. When the night came he broke the lock and entered the house.\r\nThe first person who heard his steps was the younger daughter, the\r\nmarried one. She screamed. Stepan stabbed her immediately with his\r\nknife. Her husband woke up and fell upon Stepan, seized him by his\r\nthroat, and struggled with him desperately. But Stepan was the stronger\r\nman and overpowered him. After murdering him, Stepan, excited by the\r\nlong fight, stepped into the next room behind a partition. That was\r\nMaria Semenovna\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. She rose in her bed, looked at Stepan with\r\nher mild frightened eyes, and crossed herself.\r\n\r\nOnce more her look scared Stepan. He dropped his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your money?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, without raising his face.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the money?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Stepan again, showing her his knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you . . .\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStepan came close to her, in order to seize her hands and prevent her\r\nstruggling with him, but she did not even try to lift her arms or offer\r\nany resistance; she pressed her hands to her chest, and sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a great sin!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you! Have mercy on yourself.\r\nTo destroy somebody\xe2\x80\x99s soul . . . and worse, your own! . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStepan could not stand her voice any longer, and drew his knife sharply\r\nacross her throat. \xe2\x80\x9cStop that talk!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. She fell back with a\r\nhoarse cry, and the pillow was stained with blood. He turned away, and\r\nwent round the rooms in order to collect all he thought worth taking.\r\nHaving made a bundle of the most valuable things, he lighted a\r\ncigarette, sat down for a while, brushed his clothes, and left the\r\nhouse. He thought this murder would not matter to him more than those\r\nhe had committed before; but before he got a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, he felt\r\nsuddenly so exhausted that he could not walk any farther. He stepped\r\ndown into the gutter and remained lying there the rest of the night, and\r\nthe next day and the next night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE whole time he was lying in the gutter Stepan saw continually before\r\nhis eyes the thin, kindly, and frightened face of Maria Semenovna,\r\nand seemed to hear her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on saying in his\r\nimagination, with her peculiar lisping voice. Stepan saw over again\r\nand over again before him all he had done to her. In horror he shut\r\nhis eyes, and shook his hairy head, to drive away these thoughts and\r\nrecollections. For a moment he would get rid of them, but in their\r\nplace horrid black faces with red eyes appeared and frightened him\r\ncontinuously. They grinned at him, and kept repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cNow you have\r\ndone away with her you must do away with yourself, or we will not leave\r\nyou alone.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened his eyes, and again he saw HER and heard her\r\nvoice; and felt an immense pity for her and a deep horror and\r\ndisgust with himself. Once more he shut his eyes, and the black faces\r\nreappeared. Towards the evening of the next day he rose and went, with\r\nhardly any strength left, to a public-house. There he ordered a drink,\r\nand repeated his demands over and over again, but no quantity of liquor\r\ncould make him intoxicated. He was sitting at a table, and swallowed\r\nsilently one glass after another.\r\n\r\nA police officer came in. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Stepan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the man who murdered all the Dobrotvorov people last night,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nHe was arrested, bound with ropes, and brought to the nearest\r\npolice-station; the next day he was transferred to the prison in the\r\ntown. The inspector of the prison recognised him as an old inmate, and a\r\nvery turbulent one; and, hearing that he had now become a real criminal,\r\naccosted him very harshly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better be quiet here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a hoarse voice, frowning, and\r\nprotruding his lower jaw. \xe2\x80\x9cThe moment you don\xe2\x80\x99t behave, I\xe2\x80\x99ll flog you to\r\ndeath! Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to escape--I will see to that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no desire to escape,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stepan, dropping his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsurrendered of my own free will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up! You must look straight into your superior\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when you talk\r\nto him,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the inspector, and struck Stepan with his fist under the\r\njaw.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Stepan again saw the murdered woman before him, and\r\nheard her voice; he did not pay attention, therefore, to the inspector\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, coming to his senses when he felt the blow on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe off! Don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe inspector expected Stepan to be violent, to talk to the other\r\nprisoners, to make attempts to escape from prison. But nothing of the\r\nkind ever happened. Whenever the guard or the inspector himself looked\r\ninto his cell through the hole in the door, they saw Stepan sitting on a\r\nbag filled with straw, holding his head with his hands and whispering to\r\nhimself. On being brought before the examining magistrate charged with\r\nthe inquiry into his case, he did not behave like an ordinary convict.\r\nHe was very absent-minded, hardly listening to the questions; but when\r\nhe heard what was asked, he answered truthfully, causing the utmost\r\nperplexity to the magistrate, who, accustomed as he was to the necessity\r\nof being very clever and very cunning with convicts, felt a strange\r\nsensation just as if he were lifting up his foot to ascend a step and\r\nfound none. Stepan told him the story of all his murders; and did it\r\nfrowning, with a set look, in a quiet, businesslike voice, trying to\r\nrecollect all the circumstances of his crimes. \xe2\x80\x9cHe stepped out of the\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stepan, telling the tale of his first murder, \xe2\x80\x9cand stood\r\nbarefooted at the door; I hit him, and he just groaned; I went to his\r\nwife, . . .\xe2\x80\x9d And so on.\r\n\r\nOne day the magistrate, visiting the prison cells, asked Stepan whether\r\nthere was anything he had to complain of, or whether he had any wishes\r\nthat might be granted him. Stepan said he had no wishes whatever,\r\nand had nothing to complain of the way he was treated in prison. The\r\nmagistrate, on leaving him, took a few steps in the foul passage, then\r\nstopped and asked the governor who had accompanied him in his visit how\r\nthis prisoner was behaving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI simply wonder at him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the governor, who was very pleased with\r\nStepan, and spoke kindly of him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has now been with us about two\r\nmonths, and could be held up as a model of good behaviour. But I\r\nam afraid he is plotting some mischief. He is a daring man, and\r\nexceptionally strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDURING the first month in prison Stepan suffered from the same agonising\r\nvision. He saw the grey wall of his cell, he heard the sounds of the\r\nprison; the noise of the cell below him, where a number of convicts were\r\nconfined together; the striking of the prison clock; the steps of the\r\nsentry in the passage; but at the same time he saw HER with that kindly\r\nface which conquered his heart the very first time he met her in the\r\nstreet, with that thin, strongly-marked neck, and he heard her soft,\r\nlisping, pathetic voice: \xe2\x80\x9cTo destroy somebody\xe2\x80\x99s soul . . . and, worst of\r\nall, your own. . . . How can you? . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a while her voice would die away, and then black faces would\r\nappear. They would appear whether he had his eyes open or shut. With his\r\nclosed eyes he saw them more distinctly. When he opened his eyes they\r\nvanished for a moment, melting away into the walls and the door; but\r\nafter a while they reappeared and surrounded him from three sides,\r\ngrinning at him and saying over and over: \xe2\x80\x9cMake an end! Make an end!\r\nHang yourself! Set yourself on fire!\xe2\x80\x9d Stepan shook all over when he\r\nheard that, and tried to say all the prayers he knew: \xe2\x80\x9cOur Lady\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cOur\r\nFather.\xe2\x80\x9d At first this seemed to help. In saying his prayers he began to\r\nrecollect his whole life; his father, his mother, the village, the dog\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWolf,\xe2\x80\x9d the old grandfather lying on the stove, the bench on which the\r\nchildren used to play; then the girls in the village with their songs,\r\nhis horses and how they had been stolen, and how the thief was caught\r\nand how he killed him with a stone. He recollected also the first prison\r\nhe was in and his leaving it, and the fat innkeeper, the carter\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nand the children. Then again SHE came to his mind and again he was\r\nterrified. Throwing his prison overcoat off his shoulders, he jumped out\r\nof bed, and, like a wild animal in a cage, began pacing up and down his\r\ntiny cell, hastily turning round when he had reached the damp walls.\r\nOnce more he tried to pray, but it was of no use now.\r\n\r\nThe autumn came with its long nights. One evening when the wind whistled\r\nand howled in the pipes, Stepan, after he had paced up and down his cell\r\nfor a long time, sat down on his bed. He felt he could not struggle any\r\nmore; the black demons had overpowered him, and he had to submit. For\r\nsome time he had been looking at the funnel of the oven. If he could fix\r\non the knob of its lid a loop made of thin shreds of narrow linen straps\r\nit would hold. . . . But he would have to manage it very cleverly. He\r\nset to work, and spent two days in making straps out of the linen bag\r\non which he slept. When the guard came into the cell he covered the\r\nbed with his overcoat. He tied the straps with big knots and made them\r\ndouble, in order that they might be strong enough to hold his weight.\r\nDuring these preparations he was free from tormenting visions. When the\r\nstraps were ready he made a slip-knot out of them, and put it round his\r\nneck, stood up in his bed, and hanged himself. But at the very moment\r\nthat his tongue began to protrude the straps got loose, and he fell\r\ndown. The guard rushed in at the noise. The doctor was called in, Stepan\r\nwas brought to the infirmary. The next day he recovered, and was removed\r\nfrom the infirmary, no more to solitary confinement, but to share the\r\ncommon cell with other prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the common cell he lived in the company of twenty men, but felt as if\r\nhe were quite alone. He did not notice the presence of the rest; did not\r\nspeak to anybody, and was tormented by the old agony. He felt it most of\r\nall when the men were sleeping and he alone could not get one moment of\r\nsleep. Continually he saw HER before his eyes, heard her voice, and then\r\nagain the black devils with their horrible eyes came and tortured him in\r\nthe usual way.\r\n\r\nHe again tried to say his prayers, but, just as before, it did not help\r\nhim. One day when, after his prayers, she was again before his eyes, he\r\nbegan to implore her dear soul to forgive him his sin, and release him.\r\nTowards morning, when he fell down quite exhausted on his crushed linen\r\nbag, he fell asleep at once, and in his dream she came to him with her\r\nthin, wrinkled, and severed neck. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. She\r\nlooked at him with her mild eyes and did not answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you forgive\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d And so he asked her three times. But she did not say a word, and\r\nhe awoke. From that time onwards he suffered less, and seemed to come to\r\nhis senses, looked around him, and began for the first time to talk to\r\nthe other men in the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSTEPAN\xe2\x80\x99S cell was shared among others by the former yard-porter,\r\nVassily, who had been sentenced to deportation for robbery, and by\r\nChouev, sentenced also to deportation. Vassily sang songs the whole day\r\nlong with his fine voice, or told his adventures to the other men in the\r\ncell. Chouev was working at something all day, mending his clothes, or\r\nreading the Gospel and the Psalter.\r\n\r\nStepan asked him why he was put into prison, and Chouev answered that he\r\nwas being persecuted because of his true Christian faith by the priests,\r\nwho were all of them hypocrites and hated those who followed the law of\r\nChrist. Stepan asked what that true law was, and Chouev made clear to\r\nhim that the true law consists in not worshipping gods made with hands,\r\nbut worshipping the spirit and the truth. He told him how he had learnt\r\nthe truth from the lame tailor at the time when they were dividing the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will become of those who have done evil?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Stepan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Scriptures give an answer to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chouev, and read aloud to\r\nhim Matthew xxv. 31:--\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Son of Man shall come in His glory, and\r\nall the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of\r\nHis glory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall\r\nseparate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth His sheep from\r\nthe goats: and He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats\r\non the left. Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come,\r\nye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the\r\nfoundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave Me meat: I\r\nwas thirsty, and ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me\r\nin: naked, and ye clothed Me: I was sick, and ye visited Me: I was\r\nin prison, and ye came unto Me. Then shall the righteous answer Him,\r\nsaying, Lord, when saw we Thee an hungred, and fed Thee? or thirsty,\r\nand gave Thee drink? When saw we Thee a stranger, and took Thee in? or\r\nnaked, and clothed Thee? Or when saw we Thee sick, or in prison, and\r\ncame unto Thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I\r\nsay unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these\r\nMy brethren, ye have done it unto Me. Then shall He say also unto them\r\non the left hand, Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,\r\nprepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungred, and ye gave\r\nMe no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink: I was a stranger and\r\nye took Me not in: naked, and ye clothed Me not; sick, and in prison,\r\nand ye visited Me not. Then shall they also answer Him, saying, Lord,\r\nwhen saw we Thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or\r\nsick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee? Then shall He answer\r\nthem, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one\r\nof the least of these, ye did it not to Me. And these shall go away into\r\neverlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVassily, who was sitting on the floor at Chouev\xe2\x80\x99s side, and was\r\nlistening to his reading the Gospel, nodded his handsome head in\r\napproval. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a resolute tone. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, you cursed villains,\r\ninto everlasting punishment, since you did not give food to the hungry,\r\nbut swallowed it all yourself. Serves them right! I have read the holy\r\nNikodim\xe2\x80\x99s writings,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, showing off his erudition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will they never be pardoned?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Stepan, who had listened\r\nsilently, with his hairy head bent low down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, and be silent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chouev to Vassily, who went on\r\ntalking about the rich who had not given meat to the stranger, nor\r\nvisited him in the prison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d said Chouev, again turning over the leaves of the Gospel.\r\nHaving found what he was looking for, Chouev smoothed the page with his\r\nlarge and strong hand, which had become exceedingly white in prison:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there were also two other malefactors, led with Him\xe2\x80\x9d--it means with\r\nChrist--\xe2\x80\x9cto be put to death. And when they were come to the place, which\r\nis called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the malefactors, one\r\non the right hand, and the other on the left. Then said Jesus,--\xe2\x80\x98Father,\r\nforgive them; for they know not what they do.\xe2\x80\x99 And the people stood\r\nbeholding. And the rulers also with them derided Him, saying,--\xe2\x80\x98He saved\r\nothers; let Him save Himself if He be Christ, the chosen of God.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nthe soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him, and offering Him vinegar,\r\nand saying, \xe2\x80\x98If Thou be the King of the Jews save Thyself.\xe2\x80\x99 And a\r\nsuperscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, and Latin,\r\nand Hebrew, \xe2\x80\x98This is the King of the Jews.\xe2\x80\x99 And one of the malefactors\r\nwhich were hanged railed on Him, saying, \xe2\x80\x98If thou be Christ, save\r\nThyself and us.\xe2\x80\x99 But the other answering rebuked Him, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Dost not\r\nthou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed\r\njustly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath\r\ndone nothing amiss.\xe2\x80\x99 And he said unto Jesus, \xe2\x80\x98Lord, remember me when\r\nThou comest into Thy kingdom.\xe2\x80\x99 And Jesus said unto him, \xe2\x80\x98Verily I say\r\nunto thee, to-day shalt thou be with Me in paradise.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStepan did not say anything, and was sitting in thought, as if he were\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\nNow he knew what the true faith was. Those only will be saved who have\r\ngiven food and drink to the poor and visited the prisoners; those who\r\nhave not done it, go to hell. And yet the malefactor had repented on\r\nthe cross, and went nevertheless to paradise. This did not strike him as\r\nbeing inconsistent. Quite the contrary. The one confirmed the other: the\r\nfact that the merciful will go to Heaven, and the unmerciful to hell,\r\nmeant that everybody ought to be merciful, and the malefactor having\r\nbeen forgiven by Christ meant that Christ was merciful. This was all new\r\nto Stepan, and he wondered why it had been hidden from him so long.\r\n\r\nFrom that day onward he spent all his free time with Chouev, asking him\r\nquestions and listening to him. He saw but a single truth at the bottom\r\nof the teaching of Christ as revealed to him by Chouev: that all men are\r\nbrethren, and that they ought to love and pity one another in order that\r\nall might be happy. And when he listened to Chouev, everything that was\r\nconsistent with this fundamental truth came to him like a thing he had\r\nknown before and only forgotten since, while whatever he heard that\r\nseemed to contradict it, he would take no notice of, as he thought that\r\nhe simply had not understood the real meaning. And from that time Stepan\r\nwas a different man.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nSTEPAN had been very submissive and meek ever since he came to\r\nthe prison, but now he made the prison authorities and all his\r\nfellow-prisoners wonder at the change in him. Without being ordered, and\r\nout of his proper turn he would do all the very hardest work in prison,\r\nand the dirtiest too. But in spite of his humility, the other prisoners\r\nstood in awe of him, and were afraid of him, as they knew he was a\r\nresolute man, possessed of great physical strength. Their respect for\r\nhim increased after the incident of the two tramps who fell upon him; he\r\nwrenched himself loose from them and broke the arm of one of them in the\r\nfight. These tramps had gambled with a young prisoner of some means and\r\ndeprived him of all his money. Stepan took his part, and deprived the\r\ntramps of their winnings. The tramps poured their abuse on him; but when\r\nthey attacked him, he got the better of them. When the Governor asked\r\nhow the fight had come about, the tramps declared that it was Stepan\r\nwho had begun it. Stepan did not try to exculpate himself, and bore\r\npatiently his sentence which was three days in the punishment-cell, and\r\nafter that solitary confinement.\r\n\r\nIn his solitary cell he suffered because he could no longer listen to\r\nChouev and his Gospel. He was also afraid that the former visions of HER\r\nand of the black devils would reappear to torment him. But the visions\r\nwere gone for good. His soul was full of new and happy ideas. He felt\r\nglad to be alone if only he could read, and if he had the Gospel. He\r\nknew that he might have got hold of the Gospel, but he could not read.\r\n\r\nHe had started to learn the alphabet in his boyhood, but could not grasp\r\nthe joining of the syllables, and remained illiterate. He made up\r\nhis mind to start reading anew, and asked the guard to bring him the\r\nGospels. They were brought to him, and he sat down to work. He contrived\r\nto recollect the letters, but could not join them into syllables. He\r\ntried as hard as he could to understand how the letters ought to be put\r\ntogether to form words, but with no result whatever. He lost his sleep,\r\nhad no desire to eat, and a deep sadness came over him, which he was\r\nunable to shake off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you not yet mastered it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the guard one day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know \xe2\x80\x98Our Father\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you do, read it in the Gospels. Here it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard,\r\nshowing him the prayer in the Gospels. Stepan began to read it,\r\ncomparing the letters he knew with the familiar sounds.\r\n\r\nAnd all of a sudden the mystery of the syllables was revealed to him,\r\nand he began to read. This was a great joy. From that moment he could\r\nread, and the meaning of the words, spelt out with such great pains,\r\nbecame more significant.\r\n\r\nStepan did not mind any more being alone. He was so full of his work\r\nthat he did not feel glad when he was transferred back to the common\r\ncell, his private cell being needed for a political prisoner who had\r\nbeen just sent to prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIN the meantime Mahin, the schoolboy who had taught his friend\r\nSmokovnikov to forge the coupon, had finished his career at school and\r\nthen at the university, where he had studied law. He had the advantage\r\nof being liked by women, and as he had won favour with a vice-minister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nformer mistress, he was appointed when still young as examining\r\nmagistrate. He was dishonest, had debts, had gambled, and had seduced\r\nmany women; but he was clever, sagacious, and a good magistrate. He was\r\nappointed to the court of the district where Stepan Pelageushkine\r\nhad been tried. When Stepan was brought to him the first time to give\r\nevidence, his sincere and quiet answers puzzled the magistrate. He\r\nsomehow unconsciously felt that this man, brought to him in fetters and\r\nwith a shorn head, guarded by two soldiers who were waiting to take\r\nhim back to prison, had a free soul and was immeasurably superior to\r\nhimself. He was in consequence somewhat troubled, and had to summon up\r\nall his courage in order to go on with the inquiry and not blunder in\r\nhis questions. He was amazed that Stepan should narrate the story of his\r\ncrimes as if they had been things of long ago, and committed not by him\r\nbut by some different man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you no pity for them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mahin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I did not know then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStepan smiled with a sad smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not do it even\r\nif I were to be burned alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have come to know that all men are brethren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about me? Am I your brother also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is it that I, your brother, am sending you to hard labour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I not know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you judge, it means obviously that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on. . . . What next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nNow it was not Chouev, but Stepan who used to read the gospel in the\r\ncommon cell. Some of the prisoners were singing coarse songs, while\r\nothers listened to Stepan reading the gospel and talking about what he\r\nhad read. The most attentive among those who listened were two of the\r\nprisoners, Vassily, and a convict called Mahorkin, a murderer who had\r\nbecome a hangman. Twice during his stay in this prison he was called\r\nupon to do duty as hangman, and both times in far-away places where\r\nnobody could be found to execute the sentences.\r\n\r\nTwo of the peasants who had killed Peter Nikolaevich Sventizky, had been\r\nsentenced to the gallows, and Mahorkin was ordered to go to Pensa to\r\nhang them. On all previous occasions he used to write a petition to the\r\ngovernor of the province--he knew well how to read and to write--stating\r\nthat he had been ordered to fulfil his duty, and asking for money\r\nfor his expenses. But now, to the greatest astonishment of the prison\r\nauthorities, he said he did not intend to go, and added that he would\r\nnot be a hangman any more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about being flogged?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the governor of the prison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will have to bear it, as the law commands us not to kill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you get that from Pelageushkine? A nice sort of a prison prophet!\r\nYou just wait and see what this will cost you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mahin was told of that incident, he was greatly impressed by the\r\nfact of Stepan\xe2\x80\x99s influence on the hangman, who refused to do his duty,\r\nrunning the risk of being hanged himself for insubordination.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAT an evening party at the Eropkins, Mahin, who was paying attentions\r\nto the two young daughters of the house--they were rich matches, both of\r\nthem--having earned great applause for his fine singing and playing\r\nthe piano, began telling the company about the strange convict who had\r\nconverted the hangman. Mahin told his story very accurately, as he had a\r\nvery good memory, which was all the more retentive because of his\r\ntotal indifference to those with whom he had to deal. He never paid the\r\nslightest attention to other people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, and was therefore better\r\nable to keep all they did or said in his memory. He got interested in\r\nStepan Pelageushkine, and, although he did not thoroughly understand\r\nhim, yet asked himself involuntarily what was the matter with the\r\nman? He could not find an answer, but feeling that there was certainly\r\nsomething remarkable going on in Stepan\xe2\x80\x99s soul, he told the company\r\nat the Eropkins all about Stepan\xe2\x80\x99s conversion of the hangman, and also\r\nabout his strange behaviour in prison, his reading the Gospels and his\r\ngreat influence on the rest of the prisoners. All this made a special\r\nimpression on the younger daughter of the family, Lisa, a girl of\r\neighteen, who was just recovering from the artificial life she had\r\nbeen living in a boarding-school; she felt as if she had emerged out of\r\nwater, and was taking in the fresh air of true life with ecstasy. She\r\nasked Mahin to tell her more about the man Pelageushkine, and to explain\r\nto her how such a great change had come over him. Mahin told her what he\r\nknew from the police official about Stepan\xe2\x80\x99s last murder, and also what\r\nhe had heard from Pelageushkine himself--how he had been conquered by\r\nthe humility, mildness, and fearlessness of a kind woman, who had been\r\nhis last victim, and how his eyes had been opened, while the reading of\r\nthe Gospels had completed the change in him.\r\n\r\nLisa Eropkin was not able to sleep that night. For a couple of months a\r\nstruggle had gone on in her heart between society life, into which her\r\nsister was dragging her, and her infatuation for Mahin, combined with\r\na desire to reform him. This second desire now became the stronger. She\r\nhad already heard about poor Maria Semenovna. But, after that kind woman\r\nhad been murdered in such a ghastly way, and after Mahin, who learnt\r\nit from Stepan, had communicated to her all the facts concerning Maria\r\nSemenovna\xe2\x80\x99s life, Lisa herself passionately desired to become like her.\r\nShe was a rich girl, and was afraid that Mahin had been courting her\r\nbecause of her money. So she resolved to give all she possessed to the\r\npoor, and told Mahin about it.\r\n\r\nMahin was very glad to prove his disinterestedness, and told Lisa that\r\nhe loved her and not her money. Such proof of his innate nobility made\r\nhim admire himself greatly. Mahin helped Lisa to carry out her decision.\r\nAnd the more he did so, the more he came to realise the new world of\r\nLisa\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual ambitions, quite unknown to him heretofore.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nALL were silent in the common cell. Stepan was lying in his bed, but\r\nwas not yet asleep. Vassily approached him, and, pulling him by his leg,\r\nasked him in a whisper to get up and to come to him. Stepan stepped out\r\nof his bed, and came up to Vassily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo me a kindness, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vassily. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to fly from the prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVassily told Stepan that he had everything ready for his flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow I shall stir them up--\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to the prisoners asleep in\r\ntheir beds. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will give me away, and I shall be transferred to the\r\ncell in the upper floor. I know my way from there. What I want you for\r\nis to unscrew the prop in the door of the mortuary.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI can do that. But\r\nwhere will you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care where. Are not there plenty of wicked people in every\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so, brother. But it is not our business to judge them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a murderer, to be sure. I have not destroyed a living soul in\r\nmy life. As for stealing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any harm in that. As if they have\r\nnot robbed us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them answer for it themselves, if they do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother them all! Suppose I rob a church, who will be hurt? This time\r\nI will take care not to break into a small shop, but will get hold of a\r\nlot of money, and then I will help people with it. I will give it to all\r\ngood people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the prisoners rose in his bed and listened. Stepan and Vassily\r\nbroke off their conversation. The next day Vassily carried out his idea.\r\nHe began complaining of the bread in prison, saying it was moist, and\r\ninduced the prisoners to call the governor and to tell him of their\r\ndiscontent. The governor came, abused them all, and when he heard it\r\nwas Vassily who had stirred up the men, he ordered him to be transferred\r\ninto solitary confinement in the cell on the upper floor. This was all\r\nVassily wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nVASSILY knew well that cell on the upper floor. He knew its floor, and\r\nbegan at once to take out bits of it. When he had managed to get under\r\nthe floor he took out pieces of the ceiling beneath, and jumped down\r\ninto the mortuary a floor below. That day only one corpse was lying on\r\nthe table. There in the corner of the room were stored bags to make hay\r\nmattresses for the prisoners. Vassily knew about the bags, and that\r\nwas why the mortuary served his purposes. The prop in the door had been\r\nunscrewed and put in again. He took it out, opened the door, and went\r\nout into the passage to the lavatory which was being built. In the\r\nlavatory was a large hole connecting the third floor with the basement\r\nfloor. After having found the door of the lavatory he went back to the\r\nmortuary, stripped the sheet off the dead body which was as cold as ice\r\n(in taking off the sheet Vassily touched his hand), took the bags, tied\r\nthem together to make a rope, and carried the rope to the lavatory. Then\r\nhe attached it to the cross-beam, and climbed down along it. The rope\r\ndid not reach the ground, but he did not know how much was wanting.\r\nAnyhow, he had to take the risk. He remained hanging in the air, and\r\nthen jumped down. His legs were badly hurt, but he could still walk on.\r\nThe basement had two windows; he could have climbed out of one of them\r\nbut for the grating protecting them. He had to break the grating, but\r\nthere was no tool to do it with. Vassily began to look around him, and\r\nchanced on a piece of plank with a sharp edge; armed with that weapon he\r\ntried to loosen the bricks which held the grating. He worked a long time\r\nat that task. The cock crowed for the second time, but the grating still\r\nheld. At last he had loosened one side; and then he pushed the plank\r\nunder the loosened end and pressed with all his force. The grating gave\r\nway completely, but at that moment one of the bricks fell down heavily.\r\nThe noise could have been heard by the sentry. Vassily stood motionless.\r\nBut silence reigned. He climbed out of the window. His way of escape was\r\nto climb the wall. An outhouse stood in the corner of the courtyard. He\r\nhad to reach its roof, and pass thence to the top of the wall. But he\r\nwould not be able to reach the roof without the help of the plank; so he\r\nhad to go back through the basement window to fetch it. A moment later\r\nhe came out of the window with the plank in his hands; he stood still\r\nfor a while listening to the steps of the sentry. His expectations were\r\njustified. The sentry was walking up and down on the other side of the\r\ncourtyard. Vassily came up to the outhouse, leaned the plank against it,\r\nand began climbing. The plank slipped and fell on the ground. Vassily\r\nhad his stockings on; he took them off so that he could cling with his\r\nbare feet in coming down. Then he leaned the plank again against the\r\nhouse, and seized the water-pipe with his hands. If only this time\r\nthe plank would hold! A quick movement up the water-pipe, and his knee\r\nrested on the roof. The sentry was approaching. Vassily lay motionless.\r\nThe sentry did not notice him, and passed on. Vassily leaped to his\r\nfeet; the iron roof cracked under him. Another step or two, and he would\r\nreach the wall. He could touch it with his hand now. He leaned forward\r\nwith one hand, then with the other, stretched out his body as far as\r\nhe could, and found himself on the wall. Only, not to break his legs in\r\njumping down, Vassily turned round, remained hanging in the air by his\r\nhands, stretched himself out, loosened the grip of one hand, then the\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, me, God!\xe2\x80\x9d He was on the ground. And the ground was soft.\r\nHis legs were not hurt, and he ran at the top of his speed. In a suburb,\r\nMalania opened her door, and he crept under her warm coverlet, made of\r\nsmall pieces of different colours stitched together.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE wife of Peter Nikolaevich Sventizky, a tall and handsome woman, as\r\nquiet and sleek as a well-fed heifer, had seen from her window how her\r\nhusband had been murdered and dragged away into the fields. The horror\r\nof such a sight to Natalia Ivanovna was so intense--how could it be\r\notherwise?--that all her other feelings vanished. No sooner had the\r\ncrowd disappeared from view behind the garden fence, and the voices had\r\nbecome still; no sooner had the barefooted Malania, their servant, run\r\nin with her eyes starting out of her head, calling out in a voice\r\nmore suited to the proclamation of glad tidings the news that Peter\r\nNikolaevich had been murdered and thrown into the ravine, than Natalia\r\nIvanovna felt that behind her first sensation of horror, there was\r\nanother sensation; a feeling of joy at her deliverance from the tyrant,\r\nwho through all the nineteen years of their married life had made her\r\nwork without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s rest. Her joy made her aghast; she did not\r\nconfess it to herself, but hid it the more from those around. When\r\nhis mutilated, yellow and hairy body was being washed and put into the\r\ncoffin, she cried with horror, and wept and sobbed. When the coroner--a\r\nspecial coroner for serious cases--came and was taking her evidence, she\r\nnoticed in the room, where the inquest was taking place, two peasants in\r\nirons, who had been charged as the principal culprits. One of them was\r\nan old man with a curly white beard, and a calm and severe countenance.\r\nThe other was rather young, of a gipsy type, with bright eyes and curly\r\ndishevelled hair. She declared that they were the two men who had first\r\nseized hold of Peter Nikolaevich\xe2\x80\x99s hands. In spite of the gipsy-like\r\npeasant looking at her with his eyes glistening from under his moving\r\neyebrows, and saying reproachfully: \xe2\x80\x9cA great sin, lady, it is. Remember\r\nyour death hour!\xe2\x80\x9d--in spite of that, she did not feel at all sorry for\r\nthem. On the contrary, she began to hate them during the inquest, and\r\nwished desperately to take revenge on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s murderers.\r\n\r\nA month later, after the case, which was committed for trial by\r\ncourt-martial, had ended in eight men being sentenced to hard labour,\r\nand in two--the old man with the white beard, and the gipsy boy, as she\r\ncalled the other--being condemned to be hanged, Natalia felt vaguely\r\nuneasy. But unpleasant doubts soon pass away under the solemnity of a\r\ntrial. Since such high authorities considered that this was the right\r\nthing to do, it must be right.\r\n\r\nThe execution was to take place in the village itself. One Sunday\r\nMalania came home from church in her new dress and her new boots, and\r\nannounced to her mistress that the gallows were being erected, and that\r\nthe hangman was expected from Moscow on Wednesday. She also announced\r\nthat the families of the convicts were raging, and that their cries\r\ncould be heard all over the village.\r\n\r\nNatalia Ivanovna did not go out of her house; she did not wish to see\r\nthe gallows and the people in the village; she only wanted what had to\r\nhappen to be over quickly. She only considered her own feelings, and did\r\nnot care for the convicts and their families.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday the village constable called on Natalia Ivanovna. He was a\r\nfriend, and she offered him vodka and preserved mushrooms of her\r\nown making. The constable, after eating a little, told her that the\r\nexecution was not to take place the next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very strange thing has happened. There is no hangman to be found.\r\nThey had one in Moscow, my son told me, but he has been reading the\r\nGospels a good deal and says: \xe2\x80\x98I will not commit a murder.\xe2\x80\x99 He had\r\nhimself been sentenced to hard labour for having committed a murder, and\r\nnow he objects to hang when the law orders him. He was threatened with\r\nflogging. \xe2\x80\x98You may flog me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98but I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNatalia Ivanovna grew red and hot at the thought which suddenly came\r\ninto her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould not the death sentence be commuted now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, since the judges have passed it? The Czar alone has the right\r\nof amnesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how would he know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have the right of appealing to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is on my account they are to die,\xe2\x80\x9d said that stupid woman,\r\nNatalia Ivanovna. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I forgive them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe constable laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell--send a petition to the Czar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it not too late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend it by telegram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Czar himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Czar, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe story of the hangman having refused to do his duty, and preferring\r\nto take the flogging instead, suddenly changed the soul of Natalia\r\nIvanovna. The pity and the horror she felt the moment she heard that the\r\npeasants were sentenced to death, could not be stifled now, but filled\r\nher whole soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFilip Vassilievich, my friend. Write that telegram for me. I want to\r\nappeal to the Czar to pardon them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe constable shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether that would not involve\r\nus in trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do it upon my own responsibility. I will not mention your name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not she a kind woman,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the constable. \xe2\x80\x9cVery kind-hearted,\r\nto be sure. If my wife had such a heart, our life would be a paradise,\r\ninstead of what it is now.\xe2\x80\x9d And he wrote the telegram,--\xe2\x80\x9cTo his Imperial\r\nMajesty, the Emperor. Your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s loyal subject, the widow of Peter\r\nNikolaevich Sventizky, murdered by the peasants, throws herself at the\r\nsacred feet (this sentence, when he wrote it down, pleased the constable\r\nhimself most of all) of your Imperial Majesty, and implores you to grant\r\nan amnesty to the peasants so and so, from such a province, district,\r\nand village, who have been sentenced to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe telegram was sent by the constable himself, and Natalia Ivanovna\r\nfelt relieved and happy. She had a feeling that since she, the widow of\r\nthe murdered man, had forgiven the murderers, and was applying for an\r\namnesty, the Czar could not possibly refuse it.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nLISA EROPKIN lived in a state of continual excitement. The longer she\r\nlived a true Christian life as it had been revealed to her, the more\r\nconvinced she became that it was the right way, and her heart was full\r\nof joy.\r\n\r\nShe had two immediate aims before her. The one was to convert Mahin; or,\r\nas she put it to herself, to arouse his true nature, which was good\r\nand kind. She loved him, and the light of her love revealed the divine\r\nelement in his soul which is at the bottom of all souls. But, further,\r\nshe saw in him an exceptionally kind and tender heart, as well as a\r\nnoble mind. Her other aim was to abandon her riches. She had first\r\nthought of giving away what she possessed in order to test Mahin; but\r\nafterwards she wanted to do so for her own sake, for the sake of her own\r\nsoul. She began by simply giving money to any one who wanted it. But her\r\nfather stopped that; besides which, she felt disgusted at the crowd of\r\nsupplicants who personally, and by letters, besieged her with demands\r\nfor money. Then she resolved to apply to an old man, known to be a\r\nsaint by his life, and to give him her money to dispose of in the way\r\nhe thought best. Her father got angry with her when he heard about it.\r\nDuring a violent altercation he called her mad, a raving lunatic, and\r\nsaid he would take measures to prevent her from doing injury to herself.\r\n\r\nHer father\xe2\x80\x99s irritation proved contagious. Losing all control\r\nover herself, and sobbing with rage, she behaved with the greatest\r\nimpertinence to her father, calling him a tyrant and a miser.\r\n\r\nThen she asked his forgiveness. He said he did not mind what she said;\r\nbut she saw plainly that he was offended, and in his heart did not\r\nforgive her. She did not feel inclined to tell Mahin about her quarrel\r\nwith her father; as to her sister, she was very cold to Lisa, being\r\njealous of Mahin\xe2\x80\x99s love for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to confess to God,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. As all this happened\r\nin Lent, she made up her mind to fast in preparation for the communion,\r\nand to reveal all her thoughts to the father confessor, asking his\r\nadvice as to what she ought to decide for the future.\r\n\r\nAt a small distance from her town a monastery was situated, where an old\r\nmonk lived who had gained a great reputation by his holy life, by his\r\nsermons and prophecies, as well as by the marvellous cures ascribed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe monk had received a letter from Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s father announcing the visit\r\nof his daughter, and telling him in what a state of excitement the young\r\ngirl was. He also expressed the hope in that letter that the monk would\r\ninfluence her in the right way, urging her not to depart from the golden\r\nmean, and to live like a good Christian without trying to upset the\r\npresent conditions of her life.\r\n\r\nThe monk received Lisa after he had seen many other people, and being\r\nvery tired, began by quietly recommending her to be modest and to submit\r\nto her present conditions of life and to her parents. Lisa listened\r\nsilently, blushing and flushed with excitement. When he had finished\r\nadmonishing her, she began saying with tears in her eyes, timidly\r\nat first, that Christ bade us leave father and mother to follow Him.\r\nGetting more and more excited, she told him her conception of Christ.\r\nThe monk smiled slightly, and replied as he generally did when\r\nadmonishing his penitents; but after a while he remained silent,\r\nrepeating with heavy sighs, \xe2\x80\x9cO God!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, come to\r\nconfession to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d and blessed her with his wrinkled hands.\r\n\r\nThe next day Lisa came to confession, and without renewing their\r\ninterrupted conversation, he absolved her and refused to dispose of her\r\nfortune, giving no reasons for doing so.\r\n\r\nLisa\xe2\x80\x99s purity, her devotion to God and her ardent soul, impressed the\r\nmonk deeply. He had desired long ago to renounce the world entirely; but\r\nthe brotherhood, which drew a large income from his work as a preacher,\r\ninsisted on his continuing his activity. He gave way, although he had a\r\nvague feeling that he was in a false position. It was rumoured that he\r\nwas a miracle-working saint, whereas in reality he was a weak man, proud\r\nof his success in the world. When the soul of Lisa was revealed to him,\r\nhe saw clearly into his own soul. He discovered how different he was to\r\nwhat he wanted to be, and realised the desire of his heart.\r\n\r\nSoon after Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s visit he went to live in a separate cell as a hermit,\r\nand for three weeks did not officiate again in the church of the friary.\r\nAfter the celebration of the mass, he preached a sermon denouncing his\r\nown sins and those of the world, and urging all to repent.\r\n\r\nFrom that day he preached every fortnight, and his sermons attracted\r\nincreasing audiences. His fame as a preacher spread abroad. His sermons\r\nwere extraordinarily fearless and sincere, and deeply impressed all who\r\nlistened to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nVASSILY was actually carrying out the object he had in leaving the\r\nprison. With the help of a few friends he broke into the house of the\r\nrich merchant Krasnopuzov, whom he knew to be a miser and a debauchee.\r\nVassily took out of his writing-desk thirty thousand roubles, and began\r\ndisposing of them as he thought right. He even gave up drink, so as\r\nnot to spend that money on himself, but to distribute it to the poor;\r\nhelping poor girls to get married; paying off people\xe2\x80\x99s debts, and doing\r\nthis all without ever revealing himself to those he helped; his only\r\ndesire was to distribute his money in the right way. As he also gave\r\nbribes to the police, he was left in peace for a long time.\r\n\r\nHis heart was singing for joy. When at last he was arrested and put to\r\ntrial, he confessed with pride that he had robbed the fat merchant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas lying idle in that fool\xe2\x80\x99s desk, and he did not\r\neven know how much he had, whereas I have put it into circulation and\r\nhelped a lot of good people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the defence spoke with such good humour and kindness\r\nthat the jury felt inclined to discharge Vassily, but sentenced him\r\nnevertheless to confinement in prison. He thanked the jury, and assured\r\nthem that he would find his way out of prison before long.\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nNATALIA IVANOVNA SVENTIZKY\xe2\x80\x99S telegram proved useless. The committee\r\nappointed to deal with the petitions in the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s name, decided not\r\neven to make a report to the Czar. But one day when the Sventizky case\r\nwas discussed at the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s luncheon-table, the chairman of the\r\ncommittee, who was present, mentioned the telegram which had been\r\nreceived from Sventizky\xe2\x80\x99s widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est tres gentil de sa part,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the ladies of the imperial\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor sighed, shrugged his shoulders, adorned with epaulettes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and raised his glass for the groom of the chamber to\r\npour out some Moselle.\r\n\r\nAll those present pretended to admire the wisdom of the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords. There was no further question about the telegram. The two\r\npeasants, the old man and the young boy, were hanged by a Tartar hangman\r\nfrom Kazan, a cruel convict and a murderer.\r\n\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s wife wanted to dress the body of her husband in a white\r\nshirt, with white bands which serve as stockings, and new boots, but she\r\nwas not allowed to do so. The two men were buried together in the same\r\npit outside the church-yard wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Sofia Vladimirovna tells me he is a very remarkable preacher,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n remarked the old Empress, the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s mother, one day to her son:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaites le venir. Il peut precher a la cathedrale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it would be better in the palace church,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor, and\r\nordered the hermit Isidor to be invited.\r\n\r\nAll the generals, and other high officials, assembled in the church of\r\nthe imperial palace; it was an event to hear the famous preacher.\r\n\r\nA thin and grey old man appeared, looked at those present, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthe name of God, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,\xe2\x80\x9d and began to speak.\r\n\r\nAt first all went well, but the longer he spoke the worse it became. \xe2\x80\x9cIl\r\ndevient de plus en plus aggressif,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Empress put it afterwards. He\r\nfulminated against every one. He spoke about the executions and\r\ncharged the government with having made so many necessary. How can the\r\ngovernment of a Christian country kill men?\r\n\r\nEverybody looked at everybody else, thinking of the bad taste of the\r\nsermon, and how unpleasant it must be for the Emperor to listen to it;\r\nbut nobody expressed these thoughts aloud.\r\n\r\nWhen Isidor had said Amen, the metropolitan approached, and asked him to\r\ncall on him.\r\n\r\nAfter Isidor had had a talk with the metropolitan and with the\r\nattorney-general, he was immediately sent away to a friary, not his own,\r\nbut one at Suzdal, which had a prison attached to it; the prior of that\r\nfriary was now Father Missael.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nEVERY one tried to look as if Isidor\xe2\x80\x99s sermon contained nothing\r\nunpleasant, and nobody mentioned it. It seemed to the Czar that the\r\nhermit\xe2\x80\x99s words had not made any impression on himself; but once or twice\r\nduring that day he caught himself thinking of the two peasants who had\r\nbeen hanged, and the widow of Sventizky who had asked an amnesty for\r\nthem. That day the Emperor had to be present at a parade; after which he\r\nwent out for a drive; a reception of ministers came next, then dinner,\r\nafter dinner the theatre. As usual, the Czar fell asleep the moment his\r\nhead touched the pillow. In the night an awful dream awoke him: he saw\r\ngallows in a large field and corpses dangling on them; the tongues\r\nof the corpses were protruding, and their bodies moved and shook. And\r\nsomebody shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is you--you who have done it!\xe2\x80\x9d The Czar woke up\r\nbathed in perspiration and began to think. It was the first time that he\r\nhad ever thought of the responsibilities which weighed on him, and the\r\nwords of old Isidor came back to his mind. . . .\r\n\r\nBut only dimly could he see himself as a mere human being, and he could\r\nnot consider his mere human wants and duties, because of all that was\r\nrequired of him as Czar. As to acknowledging that human duties were more\r\nobligatory than those of a Czar--he had not strength for that.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nHAVING served his second term in the prison, Prokofy, who had formerly\r\nworked on the Sventizky estate, was no longer the brisk, ambitious,\r\nsmartly dressed fellow he had been. He seemed, on the contrary, a\r\ncomplete wreck. When sober he would sit idle and would refuse to do any\r\nwork, however much his father scolded him; moreover, he was continually\r\nseeking to get hold of something secretly, and take it to the\r\npublic-house for a drink. When he came home he would continue to sit\r\nidle, coughing and spitting all the time. The doctor on whom he called,\r\nexamined his chest and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, my man, ought to have many things which you have not got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is usually the case, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake plenty of milk, and don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are days of fasting, and besides we have no cow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce in spring he could not get any sleep; he was longing to have a\r\ndrink. There was nothing in the house he could lay his hand on to take\r\nto the public-house. He put on his cap and went out. He walked along the\r\nstreet up to the house where the priest and the deacon lived together.\r\nThe deacon\xe2\x80\x99s harrow stood outside leaning against the hedge. Prokofy\r\napproached, took the harrow upon his shoulder, and walked to an inn kept\r\nby a woman, Petrovna. She might give him a small bottle of vodka for\r\nit. But he had hardly gone a few steps when the deacon came out of his\r\nhouse. It was already dawn, and he saw that Prokofy was carrying away\r\nhis harrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the deacon.\r\n\r\nThe neighbours rushed out from their houses. Prokofy was seized,\r\nbrought to the police station, and then sentenced to eleven months\xe2\x80\x99\r\nimprisonment. It was autumn, and Prokofy had to be transferred to the\r\nprison hospital. He was coughing badly; his chest was heaving from the\r\nexertion; and he could not get warm. Those who were stronger contrived\r\nnot to shiver; Prokofy on the contrary shivered day and night, as the\r\nsuperintendent would not light the fires in the hospital till November,\r\nto save expense.\r\n\r\nProkofy suffered greatly in body, and still more in soul. He was\r\ndisgusted with his surroundings, and hated every one--the deacon, the\r\nsuperintendent who would not light the fires, the guard, and the man\r\nwho was lying in the bed next to his, and who had a swollen red lip. He\r\nbegan also to hate the new convict who was brought into hospital. This\r\nconvict was Stepan. He was suffering from some disease on his head,\r\nand was transferred to the hospital and put in a bed at Prokofy\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\nAfter a time that hatred to Stepan changed, and Prokofy became, on the\r\ncontrary, extremely fond of him; he delighted in talking to him. It was\r\nonly after a talk with Stepan that his anguish would cease for a while.\r\nStepan always told every one he met about his last murder, and how it\r\nhad impressed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar from shrieking, or anything of that kind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Prokofy, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\ndid not move. \xe2\x80\x98Kill me! There I am,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98But it is not my soul\r\nyou destroy, it is your own.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, it is very dreadful to kill. I had one day to\r\nslaughter a sheep, and even that made me half mad. I have not destroyed\r\nany living soul; why then do those villains kill me? I have done no harm\r\nto anybody . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be taken into consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen anything yet showing that God exists, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve in Him, brother. I think when a man dies, grass will grow over\r\nthe spot, and that is the end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong to think like that. I have murdered so many people,\r\nwhereas she, poor soul, was helping everybody. And you think she and I\r\nare to have the same lot? Oh no! Only wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you believe the soul lives on after a man is dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure; it truly lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProkofy suffered greatly when death drew near. He could hardly breathe.\r\nBut in the very last hour he felt suddenly relieved from all pain. He\r\ncalled Stepan to him. \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDeath has come, I\r\nsee. I was so afraid of it before. And now I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. I only wish it\r\nto come quicker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nIN the meanwhile, the affairs of Eugene Mihailovich had grown worse and\r\nworse. Business was very slack. There was a new shop in the town; he was\r\nlosing his customers, and the interest had to be paid. He borrowed again\r\non interest. At last his shop and his goods were to be sold up. Eugene\r\nMihailovich and his wife applied to every one they knew, but they\r\ncould not raise the four hundred roubles they needed to save the shop\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nThey had some hope of the merchant Krasnopuzov, Eugene Mihailovich\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife being on good terms with his mistress. But news came that\r\nKrasnopuzov had been robbed of a huge sum of money. Some said of half\r\na million roubles. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know who is said to be the thief?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEugene Mihailovich to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cVassily, our former yard-porter. They\r\nsay he is squandering the money, and the police are bribed by him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew he was a villain. You remember how he did not mind perjuring\r\nhimself? But I did not expect it would go so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear he has recently been in the courtyard of our house. Cook says\r\nshe is sure it was he. She told me he helps poor girls to get married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey always invent tales. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment a strange man, shabbily dressed, entered the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a letter for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you require an answer? Wait a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d The strange man handed the letter and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow extraordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugene Mihailovich, and tore open the\r\nenvelope. To his great amazement several hundred rouble notes fell out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour hundred roubles!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, hardly believing his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndoes it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe envelope also contained a badly-spelt letter, addressed to Eugene\r\nMihailovich. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is said in the Gospels,\xe2\x80\x9d ran the letter, \xe2\x80\x9cdo good for\r\nevil. You have done me much harm; and in the coupon case you made me\r\nwrong the peasants greatly. But I have pity for you. Here are four\r\nhundred notes. Take them, and remember your porter Vassily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery extraordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugene Mihailovich to his wife and to\r\nhimself. And each time he remembered that incident, or spoke about it to\r\nhis wife, tears would come to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nFOURTEEN priests were kept in the Suzdal friary prison, chiefly for\r\nhaving been untrue to the orthodox faith. Isidor had been sent to that\r\nplace also. Father Missael received him according to the instructions he\r\nhad been given, and without talking to him ordered him to be put into a\r\nseparate cell as a serious criminal. After a fortnight Father Missael,\r\nmaking a round of the prison, entered Isidor\xe2\x80\x99s cell, and asked him\r\nwhether there was anything he wished for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great deal I wish for,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Isidor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot\r\ntell you what it is in the presence of anybody else. Let me talk to you\r\nprivately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other, and Missael saw he had nothing to be afraid\r\nof in remaining alone with Isidor. He ordered Isidor to be brought into\r\nhis own room, and when they were alone, he said,--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now you can\r\nspeak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsidor fell on his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isidor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing to yourself! Have mercy on\r\nyour own soul. You are the worst villain in the world. You have offended\r\nagainst all that is sacred . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA month after Missael sent a report, asking that Isidor should be\r\nreleased as he had repented, and he also asked for the release of the\r\nrest of the prisoners. After which he resigned his post.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTEN years passed. Mitia Smokovnikov had finished his studies in the\r\nTechnical College; he was now an engineer in the gold mines in Siberia,\r\nand was very highly paid. One day he was about to make a round in the\r\ndistrict. The governor offered him a convict, Stepan Pelageushkine, to\r\naccompany him on his journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA convict, you say? But is not that dangerous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if it is this one. He is a holy man. You may ask anybody, they will\r\nall tell you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy has he been sent here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe governor smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had committed six murders, and yet he is a holy\r\nman. I go bail for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitia Smokovnikov took Stepan, now a bald-headed, lean, tanned man, with\r\nhim on his journey. On their way Stepan took care of Smokovnikov, like\r\nhis own child, and told him his story; told him why he had been sent\r\nhere, and what now filled his life.\r\n\r\nAnd, strange to say, Mitia Smokovnikov, who up to that time used to\r\nspend his time drinking, eating, and gambling, began for the first time\r\nto meditate on life. These thoughts never left him now, and produced\r\na complete change in his habits. After a time he was offered a very\r\nadvantageous position. He refused it, and made up his mind to buy an\r\nestate with the money he had, to marry, and to devote himself to the\r\npeasantry, helping them as much as he could.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nHE carried out his intentions. But before retiring to his estate he\r\ncalled on his father, with whom he had been on bad terms, and who had\r\nsettled apart with his new family. Mitia Smokovnikov wanted to make it\r\nup. The old man wondered at first, and laughed at the change he noticed\r\nin his son; but after a while he ceased to find fault with him, and\r\nthought of the many times when it was he who was the guilty one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE DANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--AND you say that a man cannot, of himself, understand what is good\r\nand evil; that it is all environment, that the environment swamps the\r\nman. But I believe it is all chance. Take my own case . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus spoke our excellent friend, Ivan Vasilievich, after a conversation\r\nbetween us on the impossibility of improving individual character\r\nwithout a change of the conditions under which men live. Nobody had\r\nactually said that one could not of oneself understand good and evil;\r\nbut it was a habit of Ivan Vasilievich to answer in this way the\r\nthoughts aroused in his own mind by conversation, and to illustrate\r\nthose thoughts by relating incidents in his own life. He often quite\r\nforgot the reason for his story in telling it; but he always told it\r\nwith great sincerity and feeling.\r\n\r\nHe did so now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my own case. My whole life was moulded, not by environment, but by\r\nsomething quite different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what, then?\xe2\x80\x9d we asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is a long story. I should have to tell you about a great many\r\nthings to make you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, tell us then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIvan Vasilievich thought a little, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy whole life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas changed in one night, or, rather,\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what happened?\xe2\x80\x9d one of us asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened was that I was very much in love. I have been in love\r\nmany times, but this was the most serious of all. It is a thing of\r\nthe past; she has married daughters now. It was Varinka B----.\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan\r\nVasilievich mentioned her surname. \xe2\x80\x9cEven at fifty she is remarkably\r\nhandsome; but in her youth, at eighteen, she was exquisite--tall,\r\nslender, graceful, and stately. Yes, stately is the word; she held\r\nherself very erect, by instinct as it were; and carried her head high,\r\nand that together with her beauty and height gave her a queenly air in\r\nspite of being thin, even bony one might say. It might indeed have\r\nbeen deterring had it not been for her smile, which was always gay and\r\ncordial, and for the charming light in her eyes and for her youthful\r\nsweetness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an entrancing description you give, Ivan Vasilievich!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDescription, indeed! I could not possibly describe her so that you\r\ncould appreciate her. But that does not matter; what I am going to\r\ntell you happened in the forties. I was at that time a student in a\r\nprovincial university. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it was a good thing or no,\r\nbut we had no political clubs, no theories in our universities then.\r\nWe were simply young and spent our time as young men do, studying and\r\namusing ourselves. I was a very gay, lively, careless fellow, and had\r\nplenty of money too. I had a fine horse, and used to go tobogganing\r\nwith the young ladies. Skating had not yet come into fashion. I went to\r\ndrinking parties with my comrades--in those days we drank nothing but\r\nchampagne--if we had no champagne we drank nothing at all. We never\r\ndrank vodka, as they do now. Evening parties and balls were my favourite\r\namusements. I danced well, and was not an ugly fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, there is no need to be modest,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted a lady near him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have seen your photograph. Not ugly, indeed! You were a handsome\r\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome, if you like. That does not matter. When my love for her was\r\nat its strongest, on the last day of the carnival, I was at a ball at\r\nthe provincial marshal\xe2\x80\x99s, a good-natured old man, rich and hospitable,\r\nand a court chamberlain. The guests were welcomed by his wife, who was\r\nas good-natured as himself. She was dressed in puce-coloured velvet, and\r\nhad a diamond diadem on her forehead, and her plump, old white shoulders\r\nand bosom were bare like the portraits of Empress Elizabeth, the\r\ndaughter of Peter the Great.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a delightful ball. It was a splendid room, with a gallery for\r\nthe orchestra, which was famous at the time, and consisted of serfs\r\nbelonging to a musical landowner. The refreshments were magnificent, and\r\nthe champagne flowed in rivers. Though I was fond of champagne I did not\r\ndrink that night, because without it I was drunk with love. But I made\r\nup for it by dancing waltzes and polkas till I was ready to drop--of\r\ncourse, whenever possible, with Varinka. She wore a white dress with a\r\npink sash, white shoes, and white kid gloves, which did not quite reach\r\nto her thin pointed elbows. A disgusting engineer named Anisimov robbed\r\nme of the mazurka with her--to this day I cannot forgive him. He asked\r\nher for the dance the minute she arrived, while I had driven to the\r\nhair-dresser\xe2\x80\x99s to get a pair of gloves, and was late. So I did not dance\r\nthe mazurka with her, but with a German girl to whom I had previously\r\npaid a little attention; but I am afraid I did not behave very politely\r\nto her that evening. I hardly spoke or looked at her, and saw nothing\r\nbut the tall, slender figure in a white dress, with a pink sash, a\r\nflushed, beaming, dimpled face, and sweet, kind eyes. I was not alone;\r\nthey were all looking at her with admiration, the men and women alike,\r\nalthough she outshone all of them. They could not help admiring her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I was not nominally her partner for the mazurka, I did as a\r\nmatter of fact dance nearly the whole time with her. She always came\r\nforward boldly the whole length of the room to pick me out. I flew to\r\nmeet her without waiting to be chosen, and she thanked me with a smile\r\nfor my intuition. When I was brought up to her with somebody else, and\r\nshe guessed wrongly, she took the other man\xe2\x80\x99s hand with a shrug of her\r\nslim shoulders, and smiled at me regretfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever there was a waltz figure in the mazurka, I waltzed with\r\nher for a long time, and breathing fast and smiling, she would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Encore\xe2\x80\x99; and I went on waltzing and waltzing, as though unconscious of\r\nany bodily existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, how could you be unconscious of it with your arm round her\r\nwaist? You must have been conscious, not only of your own existence, but\r\nof hers,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the party.\r\n\r\nIvan Vasilievich cried out, almost shouting in anger: \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are,\r\nmoderns all over! Nowadays you think of nothing but the body. It was\r\ndifferent in our day. The more I was in love the less corporeal was she\r\nin my eyes. Nowadays you think of nothing but the body. It was different\r\nin our day. The more I was in love the less corporeal was she in my\r\neyes. Nowadays you set legs, ankles, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. You undress\r\nthe women you are in love with. In my eyes, as Alphonse Karr said--and\r\nhe was a good writer--\xe2\x80\x99 the one I loved was always draped in robes of\r\nbronze.\xe2\x80\x99 We never thought of doing so; we tried to veil her nakedness,\r\nlike Noah\xe2\x80\x99s good-natured son. Oh, well, you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pay any attention to him. Go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I danced for the most part with her, and did not notice how time\r\nwas passing. The musicians kept playing the same mazurka tunes over and\r\nover again in desperate exhaustion--you know what it is towards the end\r\nof a ball. Papas and mammas were already getting up from the card-tables\r\nin the drawing-room in expectation of supper, the men-servants were\r\nrunning to and fro bringing in things. It was nearly three o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nI had to make the most of the last minutes. I chose her again for the\r\nmazurka, and for the hundredth time we danced across the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The quadrille after supper is mine,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, taking her to her place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Of course, if I am not carried off home,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t give you up,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Give me my fan, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I am so sorry to part with it,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, handing her a cheap white fan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s something to console you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, plucking a feather\r\nout of the fan, and giving it to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took the feather, and could only express my rapture and gratitude\r\nwith my eyes. I was not only pleased and gay, I was happy, delighted;\r\nI was good, I was not myself but some being not of this earth, knowing\r\nnothing of evil. I hid the feather in my glove, and stood there unable\r\nto tear myself away from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Look, they are urging father to dance,\xe2\x80\x99 she said to me, pointing\r\nto the tall, stately figure of her father, a colonel with silver\r\nepaulettes, who was standing in the doorway with some ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Varinka, come here!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed our hostess, the lady with the diamond\r\nferronniere and with shoulders like Elizabeth, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Varinka went to the door, and I followed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Persuade your father to dance the mazurka with you, ma chere.--Do,\r\nplease, Peter Valdislavovich,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, turning to the colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVarinka\xe2\x80\x99s father was a very handsome, well-preserved old man. He had\r\na good colour, moustaches curled in the style of Nicolas I., and\r\nwhite whiskers which met the moustaches. His hair was combed on to his\r\nforehead, and a bright smile, like his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s, was on his lips and\r\nin his eyes. He was splendidly set up, with a broad military chest, on\r\nwhich he wore some decorations, and he had powerful shoulders and long\r\nslim legs. He was that ultra-military type produced by the discipline of\r\nEmperor Nicolas I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we approached the door the colonel was just refusing to dance,\r\nsaying that he had quite forgotten how; but at that instant he smiled,\r\nswung his arm gracefully around to the left, drew his sword from its\r\nsheath, handed it to an obliging young man who stood near, and smoothed\r\nhis suede glove on his right hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Everything must be done according to rule,\xe2\x80\x99 he said with a smile. He\r\ntook the hand of his daughter, and stood one-quarter turned, waiting for\r\nthe music.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the first sound of the mazurka, he stamped one foot smartly, threw\r\nthe other forward, and, at first slowly and smoothly, then buoyantly\r\nand impetuously, with stamping of feet and clicking of boots, his tall,\r\nimposing figure moved the length of the room. Varinka swayed gracefully\r\nbeside him, rhythmically and easily, making her steps short or long,\r\nwith her little feet in their white satin slippers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the people in the room followed every movement of the couple. As\r\nfor me I not only admired, I regarded them with enraptured sympathy. I\r\nwas particularly impressed with the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s boots. They were\r\nnot the modern pointed affairs, but were made of cheap leather,\r\nsquared-toed, and evidently built by the regimental cobbler. In order\r\nthat his daughter might dress and go out in society, he did not buy\r\nfashionable boots, but wore home-made ones, I thought, and his square\r\ntoes seemed to me most touching. It was obvious that in his time he\r\nhad been a good dancer; but now he was too heavy, and his legs had not\r\nspring enough for all the beautiful steps he tried to take. Still, he\r\ncontrived to go twice round the room. When at the end, standing with\r\nlegs apart, he suddenly clicked his feet together and fell on one\r\nknee, a bit heavily, and she danced gracefully around him, smiling and\r\nadjusting her skirt, the whole room applauded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRising with an effort, he tenderly took his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s face between his\r\nhands. He kissed her on the forehead, and brought her to me, under the\r\nimpression that I was her partner for the mazurka. I said I was not.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, never mind, just go around the room once with her,\xe2\x80\x99 he said,\r\nsmiling kindly, as he replaced his sword in the sheath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the contents of a bottle flow readily when the first drop has been\r\npoured, so my love for Varinka seemed to set free the whole force of\r\nloving within me. In surrounding her it embraced the world. I loved\r\nthe hostess with her diadem and her shoulders like Elizabeth, and her\r\nhusband and her guests and her footmen, and even the engineer Anisimov\r\nwho felt peevish towards me. As for Varinka\xe2\x80\x99s father, with his home-made\r\nboots and his kind smile, so like her own, I felt a sort of tenderness\r\nfor him that was almost rapture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter supper I danced the promised quadrille with her, and though I had\r\nbeen infinitely happy before, I grew still happier every moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not speak of love. I neither asked myself nor her whether she\r\nloved me. It was quite enough to know that I loved her. And I had only\r\none fear--that something might come to interfere with my great joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I went home, and began to undress for the night, I found it quite\r\nout of the question. I held the little feather out of her fan in my hand,\r\nand one of her gloves which she gave me when I helped her into the\r\ncarriage after her mother. Looking at these things, and without closing\r\nmy eyes I could see her before me as she was for an instant when she had\r\nto choose between two partners. She tried to guess what kind of person\r\nwas represented in me, and I could hear her sweet voice as she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pride--am I right?\xe2\x80\x99 and merrily gave me her hand. At supper she took\r\nthe first sip from my glass of champagne, looking at me over the rim\r\nwith her caressing glance. But, plainest of all, I could see her as she\r\ndanced with her father, gliding along beside him, and looking at the\r\nadmiring observers with pride and happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and she were united in my mind in one rush of pathetic tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was living then with my brother, who has since died. He disliked\r\ngoing out, and never went to dances; and besides, he was busy preparing\r\nfor his last university examinations, and was leading a very regular\r\nlife. He was asleep. I looked at him, his head buried in the pillow and\r\nhalf covered with the quilt; and I affectionately pitied him, pitied him\r\nfor his ignorance of the bliss I was experiencing. Our serf Petrusha\r\nhad met me with a candle, ready to undress me, but I sent him away. His\r\nsleepy face and tousled hair seemed to me so touching. Trying not to\r\nmake a noise, I went to my room on tiptoe and sat down on my bed. No, I\r\nwas too happy; I could not sleep. Besides, it was too hot in the rooms.\r\nWithout taking off my uniform, I went quietly into the hall, put on my\r\novercoat, opened the front door and stepped out into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was after four when I had left the ball; going home and stopping\r\nthere a while had occupied two hours, so by the time I went out it\r\nwas dawn. It was regular carnival weather--foggy, and the road full\r\nof water-soaked snow just melting, and water dripping from the eaves.\r\nVarinka\xe2\x80\x99s family lived on the edge of town near a large field, one end\r\nof which was a parade ground: at the other end was a boarding-school for\r\nyoung ladies. I passed through our empty little street and came to the\r\nmain thoroughfare, where I met pedestrians and sledges laden with\r\nwood, the runners grating the road. The horses swung with regular paces\r\nbeneath their shining yokes, their backs covered with straw mats\r\nand their heads wet with rain; while the drivers, in enormous boots,\r\nsplashed through the mud beside the sledges. All this, the very\r\nhorses themselves, seemed to me stimulating and fascinating, full of\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I approached the field near their house, I saw at one end of it,\r\nin the direction of the parade ground, something very huge and black,\r\nand I heard sounds of fife and drum proceeding from it. My heart had\r\nbeen full of song, and I had heard in imagination the tune of the\r\nmazurka, but this was very harsh music. It was not pleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What can that be?\xe2\x80\x99 I thought, and went towards the sound by a slippery\r\npath through the centre of the field. Walking about a hundred paces,\r\nI began to distinguish many black objects through the mist. They were\r\nevidently soldiers. \xe2\x80\x98It is probably a drill,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I went along in that direction in company with a blacksmith, who\r\nwore a dirty coat and an apron, and was carrying something. He walked\r\nahead of me as we approached the place. The soldiers in black uniforms\r\nstood in two rows, facing each other motionless, their guns at rest.\r\nBehind them stood the fifes and drums, incessantly repeating the same\r\nunpleasant tune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What are they doing?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked the blacksmith, who halted at my side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A Tartar is being beaten through the ranks for his attempt to desert,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the blacksmith in an angry tone, as he looked intently at the far\r\nend of the line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked in the same direction, and saw between the files something\r\nhorrid approaching me. The thing that approached was a man, stripped\r\nto the waist, fastened with cords to the guns of two soldiers who were\r\nleading him. At his side an officer in overcoat and cap was walking,\r\nwhose figure had a familiar look. The victim advanced under the blows\r\nthat rained upon him from both sides, his whole body plunging, his\r\nfeet dragging through the snow. Now he threw himself backward, and the\r\nsubalterns who led him thrust him forward. Now he fell forward, and they\r\npulled him up short; while ever at his side marched the tall officer,\r\nwith firm and nervous pace. It was Varinka\xe2\x80\x99s father, with his rosy face\r\nand white moustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt each stroke the man, as if amazed, turned his face, grimacing with\r\npain, towards the side whence the blow came, and showing his white teeth\r\nrepeated the same words over and over. But I could only hear what the\r\nwords were when he came quite near. He did not speak them, he sobbed\r\nthem out,--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Brothers, have mercy on me! Brothers, have mercy on me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut the brothers had, no mercy, and when the procession came close to\r\nme, I saw how a soldier who stood opposite me took a firm step forward\r\nand lifting his stick with a whirr, brought it down upon the man\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\nThe man plunged forward, but the subalterns pulled him back, and another\r\nblow came down from the other side, then from this side and then from\r\nthe other. The colonel marched beside him, and looking now at his feet\r\nand now at the man, inhaled the air, puffed out his cheeks, and breathed\r\nit out between his protruded lips. When they passed the place where I\r\nstood, I caught a glimpse between the two files of the back of the man\r\nthat was being punished. It was something so many-coloured, wet, red,\r\nunnatural, that I could hardly believe it was a human body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My God!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 muttered the blacksmith.\r\n\r\nThe procession moved farther away. The blows continued to rain upon the\r\nwrithing, falling creature; the fifes shrilled and the drums beat, and\r\nthe tall imposing figure of the colonel moved along-side the man, just\r\nas before. Then, suddenly, the colonel stopped, and rapidly approached a\r\nman in the ranks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to hit him gently,\xe2\x80\x99 I heard his furious voice say.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you pat him like that? Will you?\xe2\x80\x99 and I saw how his strong hand\r\nin the suede glove struck the weak, bloodless, terrified soldier for not\r\nbringing down his stick with sufficient strength on the red neck of the\r\nTartar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Bring new sticks!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, and looking round, he saw me. Assuming\r\nan air of not knowing me, and with a ferocious, angry frown, he hastily\r\nturned away. I felt so utterly ashamed that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where to look.\r\nIt was as if I had been detected in a disgraceful act. I dropped my\r\neyes, and quickly hurried home. All the way I had the drums beating and\r\nthe fifes whistling in my ears. And I heard the words, \xe2\x80\x98Brothers, have\r\nmercy on me!\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Will you pat him? Will you?\xe2\x80\x99 My heart was full of\r\nphysical disgust that was almost sickness. So much so that I halted\r\nseveral times on my way, for I had the feeling that I was going to be\r\nreally sick from all the horrors that possessed me at that sight. I do\r\nnot remember how I got home and got to bed. But the moment I was about\r\nto fall asleep I heard and saw again all that had happened, and I sprang\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Evidently he knows something I do not know,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought about\r\nthe colonel. \xe2\x80\x98If I knew what he knows I should certainly\r\ngrasp--understand--what I have just seen, and it would not cause me such\r\nsuffering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut however much I thought about it, I could not understand the thing\r\nthat the colonel knew. It was evening before I could get to sleep,\r\nand then only after calling on a friend and drinking till I; was quite\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I had come to the conclusion that the deed I had witnessed\r\nwas wicked? Oh, no. Since it was done with such assurance, and was\r\nrecognised by every one as indispensable, they doubtless knew something\r\nwhich I did not know. So I thought, and tried to understand. But no\r\nmatter, I could never understand it, then or afterwards. And not being\r\nable to grasp it, I could not enter the service as I had intended. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean only the military service: I did not enter the Civil Service\r\neither. And so I have been of no use whatever, as you can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we know how useless you\xe2\x80\x99ve been,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of us. \xe2\x80\x9cTell us,\r\nrather, how many people would be of any use at all if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s utter nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan Vasilievich, with genuine\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; and what about the love affair?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy love? It decreased from that day. When, as often happened, she\r\nlooked dreamy and meditative, I instantly recollected the colonel on the\r\nparade ground, and I felt so awkward and uncomfortable that I began to\r\nsee her less frequently. So my love came to naught. Yes; such chances\r\narise, and they alter and direct a man\xe2\x80\x99s whole life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in summing\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you say . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALYOSHA THE POT\r\n\r\nALYOSHA was the younger brother. He was called the Pot, because his\r\nmother had once sent him with a pot of milk to the deacon\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and he\r\nhad stumbled against something and broken it. His mother had beaten him,\r\nand the children had teased him. Since then he was nicknamed the Pot.\r\nAlyosha was a tiny, thin little fellow, with ears like wings, and a huge\r\nnose. \xe2\x80\x9cAlyosha has a nose that looks like a dog on a hill!\xe2\x80\x9d the children\r\nused to call after him. Alyosha went to the village school, but was not\r\ngood at lessons; besides, there was so little time to learn. His elder\r\nbrother was in town, working for a merchant, so Alyosha had to help his\r\nfather from a very early age. When he was no more than six he used to\r\ngo out with the girls to watch the cows and sheep in the pasture, and\r\na little later he looked after the horses by day and by night. And at\r\ntwelve years of age he had already begun to plough and to drive the\r\ncart. The skill was there though the strength was not. He was always\r\ncheerful. Whenever the children made fun of him, he would either laugh\r\nor be silent. When his father scolded him he would stand mute and listen\r\nattentively, and as soon as the scolding was over would smile and go\r\non with his work. Alyosha was nineteen when his brother was taken as a\r\nsoldier. So his father placed him with the merchant as a yard-porter.\r\nHe was given his brother\xe2\x80\x99s old boots, his father\xe2\x80\x99s old coat and cap,\r\nand was taken to town. Alyosha was delighted with his clothes, but the\r\nmerchant was not impressed by his appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you would bring me a man in Simeon\xe2\x80\x99s place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nscanning Alyosha; \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99ve brought me THIS! What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can do everything; look after horses and drive. He\xe2\x80\x99s a good one\r\nto work. He looks rather thin, but he\xe2\x80\x99s tough enough. And he\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nwilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks it. All right; we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what we can do with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Alyosha remained at the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe family was not a large one. It consisted of the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s wife:\r\nher old mother: a married son poorly educated who was in his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness: another son, a learned one who had finished school and entered\r\nthe University, but having been expelled, was living at home: and a\r\ndaughter who still went to school.\r\n\r\nThey did not take to Alyosha at first. He was uncouth, badly dressed,\r\nand had no manner, but they soon got used to him. Alyosha worked even\r\nbetter than his brother had done; he was really very willing. They sent\r\nhim on all sorts of errands, but he did everything quickly and readily,\r\ngoing from one task to another without stopping. And so here, just as at\r\nhome, all the work was put upon his shoulders. The more he did, the more\r\nhe was given to do. His mistress, her old mother, the son, the daughter,\r\nthe clerk, and the cook--all ordered him about, and sent him from one\r\nplace to another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlyosha, do this! Alyosha, do that! What! have you forgotten, Alyosha?\r\nMind you don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, Alyosha!\xe2\x80\x9d was heard from morning till night. And\r\nAlyosha ran here, looked after this and that, forgot nothing, found time\r\nfor everything, and was always cheerful.\r\n\r\nHis brother\xe2\x80\x99s old boots were soon worn out, and his master scolded\r\nhim for going about in tatters with his toes sticking out. He ordered\r\nanother pair to be bought for him in the market. Alyosha was delighted\r\nwith his new boots, but was angry with his feet when they ached at the\r\nend of the day after so much running about. And then he was afraid that\r\nhis father would be annoyed when he came to town for his wages, to find\r\nthat his master had deducted the cost of the boots.\r\n\r\nIn the winter Alyosha used to get up before daybreak. He would chop the\r\nwood, sweep the yard, feed the cows and horses, light the stoves, clean\r\nthe boots, prepare the samovars and polish them afterwards; or the clerk\r\nwould get him to bring up the goods; or the cook would set him to knead\r\nthe bread and clean the saucepans. Then he was sent to town on various\r\nerrands, to bring the daughter home from school, or to get some olive\r\noil for the old mother. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the devil have you been so long?\xe2\x80\x9d first\r\none, then another, would say to him. Why should they go? Alyosha can go.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlyosha! Alyosha!\xe2\x80\x9d And Alyosha ran here and there. He breakfasted in\r\nsnatches while he was working, and rarely managed to get his dinner at\r\nthe proper hour. The cook used to scold him for being late, but she was\r\nsorry for him all the same, and would keep something hot for his dinner\r\nand supper.\r\n\r\nAt holiday times there was more work than ever, but Alyosha liked\r\nholidays because everybody gave him a tip. Not much certainly, but it\r\nwould amount up to about sixty kopeks [1s 2d]--his very own money. For\r\nAlyosha never set eyes on his wages. His father used to come and take\r\nthem from the merchant, and only scold Alyosha for wearing out his\r\nboots.\r\n\r\nWhen he had saved up two roubles [4s], by the advice of the cook he\r\nbought himself a red knitted jacket, and was so happy when he put it\r\non, that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t close his mouth for joy. Alyosha was not talkative;\r\nwhen he spoke at all, he spoke abruptly, with his head turned away.\r\nWhen told to do anything, or asked if he could do it, he would say yes\r\nwithout the smallest hesitation, and set to work at once.\r\n\r\nAlyosha did not know any prayer; and had forgotten what his mother\r\nhad taught him. But he prayed just the same, every morning and every\r\nevening, prayed with his hands, crossing himself.\r\n\r\nHe lived like this for about a year and a half, and towards the end of\r\nthe second year a most startling thing happened to him. He discovered\r\none day, to his great surprise, that, in addition to the relation of\r\nusefulness existing between people, there was also another, a peculiar\r\nrelation of quite a different character. Instead of a man being wanted\r\nto clean boots, and go on errands and harness horses, he is not wanted\r\nto be of any service at all, but another human being wants to serve him\r\nand pet him. Suddenly Alyosha felt he was such a man.\r\n\r\nHe made this discovery through the cook Ustinia. She was young, had no\r\nparents, and worked as hard as Alyosha. He felt for the first time in\r\nhis life that he--not his services, but he himself--was necessary to\r\nanother human being. When his mother used to be sorry for him, he had\r\ntaken no notice of her. It had seemed to him quite natural, as though\r\nhe were feeling sorry for himself. But here was Ustinia, a perfect\r\nstranger, and sorry for him. She would save him some hot porridge, and\r\nsit watching him, her chin propped on her bare arm, with the sleeve\r\nrolled up, while he was eating it. When he looked at her she would begin\r\nto laugh, and he would laugh too.\r\n\r\nThis was such a new, strange thing to him that it frightened Alyosha.\r\nHe feared that it might interfere with his work. But he was pleased,\r\nnevertheless, and when he glanced at the trousers that Ustinia had\r\nmended for him, he would shake his head and smile. He would often\r\nthink of her while at work, or when running on errands. \xe2\x80\x9cA fine girl,\r\nUstinia!\xe2\x80\x9d he sometimes exclaimed.\r\n\r\nUstinia used to help him whenever she could, and he helped her. She told\r\nhim all about her life; how she had lost her parents; how her aunt had\r\ntaken her in and found a place for her in the town; how the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson had tried to take liberties with her, and how she had rebuffed him.\r\nShe liked to talk, and Alyosha liked to listen to her. He had heard\r\nthat peasants who came up to work in the towns frequently got married\r\nto servant girls. On one occasion she asked him if his parents intended\r\nmarrying him soon. He said that he did not know; that he did not want to\r\nmarry any of the village girls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you taken a fancy to some one, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would marry you, if you\xe2\x80\x99d be willing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along with you, Alyosha the Pot; but you\xe2\x80\x99ve found your tongue,\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, slapping him on the back with a towel she\r\nheld in her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt Shrovetide Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99s father came to town for his wages. It had come\r\nto the ears of the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s wife that Alyosha wanted to marry Ustinia,\r\nand she disapproved of it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will be the use of her with a baby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she thought, and informed her husband.\r\n\r\nThe merchant gave the old man Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99s wages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is my lad getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you he was willing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, as far as it goes, but he\xe2\x80\x99s taken some sort of\r\nnonsense into his head. He wants to marry our cook. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t approve\r\nof married servants. We won\xe2\x80\x99t have them in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, who would have thought the fool would think of such a\r\nthing?\xe2\x80\x9d the old man exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon settle\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went into the kitchen, and sat down at the table waiting for his son.\r\nAlyosha was out on an errand, and came back breathless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had some sense in you; but what\xe2\x80\x99s this you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken into\r\nyour head?\xe2\x80\x9d his father began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, nothing? They tell me you want to get married. You shall get\r\nmarried when the time comes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll find you a decent wife, not some town\r\nhussy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father talked and talked, while Alyosha stood still and sighed. When\r\nhis father had quite finished, Alyosha smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll drop it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s what I call sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was left alone with Ustinia he told her what his father had\r\nsaid. (She had listened at the door.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good; it can\xe2\x80\x99t come off. Did you hear? He was angry--won\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nit at any price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUstinia cried into her apron.\r\n\r\nAlyosha shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? We must do as we\xe2\x80\x99re told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you going to give up that nonsense, as your father told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n his mistress asked, as he was putting up the shutters in the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure we are,\xe2\x80\x9d Alyosha replied with a smile, and then burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nFrom that day Alyosha went about his work as usual, and no longer talked\r\nto Ustinia about their getting married. One day in Lent the clerk told\r\nhim to clear the snow from the roof. Alyosha climbed on to the roof and\r\nswept away all the snow; and, while he was still raking out some frozen\r\nlumps from the gutter, his foot slipped and he fell over. Unfortunately\r\nhe did not fall on the snow, but on a piece of iron over the door.\r\nUstinia came running up, together with the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you hurt yourself, Alyosha?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! no, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he could not raise himself when he tried to, and began to smile.\r\n\r\nHe was taken into the lodge. The doctor arrived, examined him, and asked\r\nwhere he felt the pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel it all over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99m only afraid\r\nmaster will be annoyed. Father ought to be told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlyosha lay in bed for two days, and on the third day they sent for the\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really going to die?\xe2\x80\x9d Ustinia asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am. You can\xe2\x80\x99t go on living for ever. You must go when the\r\ntime comes.\xe2\x80\x9d Alyosha spoke rapidly as usual. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Ustinia. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen very good to me. What a lucky thing they didn\xe2\x80\x99t let us marry! Where\r\nshould we have been now? It\xe2\x80\x99s much better as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the priest came, he prayed with his bands and with his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nit is good here when you obey and do no harm to others, so it will be\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d was the thought within it.\r\n\r\nHe spoke very little; he only said he was thirsty, and he seemed full of\r\nwonder at something.\r\n\r\nHe lay in wonderment, then stretched himself, and died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DREAM\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a daughter she no longer exists for me. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you understand? She\r\nsimply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. Still, I cannot possibly leave her to the charity\r\nof strangers. I will arrange things so that she can live as she pleases,\r\nbut I do not wish to hear of her. Who would ever have thought . . . the\r\nhorror of it, the horror of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, and raised his eyes. These\r\nwords were spoken by Prince Michael Ivanovich to his brother Peter, who\r\nwas governor of a province in Central Russia. Prince Peter was a man of\r\nfifty, Michael\xe2\x80\x99s junior by ten years.\r\n\r\nOn discovering that his daughter, who had left his house a year before,\r\nhad settled here with her child, the elder brother had come from St.\r\nPetersburg to the provincial town, where the above conversation took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nPrince Michael Ivanovich was a tall, handsome, white-haired, fresh\r\ncoloured man, proud and attractive in appearance and bearing. His family\r\nconsisted of a vulgar, irritable wife, who wrangled with him continually\r\nover every petty detail, a son, a ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-well, spendthrift and\r\nroue--yet a \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d according to his father\xe2\x80\x99s code, two daughters,\r\nof whom the elder had married well, and was living in St. Petersburg;\r\nand the younger, Lisa--his favourite, who had disappeared from home a\r\nyear before. Only a short while ago he had found her with her child in\r\nthis provincial town.\r\n\r\nPrince Peter wanted to ask his brother how, and under what\r\ncircumstances, Lisa had left home, and who could possibly be the father\r\nof her child. But he could not make up his mind to inquire.\r\n\r\nThat very morning, when his wife had attempted to condole with her\r\nbrother-in-law, Prince Peter had observed a look of pain on his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s face. The look had at once been masked by an expression of\r\nunapproachable pride, and he had begun to question her about their flat,\r\nand the price she paid. At luncheon, before the family and guests, he\r\nhad been witty and sarcastic as usual. Towards every one, excepting the\r\nchildren, whom he treated with almost reverent tenderness, he adopted an\r\nattitude of distant hauteur. And yet it was so natural to him that every\r\none somehow acknowledged his right to be haughty.\r\n\r\nIn the evening his brother arranged a game of whist. When he retired to\r\nthe room which had been made ready for him, and was just beginning to\r\ntake out his artificial teeth, some one tapped lightly on the door with\r\ntwo fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est moi, Michael.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince Michael Ivanovich recognised the voice of his sister-in-law,\r\nfrowned, replaced his teeth, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Aloud he said, \xe2\x80\x9cEntrez.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sister-in-law was a quiet, gentle creature, who bowed in submission\r\nto her husband\xe2\x80\x99s will. But to many she seemed a crank, and some did not\r\nhesitate to call her a fool. She was pretty, but her hair was always\r\ncarelessly dressed, and she herself was untidy and absent-minded. She\r\nhad, also, the strangest, most unaristocratic ideas, by no means fitting\r\nin the wife of a high official. These ideas she would express most\r\nunexpectedly, to everybody\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, her husband\xe2\x80\x99s no less than\r\nher friends\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFous pouvez me renvoyer, mais je ne m\xe2\x80\x99en irai pas, je vous le dis\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99avance,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, in her characteristic, indifferent way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDieu preserve,\xe2\x80\x9d answered her brother-in-law, with his usual somewhat\r\nexaggerated politeness, and brought forward a chair for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCa ne vous derange pas?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, taking out a cigarette. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot going to say anything unpleasant, Michael. I only wanted to say\r\nsomething about Lisochka.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMichael Ivanovich sighed--the word pained him; but mastering himself at\r\nonce, he answered with a tired smile. \xe2\x80\x9cOur conversation can only be\r\non one subject, and that is the subject you wish to discuss.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke\r\nwithout looking at her, and avoided even naming the subject. But his\r\nplump, pretty little sister-in-law was unabashed. She continued to\r\nregard him with the same gentle, imploring look in her blue eyes,\r\nsighing even more deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael, mon bon ami, have pity on her. She is only human.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never doubted that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Ivanovich with a bitter smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is your daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was--but my dear Aline, why talk about this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael, dear, won\xe2\x80\x99t you see her? I only wanted to say, that the one\r\nwho is to blame--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince Michael Ivanovich flushed; his face became cruel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, let us stop. I have suffered enough. I have now but\r\none desire, and that is to put her in such a position that she will\r\nbe independent of others, and that she shall have no further need of\r\ncommunicating with me. Then she can live her own life, and my family and\r\nI need know nothing more about her. That is all I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael, you say nothing but \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99! She, too, is \xe2\x80\x98I.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt; but, dear Aline, please let us drop the matter. I feel it too\r\ndeeply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexandra Dmitrievna remained silent for a few moments, shaking her\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Masha, your wife, thinks as you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexandra Dmitrievna made an inarticulate sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrisons la dessus et bonne nuit,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. But she did not go. She\r\nstood silent a moment. Then,--\xe2\x80\x9cPeter tells me you intend to leave the\r\nmoney with the woman where she lives. Have you the address?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave it with the woman, Michael! Go yourself. Just see how she\r\nlives. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see her, you need not. HE isn\xe2\x80\x99t there; there\r\nis no one there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMichael Ivanovich shuddered violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you torture me so? It\xe2\x80\x99s a sin against hospitality!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexandra Dmitrievna rose, and almost in tears, being touched by her own\r\npleading, said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is so miserable, but she is such a dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up, and stood waiting for her to finish. She held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael, you do wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, and left him.\r\n\r\nFor a long while after she had gone Michael Ivanovich walked to and fro\r\non the square of carpet. He frowned and shivered, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\noh!\xe2\x80\x9d And then the sound of his own voice frightened him, and he was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nHis wounded pride tortured him. His daughter--his--brought up in the\r\nhouse of her mother, the famous Avdotia Borisovna, whom the Empress\r\nhonoured with her visits, and acquaintance with whom was an honour for\r\nall the world! His daughter--; and he had lived his life as a knight of\r\nold, knowing neither fear nor blame. The fact that he had a natural son\r\nborn of a Frenchwoman, whom he had settled abroad, did not lower his\r\nown self-esteem. And now this daughter, for whom he had not only done\r\neverything that a father could and should do; this daughter to whom he\r\nhad given a splendid education and every opportunity to make a match in\r\nthe best Russian society--this daughter to whom he had not only given\r\nall that a girl could desire, but whom he had really LOVED; whom he had\r\nadmired, been proud of--this daughter had repaid him with such disgrace,\r\nthat he was ashamed and could not face the eyes of men!\r\n\r\nHe recalled the time when she was not merely his child, and a member of\r\nhis family, but his darling, his joy and his pride. He saw her again, a\r\nlittle thing of eight or nine, bright, intelligent, lively, impetuous,\r\ngraceful, with brilliant black eyes and flowing auburn hair. He\r\nremembered how she used to jump up on his knees and hug him, and tickle\r\nhis neck; and how she would laugh, regardless of his protests, and\r\ncontinue to tickle him, and kiss his lips, his eyes, and his cheeks.\r\nHe was naturally opposed to all demonstration, but this impetuous love\r\nmoved him, and he often submitted to her petting. He remembered also how\r\nsweet it was to caress her. To remember all this, when that sweet child\r\nhad become what she now was, a creature of whom he could not think\r\nwithout loathing.\r\n\r\nHe also recalled the time when she was growing into womanhood, and the\r\ncurious feeling of fear and anger that he experienced when he became\r\naware that men regarded her as a woman. He thought of his jealous love\r\nwhen she came coquettishly to him dressed for a ball, and knowing that\r\nshe was pretty. He dreaded the passionate glances which fell upon her,\r\nthat she not only did not understand but rejoiced in. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat superstition of woman\xe2\x80\x99s purity! Quite the contrary, they do not\r\nknow shame--they lack this sense.\xe2\x80\x9d He remembered how, quite inexplicably\r\nto him, she had refused two very good suitors. She had become more and\r\nmore fascinated by her own success in the round of gaieties she lived\r\nin.\r\n\r\nBut this success could not last long. A year passed, then two, then\r\nthree. She was a familiar figure, beautiful--but her first youth had\r\npassed, and she had become somehow part of the ball-room furniture.\r\nMichael Ivanovich remembered how he had realised that she was on the\r\nroad to spinsterhood, and desired but one thing for her. He must get her\r\nmarried off as quickly as possible, perhaps not quite so well as might\r\nhave been arranged earlier, but still a respectable match.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed to him she had behaved with a pride that bordered on\r\ninsolence. Remembering this, his anger rose more and more fiercely\r\nagainst her. To think of her refusing so many decent men, only to end in\r\nthis disgrace. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned again.\r\n\r\nThen stopping, he lit a cigarette, and tried to think of other things.\r\nHe would send her money, without ever letting her see him. But memories\r\ncame again. He remembered--it was not so very long ago, for she was more\r\nthan twenty then--her beginning a flirtation with a boy of fourteen,\r\na cadet of the Corps of Pages who had been staying with them in\r\nthe country. She had driven the boy half crazy; he had wept in his\r\ndistraction. Then how she had rebuked her father severely, coldly, and\r\neven rudely, when, to put an end to this stupid affair, he had sent the\r\nboy away. She seemed somehow to consider herself insulted. Since then\r\nfather and daughter had drifted into undisguised hostility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a wicked and shameless\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, as a last ghastly memory, there was the letter from Moscow,\r\nin which she wrote that she could not return home; that she was a\r\nmiserable, abandoned woman, asking only to be forgiven and forgotten.\r\nThen the horrid recollection of the scene with his wife came to him;\r\ntheir surmises and their suspicions, which became a certainty. The\r\ncalamity had happened in Finland, where they had let her visit her aunt;\r\nand the culprit was an insignificant Swede, a student, an empty-headed,\r\nworthless creature--and married.\r\n\r\nAll this came back to him now as he paced backwards and forwards on the\r\nbedroom carpet, recollecting his former love for her, his pride in\r\nher. He recoiled with terror before the incomprehensible fact of\r\nher downfall, and he hated her for the agony she was causing him. He\r\nremembered the conversation with his sister-in-law, and tried to imagine\r\nhow he might forgive her. But as soon as the thought of \xe2\x80\x9chim\xe2\x80\x9d arose,\r\nthere surged up in his heart horror, disgust, and wounded pride. He\r\ngroaned aloud, and tried to think of something else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is impossible; I will hand over the money to Peter to give her\r\nmonthly. And as for me, I have no longer a daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again a curious feeling overpowered him: a mixture of self-pity\r\nat the recollection of his love for her, and of fury against her for\r\ncausing him this anguish.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDURING the last year Lisa had without doubt lived through more than in\r\nall the preceding twenty-five. Suddenly she had realised the emptiness\r\nof her whole life. It rose before her, base and sordid--this life at\r\nhome and among the rich set in St. Petersburg--this animal existence\r\nthat never sounded the depths, but only touched the shallows of life.\r\n\r\nIt was well enough for a year or two, or perhaps even three. But when it\r\nwent on for seven or eight years, with its parties, balls, concerts, and\r\nsuppers; with its costumes and coiffures to display the charms of the\r\nbody; with its adorers old and young, all alike seemingly possessed of\r\nsome unaccountable right to have everything, to laugh at everything; and\r\nwith its summer months spent in the same way, everything yielding but a\r\nsuperficial pleasure, even music and reading merely touching upon life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproblems, but never solving them--all this holding out no promise of\r\nchange, and losing its charm more and more--she began to despair. She\r\nhad desperate moods when she longed to die.\r\n\r\nHer friends directed her thoughts to charity. On the one hand, she\r\nsaw poverty which was real and repulsive, and a sham poverty even more\r\nrepulsive and pitiable; on the other, she saw the terrible indifference\r\nof the lady patronesses who came in carriages and gowns worth thousands.\r\nLife became to her more and more unbearable. She yearned for something\r\nreal, for life itself--not this playing at living, not this skimming\r\nlife of its cream. Of real life there was none. The best of her memories\r\nwas her love for the little cadet Koko. That had been a good, honest,\r\nstraight-forward impulse, and now there was nothing like it. There could\r\nnot be. She grew more and more depressed, and in this gloomy mood she\r\nwent to visit an aunt in Finland. The fresh scenery and surroundings,\r\nthe people strangely different to her own, appealed to her at any rate\r\nas a new experience.\r\n\r\nHow and when it all began she could not clearly remember. Her aunt had\r\nanother guest, a Swede. He talked of his work, his people, the latest\r\nSwedish novel. Somehow, she herself did not know how that terrible\r\nfascination of glances and smiles began, the meaning of which cannot be\r\nput into words.\r\n\r\nThese smiles and glances seemed to reveal to each, not only the soul of\r\nthe other, but some vital and universal mystery. Every word they spoke\r\nwas invested by these smiles with a profound and wonderful significance.\r\nMusic, too, when they were listening together, or when they sang duets,\r\nbecame full of the same deep meaning. So, also, the words in the books\r\nthey read aloud. Sometimes they would argue, but the moment their\r\neyes met, or a smile flashed between them, the discussion remained\r\nfar behind. They soared beyond it to some higher plane consecrated to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nHow it had come about, how and when the devil, who had seized hold of\r\nthem both, first appeared behind these smiles and glances, she could not\r\nsay. But, when terror first seized her, the invisible threads that bound\r\nthem were already so interwoven that she had no power to tear herself\r\nfree. She could only count on him and on his honour. She hoped that he\r\nwould not make use of his power; yet all the while she vaguely desired\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHer weakness was the greater, because she had nothing to support her in\r\nthe struggle. She was weary of society life and she had no affection for\r\nher mother. Her father, so she thought, had cast her away from him, and\r\nshe longed passionately to live and to have done with play. Love, the\r\nperfect love of a woman for a man, held the promise of life for her. Her\r\nstrong, passionate nature, too, was dragging her thither. In the\r\ntall, strong figure of this man, with his fair hair and light upturned\r\nmoustache, under which shone a smile attractive and compelling, she saw\r\nthe promise of that life for which she longed. And then the smiles and\r\nglances, the hope of something so incredibly beautiful, led, as they\r\nwere bound to lead, to that which she feared but unconsciously awaited.\r\n\r\nSuddenly all that was beautiful, joyous, spiritual, and full of promise\r\nfor the future, became animal and sordid, sad and despairing.\r\n\r\nShe looked into his eyes and tried to smile, pretending that she feared\r\nnothing, that everything was as it should be; but deep down in her soul\r\nshe knew it was all over. She understood that she had not found in him\r\nwhat she had sought; that which she had once known in herself and in\r\nKoko. She told him that he must write to her father asking her hand in\r\nmarriage. This he promised to do; but when she met him next he said it\r\nwas impossible for him to write just then. She saw something vague and\r\nfurtive in his eyes, and her distrust of him grew. The following day he\r\nwrote to her, telling her that he was already married, though his wife\r\nhad left him long since; that he knew she would despise him for the\r\nwrong he had done her, and implored her forgiveness. She made him come\r\nto see her. She said she loved him; that she felt herself bound to him\r\nfor ever whether he was married or not, and would never leave him. The\r\nnext time they met he told her that he and his parents were so poor that\r\nhe could only offer her the meanest existence. She answered that she\r\nneeded nothing, and was ready to go with him at once wherever he wished.\r\nHe endeavoured to dissuade her, advising her to wait; and so she waited.\r\nBut to live on with this secret, with occasional meetings, and merely\r\ncorresponding with him, all hidden from her family, was agonising,\r\nand she insisted again that he must take her away. At first, when she\r\nreturned to St. Petersburg, he wrote promising to come, and then letters\r\nceased and she knew no more of him.\r\n\r\nShe tried to lead her old life, but it was impossible. She fell ill,\r\nand the efforts of the doctors were unavailing; in her hopelessness she\r\nresolved to kill herself. But how was she to do this, so that her death\r\nmight seem natural? She really desired to take her life, and imagined\r\nthat she had irrevocably decided on the step. So, obtaining some poison,\r\nshe poured it into a glass, and in another instant would have drunk it,\r\nhad not her sister\xe2\x80\x99s little son of five at that very moment run in to\r\nshow her a toy his grandmother had given him. She caressed the child,\r\nand, suddenly stopping short, burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThe thought overpowered her that she, too, might have been a mother had\r\nhe not been married, and this vision of motherhood made her look into\r\nher own soul for the first time. She began to think not of what others\r\nwould say of her, but of her own life. To kill oneself because of\r\nwhat the world might say was easy; but the moment she saw her own life\r\ndissociated from the world, to take that life was out of the question.\r\nShe threw away the poison, and ceased to think of suicide.\r\n\r\nThen her life within began. It was real life, and despite the torture of\r\nit, had the possibility been given her, she would not have turned back\r\nfrom it. She began to pray, but there was no comfort in prayer; and\r\nher suffering was less for herself than for her father, whose grief she\r\nforesaw and understood.\r\n\r\nThus months dragged along, and then something happened which entirely\r\ntransformed her life. One day, when she was at work upon a quilt, she\r\nsuddenly experienced a strange sensation. No--it seemed impossible.\r\nMotionless she sat with her work in hand. Was it possible that this\r\nwas IT. Forgetting everything, his baseness and deceit, her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquerulousness, and her father\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, she smiled. She shuddered at\r\nthe recollection that she was on the point of killing it, together with\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nShe now directed all her thoughts to getting away--somewhere where she\r\ncould bear her child--and become a miserable, pitiful mother, but a\r\nmother withal. Somehow she planned and arranged it all, leaving her home\r\nand settling in a distant provincial town, where no one could find\r\nher, and where she thought she would be far from her people. But,\r\nunfortunately, her father\xe2\x80\x99s brother received an appointment there,\r\na thing she could not possibly foresee. For four months she had been\r\nliving in the house of a midwife--one Maria Ivanovna; and, on learning\r\nthat her uncle had come to the town, she was preparing to fly to a still\r\nremoter hiding-place.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMICHAEL IVANOVICH awoke early next morning. He entered his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy, and handed him the cheque, filled in for a sum which he asked\r\nhim to pay in monthly instalments to his daughter. He inquired when the\r\nexpress left for St. Petersburg. The train left at seven in the evening,\r\ngiving him time for an early dinner before leaving. He breakfasted with\r\nhis sister-in-law, who refrained from mentioning the subject which was\r\nso painful to him, but only looked at him timidly; and after breakfast\r\nhe went out for his regular morning walk.\r\n\r\nAlexandra Dmitrievna followed him into the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo into the public gardens, Michael--it is very charming there, and\r\nquite near to Everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, meeting his sombre looks with a\r\npathetic glance.\r\n\r\nMichael Ivanovich followed her advice and went to the public gardens,\r\nwhich were so near to Everything, and meditated with annoyance on the\r\nstupidity, the obstinacy, and heartlessness of women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not in the very least sorry for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought of his\r\nsister-in-law. \xe2\x80\x9cShe cannot even understand my sorrow. And what of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He was thinking of his daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cShe knows what all this means to\r\nme--the torture. What a blow in one\xe2\x80\x99s old age! My days will be shortened\r\nby it! But I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have it over than endure this agony. And all\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98pour les beaux yeux d\xe2\x80\x99un chenapan\xe2\x80\x99--oh!\xe2\x80\x9d he moaned; and a wave of\r\nhatred and fury arose in him as he thought of what would be said in the\r\ntown when every one knew. (And no doubt every one knew already.) Such a\r\nfeeling of rage possessed him that he would have liked to beat it into\r\nher head, and make her understand what she had done. These women never\r\nunderstand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite near Everything,\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly came to his mind,\r\nand getting out his notebook, he found her address. Vera Ivanovna\r\nSilvestrova, Kukonskaya Street, Abromov\xe2\x80\x99s house. She was living under\r\nthis name. He left the gardens and called a cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you wish to see, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the midwife, Maria Ivanovna, when\r\nhe stepped on the narrow landing of the steep, stuffy staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Madame Silvestrova live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVera Ivanovna? Yes; please come in. She has gone out; she\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the\r\nshop round the corner. But she\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMichael Ivanovich followed the stout figure of Maria Ivanovna into\r\na tiny parlour, and from the next room came the screams of a baby,\r\nsounding cross and peevish, which filled him with disgust. They cut him\r\nlike a knife.\r\n\r\nMaria Ivanovna apologised, and went into the room, and he could hear her\r\nsoothing the child. The child became quiet, and she returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is her baby; she\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in a minute. You are a friend of hers,\r\nI suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--a friend--but I think I had better come back later on,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMichael Ivanovich, preparing to go. It was too unbearable, this\r\npreparation to meet her, and any explanation seemed impossible.\r\n\r\nHe had just turned to leave, when he heard quick, light steps on the\r\nstairs, and he recognised Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaria Ivanovna--has he been crying while I\xe2\x80\x99ve been gone--I was--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she saw her father. The parcel she was carrying fell from her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and stopped in the doorway, white and trembling.\r\n\r\nHe remained motionless, staring at her. She had grown so thin. Her eyes\r\nwere larger, her nose sharper, her hands worn and bony. He neither\r\nknew what to do, nor what to say. He forgot all his grief about his\r\ndishonour. He only felt sorrow, infinite sorrow for her; sorrow for her\r\nthinness, and for her miserable rough clothing; and most of all, for her\r\npitiful face and imploring eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather--forgive,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, moving towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive--forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured; and he began to sob like a child,\r\nkissing her face and hands, and wetting them with his tears.\r\n\r\nIn his pity for her he understood himself. And when he saw himself as he\r\nwas, he realised how he had wronged her, how guilty he had been in his\r\npride, in his coldness, even in his anger towards her. He was glad that\r\nit was he who was guilty, and that he had nothing to forgive, but that\r\nhe himself needed forgiveness. She took him to her tiny room, and told\r\nhim how she lived; but she did not show him the child, nor did she\r\nmention the past, knowing how painful it would be to him.\r\n\r\nHe told her that she must live differently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; if I could only live in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will talk it over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Suddenly the child began to wail and\r\nto scream. She opened her eyes very wide; and, not taking them from her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s face, remained hesitating and motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--I suppose you must feed him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Ivanovich, and frowned\r\nwith the obvious effort.\r\n\r\nShe got up, and suddenly the wild idea seized her to show him whom she\r\nloved so deeply the thing she now loved best of all in the world. But\r\nfirst she looked at her father\xe2\x80\x99s face. Would he be angry or not? His\r\nface revealed no anger, only suffering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, go, go,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you. Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come again to-morrow,\r\nand we will decide. Good-bye, my darling--good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d Again he found it\r\nhard to swallow the lump in his throat.\r\n\r\nWhen Michael Ivanovich returned to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s house, Alexandra\r\nDmitrievna immediately rushed to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, guessing from his expression that something\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered shortly, and began to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting old and\r\nstupid,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, mastering his emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you are growing wise--very wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE ARE NO GUILTY PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nMINE is a strange and wonderful lot! The chances are that there is not a\r\nsingle wretched beggar suffering under the luxury and oppression of the\r\nrich who feels anything like as keenly as I do either the injustice,\r\nthe cruelty, and the horror of their oppression of and contempt for\r\nthe poor; or the grinding humiliation and misery which befall the great\r\nmajority of the workers, the real producers of all that makes life\r\npossible. I have felt this for a long time, and as the years have\r\npassed by the feeling has grown and grown, until recently it reached its\r\nclimax. Although I feel all this so vividly, I still live on amid the\r\ndepravity and sins of rich society; and I cannot leave it, because I\r\nhave neither the knowledge nor the strength to do so. I cannot. I do\r\nnot know how to change my life so that my physical needs--food, sleep,\r\nclothing, my going to and fro--may be satisfied without a sense of shame\r\nand wrongdoing in the position which I fill.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when I tried to change my position, which was not in\r\nharmony with my conscience; but the conditions created by the past, by\r\nmy family and its claims upon me, were so complicated that they would\r\nnot let me out of their grasp, or rather, I did not know how to free\r\nmyself. I had not the strength. Now that I am over eighty and have\r\nbecome feeble, I have given up trying to free myself; and, strange to\r\nsay, as my feebleness increases I realise more and more strongly the\r\nwrongfulness of my position, and it grows more and more intolerable to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIt has occurred to me that I do not occupy this position for nothing:\r\nthat Providence intended that I should lay bare the truth of my\r\nfeelings, so that I might atone for all that causes my suffering, and\r\nmight perhaps open the eyes of those--or at least of some of those--who\r\nare still blind to what I see so clearly, and thus might lighten\r\nthe burden of that vast majority who, under existing conditions, are\r\nsubjected to bodily and spiritual suffering by those who deceive them\r\nand also deceive themselves. Indeed, it may be that the position which\r\nI occupy gives me special facilities for revealing the artificial and\r\ncriminal relations which exist between men--for telling the whole truth\r\nin regard to that position without confusing the issue by attempting to\r\nvindicate myself, and without rousing the envy of the rich and feelings\r\nof oppression in the hearts of the poor and downtrodden. I am so\r\nplaced that I not only have no desire to vindicate myself; but, on the\r\ncontrary, I find it necessary to make an effort lest I should exaggerate\r\nthe wickedness of the great among whom I live, of whose society I am\r\nashamed, whose attitude towards their fellow-men I detest with my whole\r\nsoul, though I find it impossible to separate my lot from theirs. But\r\nI must also avoid the error of those democrats and others who, in\r\ndefending the oppressed and the enslaved, do not see their failings and\r\nmistakes, and who do not make sufficient allowance for the difficulties\r\ncreated, the mistakes inherited from the past, which in a degree lessens\r\nthe responsibility of the upper classes.\r\n\r\nFree from desire for self-vindication, free from fear of an emancipated\r\npeople, free from that envy and hatred which the oppressed feel for\r\ntheir oppressors, I am in the best possible position to see the truth\r\nand to tell it. Perhaps that is why Providence placed me in such a\r\nposition. I will do my best to turn it to account.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAlexander Ivanovich Volgin, a bachelor and a clerk in a Moscow bank at a\r\nsalary of eight thousand roubles a year, a man much respected in his own\r\nset, was staying in a country-house. His host was a wealthy landowner,\r\nowning some twenty-five hundred acres, and had married his guest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncousin. Volgin, tired after an evening spent in playing vint* for small\r\nstakes with [* A game of cards similar to auction bridge.] members\r\nof the family, went to his room and placed his watch, silver\r\ncigarette-case, pocket-book, big leather purse, and pocket-brush and\r\ncomb on a small table covered with a white cloth, and then, taking off\r\nhis coat, waistcoat, shirt, trousers, and underclothes, his silk socks\r\nand English boots, put on his nightshirt and dressing-gown. His watch\r\npointed to midnight. Volgin smoked a cigarette, lay on his face for\r\nabout five minutes reviewing the day\xe2\x80\x99s impressions; then, blowing\r\nout his candle, he turned over on his side and fell asleep about one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, in spite of a good deal of restlessness. Awaking next morning\r\nat eight he put on his slippers and dressing-gown, and rang the bell.\r\n\r\nThe old butler, Stephen, the father of a family and the grandfather of\r\nsix grandchildren, who had served in that house for thirty years,\r\nentered the room hurriedly, with bent legs, carrying in the newly\r\nblackened boots which Volgin had taken off the night before, a\r\nwell-brushed suit, and a clean shirt. The guest thanked him, and then\r\nasked what the weather was like (the blinds were drawn so that the sun\r\nshould not prevent any one from sleeping till eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock if he were\r\nso inclined), and whether his hosts had slept well. He glanced at his\r\nwatch--it was still early--and began to wash and dress. His water was\r\nready, and everything on the washing-stand and dressing-table was ready\r\nfor use and properly laid out--his soap, his tooth and hair brushes, his\r\nnail scissors and files. He washed his hands and face in a leisurely\r\nfashion, cleaned and manicured his nails, pushed back the skin with the\r\ntowel, and sponged his stout white body from head to foot. Then he began\r\nto brush his hair. Standing in front of the mirror, he first brushed his\r\ncurly beard, which was beginning to turn grey, with two English brushes,\r\nparting it down the middle. Then he combed his hair, which was already\r\nshowing signs of getting thin, with a large tortoise-shell comb. Putting\r\non his underlinen, his socks, his boots, his trousers--which were held\r\nup by elegant braces--and his waistcoat, he sat down coatless in an easy\r\nchair to rest after dressing, lit a cigarette, and began to think where\r\nhe should go for a walk that morning--to the park or to Littleports\r\n(what a funny name for a wood!). He thought he would go to Littleports.\r\nThen he must answer Simon Nicholaevich\xe2\x80\x99s letter; but there was time\r\nenough for that. Getting up with an air of resolution, he took out his\r\nwatch. It was already five minutes to nine. He put his watch into his\r\nwaistcoat pocket, and his purse--with all that was left of the hundred\r\nand eighty roubles he had taken for his journey, and for the incidental\r\nexpenses of his fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s stay with his cousin--and then he\r\nplaced into his trouser pocket his cigarette-case and electric\r\ncigarette-lighter, and two clean handkerchiefs into his coat pockets,\r\nand went out of the room, leaving as usual the mess and confusion which\r\nhe had made to be cleared up by Stephen, an old man of over fifty.\r\nStephen expected Volgin to \xe2\x80\x9cremunerate\xe2\x80\x9d him, as he said, being so\r\naccustomed to the work that he did not feel the slightest repugnance for\r\nit. Glancing at a mirror, and feeling satisfied with his appearance,\r\nVolgin went into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThere, thanks to the efforts of the housekeeper, the footman, and\r\nunder-butler--the latter had risen at dawn in order to run home to\r\nsharpen his son\xe2\x80\x99s scythe--breakfast was ready. On a spotless white cloth\r\nstood a boiling, shiny, silver samovar (at least it looked like silver),\r\na coffee-pot, hot milk, cream, butter, and all sorts of fancy white\r\nbread and biscuits. The only persons at table were the second son of the\r\nhouse, his tutor (a student), and the secretary. The host, who was an\r\nactive member of the Zemstvo and a great farmer, had already left the\r\nhouse, having gone at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock to attend to his work. Volgin, while\r\ndrinking his coffee, talked to the student and the secretary about\r\nthe weather, and yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s vint, and discussed Theodorite\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar\r\nbehaviour the night before, as he had been very rude to his father\r\nwithout the slightest cause. Theodorite was the grown-up son of the\r\nhouse, and a ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-well. His name was Theodore, but some one had\r\nonce called him Theodorite either as a joke or to tease him; and, as it\r\nseemed funny, the name stuck to him, although his doings were no longer\r\nin the least amusing. So it was now. He had been to the university, but\r\nleft it in his second year, and joined a regiment of horse guards; but\r\nhe gave that up also, and was now living in the country, doing nothing,\r\nfinding fault, and feeling discontented with everything. Theodorite\r\nwas still in bed: so were the other members of the household--Anna\r\nMikhailovna, its mistress; her sister, the widow of a general; and a\r\nlandscape painter who lived with the family.\r\n\r\nVolgin took his panama hat from the hall table (it had cost twenty\r\nroubles) and his cane with its carved ivory handle, and went out.\r\nCrossing the veranda, gay with flowers, he walked through the flower\r\ngarden, in the centre of which was a raised round bed, with rings of\r\nred, white, and blue flowers, and the initials of the mistress of the\r\nhouse done in carpet bedding in the centre. Leaving the flower garden\r\nVolgin entered the avenue of lime trees, hundreds of years old, which\r\npeasant girls were tidying and sweeping with spades and brooms. The\r\ngardener was busy measuring, and a boy was bringing something in a\r\ncart. Passing these Volgin went into the park of at least a hundred\r\nand twenty-five acres, filled with fine old trees, and intersected by\r\na network of well-kept walks. Smoking as he strolled Volgin took his\r\nfavourite path past the summer-house into the fields beyond. It was\r\npleasant in the park, but it was still nicer in the fields. On the right\r\nsome women who were digging potatoes formed a mass of bright red and\r\nwhite colour; on the left were wheat fields, meadows, and grazing\r\ncattle; and in the foreground, slightly to the right, were the dark,\r\ndark oaks of Littleports. Volgin took a deep breath, and felt glad that\r\nhe was alive, especially here in his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s home, where he was so\r\nthoroughly enjoying the rest from his work at the bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucky people to live in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue, what with his\r\nfarming and his Zemstvo, the owner of the estate has very little peace\r\neven in the country, but that is his own lookout.\xe2\x80\x9d Volgin shook his\r\nhead, lit another cigarette, and, stepping out firmly with his powerful\r\nfeet clad in his thick English boots, began to think of the heavy\r\nwinter\xe2\x80\x99s work in the bank that was in front of him. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be there\r\nevery day from ten to two, sometimes even till five. And the board\r\nmeetings . . . And private interviews with clients. . . . Then the Duma.\r\nWhereas here. . . . It is delightful. It may be a little dull, but it is\r\nnot for long.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled. After a stroll in Littleports he turned back,\r\ngoing straight across a fallow field which was being ploughed. A herd of\r\ncows, calves, sheep, and pigs, which belonged to the village community,\r\nwas grazing there. The shortest way to the park was to pass through the\r\nherd. He frightened the sheep, which ran away one after another, and\r\nwere followed by the pigs, of which two little ones stared solemnly at\r\nhim. The shepherd boy called to the sheep and cracked his whip. \xe2\x80\x9cHow far\r\nbehind Europe we are,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Volgin, recalling his frequent holidays\r\nabroad. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would not find a single cow like that anywhere in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then, wanting to find out where the path which branched off from the\r\none he was on led to and who was the owner of the herd, he called to the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose herd is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy was so filled with wonder, verging on terror, when he gazed\r\nat the hat, the well-brushed beard, and above all the gold-rimmed\r\neyeglasses, that he could not reply at once. When Volgin repeated his\r\nquestion the boy pulled himself together, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOurs.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut whose\r\nis \xe2\x80\x98ours\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d said Volgin, shaking his head and smiling. The boy was\r\nwearing shoes of plaited birch bark, bands of linen round his legs, a\r\ndirty, unbleached shirt ragged at the shoulder, and a cap the peak of\r\nwhich had been torn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose is \xe2\x80\x98ours\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pirogov village herd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you go to school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you learn to read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere does that path lead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy told him, and Volgin went on towards the house, thinking how\r\nhe would chaff Nicholas Petrovich about the deplorable condition of the\r\nvillage schools in spite of all his efforts.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the house Volgin looked at his watch, and saw that it was\r\nalready past eleven. He remembered that Nicholas Petrovich was going to\r\ndrive to the nearest town, and that he had meant to give him a letter\r\nto post to Moscow; but the letter was not written. The letter was a very\r\nimportant one to a friend, asking him to bid for him for a picture\r\nof the Madonna which was to be offered for sale at an auction. As he\r\nreached the house he saw at the door four big, well-fed, well-groomed,\r\nthoroughbred horses harnessed to a carriage, the black lacquer of which\r\nglistened in the sun. The coachman was seated on the box in a kaftan,\r\nwith a silver belt, and the horses were jingling their silver bells from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\nA bare-headed, barefooted peasant in a ragged kaftan stood at the front\r\ndoor. He bowed. Volgin asked what he wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to see Nicholas Petrovich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am in distress--my horse has died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVolgin began to question him. The peasant told him how he was situated.\r\nHe had five children, and this had been his only horse. Now it was gone.\r\nHe wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo beg.\xe2\x80\x9d And he knelt down, and remained kneeling in spite of Volgin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpostulations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMitri Sudarikov,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the peasant, still kneeling.\r\n\r\nVolgin took three roubles from his purse and gave them to the peasant,\r\nwho showed his gratitude by touching the ground with his forehead, and\r\nthen went into the house. His host was standing in the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your letter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, approaching Volgin; \xe2\x80\x9cI am just off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll write it this minute, if you will let me.\r\nI forgot all about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s so pleasant here that one can forget\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, but do be quick. The horses have already been standing a\r\nquarter of an hour, and the flies are biting viciously. Can you wait,\r\nArsenty?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said the coachman, thinking to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do they order\r\nthe horses when they aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready? The rush the grooms and I had--just\r\nto stand here and feed the flies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirectly, directly,\xe2\x80\x9d Volgin went towards his room, but turned back to\r\nask Nicholas Petrovich about the begging peasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see him?--He\xe2\x80\x99s a drunkard, but still he is to be pitied. Do be\r\nquick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVolgin got out his case, with all the requisites for writing, wrote the\r\nletter, made out a cheque for a hundred and eighty roubles, and, sealing\r\ndown the envelope, took it to Nicholas Petrovich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVolgin read the newspapers till luncheon. He only read the Liberal\r\npapers: The Russian Gazette, Speech, sometimes The Russian Word--but he\r\nwould not touch The New Times, to which his host subscribed.\r\n\r\nWhile he was scanning at his ease the political news, the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s doings,\r\nthe doings of President, and ministers and decisions in the Duma,\r\nand was just about to pass on to the general news, theatres, science,\r\nmurders and cholera, he heard the luncheon bell ring.\r\n\r\nThanks to the efforts of upwards of ten human beings--counting\r\nlaundresses, gardeners, cooks, kitchen-maids, butlers and footmen--the\r\ntable was sumptuously laid for eight, with silver waterjugs, decanters,\r\nkvass, wine, mineral waters, cut glass, and fine table linen, while\r\ntwo men-servants were continually hurrying to and fro, bringing in and\r\nserving, and then clearing away the hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvre and the various hot\r\nand cold courses.\r\n\r\nThe hostess talked incessantly about everything that she had been doing,\r\nthinking, and saying; and she evidently considered that everything that\r\nshe thought, said, or did was perfect, and that it would please every\r\none except those who were fools. Volgin felt and knew that everything\r\nshe said was stupid, but it would never do to let it be seen, and so he\r\nkept up the conversation. Theodorite was glum and silent; the student\r\noccasionally exchanged a few words with the widow. Now and again there\r\nwas a pause in the conversation, and then Theodorite interposed, and\r\nevery one became miserably depressed. At such moments the hostess\r\nordered some dish that had not been served, and the footman hurried off\r\nto the kitchen, or to the housekeeper, and hurried back again. Nobody\r\nfelt inclined either to talk or to eat. But they all forced themselves\r\nto eat and to talk, and so luncheon went on.\r\n\r\nThe peasant who had been begging because his horse had died was named\r\nMitri Sudarikov. He had spent the whole day before he went to the squire\r\nover his dead horse. First of all he went to the knacker, Sanin, who\r\nlived in a village near. The knacker was out, but he waited for him, and\r\nit was dinner-time when he had finished bargaining over the price of the\r\nskin. Then he borrowed a neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s horse to take his own to a field\r\nto be buried, as it is forbidden to bury dead animals near a village.\r\nAdrian would not lend his horse because he was getting in his potatoes,\r\nbut Stephen took pity on Mitri and gave way to his persuasion. He even\r\nlent a hand in lifting the dead horse into the cart. Mitri tore off the\r\nshoes from the forelegs and gave them to his wife. One was broken, but\r\nthe other one was whole. While he was digging the grave with a spade\r\nwhich was very blunt, the knacker appeared and took off the skin; and\r\nthe carcass was then thrown into the hole and covered up. Mitri felt\r\ntired, and went into Matrena\xe2\x80\x99s hut, where he drank half a bottle of\r\nvodka with Sanin to console himself. Then he went home, quarrelled with\r\nhis wife, and lay down to sleep on the hay. He did not undress, but\r\nslept just as he was, with a ragged coat for a coverlet. His wife was\r\nin the hut with the girls--there were four of them, and the youngest was\r\nonly five weeks old. Mitri woke up before dawn as usual. He groaned\r\nas the memory of the day before broke in upon him--how the horse had\r\nstruggled and struggled, and then fallen down. Now there was no horse,\r\nand all he had was the price of the skin, four roubles and eighty\r\nkopeks. Getting up he arranged the linen bands on his legs, and went\r\nthrough the yard into the hut. His wife was putting straw into the stove\r\nwith one hand, with the other she was holding a baby girl to her breast,\r\nwhich was hanging out of her dirty chemise.\r\n\r\nMitri crossed himself three times, turning towards the corner in which\r\nthe ikons hung, and repeated some utterly meaningless words, which he\r\ncalled prayers, to the Trinity and the Virgin, the Creed and our Father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there any water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s gone for it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some tea. Will you go up to the\r\nsquire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99d better.\xe2\x80\x9d The smoke from the stove made him cough. He took a\r\nrag off the wooden bench and went into the porch. The girl had just come\r\nback with the water. Mitri filled his mouth with water from the pail and\r\nsquirted it out on his hands, took some more in his mouth to wash his\r\nface, dried himself with the rag, then parted and smoothed his curly\r\nhair with his fingers and went out. A little girl of about ten, with\r\nnothing on but a dirty shirt, came towards him. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Uncle\r\nMitri,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are to come and thrash.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied Mitri. He understood that he was expected to return the help\r\ngiven the week before by Kumushkir, a man as poor as he was himself,\r\nwhen he was thrashing his own corn with a horse-driven machine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell them I\xe2\x80\x99ll come--I\xe2\x80\x99ll come at lunch time. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go to\r\nUgrumi.\xe2\x80\x9d Mitri went back to the hut, and changing his birch-bark shoes\r\nand the linen bands on his legs, started off to see the squire. After\r\nhe had got three roubles from Volgin, and the same sum from Nicholas\r\nPetrovich, he returned to his house, gave the money to his wife, and\r\nwent to his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s. The thrashing machine was humming, and the\r\ndriver was shouting. The lean horses were going slowly round him,\r\nstraining at their traces. The driver was shouting to them in a\r\nmonotone, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, there, my dears.\xe2\x80\x9d Some women were unbinding sheaves,\r\nothers were raking up the scattered straw and ears, and others again\r\nwere gathering great armfuls of corn and handing them to the men to feed\r\nthe machine. The work was in full swing. In the kitchen garden, which\r\nMitri had to pass, a girl, clad only in a long shirt, was digging\r\npotatoes which she put into a basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your grandfather?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mitri. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in the barn.\xe2\x80\x9d Mitri went\r\nto the barn and set to work at once. The old man of eighty knew of\r\nMitri\xe2\x80\x99s trouble. After greeting him, he gave him his place to feed the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nMitri took off his ragged coat, laid it out of the way near the fence,\r\nand then began to work vigorously, raking the corn together and throwing\r\nit into the machine. The work went on without interruption until the\r\ndinner-hour. The cocks had crowed two or three times, but no one paid\r\nany attention to them; not because the workers did not believe them, but\r\nbecause they were scarcely heard for the noise of the work and the talk\r\nabout it. At last the whistle of the squire\xe2\x80\x99s steam thrasher sounded\r\nthree miles away, and then the owner came into the barn. He was\r\na straight old man of eighty. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time to stop,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndinner-time.\xe2\x80\x9d Those at work seemed to redouble their efforts. In a\r\nmoment the straw was cleared away; the grain that had been thrashed was\r\nseparated from the chaff and brought in, and then the workers went into\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\nThe hut was smoke-begrimed, as its stove had no chimney, but it had been\r\ntidied up, and benches stood round the table, making room for all those\r\nwho had been working, of whom there were nine, not counting the owners.\r\nBread, soup, boiled potatoes, and kvass were placed on the table.\r\n\r\nAn old one-armed beggar, with a bag slung over his shoulder, came in\r\nwith a crutch during the meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace be to this house. A good appetite to you. For Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake give\r\nme something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod will give it to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mistress, already an old woman, and\r\nthe daughter-in-law of the master. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with us.\xe2\x80\x9d An old\r\nman, who was still standing near the door, said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive him some bread,\r\nMartha. How can you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only wondering whether we shall have enough.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is wrong,\r\nMartha. God tells us to help the poor. Cut him a slice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha obeyed. The beggar went away. The man in charge of the\r\nthrashing-machine got up, said grace, thanked his hosts, and went away\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\nMitri did not lie down, but ran to the shop to buy some tobacco. He was\r\nlonging for a smoke. While he smoked he chatted to a man from Demensk,\r\nasking the price of cattle, as he saw that he would not be able to\r\nmanage without selling a cow. When he returned to the others, they were\r\nalready back at work again; and so it went on till the evening.\r\n\r\nAmong these downtrodden, duped, and defrauded men, who are becoming\r\ndemoralised by overwork, and being gradually done to death by\r\nunderfeeding, there are men living who consider themselves Christians;\r\nand others so enlightened that they feel no further need for\r\nChristianity or for any religion, so superior do they appear in their\r\nown esteem. And yet their hideous, lazy lives are supported by the\r\ndegrading, excessive labour of these slaves, not to mention the labour\r\nof millions of other slaves, toiling in factories to produce samovars,\r\nsilver, carriages, machines, and the like for their use. They live among\r\nthese horrors, seeing them and yet not seeing them, although often\r\nkind at heart--old men and women, young men and maidens, mothers and\r\nchildren--poor children who are being vitiated and trained into moral\r\nblindness.\r\n\r\nHere is a bachelor grown old, the owner of thousands of acres, who has\r\nlived a life of idleness, greed, and over-indulgence, who reads The\r\nNew Times, and is astonished that the government can be so unwise as to\r\npermit Jews to enter the university. There is his guest, formerly the\r\ngovernor of a province, now a senator with a big salary, who reads with\r\nsatisfaction that a congress of lawyers has passed a resolution in favor\r\nof capital punishment. Their political enemy, N. P., reads a liberal\r\npaper, and cannot understand the blindness of the government in allowing\r\nthe union of Russian men to exist.\r\n\r\nHere is a kind, gentle mother of a little girl reading a story to her\r\nabout Fox, a dog that lamed some rabbits. And here is this little girl.\r\nDuring her walks she sees other children, barefooted, hungry, hunting\r\nfor green apples that have fallen from the trees; and, so accustomed is\r\nshe to the sight, that these children do not seem to her to be children\r\nsuch as she is, but only part of the usual surroundings--the familiar\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nWhy is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG TSAR\r\n\r\nTHE young Tsar had just ascended the throne. For five weeks he had\r\nworked without ceasing, in the way that Tsars are accustomed to work. He\r\nhad been attending to reports, signing papers, receiving ambassadors and\r\nhigh officials who came to be presented to him, and reviewing troops. He\r\nwas tired, and as a traveller exhausted by heat and thirst longs for a\r\ndraught of water and for rest, so he longed for a respite of just one\r\nday at least from receptions, from speeches, from parades--a few free\r\nhours to spend like an ordinary human being with his young, clever, and\r\nbeautiful wife, to whom he had been married only a month before.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas Eve. The young Tsar had arranged to have a complete\r\nrest that evening. The night before he had worked till very late at\r\ndocuments which his ministers of state had left for him to examine.\r\nIn the morning he was present at the Te Deum, and then at a military\r\nservice. In the afternoon he received official visitors; and later he\r\nhad been obliged to listen to the reports of three ministers of state,\r\nand had given his assent to many important matters. In his conference\r\nwith the Minister of Finance he had agreed to an increase of duties\r\non imported goods, which should in the future add many millions to the\r\nState revenues. Then he sanctioned the sale of brandy by the Crown in\r\nvarious parts of the country, and signed a decree permitting the sale of\r\nalcohol in villages having markets. This was also calculated to increase\r\nthe principal revenue to the State, which was derived from the sale of\r\nspirits. He had also approved of the issuing of a new gold loan required\r\nfor a financial negotiation. The Minister of justice having reported on\r\nthe complicated case of the succession of the Baron Snyders, the young\r\nTsar confirmed the decision by his signature; and also approved the new\r\nrules relating to the application of Article 1830 of the penal code,\r\nproviding for the punishment of tramps. In his conference with the\r\nMinister of the Interior he ratified the order concerning the collection\r\nof taxes in arrears, signed the order settling what measures should be\r\ntaken in regard to the persecution of religious dissenters, and also one\r\nproviding for the continuance of martial law in those provinces where it\r\nhad already been established. With the Minister of War he arranged for\r\nthe nomination of a new Corps Commander for the raising of recruits, and\r\nfor punishment of breach of discipline. These things kept him occupied\r\ntill dinner-time, and even then his freedom was not complete. A number\r\nof high officials had been invited to dinner, and he was obliged to talk\r\nto them: not in the way he felt disposed to do, but according to what\r\nhe was expected to say. At last the tiresome dinner was over, and the\r\nguests departed.\r\n\r\nThe young Tsar heaved a sigh of relief, stretched himself and retired to\r\nhis apartments to take off his uniform with the decorations on it, and\r\nto don the jacket he used to wear before his accession to the throne.\r\nHis young wife had also retired to take off her dinner-dress, remarking\r\nthat she would join him presently.\r\n\r\nWhen he had passed the row of footmen who were standing erect before\r\nhim, and reached his room; when he had thrown off his heavy uniform and\r\nput on his jacket, the young Tsar felt glad to be free from work;\r\nand his heart was filled with a tender emotion which sprang from the\r\nconsciousness of his freedom, of his joyous, robust young life, and of\r\nhis love. He threw himself on the sofa, stretched out his legs upon it,\r\nleaned his head on his hand, fixed his gaze on the dull glass shade of\r\nthe lamp, and then a sensation which he had not experienced since his\r\nchildhood,--the pleasure of going to sleep, and a drowsiness that was\r\nirresistible--suddenly came over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife will be here presently and will find me asleep. No, I must not\r\ngo to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He let his elbow drop down, laid his cheek in\r\nthe palm of his hand, made himself comfortable, and was so utterly happy\r\nthat he only felt a desire not to be aroused from this delightful state.\r\n\r\nAnd then what happens to all of us every day happened to him--he fell\r\nasleep without knowing himself when or how. He passed from one state\r\ninto another without his will having any share in it, without even\r\ndesiring it, and without regretting the state out of which he had\r\npassed. He fell into a heavy sleep which was like death. How long he had\r\nslept he did not know, but he was suddenly aroused by the soft touch of\r\na hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my darling, it is she,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shame to have dozed\r\noff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was not she. Before his eyes, which were wide open and blinking\r\nat the light, she, that charming and beautiful creature whom he was\r\nexpecting, did not stand, but HE stood. Who HE was the young Tsar did\r\nnot know, but somehow it did not strike him that he was a stranger whom\r\nhe had never seen before. It seemed as if he had known him for a long\r\ntime and was fond of him, and as if he trusted him as he would trust\r\nhimself. He had expected his beloved wife, but in her stead that man\r\nwhom he had never seen before had come. Yet to the young Tsar, who\r\nwas far from feeling regret or astonishment, it seemed not only a most\r\nnatural, but also a necessary thing to happen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, let us go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Tsar, not knowing where he was to go,\r\nbut quite aware that he could not help submitting to the command of the\r\nstranger. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how shall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger laid his hand on the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s head, and the Tsar for a moment\r\nlost consciousness. He could not tell whether he had been unconscious a\r\nlong or a short time, but when he recovered his senses he found himself\r\nin a strange place. The first thing he was aware of was a strong and\r\nstifling smell of sewage. The place in which he stood was a broad\r\npassage lit by the red glow of two dim lamps. Running along one side of\r\nthe passage was a thick wall with windows protected by iron gratings.\r\nOn the other side were doors secured with locks. In the passage stood\r\na soldier, leaning up against the wall, asleep. Through the doors the\r\nyoung Tsar heard the muffled sound of living human beings: not of one\r\nalone, but of many. HE was standing at the side of the young Tsar, and\r\npressing his shoulder slightly with his soft hand, pushed him to the\r\nfirst door, unmindful of the sentry. The young Tsar felt he could not\r\ndo otherwise than yield, and approached the door. To his amazement\r\nthe sentry looked straight at him, evidently without seeing him, as\r\nhe neither straightened himself up nor saluted, but yawned loudly and,\r\nlifting his hand, scratched the back of his neck. The door had a small\r\nhole, and in obedience to the pressure of the hand that pushed him,\r\nthe young Tsar approached a step nearer and put his eye to the small\r\nopening. Close to the door, the foul smell that stifled him was\r\nstronger, and the young Tsar hesitated to go nearer, but the hand\r\npushed him on. He leaned forward, put his eye close to the opening, and\r\nsuddenly ceased to perceive the odour. The sight he saw deadened his\r\nsense of smell. In a large room, about ten yards long and six yards\r\nwide, there walked unceasingly from one end to the other, six men in\r\nlong grey coats, some in felt boots, some barefoot. There were over\r\ntwenty men in all in the room, but in that first moment the young Tsar\r\nonly saw those who were walking with quick, even, silent steps. It was a\r\nhorrid sight to watch the continual, quick, aimless movements of the men\r\nwho passed and overtook each other, turning sharply when they reached\r\nthe wall, never looking at one another, and evidently concentrated each\r\non his own thoughts. The young Tsar had observed a similar sight one\r\nday when he was watching a tiger in a menagerie pacing rapidly with\r\nnoiseless tread from one end of his cage to the other, waving its tail,\r\nsilently turning when it reached the bars, and looking at nobody. Of\r\nthese men one, apparently a young peasant, with curly hair, would have\r\nbeen handsome were it not for the unnatural pallor of his face, and the\r\nconcentrated, wicked, scarcely human, look in his eyes. Another was a\r\nJew, hairy and gloomy. The third was a lean old man, bald, with a beard\r\nthat had been shaven and had since grown like bristles. The fourth\r\nwas extraordinarily heavily built, with well-developed muscles, a low\r\nreceding forehead and a flat nose. The fifth was hardly more than a boy,\r\nlong, thin, obviously consumptive. The sixth was small and dark, with\r\nnervous, convulsive movements. He walked as if he were skipping,\r\nand muttered continuously to himself. They were all walking rapidly\r\nbackwards and forwards past the hole through which the young Tsar was\r\nlooking. He watched their faces and their gait with keen interest.\r\nHaving examined them closely, he presently became aware of a number of\r\nother men at the back of the room, standing round, or lying on the shelf\r\nthat served as a bed. Standing close to the door he also saw the pail\r\nwhich caused such an unbearable stench. On the shelf about ten men,\r\nentirely covered with their cloaks, were sleeping. A red-haired man with\r\na huge beard was sitting sideways on the shelf, with his shirt off. He\r\nwas examining it, lifting it up to the light, and evidently catching\r\nthe vermin on it. Another man, aged and white as snow, stood with his\r\nprofile turned towards the door. He was praying, crossing himself, and\r\nbowing low, apparently so absorbed in his devotions as to be oblivious\r\nof all around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see--this is a prison,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the young Tsar. \xe2\x80\x9cThey certainly\r\ndeserve pity. It is a dreadful life. But it cannot be helped. It is\r\ntheir own fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this thought had hardly come into his head before HE, who was his\r\nguide, replied to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all here under lock and key by your order. They have all been\r\nsentenced in your name. But far from meriting their present condition\r\nwhich is due to your human judgment, the greater part of them are far\r\nbetter than you or those who were their judges and who keep them here.\r\nThis one\xe2\x80\x9d--he pointed to the handsome, curly-headed fellow--\xe2\x80\x9cis a\r\nmurderer. I do not consider him more guilty than those who kill in\r\nwar or in duelling, and are rewarded for their deeds. He had neither\r\neducation nor moral guidance, and his life had been cast among\r\nthieves and drunkards. This lessens his guilt, but he has done wrong,\r\nnevertheless, in being a murderer. He killed a merchant, to rob him.\r\nThe other man, the Jew, is a thief, one of a gang of thieves. That\r\nuncommonly strong fellow is a horse-stealer, and guilty also, but\r\ncompared with others not as culpable. Look!\xe2\x80\x9d--and suddenly the young\r\nTsar found himself in an open field on a vast frontier. On the right\r\nwere potato fields; the plants had been rooted out, and were lying in\r\nheaps, blackened by the frost; in alternate streaks were rows of winter\r\ncorn. In the distance a little village with its tiled roofs was visible;\r\non the left were fields of winter corn, and fields of stubble. No one\r\nwas to be seen on any side, save a black human figure in front at the\r\nborder-line, a gun slung on his back, and at his feet a dog. On the spot\r\nwhere the young Tsar stood, sitting beside him, almost at his feet, was\r\na young Russian soldier with a green band on his cap, and with his\r\nrifle slung over his shoulders, who was rolling up a paper to make a\r\ncigarette. The soldier was obviously unaware of the presence of the\r\nyoung Tsar and his companion, and had not heard them. He did now turn\r\nround when the Tsar, who was standing directly over the soldier,\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Prussian frontier,\xe2\x80\x9d his guide answered.\r\nSuddenly, far away in front of them, a shot was fired. The soldier\r\njumped to his feet, and seeing two men running, bent low to the ground,\r\nhastily put his tobacco into his pocket, and ran after one of them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the soldier. The fugitive, without\r\nstopping, turned his head and called out something evidently abusive or\r\nblasphemous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn you!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the soldier, who put one foot a little forward and\r\nstopped, after which, bending his head over his rifle, and raising his\r\nright hand, he rapidly adjusted something, took aim, and, pointing the\r\ngun in the direction of the fugitive, probably fired, although no sound\r\nwas heard. \xe2\x80\x9cSmokeless powder, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the young Tsar, and\r\nlooking after the fleeing man saw him take a few hurried steps, and\r\nbending lower and lower, fall to the ground and crawl on his hands and\r\nknees. At last he remained lying and did not move. The other fugitive,\r\nwho was ahead of him, turned round and ran back to the man who was lying\r\non the ground. He did something for him and then resumed his flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does all this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Tsar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are the guards on the frontier, enforcing the revenue laws. That\r\nman was killed to protect the revenues of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he actually been killed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guide again laid his hand upon the head of the young Tsar, and again\r\nthe Tsar lost consciousness. When he had recovered his senses he found\r\nhimself in a small room--the customs office. The dead body of a man,\r\nwith a thin grizzled beard, an aquiline nose, and big eyes with the\r\neyelids closed, was lying on the floor. His arms were thrown asunder,\r\nhis feet bare, and his thick, dirty toes were turned up at right angles\r\nand stuck out straight. He had a wound in his side, and on his ragged\r\ncloth jacket, as well as on his blue shirt, were stains of clotted\r\nblood, which had turned black save for a few red spots here and there.\r\nA woman stood close to the wall, so wrapped up in shawls that her face\r\ncould scarcely be seen. Motionless she gazed at the aquiline nose, the\r\nupturned feet, and the protruding eyeballs; sobbing and sighing, and\r\ndrying her tears at long, regular intervals. A pretty girl of thirteen\r\nwas standing at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side, with her eyes and mouth wide open.\r\nA boy of eight clung to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s skirt, and looked intensely at his\r\ndead father without blinking.\r\n\r\nFrom a door near them an official, an officer, a doctor, and a clerk\r\nwith documents, entered. After them came a soldier, the one who had shot\r\nthe man. He stepped briskly along behind his superiors, but the instant\r\nhe saw the corpse he went suddenly pale, and quivered; and dropping his\r\nhead stood still. When the official asked him whether that was the man\r\nwho was escaping across the frontier, and at whom he had fired, he\r\nwas unable to answer. His lips trembled, and his face twitched. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ns--s--s--\xe2\x80\x9d he began, but could not get out the words which he wanted to\r\nsay. \xe2\x80\x9cThe same, your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d The officials looked at each other and\r\nwrote something down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see the beneficial results of that same system!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a room of sumptuous vulgarity two men sat drinking wine. One of them\r\nwas old and grey, the other a young Jew. The young Jew was holding a\r\nroll of bank-notes in his hand, and was bargaining with the old man. He\r\nwas buying smuggled goods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x98em cheap,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--but the risk--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is indeed terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Tsar; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it cannot be\r\navoided. Such proceedings are necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion made no response, saying merely, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us move on,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nlaid his hand again on the head of the Tsar. When the Tsar recovered\r\nconsciousness, he was standing in a small room lit by a shaded lamp. A\r\nwoman was sitting at the table sewing. A boy of eight was bending over\r\nthe table, drawing, with his feet doubled up under him in the armchair.\r\nA student was reading aloud. The father and daughter of the family\r\nentered the room noisily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou signed the order concerning the sale of spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guide to\r\nthe Tsar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve kept him drunk all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not possible!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true. And the boy\xe2\x80\x99s only nine years old, that Vania Moroshkine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do to try to save him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried everything that could be done. I gave him an emetic and put a\r\nmustard-plaster on him. He has every symptom of delirium tremens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder--the whole family are drunkards. Annisia is only a\r\nlittle better than the rest, and even she is generally more or less\r\ndrunk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about your temperance society?\xe2\x80\x9d the student asked his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we do when they are given every opportunity of drinking?\r\nFather tried to have the public-house shut up, but the law is against\r\nhim. And, besides, when I was trying to convince Vasily Ermiline that it\r\nwas disgraceful to keep a public-house and ruin the people with drink,\r\nhe answered very haughtily, and indeed got the better of me before the\r\ncrowd: \xe2\x80\x98But I have a license with the Imperial eagle on it. If there was\r\nanything wrong in my business, the Tsar wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have issued a decree\r\nauthorising it.\xe2\x80\x99 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it terrible? The whole village has been drunk\r\nfor the last three days. And as for feast-days, it is simply horrible to\r\nthink of! It has been proved conclusively that alcohol does no good in\r\nany case, but invariably does harm, and it has been demonstrated to be\r\nan absolute poison. Then, ninety-nine per cent. of the crimes in the\r\nworld are committed through its influence. We all know how the standard\r\nof morality and the general welfare improved at once in all the\r\ncountries where drinking has been suppressed--like Sweden and Finland,\r\nand we know that it can be suppressed by exercising a moral influence\r\nover the masses. But in our country the class which could exert that\r\ninfluence--the Government, the Tsar and his officials--simply encourage\r\ndrink. Their main revenues are drawn from the continual drunkenness of\r\nthe people. They drink themselves--they are always drinking the health\r\nof somebody: \xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, the Regiment!\xe2\x80\x99 The preachers drink, the bishops\r\ndrink--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the guide touched the head of the young Tsar, who again lost\r\nconsciousness. This time he found himself in a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\r\nThe peasant--a man of forty, with red face and blood-shot eyes--was\r\nfuriously striking the face of an old man, who tried in vain to protect\r\nhimself from the blows. The younger peasant seized the beard of the old\r\nman and held it fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame! To strike your father--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill him! Let them send me to Siberia, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe women were screaming. Drunken officials rushed into the cottage and\r\nseparated father and son. The father had an arm broken and the son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeard was torn out. In the doorway a drunken girl was making violent\r\nlove to an old besotted peasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are beasts!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Tsar.\r\n\r\nAnother touch of his guide\xe2\x80\x99s hand and the young Tsar awoke in a new\r\nplace. It was the office of the justice of the peace. A fat, bald-headed\r\nman, with a double chin and a chain round his neck, had just risen from\r\nhis seat, and was reading the sentence in a loud voice, while a crowd\r\nof peasants stood behind the grating. There was a woman in rags in the\r\ncrowd who did not rise. The guard gave her a push.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsleep! I tell you to stand up!\xe2\x80\x9d The woman rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the decree of his Imperial Majesty--\xe2\x80\x9d the judge began\r\nreading the sentence. The case concerned that very woman. She had taken\r\naway half a bundle of oats as she was passing the thrashing-floor of\r\na landowner. The justice of the peace sentenced her to two months\xe2\x80\x99\r\nimprisonment. The landowner whose oats had been stolen was among the\r\naudience. When the judge adjourned the court the landowner approached,\r\nand shook hands, and the judge entered into conversation with him. The\r\nnext case was about a stolen samovar. Then there was a trial about\r\nsome timber which had been cut, to the detriment of the landowner. Some\r\npeasants were being tried for having assaulted the constable of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nWhen the young Tsar again lost consciousness, he awoke to find himself\r\nin the middle of a village, where he saw hungry, half-frozen children\r\nand the wife of the man who had assaulted the constable broken down from\r\noverwork.\r\n\r\nThen came a new scene. In Siberia, a tramp is being flogged with the\r\nlash, the direct result of an order issued by the Minister of justice.\r\nAgain oblivion, and another scene. The family of a Jewish watchmaker\r\nis evicted for being too poor. The children are crying, and the Jew,\r\nIsaaks, is greatly distressed. At last they come to an arrangement, and\r\nhe is allowed to stay on in the lodgings.\r\n\r\nThe chief of police takes a bribe. The governor of the province also\r\nsecretly accepts a bribe. Taxes are being collected. In the village,\r\nwhile a cow is sold for payment, the police inspector is bribed by a\r\nfactory owner, who thus escapes taxes altogether. And again a village\r\ncourt scene, and a sentence carried into execution--the lash!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIlia Vasilievich, could you not spare me that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant burst into tears. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, Christ suffered, and He\r\nbids us suffer too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen other scenes. The Stundists--a sect--being broken up and dispersed;\r\nthe clergy refusing first to marry, then to bury a Protestant. Orders\r\ngiven concerning the passage of the Imperial railway train. Soldiers\r\nkept sitting in the mud--cold, hungry, and cursing. Decrees issued\r\nrelating to the educational institutions of the Empress Mary Department.\r\nCorruption rampant in the foundling homes. An undeserved monument.\r\nThieving among the clergy. The reinforcement of the political police.\r\nA woman being searched. A prison for convicts who are sentenced to be\r\ndeported. A man being hanged for murdering a shop assistant.\r\n\r\nThen the result of military discipline: soldiers wearing uniform and\r\nscoffing at it. A gipsy encampment. The son of a millionaire exempted\r\nfrom military duty, while the only support of a large family is forced\r\nto serve. The university: a teacher relieved of military service, while\r\nthe most gifted musicians are compelled to perform it. Soldiers and\r\ntheir debauchery--and the spreading of disease.\r\n\r\nThen a soldier who has made an attempt to desert. He is being tried.\r\nAnother is on trial for striking an officer who has insulted his mother.\r\nHe is put to death. Others, again, are tried for having refused to\r\nshoot. The runaway soldier sent to a disciplinary battalion and flogged\r\nto death. Another, who is guiltless, flogged, and his wounds sprinkled\r\nwith salt till he dies. One of the superior officers stealing money\r\nbelonging to the soldiers. Nothing but drunkenness, debauchery,\r\ngambling, and arrogance on the part of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWhat is the general condition of the people: the children are\r\nhalf-starving and degenerate; the houses are full of vermin; an\r\neverlasting dull round of labour, of submission, and of sadness. On the\r\nother hand: ministers, governors of provinces, covetous, ambitious, full\r\nof vanity, and anxious to inspire fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where are men with human feelings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will show you where they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere is the cell of a woman in solitary confinement at Schlusselburg.\r\nShe is going mad. Here is another woman--a girl--indisposed, violated\r\nby soldiers. A man in exile, alone, embittered, half-dead. A prison for\r\nconvicts condemned to hard labour, and women flogged. They are many.\r\n\r\nTens of thousands of the best people. Some shut up in prisons, others\r\nruined by false education, by the vain desire to bring them up as we\r\nwish. But not succeeding in this, whatever might have been is ruined\r\nas well, for it is made impossible. It is as if we were trying to make\r\nbuckwheat out of corn sprouts by splitting the ears. One may spoil the\r\ncorn, but one could never change it to buckwheat. Thus all the youth of\r\nthe world, the entire younger generation, is being ruined.\r\n\r\nBut woe to those who destroy one of these little ones, woe to you if you\r\ndestroy even one of them. On your soul, however, are hosts of them,\r\nwho have been ruined in your name, all of those over whom your power\r\nextends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Tsar in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to\r\ntorture, to flog, to corrupt, to kill any one! I only want the welfare\r\nof all. Just as I yearn for happiness myself, so I want the world to be\r\nhappy as well. Am I actually responsible for everything that is done\r\nin my name? What can I do? What am I to do to rid myself of such a\r\nresponsibility? What can I do? I do not admit that the responsibility\r\nfor all this is mine. If I felt myself responsible for one-hundredth\r\npart of it, I would shoot myself on the spot. It would not be possible\r\nto live if that were true. But how can I put an end, to all this evil?\r\nIt is bound up with the very existence of the State. I am the head of\r\nthe State! What am I to do? Kill myself? Or abdicate? But that would\r\nmean renouncing my duty. O God, O God, God, help me!\xe2\x80\x9d He burst into\r\ntears and awoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow glad I am that it was only a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d was his first thought. But\r\nwhen he began to recollect what he had seen in his dream, and to compare\r\nit with actuality, he realised that the problem propounded to him in\r\ndream remained just as important and as insoluble now that he was\r\nawake. For the first time the young Tsar became aware of the heavy\r\nresponsibility weighing on him, and was aghast. His thoughts no longer\r\nturned to the young Queen and to the happiness he had anticipated for\r\nthat evening, but became centred on the unanswerable question which hung\r\nover him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a state of great agitation he arose and went into the next room. An\r\nold courtier, a co-worker and friend of his father\xe2\x80\x99s, was standing there\r\nin the middle of the room in conversation with the young Queen, who\r\nwas on her way to join her husband. The young Tsar approached them, and\r\naddressing his conversation principally to the old courtier, told him\r\nwhat he had seen in his dream and what doubts the dream had left in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a noble idea. It proves the rare nobility of your spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe old man. \xe2\x80\x9cBut forgive me for speaking frankly--you are too kind\r\nto be an emperor, and you exaggerate your responsibility. In the first\r\nplace, the state of things is not as you imagine it to be. The people\r\nare not poor. They are well-to-do. Those who are poor are poor through\r\ntheir own fault. Only the guilty are punished, and if an unavoidable\r\nmistake does sometimes occur, it is like a thunderbolt--an accident, or\r\nthe will of God. You have but one responsibility: to fulfil your task\r\ncourageously and to retain the power that is given to you. You wish the\r\nbest for your people and God sees that. As for the errors which you have\r\ncommitted unwittingly, you can pray for forgiveness, and God will guide\r\nyou and pardon you. All the more because you have done nothing that\r\ndemands forgiveness, and there never have been and never will be men\r\npossessed of such extraordinary qualities as you and your father.\r\nTherefore all we implore you to do is to live, and to reward our endless\r\ndevotion and love with your favour, and every one, save scoundrels who\r\ndeserve no happiness, will be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think about that?\xe2\x80\x9d the young Tsar asked his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a different opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clever young woman, who had been\r\nbrought up in a free country. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you had that dream, and I agree\r\nwith you that there are grave responsibilities resting upon you. I have\r\noften thought about it with great anxiety, and I think there is a simple\r\nmeans of casting off a part of the responsibility you are unable to\r\nbear, if not all of it. A large proportion of the power which is\r\ntoo heavy for you, you should delegate to the people, to its\r\nrepresentatives, reserving for yourself only the supreme control, that\r\nis, the general direction of the affairs of State.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Queen had hardly ceased to expound her views, when the old courtier\r\nbegan eagerly to refute her arguments, and they started a polite but\r\nvery heated discussion.\r\n\r\nFor a time the young Tsar followed their arguments, but presently he\r\nceased to be aware of what they said, listening only to the voice of him\r\nwho had been his guide in the dream, and who was now speaking audibly in\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not only the Tsar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut more. You are a human\r\nbeing, who only yesterday came into this world, and will perchance\r\nto-morrow depart out of it. Apart from your duties as a Tsar, of which\r\nthat old man is now speaking, you have more immediate duties not by any\r\nmeans to be disregarded; human duties, not the duties of a Tsar towards\r\nhis subjects, which are only accidental, but an eternal duty, the duty\r\nof a man in his relation to God, the duty toward your own soul, which is\r\nto save it, and also, to serve God in establishing his kingdom on earth.\r\nYou are not to be guarded in your actions either by what has been or\r\nwhat will be, but only by what it is your own duty to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes--his wife was awakening him. Which of the three\r\ncourses the young Tsar chose, will be told in fifty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FORGED COUPON AND OTHER STORIES ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
