B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Kaspar!  Makan!"\r\n\r\nThe well-known shrill voice startled Almayer from his dream of splendid\r\nfuture into the unpleasant realities of the present hour.  An unpleasant\r\nvoice too.  He had heard it for many years, and with every year he liked\r\nit less.  No matter; there would be an end to all this soon.\r\n\r\nHe shuffled uneasily, but took no further notice of the call.  Leaning\r\nwith both his elbows on the balustrade of the verandah, he went on\r\nlooking fixedly at the great river that flowed--indifferent and\r\nhurried--before his eyes.  He liked to look at it about the time of\r\nsunset; perhaps because at that time the sinking sun would spread a\r\nglowing gold tinge on the waters of the Pantai, and Almayer\'s thoughts\r\nwere often busy with gold; gold he had failed to secure; gold the others\r\nhad secured--dishonestly, of course--or gold he meant to secure yet,\r\nthrough his own honest exertions, for himself and Nina.  He absorbed\r\nhimself in his dream of wealth and power away from this coast where he\r\nhad dwelt for so many years, forgetting the bitterness of toil and strife\r\nin the vision of a great and splendid reward.  They would live in Europe,\r\nhe and his daughter.  They would be rich and respected.  Nobody would\r\nthink of her mixed blood in the presence of her great beauty and of his\r\nimmense wealth.  Witnessing her triumphs he would grow young again, he\r\nwould forget the twenty-five years of heart-breaking struggle on this\r\ncoast where he felt like a prisoner.  All this was nearly within his\r\nreach.  Let only Dain return!  And return soon he must--in his own\r\ninterest, for his own share.  He was now more than a week late!  Perhaps\r\nhe would return to-night.  Such were Almayer\'s thoughts as, standing on\r\nthe verandah of his new but already decaying house--that last failure of\r\nhis life--he looked on the broad river.  There was no tinge of gold on it\r\nthis evening, for it had been swollen by the rains, and rolled an angry\r\nand muddy flood under his inattentive eyes, carrying small drift-wood and\r\nbig dead logs, and whole uprooted trees with branches and foliage,\r\namongst which the water swirled and roared angrily.\r\n\r\nOne of those drifting trees grounded on the shelving shore, just by the\r\nhouse, and Almayer, neglecting his dream, watched it with languid\r\ninterest.  The tree swung slowly round, amid the hiss and foam of the\r\nwater, and soon getting free of the obstruction began to move down stream\r\nagain, rolling slowly over, raising upwards a long, denuded branch, like\r\na hand lifted in mute appeal to heaven against the river\'s brutal and\r\nunnecessary violence.  Almayer\'s interest in the fate of that tree\r\nincreased rapidly.  He leaned over to see if it would clear the low point\r\nbelow.  It did; then he drew back, thinking that now its course was free\r\ndown to the sea, and he envied the lot of that inanimate thing now\r\ngrowing small and indistinct in the deepening darkness.  As he lost sight\r\nof it altogether he began to wonder how far out to sea it would drift.\r\nWould the current carry it north or south?  South, probably, till it\r\ndrifted in sight of Celebes, as far as Macassar, perhaps!\r\n\r\nMacassar!  Almayer\'s quickened fancy distanced the tree on its imaginary\r\nvoyage, but his memory lagging behind some twenty years or more in point\r\nof time saw a young and slim Almayer, clad all in white and\r\nmodest-looking, landing from the Dutch mail-boat on the dusty jetty of\r\nMacassar, coming to woo fortune in the godowns of old Hudig.  It was an\r\nimportant epoch in his life, the beginning of a new existence for him.\r\nHis father, a subordinate official employed in the Botanical Gardens of\r\nBuitenzorg, was no doubt delighted to place his son in such a firm.  The\r\nyoung man himself too was nothing loth to leave the poisonous shores of\r\nJava, and the meagre comforts of the parental bungalow, where the father\r\ngrumbled all day at the stupidity of native gardeners, and the mother\r\nfrom the depths of her long easy-chair bewailed the lost glories of\r\nAmsterdam, where she had been brought up, and of her position as the\r\ndaughter of a cigar dealer there.\r\n\r\nAlmayer had left his home with a light heart and a lighter pocket,\r\nspeaking English well, and strong in arithmetic; ready to conquer the\r\nworld, never doubting that he would.\r\n\r\nAfter those twenty years, standing in the close and stifling heat of a\r\nBornean evening, he recalled with pleasurable regret the image of Hudig\'s\r\nlofty and cool warehouses with their long and straight avenues of gin\r\ncases and bales of Manchester goods; the big door swinging noiselessly;\r\nthe dim light of the place, so delightful after the glare of the streets;\r\nthe little railed-off spaces amongst piles of merchandise where the\r\nChinese clerks, neat, cool, and sad-eyed, wrote rapidly and in silence\r\namidst the din of the working gangs rolling casks or shifting cases to a\r\nmuttered song, ending with a desperate yell.  At the upper end, facing\r\nthe great door, there was a larger space railed off, well lighted; there\r\nthe noise was subdued by distance, and above it rose the soft and\r\ncontinuous clink of silver guilders which other discreet Chinamen were\r\ncounting and piling up under the supervision of Mr. Vinck, the cashier,\r\nthe genius presiding in the place--the right hand of the Master.\r\n\r\nIn that clear space Almayer worked at his table not far from a little\r\ngreen painted door, by which always stood a Malay in a red sash and\r\nturban, and whose hand, holding a small string dangling from above, moved\r\nup and down with the regularity of a machine.  The string worked a punkah\r\non the other side of the green door, where the so-called private office\r\nwas, and where old Hudig--the Master--sat enthroned, holding noisy\r\nreceptions.  Sometimes the little door would fly open disclosing to the\r\nouter world, through the bluish haze of tobacco smoke, a long table\r\nloaded with bottles of various shapes and tall water-pitchers, rattan\r\neasy-chairs occupied by noisy men in sprawling attitudes, while the\r\nMaster would put his head through and, holding by the handle, would grunt\r\nconfidentially to Vinck; perhaps send an order thundering down the\r\nwarehouse, or spy a hesitating stranger and greet him with a friendly\r\nroar, "Welgome, Gapitan! ver\' you gome vrom?  Bali, eh?  Got bonies?  I\r\nvant bonies!  Vant all you got; ha! ha! ha!  Gome in!"  Then the stranger\r\nwas dragged in, in a tempest of yells, the door was shut, and the usual\r\nnoises refilled the place; the song of the workmen, the rumble of\r\nbarrels, the scratch of rapid pens; while above all rose the musical\r\nchink of broad silver pieces streaming ceaselessly through the yellow\r\nfingers of the attentive Chinamen.\r\n\r\nAt that time Macassar was teeming with life and commerce.  It was the\r\npoint in the islands where tended all those bold spirits who, fitting out\r\nschooners on the Australian coast, invaded the Malay Archipelago in\r\nsearch of money and adventure.  Bold, reckless, keen in business, not\r\ndisinclined for a brush with the pirates that were to be found on many a\r\ncoast as yet, making money fast, they used to have a general "rendezvous"\r\nin the bay for purposes of trade and dissipation.  The Dutch merchants\r\ncalled those men English pedlars; some of them were undoubtedly gentlemen\r\nfor whom that kind of life had a charm; most were seamen; the\r\nacknowledged king of them all was Tom Lingard, he whom the Malays, honest\r\nor dishonest, quiet fishermen or desperate cut-throats, recognised as\r\n"the Rajah-Laut"--the King of the Sea.\r\n\r\nAlmayer had heard of him before he had been three days in Macassar, had\r\nheard the stories of his smart business transactions, his loves, and also\r\nof his desperate fights with the Sulu pirates, together with the romantic\r\ntale of some child--a girl--found in a piratical prau by the victorious\r\nLingard, when, after a long contest, he boarded the craft, driving the\r\ncrew overboard.  This girl, it was generally known, Lingard had adopted,\r\nwas having her educated in some convent in Java, and spoke of her as "my\r\ndaughter."  He had sworn a mighty oath to marry her to a white man before\r\nhe went home and to leave her all his money.  "And Captain Lingard has\r\nlots of money," would say Mr. Vinck solemnly, with his head on one side,\r\n"lots of money; more than Hudig!"  And after a pause--just to let his\r\nhearers recover from their astonishment at such an incredible\r\nassertion--he would add in an explanatory whisper, "You know, he has\r\ndiscovered a river."\r\n\r\nThat was it!  He had discovered a river!  That was the fact placing old\r\nLingard so much above the common crowd of sea-going adventurers who\r\ntraded with Hudig in the daytime and drank champagne, gambled, sang noisy\r\nsongs, and made love to half-caste girls under the broad verandah of the\r\nSunda Hotel at night.  Into that river, whose entrances himself only\r\nknew, Lingard used to take his assorted cargo of Manchester goods, brass\r\ngongs, rifles and gunpowder.  His brig _Flash_, which he commanded\r\nhimself, would on those occasions disappear quietly during the night from\r\nthe roadstead while his companions were sleeping off the effects of the\r\nmidnight carouse, Lingard seeing them drunk under the table before going\r\non board, himself unaffected by any amount of liquor.  Many tried to\r\nfollow him and find that land of plenty for gutta-percha and rattans,\r\npearl shells and birds\' nests, wax and gum-dammar, but the little _Flash_\r\ncould outsail every craft in those seas.  A few of them came to grief on\r\nhidden sandbanks and coral reefs, losing their all and barely escaping\r\nwith life from the cruel grip of this sunny and smiling sea; others got\r\ndiscouraged; and for many years the green and peaceful-looking islands\r\nguarding the entrances to the promised land kept their secret with all\r\nthe merciless serenity of tropical nature.  And so Lingard came and went\r\non his secret or open expeditions, becoming a hero in Almayer\'s eyes by\r\nthe boldness and enormous profits of his ventures, seeming to Almayer a\r\nvery great man indeed as he saw him marching up the warehouse, grunting a\r\n"how are you?" to Vinck, or greeting Hudig, the Master, with a boisterous\r\n"Hallo, old pirate!  Alive yet?" as a preliminary to transacting business\r\nbehind the little green door.  Often of an evening, in the silence of the\r\nthen deserted warehouse, Almayer putting away his papers before driving\r\nhome with Mr. Vinck, in whose household he lived, would pause listening\r\nto the noise of a hot discussion in the private office, would hear the\r\ndeep and monotonous growl of the Master, and the roared-out interruptions\r\nof Lingard--two mastiffs fighting over a marrowy bone.  But to Almayer\'s\r\nears it sounded like a quarrel of Titans--a battle of the gods.\r\n\r\nAfter a year or so Lingard, having been brought often in contact with\r\nAlmayer in the course of business, took a sudden and, to the onlookers, a\r\nrather inexplicable fancy to the young man.  He sang his praises, late at\r\nnight, over a convivial glass to his cronies in the Sunda Hotel, and one\r\nfine morning electrified Vinck by declaring that he must have "that young\r\nfellow for a supercargo.  Kind of captain\'s clerk.  Do all my\r\nquill-driving for me."  Hudig consented.  Almayer, with youth\'s natural\r\ncraving for change, was nothing loth, and packing his few belongings,\r\nstarted in the _Flash_ on one of those long cruises when the old seaman\r\nwas wont to visit almost every island in the archipelago.  Months slipped\r\nby, and Lingard\'s friendship seemed to increase.  Often pacing the deck\r\nwith Almayer, when the faint night breeze, heavy with aromatic\r\nexhalations of the islands, shoved the brig gently along under the\r\npeaceful and sparkling sky, did the old seaman open his heart to his\r\nentranced listener.  He spoke of his past life, of escaped dangers, of\r\nbig profits in his trade, of new combinations that were in the future to\r\nbring profits bigger still.  Often he had mentioned his daughter, the\r\ngirl found in the pirate prau, speaking of her with a strange assumption\r\nof fatherly tenderness.  "She must be a big girl now," he used to say.\r\n"It\'s nigh unto four years since I have seen her!  Damme, Almayer, if I\r\ndon\'t think we will run into Sourabaya this trip."  And after such a\r\ndeclaration he always dived into his cabin muttering to himself,\r\n"Something must be done--must be done."  More than once he would astonish\r\nAlmayer by walking up to him rapidly, clearing his throat with a powerful\r\n"Hem!" as if he was going to say something, and then turning abruptly\r\naway to lean over the bulwarks in silence, and watch, motionless, for\r\nhours, the gleam and sparkle of the phosphorescent sea along the ship\'s\r\nside.  It was the night before arriving in Sourabaya when one of those\r\nattempts at confidential communication succeeded.  After clearing his\r\nthroat he spoke.  He spoke to some purpose.  He wanted Almayer to marry\r\nhis adopted daughter.  "And don\'t you kick because you\'re white!" he\r\nshouted, suddenly, not giving the surprised young man the time to say a\r\nword.  "None of that with me!  Nobody will see the colour of your wife\'s\r\nskin.  The dollars are too thick for that, I tell you!  And mind you,\r\nthey will be thicker yet before I die.  There will be millions, Kaspar!\r\nMillions I say!  And all for her--and for you, if you do what you are\r\ntold."\r\n\r\nStartled by the unexpected proposal, Almayer hesitated, and remained\r\nsilent for a minute.  He was gifted with a strong and active imagination,\r\nand in that short space of time he saw, as in a flash of dazzling light,\r\ngreat piles of shining guilders, and realised all the possibilities of an\r\nopulent existence.  The consideration, the indolent ease of life--for\r\nwhich he felt himself so well fitted--his ships, his warehouses, his\r\nmerchandise (old Lingard would not live for ever), and, crowning all, in\r\nthe far future gleamed like a fairy palace the big mansion in Amsterdam,\r\nthat earthly paradise of his dreams, where, made king amongst men by old\r\nLingard\'s money, he would pass the evening of his days in inexpressible\r\nsplendour.  As to the other side of the picture--the companionship for\r\nlife of a Malay girl, that legacy of a boatful of pirates--there was only\r\nwithin him a confused consciousness of shame that he a white man--Still,\r\na convent education of four years!--and then she may mercifully die.  He\r\nwas always lucky, and money is powerful!  Go through it.  Why not?  He\r\nhad a vague idea of shutting her up somewhere, anywhere, out of his\r\ngorgeous future.  Easy enough to dispose of a Malay woman, a slave, after\r\nall, to his Eastern mind, convent or no convent, ceremony or no ceremony.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his head and confronted the anxious yet irate seaman.\r\n\r\n"I--of course--anything you wish, Captain Lingard."\r\n\r\n"Call me father, my boy.  She does," said the mollified old adventurer.\r\n"Damme, though, if I didn\'t think you were going to refuse.  Mind you,\r\nKaspar, I always get my way, so it would have been no use.  But you are\r\nno fool."\r\n\r\nHe remembered well that time--the look, the accent, the words, the effect\r\nthey produced on him, his very surroundings.  He remembered the narrow\r\nslanting deck of the brig, the silent sleeping coast, the smooth black\r\nsurface of the sea with a great bar of gold laid on it by the rising\r\nmoon.  He remembered it all, and he remembered his feelings of mad\r\nexultation at the thought of that fortune thrown into his hands.  He was\r\nno fool then, and he was no fool now.  Circumstances had been against\r\nhim; the fortune was gone, but hope remained.\r\n\r\nHe shivered in the night air, and suddenly became aware of the intense\r\ndarkness which, on the sun\'s departure, had closed in upon the river,\r\nblotting out the outlines of the opposite shore.  Only the fire of dry\r\nbranches lit outside the stockade of the Rajah\'s compound called fitfully\r\ninto view the ragged trunks of the surrounding trees, putting a stain of\r\nglowing red half-way across the river where the drifting logs were\r\nhurrying towards the sea through the impenetrable gloom.  He had a hazy\r\nrecollection of having been called some time during the evening by his\r\nwife.  To his dinner probably.  But a man busy contemplating the wreckage\r\nof his past in the dawn of new hopes cannot be hungry whenever his rice\r\nis ready.  Time he went home, though; it was getting late.\r\n\r\nHe stepped cautiously on the loose planks towards the ladder.  A lizard,\r\ndisturbed by the noise, emitted a plaintive note and scurried through the\r\nlong grass growing on the bank.  Almayer descended the ladder carefully,\r\nnow thoroughly recalled to the realities of life by the care necessary to\r\nprevent a fall on the uneven ground where the stones, decaying planks,\r\nand half-sawn beams were piled up in inextricable confusion.  As he\r\nturned towards the house where he lived--"my old house" he called it--his\r\near detected the splash of paddles away in the darkness of the river.  He\r\nstood still in the path, attentive and surprised at anybody being on the\r\nriver at this late hour during such a heavy freshet.  Now he could hear\r\nthe paddles distinctly, and even a rapidly exchanged word in low tones,\r\nthe heavy breathing of men fighting with the current, and hugging the\r\nbank on which he stood.  Quite close, too, but it was too dark to\r\ndistinguish anything under the overhanging bushes.\r\n\r\n"Arabs, no doubt," muttered Almayer to himself, peering into the solid\r\nblackness.  "What are they up to now?  Some of Abdulla\'s business; curse\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\nThe boat was very close now.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ya!  Man!" hailed Almayer.\r\n\r\nThe sound of voices ceased, but the paddles worked as furiously as\r\nbefore.  Then the bush in front of Almayer shook, and the sharp sound of\r\nthe paddles falling into the canoe rang in the quiet night.  They were\r\nholding on to the bush now; but Almayer could hardly make out an\r\nindistinct dark shape of a man\'s head and shoulders above the bank.\r\n\r\n"You Abdulla?" said Almayer, doubtfully.\r\n\r\nA grave voice answered--\r\n\r\n"Tuan Almayer is speaking to a friend.  There is no Arab here."\r\n\r\nAlmayer\'s heart gave a great leap.\r\n\r\n"Dain!" he exclaimed.  "At last! at last!  I have been waiting for you\r\nevery day and every night.  I had nearly given you up."\r\n\r\n"Nothing could have stopped me from coming back here," said the other,\r\nalmost violently.  "Not even death," he whispered to himself.\r\n\r\n"This is a friend\'s talk, and is very good," said Almayer, heartily.  "But\r\nyou are too far here.  Drop down to the jetty and let your men cook their\r\nrice in my campong while we talk in the house."\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to that invitation.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked Almayer, uneasily.  "There is nothing wrong with the\r\nbrig, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"The brig is where no Orang Blanda can lay his hands on her," said Dain,\r\nwith a gloomy tone in his voice, which Almayer, in his elation, failed to\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n"Right," he said.  "But where are all your men?  There are only two with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Listen, Tuan Almayer," said Dain.  "To-morrow\'s sun shall see me in your\r\nhouse, and then we will talk.  Now I must go to the Rajah."\r\n\r\n"To the Rajah!  Why?  What do you want with Lakamba?"\r\n\r\n"Tuan, to-morrow we talk like friends.  I must see Lakamba to-night."\r\n\r\n"Dain, you are not going to abandon me now, when all is ready?" asked\r\nAlmayer, in a pleading voice.\r\n\r\n"Have I not returned?  But I must see Lakamba first for your good and\r\nmine."\r\n\r\nThe shadowy head disappeared abruptly.  The bush, released from the grasp\r\nof the bowman, sprung back with a swish, scattering a shower of muddy\r\nwater over Almayer, as he bent forward, trying to see.\r\n\r\nIn a little while the canoe shot into the streak of light that streamed\r\non the river from the big fire on the opposite shore, disclosing the\r\noutline of two men bending to their work, and a third figure in the stern\r\nflourishing the steering paddle, his head covered with an enormous round\r\nhat, like a fantastically exaggerated mushroom.\r\n\r\nAlmayer watched the canoe till it passed out of the line of light.\r\nShortly after the murmur of many voices reached him across the water.  He\r\ncould see the torches being snatched out of the burning pile, and\r\nrendering visible for a moment the gate in the stockade round which they\r\ncrowded.  Then they went in apparently.  The torches disappeared, and the\r\nscattered fire sent out only a dim and fitful glare.\r\n\r\nAlmayer stepped homewards with long strides and mind uneasy.  Surely Dain\r\nwas not thinking of playing him false.  It was absurd.  Dain and Lakamba\r\nwere both too much interested in the success of his scheme.  Trusting to\r\nMalays was poor work; but then even Malays have some sense and understand\r\ntheir own interest.  All would be well--must be well.  At this point in\r\nhis meditation he found himself at the foot of the steps leading to the\r\nverandah of his home.  From the low point of land where he stood he could\r\nsee both branches of the river.  The main branch of the Pantai was lost\r\nin complete darkness, for the fire at the Rajah\'s had gone out\r\naltogether; but up the Sambir reach his eye could follow the long line of\r\nMalay houses crowding the bank, with here and there a dim light twinkling\r\nthrough bamboo walls, or a smoky torch burning on the platforms built out\r\nover the river.  Further away, where the island ended in a low cliff,\r\nrose a dark mass of buildings towering above the Malay structures.\r\nFounded solidly on a firm ground with plenty of space, starred by many\r\nlights burning strong and white, with a suggestion of paraffin and lamp-\r\nglasses, stood the house and the godowns of Abdulla bin Selim, the great\r\ntrader of Sambir.  To Almayer the sight was very distasteful, and he\r\nshook his fist towards the buildings that in their evident prosperity\r\nlooked to him cold and insolent, and contemptuous of his own fallen\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\nHe mounted the steps of his house slowly.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the verandah there was a round table.  On it a paraffin\r\nlamp without a globe shed a hard glare on the three inner sides.  The\r\nfourth side was open, and faced the river.  Between the rough supports of\r\nthe high-pitched roof hung torn rattan screens.  There was no ceiling,\r\nand the harsh brilliance of the lamp was toned above into a soft half-\r\nlight that lost itself in the obscurity amongst the rafters.  The front\r\nwall was cut in two by the doorway of a central passage closed by a red\r\ncurtain.  The women\'s room opened into that passage, which led to the\r\nback courtyard and to the cooking shed.  In one of the side walls there\r\nwas a doorway.  Half obliterated words--"Office: Lingard and Co."--were\r\nstill legible on the dusty door, which looked as if it had not been\r\nopened for a very long time.  Close to the other side wall stood a bent-\r\nwood rocking-chair, and by the table and about the verandah four wooden\r\narmchairs straggled forlornly, as if ashamed of their shabby\r\nsurroundings.  A heap of common mats lay in one corner, with an old\r\nhammock slung diagonally above.  In the other corner, his head wrapped in\r\na piece of red calico, huddled into a shapeless heap, slept a Malay, one\r\nof Almayer\'s domestic slaves--"my own people," he used to call them.  A\r\nnumerous and representative assembly of moths were holding high revels\r\nround the lamp to the spirited music of swarming mosquitoes.  Under the\r\npalm-leaf thatch lizards raced on the beams calling softly.  A monkey,\r\nchained to one of the verandah supports--retired for the night under the\r\neaves--peered and grinned at Almayer, as it swung to one of the bamboo\r\nroof sticks and caused a shower of dust and bits of dried leaves to\r\nsettle on the shabby table.  The floor was uneven, with many withered\r\nplants and dried earth scattered about.  A general air of squalid neglect\r\npervaded the place.  Great red stains on the floor and walls testified to\r\nfrequent and indiscriminate betel-nut chewing.  The light breeze from the\r\nriver swayed gently the tattered blinds, sending from the woods opposite\r\na faint and sickly perfume as of decaying flowers.\r\n\r\nUnder Almayer\'s heavy tread the boards of the verandah creaked loudly.\r\nThe sleeper in the corner moved uneasily, muttering indistinct words.\r\nThere was a slight rustle behind the curtained doorway, and a soft voice\r\nasked in Malay, "Is it you, father?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Nina.  I am hungry.  Is everybody asleep in this house?"\r\n\r\nAlmayer spoke jovially and dropped with a contented sigh into the\r\narmchair nearest to the table.  Nina Almayer came through the curtained\r\ndoorway followed by an old Malay woman, who busied herself in setting\r\nupon the table a plateful of rice and fish, a jar of water, and a bottle\r\nhalf full of genever.  After carefully placing before her master a\r\ncracked glass tumbler and a tin spoon she went away noiselessly.  Nina\r\nstood by the table, one hand lightly resting on its edge, the other\r\nhanging listlessly by her side.  Her face turned towards the outer\r\ndarkness, through which her dreamy eyes seemed to see some entrancing\r\npicture, wore a look of impatient expectancy.  She was tall for a half-\r\ncaste, with the correct profile of the father, modified and strengthened\r\nby the squareness of the lower part of the face inherited from her\r\nmaternal ancestors--the Sulu pirates.  Her firm mouth, with the lips\r\nslightly parted and disclosing a gleam of white teeth, put a vague\r\nsuggestion of ferocity into the impatient expression of her features.  And\r\nyet her dark and perfect eyes had all the tender softness of expression\r\ncommon to Malay women, but with a gleam of superior intelligence; they\r\nlooked gravely, wide open and steady, as if facing something invisible to\r\nall other eyes, while she stood there all in white, straight, flexible,\r\ngraceful, unconscious of herself, her low but broad forehead crowned with\r\na shining mass of long black hair that fell in heavy tresses over her\r\nshoulders, and made her pale olive complexion look paler still by the\r\ncontrast of its coal-black hue.\r\n\r\nAlmayer attacked his rice greedily, but after a few mouthfuls he paused,\r\nspoon in hand, and looked at his daughter curiously.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear a boat pass about half an hour ago Nina?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe girl gave him a quick glance, and moving away from the light stood\r\nwith her back to the table.\r\n\r\n"No," she said, slowly.\r\n\r\n"There was a boat.  At last!  Dain himself; and he went on to Lakamba.  I\r\nknow it, for he told me so.  I spoke to him, but he would not come here\r\nto-night.  Will come to-morrow, he said."\r\n\r\nHe swallowed another spoonful, then said--\r\n\r\n"I am almost happy to-night, Nina.  I can see the end of a long road, and\r\nit leads us away from this miserable swamp.  We shall soon get away from\r\nhere, I and you, my dear little girl, and then--"\r\n\r\nHe rose from the table and stood looking fixedly before him as if\r\ncontemplating some enchanting vision.\r\n\r\n"And then," he went on, "we shall be happy, you and I.  Live rich and\r\nrespected far from here, and forget this life, and all this struggle, and\r\nall this misery!"\r\n\r\nHe approached his daughter and passed his hand caressingly over her hair.\r\n\r\n"It is bad to have to trust a Malay," he said, "but I must own that this\r\nDain is a perfect gentleman--a perfect gentleman," he repeated.\r\n\r\n"Did you ask him to come here, father?" inquired Nina, not looking at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course.  We shall start on the day after to-morrow," said\r\nAlmayer, joyously.  "We must not lose any time.  Are you glad, little\r\ngirl?"\r\n\r\nShe was nearly as tall as himself, but he liked to recall the time when\r\nshe was little and they were all in all to each other.\r\n\r\n"I am glad," she said, very low.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Almayer, vivaciously, "you cannot imagine what is\r\nbefore you.  I myself have not been to Europe, but I have heard my mother\r\ntalk so often that I seem to know all about it.  We shall live a--a\r\nglorious life.  You shall see."\r\n\r\nAgain he stood silent by his daughter\'s side looking at that enchanting\r\nvision.  After a while he shook his clenched hand towards the sleeping\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n"Ah! my friend Abdulla," he cried, "we shall see who will have the best\r\nof it after all these years!"\r\n\r\nHe looked up the river and remarked calmly:\r\n\r\n"Another thunderstorm.  Well!  No thunder will keep me awake to-night, I\r\nknow!  Good-night, little girl," he whispered, tenderly kissing her\r\ncheek.  "You do not seem to be very happy to-night, but to-morrow you\r\nwill show a brighter face.  Eh?"\r\n\r\nNina had listened to her father with her face unmoved, with her\r\nhalf-closed eyes still gazing into the night now made more intense by a\r\nheavy thunder-cloud that had crept down from the hills blotting out the\r\nstars, merging sky, forest, and river into one mass of almost palpable\r\nblackness.  The faint breeze had died out, but the distant rumble of\r\nthunder and pale flashes of lightning gave warning of the approaching\r\nstorm.  With a sigh the girl turned towards the table.\r\n\r\nAlmayer was in his hammock now, already half asleep.\r\n\r\n"Take the lamp, Nina," he muttered, drowsily.  "This place is full of\r\nmosquitoes.  Go to sleep, daughter."\r\n\r\nBut Nina put the lamp out and turned back again towards the balustrade of\r\nthe verandah, standing with her arm round the wooden support and looking\r\neagerly towards the Pantai reach.  And motionless there in the oppressive\r\ncalm of the tropical night she could see at each flash of lightning the\r\nforest lining both banks up the river, bending before the furious blast\r\nof the coming tempest, the upper reach of the river whipped into white\r\nfoam by the wind, and the black clouds torn into fantastic shapes\r\ntrailing low over the swaying trees.  Round her all was as yet stillness\r\nand peace, but she could hear afar off the roar of the wind, the hiss of\r\nheavy rain, the wash of the waves on the tormented river.  It came nearer\r\nand nearer, with loud thunder-claps and long flashes of vivid lightning,\r\nfollowed by short periods of appalling blackness.  When the storm reached\r\nthe low point dividing the river, the house shook in the wind, and the\r\nrain pattered loudly on the palm-leaf roof, the thunder spoke in one\r\nprolonged roll, and the incessant lightning disclosed a turmoil of\r\nleaping waters, driving logs, and the big trees bending before a brutal\r\nand merciless force.\r\n\r\nUndisturbed by the nightly event of the rainy monsoon, the father slept\r\nquietly, oblivious alike of his hopes, his misfortunes, his friends, and\r\nhis enemies; and the daughter stood motionless, at each flash of\r\nlightning eagerly scanning the broad river with a steady and anxious\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in compliance with Lingard\'s abrupt demand, Almayer consented to\r\nwed the Malay girl, no one knew that on the day when the interesting\r\nyoung convert had lost all her natural relations and found a white\r\nfather, she had been fighting desperately like the rest of them on board\r\nthe prau, and was only prevented from leaping overboard, like the few\r\nother survivors, by a severe wound in the leg.  There, on the fore-deck\r\nof the prau, old Lingard found her under a heap of dead and dying\r\npirates, and had her carried on the poop of the _Flash_ before the Malay\r\ncraft was set on fire and sent adrift.  She was conscious, and in the\r\ngreat peace and stillness of the tropical evening succeeding the turmoil\r\nof the battle, she watched all she held dear on earth after her own\r\nsavage manner, drift away into the gloom in a great roar of flame and\r\nsmoke.  She lay there unheeding the careful hands attending to her wound,\r\nsilent and absorbed in gazing at the funeral pile of those brave men she\r\nhad so much admired and so well helped in their contest with the\r\nredoubtable "Rajah-Laut."\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe light night breeze fanned the brig gently to the southward, and the\r\ngreat blaze of light got smaller and smaller till it twinkled only on the\r\nhorizon like a setting star.  It set: the heavy canopy of smoke reflected\r\nthe glare of hidden flames for a short time and then disappeared also.\r\n\r\nShe realised that with this vanishing gleam her old life departed too.\r\nThenceforth there was slavery in the far countries, amongst strangers, in\r\nunknown and perhaps terrible surroundings.  Being fourteen years old, she\r\nrealised her position and came to that conclusion, the only one possible\r\nto a Malay girl, soon ripened under a tropical sun, and not unaware of\r\nher personal charms, of which she heard many a young brave warrior of her\r\nfather\'s crew express an appreciative admiration.  There was in her the\r\ndread of the unknown; otherwise she accepted her position calmly, after\r\nthe manner of her people, and even considered it quite natural; for was\r\nshe not a daughter of warriors, conquered in battle, and did she not\r\nbelong rightfully to the victorious Rajah?  Even the evident kindness of\r\nthe terrible old man must spring, she thought, from admiration for his\r\ncaptive, and the flattered vanity eased for her the pangs of sorrow after\r\nsuch an awful calamity.  Perhaps had she known of the high walls, the\r\nquiet gardens, and the silent nuns of the Samarang convent, where her\r\ndestiny was leading her, she would have sought death in her dread and\r\nhate of such a restraint.  But in imagination she pictured to herself the\r\nusual life of a Malay girl--the usual succession of heavy work and fierce\r\nlove, of intrigues, gold ornaments, of domestic drudgery, and of that\r\ngreat but occult influence which is one of the few rights of half-savage\r\nwomankind.  But her destiny in the rough hands of the old sea-dog, acting\r\nunder unreasoning impulses of the heart, took a strange and to her a\r\nterrible shape.  She bore it all--the restraint and the teaching and the\r\nnew faith--with calm submission, concealing her hate and contempt for all\r\nthat new life.  She learned the language very easily, yet understood but\r\nlittle of the new faith the good sisters taught her, assimilating quickly\r\nonly the superstitious elements of the religion.  She called Lingard\r\nfather, gently and caressingly, at each of his short and noisy visits,\r\nunder the clear impression that he was a great and dangerous power it was\r\ngood to propitiate.  Was he not now her master?  And during those long\r\nfour years she nourished a hope of finding favour in his eyes and\r\nultimately becoming his wife, counsellor, and guide.\r\n\r\nThose dreams of the future were dispelled by the Rajah Laut\'s "fiat,"\r\nwhich made Almayer\'s fortune, as that young man fondly hoped.  And\r\ndressed in the hateful finery of Europe, the centre of an interested\r\ncircle of Batavian society, the young convert stood before the altar with\r\nan unknown and sulky-looking white man.  For Almayer was uneasy, a little\r\ndisgusted, and greatly inclined to run away.  A judicious fear of the\r\nadopted father-in-law and a just regard for his own material welfare\r\nprevented him from making a scandal; yet, while swearing fidelity, he was\r\nconcocting plans for getting rid of the pretty Malay girl in a more or\r\nless distant future.  She, however, had retained enough of conventual\r\nteaching to understand well that according to white men\'s laws she was\r\ngoing to be Almayer\'s companion and not his slave, and promised to\r\nherself to act accordingly.\r\n\r\nSo when the _Flash_ freighted with materials for building a new house\r\nleft the harbour of Batavia, taking away the young couple into the\r\nunknown Borneo, she did not carry on her deck so much love and happiness\r\nas old Lingard was wont to boast of before his casual friends in the\r\nverandahs of various hotels.  The old seaman himself was perfectly happy.\r\nNow he had done his duty by the girl.  "You know I made her an orphan,"\r\nhe often concluded solemnly, when talking about his own affairs to a\r\nscratch audience of shore loafers--as it was his habit to do.  And the\r\napprobative shouts of his half-intoxicated auditors filled his simple\r\nsoul with delight and pride.  "I carry everything right through," was\r\nanother of his sayings, and in pursuance of that principle he pushed the\r\nbuilding of house and godowns on the Pantai River with feverish haste.\r\nThe house for the young couple; the godowns for the big trade Almayer was\r\ngoing to develop while he (Lingard) would be able to give himself up to\r\nsome mysterious work which was only spoken of in hints, but was\r\nunderstood to relate to gold and diamonds in the interior of the island.\r\nAlmayer was impatient too.  Had he known what was before him he might not\r\nhave been so eager and full of hope as he stood watching the last canoe\r\nof the Lingard expedition disappear in the bend up the river.  When,\r\nturning round, he beheld the pretty little house, the big godowns built\r\nneatly by an army of Chinese carpenters, the new jetty round which were\r\nclustered the trading canoes, he felt a sudden elation in the thought\r\nthat the world was his.\r\n\r\nBut the world had to be conquered first, and its conquest was not so easy\r\nas he thought.  He was very soon made to understand that he was not\r\nwanted in that corner of it where old Lingard and his own weak will\r\nplaced him, in the midst of unscrupulous intrigues and of a fierce trade\r\ncompetition.  The Arabs had found out the river, had established a\r\ntrading post in Sambir, and where they traded they would be masters and\r\nsuffer no rival.  Lingard returned unsuccessful from his first\r\nexpedition, and departed again spending all the profits of the legitimate\r\ntrade on his mysterious journeys.  Almayer struggled with the\r\ndifficulties of his position, friendless and unaided, save for the\r\nprotection given to him for Lingard\'s sake by the old Rajah, the\r\npredecessor of Lakamba.  Lakamba himself, then living as a private\r\nindividual on a rice clearing, seven miles down the river, exercised all\r\nhis influence towards the help of the white man\'s enemies, plotting\r\nagainst the old Rajah and Almayer with a certainty of combination,\r\npointing clearly to a profound knowledge of their most secret affairs.\r\nOutwardly friendly, his portly form was often to be seen on Almayer\'s\r\nverandah; his green turban and gold-embroidered jacket shone in the front\r\nrank of the decorous throng of Malays coming to greet Lingard on his\r\nreturns from the interior; his salaams were of the lowest, and his hand-\r\nshakings of the heartiest, when welcoming the old trader.  But his small\r\neyes took in the signs of the times, and he departed from those\r\ninterviews with a satisfied and furtive smile to hold long consultations\r\nwith his friend and ally, Syed Abdulla, the chief of the Arab trading\r\npost, a man of great wealth and of great influence in the islands.\r\n\r\nIt was currently believed at that time in the settlement that Lakamba\'s\r\nvisits to Almayer\'s house were not limited to those official interviews.\r\nOften on moonlight nights the belated fishermen of Sambira saw a small\r\ncanoe shooting out from the narrow creek at the back of the white man\'s\r\nhouse, and the solitary occupant paddle cautiously down the river in the\r\ndeep shadows of the bank; and those events, duly reported, were discussed\r\nround the evening fires far into the night with the cynicism of\r\nexpression common to aristocratic Malays, and with a malicious pleasure\r\nin the domestic misfortunes of the Orang Blando--the hated Dutchman.\r\nAlmayer went on struggling desperately, but with a feebleness of purpose\r\ndepriving him of all chance of success against men so unscrupulous and\r\nresolute as his rivals the Arabs.  The trade fell away from the large\r\ngodowns, and the godowns themselves rotted piecemeal.  The old man\'s\r\nbanker, Hudig of Macassar, failed, and with this went the whole available\r\ncapital.  The profits of past years had been swallowed up in Lingard\'s\r\nexploring craze.  Lingard was in the interior--perhaps dead--at all\r\nevents giving no sign of life.  Almayer stood alone in the midst of those\r\nadverse circumstances, deriving only a little comfort from the\r\ncompanionship of his little daughter, born two years after the marriage,\r\nand at the time some six years old.  His wife had soon commenced to treat\r\nhim with a savage contempt expressed by sulky silence, only occasionally\r\nvaried by a flood of savage invective.  He felt she hated him, and saw\r\nher jealous eyes watching himself and the child with almost an expression\r\nof hate.  She was jealous of the little girl\'s evident preference for the\r\nfather, and Almayer felt he was not safe with that woman in the house.\r\nWhile she was burning the furniture, and tearing down the pretty curtains\r\nin her unreasoning hate of those signs of civilisation, Almayer, cowed by\r\nthese outbursts of savage nature, meditated in silence on the best way of\r\ngetting rid of her.  He thought of everything; even planned murder in an\r\nundecided and feeble sort of way, but dared do nothing--expecting every\r\nday the return of Lingard with news of some immense good fortune.  He\r\nreturned indeed, but aged, ill, a ghost of his former self, with the fire\r\nof fever burning in his sunken eyes, almost the only survivor of the\r\nnumerous expedition.  But he was successful at last!  Untold riches were\r\nin his grasp; he wanted more money--only a little more torealise a dream\r\nof fabulous fortune.  And Hudig had failed!  Almayer scraped all he could\r\ntogether, but the old man wanted more.  If Almayer could not get it he\r\nwould go to Singapore--to Europe even, but before all to Singapore; and\r\nhe would take the little Nina with him.  The child must be brought up\r\ndecently.  He had good friends in Singapore who would take care of her\r\nand have her taught properly.  All would be well, and that girl, upon\r\nwhom the old seaman seemed to have transferred all his former affection\r\nfor the mother, would be the richest woman in the East--in the world\r\neven.  So old Lingard shouted, pacing the verandah with his heavy quarter-\r\ndeck step, gesticulating with a smouldering cheroot; ragged, dishevelled,\r\nenthusiastic; and Almayer, sitting huddled up on a pile of mats, thought\r\nwith dread of the separation with the only human being he loved--with\r\ngreater dread still, perhaps, of the scene with his wife, the savage\r\ntigress deprived of her young.  She will poison me, thought the poor\r\nwretch, well aware of that easy and final manner of solving the social,\r\npolitical, or family problems in Malay life.\r\n\r\nTo his great surprise she took the news very quietly, giving only him and\r\nLingard a furtive glance, and saying not a word.  This, however, did not\r\nprevent her the next day from jumping into the river and swimming after\r\nthe boat in which Lingard was carrying away the nurse with the screaming\r\nchild.  Almayer had to give chase with his whale-boat and drag her in by\r\nthe hair in the midst of cries and curses enough to make heaven fall.  Yet\r\nafter two days spent in wailing, she returned to her former mode of life,\r\nchewing betel-nut, and sitting all day amongst her women in stupefied\r\nidleness.  She aged very rapidly after that, and only roused herself from\r\nher apathy to acknowledge by a scathing remark or an insulting\r\nexclamation the accidental presence of her husband.  He had built for her\r\na riverside hut in the compound where she dwelt in perfect seclusion.\r\nLakamba\'s visits had ceased when, by a convenient decree of Providence\r\nand the help of a little scientific manipulation, the old ruler of Sambir\r\ndeparted this life.  Lakamba reigned in his stead now, having been well\r\nserved by his Arab friends with the Dutch authorities.  Syed Abdulla was\r\nthe great man and trader of the Pantai.  Almayer lay ruined and helpless\r\nunder the close-meshed net of their intrigues, owing his life only to his\r\nsupposed knowledge of Lingard\'s valuable secret.  Lingard had\r\ndisappeared.  He wrote once from Singapore saying the child was well, and\r\nunder the care of a Mrs. Vinck, and that he himself was going to Europe\r\nto raise money for the great enterprise.  "He was coming back soon.  There\r\nwould be no difficulties," he wrote; "people would rush in with their\r\nmoney."  Evidently they did not, for there was only one letter more from\r\nhim saying he was ill, had found no relation living, but little else\r\nbesides.  Then came a complete silence.  Europe had swallowed up the\r\nRajah Laut apparently, and Almayer looked vainly westward for a ray of\r\nlight out of the gloom of his shattered hopes.  Years passed, and the\r\nrare letters from Mrs. Vinck, later on from the girl herself, were the\r\nonly thing to be looked to to make life bearable amongst the triumphant\r\nsavagery of the river.  Almayer lived now alone, having even ceased to\r\nvisit his debtors who would not pay, sure of Lakamba\'s protection.  The\r\nfaithful Sumatrese Ali cooked his rice and made his coffee, for he dared\r\nnot trust any one else, and least of all his wife.  He killed time\r\nwandering sadly in the overgrown paths round the house, visiting the\r\nruined godowns where a few brass guns covered with verdigris and only a\r\nfew broken cases of mouldering Manchester goods reminded him of the good\r\nearly times when all this was full of life and merchandise, and he\r\noverlooked a busy scene on the river bank, his little daughter by his\r\nside.  Now the up-country canoes glided past the little rotten wharf of\r\nLingard and Co., to paddle up the Pantai branch, and cluster round the\r\nnew jetty belonging to Abdulla.  Not that they loved Abdulla, but they\r\ndared not trade with the man whose star had set.  Had they done so they\r\nknew there was no mercy to be expected from Arab or Rajah; no rice to be\r\ngot on credit in the times of scarcity from either; and Almayer could not\r\nhelp them, having at times hardly enough for himself.  Almayer, in his\r\nisolation and despair, often envied his near neighbour the Chinaman, Jim-\r\nEng, whom he could see stretched on a pile of cool mats, a wooden pillow\r\nunder his head, an opium pipe in his nerveless fingers.  He did not seek,\r\nhowever, consolation in opium--perhaps it was too expensive--perhaps his\r\nwhite man\'s pride saved him from that degradation; but most likely it was\r\nthe thought of his little daughter in the far-off Straits Settlements.  He\r\nheard from her oftener since Abdulla bought a steamer, which ran now\r\nbetween Singapore and the Pantai settlement every three months or so.\r\nAlmayer felt himself nearer his daughter.  He longed to see her, and\r\nplanned a voyage to Singapore, but put off his departure from year to\r\nyear, always expecting some favourable turn of fortune.  He did not want\r\nto meet her with empty hands and with no words of hope on his lips.  He\r\ncould not take her back into that savage life to which he was condemned\r\nhimself.  He was also a little afraid of her.  What would she think of\r\nhim?  He reckoned the years.  A grown woman.  A civilised woman, young\r\nand hopeful; while he felt old and hopeless, and very much like those\r\nsavages round him.  He asked himself what was going to be her future.  He\r\ncould not answer that question yet, and he dared not face her.  And yet\r\nhe longed after her.  He hesitated for years.\r\n\r\nHis hesitation was put an end to by Nina\'s unexpected appearance in\r\nSambir.  She arrived in the steamer under the captain\'s care.  Almayer\r\nbeheld her with surprise not unmixed with wonder.  During those ten years\r\nthe child had changed into a woman, black-haired, olive-skinned, tall,\r\nand beautiful, with great sad eyes, where the startled expression common\r\nto Malay womankind was modified by a thoughtful tinge inherited from her\r\nEuropean ancestry.  Almayer thought with dismay of the meeting of his\r\nwife and daughter, of what this grave girl in European clothes would\r\nthink of her betel-nut chewing mother, squatting in a dark hut,\r\ndisorderly, half naked, and sulky.  He also feared an outbreak of temper\r\non the part of that pest of a woman he had hitherto managed to keep\r\ntolerably quiet, thereby saving the remnants of his dilapidated\r\nfurniture.  And he stood there before the closed door of the hut in the\r\nblazing sunshine listening to the murmur of voices, wondering what went\r\non inside, wherefrom all the servant-maids had been expelled at the\r\nbeginning of the interview, and now stood clustered by the palings with\r\nhalf-covered faces in a chatter of curious speculation.  He forgot\r\nhimself there trying to catch a stray word through the bamboo walls, till\r\nthe captain of the steamer, who had walked up with the girl, fearing a\r\nsunstroke, took him under the arm and led him into the shade of his own\r\nverandah: where Nina\'s trunk stood already, having been landed by the\r\nsteamer\'s men.  As soon as Captain Ford had his glass before him and his\r\ncheroot lighted, Almayer asked for the explanation of his daughter\'s\r\nunexpected arrival.  Ford said little beyond generalising in vague but\r\nviolent terms upon the foolishness of women in general, and of Mrs. Vinck\r\nin particular.\r\n\r\n"You know, Kaspar," said he, in conclusion, to the excited Almayer, "it\r\nis deucedly awkward to have a half-caste girl in the house.  There\'s such\r\na lot of fools about.  There was that young fellow from the bank who used\r\nto ride to the Vinck bungalow early and late.  That old woman thought it\r\nwas for that Emma of hers.  When she found out what he wanted exactly,\r\nthere was a row, I can tell you.  She would not have Nina--not an hour\r\nlonger--in the house.  Fact is, I heard of this affair and took the girl\r\nto my wife.  My wife is a pretty good woman--as women go--and upon my\r\nword we would have kept the girl for you, only she would not stay.  Now,\r\nthen!  Don\'t flare up, Kaspar.  Sit still.  What can you do?  It is\r\nbetter so.  Let her stay with you.  She was never happy over there.  Those\r\ntwo Vinck girls are no better than dressed-up monkeys.  They slighted\r\nher.  You can\'t make her white.  It\'s no use you swearing at me.  You\r\ncan\'t.  She is a good girl for all that, but she would not tell my wife\r\nanything.  If you want to know, ask her yourself; but if I was you I\r\nwould leave her alone.  You are welcome to her passage money, old fellow,\r\nif you are short now."  And the skipper, throwing away his cigar, walked\r\noff to "wake them up on board," as he expressed it.\r\n\r\nAlmayer vainly expected to hear of the cause of his daughter\'s return\r\nfrom his daughter\'s lips.  Not that day, not on any other day did she\r\never allude to her Singapore life.  He did not care to ask, awed by the\r\ncalm impassiveness of her face, by those solemn eyes looking past him on\r\nthe great, still forests sleeping in majestic repose to the murmur of the\r\nbroad river.  He accepted the situation, happy in the gentle and\r\nprotecting affection the girl showed him, fitfully enough, for she had,\r\nas she called it, her bad days when she used to visit her mother and\r\nremain long hours in the riverside hut, coming out as inscrutable as\r\never, but with a contemptuous look and a short word ready to answer any\r\nof his speeches.  He got used even to that, and on those days kept quiet,\r\nalthough greatly alarmed by his wife\'s influence upon the girl.  Otherwise\r\nNina adapted herself wonderfully to the circumstances of a half-savage\r\nand miserable life.  She accepted without question or apparent disgust\r\nthe neglect, the decay, the poverty of the household, the absence of\r\nfurniture, and the preponderance of rice diet on the family table.  She\r\nlived with Almayer in the little house (now sadly decaying) built\r\noriginally by Lingard for the young couple.  The Malays eagerly discussed\r\nher arrival.  There were at the beginning crowded levees of Malay women\r\nwith their children, seeking eagerly after "Ubat" for all the ills of the\r\nflesh from the young Mem Putih.  In the cool of the evening grave Arabs\r\nin long white shirts and yellow sleeveless jackets walked slowly on the\r\ndusty path by the riverside towards Almayer\'s gate, and made solemn calls\r\nupon that Unbeliever under shallow pretences of business, only to get a\r\nglimpse of the young girl in a highly decorous manner.  Even Lakamba came\r\nout of his stockade in a great pomp of war canoes and red umbrellas, and\r\nlanded on the rotten little jetty of Lingard and Co.  He came, he said,\r\nto buy a couple of brass guns as a present to his friend the chief of\r\nSambir Dyaks; and while Almayer, suspicious but polite, busied himself in\r\nunearthing the old popguns in the godowns, the Rajah sat on an armchair\r\nin the verandah, surrounded by his respectful retinue waiting in vain for\r\nNina\'s appearance.  She was in one of her bad days, and remained in her\r\nmother\'s hut watching with her the ceremonious proceedings on the\r\nverandah.  The Rajah departed, baffled but courteous, and soon Almayer\r\nbegan to reap the benefit of improved relations with the ruler in the\r\nshape of the recovery of some debts, paid to him with many apologies and\r\nmany a low salaam by debtors till then considered hopelessly insolvent.\r\nUnder these improving circumstances Almayer brightened up a little.  All\r\nwas not lost perhaps.  Those Arabs and Malays saw at last that he was a\r\nman of some ability, he thought.  And he began, after his manner, to plan\r\ngreat things, to dream of great fortunes for himself and Nina.  Especially\r\nfor Nina!  Under these vivifying impulses he asked Captain Ford to write\r\nto his friends in England making inquiries after Lingard.  Was he alive\r\nor dead?  If dead, had he left any papers, documents; any indications or\r\nhints as to his great enterprise?  Meantime he had found amongst the\r\nrubbish in one of the empty rooms a note-book belonging to the old\r\nadventurer.  He studied the crabbed handwriting of its pages and often\r\ngrew meditative over it.  Other things also woke him up from his apathy.\r\nThe stir made in the whole of the island by the establishment of the\r\nBritish Borneo Company affected even the sluggish flow of the Pantai\r\nlife.  Great changes were expected; annexation was talked of; the Arabs\r\ngrew civil.  Almayer began building his new house for the use of the\r\nfuture engineers, agents, or settlers of the new Company.  He spent every\r\navailable guilder on it with a confiding heart.  One thing only disturbed\r\nhis happiness: his wife came out of her seclusion, importing her green\r\njacket, scant sarongs, shrill voice, and witch-like appearance, into his\r\nquiet life in the small bungalow.  And his daughter seemed to accept that\r\nsavage intrusion into their daily existence with wonderful equanimity.  He\r\ndid not like it, but dared say nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deliberations conducted in London have a far-reaching importance, and\r\nso the decision issued from the fog-veiled offices of the Borneo Company\r\ndarkened for Almayer the brilliant sunshine of the Tropics, and added\r\nanother drop of bitterness to the cup of his disenchantments.  The claim\r\nto that part of the East Coast was abandoned, leaving the Pantai river\r\nunder the nominal power of Holland.  In Sambir there was joy and\r\nexcitement.  The slaves were hurried out of sight into the forest and\r\njungle, and the flags were run up to tall poles in the Rajah\'s compound\r\nin expectation of a visit from Dutch man-of-war boats.\r\n\r\nThe frigate remained anchored outside the mouth of the river, and the\r\nboats came up in tow of the steam launch, threading their way cautiously\r\namongst a crowd of canoes filled with gaily dressed Malays.  The officer\r\nin command listened gravely to the loyal speeches of Lakamba, returned\r\nthe salaams of Abdulla, and assured those gentlemen in choice Malay of\r\nthe great Rajah\'s--down in Batavia--friendship and goodwill towards the\r\nruler and inhabitants of this model state of Sambir.\r\n\r\nAlmayer from his verandah watched across the river the festive\r\nproceedings, heard the report of brass guns saluting the new flag\r\npresented to Lakamba, and the deep murmur of the crowd of spectators\r\nsurging round the stockade.  The smoke of the firing rose in white clouds\r\non the green background of the forests, and he could not help comparing\r\nhis own fleeting hopes to the rapidly disappearing vapour.  He was by no\r\nmeans patriotically elated by the event, yet he had to force himself into\r\na gracious behaviour when, the official reception being over, the naval\r\nofficers of the Commission crossed the river to pay a visit to the\r\nsolitary white man of whom they had heard, no doubt wishing also to catch\r\na glimpse of his daughter.  In that they were disappointed, Nina refusing\r\nto show herself; but they seemed easily consoled by the gin and cheroots\r\nset before them by the hospitable Almayer; and sprawling comfortably on\r\nthe lame armchairs under the shade of the verandah, while the blazing\r\nsunshine outside seemed to set the great river simmering in the heat,\r\nthey filled the little bungalow with the unusual sounds of European\r\nlanguages, with noise and laughter produced by naval witticisms at the\r\nexpense of the fat Lakamba whom they had been complimenting so much that\r\nvery morning.  The younger men in an access of good fellowship made their\r\nhost talk, and Almayer, excited by the sight of European faces, by the\r\nsound of European voices, opened his heart before the sympathising\r\nstrangers, unaware of the amusement the recital of his many misfortunes\r\ncaused to those future admirals.  They drank his health, wished him many\r\nbig diamonds and a mountain of gold, expressed even an envy of the high\r\ndestinies awaiting him yet.  Encouraged by so much friendliness, the grey-\r\nheaded and foolish dreamer invited his guests to visit his new house.\r\nThey went there through the long grass in a straggling procession while\r\ntheir boats were got ready for the return down the river in the cool of\r\nthe evening.  And in the great empty rooms where the tepid wind entering\r\nthrough the sashless windows whirled gently the dried leaves and the dust\r\nof many days of neglect, Almayer in his white jacket and flowered sarong,\r\nsurrounded by a circle of glittering uniforms, stamped his foot to show\r\nthe solidity of the neatly-fitting floors and expatiated upon the\r\nbeauties and convenience of the building.  They listened and assented,\r\namazed by the wonderful simplicity and the foolish hopefulness of the\r\nman, till Almayer, carried away by his excitement, disclosed his regret\r\nat the non-arrival of the English, "who knew how to develop a rich\r\ncountry," as he expressed it.  There was a general laugh amongst the\r\nDutch officers at that unsophisticated statement, and a move was made\r\ntowards the boats; but when Almayer, stepping cautiously on the rotten\r\nboards of the Lingard jetty, tried to approach the chief of the\r\nCommission with some timid hints anent the protection required by the\r\nDutch subject against the wily Arabs, that salt water diplomat told him\r\nsignificantly that the Arabs were better subjects than Hollanders who\r\ndealt illegally in gunpowder with the Malays.  The innocent Almayer\r\nrecognised there at once the oily tongue of Abdulla and the solemn\r\npersuasiveness of Lakamba, but ere he had time to frame an indignant\r\nprotest the steam launch and the string of boats moved rapidly down the\r\nriver leaving him on the jetty, standing open-mouthed in his surprise and\r\nanger.  There are thirty miles of river from Sambir to the gem-like\r\nislands of the estuary where the frigate was awaiting the return of the\r\nboats.  The moon rose long before the boats had traversed half that\r\ndistance, and the black forest sleeping peacefully under her cold rays\r\nwoke up that night to the ringing laughter in the small flotilla provoked\r\nby some reminiscence of Almayer\'s lamentable narrative.  Salt-water jests\r\nat the poor man\'s expense were passed from boat to boat, the\r\nnon-appearance of his daughter was commented upon with severe\r\ndispleasure, and the half-finished house built for the reception of\r\nEnglishmen received on that joyous night the name of "Almayer\'s Folly" by\r\nthe unanimous vote of the lighthearted seamen.\r\n\r\nFor many weeks after this visit life in Sambir resumed its even and\r\nuneventful flow.  Each day\'s sun shooting its morning rays above the tree-\r\ntops lit up the usual scene of daily activity.  Nina walking on the path\r\nthat formed the only street in the settlement saw the accustomed sight of\r\nmen lolling on the shady side of the houses, on the high platforms; of\r\nwomen busily engaged in husking the daily rice; of naked brown children\r\nracing along the shady and narrow paths leading to the clearings.  Jim-\r\nEng, strolling before his house, greeted her with a friendly nod before\r\nclimbing up indoors to seek his beloved opium pipe.  The elder children\r\nclustered round her, daring from long acquaintance, pulling the skirts of\r\nher white robe with their dark fingers, and showing their brilliant teeth\r\nin expectation of a shower of glass beads.  She greeted them with a quiet\r\nsmile, but always had a few friendly words for a Siamese girl, a slave\r\nowned by Bulangi, whose numerous wives were said to be of a violent\r\ntemper.  Well-founded rumour said also that the domestic squabbles of\r\nthat industrious cultivator ended generally in a combined assault of all\r\nhis wives upon the Siamese slave.  The girl herself never\r\ncomplained--perhaps from dictates of prudence, but more likely through\r\nthe strange, resigned apathy of half-savage womankind.  From early\r\nmorning she was to be seen on the paths amongst the houses--by the\r\nriverside or on the jetties, the tray of pastry, it was her mission to\r\nsell, skilfully balanced on her head.  During the great heat of the day\r\nshe usually sought refuge in Almayer\'s campong, often finding shelter in\r\na shady corner of the verandah, where she squatted with her tray before\r\nher, when invited by Nina.  For "Mem Putih" she had always a smile, but\r\nthe presence of Mrs. Almayer, the very sound of her shrill voice, was the\r\nsignal for a hurried departure.\r\n\r\nTo this girl Nina often spoke; the other inhabitants of Sambir seldom or\r\nnever heard the sound of her voice.  They got used to the silent figure\r\nmoving in their midst calm and white-robed, a being from another world\r\nand incomprehensible to them.  Yet Nina\'s life for all her outward\r\ncomposure, for all the seeming detachment from the things and people\r\nsurrounding her, was far from quiet, in consequence of Mrs. Almayer being\r\nmuch too active for the happiness and even safety of the household.  She\r\nhad resumed some intercourse with Lakamba, not personally, it is true\r\n(for the dignity of that potentate kept him inside his stockade), but\r\nthrough the agency of that potentate\'s prime minister, harbour master,\r\nfinancial adviser, and general factotum.  That gentleman--of Sulu\r\norigin--was certainly endowed with statesmanlike qualities, although he\r\nwas totally devoid of personal charms.  In truth he was perfectly\r\nrepulsive, possessing only one eye and a pockmarked face, with nose and\r\nlips horribly disfigured by the small-pox.  This unengaging individual\r\noften strolled into Almayer\'s garden in unofficial costume, composed of a\r\npiece of pink calico round his waist.  There at the back of the house,\r\nsquatting on his heels on scattered embers, in close proximity to the\r\ngreat iron boiler, where the family daily rice was being cooked by the\r\nwomen under Mrs. Almayer\'s superintendence, did that astute negotiator\r\ncarry on long conversations in Sulu language with Almayer\'s wife.  What\r\nthe subject of their discourses was might have been guessed from the\r\nsubsequent domestic scenes by Almayer\'s hearthstone.\r\n\r\nOf late Almayer had taken to excursions up the river.  In a small canoe\r\nwith two paddlers and the faithful Ali for a steersman he would disappear\r\nfor a few days at a time.  All his movements were no doubt closely\r\nwatched by Lakamba and Abdulla, for the man once in the confidence of\r\nRajah Laut was supposed to be in possession of valuable secrets.  The\r\ncoast population of Borneo believes implicitly in diamonds of fabulous\r\nvalue, in gold mines of enormous richness in the interior.  And all those\r\nimaginings are heightened by the difficulty of penetrating far inland,\r\nespecially on the north-east coast, where the Malays and the river tribes\r\nof Dyaks or Head-hunters are eternally quarrelling.  It is true enough\r\nthat some gold reaches the coast in the hands of those Dyaks when, during\r\nshort periods of truce in the desultory warfare, they visit the coast\r\nsettlements of Malays.  And so the wildest exaggerations are built up and\r\nadded to on the slight basis of that fact.\r\n\r\nAlmayer in his quality of white man--as Lingard before him--had somewhat\r\nbetter relations with the up-river tribes.  Yet even his excursions were\r\nnot without danger, and his returns were eagerly looked for by the\r\nimpatient Lakamba.  But every time the Rajah was disappointed.  Vain were\r\nthe conferences by the rice-pot of his factotum Babalatchi with the white\r\nman\'s wife.  The white man himself was impenetrable--impenetrable to\r\npersuasion, coaxing, abuse; to soft words and shrill revilings; to\r\ndesperate beseechings or murderous threats; for Mrs. Almayer, in her\r\nextreme desire to persuade her husband into an alliance with Lakamba,\r\nplayed upon the whole gamut of passion.  With her soiled robe wound\r\ntightly under the armpits across her lean bosom, her scant grayish hair\r\ntumbled in disorder over her projecting cheek-bones, in suppliant\r\nattitude, she depicted with shrill volubility the advantages of close\r\nunion with a man so good and so fair dealing.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you go to the Rajah?" she screamed.  "Why do you go back to\r\nthose Dyaks in the great forest?  They should be killed.  You cannot kill\r\nthem, you cannot; but our Rajah\'s men are brave!  You tell the Rajah\r\nwhere the old white man\'s treasure is.  Our Rajah is good!  He is our\r\nvery grandfather, Datu Besar!  He will kill those wretched Dyaks, and you\r\nshall have half the treasure.  Oh, Kaspar, tell where the treasure is!\r\nTell me!  Tell me out of the old man\'s surat where you read so often at\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nOn those occasions Almayer sat with rounded shoulders bending to the\r\nblast of this domestic tempest, accentuating only each pause in the\r\ntorrent of his wife\'s eloquence by an angry growl, "There is no treasure!\r\nGo away, woman!"  Exasperated by the sight of his patiently bent back,\r\nshe would at last walk round so as to face him across the table, and\r\nclasping her robe with one hand she stretched the other lean arm and claw-\r\nlike hand to emphasise, in a passion of anger and contempt, the rapid\r\nrush of scathing remarks and bitter cursings heaped on the head of the\r\nman unworthy to associate with brave Malay chiefs.  It ended generally by\r\nAlmayer rising slowly, his long pipe in hand, his face set into a look of\r\ninward pain, and walking away in silence.  He descended the steps and\r\nplunged into the long grass on his way to the solitude of his new house,\r\ndragging his feet in a state of physical collapse from disgust and fear\r\nbefore that fury.  She followed to the head of the steps, and sent the\r\nshafts of indiscriminate abuse after the retreating form.  And each of\r\nthose scenes was concluded by a piercing shriek, reaching him far away.\r\n"You know, Kaspar, I am your wife! your own Christian wife after your own\r\nBlanda law!"  For she knew that this was the bitterest thing of all; the\r\ngreatest regret of that man\'s life.\r\n\r\nAll these scenes Nina witnessed unmoved.  She might have been deaf, dumb,\r\nwithout any feeling as far as any expression of opinion went.  Yet oft\r\nwhen her father had sought the refuge of the great dusty rooms of\r\n"Almayer\'s Folly," and her mother, exhausted by rhetorical efforts,\r\nsquatted wearily on her heels with her back against the leg of the table,\r\nNina would approach her curiously, guarding her skirts from betel juice\r\nbesprinkling the floor, and gaze down upon her as one might look into the\r\nquiescent crater of a volcano after a destructive eruption.  Mrs.\r\nAlmayer\'s thoughts, after these scenes, were usually turned into a\r\nchannel of childhood reminiscences, and she gave them utterance in a kind\r\nof monotonous recitative--slightly disconnected, but generally describing\r\nthe glories of the Sultan of Sulu, his great splendour, his power, his\r\ngreat prowess; the fear which benumbed the hearts of white men at the\r\nsight of his swift piratical praus.  And these muttered statements of her\r\ngrandfather\'s might were mixed up with bits of later recollections, where\r\nthe great fight with the "White Devil\'s" brig and the convent life in\r\nSamarang occupied the principal place.  At that point she usually dropped\r\nthe thread of her narrative, and pulling out the little brass cross,\r\nalways suspended round her neck, she contemplated it with superstitious\r\nawe.  That superstitious feeling connected with some vague talismanic\r\nproperties of the little bit of metal, and the still more hazy but\r\nterrible notion of some bad Djinns and horrible torments invented, as she\r\nthought, for her especial punishment by the good Mother Superior in case\r\nof the loss of the above charm, were Mrs. Almayer\'s only theological\r\nluggage for the stormy road of life.  Mrs. Almayer had at least something\r\ntangible to cling to, but Nina, brought up under the Protestant wing of\r\nthe proper Mrs. Vinck, had not even a little piece of brass to remind her\r\nof past teaching.  And listening to the recital of those savage glories,\r\nthose barbarous fights and savage feasting, to the story of deeds\r\nvalorous, albeit somewhat bloodthirsty, where men of her mother\'s race\r\nshone far above the Orang Blanda, she felt herself irresistibly\r\nfascinated, and saw with vague surprise the narrow mantle of civilised\r\nmorality, in which good-meaning people had wrapped her young soul, fall\r\naway and leave her shivering and helpless as if on the edge of some deep\r\nand unknown abyss.  Strangest of all, this abyss did not frighten her\r\nwhen she was under the influence of the witch-like being she called her\r\nmother.  She seemed to have forgotten in civilised surroundings her life\r\nbefore the time when Lingard had, so to speak, kidnapped her from Brow.\r\nSince then she had had Christian teaching, social education, and a good\r\nglimpse of civilised life.  Unfortunately her teachers did not understand\r\nher nature, and the education ended in a scene of humiliation, in an\r\noutburst of contempt from white people for her mixed blood.  She had\r\ntasted the whole bitterness of it and remembered distinctly that the\r\nvirtuous Mrs. Vinck\'s indignation was not so much directed against the\r\nyoung man from the bank as against the innocent cause of that young man\'s\r\ninfatuation.  And there was also no doubt in her mind that the principal\r\ncause of Mrs. Vinck\'s indignation was the thought that such a thing\r\nshould happen in a white nest, where her snow-white doves, the two Misses\r\nVinck, had just returned from Europe, to find shelter under the maternal\r\nwing, and there await the coming of irreproachable men of their destiny.\r\nNot even the thought of the money so painfully scraped together by\r\nAlmayer, and so punctually sent for Nina\'s expenses, could dissuade Mrs.\r\nVinck from her virtuous resolve.  Nina was sent away, and in truth the\r\ngirl herself wanted to go, although a little frightened by the impending\r\nchange.  And now she had lived on the river for three years with a savage\r\nmother and a father walking about amongst pitfalls, with his head in the\r\nclouds, weak, irresolute, and unhappy.  She had lived a life devoid of\r\nall the decencies of civilisation, in miserable domestic conditions; she\r\nhad breathed in the atmosphere of sordid plottings for gain, of the no\r\nless disgusting intrigues and crimes for lust or money; and those things,\r\ntogether with the domestic quarrels, were the only events of her three\r\nyears\' existence.  She did not die from despair and disgust the first\r\nmonth, as she expected and almost hoped for.  On the contrary, at the end\r\nof half a year it had seemed to her that she had known no other life.  Her\r\nyoung mind having been unskilfully permitted to glance at better things,\r\nand then thrown back again into the hopeless quagmire of barbarism, full\r\nof strong and uncontrolled passions, had lost the power to discriminate.\r\nIt seemed to Nina that there was no change and no difference.  Whether\r\nthey traded in brick godowns or on the muddy river bank; whether they\r\nreached after much or little; whether they made love under the shadows of\r\nthe great trees or in the shadow of the cathedral on the Singapore\r\npromenade; whether they plotted for their own ends under the protection\r\nof laws and according to the rules of Christian conduct, or whether they\r\nsought the gratification of their desires with the savage cunning and the\r\nunrestrained fierceness of natures as innocent of culture as their own\r\nimmense and gloomy forests, Nina saw only the same manifestations of love\r\nand hate and of sordid greed chasing the uncertain dollar in all its\r\nmultifarious and vanishing shapes.  To her resolute nature, however,\r\nafter all these years, the savage and uncompromising sincerity of purpose\r\nshown by her Malay kinsmen seemed at last preferable to the sleek\r\nhypocrisy, to the polite disguises, to the virtuous pretences of such\r\nwhite people as she had had the misfortune to come in contact with.  After\r\nall it was her life; it was going to be her life, and so thinking she\r\nfell more and more under the influence of her mother.  Seeking, in her\r\nignorance, a better side to that life, she listened with avidity to the\r\nold woman\'s tales of the departed glories of the Rajahs, from whose race\r\nshe had sprung, and she became gradually more indifferent, more\r\ncontemptuous of the white side of her descent represented by a feeble and\r\ntraditionless father.\r\n\r\nAlmayer\'s difficulties were by no means diminished by the girl\'s presence\r\nin Sambir.  The stir caused by her arrival had died out, it is true, and\r\nLakamba had not renewed his visits; but about a year after the departure\r\nof the man-of-war boats the nephew of Abdulla, Syed Reshid, returned from\r\nhis pilgrimage to Mecca, rejoicing in a green jacket and the proud title\r\nof Hadji.  There was a great letting off of rockets on board the steamer\r\nwhich brought him in, and a great beating of drums all night in Abdulla\'s\r\ncompound, while the feast of welcome was prolonged far into the small\r\nhours of the morning.  Reshid was the favourite nephew and heir of\r\nAbdulla, and that loving uncle, meeting Almayer one day by the riverside,\r\nstopped politely to exchange civilities and to ask solemnly for an\r\ninterview.  Almayer suspected some attempt at a swindle, or at any rate\r\nsomething unpleasant, but of course consented with a great show of\r\nrejoicing.  Accordingly the next evening, after sunset, Abdulla came,\r\naccompanied by several other grey-beards and by his nephew.  That young\r\nman--of a very rakish and dissipated appearance--affected the greatest\r\nindifference as to the whole of the proceedings.  When the torch-bearers\r\nhad grouped themselves below the steps, and the visitors had seated\r\nthemselves on various lame chairs, Reshid stood apart in the shadow,\r\nexamining his aristocratically small hands with great attention.  Almayer,\r\nsurprised by the great solemnity of his visitors, perched himself on the\r\ncorner of the table with a characteristic want of dignity quickly noted\r\nby the Arabs with grave disapproval.  But Abdulla spoke now, looking\r\nstraight past Almayer at the red curtain hanging in the doorway, where a\r\nslight tremor disclosed the presence of women on the other side.  He\r\nbegan by neatly complimenting Almayer upon the long years they had dwelt\r\ntogether in cordial neighbourhood, and called upon Allah to give him many\r\nmore years to gladden the eyes of his friends by his welcome presence.  He\r\nmade a polite allusion to the great consideration shown him (Almayer) by\r\nthe Dutch "Commissie," and drew thence the flattering inference of\r\nAlmayer\'s great importance amongst his own people.  He--Abdulla--was also\r\nimportant amongst all the Arabs, and his nephew Reshid would be heir of\r\nthat social position and of great riches.  Now Reshid was a Hadji.  He\r\nwas possessor of several Malay women, went on Abdulla, but it was time he\r\nhad a favourite wife, the first of the four allowed by the Prophet.  And,\r\nspeaking with well-bred politeness, he explained further to the\r\ndumbfounded Almayer that, if he would consent to the alliance of his\r\noffspring with that true believer and virtuous man Reshid, she would be\r\nthe mistress of all the splendours of Reshid\'s house, and first wife of\r\nthe first Arab in the Islands, when he--Abdulla--was called to the joys\r\nof Paradise by Allah the All-merciful.  "You know, Tuan," he said, in\r\nconclusion, "the other women would be her slaves, and Reshid\'s house is\r\ngreat.  From Bombay he has brought great divans, and costly carpets, and\r\nEuropean furniture.  There is also a great looking-glass in a frame\r\nshining like gold.  What could a girl want more?"  And while Almayer\r\nlooked upon him in silent dismay Abdulla spoke in a more confidential\r\ntone, waving his attendants away, and finished his speech by pointing out\r\nthe material advantages of such an alliance, and offering to settle upon\r\nAlmayer three thousand dollars as a sign of his sincere friendship and\r\nthe price of the girl.\r\n\r\nPoor Almayer was nearly having a fit.  Burning with the desire of taking\r\nAbdulla by the throat, he had but to think of his helpless position in\r\nthe midst of lawless men to comprehend the necessity of diplomatic\r\nconciliation.  He mastered his impulses, and spoke politely and coldly,\r\nsaying the girl was young and as the apple of his eye.  Tuan Reshid, a\r\nFaithful and a Hadji, would not want an infidel woman in his harem; and,\r\nseeing Abdulla smile sceptically at that last objection, he remained\r\nsilent, not trusting himself to speak more, not daring to refuse point-\r\nblank, nor yet to say anything compromising.  Abdulla understood the\r\nmeaning of that silence, and rose to take leave with a grave salaam.  He\r\nwished his friend Almayer "a thousand years," and moved down the steps,\r\nhelped dutifully by Reshid.  The torch-bearers shook their torches,\r\nscattering a shower of sparks into the river, and the cortege moved off,\r\nleaving Almayer agitated but greatly relieved by their departure.  He\r\ndropped into a chair and watched the glimmer of the lights amongst the\r\ntree trunks till they disappeared and complete silence succeeded the\r\ntramp of feet and the murmur of voices.  He did not move till the curtain\r\nrustled and Nina came out on the verandah and sat in the rocking-chair,\r\nwhere she used to spend many hours every day.  She gave a slight rocking\r\nmotion to her seat, leaning back with half-closed eyes, her long hair\r\nshading her face from the smoky light of the lamp on the table.  Almayer\r\nlooked at her furtively, but the face was as impassible as ever.  She\r\nturned her head slightly towards her father, and, speaking, to his great\r\nsurprise, in English, asked--\r\n\r\n"Was that Abdulla here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Almayer--"just gone."\r\n\r\n"And what did he want, father?"\r\n\r\n"He wanted to buy you for Reshid," answered Almayer, brutally, his anger\r\ngetting the better of him, and looking at the girl as if in expectation\r\nof some outbreak of feeling.  But Nina remained apparently unmoved,\r\ngazing dreamily into the black night outside.\r\n\r\n"Be careful, Nina," said Almayer, after a short silence and rising from\r\nhis chair, "when you go paddling alone into the creeks in your canoe.\r\nThat Reshid is a violent scoundrel, and there is no saying what he may\r\ndo.  Do you hear me?"\r\n\r\nShe was standing now, ready to go in, one hand grasping the curtain in\r\nthe doorway.  She turned round, throwing her heavy tresses back by a\r\nsudden gesture.\r\n\r\n"Do you think he would dare?" she asked, quickly, and then turned again\r\nto go in, adding in a lower tone, "He would not dare.  Arabs are all\r\ncowards."\r\n\r\nAlmayer looked after her, astonished.  He did not seek the repose of his\r\nhammock.  He walked the floor absently, sometimes stopping by the\r\nbalustrade to think.  The lamp went out.  The first streak of dawn broke\r\nover the forest; Almayer shivered in the damp air.  "I give it up," he\r\nmuttered to himself, lying down wearily.  "Damn those women!  Well!  If\r\nthe girl did not look as if she wanted to be kidnapped!"\r\n\r\nAnd he felt a nameless fear creep into his heart, making him shiver\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat year, towards the breaking up of the south-west monsoon, disquieting\r\nrumours reached Sambir.  Captain Ford, coming up to Almayer\'s house for\r\nan evening\'s chat, brought late numbers of the _Straits Times_ giving the\r\nnews of Acheen war and of the unsuccessful Dutch expedition.  The\r\nNakhodas of the rare trading praus ascending the river paid visits to\r\nLakamba, discussing with that potentate the unsettled state of affairs,\r\nand wagged their heads gravely over the recital of Orang Blanda exaction,\r\nseverity, and general tyranny, as exemplified in the total stoppage of\r\ngunpowder trade and the rigorous visiting of all suspicious craft trading\r\nin the straits of Macassar.  Even the loyal soul of Lakamba was stirred\r\ninto a state of inward discontent by the withdrawal of his license for\r\npowder and by the abrupt confiscation of one hundred and fifty barrels of\r\nthat commodity by the gunboat _Princess Amelia_, when, after a hazardous\r\nvoyage, it had almost reached the mouth of the river.  The unpleasant\r\nnews was given him by Reshid, who, after the unsuccessful issue of his\r\nmatrimonial projects, had made a long voyage amongst the islands for\r\ntrading purposes; had bought the powder for his friend, and was\r\noverhauled and deprived of it on his return when actually congratulating\r\nhimself on his acuteness in avoiding detection.  Reshid\'s wrath was\r\nprincipally directed against Almayer, whom he suspected of having\r\nnotified the Dutch authorities of the desultory warfare carried on by the\r\nArabs and the Rajah with the up-river Dyak tribes.\r\n\r\nTo Reshid\'s great surprise the Rajah received his complaints very coldly,\r\nand showed no signs of vengeful disposition towards the white man.  In\r\ntruth, Lakamba knew very well that Almayer was perfectly innocent of any\r\nmeddling in state affairs; and besides, his attitude towards that much\r\npersecuted individual was wholly changed in consequence of a\r\nreconciliation effected between him and his old enemy by Almayer\'s newly-\r\nfound friend, Dain Maroola.\r\n\r\nAlmayer had now a friend.  Shortly after Reshid\'s departure on his\r\ncommercial journey, Nina, drifting slowly with the tide in the canoe on\r\nher return home after one of her solitary excursions, heard in one of the\r\nsmall creeks a splashing, as if of heavy ropes dropping in the water, and\r\nthe prolonged song of Malay seamen when some heavy pulling is to be done.\r\nThrough the thick fringe of bushes hiding the mouth of the creek she saw\r\nthe tall spars of some European-rigged sailing vessel overtopping the\r\nsummits of the Nipa palms.  A brig was being hauled out of the small\r\ncreek into the main stream.  The sun had set, and during the short\r\nmoments of twilight Nina saw the brig, aided by the evening breeze and\r\nthe flowing tide, head towards Sambir under her set foresail.  The girl\r\nturned her canoe out of the main river into one of the many narrow\r\nchannels amongst the wooded islets, and paddled vigorously over the black\r\nand sleepy backwaters towards Sambir.  Her canoe brushed the water-palms,\r\nskirted the short spaces of muddy bank where sedate alligators looked at\r\nher with lazy unconcern, and, just as darkness was setting in, shot out\r\ninto the broad junction of the two main branches of the river, where the\r\nbrig was already at anchor with sails furled, yards squared, and decks\r\nseemingly untenanted by any human being.  Nina had to cross the river and\r\npass pretty close to the brig in order to reach home on the low\r\npromontory between the two branches of the Pantai.  Up both branches, in\r\nthe houses built on the banks and over the water, the lights twinkled\r\nalready, reflected in the still waters below.  The hum of voices, the\r\noccasional cry of a child, the rapid and abruptly interrupted roll of a\r\nwooden drum, together with some distant hailing in the darkness by the\r\nreturning fishermen, reached her over the broad expanse of the river.  She\r\nhesitated a little before crossing, the sight of such an unusual object\r\nas an European-rigged vessel causing her some uneasiness, but the river\r\nin its wide expansion was dark enough to render a small canoe invisible.\r\nShe urged her small craft with swift strokes of her paddle, kneeling in\r\nthe bottom and bending forward to catch any suspicious sound while she\r\nsteered towards the little jetty of Lingard and Co., to which the strong\r\nlight of the paraffin lamp shining on the whitewashed verandah of\r\nAlmayer\'s bungalow served as a convenient guide.  The jetty itself, under\r\nthe shadow of the bank overgrown by drooping bushes, was hidden in\r\ndarkness.  Before even she could see it she heard the hollow bumping of a\r\nlarge boat against its rotten posts, and heard also the murmur of\r\nwhispered conversation in that boat whose white paint and great\r\ndimensions, faintly visible on nearer approach, made her rightly guess\r\nthat it belonged to the brig just anchored.  Stopping her course by a\r\nrapid motion of her paddle, with another swift stroke she sent it\r\nwhirling away from the wharf and steered for a little rivulet which gave\r\naccess to the back courtyard of the house.  She landed at the muddy head\r\nof the creek and made her way towards the house over the trodden grass of\r\nthe courtyard.  To the left, from the cooking shed, shone a red glare\r\nthrough the banana plantation she skirted, and the noise of feminine\r\nlaughter reached her from there in the silent evening.  She rightly\r\njudged her mother was not near, laughter and Mrs. Almayer not being close\r\nneighbours.  She must be in the house, thought Nina, as she ran lightly\r\nup the inclined plane of shaky planks leading to the back door of the\r\nnarrow passage dividing the house in two.  Outside the doorway, in the\r\nblack shadow, stood the faithful Ali.\r\n\r\n"Who is there?" asked Nina.\r\n\r\n"A great Malay man has come," answered Ali, in a tone of suppressed\r\nexcitement.  "He is a rich man.  There are six men with lances.  Real\r\nSoldat, you understand.  And his dress is very brave.  I have seen his\r\ndress.  It shines!  What jewels!  Don\'t go there, Mem Nina.  Tuan said\r\nnot; but the old Mem is gone.  Tuan will be angry.  Merciful Allah! what\r\njewels that man has got!"\r\n\r\nNina slipped past the outstretched hand of the slave into the dark\r\npassage where, in the crimson glow of the hanging curtain, close by its\r\nother end, she could see a small dark form crouching near the wall.  Her\r\nmother was feasting her eyes and ears with what was taking place on the\r\nfront verandah, and Nina approached to take her share in the rare\r\npleasure of some novelty.  She was met by her mother\'s extended arm and\r\nby a low murmured warning not to make a noise.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen them, mother?" asked Nina, in a breathless whisper.\r\n\r\nMrs. Almayer turned her face towards the girl, and her sunken eyes shone\r\nstrangely in the red half-light of the passage.\r\n\r\n"I saw him," she said, in an almost inaudible tone, pressing her\r\ndaughter\'s hand with her bony fingers.  "A great Rajah has come to\r\nSambir--a Son of Heaven," muttered the old woman to herself.  "Go away,\r\ngirl!"\r\n\r\nThe two women stood close to the curtain, Nina wishing to approach the\r\nrent in the stuff, and her mother defending the position with angry\r\nobstinacy.  On the other side there was a lull in the conversation, but\r\nthe breathing of several men, the occasional light tinkling of some\r\nornaments, the clink of metal scabbards, or of brass siri-vessels passed\r\nfrom hand to hand, was audible during the short pause.  The women\r\nstruggled silently, when there was a shuffling noise and the shadow of\r\nAlmayer\'s burly form fell on the curtain.\r\n\r\nThe women ceased struggling and remained motionless.  Almayer had stood\r\nup to answer his guest, turning his back to the doorway, unaware of what\r\nwas going on on the other side.  He spoke in a tone of regretful\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n"You have come to the wrong house, Tuan Maroola, if you want to trade as\r\nyou say.  I was a trader once, not now, whatever you may have heard about\r\nme in Macassar.  And if you want anything, you will not find it here; I\r\nhave nothing to give, and want nothing myself.  You should go to the\r\nRajah here; you can see in the daytime his houses across the river,\r\nthere, where those fires are burning on the shore.  He will help you and\r\ntrade with you.  Or, better still, go to the Arabs over there," he went\r\non bitterly, pointing with his hand towards the houses of Sambir.\r\n"Abdulla is the man you want.  There is nothing he would not buy, and\r\nthere is nothing he would not sell; believe me, I know him well."\r\n\r\nHe waited for an answer a short time, then added--\r\n\r\n"All that I have said is true, and there is nothing more."\r\n\r\nNina, held back by her mother, heard a soft voice reply with a calm\r\nevenness of intonation peculiar to the better class Malays--\r\n\r\n"Who would doubt a white Tuan\'s words?  A man seeks his friends where his\r\nheart tells him.  Is this not true also?  I have come, although so late,\r\nfor I have something to say which you may be glad to hear.  To-morrow I\r\nwill go to the Sultan; a trader wants the friendship of great men.  Then\r\nI shall return here to speak serious words, if Tuan permits.  I shall not\r\ngo to the Arabs; their lies are very great!  What are they?  Chelakka!"\r\n\r\nAlmayer\'s voice sounded a little more pleasantly in reply.\r\n\r\n"Well, as you like.  I can hear you to-morrow at any time if you have\r\nanything to say.  Bah!  After you have seen the Sultan Lakamba you will\r\nnot want to return here, Inchi Dain.  You will see.  Only mind, I will\r\nhave nothing to do with Lakamba.  You may tell him so.  What is your\r\nbusiness with me, after all?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow we talk, Tuan, now I know you," answered the Malay.  "I speak\r\nEnglish a little, so we can talk and nobody will understand, and then--"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted himself suddenly, asking surprised, "What\'s that noise,\r\nTuan?"\r\n\r\nAlmayer had also heard the increasing noise of the scuffle recommenced on\r\nthe women\'s side of the curtain.  Evidently Nina\'s strong curiosity was\r\non the point of overcoming Mrs. Almayer\'s exalted sense of social\r\nproprieties.  Hard breathing was distinctly audible, and the curtain\r\nshook during the contest, which was mainly physical, although Mrs.\r\nAlmayer\'s voice was heard in angry remonstrance with its usual want of\r\nstrictly logical reasoning, but with the well-known richness of\r\ninvective.\r\n\r\n"You shameless woman!  Are you a slave?" shouted shrilly the irate\r\nmatron.  "Veil your face, abandoned wretch!  You white snake, I will not\r\nlet you!"\r\n\r\nAlmayer\'s face expressed annoyance and also doubt as to the advisability\r\nof interfering between mother and daughter.  He glanced at his Malay\r\nvisitor, who was waiting silently for the end of the uproar in an\r\nattitude of amused expectation, and waving his hand contemptuously he\r\nmurmured--\r\n\r\n"It is nothing.  Some women."\r\n\r\nThe Malay nodded his head gravely, and his face assumed an expression of\r\nserene indifference, as etiquette demanded after such an explanation.  The\r\ncontest was ended behind the curtain, and evidently the younger will had\r\nits way, for the rapid shuffle and click of Mrs. Almayer\'s high-heeled\r\nsandals died away in the distance.  The tranquillised master of the house\r\nwas going to resume the conversation when, struck by an unexpected change\r\nin the expression of his guest\'s countenance, he turned his head and saw\r\nNina standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Almayer\'s retreat from the field of battle, Nina, with a\r\ncontemptuous exclamation, "It\'s only a trader," had lifted the conquered\r\ncurtain and now stood in full light, framed in the dark background on the\r\npassage, her lips slightly parted, her hair in disorder after the\r\nexertion, the angry gleam not yet faded out of her glorious and sparkling\r\neyes.  She took in at a glance the group of white-clad lancemen standing\r\nmotionless in the shadow of the far-off end of the verandah, and her gaze\r\nrested curiously on the chief of that imposing _cortege_.  He stood,\r\nalmost facing her, a little on one side, and struck by the beauty of the\r\nunexpected apparition had bent low, elevating his joint hands above his\r\nhead in a sign of respect accorded by Malays only to the great of this\r\nearth.  The crude light of the lamp shone on the gold embroidery of his\r\nblack silk jacket, broke in a thousand sparkling rays on the jewelled\r\nhilt of his kriss protruding from under the many folds of the red sarong\r\ngathered into a sash round his waist, and played on the precious stones\r\nof the many rings on his dark fingers.  He straightened himself up\r\nquickly after the low bow, putting his hand with a graceful ease on the\r\nhilt of his heavy short sword ornamented with brilliantly dyed fringes of\r\nhorsehair.  Nina, hesitating on the threshold, saw an erect lithe figure\r\nof medium height with a breadth of shoulder suggesting great power.  Under\r\nthe folds of a blue turban, whose fringed ends hung gracefully over the\r\nleft shoulder, was a face full of determination and expressing a reckless\r\ngood-humour, not devoid, however, of some dignity.  The squareness of\r\nlower jaw, the full red lips, the mobile nostrils, and the proud carriage\r\nof the head gave the impression of a being half-savage, untamed, perhaps\r\ncruel, and corrected the liquid softness of the almost feminine eye, that\r\ngeneral characteristic of the race.  Now, the first surprise over, Nina\r\nsaw those eyes fixed upon her with such an uncontrolled expression of\r\nadmiration and desire that she felt a hitherto unknown feeling of\r\nshyness, mixed with alarm and some delight, enter and penetrate her whole\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nConfused by those unusual sensations she stopped in the doorway and\r\ninstinctively drew the lower part of the curtain across her face, leaving\r\nonly half a rounded cheek, a stray tress, and one eye exposed, wherewith\r\nto contemplate the gorgeous and bold being so unlike in appearance to the\r\nrare specimens of traders she had seen before on that same verandah.\r\n\r\nDain Maroola, dazzled by the unexpected vision, forgot the confused\r\nAlmayer, forgot his brig, his escort staring in open-mouthed admiration,\r\nthe object of his visit and all things else, in his overpowering desire\r\nto prolong the contemplation of so much loveliness met so suddenly in\r\nsuch an unlikely place--as he thought.\r\n\r\n"It is my daughter," said Almayer, in an embarrassed manner.  "It is of\r\nno consequence.  White women have their customs, as you know Tuan, having\r\ntravelled much, as you say.  However, it is late; we will finish our talk\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\nDain bent low trying to convey in a last glance towards the girl the bold\r\nexpression of his overwhelming admiration.  The next minute he was\r\nshaking Almayer\'s hand with grave courtesy, his face wearing a look of\r\nstolid unconcern as to any feminine presence.  His men filed off, and he\r\nfollowed them quickly, closely attended by a thick-set, savage-looking\r\nSumatrese he had introduced before as the commander of his brig.  Nina\r\nwalked to the balustrade of the verandah and saw the sheen of moonlight\r\non the steel spear-heads and heard the rhythmic jingle of brass anklets\r\nas the men moved in single file towards the jetty.  The boat shoved off\r\nafter a little while, looming large in the full light of the moon, a\r\nblack shapeless mass in the slight haze hanging over the water.  Nina\r\nfancied she could distinguish the graceful figure of the trader standing\r\nerect in the stern sheets, but in a little while all the outlines got\r\nblurred, confused, and soon disappeared in the folds of white vapour\r\nshrouding the middle of the river.\r\n\r\nAlmayer had approached his daughter, and leaning with both arms over the\r\nrail, was looking moodily down on the heap of rubbish and broken bottles\r\nat the foot of the verandah.\r\n\r\n"What was all that noise just now?" he growled peevishly, without looking\r\nup.  "Confound you and your mother!  What did she want?  What did you\r\ncome out for?"\r\n\r\n"She did not want to let me come out," said Nina.  "She is angry.  She\r\nsays the man just gone is some Rajah.  I think she is right now."\r\n\r\n"I believe all you women are crazy," snarled Almayer.  "What\'s that to\r\nyou, to her, to anybody?  The man wants to collect trepang and birds\'\r\nnests on the islands.  He told me so, that Rajah of yours.  He will come\r\nto-morrow.  I want you both to keep away from the house, and let me\r\nattend to my business in peace."\r\n\r\nDain Maroola came the next day and had a long conversation with Almayer.\r\nThis was the beginning of a close and friendly intercourse which, at\r\nfirst, was much remarked in Sambir, till the population got used to the\r\nfrequent sight of many fires burning in Almayer\'s campong, where\r\nMaroola\'s men were warming themselves during the cold nights of the north-\r\neast monsoon, while their master had long conferences with the Tuan\r\nPutih--as they styled Almayer amongst themselves.  Great was the\r\ncuriosity in Sambir on the subject of the new trader.  Had he seen the\r\nSultan?  What did the Sultan say?  Had he given any presents?  What would\r\nhe sell?  What would he buy?  Those were the questions broached eagerly\r\nby the inhabitants of bamboo houses built over the river.  Even in more\r\nsubstantial buildings, in Abdulla\'s house, in the residences of principal\r\ntraders, Arab, Chinese, and Bugis, the excitement ran high, and lasted\r\nmany days.  With inborn suspicion they would not believe the simple\r\naccount of himself the young trader was always ready to give.  Yet it had\r\nall the appearance of truth.  He said he was a trader, and sold rice.  He\r\ndid not want to buy gutta-percha or beeswax, because he intended to\r\nemploy his numerous crew in collecting trepang on the coral reefs outside\r\nthe river, and also in seeking for bird\'s nests on the mainland.  Those\r\ntwo articles he professed himself ready to buy if there were any to be\r\nobtained in that way.  He said he was from Bali, and a Brahmin, which\r\nlast statement he made good by refusing all food during his often\r\nrepeated visits to Lakamba\'s and Almayer\'s houses.  To Lakamba he went\r\ngenerally at night and had long audiences.  Babalatchi, who was always a\r\nthird party at those meetings of potentate and trader, knew how to resist\r\nall attempts on the part of the curious to ascertain the subject of so\r\nmany long talks.  When questioned with languid courtesy by the grave\r\nAbdulla he sought refuge in a vacant stare of his one eye, and in the\r\naffectation of extreme simplicity.\r\n\r\n"I am only my master\'s slave," murmured Babalatchi, in a hesitating\r\nmanner.  Then as if making up his mind suddenly for a reckless confidence\r\nhe would inform Abdulla of some transaction in rice, repeating the words,\r\n"A hundred big bags the Sultan bought; a hundred, Tuan!" in a tone of\r\nmysterious solemnity.  Abdulla, firmly persuaded of the existence of some\r\nmore important dealings, received, however, the information with all the\r\nsigns of respectful astonishment.  And the two would separate, the Arab\r\ncursing inwardly the wily dog, while Babalatchi went on his way walking\r\non the dusty path, his body swaying, his chin with its few grey hairs\r\npushed forward, resembling an inquisitive goat bent on some unlawful\r\nexpedition.  Attentive eyes watched his movements.  Jim-Eng, descrying\r\nBabalatchi far away, would shake off the stupor of an habitual opium\r\nsmoker and, tottering on to the middle of the road, would await the\r\napproach of that important person, ready with hospitable invitation.  But\r\nBabalatchi\'s discretion was proof even against the combined assaults of\r\ngood fellowship and of strong gin generously administered by the open-\r\nhearted Chinaman.  Jim-Eng, owning himself beaten, was left uninformed\r\nwith the empty bottle, and gazed sadly after the departing form of the\r\nstatesman of Sambir pursuing his devious and unsteady way, which, as\r\nusual, led him to Almayer\'s compound.  Ever since a reconciliation had\r\nbeen effected by Dain Maroola between his white friend and the Rajah, the\r\none-eyed diplomatist had again become a frequent guest in the Dutchman\'s\r\nhouse.  To Almayer\'s great disgust he was to be seen there at all times,\r\nstrolling about in an abstracted kind of way on the verandah, skulking in\r\nthe passages, or else popping round unexpected corners, always willing to\r\nengage Mrs. Almayer in confidential conversation.  He was very shy of the\r\nmaster himself, as if suspicious that the pent-up feelings of the white\r\nman towards his person might find vent in a sudden kick.  But the cooking\r\nshed was his favourite place, and he became an habitual guest there,\r\nsquatting for hours amongst the busy women, with his chin resting on his\r\nknees, his lean arms clasped round his legs, and his one eye roving\r\nuneasily--the very picture of watchful ugliness.  Almayer wanted more\r\nthan once to complain to Lakamba of his Prime Minister\'s intrusion, but\r\nDain dissuaded him.  "We cannot say a word here that he does not hear,"\r\ngrowled Almayer.\r\n\r\n"Then come and talk on board the brig," retorted Dain, with a quiet\r\nsmile.  "It is good to let the man come here.  Lakamba thinks he knows\r\nmuch.  Perhaps the Sultan thinks I want to run away.  Better let the one-\r\neyed crocodile sun himself in your campong, Tuan."\r\n\r\nAnd Almayer assented unwillingly muttering vague threats of personal\r\nviolence, while he eyed malevolently the aged statesman sitting with\r\nquiet obstinacy by his domestic rice-pot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the excitement had died out in Sambir.  The inhabitants got used\r\nto the sight of comings and goings between Almayer\'s house and the\r\nvessel, now moored to the opposite bank, and speculation as to the\r\nfeverish activity displayed by Almayer\'s boatmen in repairing old canoes\r\nceased to interfere with the due discharge of domestic duties by the\r\nwomen of the Settlement.  Even the baffled Jim-Eng left off troubling his\r\nmuddled brain with secrets of trade, and relapsed by the aid of his opium\r\npipe into a state of stupefied bliss, letting Babalatchi pursue his way\r\npast his house uninvited and seemingly unnoticed.\r\n\r\nSo on that warm afternoon, when the deserted river sparkled under the\r\nvertical sun, the statesman of Sambir could, without any hindrance from\r\nfriendly inquirers, shove off his little canoe from under the bushes,\r\nwhere it was usually hidden during his visits to Almayer\'s compound.\r\nSlowly and languidly Babalatchi paddled, crouching low in the boat,\r\nmaking himself small under his as enormous sun hat to escape the\r\nscorching heat reflected from the water.  He was not in a hurry; his\r\nmaster, Lakamba, was surely reposing at this time of the day.  He would\r\nhave ample time to cross over and greet him on his waking with important\r\nnews.  Will he be displeased?  Will he strike his ebony wood staff\r\nangrily on the floor, frightening him by the incoherent violence of his\r\nexclamations; or will he squat down with a good-humoured smile, and,\r\nrubbing his hands gently over his stomach with a familiar gesture,\r\nexpectorate copiously into the brass siri-vessel, giving vent to a low,\r\napprobative murmur?  Such were Babalatchi\'s thoughts as he skilfully\r\nhandled his paddle, crossing the river on his way to the Rajah\'s campong,\r\nwhose stockades showed from behind the dense foliage of the bank just\r\nopposite to Almayer\'s bungalow.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he had a report to make.  Something certain at last to confirm\r\nthe daily tale of suspicions, the daily hints of familiarity, of stolen\r\nglances he had seen, of short and burning words he had overheard\r\nexchanged between Dain Maroola and Almayer\'s daughter.\r\n\r\nLakamba had, till then, listened to it all, calmly and with evident\r\ndistrust; now he was going to be convinced, for Babalatchi had the proof;\r\nhad it this very morning, when fishing at break of day in the creek over\r\nwhich stood Bulangi\'s house.  There from his skiff he saw Nina\'s long\r\ncanoe drift past, the girl sitting in the stern bending over Dain, who\r\nwas stretched in the bottom with his head resting on the girl\'s knees.  He\r\nsaw it.  He followed them, but in a short time they took to the paddles\r\nand got away from under his observant eye.  A few minutes afterwards he\r\nsaw Bulangi\'s slave-girl paddling in a small dug-out to the town with her\r\ncakes for sale.  She also had seen them in the grey dawn.  And Babalatchi\r\ngrinned confidentially to himself at the recollection of the slave-girl\'s\r\ndiscomposed face, of the hard look in her eyes, of the tremble in her\r\nvoice, when answering his questions.  That little Taminah evidently\r\nadmired Dain Maroola.  That was good!  And Babalatchi laughed aloud at\r\nthe notion; then becoming suddenly serious, he began by some strange\r\nassociation of ideas to speculate upon the price for which Bulangi would,\r\npossibly, sell the girl.  He shook his head sadly at the thought that\r\nBulangi was a hard man, and had refused one hundred dollars for that same\r\nTaminah only a few weeks ago; then he became suddenly aware that the\r\ncanoe had drifted too far down during his meditation.  He shook off the\r\ndespondency caused by the certitude of Bulangi\'s mercenary disposition,\r\nand, taking up his paddle, in a few strokes sheered alongside the water-\r\ngate of the Rajah\'s house.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Almayer, as was his wont lately, moved about on the water-\r\nside, overlooking the repairs to his boats.  He had decided at last.\r\nGuided by the scraps of information contained in old Lingard\'s pocket-\r\nbook, he was going to seek for the rich gold-mine, for that place where\r\nhe had only to stoop to gather up an immense fortune and realise the\r\ndream of his young days.  To obtain the necessary help he had shared his\r\nknowledge with Dain Maroola, he had consented to be reconciled with\r\nLakamba, who gave his support to the enterprise on condition of sharing\r\nthe profits; he had sacrificed his pride, his honour, and his loyalty in\r\nthe face of the enormous risk of his undertaking, dazzled by the\r\ngreatness of the results to be achieved by this alliance so distasteful\r\nyet so necessary.  The dangers were great, but Maroola was brave; his men\r\nseemed as reckless as their chief, and with Lakamba\'s aid success seemed\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nFor the last fortnight Almayer was absorbed in the preparations, walking\r\namongst his workmen and slaves in a kind of waking trance, where\r\npractical details as to the fitting out of the boats were mixed up with\r\nvivid dreams of untold wealth, where the present misery of burning sun,\r\nof the muddy and malodorous river bank disappeared in a gorgeous vision\r\nof a splendid future existence for himself and Nina.  He hardly saw Nina\r\nduring these last days, although the beloved daughter was ever present in\r\nhis thoughts.  He hardly took notice of Dain, whose constant presence in\r\nhis house had become a matter of course to him now they were connected by\r\na community of interests.  When meeting the young chief he gave him an\r\nabsent greeting and passed on, seemingly wishing to avoid him, bent upon\r\nforgetting the hated reality of the present by absorbing himself in his\r\nwork, or else by letting his imagination soar far above the tree-tops\r\ninto the great white clouds away to the westward, where the paradise of\r\nEurope was awaiting the future Eastern millionaire.  And Maroola, now the\r\nbargain was struck and there was no more business to be talked over,\r\nevidently did not care for the white man\'s company.  Yet Dain was always\r\nabout the house, but he seldom stayed long by the riverside.  On his\r\ndaily visits to the white man the Malay chief preferred to make his way\r\nquietly through the central passage of the house, and would come out into\r\nthe garden at the back, where the fire was burning in the cooking shed,\r\nwith the rice kettle swinging over it, under the watchful supervision of\r\nMrs. Almayer.  Avoiding that shed, with its black smoke and the warbling\r\nof soft, feminine voices, Dain would turn to the left.  There, on the\r\nedge of a banana plantation, a clump of palms and mango trees formed a\r\nshady spot, a few scattered bushes giving it a certain seclusion into\r\nwhich only the serving women\'s chatter or an occasional burst of laughter\r\ncould penetrate.  Once in, he was invisible; and hidden there, leaning\r\nagainst the smooth trunk of a tall palm, he waited with gleaming eyes and\r\nan assured smile to hear the faint rustle of dried grass under the light\r\nfootsteps of Nina.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first moment when his eyes beheld this--to him--perfection\r\nof loveliness he felt in his inmost heart the conviction that she would\r\nbe his; he felt the subtle breath of mutual understanding passing between\r\ntheir two savage natures, and he did not want Mrs. Almayer\'s encouraging\r\nsmiles to take every opportunity of approaching the girl; and every time\r\nhe spoke to her, every time he looked into her eyes, Nina, although\r\naverting her face, felt as if this bold-looking being who spoke burning\r\nwords into her willing ear was the embodiment of her fate, the creature\r\nof her dreams--reckless, ferocious, ready with flashing kriss for his\r\nenemies, and with passionate embrace for his beloved--the ideal Malay\r\nchief of her mother\'s tradition.\r\n\r\nShe recognised with a thrill of delicious fear the mysterious\r\nconsciousness of her identity with that being.  Listening to his words,\r\nit seemed to her she was born only then to a knowledge of a new\r\nexistence, that her life was complete only when near him, and she\r\nabandoned herself to a feeling of dreamy happiness, while with\r\nhalf-veiled face and in silence--as became a Malay girl--she listened to\r\nDain\'s words giving up to her the whole treasure of love and passion his\r\nnature was capable of with all the unrestrained enthusiasm of a man\r\ntotally untrammelled by any influence of civilised self-discipline.\r\n\r\nAnd they used to pass many a delicious and fast fleeting hour under the\r\nmango trees behind the friendly curtain of bushes till Mrs. Almayer\'s\r\nshrill voice gave the signal of unwilling separation.  Mrs. Almayer had\r\nundertaken the easy task of watching her husband lest he should interrupt\r\nthe smooth course of her daughter\'s love affair, in which she took a\r\ngreat and benignant interest.  She was happy and proud to see Dain\'s\r\ninfatuation, believing him to be a great and powerful chief, and she\r\nfound also a gratification of her mercenary instincts in Dain\'s\r\nopen-handed generosity.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the day when Babalatchi\'s suspicions were confirmed by\r\nocular demonstration, Dain and Nina had remained longer than usual in\r\ntheir shady retreat.  Only Almayer\'s heavy step on the verandah and his\r\nquerulous clamour for food decided Mrs. Almayer to lift a warning cry.\r\nMaroola leaped lightly over the low bamboo fence, and made his way\r\nstealthily through the banana plantation down to the muddy shore of the\r\nback creek, while Nina walked slowly towards the house to minister to her\r\nfather\'s wants, as was her wont every evening.  Almayer felt happy enough\r\nthat evening; the preparations were nearly completed; to-morrow he would\r\nlaunch his boats.  In his mind\'s eye he saw the rich prize in his grasp;\r\nand, with tin spoon in his hand, he was forgetting the plateful of rice\r\nbefore him in the fanciful arrangement of some splendid banquet to take\r\nplace on his arrival in Amsterdam.  Nina, reclining in the long chair,\r\nlistened absently to the few disconnected words escaping from her\r\nfather\'s lips.  Expedition!  Gold!  What did she care for all that?  But\r\nat the name of Maroola mentioned by her father she was all attention.\r\nDain was going down the river with his brig to-morrow to remain away for\r\na few days, said Almayer.  It was very annoying, this delay.  As soon as\r\nDain returned they would have to start without loss of time, for the\r\nriver was rising.  He would not be surprised if a great flood was coming.\r\nAnd he pushed away his plate with an impatient gesture on rising from the\r\ntable.  But now Nina heard him not.  Dain going away!  That\'s why he had\r\nordered her, with that quiet masterfulness it was her delight to obey, to\r\nmeet him at break of day in Bulangi\'s creek.  Was there a paddle in her\r\ncanoe? she thought.  Was it ready?  She would have to start early--at\r\nfour in the morning, in a very few hours.\r\n\r\nShe rose from her chair, thinking she would require rest before the long\r\npull in the early morning.  The lamp was burning dimly, and her father,\r\ntired with the day\'s labour, was already in his hammock.  Nina put the\r\nlamp out and passed into a large room she shared with her mother on the\r\nleft of the central passage.  Entering, she saw that Mrs. Almayer had\r\ndeserted the pile of mats serving her as bed in one corner of the room,\r\nand was now bending over the opened lid of her large wooden chest.  Half\r\na shell of cocoanut filled with oil, where a cotton rag floated for a\r\nwick, stood on the floor, surrounding her with a ruddy halo of light\r\nshining through the black and odorous smoke.  Mrs. Almayer\'s back was\r\nbent, and her head and shoulders hidden in the deep box.  Her hands\r\nrummaged in the interior, where a soft clink as of silver money could be\r\nheard.  She did not notice at first her daughter\'s approach, and Nina,\r\nstanding silently by her, looked down on many little canvas bags ranged\r\nin the bottom of the chest, wherefrom her mother extracted handfuls of\r\nshining guilders and Mexican dollars, letting them stream slowly back\r\nagain through her claw-like fingers.  The music of tinkling silver seemed\r\nto delight her, and her eyes sparkled with the reflected gleam of freshly-\r\nminted coins.  She was muttering to herself: "And this, and this, and yet\r\nthis!  Soon he will give more--as much more as I ask.  He is a great\r\nRajah--a Son of Heaven!  And she will be a Ranee--he gave all this for\r\nher!  Who ever gave anything for me?  I am a slave!  Am I?  I am the\r\nmother of a great Ranee!"  She became aware suddenly of her daughter\'s\r\npresence, and ceased her droning, shutting the lid down violently; then,\r\nwithout rising from her crouching position, she looked up at the girl\r\nstanding by with a vague smile on her dreamy face.\r\n\r\n"You have seen.  Have you?" she shouted, shrilly.  "That is all mine, and\r\nfor you.  It is not enough!  He will have to give more before he takes\r\nyou away to the southern island where his father is king.  You hear me?\r\nYou are worth more, granddaughter of Rajahs!  More!  More!"\r\n\r\nThe sleepy voice of Almayer was heard on the verandah recommending\r\nsilence.  Mrs. Almayer extinguished the light and crept into her corner\r\nof the room.  Nina laid down on her back on a pile of soft mats, her\r\nhands entwined under her head, gazing through the shutterless hole,\r\nserving as a window at the stars twinkling on the black sky; she was\r\nawaiting the time of start for her appointed meeting-place.  With quiet\r\nhappiness she thought of that meeting in the great forest, far from all\r\nhuman eyes and sounds.  Her soul, lapsing again into the savage mood,\r\nwhich the genius of civilisation working by the hand of Mrs. Vinck could\r\nnever destroy, experienced a feeling of pride and of some slight trouble\r\nat the high value her worldly-wise mother had put upon her person; but\r\nshe remembered the expressive glances and words of Dain, and,\r\ntranquillised, she closed her eyes in a shiver of pleasant anticipation.\r\n\r\nThere are some situations where the barbarian and the, so-called,\r\ncivilised man meet upon the same ground.  It may be supposed that Dain\r\nMaroola was not exceptionally delighted with his prospective mother-in-\r\nlaw, nor that he actually approved of that worthy woman\'s appetite for\r\nshining dollars.  Yet on that foggy morning when Babalatchi, laying aside\r\nthe cares of state, went to visit his fish-baskets in the Bulangi creek,\r\nMaroola had no misgivings, experienced no feelings but those of\r\nimpatience and longing, when paddling to the east side of the island\r\nforming the back-water in question.  He hid his canoe in the bushes and\r\nstrode rapidly across the islet, pushing with impatience through the\r\ntwigs of heavy undergrowth intercrossed over his path.  From motives of\r\nprudence he would not take his canoe to the meeting-place, as Nina had\r\ndone.  He had left it in the main stream till his return from the other\r\nside of the island.  The heavy warm fog was closing rapidly round him,\r\nbut he managed to catch a fleeting glimpse of a light away to the left,\r\nproceeding from Bulangi\'s house.  Then he could see nothing in the\r\nthickening vapour, and kept to the path only by a sort of instinct, which\r\nalso led him to the very point on the opposite shore he wished to reach.\r\nA great log had stranded there, at right angles to the bank, forming a\r\nkind of jetty against which the swiftly flowing stream broke with a loud\r\nripple.  He stepped on it with a quick but steady motion, and in two\r\nstrides found himself at the outer end, with the rush and swirl of the\r\nfoaming water at his feet.\r\n\r\nStanding there alone, as if separated from the world; the heavens, earth;\r\nthe very water roaring under him swallowed up in the thick veil of the\r\nmorning fog, he breathed out the name of Nina before him into the\r\napparently limitless space, sure of being heard, instinctively sure of\r\nthe nearness of the delightful creature; certain of her being aware of\r\nhis near presence as he was aware of hers.\r\n\r\nThe bow of Nina\'s canoe loomed up close to the log, canted high out of\r\nthe water by the weight of the sitter in the stern.  Maroola laid his\r\nhand on the stem and leaped lightly in, giving it a vigorous shove off.\r\nThe light craft, obeying the new impulse, cleared the log by a hair\'s\r\nbreadth, and the river, with obedient complicity, swung it broadside to\r\nthe current, and bore it off silently and rapidly between the invisible\r\nbanks.  And once more Dain, at the feet of Nina, forgot the world, felt\r\nhimself carried away helpless by a great wave of supreme emotion, by a\r\nrush of joy, pride, and desire; understood once more with overpowering\r\ncertitude that there was no life possible without that being he held\r\nclasped in his arms with passionate strength in a prolonged embrace.\r\n\r\nNina disengaged herself gently with a low laugh.\r\n\r\n"You will overturn the boat, Dain," she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe looked into her eyes eagerly for a minute and let her go with a sigh,\r\nthen lying down in the canoe he put his head on her knees, gazing upwards\r\nand stretching his arms backwards till his hands met round the girl\'s\r\nwaist.  She bent over him, and, shaking her head, framed both their faces\r\nin the falling locks of her long black hair.\r\n\r\nAnd so they drifted on, he speaking with all the rude eloquence of a\r\nsavage nature giving itself up without restraint to an overmastering\r\npassion, she bending low to catch the murmur of words sweeter to her than\r\nlife itself.  To those two nothing existed then outside the gunwales of\r\nthe narrow and fragile craft.  It was their world, filled with their\r\nintense and all-absorbing love.  They took no heed of thickening mist, or\r\nof the breeze dying away before sunrise; they forgot the existence of the\r\ngreat forests surrounding them, of all the tropical nature awaiting the\r\nadvent of the sun in a solemn and impressive silence.\r\n\r\nOver the low river-mist hiding the boat with its freight of young\r\npassionate life and all-forgetful happiness, the stars paled, and a\r\nsilvery-grey tint crept over the sky from the eastward.  There was not a\r\nbreath of wind, not a rustle of stirring leaf, not a splash of leaping\r\nfish to disturb the serene repose of all living things on the banks of\r\nthe great river.  Earth, river, and sky were wrapped up in a deep sleep,\r\nfrom which it seemed there would be no waking.  All the seething life and\r\nmovement of tropical nature seemed concentrated in the ardent eyes, in\r\nthe tumultuously beating hearts of the two beings drifting in the canoe,\r\nunder the white canopy of mist, over the smooth surface of the river.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great sheaf of yellow rays shot upwards from behind the black\r\ncurtain of trees lining the banks of the Pantai.  The stars went out; the\r\nlittle black clouds at the zenith glowed for a moment with crimson tints,\r\nand the thick mist, stirred by the gentle breeze, the sigh of waking\r\nnature, whirled round and broke into fantastically torn pieces,\r\ndisclosing the wrinkled surface of the river sparkling in the broad light\r\nof day.  Great flocks of white birds wheeled screaming above the swaying\r\ntree-tops.  The sun had risen on the east coast.\r\n\r\nDain was the first to return to the cares of everyday life.  He rose and\r\nglanced rapidly up and down the river.  His eye detected Babalatchi\'s\r\nboat astern, and another small black speck on the glittering water, which\r\nwas Taminah\'s canoe.  He moved cautiously forward, and, kneeling, took up\r\na paddle; Nina at the stern took hers.  They bent their bodies to the\r\nwork, throwing up the water at every stroke, and the small craft went\r\nswiftly ahead, leaving a narrow wake fringed with a lace-like border of\r\nwhite and gleaming foam.  Without turning his head, Dain spoke.\r\n\r\n"Somebody behind us, Nina.  We must not let him gain.  I think he is too\r\nfar to recognise us."\r\n\r\n"Somebody before us also," panted out Nina, without ceasing to paddle.\r\n\r\n"I think I know," rejoined Dain.  "The sun shines over there, but I fancy\r\nit is the girl Taminah.  She comes down every morning to my brig to sell\r\ncakes--stays often all day.  It does not matter; steer more into the\r\nbank; we must get under the bushes.  My canoe is hidden not far from\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke his eyes watched the broad-leaved nipas which they were\r\nbrushing in their swift and silent course.\r\n\r\n"Look out, Nina," he said at last; "there, where the water palms end and\r\nthe twigs hang down under the leaning tree.  Steer for the big green\r\nbranch."\r\n\r\nHe stood up attentive, and the boat drifted slowly in shore, Nina guiding\r\nit by a gentle and skilful movement of her paddle.  When near enough Dain\r\nlaid hold of the big branch, and leaning back shot the canoe under a low\r\ngreen archway of thickly matted creepers giving access to a miniature bay\r\nformed by the caving in of the bank during the last great flood.  His own\r\nboat was there anchored by a stone, and he stepped into it, keeping his\r\nhand on the gunwale of Nina\'s canoe.  In a moment the two little\r\nnutshells with their occupants floated quietly side by side, reflected by\r\nthe black water in the dim light struggling through a high canopy of\r\ndense foliage; while above, away up in the broad day, flamed immense red\r\nblossoms sending down on their heads a shower of great dew-sparkling\r\npetals that descended rotating slowly in a continuous and perfumed\r\nstream; and over them, under them, in the sleeping water; all around them\r\nin a ring of luxuriant vegetation bathed in the warm air charged with\r\nstrong and harsh perfumes, the intense work of tropical nature went on:\r\nplants shooting upward, entwined, interlaced in inextricable confusion,\r\nclimbing madly and brutally over each other in the terrible silence of a\r\ndesperate struggle towards the life-giving sunshine above--as if struck\r\nwith sudden horror at the seething mass of corruption below, at the death\r\nand decay from which they sprang.\r\n\r\n"We must part now," said Dain, after a long silence.  "You must return at\r\nonce, Nina.  I will wait till the brig drifts down here, and shall get on\r\nboard then."\r\n\r\n"And will you be long away, Dain?" asked Nina, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Long!" exclaimed Dain.  "Would a man willingly remain long in a dark\r\nplace?  When I am not near you, Nina, I am like a man that is blind.  What\r\nis life to me without light?"\r\n\r\nNina leaned over, and with a proud and happy smile took Dain\'s face\r\nbetween her hands, looking into his eyes with a fond yet questioning\r\ngaze.  Apparently she found there the confirmation of the words just\r\nsaid, for a feeling of grateful security lightened for her the weight of\r\nsorrow at the hour of parting.  She believed that he, the descendant of\r\nmany great Rajahs, the son of a great chief, the master of life and\r\ndeath, knew the sunshine of life only in her presence.  An immense wave\r\nof gratitude and love welled forth out of her heart towards him.  How\r\ncould she make an outward and visible sign of all she felt for the man\r\nwho had filled her heart with so much joy and so much pride?  And in the\r\ngreat tumult of passion, like a flash of lightning came to her the\r\nreminiscence of that despised and almost forgotten civilisation she had\r\nonly glanced at in her days of restraint, of sorrow, and of anger.  In\r\nthe cold ashes of that hateful and miserable past she would find the sign\r\nof love, the fitting expression of the boundless felicity of the present,\r\nthe pledge of a bright and splendid future.  She threw her arms around\r\nDain\'s neck and pressed her lips to his in a long and burning kiss.  He\r\nclosed his eyes, surprised and frightened at the storm raised in his\r\nbreast by the strange and to him hitherto unknown contact, and long after\r\nNina had pushed her canoe into the river he remained motionless, without\r\ndaring to open his eyes, afraid to lose the sensation of intoxicating\r\ndelight he had tasted for the first time.\r\n\r\nNow he wanted but immortality, he thought, to be the equal of gods, and\r\nthe creature that could open so the gates of paradise must be his--soon\r\nwould be his for ever!\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes in time to see through the archway of creepers the\r\nbows of his brig come slowly into view, as the vessel drifted past on its\r\nway down the river.  He must go on board now, he thought; yet he was loth\r\nto leave the place where he had learned to know what happiness meant.\r\n"Time yet.  Let them go," he muttered to himself; and he closed his eyes\r\nagain under the red shower of scented petals, trying to recall the scene\r\nwith all its delight and all its fear.\r\n\r\nHe must have been able to join his brig in time, after all, and found\r\nmuch occupation outside, for it was in vain that Almayer looked for his\r\nfriend\'s speedy return.  The lower reach of the river where he so often\r\nand so impatiently directed his eyes remained deserted, save for the\r\nrapid flitting of some fishing canoe; but down the upper reaches came\r\nblack clouds and heavy showers heralding the final setting in of the\r\nrainy season with its thunderstorms and great floods making the river\r\nalmost impossible of ascent for native canoes.\r\n\r\nAlmayer, strolling along the muddy beach between his houses, watched\r\nuneasily the river rising inch by inch, creeping slowly nearer to the\r\nboats, now ready and hauled up in a row under the cover of dripping\r\nKajang-mats.  Fortune seemed to elude his grasp, and in his weary tramp\r\nbackwards and forwards under the steady rain falling from the lowering\r\nsky, a sort of despairing indifference took possession of him.  What did\r\nit matter?  It was just his luck!  Those two infernal savages, Lakamba\r\nand Dain, induced him, with their promises of help, to spend his last\r\ndollar in the fitting out of boats, and now one of them was gone\r\nsomewhere, and the other shut up in his stockade would give no sign of\r\nlife.  No, not even the scoundrelly Babalatchi, thought Almayer, would\r\nshow his face near him, now they had sold him all the rice, brass gongs,\r\nand cloth necessary for his expedition.  They had his very last coin, and\r\ndid not care whether he went or stayed.  And with a gesture of abandoned\r\ndiscouragement Almayer would climb up slowly to the verandah of his new\r\nhouse to get out of the rain, and leaning on the front rail with his head\r\nsunk between his shoulders he would abandon himself to the current of\r\nbitter thoughts, oblivious of the flight of time and the pangs of hunger,\r\ndeaf to the shrill cries of his wife calling him to the evening meal.\r\nWhen, roused from his sad meditations by the first roll of the evening\r\nthunderstorm, he stumbled slowly towards the glimmering light of his old\r\nhouse, his half-dead hope made his ears preternaturally acute to any\r\nsound on the river.  Several nights in succession he had heard the splash\r\nof paddles and had seen the indistinct form of a boat, but when hailing\r\nthe shadowy apparition, his heart bounding with sudden hope of hearing\r\nDain\'s voice, he was disappointed each time by the sulky answer conveying\r\nto him the intelligence that the Arabs were on the river, bound on a\r\nvisit to the home-staying Lakamba.  This caused him many sleepless\r\nnights, spent in speculating upon the kind of villainy those estimable\r\npersonages were hatching now.  At last, when all hope seemed dead, he was\r\noverjoyed on hearing Dain\'s voice; but Dain also appeared very anxious to\r\nsee Lakamba, and Almayer felt uneasy owing to a deep and ineradicable\r\ndistrust as to that ruler\'s disposition towards himself.  Still, Dain had\r\nreturned at last.  Evidently he meant to keep to his bargain.  Hope\r\nrevived, and that night Almayer slept soundly, while Nina watched the\r\nangry river under the lash of the thunderstorm sweeping onward towards\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDain was not long in crossing the river after leaving Almayer.  He landed\r\nat the water-gate of the stockade enclosing the group of houses which\r\ncomposed the residence of the Rajah of Sambir.  Evidently somebody was\r\nexpected there, for the gate was open, and men with torches were ready to\r\nprecede the visitor up the inclined plane of planks leading to the\r\nlargest house where Lakamba actually resided, and where all the business\r\nof state was invariably transacted.  The other buildings within the\r\nenclosure served only to accommodate the numerous household and the wives\r\nof the ruler.\r\n\r\nLakamba\'s own house was a strong structure of solid planks, raised on\r\nhigh piles, with a verandah of split bamboos surrounding it on all sides;\r\nthe whole was covered in by an immensely high-pitched roof of\r\npalm-leaves, resting on beams blackened by the smoke of many torches.\r\n\r\nThe building stood parallel to the river, one of its long sides facing\r\nthe water-gate of the stockade.  There was a door in the short side\r\nlooking up the river, and the inclined plank-way led straight from the\r\ngate to that door.  By the uncertain light of smoky torches, Dain noticed\r\nthe vague outlines of a group of armed men in the dark shadows to his\r\nright.  From that group Babalatchi stepped forward to open the door, and\r\nDain entered the audience chamber of the Rajah\'s residence.  About one-\r\nthird of the house was curtained off, by heavy stuff of European\r\nmanufacture, for that purpose; close to the curtain there was a big arm-\r\nchair of some black wood, much carved, and before it a rough deal table.\r\nOtherwise the room was only furnished with mats in great profusion.  To\r\nthe left of the entrance stood a rude arm-rack, with three rifles with\r\nfixed bayonets in it.  By the wall, in the shadow, the body-guard of\r\nLakamba--all friends or relations--slept in a confused heap of brown\r\narms, legs, and multi-coloured garments, from whence issued an occasional\r\nsnore or a subdued groan of some uneasy sleeper.  An European lamp with a\r\ngreen shade standing on the table made all this indistinctly visible to\r\nDain.\r\n\r\n"You are welcome to your rest here," said Babalatchi, looking at Dain\r\ninterrogatively.\r\n\r\n"I must speak to the Rajah at once," answered Dain.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi made a gesture of assent, and, turning to the brass gong\r\nsuspended under the arm-rack, struck two sharp blows.\r\n\r\nThe ear-splitting din woke up the guard.  The snores ceased; outstretched\r\nlegs were drawn in; the whole heap moved, and slowly resolved itself into\r\nindividual forms, with much yawning and rubbing of sleepy eyes; behind\r\nthe curtains there was a burst of feminine chatter; then the bass voice\r\nof Lakamba was heard.\r\n\r\n"Is that the Arab trader?"\r\n\r\n"No, Tuan," answered Babalatchi; "Dain has returned at last.  He is here\r\nfor an important talk, bitcharra--if you mercifully consent."\r\n\r\nEvidently Lakamba\'s mercy went so far--for in a short while he came out\r\nfrom behind the curtain--but it did not go to the length of inducing him\r\nto make an extensive toilet.  A short red sarong tightened hastily round\r\nhis hips was his only garment.  The merciful ruler of Sambir looked\r\nsleepy and rather sulky.  He sat in the arm-chair, his knees well apart,\r\nhis elbows on the arm-rests, his chin on his breast, breathing heavily\r\nand waiting malevolently for Dain to open the important talk.\r\n\r\nBut Dain did not seem anxious to begin.  He directed his gaze towards\r\nBabalatchi, squatting comfortably at the feet of his master, and remained\r\nsilent with a slightly bent head as if in attentive expectation of coming\r\nwords of wisdom.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi coughed discreetly, and, leaning forward, pushed over a few\r\nmats for Dain to sit upon, then lifting up his squeaky voice he assured\r\nhim with eager volubility of everybody\'s delight at this long-looked-for\r\nreturn.  His heart had hungered for the sight of Dain\'s face, and his\r\nears were withering for the want of the refreshing sound of his voice.\r\nEverybody\'s hearts and ears were in the same sad predicament, according\r\nto Babalatchi, as he indicated with a sweeping gesture the other bank of\r\nthe river where the settlement slumbered peacefully, unconscious of the\r\ngreat joy awaiting it on the morrow when Dain\'s presence amongst them\r\nwould be disclosed.  "For"--went on Babalatchi--"what is the joy of a\r\npoor man if not the open hand of a generous trader or of a great--"\r\n\r\nHere he checked himself abruptly with a calculated embarrassment of\r\nmanner, and his roving eye sought the floor, while an apologetic smile\r\ndwelt for a moment on his misshapen lips.  Once or twice during this\r\nopening speech an amused expression flitted across Dain\'s face, soon to\r\ngive way, however, to an appearance of grave concern.  On Lakamba\'s brow\r\na heavy frown had settled, and his lips moved angrily as he listened to\r\nhis Prime Minister\'s oratory.  In the silence that fell upon the room\r\nwhen Babalatchi ceased speaking arose a chorus of varied snores from the\r\ncorner where the body-guard had resumed their interrupted slumbers, but\r\nthe distant rumble of thunder filling then Nina\'s heart with apprehension\r\nfor the safety of her lover passed unheeded by those three men intent\r\neach on their own purposes, for life or death.\r\n\r\nAfter a short silence, Babalatchi, discarding now the flowers of polite\r\neloquence, spoke again, but in short and hurried sentences and in a low\r\nvoice.  They had been very uneasy.  Why did Dain remain so long absent?\r\nThe men dwelling on the lower reaches of the river heard the reports of\r\nbig guns and saw a fire-ship of the Dutch amongst the islands of the\r\nestuary.  So they were anxious.  Rumours of a disaster had reached\r\nAbdulla a few days ago, and since then they had been waiting for Dain\'s\r\nreturn under the apprehension of some misfortune.  For days they had\r\nclosed their eyes in fear, and woke up alarmed, and walked abroad\r\ntrembling, like men before an enemy.  And all on account of Dain.  Would\r\nhe not allay their fears for his safety, not for themselves?  They were\r\nquiet and faithful, and devoted to the great Rajah in Batavia--may his\r\nfate lead him ever to victory for the joy and profit of his servants!\r\n"And here," went on Babalatchi, "Lakamba my master was getting thin in\r\nhis anxiety for the trader he had taken under his protection; and so was\r\nAbdulla, for what would wicked men not say if perchance--"\r\n\r\n"Be silent, fool!" growled Lakamba, angrily.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi subsided into silence with a satisfied smile, while Dain, who\r\nhad been watching him as if fascinated, turned with a sigh of relief\r\ntowards the ruler of Sambir.  Lakamba did not move, and, without raising\r\nhis head, looked at Dain from under his eyebrows, breathing audibly, with\r\npouted lips, in an air of general discontent.\r\n\r\n"Speak!  O Dain!" he said at last.  "We have heard many rumours.  Many\r\nnights in succession has my friend Reshid come here with bad tidings.\r\nNews travels fast along the coast.  But they may be untrue; there are\r\nmore lies in men\'s mouths in these days than when I was young, but I am\r\nnot easier to deceive now."\r\n\r\n"All my words are true," said Dain, carelessly.  "If you want to know\r\nwhat befell my brig, then learn that it is in the hands of the Dutch.\r\nBelieve me, Rajah," he went on, with sudden energy, "the Orang Blanda\r\nhave good friends in Sambir, or else how did they know I was coming\r\nthence?"\r\n\r\nLakamba gave Dain a short and hostile glance.  Babalatchi rose quietly,\r\nand, going to the arm-rack, struck the gong violently.\r\n\r\nOutside the door there was a shuffle of bare feet; inside, the guard woke\r\nup and sat staring in sleepy surprise.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you faithful friend of the white Rajah," went on Dain, scornfully,\r\nturning to Babalatchi, who had returned to his place, "I have escaped,\r\nand I am here to gladden your heart.  When I saw the Dutch ship I ran the\r\nbrig inside the reefs and put her ashore.  They did not dare to follow\r\nwith the ship, so they sent the boats.  We took to ours and tried to get\r\naway, but the ship dropped fireballs at us, and killed many of my men.\r\nBut I am left, O Babalatchi!  The Dutch are coming here.  They are\r\nseeking for me.  They are coming to ask their faithful friend Lakamba and\r\nhis slave Babalatchi.  Rejoice!"\r\n\r\nBut neither of his hearers appeared to be in a joyful mood.  Lakamba had\r\nput one leg over his knee, and went on gently scratching it with a\r\nmeditative air, while Babalatchi, sitting cross-legged, seemed suddenly\r\nto become smaller and very limp, staring straight before him vacantly.\r\nThe guard evinced some interest in the proceedings, stretching themselves\r\nfull length on the mats to be nearer the speaker.  One of them got up and\r\nnow stood leaning against the arm-rack, playing absently with the fringes\r\nof his sword-hilt.\r\n\r\nDain waited till the crash of thunder had died away in distant mutterings\r\nbefore he spoke again.\r\n\r\n"Are you dumb, O ruler of Sambir, or is the son of a great Rajah unworthy\r\nof your notice?  I am come here to seek refuge and to warn you, and want\r\nto know what you intend doing."\r\n\r\n"You came here because of the white man\'s daughter," retorted Lakamba,\r\nquickly.  "Your refuge was with your father, the Rajah of Bali, the Son\r\nof Heaven, the \'Anak Agong\' himself.  What am I to protect great princes?\r\nOnly yesterday I planted rice in a burnt clearing; to-day you say I hold\r\nyour life in my hand."\r\n\r\nBabalatchi glanced at his master.  "No man can escape his fate," he\r\nmurmured piously.  "When love enters a man\'s heart he is like a\r\nchild--without any understanding.  Be merciful, Lakamba," he added,\r\ntwitching the corner of the Rajah\'s sarong warningly.\r\n\r\nLakamba snatched away the skirt of the sarong angrily.  Under the dawning\r\ncomprehension of intolerable embarrassments caused by Dain\'s return to\r\nSambir he began to lose such composure as he had been, till then, able to\r\nmaintain; and now he raised his voice loudly above the whistling of the\r\nwind and the patter of rain on the roof in the hard squall passing over\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n"You came here first as a trader with sweet words and great promises,\r\nasking me to look the other way while you worked your will on the white\r\nman there.  And I did.  What do you want now?  When I was young I fought.\r\nNow I am old, and want peace.  It is easier for me to have you killed\r\nthan to fight the Dutch.  It is better for me."\r\n\r\nThe squall had now passed, and, in the short stillness of the lull in the\r\nstorm, Lakamba repeated softly, as if to himself, "Much easier.  Much\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\nDain did not seem greatly discomposed by the Rajah\'s threatening words.\r\nWhile Lakamba was speaking he had glanced once rapidly over his shoulder,\r\njust to make sure that there was nobody behind him, and, tranquillised in\r\nthat respect, he had extracted a siri-box out of the folds of his waist-\r\ncloth, and was wrapping carefully the little bit of betel-nut and a small\r\npinch of lime in the green leaf tendered him politely by the watchful\r\nBabalatchi.  He accepted this as a peace-offering from the silent\r\nstatesman--a kind of mute protest against his master\'s undiplomatic\r\nviolence, and as an omen of a possible understanding to be arrived at\r\nyet.  Otherwise Dain was not uneasy.  Although recognising the justice of\r\nLakamba\'s surmise that he had come back to Sambir only for the sake of\r\nthe white man\'s daughter, yet he was not conscious of any childish lack\r\nof understanding, as suggested by Babalatchi.  In fact, Dain knew very\r\nwell that Lakamba was too deeply implicated in the gunpowder smuggling to\r\ncare for an investigation the Dutch authorities into that matter.  When\r\nsent off by his father, the independent Rajah of Bali, at the time when\r\nthe hostilities between Dutch and Malays threatened to spread from\r\nSumatra over the whole archipelago, Dain had found all the big traders\r\ndeaf to his guarded proposals, and above the temptation of the great\r\nprices he was ready to give for gunpowder.  He went to Sambir as a last\r\nand almost hopeless resort, having heard in Macassar of the white man\r\nthere, and of the regular steamer trading from Singapore--allured also by\r\nthe fact that there was no Dutch resident on the river, which would make\r\nthings easier, no doubt.  His hopes got nearly wrecked against the\r\nstubborn loyalty of Lakamba arising from well-understood self-interest;\r\nbut at last the young man\'s generosity, his persuasive enthusiasm, the\r\nprestige of his father\'s great name, overpowered the prudent hesitation\r\nof the ruler of Sambir.  Lakamba would have nothing to do himself with\r\nany illegal traffic.  He also objected to the Arabs being made use of in\r\nthat matter; but he suggested Almayer, saying that he was a weak man\r\neasily persuaded, and that his friend, the English captain of the\r\nsteamer, could be made very useful--very likely even would join in the\r\nbusiness, smuggling the powder in the steamer without Abdulla\'s\r\nknowledge.  There again Dain met in Almayer with unexpected resistance;\r\nLakamba had to send Babalatchi over with the solemn promise that his eyes\r\nwould be shut in friendship for the white man, Dain paying for the\r\npromise and the friendship in good silver guilders of the hated Orang\r\nBlanda.  Almayer, at last consenting, said the powder would be obtained,\r\nbut Dain must trust him with dollars to send to Singapore in payment for\r\nit.  He would induce Ford to buy and smuggle it in the steamer on board\r\nthe brig.  He did not want any money for himself out of the transaction,\r\nbut Dain must help him in his great enterprise after sending off the\r\nbrig.  Almayer had explained to Dain that he could not trust Lakamba\r\nalone in that matter; he would be afraid of losing his treasure and his\r\nlife through the cupidity of the Rajah; yet the Rajah had to be told, and\r\ninsisted on taking a share in that operation, or else his eyes would\r\nremain shut no longer.  To this Almayer had to submit.  Had Dain not seen\r\nNina he would have probably refused to engage himself and his men in the\r\nprojected expedition to Gunong Mas--the mountain of gold.  As it was he\r\nintended to return with half of his men as soon as the brig was clear of\r\nthe reefs, but the persistent chase given him by the Dutch frigate had\r\nforced him to run south and ultimately to wreck and destroy his vessel in\r\norder to preserve his liberty or perhaps even his life.  Yes, he had come\r\nback to Sambir for Nina, although aware that the Dutch would look for him\r\nthere, but he had also calculated his chances of safety in Lakamba\'s\r\nhands.  For all his ferocious talk, the merciful ruler would not kill\r\nhim, for he had long ago been impressed with the notion that Dain\r\npossessed the secret of the white man\'s treasure; neither would he give\r\nhim up to the Dutch, for fear of some fatal disclosure of complicity in\r\nthe treasonable trade.  So Dain felt tolerably secure as he sat\r\nmeditating quietly his answer to the Rajah\'s bloodthirsty speech.  Yes,\r\nhe would point out to him the aspect of his position should he--Dain--fall\r\ninto the hands of the Dutch and should he speak the truth.  He would have\r\nnothing more to lose then, and he would speak the truth.  And if he did\r\nreturn to Sambir, disturbing thereby Lakamba\'s peace of mind, what then?\r\nHe came to look after his property.  Did he not pour a stream of silver\r\ninto Mrs. Almayer\'s greedy lap?  He had paid, for the girl, a price\r\nworthy of a great prince, although unworthy of that delightfully\r\nmaddening creature for whom his untamed soul longed in an intensity of\r\ndesire far more tormenting than the sharpest pain.  He wanted his\r\nhappiness.  He had the right to be in Sambir.\r\n\r\nHe rose, and, approaching the table, leaned both his elbows on it;\r\nLakamba responsively edged his seat a little closer, while Babalatchi\r\nscrambled to his feet and thrust his inquisitive head between his\r\nmaster\'s and Dain\'s.  They interchanged their ideas rapidly, speaking in\r\nwhispers into each other\'s faces, very close now, Dain suggesting,\r\nLakamba contradicting, Babalatchi conciliating and anxious in his vivid\r\napprehension of coming difficulties.  He spoke most, whispering\r\nearnestly, turning his head slowly from side to side so as to bring his\r\nsolitary eye to bear upon each of his interlocutors in turn.  Why should\r\nthere be strife? said he.  Let Tuan Dain, whom he loved only less than\r\nhis master, go trustfully into hiding.  There were many places for that.\r\nBulangi\'s house away in the clearing was best.\r\n\r\nBulangi was a safe man.  In the network of crooked channels no white man\r\ncould find his way.  White men were strong, but very foolish.  It was\r\nundesirable to fight them, but deception was easy.  They were like silly\r\nwomen--they did not know the use of reason, and he was a match for any of\r\nthem--went on Babalatchi, with all the confidence of deficient\r\nexperience.  Probably the Dutch would seek Almayer.  Maybe they would\r\ntake away their countryman if they were suspicious of him.  That would be\r\ngood.  After the Dutch went away Lakamba and Dain would get the treasure\r\nwithout any trouble, and there would be one person less to share it.  Did\r\nhe not speak wisdom?  Will Tuan Dain go to Bulangi\'s house till the\r\ndanger is over, go at once?\r\n\r\nDain accepted this suggestion of going into hiding with a certain sense\r\nof conferring a favour upon Lakamba and the anxious statesman, but he met\r\nthe proposal of going at once with a decided no, looking Babalatchi\r\nmeaningly in the eye.  The statesman sighed as a man accepting the\r\ninevitable would do, and pointed silently towards the other bank of the\r\nriver.  Dain bent his head slowly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am going there," he said.\r\n\r\n"Before the day comes?" asked Babalatchi.\r\n\r\n"I am going there now," answered Dain, decisively.  "The Orang Blanda\r\nwill not be here before to-morrow night, perhaps, and I must tell Almayer\r\nof our arrangements."\r\n\r\n"No, Tuan.  No; say nothing," protested Babalatchi.  "I will go over\r\nmyself at sunrise and let him know."\r\n\r\n"I will see," said Dain, preparing to go.\r\n\r\nThe thunderstorm was recommencing outside, the heavy clouds hanging low\r\noverhead now.\r\n\r\nThere was a constant rumble of distant thunder punctuated by the nearer\r\nsharp crashes, and in the continuous play of blue lightning the woods and\r\nthe river showed fitfully, with all the elusive distinctness of detail\r\ncharacteristic of such a scene.  Outside the door of the Rajah\'s house\r\nDain and Babalatchi stood on the shaking verandah as if dazed and stunned\r\nby the violence of the storm.  They stood there amongst the cowering\r\nforms of the Rajah\'s slaves and retainers seeking shelter from the rain,\r\nand Dain called aloud to his boatmen, who responded with an unanimous\r\n"Ada!  Tuan!" while they looked uneasily at the river.\r\n\r\n"This is a great flood!" shouted Babalatchi into Dain\'s ear.  "The river\r\nis very angry.  Look!  Look at the drifting logs!  Can you go?"\r\n\r\nDain glanced doubtfully on the livid expanse of seething water bounded\r\nfar away on the other side by the narrow black line of the forests.\r\nSuddenly, in a vivid white flash, the low point of land with the bending\r\ntrees on it and Almayer\'s house, leaped into view, flickered and\r\ndisappeared.  Dain pushed Babalatchi aside and ran down to the water-gate\r\nfollowed by his shivering boatmen.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi backed slowly in and closed the door, then turned round and\r\nlooked silently upon Lakamba.  The Rajah sat still, glaring stonily upon\r\nthe table, and Babalatchi gazed curiously at the perplexed mood of the\r\nman he had served so many years through good and evil fortune.  No doubt\r\nthe one-eyed statesman felt within his savage and much sophisticated\r\nbreast the unwonted feelings of sympathy with, and perhaps even pity for,\r\nthe man he called his master.  From the safe position of a confidential\r\nadviser, he could, in the dim vista of past years, see himself--a casual\r\ncut-throat--finding shelter under that man\'s roof in the modest\r\nrice-clearing of early beginnings.  Then came a long period of unbroken\r\nsuccess, of wise counsels, and deep plottings resolutely carried out by\r\nthe fearless Lakamba, till the whole east coast from Poulo Laut to\r\nTanjong Batu listened to Babalatchi\'s wisdom speaking through the mouth\r\nof the ruler of Sambir.  In those long years how many dangers escaped,\r\nhow many enemies bravely faced, how many white men successfully\r\ncircumvented!  And now he looked upon the result of so many years of\r\npatient toil: the fearless Lakamba cowed by the shadow of an impending\r\ntrouble.  The ruler was growing old, and Babalatchi, aware of an uneasy\r\nfeeling at the pit of his stomach, put both his hands there with a\r\nsuddenly vivid and sad perception of the fact that he himself was growing\r\nold too; that the time of reckless daring was past for both of them, and\r\nthat they had to seek refuge in prudent cunning.  They wanted peace; they\r\nwere disposed to reform; they were ready even to retrench, so as to have\r\nthe wherewithal to bribe the evil days away, if bribed away they could\r\nbe.  Babalatchi sighed for the second time that night as he squatted\r\nagain at his master\'s feet and tendered him his betel-nut box in mute\r\nsympathy.  And they sat there in close yet silent communion of betel-nut\r\nchewers, moving their jaws slowly, expectorating decorously into the wide-\r\nmouthed brass vessel they passed to one another, and listening to the\r\nawful din of the battling elements outside.\r\n\r\n"There is a very great flood," remarked Babalatchi, sadly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lakamba.  "Did Dain go?"\r\n\r\n"He went, Tuan.  He ran down to the river like a man possessed of the\r\nSheitan himself."\r\n\r\nThere was another long pause.\r\n\r\n"He may get drowned," suggested Lakamba at last, with some show of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"The floating logs are many," answered Babalatchi, "but he is a good\r\nswimmer," he added languidly.\r\n\r\n"He ought to live," said Lakamba; "he knows where the treasure is."\r\n\r\nBabalatchi assented with an ill-humoured grunt.  His want of success in\r\npenetrating the white man\'s secret as to the locality where the gold was\r\nto be found was a sore point with the statesman of Sambir, as the only\r\nconspicuous failure in an otherwise brilliant career.\r\n\r\nA great peace had now succeeded the turmoil of the storm.  Only the\r\nlittle belated clouds, which hurried past overhead to catch up the main\r\nbody flashing silently in the distance, sent down short showers that\r\npattered softly with a soothing hiss over the palm-leaf roof.\r\n\r\nLakamba roused himself from his apathy with an appearance of having\r\ngrasped the situation at last.\r\n\r\n"Babalatchi," he called briskly, giving him a slight kick.\r\n\r\n"Ada Tuan!  I am listening."\r\n\r\n"If the Orang Blanda come here, Babalatchi, and take Almayer to Batavia\r\nto punish him for smuggling gunpowder, what will he do, you think?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know, Tuan."\r\n\r\n"You are a fool," commented Lakamba, exultingly.  "He will tell them\r\nwhere the treasure is, so as to find mercy.  He will."\r\n\r\nBabalatchi looked up at his master and nodded his head with by no means a\r\njoyful surprise.  He had not thought of this; there was a new\r\ncomplication.\r\n\r\n"Almayer must die," said Lakamba, decisively, "to make our secret safe.\r\nHe must die quietly, Babalatchi.  You must do it."\r\n\r\nBabalatchi assented, and rose wearily to his feet.  "To-morrow?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Yes; before the Dutch come.  He drinks much coffee," answered Lakamba,\r\nwith seeming irrelevancy.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi stretched himself yawning, but Lakamba, in the flattering\r\nconsciousness of a knotty problem solved by his own unaided intellectual\r\nefforts, grew suddenly very wakeful.\r\n\r\n"Babalatchi," he said to the exhausted statesman, "fetch the box of music\r\nthe white captain gave me.  I cannot sleep."\r\n\r\nAt this order a deep shade of melancholy settled upon Babalatchi\'s\r\nfeatures.  He went reluctantly behind the curtain and soon reappeared\r\ncarrying in his arms a small hand-organ, which he put down on the table\r\nwith an air of deep dejection.  Lakamba settled himself comfortably in\r\nhis arm-chair.\r\n\r\n"Turn, Babalatchi, turn," he murmured, with closed eyes.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi\'s hand grasped the handle with the energy of despair, and as\r\nhe turned, the deep gloom on his countenance changed into an expression\r\nof hopeless resignation.  Through the open shutter the notes of Verdi\'s\r\nmusic floated out on the great silence over the river and forest.  Lakamba\r\nlistened with closed eyes and a delighted smile; Babalatchi turned, at\r\ntimes dozing off and swaying over, then catching himself up in a great\r\nfright with a few quick turns of the handle.  Nature slept in an\r\nexhausted repose after the fierce turmoil, while under the unsteady hand\r\nof the statesman of Sambir the Trovatore fitfully wept, wailed, and bade\r\ngood-bye to his Leonore again and again in a mournful round of tearful\r\nand endless iteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bright sunshine of the clear mistless morning, after the stormy\r\nnight, flooded the main path of the settlement leading from the low shore\r\nof the Pantai branch of the river to the gate of Abdulla\'s compound.  The\r\npath was deserted this morning; it stretched its dark yellow surface,\r\nhard beaten by the tramp of many bare feet, between the clusters of palm\r\ntrees, whose tall trunks barred it with strong black lines at irregular\r\nintervals, while the newly risen sun threw the shadows of their leafy\r\nheads far away over the roofs of the buildings lining the river, even\r\nover the river itself as it flowed swiftly and silently past the deserted\r\nhouses.  For the houses were deserted too.  On the narrow strip of\r\ntrodden grass intervening between their open doors and the road, the\r\nmorning fires smouldered untended, sending thin fluted columns of smoke\r\ninto the cool air, and spreading the thinnest veil of mysterious blue\r\nhaze over the sunlit solitude of the settlement.  Almayer, just out of\r\nhis hammock, gazed sleepily at the unwonted appearance of Sambir,\r\nwondering vaguely at the absence of life.  His own house was very quiet;\r\nhe could not hear his wife\'s voice, nor the sound of Nina\'s footsteps in\r\nthe big room, opening on the verandah, which he called his sitting-room,\r\nwhenever, in the company of white men, he wished to assert his claims to\r\nthe commonplace decencies of civilisation.  Nobody ever sat there; there\r\nwas nothing there to sit upon, for Mrs. Almayer in her savage moods, when\r\nexcited by the reminiscences of the piratical period of her life, had\r\ntorn off the curtains to make sarongs for the slave-girls, and had burnt\r\nthe showy furniture piecemeal to cook the family rice.  But Almayer was\r\nnot thinking of his furniture now.  He was thinking of Dain\'s return, of\r\nDain\'s nocturnal interview with Lakamba, of its possible influence on his\r\nlong-matured plans, now nearing the period of their execution.  He was\r\nalso uneasy at the non-appearance of Dain who had promised him an early\r\nvisit.  "The fellow had plenty of time to cross the river," he mused,\r\n"and there was so much to be done to-day.  The settling of details for\r\nthe early start on the morrow; the launching of the boats; the thousand\r\nand one finishing touches.  For the expedition must start complete,\r\nnothing should be forgotten, nothing should--"\r\n\r\nThe sense of the unwonted solitude grew upon him suddenly, and in the\r\nunusual silence he caught himself longing even for the usually unwelcome\r\nsound of his wife\'s voice to break the oppressive stillness which seemed,\r\nto his frightened fancy, to portend the advent of some new misfortune.\r\n"What has happened?" he muttered half aloud, as he shuffled in his\r\nimperfectly adjusted slippers towards the balustrade of the verandah.  "Is\r\neverybody asleep or dead?"\r\n\r\nThe settlement was alive and very much awake.  It was awake ever since\r\nthe early break of day, when Mahmat Banjer, in a fit of unheard-of\r\nenergy, arose and, taking up his hatchet, stepped over the sleeping forms\r\nof his two wives and walked shivering to the water\'s edge to make sure\r\nthat the new house he was building had not floated away during the night.\r\n\r\nThe house was being built by the enterprising Mahmat on a large raft, and\r\nhe had securely moored it just inside the muddy point of land at the\r\njunction of the two branches of the Pantai so as to be out of the way of\r\ndrifting logs that would no doubt strand on the point during the freshet.\r\nMahmat walked through the wet grass saying bourrouh, and cursing softly\r\nto himself the hard necessities of active life that drove him from his\r\nwarm couch into the cold of the morning.  A glance showed him that his\r\nhouse was still there, and he congratulated himself on his foresight in\r\nhauling it out of harm\'s way, for the increasing light showed him a\r\nconfused wrack of drift-logs, half-stranded on the muddy flat,\r\ninterlocked into a shapeless raft by their branches, tossing to and fro\r\nand grinding together in the eddy caused by the meeting currents of the\r\ntwo branches of the river.  Mahmat walked down to the water\'s edge to\r\nexamine the rattan moorings of his house just as the sun cleared the\r\ntrees of the forest on the opposite shore.  As he bent over the\r\nfastenings he glanced again carelessly at the unquiet jumble of logs and\r\nsaw there something that caused him to drop his hatchet and stand up,\r\nshading his eyes with his hand from the rays of the rising sun.  It was\r\nsomething red, and the logs rolled over it, at times closing round it,\r\nsometimes hiding it.  It looked to him at first like a strip of red\r\ncloth.  The next moment Mahmat had made it out and raised a great shout.\r\n\r\n"Ah ya!  There!" yelled Mahmat.  "There\'s a man amongst the logs."  He\r\nput the palms of his hand to his lips and shouted, enunciating\r\ndistinctly, his face turned towards the settlement: "There\'s a body of a\r\nman in the river!  Come and see!  A dead--stranger!"\r\n\r\nThe women of the nearest house were already outside kindling the fires\r\nand husking the morning rice.  They took up the cry shrilly, and it\r\ntravelled so from house to house, dying away in the distance.  The men\r\nrushed out excited but silent, and ran towards the muddy point where the\r\nunconscious logs tossed and ground and bumped and rolled over the dead\r\nstranger with the stupid persistency of inanimate things.  The women\r\nfollowed, neglecting their domestic duties and disregarding the\r\npossibilities of domestic discontent, while groups of children brought up\r\nthe rear, warbling joyously, in the delight of unexpected excitement.\r\n\r\nAlmayer called aloud for his wife and daughter, but receiving no\r\nresponse, stood listening intently.  The murmur of the crowd reached him\r\nfaintly, bringing with it the assurance of some unusual event.  He\r\nglanced at the river just as he was going to leave the verandah and\r\nchecked himself at the sight of a small canoe crossing over from the\r\nRajah\'s landing-place.  The solitary occupant (in whom Almayer soon\r\nrecognised Babalatchi) effected the crossing a little below the house and\r\npaddled up to the Lingard jetty in the dead water under the bank.\r\nBabalatchi clambered out slowly and went on fastening his canoe with\r\nfastidious care, as if not in a hurry to meet Almayer, whom he saw\r\nlooking at him from the verandah.  This delay gave Almayer time to notice\r\nand greatly wonder at Babalatchi\'s official get-up.  The statesman of\r\nSambir was clad in a costume befitting his high rank.  A loudly checkered\r\nsarong encircled his waist, and from its many folds peeped out the silver\r\nhilt of the kriss that saw the light only on great festivals or during\r\nofficial receptions.  Over the left shoulder and across the otherwise\r\nunclad breast of the aged diplomatist glistened a patent leather belt\r\nbearing a brass plate with the arms of Netherlands under the inscription,\r\n"Sultan of Sambir."  Babalatchi\'s head was covered by a red turban, whose\r\nfringed ends falling over the left cheek and shoulder gave to his aged\r\nface a ludicrous expression of joyous recklessness.  When the canoe was\r\nat last fastened to his satisfaction he straightened himself up, shaking\r\ndown the folds of his sarong, and moved with long strides towards\r\nAlmayer\'s house, swinging regularly his long ebony staff, whose gold head\r\nornamented with precious stones flashed in the morning sun.  Almayer\r\nwaved his hand to the right towards the point of land, to him invisible,\r\nbut in full view from the jetty.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Babalatchi! oh!" he called out; "what is the matter there? can you\r\nsee?"\r\n\r\nBabalatchi stopped and gazed intently at the crowd on the river bank, and\r\nafter a little while the astonished Almayer saw him leave the path,\r\ngather up his sarong in one hand, and break into a trot through the grass\r\ntowards the muddy point.  Almayer, now greatly interested, ran down the\r\nsteps of the verandah.  The murmur of men\'s voices and the shrill cries\r\nof women reached him quite distinctly now, and as soon as he turned the\r\ncorner of his house he could see the crowd on the low promontory swaying\r\nand pushing round some object of interest.  He could indistinctly hear\r\nBabalatchi\'s voice, then the crowd opened before the aged statesman and\r\nclosed after him with an excited hum, ending in a loud shout.\r\n\r\nAs Almayer approached the throng a man ran out and rushed past him\r\ntowards the settlement, unheeding his call to stop and explain the cause\r\nof this excitement.  On the very outskirts of the crowd Almayer found\r\nhimself arrested by an unyielding mass of humanity, regardless of his\r\nentreaties for a passage, insensible to his gentle pushes as he tried to\r\nwork his way through it towards the riverside.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his gentle and slow progress he fancied suddenly he had\r\nheard his wife\'s voice in the thickest of the throng.  He could not\r\nmistake very well Mrs. Almayer\'s high-pitched tones, yet the words were\r\ntoo indistinct for him to understand their purport.  He paused in his\r\nendeavours to make a passage for himself, intending to get some\r\nintelligence from those around him, when a long and piercing shriek rent\r\nthe air, silencing the murmurs of the crowd and the voices of his\r\ninformants.  For a moment Almayer remained as if turned into stone with\r\nastonishment and horror, for he was certain now that he had heard his\r\nwife wailing for the dead.  He remembered Nina\'s unusual absence, and\r\nmaddened by his apprehensions as to her safety, he pushed blindly and\r\nviolently forward, the crowd falling back with cries of surprise and pain\r\nbefore his frantic advance.\r\n\r\nOn the point of land in a little clear space lay the body of the stranger\r\njust hauled out from amongst the logs.  On one side stood Babalatchi, his\r\nchin resting on the head of his staff and his one eye gazing steadily at\r\nthe shapeless mass of broken limbs, torn flesh, and bloodstained rags.  As\r\nAlmayer burst through the ring of horrified spectators, Mrs. Almayer\r\nthrew her own head-veil over the upturned face of the drowned man, and,\r\nsquatting by it, with another mournful howl, sent a shiver through the\r\nnow silent crowd.  Mahmat, dripping wet, turned to Almayer, eager to tell\r\nhis tale.\r\n\r\nIn the first moment of reaction from the anguish of his fear the sunshine\r\nseemed to waver before Almayer\'s eyes, and he listened to words spoken\r\naround him without comprehending their meaning.  When, by a strong effort\r\nof will, he regained the possession of his senses, Mahmat was saying--\r\n\r\n"That is the way, Tuan.  His sarong was caught in the broken branch, and\r\nhe hung with his head under water.  When I saw what it was I did not want\r\nit here.  I wanted it to get clear and drift away.  Why should we bury a\r\nstranger in the midst of our houses for his ghost to frighten our women\r\nand children?  Have we not enough ghosts about this place?"\r\n\r\nA murmur of approval interrupted him here.  Mahmat looked reproachfully\r\nat Babalatchi.\r\n\r\n"But the Tuan Babalatchi ordered me to drag the body ashore"--he went on\r\nlooking round at his audience, but addressing himself only to\r\nAlmayer--"and I dragged him by the feet; in through the mud I have\r\ndragged him, although my heart longed to see him float down the river to\r\nstrand perchance on Bulangi\'s clearing--may his father\'s grave be\r\ndefiled!"\r\n\r\nThere was subdued laughter at this, for the enmity of Mahmat and Bulangi\r\nwas a matter of common notoriety and of undying interest to the\r\ninhabitants of Sambir.  In the midst of that mirth Mrs. Almayer wailed\r\nsuddenly again.\r\n\r\n"Allah!  What ails the woman!" exclaimed Mahmat, angrily.  "Here, I have\r\ntouched this carcass which came from nobody knows where, and have most\r\nlikely defiled myself before eating rice.  By orders of Tuan Babalatchi I\r\ndid this thing to please the white man.  Are you pleased, O Tuan Almayer?\r\nAnd what will be my recompense?  Tuan Babalatchi said a recompense there\r\nwill be, and from you.  Now consider.  I have been defiled, and if not\r\ndefiled I may be under the spell.  Look at his anklets!  Who ever heard\r\nof a corpse appearing during the night amongst the logs with gold anklets\r\non its legs?  There is witchcraft there.  However," added Mahmat, after a\r\nreflective pause, "I will have the anklet if there is permission, for I\r\nhave a charm against the ghosts and am not afraid.  God is great!"\r\n\r\nA fresh outburst of noisy grief from Mrs. Almayer checked the flow of\r\nMahmat\'s eloquence.  Almayer, bewildered, looked in turn at his wife, at\r\nMahmat, at Babalatchi, and at last arrested his fascinated gaze on the\r\nbody lying on the mud with covered face in a grotesquely unnatural\r\ncontortion of mangled and broken limbs, one twisted and lacerated arm,\r\nwith white bones protruding in many places through the torn flesh,\r\nstretched out; the hand with outspread fingers nearly touching his foot.\r\n\r\n"Do you know who this is?" he asked of Babalatchi, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi, staring straight before him, hardly moved his lips, while\r\nMrs. Almayer\'s persistent lamentations drowned the whisper of his\r\nmurmured reply intended only for Almayer\'s ear.\r\n\r\n"It was fate.  Look at your feet, white man.  I can see a ring on those\r\ntorn fingers which I know well."\r\n\r\nSaying this, Babalatchi stepped carelessly forward, putting his foot as\r\nif accidentally on the hand of the corpse and pressing it into the soft\r\nmud.  He swung his staff menacingly towards the crowd, which fell back a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n"Go away," he said sternly, "and send your women to their cooking fires,\r\nwhich they ought not to have left to run after a dead stranger.  This is\r\nmen\'s work here.  I take him now in the name of the Rajah.  Let no man\r\nremain here but Tuan Almayer\'s slaves.  Now go!"\r\n\r\nThe crowd reluctantly began to disperse.  The women went first, dragging\r\naway the children that hung back with all their weight on the maternal\r\nhand.  The men strolled slowly after them in ever forming and changing\r\ngroups that gradually dissolved as they neared the settlement and every\r\nman regained his own house with steps quickened by the hungry\r\nanticipation of the morning rice.  Only on the slight elevation where the\r\nland sloped down towards the muddy point a few men, either friends or\r\nenemies of Mahmat, remained gazing curiously for some time longer at the\r\nsmall group standing around the body on the river bank.\r\n\r\n"I do not understand what you mean, Babalatchi," said Almayer.  "What is\r\nthe ring you are talking about?  Whoever he is, you have trodden the poor\r\nfellow\'s hand right into the mud.  Uncover his face," he went on,\r\naddressing Mrs. Almayer, who, squatting by the head of the corpse, rocked\r\nherself to and fro, shaking from time to time her dishevelled grey locks,\r\nand muttering mournfully.\r\n\r\n"Hai!" exclaimed Mahmat, who had lingered close by.  "Look, Tuan; the\r\nlogs came together so," and here he pressed the palms of his hands\r\ntogether, "and his head must have been between them, and now there is no\r\nface for you to look at.  There are his flesh and his bones, the nose,\r\nand the lips, and maybe his eyes, but nobody could tell the one from the\r\nother.  It was written the day he was born that no man could look at him\r\nin death and be able to say, \'This is my friend\'s face.\'"\r\n\r\n"Silence, Mahmat; enough!" said Babalatchi, "and take thy eyes off his\r\nanklet, thou eater of pigs flesh.  Tuan Almayer," he went on, lowering\r\nhis voice, "have you seen Dain this morning?"\r\n\r\nAlmayer opened his eyes wide and looked alarmed.  "No," he said quickly;\r\n"haven\'t you seen him?  Is he not with the Rajah?  I am waiting; why does\r\nhe not come?"\r\n\r\nBabalatchi nodded his head sadly.\r\n\r\n"He is come, Tuan.  He left last night when the storm was great and the\r\nriver spoke angrily.  The night was very black, but he had within him a\r\nlight that showed the way to your house as smooth as a narrow backwater,\r\nand the many logs no bigger than wisps of dried grass.  Therefore he\r\nwent; and now he lies here."  And Babalatchi nodded his head towards the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n"How can you tell?" said Almayer, excitedly, pushing his wife aside.  He\r\nsnatched the cover off and looked at the formless mass of flesh, hair,\r\nand drying mud, where the face of the drowned man should have been.\r\n"Nobody can tell," he added, turning away with a shudder.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi was on his knees wiping the mud from the stiffened fingers of\r\nthe outstretched hand.  He rose to his feet and flashed before Almayer\'s\r\neyes a gold ring set with a large green stone.\r\n\r\n"You know this well," he said.  "This never left Dain\'s hand.  I had to\r\ntear the flesh now to get it off.  Do you believe now?"\r\n\r\nAlmayer raised his hands to his head and let them fall listlessly by his\r\nside in the utter abandonment of despair.  Babalatchi, looking at him\r\ncuriously, was astonished to see him smile.  A strange fancy had taken\r\npossession of Almayer\'s brain, distracted by this new misfortune.  It\r\nseemed to him that for many years he had been falling into a deep\r\nprecipice.  Day after day, month after month, year after year, he had\r\nbeen falling, falling, falling; it was a smooth, round, black thing, and\r\nthe black walls had been rushing upwards with wearisome rapidity.  A\r\ngreat rush, the noise of which he fancied he could hear yet; and now,\r\nwith an awful shock, he had reached the bottom, and behold! he was alive\r\nand whole, and Dain was dead with all his bones broken.  It struck him as\r\nfunny.  A dead Malay; he had seen many dead Malays without any emotion;\r\nand now he felt inclined to weep, but it was over the fate of a white man\r\nhe knew; a man that fell over a deep precipice and did not die.  He\r\nseemed somehow to himself to be standing on one side, a little way off,\r\nlooking at a certain Almayer who was in great trouble.  Poor, poor\r\nfellow!  Why doesn\'t he cut his throat?  He wished to encourage him; he\r\nwas very anxious to see him lying dead over that other corpse.  Why does\r\nhe not die and end this suffering?  He groaned aloud unconsciously and\r\nstarted with affright at the sound of his own voice.  Was he going mad?\r\nTerrified by the thought he turned away and ran towards his house\r\nrepeating to himself, I am not going mad; of course not, no, no, no!  He\r\ntried to keep a firm hold of the idea.\r\n\r\nNot mad, not mad.  He stumbled as he ran blindly up the steps repeating\r\nfast and ever faster those words wherein seemed to lie his salvation.  He\r\nsaw Nina standing there, and wished to say something to her, but could\r\nnot remember what, in his extreme anxiety not to forget that he was not\r\ngoing mad, which he still kept repeating mentally as he ran round the\r\ntable, till he stumbled against one of the arm-chairs and dropped into it\r\nexhausted.  He sat staring wildly at Nina, still assuring himself\r\nmentally of his own sanity and wondering why the girl shrank from him in\r\nopen-eyed alarm.  What was the matter with her?  This was foolish.  He\r\nstruck the table violently with his clenched fist and shouted hoarsely,\r\n"Give me some gin!  Run!"  Then, while Nina ran off, he remained in the\r\nchair, very still and quiet, astonished at the noise he had made.\r\n\r\nNina returned with a tumbler half filled with gin, and found her father\r\nstaring absently before him.  Almayer felt very tired now, as if he had\r\ncome from a long journey.  He felt as if he had walked miles and miles\r\nthat morning and now wanted to rest very much.  He took the tumbler with\r\na shaking hand, and as he drank his teeth chattered against the glass\r\nwhich he drained and set down heavily on the table.  He turned his eyes\r\nslowly towards Nina standing beside him, and said steadily--\r\n\r\n"Now all is over, Nina.  He is dead, and I may as well burn all my\r\nboats."\r\n\r\nHe felt very proud of being able to speak so calmly.  Decidedly he was\r\nnot going mad.  This certitude was very comforting, and he went on\r\ntalking about the finding of the body, listening to his own voice\r\ncomplacently.  Nina stood quietly, her hand resting lightly on her\r\nfather\'s shoulder, her face unmoved, but every line of her features, the\r\nattitude of her whole body expressing the most keen and anxious\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n"And so Dain is dead," she said coldly, when her father ceased speaking.\r\n\r\nAlmayer\'s elaborately calm demeanour gave way in a moment to an outburst\r\nof violent indignation.\r\n\r\n"You stand there as if you were only half alive, and talk to me," he\r\nexclaimed angrily, "as if it was a matter of no importance.  Yes, he is\r\ndead!  Do you understand?  Dead!  What do you care?  You never cared; you\r\nsaw me struggle, and work, and strive, unmoved; and my suffering you\r\ncould never see.  No, never.  You have no heart, and you have no mind, or\r\nyou would have understood that it was for you, for your happiness I was\r\nworking.  I wanted to be rich; I wanted to get away from here.  I wanted\r\nto see white men bowing low before the power of your beauty and your\r\nwealth.  Old as I am I wished to seek a strange land, a civilisation to\r\nwhich I am a stranger, so as to find a new life in the contemplation of\r\nyour high fortunes, of your triumphs, of your happiness.  For that I bore\r\npatiently the burden of work, of disappointment, of humiliation amongst\r\nthese savages here, and I had it all nearly in my grasp."\r\n\r\nHe looked at his daughter\'s attentive face and jumped to his feet\r\nupsetting the chair.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear?  I had it all there; so; within reach of my hand."\r\n\r\nHe paused, trying to keep down his rising anger, and failed.\r\n\r\n"Have you no feeling?" he went on.  "Have you lived without hope?"  Nina\'s\r\nsilence exasperated him; his voice rose, although he tried to master his\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n"Are you content to live in this misery and die in this wretched hole?\r\nSay something, Nina; have you no sympathy?  Have you no word of comfort\r\nfor me?  I that loved you so."\r\n\r\nHe waited for a while for an answer, and receiving none shook his fist in\r\nhis daughter\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I believe you are an idiot!" he yelled.\r\n\r\nHe looked round for the chair, picked it up and sat down stiffly.  His\r\nanger was dead within him, and he felt ashamed of his outburst, yet\r\nrelieved to think that now he had laid clear before his daughter the\r\ninner meaning of his life.  He thought so in perfect good faith, deceived\r\nby the emotional estimate of his motives, unable to see the crookedness\r\nof his ways, the unreality of his aims, the futility of his regrets.  And\r\nnow his heart was filled only with a great tenderness and love for his\r\ndaughter.  He wanted to see her miserable, and to share with her his\r\ndespair; but he wanted it only as all weak natures long for a\r\ncompanionship in misfortune with beings innocent of its cause.  If she\r\nsuffered herself she would understand and pity him; but now she would\r\nnot, or could not, find one word of comfort or love for him in his dire\r\nextremity.  The sense of his absolute loneliness came home to his heart\r\nwith a force that made him shudder.  He swayed and fell forward with his\r\nface on the table, his arms stretched straight out, extended and rigid.\r\nNina made a quick movement towards her father and stood looking at the\r\ngrey head, on the broad shoulders shaken convulsively by the violence of\r\nfeelings that found relief at last in sobs and tears.\r\n\r\nNina sighed deeply and moved away from the table.  Her features lost the\r\nappearance of stony indifference that had exasperated her father into his\r\noutburst of anger and sorrow.  The expression of her face, now unseen by\r\nher father, underwent a rapid change.  She had listened to Almayer\'s\r\nappeal for sympathy, for one word of comfort, apparently indifferent, yet\r\nwith her breast torn by conflicting impulses raised unexpectedly by\r\nevents she had not foreseen, or at least did not expect to happen so\r\nsoon.  With her heart deeply moved by the sight of Almayer\'s misery,\r\nknowing it in her power to end it with a word, longing to bring peace to\r\nthat troubled heart, she heard with terror the voice of her overpowering\r\nlove commanding her to be silent.  And she submitted after a short and\r\nfierce struggle of her old self against the new principle of her life.\r\nShe wrapped herself up in absolute silence, the only safeguard against\r\nsome fatal admission.  She could not trust herself to make a sign, to\r\nmurmur a word for fear of saying too much; and the very violence of the\r\nfeelings that stirred the innermost recesses of her soul seemed to turn\r\nher person into a stone.  The dilated nostrils and the flashing eyes were\r\nthe only signs of the storm raging within, and those signs of his\r\ndaughter\'s emotion Almayer did not see, for his sight was dimmed by self-\r\npity, by anger, and by despair.\r\n\r\nHad Almayer looked at his daughter as she leant over the front rail of\r\nthe verandah he could have seen the expression of indifference give way\r\nto a look of pain, and that again pass away, leaving the glorious beauty\r\nof her face marred by deep-drawn lines of watchful anxiety.  The long\r\ngrass in the neglected courtyard stood very straight before her eyes in\r\nthe noonday heat.  From the river-bank there were voices and a shuffle of\r\nbare feet approaching the house; Babalatchi could be heard giving\r\ndirections to Almayer\'s men, and Mrs. Almayer\'s subdued wailing became\r\naudible as the small procession bearing the body of the drowned man and\r\nheaded by that sorrowful matron turned the corner of the house.\r\nBabalatchi had taken the broken anklet off the man\'s leg, and now held it\r\nin his hand as he moved by the side of the bearers, while Mahmat lingered\r\nbehind timidly, in the hopes of the promised reward.\r\n\r\n"Lay him there," said Babalatchi to Almayer\'s men, pointing to a pile of\r\ndrying planks in front of the verandah.  "Lay him there.  He was a Kaffir\r\nand the son of a dog, and he was the white man\'s friend.  He drank the\r\nwhite man\'s strong water," he added, with affected horror.  "That I have\r\nseen myself."\r\n\r\nThe men stretched out the broken limbs on two planks they had laid level,\r\nwhile Mrs. Almayer covered the body with a piece of white cotton cloth,\r\nand after whispering for some time with Babalatchi departed to her\r\ndomestic duties.  Almayer\'s men, after laying down their burden,\r\ndispersed themselves in quest of shady spots wherein to idle the day\r\naway.  Babalatchi was left alone by the corpse that laid rigid under the\r\nwhite cloth in the bright sunshine.\r\n\r\nNina came down the steps and joined Babalatchi, who put his hand to his\r\nforehead, and squatted down with great deference.\r\n\r\n"You have a bangle there," said Nina, looking down on Babalatchi\'s\r\nupturned face and into his solitary eye.\r\n\r\n"I have, Mem Putih," returned the polite statesman.  Then turning towards\r\nMahmat he beckoned him closer, calling out, "Come here!"\r\n\r\nMahmat approached with some hesitation.  He avoided looking at Nina, but\r\nfixed his eyes on Babalatchi.\r\n\r\n"Now, listen," said Babalatchi, sharply.  "The ring and the anklet you\r\nhave seen, and you know they belonged to Dain the trader, and to no\r\nother.  Dain returned last night in a canoe.  He spoke with the Rajah,\r\nand in the middle of the night left to cross over to the white man\'s\r\nhouse.  There was a great flood, and this morning you found him in the\r\nriver."\r\n\r\n"By his feet I dragged him out," muttered Mahmat under his breath.  "Tuan\r\nBabalatchi, there will be a recompense!" he exclaimed aloud.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi held up the gold bangle before Mahmat\'s eyes.  "What I have\r\ntold you, Mahmat, is for all ears.  What I give you now is for your eyes\r\nonly.  Take."\r\n\r\nMahmat took the bangle eagerly and hid it in the folds of his\r\nwaist-cloth.  "Am I a fool to show this thing in a house with three women\r\nin it?" he growled.  "But I shall tell them about Dain the trader, and\r\nthere will be talk enough."\r\n\r\nHe turned and went away, increasing his pace as soon as he was outside\r\nAlmayer\'s compound.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi looked after him till he disappeared behind the bushes.  "Have\r\nI done well, Mem Putih?" he asked, humbly addressing Nina.\r\n\r\n"You have," answered Nina.  "The ring you may keep yourself."\r\n\r\nBabalatchi touched his lips and forehead, and scrambled to his feet.  He\r\nlooked at Nina, as if expecting her to say something more, but Nina\r\nturned towards the house and went up the steps, motioning him away with\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi picked up his staff and prepared to go.  It was very warm, and\r\nhe did not care for the long pull to the Rajah\'s house.  Yet he must go\r\nand tell the Rajah--tell of the event; of the change in his plans; of all\r\nhis suspicions.  He walked to the jetty and began casting off the rattan\r\npainter of his canoe.\r\n\r\nThe broad expanse of the lower reach, with its shimmering surface dotted\r\nby the black specks of the fishing canoes, lay before his eyes.  The\r\nfishermen seemed to be racing.  Babalatchi paused in his work, and looked\r\non with sudden interest.  The man in the foremost canoe, now within hail\r\nof the first houses of Sambir, laid in his paddle and stood up shouting--\r\n\r\n"The boats! the boats!  The man-of-war\'s boats are coming!  They are\r\nhere!"\r\n\r\nIn a moment the settlement was again alive with people rushing to the\r\nriverside.  The men began to unfasten their boats, the women stood in\r\ngroups looking towards the bend down the river.  Above the trees lining\r\nthe reach a slight puff of smoke appeared like a black stain on the\r\nbrilliant blue of the cloudless sky.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi stood perplexed, the painter in his hand.  He looked down the\r\nreach, then up towards Almayer\'s house, and back again at the river as if\r\nundecided what to do.  At last he made the canoe fast again hastily, and\r\nran towards the house and up the steps of the verandah.\r\n\r\n"Tuan!  Tuan!" he called, eagerly.  "The boats are coming.  The man-of-\r\nwar\'s boats.  You had better get ready.  The officers will come here, I\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nAlmayer lifted his head slowly from the table, and looked at him\r\nstupidly.\r\n\r\n"Mem Putih!" exclaimed Babalatchi to Nina, "look at him.  He does not\r\nhear.  You must take care," he added meaningly.\r\n\r\nNina nodded to him with an uncertain smile, and was going to speak, when\r\na sharp report from the gun mounted in the bow of the steam launch that\r\nwas just then coming into view arrested the words on her parted lips.  The\r\nsmile died out, and was replaced by the old look of anxious attention.\r\nFrom the hills far away the echo came back like a long-drawn and mournful\r\nsigh, as if the land had sent it in answer to the voice of its masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news as to the identity of the body lying now in Almayer\'s compound\r\nspread rapidly over the settlement.  During the forenoon most of the\r\ninhabitants remained in the long street discussing the mysterious return\r\nand the unexpected death of the man who had become known to them as the\r\ntrader.  His arrival during the north-east monsoon, his long sojourn in\r\ntheir midst, his sudden departure with his brig, and, above all, the\r\nmysterious appearance of the body, said to be his, amongst the logs, were\r\nsubjects to wonder at and to talk over and over again with undiminished\r\ninterest.  Mahmat moved from house to house and from group to group,\r\nalways ready to repeat his tale: how he saw the body caught by the sarong\r\nin a forked log; how Mrs. Almayer coming, one of the first, at his cries,\r\nrecognised it, even before he had it hauled on shore; how Babalatchi\r\nordered him to bring it out of the water.  "By the feet I dragged him in,\r\nand there was no head," exclaimed Mahmat, "and how could the white man\'s\r\nwife know who it was?  She was a witch, it was well known.  And did you\r\nsee how the white man himself ran away at the sight of the body?  Like a\r\ndeer he ran!"  And here Mahmat imitated Almayer\'s long strides, to the\r\ngreat joy of the beholders.  And for all his trouble he had nothing.  The\r\nring with the green stone Tuan Babalatchi kept.  "Nothing!  Nothing!"  He\r\nspat down at his feet in sign of disgust, and left that group to seek\r\nfurther on a fresh audience.\r\n\r\nThe news spreading to the furthermost parts of the settlement found out\r\nAbdulla in the cool recess of his godown, where he sat overlooking his\r\nArab clerks and the men loading and unloading the up-country canoes.\r\nReshid, who was busy on the jetty, was summoned into his uncle\'s presence\r\nand found him, as usual, very calm and even cheerful, but very much\r\nsurprised.  The rumour of the capture or destruction of Dain\'s brig had\r\nreached the Arab\'s ears three days before from the sea-fishermen and\r\nthrough the dwellers on the lower reaches of the river.  It had been\r\npassed up-stream from neighbour to neighbour till Bulangi, whose clearing\r\nwas nearest to the settlement, had brought that news himself to Abdulla\r\nwhose favour he courted.  But rumour also spoke of a fight and of Dain\'s\r\ndeath on board his own vessel.  And now all the settlement talked of\r\nDain\'s visit to the Rajah and of his death when crossing the river in the\r\ndark to see Almayer.\r\n\r\nThey could not understand this.  Reshid thought that it was very strange.\r\nHe felt uneasy and doubtful.  But Abdulla, after the first shock of\r\nsurprise, with the old age\'s dislike for solving riddles, showed a\r\nbecoming resignation.  He remarked that the man was dead now at all\r\nevents, and consequently no more dangerous.  Where was the use to wonder\r\nat the decrees of Fate, especially if they were propitious to the True\r\nBelievers?  And with a pious ejaculation to Allah the Merciful, the\r\nCompassionate, Abdulla seemed to regard the incident as closed for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nNot so Reshid.  He lingered by his uncle, pulling thoughtfully his neatly\r\ntrimmed beard.\r\n\r\n"There are many lies," he murmured.  "He has been dead once before, and\r\ncame to life to die again now.  The Dutch will be here before many days\r\nand clamour for the man.  Shall I not believe my eyes sooner than the\r\ntongues of women and idle men?"\r\n\r\n"They say that the body is being taken to Almayer\'s compound," said\r\nAbdulla.  "If you want to go there you must go before the Dutch arrive\r\nhere.  Go late.  It should not be said that we have been seen inside that\r\nman\'s enclosure lately."\r\n\r\nReshid assented to the truth of this last remark and left his uncle\'s\r\nside.  He leaned against the lintel of the big doorway and looked idly\r\nacross the courtyard through the open gate on to the main road of the\r\nsettlement.  It lay empty, straight, and yellow under the flood of light.\r\nIn the hot noontide the smooth trunks of palm trees, the outlines of the\r\nhouses, and away there at the other end of the road the roof of Almayer\'s\r\nhouse visible over the bushes on the dark background of forest, seemed to\r\nquiver in the heat radiating from the steaming earth.  Swarms of yellow\r\nbutterflies rose, and settled to rise again in short flights before\r\nReshid\'s half-closed eyes.  From under his feet arose the dull hum of\r\ninsects in the long grass of the courtyard.  He looked on sleepily.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the side paths amongst the houses a woman stepped out on the\r\nroad, a slight girlish figure walking under the shade of a large tray\r\nbalanced on its head.  The consciousness of something moving stirred\r\nReshid\'s half-sleeping senses into a comparative wakefulness.  He\r\nrecognised Taminah, Bulangi\'s slave-girl, with her tray of cakes for\r\nsale--an apparition of daily recurrence and of no importance whatever.\r\nShe was going towards Almayer\'s house.  She could be made useful.  He\r\nroused himself up and ran towards the gate calling out, "Taminah O!"  The\r\ngirl stopped, hesitated, and came back slowly.\r\n\r\nReshid waited, signing to her impatiently to come nearer.\r\n\r\nWhen near Reshid Taminah stood with downcast eyes.  Reshid looked at her\r\na while before he asked--\r\n\r\n"Are you going to Almayer\'s house?  They say in the settlement that Dain\r\nthe trader, he that was found drowned this morning, is lying in the white\r\nman\'s campong."\r\n\r\n"I have heard this talk," whispered Taminah; "and this morning by the\r\nriverside I saw the body.  Where it is now I do not know."\r\n\r\n"So you have seen it?" asked Reshid, eagerly.  "Is it Dain?  You have\r\nseen him many times.  You would know him."\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s lips quivered and she remained silent for a while, breathing\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n"I have seen him, not a long time ago," she said at last.  "The talk is\r\ntrue; he is dead.  What do you want from me, Tuan?  I must go."\r\n\r\nJust then the report of the gun fired on board the steam launch was\r\nheard, interrupting Reshid\'s reply.  Leaving the girl he ran to the\r\nhouse, and met in the courtyard Abdulla coming towards the gate.\r\n\r\n"The Orang Blanda are come," said Reshid, "and now we shall have our\r\nreward."\r\n\r\nAbdulla shook his head doubtfully.  "The white men\'s rewards are long in\r\ncoming," he said.  "White men are quick in anger and slow in gratitude.\r\nWe shall see."\r\n\r\nHe stood at the gate stroking his grey beard and listening to the distant\r\ncries of greeting at the other end of the settlement.  As Taminah was\r\nturning to go he called her back.\r\n\r\n"Listen, girl," he said: "there will be many white men in Almayer\'s\r\nhouse.  You shall be there selling your cakes to the men of the sea.  What\r\nyou see and what you hear you may tell me.  Come here before the sun sets\r\nand I will give you a blue handkerchief with red spots.  Now go, and\r\nforget not to return."\r\n\r\nHe gave her a push with the end of his long staff as she was going away\r\nand made her stumble.\r\n\r\n"This slave is very slow," he remarked to his nephew, looking after the\r\ngirl with great disfavour.\r\n\r\nTaminah walked on, her tray on the head, her eyes fixed on the ground.\r\nFrom the open doors of the houses were heard, as she passed, friendly\r\ncalls inviting her within for business purposes, but she never heeded\r\nthem, neglecting her sales in the preoccupation of intense thinking.\r\nSince the very early morning she had heard much, she had also seen much\r\nthat filled her heart with a joy mingled with great suffering and fear.\r\nBefore the dawn, before she left Bulangi\'s house to paddle up to Sambir\r\nshe had heard voices outside the house when all in it but herself were\r\nasleep.  And now, with her knowledge of the words spoken in the darkness,\r\nshe held in her hand a life and carried in her breast a great sorrow.  Yet\r\nfrom her springy step, erect figure, and face veiled over by the everyday\r\nlook of apathetic indifference, nobody could have guessed of the double\r\nload she carried under the visible burden of the tray piled up high with\r\ncakes manufactured by the thrifty hands of Bulangi\'s wives.  In that\r\nsupple figure straight as an arrow, so graceful and free in its walk,\r\nbehind those soft eyes that spoke of nothing but of unconscious\r\nresignation, there slept all feelings and all passions, all hopes and all\r\nfears, the curse of life and the consolation of death.  And she knew\r\nnothing of it all.  She lived like the tall palms amongst whom she was\r\npassing now, seeking the light, desiring the sunshine, fearing the storm,\r\nunconscious of either.  The slave had no hope, and knew of no change.  She\r\nknew of no other sky, no other water, no other forest, no other world, no\r\nother life.  She had no wish, no hope, no love, no fear except of a blow,\r\nand no vivid feeling but that of occasional hunger, which was seldom, for\r\nBulangi was rich and rice was plentiful in the solitary house in his\r\nclearing.  The absence of pain and hunger was her happiness, and when she\r\nfelt unhappy she was simply tired, more than usual, after the day\'s\r\nlabour.  Then in the hot nights of the south-west monsoon she slept\r\ndreamlessly under the bright stars on the platform built outside the\r\nhouse and over the river.  Inside they slept too: Bulangi by the door;\r\nhis wives further in; the children with their mothers.  She could hear\r\ntheir breathing; Bulangi\'s sleepy voice; the sharp cry of a child soon\r\nhushed with tender words.  And she closed her eyes to the murmur of the\r\nwater below her, to the whisper of the warm wind above, ignorant of the\r\nnever-ceasing life of that tropical nature that spoke to her in vain with\r\nthe thousand faint voices of the near forest, with the breath of tepid\r\nwind; in the heavy scents that lingered around her head; in the white\r\nwraiths of morning mist that hung over her in the solemn hush of all\r\ncreation before the dawn.\r\n\r\nSuch had been her existence before the coming of the brig with the\r\nstrangers.  She remembered well that time; the uproar in the settlement,\r\nthe never-ending wonder, the days and nights of talk and excitement.  She\r\nremembered her own timidity with the strange men, till the brig moored to\r\nthe bank became in a manner part of the settlement, and the fear wore off\r\nin the familiarity of constant intercourse.  The call on board then\r\nbecame part of her daily round.  She walked hesitatingly up the slanting\r\nplanks of the gangway amidst the encouraging shouts and more or less\r\ndecent jokes of the men idling over the bulwarks.  There she sold her\r\nwares to those men that spoke so loud and carried themselves so free.\r\nThere was a throng, a constant coming and going; calls interchanged,\r\norders given and executed with shouts; the rattle of blocks, the flinging\r\nabout of coils of rope.  She sat out of the way under the shade of the\r\nawning, with her tray before her, the veil drawn well over her face,\r\nfeeling shy amongst so many men.  She smiled at all buyers, but spoke to\r\nnone, letting their jests pass with stolid unconcern.  She heard many\r\ntales told around her of far-off countries, of strange customs, of events\r\nstranger still.  Those men were brave; but the most fearless of them\r\nspoke of their chief with fear.  Often the man they called their master\r\npassed before her, walking erect and indifferent, in the pride of youth,\r\nin the flash of rich dress, with a tinkle of gold ornaments, while\r\neverybody stood aside watching anxiously for a movement of his lips,\r\nready to do his bidding.  Then all her life seemed to rush into her eyes,\r\nand from under her veil she gazed at him, charmed, yet fearful to attract\r\nattention.  One day he noticed her and asked, "Who is that girl?"  "A\r\nslave, Tuan!  A girl that sells cakes," a dozen voices replied together.\r\nShe rose in terror to run on shore, when he called her back; and as she\r\nstood trembling with head hung down before him, he spoke kind words,\r\nlifting her chin with his hand and looking into her eyes with a smile.\r\n"Do not be afraid," he said.  He never spoke to her any more.  Somebody\r\ncalled out from the river bank; he turned away and forgot her existence.\r\nTaminah saw Almayer standing on the shore with Nina on his arm.  She\r\nheard Nina\'s voice calling out gaily, and saw Dain\'s face brighten with\r\njoy as he leaped on shore.  She hated the sound of that voice ever since.\r\n\r\nAfter that day she left off visiting Almayer\'s compound, and passed the\r\nnoon hours under the shade of the brig awning.  She watched for his\r\ncoming with heart beating quicker and quicker, as he approached, into a\r\nwild tumult of newly-aroused feelings of joy and hope and fear that died\r\naway with Dain\'s retreating figure, leaving her tired out, as if after a\r\nstruggle, sitting still for a long time in dreamy languor.  Then she\r\npaddled home slowly in the afternoon, often letting her canoe float with\r\nthe lazy stream in the quiet backwater of the river.  The paddle hung\r\nidle in the water as she sat in the stern, one hand supporting her chin,\r\nher eyes wide open, listening intently to the whispering of her heart\r\nthat seemed to swell at last into a song of extreme sweetness.  Listening\r\nto that song she husked the rice at home; it dulled her ears to the\r\nshrill bickerings of Bulangi\'s wives, to the sound of angry reproaches\r\naddressed to herself.  And when the sun was near its setting she walked\r\nto the bathing-place and heard it as she stood on the tender grass of the\r\nlow bank, her robe at her feet, and looked at the reflection of her\r\nfigure on the glass-like surface of the creek.  Listening to it she\r\nwalked slowly back, her wet hair hanging over her shoulders; laying down\r\nto rest under the bright stars, she closed her eyes to the murmur of the\r\nwater below, of the warm wind above; to the voice of nature speaking\r\nthrough the faint noises of the great forest, and to the song of her own\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nShe heard, but did not understand, and drank in the dreamy joy of her new\r\nexistence without troubling about its meaning or its end, till the full\r\nconsciousness of life came to her through pain and anger.  And she\r\nsuffered horribly the first time she saw Nina\'s long canoe drift silently\r\npast the sleeping house of Bulangi, bearing the two lovers into the white\r\nmist of the great river.  Her jealousy and rage culminated into a\r\nparoxysm of physical pain that left her lying panting on the river bank,\r\nin the dumb agony of a wounded animal.  But she went on moving patiently\r\nin the enchanted circle of slavery, going through her task day after day\r\nwith all the pathos of the grief she could not express, even to herself,\r\nlocked within her breast.  She shrank from Nina as she would have shrunk\r\nfrom the sharp blade of a knife cutting into her flesh, but she kept on\r\nvisiting the brig to feed her dumb, ignorant soul on her own despair.  She\r\nsaw Dain many times.  He never spoke, he never looked.  Could his eyes\r\nsee only one woman\'s image?  Could his ears hear only one woman\'s voice?\r\nHe never noticed her; not once.\r\n\r\nAnd then he went away.  She saw him and Nina for the last time on that\r\nmorning when Babalatchi, while visiting his fish baskets, had his\r\nsuspicions of the white man\'s daughter\'s love affair with Dain confirmed\r\nbeyond the shadow of doubt.  Dain disappeared, and Taminah\'s heart, where\r\nlay useless and barren the seeds of all love and of all hate, the\r\npossibilities of all passions and of all sacrifices, forgot its joys and\r\nits sufferings when deprived of the help of the senses.  Her half-formed,\r\nsavage mind, the slave of her body--as her body was the slave of\r\nanother\'s will--forgot the faint and vague image of the ideal that had\r\nfound its beginning in the physical promptings of her savage nature.  She\r\ndropped back into the torpor of her former life and found\r\nconsolation--even a certain kind of happiness--in the thought that now\r\nNina and Dain were separated, probably for ever.  He would forget.  This\r\nthought soothed the last pangs of dying jealousy that had nothing now to\r\nfeed upon, and Taminah found peace.  It was like the dreary tranquillity\r\nof a desert, where there is peace only because there is no life.\r\n\r\nAnd now he had returned.  She had recognised his voice calling aloud in\r\nthe night for Bulangi.  She had crept out after her master to listen\r\ncloser to the intoxicating sound.  Dain was there, in a boat, talking to\r\nBulangi.  Taminah, listening with arrested breath, heard another voice.\r\nThe maddening joy, that only a second before she thought herself\r\nincapable of containing within her fast-beating heart, died out, and left\r\nher shivering in the old anguish of physical pain that she had suffered\r\nonce before at the sight of Dain and Nina.  Nina spoke now, ordering and\r\nentreating in turns, and Bulangi was refusing, expostulating, at last\r\nconsenting.  He went in to take a paddle from the heap lying behind the\r\ndoor.  Outside the murmur of two voices went on, and she caught a word\r\nhere and there.  She understood that he was fleeing from white men, that\r\nhe was seeking a hiding-place, that he was in some danger.  But she heard\r\nalso words which woke the rage of jealousy that had been asleep for so\r\nmany days in her bosom.  Crouching low on the mud in the black darkness\r\namongst the piles, she heard the whisper in the boat that made light of\r\ntoil, of privation, of danger, of life itself, if in exchange there could\r\nbe but a short moment of close embrace, a look from the eyes, the feel of\r\nlight breath, the touch of soft lips.  So spoke Dain as he sat in the\r\ncanoe holding Nina\'s hands while waiting for Bulangi\'s return; and\r\nTaminah, supporting herself by the slimy pile, felt as if a heavy weight\r\nwas crushing her down, down into the black oily water at her feet.  She\r\nwanted to cry out; to rush at them and tear their vague shadows apart; to\r\nthrow Nina into the smooth water, cling to her close, hold her to the\r\nbottom where that man could not find her.  She could not cry, she could\r\nnot move.  Then footsteps were heard on the bamboo platform above her\r\nhead; she saw Bulangi get into his smallest canoe and take the lead, the\r\nother boat following, paddled by Dain and Nina.  With a slight splash of\r\nthe paddles dipped stealthily into the water, their indistinct forms\r\npassed before her aching eyes and vanished in the darkness of the creek.\r\n\r\nShe remained there in the cold and wet, powerless to move, breathing\r\npainfully under the crushing weight that the mysterious hand of Fate had\r\nlaid so suddenly upon her slender shoulders, and shivering, she felt\r\nwithin a burning fire, that seemed to feed upon her very life.  When the\r\nbreaking day had spread a pale golden ribbon over the black outline of\r\nthe forests, she took up her tray and departed towards the settlement,\r\ngoing about her task purely from the force of habit.  As she approached\r\nSambir she could see the excitement and she heard with momentary surprise\r\nof the finding of Dain\'s body.  It was not true, of course.  She knew it\r\nwell.  She regretted that he was not dead.  She should have liked Dain to\r\nbe dead, so as to be parted from that woman--from all women.  She felt a\r\nstrong desire to see Nina, but without any clear object.  She hated her,\r\nand feared her and she felt an irresistible impulse pushing her towards\r\nAlmayer\'s house to see the white woman\'s face, to look close at those\r\neyes, to hear again that voice, for the sound of which Dain was ready to\r\nrisk his liberty, his life even.  She had seen her many times; she had\r\nheard her voice daily for many months past.  What was there in her?  What\r\nwas there in that being to make a man speak as Dain had spoken, to make\r\nhim blind to all other faces, deaf to all other voices?\r\n\r\nShe left the crowd by the riverside, and wandered aimlessly among the\r\nempty houses, resisting the impulse that pushed her towards Almayer\'s\r\ncampong to seek there in Nina\'s eyes the secret of her own misery.  The\r\nsun mounting higher, shortened the shadows and poured down upon her a\r\nflood of light and of stifling heat as she passed on from shadow to\r\nlight, from light to shadow, amongst the houses, the bushes, the tall\r\ntrees, in her unconscious flight from the pain in her own heart.  In the\r\nextremity of her distress she could find no words to pray for relief, she\r\nknew of no heaven to send her prayer to, and she wandered on with tired\r\nfeet in the dumb surprise and terror at the injustice of the suffering\r\ninflicted upon her without cause and without redress.\r\n\r\nThe short talk with Reshid, the proposal of Abdulla steadied her a little\r\nand turned her thoughts into another channel.  Dain was in some danger.\r\nHe was hiding from white men.  So much she had overheard last night.  They\r\nall thought him dead.  She knew he was alive, and she knew of his hiding-\r\nplace.  What did the Arabs want to know about the white men?  The white\r\nmen want with Dain?  Did they wish to kill him?  She could tell them\r\nall--no, she would say nothing, and in the night she would go to him and\r\nsell him his life for a word, for a smile, for a gesture even, and be his\r\nslave in far-off countries, away from Nina.  But there were dangers.  The\r\none-eyed Babalatchi who knew everything; the white man\'s wife--she was a\r\nwitch.  Perhaps they would tell.  And then there was Nina.  She must\r\nhurry on and see.\r\n\r\nIn her impatience she left the path and ran towards Almayer\'s dwelling\r\nthrough the undergrowth between the palm trees.  She came out at the back\r\nof the house, where a narrow ditch, full of stagnant water that\r\noverflowed from the river, separated Almayer\'s campong from the rest of\r\nthe settlement.  The thick bushes growing on the bank were hiding from\r\nher sight the large courtyard with its cooking shed.  Above them rose\r\nseveral thin columns of smoke, and from behind the sound of strange\r\nvoices informed Taminah that the Men of the Sea belonging to the warship\r\nhad already landed and were camped between the ditch and the house.  To\r\nthe left one of Almayer\'s slave-girls came down to the ditch and bent\r\nover the shiny water, washing a kettle.  To the right the tops of the\r\nbanana plantation, visible above the bushes, swayed and shook under the\r\ntouch of invisible hands gathering the fruit.  On the calm water several\r\ncanoes moored to a heavy stake were crowded together, nearly bridging the\r\nditch just at the place where Taminah stood.  The voices in the courtyard\r\nrose at times into an outburst of calls, replies, and laughter, and then\r\ndied away into a silence that soon was broken again by a fresh clamour.\r\nNow and again the thin blue smoke rushed out thicker and blacker, and\r\ndrove in odorous masses over the creek, wrapping her for a moment in a\r\nsuffocating veil; then, as the fresh wood caught well alight, the smoke\r\nvanished in the bright sunlight, and only the scent of aromatic wood\r\ndrifted afar, to leeward of the crackling fires.\r\n\r\nTaminah rested her tray on a stump of a tree, and remained standing with\r\nher eyes turned towards Almayer\'s house, whose roof and part of a\r\nwhitewashed wall were visible over the bushes.  The slave-girl finished\r\nher work, and after looking for a while curiously at Taminah, pushed her\r\nway through the dense thicket back to the courtyard.  Round Taminah there\r\nwas now a complete solitude.  She threw herself down on the ground, and\r\nhid her face in her hands.  Now when so close she had no courage to see\r\nNina.  At every burst of louder voices from the courtyard she shivered in\r\nthe fear of hearing Nina\'s voice.  She came to the resolution of waiting\r\nwhere she was till dark, and then going straight to Dain\'s hiding-place.\r\nFrom where she was she could watch the movements of white men, of Nina,\r\nof all Dain\'s friends, and of all his enemies.  Both were hateful alike\r\nto her, for both would take him away beyond her reach.  She hid herself\r\nin the long grass to wait anxiously for the sunset that seemed so slow to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the ditch, behind the bush, by the clear fires, the\r\nseamen of the frigate had encamped on the hospitable invitation of\r\nAlmayer.  Almayer, roused out of his apathy by the prayers and\r\nimportunity of Nina, had managed to get down in time to the jetty so as\r\nto receive the officers at their landing.  The lieutenant in command\r\naccepted his invitation to his house with the remark that in any case\r\ntheir business was with Almayer--and perhaps not very pleasant, he added.\r\nAlmayer hardly heard him.  He shook hands with them absently and led the\r\nway towards the house.  He was scarcely conscious of the polite words of\r\nwelcome he greeted the strangers with, and afterwards repeated several\r\ntimes over again in his efforts to appear at ease.  The agitation of\r\ntheir host did not escape the officer\'s eyes, and the chief confided to\r\nhis subordinate, in a low voice, his doubts as to Almayer\'s sobriety.  The\r\nyoung sub-lieutenant laughed and expressed in a whisper the hope that the\r\nwhite man was not intoxicated enough to neglect the offer of some\r\nrefreshments.  "He does not seem very dangerous," he added, as they\r\nfollowed Almayer up the steps of the verandah.\r\n\r\n"No, he seems more of a fool than a knave; I have heard of him," returned\r\nthe senior.\r\n\r\nThey sat around the table.  Almayer with shaking hands made gin\r\ncocktails, offered them all round, and drank himself, with every gulp\r\nfeeling stronger, steadier, and better able to face all the difficulties\r\nof his position.  Ignorant of the fate of the brig he did not suspect the\r\nreal object of the officer\'s visit.  He had a general notion that\r\nsomething must have leaked out about the gunpowder trade, but apprehended\r\nnothing beyond some temporary inconveniences.  After emptying his glass\r\nhe began to chat easily, lying back in his chair with one of his legs\r\nthrown negligently over the arm.  The lieutenant astride on his chair, a\r\nglowing cheroot in the corner of his mouth, listened with a sly smile\r\nfrom behind the thick volumes of smoke that escaped from his compressed\r\nlips.  The young sub-lieutenant, leaning with both elbows on the table,\r\nhis head between his hands, looked on sleepily in the torpor induced by\r\nfatigue and the gin.  Almayer talked on--\r\n\r\n"It is a great pleasure to see white faces here.  I have lived here many\r\nyears in great solitude.  The Malays, you understand, are not company for\r\na white man; moreover they are not friendly; they do not understand our\r\nways.  Great rascals they are.  I believe I am the only white man on the\r\neast coast that is a settled resident.  We get visitors from Macassar or\r\nSingapore sometimes--traders, agents, or explorers, but they are rare.\r\nThere was a scientific explorer here a year or more ago.  He lived in my\r\nhouse: drank from morning to night.  He lived joyously for a few months,\r\nand when the liquor he brought with him was gone he returned to Batavia\r\nwith a report on the mineral wealth of the interior.  Ha, ha, ha!  Good,\r\nis it not?"\r\n\r\nHe ceased abruptly and looked at his guests with a meaningless stare.\r\nWhile they laughed he was reciting to himself the old story: "Dain dead,\r\nall my plans destroyed.  This is the end of all hope and of all things."\r\nHis heart sank within him.  He felt a kind of deadly sickness.\r\n\r\n"Very good.  Capital!" exclaimed both officers.  Almayer came out of his\r\ndespondency with another burst of talk.\r\n\r\n"Eh! what about the dinner?  You have got a cook with you.  That\'s all\r\nright.  There is a cooking shed in the other courtyard.  I can give you a\r\ngoose.  Look at my geese--the only geese on the east coast--perhaps on\r\nthe whole island.  Is that your cook?  Very good.  Here, Ali, show this\r\nChinaman the cooking place and tell Mem Almayer to let him have room\r\nthere.  My wife, gentlemen, does not come out; my daughter may.  Meantime\r\nhave some more drink.  It is a hot day."\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant took the cigar out of his mouth, looked at the ash\r\ncritically, shook it off and turned towards Almayer.\r\n\r\n"We have a rather unpleasant business with you," he said.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry," returned Almayer.  "It can be nothing very serious,\r\nsurely."\r\n\r\n"If you think an attempt to blow up forty men at least, not a serious\r\nmatter you will not find many people of your opinion," retorted the\r\nofficer sharply.\r\n\r\n"Blow up!  What?  I know nothing about it," exclaimed Almayer.  "Who did\r\nthat, or tried to do it?"\r\n\r\n"A man with whom you had some dealings," answered the lieutenant.  "He\r\npassed here under the name of Dain Maroola.  You sold him the gunpowder\r\nhe had in that brig we captured."\r\n\r\n"How did you hear about the brig?" asked Almayer.  "I know nothing about\r\nthe powder he may have had."\r\n\r\n"An Arab trader of this place has sent the information about your goings\r\non here to Batavia, a couple of months ago," said the officer.  "We were\r\nwaiting for the brig outside, but he slipped past us at the mouth of the\r\nriver, and we had to chase the fellow to the southward.  When he sighted\r\nus he ran inside the reefs and put the brig ashore.  The crew escaped in\r\nboats before we could take possession.  As our boats neared the craft it\r\nblew up with a tremendous explosion; one of the boats being too near got\r\nswamped.  Two men drowned--that is the result of your speculation, Mr.\r\nAlmayer.  Now we want this Dain.  We have good grounds to suppose he is\r\nhiding in Sambir.  Do you know where he is?  You had better put yourself\r\nright with the authorities as much as possible by being perfectly frank\r\nwith me.  Where is this Dain?"\r\n\r\nAlmayer got up and walked towards the balustrade of the verandah.  He\r\nseemed not to be thinking of the officer\'s question.  He looked at the\r\nbody laying straight and rigid under its white cover on which the sun,\r\ndeclining amongst the clouds to the westward, threw a pale tinge of red.\r\nThe lieutenant waited for the answer, taking quick pulls at his\r\nhalf-extinguished cigar.  Behind them Ali moved noiselessly laying the\r\ntable, ranging solemnly the ill-assorted and shabby crockery, the tin\r\nspoons, the forks with broken prongs, and the knives with saw-like blades\r\nand loose handles.  He had almost forgotten how to prepare the table for\r\nwhite men.  He felt aggrieved; Mem Nina would not help him.  He stepped\r\nback to look at his work admiringly, feeling very proud.  This must be\r\nright; and if the master afterwards is angry and swears, then so much the\r\nworse for Mem Nina.  Why did she not help?  He left the verandah to fetch\r\nthe dinner.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Almayer, will you answer my question as frankly as it is put\r\nto you?" asked the lieutenant, after a long silence.\r\n\r\nAlmayer turned round and looked at his interlocutor steadily.  "If you\r\ncatch this Dain what will you do with him?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe officer\'s face flushed.  "This is not an answer," he said, annoyed.\r\n\r\n"And what will you do with me?" went on Almayer, not heeding the\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n"Are you inclined to bargain?" growled the other.  "It would be bad\r\npolicy, I assure you.  At present I have no orders about your person, but\r\nwe expected your assistance in catching this Malay."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" interrupted Almayer, "just so: you can do nothing without me, and\r\nI, knowing the man well, am to help you in finding him."\r\n\r\n"This is exactly what we expect," assented the officer.  "You have broken\r\nthe law, Mr. Almayer, and you ought to make amends."\r\n\r\n"And save myself?"\r\n\r\n"Well, in a sense yes.  Your head is not in any danger," said the\r\nlieutenant, with a short laugh.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Almayer, with decision, "I shall deliver the man up to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nBoth officers rose to their feet quickly, and looked for their side-arms\r\nwhich they had unbuckled.  Almayer laughed harshly.\r\n\r\n"Steady, gentlemen!" he exclaimed.  "In my own time and in my own way.\r\nAfter dinner, gentlemen, you shall have him."\r\n\r\n"This is preposterous," urged the lieutenant.  "Mr. Almayer, this is no\r\njoking matter.  The man is a criminal.  He deserves to hang.  While we\r\ndine he may escape; the rumour of our arrival--"\r\n\r\nAlmayer walked towards the table.  "I give you my word of honour,\r\ngentlemen, that he shall not escape; I have him safe enough."\r\n\r\n"The arrest should be effected before dark," remarked the young sub.\r\n\r\n"I shall hold you responsible for any failure.  We are ready, but can do\r\nnothing just now without you," added the senior, with evident annoyance.\r\n\r\nAlmayer made a gesture of assent.  "On my word of honour," he repeated\r\nvaguely.  "And now let us dine," he added briskly.\r\n\r\nNina came through the doorway and stood for a moment holding the curtain\r\naside for Ali and the old Malay woman bearing the dishes; then she moved\r\ntowards the three men by the table.\r\n\r\n"Allow me," said Almayer, pompously.  "This is my daughter.  Nina, these\r\ngentlemen, officers of the frigate outside, have done me the honour to\r\naccept my hospitality."\r\n\r\nNina answered the low bows of the two officers by a slow inclination of\r\nthe head and took her place at the table opposite her father.  All sat\r\ndown.  The coxswain of the steam launch came up carrying some bottles of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n"You will allow me to have this put upon the table?" said the lieutenant\r\nto Almayer.\r\n\r\n"What!  Wine!  You are very kind.  Certainly, I have none myself.  Times\r\nare very hard."\r\n\r\nThe last words of his reply were spoken by Almayer in a faltering voice.\r\nThe thought that Dain was dead recurred to him vividly again, and he felt\r\nas if an invisible hand was gripping his throat.  He reached for the gin\r\nbottle while they were uncorking the wine and swallowed a big gulp.  The\r\nlieutenant, who was speaking to Nina, gave him a quick glance.  The young\r\nsub began to recover from the astonishment and confusion caused by Nina\'s\r\nunexpected appearance and great beauty.  "She was very beautiful and\r\nimposing," he reflected, "but after all a half-caste girl."  This thought\r\ncaused him to pluck up heart and look at Nina sideways.  Nina, with\r\ncomposed face, was answering in a low, even voice the elder officer\'s\r\npolite questions as to the country and her mode of life.  Almayer pushed\r\nhis plate away and drank his guest\'s wine in gloomy silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Can I believe what you tell me?  It is like a tale for men that listen\r\nonly half awake by the camp fire, and it seems to have run off a woman\'s\r\ntongue."\r\n\r\n"Who is there here for me to deceive, O Rajah?" answered Babalatchi.\r\n"Without you I am nothing.  All I have told you I believe to be true.  I\r\nhave been safe for many years in the hollow of your hand.  This is no\r\ntime to harbour suspicions.  The danger is very great.  We should advise\r\nand act at once, before the sun sets."\r\n\r\n"Right.  Right," muttered Lakamba, pensively.\r\n\r\nThey had been sitting for the last hour together in the audience chamber\r\nof the Rajah\'s house, for Babalatchi, as soon as he had witnessed the\r\nlanding of the Dutch officers, had crossed the river to report to his\r\nmaster the events of the morning, and to confer with him upon the line of\r\nconduct to pursue in the face of altered circumstances.  They were both\r\npuzzled and frightened by the unexpected turn the events had taken.  The\r\nRajah, sitting crosslegged on his chair, looked fixedly at the floor;\r\nBabalatchi was squatting close by in an attitude of deep dejection.\r\n\r\n"And where did you say he is hiding now?" asked Lakamba, breaking at last\r\nthe silence full of gloomy forebodings in which they both had been lost\r\nfor a long while.\r\n\r\n"In Bulangi\'s clearing--the furthest one, away from the house.  They went\r\nthere that very night.  The white man\'s daughter took him there.  She\r\ntold me so herself, speaking to me openly, for she is half white and has\r\nno decency.  She said she was waiting for him while he was here; then,\r\nafter a long time, he came out of the darkness and fell at her feet\r\nexhausted.  He lay like one dead, but she brought him back to life in her\r\narms, and made him breathe again with her own breath.  That is what she\r\nsaid, speaking to my face, as I am speaking now to you, Rajah.  She is\r\nlike a white woman and knows no shame."\r\n\r\nHe paused, deeply shocked.  Lakamba nodded his head.  "Well, and then?"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n"They called the old woman," went on Babalatchi, "and he told them\r\nall--about the brig, and how he tried to kill many men.  He knew the\r\nOrang Blanda were very near, although he had said nothing to us about\r\nthat; he knew his great danger.  He thought he had killed many, but there\r\nwere only two dead, as I have heard from the men of the sea that came in\r\nthe warship\'s boats."\r\n\r\n"And the other man, he that was found in the river?" interrupted Lakamba.\r\n\r\n"That was one of his boatmen.  When his canoe was overturned by the logs\r\nthose two swam together, but the other man must have been hurt.  Dain\r\nswam, holding him up.  He left him in the bushes when he went up to the\r\nhouse.  When they all came down his heart had ceased to beat; then the\r\nold woman spoke; Dain thought it was good.  He took off his anklet and\r\nbroke it, twisting it round the man\'s foot.  His ring he put on that\r\nslave\'s hand.  He took off his sarong and clothed that thing that wanted\r\nno clothes, the two women holding it up meanwhile, their intent being to\r\ndeceive all eyes and to mislead the minds in the settlement, so that they\r\ncould swear to the thing that was not, and that there could be no\r\ntreachery when the white-men came.  Then Dain and the white woman\r\ndeparted to call up Bulangi and find a hiding-place.  The old woman\r\nremained by the body."\r\n\r\n"Hai!" exclaimed Lakamba.  "She has wisdom."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she has a Devil of her own to whisper counsel in her ear," assented\r\nBabalatchi.  "She dragged the body with great toil to the point where\r\nmany logs were stranded.  All these things were done in the darkness\r\nafter the storm had passed away.  Then she waited.  At the first sign of\r\ndaylight she battered the face of the dead with a heavy stone, and she\r\npushed him amongst the logs.  She remained near, watching.  At sunrise\r\nMahmat Banjer came and found him.  They all believed; I myself was\r\ndeceived, but not for long.  The white man believed, and, grieving, fled\r\nto his house.  When we were alone I, having doubts, spoke to the woman,\r\nand she, fearing my anger and your might, told me all, asking for help in\r\nsaving Dain."\r\n\r\n"He must not fall into the hands of the Orang Blanda," said Lakamba; "but\r\nlet him die, if the thing can be done quietly."\r\n\r\n"It cannot, Tuan!  Remember there is that woman who, being half white, is\r\nungovernable, and would raise a great outcry.  Also the officers are\r\nhere.  They are angry enough already.  Dain must escape; he must go.  We\r\nmust help him now for our own safety."\r\n\r\n"Are the officers very angry?" inquired Lakamba, with interest.\r\n\r\n"They are.  The principal chief used strong words when speaking to me--to\r\nme when I salaamed in your name.  I do not think," added Babalatchi,\r\nafter a short pause and looking very worried--"I do not think I saw a\r\nwhite chief so angry before.  He said we were careless or even worse.  He\r\ntold me he would speak to the Rajah, and that I was of no account."\r\n\r\n"Speak to the Rajah!" repeated Lakamba, thoughtfully.  "Listen,\r\nBabalatchi: I am sick, and shall withdraw; you cross over and tell the\r\nwhite men."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Babalatchi, "I am going over at once; and as to Dain?"\r\n\r\n"You get him away as you can best.  This is a great trouble in my heart,"\r\nsighed Lakamba.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi got up, and, going close to his master, spoke earnestly.\r\n\r\n"There is one of our praus at the southern mouth of the river.  The Dutch\r\nwarship is to the northward watching the main entrance.  I shall send\r\nDain off to-night in a canoe, by the hidden channels, on board the prau.\r\nHis father is a great prince, and shall hear of our generosity.  Let the\r\nprau take him to Ampanam.  Your glory shall be great, and your reward in\r\npowerful friendship.  Almayer will no doubt deliver the dead body as\r\nDain\'s to the officers, and the foolish white men shall say, \'This is\r\nvery good; let there be peace.\'  And the trouble shall be removed from\r\nyour heart, Rajah."\r\n\r\n"True! true!" said Lakamba.\r\n\r\n"And, this being accomplished by me who am your slave, you shall reward\r\nwith a generous hand.  That I know!  The white man is grieving for the\r\nlost treasure, in the manner of white men who thirst after dollars.  Now,\r\nwhen all other things are in order, we shall perhaps obtain the treasure\r\nfrom the white man.  Dain must escape, and Almayer must live."\r\n\r\n"Now go, Babalatchi, go!" said Lakamba, getting off his chair.  "I am\r\nvery sick, and want medicine.  Tell the white chief so."\r\n\r\nBut Babalatchi was not to be got rid of in this summary manner.  He knew\r\nthat his master, after the manner of the great, liked to shift the burden\r\nof toil and danger on to his servants\' shoulders, but in the difficult\r\nstraits in which they were now the Rajah must play his part.  He may be\r\nvery sick for the white men, for all the world if he liked, as long as he\r\nwould take upon himself the execution of part at least of Babalatchi\'s\r\ncarefully thought-of plan.  Babalatchi wanted a big canoe manned by\r\ntwelve men to be sent out after dark towards Bulangi\'s clearing.  Dain\r\nmay have to be overpowered.  A man in love cannot be expected to see\r\nclearly the path of safety if it leads him away from the object of his\r\naffections, argued Babalatchi, and in that case they would have to use\r\nforce in order to make him go.  Would the Rajah see that trusty men\r\nmanned the canoe?  The thing must be done secretly.  Perhaps the Rajah\r\nwould come himself, so as to bring all the weight of his authority to\r\nbear upon Dain if he should prove obstinate and refuse to leave his\r\nhiding-place.  The Rajah would not commit himself to a definite promise,\r\nand anxiously pressed Babalatchi to go, being afraid of the white men\r\npaying him an unexpected visit.  The aged statesman reluctantly took his\r\nleave and went into the courtyard.\r\n\r\nBefore going down to his boat Babalatchi stopped for a while in the big\r\nopen space where the thick-leaved trees put black patches of shadow which\r\nseemed to float on a flood of smooth, intense light that rolled up to the\r\nhouses and down to the stockade and over the river, where it broke and\r\nsparkled in thousands of glittering wavelets, like a band woven of azure\r\nand gold edged with the brilliant green of the forests guarding both\r\nbanks of the Pantai.  In the perfect calm before the coming of the\r\nafternoon breeze the irregularly jagged line of tree-tops stood\r\nunchanging, as if traced by an unsteady hand on the clear blue of the hot\r\nsky.  In the space sheltered by the high palisades there lingered the\r\nsmell of decaying blossoms from the surrounding forest, a taint of drying\r\nfish; with now and then a whiff of acrid smoke from the cooking fires\r\nwhen it eddied down from under the leafy boughs and clung lazily about\r\nthe burnt-up grass.\r\n\r\nAs Babalatchi looked up at the flagstaff over-topping a group of low\r\ntrees in the middle of the courtyard, the tricolour flag of the\r\nNetherlands stirred slightly for the first time since it had been hoisted\r\nthat morning on the arrival of the man-of-war boats.  With a faint rustle\r\nof trees the breeze came down in light puffs, playing capriciously for a\r\ntime with this emblem of Lakamba\'s power, that was also the mark of his\r\nservitude; then the breeze freshened in a sharp gust of wind, and the\r\nflag flew out straight and steady above the trees.  A dark shadow ran\r\nalong the river, rolling over and covering up the sparkle of declining\r\nsunlight.  A big white cloud sailed slowly across the darkening sky, and\r\nhung to the westward as if waiting for the sun to join it there.  Men and\r\nthings shook off the torpor of the hot afternoon and stirred into life\r\nunder the first breath of the sea breeze.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi hurried down to the water-gate; yet before he passed through\r\nit he paused to look round the courtyard, with its light and shade, with\r\nits cheery fires, with the groups of Lakamba\'s soldiers and retainers\r\nscattered about.  His own house stood amongst the other buildings in that\r\nenclosure, and the statesman of Sambir asked himself with a sinking heart\r\nwhen and how would it be given him to return to that house.  He had to\r\ndeal with a man more dangerous than any wild beast of his experience: a\r\nproud man, a man wilful after the manner of princes, a man in love.  And\r\nhe was going forth to speak to that man words of cold and worldly wisdom.\r\nCould anything be more appalling?  What if that man should take umbrage\r\nat some fancied slight to his honour or disregard of his affections and\r\nsuddenly "amok"?  The wise adviser would be the first victim, no doubt,\r\nand death would be his reward.  And underlying the horror of this\r\nsituation there was the danger of those meddlesome fools, the white men.\r\nA vision of comfortless exile in far-off Madura rose up before\r\nBabalatchi.  Wouldn\'t that be worse than death itself?  And there was\r\nthat half-white woman with threatening eyes.  How could he tell what an\r\nincomprehensible creature of that sort would or would not do?  She knew\r\nso much that she made the killing of Dain an impossibility.  That much\r\nwas certain.  And yet the sharp, rough-edged kriss is a good and discreet\r\nfriend, thought Babalatchi, as he examined his own lovingly, and put it\r\nback in the sheath, with a sigh of regret, before unfastening his canoe.\r\nAs he cast off the painter, pushed out into the stream, and took up his\r\npaddle, he realised vividly how unsatisfactory it was to have women mixed\r\nup in state affairs.  Young women, of course.  For Mrs. Almayer\'s mature\r\nwisdom, and for the easy aptitude in intrigue that comes with years to\r\nthe feminine mind, he felt the most sincere respect.\r\n\r\nHe paddled leisurely, letting the canoe drift down as he crossed towards\r\nthe point.  The sun was high yet, and nothing pressed.  His work would\r\ncommence only with the coming of darkness.  Avoiding the Lingard jetty,\r\nhe rounded the point, and paddled up the creek at the back of Almayer\'s\r\nhouse.  There were many canoes lying there, their noses all drawn\r\ntogether, fastened all to the same stake.  Babalatchi pushed his little\r\ncraft in amongst them and stepped on shore.  On the other side of the\r\nditch something moved in the grass.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that hiding?" hailed Babalatchi.  "Come out and speak to me."\r\n\r\nNobody answered.  Babalatchi crossed over, passing from boat to boat, and\r\npoked his staff viciously in the suspicious place.  Taminah jumped up\r\nwith a cry.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here?" he asked, surprised.  "I have nearly stepped\r\non your tray.  Am I a Dyak that you should hide at my sight?"\r\n\r\n"I was weary, and--I slept," whispered Taminah, confusedly.\r\n\r\n"You slept!  You have not sold anything to-day, and you will be beaten\r\nwhen you return home," said Babalatchi.\r\n\r\nTaminah stood before him abashed and silent.  Babalatchi looked her over\r\ncarefully with great satisfaction.  Decidedly he would offer fifty\r\ndollars more to that thief Bulangi.  The girl pleased him.\r\n\r\n"Now you go home.  It is late," he said sharply.  "Tell Bulangi that I\r\nshall be near his house before the night is half over, and that I want\r\nhim to make all things ready for a long journey.  You understand?  A long\r\njourney to the southward.  Tell him that before sunset, and do not forget\r\nmy words."\r\n\r\nTaminah made a gesture of assent, and watched Babalatchi recross the\r\nditch and disappear through the bushes bordering Almayer\'s compound.  She\r\nmoved a little further off the creek and sank in the grass again, lying\r\ndown on her face, shivering in dry-eyed misery.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi walked straight towards the cooking-shed looking for Mrs.\r\nAlmayer.  The courtyard was in a great uproar.  A strange Chinaman had\r\npossession of the kitchen fire and was noisily demanding another\r\nsaucepan.  He hurled objurgations, in the Canton dialect and bad Malay,\r\nagainst the group of slave-girls standing a little way off, half\r\nfrightened, half amused, at his violence.  From the camping fires round\r\nwhich the seamen of the frigate were sitting came words of encouragement,\r\nmingled with laughter and jeering.  In the midst of this noise and\r\nconfusion Babalatchi met Ali, an empty dish in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Where are the white men?" asked Babalatchi.\r\n\r\n"They are eating in the front verandah," answered Ali.  "Do not stop me,\r\nTuan.  I am giving the white men their food and am busy."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Mem Almayer?"\r\n\r\n"Inside in the passage.  She is listening to the talk."\r\n\r\nAli grinned and passed on; Babalatchi ascended the plankway to the rear\r\nverandah, and beckoning out Mrs. Almayer, engaged her in earnest\r\nconversation.  Through the long passage, closed at the further end by the\r\nred curtain, they could hear from time to time Almayer\'s voice mingling\r\nin conversation with an abrupt loudness that made Mrs. Almayer look\r\nsignificantly at Babalatchi.\r\n\r\n"Listen," she said.  "He has drunk much."\r\n\r\n"He has," whispered Babalatchi.  "He will sleep heavily to-night."\r\n\r\nMrs. Almayer looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes the devil of strong gin makes him keep awake, and he walks up\r\nand down the verandah all night, cursing; then we stand afar off,"\r\nexplained Mrs. Almayer, with the fuller knowledge born of twenty odd\r\nyears of married life.\r\n\r\n"But then he does not hear, nor understand, and his hand, of course, has\r\nno strength.  We do not want him to hear to-night."\r\n\r\n"No," assented Mrs. Almayer, energetically, but in a cautiously subdued\r\nvoice.  "If he hears he will kill."\r\n\r\nBabalatchi looked incredulous.\r\n\r\n"Hai Tuan, you may believe me.  Have I not lived many years with that\r\nman?  Have I not seen death in that man\'s eyes more than once when I was\r\nyounger and he guessed at many things.  Had he been a man of my own\r\npeople I would not have seen such a look twice; but he--"\r\n\r\nWith a contemptuous gesture she seemed to fling unutterable scorn on\r\nAlmayer\'s weak-minded aversion to sudden bloodshed.\r\n\r\n"If he has the wish but not the strength, then what do we fear?" asked\r\nBabalatchi, after a short silence during which they both listened to\r\nAlmayer\'s loud talk till it subsided into the murmur of general\r\nconversation.  "What do we fear?" repeated Babalatchi again.\r\n\r\n"To keep the daughter whom he loves he would strike into your heart and\r\nmine without hesitation," said Mrs. Almayer.  "When the girl is gone he\r\nwill be like the devil unchained.  Then you and I had better beware."\r\n\r\n"I am an old man and fear not death," answered Babalatchi, with a\r\nmendacious assumption of indifference.  "But what will you do?"\r\n\r\n"I am an old woman, and wish to live," retorted Mrs. Almayer.  "She is my\r\ndaughter also.  I shall seek safety at the feet of our Rajah, speaking in\r\nthe name of the past when we both were young, and he--"\r\n\r\nBabalatchi raised his hand.\r\n\r\n"Enough.  You shall be protected," he said soothingly.\r\n\r\nAgain the sound of Almayer\'s voice was heard, and again interrupting\r\ntheir talk, they listened to the confused but loud utterance coming in\r\nbursts of unequal strength, with unexpected pauses and noisy repetitions\r\nthat made some words and sentences fall clear and distinct on their ears\r\nout of the meaningless jumble of excited shoutings emphasised by the\r\nthumping of Almayer\'s fist upon the table.  On the short intervals of\r\nsilence, the high complaining note of tumblers, standing close together\r\nand vibrating to the shock, lingered, growing fainter, till it leapt up\r\nagain into tumultuous ringing, when a new idea started a new rush of\r\nwords and brought down the heavy hand again.  At last the quarrelsome\r\nshouting ceased, and the thin plaint of disturbed glass died away into\r\nreluctant quietude.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi and Mrs. Almayer had listened curiously, their bodies bent and\r\ntheir ears turned towards the passage.  At every louder shout they nodded\r\nat each other with a ridiculous affectation of scandalised propriety, and\r\nthey remained in the same attitude for some time after the noise had\r\nceased.\r\n\r\n"This is the devil of gin," whispered Mrs. Almayer.  "Yes; he talks like\r\nthat sometimes when there is nobody to hear him."\r\n\r\n"What does he say?" inquired Babalatchi, eagerly.  "You ought to\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\n"I have forgotten their talk.  A little I understood.  He spoke without\r\nany respect of the white ruler in Batavia, and of protection, and said he\r\nhad been wronged; he said that several times.  More I did not understand.\r\nListen!  Again he speaks!"\r\n\r\n"Tse! tse! tse!" clicked Babalatchi, trying to appear shocked, but with a\r\njoyous twinkle of his solitary eye.  "There will be great trouble between\r\nthose white men.  I will go round now and see.  You tell your daughter\r\nthat there is a sudden and a long journey before her, with much glory and\r\nsplendour at the end.  And tell her that Dain must go, or he must die,\r\nand that he will not go alone."\r\n\r\n"No, he will not go alone," slowly repeated Mrs. Almayer, with a\r\nthoughtful air, as she crept into the passage after seeing Babalatchi\r\ndisappear round the corner of the house.\r\n\r\nThe statesman of Sambir, under the impulse of vivid curiosity, made his\r\nway quickly to the front of the house, but once there he moved slowly and\r\ncautiously as he crept step by step up the stairs of the verandah.  On\r\nthe highest step he sat down quietly, his feet on the steps below, ready\r\nfor flight should his presence prove unwelcome.  He felt pretty safe so.\r\nThe table stood nearly endways to him, and he saw Almayer\'s back; at Nina\r\nhe looked full face, and had a side view of both officers; but of the\r\nfour persons sitting at the table only Nina and the younger officer\r\nnoticed his noiseless arrival.  The momentary dropping of Nina\'s eyelids\r\nacknowledged Babalatchi\'s presence; she then spoke at once to the young\r\nsub, who turned towards her with attentive alacrity, but her gaze was\r\nfastened steadily on her father\'s face while Almayer was speaking\r\nuproariously.\r\n\r\n" . . . disloyalty and unscrupulousness!  What have you ever done to make\r\nme loyal?  You have no grip on this country.  I had to take care of\r\nmyself, and when I asked for protection I was met with threats and\r\ncontempt, and had Arab slander thrown in my face.  I! a white man!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be violent, Almayer," remonstrated the lieutenant; "I have heard\r\nall this already."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you talk to me about scruples?  I wanted money, and I gave\r\npowder in exchange.  How could I know that some of your wretched men were\r\ngoing to be blown up?  Scruples!  Pah!"\r\n\r\nHe groped unsteadily amongst the bottles, trying one after another,\r\ngrumbling to himself the while.\r\n\r\n"No more wine," he muttered discontentedly.\r\n\r\n"You have had enough, Almayer," said the lieutenant, as he lighted a\r\ncigar.  "Is it not time to deliver to us your prisoner?  I take it you\r\nhave that Dain Maroola stowed away safely somewhere.  Still we had better\r\nget that business over, and then we shall have more drink.  Come! don\'t\r\nlook at me like this."\r\n\r\nAlmayer was staring with stony eyes, his trembling fingers fumbling about\r\nhis throat.\r\n\r\n"Gold," he said with difficulty.  "Hem!  A hand on the windpipe, you\r\nknow.  Sure you will excuse.  I wanted to say--a little gold for a little\r\npowder.  What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"I know, I know," said the lieutenant soothingly.\r\n\r\n"No!  You don\'t know.  Not one of you knows!" shouted Almayer.  "The\r\ngovernment is a fool, I tell you.  Heaps of gold.  I am the man that\r\nknows; I and another one.  But he won\'t speak.  He is--"\r\n\r\nHe checked himself with a feeble smile, and, making an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to pat the officer on the shoulder, knocked over a couple of\r\nempty bottles.\r\n\r\n"Personally you are a fine fellow," he said very distinctly, in a\r\npatronising manner.  His head nodded drowsily as he sat muttering to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe two officers looked at each other helplessly.\r\n\r\n"This won\'t do," said the lieutenant, addressing his junior.  "Have the\r\nmen mustered in the compound here.  I must get some sense out of him.  Hi!\r\nAlmayer!  Wake up, man.  Redeem your word.  You gave your word.  You gave\r\nyour word of honour, you know."\r\n\r\nAlmayer shook off the officer\'s hand with impatience, but his ill-humour\r\nvanished at once, and he looked up, putting his forefinger to the side of\r\nhis nose.\r\n\r\n"You are very young; there is time for all things," he said, with an air\r\nof great sagacity.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant turned towards Nina, who, leaning back in her chair,\r\nwatched her father steadily.\r\n\r\n"Really I am very much distressed by all this for your sake," he\r\nexclaimed.  "I do not know;" he went on, speaking with some\r\nembarrassment, "whether I have any right to ask you anything, unless,\r\nperhaps, to withdraw from this painful scene, but I feel that I must--for\r\nyour father\'s good--suggest that you should--I mean if you have any\r\ninfluence over him you ought to exert it now to make him keep the promise\r\nhe gave me before he--before he got into this state."\r\n\r\nHe observed with discouragement that she seemed not to take any notice of\r\nwhat he said sitting still with half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n"I trust--" he began again.\r\n\r\n"What is the promise you speak of?" abruptly asked Nina, leaving her seat\r\nand moving towards her father.\r\n\r\n"Nothing that is not just and proper.  He promised to deliver to us a man\r\nwho in time of profound peace took the lives of innocent men to escape\r\nthe punishment he deserved for breaking the law.  He planned his mischief\r\non a large scale.  It is not his fault if it failed, partially.  Of\r\ncourse you have heard of Dain Maroola.  Your father secured him, I\r\nunderstand.  We know he escaped up this river.  Perhaps you--"\r\n\r\n"And he killed white men!" interrupted Nina.\r\n\r\n"I regret to say they were white.  Yes, two white men lost their lives\r\nthrough that scoundrel\'s freak."\r\n\r\n"Two only!" exclaimed Nina.\r\n\r\nThe officer looked at her in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Why! why!  You--" he stammered, confused.\r\n\r\n"There might have been more," interrupted Nina.  "And when you get\r\nthis--this scoundrel will you go?"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant, still speechless, bowed his assent.\r\n\r\n"Then I would get him for you if I had to seek him in a burning fire,"\r\nshe burst out with intense energy.  "I hate the sight of your white\r\nfaces.  I hate the sound of your gentle voices.  That is the way you\r\nspeak to women, dropping sweet words before any pretty face.  I have\r\nheard your voices before.  I hoped to live here without seeing any other\r\nwhite face but this," she added in a gentler tone, touching lightly her\r\nfather\'s cheek.\r\n\r\nAlmayer ceased his mumbling and opened his eyes.  He caught hold of his\r\ndaughter\'s hand and pressed it to his face, while Nina with the other\r\nhand smoothed his rumpled grey hair, looking defiantly over her father\'s\r\nhead at the officer, who had now regained his composure and returned her\r\nlook with a cool, steady stare.  Below, in front of the verandah, they\r\ncould hear the tramp of seamen mustering there according to orders.  The\r\nsub-lieutenant came up the steps, while Babalatchi stood up uneasily and,\r\nwith finger on lip, tried to catch Nina\'s eye.\r\n\r\n"You are a good girl," whispered Almayer, absently, dropping his\r\ndaughter\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Father! father!" she cried, bending over him with passionate entreaty.\r\n"See those two men looking at us.  Send them away.  I cannot bear it any\r\nmore.  Send them away.  Do what they want and let them go."\r\n\r\nShe caught sight of Babalatchi and ceased speaking suddenly, but her foot\r\ntapped the floor with rapid beats in a paroxysm of nervous restlessness.\r\nThe two officers stood close together looking on curiously.\r\n\r\n"What has happened?  What is the matter?" whispered the younger man.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know," answered the other, under his breath.  "One is furious, and\r\nthe other is drunk.  Not so drunk, either.  Queer, this.  Look!"\r\n\r\nAlmayer had risen, holding on to his daughter\'s arm.  He hesitated a\r\nmoment, then he let go his hold and lurched half-way across the verandah.\r\nThere he pulled himself together, and stood very straight, breathing hard\r\nand glaring round angrily.\r\n\r\n"Are the men ready?" asked the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n"All ready, sir."\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Almayer, lead the way," said the lieutenant\r\n\r\nAlmayer rested his eyes on him as if he saw him for the first time.\r\n\r\n"Two men," he said thickly.  The effort of speaking seemed to interfere\r\nwith his equilibrium.  He took a quick step to save himself from a fall,\r\nand remained swaying backwards and forwards.  "Two men," he began again,\r\nspeaking with difficulty.  "Two white men--men in uniform--honourable\r\nmen.  I want to say--men of honour.  Are you?"\r\n\r\n"Come!  None of that," said the officer impatiently.  "Let us have that\r\nfriend of yours."\r\n\r\n"What do you think I am?" asked Almayer, fiercely.\r\n\r\n"You are drunk, but not so drunk as not to know what you are doing.\r\nEnough of this tomfoolery," said the officer sternly, "or I will have you\r\nput under arrest in your own house."\r\n\r\n"Arrest!" laughed Almayer, discordantly.  "Ha! ha! ha!  Arrest!  Why, I\r\nhave been trying to get out of this infernal place for twenty years, and\r\nI can\'t.  You hear, man!  I can\'t, and never shall!  Never!"\r\n\r\nHe ended his words with a sob, and walked unsteadily down the stairs.\r\nWhen in the courtyard the lieutenant approached him, and took him by the\r\narm.  The sub-lieutenant and Babalatchi followed close.\r\n\r\n"That\'s better, Almayer," said the officer encouragingly.  "Where are you\r\ngoing to?  There are only planks there.  Here," he went on, shaking him\r\nslightly, "do we want the boats?"\r\n\r\n"No," answered Almayer, viciously.  "You want a grave."\r\n\r\n"What?  Wild again!  Try to talk sense."\r\n\r\n"Grave!" roared Almayer, struggling to get himself free.  "A hole in the\r\nground.  Don\'t you understand?  You must be drunk.  Let me go!  Let go, I\r\ntell you!"\r\n\r\nHe tore away from the officer\'s grasp, and reeled towards the planks\r\nwhere the body lay under its white cover; then he turned round quickly,\r\nand faced the semicircle of interested faces.  The sun was sinking\r\nrapidly, throwing long shadows of house and trees over the courtyard, but\r\nthe light lingered yet on the river, where the logs went drifting past in\r\nmidstream, looking very distinct and black in the pale red glow.  The\r\ntrunks of the trees in the forest on the east bank were lost in gloom\r\nwhile their highest branches swayed gently in the departing sunlight.  The\r\nair felt heavy and cold in the breeze, expiring in slight puffs that came\r\nover the water.\r\n\r\nAlmayer shivered as he made an effort to speak, and again with an\r\nuncertain gesture he seemed to free his throat from the grip of an\r\ninvisible hand.  His bloodshot eyes wandered aimlessly from face to face.\r\n\r\n"There!" he said at last.  "Are you all there?  He is a dangerous man."\r\n\r\nHe dragged at the cover with hasty violence, and the body rolled stiffly\r\noff the planks and fell at his feet in rigid helplessness.\r\n\r\n"Cold, perfectly cold," said Almayer, looking round with a mirthless\r\nsmile.  "Sorry can do no better.  And you can\'t hang him, either.  As you\r\nobserve, gentlemen," he added gravely, "there is no head, and hardly any\r\nneck."\r\n\r\nThe last ray of light was snatched away from the tree-tops, the river\r\ngrew suddenly dark, and in the great stillness the murmur of the flowing\r\nwater seemed to fill the vast expanse of grey shadow that descended upon\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n"This is Dain," went on Almayer to the silent group that surrounded him.\r\n"And I have kept my word.  First one hope, then another, and this is my\r\nlast.  Nothing is left now.  You think there is one dead man here?\r\nMistake, I \'sure you.  I am much more dead.  Why don\'t you hang me?" he\r\nsuggested suddenly, in a friendly tone, addressing the lieutenant.  "I\r\nassure, assure you it would be a mat--matter of form altog--altogether."\r\n\r\nThese last words he muttered to himself, and walked zigzaging towards his\r\nhouse.  "Get out!" he thundered at Ali, who was approaching timidly with\r\noffers of assistance.  From afar, scared groups of men and women watched\r\nhis devious progress.  He dragged himself up the stairs by the banister,\r\nand managed to reach a chair into which he fell heavily.  He sat for\r\nawhile panting with exertion and anger, and looking round vaguely for\r\nNina; then making a threatening gesture towards the compound, where he\r\nhad heard Babalatchi\'s voice, he overturned the table with his foot in a\r\ngreat crash of smashed crockery.  He muttered yet menacingly to himself,\r\nthen his head fell on his breast, his eyes closed, and with a deep sigh\r\nhe fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThat night--for the first time in its history--the peaceful and\r\nflourishing settlement of Sambir saw the lights shining about "Almayer\'s\r\nFolly."  These were the lanterns of the boats hung up by the seamen under\r\nthe verandah where the two officers were holding a court of inquiry into\r\nthe truth of the story related to them by Babalatchi.  Babalatchi had\r\nregained all his importance.  He was eloquent and persuasive, calling\r\nHeaven and Earth to witness the truth of his statements.  There were also\r\nother witnesses.  Mahmat Banjer and a good many others underwent a close\r\nexamination that dragged its weary length far into the evening.  A\r\nmessenger was sent for Abdulla, who excused himself from coming on the\r\nscore of his venerable age, but sent Reshid.  Mahmat had to produce the\r\nbangle, and saw with rage and mortification the lieutenant put it in his\r\npocket, as one of the proofs of Dain\'s death, to be sent in with the\r\nofficial report of the mission.  Babalatchi\'s ring was also impounded for\r\nthe same purpose, but the experienced statesman was resigned to that loss\r\nfrom the very beginning.  He did not mind as long as he was sure, that\r\nthe white men believed.  He put that question to himself earnestly as he\r\nleft, one of the last, when the proceedings came to a close.  He was not\r\ncertain.  Still, if they believed only for a night, he would put Dain\r\nbeyond their reach and feel safe himself.  He walked away fast, looking\r\nfrom time to time over his shoulder in the fear of being followed, but he\r\nsaw and heard nothing.\r\n\r\n"Ten o\'clock," said the lieutenant, looking at his watch and yawning.  "I\r\nshall hear some of the captain\'s complimentary remarks when we get back.\r\nMiserable business, this."\r\n\r\n"Do you think all this is true?" asked the younger man.\r\n\r\n"True!  It is just possible.  But if it isn\'t true what can we do?  If we\r\nhad a dozen boats we could patrol the creeks; and that wouldn\'t be much\r\ngood.  That drunken madman was right; we haven\'t enough hold on this\r\ncoast.  They do what they like.  Are our hammocks slung?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I told the coxswain.  Strange couple over there," said the sub,\r\nwith a wave of his hand towards Almayer\'s house.\r\n\r\n"Hem!  Queer, certainly.  What have you been telling her?  I was\r\nattending to the father most of the time."\r\n\r\n"I assure you I have been perfectly civil," protested the other warmly.\r\n\r\n"All right.  Don\'t get excited.  She objects to civility, then, from what\r\nI understand.  I thought you might have been tender.  You know we are on\r\nservice."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course.  Never forget that.  Coldly civil.  That\'s all."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed a little, and not feeling sleepy began to pace the\r\nverandah side by side.  The moon rose stealthily above the trees, and\r\nsuddenly changed the river into a stream of scintillating silver.  The\r\nforest came out of the black void and stood sombre and pensive over the\r\nsparkling water.  The breeze died away into a breathless calm.\r\n\r\nSeamanlike, the two officers tramped measuredly up and down without\r\nexchanging a word.  The loose planks rattled rhythmically under their\r\nsteps with obstrusive dry sound in the perfect silence of the night.  As\r\nthey were wheeling round again the younger man stood attentive.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear that?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No!" said the other.  "Hear what?"\r\n\r\n"I thought I heard a cry.  Ever so faint.  Seemed a woman\'s voice.  In\r\nthat other house.  Ah!  Again!  Hear it?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the lieutenant, after listening awhile.  "You young fellows\r\nalways hear women\'s voices.  If you are going to dream you had better get\r\ninto your hammock.  Good-night."\r\n\r\nThe moon mounted higher, and the warm shadows grew smaller and crept away\r\nas if hiding before the cold and cruel light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n"It has set at last," said Nina to her mother pointing towards the hills\r\nbehind which the sun had sunk.  "Listen, mother, I am going now to\r\nBulangi\'s creek, and if I should never return--"\r\n\r\nShe interrupted herself, and something like doubt dimmed for a moment the\r\nfire of suppressed exaltation that had glowed in her eyes and had\r\nilluminated the serene impassiveness of her features with a ray of eager\r\nlife during all that long day of excitement--the day of joy and anxiety,\r\nof hope and terror, of vague grief and indistinct delight.  While the sun\r\nshone with that dazzling light in which her love was born and grew till\r\nit possessed her whole being, she was kept firm in her unwavering resolve\r\nby the mysterious whisperings of desire which filled her heart with\r\nimpatient longing for the darkness that would mean the end of danger and\r\nstrife, the beginning of happiness, the fulfilling of love, the\r\ncompleteness of life.  It had set at last!  The short tropical twilight\r\nwent out before she could draw the long breath of relief; and now the\r\nsudden darkness seemed to be full of menacing voices calling upon her to\r\nrush headlong into the unknown; to be true to her own impulses, to give\r\nherself up to the passion she had evoked and shared.  He was waiting!  In\r\nthe solitude of the secluded clearing, in the vast silence of the forest\r\nhe was waiting alone, a fugitive in fear of his life.  Indifferent to his\r\ndanger he was waiting for her.  It was for her only that he had come; and\r\nnow as the time approached when he should have his reward, she asked\r\nherself with dismay what meant that chilling doubt of her own will and of\r\nher own desire?  With an effort she shook off the fear of the passing\r\nweakness.  He should have his reward.  Her woman\'s love and her woman\'s\r\nhonour overcame the faltering distrust of that unknown future waiting for\r\nher in the darkness of the river.\r\n\r\n"No, you will not return," muttered Mrs. Almayer, prophetically.\r\n\r\n"Without you he will not go, and if he remains here--"  She waved her\r\nhand towards the lights of "Almayer\'s Folly," and the unfinished sentence\r\ndied out in a threatening murmur.\r\n\r\nThe two women had met behind the house, and now were walking slowly\r\ntogether towards the creek where all the canoes were moored.  Arrived at\r\nthe fringe of bushes they stopped by a common impulse, and Mrs. Almayer,\r\nlaying her hand on her daughter\'s arm, tried in vain to look close into\r\nthe girl\'s averted face.  When she attempted to speak her first words\r\nwere lost in a stifled sob that sounded strangely coming from that woman\r\nwho, of all human passions, seemed to know only those of anger and hate.\r\n\r\n"You are going away to be a great Ranee," she said at last, in a voice\r\nthat was steady enough now, "and if you be wise you shall have much power\r\nthat will endure many days, and even last into your old age.  What have I\r\nbeen?  A slave all my life, and I have cooked rice for a man who had no\r\ncourage and no wisdom.  Hai!  I! even I, was given in gift by a chief and\r\na warrior to a man that was neither.  Hai!  Hai!"\r\n\r\nShe wailed to herself softly, lamenting the lost possibilities of murder\r\nand mischief that could have fallen to her lot had she been mated with a\r\ncongenial spirit.  Nina bent down over Mrs. Almayer\'s slight form and\r\nscanned attentively, under the stars that had rushed out on the black sky\r\nand now hung breathless over that strange parting, her mother\'s\r\nshrivelled features, and looked close into the sunken eyes that could see\r\ninto her own dark future by the light of a long and a painful experience.\r\nAgain she felt herself fascinated, as of old, by her mother\'s exalted\r\nmood and by the oracular certainty of expression which, together with her\r\nfits of violence, had contributed not a little to the reputation for\r\nwitchcraft she enjoyed in the settlement.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n"I was a slave, and you shall be a queen," went on Mrs. Almayer, looking\r\nstraight before her; "but remember men\'s strength and their weakness.\r\nTremble before his anger, so that he may see your fear in the light of\r\nday; but in your heart you may laugh, for after sunset he is your slave."\r\n\r\n"A slave!  He!  The master of life!  You do not know him, mother."\r\n\r\nMrs. Almayer condescended to laugh contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"You speak like a fool of a white woman," she exclaimed.  "What do you\r\nknow of men\'s anger and of men\'s love?  Have you watched the sleep of men\r\nweary of dealing death?  Have you felt about you the strong arm that\r\ncould drive a kriss deep into a beating heart?  Yah! you are a white\r\nwoman, and ought to pray to a woman-god!"\r\n\r\n"Why do you say this?  I have listened to your words so long that I have\r\nforgotten my old life.  If I was white would I stand here, ready to go?\r\nMother, I shall return to the house and look once more at my father\'s\r\nface."\r\n\r\n"No!" said Mrs. Almayer, violently.  "No, he sleeps now the sleep of gin;\r\nand if you went back he might awake and see you.  No, he shall never see\r\nyou.  When the terrible old man took you away from me when you were\r\nlittle, you remember--"\r\n\r\n"It was such a long time ago," murmured Nina.\r\n\r\n"I remember," went on Mrs. Almayer, fiercely.  "I wanted to look at your\r\nface again.  He said no!  I heard you cry and jumped into the river.  You\r\nwere his daughter then; you are my daughter now.  Never shall you go back\r\nto that house; you shall never cross this courtyard again.  No! no!"\r\n\r\nHer voice rose almost to a shout.  On the other side of the creek there\r\nwas a rustle in the long grass.  The two women heard it, and listened for\r\na while in startled silence.  "I shall go," said Nina, in a cautious but\r\nintense whisper.  "What is your hate or your revenge to me?"\r\n\r\nShe moved towards the house, Mrs. Almayer clinging to her and trying to\r\npull her back.\r\n\r\n"Stop, you shall not go!" she gasped.\r\n\r\nNina pushed away her mother impatiently and gathered up her skirts for a\r\nquick run, but Mrs. Almayer ran forward and turned round, facing her\r\ndaughter with outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n"If you move another step," she exclaimed, breathing quickly, "I shall\r\ncry out.  Do you see those lights in the big house?  There sit two white\r\nmen, angry because they cannot have the blood of the man you love.  And\r\nin those dark houses," she continued, more calmly as she pointed towards\r\nthe settlement, "my voice could wake up men that would lead the Orang\r\nBlanda soldiers to him who is waiting--for you."\r\n\r\nShe could not see her daughter\'s face, but the white figure before her\r\nstood silent and irresolute in the darkness.  Mrs. Almayer pursued her\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n"Give up your old life!  Forget!" she said in entreating tones.  "Forget\r\nthat you ever looked at a white face; forget their words; forget their\r\nthoughts.  They speak lies.  And they think lies because they despise us\r\nthat are better than they are, but not so strong.  Forget their\r\nfriendship and their contempt; forget their many gods.  Girl, why do you\r\nwant to remember the past when there is a warrior and a chief ready to\r\ngive many lives--his own life--for one of your smiles?"\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke she pushed gently her daughter towards the canoes, hiding\r\nher own fear, anxiety, and doubt under the flood of passionate words that\r\nleft Nina no time to think and no opportunity to protest, even if she had\r\nwished it.  But she did not wish it now.  At the bottom of that passing\r\ndesire to look again at her father\'s face there was no strong affection.\r\nShe felt no scruples and no remorse at leaving suddenly that man whose\r\nsentiment towards herself she could not understand, she could not even\r\nsee.  There was only an instinctive clinging to old life, to old habits,\r\nto old faces; that fear of finality which lurks in every human breast and\r\nprevents so many heroisms and so many crimes.  For years she had stood\r\nbetween her mother and her father, the one so strong in her weakness, the\r\nother so weak where he could have been strong.  Between those two beings\r\nso dissimilar, so antagonistic, she stood with mute heart wondering and\r\nangry at the fact of her own existence.  It seemed so unreasonable, so\r\nhumiliating to be flung there in that settlement and to see the days rush\r\nby into the past, without a hope, a desire, or an aim that would justify\r\nthe life she had to endure in ever-growing weariness.  She had little\r\nbelief and no sympathy for her father\'s dreams; but the savage ravings of\r\nher mother chanced to strike a responsive chord, deep down somewhere in\r\nher despairing heart; and she dreamed dreams of her own with the\r\npersistent absorption of a captive thinking of liberty within the walls\r\nof his prison cell.  With the coming of Dain she found the road to\r\nfreedom by obeying the voice of the new-born impulses, and with surprised\r\njoy she thought she could read in his eyes the answer to all the\r\nquestionings of her heart.  She understood now the reason and the aim of\r\nlife; and in the triumphant unveiling of that mystery she threw away\r\ndisdainfully her past with its sad thoughts, its bitter feelings, and its\r\nfaint affections, now withered and dead in contact with her fierce\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nMrs. Almayer unmoored Nina\'s own canoe and, straightening herself\r\npainfully, stood, painter in hand, looking at her daughter.\r\n\r\n"Quick," she said; "get away before the moon rises, while the river is\r\ndark.  I am afraid of Abdulla\'s slaves.  The wretches prowl in the night\r\noften, and might see and follow you.  There are two paddles in the\r\ncanoe."\r\n\r\nNina approached her mother and hesitatingly touched lightly with her lips\r\nthe wrinkled forehead.  Mrs. Almayer snorted contemptuously in protest\r\nagainst that tenderness which she, nevertheless, feared could be\r\ncontagious.\r\n\r\n"Shall I ever see you again, mother?" murmured Nina.\r\n\r\n"No," said Mrs. Almayer, after a short silence.  "Why should you return\r\nhere where it is my fate to die?  You will live far away in splendour and\r\nmight.  When I hear of white men driven from the islands, then I shall\r\nknow that you are alive, and that you remember my words."\r\n\r\n"I shall always remember," returned Nina, earnestly; "but where is my\r\npower, and what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Do not let him look too long in your eyes, nor lay his head on your\r\nknees without reminding him that men should fight before they rest.  And\r\nif he lingers, give him his kriss yourself and bid him go, as the wife of\r\na mighty prince should do when the enemies are near.  Let him slay the\r\nwhite men that come to us to trade, with prayers on their lips and loaded\r\nguns in their hands.  Ah!"--she ended with a sigh--"they are on every\r\nsea, and on every shore; and they are very many!"\r\n\r\nShe swung the bow of the canoe towards the river, but did not let go the\r\ngunwale, keeping her hand on it in irresolute thoughtfulness.\r\n\r\nNina put the point of the paddle against the bank, ready to shove off\r\ninto the stream.\r\n\r\n"What is it, mother?" she asked, in a low voice.  "Do you hear anything?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Mrs. Almayer, absently.  "Listen, Nina," she continued,\r\nabruptly, after a slight pause, "in after years there will be other\r\nwomen--"\r\n\r\nA stifled cry in the boat interrupted her, and the paddle rattled in the\r\ncanoe as it slipped from Nina\'s hands, which she put out in a protesting\r\ngesture.  Mrs. Almayer fell on her knees on the bank and leaned over the\r\ngunwale so as to bring her own face close to her daughter\'s.\r\n\r\n"There will be other women," she repeated firmly; "I tell you that,\r\nbecause you are half white, and may forget that he is a great chief, and\r\nthat such things must be.  Hide your anger, and do not let him see on\r\nyour face the pain that will eat your heart.  Meet him with joy in your\r\neyes and wisdom on your lips, for to you he will turn in sadness or in\r\ndoubt.  As long as he looks upon many women your power will last, but\r\nshould there be one, one only with whom he seems to forget you, then--"\r\n\r\n"I could not live," exclaimed Nina, covering her face with both her\r\nhands.  "Do not speak so, mother; it could not be."\r\n\r\n"Then," went on Mrs. Almayer, steadily, "to that woman, Nina, show no\r\nmercy."\r\n\r\nShe moved the canoe down towards the stream by the gunwale, and gripped\r\nit with both her hands, the bow pointing into the river.\r\n\r\n"Are you crying?" she asked sternly of her daughter, who sat still with\r\ncovered face.  "Arise, and take your paddle, for he has waited long\r\nenough.  And remember, Nina, no mercy; and if you must strike, strike\r\nwith a steady hand."\r\n\r\nShe put out all her strength, and swinging her body over the water, shot\r\nthe light craft far into the stream.  When she recovered herself from the\r\neffort she tried vainly to catch a glimpse of the canoe that seemed to\r\nhave dissolved suddenly into the white mist trailing over the heated\r\nwaters of the Pantai.  After listening for a while intently on her knees,\r\nMrs. Almayer rose with a deep sigh, while two tears wandered slowly down\r\nher withered cheeks.  She wiped them off quickly with a wisp of her grey\r\nhair as if ashamed of herself, but could not stifle another loud sigh,\r\nfor her heart was heavy and she suffered much, being unused to tender\r\nemotions.  This time she fancied she had heard a faint noise, like the\r\necho of her own sigh, and she stopped, straining her ears to catch the\r\nslightest sound, and peering apprehensively towards the bushes near her.\r\n\r\n"Who is there?" she asked, in an unsteady voice, while her imagination\r\npeopled the solitude of the riverside with ghost-like forms.  "Who is\r\nthere?" she repeated faintly.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer: only the voice of the river murmuring in sad\r\nmonotone behind the white veil seemed to swell louder for a moment, to\r\ndie away again in a soft whisper of eddies washing against the bank.\r\n\r\nMrs. Almayer shook her head as if in answer to her own thoughts, and\r\nwalked quickly away from the bushes, looking to the right and left\r\nwatchfully.  She went straight towards the cooking-shed, observing that\r\nthe embers of the fire there glowed more brightly than usual, as if\r\nsomebody had been adding fresh fuel to the fires during the evening.  As\r\nshe approached, Babalatchi, who had been squatting in the warm glow, rose\r\nand met her in the shadow outside.\r\n\r\n"Is she gone?" asked the anxious statesman, hastily.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Mrs. Almayer.  "What are the white men doing?  When did\r\nyou leave them?"\r\n\r\n"They are sleeping now, I think.  May they never wake!" exclaimed\r\nBabalatchi, fervently.  "Oh! but they are devils, and made much talk and\r\ntrouble over that carcase.  The chief threatened me twice with his hand,\r\nand said he would have me tied up to a tree.  Tie me up to a tree!  Me!"\r\nhe repeated, striking his breast violently.\r\n\r\nMrs. Almayer laughed tauntingly.\r\n\r\n"And you salaamed and asked for mercy.  Men with arms by their side acted\r\notherwise when I was young."\r\n\r\n"And where are they, the men of your youth?  You mad woman!" retorted\r\nBabalatchi, angrily.  "Killed by the Dutch.  Aha!  But I shall live to\r\ndeceive them.  A man knows when to fight and when to tell peaceful lies.\r\nYou would know that if you were not a woman."\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Almayer did not seem to hear him.  With bent body and\r\noutstretched arm she appeared to be listening to some noise behind the\r\nshed.\r\n\r\n"There are strange sounds," she whispered, with evident alarm.  "I have\r\nheard in the air the sounds of grief, as of a sigh and weeping.  That was\r\nby the riverside.  And now again I heard--"\r\n\r\n"Where?" asked Babalatchi, in an altered voice.  "What did you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Close here.  It was like a breath long drawn.  I wish I had burnt the\r\npaper over the body before it was buried."\r\n\r\n"Yes," assented Babalatchi.  "But the white men had him thrown into a\r\nhole at once.  You know he found his death on the river," he added\r\ncheerfully, "and his ghost may hail the canoes, but would leave the land\r\nalone."\r\n\r\nMrs. Almayer, who had been craning her neck to look round the corner of\r\nthe shed, drew back her head.\r\n\r\n"There is nobody there," she said, reassured.  "Is it not time for the\r\nRajah war-canoe to go to the clearing?"\r\n\r\n"I have been waiting for it here, for I myself must go," explained\r\nBabalatchi.  "I think I will go over and see what makes them late.  When\r\nwill you come?  The Rajah gives you refuge."\r\n\r\n"I shall paddle over before the break of day.  I cannot leave my dollars\r\nbehind," muttered Mrs. Almayer.\r\n\r\nThey separated.  Babalatchi crossed the courtyard towards the creek to\r\nget his canoe, and Mrs. Almayer walked slowly to the house, ascended the\r\nplankway, and passing through the back verandah entered the passage\r\nleading to the front of the house; but before going in she turned in the\r\ndoorway and looked back at the empty and silent courtyard, now lit up by\r\nthe rays of the rising moon.  No sooner she had disappeared, however,\r\nthan a vague shape flitted out from amongst the stalks of the banana\r\nplantation, darted over the moonlit space, and fell in the darkness at\r\nthe foot of the verandah.  It might have been the shadow of a driving\r\ncloud, so noiseless and rapid was its passage, but for the trail of\r\ndisturbed grass, whose feathery heads trembled and swayed for a long time\r\nin the moonlight before they rested motionless and gleaming, like a\r\ndesign of silver sprays embroidered on a sombre background.\r\n\r\nMrs. Almayer lighted the cocoanut lamp, and lifting cautiously the red\r\ncurtain, gazed upon her husband, shading the light with her hand.\r\n\r\nAlmayer, huddled up in the chair, one of his arms hanging down, the other\r\nthrown across the lower part of his face as if to ward off an invisible\r\nenemy, his legs stretched straight out, slept heavily, unconscious of the\r\nunfriendly eyes that looked upon him in disparaging criticism.  At his\r\nfeet lay the overturned table, amongst a wreck of crockery and broken\r\nbottles.  The appearance as of traces left by a desperate struggle was\r\naccentuated by the chairs, which seemed to have been scattered violently\r\nall over the place, and now lay about the verandah with a lamentable\r\naspect of inebriety in their helpless attitudes.  Only Nina\'s big rocking-\r\nchair, standing black and motionless on its high runners, towered above\r\nthe chaos of demoralised furniture, unflinchingly dignified and patient,\r\nwaiting for its burden.\r\n\r\nWith a last scornful look towards the sleeper, Mrs. Almayer passed behind\r\nthe curtain into her own room.  A couple of bats, encouraged by the\r\ndarkness and the peaceful state of affairs, resumed their silent and\r\noblique gambols above Almayer\'s head, and for a long time the profound\r\nquiet of the house was unbroken, save for the deep breathing of the\r\nsleeping man and the faint tinkle of silver in the hands of the woman\r\npreparing for flight.  In the increasing light of the moon that had risen\r\nnow above the night mist, the objects on the verandah came out strongly\r\noutlined in black splashes of shadow with all the uncompromising ugliness\r\nof their disorder, and a caricature of the sleeping Almayer appeared on\r\nthe dirty whitewash of the wall behind him in a grotesquely exaggerated\r\ndetail of attitude and feature enlarged to a heroic size.  The\r\ndiscontented bats departed in quest of darker places, and a lizard came\r\nout in short, nervous rushes, and, pleased with the white table-cloth,\r\nstopped on it in breathless immobility that would have suggested sudden\r\ndeath had it not been for the melodious call he exchanged with a less\r\nadventurous friend hiding amongst the lumber in the courtyard.  Then the\r\nboards in the passage creaked, the lizard vanished, and Almayer stirred\r\nuneasily with a sigh: slowly, out of the senseless annihilation of\r\ndrunken sleep, he was returning, through the land of dreams, to waking\r\nconsciousness.  Almayer\'s head rolled from shoulder to shoulder in the\r\noppression of his dream; the heavens had descended upon him like a heavy\r\nmantle, and trailed in starred folds far under him.  Stars above, stars\r\nall round him; and from the stars under his feet rose a whisper full of\r\nentreaties and tears, and sorrowful faces flitted amongst the clusters of\r\nlight filling the infinite space below.  How escape from the importunity\r\nof lamentable cries and from the look of staring, sad eyes in the faces\r\nwhich pressed round him till he gasped for breath under the crushing\r\nweight of worlds that hung over his aching shoulders?  Get away!  But\r\nhow?  If he attempted to move he would step off into nothing, and perish\r\nin the crashing fall of that universe of which he was the only support.\r\nAnd what were the voices saying?  Urging him to move!  Why?  Move to\r\ndestruction!  Not likely!  The absurdity of the thing filled him with\r\nindignation.  He got a firmer foothold and stiffened his muscles in\r\nheroic resolve to carry his burden to all eternity.  And ages passed in\r\nthe superhuman labour, amidst the rush of circling worlds; in the\r\nplaintive murmur of sorrowful voices urging him to desist before it was\r\ntoo late--till the mysterious power that had laid upon him the giant task\r\nseemed at last to seek his destruction.  With terror he felt an\r\nirresistible hand shaking him by the shoulder, while the chorus of voices\r\nswelled louder into an agonised prayer to go, go before it is too late.\r\nHe felt himself slipping, losing his balance, as something dragged at his\r\nlegs, and he fell.  With a faint cry he glided out of the anguish of\r\nperishing creation into an imperfect waking that seemed to be still under\r\nthe spell of his dream.\r\n\r\n"What?  What?" he murmured sleepily, without moving or opening his eyes.\r\nHis head still felt heavy, and he had not the courage to raise his\r\neyelids.  In his ears there still lingered the sound of entreating\r\nwhisper.--"Am I awake?--Why do I hear the voices?" he argued to himself,\r\nhazily.--"I cannot get rid of the horrible nightmare yet.--I have been\r\nvery drunk.--What is that shaking me?  I am dreaming yet--I must open my\r\neyes and be done with it.  I am only half awake, it is evident."\r\n\r\nHe made an effort to shake off his stupor and saw a face close to his,\r\nglaring at him with staring eyeballs.  He closed his eyes again in amazed\r\nhorror and sat up straight in the chair, trembling in every limb.  What\r\nwas this apparition?--His own fancy, no doubt.--His nerves had been much\r\ntried the day before--and then the drink!  He would not see it again if\r\nhe had the courage to look.--He would look directly.--Get a little\r\nsteadier first.--So.--Now.\r\n\r\nHe looked.  The figure of a woman standing in the steely light, her hands\r\nstretched forth in a suppliant gesture, confronted him from the far-off\r\nend of the verandah; and in the space between him and the obstinate\r\nphantom floated the murmur of words that fell on his ears in a jumble of\r\ntorturing sentences, the meaning of which escaped the utmost efforts of\r\nhis brain.  Who spoke the Malay words?  Who ran away?  Why too late--and\r\ntoo late for what?  What meant those words of hate and love mixed so\r\nstrangely together, the ever-recurring names falling on his ears again\r\nand again--Nina, Dain; Dain, Nina?  Dain was dead, and Nina was sleeping,\r\nunaware of the terrible experience through which he was now passing.  Was\r\nhe going to be tormented for ever, sleeping or waking, and have no peace\r\neither night or day?  What was the meaning of this?\r\n\r\nHe shouted the last words aloud.  The shadowy woman seemed to shrink and\r\nrecede a little from him towards the doorway, and there was a shriek.\r\nExasperated by the incomprehensible nature of his torment, Almayer made a\r\nrush upon the apparition, which eluded his grasp, and he brought up\r\nheavily against the wall.  Quick as lightning he turned round and pursued\r\nfiercely the mysterious figure fleeing from him with piercing shrieks\r\nthat were like fuel to the flames of his anger.  Over the furniture,\r\nround the overturned table, and now he had it cornered behind Nina\'s\r\nchair.  To the left, to the right they dodged, the chair rocking madly\r\nbetween them, she sending out shriek after shriek at every feint, and he\r\ngrowling meaningless curses through his hard set teeth.  "Oh! the\r\nfiendish noise that split his head and seemed to choke his breath.--It\r\nwould kill him.--It must be stopped!"  An insane desire to crush that\r\nyelling thing induced him to cast himself recklessly over the chair with\r\na desperate grab, and they came down together in a cloud of dust amongst\r\nthe splintered wood.  The last shriek died out under him in a faint\r\ngurgle, and he had secured the relief of absolute silence.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the woman\'s face under him.  A real woman!  He knew her.  By\r\nall that is wonderful!  Taminah!  He jumped up ashamed of his fury and\r\nstood perplexed, wiping his forehead.  The girl struggled to a kneeling\r\nposture and embraced his legs in a frenzied prayer for mercy.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid," he said, raising her.  "I shall not hurt you.  Why do\r\nyou come to my house in the night?  And if you had to come, why not go\r\nbehind the curtain where the women sleep?"\r\n\r\n"The place behind the curtain is empty," gasped Taminah, catching her\r\nbreath between the words.  "There are no women in your house any more,\r\nTuan.  I saw the old Mem go away before I tried to wake you.  I did not\r\nwant your women, I wanted you."\r\n\r\n"Old Mem!" repeated Almayer.  "Do you mean my wife?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head.\r\n\r\n"But of my daughter you are not afraid?" said Almayer.\r\n\r\n"Have you not heard me?" she exclaimed.  "Have I not spoken for a long\r\ntime when you lay there with eyes half open?  She is gone too."\r\n\r\n"I was asleep.  Can you not tell when a man is sleeping and when awake?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," answered Taminah in a low voice; "sometimes the spirit\r\nlingers close to a sleeping body and may hear.  I spoke a long time\r\nbefore I touched you, and I spoke softly for fear it would depart at a\r\nsudden noise and leave you sleeping for ever.  I took you by the shoulder\r\nonly when you began to mutter words I could not understand.  Have you not\r\nheard, then, and do you know nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing of what you said.  What is it?  Tell again if you want me to\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nHe took her by the shoulder and led her unresisting to the front of the\r\nverandah into a stronger light.  She wrung her hands with such an\r\nappearance of grief that he began to be alarmed.\r\n\r\n"Speak," he said.  "You made noise enough to wake even dead men.  And yet\r\nnobody living came," he added to himself in an uneasy whisper.  "Are you\r\nmute?  Speak!" he repeated.\r\n\r\nIn a rush of words which broke out after a short struggle from her\r\ntrembling lips she told him the tale of Nina\'s love and her own jealousy.\r\nSeveral times he looked angrily into her face and told her to be silent;\r\nbut he could not stop the sounds that seemed to him to run out in a hot\r\nstream, swirl about his feet, and rise in scalding waves about him,\r\nhigher, higher, drowning his heart, touching his lips with a feel of\r\nmolten lead, blotting out his sight in scorching vapour, closing over his\r\nhead, merciless and deadly.  When she spoke of the deception as to Dain\'s\r\ndeath of which he had been the victim only that day, he glanced again at\r\nher with terrible eyes, and made her falter for a second, but he turned\r\naway directly, and his face suddenly lost all expression in a stony stare\r\nfar away over the river.  Ah! the river!  His old friend and his old\r\nenemy, speaking always with the same voice as he runs from year to year\r\nbringing fortune or disappointment happiness or pain, upon the same\r\nvarying but unchanged surface of glancing currents and swirling eddies.\r\nFor many years he had listened to the passionless and soothing murmur\r\nthat sometimes was the song of hope, at times the song of triumph, of\r\nencouragement; more often the whisper of consolation that spoke of better\r\ndays to come.  For so many years!  So many years!  And now to the\r\naccompaniment of that murmur he listened to the slow and painful beating\r\nof his heart.  He listened attentively, wondering at the regularity of\r\nits beats.  He began to count mechanically.  One, two.  Why count?  At\r\nthe next beat it must stop.  No heart could suffer so and beat so\r\nsteadily for long.  Those regular strokes as of a muffled hammer that\r\nrang in his ears must stop soon.  Still beating unceasing and cruel.  No\r\nman can bear this; and is this the last, or will the next one be the\r\nlast?--How much longer?  O God! how much longer?  His hand weighed\r\nheavier unconsciously on the girl\'s shoulder, and she spoke the last\r\nwords of her story crouching at his feet with tears of pain and shame and\r\nanger.  Was her revenge to fail her?  This white man was like a senseless\r\nstone.  Too late!  Too late!\r\n\r\n"And you saw her go?" Almayer\'s voice sounded harshly above her head.\r\n\r\n"Did I not tell you?" she sobbed, trying to wriggle gently out from under\r\nhis grip.  "Did I not tell you that I saw the witchwoman push the canoe?\r\nI lay hidden in the grass and heard all the words.  She that we used to\r\ncall the white Mem wanted to return to look at your face, but the\r\nwitchwoman forbade her, and--"\r\n\r\nShe sank lower yet on her elbow, turning half round under the downward\r\npush of the heavy hand, her face lifted up to him with spiteful eyes.\r\n\r\n"And she obeyed," she shouted out in a half-laugh, half-cry of pain.  "Let\r\nme go, Tuan.  Why are you angry with me?  Hasten, or you shall be too\r\nlate to show your anger to the deceitful woman."\r\n\r\nAlmayer dragged her up to her feet and looked close into her face while\r\nshe struggled, turning her head away from his wild stare.\r\n\r\n"Who sent you here to torment me?" he asked, violently.  "I do not\r\nbelieve you.  You lie."\r\n\r\nHe straightened his arm suddenly and flung her across the verandah\r\ntowards the doorway, where she lay immobile and silent, as if she had\r\nleft her life in his grasp, a dark heap, without a sound or a stir.\r\n\r\n"Oh!  Nina!" whispered Almayer, in a voice in which reproach and love\r\nspoke together in pained tenderness.  "Oh!  Nina!  I do not believe."\r\n\r\nA light draught from the river ran over the courtyard in a wave of bowing\r\ngrass and, entering the verandah, touched Almayer\'s forehead with its\r\ncool breath, in a caress of infinite pity.  The curtain in the women\'s\r\ndoorway blew out and instantly collapsed with startling helplessness.  He\r\nstared at the fluttering stuff.\r\n\r\n"Nina!" cried Almayer.  "Where are you, Nina?"\r\n\r\nThe wind passed out of the empty house in a tremulous sigh, and all was\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nAlmayer hid his face in his hands as if to shut out a loathsome sight.\r\nWhen, hearing a slight rustle, he uncovered his eyes, the dark heap by\r\nthe door was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of a shadowless square of moonlight, shining on a smooth\r\nand level expanse of young rice-shoots, a little shelter-hut perched on\r\nhigh posts, the pile of brushwood near by and the glowing embers of a\r\nfire with a man stretched before it, seemed very small and as if lost in\r\nthe pale green iridescence reflected from the ground.  On three sides of\r\nthe clearing, appearing very far away in the deceptive light, the big\r\ntrees of the forest, lashed together with manifold bonds by a mass of\r\ntangled creepers, looked down at the growing young life at their feet\r\nwith the sombre resignation of giants that had lost faith in their\r\nstrength.  And in the midst of them the merciless creepers clung to the\r\nbig trunks in cable-like coils, leaped from tree to tree, hung in thorny\r\nfestoons from the lower boughs, and, sending slender tendrils on high to\r\nseek out the smallest branches, carried death to their victims in an\r\nexulting riot of silent destruction.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth side, following the curve of the bank of that branch of the\r\nPantai that formed the only access to the clearing, ran a black line of\r\nyoung trees, bushes, and thick second growth, unbroken save for a small\r\ngap chopped out in one place.  At that gap began the narrow footpath\r\nleading from the water\'s edge to the grass-built shelter used by the\r\nnight watchers when the ripening crop had to be protected from the wild\r\npigs.  The pathway ended at the foot of the piles on which the hut was\r\nbuilt, in a circular space covered with ashes and bits of burnt wood.  In\r\nthe middle of that space, by the dim fire, lay Dain.\r\n\r\nHe turned over on his side with an impatient sigh, and, pillowing his\r\nhead on his bent arm, lay quietly with his face to the dying fire.  The\r\nglowing embers shone redly in a small circle, throwing a gleam into his\r\nwide-open eyes, and at every deep breath the fine white ash of bygone\r\nfires rose in a light cloud before his parted lips, and danced away from\r\nthe warm glow into the moonbeams pouring down upon Bulangi\'s clearing.\r\nHis body was weary with the exertion of the past few days, his mind more\r\nweary still with the strain of solitary waiting for his fate.  Never\r\nbefore had he felt so helpless.  He had heard the report of the gun fired\r\non board the launch, and he knew that his life was in untrustworthy\r\nhands, and that his enemies were very near.  During the slow hours of the\r\nafternoon he roamed about on the edge of the forest, or, hiding in the\r\nbushes, watched the creek with unquiet eyes for some sign of danger.  He\r\nfeared not death, yet he desired ardently to live, for life to him was\r\nNina.  She had promised to come, to follow him, to share his danger and\r\nhis splendour.  But with her by his side he cared not for danger, and\r\nwithout her there could be no splendour and no joy in existence.\r\n\r\nCrouching in his shady hiding-place, he closed his eyes, trying to evoke\r\nthe gracious and charming image of the white figure that for him was the\r\nbeginning and the end of life.  With eyes shut tight, his teeth hard set,\r\nhe tried in a great effort of passionate will to keep his hold on that\r\nvision of supreme delight.  In vain!  His heart grew heavy as the figure\r\nof Nina faded away to be replaced by another vision this time--a vision\r\nof armed men, of angry faces, of glittering arms--and he seemed to hear\r\nthe hum of excited and triumphant voices as they discovered him in his\r\nhiding-place.  Startled by the vividness of his fancy, he would open his\r\neyes, and, leaping out into the sunlight, resume his aimless wanderings\r\naround the clearing.  As he skirted in his weary march the edge of the\r\nforest he glanced now and then into its dark shade, so enticing in its\r\ndeceptive appearance of coolness, so repellent with its unrelieved gloom,\r\nwhere lay, entombed and rotting, countless generations of trees, and\r\nwhere their successors stood as if mourning, in dark green foliage,\r\nimmense and helpless, awaiting their turn.  Only the parasites seemed to\r\nlive there in a sinuous rush upwards into the air and sunshine, feeding\r\non the dead and the dying alike, and crowning their victims with pink and\r\nblue flowers that gleamed amongst the boughs, incongruous and cruel, like\r\na strident and mocking note in the solemn harmony of the doomed trees.\r\n\r\nA man could hide there, thought Dain, as he approached a place where the\r\ncreepers had been torn and hacked into an archway that might have been\r\nthe beginning of a path.  As he bent down to look through he heard angry\r\ngrunting, and a sounder of wild pig crashed away in the undergrowth.  An\r\nacrid smell of damp earth and of decaying leaves took him by the throat,\r\nand he drew back with a scared face, as if he had been touched by the\r\nbreath of Death itself.  The very air seemed dead in there--heavy and\r\nstagnating, poisoned with the corruption of countless ages.  He went on,\r\nstaggering on his way, urged by the nervous restlessness that made him\r\nfeel tired yet caused him to loathe the very idea of immobility and\r\nrepose.  Was he a wild man to hide in the woods and perhaps be killed\r\nthere--in the darkness--where there was no room to breathe?  He would\r\nwait for his enemies in the sunlight, where he could see the sky and feel\r\nthe breeze.  He knew how a Malay chief should die.  The sombre and\r\ndesperate fury, that peculiar inheritance of his race, took possession of\r\nhim, and he glared savagely across the clearing towards the gap in the\r\nbushes by the riverside.  They would come from there.  In imagination he\r\nsaw them now.  He saw the bearded faces and the white jackets of the\r\nofficers, the light on the levelled barrels of the rifles.  What is the\r\nbravery of the greatest warrior before the firearms in the hand of a\r\nslave?  He would walk toward them with a smiling face, with his hands\r\nheld out in a sign of submission till he was very near them.  He would\r\nspeak friendly words--come nearer yet--yet nearer--so near that they\r\ncould touch him with their hands and stretch them out to make him a\r\ncaptive.  That would be the time: with a shout and a leap he would be in\r\nthe midst of them, kriss in hand, killing, killing, killing, and would\r\ndie with the shouts of his enemies in his ears, their warm blood spurting\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\nCarried away by his excitement, he snatched the kriss hidden in his\r\nsarong, and, drawing a long breath, rushed forward, struck at the empty\r\nair, and fell on his face.  He lay as if stunned in the sudden reaction\r\nfrom his exaltation, thinking that, even if he died thus gloriously, it\r\nwould have to be before he saw Nina.  Better so.  If he saw her again he\r\nfelt that death would be too terrible.  With horror he, the descendant of\r\nRajahs and of conquerors, had to face the doubt of his own bravery.  His\r\ndesire of life tormented him in a paroxysm of agonising remorse.  He had\r\nnot the courage to stir a limb.  He had lost faith in himself, and there\r\nwas nothing else in him of what makes a man.  The suffering remained, for\r\nit is ordered that it should abide in the human body even to the last\r\nbreath, and fear remained.  Dimly he could look into the depths of his\r\npassionate love, see its strength and its weakness, and felt afraid.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down slowly.  The shadow of the western forest marched over\r\nthe clearing, covered the man\'s scorched shoulders with its cool mantle,\r\nand went on hurriedly to mingle with the shadows of other forests on the\r\neastern side.  The sun lingered for a while amongst the light tracery of\r\nthe higher branches, as if in friendly reluctance to abandon the body\r\nstretched in the green paddy-field.  Then Dain, revived by the cool of\r\nthe evening breeze, sat up and stared round him.  As he did so the sun\r\ndipped sharply, as if ashamed of being detected in a sympathising\r\nattitude, and the clearing, which during the day was all light, became\r\nsuddenly all darkness, where the fire gleamed like an eye.  Dain walked\r\nslowly towards the creek, and, divesting himself of his torn sarong, his\r\nonly garment, entered the water cautiously.  He had had nothing to eat\r\nthat day, and had not dared show himself in daylight by the water-side to\r\ndrink.  Now, as he swam silently, he swallowed a few mouthfuls of water\r\nthat lapped about his lips.  This did him good, and he walked with\r\ngreater confidence in himself and others as he returned towards the fire.\r\nHad he been betrayed by Lakamba all would have been over by this.  He\r\nmade up a big blaze, and while it lasted dried himself, and then lay down\r\nby the embers.  He could not sleep, but he felt a great numbness in all\r\nhis limbs.  His restlessness was gone, and he was content to lay still,\r\nmeasuring the time by watching the stars that rose in endless succession\r\nabove the forests, while the slight puffs of wind under the cloudless sky\r\nseemed to fan their twinkle into a greater brightness.  Dreamily he\r\nassured himself over and over again that she would come, till the\r\ncertitude crept into his heart and filled him with a great peace.  Yes,\r\nwhen the next day broke, they would be together on the great blue sea\r\nthat was like life--away from the forests that were like death.  He\r\nmurmured the name of Nina into the silent space with a tender smile: this\r\nseemed to break the spell of stillness, and far away by the creek a frog\r\ncroaked loudly as if in answer.  A chorus of loud roars and plaintive\r\ncalls rose from the mud along the line of bushes.  He laughed heartily;\r\ndoubtless it was their love-song.  He felt affectionate towards the frogs\r\nand listened, pleased with the noisy life near him.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon peeped above the trees he felt the old impatience and the\r\nold restlessness steal over him.  Why was she so late?  True, it was a\r\nlong way to come with a single paddle.  With what skill and what\r\nendurance could those small hands manage a heavy paddle!  It was very\r\nwonderful--such small hands, such soft little palms that knew how to\r\ntouch his cheek with a feel lighter than the fanning of a butterfly\'s\r\nwing.  Wonderful!  He lost himself lovingly in the contemplation of this\r\ntremendous mystery, and when he looked at the moon again it had risen a\r\nhand\'s breadth above the trees.  Would she come?  He forced himself to\r\nlay still, overcoming the impulse to rise and rush round the clearing\r\nagain.  He turned this way and that; at last, quivering with the effort,\r\nhe lay on his back, and saw her face among the stars looking down on him.\r\n\r\nThe croaking of frogs suddenly ceased.  With the watchfulness of a hunted\r\nman Dain sat up, listening anxiously, and heard several splashes in the\r\nwater as the frogs took rapid headers into the creek.  He knew that they\r\nhad been alarmed by something, and stood up suspicious and attentive.  A\r\nslight grating noise, then the dry sound as of two pieces of wood struck\r\nagainst each other.  Somebody was about to land!  He took up an armful of\r\nbrushwood, and, without taking his eyes from the path, held it over the\r\nembers of his fire.  He waited, undecided, and saw something gleam\r\namongst the bushes; then a white figure came out of the shadows and\r\nseemed to float towards him in the pale light.  His heart gave a great\r\nleap and stood still, then went on shaking his frame in furious beats.  He\r\ndropped the brushwood upon the glowing coals, and had an impression of\r\nshouting her name--of rushing to meet her; yet he emitted no sound, he\r\nstirred not an inch, but he stood silent and motionless like chiselled\r\nbronze under the moonlight that streamed over his naked shoulders.  As he\r\nstood still, fighting with his breath, as if bereft of his senses by the\r\nintensity of his delight, she walked up to him with quick, resolute\r\nsteps, and, with the appearance of one about to leap from a dangerous\r\nheight, threw both her arms round his neck with a sudden gesture.  A\r\nsmall blue gleam crept amongst the dry branches, and the crackling of\r\nreviving fire was the only sound as they faced each other in the\r\nspeechless emotion of that meeting; then the dry fuel caught at once, and\r\na bright hot flame shot upwards in a blaze as high as their heads, and in\r\nits light they saw each other\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nNeither of them spoke.  He was regaining his senses in a slight tremor\r\nthat ran upwards along his rigid body and hung about his trembling lips.\r\nShe drew back her head and fastened her eyes on his in one of those long\r\nlooks that are a woman\'s most terrible weapon; a look that is more\r\nstirring than the closest touch, and more dangerous than the thrust of a\r\ndagger, because it also whips the soul out of the body, but leaves the\r\nbody alive and helpless, to be swayed here and there by the capricious\r\ntempests of passion and desire; a look that enwraps the whole body, and\r\nthat penetrates into the innermost recesses of the being, bringing\r\nterrible defeat in the delirious uplifting of accomplished conquest.  It\r\nhas the same meaning for the man of the forests and the sea as for the\r\nman threading the paths of the more dangerous wilderness of houses and\r\nstreets.  Men that had felt in their breasts the awful exultation such a\r\nlook awakens become mere things of to-day--which is paradise; forget\r\nyesterday--which was suffering; care not for to-morrow--which may be\r\nperdition.  They wish to live under that look for ever.  It is the look\r\nof woman\'s surrender.\r\n\r\nHe understood, and, as if suddenly released from his invisible bonds,\r\nfell at her feet with a shout of joy, and, embracing her knees, hid his\r\nhead in the folds of her dress, murmuring disjointed words of gratitude\r\nand love.  Never before had he felt so proud as now, when at the feet of\r\nthat woman that half belonged to his enemies.  Her fingers played with\r\nhis hair in an absent-minded caress as she stood absorbed in thought.  The\r\nthing was done.  Her mother was right.  The man was her slave.  As she\r\nglanced down at his kneeling form she felt a great pitying tenderness for\r\nthat man she was used to call--even in her thoughts--the master of life.\r\nShe lifted her eyes and looked sadly at the southern heavens under which\r\nlay the path of their lives--her own, and that man\'s at her feet.  Did he\r\nnot say himself is that she was the light of his life?  She would be his\r\nlight and his wisdom; she would be his greatness and his strength; yet\r\nhidden from the eyes of all men she would be, above all, his only and\r\nlasting weakness.  A very woman!  In the sublime vanity of her kind she\r\nwas thinking already of moulding a god from the clay at her feet.  A god\r\nfor others to worship.  She was content to see him as he was now, and to\r\nfeel him quiver at the slightest touch of her light fingers.  And while\r\nher eyes looked sadly at the southern stars a faint smile seemed to be\r\nplaying about her firm lips.  Who can tell in the fitful light of a camp\r\nfire?  It might have been a smile of triumph, or of conscious power, or\r\nof tender pity, or, perhaps, of love.\r\n\r\nShe spoke softly to him, and he rose to his feet, putting his arm round\r\nher in quiet consciousness of his ownership; she laid her head on his\r\nshoulder with a sense of defiance to all the world in the encircling\r\nprotection of that arm.  He was hers with all his qualities and all his\r\nfaults.  His strength and his courage, his recklessness and his daring,\r\nhis simple wisdom and his savage cunning--all were hers.  As they passed\r\ntogether out of the red light of the fire into the silver shower of rays\r\nthat fell upon the clearing he bent his head over her face, and she saw\r\nin his eyes the dreamy intoxication of boundless felicity from the close\r\ntouch of her slight figure clasped to his side.  With a rhythmical swing\r\nof their bodies they walked through the light towards the outlying\r\nshadows of the forests that seemed to guard their happiness in solemn\r\nimmobility.  Their forms melted in the play of light and shadow at the\r\nfoot of the big trees, but the murmur of tender words lingered over the\r\nempty clearing, grew faint, and died out.  A sigh as of immense sorrow\r\npassed over the land in the last effort of the dying breeze, and in the\r\ndeep silence which succeeded, the earth and the heavens were suddenly\r\nhushed up in the mournful contemplation of human love and human\r\nblindness.\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly back to the fire.  He made for her a seat out of the\r\ndry branches, and, throwing himself down at her feet, lay his head in her\r\nlap and gave himself up to the dreamy delight of the passing hour.  Their\r\nvoices rose and fell, tender or animated as they spoke of their love and\r\nof their future.  She, with a few skilful words spoken from time to time,\r\nguided his thoughts, and he let his happiness flow in a stream of talk\r\npassionate and tender, grave or menacing, according to the mood which she\r\nevoked.  He spoke to her of his own island, where the gloomy forests and\r\nthe muddy rivers were unknown.  He spoke of its terraced fields, of the\r\nmurmuring clear rills of sparkling water that flowed down the sides of\r\ngreat mountains, bringing life to the land and joy to its tillers.  And\r\nhe spoke also of the mountain peak that rising lonely above the belt of\r\ntrees knew the secrets of the passing clouds, and was the dwelling-place\r\nof the mysterious spirit of his race, of the guardian genius of his\r\nhouse.  He spoke of vast horizons swept by fierce winds that whistled\r\nhigh above the summits of burning mountains.  He spoke of his forefathers\r\nthat conquered ages ago the island of which he was to be the future\r\nruler.  And then as, in her interest, she brought her face nearer to his,\r\nhe, touching lightly the thick tresses of her long hair, felt a sudden\r\nimpulse to speak to her of the sea he loved so well; and he told her of\r\nits never-ceasing voice, to which he had listened as a child, wondering\r\nat its hidden meaning that no living man has penetrated yet; of its\r\nenchanting glitter; of its senseless and capricious fury; how its surface\r\nwas for ever changing, and yet always enticing, while its depths were for\r\never the same, cold and cruel, and full of the wisdom of destroyed life.\r\nHe told her how it held men slaves of its charm for a lifetime, and then,\r\nregardless of their devotion, swallowed them up, angry at their fear of\r\nits mystery, which it would never disclose, not even to those that loved\r\nit most.  While he talked, Nina\'s head had been gradually sinking lower,\r\nand her face almost touched his now.  Her hair was over his eyes, her\r\nbreath was on his forehead, her arms were about his body.  No two beings\r\ncould be closer to each other, yet she guessed rather than understood the\r\nmeaning of his last words that came out after a slight hesitation in a\r\nfaint murmur, dying out imperceptibly into a profound and significant\r\nsilence:  "The sea, O Nina, is like a woman\'s heart."\r\n\r\nShe closed his lips with a sudden kiss, and answered in a steady voice--\r\n\r\n"But to the men that have no fear, O master of my life, the sea is ever\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\nOver their heads a film of dark, thread-like clouds, looking like immense\r\ncobwebs drifting under the stars, darkened the sky with the presage of\r\nthe coming thunderstorm.  From the invisible hills the first distant\r\nrumble of thunder came in a prolonged roll which, after tossing about\r\nfrom hill to hill, lost itself in the forests of the Pantai.  Dain and\r\nNina stood up, and the former looked at the sky uneasily.\r\n\r\n"It is time for Babalatchi to be here," he said.  "The night is more than\r\nhalf gone.  Our road is long, and a bullet travels quicker than the best\r\ncanoe."\r\n\r\n"He will be here before the moon is hidden behind the clouds," said Nina.\r\n"I heard a splash in the water," she added.  "Did you hear it too?"\r\n\r\n"Alligator," answered Dain shortly, with a careless glance towards the\r\ncreek.  "The darker the night," he continued, "the shorter will be our\r\nroad, for then we could keep in the current of the main stream, but if it\r\nis light--even no more than now--we must follow the small channels of\r\nsleeping water, with nothing to help our paddles."\r\n\r\n"Dain," interposed Nina, earnestly, "it was no alligator.  I heard the\r\nbushes rustling near the landing-place."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dain, after listening awhile.  "It cannot be Babalatchi, who\r\nwould come in a big war canoe, and openly.  Those that are coming,\r\nwhoever they are, do not wish to make much noise.  But you have heard,\r\nand now I can see," he went on quickly.  "It is but one man.  Stand\r\nbehind me, Nina.  If he is a friend he is welcome; if he is an enemy you\r\nshall see him die."\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on his kriss, and awaited the approach of his unexpected\r\nvisitor.  The fire was burning very low, and small clouds--precursors of\r\nthe storm--crossed the face of the moon in rapid succession, and their\r\nflying shadows darkened the clearing.  He could not make out who the man\r\nmight be, but he felt uneasy at the steady advance of the tall figure\r\nwalking on the path with a heavy tread, and hailed it with a command to\r\nstop.  The man stopped at some little distance, and Dain expected him to\r\nspeak, but all he could hear was his deep breathing.  Through a break in\r\nthe flying clouds a sudden and fleeting brightness descended upon the\r\nclearing.  Before the darkness closed in again, Dain saw a hand holding\r\nsome glittering object extended towards him, heard Nina\'s cry of\r\n"Father!" and in an instant the girl was between him and Almayer\'s\r\nrevolver.  Nina\'s loud cry woke up the echoes of the sleeping woods, and\r\nthe three stood still as if waiting for the return of silence before they\r\nwould give expression to their various feelings.  At the appearance of\r\nNina, Almayer\'s arm fell by his side, and he made a step forward.  Dain\r\npushed the girl gently aside.\r\n\r\n"Am I a wild beast that you should try to kill me suddenly and in the\r\ndark, Tuan Almayer?" said Dain, breaking the strained silence.  "Throw\r\nsome brushwood on the fire," he went on, speaking to Nina, "while I watch\r\nmy white friend, lest harm should come to you or to me, O delight of my\r\nheart!"\r\n\r\nAlmayer ground his teeth and raised his arm again.  With a quick bound\r\nDain was at his side: there was a short scuffle, during which one chamber\r\nof the revolver went off harmlessly, then the weapon, wrenched out of\r\nAlmayer\'s hand, whirled through the air and fell in the bushes.  The two\r\nmen stood close together, breathing hard.  The replenished fire threw out\r\nan unsteady circle of light and shone on the terrified face of Nina, who\r\nlooked at them with outstretched hands.\r\n\r\n"Dain!" she cried out warningly, "Dain!"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand towards her in a reassuring gesture, and, turning to\r\nAlmayer, said with great courtesy--\r\n\r\n"Now we may talk, Tuan.  It is easy to send out death, but can your\r\nwisdom recall the life?  She might have been harmed," he continued,\r\nindicating Nina.  "Your hand shook much; for myself I was not afraid."\r\n\r\n"Nina!" exclaimed Almayer, "come to me at once.  What is this sudden\r\nmadness?  What bewitched you?  Come to your father, and together we shall\r\ntry to forget this horrible nightmare!"\r\n\r\nHe opened his arms with the certitude of clasping her to his breast in\r\nanother second.  She did not move.  As it dawned upon him that she did\r\nnot mean to obey he felt a deadly cold creep into his heart, and,\r\npressing the palms of his hands to his temples, he looked down on the\r\nground in mute despair.  Dain took Nina by the arm and led her towards\r\nher father.\r\n\r\n"Speak to him in the language of his people," he said.  "He is\r\ngrieving--as who would not grieve at losing thee, my pearl!  Speak to him\r\nthe last words he shall hear spoken by that voice, which must be very\r\nsweet to him, but is all my life to me."\r\n\r\nHe released her, and, stepping back a few paces out of the circle of\r\nlight, stood in the darkness looking at them with calm interest.  The\r\nreflection of a distant flash of lightning lit up the clouds over their\r\nheads, and was followed after a short interval by the faint rumble of\r\nthunder, which mingled with Almayer\'s voice as he began to speak.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what you are doing?  Do you know what is waiting for you if\r\nyou follow that man?  Have you no pity for yourself?  Do you know that\r\nyou shall be at first his plaything and then a scorned slave, a drudge,\r\nand a servant of some new fancy of that man?"\r\n\r\nShe raised her hand to stop him, and turning her head slightly, asked--\r\n\r\n"You hear this Dain!  Is it true?"\r\n\r\n"By all the gods!" came the impassioned answer from the darkness--"by\r\nheaven and earth, by my head and thine I swear: this is a white man\'s\r\nlie.  I have delivered my soul into your hands for ever; I breathe with\r\nyour breath, I see with your eyes, I think with your mind, and I take you\r\ninto my heart for ever."\r\n\r\n"You thief!" shouted the exasperated Almayer.\r\n\r\nA deep silence succeeded this outburst, then the voice of Dain was heard\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Tuan," he said in a gentle tone, "that is not true also.  The girl\r\ncame of her own will.  I have done no more but to show her my love like a\r\nman; she heard the cry of my heart, and she came, and the dowry I have\r\ngiven to the woman you call your wife."\r\n\r\nAlmayer groaned in his extremity of rage and shame.  Nina laid her hand\r\nlightly on his shoulder, and the contact, light as the touch of a falling\r\nleaf, seemed to calm him.  He spoke quickly, and in English this time.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," he said--"tell me, what have they done to you, your mother and\r\nthat man?  What made you give yourself up to that savage?  For he is a\r\nsavage.  Between him and you there is a barrier that nothing can remove.\r\nI can see in your eyes the look of those who commit suicide when they are\r\nmad.  You are mad.  Don\'t smile.  It breaks my heart.  If I were to see\r\nyou drowning before my eyes, and I without the power to help you, I could\r\nnot suffer a greater torment.  Have you forgotten the teaching of so many\r\nyears?"\r\n\r\n"No," she interrupted, "I remember it well.  I remember how it ended\r\nalso.  Scorn for scorn, contempt for contempt, hate for hate.  I am not\r\nof your race.  Between your people and me there is also a barrier that\r\nnothing can remove.  You ask why I want to go, and I ask you why I should\r\nstay."\r\n\r\nHe staggered as if struck in the face, but with a quick, unhesitating\r\ngrasp she caught him by the arm and steadied him.\r\n\r\n"Why you should stay!" he repeated slowly, in a dazed manner, and stopped\r\nshort, astounded at the completeness of his misfortune.\r\n\r\n"You told me yesterday," she went on again, "that I could not understand\r\nor see your love for me: it is so.  How can I?  No two human beings\r\nunderstand each other.  They can understand but their own voices.  You\r\nwanted me to dream your dreams, to see your own visions--the visions of\r\nlife amongst the white faces of those who cast me out from their midst in\r\nangry contempt.  But while you spoke I listened to the voice of my own\r\nself; then this man came, and all was still; there was only the murmur of\r\nhis love.  You call him a savage!  What do you call my mother, your\r\nwife?"\r\n\r\n"Nina!" cried Almayer, "take your eyes off my face."\r\n\r\nShe looked down directly, but continued speaking only a little above a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n"In time," she went on, "both our voices, that man\'s and mine, spoke\r\ntogether in a sweetness that was intelligible to our ears only.  You were\r\nspeaking of gold then, but our ears were filled with the song of our\r\nlove, and we did not hear you.  Then I found that we could see through\r\neach other\'s eyes: that he saw things that nobody but myself and he could\r\nsee.  We entered a land where no one could follow us, and least of all\r\nyou.  Then I began to live."\r\n\r\nShe paused.  Almayer sighed deeply.  With her eyes still fixed on the\r\nground she began speaking again.\r\n\r\n"And I mean to live.  I mean to follow him.  I have been rejected with\r\nscorn by the white people, and now I am a Malay!  He took me in his arms,\r\nhe laid his life at my feet.  He is brave; he will be powerful, and I\r\nhold his bravery and his strength in my hand, and I shall make him great.\r\nHis name shall be remembered long after both our bodies are laid in the\r\ndust.  I love you no less than I did before, but I shall never leave him,\r\nfor without him I cannot live."\r\n\r\n"If he understood what you have said," answered Almayer, scornfully, "he\r\nmust be highly flattered.  You want him as a tool for some\r\nincomprehensible ambition of yours.  Enough, Nina.  If you do not go down\r\nat once to the creek, where Ali is waiting with my canoe, I shall tell\r\nhim to return to the settlement and bring the Dutch officers here.  You\r\ncannot escape from this clearing, for I have cast adrift your canoe.  If\r\nthe Dutch catch this hero of yours they will hang him as sure as I stand\r\nhere.  Now go."\r\n\r\nHe made a step towards his daughter and laid hold of her by the shoulder,\r\nhis other hand pointing down the path to the landing-place.\r\n\r\n"Beware!" exclaimed Dain; "this woman belongs to me!"\r\n\r\nNina wrenched herself free and looked straight at Almayer\'s angry face.\r\n\r\n"No, I will not go," she said with desperate energy.  "If he dies I shall\r\ndie too!"\r\n\r\n"You die!" said Almayer, contemptuously.  "Oh, no!  You shall live a life\r\nof lies and deception till some other vagabond comes along to sing; how\r\ndid you say that?  The song of love to you!  Make up your mind quickly."\r\n\r\nHe waited for a while, and then added meaningly--\r\n\r\n"Shall I call out to Ali?"\r\n\r\n"Call out," she answered in Malay, "you that cannot be true to your own\r\ncountrymen.  Only a few days ago you were selling the powder for their\r\ndestruction; now you want to give up to them the man that yesterday you\r\ncalled your friend.  Oh, Dain," she said, turning towards the motionless\r\nbut attentive figure in the darkness, "instead of bringing you life I\r\nbring you death, for he will betray unless I leave you for ever!"\r\n\r\nDain came into the circle of light, and, throwing his arm around Nina\'s\r\nneck, whispered in her ear--"I can kill him where he stands, before a\r\nsound can pass his lips.  For you it is to say yes or no.  Babalatchi\r\ncannot be far now."\r\n\r\nHe straightened himself up, taking his arm off her shoulder, and\r\nconfronted Almayer, who looked at them both with an expression of\r\nconcentrated fury.\r\n\r\n"No!" she cried, clinging to Dain in wild alarm.  "No!  Kill me!  Then\r\nperhaps he will let you go.  You do not know the mind of a white man.  He\r\nwould rather see me dead than standing where I am.  Forgive me, your\r\nslave, but you must not."  She fell at his feet sobbing violently and\r\nrepeating, "Kill me!  Kill me!"\r\n\r\n"I want you alive," said Almayer, speaking also in Malay, with sombre\r\ncalmness.  "You go, or he hangs.  Will you obey?"\r\n\r\nDain shook Nina off, and, making a sudden lunge, struck Almayer full in\r\nthe chest with the handle of his kriss, keeping the point towards\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Hai, look!  It was easy for me to turn the point the other way," he said\r\nin his even voice.  "Go, Tuan Putih," he added with dignity.  "I give you\r\nyour life, my life, and her life.  I am the slave of this woman\'s desire,\r\nand she wills it so."\r\n\r\nThere was not a glimmer of light in the sky now, and the tops of the\r\ntrees were as invisible as their trunks, being lost in the mass of clouds\r\nthat hung low over the woods, the clearing, and the river.\r\n\r\nEvery outline had disappeared in the intense blackness that seemed to\r\nhave destroyed everything but space.  Only the fire glimmered like a star\r\nforgotten in this annihilation of all visible things, and nothing was\r\nheard after Dain ceased speaking but the sobs of Nina, whom he held in\r\nhis arms, kneeling beside the fire.  Almayer stood looking down at them\r\nin gloomy thoughtfulness.  As he was opening his lips to speak they were\r\nstartled by a cry of warning by the riverside, followed by the splash of\r\nmany paddles and the sound of voices.\r\n\r\n"Babalatchi!" shouted Dain, lifting up Nina as he got upon his feet\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n"Ada!  Ada!" came the answer from the panting statesman who ran up the\r\npath and stood amongst them.  "Run to my canoe," he said to Dain\r\nexcitedly, without taking any notice of Almayer.  "Run! we must go.  That\r\nwoman has told them all!"\r\n\r\n"What woman?" asked Dain, looking at Nina.  Just then there was only one\r\nwoman in the whole world for him.\r\n\r\n"The she-dog with white teeth; the seven times accursed slave of Bulangi.\r\nShe yelled at Abdulla\'s gate till she woke up all Sambir.  Now the white\r\nofficers are coming, guided by her and Reshid.  If you want to live, do\r\nnot look at me, but go!"\r\n\r\n"How do you know this?" asked Almayer.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Tuan! what matters how I know!  I have only one eye, but I saw\r\nlights in Abdulla\'s house and in his campong as we were paddling past.  I\r\nhave ears, and while we lay under the bank I have heard the messengers\r\nsent out to the white men\'s house."\r\n\r\n"Will you depart without that woman who is my daughter?" said Almayer,\r\naddressing Dain, while Babalatchi stamped with impatience, muttering,\r\n"Run!  Run at once!"\r\n\r\n"No," answered Dain, steadily, "I will not go; to no man will I abandon\r\nthis woman."\r\n\r\n"Then kill me and escape yourself," sobbed out Nina.\r\n\r\nHe clasped her close, looking at her tenderly, and whispered, "We will\r\nnever part, O Nina!"\r\n\r\n"I shall not stay here any longer," broke in Babalatchi, angrily.  "This\r\nis great foolishness.  No woman is worth a man\'s life.  I am an old man,\r\nand I know."\r\n\r\nHe picked up his staff, and, turning to go, looked at Dain as if offering\r\nhim his last chance of escape.  But Dain\'s face was hidden amongst Nina\'s\r\nblack tresses, and he did not see this last appealing glance.\r\n\r\nBabalatchi vanished in the darkness.  Shortly after his disappearance\r\nthey heard the war canoe leave the landing-place in the swish of the\r\nnumerous paddles dipped in the water together.  Almost at the same time\r\nAli came up from the riverside, two paddles on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Our canoe is hidden up the creek, Tuan Almayer," he said, "in the dense\r\nbush where the forest comes down to the water.  I took it there because I\r\nheard from Babalatchi\'s paddlers that the white men are coming here."\r\n\r\n"Wait for me there," said Almayer, "but keep the canoe hidden."\r\n\r\nHe remained silent, listening to Ali\'s footsteps, then turned to Nina.\r\n\r\n"Nina," he said sadly, "will you have no pity for me?"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.  She did not even turn her head, which was pressed\r\nclose to Dain\'s breast.\r\n\r\nHe made a movement as if to leave them and stopped.  By the dim glow of\r\nthe burning-out fire he saw their two motionless figures.  The woman\'s\r\nback turned to him with the long black hair streaming down over the white\r\ndress, and Dain\'s calm face looking at him above her head.\r\n\r\n"I cannot," he muttered to himself.  After a long pause he spoke again a\r\nlittle lower, but in an unsteady voice, "It would be too great a\r\ndisgrace.  I am a white man."  He broke down completely there, and went\r\non tearfully, "I am a white man, and of good family.  Very good family,"\r\nhe repeated, weeping bitterly.  "It would be a disgrace . . . all over\r\nthe islands, . . . the only white man on the east coast.  No, it cannot\r\nbe . . . white men finding my daughter with this Malay.  My daughter!" he\r\ncried aloud, with a ring of despair in his voice.\r\n\r\nHe recovered his composure after a while and said distinctly--\r\n\r\n"I will never forgive you, Nina--never!  If you were to come back to me\r\nnow, the memory of this night would poison all my life.  I shall try to\r\nforget.  I have no daughter.  There used to be a half-caste woman in my\r\nhouse, but she is going even now.  You, Dain, or whatever your name may\r\nbe, I shall take you and that woman to the island at the mouth of the\r\nriver myself.  Come with me."\r\n\r\nHe led the way, following the bank as far as the forest.  Ali answered to\r\nhis call, and, pushing their way through the dense bush, they stepped\r\ninto the canoe hidden under the overhanging branches.  Dain laid Nina in\r\nthe bottom, and sat holding her head on his knees.  Almayer and Ali each\r\ntook up a paddle.  As they were going to push out Ali hissed warningly.\r\nAll listened.\r\n\r\nIn the great stillness before the bursting out of the thunderstorm they\r\ncould hear the sound of oars working regularly in their row-locks.  The\r\nsound approached steadily, and Dain, looking through the branches, could\r\nsee the faint shape of a big white boat.  A woman\'s voice said in a\r\ncautious tone--\r\n\r\n"There is the place where you may land white men; a little higher--there!"\r\n\r\nThe boat was passing them so close in the narrow creek that the blades of\r\nthe long oars nearly touched the canoe.\r\n\r\n"Way enough!  Stand by to jump on shore!  He is alone and unarmed," was\r\nthe quiet order in a man\'s voice, and in Dutch.\r\n\r\nSomebody else whispered: "I think I can see a glimmer of a fire through\r\nthe bush."  And then the boat floated past them, disappearing instantly\r\nin the darkness.\r\n\r\n"Now," whispered Ali, eagerly, "let us push out and paddle away."\r\n\r\nThe little canoe swung into the stream, and as it sprung forward in\r\nresponse to the vigorous dig of the paddles they could hear an angry\r\nshout.\r\n\r\n"He is not by the fire.  Spread out, men, and search for him!"\r\n\r\nBlue lights blazed out in different parts of the clearing, and the shrill\r\nvoice of a woman cried in accents of rage and pain--\r\n\r\n"Too late!  O senseless white men!  He has escaped!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n"That is the place," said Dain, indicating with the blade of his paddle a\r\nsmall islet about a mile ahead of the canoe--"that is the place where\r\nBabalatchi promised that a boat from the prau would come for me when the\r\nsun is overhead.  We will wait for that boat there."\r\n\r\nAlmayer, who was steering, nodded without speaking, and by a slight sweep\r\nof his paddle laid the head of the canoe in the required direction.\r\n\r\nThey were just leaving the southern outlet of the Pantai, which lay\r\nbehind them in a straight and long vista of water shining between two\r\nwalls of thick verdure that ran downwards and towards each other, till at\r\nlast they joined and sank together in the far-away distance.  The sun,\r\nrising above the calm waters of the Straits, marked its own path by a\r\nstreak of light that glided upon the sea and darted up the wide reach of\r\nthe river, a hurried messenger of light and life to the gloomy forests of\r\nthe coast; and in this radiance of the sun\'s pathway floated the black\r\ncanoe heading for the islet which lay bathed in sunshine, the yellow\r\nsands of its encircling beach shining like an inlaid golden disc on the\r\npolished steel of the unwrinkled sea.  To the north and south of it rose\r\nother islets, joyous in their brilliant colouring of green and yellow,\r\nand on the main coast the sombre line of mangrove bushes ended to the\r\nsouthward in the reddish cliffs of Tanjong Mirrah, advancing into the\r\nsea, steep and shadowless under the clear, light of the early morning.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the canoe grated upon the sand as the little craft ran upon\r\nthe beach.  Ali leaped on shore and held on while Dain stepped out\r\ncarrying Nina in his arms, exhausted by the events and the long\r\ntravelling during the night.  Almayer was the last to leave the boat, and\r\ntogether with Ali ran it higher up on the beach.  Then Ali, tired out by\r\nthe long paddling, laid down in the shade of the canoe, and incontinently\r\nfell asleep.  Almayer sat sideways on the gunwale, and with his arms\r\ncrossed on his breast, looked to the southward upon the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully laying Nina down in the shade of the bushes growing in\r\nthe middle of the islet, Dain threw himself beside her and watched in\r\nsilent concern the tears that ran down from under her closed eyelids, and\r\nlost themselves in that fine sand upon which they both were lying face to\r\nface.  These tears and this sorrow were for him a profound and\r\ndisquieting mystery.  Now, when the danger was past, why should she\r\ngrieve?  He doubted her love no more than he would have doubted the fact\r\nof his own existence, but as he lay looking ardently in her face,\r\nwatching her tears, her parted lips, her very breath, he was uneasily\r\nconscious of something in her he could not understand.  Doubtless she had\r\nthe wisdom of perfect beings.  He sighed.  He felt something invisible\r\nthat stood between them, something that would let him approach her so\r\nfar, but no farther.  No desire, no longing, no effort of will or length\r\nof life could destroy this vague feeling of their difference.  With awe\r\nbut also with great pride he concluded that it was her own incomparable\r\nperfection.  She was his, and yet she was like a woman from another\r\nworld.  His!  His!  He exulted in the glorious thought; nevertheless her\r\ntears pained him.\r\n\r\nWith a wisp of her own hair which he took in his hand with timid\r\nreverence he tried in an access of clumsy tenderness to dry the tears\r\nthat trembled on her eyelashes.  He had his reward in a fleeting smile\r\nthat brightened her face for the short fraction of a second, but soon the\r\ntears fell faster than ever, and he could bear it no more.  He rose and\r\nwalked towards Almayer, who still sat absorbed in his contemplation of\r\nthe sea.  It was a very, very long time since he had seen the sea--that\r\nsea that leads everywhere, brings everything, and takes away so much.  He\r\nhad almost forgotten why he was there, and dreamily he could see all his\r\npast life on the smooth and boundless surface that glittered before his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nDain\'s hand laid on Almayer\'s shoulder recalled him with a start from\r\nsome country very far away indeed.  He turned round, but his eyes seemed\r\nto look rather at the place where Dain stood than at the man himself.\r\nDain felt uneasy under the unconscious gaze.\r\n\r\n"What?" said Almayer.\r\n\r\n"She is crying," murmured Dain, softly.\r\n\r\n"She is crying!  Why?" asked Almayer, indifferently.\r\n\r\n"I came to ask you.  My Ranee smiles when looking at the man she loves.\r\nIt is the white woman that is crying now.  You would know."\r\n\r\nAlmayer shrugged his shoulders and turned away again towards the sea.\r\n\r\n"Go, Tuan Putih," urged Dain.  "Go to her; her tears are more terrible to\r\nme than the anger of gods."\r\n\r\n"Are they?  You will see them more than once.  She told me she could not\r\nlive without you," answered Almayer, speaking without the faintest spark\r\nof expression in his face, "so it behoves you to go to her quick, for\r\nfear you may find her dead."\r\n\r\nHe burst into a loud and unpleasant laugh which made Dain stare at him\r\nwith some apprehension, but got off the gunwale of the boat and moved\r\nslowly towards Nina, glancing up at the sun as he walked.\r\n\r\n"And you go when the sun is overhead?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Tuan.  Then we go," answered Dain.\r\n\r\n"I have not long to wait," muttered Almayer.  "It is most important for\r\nme to see you go.  Both of you.  Most important," he repeated, stopping\r\nshort and looking at Dain fixedly.\r\n\r\nHe went on again towards Nina, and Dain remained behind.  Almayer\r\napproached his daughter and stood for a time looking down on her.  She\r\ndid not open her eyes, but hearing footsteps near her, murmured in a low\r\nsob, "Dain."\r\n\r\nAlmayer hesitated for a minute and then sank on the sand by her side.\r\nShe, not hearing a responsive word, not feeling a touch, opened her\r\neyes--saw her father, and sat up suddenly with a movement of terror.\r\n\r\n"Oh, father!" she murmured faintly, and in that word there was expressed\r\nregret and fear and dawning hope.\r\n\r\n"I shall never forgive you, Nina," said Almayer, in a dispassionate\r\nvoice.  "You have torn my heart from me while I dreamt of your happiness.\r\nYou have deceived me.  Your eyes that for me were like truth itself lied\r\nto me in every glance--for how long?  You know that best.  When you were\r\ncaressing my cheek you were counting the minutes to the sunset that was\r\nthe signal for your meeting with that man--there!"\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and they both sat silent side by side, not looking at each\r\nother, but gazing at the vast expanse of the sea.  Almayer\'s words had\r\ndried Nina\'s tears, and her look grew hard as she stared before her into\r\nthe limitless sheet of blue that shone limpid, unwaving, and steady like\r\nheaven itself.  He looked at it also, but his features had lost all\r\nexpression, and life in his eyes seemed to have gone out.  The face was a\r\nblank, without a sign of emotion, feeling, reason, or even knowledge of\r\nitself.  All passion, regret, grief, hope, or anger--all were gone,\r\nerased by the hand of fate, as if after this last stroke everything was\r\nover and there was no need for any record.\r\n\r\nThose few who saw Almayer during the short period of his remaining days\r\nwere always impressed by the sight of that face that seemed to know\r\nnothing of what went on within: like the blank wall of a prison enclosing\r\nsin, regrets, and pain, and wasted life, in the cold indifference of\r\nmortar and stones.\r\n\r\n"What is there to forgive?" asked Nina, not addressing Almayer directly,\r\nbut more as if arguing with herself.  "Can I not live my own life as you\r\nhave lived yours?  The path you would have wished me to follow has been\r\nclosed to me by no fault of mine."\r\n\r\n"You never told me," muttered Almayer.\r\n\r\n"You never asked me," she answered, "and I thought you were like the\r\nothers and did not care.  I bore the memory of my humiliation alone, and\r\nwhy should I tell you that it came to me because I am your daughter?  I\r\nknew you could not avenge me."\r\n\r\n"And yet I was thinking of that only," interrupted Almayer, "and I wanted\r\nto give you years of happiness for the short day of your suffering.  I\r\nonly knew of one way."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but it was not my way!" she replied.  "Could you give me happiness\r\nwithout life?  Life!" she repeated with sudden energy that sent the word\r\nringing over the sea.  "Life that means power and love," she added in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n"That!" said Almayer, pointing his finger at Dain standing close by and\r\nlooking at them in curious wonder.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that!" she replied, looking her father full in the face and\r\nnoticing for the first time with a slight gasp of fear the unnatural\r\nrigidity of his features.\r\n\r\n"I would have rather strangled you with my own hands," said Almayer, in\r\nan expressionless voice which was such a contrast to the desperate\r\nbitterness of his feelings that it surprised even himself.  He asked\r\nhimself who spoke, and, after looking slowly round as if expecting to see\r\nsomebody, turned again his eyes towards the sea.\r\n\r\n"You say that because you do not understand the meaning of my words," she\r\nsaid sadly.  "Between you and my mother there never was any love.  When I\r\nreturned to Sambir I found the place which I thought would be a peaceful\r\nrefuge for my heart, filled with weariness and hatred--and mutual\r\ncontempt.  I have listened to your voice and to her voice.  Then I saw\r\nthat you could not understand me; for was I not part of that woman?  Of\r\nher who was the regret and shame of your life?  I had to choose--I\r\nhesitated.  Why were you so blind?  Did you not see me struggling before\r\nyour eyes?  But, when he came, all doubt disappeared, and I saw only the\r\nlight of the blue and cloudless heaven--"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you the rest," interrupted Almayer:  "when that man came I\r\nalso saw the blue and the sunshine of the sky.  A thunderbolt has fallen\r\nfrom that sky, and suddenly all is still and dark around me for ever.  I\r\nwill never forgive you, Nina; and to-morrow I shall forget you!  I shall\r\nnever forgive you," he repeated with mechanical obstinacy while she sat,\r\nher head bowed down as if afraid to look at her father.\r\n\r\nTo him it seemed of the utmost importance that he should assure her of\r\nhis intention of never forgiving.  He was convinced that his faith in her\r\nhad been the foundation of his hopes, the motive of his courage, of his\r\ndetermination to live and struggle, and to be victorious for her sake.\r\nAnd now his faith was gone, destroyed by her own hands; destroyed\r\ncruelly, treacherously, in the dark; in the very moment of success.  In\r\nthe utter wreck of his affections and of all his feelings, in the chaotic\r\ndisorder of his thoughts, above the confused sensation of physical pain\r\nthat wrapped him up in a sting as of a whiplash curling round him from\r\nhis shoulders down to his feet, only one idea remained clear and\r\ndefinite--not to forgive her; only one vivid desire--to forget her.  And\r\nthis must be made clear to her--and to himself--by frequent repetition.\r\nThat was his idea of his duty to himself--to his race--to his respectable\r\nconnections; to the whole universe unsettled and shaken by this frightful\r\ncatastrophe of his life.  He saw it clearly and believed he was a strong\r\nman.  He had always prided himself upon his unflinching firmness.  And\r\nyet he was afraid.  She had been all in all to him.  What if he should\r\nlet the memory of his love for her weaken the sense of his dignity?  She\r\nwas a remarkable woman; he could see that; all the latent greatness of\r\nhis nature--in which he honestly believed--had been transfused into that\r\nslight, girlish figure.  Great things could be done!  What if he should\r\nsuddenly take her to his heart, forget his shame, and pain, and anger,\r\nand--follow her!  What if he changed his heart if not his skin and made\r\nher life easier between the two loves that would guard her from any\r\nmischance!  His heart yearned for her.  What if he should say that his\r\nlove for her was greater than . . .\r\n\r\n"I will never forgive you, Nina!" he shouted, leaping up madly in the\r\nsudden fear of his dream.\r\n\r\nThis was the last time in his life that he was heard to raise his voice.\r\nHenceforth he spoke always in a monotonous whisper like an instrument of\r\nwhich all the strings but one are broken in a last ringing clamour under\r\na heavy blow.\r\n\r\nShe rose to her feet and looked at him.  The very violence of his cry\r\nsoothed her in an intuitive conviction of his love, and she hugged to her\r\nbreast the lamentable remnants of that affection with the unscrupulous\r\ngreediness of women who cling desperately to the very scraps and rags of\r\nlove, any kind of love, as a thing that of right belongs to them and is\r\nthe very breath of their life.  She put both her hands on Almayer\'s\r\nshoulders, and looking at him half tenderly, half playfully, she said--\r\n\r\n"You speak so because you love me."\r\n\r\nAlmayer shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you do," she insisted softly; then after a short pause she added,\r\n"and you will never forget me."\r\n\r\nAlmayer shivered slightly.  She could not have said a more cruel thing.\r\n\r\n"Here is the boat coming now," said Dain, his arm outstretched towards a\r\nblack speck on the water between the coast and the islet.\r\n\r\nThey all looked at it and remained standing in silence till the little\r\ncanoe came gently on the beach and a man landed and walked towards them.\r\nHe stopped some distance off and hesitated.\r\n\r\n"What news?" asked Dain.\r\n\r\n"We have had orders secretly and in the night to take off from this islet\r\na man and a woman.  I see the woman.  Which of you is the man?"\r\n\r\n"Come, delight of my eyes," said Dain to Nina.  "Now we go, and your\r\nvoice shall be for my ears only.  You have spoken your last words to the\r\nTuan Putih, your father.  Come."\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a while, looking at Almayer, who kept his eyes steadily\r\non the sea, then she touched his forehead in a lingering kiss, and a\r\ntear--one of her tears--fell on his cheek and ran down his immovable\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Goodbye," she whispered, and remained irresolute till he pushed her\r\nsuddenly into Dain\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"If you have any pity for me," murmured Almayer, as if repeating some\r\nsentence learned by heart, "take that woman away."\r\n\r\nHe stood very straight, his shoulders thrown back, his head held high,\r\nand looked at them as they went down the beach to the canoe, walking\r\nenlaced in each other\'s arms.  He looked at the line of their footsteps\r\nmarked in the sand.  He followed their figures moving in the crude blaze\r\nof the vertical sun, in that light violent and vibrating, like a\r\ntriumphal flourish of brazen trumpets.  He looked at the man\'s brown\r\nshoulders, at the red sarong round his waist; at the tall, slender,\r\ndazzling white figure he supported.  He looked at the white dress, at the\r\nfalling masses of the long black hair.  He looked at them embarking, and\r\nat the canoe growing smaller in the distance, with rage, despair, and\r\nregret in his heart, and on his face a peace as that of a carved image of\r\noblivion.  Inwardly he felt himself torn to pieces, but Ali--who now\r\naroused--stood close to his master, saw on his features the blank\r\nexpression of those who live in that hopeless calm which sightless eyes\r\nonly can give.\r\n\r\nThe canoe disappeared, and Almayer stood motionless with his eyes fixed\r\non its wake.  Ali from under the shade of his hand examined the coast\r\ncuriously.  As the sun declined, the sea-breeze sprang up from the\r\nnorthward and shivered with its breath the glassy surface of the water.\r\n\r\n"Dapat!" exclaimed Ali, joyously.  "Got him, master!  Got prau!  Not\r\nthere!  Look more Tanah Mirrah side.  Aha!  That way!  Master, see?  Now\r\nplain.  See?"\r\n\r\nAlmayer followed Ali\'s forefinger with his eyes for a long time in vain.\r\nAt last he sighted a triangular patch of yellow light on the red\r\nbackground of the cliffs of Tanjong Mirrah.  It was the sail of the prau\r\nthat had caught the sunlight and stood out, distinct with its gay tint,\r\non the dark red of the cape.  The yellow triangle crept slowly from cliff\r\nto cliff, till it cleared the last point of land and shone brilliantly\r\nfor a fleeting minute on the blue of the open sea.  Then the prau bore up\r\nto the southward: the light went out of the sail, and all at once the\r\nvessel itself disappeared, vanishing in the shadow of the steep headland\r\nthat looked on, patient and lonely, watching over the empty sea.\r\n\r\nAlmayer never moved.  Round the little islet the air was full of the talk\r\nof the rippling water.  The crested wavelets ran up the beach\r\naudaciously, joyously, with the lightness of young life, and died\r\nquickly, unresistingly, and graciously, in the wide curves of transparent\r\nfoam on the yellow sand.  Above, the white clouds sailed rapidly\r\nsouthwards as if intent upon overtaking something.  Ali seemed anxious.\r\n\r\n"Master," he said timidly, "time to get house now.  Long way off to pull.\r\nAll ready, sir."\r\n\r\n"Wait," whispered Almayer.\r\n\r\nNow she was gone his business was to forget, and he had a strange notion\r\nthat it should be done systematically and in order.  To Ali\'s great\r\ndismay he fell on his hands and knees, and, creeping along the sand,\r\nerased carefully with his hand all traces of Nina\'s footsteps.  He piled\r\nup small heaps of sand, leaving behind him a line of miniature graves\r\nright down to the water.  After burying the last slight imprint of Nina\'s\r\nslipper he stood up, and, turning his face towards the headland where he\r\nhad last seen the prau, he made an effort to shout out loud again his\r\nfirm resolve to never forgive.  Ali watching him uneasily saw only his\r\nlips move, but heard no sound.  He brought his foot down with a stamp.  He\r\nwas a firm man--firm as a rock.  Let her go.  He never had a daughter.  He\r\nwould forget.  He was forgetting already.\r\n\r\nAli approached him again, insisting on immediate departure, and this time\r\nhe consented, and they went together towards their canoe, Almayer\r\nleading.  For all his firmness he looked very dejected and feeble as he\r\ndragged his feet slowly through the sand on the beach; and by his\r\nside--invisible to Ali--stalked that particular fiend whose mission it is\r\nto jog the memories of men, lest they should forget the meaning of life.\r\nHe whispered into Almayer\'s ear a childish prattle of many years ago.\r\nAlmayer, his head bent on one side, seemed to listen to his invisible\r\ncompanion, but his face was like the face of a man that has died struck\r\nfrom behind--a face from which all feelings and all expression are\r\nsuddenly wiped off by the hand of unexpected death.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThey slept on the river that night, mooring their canoe under the bushes\r\nand lying down in the bottom side by side, in the absolute exhaustion\r\nthat kills hunger, thirst, all feeling and all thought in the\r\noverpowering desire for that deep sleep which is like the temporary\r\nannihilation of the tired body.  Next day they started again and fought\r\ndoggedly with the current all the morning, till about midday they reached\r\nthe settlement and made fast their little craft to the jetty of Lingard\r\nand Co.  Almayer walked straight to the house, and Ali followed, paddles\r\non shoulder, thinking that he would like to eat something.  As they\r\ncrossed the front courtyard they noticed the abandoned look of the place.\r\nAli looked in at the different servants\' houses: all were empty.  In the\r\nback courtyard there was the same absence of sound and life.  In the\r\ncooking-shed the fire was out and the black embers were cold.  A tall,\r\nlean man came stealthily out of the banana plantation, and went away\r\nrapidly across the open space looking at them with big, frightened eyes\r\nover his shoulder.  Some vagabond without a master; there were many such\r\nin the settlement, and they looked upon Almayer as their patron.  They\r\nprowled about his premises and picked their living there, sure that\r\nnothing worse could befall them than a shower of curses when they got in\r\nthe way of the white man, whom they trusted and liked, and called a fool\r\namongst themselves.  In the house, which Almayer entered through the back\r\nverandah, the only living thing that met his eyes was his small monkey\r\nwhich, hungry and unnoticed for the last two days, began to cry and\r\ncomplain in monkey language as soon as it caught sight of the familiar\r\nface.  Almayer soothed it with a few words and ordered Ali to bring in\r\nsome bananas, then while Ali was gone to get them he stood in the doorway\r\nof the front verandah looking at the chaos of overturned furniture.\r\nFinally he picked up the table and sat on it while the monkey let itself\r\ndown from the roof-stick by its chain and perched on his shoulder.  When\r\nthe bananas came they had their breakfast together; both hungry, both\r\neating greedily and showering the skins round them recklessly, in the\r\ntrusting silence of perfect friendship.  Ali went away, grumbling, to\r\ncook some rice himself, for all the women about the house had\r\ndisappeared; he did not know where.  Almayer did not seem to care, and,\r\nafter he finished eating, he sat on the table swinging his legs and\r\nstaring at the river as if lost in thought.\r\n\r\nAfter some time he got up and went to the door of a room on the right of\r\nthe verandah.  That was the office.  The office of Lingard and Co.  He\r\nvery seldom went in there.  There was no business now, and he did not\r\nwant an office.  The door was locked, and he stood biting his lower lip,\r\ntrying to think of the place where the key could be.  Suddenly he\r\nremembered: in the women\'s room hung upon a nail.  He went over to the\r\ndoorway where the red curtain hung down in motionless folds, and\r\nhesitated for a moment before pushing it aside with his shoulder as if\r\nbreaking down some solid obstacle.  A great square of sunshine entering\r\nthrough the window lay on the floor.  On the left he saw Mrs. Almayer\'s\r\nbig wooden chest, the lid thrown back, empty; near it the brass nails of\r\nNina\'s European trunk shone in the large initials N. A. on the cover.  A\r\nfew of Nina\'s dresses hung on wooden pegs, stiffened in a look of\r\noffended dignity at their abandonment.  He remembered making the pegs\r\nhimself and noticed that they were very good pegs.  Where was the key?  He\r\nlooked round and saw it near the door where he stood.  It was red with\r\nrust.  He felt very much annoyed at that, and directly afterwards\r\nwondered at his own feeling.  What did it matter?  There soon would be no\r\nkey--no door--nothing!  He paused, key in hand, and asked himself whether\r\nhe knew well what he was about.  He went out again on the verandah and\r\nstood by the table thinking.  The monkey jumped down, and, snatching a\r\nbanana skin, absorbed itself in picking it to shreds industriously.\r\n\r\n"Forget!" muttered Almayer, and that word started before him a sequence\r\nof events, a detailed programme of things to do.  He knew perfectly well\r\nwhat was to be done now.  First this, then that, and then forgetfulness\r\nwould come easy.  Very easy.  He had a fixed idea that if he should not\r\nforget before he died he would have to remember to all eternity.  Certain\r\nthings had to be taken out of his life, stamped out of sight, destroyed,\r\nforgotten.  For a long time he stood in deep thought, lost in the\r\nalarming possibilities of unconquerable memory, with the fear of death\r\nand eternity before him.  "Eternity!" he said aloud, and the sound of\r\nthat word recalled him out of his reverie.  The monkey started, dropped\r\nthe skin, and grinned up at him amicably.\r\n\r\nHe went towards the office door and with some difficulty managed to open\r\nit.  He entered in a cloud of dust that rose under his feet.\r\n\r\nBooks open with torn pages bestrewed the floor; other books lay about\r\ngrimy and black, looking as if they had never been opened.  Account\r\nbooks.  In those books he had intended to keep day by day a record of his\r\nrising fortunes.  Long time ago.  A very long time.  For many years there\r\nhas been no record to keep on the blue and red ruled pages!  In the\r\nmiddle of the room the big office desk, with one of its legs broken,\r\ncareened over like the hull of a stranded ship; most of the drawers had\r\nfallen out, disclosing heaps of paper yellow with age and dirt.  The\r\nrevolving office chair stood in its place, but he found the pivot set\r\nfast when he tried to turn it.  No matter.  He desisted, and his eyes\r\nwandered slowly from object to object.  All those things had cost a lot\r\nof money at the time.  The desk, the paper, the torn books, and the\r\nbroken shelves, all under a thick coat of dust.  The very dust and bones\r\nof a dead and gone business.  He looked at all these things, all that was\r\nleft after so many years of work, of strife, of weariness, of\r\ndiscouragement, conquered so many times.  And all for what?  He stood\r\nthinking mournfully of his past life till he heard distinctly the clear\r\nvoice of a child speaking amongst all this wreck, ruin, and waste.  He\r\nstarted with a great fear in his heart, and feverishly began to rake in\r\nthe papers scattered on the floor, broke the chair into bits, splintered\r\nthe drawers by banging them against the desk, and made a big heap of all\r\nthat rubbish in one corner of the room.\r\n\r\nHe came out quickly, slammed the door after him, turned the key, and,\r\ntaking it out, ran to the front rail of the verandah, and, with a great\r\nswing of his arm, sent the key whizzing into the river.  This done he\r\nwent back slowly to the table, called the monkey down, unhooked its\r\nchain, and induced it to remain quiet in the breast of his jacket.  Then\r\nhe sat again on the table and looked fixedly at the door of the room he\r\nhad just left.  He listened also intently.  He heard a dry sound of\r\nrustling; sharp cracks as of dry wood snapping; a whirr like of a bird\'s\r\nwings when it rises suddenly, and then he saw a thin stream of smoke come\r\nthrough the keyhole.  The monkey struggled under his coat.  Ali appeared\r\nwith his eyes starting out of his head.\r\n\r\n"Master!  House burn!" he shouted.\r\n\r\nAlmayer stood up holding by the table.  He could hear the yells of alarm\r\nand surprise in the settlement.  Ali wrung his hands, lamenting aloud.\r\n\r\n"Stop this noise, fool!" said Almayer, quietly.  "Pick up my hammock and\r\nblankets and take them to the other house.  Quick, now!"\r\n\r\nThe smoke burst through the crevices of the door, and Ali, with the\r\nhammock in his arms, cleared in one bound the steps of the verandah.\r\n\r\n"It has caught well," muttered Almayer to himself.  "Be quiet, Jack," he\r\nadded, as the monkey made a frantic effort to escape from its\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nThe door split from top to bottom, and a rush of flame and smoke drove\r\nAlmayer away from the table to the front rail of the verandah.  He held\r\non there till a great roar overhead assured him that the roof was ablaze.\r\nThen he ran down the steps of the verandah, coughing, half choked with\r\nthe smoke that pursued him in bluish wreaths curling about his head.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the ditch, separating Almayer\'s courtyard from the\r\nsettlement, a crowd of the inhabitants of Sambir looked at the burning\r\nhouse of the white man.  In the calm air the flames rushed up on high,\r\ncoloured pale brick-red, with violet gleams in the strong sunshine.  The\r\nthin column of smoke ascended straight and unwavering till it lost itself\r\nin the clear blue of the sky, and, in the great empty space between the\r\ntwo houses the interested spectators could see the tall figure of the\r\nTuan Putih, with bowed head and dragging feet, walking slowly away from\r\nthe fire towards the shelter of "Almayer\'s Folly."\r\n\r\nIn that manner did Almayer move into his new house.  He took possession\r\nof the new ruin, and in the undying folly of his heart set himself to\r\nwait in anxiety and pain for that forgetfulness which was so slow to\r\ncome.  He had done all he could.  Every vestige of Nina\'s existence had\r\nbeen destroyed; and now with every sunrise he asked himself whether the\r\nlonged-for oblivion would come before sunset, whether it would come\r\nbefore he died?  He wanted to live only long enough to be able to forget,\r\nand the tenacity of his memory filled him with dread and horror of death;\r\nfor should it come before he could accomplish the purpose of his life he\r\nwould have to remember for ever!  He also longed for loneliness.  He\r\nwanted to be alone.  But he was not.  In the dim light of the rooms with\r\ntheir closed shutters, in the bright sunshine of the verandah, wherever\r\nhe went, whichever way he turned, he saw the small figure of a little\r\nmaiden with pretty olive face, with long black hair, her little pink robe\r\nslipping off her shoulders, her big eyes looking up at him in the tender\r\ntrustfulness of a petted child.  Ali did not see anything, but he also\r\nwas aware of the presence of a child in the house.  In his long talks by\r\nthe evening fires of the settlement he used to tell his intimate friends\r\nof Almayer\'s strange doings.  His master had turned sorcerer in his old\r\nage.  Ali said that often when Tuan Putih had retired for the night he\r\ncould hear him talking to something in his room.  Ali thought that it was\r\na spirit in the shape of a child.  He knew his master spoke to a child\r\nfrom certain expressions and words his master used.  His master spoke in\r\nMalay a little, but mostly in English, which he, Ali, could understand.\r\nMaster spoke to the child at times tenderly, then he would weep over it,\r\nlaugh at it, scold it, beg of it to go away; curse it.  It was a bad and\r\nstubborn spirit.  Ali thought his master had imprudently called it up,\r\nand now could not get rid of it.  His master was very brave; he was not\r\nafraid to curse this spirit in the very Presence; and once he fought with\r\nit.  Ali had heard a great noise as of running about inside the room and\r\ngroans.  His master groaned.  Spirits do not groan.  His master was\r\nbrave, but foolish.  You cannot hurt a spirit.  Ali expected to find his\r\nmaster dead next morning, but he came out very early, looking much older\r\nthan the day before, and had no food all day.\r\n\r\nSo far Ali to the settlement.  To Captain Ford he was much more\r\ncommunicative, for the good reason that Captain Ford had the purse and\r\ngave orders.  On each of Ford\'s monthly visits to Sambir Ali had to go on\r\nboard with a report about the inhabitant of "Almayer\'s Folly."  On his\r\nfirst visit to Sambir, after Nina\'s departure, Ford had taken charge of\r\nAlmayer\'s affairs.  They were not cumbersome.  The shed for the storage\r\nof goods was empty, the boats had disappeared, appropriated--generally in\r\nnight-time--by various citizens of Sambir in need of means of transport.\r\nDuring a great flood the jetty of Lingard and Co. left the bank and\r\nfloated down the river, probably in search of more cheerful surroundings;\r\neven the flock of geese--"the only geese on the east coast"--departed\r\nsomewhere, preferring the unknown dangers of the bush to the desolation\r\nof their old home.  As time went on the grass grew over the black patch\r\nof ground where the old house used to stand, and nothing remained to mark\r\nthe place of the dwelling that had sheltered Almayer\'s young hopes, his\r\nfoolish dream of splendid future, his awakening, and his despair.\r\n\r\nFord did not often visit Almayer, for visiting Almayer was not a pleasant\r\ntask.  At first he used to respond listlessly to the old seaman\'s\r\nboisterous inquiries about his health; he even made efforts to talk,\r\nasking for news in a voice that made it perfectly clear that no news from\r\nthis world had any interest for him.  Then gradually he became more\r\nsilent--not sulkily--but as if he was forgetting how to speak.  He used\r\nalso to hide in the darkest rooms of the house, where Ford had to seek\r\nhim out guided by the patter of the monkey galloping before him.  The\r\nmonkey was always there to receive and introduce Ford.  The little animal\r\nseemed to have taken complete charge of its master, and whenever it\r\nwished for his presence on the verandah it would tug perseveringly at his\r\njacket, till Almayer obediently came out into the sunshine, which he\r\nseemed to dislike so much.\r\n\r\nOne morning Ford found him sitting on the floor of the verandah, his back\r\nagainst the wall, his legs stretched stiffly out, his arms hanging by his\r\nside.  His expressionless face, his eyes open wide with immobile pupils,\r\nand the rigidity of his pose, made him look like an immense man-doll\r\nbroken and flung there out of the way.  As Ford came up the steps he\r\nturned his head slowly.\r\n\r\n"Ford," he murmured from the floor, "I cannot forget."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you?" said Ford, innocently, with an attempt at joviality: "I wish\r\nI was like you.  I am losing my memory--age, I suppose; only the other\r\nday my mate--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, for Almayer had got up, stumbled, and steadied himself on his\r\nfriend\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"Hallo!  You are better to-day.  Soon be all right," said Ford,\r\ncheerfully, but feeling rather scared.\r\n\r\nAlmayer let go his arm and stood very straight with his head up and\r\nshoulders thrown back, looking stonily at the multitude of suns shining\r\nin ripples of the river.  His jacket and his loose trousers flapped in\r\nthe breeze on his thin limbs.\r\n\r\n"Let her go!" he whispered in a grating voice.  "Let her go.  To-morrow I\r\nshall forget.  I am a firm man, . . . firm as a . . . rock, . . . firm . . ."\r\n\r\nFord looked at his face--and fled.  The skipper was a tolerably firm man\r\nhimself--as those who had sailed with him could testify--but Almayer\'s\r\nfirmness was altogether too much for his fortitude.\r\n\r\nNext time the steamer called in Sambir Ali came on board early with a\r\ngrievance.  He complained to Ford that Jim-Eng the Chinaman had invaded\r\nAlmayer\'s house, and actually had lived there for the last month.\r\n\r\n"And they both smoke," added Ali.\r\n\r\n"Phew!  Opium, you mean?"\r\n\r\nAli nodded, and Ford remained thoughtful; then he muttered to himself,\r\n"Poor devil!  The sooner the better now."  In the afternoon he walked up\r\nto the house.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here?" he asked of Jim-Eng, whom he found strolling\r\nabout on the verandah.\r\n\r\nJim-Eng explained in bad Malay, and speaking in that monotonous,\r\nuninterested voice of an opium smoker pretty far gone, that his house was\r\nold, the roof leaked, and the floor was rotten.  So, being an old friend\r\nfor many, many years, he took his money, his opium, and two pipes, and\r\ncame to live in this big house.\r\n\r\n"There is plenty of room.  He smokes, and I live here.  He will not smoke\r\nlong," he concluded.\r\n\r\n"Where is he now?" asked Ford.\r\n\r\n"Inside.  He sleeps," answered Jim-Eng, wearily.  Ford glanced in through\r\nthe doorway.  In the dim light of the room he could see Almayer lying on\r\nhis back on the floor, his head on a wooden pillow, the long white beard\r\nscattered over his breast, the yellow skin of the face, the half-closed\r\neyelids showing the whites of the eye only. . . .\r\n\r\nHe shuddered and turned away.  As he was leaving he noticed a long strip\r\nof faded red silk, with some Chinese letters on it, which Jim-Eng had\r\njust fastened to one of the pillars.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"That," said Jim-Eng, in his colourless voice, "that is the name of the\r\nhouse.  All the same like my house.  Very good name."\r\n\r\nFord looked at him for awhile and went away.  He did not know what the\r\ncrazy-looking maze of the Chinese inscription on the red silk meant.  Had\r\nhe asked Jim-Eng, that patient Chinaman would have informed him with\r\nproper pride that its meaning was: "House of heavenly delight."\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day Babalatchi called on Captain Ford.  The\r\ncaptain\'s cabin opened on deck, and Babalatchi sat astride on the high\r\nstep, while Ford smoked his pipe on the settee inside.  The steamer was\r\nleaving next morning, and the old statesman came as usual for a last\r\nchat.\r\n\r\n"We had news from Bali last moon," remarked Babalatchi.  "A grandson is\r\nborn to the old Rajah, and there is great rejoicing."\r\n\r\nFord sat up interested.\r\n\r\n"Yes," went on Babalatchi, in answer to Ford\'s look.  "I told him.  That\r\nwas before he began to smoke."\r\n\r\n"Well, and what?" asked Ford.\r\n\r\n"I escaped with my life," said Babalatchi, with perfect gravity, "because\r\nthe white man is very weak and fell as he rushed upon me."  Then, after a\r\npause, he added, "She is mad with joy."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Almayer, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she lives in our Rajah\'s house.  She will not die soon.  Such women\r\nlive a long time," said Babalatchi, with a slight tinge of regret in his\r\nvoice.  "She has dollars, and she has buried them, but we know where.  We\r\nhad much trouble with those people.  We had to pay a fine and listen to\r\nthreats from the white men, and now we have to be careful."  He sighed\r\nand remained silent for a long while.  Then with energy:\r\n\r\n"There will be fighting.  There is a breath of war on the islands.  Shall\r\nI live long enough to see? . . . Ah, Tuan!" he went on, more quietly,\r\n"the old times were best.  Even I have sailed with Lanun men, and boarded\r\nin the night silent ships with white sails.  That was before an English\r\nRajah ruled in Kuching. Then we fought amongst ourselves and were happy.\r\nNow when we fight with you we can only die!"\r\n\r\nHe rose to go.  "Tuan," he said, "you remember the girl that man Bulangi\r\nhad?  Her that caused all the trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ford.  "What of her?"\r\n\r\n"She grew thin and could not work.  Then Bulangi, who is a thief and a\r\npig-eater, gave her to me for fifty dollars.  I sent her amongst my women\r\nto grow fat.  I wanted to hear the sound of her laughter, but she must\r\nhave been bewitched, and . . . she died two days ago.  Nay, Tuan.  Why do\r\nyou speak bad words?  I am old--that is true--but why should I not like\r\nthe sight of a young face and the sound of a young voice in my house?"  He\r\npaused, and then added with a little mournful laugh, "I am like a white\r\nman talking too much of what is not men\'s talk when they speak to one\r\nanother."\r\n\r\nAnd he went off looking very sad.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe crowd massed in a semicircle before the steps of "Almayer\'s Folly,"\r\nswayed silently backwards and forwards, and opened out before the group\r\nof white-robed and turbaned men advancing through the grass towards the\r\nhouse.  Abdulla walked first, supported by Reshid and followed by all the\r\nArabs in Sambir.  As they entered the lane made by the respectful throng\r\nthere was a subdued murmur of voices, where the word "Mati" was the only\r\none distinctly audible.  Abdulla stopped and looked round slowly.\r\n\r\n"Is he dead?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"May you live!" answered the crowd in one shout, and then there succeeded\r\na breathless silence.\r\n\r\nAbdulla made a few paces forward and found himself for the last time face\r\nto face with his old enemy.  Whatever he might have been once he was not\r\ndangerous now, lying stiff and lifeless in the tender light of the early\r\nday.  The only white man on the east coast was dead, and his soul,\r\ndelivered from the trammels of his earthly folly, stood now in the\r\npresence of Infinite Wisdom.  On the upturned face there was that serene\r\nlook which follows the sudden relief from anguish and pain, and it\r\ntestified silently before the cloudless heaven that the man lying there\r\nunder the gaze of indifferent eyes had been permitted to forget before he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nAbdulla looked down sadly at this Infidel he had fought so long and had\r\nbested so many times.  Such was the reward of the Faithful!  Yet in the\r\nArab\'s old heart there was a feeling of regret for that thing gone out of\r\nhis life.  He was leaving fast behind him friendships, and enmities,\r\nsuccesses, and disappointments--all that makes up a life; and before him\r\nwas only the end.  Prayer would fill up the remainder of the days\r\nallotted to the True Believer!  He took in his hand the beads that hung\r\nat his waist.\r\n\r\n"I found him here, like this, in the morning," said Ali, in a low and\r\nawed voice.\r\n\r\nAbdulla glanced coldly once more at the serene face.\r\n\r\n"Let us go," he said, addressing Reshid.\r\n\r\nAnd as they passed through the crowd that fell back before them, the\r\nbeads in Abdulla\'s hand clicked, while in a solemn whisper he breathed\r\nout piously the name of Allah!  The Merciful!  The Compassionate!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALMAYER\'S FOLLY***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 720.txt or 720.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/7/2/720\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
