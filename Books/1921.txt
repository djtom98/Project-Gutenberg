AN AMBUSCADE\r\n\r\nEarly in the year VIII., at the beginning of Vendemiaire, or, to conform\r\nto our own calendar, towards the close of September, 1799, a hundred or\r\nso of peasants and a large number of citizens, who had left Fougeres in\r\nthe morning on their way to Mayenne, were going up the little mountain\r\nof La Pelerine, half-way between Fougeres and Ernee, a small town where\r\ntravellers along that road are in the habit of resting. This company,\r\ndivided into groups that were more or less numerous, presented a\r\ncollection of such fantastic costumes and a mixture of individuals\r\nbelonging to so many and diverse localities and professions that it will\r\nbe well to describe their characteristic differences, in order to give\r\nto this history the vivid local coloring to which so much value is\r\nattached in these days,--though some critics do assert that it injures\r\nthe representation of sentiments.\r\n\r\nMany of the peasants, in fact the greater number, were barefooted, and\r\nwore no other garments than a large goatskin, which covered them from\r\nthe neck to the knees, and trousers of white and very coarse linen, the\r\nill-woven texture of which betrayed the slovenly industrial habits of\r\nthe region. The straight locks of their long hair mingling with those\r\nof the goatskin hid their faces, which were bent on the ground, so\r\ncompletely that the garment might have been thought their own skin,\r\nand they themselves mistaken at first sight for a species of the animal\r\nwhich served them as clothing. But through this tangle of hair their\r\neyes were presently seen to shine like dew-drops in a thicket, and their\r\nglances, full of human intelligence, caused fear rather than pleasure to\r\nthose who met them. Their heads were covered with a dirty head-gear of\r\nred flannel, not unlike the Phrygian cap which the Republic had lately\r\nadopted as an emblem of liberty. Each man carried over his shoulder a\r\nheavy stick of knotted oak, at the end of which hung a linen bag with\r\nlittle in it. Some wore, over the red cap, a coarse felt hat, with a\r\nbroad brim adorned by a sort of woollen chenille of many colors which\r\nwas fastened round it. Others were clothed entirely in the coarse linen\r\nof which the trousers and wallets of all were made, and showed nothing\r\nthat was distinctive of the new order of civilization. Their long\r\nhair fell upon the collar of a round jacket with square pockets, which\r\nreached to the hips only, a garment peculiar to the peasantry of western\r\nFrance. Beneath this jacket, which was worn open, a waistcoat of the\r\nsame linen with large buttons was visible. Some of the company marched\r\nin wooden shoes; others, by way of economy, carried them in their hand.\r\nThis costume, soiled by long usage, blackened with sweat and dust, and\r\nless original than that of the other men, had the historic merit of\r\nserving as a transition between the goatskins and the brilliant, almost\r\nsumptuous, dress of a few individuals dispersed here and there among the\r\ngroups, where they shone like flowers. In fact, the blue linen trousers\r\nof these last, and their red or yellow waistcoats, adorned with two\r\nparallel rows of brass buttons and not unlike breast-plates, stood out\r\nas vividly among the white linen and shaggy skins of their companions as\r\nthe corn-flowers and poppies in a wheat-field. Some of them wore wooden\r\nshoes, which the peasants of Brittany make for themselves; but the\r\ngreater number had heavy hobnailed boots, and coats of coarse cloth cut\r\nin the fashion of the old regime, the shape of which the peasants have\r\nreligiously retained even to the present day. The collars of their\r\nshirts were held together by buttons in the shape of hearts or anchors.\r\nThe wallets of these men seemed to be better than those of their\r\ncompanions, and several of them added to their marching outfit a flask,\r\nprobably full of brandy, slung round their necks by a bit of twine. A\r\nfew burgesses were to be seen in the midst of these semi-savages, as if\r\nto show the extremes of civilization in this region. Wearing round hats,\r\nor flapping brims or caps, high-topped boots, or shoes and gaiters, they\r\nexhibited as many and as remarkable differences in their costume as the\r\npeasants themselves. About a dozen of them wore the republican jacket\r\nknown by the name of "la carmagnole." Others, well-to-do mechanics, no\r\ndoubt, were clothed from head to foot in one color. Those who had most\r\npretension to their dress wore swallow-tail coats or surtouts of blue\r\nor green cloth, more or less defaced. These last, evidently characters,\r\nmarched in boots of various kinds, swinging heavy canes with the air and\r\nmanner of those who take heart under misfortune. A few heads carefully\r\npowdered, and some queues tolerably well braided showed the sort of\r\ncare which a beginning of education or prosperity inspires. A casual\r\nspectator observing these men, all surprised to find themselves in one\r\nanother\'s company, would have thought them the inhabitants of a village\r\ndriven out by a conflagration. But the period and the region in which\r\nthey were gave an altogether different interest to this body of men.\r\nAny one initiated into the secrets of the civil discords which were then\r\nagitating the whole of France could easily have distinguished the few\r\nindividuals on whose fidelity the Republic might count among these\r\ngroups, almost entirely made up of men who four years earlier were at\r\nwar with her.\r\n\r\nOne other and rather noticeable sign left no doubt upon the opinions\r\nwhich divided the detachment. The Republicans alone marched with an air\r\nof gaiety. As to the other individuals of the troop, if their clothes\r\nshowed marked differences, their faces at least and their attitudes wore\r\na uniform expression of ill-fortune. Citizens and peasantry, their faces\r\nall bore the imprint of deepest melancholy; their silence had something\r\nsullen in it; they all seemed crushed under the yoke of a single\r\nthought, terrible no doubt but carefully concealed, for their faces were\r\nimpenetrable, the slowness of their gait alone betraying their inward\r\ncommunings. From time to time a few of them, noticeable for the rosaries\r\nhanging from their necks (dangerous as it was to carry that sign of a\r\nreligion which was suppressed, rather than abolished) shook their long\r\nhair and raised their heads defiantly. They covertly examined the woods,\r\nand paths, and masses of rock which flanked the road, after the manner\r\nof a dog with his nose to the wind trying to scent his game; and then,\r\nhearing nothing but the monotonous tramp of the silent company, they\r\nlowered their heads once more with the old expression of despair, like\r\ncriminals on their way to the galleys to live or die.\r\n\r\nThe march of this column upon Mayenne, the heterogeneous elements\r\nof which it was composed, and the divers sentiments which evidently\r\npervaded it, will explain the presence of another troop which formed the\r\nhead of the detachment. About a hundred and fifty soldiers, with arms\r\nand baggage, marched in the advance, commanded by the _chief of a\r\nhalf-brigade_. We may mention here, for the benefit of those who did\r\nnot witness the drama of the Revolution, that this title was made to\r\nsupersede that of colonel, proscribed by patriots as too aristocratic.\r\nThese soldiers belonged to a demi-brigade of infantry quartered at\r\nMayenne. During these troublous times the inhabitants of the west of\r\nFrance called all the soldiers of the Republic "Blues." This nickname\r\ncame originally from their blue and red uniforms, the memory of which is\r\nstill so fresh as to render a description superfluous. A detachment of\r\nthe Blues was therefore on this occasion escorting a body of recruits,\r\nor rather conscripts, all displeased at being taken to Mayenne where\r\nmilitary discipline was about to force upon them the uniformity of\r\nthought, clothing, and gait which they now lacked entirely.\r\n\r\nThis column was a contingent slowly and with difficulty raised in the\r\ndistrict of Fougeres, from which it was due under the levy ordered by\r\nthe executive Directory of the Republic on the preceding 10th Messidor.\r\nThe government had asked for a hundred million of francs and a hundred\r\nthousand men as immediate reinforcements for the armies then fighting\r\nthe Austrians in Italy, the Prussians in Germany, and menaced in\r\nSwitzerland by the Russians, in whom Suwarow had inspired hopes of the\r\nconquest of France. The departments of the West, known under the name\r\nof La Vendee, Brittany, and a portion of Lower Normandy, which had\r\nbeen tranquil for the last three years (thanks to the action of General\r\nHoche), after a struggle lasting nearly four, seemed to have seized this\r\nnew occasion of danger to the nation to break out again. In presence of\r\nsuch aggressions the Republic recovered its pristine energy. It provided\r\nin the first place for the defence of the threatened departments by\r\ngiving the responsibility to the loyal and patriotic portion of the\r\ninhabitants. In fact, the government in Paris, having neither troops nor\r\nmoney to send to the interior, evaded the difficulty by a parliamentary\r\ngasconade. Not being able to send material aid to the faithful citizens\r\nof the insurgent departments, it gave them its "confidence." Possibly\r\nthe government hoped that this measure, by arming the insurgents against\r\neach other, would stifle the insurrection at its birth. This ordinance,\r\nthe cause of future fatal reprisals, was thus worded: "Independent\r\ncompanies of troops shall be organized in the Western departments." This\r\nimpolitic step drove the West as a body into so hostile an attitude that\r\nthe Directory despaired of immediately subduing it. Consequently, it\r\nasked the Assemblies to pass certain special measures relating to the\r\nindependent companies authorized by the ordinance. In response to this\r\nrequest a new law had been promulgated a few days before this history\r\nbegins, organizing into regular legions the various weak and\r\nscattered companies. These legions were to bear the names of the\r\ndepartments,--Sarthe, Orne, Mayenne, Ille-et-Vilaine, Morbihan,\r\nLoire-Inferieure, and Maine-et-Loire. "These legions," said the law,\r\n"will be specially employed to fight the Chouans, and cannot, under any\r\npretence, be sent to the frontier."\r\n\r\nThe foregoing irksome details will explain both the weakness of the\r\nDirectory and the movement of this troop of men under escort of the\r\nBlues. It may not be superfluous to add that these finely patriotic\r\nDirectorial decrees had no realization beyond their insertion among the\r\nstatutes. No longer restrained, as formerly, by great moral ideas, by\r\npatriotism, nor by terror, which enforced their execution, these later\r\ndecrees of the Republic created millions and drafted soldiers without\r\nthe slightest benefit accruing to its exchequer or its armies. The\r\nmainspring of the Revolution was worn-out by clumsy handling, and the\r\napplication of the laws took the impress of circumstances instead of\r\ncontrolling them.\r\n\r\nThe departments of Mayenne and Ille-et-Vilaine were at this time under\r\nthe command of an old officer who, judging on the spot of the measures\r\nthat were most opportune to take, was anxious to wring from Brittany\r\nevery one of her contingents, more especially that of Fougeres, which\r\nwas known to be a hot-bed of "Chouannerie." He hoped by this means to\r\nweaken its strength in these formidable districts. This devoted soldier\r\nmade use of the illusory provisions of the new law to declare that he\r\nwould equip and arm at once all recruits, and he announced that he\r\nheld at their disposal the one month\'s advanced pay promised by the\r\ngovernment to these exceptional levies. Though Brittany had hitherto\r\nrefused all kinds of military service under the Republic, the levies\r\nwere made under the new law on the faith of its promises, and with such\r\npromptness that even the commander was startled. But he was one of those\r\nwary old watch-dogs who are hard to catch napping. He no sooner saw the\r\ncontingents arriving one after the other than he suspected some secret\r\nmotive for such prompt action. Possibly he was right in ascribing it\r\nto the fact of getting arms. At any rate, no sooner were the Fougeres\r\nrecruits obtained than, without delaying for laggards, he took\r\nimmediate steps to fall back towards Alencon, so as to be near a loyal\r\nneighborhood,--though the growing disaffection along the route made\r\nthe success of this measure problematical. This old officer, who, under\r\ninstruction of his superiors, kept secret the disasters of our armies in\r\nItaly and Germany and the disturbing news from La Vendee, was attempting\r\non the morning when this history begins, to make a forced march on\r\nMayenne, where he was resolved to execute the law according to his own\r\ngood pleasure, and fill the half-empty companies of his own brigade\r\nwith his Breton conscripts. The word "conscript" which later became\r\nso celebrated, had just now for the first time taken the place in the\r\ngovernment decrees of the word _requisitionnaire_ hitherto applied to\r\nall Republican recruits.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Fougeres the chief secretly issued to his own men ample\r\nsupplies of ammunition and sufficient rations of bread for the whole\r\ndetachment, so as to conceal from the conscripts the length of the march\r\nbefore them. He intended not to stop at Ernee (the last stage\r\nbefore Mayenne), where the men of the contingent might find a way of\r\ncommunicating with the Chouans who were no doubt hanging on his flanks.\r\nThe dead silence which reigned among the recruits, surprised at the\r\nmanoeuvring of the old republican, and their lagging march up the\r\nmountain excited to the very utmost the distrust and watchfulness of the\r\nchief--whose name was Hulot. All the striking points in the foregoing\r\ndescription had been to him matters of the keenest interest; he marched\r\nin silence, surrounded by five young officers, each of whom respected\r\nthe evident preoccupation of their leader. But just as Hulot reached the\r\nsummit of La Pelerine he turned his head, as if by instinct, to inspect\r\nthe anxious faces of the recruits, and suddenly broke silence. The slow\r\nadvance of the Bretons had put a distance of three or four hundred feet\r\nbetween themselves and their escort. Hulot\'s face contorted after a\r\nfashion peculiar to himself.\r\n\r\n"What the devil are those dandies up to?" he exclaimed in a sonorous\r\nvoice. "Creeping instead of marching, I call it."\r\n\r\nAt his first words the officers who accompanied him turned\r\nspasmodically, as if startled out of sleep by a sudden noise. The\r\nsergeants and corporals followed their example, and the whole company\r\npaused in its march without receiving the wished for "Halt!" Though the\r\nofficers cast a first look at the detachment, which was creeping like an\r\nelongated tortoise up the mountain of La Pelerine, these young men,\r\nall dragged, like many others, from important studies to defend their\r\ncountry, and in whom war had not yet smothered the sentiment of art,\r\nwere so much struck by the scene which lay spread before their eyes that\r\nthey made no answer to their chief\'s remark, the real significance of\r\nwhich was unknown to them. Though they had come from Fougeres, where the\r\nscene which now presented itself to their eyes is also visible (but with\r\ncertain differences caused by the change of perspective), they could not\r\nresist pausing to admire it again, like those dilettanti who enjoy all\r\nmusic the more when familiar with its construction.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of La Pelerine the traveller\'s eye can range over the\r\ngreat valley of Couesnon, at one of the farthest points of which, along\r\nthe horizon, lay the town of Fougeres. From here the officers could see,\r\nto its full extent, the basin of this intervale, as remarkable for the\r\nfertility of its soil as for the variety of its aspects. Mountains of\r\ngneiss and slate rose on all sides, like an ampitheatre, hiding their\r\nruddy flanks behind forests of oak, and forming on their declivities\r\nother and lesser valleys full of dewy freshness. These rocky heights\r\nmade a vast enclosure, circular in form, in the centre of which a meadow\r\nlay softly stretched, like the lawn of an English garden. A number\r\nof evergreen hedges, defining irregular pieces of property which were\r\nplanted with trees, gave to this carpet of verdure a character of its\r\nown, and one that is somewhat unusual among the landscapes of France; it\r\nheld the teeming secrets of many beauties in its various contrasts,\r\nthe effects of which were fine enough to arrest the eye of the most\r\nindifferent spectator.\r\n\r\nAt this particular moment the scene was brightened by the fleeting glow\r\nwith which Nature delights at times in heightening the beauty of her\r\nimperishable creations. While the detachment was crossing the valley,\r\nthe rising sun had slowly scattered the fleecy mists which float above\r\nthe meadows of a September morning. As the soldiers turned to look back,\r\nan invisible hand seemed to lift from the landscape the last of these\r\nveils--a delicate vapor, like a diaphanous gauze through which the glow\r\nof precious jewels excites our curiosity. Not a cloud could be seen on\r\nthe wide horizon to mark by its silvery whiteness that the vast blue\r\narch was the firmament; it seemed, on the contrary, a dais of silk,\r\nheld up by the summits of the mountains and placed in the atmosphere, to\r\nprotect that beautiful assemblage of fields and meadows and groves and\r\nbrooks.\r\n\r\nThe group of young officers paused to examine a scene so filled with\r\nnatural beauties. The eyes of some roved among the copses, which the\r\nsterner tints of autumn were already enriching with their russet tones,\r\ncontrasting the more with the emerald-green of the meadows in which\r\nthey grew; others took note of a different contrast, made by the ruddy\r\nfields, where the buckwheat had been cut and tied in sheaves (like\r\nstands of arms around a bivouac), adjoining other fields of rich\r\nploughed land, from which the rye was already harvested. Here and there\r\nwere dark slate roofs above which puffs of white smoke were rising. The\r\nglittering silver threads of the winding brooks caught the eye, here and\r\nthere, by one of those optic lures which render the soul--one knows not\r\nhow or why--perplexed and dreamy. The fragrant freshness of the autumn\r\nbreeze, the stronger odors of the forest, rose like a waft of incense to\r\nthe admirers of this beautiful region, who noticed with delight its\r\nrare wild-flowers, its vigorous vegetation, and its verdure, worthy of\r\nEngland, the very word being common to the two languages. A few cattle\r\ngave life to the scene, already so dramatic. The birds sang, filling the\r\nvalley with a sweet, vague melody that quivered in the air. If a quiet\r\nimagination will picture to itself these rich fluctuations of light\r\nand shade, the vaporous outline of the mountains, the mysterious\r\nperspectives which were seen where the trees gave an opening, or\r\nthe streamlets ran, or some coquettish little glade fled away in the\r\ndistance; if memory will color, as it were, this sketch, as fleeting as\r\nthe moment when it was taken, the persons for whom such pictures are\r\nnot without charm will have an imperfect image of the magic scene which\r\ndelighted the still impressionable souls of the young officers.\r\n\r\nThinking that the poor recruits must be leaving, with regret, their own\r\ncountry and their beloved customs, to die, perhaps, in foreign lands,\r\nthey involuntarily excused a tardiness their feelings comprehended.\r\nThen, with the generosity natural to soldiers, they disguised their\r\nindulgence under an apparent desire to examine into the military\r\nposition of the land. But Hulot, whom we shall henceforth call the\r\ncommandant, to avoid giving him the inharmonious title of "chief of a\r\nhalf-brigade" was one of those soldiers who, in critical moments,\r\ncannot be caught by the charms of a landscape, were they even those of\r\na terrestrial paradise. He shook his head with an impatient gesture and\r\ncontracted the thick, black eyebrows which gave so stern an expression\r\nto his face.\r\n\r\n"Why the devil don\'t they come up?" he said, for the second time, in a\r\nhoarse voice, roughened by the toils of war.\r\n\r\n"You ask why?" replied a voice.\r\n\r\nHearing these words, which seemed to issue from a horn, such as the\r\npeasants of the western valleys use to call their flocks, the commandant\r\nturned sharply round, as if pricked by a sword, and beheld, close behind\r\nhim, a personage even more fantastic in appearance than any of those who\r\nwere now being escorted to Mayenne to serve the Republic. This unknown\r\nman, short and thick-set in figure and broad-shouldered, had a head like\r\na bull, to which, in fact, he bore more than one resemblance. His nose\r\nseemed shorter than it was, on account of the thick nostrils. His full\r\nlips, drawn from the teeth which were white as snow, his large and\r\nround black eyes with their shaggy brows, his hanging ears and tawny\r\nhair,--seemed to belong far less to our fine Caucasian race than to\r\na breed of herbivorous animals. The total absence of all the usual\r\ncharacteristics of the social man made that bare head still more\r\nremarkable. The face, bronzed by the sun (its angular outlines\r\npresenting a sort of vague likeness to the granite which forms the\r\nsoil of the region), was the only visible portion of the body of this\r\nsingular being. From the neck down he was wrapped in a "sarrau" or\r\nsmock, a sort of russet linen blouse, coarser in texture than that of\r\nthe trousers of the less fortunate conscripts. This "sarrau," in which\r\nan antiquary would have recognized the "saye," or the "sayon" of the\r\nGauls, ended at his middle, where it was fastened to two leggings of\r\ngoatskin by slivers, or thongs of wood, roughly cut,--some of them still\r\ncovered with their peel or bark. These hides of the nanny-goat (to give\r\nthem the name by which they were known to the peasantry) covered his\r\nlegs and thighs, and masked all appearance of human shape. Enormous\r\nsabots hid his feet. His long and shining hair fell straight, like the\r\ngoat\'s hair, on either side of his face, being parted in the centre like\r\nthe hair of certain statues of the Middle-Ages which are still to\r\nbe seen in our cathedrals. In place of the knotty stick which the\r\nconscripts carried over their shoulders, this man held against his\r\nbreast as though it were a musket, a heavy whip, the lash of which was\r\nclosely braided and seemed to be twice as long as that of an ordinary\r\nwhip. The sudden apparition of this strange being seemed easily\r\nexplained. At first sight some of the officers took him for a recruit or\r\nconscript (the words were used indiscriminately) who had outstripped the\r\ncolumn. But the commandant himself was singularly surprised by the\r\nman\'s presence; he showed no alarm, but his face grew thoughtful.\r\nAfter looking the intruder well over, he repeated, mechanically, as if\r\npreoccupied with anxious thought: "Yes, why don\'t they come on? do you\r\nknow, you?"\r\n\r\n"Because," said the gloomy apparition, with an accent which proved his\r\ndifficulty in speaking French, "there Maine begins" (pointing with his\r\nhuge, rough hand towards Ernee), "and Bretagne ends."\r\n\r\nThen he struck the ground sharply with the handle of his heavy\r\nwhip close to the commandant\'s feet. The impression produced on the\r\nspectators by the laconic harangue of the stranger was like that of\r\na tom-tom in the midst of tender music. But the word "harangue" is\r\ninsufficient to reproduce the hatred, the desires of vengeance expressed\r\nby the haughty gesture of the hand, the brevity of the speech, and\r\nthe look of sullen and cool-blooded energy on the countenance of the\r\nspeaker. The coarseness and roughness of the man,--chopped out, as it\r\nseemed by an axe, with his rough bark still left on him,--and the stupid\r\nignorance of his features, made him seem, for the moment, like some\r\nhalf-savage demigod. He stood stock-still in a prophetic attitude, as\r\nthough he were the Genius of Brittany rising from a slumber of three\r\nyears, to renew a war in which victory could only be followed by twofold\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\n"A pretty fellow this!" thought Hulot; "he looks to me like the emissary\r\nof men who mean to argue with their muskets."\r\n\r\nHaving growled these words between his teeth, the commandant cast\r\nhis eyes in turn from the man to the valley, from the valley to the\r\ndetachment, from the detachment to the steep acclivities on the right of\r\nthe road, the ridges of which were covered with the broom and gorse of\r\nBrittany; then he suddenly turned them full on the stranger, whom he\r\nsubjected to a mute interrogation, which he ended at last by roughly\r\ndemanding, "Where do you come from?"\r\n\r\nHis eager, piercing eye strove to detect the secrets of that\r\nimpenetrable face, which never changed from the vacant, torpid\r\nexpression in which a peasant when doing nothing wraps himself.\r\n\r\n"From the country of the Gars," replied the man, without showing any\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\n"Your name?"\r\n\r\n"Marche-a-Terre."\r\n\r\n"Why do you call yourself by your Chouan name in defiance of the law?"\r\n\r\nMarche-a-Terre, to use the name he gave to himself, looked at the\r\ncommandant with so genuine an air of stupidity that the soldier believed\r\nthe man had not understood him.\r\n\r\n"Do you belong to the recruits from Fougeres?"\r\n\r\nTo this inquiry Marche-a-Terre replied by the bucolic "I don\'t know,"\r\nthe hopeless imbecility of which puts an end to all inquiry. He seated\r\nhimself by the roadside, drew from his smock a few pieces of thin, black\r\nbuckwheat-bread,--a national delicacy, the dismal delights of which none\r\nbut a Breton can understand,--and began to eat with stolid indifference.\r\nThere seemed such a total absence of all human intelligence about the\r\nman that the officers compared him in turn to the cattle browsing in\r\nthe valley pastures, to the savages of America, or the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope. Deceived by his behavior, the\r\ncommandant himself was about to turn a deaf ear to his own misgivings,\r\nwhen, casting a last prudence glance on the man whom he had taken for\r\nthe herald of an approaching carnage, he suddenly noticed that the\r\nhair, the smock, and the goatskin leggings of the stranger were full of\r\nthorns, scraps of leaves, and bits of trees and bushes, as though this\r\nChouan had lately made his way for a long distance through thickets and\r\nunderbrush. Hulot looked significantly at his adjutant Gerard who stood\r\nbeside him, pressed his hand firmly, and said in a low voice: "We came\r\nfor wool, but we shall go back sheared."\r\n\r\nThe officers looked at each other silently in astonishment.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to make a digression, or the fears of the\r\ncommandant will not be intelligible to those stay-at-home persons who\r\nare in the habit of doubting everything because they have seen nothing,\r\nand who might therefore deny the existence of Marche-a-Terre and the\r\npeasantry of the West, whose conduct, in the times we are speaking of,\r\nwas often sublime.\r\n\r\nThe word "gars" pronounced "ga" is a relic of the Celtic language. It\r\nhas passed from low Breton into French, and the word in our present\r\nspeech has more ancient associations than any other. The "gais" was the\r\nprincipal weapon of the Gauls; "gaisde" meant armed; "gais" courage;\r\n"gas," force. The word has an analogy with the Latin word "vir" man,\r\nthe root of "virtus" strength, courage. The present dissertation is\r\nexcusable as of national interest; besides, it may help to restore the\r\nuse of such words as: "gars, garcon, garconette, garce, garcette,"\r\nnow discarded from our speech as unseemly; whereas their origin is so\r\nwarlike that we shall use them from time to time in the course of this\r\nhistory. "She is a famous \'garce\'!" was a compliment little understood\r\nby Madame de Stael when it was paid to her in a little village of La\r\nVendee, where she spent a few days of her exile.\r\n\r\nBrittany is the region in all France where the manners and customs\r\nof the Gauls have left their strongest imprint. That portion of the\r\nprovince where, even to our own times, the savage life and superstitious\r\nideas of our rude ancestors still continue--if we may use the\r\nword--rampant, is called "the country of the Gars." When a canton (or\r\ndistrict) is inhabited by a number of half-savages like the one who has\r\njust appeared upon the scene, the inhabitants call them "the Gars of\r\nsuch or such a parish." This classic name is a reward for the fidelity\r\nwith which they struggle to preserve the traditions of the language and\r\nmanners of their Gaelic ancestors; their lives show to this day many\r\nremarkable and deeply embedded vestiges of the beliefs and superstitious\r\npractices of those ancient times. Feudal customs are still maintained.\r\nAntiquaries find Druidic monuments still standing. The genius of modern\r\ncivilization shrinks from forcing its way through those impenetrable\r\nprimordial forests. An unheard-of ferociousness, a brutal obstinacy, but\r\nalso a regard for the sanctity of an oath; a complete ignoring of our\r\nlaws, our customs, our dress, our modern coins, our language, but withal\r\na patriarchal simplicity and virtues that are heroic,--unite in keeping\r\nthe inhabitants of this region more impoverished as to all intellectual\r\nknowledge than the Redskins, but also as proud, as crafty, and as\r\nenduring as they. The position which Brittany occupies in the centre of\r\nEurope makes it more interesting to observe than Canada. Surrounded by\r\nlight whose beneficent warmth never reaches it, this region is like a\r\nfrozen coal left black in the middle of a glowing fire. The efforts made\r\nby several noble minds to win this glorious part of France, so rich in\r\nneglected treasures, to social life and to prosperity have all, even\r\nwhen sustained by government, come to nought against the inflexibility\r\nof a population given over to the habits of immemorial routine. This\r\nunfortunate condition is partly accounted for by the nature of the land,\r\nbroken by ravines, mountain torrents, lakes, and marshes, and bristling\r\nwith hedges or earth-works which make a sort of citadel of every field;\r\nwithout roads, without canals, and at the mercy of prejudices which\r\nscorn our modern agriculture. These will further be shown with all their\r\ndangers in our present history.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque lay of the land and the superstitions of the inhabitants\r\nprevent the formation of communities and the benefits arising from the\r\nexchange and comparison of ideas. There are no villages. The rickety\r\nbuildings which the people call homes are sparsely scattered through the\r\nwilderness. Each family lives as in a desert. The only meetings among\r\nthem are on Sundays and feast-days in the parish church. These silent\r\nassemblies, under the eye of the rector (the only ruler of these rough\r\nminds) last some hours. After listening to the awful words of the priest\r\nthey return to their noisome hovels for another week; they leave them\r\nonly to work, they return to them only to sleep. No one ever visits\r\nthem, unless it is the rector. Consequently, it was the voice of\r\nthe priesthood which roused Brittany against the Republic, and sent\r\nthousands of men, five years before this history begins, to the support\r\nof the first Chouannerie. The brothers Cottereau, whose name was given\r\nto that first uprising, were bold smugglers, plying their perilous trade\r\nbetween Laval and Fougeres. The insurrections of Brittany had nothing\r\nfine or noble about them; and it may be truly said that if La Vendee\r\nturned its brigandage into a great war, Brittany turned war into a\r\nbrigandage. The proscription of princes, the destruction of religion,\r\nfar from inspiring great sacrifices, were to the Chouans pretexts for\r\nmere pillage; and the events of this intestine warfare had all the\r\nsavage moroseness of their own natures. When the real defenders of the\r\nmonarchy came to recruit men among these ignorant and violent people\r\nthey vainly tried to give, for the honor of the white flag, some\r\ngrandeur to the enterprises which had hitherto rendered the brigands\r\nodious; the Chouans remain in history as a memorable example of the\r\ndanger of uprousing the uncivilized masses of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe sketch here made of a Breton valley and of the Breton men in the\r\ndetachment of recruits, more especially that of the "gars" who so\r\nsuddenly appeared on the summit of Mont Pelerine, gives a brief\r\nbut faithful picture of the province and its inhabitants. A trained\r\nimagination can by the help of these details obtain some idea of\r\nthe theatre of the war and of the men who were its instruments. The\r\nflowering hedges of the beautiful valleys concealed the combatants. Each\r\nfield was a fortress, every tree an ambush; the hollow trunk of each\r\nold willow hid a stratagem. The place for a fight was everywhere.\r\nSharpshooters were lurking at every turn for the Blues, whom laughing\r\nyoung girls, unmindful of their perfidy, attracted within range,--for\r\nhad they not made pilgrimages with their fathers and their brothers,\r\nimploring to be taught wiles, and receiving absolution from their\r\nwayside Virgin of rotten wood? Religion, or rather the fetichism of\r\nthese ignorant creatures, absolved such murders of remorse.\r\n\r\nThus, when the struggle had once begun, every part of the country was\r\ndangerous,--in fact, all things were full of peril, sound as well as\r\nsilence, attraction as well as fear, the family hearth or the open\r\ncountry. Treachery was everywhere, but it was treachery from conviction.\r\nThe people were savages serving God and the King after the fashion of\r\nRed Indians. To make this sketch of the struggle exact and true at all\r\npoints, the historian must add that the moment Hoche had signed his\r\npeace the whole country subsided into smiles and friendliness. Families\r\nwho were rending each other to pieces over night, were supping together\r\nwithout danger the next day.\r\n\r\nThe very moment that Commandant Hulot became aware of the secret\r\ntreachery betrayed by the hairy skins of Marche-a-Terre, he was\r\nconvinced that this peace, due to the genius of Hoche, the stability of\r\nwhich he had always doubted, was at an end. The civil war, he felt,\r\nwas about to be renewed,--doubtless more terrible than ever after a\r\ncessation of three years. The Revolution, mitigated by the events of the\r\n9th Thermidor, would doubtless return to the old terrors which had made\r\nit odious to sound minds. English gold would, as formerly, assist in the\r\nnational discords. The Republic, abandoned by young Bonaparte who had\r\nseemed to be its tutelary genius, was no longer in a condition to resist\r\nits enemies from without and from within,--the worst and most cruel\r\nof whom were the last to appear. The Civil War, already threatened\r\nby various partial uprisings, would assume a new and far more serious\r\naspect if the Chouans were now to attack so strong an escort. Such\r\nwere the reflections that filled the mind of the commander (though less\r\nsuccinctly formulated) as soon as he perceived, in the condition of\r\nMarche-a-Terre\'s clothing, the signs of an ambush carefully planned.\r\n\r\nThe silence which followed the prophetic remark of the commandant to\r\nGerard gave Hulot time to recover his self-possession. The old soldier\r\nhad been shaken. He could not hinder his brow from clouding as he felt\r\nhimself surrounded by the horrors of a warfare the atrocities of which\r\nwould have shamed even cannibals. Captain Merle and the adjutant Gerard\r\ncould not explain to themselves the evident dread on the face of their\r\nleader as he looked at Marche-a-Terre eating his bread by the side of\r\nthe road. But Hulot\'s face soon cleared; he began to rejoice in the\r\nopportunity to fight for the Republic, and he joyously vowed to escape\r\nbeing the dupe of the Chouans, and to fathom the wily and impenetrable\r\nbeing whom they had done him the honor to employ against him.\r\n\r\nBefore taking any resolution he set himself to study the position in\r\nwhich it was evident the enemy intended to surprise him. Observing that\r\nthe road where the column had halted was about to pass through a sort of\r\ngorge, short to be sure, but flanked with woods from which several paths\r\nappeared to issue, he frowned heavily, and said to his two friends, in a\r\nlow voice of some emotion:--\r\n\r\n"We\'re in a devil of a wasp\'s-nest."\r\n\r\n"What do you fear?" asked Gerard.\r\n\r\n"Fear? Yes, that\'s it, _fear_," returned the commandant. "I have always\r\nhad a fear of being shot like a dog at the edge of a wood, without a\r\nchance of crying out \'Who goes there?\'"\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said Merle, laughing, "\'Who goes there\' is all humbug."\r\n\r\n"Are we in any real danger?" asked Gerard, as much surprised by Hulot\'s\r\ncoolness as he was by his evident alarm.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said the commandant, in a low voice. "We are in the jaws of the\r\nwolf; it is as dark as a pocket; and we must get some light. Luckily,\r\nwe\'ve got the upper end of the slope!"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he moved, with his two officers, in a way to surround\r\nMarche-a-Terre, who rose quickly, pretending to think himself in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n"Stay where you are, vagabond!" said Hulot, keeping his eye on the\r\napparently indifferent face of the Breton, and giving him a push which\r\nthrew him back on the place where he had been sitting.\r\n\r\n"Friends," continued Hulot, in a low voice, speaking to the two\r\nofficers. "It is time I should tell you that it is all up with the\r\narmy in Paris. The Directory, in consequence of a disturbance in\r\nthe Assembly, has made another clean sweep of our affairs. Those\r\npentarchs,--puppets, I call them,--those directors have just lost a good\r\nblade; Bernadotte has abandoned them."\r\n\r\n"Who will take his place?" asked Gerard, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Milet-Mureau, an old blockhead. A pretty time to choose to let fools\r\nsail the ship! English rockets from all the headlands, and those cursed\r\nChouan cockchafers in the air! You may rely upon it that some one behind\r\nthose puppets pulled the wire when they saw we were getting the worst of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"How getting the worst of it?"\r\n\r\n"Our armies are beaten at all points," replied Hulot, sinking his voice\r\nstill lower. "The Chouans have intercepted two couriers; I only received\r\nmy despatches and last orders by a private messenger sent by Bernadotte\r\njust as he was leaving the ministry. Luckily, friends have written me\r\nconfidentially about this crisis. Fouche has discovered that the tyrant\r\nLouis XVIII. has been advised by traitors in Paris to send a leader to\r\nhis followers in La Vendee. It is thought that Barras is betraying\r\nthe Republic. At any rate, Pitt and the princes have sent a man, a\r\n_ci-devant_, vigorous, daring, full of talent, who intends, by uniting\r\nthe Chouans with the Vendeans, to pluck the cap of liberty from the head\r\nof the Republic. The fellow has lately landed in the Morbihan; I was the\r\nfirst to hear of it, and I sent the news to those knaves in Paris. \'The\r\nGars\' is the name he goes by. All those beasts," he added, pointing\r\nto Marche-a-Terre, "stick on names which would give a stomach-ache to\r\nhonest patriots if they bore them. The Gars is now in this district.\r\nThe presence of that fellow"--and again he signed to Marche-a-Terre--"as\r\ngood as tells me he is on our back. But they can\'t teach an old monkey\r\nto make faces; and you\'ve got to help me to get my birds safe into\r\ntheir cage, and as quick as a flash too. A pretty fool I should be if I\r\nallowed that _ci-devant_, who dares to come from London with his British\r\ngold, to trap me like a crow!"\r\n\r\nOn learning these secret circumstances, and being well aware that their\r\nleader was never unnecessarily alarmed, the two officers saw the dangers\r\nof the position. Gerard was about to ask some questions on the political\r\nstate of Paris, some details of which Hulot had evidently passed over in\r\nsilence, but a sign from his commander stopped him, and once more drew\r\nthe eyes of all three to the Chouan. Marche-a-Terre gave no sign of\r\ndisturbance at being watched. The curiosity of the two officers,\r\nwho were new to this species of warfare, was greatly excited by this\r\nbeginning of an affair which seemed to have an almost romantic interest,\r\nand they began to joke about it. But Hulot stopped them at once.\r\n\r\n"God\'s thunder!" he cried. "Don\'t smoke upon the powder-cask; wasting\r\ncourage for nothing is like carrying water in a basket. Gerard," he\r\nadded, in the ear of his adjutant, "get nearer, by degrees, to that\r\nfellow, and watch him; at the first suspicious action put your sword\r\nthrough him. As for me, I must take measures to carry on the ball if our\r\nunseen adversaries choose to open it."\r\n\r\nThe Chouan paid no attention to the movements of the young officer, and\r\ncontinued to play with his whip, and fling out the lash of it as though\r\nhe were fishing in the ditch.\r\n\r\nMeantime the commandant was saying to Merle, in a low voice: "Give ten\r\npicked men to a sergeant, and post them yourself above us on the summit\r\nof this slope, just where the path widens to a ledge; there you ought to\r\nsee the whole length of the route to Ernee. Choose a position where the\r\nroad is not flanked by woods, and where the sergeant can overlook\r\nthe country. Take Clef-des-Coeurs; he is very intelligent. This is no\r\nlaughing matter; I wouldn\'t give a farthing for our skins if we don\'t\r\nturn the odds in our favor at once."\r\n\r\nWhile Merle was executing this order with a rapidity of which he fully\r\nunderstood the importance, the commandant waved his right hand to\r\nenforce silence on the soldiers, who were standing at ease, and laughing\r\nand joking around him. With another gesture he ordered them to take up\r\narms. When quiet was restored he turned his eyes from one end of the\r\nroad to the other, listened with anxious attention as though he hoped\r\nto detect some stifled sound, some echo of weapons, or steps which might\r\ngive warning of the expected attack. His black eye seemed to pierce the\r\nwoods to an extraordinary depth. Perceiving no indications of danger, he\r\nnext consulted, like a savage, the ground at his feet, to discover, if\r\npossible, the trail of the invisible enemies whose daring was well known\r\nto him. Desperate at seeing and hearing nothing to justify his fears, he\r\nturned aside from the road and ascended, not without difficulty, one or\r\ntwo hillocks. The other officers and the soldiers, observing the anxiety\r\nof a leader in whom they trusted and whose worth was known to them,\r\nknew that his extreme watchfulness meant danger; but not suspecting its\r\nimminence, they merely stood still and held their breaths by instinct.\r\nLike dogs endeavoring to guess the intentions of a huntsman, whose\r\norders are incomprehensible to them though they faithfully obey him, the\r\nsoldiers gazed in turn at the valley, at the woods by the roadside, at\r\nthe stern face of their leader, endeavoring to read their fate. They\r\nquestioned each other with their eyes, and more than one smile ran from\r\nlip to lip.\r\n\r\nWhen Hulot returned to his men with an anxious look, Beau-Pied, a young\r\nsergeant who passed for the wit of his company, remarked in a low voice:\r\n"Where the deuce have we poked ourselves that an old trooper like Hulot\r\nshould pull such a gloomy face? He\'s as solemn as a council of war."\r\n\r\nHulot gave the speaker a stern look, silence being ordered in the ranks.\r\nIn the hush that ensued, the lagging steps of the conscripts on the\r\ncreaking sand of the road produced a recurrent sound which added a sort\r\nof vague emotion to the general excitement. This indefinable feeling\r\ncan be understood only by those who have felt their hearts beat in\r\nthe silence of the night from a painful expectation heightened by some\r\nnoise, the monotonous recurrence of which seems to distil terror into\r\ntheir minds, drop by drop.\r\n\r\nThe thought of the commandant, as he returned to his men, was: "Can I\r\nbe mistaken?" He glanced, with a concentrated anger which flashed like\r\nlightning from his eyes, at the stolid, immovable Chouan; a look of\r\nsavage irony which he fancied he detected in the man\'s eyes, warned him\r\nnot to relax in his precautions. Just then Captain Merle, having obeyed\r\nHulot\'s orders, returned to his side.\r\n\r\n"We did well, captain," said the commandant, "to put the few men whose\r\npatriotism we can count upon among those conscripts at the rear. Take\r\na dozen more of our own bravest fellows, with sub-lieutenant Lebrun at\r\ntheir head, and make a rear-guard of them; they\'ll support the patriots\r\nwho are there already, and help to shove on that flock of birds and\r\nclose up the distance between us. I\'ll wait for you."\r\n\r\nThe captain disappeared. The commander\'s eye singled out four men on\r\nwhose intelligence and quickness he knew he might rely, and he beckoned\r\nto them, silently, with the well-known friendly gesture of moving the\r\nright forefinger rapidly and repeatedly toward the nose. They came to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"You served with me under Hoche," he said, "when we brought to reason\r\nthose brigands who call themselves \'Chasseurs du Roi\'; you know how they\r\nhid themselves to swoop down on the Blues."\r\n\r\nAt this commendation of their intelligence the four soldiers nodded\r\nwith significant grins. Their heroically martial faces wore that look\r\nof careless resignation to fate which evidenced the fact that since the\r\nstruggle had begun between France and Europe, the ideas of the private\r\nsoldiers had never passed beyond the cartridge-boxes on their backs or\r\nthe bayonets in front of them. With their lips drawn together like a\r\npurse when the strings are tightened, they looked at their commander\r\nattentively with inquiring eyes.\r\n\r\n"You know," continued Hulot, who possessed the art of speaking\r\npicturesquely as soldier to soldiers, "that it won\'t do for old hares\r\nlike us to be caught napping by the Chouans,--of whom there are plenty\r\nall round us, or my name\'s not Hulot. You four are to march in advance\r\nand beat up both sides of this road. The detachment will hang fire here.\r\nKeep your eyes about you; don\'t get picked off; and bring me news of\r\nwhat you find--quick!"\r\n\r\nSo saying he waved his hand towards the suspected heights along the\r\nroad. The four men, by way of thanks raised the backs of their hands to\r\ntheir battered old three-cornered hats, discolored by rain and ragged\r\nwith age, and bent their bodies double. One of them, named Larose, a\r\ncorporal well-known to Hulot, remarked as he clicked his musket: "We\'ll\r\nplay \'em a tune on the clarinet, commander."\r\n\r\nThey started, two to right and two to left of the road; and it was not\r\nwithout some excitement that their comrades watched them disappear. The\r\ncommandant himself feared that he had sent them to their deaths, and an\r\ninvoluntary shudder seized him as he saw the last of them. Officers and\r\nsoldiers listened to the gradually lessening sound of their footsteps,\r\nwith feelings all the more acute because they were carefully hidden.\r\nThere are occasions when the risk of four lives causes more excitement\r\nand alarm than all the slain at Jemmapes. The faces of those trained to\r\nwar have such various and fugitive expressions that a painter who has to\r\ndescribe them is forced to appeal to the recollections of soldiers and\r\nto leave civilians to imagine these dramatic figures; for scenes so rich\r\nin detail cannot be rendered in writing, except at interminable length.\r\n\r\nJust as the bayonets of the four men were finally lost to sight, Captain\r\nMerle returned, having executed the commandant\'s orders with rapidity.\r\nHulot, with two or three sharp commands, put his troop in line of battle\r\nand ordered it to return to the summit of La Pelerine where his little\r\nadvanced-guard were stationed; walking last himself and looking backward\r\nto note any changes that might occur in a scene which Nature had made\r\nso lovely, and man so terrible. As he reached the spot where he had left\r\nthe Chouan, Marche-a-Terre, who had seen with apparent indifference\r\nthe various movements of the commander, but who was now watching with\r\nextraordinary intelligence the two soldiers in the woods to the\r\nright, suddenly gave the shrill and piercing cry of the _chouette_, or\r\nscreech-owl. The three famous smugglers already mentioned were in the\r\nhabit of using the various intonations of this cry to warn each other\r\nof danger or of any event that might concern them. From this came the\r\nnickname of "Chuin" which means _chouette_ or owl in the dialect of that\r\nregion. This corrupted word came finally to mean the whole body of those\r\nwho, in the first uprising, imitated the tactics and the signals of the\r\nsmugglers.\r\n\r\nWhen Hulot heard that suspicious sound he stopped short and examined the\r\nman intently; then he feigned to be taken in by his stupid air, wishing\r\nto keep him by him as a barometer which might indicate the movements of\r\nthe enemy. He therefore checked Gerard, whose hand was on his sword to\r\ndespatch him; but he placed two soldiers beside the man he now felt to\r\nbe a spy, and ordered them in a loud, clear voice to shoot him at the\r\nnext sound he made. In spite of his imminent danger Marche-a-Terre\r\nshowed not the slightest emotion. The commandant, who was studying him,\r\ntook note of this apparent insensibility, and remarked to Gerard: "That\r\nfool is not so clever as he means to be! It is far from easy to read the\r\nface of a Chouan, but the fellow betrays himself by his anxiety to show\r\nhis nerve. Ha! ha! if he had only pretended fear I should have taken him\r\nfor a stupid brute. He and I might have made a pair! I came very near\r\nfalling into the trap. Yes, we shall undoubtedly be attacked; but let\r\n\'em come; I\'m all ready now."\r\n\r\nAs he said these words in a low voice, rubbing his hands with an air\r\nof satisfaction, he looked at the Chouan with a jeering eye. Then he\r\ncrossed his arms on his breast and stood in the road with his favorite\r\nofficers beside him awaiting the result of his arrangements. Certain\r\nthat a fight was at hand, he looked at his men composedly.\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be a row," said Beau-Pied to his comrades in a low voice.\r\n"See, the commandant is rubbing his hands."\r\n\r\nIn critical situations like that in which the detachment and its\r\ncommander were now placed, life is so clearly at stake that men of nerve\r\nmake it a point of honor to show coolness and self-possession. These\r\nare the moments in which to judge men\'s souls. The commandant, better\r\ninformed of the danger than his two officers, took pride in showing his\r\ntranquillity. With his eyes moving from Marche-a-Terre to the road and\r\nthence to the woods he stood expecting, not without dread, a general\r\nvolley from the Chouans, whom he believed to be hidden like brigands all\r\naround him; but his face remained impassible. Knowing that the eyes of\r\nthe soldiers were turned upon him, he wrinkled his brown cheeks pitted\r\nwith the small-pox, screwed his upper lip, and winked his right eye, a\r\ngrimace always taken for a smile by his men; then he tapped Gerard\r\non the shoulder and said: "Now that things are quiet tell me what you\r\nwanted to say just now."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to ask what this new crisis means, commandant?" was the reply.\r\n\r\n"It is not new," said Hulot. "All Europe is against us, and this time\r\nshe has got the whip hand. While those Directors are fighting together\r\nlike horses in a stable without any oats, and letting the government go\r\nto bits, the armies are left without supplies or reinforcements. We are\r\ngetting the worst of it in Italy; we\'ve evacuated Mantua after a series\r\nof disasters on the Trebia, and Joubert has just lost a battle at\r\nNovi. I only hope Massena may be able to hold the Swiss passes against\r\nSuwarow. We\'re done for on the Rhine. The Directory have sent Moreau.\r\nThe question is, Can he defend the frontier? I hope he may, but the\r\nCoalition will end by invading us, and the only general able to save the\r\nnation is, unluckily, down in that devilish Egypt; and how is he ever to\r\nget back, with England mistress of the Mediterranean?"\r\n\r\n"Bonaparte\'s absence doesn\'t trouble me, commandant," said the young\r\nadjutant Gerard, whose intelligent mind had been developed by a fine\r\neducation. "I am certain the Revolution cannot be brought to naught.\r\nHa! we soldiers have a double mission,--not merely to defend French\r\nterritory, but to preserve the national soul, the generous principles\r\nof liberty, independence, and rights of human reason awakened by our\r\nAssemblies and gaining strength, as I believe, from day to day. France\r\nis like a traveller bearing a light: he protects it with one hand, and\r\ndefends himself with the other. If your news is true, we have never the\r\nlast ten years been so surrounded with people trying to blow it out.\r\nPrinciples and nation are in danger of perishing together."\r\n\r\n"Alas, yes," said Hulot, sighing. "Those clowns of Directors have\r\nmanaged to quarrel with all the men who could sail the ship. Bernadotte,\r\nCarnot, all of them, even Talleyrand, have deserted us. There\'s not a\r\nsingle good patriot left, except friend Fouche, who holds \'em through\r\nthe police. There\'s a man for you! It was he who warned me of a coming\r\ninsurrection; and here we are, sure enough, caught in a trap."\r\n\r\n"If the army doesn\'t take things in hand and manage the government,"\r\nsaid Gerard, "those lawyers in Paris will put us back just where we\r\nwere before the Revolution. A parcel of ninnies! what do they know about\r\ngoverning?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m always afraid they\'ll treat with the Bourbons," said Hulot.\r\n"Thunder! if they did _that_ a pretty pass we should be in, we\r\nsoldiers!"\r\n\r\n"No, no, commandant, it won\'t come to that," said Gerard. "The army, as\r\nyou say, will raise its voice, and--provided it doesn\'t choose its words\r\nfrom Pichegru\'s vocabulary--I am persuaded we have not hacked ourselves\r\nto pieces for the last ten years merely to manure the flax and let\r\nothers spin the thread."\r\n\r\n"Well," interposed Captain Merle, "what we have to do now is to act as\r\ngood patriots and prevent the Chouans from communicating with La Vendee;\r\nfor, if they once come to an understanding and England gets her finger\r\ninto the pie, I wouldn\'t answer for the cap of the Republic, one and\r\ninvisible."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the cry of an owl, heard at a distance, interrupted the\r\nconversation. Again the commander examined Marche-a-Terre, whose\r\nimpassible face still gave no sign. The conscripts, their ranks closed\r\nup by an officer, now stood like a herd of cattle in the road, about\r\na hundred feet distant from the escort, which was drawn up in line\r\nof battle. Behind them stood the rear-guard of soldiers and patriots,\r\npicked men, commanded by Lieutenant Lebrun. Hulot cast his eyes over\r\nthis arrangement of his forces and looked again at the picket of men\r\nposted in advance upon the road. Satisfied with what he saw he was\r\nabout to give the order to march, when the tricolor cockades of the two\r\nsoldiers he had sent to beat the woods to the left caught his eye; he\r\nwaited therefore till the two others, who had gone to the right, should\r\nreappear.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the ball will open over there," he said to his officers,\r\npointing to the woods from which the two men did not emerge.\r\n\r\nWhile the first two made their report Hulot\'s attention was distracted\r\nmomentarily from Marche-a-Terre. The Chouan at once sent his owl\'s-cry\r\nto an apparently vast distance, and before the men who guarded him could\r\nraise their muskets and take aim he had struck them a blow with his whip\r\nwhich felled them, and rushed away. A terrible discharge of fire-arms\r\nfrom the woods just above the place where the Chouan had been sitting\r\nbrought down six or eight soldiers. Marche-a-Terre, at whom several men\r\nhad fired without touching him, vanished into the woods after climbing\r\nthe slope with the agility of a wild-cat; as he did so his sabots\r\nrolled into the ditch and his feet were seen to be shod with the thick,\r\nhobnailed boots always worn by the Chouans.\r\n\r\nAt the first cries uttered by the Chouans, the conscripts sprang into\r\nthe woods to the right like a flock of birds taking flight at the\r\napproach of a man.\r\n\r\n"Fire on those scoundrels!" cried Hulot.\r\n\r\nThe company fired, but the conscripts knew well how to shelter\r\nthemselves behind trees, and before the soldiers could reload they were\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of _decreeing_ levies in the departments?" said Hulot.\r\n"It is only such idiots as the Directory who would expect any good of\r\na draft in this region. The Assembly had much better stop voting more\r\nshoes and money and ammunition, and see that we get what belongs to us."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the two skirmishers sent out on the right were seen\r\nreturning with evident difficulty. The one that was least wounded\r\nsupported his comrade, whose blood was moistening the earth. The two\r\npoor fellows were half-way down the slope when Marche-a-Terre showed\r\nhis ugly face, and took so true an aim that both Blues fell together and\r\nrolled heavily into the ditch. The Chouan\'s monstrous head was no sooner\r\nseen than thirty muzzles were levelled at him, but, like a figure in a\r\npantomime, he disappeared in a second among the tufts of gorse.\r\nThese events, which have taken so many words to tell, happened\r\ninstantaneously, and in another moment the rear-guard of patriots and\r\nsoldiers had joined the main body of the escort.\r\n\r\n"Forward!" cried Hulot.\r\n\r\nThe company moved quickly to the higher and more open ground on which\r\nthe picket guard was already stationed. There, the commander formed his\r\ntroop once more into line of battle; but, as the Chouans made no further\r\nhostile demonstrations, he began to think that the deliverance of the\r\nconscripts might have been the sole object of the ambuscade.\r\n\r\n"Their cries," he said to his two friends, "prove that they are not\r\nnumerous. We\'ll advance at a quick step, and possibly we may be able to\r\nreach Ernee without getting them on our backs."\r\n\r\nThese words were overheard by one of the patriot conscripts, who stepped\r\nfrom the ranks, and said respectfully:--\r\n\r\n"General, I have already fought the Chouans; may I be allowed a word?"\r\n\r\n"A lawyer," whispered Hulot to Merle. "They always want to harangue.\r\nArgue away," he said to the young man.\r\n\r\n"General, the Chouans have no doubt brought arms for those escaped\r\nrecruits. Now, if we try to outmarch them, they will catch us in the\r\nwoods and shoot every one of us before we can get to Ernee. We must\r\nargue, as you call it, with cartridges. During the skirmish, which will\r\nlast more time than you think for, some of us ought to go back and fetch\r\nthe National Guard and the militia from Fougeres."\r\n\r\n"Then you think there are a good many Chouans?"\r\n\r\n"Judge for yourself, citizen commander."\r\n\r\nHe led Hulot to a place where the sand had been stirred as with a rake;\r\nthen he took him to the opening of a wood-path, where the leaves were\r\nscattered and trampled into the earth,--unmistakable signs of the\r\npassage of a large body of men.\r\n\r\n"Those were the \'gars\' from Vitre," said the man, who came himself from\r\nFougeres; "they are on their way to Lower Normandy."\r\n\r\n"What is your name?" asked Hulot.\r\n\r\n"Gudin, commander."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, Gudin, I make you a corporal. You seem to me trustworthy.\r\nSelect a man to send to Fougeres; but stay yourself with me. In the\r\nfirst place, however, take two or three of your comrades and bring\r\nin the muskets and ammunition of the poor fellows those brigands have\r\nrolled into the ditch. These Bretons," added Hulot to Gerard, "will make\r\nfamous infantry if they take to rations."\r\n\r\nGudin\'s emissary started on a run to Fougeres by a wood-road to the\r\nleft; the soldiers looked to their arms, and awaited an attack; the\r\ncommandant passed along their line, smiling to them, and then placed\r\nhimself with his officers, a little in front of it. Silence fell once\r\nmore, but it was of short duration. Three hundred or more Chouans, their\r\nclothing identical with that of the late recruits, burst from the woods\r\nto the right with actual howls and planted themselves, without any\r\nsemblance of order, on the road directly in front of the feeble\r\ndetachment of the Blues. The commandant thereupon ranged his soldiers in\r\ntwo equal parts, each with a front of ten men. Between them, he placed\r\nthe twelve recruits, to whom he hastily gave arms, putting himself\r\nat their head. This little centre was protected by the two wings, of\r\ntwenty-five men each, which manoeuvred on either side of the road under\r\nthe orders of Merle and Gerard; their object being to catch the Chouans\r\non the flank and prevent them from posting themselves as sharp-shooters\r\namong the trees, where they could pick off the Blues without risk to\r\nthemselves; for in these wars the Republican troops never knew where to\r\nlook for an enemy.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements, hastily made, gave confidence to the soldiers, and\r\nthey advanced in silence upon the Chouans. At the end of a few seconds\r\neach side fired, with the loss of several men. At this moment the two\r\nwings of the Republicans, to whom the Chouans had nothing to oppose,\r\ncame upon their flanks, and, with a close, quick volley, sent death\r\nand disorder among the enemy. This manoeuvre very nearly equalized the\r\nnumerical strength of the two parties. But the Chouan nature was so\r\nintrepid, their will so firm, that they did not give way; their losses\r\nscarcely staggered them; they simply closed up and attempted to surround\r\nthe dark and well-formed little party of the Blues, which covered so\r\nlittle ground that it looked from a distance like a queen-bee surrounded\r\nby the swarm.\r\n\r\nThe Chouans might have carried the day at this moment if the two wings\r\ncommanded by Merle and Gerard had not succeeded in getting in two\r\nvolleys which took them diagonally on their rear. The Blues of the two\r\nwings ought to have remained in position and continued to pick off in\r\nthis way their terrible enemies; but excited by the danger of their\r\nlittle main body, then completely surrounded by the Chouans, they flung\r\nthemselves headlong into the road with fixed bayonets and made the\r\nbattle even for a few moments. Both sides fought with a stubbornness\r\nintensified by the cruelty and fury of the partisan spirit which made\r\nthis war exceptional. Each man, observant of danger, was silent. The\r\nscene was gloomy and cold as death itself. Nothing was heard through the\r\nclash of arms and the grinding of the sand under foot but the moans and\r\nexclamations of those who fell, either dead or badly wounded. The twelve\r\nloyal recruits in the republican main body protected the commandant (who\r\nwas guiding his men and giving orders) with such courage that more than\r\nonce several soldiers called out "Bravo, conscripts!"\r\n\r\nHulot, imperturbable and with an eye to everything, presently remarked\r\namong the Chouans a man who, like himself, was evidently surrounded by\r\npicked men, and was therefore, no doubt, the leader of the attacking\r\nparty. He was eager to see this man distinctly, and he made many efforts\r\nto distinguish his features, but in vain; they were hidden by the red\r\ncaps and broad-brimmed hats of those about him. Hulot did, however,\r\nsee Marche-a-Terre beside this leader, repeating his orders in a\r\nhoarse voice, his own carbine, meanwhile, being far from inactive. The\r\ncommandant grew impatient at being thus baffled. Waving his sword, he\r\nurged on the recruits and charged the centre of the Chouans with such\r\nfury that he broke through their line and came close to their chief,\r\nwhose face, however, was still hidden by a broad-brimmed felt hat with a\r\nwhite cockade. But the invisible leader, surprised at so bold an attack,\r\nretreated a step or two and raised his hat abruptly, thus enabling Hulot\r\nto get a hasty idea of his appearance.\r\n\r\nHe was young,--Hulot thought him to be about twenty-five; he wore a\r\nhunting-jacket of green cloth, and a white belt containing pistols. His\r\nheavy shoes were hobnailed like those of the Chouans; leather leggings\r\ncame to his knees covering the ends of his breeches of very coarse\r\ndrilling, and completing a costume which showed off a slender and\r\nwell-poised figure of medium height. Furious that the Blues should thus\r\nhave approached him, he pulled his hat again over his face and sprang\r\ntowards them. But he was instantly surrounded by Marche-a-Terre and\r\nseveral Chouans. Hulot thought he perceived between the heads which\r\nclustered about this young leader, a broad red ribbon worn across his\r\nchest. The eyes of the commandant, caught by this royal decoration (then\r\nalmost forgotten by republicans), turned quickly to the young man\'s\r\nface, which, however, he soon lost sight of under the necessity of\r\ncontrolling and protecting his own little troop. Though he had barely\r\ntime to notice a pair of brilliant eyes (the color of which escaped\r\nhim), fair hair and delicate features bronzed by the sun, he was much\r\nstruck by the dazzling whiteness of the neck, relieved by a black cravat\r\ncarelessly knotted. The fiery attitude of the young leader proved him\r\nto be a soldier of the stamp of those who bring a certain conventional\r\npoesy into battle. His well-gloved hand waved above his head a sword\r\nwhich gleamed in the sunlight. His whole person gave an impression both\r\nof elegance and strength. An air of passionate self-devotion, enhanced\r\nby the charms of youth and distinguished manners, made this _emigre_ a\r\ngraceful image of the French _noblesse_. He presented a strong contrast\r\nto Hulot, who, ten feet distant from him, was quite as vivid an image of\r\nthe vigorous Republic for which the old soldier was fighting; his stern\r\nface, his well-worn blue uniform with its shabby red facings and its\r\nblackened epaulettes hanging back of his shoulders, being visible signs\r\nof its needs and character.\r\n\r\nThe graceful attitude and expression of the young man were not lost\r\non the commandant, who exclaimed as he pressed towards him: "Come on,\r\nopera-dancer, come on, and let me crush you!"\r\n\r\nThe royalist leader, provoked by his momentary disadvantage, advanced\r\nwith an angry movement, but at the same moment the men who were about\r\nhim rushed forward and flung themselves with fury on the Blues. Suddenly\r\na soft, clear voice was heard above the din of battle saying: "Here died\r\nSaint-Lescure! Shall we not avenge him?"\r\n\r\nAt the magic words the efforts of the Chouans became terrible, and the\r\nsoldiers of the Republic had great difficulty in maintaining themselves\r\nwithout breaking their little line of battle.\r\n\r\n"If he wasn\'t a young man," thought Hulot, as he retreated step by step,\r\n"we shouldn\'t have been attacked in this way. Who ever heard of the\r\nChouans fighting an open battle? Well, all the better! they won\'t shoot\r\nus off like dogs along the road." Then, raising his voice till it\r\nechoed through the woods, he exclaimed, "Come on, my men! Shall we let\r\nourselves be _fooled_ by those brigands?"\r\n\r\nThe word here given is but a feeble equivalent of the one the brave\r\ncommandant used; but every veteran can substitute the real one, which\r\nwas far more soldierly in character.\r\n\r\n"Gerard! Merle!" added Hulot, "call in your men, form them into a\r\nbattalion, take the rear, fire upon those dogs, and let\'s make an end of\r\nthis!"\r\n\r\nThe order was difficult to obey, for the young chief, hearing Hulot\'s\r\nvoice, cried out: "By Saint Anne of Auray, don\'t let them get away!\r\nSpread out, spread out, my lads!" and each of the two wings of the Blues\r\nwas followed by Chouans who were fully as obstinate and far superior in\r\nnumbers. The Republicans were surrounded on all sides by the Goatskins\r\nuttering their savage cries, which were more like howls.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongues, gentlemen," cried Beau-Pied; "we can\'t hear\r\nourselves be killed."\r\n\r\nThis jest revived the courage of the Blues. Instead of fighting only at\r\none point, the Republicans spread themselves to three different points\r\non the table-land of La Pelerine, and the rattle of musketry woke all\r\nthe echoes of the valleys, hitherto so peaceful beneath it. Victory\r\nmight have remained doubtful for many hours, or the fight might have\r\ncome to an end for want of combatants, for Blues and Chouans were\r\nequally brave and obstinate. Each side was growing more and more\r\nincensed, when the sound of a drum in the distance told that the body of\r\nmen must be crossing the valley of Couesnon.\r\n\r\n"There\'s the National Guard of Fougeres!" cried Gudin, in a loud voice;\r\n"my man has brought them."\r\n\r\nThe words reached the ears of the young leader of the Chouans and\r\nhis ferocious aide-de-camp, and the royalists made a hasty retrograde\r\nmovement, checked, however, by a brutal shout from Marche-a-Terre. After\r\ntwo or three orders given by the leader in a low voice, and transmitted\r\nby Marche-a-Terre in the Breton dialect, the Chouans made good their\r\nretreat with a cleverness which disconcerted the Republicans and even\r\nthe commandant. At the first word of command they formed in line,\r\npresenting a good front, behind which the wounded retreated, and the\r\nothers reloaded their guns. Then, suddenly, with the agility already\r\nshown by Marche-a-Terre, the wounded were taken over the brow of the\r\neminence to the right of the road, while half the others followed them\r\nslowly to occupy the summit, where nothing could be seen of them by the\r\nBlues but their bold heads. There they made a rampart of the trees and\r\npointed the muzzles of their guns on the Republicans, who were rapidly\r\nreformed under reiterated orders from Hulot and turned to face the\r\nremainder of the Chouans, who were still before them in the road. The\r\nlatter retreated slowly, disputing the ground and wheeling so as to\r\nbring themselves under cover of their comrades\' fire. When they reached\r\nthe broad ditch which bordered the road, they scaled the high bank\r\non the other side, braving the fire of the Republicans, which was\r\nsufficiently well-directed to fill the ditch with dead bodies. The\r\nChouans already on the summit answered with a fire that was no less\r\ndeadly. At that moment the National Guard of Fougeres reached the scene\r\nof action at a quick step, and its mere presence put an end to the\r\naffair. The Guard and some of the soldiers crossed the road and began to\r\nenter the woods, but the commandant called to them in his martial voice,\r\n"Do you want to be annihilated over there?"\r\n\r\nThe victory remained to the Republicans, though not without heavy loss.\r\nAll the battered old hats were hung on the points of the bayonets and\r\nthe muskets held aloft, while the soldiers shouted with one voice: "Vive\r\nla Republique!" Even the wounded, sitting by the roadside, shared in the\r\ngeneral enthusiasm; and Hulot, pressing Gerard\'s hand, exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! those are what I call _veterans_!"\r\n\r\nMerle was directed to bury the dead in a ravine; while another party of\r\nmen attended to the removal of the wounded. The carts and horses of\r\nthe neighborhood were put into requisition, and the suffering men were\r\ncarefully laid on the clothing of the dead. Before the little column\r\nstarted, the National Guard of Fougeres turned over to Hulot a Chouan,\r\ndangerously wounded, whom they had captured at the foot of the slope up\r\nwhich his comrades had escaped, and where he had fallen from weakness.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for your help, citizens," said the commandant. "God\'s thunder!\r\nif it hadn\'t been for you, we should have had a pretty bad quarter of an\r\nhour. Take care of yourselves; the war has begun. Adieu, friends." Then,\r\nturning to the prisoner, he asked, "What\'s the name of your general?"\r\n\r\n"The Gars."\r\n\r\n"Who? Marche-a-Terre?"\r\n\r\n"No, the Gars."\r\n\r\n"Where does the Gars come from?"\r\n\r\nTo this question the prisoner, whose face was convulsed with suffering,\r\nmade no reply; he took out his beads and began to say his prayers.\r\n\r\n"The Gars is no doubt that young _ci-devant_ with the black\r\ncravat,--sent by the tyrant and his allies Pitt and Coburg."\r\n\r\nAt that words the Chouan raised his head proudly and said: "Sent by God\r\nand the king!" He uttered the words with an energy which exhausted his\r\nstrength. The commandant saw the difficulty of questioning a dying man,\r\nwhose countenance expressed his gloomy fanaticism, and he turned\r\naway his head with a frown. Two soldiers, friends of those whom\r\nMarche-a-Terre had so brutally killed with the butt of his whip, stepped\r\nback a pace or two, took aim at the Chouan, whose fixed eyes did not\r\nblink at the muzzles of their guns, fired at short range, and brought\r\nhim down. When they approached the dead body to strip it, the dying man\r\nfound strength to cry out loudly, "Vive le roi!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, you canting hypocrite," cried Clef-des-Coeurs; "go and make\r\nyour report to that Virgin of yours. Didn\'t he shout in our faces, \'Vive\r\nle roi!\' when we thought him cooked?"\r\n\r\n"Here are his papers, commandant," said Beau-Pied.\r\n\r\n"Ho! ho!" cried Clef-des-Coeurs. "Come, all of you, and see this minion\r\nof the good God with colors on his stomach!"\r\n\r\nHulot and several soldiers came round the body, now entirely naked, and\r\nsaw upon its breast a blue tattooing in the form of a swollen heart.\r\nIt was the sign of initiation into the brotherhood of the Sacred Heart.\r\nAbove this sign were the words, "Marie Lambrequin," no doubt the man\'s\r\nname.\r\n\r\n"Look at that, Clef-des-Coeurs," said Beau-Pied; "it would take you a\r\nhundred years to find out what that accoutrement is good for."\r\n\r\n"What should I know about the Pope\'s uniform?" replied Clef-des-Coeurs,\r\nscornfully.\r\n\r\n"You worthless bog-trotter, you\'ll never learn anything," retorted\r\nBeau-Pied. "Don\'t you see that they\'ve promised that poor fool that\r\nhe shall live again, and he has painted his gizzard in order to find\r\nhimself?"\r\n\r\nAt this sally--which was not without some foundation--even Hulot joined\r\nin the general hilarity. At this moment Merle returned, and the\r\nburial of the dead being completed and the wounded placed more or less\r\ncomfortably in two carts, the rest of the late escort formed into two\r\nlines round the improvised ambulances, and descended the slope of the\r\nmountain towards Maine, where the beautiful valley of La Pelerine, a\r\nrival to that of Couesnon lay before it.\r\n\r\nHulot with his two officers followed the troop slowly, hoping to get\r\nsafely to Ernee where the wounded could be cared for. The fight we have\r\njust described, which was almost forgotten in the midst of the greater\r\nevents which were soon to occur, was called by the name of the mountain\r\non which it took place. It obtained some notice at the West, where the\r\ninhabitants, observant of this second uprising, noticed on this occasion\r\na great change in the manner in which the Chouans now made war. In\r\nearlier days they would never have attacked so large a detachment.\r\nAccording to Hulot the young royalist whom he had seen was undoubtedly\r\nthe Gars, the new general sent to France by the princes, who, following\r\nthe example of the other royalist chiefs, concealed his real name\r\nand title under one of those pseudonyms called "noms de guerre." This\r\ncircumstance made the commandant quite as uneasy after his melancholy\r\nvictory as he had been before it while expecting the attack. He turned\r\nseveral times to consider the table-land of La Pelerine which he\r\nwas leaving behind him, across which he could still hear faintly at\r\nintervals the drums of the National Guard descending into the valley of\r\nCouesnon at the same time that the Blues were descending into that of La\r\nPelerine.\r\n\r\n"Can either of you," he said to his two friends, "guess the motives of\r\nthat attack of the Chouans? To them, fighting is a matter of business,\r\nand I can\'t see what they expected to gain by this attack. They have\r\nlost at least a hundred men, and we"--he added, screwing up his right\r\ncheek and winking by way of a smile, "have lost only sixty. God\'s\r\nthunder! I don\'t understand that sort of speculation. The scoundrels\r\nneedn\'t have attacked us; we might just as well have been allowed to\r\npass like letters through the post--No, I don\'t see what good it has\r\ndone them to bullet-hole our men," he added, with a sad shake of his\r\nhead toward the carts. "Perhaps they only intended to say good-day to\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"But they carried off our recruits, commander," said Merle.\r\n\r\n"The recruits could have skipped like frogs into the woods at any time,\r\nand we should never have gone after them, especially if those fellows\r\nhad fired a single volley," returned Hulot. "No, no, there\'s something\r\nbehind all this." Again he turned and looked at La Pelerine. "See!" he\r\ncried; "see there!"\r\n\r\nThough they were now at a long distance from the fatal plateau, they\r\ncould easily distinguish Marche-a-Terre and several Chouans who were\r\nagain occupying it.\r\n\r\n"Double-quick, march!" cried Hulot to his men, "open your compasses and\r\ntrot the steeds faster than that! Are your legs frozen?"\r\n\r\nThese words drove the little troop into a rapid motion.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a mystery, and it\'s hard to make out," continued Hulot,\r\nspeaking to his friends. "God grant it isn\'t explained by muskets at\r\nErnee. I\'m very much afraid that we shall find the road to Mayenne cut\r\noff by the king\'s men."\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe strategical problem which troubled the commandant was causing quite\r\nas much uneasiness to the persons whom he had just seen on the summit\r\nof Mont Pelerine. As soon as the drums of the National Guard were out\r\nof hearing and Marche-a-Terre had seen the Blues at the foot of the\r\ndeclivity, he gave the owl\'s cry joyously, and the Chouans reappeared,\r\nbut their numbers were less. Some were no doubt busy in taking care of\r\nthe wounded in the little village of La Pelerine, situated on the side\r\nof the mountain which looks toward the valley of Couesnon. Two or\r\nthree chiefs of what were called the "Chasseurs du Roi" clustered about\r\nMarche-a-Terre. A few feet apart sat the young noble called The Gars, on\r\na granite rock, absorbed in thoughts excited by the difficulties of his\r\nenterprise, which now began to show themselves. Marche-a-Terre screened\r\nhis forehead with his hand from the rays of the sun, and looked gloomily\r\nat the road by which the Blues were crossing the valley of La Pelerine.\r\nHis small black eyes could see what was happening on the hill-slopes on\r\nthe other side of the valley.\r\n\r\n"The Blues will intercept the messenger," said the angry voice of one of\r\nthe leaders who stood near him.\r\n\r\n"By Saint Anne of Auray!" exclaimed another. "Why did you make us fight?\r\nWas it to save your own skin from the Blues?"\r\n\r\nMarche-a-Terre darted a venomous look at his questioner and struck the\r\nground with his heavy carbine.\r\n\r\n"Am I your leader?" he asked. Then after a pause he added, pointing to\r\nthe remains of Hulot\'s detachment, "If you had all fought as I did, not\r\none of those Blues would have escaped, and the coach could have got here\r\nsafely."\r\n\r\n"They\'d never have thought of escorting it or holding it back if we had\r\nlet them go by without a fight. No, you wanted to save your precious\r\nskin and get out of their hands--He has bled us for the sake of his own\r\nsnout," continued the orator, "and made us lose twenty thousand francs\r\nin good coin."\r\n\r\n"Snout yourself!" cried Marche-a-Terre, retreating three steps and\r\naiming at his aggressor. "It isn\'t that you hate the Blues, but you love\r\nthe gold. Die without confession and be damned, for you haven\'t taken\r\nthe sacrament for a year."\r\n\r\nThis insult so incensed the Chouan that he turned pale and a low growl\r\ncame from his chest as he aimed in turn at Marche-a-Terre. The young\r\nchief sprang between them and struck their weapons from their hands with\r\nthe barrel of his own carbine; then he demanded an explanation of the\r\ndispute, for the conversation had been carried on in the Breton dialect,\r\nan idiom with which he was not familiar.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur le marquis," said Marche-a-Terre, as he ended his account of\r\nthe quarrel, "it is all the more unreasonable in them to find fault with\r\nme because I have left Pille-Miche behind me; he\'ll know how to save the\r\ncoach for us."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed the young man, angrily, "are you waiting here, all\r\nof you, to pillage that coach?--a parcel of cowards who couldn\'t win a\r\nvictory in the first fight to which I led you! But why should you win if\r\nthat\'s your object? The defenders of God and the king are thieves,\r\nare they? By Saint Anne of Auray! I\'d have you know, we are making war\r\nagainst the Republic, and not robbing travellers. Those who are guilty\r\nin future of such shameful actions shall not receive absolution, nor any\r\nof the favors reserved for the faithful servants of the king."\r\n\r\nA murmur came from the group of Chouans, and it was easy to see that the\r\nauthority of the new chief was about to be disputed. The young man, on\r\nwhom this effect of his words was by no means lost, was thinking of the\r\nbest means of maintaining the dignity of his command, when the trot of a\r\nhorse was heard in the vicinity. All heads turned in the direction\r\nfrom which the sound came. A lady appeared, sitting astride of a little\r\nBreton horse, which she put at a gallop as soon as she saw the young\r\nleader, so as to reach the group of Chouans as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" she said, looking first at the Chouans and then at\r\ntheir chief.\r\n\r\n"Could you believe it, madame? they are waiting to rob the diligence\r\nfrom Mayenne to Fougeres when we have just had a skirmish, in order to\r\nrelease the conscripts of Fougeres, which has cost us a great many men\r\nwithout defeating the Blues."\r\n\r\n"Well, where\'s the harm of that?" asked the young lady, to whom the\r\nnatural shrewdness of a woman explained the whole scene. "You have lost\r\nmen, but there\'s no lack of others; the coach is bringing gold, and\r\nthere\'s always a lack of that. We bury men, who go to heaven, and we\r\ntake money, which goes into the pockets of heroes. I don\'t see the\r\ndifficulty."\r\n\r\nThe Chouans approved of her speech by unanimous smiles.\r\n\r\n"Do you see nothing in all that to make you blush?" said the young man,\r\nin a low voice. "Are you in such need of money that you must pillage on\r\nthe high-road?"\r\n\r\n"I am so eager for it, marquis, that I should put my heart in pawn if it\r\nwere not already captured," she said, smiling coquettishly. "But where\r\ndid you get the strange idea that you could manage Chouans without\r\nletting them rob a few Blues here and there? Don\'t you know the saying,\r\n\'Thieving as an owl\'?--and that\'s a Chouan. Besides," she said, raising\r\nher voice to be heard by the men, "it is just; haven\'t the Blues seized\r\nthe property of the Church, and our own?"\r\n\r\nAnother murmur, very different from the growl with which the Chouans had\r\nanswered their leader, greeted these words. The young man\'s face grew\r\ndarker; he took the young lady aside and said in the annoyed tone of a\r\nwell-bred man, "Will those gentlemen be at La Vivetiere on the appointed\r\nday?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she replied, "all of them, the Claimant, Grand-Jacques, and\r\nperhaps Ferdinand."\r\n\r\n"Then allow me to return there. I cannot sanction such robbery. Yes,\r\nmadame, I call it robbery. There may be honor in being robbed, but--"\r\n\r\n"Well, well," she said, interrupting him, "then I shall have your share\r\nof the booty, and I am much obliged to you for giving it up to me; the\r\nextra sum will be extremely useful, for my mother has delayed sending me\r\nmoney, so that I am almost destitute."\r\n\r\n"Adieu!" cried the marquis.\r\n\r\nHe turned away, but the lady ran after him.\r\n\r\n"Why won\'t you stay with me?" she said, giving him the look,\r\nhalf-despotic, half-caressing, with which women who have a right to a\r\nman\'s respect let him know their wishes.\r\n\r\n"You are going to pillage that coach?"\r\n\r\n"Pillage? what a word!" she said. "Let me explain to you--"\r\n\r\n"Explain nothing," he said, taking her hand and kissing it with the\r\nsuperficial gallantry of a courtier. "Listen to me," he added after a\r\nshort pause: "if I were to stay here while they capture that diligence\r\nour people would kill me, for I should certainly--"\r\n\r\n"Not kill them," she said quickly, "for they would bind your hands,\r\nwith all the respect that is due to your rank; then, having levied the\r\nnecessary contribution for their equipment, subsistence, and munitions\r\nfrom our enemies, they would unbind you and obey you blindly."\r\n\r\n"And you wish me to command such men under such circumstances? If my\r\nlife is necessary to the cause which I defend allow me at any rate to\r\nsave the honor of my position. If I withdraw now I can ignore this base\r\nact. I will return, in order to escort you."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he rapidly disappeared. The young lady listened to his\r\nreceding steps with evident displeasure. When the sound on the dried\r\nleaves ceased, she stood for a moment as if confounded, then she\r\nhastily returned to the Chouans. With a gesture of contempt she said\r\nto Marche-a-Terre, who helped her to dismount, "That young man wants to\r\nmake regular war on the Republic! Ah, well! he\'ll get over that in a few\r\ndays. How he treated me!" she thought, presently.\r\n\r\nShe seated herself on the rock where the marquis had been sitting, and\r\nsilently awaited the arrival of the coach. It was one of the phenomena\r\nof the times, and not the least of them, that this young and noble lady\r\nshould be flung by violent partisanship into the struggle of monarchies\r\nagainst the spirit of the age, and be driven by the strength of her\r\nfeelings into actions of which it may almost be said she was not\r\nconscious. In this she resembled others of her time who were led away by\r\nan enthusiasm which was often productive of noble deeds. Like her, many\r\nwomen played heroic or blameworthy parts in the fierce struggle. The\r\nroyalist cause had no emissaries so devoted and so active as these\r\nwomen; but none of the heroines on that side paid for mistaken devotion\r\nor for actions forbidden to their sex, with a greater expiation than did\r\nthis lady when, seated on that wayside rock, she was forced to admire\r\nthe young leader\'s noble disdain and loyalty to principle. Insensibly\r\nshe dropped into reverie. Bitter memories made her long for the\r\ninnocence of her early years, and regret that she had escaped being\r\na victim of the Revolution whose victorious march could no longer be\r\narrested by feeble hands.\r\n\r\nThe coach, which, as we now see, had much to do with the attack of the\r\nChouans, had started from the little town of Ernee a few moments before\r\nthe skirmishing began. Nothing pictures a region so well as the state\r\nof its social material. From this point of view the coach deserves a\r\nmention. The Revolution itself was powerless to destroy it; in fact, it\r\nstill rolls to this present day. When Turgot bought up the privileges\r\nof a company, obtained under Louis XIV., for the exclusive right of\r\ntransporting travellers from one part of the kingdom to another, and\r\ninstituted the lines of coaches called the "turgotines," all the old\r\nvehicles of the former company flocked into the provinces. One of\r\nthese shabby coaches was now plying between Mayenne and Fougeres. A few\r\nobjectors called it the "turgotine," partly to mimic Paris and partly\r\nto deride a minister who attempted innovations. This turgotine was\r\na wretched cabriolet on two high wheels, in the depths of which two\r\npersons, if rather fat, could with difficulty have stowed themselves.\r\nThe narrow quarters of this rickety machine not admitting of any\r\ncrowding, and the box which formed the seat being kept exclusively for\r\nthe postal service, the travellers who had any baggage were forced to\r\nkeep it between their legs, already tortured by being squeezed into a\r\nsort of little box in shape like a bellows. The original color of coach\r\nand running-gear was an insoluble enigma. Two leather curtains, very\r\ndifficult to adjust in spite of their long service, were supposed to\r\nprotect the occupants from cold and rain. The driver, perched on a\r\nplank seat like those of the worst Parisian "coucous," shared in the\r\nconversation by reason of his position between his victims, biped and\r\nquadruped. The equipage presented various fantastic resemblances to\r\ndecrepit old men who have gone through a goodly number of catarrhs and\r\napoplexies and whom death respects; it moaned as it rolled, and\r\nsqueaked spasmodically. Like a traveller overtaken by sleep, it rocked\r\nalternately forward and back, as though it tried to resist the violent\r\naction of two little Breton horses which dragged it along a road\r\nwhich was more than rough. This monument of a past era contained three\r\ntravellers, who, on leaving Ernee, where they had changed horses,\r\ncontinued a conversation begun with the driver before reaching the\r\nlittle town.\r\n\r\n"What makes you think the Chouans are hereabouts?" said the coachman.\r\n"The Ernee people tell me that Commandant Hulot has not yet started from\r\nFougeres."\r\n\r\n"Ho, ho, friend driver!" said the youngest of the travellers, "you risk\r\nnothing but your own carcass! If you had a thousand francs about you,\r\nas I have, and were known to be a good patriot, you wouldn\'t take it so\r\neasy."\r\n\r\n"You are pretty free with your tongue, any way," said the driver,\r\nshaking his head.\r\n\r\n"Count your lambs, and the wolf will eat them," remarked another of the\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nThis man, who was dressed in black, seemed to be about forty years old,\r\nand was, probably, the rector of some parish in the neighborhood.\r\nHis chin rested on a double fold of flesh, and his florid complexion\r\nindicated a priest. Though short and fat, he displayed some agility when\r\nrequired to get in or out of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you are both Chouans!" cried the man of the thousand francs,\r\nwhose ample goatskin, covering trousers of good cloth and a clean\r\nwaistcoat, bespoke a rich farmer. "By the soul of Saint Robespierre! I\r\nswear you shall be roughly handled."\r\n\r\nHe turned his gray eyes from the driver to his fellow-travellers and\r\nshowed them a pistol in his belt.\r\n\r\n"Bretons are not afraid of that," said the rector, disdainfully.\r\n"Besides, do we look like men who want your money?"\r\n\r\nEvery time the word "money" was mentioned the driver was silent, and the\r\nrector had wit enough to doubt whether the patriot had any at all, and\r\nto suspect that the driver was carrying a good deal.\r\n\r\n"Are you well laden, Coupiau?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Monsieur Gudin," replied the coachman. "I\'m carrying next to\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\nThe priest watched the faces of the patriot and Coupiau as the latter\r\nmade this answer, and both were imperturbable.\r\n\r\n"So much the better for you," remarked the patriot. "I can now take\r\nmeasures to save my property in case of danger."\r\n\r\nSuch despotic assumption nettled Coupiau, who answered gruffly: "I am\r\nthe master of my own carriage, and so long as I drive you--"\r\n\r\n"Are you a patriot, or are you a Chouan?" said the other, sharply\r\ninterrupting him.\r\n\r\n"Neither the one nor the other," replied Coupiau. "I\'m a postilion, and,\r\nwhat is more, a Breton,--consequently, I fear neither Blues nor nobles."\r\n\r\n"Noble thieves!" cried the patriot, ironically.\r\n\r\n"They only take back what was stolen from them," said the rector,\r\nvehemently.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other in the whites of their eyes, if we\r\nmay use a phrase so colloquial. Sitting back in the vehicle was a third\r\ntraveller who took no part in the discussion, and preserved a deep\r\nsilence. The driver and the patriot and even Gudin paid no attention\r\nto this mute individual; he was, in truth, one of those uncomfortable,\r\nunsocial travellers who are found sometimes in a stage-coach, like a\r\npatient calf that is being carried, bound, to the nearest market. Such\r\ntravellers begin by filling their legal space, and end by sleeping,\r\nwithout the smallest respect for their fellow-beings, on a neighbor\'s\r\nshoulder. The patriot, Gudin, and the driver had let him alone, thinking\r\nhim asleep, after discovering that it was useless to talk to a man whose\r\nstolid face betrayed an existence spent in measuring yards of linen, and\r\nan intellect employed in selling them at a good percentage above cost.\r\nThis fat little man, doubled-up in his corner, opened his porcelain-blue\r\neyes every now and then, and looked at each speaker with a sort of\r\nterror. He appeared to be afraid of his fellow-travellers and to care\r\nvery little about the Chouans. When he looked at the driver, however,\r\nthey seemed to be a pair of free-masons. Just then the first volley\r\nof musketry was heard on La Pelerine. Coupiau, frightened, stopped the\r\ncoach.\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh!" said the priest, as if he had some means of judging, "it is a\r\nserious engagement; there are many men."\r\n\r\n"The trouble for us, Monsieur Gudin," cried Coupiau, "is to know which\r\nside will win."\r\n\r\nThe faces of all became unanimously anxious.\r\n\r\n"Let us put up the coach at that inn which I see over there," said the\r\npatriot; "we can hide it till we know the result of the fight."\r\n\r\nThe advice seemed so good that Coupiau followed it. The patriot helped\r\nhim to conceal the coach behind a wood-pile; the abbe seized the\r\noccasion to pull Coupiau aside and say to him, in a low voice: "Has he\r\nreally any money?"\r\n\r\n"Hey, Monsieur Gudin, if it gets into the pockets of your Reverence,\r\nthey won\'t be weighed down with it."\r\n\r\nWhen the Blues marched by, after the encounter on La Pelerine, they were\r\nin such haste to reach Ernee that they passed the little inn without\r\nhalting. At the sound of their hasty march, Gudin and the innkeeper,\r\nstirred by curiosity, went to the gate of the courtyard to watch them.\r\nSuddenly, the fat ecclesiastic rushed to a soldier who was lagging in\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\n"Gudin!" he cried, "you wrong-headed fellow, have you joined the Blues?\r\nMy lad, you are surely not in earnest?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, uncle," answered the corporal. "I\'ve sworn to defend France."\r\n\r\n"Unhappy boy! you\'ll lose your soul," said the uncle, trying to rouse\r\nhis nephew to the religious sentiments which are so powerful in the\r\nBreton breast.\r\n\r\n"Uncle," said the young man, "if the king had placed himself at the head\r\nof his armies, I don\'t say but what--"\r\n\r\n"Fool! who is talking to you about the king? Does your republic give\r\nabbeys? No, it has upset everything. How do you expect to get on in\r\nlife? Stay with us; sooner or later we shall triumph and you\'ll be\r\ncounsellor to some parliament."\r\n\r\n"Parliaments!" said young Gudin, in a mocking tone. "Good-bye, uncle."\r\n\r\n"You sha\'n\'t have a penny at my death," cried his uncle, in a rage.\r\n"I\'ll disinherit you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, uncle," said the Republican, as they parted.\r\n\r\nThe fumes of the cider which the patriot copiously bestowed on Coupiau\r\nduring the passage of the little troop had somewhat dimmed the driver\'s\r\nperceptions, but he roused himself joyously when the innkeeper, having\r\nquestioned the soldiers, came back to the inn and announced that the\r\nBlues were victorious. He at once brought out the coach and before long\r\nit was wending its way across the valley.\r\n\r\nWhen the Blues reached an acclivity on the road from which the plateau\r\nof La Pelerine could again be seen in the distance, Hulot turned\r\nround to discover if the Chouans were still occupying it, and the sun,\r\nglinting on the muzzles of the guns, showed them to him, each like a\r\ndazzling spot. Giving a last glance to the valley of La Pelerine before\r\nturning into that of Ernee, he thought he saw Coupiau\'s vehicle on the\r\nroad he had just traversed.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that the Mayenne coach?" he said to his two officers.\r\n\r\nThey looked at the venerable turgotine, and easily recognized it.\r\n\r\n"But," said Hulot, "how did we fail to meet it?"\r\n\r\nMerle and Gerard looked at each other in silence.\r\n\r\n"Another enigma!" cried the commandant. "But I begin to see the meaning\r\nof it all."\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Marche-a-Terre, who also knew the turgotine, called\r\nhis comrades\' attention to it, and the general shout of joy which they\r\nsent up roused the young lady from her reflections. She advanced a\r\nlittle distance and saw the coach, which was beginning the ascent of\r\nLa Pelerine with fatal rapidity. The luckless vehicle soon reached the\r\nplateau. The Chouans, who had meantime hidden themselves, swooped on\r\ntheir prey with hungry celerity. The silent traveller slipped to the\r\nfloor of the carriage, bundling himself up into the semblance of a bale.\r\n\r\n"Well done!" cried Coupiau from his wooden perch, pointing to the man in\r\nthe goatskin; "you must have scented this patriot who has lots of gold\r\nin his pouch--"\r\n\r\nThe Chouans greeted these words with roars of laughter, crying out:\r\n"Pille-Miche! hey, Pille-Miche! Pille-Miche!"\r\n\r\nAmid the laughter, to which Pille-Miche responded like an echo, Coupiau\r\ncame down from his seat quite crestfallen. When the famous Cibot,\r\notherwise called Pille-Miche, helped his neighbor to get out of the\r\ncoach, a respectful murmur was heard among the Chouans.\r\n\r\n"It is the Abbe Gudin!" cried several voices. At this respected name\r\nevery hat was off, and the men knelt down before the priest as they\r\nasked his blessing, which he gave solemnly.\r\n\r\n"Pille-Miche here could trick Saint Peter and steal the keys of\r\nParadise," said the rector, slapping that worthy on the shoulder. "If it\r\nhadn\'t been for him, the Blues would have intercepted us."\r\n\r\nThen, noticing the lady, the abbe went to speak to her apart.\r\nMarche-a-Terre, who had meantime briskly opened the boot of the\r\ncabriolet, held up to his comrades, with savage joy, a bag, the shape of\r\nwhich betrayed its contents to be rolls of coin. It did not take long\r\nto divide the booty. Each Chouan received his share, so carefully\r\napportioned that the division was made without the slightest dispute.\r\nThen Marche-a-Terre went to the lady and the priest, and offered them\r\neach about six thousand francs.\r\n\r\n"Can I conscientiously accept this money, Monsieur Gudin?" said the\r\nlady, feeling a need of justification.\r\n\r\n"Why not, madame? In former days the Church approved of the confiscation\r\nof the property of Protestants, and there\'s far more reason for\r\nconfiscating that of these revolutionists, who deny God, destroy\r\nchapels, and persecute religion."\r\n\r\nThe abbe then joined example to precept by accepting, without the\r\nslightest scruple, the novel sort of tithe which Marche-a-Terre offered\r\nto him. "Besides," he added, "I can now devote all I possess to the\r\nservice of God and the king; for my nephew has joined the Blues, and I\r\ndisinherit him."\r\n\r\nCoupiau was bemoaning himself and declaring that he was ruined.\r\n\r\n"Join us," said Marche-a-Terre, "and you shall have your share."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll say I let the coach be robbed on purpose if I return without\r\nsigns of violence."\r\n\r\n"Oh, is that all?" exclaimed Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\nHe gave a signal and a shower of bullets riddled the turgotine. At this\r\nunexpected volley the old vehicle gave forth such a lamentable cry\r\nthat the Chouans, superstitious by nature, recoiled in terror; but\r\nMarche-a-Terre caught sight of the pallid face of the silent traveller\r\nrising from the floor of the coach.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got another fowl in your coop," he said in a low voice to\r\nCoupiau.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the driver; "but I make it a condition of my joining you\r\nthat I be allowed to take that worthy man safe and sound to Fougeres.\r\nI\'m pledged to it in the name of Saint Anne of Auray."\r\n\r\n"Who is he?" asked Pille-Miche.\r\n\r\n"That I can\'t tell you," replied Coupiau.\r\n\r\n"Let him alone!" said Marche-a-Terre, shoving Pille-Miche with his\r\nelbow; "he has vowed by Saint Anne of Auray, and he must keep his word."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Pille-Miche, addressing Coupiau; "but mind you don\'t\r\ngo down the mountain too fast; we shall overtake you,--a good reason\r\nwhy; I want to see the cut of your traveller, and give him his\r\npassport."\r\n\r\nJust then the gallop of a horse coming rapidly up the slopes of La\r\nPelerine was heard, and the young chief presently reappeared. The lady\r\nhastened to conceal the bag of plunder which she held in her hand.\r\n\r\n"You can keep that money without any scruple," said the young man,\r\ntouching the arm which the lady had put behind her. "Here is a letter\r\nfor you which I have just found among mine which were waiting for me at\r\nLa Vivetiere; it is from your mother." Then, looking at the Chouans who\r\nwere disappearing into the woods, and at the turgotine which was now on\r\nits way to the valley of Couesnon, he added: "After all my haste I see I\r\nam too late. God grant I am deceived in my suspicions!"\r\n\r\n"It was my poor mother\'s money!" cried the lady, after opening her\r\nletter, the first lines of which drew forth her exclamation.\r\n\r\nA smothered laugh came from the woods, and the young man himself\r\ncould not help smiling as he saw the lady holding in her hand the bag\r\ncontaining her share in the pillage of her own money. She herself began\r\nto laugh.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, marquis, God be praised! this time, at least, you can\'t\r\nblame me," she said, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Levity in everything! even your remorse!" said the young man.\r\n\r\nShe colored and looked at the marquis with so genuine a contrition that\r\nhe was softened. The abbe politely returned to her, with an equivocal\r\nmanner, the sum he had received; then he followed the young leader who\r\ntook the by-way through which he had come. Before following them the\r\nlady made a sign to Marche-a-Terre, who came to her.\r\n\r\n"Advance towards Mortagne," she said to him in a low voice. "I know that\r\nthe Blues are constantly sending large sums of money in coin to Alencon\r\nto pay for their supplies of war. If I allow you and your comrades to\r\nkeep what you captured to-day it is only on condition that you repay it\r\nlater. But be careful that the Gars knows nothing of the object of the\r\nexpedition; he would certainly oppose it; in case of ill-luck, I will\r\npacify him."\r\n\r\n"Madame," said the marquis, after she had rejoined him and had mounted\r\nhis horse _en croupe_, giving her own to the abbe, "my friends in Paris\r\nwrite me to be very careful of what we do; the Republic, they say, is\r\npreparing to fight us with spies and treachery."\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t be a bad plan," she replied; "they have clever ideas, those\r\nfellows. I could take part in that sort of war and find foes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt it!" cried the marquis. "Pichegru advises me to be\r\ncautious and watchful in my friendships and relations of every kind.\r\nThe Republic does me the honor to think me more dangerous than all the\r\nVendeans put together, and counts on certain of my weaknesses to lay\r\nhands upon me."\r\n\r\n"Surely you will not distrust me?" she said, striking his heart with the\r\nhand by which she held to him.\r\n\r\n"Are you a traitor, madame?" he said, bending towards her his forehead,\r\nwhich she kissed.\r\n\r\n"In that case," said the abbe, referring to the news, "Fouche\'s police\r\nwill be more dangerous for us than their battalions of recruits and\r\ncounter-Chouans."\r\n\r\n"Yes, true enough, father," replied the marquis.\r\n\r\n"Ah! ah!" cried the lady. "Fouche means to send women against you, does\r\nhe? I shall be ready for them," she added in a deeper tone of voice and\r\nafter a slight pause.\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAt a distance of three or four gunshots from the plateau, now abandoned,\r\na little scene was taking place which was not uncommon in those days\r\non the high-roads. After leaving the little village of La Pelerine,\r\nPille-Miche and Marche-a-Terre again stopped the turgotine at a dip in\r\nthe road. Coupiau got off his seat after making a faint resistance. The\r\nsilent traveller, extracted from his hiding place by the two Chouans,\r\nfound himself on his knees in a furze bush.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" asked Marche-a-Terre in a threatening voice.\r\n\r\nThe traveller kept silence until Pille-Miche put the question again and\r\nenforced it with the butt end of his gun.\r\n\r\n"I am Jacques Pinaud," he replied, with a glance at Coupiau; "a poor\r\nlinen-draper."\r\n\r\nCoupiau made a sign in the negative, not considering it an infraction\r\nof his promise to Saint Anne. The sign enlightened Pille-Miche, who\r\ntook aim at the luckless traveller, while Marche-a-Terre laid before him\r\ncategorically a terrible ultimatum.\r\n\r\n"You are too fat to be poor. If you make me ask you your name again,\r\nhere\'s my friend Pille-Miche, who will obtain the gratitude and\r\ngood-will of your heirs in a second. Who are you?" he added, after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\n"I am d\'Orgemont, of Fougeres."\r\n\r\n"Ah! ah!" cried the two Chouans.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t tell your name, Monsieur d\'Orgemont," said Coupiau. "The Holy\r\nVirgin is my witness that I did my best to protect you."\r\n\r\n"Inasmuch as you are Monsieur d\'Orgemont, of Fougeres," said\r\nMarche-a-Terre, with an air of ironical respect, "we shall let you go in\r\npeace. Only, as you are neither a good Chouan nor a true Blue (thought\r\nit was you who bought the property of the Abbey de Juvigny), you\r\nwill pay us three hundred crowns of six francs each for your ransom.\r\nNeutrality is worth that, at least."\r\n\r\n"Three hundred crowns of six francs each!" chorussed the luckless\r\nbanker, Pille-Miche, and Coupiau, in three different tones.\r\n\r\n"Alas, my good friend," continued d\'Orgemont, "I\'m a ruined man. The\r\nlast forced loan of that devilish Republic for a hundred millions sucked\r\nme dry, taxed as I was already."\r\n\r\n"How much did your Republic get out of you?"\r\n\r\n"A thousand crowns, my dear man," replied the banker, with a piteous\r\nair, hoping for a reduction.\r\n\r\n"If your Republic gets forced loans out of you for such big sums as that\r\nyou must see that you would do better with us; our government would cost\r\nyou less. Three hundred crowns, do you call that dear for your skin?"\r\n\r\n"Where am I to get them?"\r\n\r\n"Out of your strong-box," said Pille-Miche; "and mind that the money is\r\nforthcoming, or we\'ll singe you still."\r\n\r\n"How am I to pay it to you?" asked d\'Orgemont.\r\n\r\n"Your country-house at Fougeres is not far from Gibarry\'s farm where my\r\ncousin Galope-Chopine, otherwise called Cibot, lives. You can pay the\r\nmoney to him," said Pille-Miche.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not business-like," said d\'Orgemont.\r\n\r\n"What do we care for that?" said Marche-a-Terre. "But mind you remember\r\nthat if that money is not paid to Galope-Chopine within two weeks we\r\nshall pay you a little visit which will cure your gout. As for\r\nyou, Coupiau," added Marche-a-Terre, "your name in future is to be\r\nMene-a-Bien."\r\n\r\nSo saying, the two Chouans departed. The traveller returned to the\r\nvehicle, which, thanks to Coupiau\'s whip, now made rapid progress to\r\nFougeres.\r\n\r\n"If you\'d only been armed," said Coupiau, "we might have made some\r\ndefence."\r\n\r\n"Idiot!" cried d\'Orgemont, pointing to his heavy shoes. "I have ten\r\nthousand francs in those soles; do you think I would be such a fool as\r\nto fight with that sum about me?"\r\n\r\nMene-a-Bien scratched his ear and looked behind him, but his new\r\ncomrades were out of sight.\r\n\r\nHulot and his command stopped at Ernee long enough to place the wounded\r\nin the hospital of the little town, and then, without further hindrance,\r\nthey reached Mayenne. There the commandant cleared up his doubts as\r\nto the action of the Chouans, for on the following day the news of the\r\npillage of the turgotine was received.\r\n\r\nA few days later the government despatched to Mayenne so strong a force\r\nof "patriotic conscripts," that Hulot was able to fill the ranks of his\r\nbrigade. Disquieting rumors began to circulate about the insurrection. A\r\nrising had taken place at all the points where, during the late war, the\r\nChouans and Bretons had made their chief centres of insurrection. The\r\nlittle town of Saint-James, between Pontorson and Fougeres was occupied\r\nby them, apparently for the purpose of making it for the time being a\r\nheadquarters of operations and supplies. From there they were able to\r\ncommunicate with Normandy and the Morbihan without risk. Their subaltern\r\nleaders roamed the three provinces, roused all the partisans of\r\nmonarchy, and gave consistence and unity to their plans. These\r\nproceedings coincided with what was going on in La Vendee, where the\r\nsame intrigues, under the influence of four famous leaders (the Abbe\r\nVernal, the Comte de Fontaine, De Chatillon, and Suzannet), were\r\nagitating the country. The Chevalier de Valois, the Marquis d\'Esgrignon,\r\nand the Troisvilles were, it was said, corresponding with these leaders\r\nin the department of the Orne. The chief of the great plan of operations\r\nwhich was thus developing slowly but in formidable proportions was\r\nreally "the Gars,"--a name given by the Chouans to the Marquis de\r\nMontauran on his arrival from England. The information sent to Hulot by\r\nthe War department proved correct in all particulars. The marquis\r\ngained after a time sufficient ascendancy over the Chouans to make them\r\nunderstand the true object of the war, and to persuade them that the\r\nexcesses of which they were guilty brought disgrace upon the cause they\r\nhad adopted. The daring nature, the nerve, coolness, and capacity\r\nof this young nobleman awakened the hopes of all the enemies of the\r\nRepublic, and suited so thoroughly the grave and even solemn enthusiasm\r\nof those regions that even the least zealous partisans of the king\r\ndid their part in preparing a decisive blow in behalf of the defeated\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nHulot received no answer to the questions and the frequent reports which\r\nhe addressed to the government in Paris.\r\n\r\nBut the news of the almost magical return of General Bonaparte and the\r\nevents of the 18th Brumaire were soon current in the air. The military\r\ncommanders of the West understood then the silence of the ministers.\r\nNevertheless, they were only the more impatient to be released from\r\nthe responsibility that weighed upon them; and they were in every way\r\ndesirous of knowing what measures the new government was likely to take.\r\nWhen it was known to these soldiers that General Bonaparte was appointed\r\nFirst Consul of the Republic their joy was great; they saw, for the\r\nfirst time, one of their own profession called to the management of the\r\nnation. France, which had made an idol of this young hero, quivered with\r\nhope. The vigor and energy of the nation revived. Paris, weary of its\r\nlong gloom, gave itself up to fetes and pleasures of which it had been\r\nso long deprived. The first acts of the Consulate did not diminish any\r\nhopes, and Liberty felt no alarm. The First Consul issued a proclamation\r\nto the inhabitants of the West. The eloquent allocutions addressed to\r\nthe masses which Bonaparte had, as it were, invented, produced effects\r\nin those days of patriotism and miracle that were absolutely startling.\r\nHis voice echoed through the world like the voice of a prophet, for none\r\nof his proclamations had, as yet, been belied by defeat.\r\n\r\n  INHABITANTS:\r\n\r\n  An impious war again inflames the West.\r\n\r\n  The makers of these troubles are traitors sold to the English, or\r\n  brigands who seek in civil war opportunity and license for\r\n  misdeeds.\r\n\r\n  To such men the government owes no forbearance, nor any\r\n  declaration of its principles.\r\n\r\n  But there are citizens, dear to France, who have been misled by\r\n  their wiles. It is so such that truth and light are due.\r\n\r\n  Unjust laws have been promulgated and executed; arbitrary acts\r\n  have threatened the safety of citizens and the liberty of\r\n  consciences; mistaken entries on the list of _emigres_ imperil\r\n  citizens; the great principles of social order have been violated.\r\n\r\n  The Consuls declare that liberty of worship having been guaranteed\r\n  by the Constitution, the law of 11 Prairial, year III., which\r\n  gives the use of edifices built for religious worship to all\r\n  citizens, shall be executed.\r\n\r\n  The government will pardon; it will be merciful to repentance; its\r\n  mercy will be complete and absolute; but it will punish whosoever,\r\n  after this declaration, shall dare to resist the national\r\n  sovereignty.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Hulot, after the public reading of this Consular manifesto,\r\n"Isn\'t that paternal enough? But you\'ll see that not a single royalist\r\nbrigand will be changed by it."\r\n\r\nThe commandant was right. The proclamation merely served to strengthen\r\neach side in their own convictions. A few days later Hulot and his\r\ncolleagues received reinforcements. The new minister of war notified\r\nthem that General Brune was appointed to command the troops in the west\r\nof France. Hulot, whose experience was known to the government, had\r\nprovisional control in the departments of the Orne and Mayenne. An\r\nunusual activity began to show itself in the government offices.\r\nCirculars from the minister of war and the minister of police gave\r\nnotice that vigorous measures entrusted to the military commanders would\r\nbe taken to stifle the insurrection at its birth. But the Chouans and\r\nthe Vendeans had profited by the inaction of the Directory to rouse\r\nthe whole region and virtually take possession of it. A new Consular\r\nproclamation was therefore issued. This time, it was the general\r\nspeaking to his troops:--\r\n\r\n  SOLDIERS:\r\n\r\n  There are none but brigands, _emigres_, and hirelings of England\r\n  now remaining in the West.\r\n\r\n  The army is composed of more than fifty thousand brave men. Let me\r\n  speedily hear from them that the rebel chiefs have ceased to live.\r\n  Glory is won by toil alone; if it could be had by living in\r\n  barracks in a town, all would have it.\r\n\r\n  Soldiers, whatever be the rank you hold in the army, the gratitude\r\n  of the nation awaits you. To be worthy of it, you must brave the\r\n  inclemencies of weather, ice, snow, and the excessive coldness of\r\n  the nights; you must surprise your enemies at daybreak, and\r\n  exterminate those wretches, the disgrace of France.\r\n\r\n  Make a short and sure campaign; be inexorable to those brigands,\r\n  and maintain strict discipline.\r\n\r\n  National Guards, join the strength of your arms to that of the\r\n  line.\r\n\r\n  If you know among you any men who fraternize with the brigands,\r\n  arrest them. Let them find no refuge; pursue them; if traitors\r\n  dare to harbor and defend them, let them perish together.\r\n\r\n"What a man!" cried Hulot. "It is just as it was in the army of\r\nItaly--he rings in the mass, and he says it himself. Don\'t you call that\r\ntalking, hey?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he speaks by himself and in his own name," said Gerard, who\r\nbegan to feel alarmed at the possible results of the 18th Brumaire.\r\n\r\n"And where\'s the harm, since he\'s a soldier?" said Merle.\r\n\r\nA group of soldiers were clustered at a little distance before the same\r\nproclamation posted on a wall. As none of them could read, they gazed at\r\nit, some with a careless eye, others with curiosity, while two or three\r\nhunted about for a citizen who looked learned enough to read it to them.\r\n\r\n"Now you tell us, Clef-des-Coeurs, what that rag of a paper says," cried\r\nBeau-Pied, in a saucy tone to his comrade.\r\n\r\n"Easy to guess," replied Clef-des-Coeurs.\r\n\r\nAt these words the other men clustered round the pair, who were always\r\nready to play their parts.\r\n\r\n"Look there," continued Clef-des-Coeurs, pointing to a coarse\r\nwoodcut which headed the proclamation and represented a pair of\r\ncompasses,--which had lately superseded the level of 1793. "It means\r\nthat the troops--that\'s us--are to march firm; don\'t you see the\r\ncompasses are open, both legs apart?--that\'s an emblem."\r\n\r\n"Such much for your learning, my lad; it isn\'t an emblem--it\'s called\r\na problem. I\'ve served in the artillery," continued Beau-Pied, "and\r\nproblems were meat and drink to my officers."\r\n\r\n"I say it\'s an emblem."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a problem."\r\n\r\n"What will you bet?"\r\n\r\n"Anything."\r\n\r\n"Your German pipe?"\r\n\r\n"Done!"\r\n\r\n"By your leave, adjutant, isn\'t that thing an emblem, and not a\r\nproblem?" said Clef-des-Coeurs, following Gerard, who was thoughtfully\r\nwalking away.\r\n\r\n"It is both," he replied, gravely.\r\n\r\n"The adjutant was making fun of you," said Beau-Pied. "That paper means\r\nthat our general in Italy is promoted Consul, which is a fine grade, and\r\nwe are to get shoes and overcoats."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ONE OF FOUCHE\'S IDEAS\r\n\r\nOne morning towards the end of Brumaire just as Hulot was exercising his\r\nbrigade, now by order of his superiors wholly concentrated at Mayenne,\r\na courier arrived from Alencon with despatches, at the reading of which\r\nhis face betrayed extreme annoyance.\r\n\r\n"Forward, then!" he cried in an angry tone, sticking the papers into the\r\ncrown of his hat. "Two companies will march with me towards Mortagne.\r\nThe Chouans are there. You will accompany me," he said to Merle and\r\nGerard. "May be I created a nobleman if I can understand one word of\r\nthat despatch. Perhaps I\'m a fool! well, anyhow, forward, march! there\'s\r\nno time to lose."\r\n\r\n"Commandant, by your leave," said Merle, kicking the cover of the\r\nministerial despatch with the toe of his boot, "what is there so\r\nexasperating in that?"\r\n\r\n"God\'s thunder! nothing at all--except that we are fooled."\r\n\r\nWhen the commandant gave vent to this military oath (an object it must\r\nbe said of Republican atheistical remonstrance) it gave warning of\r\na storm; the diverse intonations of the words were degrees of a\r\nthermometer by which the brigade could judge of the patience of its\r\ncommander; the old soldier\'s frankness of nature had made this knowledge\r\nso easy that the veriest little drummer-boy knew his Hulot by heart,\r\nsimply by observing the variations of the grimace with which the\r\ncommander screwed up his cheek and snapped his eyes and vented his oath.\r\nOn this occasion the tone of smothered rage with which he uttered the\r\nwords made his two friends silent and circumspect. Even the pits of the\r\nsmall-pox which dented that veteran face seemed deeper, and the skin\r\nitself browner than usual. His broad queue, braided at the edges, had\r\nfallen upon one of his epaulettes as he replaced his three-cornered\r\nhat, and he flung it back with such fury that the ends became untied.\r\nHowever, as he stood stock-still, his hands clenched, his arms crossed\r\ntightly over his breast, his mustache bristling, Gerard ventured to ask\r\nhim presently: "Are we to start at once?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if the men have ammunition."\r\n\r\n"They have."\r\n\r\n"Shoulder arms! Left wheel, forward, march!" cried Gerard, at a sign\r\nfrom the commandant.\r\n\r\nThe drum-corps marched at the head of the two companies designated by\r\nGerard. At the first roll of the drums the commandant, who still stood\r\nplunged in thought, seemed to rouse himself, and he left the town\r\naccompanied by his two officers, to whom he said not a word. Merle and\r\nGerard looked at each other silently as if to ask, "How long is he going\r\nto keep us in suspense?" and, as they marched, they cautiously kept\r\nan observing eye on their leader, who continued to vent rambling words\r\nbetween his teeth. Several times these vague phrases sounded like oaths\r\nin the ears of his soldiers, but not one of them dared to utter a word;\r\nfor they all, when occasion demanded, maintained the stern discipline\r\nto which the veterans who had served under Bonaparte in Italy were\r\naccustomed. The greater part of them had belonged, like Hulot, to the\r\nfamous battalions which capitulated at Mayenne under a promise not to\r\nserve again on the frontier, and the army called them "Les Mayencais."\r\nIt would be difficult to find leaders and men who more thoroughly\r\nunderstood each other.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of the day after their departure Hulot and his troop were on the\r\nhigh-road to Alencon, about three miles from that town towards Mortagne,\r\nat a part of the road which leads through pastures watered by the\r\nSarthe. A picturesque vista of these meadows lay to the left, while the\r\nwoodlands on the right which flank the road and join the great forest\r\nof Menil-Broust, serve as a foil to the delightful aspect of the\r\nriver-scenery. The narrow causeway is bordered on each side by ditches\r\nthe soil of which, being constantly thrown out upon the fields, has\r\nformed high banks covered with furze,--the name given throughout the\r\nWest to this prickly gorse. This shrub, which spreads itself in thorny\r\nmasses, makes excellent fodder in winter for horses and cattle; but as\r\nlong as it was not cut the Chouans hid themselves behind its breastwork\r\nof dull green. These banks bristling with gorse, signifying to\r\ntravellers their approach to Brittany, made this part of the road at the\r\nperiod of which we write as dangerous as it was beautiful; it was these\r\ndangers which compelled the hasty departure of Hulot and his soldiers,\r\nand it was here that he at last let out the secret of his wrath.\r\n\r\nHe was now on his return, escorting an old mail-coach drawn by\r\npost-horses, which the weariness of his soldiers, after their forced\r\nmarch, was compelling to advance at a snail\'s pace. The company of Blues\r\nfrom the garrison at Mortagne, who had escorted the rickety vehicle\r\nto the limits of their district, where Hulot and his men had met them,\r\ncould be seen in the distance, on their way back to their quarters,\r\nlike so many black specks. One of Hulot\'s companies was in the rear, the\r\nother in advance of the carriage. The commandant, who was marching with\r\nMerle and Gerard between the advance guard and the carriage, suddenly\r\ngrowled out: "Ten thousand thunders! would you believe that the general\r\ndetached us from Mayenne to escort two petticoats?"\r\n\r\n"But, commandant," remarked Gerard, "when we came up just now and took\r\ncharge I observed that you bowed to them not ungraciously."\r\n\r\n"Ha! that\'s the infamy of it. Those dandies in Paris ordered the\r\ngreatest attention paid to their damned females. How dare they dishonor\r\ngood and brave patriots by trailing us after petticoats? As for me, I\r\nmarch straight, and I don\'t choose to have to do with other people\'s\r\nzigzags. When I saw Danton taking mistresses, and Barras too, I said to\r\nthem: \'Citizens, when the Republic called you to govern, it was not that\r\nyou might authorize the vices of the old regime!\' You may tell me that\r\nwomen--oh yes! we must have women, that\'s all right. Good soldiers of\r\ncourse must have women, and good women; but in times of danger, no!\r\nBesides, where would be the good of sweeping away the old abuses if\r\npatriots bring them back again? Look at the First Consul, there\'s a man!\r\nno women for him; always about his business. I\'d bet my left mustache\r\nthat he doesn\'t know the fool\'s errand we\'ve been sent on!"\r\n\r\n"But, commandant," said Merle, laughing, "I have seen the tip-end of\r\nthe nose of the young lady, and I\'ll declare the whole world needn\'t be\r\nashamed to feel an itch, as I do, to revolve round that carriage and get\r\nup a bit of a conversation."\r\n\r\n"Look out, Merle," said Gerard; "the veiled beauties have a man\r\naccompanying them who seems wily enough to catch you in a trap."\r\n\r\n"Who? that _incroyable_ whose little eyes are ferretting from one side\r\nof the road to the other, as if he saw Chouans? The fellow seems to have\r\nno legs; the moment his horse is hidden by the carriage, he looks like\r\na duck with its head sticking out of a pate. If that booby can hinder me\r\nfrom kissing the pretty linnet--"\r\n\r\n"\'Duck\'! \'linnet\'! oh, my poor Merle, you have taken wings indeed! But\r\ndon\'t trust the duck. His green eyes are as treacherous as the eyes of\r\na snake, and as sly as those of a woman who forgives her husband. I\r\ndistrust the Chouans much less than I do those lawyers whose faces are\r\nlike bottles of lemonade."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" cried Merle, gaily. "I\'ll risk it--with the commandant\'s\r\npermission. That woman has eyes like stars, and it\'s worth playing any\r\nstakes to see them."\r\n\r\n"Caught, poor fellow!" said Gerard to the commandant; "he is beginning\r\nto talk nonsense!"\r\n\r\nHulot made a face, shrugged his shoulders, and said: "Before he swallows\r\nthe soup, I advise him to smell it."\r\n\r\n"Bravo, Merle," said Gerard, "judging by his friend\'s lagging step that\r\nhe meant to let the carriage overtake him. Isn\'t he a happy fellow? He\r\nis the only man I know who can laugh over the death of a comrade without\r\nbeing thought unfeeling."\r\n\r\n"He\'s the true French soldier," said Hulot, in a grave tone.\r\n\r\n"Just look at him pulling his epaulets back to his shoulders, to show he\r\nis a captain," cried Gerard, laughing,--"as if his rank mattered!"\r\n\r\nThe coach toward which the officer was pivoting did, in fact, contain\r\ntwo women, one of whom seemed to be the servant of the other.\r\n\r\n"Such women always run in couples," said Hulot.\r\n\r\nA lean and sharp-looking little man ambled his horse sometimes before,\r\nsometimes behind the carriage; but, though he was evidently accompanying\r\nthese privileged women, no one had yet seen him speak to them. This\r\nsilence, a proof either of respect or contempt, as the case might be;\r\nthe quantity of baggage belonging to the lady, whom the commandant\r\nsneeringly called "the princess"; everything, even to the clothes of her\r\nattendant squire, stirred Hulot\'s bile. The dress of the unknown man\r\nwas a good specimen of the fashions of the day then being caricatured as\r\n"incroyable,"--unbelievable, unless seen. Imagine a person trussed up in\r\na coat, the front of which was so short that five or six inches of the\r\nwaistcoat came below it, while the skirts were so long that they hung\r\ndown behind like the tail of a cod,--the term then used to describe\r\nthem. An enormous cravat was wound about his neck in so many folds that\r\nthe little head which protruded from that muslin labyrinth certainly did\r\njustify Captain Merle\'s comparison. The stranger also wore tight-fitting\r\ntrousers and Suwaroff boots. A huge blue-and-white cameo pinned his\r\nshirt; two watch-chains hung from his belt; his hair, worn in ringlets\r\non each side of his face, concealed nearly the whole forehead; and, for\r\na last adornment, the collar of his shirt and that of his coat came so\r\nhigh that his head seemed enveloped like a bunch of flowers in a horn of\r\npaper. Add to these queer accessories, which were combined in utter want\r\nof harmony, the burlesque contradictions in color of yellow trousers,\r\nscarlet waistcoat, cinnamon coat, and a correct idea will be gained of\r\nthe supreme good taste which all dandies blindly obeyed in the first\r\nyears of the Consulate. This costume, utterly uncouth, seemed to have\r\nbeen invented as a final test of grace, and to show that there was\r\nnothing too ridiculous for fashion to consecrate. The rider seemed to\r\nbe about thirty years old, but he was really twenty-two; perhaps he\r\nowed this appearance of age to debauchery, possibly to the perils of the\r\nperiod. In spite of his preposterous dress, he had a certain elegance of\r\nmanner which proved him to be a man of some breeding.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain had dropped back close to the carriage, the dandy\r\nseemed to fathom his design, and favored it by checking his horse.\r\nMerle, who had flung him a sardonic glance, encountered one of those\r\nimpenetrable faces, trained by the vicissitudes of the Revolution to\r\nhide all, even the most insignificant, emotion. The moment the curved\r\nend of the old triangular hat and the captain\'s epaulets were seen\r\nby the occupants of the carriage, a voice of angelic sweetness said:\r\n"Monsieur l\'officier, will you have the kindness to tell us at what part\r\nof the road we now are?"\r\n\r\nThere is some inexpressible charm in the question of an unknown\r\ntraveller, if a woman,--a world of adventure is in every word; but if\r\nthe woman asks for assistance or information, proving her weakness or\r\nignorance of certain things, every man is inclined to construct some\r\nimpossible tale which shall lead to his happiness. The words, "Monsieur\r\nl\'officier," and the polite tone of the question stirred the captain\'s\r\nheart in a manner hitherto unknown to him. He tried to examine the lady,\r\nbut was cruelly disappointed, for a jealous veil concealed her features;\r\nhe could barely see her eyes, which shone through the gauze like onyx\r\ngleaming in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n"You are now three miles from Alencon, madame," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Alencon! already!" and the lady threw herself, or, rather, she gently\r\nleaned back in the carriage, and said no more.\r\n\r\n"Alencon?" said the other woman, apparently waking up; "then you\'ll see\r\nit again."\r\n\r\nShe caught sight of the captain and was silent. Merle, disappointed in\r\nhis hope of seeing the face of the beautiful incognita, began to examine\r\nthat of her companion. She was a girl about twenty-six years of age,\r\nfair, with a pretty figure and the sort of complexion, fresh and white\r\nand well-fed, which characterizes the women of Valognes, Bayeux, and the\r\nenvirons of Alencon. Her blue eyes showed no great intelligence, but a\r\ncertain firmness mingled with tender feeling. She wore a gown of some\r\ncommon woollen stuff. The fashion of her hair, done up closely under a\r\nNorman cap, without any pretension, gave a charming simplicity to her\r\nface. Her attitude, without, of course, having any of the conventional\r\nnobility of society, was not without the natural dignity of a modest\r\nyoung girl, who can look back upon her past life without a single cause\r\nfor repentance. Merle knew her at a glance for one of those wild\r\nflowers which are sometimes taken from their native fields to Parisian\r\nhot-houses, where so many blasting rays are concentrated, without ever\r\nlosing the purity of their color or their rustic simplicity. The naive\r\nattitude of the girl and her modest glance showed Merle very plainly\r\nthat she did not wish a listener. In fact, no sooner had he withdrawn\r\nthan the two women began a conversation in so low a tone that only a\r\nmurmur of it reached his ear.\r\n\r\n"You came away in such a hurry," said the country-girl, "that you hardly\r\ntook time to dress. A pretty-looking sight you are now! If we are going\r\nbeyond Alencon, you must really make your toilet."\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! Francine!" cried the lady.\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"This is the third time you have tried to make me tell you the reasons\r\nfor this journey and where we are going."\r\n\r\n"Have I said one single word which deserves that reproach?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve noticed your manoeuvring. Simple and truthful as you are,\r\nyou have learned a little cunning from me. You are beginning to hold\r\nquestioning in horror; and right enough, too, for of all the known ways\r\nof getting at a secret, questions are, to my mind, the silliest."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Francine, "since nothing escapes you, you must admit,\r\nMarie, that your conduct would excite the curiosity of a saint.\r\nYesterday without a penny, to-day your hands are full of gold; at\r\nMortagne they give you the mail-coach which was pillaged and the driver\r\nkilled, with government troops to protect you, and you are followed by a\r\nman whom I regard as your evil genius."\r\n\r\n"Who? Corentin?" said the young lady, accenting the words by two\r\ninflections of her voice expressive of contempt, a sentiment which\r\nappeared in the gesture with which she waved her hand towards the rider.\r\n"Listen, Francine," she said. "Do you remember Patriot, the monkey I\r\ntaught to imitate Danton?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\n"Well, were you afraid of him?"\r\n\r\n"He was chained."\r\n\r\n"And Corentin is muzzled, my dear."\r\n\r\n"We used to play with Patriot by the hour," said Francine,--"I know\r\nthat; but he always ended by serving us some bad trick." So saying,\r\nFrancine threw herself hastily back close to her mistress, whose\r\nhands she caught and kissed in a coaxing way; saying in a tone of deep\r\naffection: "You know what I mean, Marie, but you will not answer me. How\r\ncan you, after all that sadness which did so grieve me--oh, indeed it\r\ngrieved me!--how can you, in twenty-four hours, change about and become\r\nso gay? you, who talked of suicide! Why have you changed? I have a\r\nright to ask these questions of your soul--it is mine, my claim to it is\r\nbefore that of others, for you will never be better loved than you are\r\nby me. Speak, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\n"Why, Francine, don\'t you see all around you the secret of my good\r\nspirits? Look at the yellowing tufts of those distant tree-tops; not one\r\nis like another. As we look at them from this distance don\'t they\r\nseem like an old bit of tapestry? See the hedges from behind which the\r\nChouans may spring upon us at any moment. When I look at that gorse I\r\nfancy I can see the muzzles of their guns. Every time the road is shady\r\nunder the trees I fancy I shall hear firing, and then my heart beats and\r\na new sensation comes over me. It is neither the shuddering of fear nor\r\nan emotion of pleasure; no, it is better than either, it is the stirring\r\nof everything within me--it is life! Why shouldn\'t I be gay when a\r\nlittle excitement is dropped into my monotonous existence?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! you are telling me nothing, cruel girl! Holy Virgin!" added\r\nFrancine, raising her eyes in distress to heaven; "to whom will she\r\nconfess herself if she denies the truth to me?"\r\n\r\n"Francine," said the lady, in a grave tone, "I can\'t explain to you my\r\npresent enterprise; it is horrible."\r\n\r\n"Why do wrong when you know it to be wrong?"\r\n\r\n"How can I help it? I catch myself thinking as if I were fifty, and\r\nacting as if I were still fifteen. You have always been my better self,\r\nmy poor Francine, but in this affair I must stifle conscience. And," she\r\nadded after a pause, "I cannot. Therefore, how can you expect me to take\r\na confessor as stern as you?" and she patted the girl\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"When did I ever blame your actions?" cried Francine. "Evil is so mixed\r\nwith good in your nature. Yes, Saint Anne of Auray, to whom I pray to\r\nsave you, will absolve you for all you do. And, Marie, am I not here\r\nbeside you, without so much as knowing where you go?" and she kissed her\r\nhands with effusion.\r\n\r\n"But," replied Marie, "you may yet desert me, if your conscience--"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, mademoiselle," cried Francine, with a hurt expression. "But\r\nsurely you will tell me--"\r\n\r\n"Nothing!" said the young lady, in a resolute voice. "Only--and I wish\r\nyou to know it--I hate this enterprise even more than I hate him whose\r\ngilded tongue induced me to undertake it. I will be rank and own to you\r\nthat I would never have yielded to their wishes if I had not foreseen,\r\nin this ignoble farce, a mingling of love and danger which tempted me.\r\nI cannot bear to leave this empty world without at least attempting to\r\ngather the flowers that it owes me,--whether I perish in the attempt or\r\nnot. But remember, for the honor of my memory, that had I ever been a\r\nhappy woman, the sight of their great knife, ready to fall upon my neck,\r\nwould not have driven me to accept a part in this tragedy--for it is\r\na tragedy. But now," she said, with a gesture of disgust, "if it were\r\ncountermanded, I should instantly fling myself into the Sarthe. It would\r\nnot be destroying life, for I have never lived."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Saint Anne of Auray, forgive her!"\r\n\r\n"What are you so afraid of? You know very well that the dull round of\r\ndomestic life gives no opportunity for my passions. That would be bad in\r\nmost women, I admit; but my soul is made of a higher sensibility and can\r\nbear great tests. I might have been, perhaps, a gentle being like you.\r\nWhy, why have I risen above or sunk beneath the level of my sex? Ah!\r\nthe wife of Bonaparte is a happy woman! Yes, I shall die young, for I\r\nam gay, as you say,--gay at this pleasure-party, where there is blood to\r\ndrink, as that poor Danton used to say. There, there, forget what I\r\nam saying; it is the woman of fifty who speaks. Thank God! the girl of\r\nfifteen is still within me."\r\n\r\nThe young country-girl shuddered. She alone knew the fiery, impetuous\r\nnature of her mistress. She alone was initiated into the mysteries of a\r\nsoul rich with enthusiasm, into the secret emotions of a being who, up\r\nto this time, had seen life pass her like a shadow she could not grasp,\r\neager as she was to do so. After sowing broadcast with full hands and\r\nharvesting nothing, this woman was still virgin in soul, but irritated\r\nby a multitude of baffled desires. Weary of a struggle without an\r\nadversary, she had reached in her despair to the point of preferring\r\ngood to evil, if it came in the form of enjoyment; evil to good, if\r\nit offered her some poetic emotion; misery to mediocrity, as something\r\nnobler and higher; the gloomy and mysterious future of present death to\r\na life without hopes or even without sufferings. Never in any heart was\r\nso much powder heaped ready for the spark, never were so many riches\r\nfor love to feed on; no daughter of Eve was ever moulded, with a greater\r\nmixture of gold in her clay. Francine, like an angel of earth, watched\r\nover this being whose perfections she adored, believing that she obeyed\r\na celestial mandate in striving to bring that spirit back among the\r\nchoir of seraphim whence it was banished for the sin of pride.\r\n\r\n"There is the clock-tower of Alencon," said the horseman, riding up to\r\nthe carriage.\r\n\r\n"I see it," replied the young lady, in a cold tone.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well," he said, turning away with all the signs of servile\r\nsubmission, in spite of his disappointment.\r\n\r\n"Go faster," said the lady to the postilion. "There is no longer any\r\ndanger; go at a fast trot, or even a gallop, if you can; we are almost\r\ninto Alencon."\r\n\r\nAs the carriage passed the commandant, she called out to him, in a sweet\r\nvoice:--\r\n\r\n"We will meet at the inn, commandant. Come and see me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," growled the commandant. "\'The inn\'! \'Come and see me\'! Is\r\nthat how you speak to an officer in command of the army?" and he shook\r\nhis fist at the carriage, which was now rolling rapidly along the road.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be vexed, commandant, she has got your rank as general up her\r\nsleeve," said Corentin, laughing, as he endeavored to put his horse into\r\na gallop to overtake the carriage.\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t let myself be fooled by any such folks as they," said Hulot\r\nto his two friends, in a growling tone. "I\'d rather throw my general\'s\r\ncoat into that ditch than earn it out of a bed. What are these birds\r\nafter? Have you any idea, either of you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Merle, "I\'ve an idea that that\'s the handsomest women I ever\r\nsaw! I think you\'re reading the riddle all wrong. Perhaps she\'s the wife\r\nof the First Consul."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! the First Consul\'s wife is old, and this woman is young," said\r\nHulot. "Besides, the order I received from the minister gives her name\r\nas Mademoiselle de Verneuil. She is a _ci-devant_. Don\'t I know \'em?\r\nThey all plied one trade before the Revolution, and any man could make\r\nhimself a major, or a general in double-quick time; all he had to do was\r\nto say \'Dear heart\' to them now and then."\r\n\r\nWhile each soldier opened his compasses, as the commandant was wont to\r\nsay, the miserable vehicle which was then used as the mail-coach drew up\r\nbefore the inn of the Trois Maures, in the middle of the main street of\r\nAlencon. The sound of the wheels brought the landlord to the door. No\r\none in Alencon could have expected the arrival of the mail-coach at the\r\nTrois Maures, for the murderous attack upon the coach at Mortagne was\r\nalready known, and so many people followed it along the street that the\r\ntwo women, anxious to escape the curiosity of the crowd, ran quickly\r\ninto the kitchen, which forms the inevitable antechamber to all Western\r\ninns. The landlord was about to follow them, after examining the coach,\r\nwhen the postilion caught him by the arm.\r\n\r\n"Attention, citizen Brutus," he said; "there\'s an escort of the Blues\r\nbehind us; but it is I who bring you these female citizens; they\'ll pay\r\nlike _ci-devant_ princesses, therefore--"\r\n\r\n"Therefore, we\'ll drink a glass of wine together presently, my lad,"\r\nsaid the landlord.\r\n\r\nAfter glancing about the kitchen, blackened with smoke, and noticing a\r\ntable bloody from raw meat, Mademoiselle de Verneuil flew into the next\r\nroom with the celerity of a bird; for she shuddered at the sight and\r\nsmell of the place, and feared the inquisitive eyes of a dirty _chef_,\r\nand a fat little woman who examined her attentively.\r\n\r\n"What are we to do, wife?" said the landlord. "Who the devil could have\r\nsupposed we would have so many on our hands in these days? Before I\r\nserve her a decent breakfast that woman will get impatient. Stop, an\r\nidea! evidently she is a person of quality. I\'ll propose to put her with\r\nthe one we have upstairs. What do you think?"\r\n\r\nWhen the landlord went to look for the new arrival he found only\r\nFrancine, to whom he spoke in a low voice, taking her to the farther end\r\nof the kitchen, so as not to be overheard.\r\n\r\n"If the ladies wish," he said, "to be served in private, as I have no\r\ndoubt they wish to do, I have a very nice breakfast all ready for a lady\r\nand her son, and I dare say wouldn\'t mind sharing it with you; they are\r\npersons of condition," he added, mysteriously.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly said the words before he felt a tap on his back from\r\nthe handle of a whip. He turned hastily and saw behind him a short,\r\nthick-set man, who had noiselessly entered from a side room,--an\r\napparition which seemed to terrify the hostess, the cook, and the\r\nscullion. The landlord turned pale when he saw the intruder, who shook\r\nback the hair which concealed his forehead and eyes, raised himself on\r\nthe points of his toes to reach the other\'s ears, and said to him in\r\na whisper: "You know the cost of an imprudence or a betrayal, and the\r\ncolor of the money we pay it in. We are generous in that coin."\r\n\r\nHe added a gesture which was like a horrible commentary to his words.\r\nThough the rotundity of the landlord prevented Francine from seeing\r\nthe stranger, who stood behind him, she caught certain words of his\r\nthreatening speech, and was thunderstruck at hearing the hoarse tones of\r\na Breton voice. She sprang towards the man, but he, seeming to move with\r\nthe agility of a wild animal, had already darted through a side door\r\nwhich opened on the courtyard. Utterly amazed, she ran to the window.\r\nThrough its panes, yellowed with smoke, she caught sight of the stranger\r\nas he was about to enter the stable. Before doing so, however, he turned\r\na pair of black eyes to the upper story of the inn, and thence to the\r\nmail-coach in the yard, as if to call some friend\'s attention to the\r\nvehicle. In spite of his muffling goatskin and thanks to this movement\r\nwhich allowed her to see his face, Francine recognized the Chouan,\r\nMarche-a-Terre, with his heavy whip; she saw him, indistinctly, in the\r\nobscurity of the stable, fling himself down on a pile of straw, in a\r\nposition which enabled him to keep an eye on all that happened at the\r\ninn. Marche-a-Terre curled himself up in such a way that the cleverest\r\nspy, at any distance far or near, might have taken him for one of those\r\nhuge dogs that drag the hand-carts, lying asleep with his muzzle on his\r\npaws.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the Chouan proved to Francine that he had not recognized\r\nher. Under the hazardous circumstances which she felt her mistress to\r\nbe in, she scarcely knew whether to regret or to rejoice in this\r\nunconsciousness. But the mysterious connection between the landlord\'s\r\noffer (not uncommon among innkeepers, who can thus kill two birds with\r\none stone), and the Chouan\'s threats, piqued her curiosity. She left the\r\ndirty window from which she could see the formless heap which she\r\nknew to be Marche-a-Terre, and returned to the landlord, who was still\r\nstanding in the attitude of a man who feels he has made a blunder, and\r\ndoes not know how to get out of it. The Chouan\'s gesture had petrified\r\nthe poor fellow. No one in the West was ignorant of the cruel\r\nrefinements of torture with which the "Chasseurs du Roi" punished those\r\nwho were even suspected of indiscretion; the landlord felt their knives\r\nalready at his throat. The cook looked with a shudder at the iron stove\r\non which they often "warmed" ("chauffaient") the feet of those they\r\nsuspected. The fat landlady held a knife in one hand and a half-peeled\r\npotato in the other, and gazed at her husband with a stupefied air.\r\nEven the scullion puzzled himself to know the reason of their speechless\r\nterror. Francine\'s curiosity was naturally excited by this silent scene,\r\nthe principal actor of which was visible to all, though departed. The\r\ngirl was gratified at the evident power of the Chouan, and though by\r\nnature too simple and humble for the tricks of a lady\'s maid, she was\r\nalso far too anxious to penetrate the mystery not to profit by her\r\nadvantages on this occasion.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle accepts your proposal," she said to the landlord, who\r\njumped as if suddenly awakened by her words.\r\n\r\n"What proposal?" he asked with genuine surprise.\r\n\r\n"What proposal?" asked Corentin, entering the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"What proposal?" asked Mademoiselle de Verneuil, returning to it.\r\n\r\n"What proposal?" asked a fourth individual on the lower step of the\r\nstaircase, who now sprang lightly into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Why, the breakfast with your persons of distinction," replied Francine,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"Distinction!" said the ringing and ironical voice of the person who had\r\njust come down the stairway. "My good fellow, that strikes me as a very\r\npoor inn joke; but if it\'s the company of this young female citizen that\r\nyou want to give us, we should be fools to refuse it. In my mother\'s\r\nabsence, I accept," he added, striking the astonished innkeeper on the\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nThe charming heedlessness of youth disguised the haughty insolence\r\nof the words, which drew the attention of every one present to the\r\nnew-comer. The landlord at once assumed the countenance of Pilate\r\nwashing his hands of the blood of that just man; he slid back two steps\r\nto reach his wife\'s ear, and whispered, "You are witness, if any harm\r\ncomes of it, that it is not my fault. But, anyhow," he added, in a voice\r\nthat was lower still, "go and tell Monsieur Marche-a-Terre what has\r\nhappened."\r\n\r\nThe traveller, who was a young man of medium height, wore a dark blue\r\ncoat and high black gaiters coming above the knee and over the breeches,\r\nwhich were also of blue cloth. This simple uniform, without epaulets,\r\nwas that of the pupils of the Ecole Polytechnique. Beneath this plain\r\nattire Mademoiselle de Verneuil could distinguish at a glance the\r\nelegant shape and nameless _something_ that tells of natural nobility.\r\nThe face of the young man, which was rather ordinary at first sight,\r\nsoon attracted the eye by the conformation of certain features which\r\nrevealed a soul capable of great things. A bronzed skin, curly fair\r\nhair, sparkling blue eyes, a delicate nose, motions full of ease, all\r\ndisclosed a life guided by noble sentiments and trained to the habit\r\nof command. But the most characteristic signs of his nature were in the\r\nchin, which was dented like that of Bonaparte, and in the lower lip,\r\nwhich joined the upper one with a graceful curve, like that of an\r\nacanthus leaf on the capital of a Corinthian column. Nature had given to\r\nthese two features of his face an irresistible charm.\r\n\r\n"This young man has singular distinction if he is really a republican,"\r\nthought Mademoiselle de Verneuil.\r\n\r\nTo see all this at a glance, to brighten at the thought of pleasing, to\r\nbend her head softly and smile coquettishly and cast a soft look able to\r\nrevive a heart that was dead to love, to veil her long black eyes with\r\nlids whose curving lashes made shadows on her cheeks, to choose the\r\nmelodious tones of her voice and give a penetrating charm to the formal\r\nwords, "Monsieur, we are very much obliged to you,"--all this charming\r\nby-play took less time than it has taken to describe it. After this,\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, addressing the landlord, asked to be shown to\r\na room, saw the staircase, and disappeared with Francine, leaving the\r\nstranger to discover whether her reply was intended as an acceptance or\r\na refusal.\r\n\r\n"Who is that woman?" asked the Polytechnique student, in an airy manner,\r\nof the landlord, who still stood motionless and bewildered.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the female citizen Verneuil," replied Corentin, sharply, looking\r\njealously at the questioner; "a _ci-devant_; what is she to you?"\r\n\r\nThe stranger, who was humming a revolutionary tune, turned his head\r\nhaughtily towards Corentin. The two young men looked at each other for\r\na moment like cocks about to fight, and the glance they exchanged\r\ngave birth to a hatred which lasted forever. The blue eye of the young\r\nsoldier was as frank and honest as the green eye of the other man was\r\nfalse and malicious; the manners of the one had native grandeur, those\r\nof the other were insinuating; one was eager in his advance, the other\r\ndeprecating; one commanded respect, the other sought it.\r\n\r\n"Is the citizen du Gua Saint-Cyr here?" said a peasant, entering the\r\nkitchen at that moment.\r\n\r\n"What do you want of him?" said the young man, coming forward.\r\n\r\nThe peasant made a low bow and gave him a letter, which the young\r\ncadet read and threw into the fire; then he nodded his head and the man\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\n"No doubt you\'ve come from Paris, citizen?" said Corentin, approaching\r\nthe stranger with a certain ease of manner, and a pliant, affable air\r\nwhich seemed intolerable to the citizen du Gua.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied, shortly.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have been graduated into some grade of the artillery?"\r\n\r\n"No, citizen, into the navy."\r\n\r\n"Ah! then you are going to Brest?" said Corentin, interrogatively.\r\n\r\nBut the young sailor turned lightly on the heels of his shoes without\r\ndeigning to reply, and presently disappointed all the expectations which\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil had based on the charm of his appearance. He\r\napplied himself to ordering his breakfast with the eagerness of a boy,\r\nquestioned the cook and the landlady about their receipts, wondered at\r\nprovincial customs like a Parisian just out of his shell, made as\r\nmany objections as any fine lady, and showed the more lack of mind\r\nand character because his face and manner had seemed to promise them.\r\nCorentin smiled with pity when he saw the face he made on tasting the\r\nbest cider of Normandy.\r\n\r\n"Heu!" he cried; "how can you swallow such stuff as that? It is meat and\r\ndrink both. I don\'t wonder the Republic distrusts a province where they\r\nknock their harvest from trees with poles, and shoot travellers from the\r\nditches. Pray don\'t put such medicine as that on the table; give us some\r\ngood Bordeaux, white and red. And above all, do see if there is a good\r\nfire upstairs. These country-people are so backward in civilization!" he\r\nadded. "Alas!" he sighed, "there is but one Paris in the world; what\r\na pity it is I can\'t transport it to sea! Heavens! spoil-sauce!" he\r\nsuddenly cried out to the cook; "what makes you put vinegar in that\r\nfricassee when you have lemons? And, madame," he added, "you gave me\r\nsuch coarse sheets I couldn\'t close my eyes all night." Then he began\r\nto twirl a huge cane, executing with a silly sort of care a variety\r\nof evolutions, the greater or less precision and agility of which\r\nwere considered proofs of a young man\'s standing in the class of the\r\nIncroyables, so-called.\r\n\r\n"And it is with such dandies as that," said Corentin to the landlord\r\nconfidentially, watching his face, "that the Republic expects to improve\r\nher navy!"\r\n\r\n"That man," said the young sailor to the landlady, in a low voice, "is\r\na spy of Fouche\'s. He has \'police\' stamped on his face, and I\'ll swear\r\nthat spot he has got on his chin is Paris mud. Well, set a thief to\r\ncatch--"\r\n\r\nJust then a lady to whom the young sailor turned with every sign of\r\noutward respect, entered the kitchen of the inn.\r\n\r\n"My dear mamma," he said. "I am glad you\'ve come. I have recruited some\r\nguests in your absence."\r\n\r\n"Guests?" she replied; "what folly!"\r\n\r\n"It is Mademoiselle de Verneuil," he said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"She perished on the scaffold after the affair of Savenay; she went to\r\nMans to save her brother the Prince de Loudon," returned his mother,\r\nrather brusquely.\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken, madame," said Corentin, gently, emphasizing the word\r\n"madame"; "there are two demoiselles de Verneuil; all great houses, as\r\nyou know, have several branches."\r\n\r\nThe lady, surprised at this freedom, drew back a few steps to examine\r\nthe speaker; she turned her black eyes upon him, full of the keen\r\nsagacity so natural to women, seeking apparently to discover in what\r\ninterest he stepped forth to explain Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s birth.\r\nCorentin, on the other hand, who was studying the lady cautiously,\r\ndenied her in his own mind the joys of motherhood and gave her those\r\nof love; he refused the possession of a son of twenty to a woman whose\r\ndazzling skin, and arched eyebrows, and lashes still unblemished, were\r\nthe objects of his admiration, and whose abundant black hair, parted\r\non the forehead into simple bands, bought out the youthfulness of an\r\nintelligent head. The slight lines of the brow, far from indicating age,\r\nrevealed young passions. Though the piercing eyes were somewhat veiled,\r\nit was either from the fatigue of travelling or the too frequent\r\nexpression of excitement. Corentin remarked that she was wrapped in a\r\nmantle of English material, and that the shape of her hat, foreign no\r\ndoubt, did not belong to any of the styles called Greek, which ruled the\r\nParisian fashions of the period. Corentin was one of those beings who\r\nare compelled by the bent of their natures to suspect evil rather than\r\ngood, and he instantly doubted the citizenship of the two travellers.\r\nThe lady, who, on her side, had made her observations on the person of\r\nCorentin with equal rapidity, turned to her son with a significant look\r\nwhich may be faithfully translated into the words: "Who is this queer\r\nman? Is he of our stripe?"\r\n\r\nTo this mute inquiry the youth replied by an attitude and a gesture\r\nwhich said: "Faith! I can\'t tell; but I distrust him." Then, leaving his\r\nmother to fathom the mystery, he turned to the landlady and whispered:\r\n"Try to find out who that fellow is; and whether he is really\r\naccompanying the young lady; and why."\r\n\r\n"So," said Madame du Gua, looking at Corentin, "you are quite sure,\r\ncitizen, that Mademoiselle de Verneuil is living?"\r\n\r\n"She is living in flesh and blood as surely, _madame_, as the citizen du\r\nGua Saint-Cyr."\r\n\r\nThis answer contained a sarcasm, the hidden meaning of which was known\r\nto none but the lady herself, and any one but herself would have been\r\ndisconcerted by it. Her son looked fixedly at Corentin, who coolly\r\npulled out his watch without appearing to notice the effect of his\r\nanswer. The lady, uneasy and anxious to discover at once if the speech\r\nmeant danger or was merely accidental, said to Corentin in a natural\r\ntone and manner; "How little security there is on these roads. We were\r\nattacked by Chouans just beyond Mortagne. My son came very near being\r\nkilled; he received two balls in his hat while protecting me."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible, madame? were you in the mail-coach which those brigands\r\nrobbed in spite of the escort,--the one we have just come by? You\r\nmust know the vehicle well. They told me at Mortagne that the Chouans\r\nnumbered a couple of thousands and that every one in the coach was\r\nkilled, even the travellers. That\'s how history is written! Alas!\r\nmadame," he continued, "if they murder travellers so near to Paris you\r\ncan fancy how unsafe the roads are in Brittany. I shall return to Paris\r\nand not risk myself any farther."\r\n\r\n"Is Mademoiselle de Verneuil young and handsome?" said the lady to the\r\nhostess, struck suddenly with an idea.\r\n\r\nJust then the landlord interrupted the conversation, in which there was\r\nsomething of an angry element, by announcing that breakfast was ready.\r\nThe young sailor offered his hand to his mother with an air of false\r\nfamiliarity that confirmed the suspicions of Corentin, to whom the youth\r\nremarked as he went up the stairway: "Citizen, if you are travelling\r\nwith the female citizen de Verneuil, and she accepts the landlord\'s\r\nproposal, you can come too."\r\n\r\nThough the words were said in a careless tone and were not inviting,\r\nCorentin followed. The young man squeezed the lady\'s hand when they were\r\nfive or six steps above him, and said, in a low voice: "Now you see\r\nthe dangers to which your imprudent enterprises, which have no glory in\r\nthem, expose us. If we are discovered, how are we to escape? And what a\r\ncontemptible role you force me to play!"\r\n\r\nAll three reached a large room on the upper floor. Any one who has\r\ntravelled in the West will know that the landlord had, on such an\r\noccasion, brought forth his best things to do honor to his guests, and\r\nprepared the meal with no ordinary luxury. The table was carefully laid.\r\nThe warmth of a large fire took the dampness from the room. The linen,\r\nglass, and china were not too dingy. Corentin saw at once that the\r\nlandlord had, as they say familiarly, cut himself into quarters to\r\nplease the strangers. "Consequently," thought he, "these people are\r\nnot what they pretend to be. That young man is clever. I took him for a\r\nfool, but I begin to believe him as shrewd as myself."\r\n\r\nThe sailor, his mother, and Corentin awaited Mademoiselle de Verneuil,\r\nwhom the landlord went to summon. But the handsome traveller did not\r\ncome. The youth expected that she would make difficulties, and he left\r\nthe room, humming the popular song, "Guard the nation\'s safety," and\r\nwent to that of Mademoiselle de Verneuil, prompted by a keen desire to\r\nget the better of her scruples and take her back with him. Perhaps he\r\nwanted to solve the doubts which filled his mind; or else to exercise\r\nthe power which all men like to think they wield over a pretty woman.\r\n\r\n"May I be hanged if he\'s a Republican," thought Corentin, as he saw him\r\ngo. "He moves his shoulders like a courtier. And if that\'s his mother,"\r\nhe added, mentally, looking at Madame du Gua, "I\'m the Pope! They are\r\nChouans; and I\'ll make sure of their quality."\r\n\r\nThe door soon opened and the young man entered, holding the hand of\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, whom he led to the table with an air of\r\nself-conceit that was nevertheless courteous. The devil had not allowed\r\nthat hour which had elapsed since the lady\'s arrival to be wasted. With\r\nFrancine\'s assistance, Mademoiselle de Verneuil had armed herself with a\r\ntravelling-dress more dangerous, perhaps, than any ball-room attire. Its\r\nsimplicity had precisely that attraction which comes of the skill with\r\nwhich a woman, handsome enough to wear no ornaments, reduces her dress\r\nto the position of a secondary charm. She wore a green gown, elegantly\r\ncut, the jacket of which, braided and frogged, defined her figure in a\r\nmanner that was hardly suitable for a young girl, allowing her supple\r\nwaist and rounded bust and graceful motions to be fully seen. She\r\nentered the room smiling, with the natural amenity of women who can show\r\na fine set of teeth, transparent as porcelain between rosy lips, and\r\ndimpling cheeks as fresh as those of childhood. Having removed the close\r\nhood which had almost concealed her head at her first meeting with\r\nthe young sailor, she could now employ at her ease the various little\r\nartifices, apparently so artless, with which a woman shows off the\r\nbeauties of her face and the grace of her head, and attracts admiration\r\nfor them. A certain harmony between her manners and her dress made her\r\nseem so much younger than she was that Madame du Gua thought herself\r\nbeyond the mark in supposing her over twenty. The coquetry of her\r\napparel, evidently worn to please, was enough to inspire hope in the\r\nyoung man\'s breast; but Mademoiselle de Verneuil bowed to him, as\r\nshe took her place, with a slight inclination of her head and without\r\nlooking at him, putting him aside with an apparently light-hearted\r\ncarelessness which disconcerted him. This coolness might have seemed to\r\nan observer neither caution nor coquetry, but indifference, natural or\r\nfeigned. The candid expression on the young lady\'s face only made it the\r\nmore impenetrable. She showed no consciousness of her charms, and was\r\napparently gifted with the pretty manners that win all hearts, and\r\nhad already duped the natural self-conceit of the young sailor. Thus\r\nbaffled, the youth returned to his own seat with a sort of vexation.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil took Francine, who accompanied her, by the hand\r\nand said, in a caressing voice, turning to Madame de Gua: "Madame, will\r\nyou have the kindness to allow this young girl, who is more a friend\r\nthan a servant to me, to sit with us? In these perilous times such\r\ndevotion as hers can only be repaid by the heart; indeed, that is very\r\nnearly all that is left to us."\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua replied to the last words, which were said half aside,\r\nwith a rather unceremonious bow that betrayed her annoyance at the\r\nbeauty of the new-comer. Then she said, in a low voice, to her son:\r\n"\'Perilous times,\' \'devotion,\' \'madame,\' \'servant\'! that is not\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil; it is some girl sent here by Fouche."\r\n\r\nThe guests were about to sit down when Mademoiselle de Verneuil noticed\r\nCorentin, who was still employed in a close scrutiny of the mother and\r\nson, who were showing some annoyance at his glances.\r\n\r\n"Citizen," she said to him, "you are no doubt too well bred to dog my\r\nsteps. The Republic, when it sent my parents to the scaffold, did not\r\nmagnanimously provide me with a guardian. Though you have, from extreme\r\nand chivalric gallantry accompanied me against my will to this place"\r\n(she sighed), "I am quite resolved not to allow your protecting care to\r\nbecome a burden to you. I am safe now, and you can leave me."\r\n\r\nShe gave him a fixed and contemptuous look. Corentin understood her; he\r\nrepressed the smile which almost curled the corners of his wily lips as\r\nhe bowed to her respectfully.\r\n\r\n"Citoyenne," he said, "it is always an honor to obey you. Beauty is the\r\nonly queen a Republican can serve."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil\'s eyes, as she watched him depart, shone\r\nwith such natural pleasure, she looked at Francine with a smile of\r\nintelligence which betrayed so much real satisfaction, that Madame du\r\nGua, who grew prudent as she grew jealous, felt disposed to relinquish\r\nthe suspicions which Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s great beauty had forced\r\ninto her mind.\r\n\r\n"It may be Mademoiselle de Verneuil, after all," she whispered to her\r\nson.\r\n\r\n"But that escort?" answered the young man, whose vexation at the young\r\nlady\'s indifference allowed him to be cautious. "Is she a prisoner or an\r\nemissary, a friend or an enemy of the government?"\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua made a sign as if to say that she would soon clear up the\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nHowever, the departure of Corentin seemed to lessen the young man\'s\r\ndistrust, and he began to cast on Mademoiselle de Verneuil certain\r\nlooks which betrayed an immoderate admiration for women, rather than\r\nthe respectful warmth of a dawning passion. The young girl grew more and\r\nmore reserved, and gave all her attentions to Madame du Gua. The youth,\r\nangry with himself, tried, in his vexation, to turn the tables and\r\nseem indifferent. Mademoiselle de Verneuil appeared not to notice this\r\nmanoeuvre; she continued to be simple without shyness and reserved\r\nwithout prudery.\r\n\r\nThis chance meeting of personages who, apparently, were not destined to\r\nbecome intimate, awakened no agreeable sympathy on either side. There\r\nwas even a sort of vulgar embarrassment, an awkwardness which destroyed\r\nall the pleasure which Mademoiselle de Verneuil and the young sailor\r\nhad begun by expecting. But women have such wonderful conventional tact,\r\nthey are so intimately allied with each other, or they have such keen\r\ndesires for emotion, that they always know how to break the ice on such\r\noccasions. Suddenly, as if the two beauties had the same thought, they\r\nbegan to tease their solitary knight in a playful way, and were soon\r\nvying with each other in the jesting attention which they paid to him;\r\nthis unanimity of action left them free. At the end of half an hour, the\r\ntwo women, already secret enemies, were apparently the best of friends.\r\nThe young man then discovered that he felt as angry with Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil for her friendliness and freedom as he had been with her\r\nreserve. In fact, he was so annoyed by it that he regretted, with a sort\r\nof dumb anger, having allowed her to breakfast with them.\r\n\r\n"Madame," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, "is your son always as gloomy\r\nas he is at this moment?"\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," he replied, "I ask myself what is the good of a fleeting\r\nhappiness. The secret of my gloom is the evanescence of my pleasure."\r\n\r\n"That is a madrigal," she said, laughing, "which rings of the Court\r\nrather than the Polytechnique."\r\n\r\n"My son only expressed a very natural thought, mademoiselle," said\r\nMadame du Gua, who had her own reasons for placating the stranger.\r\n\r\n"Then laugh while you may," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, smiling at\r\nthe young man. "How do you look when you have really something to weep\r\nfor, if what you are pleased to call a happiness makes you so dismal?"\r\n\r\nThis smile, accompanied by a provoking glance which destroyed the\r\nconsistency of her reserve, revived the youth\'s feelings. But inspired\r\nby her nature, which often impels a woman to do either too much or\r\ntoo little under such circumstances, Mademoiselle de Verneuil, having\r\ncovered the young man with that brilliant look full of love\'s promises,\r\nimmediately withdrew from his answering expression into a cold and\r\nsevere modesty,--a conventional performance by which a woman sometimes\r\nhides a true emotion. In a moment, a single moment, when each expected\r\nto see the eyelids of the other lowered, they had communicated to one\r\nanother their real thoughts; but they veiled their glances as quickly as\r\nthey had mingled them in that one flash which convulsed their hearts\r\nand enlightened them. Confused at having said so many things in a\r\nsingle glance, they dared no longer look at each other. Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil withdrew into cold politeness, and seemed to be impatient for\r\nthe conclusion of the meal.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle, you must have suffered very much in prison?" said Madame\r\ndu Gua.\r\n\r\n"Alas, madame, I sometimes think that I am still there."\r\n\r\n"Is your escort sent to protect you, mademoiselle, or to watch you? Are\r\nyou still suspected by the Republic?"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle felt instinctively that Madame du Gua had no real interest\r\nin her, and the question alarmed her.\r\n\r\n"Madame," she replied, "I really do not know myself the exact nature of\r\nmy relations to the Republic."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it fears you?" said the young man, rather satirically.\r\n\r\n"We must respect her secrets," interposed Madame du Gua.\r\n\r\n"Oh, madame, the secrets of a young girl who knows nothing of life but\r\nits misfortunes are not interesting."\r\n\r\n"But," answered Madame du Gua, wishing to continue a conversation which\r\nmight reveal to her all that she wanted to know, "the First Consul seems\r\nto have excellent intentions. They say that he is going to remove the\r\ndisabilities of the _emigres_."\r\n\r\n"That is true, madame," she replied, with rather too much eagerness,\r\n"and if so, why do we rouse Brittany and La Vendee? Why bring civil war\r\ninto France?"\r\n\r\nThis eager cry, in which she seemed to share her own reproach, made\r\nthe young sailor quiver. He looked earnestly at her, but was unable\r\nto detect either hatred or love upon her face. Her beautiful skin, the\r\ndelicacy of which was shown by the color beneath it, was impenetrable. A\r\nsudden and invincible curiosity attracted him to this strange creature,\r\nto whom he was already drawn by violent desires.\r\n\r\n"Madame," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, after a pause, "may I ask if\r\nyou are going to Mayenne?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mademoiselle," replied the young man with a questioning look.\r\n\r\n"Then, madame," she continued, "as your son serves the Republic" (she\r\nsaid the words with an apparently indifferent air, but she gave her\r\ncompanions one of those furtive glances the art of which belongs to\r\nwomen and diplomatists), "you must fear the Chouans, and an escort is\r\nnot to be despised. We are now almost travelling companions, and I hope\r\nyou will come with me to Mayenne."\r\n\r\nMother and son hesitated, and seemed to consult each other\'s faces.\r\n\r\n"I am not sure, mademoiselle," said the young man, "that it is prudent\r\nin me to tell you that interests of the highest importance require our\r\npresence to-night in the neighborhood of Fougeres, and we have not yet\r\nbeen able to find a means of conveyance; but women are so naturally\r\ngenerous that I am ashamed not to confide in you. Nevertheless," he\r\nadded, "before putting ourselves in your hands, I ought to know whether\r\nwe shall get out of them safe and sound. In short, mademoiselle, are\r\nyou the sovereign or the slave of your Republican escort? Pardon my\r\nfrankness, but your position does not seem to me exactly natural--"\r\n\r\n"We live in times, monsieur, when nothing takes place naturally. You can\r\naccept my proposal without anxiety. Above all," she added, emphasizing\r\nher words, "you need fear no treachery in an offer made by a woman who\r\nhas no part in political hatreds."\r\n\r\n"A journey thus made is not without danger," he said, with a look which\r\ngave significance to that commonplace remark.\r\n\r\n"What is it you fear?" she answered, smiling sarcastically. "I see no\r\nperil for any one."\r\n\r\n"Is this the woman who a moment ago shared my desires in her eyes?"\r\nthought the young man. "What a tone in her voice! she is laying a trap\r\nfor me."\r\n\r\nAt that instant a shrill cry of an owl which appeared to have perched on\r\nthe chimney top vibrated in the air like a warning.\r\n\r\n"What does that mean?" said Mademoiselle de Verneuil. "Our journey\r\ntogether will not begin under favorable auspices. Do owls in these woods\r\nscreech by daylight?" she added, with a surprised gesture.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," said the young man, coolly. "Mademoiselle," he continued,\r\n"we may bring you ill-luck; you are thinking of that, I am sure. We had\r\nbetter not travel together."\r\n\r\nThese words were said with a calmness and reserve which puzzled\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," she replied, with truly aristocratic insolence, "I am far\r\nfrom wishing to compel you. Pray let us keep the little liberty the\r\nRepublic leaves us. If Madame were alone, I should insist--"\r\n\r\nThe heavy step of a soldier was heard in the passage, and the Commandant\r\nHulot presently appeared in the doorway with a frowning brow.\r\n\r\n"Come here, colonel," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, smiling and\r\npointing to a chair beside her. "Let us talk over the affairs of State.\r\nBut what is the matter with you? Are there Chouans here?"\r\n\r\nThe commandant stood speechless on catching sight of the young man, at\r\nwhom he looked with peculiar attention.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, will you take some more hare? Mademoiselle, you are not eating,"\r\nsaid the sailor to Francine, seeming busy with the guests.\r\n\r\nBut Hulot\'s astonishment and Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s close\r\nobservation had something too dangerously serious about them to be\r\nignored.\r\n\r\n"What is it, citizen?" said the young man, abruptly; "do you know me?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I do," replied the Republican.\r\n\r\n"You are right; I remember you at the School."\r\n\r\n"I never went to any school," said the soldier, roughly. "What school do\r\nyou mean?"\r\n\r\n"The Polytechnique."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, those barracks where they expect to make soldiers in\r\ndormitories," said the veteran, whose aversion for officers trained in\r\nthat nursery was insurmountable. "To what arm do you belong?"\r\n\r\n"I am in the navy."\r\n\r\n"Ha!" cried Hulot, smiling vindictively, "how many of your\r\nfellow-students are in the navy? Don\'t you know," he added in a serious\r\ntone, "that none but the artillery and the engineers graduate from\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\nThe young man was not disconcerted.\r\n\r\n"An exception was made in my favor, on account of the name I bear," he\r\nanswered. "We are all naval men in our family."\r\n\r\n"What is the name of your family, citizen?" asked Hulot.\r\n\r\n"Du Gua Saint-Cyr."\r\n\r\n"Then you were not killed at Mortagne?"\r\n\r\n"He came very near being killed," said Madame du Gua, quickly; "my son\r\nreceived two balls in--"\r\n\r\n"Where are your papers?" asked Hulot, not listening to the mother.\r\n\r\n"Do you propose to read them?" said the young man, cavalierly; his blue\r\neye, keen with suspicion, studied alternately the gloomy face of the\r\ncommandant and that of Mademoiselle de Verneuil.\r\n\r\n"A stripling like you to pretend to fool me! Come, produce your papers,\r\nor--"\r\n\r\n"La! la! citizen, I\'m not such a babe as I look to be. Why should I\r\nanswer you? Who are you?"\r\n\r\n"The commander of this department," answered Hulot.\r\n\r\n"Oh, then, of course, the matter is serious; I am taken with arms in my\r\nhand," and he held a glass full of Bordeaux to the soldier.\r\n\r\n"I am not thirsty," said Hulot. "Come, your papers."\r\n\r\nAt that instant the rattle of arms and the tread of men was heard in the\r\nstreet. Hulot walked to the window and gave a satisfied look which made\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil tremble. That sign of interest on her part\r\nseemed to fire the young man, whose face had grown cold and haughty.\r\nAfter feeling in the pockets of his coat he drew forth an elegant\r\nportfolio and presented certain papers to the commandant, which the\r\nlatter read slowly, comparing the description given in the passport with\r\nthe face and figure of the young man before him. During this prolonged\r\nexamination the owl\'s cry rose again; but this time there was no\r\ndifficulty whatever in recognizing a human voice. The commandant at once\r\nreturned the papers to the young man, with a scoffing look.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very fine," he said; "but I don\'t like the music. You will\r\ncome with me to headquarters."\r\n\r\n"Why do you take him there?" asked Mademoiselle de Verneuil, in a tone\r\nof some excitement.\r\n\r\n"My good lady," replied the commandant, with his usual grimace, "that\'s\r\nnone of your business."\r\n\r\nIrritated by the tone and words of the old soldier, but still more at\r\nthe sort of humiliation offered to her in presence of a man who was\r\nunder the influence of her charms, Mademoiselle de Verneuil rose,\r\nabandoning the simple and modest manner she had hitherto adopted; her\r\ncheeks glowed and her eyes shone as she said in a quiet tone but with a\r\ntrembling voice: "Tell me, has this young man met all the requirements\r\nof the law?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--apparently," said Hulot ironically.\r\n\r\n"Then, I desire that you will leave him, _apparently_, alone," she said.\r\n"Are you afraid he will escape you? You are to escort him with me to\r\nMayenne; he will be in the coach with his mother. Make no objection; it\r\nis my will--Well, what?" she added, noticing Hulot\'s grimace; "do you\r\nsuspect him still?"\r\n\r\n"Rather."\r\n\r\n"What do you want to do with him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing; balance his head with a little lead perhaps. He\'s a\r\ngiddy-pate!" said the commandant, ironically.\r\n\r\n"Are you joking, colonel?" cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil.\r\n\r\n"Come!" said the commandant, nodding to the young man, "make haste, let\r\nus be off."\r\n\r\nAt this impertinence Mademoiselle de Verneuil became calm and smiling.\r\n\r\n"Do not go," she said to the young man, protecting him with a gesture\r\nthat was full of dignity.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a beautiful head!" said the youth to his mother, who frowned\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\nAnnoyance, and many other sentiments, aroused and struggled with, did\r\ncertainly bring fresh beauties to the young woman\'s face. Francine,\r\nMadame du Gua, and her son had all risen from their seats. Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil hastily advanced and stood between them and the commandant,\r\nwho smiled amusedly; then she rapidly unfastened the frogged fastenings\r\nof her jacket. Acting with that blindness which often seizes women when\r\ntheir self-love is threatened and they are anxious to show their power,\r\nas a child is impatient to play with a toy that has just been given to\r\nit, she took from her bosom a paper and presented it to Hulot.\r\n\r\n"Read that," she said, with a sarcastic laugh.\r\n\r\nThen she turned to the young man and gave him, in the excitement of\r\nher triumph, a look in which mischief was mingled with an expression\r\nof love. Their brows cleared, joy flushed each agitated face, and a\r\nthousand contradictory thoughts rose in their hearts. Madame du Gua\r\nnoted in that one look far more of love than of pity in Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil\'s intervention; and she was right. The handsome creature\r\nblushed beneath the other woman\'s gaze, understanding its meaning, and\r\ndropped her eyelids; then, as if aware of some threatening accusation,\r\nshe raised her head proudly and defied all eyes. The commandant,\r\npetrified, returned the paper, countersigned by ministers, which\r\nenjoined all authorities to obey the orders of this mysterious lady.\r\nHaving done so, he drew his sword, laid it across his knees, broke the\r\nblade, and flung away the pieces.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle, you probably know what you are about; but a Republican\r\nhas his own ideas, and his own dignity. I cannot serve where women\r\ncommand. The First Consul will receive my resignation to-morrow; others,\r\nwho are not of my stripe, may obey you. I do not understand my orders\r\nand therefore I stop short,--all the more because I am supposed to\r\nunderstand them."\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment, but it was soon broken by the young\r\nlady, who went up to the commandant and held out her hand, saying,\r\n"Colonel, though your beard is somewhat long, you may kiss my hand; you\r\nare, indeed, a man!"\r\n\r\n"I flatter myself I am, mademoiselle," he replied, depositing a kiss\r\nupon the hand of this singular young woman rather awkwardly. "As for\r\nyou, friend," he said, threatening the young man with his finger, "you\r\nhave had a narrow escape this time."\r\n\r\n"Commandant," said the youth, "it is time all this nonsense should\r\ncease; I am ready to go with you, if you like, to headquarters."\r\n\r\n"And bring your invisible owl, Marche-a-Terre?"\r\n\r\n"Who is Marche-a-Terre?" asked the young man, showing all the signs of\r\ngenuine surprise.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t he hoot just now?"\r\n\r\n"What did that hooting have to do with me, I should like to know? I\r\nsupposed it was your soldiers letting you know of their arrival."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, you did not think that."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did. But do drink that glass of Bordeaux; the wine is good."\r\n\r\nSurprised at the natural behaviour of the youth and also by the\r\nfrivolity of his manners and the youthfulness of his face, made even\r\nmore juvenile by the careful curling of his fair hair, the commandant\r\nhesitated in the midst of his suspicions. He noticed that Madame du Gua\r\nwas intently watching the glances that her son gave to Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil, and he asked her abruptly: "How old are you, _citoyenne_?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Monsieur l\'officier," she said, "the rules of the Republic are very\r\nsevere; must I tell you that I am thirty-eight?"\r\n\r\n"May I be shot if I believe it! Marche-a-Terre is here; it was he who\r\ngave that cry; you are Chouans in disguise. God\'s thunder! I\'ll search\r\nthe inn and make sure of it!"\r\n\r\nJust then a hoot, somewhat like those that preceded it, came from the\r\ncourtyard; the commandant rushed out, and missed seeing the pallor that\r\ncovered Madame du Gua\'s face as he spoke. Hulot saw at once that the\r\nsound came from a postilion harnessing his horses to the coach, and\r\nhe cast aside his suspicions, all the more because it seemed absurd to\r\nsuppose that the Chouans would risk themselves in Alencon. He returned\r\nto the house confounded.\r\n\r\n"I forgive him now, but later he shall pay dear for the anxiety he\r\nhas given us," said the mother to the son, in a low voice, as Hulot\r\nre-entered the room.\r\n\r\nThe brave old officer showed on his worried face the struggle that went\r\non in his mind betwixt a stern sense of duty and the natural kindness of\r\nhis heart. He kept his gruff air, partly, perhaps, because he fancied\r\nhe had deceived himself, but he took the glass of Bordeaux, and said:\r\n"Excuse me, comrade, but your Polytechnique does send such young\r\nofficers--"\r\n\r\n"The Chouans have younger ones," said the youth, laughing.\r\n\r\n"For whom did you take my son?" asked Madame du Gua.\r\n\r\n"For the Gars, the leader sent to the Chouans and the Vendeans by the\r\nBritish cabinet; his real name is Marquis de Montauran."\r\n\r\nThe commandant watched the faces of the suspected pair, who looked at\r\neach other with a puzzled expression that seemed to say: "Do you know\r\nthat name?" "No, do you?" "What is he talking about?" "He\'s dreaming."\r\n\r\nThe sudden change in the manner of Marie de Verneuil, and her torpor as\r\nshe heard the name of the royalist general was observed by no one but\r\nFrancine, the only person to whom the least shade on that young face\r\nwas visible. Completely routed, the commandant picked up the bits of his\r\nbroken sword, looked at Mademoiselle de Verneuil, whose ardent beauty\r\nwas beginning to find its way to his heart, and said: "As for you,\r\nmademoiselle, I take nothing back, and to-morrow these fragments of my\r\nsword will reach Bonaparte, unless--"\r\n\r\n"Pooh! what do I care for Bonaparte, or your republic, or the king,\r\nor the Gars?" she cried, scarcely repressing an explosion of ill-bred\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nA mysterious emotion, the passion of which gave to her face a dazzling\r\ncolor, showed that the whole world was nothing to the girl the moment\r\nthat one individual was all in all to her. But she suddenly subdued\r\nherself into forced calmness, observing, like a trained actor, that the\r\nspectators were watching her. The commandant rose hastily and went out.\r\nAnxious and agitated, Mademoiselle de Verneuil followed him, stopped him\r\nin the corridor, and said, in an almost solemn tone: "Have you any good\r\nreason to suspect that young man of being the Gars?"\r\n\r\n"God\'s thunder! mademoiselle, that fellow who rode here with you came\r\nback to warn me that the travellers in the mail-coach had all been\r\nmurdered by the Chouans; I knew that, but what I didn\'t know was the\r\nname of the murdered persons,--it was Gua de Saint-Cyr!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! if Corentin is at the bottom of all this, nothing surprises me,"\r\nshe cried, with a gesture of disgust.\r\n\r\nThe commandant went his way without daring to look at Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil, whose dangerous beauty began to affect him.\r\n\r\n"If I had stayed two minutes longer I should have committed the folly of\r\ntaking back my sword and escorting her," he was saying to himself as he\r\nwent down the stairs.\r\n\r\nAs Madame du Gua watched the young man, whose eyes were fixed on the\r\ndoor through which Mademoiselle de Verneuil had passed, she said to him\r\nin a low voice: "You are incorrigible. You will perish through a\r\nwoman. A doll can make you forget everything. Why did you allow her\r\nto breakfast with us? Who is a Demoiselle de Verneuil escorted by the\r\nBlues, who accepts a breakfast from strangers and disarms an\r\nofficer with a piece of paper hidden in the bosom of her gown like a\r\nlove-letter? She is one of those contemptible creatures by whose\r\naid Fouche expects to lay hold of you, and the paper she showed the\r\ncommandant ordered the Blues to assist her against you."\r\n\r\n"Eh! madame," he replied in a sharp tone which went to the lady\'s heart\r\nand turned her pale; "her generous action disproves your supposition.\r\nPray remember that the welfare of the king is the sole bond between us.\r\nYou, who have had Charette at your feet must find the world without him\r\nempty; are you not living to avenge him?"\r\n\r\nThe lady stood still and pensive, like one who sees from the shore the\r\nwreck of all her treasures, and only the more eagerly longs for the\r\nvanished property.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil re-entered the room; the young man exchanged\r\na smile with her and gave her a glance full of gentle meaning. However\r\nuncertain the future might seem, however ephemeral their union, the\r\npromises of their sudden love were only the more endearing to them.\r\nRapid as the glance was, it did not escape the sagacious eye of Madame\r\ndu Gua, who instantly understood it; her brow clouded, and she was\r\nunable to wholly conceal her jealous anger. Francine was observing her;\r\nshe saw the eyes glitter, the cheeks flush; she thought she perceived\r\na diabolical spirit in the face, stirred by some sudden and terrible\r\nrevulsion. But lightning is not more rapid, nor death more prompt than\r\nthis brief exhibition of inward emotion. Madame du Gua recovered her\r\nlively manner with such immediate self-possession that Francine fancied\r\nherself mistaken. Nevertheless, having once perceived in this woman\r\na violence of feeling that was fully equal to that of Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil, she trembled as she foresaw the clash with which such natures\r\nmight come together, and the girl shuddered when she saw Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil go up to the young man with a passionate look and, taking\r\nhim by the hand, draw him close beside her and into the light, with a\r\ncoquettish glance that was full of witchery.\r\n\r\n"Now," she said, trying to read his eyes, "own to me that you are not\r\nthe citizen du Gua Saint-Cyr."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\n"But he and his mother were killed yesterday."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry for that," he replied, laughing. "However that may be,\r\nI am none the less under a great obligation to you, for which I shall\r\nalways feel the deepest gratitude and only wish I could prove it to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I thought I was saving an _emigre_, but I love you better as a\r\nRepublican."\r\n\r\nThe words escaped her lips as it were impulsively; she became confused;\r\neven her eyes blushed, and her face bore no other expression than one\r\nof exquisite simplicity of feeling; she softly released the young man\'s\r\nhand, not from shame at having pressed it, but because of a thought too\r\nweighty, it seemed, for her heart to bear, leaving him drunk with hope.\r\nSuddenly she appeared to regret this freedom, permissible as it might\r\nbe under the passing circumstances of a journey. She recovered her\r\nconventional manner, bowed to the lady and her son, and taking Francine\r\nwith her, left the room. When they reached their own chamber Francine\r\nwrung her hands and tossed her arms, as she looked at her mistress,\r\nsaying: "Ah, Marie, what a crowd of things in a moment of time! who but\r\nyou would have such adventures?"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil sprang forward and clasped Francine round the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n"Ah! this is life indeed--I am in heaven!"\r\n\r\n"Or hell," retorted Francine.\r\n\r\n"Yes, hell if you like!" cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil. "Here, give me\r\nyour hand; feel my heart, how it beats. There\'s fever in my veins; the\r\nwhole world is now a mere nothing to me! How many times have I not\r\nseen that man in my dreams! Oh! how beautiful his head is--how his eyes\r\nsparkle!"\r\n\r\n"Will he love you?" said the simple peasant-woman, in a quivering voice,\r\nher face full of sad foreboding.\r\n\r\n"How can you ask me that!" cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil. "But,\r\nFrancine, tell me," she added throwing herself into a pose that was half\r\nserious, half comic, "will it be very hard to love me?"\r\n\r\n"No, but will he love you always?" replied Francine, smiling.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other for a moment speechless,--Francine at\r\nrevealing so much knowledge of life, and Marie at the perception, which\r\nnow came to her for the first time, of a future of happiness in her\r\npassion. She seemed to herself hanging over a gulf of which she had\r\nwanted to know the depth, and listening to the fall of the stone she had\r\nflung, at first heedlessly, into it.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is my own affair," she said, with the gesture of a gambler. "I\r\nshould never pity a betrayed woman; she has no one but herself to blame\r\nif she is abandoned. I shall know how to keep, either living or dead,\r\nthe man whose heart has once been mine. But," she added, with some\r\nsurprise and after a moment\'s silence, "where did you get your knowledge\r\nof love, Francine?"\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," said the peasant-woman, hastily, "hush, I hear steps in\r\nthe passage."\r\n\r\n"Ah! not _his_ steps!" said Marie, listening. "But you are evading an\r\nanswer; well, well, I\'ll wait for it, or guess it."\r\n\r\nFrancine was right, however. Three taps on the door interrupted the\r\nconversation. Captain Merle appeared, after receiving Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil\'s permission to enter.\r\n\r\nWith a military salute to the lady, whose beauty dazzled him, the\r\nsoldier ventured on giving her a glance, but he found nothing better to\r\nsay than: "Mademoiselle, I am at your orders."\r\n\r\n"Then you are to be my protector, in place of the commander, who\r\nretires; is that so?"\r\n\r\n"No, my superior is the adjutant-major Gerard, who has sent me here."\r\n\r\n"Your commandant must be very much afraid of me," she said.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, mademoiselle, Hulot is afraid of nothing. But women,\r\nyou see, are not in his line; it ruffled him to have a general in a\r\nmob-cap."\r\n\r\n"And yet," continued Mademoiselle de Verneuil, "it was his duty to obey\r\nhis superiors. I like subordination, and I warn you that I shall allow\r\nno one to disobey me."\r\n\r\n"That would be difficult," replied Merle, gallantly.\r\n\r\n"Let us consult," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil. "You can get fresh\r\ntroops here and accompany me to Mayenne, which I must reach this\r\nevening. Shall we find other soldiers there, so that I might go on at\r\nonce, without stopping at Mayenne? The Chouans are quite ignorant of\r\nour little expedition. If we travel at night, we can avoid meeting any\r\nnumber of them, and so escape an attack. Do you think this feasible?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\n"What sort of road is it between Mayenne and Fougeres?"\r\n\r\n"Rough; all up and down, a regular squirrel-wheel."\r\n\r\n"Well, let us start at once. As we have nothing to fear near Alencon,\r\nyou can go before me; we\'ll join you soon."\r\n\r\n"One would think she had seen ten years\' service," thought Merle, as he\r\ndeparted. "Hulot is mistaken; that young girl is not earning her\r\nliving out of a feather-bed. Ten thousand carriages! if I want to be\r\nadjutant-major I mustn\'t be such a fool as to mistake Saint-Michael for\r\nthe devil."\r\n\r\nDuring Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s conference with the captain, Francine\r\nhad slipped out for the purpose of examining, through a window of the\r\ncorridor, the spot in the courtyard which had excited her curiosity on\r\narriving at the inn. She watched the stable and the heaps of straw with\r\nthe absorption of one who was saying her prayers to the Virgin, and\r\nshe presently saw Madame du Gua approaching Marche-a-Terre with the\r\nprecaution of a cat that dislikes to wet its feet. When the Chouan\r\ncaught sight of the lady, he rose and stood before her in an attitude of\r\ndeep respect. This singular circumstance aroused Francine\'s curiosity;\r\nshe slipped into the courtyard and along the walls, avoiding Madame du\r\nGua\'s notice, and trying to hide herself behind the stable door. She\r\nwalked on tiptoe, scarcely daring to breathe, and succeeded in posting\r\nherself close to Marche-a-Terre, without exciting his attention.\r\n\r\n"If, after all this information," the lady was saying to the Chouan, "it\r\nproves not to be her real name, you are to fire upon her without pity,\r\nas you would on a mad dog."\r\n\r\n"Agreed!" said Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\nThe lady left him. The Chouan replaced his red woollen cap upon his\r\nhead, remained standing, and was scratching his ear as if puzzled when\r\nFrancine suddenly appeared before him, apparently by magic.\r\n\r\n"Saint Anne of Auray!" he exclaimed. Then he dropped his whip, clasped\r\nhis hands, and stood as if in ecstasy. A faint color illuminated his\r\ncoarse face, and his eyes shone like diamonds dropped on a muck-heap.\r\n"Is it really the brave girl from Cottin?" he muttered, in a voice so\r\nsmothered that he alone heard it. "You _are_ fine," he said, after a\r\npause, using the curious word, "godaine," a superlative in the dialect\r\nof those regions used by lovers to express the combination of fine\r\nclothes and beauty.\r\n\r\n"I daren\'t touch you," added Marche-a-Terre, putting out his big hand\r\nnevertheless, as if to weigh the gold chain which hung round her neck\r\nand below her waist.\r\n\r\n"You had better not, Pierre," replied Francine, inspired by the\r\ninstinct which makes a woman despotic when not oppressed. She drew back\r\nhaughtily, after enjoying the Chouan\'s surprise; but she compensated for\r\nthe harshness of her words by the softness of her glance, saying, as she\r\nonce more approached him: "Pierre, that lady was talking to you about my\r\nyoung mistress, wasn\'t she?"\r\n\r\nMarche-a-Terre was silent; his face struggled, like the dawn, between\r\nclouds and light. He looked in turn at Francine, at the whip he\r\nhad dropped, and at the chain, which seemed to have as powerful an\r\nattraction for him as the Breton girl herself. Then, as if to put a stop\r\nto his own uneasiness, he picked up his whip and still kept silence.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is easy to see that that lady told you to kill my mistress,"\r\nresumed Francine, who knew the faithful discretion of the peasant, and\r\nwished to relieve his scruples.\r\n\r\nMarche-a-Terre lowered his head significantly. To the Cottin girl that\r\nwas answer enough.\r\n\r\n"Very good, Pierre," she said; "if any evil happens to her, if a hair\r\nof her head is injured, you and I will have seen each other for the last\r\ntime; for I shall be in heaven, and you will go to hell."\r\n\r\nThe possessed of devils whom the Church in former days used to exorcise\r\nwith great pomp were not more shaken and agitated than Marche-a-Terre\r\nat this prophecy, uttered with a conviction that gave it certainty.\r\nHis glance, which at first had a character of savage tenderness,\r\ncounteracted by a fanaticism as powerful in his soul as love, suddenly\r\nbecame surly, as he felt the imperious manner of the girl he had long\r\nsince chosen. Francine interpreted his silence in her own way.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you do anything for my sake?" she said in a tone of reproach.\r\n\r\nAt these words the Chouan cast a glance at his mistress from eyes that\r\nwere black as a crow\'s wing.\r\n\r\n"Are you free?" he asked in a growl that Francine alone could have\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n"Should I be here if I were not?" she replied indignantly. "But you,\r\nwhat are you doing here? Still playing bandit, still roaming the country\r\nlike a mad dog wanting to bite. Oh! Pierre, if you were wise, you would\r\ncome with me. This beautiful young lady, who, I ought to tell you, was\r\nnursed when a baby in our home, has taken care of me. I have two hundred\r\nfrancs a year from a good investment. And Mademoiselle has bought me my\r\nuncle Thomas\'s big house for fifteen hundred francs, and I have saved\r\ntwo thousand beside."\r\n\r\nBut her smiles and the announcement of her wealth fell dead before the\r\ndogged immovability of the Chouan.\r\n\r\n"The priests have told us to go to war," he replied. "Every Blue we\r\nshoot earns one indulgence."\r\n\r\n"But suppose the Blues shoot you?"\r\n\r\nHe answered by letting his arms drop at his sides, as if regretting the\r\npoverty of the offering he should thus make to God and the king.\r\n\r\n"What will become of me?" exclaimed the young girl, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\nMarche-a-Terre looked at her stupidly; his eyes seemed to enlarge; tears\r\nrolled down his hairy cheeks upon the goatskin which covered him, and a\r\nlow moan came from his breast.\r\n\r\n"Saint Anne of Auray!--Pierre, is this all you have to say to me after a\r\nparting of seven years? You have changed indeed."\r\n\r\n"I love you the same as ever," said the Chouan, in a gruff voice.\r\n\r\n"No," she whispered, "the king is first."\r\n\r\n"If you look at me like that I shall go," he said.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, adieu," she replied, sadly.\r\n\r\n"Adieu," he repeated.\r\n\r\nHe seized her hand, wrung it, kissed it, made the sign of the cross, and\r\nrushed into the stable, like a dog who fears that his bone will be taken\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n"Pille-Miche," he said to his comrade. "Where\'s your tobacco-box?"\r\n\r\n"Ho! _sacre bleu_! what a fine chain!" cried Pille-Miche, fumbling in a\r\npocket constructed in his goatskin.\r\n\r\nThen he held out to Marche-a-Terre the little horn in which Bretons put\r\nthe finely powdered tobacco which they prepare themselves during the\r\nlong winter nights. The Chouan raised his thumb and made a hollow in\r\nthe palm of his hand, after the manner in which an "Invalide" takes his\r\ntobacco; then he shook the horn, the small end of which Pille-Miche had\r\nunscrewed. A fine powder fell slowly from the little hole pierced in\r\nthe point of this Breton utensil. Marche-a-Terre went through the same\r\nprocess seven or eight times silently, as if the powder had power\r\nto change the current of his thoughts. Suddenly he flung the horn to\r\nPille-Miche with a gesture of despair, and caught up a gun which was\r\nhidden in the straw.\r\n\r\n"Seven or eight shakes at once! I suppose you think that costs nothing!"\r\nsaid the stingy Pille-Miche.\r\n\r\n"Forward!" cried Marche-a-Terre in a hoarse voice. "There\'s work before\r\nus."\r\n\r\nThirty or more Chouans who were sleeping in the straw under the mangers,\r\nraised their heads, saw Marche-a-Terre on his feet, and disappeared\r\ninstantly through a door which led to the garden, from which it was easy\r\nto reach the fields.\r\n\r\nWhen Francine left the stable she found the mail-coach ready to start.\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil and her new fellow-travellers were already in\r\nit. The girl shuddered as she saw her young mistress sitting side by\r\nside with the woman who had just ordered her death. The young man had\r\ntaken his seat facing Marie, and as soon as Francine was in hers the\r\nheavy vehicle started at a good pace.\r\n\r\nThe sun had swept away the gray autumnal mists, and its rays were\r\nbrightening the gloomy landscape with a look of youth and holiday. Many\r\nlovers fancy that such chance accidents of the sky are premonitions.\r\nFrancine was surprised at the strange silence which fell upon the\r\ntravellers. Mademoiselle de Verneuil had recovered her cold manner, and\r\nsat with her eyes lowered, her head slightly inclined, and her hands\r\nhidden under a sort of mantle in which she had wrapped herself. If she\r\nraised her eyes it was only to look at the passing scenery. Certain of\r\nbeing admired, she rejected admiration; but her apparent indifference\r\nwas evidently more coquettish than natural. Purity, which gives such\r\nharmony to the diverse expressions by which a simple soul reveals\r\nitself, could lend no charm to a being whose every instinct predestined\r\nher to the storms of passion. Yielding himself up to the pleasures\r\nof this dawning intrigue, the young man did not try to explain\r\nthe contradictions which were obvious between the coquetry and the\r\nenthusiasm of this singular young girl. Her assumed indifference allowed\r\nhim to examine at his ease a face which was now as beautiful in its\r\ncalmness as it had been when agitated. Like the rest of us, he was not\r\ndisposed to question the sources of his enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for a pretty woman to avoid the glances of her\r\ncompanions in a carriage when their eyes fasten upon her as a visible\r\ndistraction to the monotony of a journey. Happy, therefore, in being\r\nable to satisfy the hunger of his dawning passion, without offence or\r\navoidance on the part of its object, the young man studied the pure and\r\nbrilliant lines of the girl\'s head and face. To him they were a picture.\r\nSometimes the light brought out the transparent rose of the nostrils\r\nand the double curve which united the nose with the upper lip; at other\r\ntimes a pale glint of sunshine illuminated the tints of the skin,\r\npearly beneath the eyes and round the mouth, rosy on the cheeks, and\r\nivory-white about the temples and throat. He admired the contrasts of\r\nlight and shade caused by the masses of black hair surrounding her face\r\nand giving it an ephemeral grace,--for all is fleeting in a woman;\r\nher beauty of to-day is often not that of yesterday, fortunately for\r\nherself, perhaps! The young man, who was still at an age when youth\r\ndelights in the nothings which are the all of love, watched eagerly for\r\neach movement of the eyelids, and the seductive rise and fall of her\r\nbosom as she breathed. Sometimes he fancied, suiting the tenor of his\r\nthoughts, that he could see a meaning in the expression of the eyes and\r\nthe imperceptible inflection of the lips. Every gesture betrayed to\r\nhim the soul, every motion a new aspect of the young girl. If a thought\r\nstirred those mobile features, if a sudden blush suffused the cheeks, or\r\na smile brought life into the face, he found a fresh delight in trying\r\nto discover the secrets of this mysterious creature. Everything about\r\nher was a snare to the soul and a snare to the senses. Even the\r\nsilence that fell between them, far from raising an obstacle to the\r\nunderstanding of their hearts, became the common ground for mutual\r\nthoughts. But after a while the many looks in which their eyes\r\nencountered each other warned Marie de Verneuil that the silence was\r\ncompromising her, and she turned to Madame du Gua with one of those\r\ncommonplace remarks which open the way to conversation; but even in so\r\ndoing she included the young man.\r\n\r\n"Madame," she said, "how could you put your son into the navy? have you\r\nnot doomed yourself to perpetual anxiety?"\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle, the fate of women, of mothers, I should say, is to\r\ntremble for the safety of their dear ones."\r\n\r\n"Your son is very like you."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so, mademoiselle?"\r\n\r\nThe smile with which the young man listened to these remarks increased\r\nthe vexation of his pretended mother. Her hatred grew with every\r\npassionate glance he turned on Marie. Silence or conversation, all\r\nincreased the dreadful wrath which she carefully concealed beneath a\r\ncordial manner.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," said the young man, "you are quite mistaken. Naval men\r\nare not more exposed to danger than soldiers. Women ought not to dislike\r\nthe navy; we sailors have a merit beyond that of the military,--we are\r\nfaithful to our mistresses."\r\n\r\n"Oh, from necessity," replied Mademoiselle de Verneuil, laughing.\r\n\r\n"But even so, it is fidelity," said Madame du Gua, in a deep voice.\r\n\r\nThe conversation grew lively, touching upon subjects that were\r\ninteresting to none but the three travellers, for under such\r\ncircumstances intelligent persons given new meanings to commonplace\r\ntalk; but every word, insignificant as it might seem, was a mutual\r\ninterrogation, hiding the desires, hopes, and passions which agitated\r\nthem. Marie\'s cleverness and quick perception (for she was fully on her\r\nguard) showed Madame du Gua that calumny and treachery could alone avail\r\nto triumph over a rival as formidable through her intellect as by her\r\nbeauty. The mail-coach presently overtook the escort, and then advanced\r\nmore slowly. The young man, seeing a long hill before them, proposed\r\nto the young lady that they should walk. The friendly politeness of his\r\noffer decided her, and her consent flattered him.\r\n\r\n"Is Madame of our opinion?" she said, turning to Madame du Gua. "Will\r\nshe walk, too?"\r\n\r\n"Coquette!" said the lady to herself, as she left the coach.\r\n\r\nMarie and the young man walked together, but a little apart. The sailor,\r\nfull of ardent desires, was determined to break the reserve that checked\r\nhim, of which, however, he was not the dupe. He fancied that he could\r\nsucceed by dallying with the young lady in that tone of courteous\r\namiability and wit, sometimes frivolous, sometimes serious, which\r\ncharacterized the men of the exiled aristocracy. But the smiling\r\nParisian beauty parried him so mischievously, and rejected his\r\nfrivolities with such disdain, evidently preferring the stronger ideas\r\nand enthusiasms which he betrayed from time to time in spite of himself,\r\nthat he presently began to understand the true way of pleasing her. The\r\nconversation then changed. He realized the hopes her expressive face had\r\ngiven him; yet, as he did so, new difficulties arose, and he was still\r\nforced to suspend his judgment on a girl who seemed to take delight in\r\nthwarting him, a siren with whom he grew more and more in love. After\r\nyielding to the seduction of her beauty, he was still more attracted\r\nto her mysterious soul, with a curiosity which Marie perceived and took\r\npleasure in exciting. Their intercourse assumed, insensibly, a character\r\nof intimacy far removed from the tone of indifference which Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil endeavored in vain to give to it.\r\n\r\nThough Madame du Gua had followed the lovers, the latter had\r\nunconsciously walked so much more rapidly than she that a distance of\r\nseveral hundred feet soon separated them. The charming pair trod the\r\nfine sand beneath their feet, listening with childlike delight to the\r\nunion of their footsteps, happy in being wrapped by the same ray of\r\na sunshine that seemed spring-like, in breathing with the same breath\r\nautumnal perfumes laden with vegetable odors which seemed a nourishment\r\nbrought by the breezes to their dawning love. Though to them it may have\r\nbeen a mere circumstance of their fortuitous meeting, yet the sky, the\r\nlandscape, the season of the year, did communicate to their emotions a\r\ntinge of melancholy gravity which gave them an element of passion. They\r\npraised the weather and talked of its beauty; then of their strange\r\nencounter, of the coming rupture of an intercourse so delightful; of the\r\nease with which, in travelling, friendships, lost as soon as made, are\r\nformed. After this last remark, the young man profited by what seemed to\r\nbe a tacit permission to make a few tender confidences, and to risk an\r\navowal of love like a man who was not unaccustomed to such situations.\r\n\r\n"Have you noticed, mademoiselle," he said, "how little the feelings of\r\nthe heart follow the old conventional rules in the days of terror in\r\nwhich we live? Everything about us bears the stamp of suddenness. We\r\nlove in a day, or we hate on the strength of a single glance. We are\r\nbound to each other for life in a moment, or we part with the celerity\r\nof death itself. All things are hurried, like the convulsions of the\r\nnation. In the midst of such dangers as ours the ties that bind should\r\nbe stronger than under the ordinary course of life. In Paris during the\r\nTerror, every one came to know the full meaning of a clasp of the hand\r\nas men do on a battle-field."\r\n\r\n"People felt the necessity of living fast and ardently," she answered,\r\n"for they had little time to live." Then, with a glance at her companion\r\nwhich seemed to tell him that the end of their short intercourse was\r\napproaching, she added, maliciously: "You are very well informed as\r\nto the affairs of life, for a young man who has just left the Ecole\r\nPolytechnique!"\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of me?" he said after a moment\'s silence. "Tell\r\nme frankly, without disguise."\r\n\r\n"You wish to acquire the right to speak to me of myself," she said\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"You do not answer me," he went on after a slight pause. "Take care,\r\nsilence is sometimes significant."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I cannot guess all that you would like to say to me? Good\r\nheavens! you have already said enough."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if we understand each other," he replied, smiling, "I have obtained\r\nmore than I dared hope for."\r\n\r\nShe smiled in return so graciously that she seemed to accept the\r\ncourteous struggle into which all men like to draw a woman. They\r\npersuaded themselves, half in jest, half in earnest, that they never\r\ncould be more to each other than they were at that moment. The young man\r\nfancied, therefore, he might give reins to a passion that could have\r\nno future; the young woman felt she might smile upon it. Marie suddenly\r\nstruck her foot against a stone and stumbled.\r\n\r\n"Take my arm," said her companion.\r\n\r\n"It seems I must," she replied; "you would be too proud if I refused;\r\nyou would fancy I feared you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, mademoiselle," he said, pressing her arm against his heart that she\r\nmight feel the beating of it, "you flatter my pride by granting such a\r\nfavor."\r\n\r\n"Well, the readiness with which I do so will cure your illusions."\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to save me from the danger of the emotions you cause?"\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop!" she cried; "do not try to entangle me in such boudoir\r\nriddles. I don\'t like to find the wit of fools in a man of your\r\ncharacter. See! here we are beneath the glorious sky, in the open\r\ncountry; before us, above us, all is grand. You wish to tell me that\r\nI am beautiful, do you not? Well, your eyes have already told me so;\r\nbesides, I know it; I am not a woman whom mere compliments can please.\r\nBut perhaps you would like," this with satirical emphasis, "to talk\r\nabout your _sentiments_? Do you think me so simple as to believe that\r\nsudden sympathies are powerful enough to influence a whole life through\r\nthe recollections of one morning?"\r\n\r\n"Not the recollections of a morning," he said, "but those of a beautiful\r\nwoman who has shown herself generous."\r\n\r\n"You forget," she retorted, laughing, "half my attractions,--a\r\nmysterious woman, with everything odd about her, name, rank, situation,\r\nfreedom of thought and manners."\r\n\r\n"You are not mysterious to me!" he exclaimed. "I have fathomed you;\r\nthere is nothing that could be added to your perfections except a little\r\nmore faith in the love you inspire."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my poor child of eighteen, what can you know of love?" she said\r\nsmiling. "Well, well, so be it!" she added, "it is a fair subject of\r\nconversation, like the weather when one pays a visit. You shall find\r\nthat I have neither false modesty nor petty fears. I can hear the word\r\nlove without blushing; it has been so often said to me without one\r\necho of the heart that I think it quite unmeaning. I have met with it\r\neverywhere, in books, at the theatre, in society,--yes, everywhere, and\r\nnever have I found in it even a semblance of its magnificent ideal."\r\n\r\n"Did you seek that ideal?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThe word was said with such perfect ease and freedom that the young man\r\nmade a gesture of surprise and looked at Marie fixedly, as if he had\r\nsuddenly changed his opinion on her character and real position.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," he said with ill-concealed devotion, "are you maid or\r\nwife, angel or devil?"\r\n\r\n"All," she replied, laughing. "Isn\'t there something diabolic and also\r\nangelic in a young girl who has never loved, does not love, and perhaps\r\nwill never love?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think yourself happy thus?" he asked with a free and easy tone\r\nand manner, as though already he felt less respect for her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, happy, no," she replied. "When I think that I am alone, hampered\r\nby social conventions that make me deceitful, I envy the privileges of\r\na man. But when I also reflect on the means which nature has bestowed\r\non us women to catch and entangle you men in the invisible meshes of a\r\npower which you cannot resist, then the part assigned to me in the world\r\nis not displeasing to me. And then again, suddenly, it does seem very\r\npetty, and I feel that I should despise a man who allowed himself to be\r\nduped by such vulgar seductions. No sooner do I perceive our power and\r\nlike it, than I know it to be horrible and I abhor it. Sometimes I feel\r\nwithin me that longing towards devotion which makes my sex so nobly\r\nbeautiful; and then I feel a desire, which consumes me, for dominion\r\nand power. Perhaps it is the natural struggle of the good and the evil\r\nprinciple in which all creatures live here below. Angel or devil!\r\nyou have expressed it. Ah! to-day is not the first time that I have\r\nrecognized my double nature. But we women understand better than you\r\nmen can do our own shortcomings. We have an instinct which shows us\r\na perfection in all things to which, nevertheless, we fail to attain.\r\nBut," she added, sighing as she glanced at the sky; "that which enhances\r\nus in your eyes is--"\r\n\r\n"Is what?" he said.\r\n\r\n"--that we are all struggling, more or less," she answered, "against a\r\nthwarted destiny."\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle, why should we part to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she replied, smiling at the passionate look which he gave her,\r\n"let us get into the carriage; the open air does not agree with us."\r\n\r\nMarie turned abruptly; the young man followed her, and pressed her\r\narm with little respect, but in a manner that expressed his imperious\r\nadmiration. She hastened her steps. Seeing that she wished to escape an\r\nimportune declaration, he became the more ardent; being determined to\r\nwin a first favor from this woman, he risked all and said, looking at\r\nher meaningly:--\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you a secret?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, quickly, if it concerns you."\r\n\r\n"I am not in the service of the Republic. Where are you going? I shall\r\nfollow you."\r\n\r\nAt the words Marie trembled violently. She withdrew her arm and covered\r\nher face with both hands to hide either the flush or the pallor of her\r\ncheeks; then she suddenly uncovered her face and said in a voice of deep\r\nemotion:--\r\n\r\n"Then you began as you would have ended, by deceiving me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said.\r\n\r\nAt this answer she turned again from the carriage, which was now\r\novertaking them, and began to almost run along the road.\r\n\r\n"I thought," he said, following her, "that the open air did not agree\r\nwith you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! it has changed," she replied in a grave tone, continuing to walk\r\non, a prey to agitating thoughts.\r\n\r\n"You do not answer me," said the young man, his heart full of the soft\r\nexpectation of coming pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she said, in a strained voice, "the tragedy begins."\r\n\r\n"What tragedy?" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe stopped short, looked at the young student from head to foot with\r\na mingled expression of fear and curiosity; then she concealed her\r\nfeelings that were agitating her under the mask of an impenetrable\r\ncalmness, showing that for a girl of her age she had great experience of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" she said,--"but I know already; when I first saw you I\r\nsuspected it. You are the royalist leader whom they call the Gars.\r\nThe ex-bishop of Autun was right in saying we should always believe in\r\npresentiments which give warning of evil."\r\n\r\n"What interest have you in knowing the Gars?"\r\n\r\n"What interest has he in concealing himself from me who have already\r\nsaved his life?" She began to laugh, but the merriment was forced. "I\r\nhave wisely prevented you from saying that you love me. Let me tell you,\r\nmonsieur, that I abhor you. I am republican, you are royalist; I would\r\ndeliver you up if you were not under my protection, and if I had not\r\nalready saved your life, and if--" she stopped. These violent extremes\r\nof feeling and the inward struggle which she no longer attempted to\r\nconceal alarmed the young man, who tried, but in vain, to observe her\r\ncalmly. "Let us part here at once,--I insist upon it; farewell!" she\r\nsaid. She turned hastily back, made a few steps, and then returned to\r\nhim. "No, no," she continued, "I have too great an interest in knowing\r\nwho you are. Hide nothing from me; tell me the truth. Who are you? for\r\nyou are no more a pupil of the Ecole Polytechnique than you are eighteen\r\nyears old."\r\n\r\n"I am a sailor, ready to leave the ocean and follow you wherever your\r\nimagination may lead you. If I have been so lucky as to rouse your\r\ncuriosity in any particular I shall be very careful not to lessen it.\r\nWhy mingle the serious affairs of real life with the life of the heart\r\nin which we are beginning to understand each other?"\r\n\r\n"Our souls might have understood each other," she said in a grave voice.\r\n"But I have no right to exact your confidence. You will never know the\r\nextent of your obligations to me; I shall not explain them."\r\n\r\nThey walked a few steps in silence.\r\n\r\n"My life does interest you," said the young man.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, I implore you, tell me your name or else be silent. You are\r\na child," she added, with an impatient movement of her shoulders, "and I\r\nfeel a pity for you."\r\n\r\nThe obstinacy with which she insisted on knowing his name made the\r\npretended sailor hesitate between prudence and love. The vexation of a\r\ndesired woman is powerfully attractive; her anger, like her submission,\r\nis imperious; many are the fibres she touches in a man\'s heart,\r\npenetrating and subjugating it. Was this scene only another aspect of\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil\'s coquetry? In spite of his sudden passion the\r\nunnamed lover had the strength to distrust a woman thus bent on forcing\r\nfrom him a secret of life and death.\r\n\r\n"Why has my rash indiscretion, which sought to give a future to our\r\npresent meeting, destroyed the happiness of it?" he said, taking her\r\nhand, which she left in his unconsciously.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, who seemed to be in real distress, was silent.\r\n\r\n"How have I displeased you?" he said. "What can I do to soothe you?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me your name."\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, and they walked some distance in silence. Suddenly\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil stopped short, like one who has come to some\r\nserious determination.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur le Marquis de Montauran," she said, with dignity, but without\r\nbeing able to conceal entirely the nervous trembling of her features, "I\r\ndesire to do you a great service, whatever it may cost me. We part here.\r\nThe coach and its escort are necessary for your protection, and you must\r\ncontinue your journey in it. Fear nothing from the Republicans; they are\r\nmen of honor, and I shall give the adjutant certain orders which he will\r\nfaithfully execute. As for me, I shall return on foot to Alencon with my\r\nmaid, and take a few of the soldiers with me. Listen to what I say, for\r\nyour life depends on it. If, before you reach a place of safety, you\r\nmeet that odious man you saw in my company at the inn, escape at once,\r\nfor he will instantly betray you. As for me,--" she paused, "as for me,\r\nI fling myself back into the miseries of life. Farewell, monsieur, may\r\nyou be happy; farewell."\r\n\r\nShe made a sign to Captain Merle, who was just then reaching the brow\r\nof the hill behind her. The marquis was taken unawares by her sudden\r\naction.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" he cried, in a tone of despair that was well acted.\r\n\r\nThis singular caprice of a girl for whom he would at that instant have\r\nthrown away his life so surprised him that he invented, on the spur of\r\nthe moment, a fatal fiction by which to hide his name and satisfy the\r\ncuriosity of his companion.\r\n\r\n"You have almost guessed the truth," he said. "I am an _emigre_,\r\ncondemned to death, and my name is Vicomte de Bauvan. Love of my country\r\nhas brought me back to France to join my brother. I hope to be taken off\r\nthe list of _emigres_ through the influence of Madame de Beauharnais,\r\nnow the wife of the First Consul; but if I fail in this, I mean to die\r\non the soil of my native land, fighting beside my friend Montauran. I am\r\nnow on my way secretly, by means of a passport he has sent me, to learn\r\nif any of my property in Brittany is still unconfiscated."\r\n\r\nWhile the young man spoke Mademoiselle de Verneuil examined him with\r\na penetrating eye. She tried at first to doubt his words, but being\r\nby nature confiding and trustful, she slowly regained an expression\r\nof serenity, and said eagerly, "Monsieur, are you telling me the exact\r\ntruth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the exact truth," replied the young man, who seemed to have no\r\nconscience in his dealings with women.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil gave a deep sigh, like a person who returns to\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she exclaimed, "I am very happy."\r\n\r\n"Then you hate that poor Montauran?"\r\n\r\n"No," she said; "but I could not make you understand my meaning. I was\r\nnot willing that _you_ should meet the dangers from which I will try to\r\nprotect him,--since he is your friend."\r\n\r\n"Who told you that Montauran was in danger?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, monsieur, even if I had not come from Paris, where his enterprise\r\nis the one thing talked of, the commandant at Alencon said enough to\r\nshow his danger."\r\n\r\n"Then let me ask you how you expect to save him from it."\r\n\r\n"Suppose I do not choose to answer," she replied, with the haughty air\r\nthat women often assume to hide an emotion. "What right have you to know\r\nmy secrets?"\r\n\r\n"The right of a man who loves you."\r\n\r\n"Already?" she said. "No, you do not love me. I am only an object of\r\npassing gallantry to you,--that is all. I am clear-sighted; did I not\r\npenetrate your disguise at once? A woman who knows anything of\r\ngood society could not be misled, in these days, by a pupil of the\r\nPolytechnique who uses choice language, and conceals as little as you do\r\nthe manners of a _grand seigneur_ under the mask of a Republican. There\r\nis a trifle of powder left in your hair, and a fragrance of nobility\r\nclings to you which a woman of the world cannot fail to detect.\r\nTherefore, fearing that the man whom you saw accompanying me, who has\r\nall the shrewdness of a woman, might make the same discovery, I sent him\r\naway. Monsieur, let me tell you that a true Republican officer just from\r\nthe Polytechnique would not have made love to me as you have done, and\r\nwould not have taken me for a pretty adventuress. Allow me, Monsieur de\r\nBauvan, to preach you a little sermon from a woman\'s point of view. Are\r\nyou too juvenile to know that of all the creatures of my sex the most\r\ndifficult to subdue is that same adventuress,--she whose price is\r\nticketed and who is weary of pleasure. That sort of woman requires, they\r\ntell me, constant seduction; she yields only to her own caprices; any\r\nattempt to please her argues, I should suppose, great conceit on the\r\npart of a man. But let us put aside that class of women, among whom you\r\nhave been good enough to rank me; you ought to understand that a young\r\nwoman, handsome, brilliant, and of noble birth (for, I suppose, you will\r\ngrant me those advantages), does not sell herself, and can only be won\r\nby the man who loves her in one way. You understand me? If she loves\r\nhim and is willing to commit a folly, she must be justified by great and\r\nheroic reasons. Forgive me this logic, rare in my sex; but for the sake\r\nof your happiness,--and my own," she added, dropping her head,--"I will\r\nnot allow either of us to deceive the other, nor will I permit you to\r\nthink that Mademoiselle de Verneuil, angel or devil, maid or wife, is\r\ncapable of being seduced by commonplace gallantry."\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," said the marquis, whose surprise, though he concealed\r\nit, was extreme, and who at once became a man of the great world, "I\r\nentreat you to believe that I take you to be a very noble person, full\r\nof the highest sentiments, or--a charming girl, as you please."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t ask all that," she said, laughing. "Allow me to keep my\r\nincognito. My mask is better than yours, and it pleases me to wear\r\nit,--if only to discover whether those who talk to me of love are\r\nsincere. Therefore, beware of me! Monsieur," she cried, catching his arm\r\nvehemently, "listen to me; if you were able to prove that your love is\r\ntrue, nothing, no human power, could part us. Yes, I would fain\r\nunite myself to the noble destiny of some great man, and marry a\r\nvast ambition, glorious hopes! Noble hearts are never faithless,\r\nfor constancy is in their fibre; I should be forever loved, forever\r\nhappy,--I would make my body a stepping-stone by which to raise the man\r\nwho loved me; I would sacrifice all things to him, bear all things from\r\nhim, and love him forever,--even if he ceased to love me. I have never\r\nbefore dared to confess to another heart the secrets of mine, nor the\r\npassionate enthusiasms which exhaust me; but I tell you something of\r\nthem now because, as soon as I have seen you in safety, we shall part\r\nforever."\r\n\r\n"Part? never!" he cried, electrified by the tones of that vigorous soul\r\nwhich seemed to be fighting against some overwhelming thought.\r\n\r\n"Are you free?" she said, with a haughty glance which subdued him.\r\n\r\n"Free! yes, except for the sentence of death which hangs over me."\r\n\r\nShe added presently, in a voice full of bitter feeling: "If all this\r\nwere not a dream, a glorious life might indeed be ours. But I have been\r\ntalking folly; let us beware of committing any. When I think of all you\r\nwould have to be before you could rate me at my proper value I doubt\r\neverything--"\r\n\r\n"I doubt nothing if you will only grant me--"\r\n\r\n"Hush!" she cried, hearing a note of true passion in his voice, "the\r\nopen air is decidedly disagreeing with us; let us return to the coach."\r\n\r\nThat vehicle soon came up; they took their places and drove on several\r\nmiles in total silence. Both had matter for reflection, but henceforth\r\ntheir eyes no longer feared to meet. Each now seemed to have an equal\r\ninterest in observing the other, and in mutually hiding important\r\nsecrets; but for all that they were drawn together by one and the\r\nsame impulse, which now, as a result of this interview, assumed the\r\ndimensions of a passion. They recognized in each other qualities which\r\npromised to heighten all the pleasures to be derived from either\r\ntheir contest or their union. Perhaps both of them, living a life of\r\nadventure, had reached the singular moral condition in which, either\r\nfrom weariness or in defiance of fate, the mind rejects serious\r\nreflection and flings itself on chance in pursuing an enterprise\r\nprecisely because the issues of chance are unknown, and the interest of\r\nexpecting them vivid. The moral nature, like the physical nature, has\r\nits abysses into which strong souls love to plunge, risking their future\r\nas gamblers risk their fortune. Mademoiselle de Verneuil and the young\r\nmarquis had obtained a revelation of each other\'s minds as a consequence\r\nof this interview, and their intercourse thus took rapid strides, for\r\nthe sympathy of their souls succeeded to that of their senses. Besides,\r\nthe more they felt fatally drawn to each other, the more eager they\r\nwere to study the secret action of their minds. The so-called Vicomte de\r\nBauvan, surprised at the seriousness of the strange girl\'s ideas, asked\r\nhimself how she could possibly combine such acquired knowledge of life\r\nwith so much youth and freshness. He thought he discovered an extreme\r\ndesire to appear chaste in the modesty and reserve of her attitudes.\r\nHe suspected her of playing a part; he questioned the nature of his own\r\npleasure; and ended by choosing to consider her a clever actress. He was\r\nright; Mademoiselle de Verneuil, like other women of the world, grew the\r\nmore reserved the more she felt the warmth of her own feelings, assuming\r\nwith perfect naturalness the appearance of prudery, beneath which such\r\nwomen veil their desires. They all wish to offer themselves as virgins\r\non love\'s altar; and if they are not so, the deception they seek to\r\npractise is at least a homage which they pay to their lovers. These\r\nthoughts passed rapidly through the mind of the young man and gratified\r\nhim. In fact, for both, this mutual examination was an advance in their\r\nintercourse, and the lover soon came to that phase of passion in which\r\na man finds in the defects of his mistress a reason for loving her the\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil was thoughtful. Perhaps her imagination led her\r\nover a greater extent of the future than that of the young _emigre_,\r\nwho was merely following one of the many impulses of his life as a man;\r\nwhereas Marie was considering a lifetime, thinking to make it beautiful,\r\nand to fill it with happiness and with grand and noble sentiments.\r\nHappy in such thoughts, more in love with her ideal than with the actual\r\nreality, with the future rather than with the present, she desired now\r\nto return upon her steps so as to better establish her power. In this\r\nshe acted instinctively, as all women act. Having agreed with her soul\r\nthat she would give herself wholly up, she wished--if we may so express\r\nit--to dispute every fragment of the gift; she longed to take back from\r\nthe past all her words and looks and acts and make them more in harmony\r\nwith the dignity of a woman beloved. Her eyes at times expressed a sort\r\nof terror as she thought of the interview just over, in which she\r\nhad shown herself aggressive. But as she watched the face before her,\r\ninstinct with power, and felt that a being so strong must also be\r\ngenerous, she glowed at the thought that her part in life would be\r\nnobler than that of most women, inasmuch as her lover was a man of\r\ncharacter, a man condemned to death, who had come to risk his life in\r\nmaking war against the Republic. The thought of occupying such a soul to\r\nthe exclusion of all rivals gave a new aspect to many matters. Between\r\nthe moment, only five hours earlier, when she composed her face and\r\ntoned her voice to allure the young man, and the present moment, when\r\nshe was able to convulse him with a look, there was all the difference\r\nto her between a dead world and a living one.\r\n\r\nIn the condition of soul in which Mademoiselle de Verneuil now existed\r\nexternal life seemed to her a species of phantasmagoria. The carriage\r\npassed through villages and valleys and mounted hills which left no\r\nimpressions on her mind. They reached Mayenne; the soldiers of the\r\nescort were changed; Merle spoke to her; she replied; they crossed the\r\nwhole town and were again in the open country; but the faces, houses,\r\nstreets, landscape, men, swept past her like the figments of a dream.\r\nNight came, and Marie was travelling beneath a diamond sky, wrapped in\r\nsoft light, and yet she was not aware that darkness had succeeded day;\r\nthat Mayenne was passed; that Fougeres was near; she knew not even where\r\nshe was going. That she should part in a few hours from the man she\r\nhad chosen, and who, she believed, had chosen her, was not for her a\r\npossibility. Love is the only passion which looks to neither past nor\r\nfuture. Occasionally her thoughts escaped in broken words, in phrases\r\ndevoid of meaning, though to her lover\'s ears they sounded like promises\r\nof love. To the two witnesses of this birth of passion she seemed to\r\nbe rushing onward with fearful rapidity. Francine knew Marie as well as\r\nMadame du Gua knew the marquis, and their experience of the past made\r\nthem await in silence some terrible finale. It was, indeed, not long\r\nbefore the end came to the drama which Mademoiselle de Verneuil had\r\ncalled, without perhaps imagining the truth of her words, a tragedy.\r\n\r\nWhen the travellers were about three miles beyond Mayenne they heard\r\na horseman riding after them with great rapidity. When he reached the\r\ncarriage he leaned towards it to look at Mademoiselle de Verneuil,\r\nwho recognized Corentin. That offensive personage made her a sign of\r\nintelligence, the familiarity of which was deeply mortifying; then he\r\nturned away, after chilling her to the bone with a look full of some\r\nbase meaning. The young _emigre_ seemed painfully affected by this\r\ncircumstance, which did not escape the notice of his pretended mother;\r\nbut Marie softly touched him, seeming by her eyes to take refuge in his\r\nheart as thought it were her only haven. His brow cleared at this proof\r\nof the full extent of his mistress\'s attachment, coming to him as it\r\nwere by accident. An inexplicable fear seemed to have overcome\r\nher coyness, and her love was visible for a moment without a veil.\r\nUnfortunately for both of them, Madame du Gua saw it all; like a miser\r\nwho gives a feast, she seemed to count the morsels and begrudge the\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in their happiness the lovers arrived, without any\r\nconsciousness of the distance they had traversed, at that part of the\r\nroad which passed through the valley of Ernee. There Francine noticed\r\nand showed to her companions a number of strange forms which seemed to\r\nmove like shadows among the trees and gorse that surrounded the fields.\r\nWhen the carriage came within range of these shadows a volley of\r\nmusketry, the balls of which whistled above their heads, warned the\r\ntravellers that the shadows were realities. The escort had fallen into a\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\nCaptain Merle now keenly regretted having adopted Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil\'s idea that a rapid journey by night would be a safe one,--an\r\nerror which had led him to reduce his escort from Mayenne to sixty men.\r\nHe at once, under Gerard\'s orders, divided his little troop into two\r\ncolumns, one on each side of the road, which the two officers marched\r\nat a quick step among the gorse hedges, eager to meet the assailants,\r\nthough ignorant of their number. The Blues beat the thick bushes right\r\nand left with rash intrepidity, and replied to the Chouans with a steady\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil\'s first impulse was to jump from the carriage\r\nand run back along the road until she was out of sight of the battle;\r\nbut ashamed of her fears, and moved by the feeling which impels us all\r\nto act nobly under the eyes of those we love, she presently stood still,\r\nendeavoring to watch the combat coolly.\r\n\r\nThe marquis followed her, took her hand, and placed it on his breast.\r\n\r\n"I was afraid," she said, smiling, "but now--"\r\n\r\nJust then her terrified maid cried out: "Marie, take care!"\r\n\r\nBut as she said the words, Francine, who was springing from the\r\ncarriage, felt herself grasped by a strong hand. The sudden weight\r\nof that enormous hand made her shriek violently; she turned, and was\r\ninstantly silenced on recognizing Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\n"Twice I owe to chance," said the marquis to Mademoiselle de Verneuil,\r\n"the revelation of the sweetest secrets of the heart. Thanks to Francine\r\nI now know you bear the gracious name of Marie,--Marie, the name I have\r\ninvoked in my distresses,--Marie, a name I shall henceforth speak in\r\njoy, and never without sacrifice, mingling religion and love. There can\r\nbe no wrong where prayer and love go together."\r\n\r\nThey clasped hands, looked silently into each other\'s eyes, and the\r\nexcess of their emotion took away from them the power to express it.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no danger for _the rest of you_," Marche-a-Terre was saying\r\nroughly to Francine, giving to his hoarse and guttural voice a\r\nreproachful tone, and emphasizing his last words in a way to stupefy the\r\ninnocent peasant-girl. For the first time in her life she saw ferocity\r\nin that face. The moonlight seemed to heighten the effect of it. The\r\nsavage Breton, holding his cap in one hand and his heavy carbine in the\r\nother, dumpy and thickset as a gnome, and bathed in that white light the\r\nshadows of which give such fantastic aspects to forms, seemed to belong\r\nmore to a world of goblins than to reality. This apparition and its\r\ntone of reproach came upon Francine with the suddenness of a phantom.\r\nHe turned rapidly to Madame du Gua, with whom he exchanged a few eager\r\nwords, which Francine, who had somewhat forgotten the dialect of Lower\r\nBrittany, did not understand. The lady seemed to be giving him a series\r\nof orders. The short conference ended by an imperious gesture of the\r\nlady\'s hand pointing out to the Chouan the lovers standing a little\r\ndistance apart. Before obeying, Marche-a-Terre glanced at Francine whom\r\nhe seemed to pity; he wished to speak to her, and the girl was aware\r\nthat his silence was compulsory. The rough and sunburnt skin of his\r\nforehead wrinkled, and his eyebrows were drawn violently together. Did\r\nhe think of disobeying a renewed order to kill Mademoiselle de Verneuil?\r\nThe contortion of his face made him all the more hideous to Madame du\r\nGua, but to Francine the flash of his eye seemed almost gentle, for it\r\ntaught her to feel intuitively that the violence of his savage nature\r\nwould yield to her will as a woman, and that she reigned, next to God,\r\nin that rough heart.\r\n\r\nThe lovers were interrupted in their tender interview by Madame du\r\nGua, who ran up to Marie with a cry, and pulled her away as though some\r\ndanger threatened her. Her real object however, was to enable a member\r\nof the royalist committee of Alencon, whom she saw approaching them, to\r\nspeak privately to the Gars.\r\n\r\n"Beware of the girl you met at the hotel in Alencon; she will betray\r\nyou," said the Chevalier de Valois, in the young man\'s ear; and\r\nimmediately he and his little Breton horse disappeared among the bushes\r\nfrom which he had issued.\r\n\r\nThe firing was heavy at that moment, but the combatants did not come to\r\nclose quarters.\r\n\r\n"Adjutant," said Clef-des-Coeurs, "isn\'t it a sham attack, to capture\r\nour travellers and get a ransom."\r\n\r\n"The devil is in it, but I believe you are right," replied Gerard,\r\ndarting back towards the highroad.\r\n\r\nJust then the Chouan fire slackened, for, in truth, the whole object\r\nof the skirmish was to give the chevalier an opportunity to utter his\r\nwarning to the Gars. Merle, who saw the enemy disappearing across the\r\nhedges, thought best not to follow them nor to enter upon a fight that\r\nwas uselessly dangerous. Gerard ordered the escort to take its former\r\nposition on the road, and the convoy was again in motion without the\r\nloss of a single man. The captain offered his hand to Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil to replace her in the coach, for the young nobleman stood\r\nmotionless, as if thunderstruck. Marie, amazed at his attitude, got into\r\nthe carriage alone without accepting the politeness of the Republican;\r\nshe turned her head towards her lover, saw him still motionless, and was\r\nstupefied at the sudden change which had evidently come over him. The\r\nyoung man slowly returned, his whole manner betraying deep disgust.\r\n\r\n"Was I not right?" said Madame du Gua in his ear, as she led him to the\r\ncoach. "We have fallen into the hands of a creature who is trafficking\r\nfor your head; but since she is such a fool as to have fallen in love\r\nwith you, for heaven\'s sake don\'t behave like a boy; pretend to love her\r\nat least till we reach La Vivetiere; once there--But," she thought to\r\nherself, seeing the young man take his place with a dazed air, as if\r\nbewildered, "can it be that he already loves her?"\r\n\r\nThe coach rolled on over the sandy road. To Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s\r\neyes all seemed changed. Death was gliding beside her love. Perhaps it\r\nwas only fancy, but, to a woman who loves, fancy is as vivid as reality.\r\nFrancine, who had clearly understood from Marche-a-Terre\'s glance that\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil\'s fate, over which she had commanded him to\r\nwatch, was in other hands than his, looked pale and haggard, and could\r\nscarcely restrain her tears when her mistress spoke to her. To her\r\neyes Madame du Gua\'s female malignancy was scarcely concealed by\r\nher treacherous smiles, and the sudden changes which her obsequious\r\nattentions to Mademoiselle de Verneuil made in her manners, voice, and\r\nexpression was of a nature to frighten a watchful observer. Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil herself shuddered instinctively, asking herself, "Why should\r\nI fear? She is his mother." Then she trembled in every limb as the\r\nthought crossed her mind, "Is she really his mother?" An abyss suddenly\r\nopened before her, and she cast a look upon the mother and son, which\r\nfinally enlightened her. "That woman loves him!" she thought. "But why\r\nhas she begun these attentions after showing me such coolness? Am I\r\nlost? or--is she afraid of me?"\r\n\r\nAs for the young man, he was flushed and pale by turns; but he kept\r\na quiet attitude and lowered his eyes to conceal the emotions which\r\nagitated him. The graceful curve of his lips was lost in their close\r\ncompression, and his skin turned yellow under the struggle of his stormy\r\nthoughts. Mademoiselle de Verneuil was unable to decide whether any love\r\nfor her remained in his evident anger. The road, flanked by woods at\r\nthis particular point, became darker and more gloomy, and the obscurity\r\nprevented the eyes of the silent travellers from questioning each other.\r\nThe sighing of the wind, the rustling of the trees, the measured step\r\nof the escort, gave that almost solemn character to the scene which\r\nquickens the pulses. Mademoiselle de Verneuil could not long try in vain\r\nto discover the reason of this change. The recollection of Corentin came\r\nto her like a flash, and reminded her suddenly of her real destiny.\r\nFor the first time since the morning she reflected seriously on her\r\nposition. Until then she had yielded herself up to the delight of\r\nloving, without a thought of the past or of the future. Unable to bear\r\nthe agony of her mind, she sought, with the patience of love, to obtain\r\na look from the young man\'s eyes, and when she did so her paleness and\r\nthe quiver in her face had so penetrating an influence over him that he\r\nwavered; but the softening was momentary.\r\n\r\n"Are you ill, mademoiselle?" he said, but his voice had no gentleness;\r\nthe very question, the look, the gesture, all served to convince her\r\nthat the events of this day belonged to a mirage of the soul which was\r\nfast disappearing like mists before the wind.\r\n\r\n"Am I ill?" she replied, with a forced laugh. "I was going to ask you\r\nthe same question."\r\n\r\n"I supposed you understood each other," remarked Madame du Gua with\r\nspecious kindliness.\r\n\r\nNeither the young man nor Mademoiselle de Verneuil replied. The girl,\r\ndoubly insulted, was angered at feeling her powerful beauty powerless.\r\nShe knew she could discover the cause of the present situation the\r\nmoment she chose to do so; but, for the first time, perhaps, a woman\r\nrecoiled before a secret. Human life is sadly fertile in situations\r\nwhere, as a result of either too much meditation or of some catastrophe,\r\nour thoughts seem to hold to nothing; they have no substance, no point\r\nof departure, and the present has no hooks by which to hold to the past\r\nor fasten on the future. This was Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s condition\r\nat the present moment. Leaning back in the carriage, she sat there like\r\nan uprooted shrub. Silent and suffering, she looked at no one, wrapped\r\nherself in her grief, and buried herself so completely in the unseen\r\nworld, the refuge of the miserable, that she saw nothing around her.\r\nCrows crossed the road in the air above them cawing, but although,\r\nlike all strong hearts, hers had a superstitious corner, she paid no\r\nattention to the omen. The party travelled on in silence. "Already\r\nparted?" Mademoiselle de Verneuil was saying to herself. "Yet no one\r\nabout us has uttered one word. Could it be Corentin? It is not his\r\ninterest to speak. Who can have come to this spot and accused me? Just\r\nloved, and already abandoned! I sow attraction, and I reap contempt. Is\r\nit my perpetual fate to see happiness and ever lose it?" Pangs hitherto\r\nunknown to her wrung her heart, for she now loved truly and for the\r\nfirst time. Yet she had not so wholly delivered herself to her lover\r\nthat she could not take refuge from her pain in the natural pride and\r\ndignity of a young and beautiful woman. The secret of her love--a secret\r\noften kept by women under torture itself--had not escaped her lips.\r\nPresently she rose from her reclining attitude, ashamed that she had\r\nshown her passion by her silent sufferings; she shook her head with a\r\nlight-hearted action, and showed a face, or rather a mask, that was gay\r\nand smiling, then she raised her voice to disguise the quiver of it.\r\n\r\n"Where are we?" she said to Captain Merle, who kept himself at a certain\r\ndistance from the carriage.\r\n\r\n"About six miles from Fougeres, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\n"We shall soon be there, shall we not?" she went on, to encourage a\r\nconversation in which she might show some preference for the young\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n"A Breton mile," said Merle much delighted, "has the disadvantage of\r\nnever ending; when you are at the top of one hill you see a valley\r\nand another hill. When you reach the summit of the slope we are now\r\nascending you will see the plateau of Mont Pelerine in the distance.\r\nLet us hope the Chouans won\'t take their revenge there. Now, in going up\r\nhill and going down hill one doesn\'t make much headway. From La Pelerine\r\nyou will still see--"\r\n\r\nThe young _emigre_ made a movement at the name which Marie alone\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n"What is La Pelerine?" she asked hastily, interrupting the captain\'s\r\ndescription of Breton topography.\r\n\r\n"It is the summit of a mountain," said Merle, "which gives its name to\r\nthe Maine valley through which we shall presently pass. It separates\r\nthis valley from that of Couesnon, at the end of which is the town\r\nof Fougeres, the chief town in Brittany. We had a fight there last\r\nVendemiaire with the Gars and his brigands. We were escorting Breton\r\nconscripts, who meant to kill us sooner than leave their own land; but\r\nHulot is a rough Christian, and he gave them--"\r\n\r\n"Did you see the Gars?" she asked. "What sort of man is he?"\r\n\r\nHer keen, malicious eyes never left the so-called vicomte\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Well, mademoiselle," replied Merle, nettled at being always\r\ninterrupted, "he is so like citizen du Gua, that if your friend did not\r\nwear the uniform of the Ecole Polytechnique I could swear it was he."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil looked fixedly at the cold, impassible young\r\nman who had scorned her, but she saw nothing in him that betrayed the\r\nslightest feeling of alarm. She warned him by a bitter smile that she\r\nhad now discovered the secret so treacherously kept; then in a jesting\r\nvoice, her nostrils dilating with pleasure, and her head so turned\r\nthat she could watch the young man and yet see Merle, she said to the\r\nRepublican: "That new leader gives a great deal of anxiety to the First\r\nConsul. He is very daring, they say; but he has the weakness of rushing\r\nheadlong into adventures, especially with women."\r\n\r\n"We are counting on that to get even with him," said the captain. "If we\r\ncatch him for only an hour we shall put a bullet in his head. He\'ll do\r\nthe same to us if he meets us, so _par pari_--"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said the _emigre_, "we have nothing to fear. Your soldiers cannot\r\ngo as far as La Pelerine, they are tired, and, if you consent, we can\r\nall rest a short distance from here. My mother stops at La Vivetiere,\r\nthe road to which turns off a few rods farther on. These ladies might\r\nlike to stop there too; they must be tired with their long drive from\r\nAlencon without resting; and as mademoiselle," he added, with forced\r\npoliteness, "has had the generosity to give safety as well as pleasure\r\nto our journey, perhaps she will deign to accept a supper from my\r\nmother; and I think, captain," he added, addressing Merle, "the times\r\nare not so bad but what we can find a barrel of cider for your men. The\r\nGars can\'t have taken all, at least my mother thinks not--"\r\n\r\n"Your mother?" said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, interrupting him in a tone\r\nof irony, and making no reply to his invitation.\r\n\r\n"Does my age seem more improbable to you this evening, mademoiselle?"\r\nsaid Madame du Gua. "Unfortunately I was married very young, and my son\r\nwas born when I was fifteen."\r\n\r\n"Are you not mistaken, madame?--when you were thirty, perhaps."\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua turned livid as she swallowed the sarcasm. She would have\r\nliked to revenge herself on the spot, but was forced to smile, for she\r\nwas determined at any cost, even that of insult, to discover the nature\r\nof the feelings that actuated the young girl; she therefore pretended\r\nnot to have understood her.\r\n\r\n"The Chouans have never had a more cruel leader than the Gars, if we are\r\nto believe the stories about him," she said, addressing herself vaguely\r\nto both Francine and her mistress.\r\n\r\n"Oh, as for cruel, I don\'t believe that," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil;\r\n"he knows how to lie, but he seems rather credulous himself. The leader\r\nof a party ought not to be the plaything of others."\r\n\r\n"Do you know him?" asked the _emigre_, quietly.\r\n\r\n"No," she replied, with a disdainful glance, "but I thought I did."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mademoiselle, he\'s a _malin_, yes a _malin_," said Captain Merle,\r\nshaking his head and giving with an expressive gesture the peculiar\r\nmeaning to the word which it had in those days but has since lost.\r\n"Those old families do sometimes send out vigorous shoots. He has just\r\nreturned from a country where, they say, the _ci-devants_ didn\'t find\r\nlife too easy, and men ripen like medlars in the straw. If that fellow\r\nis really clever he can lead us a pretty dance. He has already formed\r\ncompanies of light infantry who oppose our troops and neutralize the\r\nefforts of the government. If we burn a royalist village he burns two of\r\nours. He can hold an immense tract of country and force us to spread out\r\nour men at the very moment when we want them on one spot. Oh, he knows\r\nwhat he is about."\r\n\r\n"He is cutting his country\'s throat," said Gerard in a loud voice,\r\ninterrupting the captain.\r\n\r\n"Then," said the _emigre_, "if his death would deliver the nation, why\r\ndon\'t you catch him and shoot him?"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he tried to look into the depths of Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil\'s soul, and one of those voiceless scenes the dramatic\r\nvividness and fleeting sagacity of which cannot be reproduced in\r\nlanguage passed between them in a flash. Danger is always interesting.\r\nThe worst criminal threatened with death excites pity. Though\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil was now certain that the lover who had cast her\r\noff was this very leader of the Chouans, she was not ready to verify her\r\nsuspicions by giving him up; she had quite another curiosity to satisfy.\r\nShe preferred to doubt or to believe as her passion led her, and she\r\nnow began deliberately to play with peril. Her eyes, full of scornful\r\nmeaning, bade the young chief notice the soldiers of the escort; by thus\r\npresenting to his mind triumphantly an image of his danger she made him\r\nfeel that his life depended on a word from her, and her lips seemed\r\nto quiver on the verge of pronouncing it. Like an American Indian, she\r\nwatched every muscle of the face of her enemy, tied, as it were, to the\r\nstake, while she brandished her tomahawk gracefully, enjoying a revenge\r\nthat was still innocent, and torturing like a mistress who still loves.\r\n\r\n"If I had a son like yours, madame," she said to Madame du Gua, who\r\nwas visibly frightened, "I should wear mourning from the day when I had\r\nyielded him to danger; I should know no peace of mind."\r\n\r\nNo answer was made to this speech. She turned her head repeatedly to\r\nthe escort and then suddenly to Madame du Gua, without detecting the\r\nslightest secret signal between the lady and the Gars which might have\r\nconfirmed her suspicions on the nature of their intimacy, which she\r\nlonged to doubt. The young chief calmly smiled, and bore without\r\nflinching the scrutiny she forced him to undergo; his attitude and the\r\nexpression of his face were those of a man indifferent to danger; he\r\neven seemed to say at times: "This is your chance to avenge your wounded\r\nvanity--take it! I have no desire to lessen my contempt for you."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil began to study the young man from the\r\nvantage-ground of her position with coolness and dignity; at the\r\nbottom of her heart she admired his courage and tranquillity. Happy\r\nin discovering that the man she loved bore an ancient title (the\r\ndistinctions of which please every woman), she also found pleasure in\r\nmeeting him in their present situation, where, as champion of a cause\r\nennobled by misfortune, he was fighting with all the faculties of a\r\nstrong soul against a Republic that was constantly victorious. She\r\nrejoiced to see him brought face to face with danger, and still\r\ndisplaying the courage and bravery so powerful on a woman\'s heart; again\r\nand again she put him to the test, obeying perhaps the instinct which\r\ninduces a woman to play with her victim as a cat plays with a mouse.\r\n\r\n"By virtue of what law do you put the Chouans to death?" she said to\r\nMerle.\r\n\r\n"That of the 14th of last Fructidor, which outlaws the insurgent\r\ndepartments and proclaims martial law," replied the Republican.\r\n\r\n"May I ask why I have the honor to attract your eyes?" she said\r\npresently to the young chief, who was attentively watching her.\r\n\r\n"Because of a feeling which a man of honor cannot express to any woman,\r\nno matter who she is," replied the Marquis de Montauran, in a low voice,\r\nbending down to her. "We live in times," he said aloud, "when women do\r\nthe work of the executioner and wield the axe with even better effect."\r\n\r\nShe looked at de Montauran fixedly; then, delighted to be attacked\r\nby the man whose life she held in her hands, she said in a low voice,\r\nsmiling softly: "Your head is a very poor one; the executioner does not\r\nwant it; I shall keep it myself."\r\n\r\nThe marquis looked at the inexplicable girl, whose love had overcome\r\nall, even insult, and who now avenged herself by forgiving that which\r\nwomen are said never to forgive. His eyes grew less stern, less cold;\r\na look of sadness came upon his face. His love was stronger than he\r\nsuspected. Mademoiselle de Verneuil, satisfied with these faint signs of\r\na desired reconciliation, glanced at him tenderly, with a smile that was\r\nlike a kiss; then she leaned back once more in the carriage, determined\r\nnot to risk the future of this happy drama, believing she had assured\r\nit with her smile. She was so beautiful! She knew so well how to conquer\r\nall obstacles to love! She was so accustomed to take all risks and\r\npush on at all hazards! She loved the unexpected, and the tumults of\r\nlife--why should she fear?\r\n\r\nBefore long the carriage, under the young chief\'s directions, left the\r\nhighway and took a road cut between banks planted with apple-trees, more\r\nlike a ditch than a roadway, which led to La Vivetiere. The carriage\r\nnow advanced rapidly, leaving the escort to follow slowly towards the\r\nmanor-house, the gray roofs of which appeared and disappeared among the\r\ntrees. Some of the men lingered on the way to knock the stiff clay of\r\nthe road-bed from their shoes.\r\n\r\n"This is devilishly like the road to Paradise," remarked Beau-Pied.\r\n\r\nThanks to the impatience of the postilion, Mademoiselle de Verneuil soon\r\nsaw the chateau of La Vivetiere. This house, standing at the end of a\r\nsort of promontory, was protected and surrounded by two deep lakelets,\r\nand could be reached only by a narrow causeway. That part of the little\r\npeninsula on which the house and gardens were placed was still further\r\nprotected by a moat filled with water from the two lakes which it\r\nconnected. The house really stood on an island that was well-nigh\r\nimpregnable,--an invaluable retreat for a chieftain, who could be\r\nsurprised there only by treachery.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil put her head out of the carriage as she heard\r\nthe rusty hinges of the great gates open to give entrance to an arched\r\nportal which had been much injured during the late war. The gloomy\r\ncolors of the scene which met her eyes almost extinguished the thoughts\r\nof love and coquetry in which she had been indulging. The carriage\r\nentered a large courtyard that was nearly square, bordered on each side\r\nby the steep banks of the lakelets. Those sterile shores, washed by\r\nwater, which was covered with large green patches, had no other ornament\r\nthan aquatic trees devoid of foliage, the twisted trunks and hoary\r\nheads of which, rising from the reeds and rushes, gave them a certain\r\ngrotesque likeness to gigantic marmosets. These ugly growths seemed\r\nto waken and talk to each other when the frogs deserted them with much\r\ncroaking, and the water-fowl, startled by the sound of the wheels,\r\nflew low upon the surface of the pools. The courtyard, full of rank and\r\nseeded grasses, reeds, and shrubs, either dwarf or parasite, excluded\r\nall impression of order or of splendor. The house appeared to have\r\nbeen long abandoned. The roof seemed to bend beneath the weight of the\r\nvarious vegetations which grew upon it. The walls, though built of the\r\nsmooth, slaty stone which abounds in that region, showed many rifts and\r\nchinks where ivy had fastened its rootlets. Two main buildings, joined\r\nat the angle by a tall tower which faced the lake, formed the whole of\r\nthe chateau, the doors and swinging, rotten shutters, rusty balustrades,\r\nand broken windows of which seemed ready to fall at the first tempest.\r\nThe north wind whistled through these ruins, to which the moon, with her\r\nindefinite light, gave the character and outline of a great spectre.\r\nBut the colors of those gray-blue granites, mingling with the black and\r\ntawny schists, must have been seen in order to understand how vividly\r\na spectral image was suggested by the empty and gloomy carcass of the\r\nbuilding. Its disjointed stones and paneless windows, the battered tower\r\nand broken roofs gave it the aspect of a skeleton; the birds of prey\r\nwhich flew from it, shrieking, added another feature to this vague\r\nresemblance. A few tall pine-trees standing behind the house waved their\r\ndark foliage above the roof, and several yews cut into formal shapes at\r\nthe angles of the building, festooned it gloomily like the ornaments on\r\na hearse. The style of the doors, the coarseness of the decorations,\r\nthe want of harmony in the architecture, were all characteristic of the\r\nfeudal manors of which Brittany was proud; perhaps justly proud, for\r\nthey maintained upon that Gaelic ground a species of monumental history\r\nof the nebulous period which preceded the establishment of the French\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, to whose imagination the word "chateau"\r\nbrought none but its conventional ideas, was affected by the funereal\r\naspect of the scene. She sprang from the carriage and stood apart gazing\r\nat in terror, and debating within herself what action she ought to take.\r\nFrancine heard Madame du Gua give a sigh of relief as she felt herself\r\nin safety beyond reach of the Blues; an exclamation escaped her when the\r\ngates were closed, and she saw the carriage and its occupants within the\r\nwalls of this natural fortress.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Montauran turned hastily to Mademoiselle de Verneuil,\r\ndivining the thoughts that crowded in her mind.\r\n\r\n"This chateau," he said, rather sadly, "was ruined by the war, just as\r\nmy plans for our happiness have been ruined by you."\r\n\r\n"How ruined?" she asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Are you indeed \'beautiful, brilliant, and of noble birth\'?" he asked\r\nironically, repeating the words she had herself used in their former\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"Who has told you to the contrary?"\r\n\r\n"Friends, in whom I put faith; who care for my safety and are on the\r\nwatch against treachery."\r\n\r\n"Treachery!" she exclaimed, in a sarcastic tone. "Have you forgotten\r\nHulot and Alencon already? You have no memory,--a dangerous defect\r\nin the leader of a party. But if friends," she added, with increased\r\nsarcasm, "are so all-powerful in your heart, keep your friends. Nothing\r\nis comparable to the joys of friendship. Adieu; neither I nor the\r\nsoldiers of the Republic will stop here."\r\n\r\nShe turned towards the gateway with a look of wounded pride and scorn,\r\nand her motions as she did so displayed a dignity and also a despair\r\nwhich changed in an instant the thoughts of the young man; he felt that\r\nthe cost of relinquishing his desires was too great, and he gave himself\r\nup deliberately to imprudence and credulity. He loved; and the lovers\r\nhad no desire now to quarrel with each other.\r\n\r\n"Say but one word and I will believe you," he said, in a supplicating\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"One word?" she answered, closing her lips tightly, "not a single word;\r\nnot even a gesture."\r\n\r\n"At least, be angry with me," he entreated, trying to take the hand she\r\nwithheld from him,--"that is, if you dare to be angry with the leader of\r\nthe rebels, who is now as sad and distrustful as he was lately happy and\r\nconfiding."\r\n\r\nMarie gave him a look that was far from angry, and he added: "You have\r\nmy secret, but I have not yours."\r\n\r\nThe alabaster brow appeared to darken at these words; she cast a look\r\nof annoyance on the young chieftain, and answered, hastily: "Tell you my\r\nsecret? Never!"\r\n\r\nIn love every word, every glance has the eloquence of the moment; but on\r\nthis occasion Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s exclamation revealed nothing,\r\nand, clever as Montauran might be, its secret was impenetrable to him,\r\nthough the tones of her voice betrayed some extraordinary and unusual\r\nemotion which piqued his curiosity.\r\n\r\n"You have a singular way of dispelling suspicion," he said.\r\n\r\n"Do you still suspect me?" she replied, looking him in the eye, as if to\r\nsay, "What rights have you over me?"\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," said the young man, in a voice that was submissive\r\nand yet firm, "the authority you exercise over Republican troops, this\r\nescort--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that reminds me! My escort and I," she asked, in a slightly\r\nsatirical tone, "your protectors, in short,--will they be safe here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, on the word of a gentleman. Whoever you be, you and your party\r\nhave nothing to fear in my house."\r\n\r\nThe promise was made with so loyal and generous an air and manner that\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil felt absolutely secure as to the safety of\r\nthe Republican soldiers. She was about to speak when Madame du Gua\'s\r\napproach silenced her. That lady had either overheard or guessed part of\r\ntheir conversation, and was filled with anxiety at no longer perceiving\r\nany signs of animosity between them. As soon as the marquis caught sight\r\nof her, he offered his hand to Mademoiselle de Verneuil and led her\r\nhastily towards the house, as if to escape an undesired companion.\r\n\r\n"I am in their way," thought Madame du Gua, remaining where she was.\r\nShe watched the lovers walking slowly towards the portico, where they\r\nstopped, as if satisfied to have placed some distance between themselves\r\nand her. "Yes, yes, I am in their way," she repeated, speaking to\r\nherself; "but before long that creature will not be in mine; the lake,\r\nGod willing, shall have her. I\'ll help him keep his word as a gentleman;\r\nonce under the water, she has nothing to fear,--what can be safer than\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\nShe was looking fixedly at the still mirror of the little lake to the\r\nright when suddenly she heard a rustling among the rushes and saw in the\r\nmoonlight the face of Marche-a-Terre rising behind the gnarled trunk\r\nof an old willow. None but those who knew the Chouan well could have\r\ndistinguished him from the tangle of branches of which he seemed a part.\r\nMadame du Gua looked about her with some distrust; she saw the postilion\r\nleading his horses to a stable in the wing of the chateau which was\r\nopposite to the bank where Marche-a-Terre was hiding; Francine, with her\r\nback to her, was going towards the two lovers, who at that moment had\r\nforgotten the whole earth. Madame du Gua, with a finger on her lip to\r\ndemand silence, walked towards the Chouan, who guessed rather than heard\r\nher question, "How many of you are here?"\r\n\r\n"Eighty-seven."\r\n\r\n"They are sixty-five; I counted them."\r\n\r\n"Good," said the savage, with sullen satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAttentive to all Francine\'s movements, the Chouan disappeared behind\r\nthe willow, as he saw her turn to look for the enemy over whom she was\r\nkeeping an instinctive watch.\r\n\r\nSix or eight persons, attracted by the noise of the carriage-wheels,\r\ncame out on the portico, shouting: "It is the Gars! it is he; here he\r\nis!" On this several other men ran out, and their coming interrupted\r\nthe lovers. The Marquis de Montauran went hastily up to them, making an\r\nimperative gesture for silence, and pointing to the farther end of the\r\ncauseway, where the Republican escort was just appearing. At the sight\r\nof the well-known blue uniforms with red facings, and the glittering\r\nbayonets, the amazed conspirators called out hastily, "You have surely\r\nnot betrayed us?"\r\n\r\n"If I had, I should not warn you," said the marquis, smiling bitterly.\r\n"Those Blues," he added, after a pause, "are the escort of this young\r\nlady, whose generosity has delivered us, almost miraculously, from\r\na danger we were in at Alencon. I will tell you about it later.\r\nMademoiselle and her escort are here in safety, on my word as a\r\ngentleman, and we must all receive them as friends."\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua and Francine were now on the portico; the marquis offered\r\nhis hand to Mademoiselle de Verneuil, the group of gentlemen parted in\r\ntwo lines to allow them to pass, endeavoring, as they did so, to catch\r\nsight of the young lady\'s features; for Madame du Gua, who was following\r\nbehind, excited their curiosity by secret signs.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil saw, with surprise, that a large table was set\r\nin the first hall, for about twenty guests. The dining-room opened into\r\na vast salon, where the whole party were presently assembled. These\r\nrooms were in keeping with the dilapidated appearance of the outside of\r\nthe house. The walnut panels, polished by age, but rough and coarse in\r\ndesign and badly executed, were loose in their places and ready to fall.\r\nTheir dingy color added to the gloom of these apartments, which were\r\nbarren of curtains and mirrors; a few venerable bits of furniture in\r\nthe last stages of decay alone remained, and harmonized with the general\r\ndestruction. Marie noticed maps and plans stretched out upon long\r\ntables, and in the corners of the room a quantity of weapons and stacked\r\ncarbines. These things bore witness, though she did not know it, to an\r\nimportant conference between the leaders of the Vendeans and those of\r\nthe Chouans.\r\n\r\nThe marquis led Mademoiselle de Verneuil to a large and worm-eaten\r\narmchair placed beside the fireplace; Francine followed and stood behind\r\nher mistress, leaning on the back of that ancient bit of furniture.\r\n\r\n"You will allow me for a moment to play the part of master of the\r\nhouse," he said, leaving the two women and mingling with the groups of\r\nhis other guests.\r\n\r\nFrancine saw the gentlemen hasten, after a few words from Montauran, to\r\nhide their weapons, maps, and whatever else might arouse the suspicions\r\nof the Republican officers. Some took off their broad leather belts\r\ncontaining pistols and hunting-knives. The marquis requested them to\r\nshow the utmost prudence, and went himself to see to the reception of\r\nthe troublesome guests whom fate had bestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, who had raised her feet to the fire and was\r\nnow warming them, did not turn her head as Montauran left the room, thus\r\ndisappointing those present, who were anxious to see her. Francine alone\r\nsaw the change produced upon the company by the departure of the young\r\nchief. The gentlemen gathered hastily round Madame du Gua, and during\r\na conversation carried on in an undertone between them, they all turned\r\nseveral times to look curiously at the stranger.\r\n\r\n"You know Montauran," Madame du Gua said to them; "he has fallen in love\r\nwith that worthless girl, and, as you can easily understand, he thinks\r\nall my warnings selfish. Our friends in Paris, Messieurs de Valois and\r\nd\'Esgrignon, have warned him of a trap set for him by throwing some\r\nsuch creature at his head; but in spite of this he allows himself to be\r\nfooled by the first woman he meets,--a girl who, if my information is\r\ncorrect, has stolen a great name only to disgrace it."\r\n\r\nThe speaker, in whom our readers have already recognized the lady who\r\ninstigated the attack on the "turgotine," may be allowed to keep\r\nthe name which she used to escape the dangers that threatened her in\r\nAlencon. The publication of her real name would only mortify a noble\r\nfamily already deeply afflicted at the misconduct of this woman; whose\r\nhistory, by the bye, has already been given on another scene.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity manifested by the company of men soon became impertinent\r\nand almost hostile. A few harsh words reached Francine\'s ear, and after\r\na word said to her mistress the girl retreated into the embrasure of a\r\nwindow. Marie rose, turned towards the insolent group, and gave them a\r\nlook full of dignity and even disdain. Her beauty, the elegance of her\r\nmanners, and her pride changed the behavior of her enemies, and won her\r\nthe flattering murmur which escaped their lips. Two or three men, whose\r\noutward appearance seemed to denote the habits of polite society and\r\nthe gallantry acquired in courts, came towards her; but her propriety\r\nof demeanor forced them to respect her, and none dared speak to her; so\r\nthat, instead of being herself arraigned by the company, it was she who\r\nappeared to judge of them. These chiefs of a war undertaken for God and\r\nthe king bore very little resemblance to the portraits her fancy had\r\ndrawn of them. The struggle, really great in itself, shrank to mean\r\nproportions as she observed these provincial noblemen, all, with one\r\nor two vigorous exceptions, devoid of significance and virility. Having\r\nmade to herself a poem of such heroes, Marie suddenly awakened to the\r\ntruth. Their faces expressed to her eyes more a love of scheming than\r\na love of glory; self-interest had evidently put arms into their hands.\r\nStill, it must be said that these men did become heroic when brought\r\ninto action. The loss of her illusions made Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nunjust, and prevented her from recognizing the real devotion which\r\nrendered several of these men remarkable. It is true that most of those\r\nnow present were commonplace. A few original and marked faces appeared\r\namong them, but even these were belittled by the artificiality and the\r\netiquette of aristocracy. If Marie generously granted intellect and\r\nperception to the latter, she also discerned in them a total absence of\r\nthe simplicity, the grandeur, to which she had been accustomed among\r\nthe triumphant men of the Republic. This nocturnal assemblage in the old\r\nruined castle made her smile; the scene seemed symbolic of the monarchy.\r\nBut the thought came to her with delight that the marquis at least\r\nplayed a noble part among these men, whose only remaining merit in her\r\neyes was devotion to a lost cause. She pictured her lover\'s face upon\r\nthe background of this company, rejoicing to see it stand forth among\r\nthose paltry and puny figures who were but the instruments of his great\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps of the marquis were heard in the adjoining room. Instantly\r\nthe company separated into little groups and the whisperings ceased.\r\nLike schoolboys who have plotted mischief in the master\'s absence, they\r\nhurriedly became silent and orderly. Montauran entered. Marie had\r\nthe happiness of admiring him among his fellows, of whom he was the\r\nyoungest, the handsomest, and the chief. Like a king in his court,\r\nhe went from group to group, distributing looks and nods and words of\r\nencouragement or warning, with pressure of the hands and smiles; doing\r\nhis duty as leader of a party with a grace and self-possession hardly\r\nto be expected in the young man whom Marie had so lately accused of\r\nheedlessness.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the marquis put an end to the open curiosity bestowed\r\non Mademoiselle de Verneuil, but Madame du Gua\'s scandalous suggestions\r\nbore fruit. The Baron du Guenic, familiarly called "l\'Intime," who by\r\nrank and name had the best right among those present to treat Montauran\r\nfamiliarly, took the young leader by the arm and led him apart.\r\n\r\n"My dear marquis," he said; "we are much disturbed at seeing you on the\r\npoint of committing an amazing folly."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?"\r\n\r\n"Do you know where that girl comes from, who she is, and what her\r\nschemes about you are?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t trouble yourself, my dear Intime; between you and me my fancy for\r\nher will be over to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but suppose that creature betrays you to-night?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll answer that when you tell me why she has not done it already,"\r\nsaid Montauran, assuming with a laugh an air of conceit. "My dear\r\nfellow, look at that charming girl, watch her manners, and dare to tell\r\nme she is not a woman of distinction. If she gave you a few favorable\r\nlooks wouldn\'t you feel at the bottom of your soul a respect for her? A\r\ncertain lady has prejudiced you. I will tell you this: if she were the\r\nlost creature our friends are trying to make her out, I would, after\r\nwhat she and I have said to each other, kill her myself."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose," said Madame du Gua, joining them, "that Fouche is\r\nfool enough to send you a common prostitute out of the streets? He has\r\nprovided seductions according to your deserts. You may choose to be\r\nblind, but your friends are keeping their eyes open to protect you."\r\n\r\n"Madame," replied the Gars, his eyes flashing with anger, "be warned;\r\ntake no steps against that lady, nor against her escort; if you do,\r\nnothing shall save you from my vengeance. I choose that Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil is to be treated with the utmost respect, and as a lady\r\nbelonging to my family. We are, I believe, related to the de Verneuils."\r\n\r\nThe opposition the marquis was made to feel produced the usual effect\r\nof such obstacles on all young men. Though he had, apparently, treated\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil rather lightly, and left it to be supposed that\r\nhis passion for her was a mere caprice, he now, from a feeling of pride,\r\nmade immense strides in his relation to her. By openly protecting her,\r\nhis honor became concerned in compelling respect to her person; and he\r\nwent from group to group assuring his friends, in the tone of a man whom\r\nit was dangerous to contradict, that the lady was really Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil. The doubts and gossip ceased at once. As soon as Montauran\r\nfelt that harmony was restored and anxiety allayed, he returned to his\r\nmistress eagerly, saying in a low voice:--\r\n\r\n"Those mischievous people have robbed me of an hour\'s happiness."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have come back to me," she said, smiling. "I warn you\r\nthat I am inquisitive; therefore you must not get tired of my questions.\r\nTell me, in the first place, who is that worthy in a green cloth\r\njacket?"\r\n\r\n"That is the famous Major Brigaut, a man from the Marais, a comrade of\r\nthe late Mercier, called La Vendee."\r\n\r\n"And that fat priest with the red face to whom he is talking at this\r\nmoment about me?" she went on.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to know what they are saying?"\r\n\r\n"Do I want to know it? What a useless question!"\r\n\r\n"But I could not tell it without offending you."\r\n\r\n"If you allow me to be insulted in your house without avenging me,\r\nmarquis, adieu!" she said. "I will not stay another moment. I have\r\nsome qualms already about deceiving these poor Republicans, loyal and\r\nconfiding as they are!"\r\n\r\nShe made a few hasty steps; the marquis followed her.\r\n\r\n"Dear Marie, listen to me. On my honor, I have silenced their evil\r\nspeaking, without knowing whether it was false or true. But, placed as\r\nI am, if friends whom we have in all the ministries in Paris warn me\r\nto beware of every woman I meet, and assure me that Fouche has employed\r\nagainst me a Judith of the streets, it is not unnatural that my best\r\nfriends here should think you too beautiful to be an honest woman."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the marquis plunged a glance into Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s\r\neyes. She colored, and was unable to restrain her tears.\r\n\r\n"I deserve these insults," she said. "I wish you really thought me that\r\ndespicable creature and still loved me; then, indeed, I could no longer\r\ndoubt you. I believed in you when you were deceiving me, and you\r\nwill not believe me now when I am true. Let us make an end of this,\r\nmonsieur," she said, frowning, but turning pale as death,--"adieu!"\r\n\r\nShe rushed towards the dining-room with a movement of despair.\r\n\r\n"Marie, my life is yours," said the young marquis in her ear.\r\n\r\nShe stopped short and looked at him.\r\n\r\n"No, no," she said, "I will be generous. Farewell. In coming with\r\nyou here I did not think of my past nor of your future--I was beside\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"You cannot mean that you will leave me now when I offer you my life?"\r\n\r\n"You offer it in a moment of passion--of desire."\r\n\r\n"I offer it without regret, and forever," he replied.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the room they had left. Hiding his emotions the marquis\r\ncontinued the conversation.\r\n\r\n"That fat priest whose name you asked is the Abbe Gudin, a Jesuit,\r\nobstinate enough--perhaps I ought to say devoted enough,--to remain in\r\nFrance in spite of the decree of 1793, which banished his order. He\r\nis the firebrand of the war in these regions and a propagandist of the\r\nreligious association called the Sacre-Coeur. Trained to use religion as\r\nan instrument, he persuades his followers that if they are killed\r\nthey will be brought to life again, and he knows how to rouse their\r\nfanaticism by shrewd sermons. You see, it is necessary to work upon\r\nevery man\'s selfish interests to attain a great end. That is the secret\r\nof all political success."\r\n\r\n"And that vigorous, muscular old man, with the repulsive face, who is\r\nhe? I mean the one in the ragged gown of a barrister."\r\n\r\n"Barrister! he aspires to be considered a brigadier-general. Did you\r\nnever hear of de Longuy?"\r\n\r\n"Is that he!" exclaimed Mademoiselle de Verneuil, horrified. "You employ\r\nsuch men as that?"\r\n\r\n"Hush! he\'ll hear you. Do you see that other man in malignant\r\nconversation with Madame du Gua?"\r\n\r\n"The one in black who looks like a judge?"\r\n\r\n"That is one of our go-betweens, La Billardiere, son of a councillor to\r\nthe Breton Parliament, whose real name is something like Flamet; he is\r\nin close correspondence with the princes."\r\n\r\n"And his neighbor? the one who is just putting up his white clay pipe,\r\nand uses all the fingers of his right hand to snap the box, like a\r\ncountryman."\r\n\r\n"By Jove, you are right; he was game-keeper to the deceased husband\r\nof that lady, and now commands one of the companies I send against the\r\nRepublican militia. He and Marche-a-Terre are the two most conscientious\r\nvassals the king has here."\r\n\r\n"But she--who is she?"\r\n\r\n"Charette\'s last mistress," replied the marquis. "She wields great\r\ninfluence over all these people."\r\n\r\n"Is she faithful to his memory?"\r\n\r\nFor all answer the marquis gave a dubious smile.\r\n\r\n"Do you think well of her?"\r\n\r\n"You are very inquisitive."\r\n\r\n"She is my enemy because she can no longer be my rival," said\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, laughing. "I forgive her her past errors if\r\nshe forgives mine. Who is that officer with the long moustache?"\r\n\r\n"Permit me not to name him; he wants to get rid of the First Consul by\r\nassassination. Whether he succeeds or not you will hear of him. He is\r\ncertain to become famous."\r\n\r\n"And you have come here to command such men as these!" she exclaimed in\r\nhorror. "Are _they_ they king\'s defenders? Where are the gentlemen and\r\nthe great lords?"\r\n\r\n"Where?" said the marquis, coolly, "they are in all the courts of\r\nEurope. Who else should win over kings and cabinets and armies to\r\nserve the Bourbon cause and hurl them at that Republic which threatens\r\nmonarchies and social order with death and destruction?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she said, with generous emotion, "be to me henceforth the source\r\nfrom which I draw the ideas I must still acquire about your cause--I\r\nconsent. But let me still remember that you are the only noble who\r\ndoes his duty in fighting France with Frenchmen, without the help of\r\nforeigners. I am a woman; I feel that if my child struck me in anger I\r\ncould forgive him; but if he saw me beaten by a stranger, and consented\r\nto it, I should regard him as a monster."\r\n\r\n"You shall remain a Republican," said the marquis, in the ardor produced\r\nby the generous words which confirmed his hopes.\r\n\r\n"Republican! no, I am that no longer. I could not now respect you if you\r\nsubmitted to the First Consul," she replied. "But neither do I like to\r\nsee you at the head of men who are pillaging a corner of France, instead\r\nof making war against the whole Republic. For whom are you fighting?\r\nWhat do you expect of a king restored to his throne by your efforts? A\r\nwoman did that great thing once, and the liberated king allowed her to\r\nbe burned. Such men are the anointed of the Lord, and there is danger\r\nin meddling with sacred things. Let God take care of his own, and\r\nplace, displace, and replace them on their purple seats. But if you have\r\ncounted the cost, and seen the poor return that will come to you, you\r\nare tenfold greater in my eyes than I thought you--"\r\n\r\n"Ah! you are bewitching. Don\'t attempt to indoctrinate my followers, or\r\nI shall be left without a man."\r\n\r\n"If you would let me convert you, only you," she said, "we might live\r\nhappily a thousand leagues away from all this."\r\n\r\n"These men whom you seem to despise," said the marquis, in a graver\r\ntone, "will know how to die when the struggle comes, and all their\r\nmisdeeds will be forgotten. Besides, if my efforts are crowned with some\r\nsuccess, the laurel leaves of victory will hide all."\r\n\r\n"I see no one but you who is risking anything."\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken; I am not the only one," he replied, with true\r\nmodesty. "See, over there, the new leaders from La Vendee. The first,\r\nwhom you must have heard of as \'Le Grand Jacques,\' is the Comte de\r\nFontain; the other is La Billardiere, whom I mentioned to you just now."\r\n\r\n"Have you forgotten Quiberon, where La Billardiere played so equivocal a\r\npart?" she said, struck by a sudden recollection.\r\n\r\n"La Billardiere took a great deal upon himself. Serving princes is far\r\nfrom lying on a bed of roses."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you make me shudder!" cried Marie. "Marquis," she continued, in\r\na tone which seemed to indicate some mysterious personal reticence, "a\r\nsingle instant suffices to destroy illusions and to betray secrets\r\non which the life and happiness of many may depend--" she stopped, as\r\nthough she feared she had said too much; then she added, in another\r\ntone, "I wish I could be sure that those Republican soldiers were in\r\nsafety."\r\n\r\n"I will be prudent," he said, smiling to disguise his emotion; "but say\r\nno more about your soldiers; have I not answered for their safety on my\r\nword as a gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"And after all," she said, "what right have I to dictate to you? Be my\r\nmaster henceforth. Did I not tell you it would drive me to despair to\r\nrule a slave?"\r\n\r\n"Monsieur le marquis," said Major Brigaut, respectfully, interrupting\r\nthe conversation, "how long are the Blues to remain here?"\r\n\r\n"They will leave as soon as they are rested," said Marie.\r\n\r\nThe marquis looked about the room and noticed the agitation of those\r\npresent. He left Mademoiselle de Verneuil, and his place beside her was\r\ntaken at once by Madame du Gua, whose smiling and treacherous face was\r\nin no way disconcerted by the young chief\'s bitter smile. Just then\r\nFrancine, standing by the window, gave a stifled cry. Marie, noticing\r\nwith amazement that the girl left the room, looked at Madame du Gua, and\r\nher surprise increased as she saw the pallor on the face of her enemy.\r\nAnxious to discover the meaning of Francine\'s abrupt departure, she\r\nwent to the window, where Madame du Gua followed her, no doubt to guard\r\nagainst any suspicions which might arise in her mind. They returned\r\ntogether to the chimney, after each had cast a look upon the shore\r\nand the lake,--Marie without seeing anything that could have caused\r\nFrancine\'s flight, Madame du Gua seeing that which satisfied her she was\r\nbeing obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe lake, at the edge of which Marche-a-Terre had shown his head, where\r\nMadame du Gua had seen him, joined the moat in misty curves, sometimes\r\nbroad as ponds, in other places narrow as the artificial streamlets of\r\na park. The steep bank, washed by its waters, lay a few rods from the\r\nwindow. Francine, watching on the surface of the water the black lines\r\nthrown by the willows, noticed, carelessly at first, the uniform trend\r\nof their branches, caused by a light breeze then prevailing. Suddenly\r\nshe thought she saw against the glassy surface a figure moving with the\r\nspontaneous and irregular motion of life. The form, vague as it was,\r\nseemed to her that of a man. At first she attributed what she saw to\r\nthe play of the moonlight upon the foliage, but presently a second head\r\nappeared, then several others in the distance. The shrubs upon the bank\r\nwere bent and then violently straightened, and Francine saw the long\r\nhedge undulating like one of those great Indian serpents of fabulous\r\nsize and shape. Here and there, among the gorse and taller brambles,\r\npoints of light could be seen to come and go. The girl\'s attention\r\nredoubled, and she thought she recognized the foremost of the dusky\r\nfigures; indistinct as its outlines were, the beating of her heart\r\nconvinced her it was no other than her lover, Marche-a-Terre. Eager\r\nto know if this mysterious approach meant treachery, she ran to the\r\ncourtyard. When she reached the middle of its grass plot she looked\r\nalternately at the two wings of the building and along the steep shores,\r\nwithout discovering, on the inhabited side of the house, any sign\r\nof this silent approach. She listened attentively and heard a slight\r\nrustling, like that which might be made by the footfalls of some wild\r\nanimal in the silence of the forest. She quivered, but did not tremble.\r\nThough young and innocent, her anxious curiosity suggested a ruse. She\r\nsaw the coach and slipped into it, putting out her head to listen, with\r\nthe caution of a hare giving ear to the sound of the distant hunters.\r\nShe saw Pille-Miche come out of the stable, accompanied by two peasants,\r\nall three carrying bales of straw; these they spread on the ground in a\r\nway to form a long bed of litter before the inhabited wing of the house,\r\nparallel with the bank, bordered by dwarf trees.\r\n\r\n"You\'re spreading straw as if you thought they\'d sleep here! Enough,\r\nPille-Miche, enough!" said a low, gruff voice, which Francine\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\n"And won\'t they sleep here?" returned Pille-Miche with a laugh. "I\'m\r\nafraid the Gars will be angry!" he added, too low for Francine to hear.\r\n\r\n"Well, let him," said Marche-a-Terre, in the same tone, "we shall have\r\nkilled the Blues anyway. Here\'s that coach, which you and I had better\r\nput up."\r\n\r\nPille-Miche pulled the carriage by the pole and Marche-a-Terre pushed it\r\nby one of the wheels with such force that Francine was in the barn and\r\nabout to be locked up before she had time to reflect on her situation.\r\nPille-Miche went out to fetch the barrel of cider, which the marquis had\r\nordered for the escort; and Marche-a-Terre was passing along the side of\r\nthe coach, to leave the barn and close the door, when he was stopped\r\nby a hand which caught and held the long hair of his goatskin. He\r\nrecognized a pair of eyes the gentleness of which exercised a power of\r\nmagnetism over him, and he stood stock-still for a moment under their\r\nspell. Francine sprang from the carriage, and said, in the nervous tone\r\nof an excited woman: "Pierre, what news did you give to that lady and\r\nher son on the road? What is going on here? Why are you hiding? I must\r\nknow all."\r\n\r\nThese words brought a look on the Chouan\'s face which Francine had never\r\nseen there before. The Breton led his innocent mistress to the door;\r\nthere he turned her towards the blanching light of the moon, and\r\nanswered, as he looked in her face with terrifying eyes: "Yes, by my\r\ndamnation, Francine, I will tell you, but not until you have sworn on\r\nthese beads (and he pulled an old chaplet from beneath his goatskin)--on\r\nthis relic, which _you know well_," he continued, "to answer me truly\r\none question."\r\n\r\nFrancine colored as she saw the chaplet, which was no doubt a token\r\nof their love. "It was on that," he added, much agitated, "that you\r\nswore--"\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence. The young girl placed her hand on the\r\nlips of her savage lover and silenced him.\r\n\r\n"Need I swear?" she said.\r\n\r\nHe took his mistress gently by the hand, looked at her for a moment and\r\nsaid: "Is the lady you are with really Mademoiselle de Verneuil?"\r\n\r\nFrancine stood with hanging arms, her eyelids lowered, her head bowed,\r\npale and speechless.\r\n\r\n"She is a strumpet!" cried Marche-a-Terre, in a terrifying voice.\r\n\r\nAt the word the pretty hand once more covered his lips, but this time he\r\nsprang back violently. The girl no longer saw a lover; he had turned\r\nto a wild beast in all the fury of its nature. His eyebrows were drawn\r\ntogether, his lips drew apart, and he showed his teeth like a dog which\r\ndefends its master.\r\n\r\n"I left you pure, and I find you muck. Ha! why did I ever leave you! You\r\nare here to betray us; to deliver up the Gars!"\r\n\r\nThese sentences sounded more like roars than words. Though Francine\r\nwas frightened, she raised her angelic eyes at this last accusation and\r\nanswered calmly, as she looked into his savage face: "I will pledge my\r\neternal safety that that is false. That\'s an idea of the lady you are\r\nserving."\r\n\r\nHe lowered his head; then she took his hand and nestling to him with a\r\npretty movement said: "Pierre, what is all this to you and me? I don\'t\r\nknow what you understand about it, but I can\'t make it out. Recollect\r\none thing: that noble and beautiful young lady has been my benefactress;\r\nshe is also yours--we live together like two sisters. No harm must ever\r\ncome to her where we are, you and I--in our lifetime at least. Swear it!\r\nI trust no one here but you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t command here," said the Chouan, in a surly tone.\r\n\r\nHis face darkened. She caught his long ears and twisted them gently as\r\nif playing with a cat.\r\n\r\n"At least," she said, seeing that he looked less stern, "promise me to\r\nuse all the power you have to protect our benefactress."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head as if he doubted of success, and the motion made her\r\ntremble. At this critical moment the escort was entering the courtyard.\r\nThe tread of the soldiers and the rattle of their weapons awoke the\r\nechoes and seemed to put an end to Marche-a-Terre\'s indecision.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I can save her," he said, "if you make her stay in the house.\r\nAnd mind," he added, "whatever happens, you must stay with her and keep\r\nsilence; if not, no safety."\r\n\r\n"I promise it," she replied in terror.\r\n\r\n"Very good; then go in--go in at once, and hide your fears from every\r\none, even your mistress."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nShe pressed his hand; he stood for a moment watching her with an almost\r\npaternal air as she ran with the lightness of a bird up the portico;\r\nthen he slipped behind the bushes, like an actor darting behind the\r\nscenes as the curtain rises on a tragedy.\r\n\r\n"Do you know, Merle," said Gerard as they reached the chateau, "that\r\nthis place looks to me like a mousetrap?"\r\n\r\n"So I think," said the captain, anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe two officers hastened to post sentinels to guard the gate and the\r\ncauseway; then they examined with great distrust the precipitous banks\r\nof the lakes and the surroundings of the chateau.\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said Merle, "we must do one of two things: either trust\r\nourselves in this barrack with perfect confidence, or else not enter it\r\nat all."\r\n\r\n"Come, let\'s go in," replied Gerard.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, released at the word of command, hastened to stack their\r\nmuskets in conical sheaves, and to form a sort of line before the litter\r\nof straw, in the middle of which was the promised barrel of cider.\r\nThey then divided into groups, to whom two peasants began to distribute\r\nbutter and rye-bread. The marquis appeared in the portico to welcome\r\nthe officers and take them to the salon. As Gerard went up the steps he\r\nlooked at both ends of the portico, where some venerable larches spread\r\ntheir black branches; and he called up Clef-des-Coeurs and Beau-Pied.\r\n\r\n"You will each reconnoitre the gardens and search the bushes, and post a\r\nsentry before your line."\r\n\r\n"May we light our fire before starting, adjutant?" asked\r\nClef-des-Coeurs.\r\n\r\nGerard nodded.\r\n\r\n"There! you see, Clef-des-Coeurs," said Beau-Pied, "the adjutant\'s\r\nwrong to run himself into this wasp\'s-nest. If Hulot was in command we\r\nshouldn\'t be cornered here--in a saucepan!"\r\n\r\n"What a stupid you are!" replied Clef-des-Coeurs, "haven\'t you guessed,\r\nyou knave of tricks, that this is the home of the beauty our jovial\r\nMerle has been whistling round? He\'ll marry her to a certainty--that\'s\r\nas clear as a well-rubbed bayonet. A woman like that will do honor to\r\nthe brigade."\r\n\r\n"True for you," replied Beau-Pied, "and you may add that she gives\r\npretty good cider--but I can\'t drink it in peace till I know what\'s\r\nbehind those devilish hedges. I always remember poor Larose and\r\nVieux-Chapeau rolling down the ditch at La Pelerine. I shall recollect\r\nLarose\'s queue to the end of my days; it went hammering down like the\r\nknocker of a front door."\r\n\r\n"Beau-Pied, my friend; you have too much imagination for a soldier; you\r\nought to be making songs at the national Institute."\r\n\r\n"If I\'ve too much imagination," retorted Beau-Pied, "you haven\'t any; it\r\nwill take you some time to get your degree as consul."\r\n\r\nA general laugh put an end to the discussion, for Clef-des-Coeurs found\r\nno suitable reply in his pouch with which to floor his adversary.\r\n\r\n"Come and make our rounds; I\'ll go to the right," said Beau-Pied.\r\n\r\n"Very good, I\'ll take the left," replied his comrade. "But stop one\r\nminute, I must have a glass of cider; my throat is glued together like\r\nthe oiled-silk of Hulot\'s best hat."\r\n\r\nThe left bank of the gardens, which Clef-des-Coeurs thus delayed\r\nsearching at once, was, unhappily, the dangerous slope where Francine\r\nhad seen the moving line of men. All things go by chance in war.\r\n\r\nAs Gerard entered the salon and bowed to the company he cast a\r\npenetrating eye on the men who were present. Suspicions came forcibly to\r\nhis mind, and he went at once to Mademoiselle de Verneuil and said in a\r\nlow voice: "I think you had better leave this place immediately. We are\r\nnot safe here."\r\n\r\n"What can you fear while I am with you?" she answered, laughing. "You\r\nare safer here than you would be at Mayenne."\r\n\r\nA woman answers for her lover in good faith. The two officers were\r\nreassured. The party now moved into the dining-room after some\r\ndiscussion about a guest, apparently of some importance, who had not\r\nappeared. Mademoiselle de Verneuil was able, thanks to the silence which\r\nalways reigns at the beginning of a meal, to give some attention to the\r\ncharacter of the assemblage, which was curious enough under existing\r\ncircumstances. One thing struck her with surprise. The Republican\r\nofficers seemed superior to the rest of the assembly by reason of their\r\ndignified appearance. Their long hair tied behind in a queue drew lines\r\nbeside their foreheads which gave, in those days, an expression of great\r\ncandor and nobleness to young heads. Their threadbare blue uniforms\r\nwith the shabby red facings, even their epaulets flung back behind their\r\nshoulders (a sign throughout the army, even among the leaders, of a lack\r\nof overcoats),--all these things brought the two Republican officers\r\ninto strong relief against the men who surrounded them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they are the Nation, and that means liberty!" thought Marie; then,\r\nwith a glance at the royalists, she added, "on the other side is a man,\r\na king, and privileges." She could not refrain from admiring Merle, so\r\nthoroughly did that gay soldier respond to the ideas she had formed of\r\nthe French trooper who hums a tune when the balls are whistling,\r\nand jests when a comrade falls. Gerard was more imposing. Grave and\r\nself-possessed, he seemed to have one of those truly Republican spirits\r\nwhich, in the days of which we write, crowded the French armies, and\r\ngave them, by means of these noble individual devotions, an energy\r\nwhich they had never before possessed. "That is one of my men with great\r\nideals," thought Mademoiselle de Verneuil. "Relying on the present,\r\nwhich they rule, they destroy the past for the benefit of the future."\r\n\r\nThe thought saddened her because she could not apply it to her lover;\r\ntowards whom she now turned, to discard by a different admiration, these\r\nbeliefs in the Republic she was already beginning to dislike. Looking at\r\nthe marquis, surrounded by men who were bold enough, fanatical enough,\r\nand sufficiently long-headed as to the future to give battle to\r\na victorious Republic in the hope of restoring a dead monarchy, a\r\nproscribed religion, fugitive princes, and lost privileges, "He,"\r\nthought she, "has no less an aim than the others; clinging to those\r\nfragments, he wants to make a future from the past." Her mind, thus\r\ngrasped by conflicting images, hesitated between the new and the old\r\nwrecks. Her conscience told her that the one was fighting for a man, the\r\nother for a country; but she had now reached, through her feelings, the\r\npoint to which reason will also bring us, namely: to a recognition that\r\nthe king _is_ the Nation.\r\n\r\nThe steps of a man echoed in the adjoining room, and the marquis rose\r\nfrom the table to greet him. He proved to be the expected guest, and\r\nseeing the assembled company he was about to speak, when the Gars made\r\nhim a hasty sign, which he concealed from the Republicans, to take his\r\nplace and say nothing. The more the two officers analyzed the faces\r\nabout them, the more their suspicions increased. The clerical dress of\r\nthe Abbe Gudin and the singularity of the Chouan garments were so many\r\nwarnings to them; they redoubled their watchfulness, and soon discovered\r\nmany discrepancies between the manners of the guests and the topics of\r\ntheir conversation. The republicanism of some was quite as exaggerated\r\nas the aristocratic bearing of others was unmistakable. Certain glances\r\nwhich they detected between the marquis and his guests, certain words\r\nof double meaning imprudently uttered, but above all the fringe of\r\nbeard which was round the necks of several of the men and was very\r\nill-concealed by their cravats, brought the officers at last to a full\r\nconviction of the truth, which flashed upon their minds at the same\r\ninstant. They gave each other one look, for Madame du Gua had cleverly\r\nseparated them and they could only impart their thoughts by their eyes.\r\nSuch a situation demanded the utmost caution. They did not know whether\r\nthey and their men were masters of the situation, or whether they had\r\nbeen drawn into a trap, or whether Mademoiselle de Verneuil was the\r\ndupe or the accomplice of this inexplicable state of things. But an\r\nunforeseen event precipitated a crisis before they had fully recognized\r\nthe gravity of their situation.\r\n\r\nThe new guest was one of those solid men who are square at the base and\r\nsquare at the shoulders, with ruddy skins; men who lean backward when\r\nthey walk, seeming to displace much atmosphere about them, and who\r\nappear to think that more than one glance of the eye is needful to take\r\nthem in. Notwithstanding his rank, he had taken life as a joke from\r\nwhich he was to get as much amusement as possible; and yet, although he\r\nknelt at his own shrine only, he was kind, polite, and witty, after the\r\nfashion of those noblemen who, having finished their training at court,\r\nreturn to live on their estates, and never suspect that they have, at\r\nthe end of twenty years, grown rusty. Men of this type fail in tact with\r\nimperturbable coolness, talk folly wittily, distrust good with extreme\r\nshrewdness, and take incredible pains to fall into traps.\r\n\r\nWhen, by a play of his knife and fork which proclaimed him a good\r\nfeeder, he had made up for lost time, he began to look round on the\r\ncompany. His astonishment was great when he observed the two Republican\r\nofficers, and he questioned Madame du Gua with a look, while she, for\r\nall answer, showed him Mademoiselle de Verneuil in the same way. When he\r\nsaw the siren whose demeanor had silenced the suspicions Madame du Gua\r\nhad excited among the guests, the face of the stout stranger broke into\r\none of those insolent, ironical smiles which contain a whole history of\r\nscandal. He leaned to his next neighbor and whispered a few words, which\r\nwent from ear to ear and lip to lip, passing Marie and the two officers,\r\nuntil they reached the heart of one whom they struck to death. The\r\nleaders of the Vendeans and the Chouans assembled round that table\r\nlooked at the Marquis de Montauran with cruel curiosity. The eyes\r\nof Madame du Gua, flashing with joy, turned from the marquis to\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, who was speechless with surprise. The\r\nRepublican officers, uneasy in mind, questioned each other\'s thoughts\r\nas they awaited the result of this extraordinary scene. In a moment the\r\nforks remained inactive in every hand, silence reigned, and every eye\r\nwas turned to the Gars. A frightful anger showed upon his face, which\r\nturned waxen in tone. He leaned towards the guest from whom the rocket\r\nhad started and said, in a voice that seemed muffled in crape, "Death of\r\nmy soul! count, is that true?"\r\n\r\n"On my honor," said the count, bowing gravely.\r\n\r\nThe marquis lowered his eyes for a moment, then he raised them and\r\nlooked fixedly at Marie, who, watchful of his struggle, knew that look\r\nto be her death-warrant.\r\n\r\n"I would give my life," he said in a low voice, "for revenge on the\r\nspot."\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua understood the words from the mere movement of the young\r\nman\'s lips, and she smiled upon him as we smile at a friend whose\r\nregrets are about to cease. The scorn felt for Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nand shown on every face, brought to its height the growing indignation\r\nof the two Republicans, who now rose hastily:--\r\n\r\n"Do you want anything, citizens?" asked Madame du Gua.\r\n\r\n"Our swords, _citoyenne_," said Gerard, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"You do not need them at table," said the marquis, coldly.\r\n\r\n"No, but we are going to play at a game you know very well," replied\r\nGerard. "This is La Pelerine over again."\r\n\r\nThe whole party seemed dumfounded. Just then a volley, fired with\r\nterrible regularity, echoed through the courtyard. The two officers\r\nsprang to the portico; there they beheld a hundred or so of Chouans\r\naiming at the few soldiers who were not shot down at the first\r\ndischarge; these they fired upon as upon so many hares. The Bretons\r\nswarmed from the bank, where Marche-a-Terre had posted them at the peril\r\nof their lives; for after the last volley, and mingling with the cries\r\nof the dying, several Chouans were heard to fall into the lake, where\r\nthey were lost like stones in a gulf. Pille-Miche took aim at Gerard;\r\nMarche-a-Terre held Merle at his mercy.\r\n\r\n"Captain," said the marquis to Merle, repeating to the Republican his\r\nown words, "you see that men are like medlars, they ripen on the straw."\r\nHe pointed with a wave of his hand to the entire escort of the Blues\r\nlying on the bloody litter where the Chouans were despatching those who\r\nstill breathed, and rifling the dead bodies with incredible rapidity. "I\r\nwas right when I told you that your soldiers will not get as far as La\r\nPelerine. I think, moreover, that your head will fill with lead before\r\nmine. What say you?"\r\n\r\nMontauran felt a horrible necessity to vent his rage. His bitter\r\nsarcasm, the ferocity, even the treachery of this military execution,\r\ndone without his orders, but which he now accepted, satisfied in\r\nsome degree the craving of his heart. In his fury he would fain have\r\nannihilated France. The dead Blues, the living officers, all innocent\r\nof the crime for which he demanded vengeance, were to him the cards by\r\nwhich a gambler cheats his despair.\r\n\r\n"I would rather perish than conquer as you are conquering," said Gerard.\r\nThen, seeing the naked and bloody corpses of his men, he cried out,\r\n"Murdered basely, in cold blood!"\r\n\r\n"That was how you murdered Louis XVI., monsieur," said the marquis.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," replied Gerard, haughtily, "there are mysteries in a king\'s\r\ntrial which you could never comprehend."\r\n\r\n"Do you dare to accuse the king?" exclaimed the marquis.\r\n\r\n"Do you dare to fight your country?" retorted Gerard.\r\n\r\n"Folly!" said the marquis.\r\n\r\n"Parricide!" exclaimed the Republican.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," cried Merle, gaily, "a pretty time to quarrel at the\r\nmoment of your death."\r\n\r\n"True," said Gerard, coldly, turning to the marquis. "Monsieur, if it is\r\nyour intention to put us to death, at least have the goodness to shoot\r\nus at once."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s like you, Gerard," said Merle, "always in a hurry to finish\r\nthings. But if one has to travel far and can\'t breakfast on the morrow,\r\nat least we might sup."\r\n\r\nGerard sprang forward without a word towards the wall. Pille-Miche\r\ncovered him, glancing as he did so at the motionless marquis, whose\r\nsilence he took for an order, and the adjutant-major fell like a tree.\r\nMarche-a-Terre ran to share the fresh booty with Pille-Miche; like two\r\nhungry crows they disputed and clamored over the still warm body.\r\n\r\n"If you really wish to finish your supper, captain, you can come with\r\nme," said the marquis to Merle.\r\n\r\nThe captain followed him mechanically, saying in a low voice: "It is\r\nthat devil of a strumpet that caused all this. What will Hulot say?"\r\n\r\n"Strumpet!" cried the marquis in a strangled voice, "then she is one?"\r\n\r\nThe captain seemed to have given Montauran a death-blow, for he\r\nre-entered the house with a staggering step, pale, haggard, and undone.\r\n\r\nAnother scene had meanwhile taken place in the dining-room, which\r\nassumed, in the marquis\'s absence, such a threatening character that\r\nMarie, alone without her protector, might well fancy she read her\r\ndeath-warrant in the eyes of her rival. At the noise of the volley the\r\nguests all sprang to their feet, but Madame du Gua remained seated.\r\n\r\n"It is nothing," she said; "our men are despatching the Blues." Then,\r\nseeing the marquis outside on the portico, she rose. "Mademoiselle whom\r\nyou here see," she continued, with the calmness of concentrated fury,\r\n"came here to betray the Gars! She meant to deliver him up to the\r\nRepublic."\r\n\r\n"I could have done so twenty times to-day and yet I saved his life,"\r\nsaid Mademoiselle de Verneuil.\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua sprang upon her rival like lightning; in her blind\r\nexcitement she tore apart the fastenings of the young girl\'s spencer,\r\nthe stuff, the embroidery, the corset, the chemise, and plunged her\r\nsavage hand into the bosom where, as she well knew, a letter lay hidden.\r\nIn doing this her jealousy so bruised and tore the palpitating throat\r\nof her rival, taken by surprise at the sudden attack, that she left\r\nthe bloody marks of her nails, feeling a sort of pleasure in making\r\nher submit to so degrading a prostitution. In the feeble struggle which\r\nMarie made against the furious woman, her hair became unfastened and\r\nfell in undulating curls about her shoulders; her face glowed with\r\noutraged modesty, and tears made their burning way along her cheeks,\r\nheightening the brilliancy of her eyes, as she quivered with shame\r\nbefore the looks of the assembled men. The hardest judge would have\r\nbelieved in her innocence when he saw her sorrow.\r\n\r\nHatred is so uncalculating that Madame du Gua did not perceive she\r\nhad overshot her mark, and that no one listened to her as she cried\r\ntriumphantly: "You shall now see, gentlemen, whether I have slandered\r\nthat horrible creature."\r\n\r\n"Not so horrible," said the bass voice of the guest who had thrown the\r\nfirst stone. "But for my part, I like such horrors."\r\n\r\n"Here," continued the cruel woman, "is an order signed by Laplace, and\r\ncounter-signed by Dubois, minister of war." At these names several heads\r\nwere turned to her. "Listen to the wording of it," she went on.\r\n\r\n  "\'The military citizen commanders of all grades, the district\r\n  administrators, the _procureur-syndics_, et cetera, of the\r\n  insurgent departments, and particularly those of the localities in\r\n  which the ci-devant Marquis de Montauran, leader of the brigands\r\n  and otherwise known as the Gars, may be found, are hereby\r\n  commanded to give aid and assistance to the _citoyenne_ Marie\r\n  Verneuil and to obey the orders which she may give them at her\r\n  discretion.\'\r\n\r\n"A worthless hussy takes a noble name to soil it with such treachery,"\r\nadded Madame du Gua.\r\n\r\nA movement of astonishment ran through the assembly.\r\n\r\n"The fight is not even if the Republic employs such pretty women against\r\nus," said the Baron du Guenic gaily.\r\n\r\n"Especially women who have nothing to lose," said Madame du Gua.\r\n\r\n"Nothing?" cried the Chevalier du Vissard. "Mademoiselle has a property\r\nwhich probably brings her in a pretty good sum."\r\n\r\n"The Republic must like a joke, to send strumpets for ambassadors," said\r\nthe Abbe Gudin.\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, Mademoiselle seeks the joys that kill," said Madame du\r\nGua, with a horrible expression of pleasure at the end she foresaw.\r\n\r\n"Then why are you still living?" said her victim, rising to her feet,\r\nafter repairing the disorder of her clothes.\r\n\r\nThis bitter sarcasm excited a sort of respect for so brave a victim, and\r\nsilenced the assembly. Madame du Gua saw a satirical smile on the lips\r\nof the men, which infuriated her, and paying no attention to the marquis\r\nand Merle who were entering the room, she called to the Chouan who\r\nfollowed them. "Pille-Miche!" she said, pointing to Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil, "take her; she is my share of the booty, and I turn her over\r\nto you--do what you like with her."\r\n\r\nAt these words the whole assembly shuddered, for the hideous heads of\r\nPille-Miche and Marche-a-Terre appeared behind the marquis, and the\r\npunishment was seen in all its horror.\r\n\r\nFrancine was standing with clasped hands as though paralyzed.\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, who recovered her presence of mind before the\r\ndanger that threatened her, cast a look of contempt at the assembled\r\nmen, snatched the letter from Madame du Gua\'s hand, threw up her head\r\nwith a flashing eye, and darted towards the door where Merle\'s sword was\r\nstill leaning. There she came upon the marquis, cold and motionless as a\r\nstatue. Nothing pleaded for her on his fixed, firm features. Wounded\r\nto the heart, life seemed odious to her. The man who had pledged her so\r\nmuch love must have heard the odious jests that were cast upon her,\r\nand stood there silently a witness of the infamy she had been made to\r\nendure. She might, perhaps, have forgiven him his contempt, but she\r\ncould not forgive his having seen her in so humiliating a position, and\r\nshe flung him a look that was full of hatred, feeling in her heart the\r\nbirth of an unutterable desire for vengeance. With death beside her,\r\nthe sense of impotence almost strangled her. A whirlwind of passion\r\nand madness rose in her head; the blood which boiled in her veins made\r\neverything about her seem like a conflagration. Instead of killing\r\nherself, she seized the sword and thrust it though the marquis. But the\r\nweapon slipped between his arm and side; he caught her by the wrist and\r\ndragged her from the room, aided by Pille-Miche, who had flung himself\r\nupon the furious creature when she attacked his master. Francine\r\nshrieked aloud. "Pierre! Pierre! Pierre!" she cried in heart-rending\r\ntones, as she followed her mistress.\r\n\r\nThe marquis closed the door on the astonished company. When he reached\r\nthe portico he was still holding the woman\'s wrist, which he clasped\r\nconvulsively, while Pille-Miche had almost crushed the bones of her arm\r\nwith his iron fingers, but Marie felt only the burning hand of the young\r\nleader.\r\n\r\n"You hurt me," she said.\r\n\r\nFor all answer he looked at her a moment.\r\n\r\n"Have you some base revenge to take--like that woman?" she said. Then,\r\nseeing the dead bodies on the heap of straw, she cried out, shuddering:\r\n"The faith of a gentleman! ha! ha! ha!" With a frightful laugh she\r\nadded: "Ha! the glorious day!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "a day without a morrow."\r\n\r\nHe let go her hand and took a long, last look at the beautiful creature\r\nhe could scarcely even then renounce. Neither of these proud natures\r\nyielded. The marquis may have looked for a tear, but the eyes of the\r\ngirl were dry and scornful. Then he turned quickly, and left the victim\r\nto Pille-Miche.\r\n\r\n"God will hear me, marquis," she called. "I will ask Him to give you a\r\nglorious day without a morrow."\r\n\r\nPille-Miche, not a little embarrassed with so rich a prize, dragged\r\nher away with some gentleness and a mixture of respect and scorn. The\r\nmarquis, with a sigh, re-entered the dining-room, his face like that of\r\na dead man whose eyes have not been closed.\r\n\r\nMerle\'s presence was inexplicable to the silent spectators of this\r\ntragedy; they looked at him in astonishment and their eyes questioned\r\neach other. Merle saw their amazement, and, true to his native\r\ncharacter, he said, with a smile: "Gentlemen, you will scarcely refuse a\r\nglass of wine to a man who is about to make his last journey."\r\n\r\nIt was just as the company had calmed down under the influence of these\r\nwords, said with a true French carelessness which pleased the Vendeans,\r\nthat Montauran returned, his face pale, his eyes fixed.\r\n\r\n"Now you shall see," said Merle, "how death can make men lively."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the marquis, with a gesture as if suddenly awaking, "here you\r\nare, my dear councillor of war," and he passed him a bottle of _vin de\r\nGrave_.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thanks, citizen marquis," replied Merle. "Now I can divert myself."\r\n\r\nAt this sally Madame du Gua turned to the other guests with a smile,\r\nsaying, "Let us spare him the dessert."\r\n\r\n"That is a very cruel vengeance, madame," he said. "You forget my\r\nmurdered friend who is waiting for me; I never miss an appointment."\r\n\r\n"Captain," said the marquis, throwing him his glove, "you are free;\r\nthat\'s your passport. The Chasseurs du Roi know that they must not kill\r\nall the game."\r\n\r\n"So much the better for me!" replied Merle, "but you are making a\r\nmistake; we shall come to close quarters before long, and I\'ll not let\r\nyou off. Though your head can never pay for Gerard\'s, I want it and I\r\nshall have it. Adieu. I could drink with my own assassins, but I cannot\r\nstay with those of my friend"; and he disappeared, leaving the guests\r\nastonished at his coolness.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen, what do you think of the lawyers and surgeons and\r\nbailiffs who manage the Republic," said the Gars, coldly.\r\n\r\n"God\'s-death! marquis," replied the Comte de Bauvan; "they have shocking\r\nmanners; that fellow presumed to be impertinent, it seems to me."\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s hasty retreat had a motive. The despised, humiliated\r\nwoman, who was even then, perhaps, being put to death, had so won upon\r\nhim during the scene of her degradation that he said to himself, as he\r\nleft the room, "If she is a prostitute, she is not an ordinary one, and\r\nI\'ll marry her." He felt so sure of being able to rescue her from the\r\nsavages that his first thought, when his own life was given to him,\r\nwas to save hers. Unhappily, when he reached the portico, he found the\r\ncourtyard deserted. He looked about him, listened to the silence, and\r\ncould hear nothing but the distant shouts and laughter of the Chouans,\r\nwho were drinking in the gardens and dividing their booty. He turned the\r\ncorner to the fatal wing before which his men had been shot, and from\r\nthere he could distinguish, by the feeble light of a few stray lanterns,\r\nthe different groups of the Chasseurs du Roi. Neither Pille-Miche, nor\r\nMarche-a-Terre, nor the girl were visible; but he felt himself gently\r\npulled by the flap of his uniform, and, turning round, saw Francine on\r\nher knees.\r\n\r\n"Where is she?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; Pierre drove me back and told me not to stir from here."\r\n\r\n"Which way did they go?"\r\n\r\n"That way," she replied, pointing to the causeway.\r\n\r\nThe captain and Francine then noticed in that direction a line of strong\r\nshadows thrown by the moonlight on the lake, and among them that of a\r\nfemale figure.\r\n\r\n"It is she!" cried Francine.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil seemed to be standing, as if resigned, in the\r\nmidst of other figures, whose gestures denoted a debate.\r\n\r\n"There are several," said the captain. "Well, no matter, let us go to\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"You will get yourself killed uselessly," said Francine.\r\n\r\n"I have been killed once before to-day," he said gaily.\r\n\r\nThey both walked towards the gloomy gateway which led to the causeway;\r\nthere Francine suddenly stopped short.\r\n\r\n"No," she said, gently, "I\'ll go no farther; Pierre told me not to\r\nmeddle; I believe in him; if we go on we shall spoil all. Do as you\r\nplease, officer, but leave me. If Pierre saw us together he would kill\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nJust then Pille-Miche appeared in the gateway and called to the\r\npostilion who was left in the stable. At the same moment he saw the\r\ncaptain and covered him with his musket, shouting out, "By Saint Anne of\r\nAuray! the rector was right enough in telling us the Blues had signed a\r\ncompact with the devil. I\'ll bring you to life, I will!"\r\n\r\n"Stop! my life is sacred," cried Merle, seeing his danger. "There\'s the\r\nglove of your Gars," and he held it out.\r\n\r\n"Ghosts\' lives are not sacred," replied the Chouan, "and I sha\'n\'t give\r\nyou yours. Ave Maria!"\r\n\r\nHe fired, and the ball passed through his victim\'s head. The captain\r\nfell. When Francine reached him she heard him mutter the words, "I\'d\r\nrather die with them than return without them."\r\n\r\nThe Chouan sprang upon the body to strip it, saying, "There\'s one\r\ngood thing about ghosts, they come to life in their clothes." Then,\r\nrecognizing the Gars\' glove, that sacred safeguard, in the captain\'s\r\nhand, he stopped short, terrified. "I wish I wasn\'t in the skin of\r\nmy mother\'s son!" he exclaimed, as he turned and disappeared with the\r\nrapidity of a bird.\r\n\r\nTo understand this scene, so fatal to poor Merle, we must follow\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil after the marquis, in his fury and despair, had\r\nabandoned her to Pille-Miche. Francine had caught Marche-a-Terre by\r\nthe arm and reminded him, with sobs, of the promise he had made her.\r\nPille-Miche was already dragging away his victim like a heavy bundle.\r\nMarie, her head and hair hanging back, turned her eyes to the lake; but\r\nheld as she was in a grasp of iron she was forced to follow the Chouan,\r\nwho turned now and then to hasten her steps, and each time that he did\r\nso a jovial thought brought a hideous smile upon his face.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t she a morsel!" he cried, with a coarse laugh.\r\n\r\nHearing the words, Francine recovered speech.\r\n\r\n"Pierre?"\r\n\r\n"Well, what?"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll kill her."\r\n\r\n"Not at once."\r\n\r\n"Then she\'ll kill herself, she will never submit; and if she dies I\r\nshall die too."\r\n\r\n"Then you love her too much, and she shall die," said Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\n"Pierre! if we are rich and happy we owe it all to her; but, whether or\r\nno, you promised me to save her."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll try; but you must stay here, and don\'t move."\r\n\r\nFrancine at once let go his arm, and waited in horrible suspense in\r\nthe courtyard where Merle found her. Meantime Marche-a-Terre joined his\r\ncomrade at the moment when the latter, after dragging his victim to the\r\nbarn, was compelling her to get into the coach. Pille-Miche called to\r\nhim to help in pulling out the vehicle.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do with all that?" asked Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\n"The Grande Garce gave me the woman, and all that belongs to her is\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"The coach will put a sou or two in your pocket; but as for the woman,\r\nshe\'ll scratch your eyes out like a cat."\r\n\r\nPille-Miche burst into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll tie her up and take her home," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Very good; suppose we harness the horses," said Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Marche-a-Terre, who had left his comrade mounting\r\nguard over his prey, led the coach from the stable to the causeway,\r\nwhere Pille-Miche got into it beside Mademoiselle de Verneuil, not\r\nperceiving that she was on the point of making a spring into the lake.\r\n\r\n"I say, Pille-Miche!" cried Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll buy all your booty."\r\n\r\n"Are you joking?" asked the other, catching his prisoner by the\r\npetticoat, as a butcher catches a calf that is trying to escape him.\r\n\r\n"Let me see her, and I\'ll set a price."\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate creature was made to leave the coach and stand between\r\nthe two Chouans, who each held a hand and looked at her as the Elders\r\nmust have looked at Susannah.\r\n\r\n"Will you take thirty francs in good coin?" said Marche-a-Terre, with a\r\ngroan.\r\n\r\n"Really?"\r\n\r\n"Done?" said Marche-a-Terre, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes, done; I can get plenty of Breton girls for that, and choice\r\nmorsels, too. But the coach; whose is that?" asked Pille-Miche,\r\nbeginning to reflect upon his bargain.\r\n\r\n"Mine!" cried Marche-a-Terre, in a terrible tone of voice, which showed\r\nthe sort of superiority his ferocious character gave him over his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n"But suppose there\'s money in the coach?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you say, \'Done\'?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I said, \'Done.\'"\r\n\r\n"Very good; then go and fetch the postilion who is gagged in the stable\r\nover there."\r\n\r\n"But if there\'s money in the--"\r\n\r\n"Is there any?" asked Marche-a-Terre, roughly, shaking Marie by the arm.\r\n\r\n"Yes, about a hundred crowns."\r\n\r\nThe two Chouans looked at each other.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, friend," said Pille-Miche, "we won\'t quarrel for a female\r\nBlue; let\'s pitch her into the lake with a stone around her neck, and\r\ndivide the money."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you that money as my share in d\'Orgemont\'s ransom," said\r\nMarche-a-Terre, smothering a groan, caused by such sacrifice.\r\n\r\nPille-Miche uttered a sort of hoarse cry as he started to find the\r\npostilion, and his glee brought death to Merle, whom he met on his way.\r\n\r\nHearing the shot, Marche-a-Terre rushed in the direction where he had\r\nleft Francine, and found her praying on her knees, with clasped hands,\r\nbeside the poor captain, whose murder had deeply horrified her.\r\n\r\n"Run to your mistress," said the Chouan; "she is saved."\r\n\r\nHe ran himself to fetch the postilion, returning with all speed, and,\r\nas he repassed Merle\'s body, he noticed the Gars\' glove, which was still\r\nconvulsively clasped in the dead hand.\r\n\r\n"Oho!" he cried. "Pille-Miche has blundered horribly--he won\'t live to\r\nspend his crowns."\r\n\r\nHe snatched up the glove and said to Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who was\r\nalready in the coach with Francine: "Here, take this glove. If any of\r\nour men attack you on the road, call out \'Ho, the Gars!\' show the glove,\r\nand no harm can happen to you. Francine," he said, turning towards her\r\nand seizing her violently, "you and I are quits with that woman; come\r\nwith me and let the devil have her."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t ask me to abandon her just at this moment!" cried Francine,\r\nin distress.\r\n\r\nMarche-a-Terre scratched his ear and forehead, then he raised his head,\r\nand his mistress saw the ferocious expression of his eyes. "You are\r\nright," he said; "I leave you with her one week; if at the end of that\r\ntime you don\'t come with me--" he did not finish the sentence, but he\r\nslapped the muzzle of his gun with the flat of his hand. After making\r\nthe gesture of taking aim at her, he disappeared, without waiting for\r\nher reply.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was he gone than a voice, which seemed to issue from the lake,\r\ncalled, in a muffled tone: "Madame, madame!"\r\n\r\nThe postilion and the two women shuddered, for several corpses were\r\nfloating near them. A Blue, hidden behind a tree, cautiously appeared.\r\n\r\n"Let me get up behind the coach, or I\'m a dead man. That damned cider\r\nwhich Clef-des-Coeurs would stop to drink cost more than a pint of\r\nblood. If he had done as I did, and made his round, our poor comrades\r\nthere wouldn\'t be floating dead in the pond."\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhile these events were taking place outside the chateau, the leaders\r\nsent by the Vendeans and those of the Chouans were holding a council\r\nof war, with their glasses in their hands, under the presidency of\r\nthe Marquis de Montauran. Frequent libations of Bordeaux animated the\r\ndiscussion, which, however, became more serious and important at the\r\nend of the meal. After the general plan of military operations had been\r\ndecided on, the Royalists drank to the health of the Bourbons. It was at\r\nthat moment that the shot which killed Merle was heard, like an echo of\r\nthe disastrous war which these gay and noble conspirators were about to\r\nmake against the Republic. Madame du Gua quivered with pleasure at the\r\nthought that she was freed from her rival; the guests looked at each\r\nother in silence; the marquis rose from the table and went out.\r\n\r\n"He loved her!" said Madame du Gua, sarcastically. "Follow him, Monsieur\r\nde Fontaine, and keep him company; he will be as irritating as a fly if\r\nwe let him sulk."\r\n\r\nShe went to a window which looked on the courtyard to endeavor to see\r\nMarie\'s body. There, by the last gleams of the sinking moon, she caught\r\nsight of the coach being rapidly driven down the avenue of apple-trees.\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil\'s veil was fluttering in the wind. Madame\r\ndu Gua, furious at the sight, left the room hurriedly. The marquis,\r\nstanding on the portico absorbed in gloomy thought, was watching about\r\na hundred and fifty Chouans, who, having divided their booty in the\r\ngardens, were now returning to finish the cider and the rye-bread\r\nprovided for the Blues. These soldiers of a new species, on whom the\r\nmonarchy was resting its hopes, dispersed into groups. Some drank the\r\ncider; others, on the bank before the portico, amused themselves by\r\nflinging into the lake the dead bodies of the Blues, to which they\r\nfastened stones. This sight, joined to the other aspects of the strange\r\nscene,--the fantastic dress, the savage expressions of the barbarous\r\nand uncouth _gars_,--was so new and so amazing to Monsieur de Fontaine,\r\naccustomed to the nobler and better-regulated appearance of the Vendean\r\ntroops, that he seized the occasion to say to the Marquis de Montauran,\r\n"What do you expect to do with such brutes?"\r\n\r\n"Not very much, my dear count," replied the Gars.\r\n\r\n"Will they ever be fit to manoeuvre before the enemy?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Can they understand or execute an order?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then what good will they be to you?"\r\n\r\n"They will help me to plunge my sword into the entrails of the\r\nRepublic," replied the marquis in a thundering voice. "They will give me\r\nFougeres in three days, and all Brittany in ten! Monsieur," he added in\r\na gentler voice, "start at once for La Vendee; if d\'Auticamp, Suzannet,\r\nand the Abbe Bernier will act as rapidly as I do, if they\'ll not\r\nnegotiate with the First Consul, as I am afraid they will" (here he\r\nwrung the hand of the Vendean chief) "we shall be within reach of Paris\r\nin a fortnight."\r\n\r\n"But the Republic is sending sixty thousand men and General Brune\r\nagainst us."\r\n\r\n"Sixty thousand men! indeed!" cried the marquis, with a scoffing laugh.\r\n"And how will Bonaparte carry on the Italian campaign? As for General\r\nBrune, he is not coming. The First Consul has sent him against the\r\nEnglish in Holland, and General Hedouville, _the friend of our friend\r\nBarras_, takes his place here. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\nAs Monsieur de Fontaine heard these words he gave Montauran a look of\r\nkeen intelligence which seemed to say that the marquis had not himself\r\nunderstood the real meaning of the words addressed to him. The two\r\nleaders then comprehended each other perfectly, and the Gars replied\r\nwith an undefinable smile to the thoughts expressed in both their eyes:\r\n"Monsieur de Fontaine, do you know my arms? our motto is \'Persevere unto\r\ndeath.\'"\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Fontaine took Montauran\'s hand and pressed it, saying: "I\r\nwas left for dead at Quatre-Chemins, therefore you need never doubt me.\r\nBut believe in my experience--times have changed."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said La Billardiere, who now joined them. "You are young,\r\nmarquis. Listen to me; your property has not yet been sold--"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" cried Montauran, "can you conceive of devotion without sacrifice?"\r\n\r\n"Do you really know the king?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Then I admire your loyalty."\r\n\r\n"The king," replied the young chieftain, "is the priest; I am fighting\r\nnot for the man, but for the faith."\r\n\r\nThey parted,--the Vendean leader convinced of the necessity of yielding\r\nto circumstances and keeping his beliefs in the depths of his heart; La\r\nBillardiere to return to his negotiations in England; and Montauran to\r\nfight savagely and compel the Vendeans, by the victories he expected to\r\nwin, to co-operate in his enterprise.\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe events of the day had excited such violent emotions in Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil\'s whole being that she lay back almost fainting in the\r\ncarriage, after giving the order to drive to Fougeres. Francine was as\r\nsilent as her mistress. The postilion, dreading some new disaster,\r\nmade all the haste he could to reach the high-road, and was soon on the\r\nsummit of La Pelerine. Through the thick white mists of morning Marie de\r\nVerneuil crossed the broad and beautiful valley of Couesnon (where this\r\nhistory began) scarcely able to distinguish the slaty rock on which the\r\ntown of Fougeres stands from the slopes of La Pelerine. They were\r\nstill eight miles from it. Shivering with cold herself, Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil recollected the poor soldier behind the carriage, and insisted,\r\nagainst his remonstrances, in taking him into the carriage beside\r\nFrancine. The sight of Fougeres drew her for a time out of her\r\nreflections. The sentinels stationed at the Porte Saint-Leonard refused\r\nto allow ingress to the strangers, and she was therefore obliged to\r\nexhibit the ministerial order. This at once gave her safety in entering\r\nthe town, but the postilion could find no other place for her to stop at\r\nthan the Poste inn.\r\n\r\n"Madame," said the Blue whose life she had saved. "If you ever want a\r\nsabre to deal some special blow, my life is yours. I am good for that.\r\nMy name is Jean Falcon, otherwise called Beau-Pied, sergeant of\r\nthe first company of Hulot\'s veterans, seventy-second half-brigade,\r\nnicknamed \'Les Mayencais.\' Excuse my vanity; I can only offer you the\r\nsoul of a sergeant, but that\'s at your service."\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel and walked off whistling.\r\n\r\n"The lower one goes in social life," said Marie, bitterly, "the more\r\nwe find generous feelings without display. A marquis returns death for\r\nlife, and a poor sergeant--but enough of that."\r\n\r\nWhen the weary woman was at last in a warm bed, her faithful Francine\r\nwaited in vain for the affectionate good-night to which she was\r\naccustomed; but her mistress, seeing her still standing and evidently\r\nuneasy, made her a sign of distress.\r\n\r\n"This is called a day, Francine," she said; "but I have aged ten years\r\nin it."\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as soon as she had risen, Corentin came to see her and\r\nshe admitted him.\r\n\r\n"Francine," she exclaimed, "my degradation is great indeed, for the\r\nthought of that man is not disagreeable to me."\r\n\r\nStill, when she saw him, she felt once more, for the hundredth time, the\r\ninstinctive repulsion which two years\' intercourse had increased rather\r\nthan lessened.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, smiling, "I felt certain you were succeeding. Was I\r\nmistaken? did you get hold of the wrong man?"\r\n\r\n"Corentin," she replied, with a dull look of pain, "never mention that\r\naffair to me unless I speak of it myself."\r\n\r\nHe walked up and down the room casting oblique glances at her,\r\nendeavoring to guess the secret thoughts of the singular woman whose\r\nmere glance had the power of discomfiting at times the cleverest men.\r\n\r\n"I foresaw this check," he replied, after a moment\'s silence. "If you\r\nwould be willing to establish your headquarters in this town, I have\r\nalready found a suitable place for you. We are in the very centre of\r\nChouannerie. Will you stay here?"\r\n\r\nShe answered with an affirmative sign, which enabled Corentin to make\r\nconjectures, partly correct, as to the events of the preceding evening.\r\n\r\n"I can hire a house for you, a bit of national property still unsold.\r\nThey are behind the age in these parts. No one has dared buy the old\r\nbarrack because it belonged to an _emigre_ who was thought to be harsh.\r\nIt is close to the church of Saint Leonard; and on my word of honor\r\nthe view from it is delightful. Something can really be made of the old\r\nplace; will you try it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, at once," she cried.\r\n\r\n"I want a few hours to have it cleaned and put in order for you, so that\r\nyou may like it."\r\n\r\n"What matter?" she said. "I could live in a cloister or a prison without\r\ncaring. However, see that everything is in order before night, so that\r\nI may sleep there in perfect solitude. Go, leave me; your presence is\r\nintolerable. I wish to be alone with Francine; she is better for me than\r\nmy own company, perhaps. Adieu; go--go, I say."\r\n\r\nThese words, said volubly with a mingling of coquetry, despotism, and\r\npassion, showed she had entirely recovered her self-possession. Sleep\r\nhad no doubt classified the impressions of the preceding day, and\r\nreflection had determined her on vengeance. If a few reluctant signs\r\nappeared on her face they only proved the ease with which certain women\r\ncan bury the better feelings of their souls, and the cruel dissimulation\r\nwhich enables them to smile sweetly while planning the destruction of\r\na victim. She sat alone after Corentin had left her, thinking how she\r\ncould get the marquis still living into her toils. For the first time\r\nin her life this woman had lived according to her inmost desires; but\r\nof that life nothing remained but one craving,--that of\r\nvengeance,--vengeance complete and infinite. It was her one thought,\r\nher sole desire. Francine\'s words and attentions were unnoticed. Marie\r\nseemed to be sleeping with her eyes open; and the long day passed\r\nwithout an action or even a gesture that bore testimony to her thoughts.\r\nShe lay on a couch which she had made of chairs and pillows. It was late\r\nin the evening when a few words escaped her, as if involuntarily.\r\n\r\n"My child," she said to Francine, "I understood yesterday what it was to\r\nlive for love; to-day I know what it means to die for vengeance. Yes,\r\nI will give my life to seek him wherever he may be, to meet him, seduce\r\nhim, make him mine! If I do not have that man, who dared to despise me,\r\nat my feet humble and submissive, if I do not make him my lackey and my\r\nslave, I shall indeed be base; I shall not be a woman; I shall not be\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nThe house which Corentin now hired for Mademoiselle de Verneuil offered\r\nmany gratifications to the innate love of luxury and elegance that was\r\npart of this girl. The capricious creature took possession of it with\r\nregal composure, as of a thing which already belonged to her; she\r\nappropriated the furniture and arranged it with intuitive sympathy, as\r\nthough she had known it all her life. This is a vulgar detail, but one\r\nthat is not unimportant in sketching the character of so exceptional a\r\nperson. She seemed to have been already familiarized in a dream with the\r\nhouse in which she now lived on her hatred as she might have lived on\r\nher love.\r\n\r\n"At least," she said to herself, "I did not rouse insulting pity in him;\r\nI do not owe him my life. Oh, my first, my last, my only love! what an\r\nend to it!" She sprang upon Francine, who was terrified. "Do you love a\r\nman? Oh, yes, yes, I remember; you do. I am glad I have a woman here who\r\ncan understand me. Ah, my poor Francette, man is a miserable being. Ha!\r\nhe said he loved me, and his love could not bear the slightest test!\r\nBut I,--if all men had accused him I would have defended him; if the\r\nuniverse rejected him my soul should have been his refuge. In the old\r\ndays life was filled with human beings coming and going for whom I did\r\nnot care; it was sad and dull, but not horrible; but now, now, what is\r\nlife without him? He will live on, and I not near him! I shall not see\r\nhim, speak to him, feel him, hold him, press him,--ha! I would rather\r\nstrangle him myself in his sleep!"\r\n\r\nFrancine, horrified, looked at her in silence.\r\n\r\n"Kill the man you love?" she said, in a soft voice.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, if he ceases to love me."\r\n\r\nBut after those ruthless words she hid her face in her hands, and sat\r\ndown silently.\r\n\r\nThe next day a man presented himself without being announced. His face\r\nwas stern. It was Hulot, followed by Corentin. Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nlooked at the commandant and trembled.\r\n\r\n"You have come," she said, "to ask me to account for your friends. They\r\nare dead."\r\n\r\n"I know it," he replied, "and not in the service of the Republic."\r\n\r\n"For me, and by me," she said. "You preach the nation to me. Can the\r\nnation bring to life those who die for her? Can she even avenge\r\nthem? But I--I will avenge them!" she cried. The awful images of the\r\ncatastrophe filled her imagination suddenly, and the graceful creature\r\nwho held modesty to be the first of women\'s wiles forgot herself in a\r\nmoment of madness, and marched towards the amazed commandant brusquely.\r\n\r\n"In exchange for a few murdered soldiers," she said, "I will bring to\r\nthe block a head that is worth a million heads of other men. It is not a\r\nwoman\'s business to wage war; but you, old as you are, shall learn good\r\nstratagems from me. I\'ll deliver a whole family to your bayonets--him,\r\nhis ancestors, his past, his future. I will be as false and treacherous\r\nto him as I was good and true. Yes, commandant, I will bring that little\r\nnoble to my arms, and he shall leave them to go to death. I have no\r\nother rival. The wretch himself pronounced his doom,--_a day without a\r\nmorrow_. Your Republic and I shall be avenged. The Republic!" she cried\r\nin a voice the strange intonations of which horrified Hulot. "Is he to\r\ndie for bearing arms against the nation? Shall I suffer France to rob me\r\nof my vengeance? Ah! what a little thing is life! death can expiate but\r\none crime. He has but one head to fall, but I will make him know in one\r\nnight that he loses more than life. Commandant, you who will kill him,"\r\nand she sighed, "see that nothing betrays my betrayal; he must die\r\nconvinced of my fidelity. I ask that of you. Let him know only me--me,\r\nand my caresses!"\r\n\r\nShe stopped; but through the crimson of her cheeks Hulot and Corentin\r\nsaw that rage and delirium had not entirely smothered all sense of\r\nshame. Marie shuddered violently as she said the words; she seemed to\r\nlisten to them as though she doubted whether she herself had said them,\r\nand she made the involuntary movement of a woman whose veil is falling\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\n"But you had him in your power," said Corentin.\r\n\r\n"Very likely."\r\n\r\n"Why did you stop me when I had him?" asked Hulot.\r\n\r\n"I did not know what he would prove to be," she cried. Then, suddenly,\r\nthe excited woman, who was walking up and down with hurried steps and\r\ncasting savage glances at the spectators of the storm, calmed down. "I\r\ndo not know myself," she said, in a man\'s tone. "Why talk? I must go and\r\nfind him."\r\n\r\n"Go and find him?" said Hulot. "My dear woman, take care; we are not yet\r\nmasters of this part of the country; if you venture outside of the town\r\nyou will be taken or killed before you\'ve gone a hundred yards."\r\n\r\n"There\'s never any danger for those who seek vengeance," she said,\r\ndriving from her presence with a disdainful gesture the two men whom she\r\nwas ashamed to face.\r\n\r\n"What a woman!" cried Hulot as he walked away with Corentin. "A queer\r\nidea of those police fellows in Paris to send her here; but she\'ll never\r\ndeliver him up to us," he added, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, she will," replied Corentin.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see she loves him?" said Hulot.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just why she will. Besides," looking at the amazed commandant,\r\n"I am here to see that she doesn\'t commit any folly. In my opinion,\r\ncomrade, there is no love in the world worth the three hundred thousand\r\nfrancs she\'ll make out of this."\r\n\r\nWhen the police diplomatist left the soldier the latter stood looking\r\nafter him, and as the sound of the man\'s steps died away he gave a sigh,\r\nmuttering to himself, "It may be a good thing after all to be such a\r\ndullard as I am. God\'s thunder! if I meet the Gars I\'ll fight him hand\r\nto hand, or my name\'s not Hulot; for if that fox brings him before me in\r\nany of their new-fangled councils of war, my honor will be as soiled as\r\nthe shirt of a young trooper who is under fire for the first time."\r\n\r\nThe massacre at La Vivetiere, and the desire to avenge his friends had\r\nled Hulot to accept a reinstatement in his late command; in fact, the\r\nnew minister, Berthier, had refused to accept his resignation under\r\nexisting circumstances. To the official despatch was added a private\r\nletter, in which, without explaining the mission of Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil, the minister informed him that the affair was entirely outside\r\nof the war, and not to interfere with any military operations. The duty\r\nof the commanders, he said, was limited to giving assistance to that\r\nhonorable _citoyenne_, if occasion arose. Learning from his scouts that\r\nthe movements of the Chouans all tended towards a concentration of their\r\nforces in the neighborhood of Fougeres, Hulot secretly and with forced\r\nmarches brought two battalions of his brigade into the town. The\r\nnation\'s danger, his hatred of aristocracy, whose partisans threatened\r\nto convulse so large a section of country, his desire to avenge his\r\nmurdered friends, revived in the old veteran the fire of his youth.\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n"So this is the life I craved," exclaimed Mademoiselle de Verneuil, when\r\nshe was left alone with Francine. "No matter how fast the hours go, they\r\nare to me like centuries of thought."\r\n\r\nSuddenly she took Francine\'s hand, and her voice, soft as that of\r\nthe first red-throat singing after a storm, slowly gave sound to the\r\nfollowing words:--\r\n\r\n"Try as I will to forget them, I see those two delicious lips, that chin\r\njust raised, those eyes of fire; I hear the \'Hue!\' of the postilion; I\r\ndream, I dream,--why then such hatred on awakening!"\r\n\r\nShe drew a long sigh, rose, and then for the first time looked out upon\r\nthe country delivered over to civil war by the cruel leader whom she was\r\nplotting to destroy. Attracted by the scene she wandered out to breathe\r\nat her ease beneath the sky; and though her steps conducted her at a\r\nventure, she was surely led to the Promenade of the town by one of those\r\noccult impulses of the soul which lead us to follow hope irrationally.\r\nThoughts conceived under the dominion of that spell are often\r\nrealized; but we then attribute their pre-vision to a power we call\r\npresentiment,--an inexplicable power, but a real one,--which our\r\npassions find accommodating, like a flatterer who, among his many lies,\r\ndoes sometimes tell the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. A DAY WITHOUT A MORROW\r\n\r\nThe preceding events of this history having been greatly influenced by\r\nthe formation of the regions in which they happened, it is desirable\r\nto give a minute description of them, without which the closing scenes\r\nmight be difficult of comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe town of Fougeres is partly built upon a slate rock, which seems to\r\nhave slipped from the mountains that hem in the broad valley of Couesnon\r\nto the west and take various names according to their localities. The\r\ntown is separated from the mountains by a gorge, through which flows a\r\nsmall river called the Nancon. To the east, the view is the same as from\r\nthe summit of La Pelerine; to the west, the town looks down into the\r\ntortuous valley of the Nancon; but there is a spot from which a section\r\nof the great valley and the picturesque windings of the gorge can be\r\nseen at the same time. This place, chosen by the inhabitants of the town\r\nfor their Promenade, and to which the steps of Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nwere now turned, was destined to be the theatre on which the drama begun\r\nat La Vivetiere was to end. Therefore, however picturesque the other\r\nparts of Fougeres may be, attention must be particularly given to the\r\nscenery which meets the eye from this terrace.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the rock on which Fougeres stands, as seen on this\r\nside, we may compare it to one of those immense towers circled by\r\nSaracen architects with balconies on each story, which were reached by\r\nspiral stairways. To add to this effect, the rock is capped by a Gothic\r\nchurch, the small spires, clock-tower, and buttresses of which make its\r\nshape almost precisely that of a sugar-loaf. Before the portal of this\r\nchurch, which is dedicated to Saint-Leonard, is a small, irregular\r\nsquare, where the soil is held up by a buttressed wall, which forms a\r\nbalustrade and communicates by a flight of steps with the Promenade.\r\nThis public walk, like a second cornice, extends round the rock a few\r\nrods below the square of Saint-Leonard; it is a broad piece of ground\r\nplanted with trees, and it joins the fortifications of the town. About\r\nten rods below the walls and rocks which support this Promenade (due\r\nto a happy combination of indestructible slate and patient industry)\r\nanother circular road exists, called the "Queen\'s Staircase"; this is\r\ncut in the rock itself and leads to a bridge built across the Nancon by\r\nAnne of Brittany. Below this road, which forms a third cornice, gardens\r\ndescend, terrace after terrace, to the river, like shelves covered with\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nParallel with the Promenade, on the other side of the Nancon and\r\nacross its narrow valley, high rock-formations, called the heights of\r\nSaint-Sulpice, follow the stream and descend in gentle slopes to the\r\ngreat valley, where they turn abruptly to the north. Towards the south,\r\nwhere the town itself really ends and the faubourg Saint-Leonard begins,\r\nthe Fougeres rock makes a bend, becomes less steep, and turns into\r\nthe great valley, following the course of the river, which it hems in\r\nbetween itself and the heights of Saint-Sulpice, forming a sort of pass\r\nthrough which the water escapes in two streamlets to the Couesnon,\r\ninto which they fall. This pretty group of rocky hills is called the\r\n"Nid-aux-Crocs"; the little vale they surround is the "Val de Gibarry,"\r\nthe rich pastures of which supply the butter known to epicures as that\r\nof the "Pree-Valaye."\r\n\r\nAt the point where the Promenade joins the fortifications is a tower\r\ncalled the "Tour de Papegaut." Close to this square erection, against\r\nthe side of which the house now occupied by Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nrested, is a wall, partly built by hands and partly formed of the native\r\nrock where it offered a smooth surface. Here stands a gateway leading\r\nto the faubourg of Saint-Sulpice and bearing the same name. Above, on\r\na breastwork of granite which commands the three valleys, rise the\r\nbattlements and feudal towers of the ancient castle of Fougeres,--one\r\nof those enormous erections built by the Dukes of Brittany, with lofty\r\nwalls fifteen feet thick, protected on the east by a pond from which\r\nflows the Nancon, the waters of which fill its moats, and on the west by\r\nthe inaccessible granite rock on which it stands.\r\n\r\nSeen from the Promenade, this magnificent relic of the Middle Ages,\r\nwrapped in its ivy mantle, adorned with its square or rounded towers,\r\nin either of which a whole regiment could be quartered,--the castle, the\r\ntown, and the rock, protected by walls with sheer surfaces, or by\r\nthe glacis of the fortifications, form a huge horseshoe, lined with\r\nprecipices, on which the Bretons have, in course of ages, cut various\r\nnarrow footways. Here and there the rocks push out like architectural\r\nadornments. Streamlets issue from the fissures, where the roots of\r\nstunted trees are nourished. Farther on, a few rocky slopes, less\r\nperpendicular than the rest, afford a scanty pasture for the goats. On\r\nall sides heather, growing from every crevice, flings its rosy garlands\r\nover the dark, uneven surface of the ground. At the bottom of this vast\r\nfunnel the little river winds through meadows that are always cool and\r\ngreen, lying softly like a carpet.\r\n\r\nBeneath the castle and among the granite boulders is a church dedicated\r\nto Saint-Sulpice, whose name is given to the suburb which lies across\r\nthe Nancon. This suburb, flung as it were to the bottom of a precipice,\r\nand its church, the spire of which does not rise to the height of the\r\nrocks which threaten to crush it, are picturesquely watered by several\r\naffluents of the Nancon, shaded by trees and brightened by gardens. The\r\nwhole region of Fougeres, its suburbs, its churches, and the hills of\r\nSaint-Sulpice are surrounded by the heights of Rille, which form part of\r\na general range of mountains enclosing the broad valley of Couesnon.\r\n\r\nSuch are the chief features of this landscape, the principal\r\ncharacteristic of which is a rugged wildness softened by smiling\r\naccidents, by a happy blending of the finest works of men\'s hands\r\nwith the capricious lay of a land full of unexpected contrasts, by a\r\nsomething, hardly to be explained, which surprises, astonishes, and\r\npuzzles. In no other part of France can the traveller meet with such\r\ngrandiose contrasts as those offered by the great basin of the Couesnon,\r\nand the valleys hidden among the rocks of Fougeres and the heights of\r\nRille. Their beauty is of that unspeakable kind in which chance triumphs\r\nand all the harmonies of Nature do their part. The clear, limpid,\r\nflowing waters, the mountains clothed with the vigorous vegetation\r\nof those regions, the sombre rocks, the graceful buildings, the\r\nfortifications raised by nature, and the granite towers built by man;\r\ncombined with all the artifices of light and shade, with the contrasts\r\nof the varieties of foliage, with the groups of houses where an active\r\npopulation swarms, with the lonely barren places where the granite will\r\nnot suffer even the lichen to fasten on its surface, in short, with all\r\nthe ideas we ask a landscape to possess: grace and awfulness, poesy with\r\nits renascent magic, sublime pictures, delightful ruralities,--all these\r\nare here; it is Brittany in bloom.\r\n\r\nThe tower called the Papegaut, against which the house now occupied by\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil rested, has its base at the very bottom of the\r\nprecipice, and rises to the esplanade which forms the cornice or terrace\r\nbefore the church of Saint-Leonard. From Marie\'s house, which was open\r\non three sides, could be seen the horseshoe (which begins at the\r\ntower itself), the winding valley of the Nancon, and the square of\r\nSaint-Leonard. It is one of a group of wooden buildings standing\r\nparallel with the western side of the church, with which they form an\r\nalley-way, the farther end of which opens on a steep street skirting\r\nthe church and leading to the gate of Saint-Leonard, along which\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil now made her way.\r\n\r\nMarie naturally avoided entering the square of the church which was then\r\nabove her, and turned towards the Promenade. The magnificence of\r\nthe scene which met her eyes silenced for a moment the tumult of her\r\npassions. She admired the vast trend of the valley, which her eyes took\r\nin, from the summit of La Pelerine to the plateau where the main road to\r\nVitry passes; then her eyes rested on the Nid-aux-Crocs and the winding\r\ngorges of the Val de Gibarry, the crests of which were bathed in the\r\nmisty glow of the setting sun. She was almost frightened by the depth of\r\nthe valley of the Nancon, the tallest poplars of which scarcely reached\r\nto the level of the gardens below the Queen\'s Staircase. At this time of\r\nday the smoke from the houses in the suburbs and in the valleys made a\r\nvapor in the air, through which the various objects had a bluish tinge;\r\nthe brilliant colors of the day were beginning to fade; the firmament\r\ntook a pearly tone; the moon was casting its veil of light into the\r\nravine; all things tended to plunge the soul into reverie and bring back\r\nthe memory of those beloved.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the scene before her was powerless to hold Marie\'s thoughts.\r\nIn vain did the setting sun cast its gold-dust and its crimson sheets\r\nto the depths of the river and along the meadows and over the graceful\r\nbuildings strewn among the rocks; she stood immovable, gazing at the\r\nheights of the Mont Saint-Sulpice. The frantic hope which had led her\r\nto the Promenade was miraculously realized. Among the gorse and bracken\r\nwhich grew upon those heights she was certain that she recognized, in\r\nspite of the goatskins which they wore, a number of the guests at La\r\nVivetiere, and among them the Gars, whose every moment became vivid to\r\nher eyes in the softened light of the sinking sun. A few steps back\r\nof the ground of men she distinguished her enemy, Madame du Gua. For\r\na moment Marie fancied that she dreamed, but her rival\'s hatred soon\r\nproved to her that the dream was a living one. The attention she was\r\ngiving to the least little gesture of the marquis prevented her from\r\nobserving the care with which Madame du Gua aimed a musket at her. But\r\na shot which woke the echoes of the mountains, and a ball that whistled\r\npast her warned Mademoiselle de Verneuil of her rival\'s determination.\r\n"She sends me her card," thought Marie, smiling. Instantly a "Qui\r\nvive?" echoing from sentry to sentry, from the castle to the Porte\r\nSaint-Leonard, proved to the Chouans the alertness of the Blues,\r\ninasmuch as the least accessible of their ramparts was so well guarded.\r\n\r\n"It is she--and he," muttered Marie to herself.\r\n\r\nTo seek the marquis, follow his steps and overtake him, was a thought\r\nthat flashed like lightning through her mind. "I have no weapon!" she\r\ncried. She remembered that on leaving Paris she had flung into a\r\ntrunk an elegant dagger formerly belonging to a sultana, which she had\r\njestingly brought with her to the theatre of war, as some persons take\r\nnote-books in which to jot down their travelling ideas; she was less\r\nattracted by the prospect of shedding blood than by the pleasure of\r\nwearing a pretty weapon studded with precious stones, and playing with\r\na blade that was stainless. Three days earlier she had deeply regretted\r\nhaving put this dagger in a trunk, when to escape her enemies at La\r\nVivetiere she had thought for a moment of killing herself. She now\r\nreturned to the house, found the weapon, put it in her belt, wrapped a\r\nlarge shawl round her shoulders and a black lace scarf about her hair,\r\nand covered her head with one of those broad-brimmed hats distinctive\r\nof Chouans which belonged to a servant of the house. Then, with the\r\npresence of mind which excited passions often give, she took the glove\r\nwhich Marche-a-Terre had given her as a safeguard, and saying, in reply\r\nto Francine\'s terrible looks, "I would seek him in hell," she returned\r\nto the Promenade.\r\n\r\nThe Gars was still at the same place, but alone. By the direction of\r\nhis telescope he seemed to be examining with the careful attention of\r\na commander the various paths across the Nancon, the Queen\'s Staircase,\r\nand the road leading through the Porte Saint-Sulpice and round the\r\nchurch of that name, where it meets the high-road under range of the\r\nguns at the castle. Mademoiselle de Verneuil took one of the little\r\npaths made by goats and their keepers leading down from the Promenade,\r\nreached the Staircase, then the bottom of the ravine, crossed the Nancon\r\nand the suburb, and divining like a bird in the desert her right course\r\namong the dangerous precipices of the Mont Saint-Sulpice, she followed\r\na slippery track defined upon the granite, and in spite of the prickly\r\ngorse and reeds and loose stones which hindered her, she climbed the\r\nsteep ascent with an energy greater perhaps than that of a man,--the\r\nenergy momentarily possessed by a woman under the influence of passion.\r\n\r\nNight overtook her as she endeavored by the failing moonlight to make\r\nout the path the marquis must have taken; an obstinate quest without\r\nreward, for the dead silence about her was sufficient proof of the\r\nwithdrawal of the Chouans and their leader. This effort of passion\r\ncollapsed with the hope that inspired it. Finding herself alone, after\r\nnightfall, in a hostile country, she began to reflect; and Hulot\'s\r\nadvice, together with the recollection of Madame du Gua\'s attempt, made\r\nher tremble with fear. The stillness of the night, so deep in mountain\r\nregions, enabled her to hear the fall of every leaf even at a distance,\r\nand these slight sounds vibrated on the air as though to give a measure\r\nof the silence or the solitude. The wind was blowing across the heights\r\nand sweeping away the clouds with violence, producing an alternation\r\nof shadows and light, the effect of which increased her fears, and gave\r\nfantastic and terrifying semblances to the most harmless objects. She\r\nturned her eyes to the houses of Fougeres, where the domestic lights\r\nwere burning like so many earthly stars, and she presently saw\r\ndistinctly the tower of Papegaut. She was but a very short distance from\r\nher own house, but within that space was the ravine. She remembered the\r\ndeclivities by which she had come, and wondered if there were not more\r\nrisk in attempting to return to Fougeres than in following out the\r\npurpose which had brought her. She reflected that the marquis\'s glove\r\nwould surely protect her from the Chouans, and that Madame du Gua was\r\nthe only enemy to be really feared. With this idea in her mind, Marie\r\nclasped her dagger, and tried to find the way to a country house the\r\nroofs of which she had noticed as she climbed Saint-Sulpice; but she\r\nwalked slowly, for she suddenly became aware of the majestic solemnity\r\nwhich oppresses a solitary being in the night time in the midst of wild\r\nscenery, where lofty mountains nod their heads like assembled giants.\r\nThe rustle of her gown, caught by the brambles, made her tremble more\r\nthan once, and more than once she hastened her steps only to slacken\r\nthem again as she thought her last hour had come. Before long matters\r\nassumed an aspect which the boldest men could not have faced without\r\nalarm, and which threw Mademoiselle de Verneuil into the sort of\r\nterror that so affects the very springs of life that all things become\r\nexcessive, weakness as well as strength. The feeblest beings will then\r\ndo deeds of amazing power; the strongest go mad with fear.\r\n\r\nMarie heard at a short distance a number of strange sounds, distinct yet\r\nvague, indicative of confusion and tumult, fatiguing to the ear which\r\ntried to distinguish them. They came from the ground, which seemed to\r\ntremble beneath the feet of a multitude of marching men. A momentary\r\nclearness in the sky enabled her to perceive at a little distance long\r\nfiles of hideous figures waving like ears of corn and gliding like\r\nphantoms; but she scarcely saw them, for darkness fell again, like a\r\nblack curtain, and hid the fearful scene which seemed to her full of\r\nyellow, dazzling eyes. She turned hastily and ran to the top of a\r\nbank to escape meeting three of these horrible figures who were coming\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\n"Did you see it?" said one.\r\n\r\n"I felt a cold wind as it rushed past me," replied a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n"I smelt a damp and graveyard smell," said the third.\r\n\r\n"Was it white?" asked the first.\r\n\r\n"Why should only _he_ come back out of all those we left dead at La\r\nPelerine?" said the second.\r\n\r\n"Why indeed?" replied the third. "Why do the Sacre-Coeur men have the\r\npreference? Well, at any rate, I\'d rather die without confession than\r\nwander about as he does, without eating or drinking, and no blood in his\r\nbody or flesh on his bones."\r\n\r\n"Ah!"\r\n\r\nThis exclamation, or rather this fearful cry, issued from the group\r\nas the three Chouans pointed to the slender form and pallid face of\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, who fled away with terrified rapidity without\r\na sound.\r\n\r\n"Here he is!" "There he is!" "Where?" "There!" "He\'s gone!" "No!" "Yes!"\r\n"Can you see him?" These cries reverberated like the monotonous murmur\r\nof waves upon a shore.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil walked bravely in the direction of the house\r\nshe had seen, and soon came in sight of a number of persons, who all\r\nfled away at her approach with every sign of panic fear. She felt\r\nimpelled to advance by a mysterious power which coerced her; the\r\nlightness of her body, which seemed to herself inexplicable, was another\r\nsource of terror. These forms which rose in masses at her approach, as\r\nif from the ground on which she trod, uttered moans which were scarcely\r\nhuman. At last she reached, not without difficulty, a trampled garden,\r\nthe hedges and fences of which were broken down. Stopped by a sentry,\r\nshe showed the glove. The moon lighted her face, and the muzzle of the\r\ngun already pointed at her was dropped by the Chouan, who uttered a\r\nhoarse cry, which echoed through the place. She now saw large buildings,\r\nwhere a few lighted windows showed the rooms that were occupied, and\r\npresently reached the walls without further hindrance. Through the\r\nwindow into which she looked, she saw Madame du Gua and the leaders\r\nwho were convoked at La Vivetiere. Bewildered at the sight, also by\r\nthe conviction of her danger, she turned hastily to a little opening\r\nprotected by iron bars, and saw in a long vaulted hall the marquis,\r\nalone and gloomy, within six feet of her. The reflection of the fire,\r\nbefore which he was sitting in a clumsy chair, lighted his face with a\r\nvacillating ruddy glow that gave the character of a vision to the scene.\r\nMotionless and trembling, the girl stood clinging to the bars, to catch\r\nhis words if he spoke. Seeing him so depressed, disheartened, and pale,\r\nshe believed herself to be the cause of his sadness. Her anger changed\r\nto pity, her pity to tenderness, and she suddenly knew that it was not\r\nrevenge alone which had brought her there.\r\n\r\nThe marquis rose, turned his head, and stood amazed when he saw, as if\r\nin a cloud, Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s face; then he shook his head with\r\na gesture of impatience and contempt, exclaiming: "Must I forever see\r\nthe face of that devil, even when awake?"\r\n\r\nThis utter contempt for her forced a half-maddened laugh from the\r\nunhappy girl which made the young leader quiver. He sprang to the\r\nwindow, but Mademoiselle de Verneuil was gone. She heard the steps of a\r\nman behind her, which she supposed to be those of the marquis, and, to\r\nescape him, she knew no obstacles; she would have scaled walls and flown\r\nthrough air; she would have found and followed a path to hell sooner\r\nthan have seen again, in flaming letters on the forehead of that man, "I\r\ndespise you,"--words which an inward voice sounded in her soul with the\r\nnoise of a trumpet.\r\n\r\nAfter walking a short distance without knowing where she went, she\r\nstopped, conscious of a damp exhalation. Alarmed by the sound of voices,\r\nshe went down some steps which led into a cellar. As she reached the\r\nlast of them, she stopped to listen and discover the direction her\r\npursuers might take. Above the sounds from the outside, which were\r\nsomewhat loud, she could hear within the lugubrious moans of a human\r\nbeing, which added to her terror. Rays of light coming down the steps\r\nmade her fear that this retreat was only too well known to her enemies,\r\nand, to escape them, she summoned fresh energy. Some moments later,\r\nafter recovering her composure of mind, it was difficult for her to\r\nconceive by what means she had been able to climb a little wall, in a\r\nrecess of which she was now hidden. She took no notice at first of the\r\ncramped position in which she was, but before long the pain of it became\r\nintolerable, for she was bending double under the arched opening of\r\na vault, like the crouching Venus which ignorant persons attempt to\r\nsqueeze into too narrow a niche. The wall, which was rather thick and\r\nbuilt of granite, formed a low partition between the stairway and the\r\ncellar whence the groans were issuing. Presently she saw an individual,\r\nclothed in a goatskin, enter the cave beneath her, and move about,\r\nwithout making any sign of eager search. Impatient to discover if she\r\nhad any chance of safety, Mademoiselle de Verneuil waited with anxiety\r\ntill the light brought by the new-comer lighted the whole cave, where\r\nshe could partly distinguish a formless but living mass which was trying\r\nto reach a part of the wall, with violent and repeated jerks, something\r\nlike those of a carp lying out of water on a shore.\r\n\r\nA small pine torch threw its blue and hazy light into the cave. In\r\nspite of the gloomy poetic effects which Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s\r\nimagination cast about this vaulted chamber, which was echoing to the\r\nsounds of a pitiful prayer, she was obliged to admit that the place was\r\nnothing more than an underground kitchen, evidently long abandoned. When\r\nthe formless mass was distinguishable it proved to be a short and very\r\nfat man, whose limbs were carefully bound before he had been left lying\r\non the damp stone floor of the kitchen by those who had seized him. When\r\nhe saw the new-comer approach him with a torch in one hand and a fagot\r\nof sticks in the other, the captive gave a dreadful groan, which so\r\nwrought upon the sensibilities of Mademoiselle de Verneuil that she\r\nforgot her own terror and despair and the cramped position of her limbs,\r\nwhich were growing numb. But she made a great effort and remained\r\nstill. The Chouan flung the sticks into the fireplace, after trying the\r\nstrength of an old crane which was fastened to a long iron bar; then he\r\nset fire to the wood with his torch. Marie saw with terror that the man\r\nwas the same Pille-Miche to whom her rival had delivered her, and whose\r\nfigure, illuminated by the flame, was like that of the little boxwood\r\nmen so grotesquely carved in Germany. The moans of his prisoner produced\r\na broad grin upon features that were ribbed with wrinkles and tanned by\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n"You see," he said to his victim, "that we Christians keep our promises,\r\nwhich you don\'t. That fire is going to thaw out your legs and tongue and\r\nhands. Hey! hey! I don\'t see a dripping-pan to put under your feet; they\r\nare so fat the grease may put out the fire. Your house must be badly\r\nfurnished if it can\'t give its master all he wants to warm him."\r\n\r\nThe victim uttered a sharp cry, as if he hoped someone would hear him\r\nthrough the ceiling and come to his assistance.\r\n\r\n"Ho! sing away, Monsieur d\'Orgemont; they are all asleep upstairs, and\r\nMarche-a-Terre is just behind me; he\'ll shut the cellar door."\r\n\r\nWhile speaking Pille-Miche was sounding with the butt-end of his musket\r\nthe mantel-piece of the chimney, the tiles of the floor, the walls and\r\nthe ovens, to discover, if possible, where the miser hid his gold. This\r\nsearch was made with such adroitness that d\'Orgemont kept silence, as if\r\nhe feared to have been betrayed by some frightened servant; for, though\r\nhe trusted his secrets to no one, his habits gave plenty of ground for\r\nlogical deductions. Pille-Miche turned several times sharply to look\r\nat his victim, as children do when they try to guess, by the conscious\r\nexpression of the comrade who has hidden an article, whether they are\r\nnearer to or farther away from it. D\'Orgemont pretended to be alarmed\r\nwhen the Chouan tapped the ovens, which sounded hollow, and seemed to\r\nwish to play upon his eager credulity. Just then three other Chouans\r\nrushed down the steps and entered the kitchen. Seeing Marche-a-Terre\r\namong them Pille-Miche discontinued his search, after casting upon\r\nd\'Orgemont a look that conveyed the wrath of his balked covetousness.\r\n\r\n"Marie Lambrequin has come to life!" cried Marche-a-Terre, proclaiming\r\nby his manner that all other interests were of no account beside this\r\ngreat piece of news.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not surprised," said Pille-Miche, "he took the sacrament so often;\r\nthe good God belonged to him."\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha!" observed Mene-a-Bien, "that didn\'t stand him in anything\r\nat his death. He hadn\'t received absolution before the affair at La\r\nPelerine. He had cheapened Goguelu\'s daughter, and was living in mortal\r\nsin. The Abbe Gudin said he\'d have to roam round two months as a ghost\r\nbefore he could come to life. We saw him pass us,--he was pale, he was\r\ncold, he was thin, he smelt of the cemetery."\r\n\r\n"And his Reverence says that if a ghost gets hold of a living man he can\r\nforce him to be his companion," said the fourth Chouan.\r\n\r\nThe grotesque appearance of this last speaker drew Marche-a-Terre from\r\nthe pious reflections he had been making on the accomplishment of this\r\nmiracle of coming to life which, according to the Abbe Gudin would\r\nhappen to every true defender of religion and the king.\r\n\r\n"You see, Galope-Chopine," he said to the fourth man gravely, "what\r\ncomes of omitting even the smallest duty commanded by our holy religion.\r\nIt is a warning to us, given by Saint Anne of Auray, to be rigorous with\r\nourselves for the slightest sin. Your cousin Pille-Miche has asked the\r\nGars to give you the surveillance of Fougeres, and the Gars consents,\r\nand you\'ll be well paid--but you know with what flour we bake a\r\ntraitor\'s bread."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre."\r\n\r\n"And you know why I tell you that. Some say you like cider and gambling,\r\nbut you can\'t play heads or tails now, remember; you must belong to us\r\nonly, or--"\r\n\r\n"By your leave, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre, cider and stakes are two good\r\nthings which don\'t hinder a man\'s salvation."\r\n\r\n"If my cousin commits any folly," said Pille-Miche, "it will be out of\r\nignorance."\r\n\r\n"In any way he commits it, if harm comes," said Marche-a-Terre, in a\r\nvoice which made the arched roof tremble, "my gun won\'t miss him. You\r\nwill answer for him to me," he added, turning to Pille-Miche; "for if he\r\ndoes wrong I shall take it out on the thing that fills your goatskin."\r\n\r\n"But, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre, with all due respect," said\r\nGalope-Chopine, "haven\'t you sometimes taken a counterfeit Chouan for a\r\nreal one."\r\n\r\n"My friend," said Marche-a-Terre in a curt tone, "don\'t let that happen\r\nin your case, or I\'ll cut you in two like a turnip. As to the emissaries\r\nof the Gars, they all carry his glove, but since that affair at La\r\nVivetiere the Grande Garce has added a green ribbon to it."\r\n\r\nPille Miche nudged his comrade by the elbow and showed him d\'Orgemont,\r\nwho was pretending to be asleep; but Pille-Miche and Marche-a-Terre both\r\nknew by experience that no one ever slept by the corner of their fire,\r\nand though the last words said to Galope-Chopine were almost whispered,\r\nthey must have been heard by the victim, and the four Chouans looked at\r\nhim fixedly, thinking perhaps that fear had deprived him of his senses.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at a slight sign from Marche-a-Terre, Pille-Miche pulled off\r\nd\'Orgemont\'s shoes and stockings, Mene-a-Bien and Galope-Chopine seized\r\nhim round the body and carried him to the fire. Then Marche-a-Terre took\r\none of the thongs that tied the fagots and fastened the miser\'s feet to\r\nthe crane. These actions and the horrible celerity with which they were\r\ndone brought cries from the victim, which became heart-rending when\r\nPille-Miche gathered the burning sticks under his legs.\r\n\r\n"My friends, my good friends," screamed d\'Orgemont, "you hurt me, you\r\nkill me! I\'m a Christian like you."\r\n\r\n"You lie in your throat!" replied Marche-a-Terre. "Your brother denied\r\nGod; and as for you, you bought the abbey of Juvigny. The Abbe Gudin\r\nsays we can roast apostates when we find them."\r\n\r\n"But, my brothers in God, I don\'t refuse to pay."\r\n\r\n"We gave you two weeks, and it is now two months, and Galope-Chopine\r\nhere hasn\'t received the money."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you received any of it, Galope-Chopine?" asked the miser, in\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n"None of it, Monsieur d\'Orgemont," replied Galope-Chopine, frightened.\r\n\r\nThe cries, which had sunk into groans, continuous as the rattle in a\r\ndying throat, now began again with dreadful violence. Accustomed to\r\nsuch scenes, the four Chouans looked at d\'Orgemont, who was twisting and\r\nhowling, so coolly that they seemed like travellers watching before an\r\ninn fire till the roast meat was done enough to eat.\r\n\r\n"I\'m dying, I\'m dying!" cried the victim, "and you won\'t get my money."\r\n\r\nIn spite of these agonizing cries, Pille-Miche saw that the fire did not\r\nyet scorch the skin; he drew the sticks cleverly together so as to make\r\na slight flame. On this d\'Orgemont called out in a quavering voice: "My\r\nfriends, unbind me! How much do you want? A hundred crowns--a thousand\r\ncrowns--ten thousand crowns--a hundred thousand crowns--I offer you two\r\nhundred thousand crowns!"\r\n\r\nThe voice became so lamentable that Mademoiselle de Verneuil forgot her\r\nown danger and uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n"Who spoke?" asked Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\nThe Chouans looked about them with terrified eyes. These men, so brave\r\nin fight, were unable to face a ghost. Pille-Miche alone continued to\r\nlisten to the promises which the flames were now extracting from his\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n"Five hundred thousand crowns--yes, I\'ll give them," cried the victim.\r\n\r\n"Well, where are they?" answered Pille-Miche, tranquilly.\r\n\r\n"Under the first apple-tree--Holy Virgin! at the bottom of the garden to\r\nthe left--you are brigands--thieves! Ah! I\'m dying--there\'s ten thousand\r\nfrancs--"\r\n\r\n"Francs! we don\'t want francs," said Marche-a-Terre; "those Republican\r\ncoins have pagan figures which oughtn\'t to pass."\r\n\r\n"They are not francs, they are good louis d\'or. But oh! undo me, unbind\r\nme! I\'ve told you where my life is--my money."\r\n\r\nThe four Chouans looked at each other as if thinking which of their\r\nnumber they could trust sufficiently to disinter the money.\r\n\r\nThe cannibal cruelty of the scene so horrified Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nthat she could bear it no longer. Though doubtful whether the role\r\nof ghost, which her pale face and the Chouan superstitions evidently\r\nassigned to her, would carry her safely through the danger, she called\r\nout, courageously, "Do you not fear God\'s anger? Unbind him, brutes!"\r\n\r\nThe Chouans raised their heads and saw in the air above them two eyes\r\nwhich shone like stars, and they fled, terrified. Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil sprang into the kitchen, ran to d\'Orgemont, and pulled him so\r\nviolently from the crane that the thong broke. Then with the blade of\r\nher dagger she cut the cords which bound him. When the miser was free\r\nand on his feet, the first expression of his face was a painful but\r\nsardonic grin.\r\n\r\n"Apple-tree! yes, go to the apple-tree, you brigands," he said. "Ho, ho!\r\nthis is the second time I\'ve fooled them. They won\'t get a third chance\r\nat me."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he caught Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s hand, drew her under the\r\nmantel-shelf to the back of the hearth in a way to avoid disturbing the\r\nfire, which covered only a small part of it; then he touched a spring;\r\nthe iron back was lifted, and when their enemies returned to the kitchen\r\nthe heavy door of the hiding-place had already fallen noiselessly.\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil then understood the carp-like movements she had\r\nseen the miser making.\r\n\r\n"The ghost has taken the Blue with him," cried the voice of\r\nMarche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\nThe fright of the Chouans must have been great, for the words were\r\nfollowed by a stillness so profound that d\'Orgemont and his companion\r\ncould hear them muttering to themselves: "Ave, sancta Anna Auriaca\r\ngratia plena, Dominus tecum," etc.\r\n\r\n"They are praying, the fools!" cried d\'Orgemont.\r\n\r\n"Hush! are you not afraid they will discover us?" said Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil, checking her companion.\r\n\r\nThe old man\'s laugh dissipated her fears.\r\n\r\n"That iron back is set in a wall of granite two feet thick," he said.\r\n"We can hear them, but they can\'t hear us."\r\n\r\nThen he took the hand of his preserver and placed it near a crevice\r\nthrough which a current of fresh air was blowing. She then perceived\r\nthat the opening was made in the shaft of the chimney.\r\n\r\n"Ai! ai!" cried d\'Orgemont. "The devil! how my legs smart!"\r\n\r\nThe Chouans, having finished their prayer, departed, and the old miser\r\nagain caught the hand of his companion and helped her to climb some\r\nnarrow winding steps cut in the granite wall. When they had mounted some\r\ntwenty of these steps the gleam of a lamp dimly lighted their heads. The\r\nmiser stopped, turned to his companion, examined her face as if it were\r\na bank note he was doubtful about cashing, and heaved a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n"By bringing you here," he said, after a moment\'s silence, "I have paid\r\nyou in full for the service you did me; I don\'t see why I should give\r\nyou--"\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, I ask nothing of you," she said.\r\n\r\nThese words, and also, perhaps, the disdainful expression on the\r\nbeautiful face, reassured the old man, for he answered, not without a\r\nsigh, "Ah! if you take it that way, I have gone too far not to continue\r\non."\r\n\r\nHe politely assisted Marie to climb a few more steps rather strangely\r\nconstructed, and half willingly, half reluctantly, ushered her into a\r\nsmall closet about four feet square, lighted by a lamp hanging from\r\nthe ceiling. It was easy to see that the miser had made preparations to\r\nspend more than one day in this retreat if the events of the civil war\r\ncompelled him to hide himself.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t brush against that wall, you might whiten yourself," said\r\nd\'Orgemont suddenly, as he hurriedly put his hand between the girl\'s\r\nshawl and the stones which seemed to have been lately whitewashed. The\r\nold man\'s action produced quite another effect from that he intended.\r\nMarie looked about her and saw in one corner a sort of projection, the\r\nshape of which forced from her a cry of terror, for she fancied it\r\nwas that of a human being standing erect and mortared into the wall.\r\nD\'Orgemont made a violent sign to her to hold her tongue, and his little\r\neyes of a porcelain blue showed as much fear as those of his companion.\r\n\r\n"Fool! do you think I murdered him? It is the body of my brother," and\r\nthe old man gave a lugubrious sigh. "He was the first sworn-in priest;\r\nand this was the only asylum where he was safe against the fury of the\r\nChouans and the other priests. He was my elder brother, and he alone had\r\nthe patience to each me the decimal calculus. Oh! he was a good priest!\r\nHe was economical and laid by money. It is four years since he died; I\r\ndon\'t know what was the matter with him; perhaps it was that priests are\r\nso in the habit of kneeling down to pray that he couldn\'t get accustomed\r\nto standing upright here as I do. I walled him up there; _they\'d_ have\r\ndug him up elsewhere. Some day perhaps I can put him in holy ground, as\r\nhe used to call it,--poor man, he only took the oath out of fear."\r\n\r\nA tear rolled from the hard eyes of the little old man, whose rusty\r\nwig suddenly seemed less hideous to the girl, and she turned her eyes\r\nrespectfully away from his distress. But, in spite of these tender\r\nreminiscences, d\'Orgemont kept on saying, "Don\'t go near the wall, you\r\nmight--"\r\n\r\nHis eyes never ceased to watch hers, hoping thus to prevent her from\r\nexamining too closely the walls of the closet, where the close air\r\nwas scarcely enough to inflate the lungs. Marie succeeded, however, in\r\ngetting a sufficiently good look in spite of her Argus, and she came to\r\nthe conclusion that the strange protuberances in the walls were neither\r\nmore nor less than sacks of coin which the miser had placed there and\r\nplastered up.\r\n\r\nOld d\'Orgemont was now in a state of almost grotesque bewilderment.\r\nThe pain in his legs, the terror he felt at seeing a human being in the\r\nmidst of his hoards, could be read in every wrinkle of his face, and yet\r\nat the same time his eyes expressed, with unaccustomed fire, a lively\r\nemotion excited in him by the presence of his liberator, whose white\r\nand rosy cheek invited kisses, and whose velvety black eye sent waves of\r\nblood to his heart, so hot that he was much in doubt whether they were\r\nsigns of life or of death.\r\n\r\n"Are you married?" he asked, in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n"No," she said, smiling.\r\n\r\n"I have a little something," he continued, heaving a sigh, "though I\r\nam not so rich as people think for. A young girl like you must love\r\ndiamonds, trinkets, carriages, money. I\'ve got all that to give--after\r\nmy death. Hey! if you will--"\r\n\r\nThe old man\'s eyes were so shrewd and betrayed such calculation in this\r\nephemeral love that Mademoiselle de Verneuil, as she shook her head in\r\nsign of refusal, felt that his desire to marry her was solely to bury\r\nhis secret in another himself.\r\n\r\n"Money!" she said, with a look of scorn which made him satisfied and\r\nangry both; "money is nothing to me. You would be three times as rich\r\nas you are, if you had all the gold that I have refused--" she stopped\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go near that wall, or--"\r\n\r\n"But I hear a voice," she said; "it echoes through that wall,--a voice\r\nthat is more to me than all your riches."\r\n\r\nBefore the miser could stop her Marie had laid her hand on a small\r\ncolored engraving of Louis XV. on horseback; to her amazement it turned,\r\nand she saw, in a room beneath her, the Marquis de Montauran, who was\r\nloading a musket. The opening, hidden by a little panel on which the\r\npicture was gummed, seemed to form some opening in the ceiling of the\r\nadjoining chamber, which, no doubt, was the bedroom of the royalist\r\ngeneral. D\'Orgemont closed the opening with much precaution, and looked\r\nat the girl sternly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say a word if you love your life. You haven\'t thrown your\r\ngrappling-iron on a worthless building. Do you know that the Marquis\r\nde Montauran is worth more than one hundred thousand francs a year from\r\nlands which have not yet been confiscated? And I read in the Primidi\r\nde l\'Ille-et-Vilaine a decree of the Consuls putting an end to\r\nconfiscation. Ha! ha! you\'ll think the Gars a prettier fellow than ever,\r\nwon\'t you? Your eyes are shining like two new louis d\'or."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil\'s face was, indeed, keenly excited when she\r\nheard that well-known voice so near her. Since she had been standing\r\nthere, erect, in the midst as it were of a silver mine, the spring\r\nof her mind, held down by these strange events, recovered itself. She\r\nseemed to have formed some sinister resolution and to perceive a means\r\nof carrying it out.\r\n\r\n"There is no return from such contempt," she was saying to herself; "and\r\nif he cannot love me, I will kill him--no other woman shall have him."\r\n\r\n"No, abbe, no!" cried the young chief, in a loud voice which was heard\r\nthrough the panel, "it must be so."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur le marquis," replied the Abbe Gudin, haughtily; "you will\r\nscandalize all Brittany if you give that ball at Saint James. It is\r\npreaching, not dancing, which will rouse our villagers. Take guns, not\r\nfiddles."\r\n\r\n"Abbe, you have sense enough to know that it is not in a general\r\nassembly of our partisans that I can learn to know these people, or\r\njudge of what I may be able to undertake with them. A supper is better\r\nfor examining faces than all the spying in the world, of which, by the\r\nbye, I have a horror; they can be made to talk with glasses in their\r\nhand."\r\n\r\nMarie quivered, as she listened, and conceived the idea of going to the\r\nball and there avenging herself.\r\n\r\n"Do you take me for an idiot with your sermon against dancing?"\r\ncontinued Montauran. "Wouldn\'t you yourself dance a reed if it would\r\nrestore your order under its new name of Fathers of the Faith? Don\'t\r\nyou know that Bretons come away from the mass and go to dancing? Are you\r\naware that Messieurs Hyde de Neuville and d\'Andigne had a conference,\r\nfive days ago, with the First Consul, on the question of restoring his\r\nMajesty Louis XVIII.? Ah, monsieur, the princes are deceived as to the\r\ntrue state of France. The devotions which uphold them are solely those\r\nof rank. Abbe, if I have set my feet in blood, at least I will not go\r\ninto it to my middle without full knowledge of what I do. I am devoted\r\nto the king, but not to four hot-heads, not to a man crippled with debt\r\nlike Rifoel, not to \'chauffeurs,\' not to--"\r\n\r\n"Say frankly, monsieur, not to abbes who force contributions on the\r\nhighway to carry on the war," retorted the Abbe Gudin.\r\n\r\n"Why should I not say it?" replied the marquis, sharply; "and I\'ll say,\r\nfurther, that the great and heroic days of La Vendee are over."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur le marquis, we can perform miracles without you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, like that of Marie Lambrequin, whom I hear you have brought to\r\nlife," said the marquis, smiling. "Come, come, let us have no rancor,\r\nabbe. I know that you run all risks and would shoot a Blue as readily as\r\nyou say an _oremus_. God willing, I hope to make you assist with a mitre\r\non your head at the king\'s coronation."\r\n\r\nThis last remark must have had some magic power, for the click of a\r\nmusket was heard as the abbe exclaimed, "I have fifty cartridges in my\r\npocket, monsieur le marquis, and my life is the king\'s."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a debtor of mine," whispered the usurer to Marie. "I don\'t mean\r\nthe five or six hundred crowns he has borrowed, but a debt of blood\r\nwhich I hope to make him pay. He can never suffer as much evil as I wish\r\nhim, the damned Jesuit! He swore the death of my brother, and raised\r\nthe country against him. Why? Because the poor man was afraid of the new\r\nlaws." Then, after applying his ear to another part of his hiding-place,\r\nhe added, "They are all decamping, those brigands. I suppose they are\r\ngoing to do some other miracle elsewhere. I only hope they won\'t bid me\r\ngood-bye as they did the last time, by setting fire to my house."\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of about half an hour, during which time the usurer and\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil looked at each other as if they were studying a\r\npicture, the coarse, gruff voice of Galope-Chopine was heard saying, in\r\na muffled tone: "There\'s no longer any danger, Monsieur d\'Orgemont. But\r\nthis time, you must allow that I have earned my thirty crowns."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the miser to Marie, "swear to shut your eyes."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil placed one hand over her eyelids; but for\r\ngreater security d\'Orgemont blew out the lamp, took his liberator by\r\nthe hand, and helped her to make seven or eight steps along a difficult\r\npassage. At the end of some minutes he gently removed her hand, and\r\nshe found herself in the very room the Marquis de Montauran had just\r\nquitted, and which was, in fact, the miser\'s own bedroom.\r\n\r\n"My dear girl," said the old man, "you can safely go now. Don\'t look\r\nabout you that way. I dare say you have no money with you. Here are ten\r\ncrowns; they are a little shaved, but they\'ll pass. When you leave the\r\ngarden you will see a path that leads straight to the town, or, as they\r\nsay now, the district. But the Chouans will be at Fougeres, and it is\r\nto be presumed that you can\'t get back there at once. You may want some\r\nsafe place to hide in. Remember what I say to you, but don\'t make use of\r\nit unless in some great emergency. You will see on the road which leads\r\nto Nid-aux-Crocs through the Val de Gibarry, a farmhouse belonging to\r\nCibot--otherwise called Galope-Chopine. Go in, and say to his wife:\r\n\'Good-day, Becaniere,\' and Barbette will hide you. If Galope-Chopine\r\ndiscovers you he will either take you for the ghost, if it is dark,\r\nor ten crowns will master him if it is light. Adieu, our account is\r\nsquared. But if you choose," he added, waving his hand about him, "all\r\nthis is yours."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil gave the strange old man a look of thanks,\r\nand succeeded in extracting a sigh from him, expressing a variety of\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\n"You will of course return me my ten crowns; and please remark that I\r\nask no interest. You can pay them to my credit with Maitre Patrat,\r\nthe notary at Fougeres, who would draw our marriage contract if you\r\nconsented to be mine. Adieu."\r\n\r\n"Adieu," she said, smiling and waving her hand.\r\n\r\n"If you ever want money," he called after her, "I\'ll lend it to you at\r\nfive per cent; yes, only five--did I say five?--why, she\'s gone! That\r\ngirl looks to me like a good one; nevertheless, I\'ll change the secret\r\nopening of my chimney."\r\n\r\nThen he took a twelve-pound loaf and a ham, and returned to his\r\nhiding-place.\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAs Mademoiselle de Verneuil walked through the country she seemed to\r\nbreathe a new life. The freshness of the night revived her after the\r\nfiery experience of the last few hours. She tried to follow the path\r\nexplained to her by d\'Orgemont, but the darkness became so dense after\r\nthe moon had gone down that she was forced to walk hap-hazard, blindly.\r\nPresently the fear of falling down some precipice seized her and saved\r\nher life, for she stopped suddenly, fancying the ground would disappear\r\nbefore her if she made another step. A cool breeze lifting her hair, the\r\nmurmur of the river, and her instinct all combined to warn her that she\r\nwas probably on the verge of the Saint-Sulpice rocks. She slipped her\r\narm around a tree and waited for dawn with keen anxiety, for she heard\r\na noise of arms and horses and human voices; she was grateful to the\r\ndarkness which saved her from the Chouans, who were evidently, as the\r\nmiser had said, surrounding Fougeres.\r\n\r\nLike fires lit at night as signals of liberty, a few gleams, faintly\r\ncrimsoned, began to show upon the summits, while the bases of the\r\nmountains still retained the bluish tints which contrasted with the rosy\r\nclouds that were floating in the valley. Soon a ruby disk rose slowly\r\non the horizon and the skies greeted it; the varied landscape, the\r\nbell-tower of Saint-Leonard, the rocks, the meadows buried in shadow,\r\nall insensibly reappeared, and the trees on the summits were defined\r\nagainst the skies in the rising glow. The sun freed itself with a\r\ngraceful spring from the ribbons of flame and ochre and sapphire. Its\r\nvivid light took level lines from hill to hill and flowed into the\r\nvales. The dusk dispersed, day mastered Nature. A sharp breeze crisped\r\nthe air, the birds sang, life wakened everywhere. But the girl had\r\nhardly time to cast her eyes over the whole of this wondrous landscape\r\nbefore, by a phenomenon not infrequent in these cool regions, the mists\r\nspread themselves in sheets, filled the valleys, and rose to the tops\r\nof the mountains, burying the great valley beneath a mantle of snow.\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil fancied for a moment she saw a _mer de glace_,\r\nlike those of the Alps. Then the vaporous atmosphere rolled like\r\nthe waves of ocean, lifted impenetrable billows which softly swayed,\r\nundulated, and were violently whirled, catching from the sun\'s rays\r\na vivid rosy tint, and showing here and there in their depths the\r\ntransparencies of a lake of molten silver. Suddenly the north wind swept\r\nthis phantasmagoric scene and scattered the mists which laid a dew full\r\nof oxygen on the meadows.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil was now able to distinguish a dark mass of men\r\non the rocks of Fougeres. Seven or eight hundred Chouans were running\r\nlike ants through the suburb of Saint-Sulpice. The sleeping town would\r\ncertainly have been overpowered in spite of its fortifications and its\r\nold gray towers, if Hulot had not been alert. A battery, concealed on a\r\nheight at the farther end of the basin formed by the ramparts, replied\r\nto the first fire of the Chouans by taking them diagonally on the road\r\nto the castle. The balls swept the road. Then a company of Blues made\r\na sortie from the Saint-Sulpice gate, profited by the surprise of the\r\nroyalists to form in line upon the high-road, and poured a murderous\r\nfire upon them. The Chouans made no attempt to resist, seeing that the\r\nramparts of the castle were covered with soldiers, and that the guns of\r\nthe fortress sufficiently protected the Republican advance.\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, other Chouans, masters of the little valley of the\r\nNancon, had swarmed up the rocks and reached the Promenade, which was\r\nsoon covered with goatskins, giving it to Marie\'s eyes the appearance\r\nof a thatched roof, brown with age. At the same moment loud reports were\r\nheard from the part of the town which overlooks the valley of Couesnon.\r\nEvidently, Fougeres was attacked on all sides and completely surrounded.\r\nFlames rising on the western side of the rock showed that the Chouans\r\nwere setting fire to the suburbs; but these soon ceased, and a column of\r\nblack smoke which succeeded them showed that the fire was extinguished.\r\nBrown and white clouds again hid the scene from Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil, but they were clouds of smoke from the fire and powder, which\r\nthe wind dispersed. The Republican commander, as soon as he saw his\r\nfirst orders admirably executed, changed the direction of his battery\r\nso as to sweep, successively, the valley of the Nancon, the Queen\'s\r\nStaircase, and the base of the rock of Fougeres. Two guns posted at the\r\ngate of Saint-Leonard scattered the ant-hill of Chouans who had seized\r\nthat position, and the national guard of the town, rushing in haste to\r\nthe square before the Church, succeeded in dislodging the enemy. The\r\nfight lasted only half an hour, and cost the Blues a hundred men. The\r\nChouans, beaten on all sides, retreated under orders from the Gars,\r\nwhose bold attempt failed (although he did not know this) in consequence\r\nof the massacre at La Vivetiere, which had brought Hulot secretly and in\r\nall haste to Fougeres. The artillery had arrived only that evening, and\r\nthe news had not reached Montauran; otherwise, he would certainly\r\nhave abandoned an enterprise which, if it failed, could only have bad\r\nresults. As soon as he heard the guns the marquis knew it would be\r\nmadness to continue, out of mere pride, a surprise which had missed\r\nfire. Therefore, not to lose men uselessly, he sent at once to all\r\npoints of the attack, ordering an immediate retreat. The commandant,\r\nseeing his adversary on the rocks of Saint-Sulpice surrounded by a\r\ncouncil of men, endeavored to pour a volley upon him; but the spot was\r\ncleverly selected, and the young leader was out of danger in a moment.\r\nHulot now changed parts with his opponent and became the aggressor. At\r\nthe first sign of the Gars\' intention, the company stationed under the\r\nwalls of the castle were ordered to cut off the Chouans\' retreat by\r\nseizing the upper outlet of the valley of the Nancon.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding her desire for revenge, Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s\r\nsympathies were with the men commanded by her lover, and she turned\r\nhastily to see if the other end of the valley were clear for them; but\r\nthe Blues, conquerors no doubt on the opposite side of Fougeres, were\r\nreturning from the valley of Couesnon and taking possession of the\r\nNid-aux-Crocs and that portion of the Saint-Sulpice rocks which overhang\r\nthe lower end of the valley of the Nancon. The Chouans, thus hemmed in\r\nto the narrow fields of the gorge, seemed in danger of perishing to the\r\nlast man, so cleverly and sagaciously were the commandant\'s measures\r\ntaken. But Hulot\'s cannon were powerless at these two points; and here,\r\nthe town of Fougeres being quite safe, began one of those desperate\r\nstruggles which denoted the character of Chouan warfare.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil now comprehended the presence of the masses\r\nof men she had seen as she left the town, the meeting of the leaders at\r\nd\'Orgemont\'s house, and all the other events of the night, wondering\r\nhow she herself had escaped so many dangers. The attack, prompted\r\nby desperation, interested her so keenly that she stood motionless,\r\nwatching the living pictures as they presented themselves to her sight.\r\nPresently the struggle at the foot of the mountain had a deeper interest\r\nfor her. Seeing the Blues almost masters of the Chouans, the marquis and\r\nhis friends rushed into the valley of the Nancon to support their men.\r\nThe rocks were now covered with straggling groups of furious combatants\r\ndeciding the question of life or death on a ground and with weapons that\r\nwere more favorable to the Goatskins. Slowly this moving arena widened.\r\nThe Chouans, recovering themselves, gained the rocks, thanks to the\r\nshrubs and bushes which grew here and there among them. For a moment\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil felt alarmed as she saw, rather late, her\r\nenemies swarming over the summit and defending the dangerous paths by\r\nwhich alone she could descend. Every issue on the mountain was occupied\r\nby one or other of the two parties; afraid of encountering them she left\r\nthe tree behind which she had been sheltering, and began to run in\r\nthe direction of the farm which d\'Orgemont had mentioned to her. After\r\nrunning some time on the slope of Saint-Sulpice which overlooks the\r\nvalley of Couesnon she saw a cow-shed in the distance, and thought it\r\nmust belong to the house of Galope-Chopine, who had doubtless left his\r\nwife at home and alone during the fight. Mademoiselle de Verneuil hoped\r\nto be able to pass a few hours in this retreat until it was possible for\r\nher to return to Fougeres without danger. According to all appearance\r\nHulot was to triumph. The Chouans were retreating so rapidly that she\r\nheard firing all about her, and the fear of being shot made her hasten\r\nto the cottage, the chimney of which was her landmark. The path she was\r\nfollowing ended at a sort of shed covered with a furze-roof, supported\r\nby four stout trees with the bark still on them. A mud wall formed the\r\nback of this shed, under which were a cider-mill, a flail to thresh\r\nbuckwheat, and several agricultural implements. She stopped before one\r\nof the posts, unwilling to cross the dirty bog which formed a sort of\r\ncourtyard to the house which, in her Parisian ignorance, she had taken\r\nfor a stable.\r\n\r\nThe cabin, protected from the north wind by an eminence towering above\r\nthe roof, which rested against it, was not without a poetry of its\r\nown; for the tender shoots of elms, heather, and various rock-flowers\r\nwreathed it with garlands. A rustic staircase, constructed between the\r\nshed and the house, enabled the inhabitants to go to the top of the rock\r\nand breathe a purer air. On the left, the eminence sloped abruptly down,\r\ngiving to view a series of fields, the first of which belonged no doubt\r\nto this farm. These fields were like bowers, separated by banks which\r\nwere planted with trees. The road which led to them was barred by the\r\ntrunk of an old, half-rotten tree,--a Breton method of enclosure the\r\nname of which may furnish, further on, a digression which will complete\r\nthe characterization of this region. Between the stairway cut in the\r\nschist rock and the path closed by this old tree, in front of the marsh\r\nand beneath the overhanging rock, several granite blocks roughly hewn,\r\nand piled one upon the other, formed the four corners of the cottage and\r\nheld up the planks, cobblestones, and pitch amalgam of which the walls\r\nwere made. The fact that one half of the roof was covered with furze\r\ninstead of thatch, and the other with shingles or bits of board cut into\r\nthe form of slates, showed that the building was in two parts; one half,\r\nwith a broken hurdle for a door, served as a stable, the other half was\r\nthe dwelling of the owner. Though this hut owed to the neighborhood of\r\nthe town a few improvements which were wholly absent from such buildings\r\nthat were five or six miles further off, it showed plainly enough the\r\ninstability of domestic life and habits to which the wars and customs of\r\nfeudality had reduced the serf; even to this day many of the peasants of\r\nthose parts call a seignorial chateau, "The Dwelling."\r\n\r\nWhile examining the place, with an astonishment we can readily conceive,\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil noticed here and there in the filth of the\r\ncourtyard a few bits of granite so placed as to form stepping-stones\r\nto the house. Hearing the sound of musketry that was evidently coming\r\nnearer, she jumped from stone to stone, as if crossing a rivulet, to ask\r\nshelter. The house was closed by a door opening in two parts; the lower\r\none of wood, heavy and massive, the upper one a shutter which served as\r\na window. In many of the smaller towns of France the shops have the\r\nsame type of door though far more decorated, the lower half possessing a\r\ncall-bell. The door in question opened with a wooden latch worthy of the\r\ngolden age, and the upper part was never closed except at night, for it\r\nwas the only opening through which daylight could enter the room. There\r\nwas, to be sure, a clumsy window, but the glass was thick like the\r\nbottom of a bottle, and the lead which held the panes in place took so\r\nmuch room that the opening seemed intended to intercept the light\r\nrather than admit it. As soon as Mademoiselle de Verneuil had turned the\r\ncreaking hinges of the lower door she smelt an intolerable ammoniacal\r\nodor, and saw that the beasts in the stable had kicked through the inner\r\npartition which separated the stable from the dwelling. The interior of\r\nthe farmhouse, for such it was, did not belie its exterior.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil was asking herself how it was possible for\r\nhuman beings to live in such habitual filth, when a ragged boy about\r\neight or nine years old suddenly presented his fresh and rosy face, with\r\na pair of fat cheeks, lively eyes, ivory teeth, and a mass of fair\r\nhair, which fell in curls upon his half-naked shoulders. His limbs were\r\nvigorous, and his attitude had the charm of that amazement and naive\r\ncuriosity which widens a child\'s eyes. The little fellow was a picture\r\nof beauty.\r\n\r\n"Where is your mother?" said Marie, in a gentle voice, stooping to kiss\r\nhim between the eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving her kiss the child slipped away like an eel, and\r\ndisappeared behind a muck-heap which was piled at the top of a mound\r\nbetween the path and the house; for, like many Breton farmers who have\r\na system of agriculture that is all their own, Galope-Chopine put his\r\nmanure in an elevated spot, so that by the time it was wanted for use\r\nthe rains had deprived it of all its virtue. Alone for a few minutes,\r\nMarie had time to make an inventory. The room in which she waited for\r\nBarbette was the whole house. The most obvious and sumptuous object was\r\na vast fireplace with a _mantle_-shelf of blue granite. The etymology of\r\nthat word was shown by a strip of green serge, edged with a pale-green\r\nribbon, cut in scallops, which covered and overhung the whole shelf, on\r\nwhich stood a colored plaster cast of the Holy Virgin. On the pedestal\r\nof the statuette were two lines of a religious poem very popular in\r\nBrittany:--\r\n\r\n  "I am the mother of God,\r\n  Protectress of the sod."\r\n\r\nBehind the Virgin a hideous image, daubed with red and blue under\r\npretence of painting, represented Saint-Labre. A green serge bed of the\r\nshape called "tomb," a clumsy cradle, a spinning-wheel, common chairs,\r\nand a carved chest on which lay utensils, were about the whole of\r\nGalope-Chopine\'s domestic possessions. In front of the window stood a\r\nchestnut table flanked by two benches of the same wood, to which the\r\nsombre light coming through the thick panes gave the tone of mahogany.\r\nAn immense cask of cider, under the bung of which Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil noticed a pool of yellow mud, which had decomposed the\r\nflooring, although it was made of scraps of granite conglomerated in\r\nclay, proved that the master of the house had a right to his Chouan\r\nname, and that the pints galloped down either his own throat or that of\r\nhis friends. Two enormous jugs full of cider stood on the table. Marie\'s\r\nattention, caught at first by the innumerable spider\'s-webs which hung\r\nfrom the roof, was fixing itself on these pitchers when the noise\r\nof fighting, growing more and more distinct, impelled her to find a\r\nhiding-place, without waiting for the woman of the house, who, however,\r\nappeared at that moment.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Becaniere," said Marie, restraining a smile at the\r\nappearance of a person who bore some resemblance to the heads which\r\narchitects attach to window-casings.\r\n\r\n"Ha! you come from d\'Orgemont?" answered Barbette, in a tone that was\r\nfar from cordial.\r\n\r\n"Yes, where can you hide me? for the Chouans are close by--"\r\n\r\n"There," replied Barbette, as much amazed at the beauty as by the\r\nstrange apparel of a being she could hardly believe to be of her own\r\nsex,--"there, in the priest\'s hiding-place."\r\n\r\nShe took her to the head of the bed, and was putting her behind it,\r\nwhen they were both startled by the noise of a man springing into the\r\ncourtyard. Barbette had scarcely time to drop the curtain of the bed\r\nand fold it about the girl before she was face to face with a fugitive\r\nChouan.\r\n\r\n"Where can I hide, old woman? I am the Comte de Bauvan," said the\r\nnew-comer.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil quivered as she recognized the voice of the\r\nbelated guest, whose words, still a secret to her, brought about the\r\ncatastrophe of La Vivetiere.\r\n\r\n"Alas! monseigneur, don\'t you see, I have no place? What I\'d better do\r\nis to keep outside and watch that no one gets in. If the Blues come,\r\nI\'ll let you know. If I stay here, and they find me with you, they\'ll\r\nburn my house down."\r\n\r\nBarbette left the hut, feeling herself incapable of settling the\r\ninterests of two enemies who, in virtue of the double role her husband\r\nwas playing, had an equal right to her hiding-place.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve only two shots left," said the count, in despair. "It will be very\r\nunlucky if those fellows turn back now and take a fancy to look under\r\nthis bed."\r\n\r\nHe placed his gun gently against the headboard behind which Marie was\r\nstanding among the folds of the green serge, and stooped to see if there\r\nwas room for him under the bed. He would infallibly have seen her\r\nfeet, but she, rendered desperate by her danger, seized his gun, jumped\r\nquickly into the room, and threatened him. The count broke into a peal\r\nof laughter when he caught sight of her, for, in order to hide herself,\r\nMarie had taken off her broad-brimmed Chouan hat, and her hair was\r\nescaping, in heavy curls, from the lace scarf which she had worn on\r\nleaving home.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t laugh, monsieur le comte; you are my prisoner. If you make the\r\nleast movement, you shall know what an offended woman is capable of\r\ndoing."\r\n\r\nAs the count and Marie stood looking at each other with differing\r\nemotions, confused voices were heard without among the rocks, calling\r\nout, "Save the Gars! spread out, spread out, save the Gars!"\r\n\r\nBarbette\'s voice, calling to her boy, was heard above the tumult with\r\nvery different sensations by the two enemies, to whom Barbette was\r\nreally speaking instead of to her son.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see the Blues?" she cried sharply. "Come here, you little\r\nscamp, or I shall be after you. Do you want to be shot? Come, hide,\r\nquick!"\r\n\r\nWhile these things took place rapidly a Blue jumped into the marshy\r\ncourtyard.\r\n\r\n"Beau-Pied!" exclaimed Mademoiselle de Verneuil.\r\n\r\nBeau-Pied, hearing her voice, rushed into the cottage, and aimed at the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n"Aristocrat!" he cried, "don\'t stir, or I\'ll demolish you in a wink,\r\nlike the Bastille."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Beau-Pied," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, in a persuasive\r\nvoice, "you will be answerable to me for this prisoner. Do as you like\r\nwith him now, but you must return him to me safe and sound at Fougeres."\r\n\r\n"Enough, madame!"\r\n\r\n"Is the road to Fougeres clear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s safe enough--unless the Chouans come to life."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil picked up the count\'s gun gaily, and smiled\r\nsatirically as she said to her prisoner, "Adieu, monsieur le comte, au\r\nrevoir!"\r\n\r\nThen she darted down the path, having replaced the broad hat upon her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"I have learned too late," said the count, "not to joke about the virtue\r\nof a woman who has none."\r\n\r\n"Aristocrat!" cried Beau-Pied, sternly, "if you don\'t want me to send\r\nyou to your _ci-devant_ paradise, you will not say a word against that\r\nbeautiful lady."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil returned to Fougeres by the paths which connect\r\nthe rocks of Saint-Sulpice with the Nid-aux-Crocs. When she reached the\r\nlatter height and had threaded the winding way cut in its rough granite,\r\nshe stopped to admire the pretty valley of the Nancon, lately so\r\nturbulent and now so tranquil. Seen from that point, the vale was like\r\na street of verdure. Mademoiselle de Verneuil re-entered the town by the\r\nPorte Saint-Leonard. The inhabitants, still uneasy about the fighting,\r\nwhich, judging by the distant firing, was still going on, were waiting\r\nthe return of the National Guard, to judge of their losses. Seeing the\r\ngirl in her strange costume, her hair dishevelled, a gun in her hand,\r\nher shawl and gown whitened against the walls, soiled with mud and wet\r\nwith dew, the curiosity of the people was keenly excited,--all the more\r\nbecause the power, beauty, and singularity of this young Parisian had\r\nbeen the subject of much discussion.\r\n\r\nFrancine, full of dreadful fears, had waited for her mistress throughout\r\nthe night, and when she saw her she began to speak; but Marie, with a\r\nkindly gesture, silenced her.\r\n\r\n"I am not dead, my child," she said. "Ah!" she added, after a pause, "I\r\nwanted emotions when I left Paris, and I have had them!"\r\n\r\nFrancine asked if she should get her some food, observing that she must\r\nbe in great need of it.\r\n\r\n"No, no; a bath, a bath!" cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil. "I must dress\r\nat once."\r\n\r\nFrancine was not a little surprised when her mistress required her to\r\nunpack the most elegant of the dresses she had brought with her. Having\r\nbathed and breakfasted, Marie made her toilet with all the minute care\r\nwhich a woman gives to that important act when she expects to meet the\r\neyes of her lover in a ball-room. Francine could not explain to herself\r\nthe mocking gaiety of her mistress. It was not the joy of love,--a\r\nwoman never mistakes that; it was rather an expression of concentrated\r\nmaliciousness, which to Francine\'s mind boded evil. Marie herself drew\r\nthe curtains of the window from which the glorious panorama could be\r\nseen, then she moved the sofa to the chimney corner, turning it so that\r\nthe light would fall becomingly on her face; then she told Francine to\r\nfetch flowers, that the room might have a festive air; and when they\r\ncame she herself directed their arrangement in a picturesque manner.\r\nGiving a last glance of satisfaction at these various preparations she\r\nsent Francine to the commandant with a request that he would bring her\r\nprisoner to her; then she lay down luxuriously on a sofa, partly to\r\nrest, and partly to throw herself into an attitude of graceful weakness,\r\nthe power of which is irresistible in certain women. A soft languor, the\r\nseductive pose of her feet just seen below the drapery of her gown,\r\nthe plastic ease of her body, the curving of the throat,--all, even the\r\ndroop of her slender fingers as they hung from the pillow like the buds\r\nof a bunch of jasmine, combined with her eyes to produce seduction. She\r\nburned certain perfumes to fill the air with those subtle emanations\r\nwhich affect men\'s fibres powerfully, and often prepare the way for\r\nconquests which women seek to make without seeming to desire them.\r\nPresently the heavy step of the old soldier resounded in the adjoining\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Well, commandant, where is my captive?" she said.\r\n\r\n"I have just ordered a picket of twelve men to shoot him, being taken\r\nwith arms in his hand."\r\n\r\n"Why have you disposed of my prisoner?" she asked. "Listen to me,\r\ncommandant; surely, if I can trust your face, the death of a man _after_\r\na fight is no particular satisfaction to you. Well, then, give my Chouan\r\na reprieve, for which I will be responsible, and let me see him. I\r\nassure you that aristocrat has become essential to me, and he can be\r\nmade to further the success of our plans. Besides, to shoot a mere\r\namateur in Chouannerie would be as absurd as to fire on a balloon when\r\na pinprick would disinflate it. For heaven\'s sake leave cruelty to the\r\naristocracy. Republicans ought to be generous. Wouldn\'t you and yours\r\nhave forgiven the victims of Quiberon? Come, send your twelve men to\r\npatrol the town, and dine with me and bring the prisoner. There is only\r\nan hour of daylight left, and don\'t you see," she added smiling, "that\r\nif you are too late, my toilet will have lost its effect?"\r\n\r\n"But, mademoiselle," said the commandant, amazed.\r\n\r\n"Well, what? But I know what you mean. Don\'t be anxious; the count shall\r\nnot escape. Sooner or later that big butterfly will burn himself in your\r\nfire."\r\n\r\nThe commandant shrugged his shoulders slightly, with the air of a man\r\nwho is forced to obey, whether he will or no, the commands of a pretty\r\nwoman; and he returned in about half an hour, followed by the Comte de\r\nBauvan.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil feigned surprise and seemed confused that the\r\ncount should see her in such a negligent attitude; then, after reading\r\nin his eyes that her first effect was produced, she rose and busied\r\nherself about her guests with well-bred courtesy. There was nothing\r\nstudied or forced in her motions, smiles, behavior, or voice, nothing\r\nthat betrayed premeditation or purpose. All was harmonious; no part was\r\nover-acted; an observer could not have supposed that she affected the\r\nmanners of a society in which she had not lived. When the Royalist and\r\nthe Republic were seated she looked sternly at the count. He, on his\r\npart, knew women sufficiently well to feel certain that the offence he\r\nhad committed against this woman was equivalent to a sentence of death.\r\nBut in spite of this conviction, and without seeming either gay or\r\ngloomy, he had the air of a man who did not take such serious results\r\ninto consideration; in fact, he really thought it ridiculous to fear\r\ndeath in presence of a pretty woman. Marie\'s stern manner roused ideas\r\nin his mind.\r\n\r\n"Who knows," thought he, "whether a count\'s coronet wouldn\'t please her\r\nas well as that of her lost marquis? Montauran is as lean as a nail,\r\nwhile I--" and he looked himself over with an air of satisfaction. "At\r\nany rate I should save my head."\r\n\r\nThese diplomatic revelations were wasted. The passion the count proposed\r\nto feign for Mademoiselle de Verneuil became a violent caprice, which\r\nthe dangerous creature did her best to heighten.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur le comte," she said, "you are my prisoner, and I have the\r\nright to dispose of you. Your execution cannot take place without\r\nmy consent, and I have too much curiosity to let them shoot you at\r\npresent."\r\n\r\n"And suppose I am obstinate enough to keep silence?" he replied gaily.\r\n\r\n"With an honest woman, perhaps, but with a woman of the town, no, no,\r\nmonsieur le comte, impossible!" These words, full of bitter sarcasm,\r\nwere hissed, as Sully says, in speaking of the Duchesse de Beaufort,\r\nfrom so sharp a beak that the count, amazed, merely looked at his\r\nantagonist. "But," she continued, with a scornful glance, "not to\r\ncontradict you, if I am a creature of that kind I will act like one.\r\nHere is your gun," and she offered him his weapon with a mocking air.\r\n\r\n"On the honor of a gentleman, mademoiselle--"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she said, interrupting him, "I have had enough of the honor of\r\ngentlemen. It was on the faith of that that I went to La Vivetiere. Your\r\nleader had sworn to me that I and my escort should be safe there."\r\n\r\n"What an infamy!" cried Hulot, contracting his brows.\r\n\r\n"The fault lies with monsieur le comte," said Marie, addressing Hulot.\r\n"I have no doubt the Gars meant to keep his word, but this gentleman\r\ntold some calumny about me which confirmed those that Charette\'s\r\nmistress had already invented--"\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," said the count, much troubled, "with my head under the\r\naxe I would swear that I said nothing but the truth."\r\n\r\n"In saying what?"\r\n\r\n"That you were the--"\r\n\r\n"Say the word, mistress of--"\r\n\r\n"The Marquis de Lenoncourt, the present duke, a friend of mine," replied\r\nthe count.\r\n\r\n"Now I can let you go to execution," she said, without seeming at all\r\nagitated by the outspoken reply of the count, who was amazed at the real\r\nor pretended indifference with which she heard his statement. "However,"\r\nshe added, laughing, "you have not wronged me more than that friend of\r\nwhom you suppose me to have been the--Fie! monsieur le comte; surely you\r\nused to visit my father, the Duc de Verneuil? Yes? well then--"\r\n\r\nEvidently considering Hulot one too many for the confidence she was\r\nabout to make, Mademoiselle de Verneuil motioned the count to her\r\nside, and said a few words in her ear. Monsieur de Bauvan gave a low\r\nejaculation of surprise and looked with bewilderment at Marie, who\r\ncompleted the effect of her words by leaning against the chimney in the\r\nartless and innocent attitude of a child.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," cried the count, "I entreat your forgiveness, unworthy\r\nas I am of it."\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to forgive," she replied. "You have no more ground for\r\nrepentance than you had for the insolent supposition you proclaimed\r\nat La Vivetiere. But this is a matter beyond your comprehension. Only,\r\nremember this, monsieur le comte, the daughter of the Duc de Verneuil\r\nhas too generous a spirit not to take a lively interest in your fate."\r\n\r\n"Even after I have insulted you?" said the count, with a sort of regret.\r\n\r\n"Some are placed so high that insult cannot touch them. Monsieur le\r\ncomte,--I am one of them."\r\n\r\nAs she said the words, the girl assumed an air of pride and nobility\r\nwhich impressed the prisoner and made the whole of this strange intrigue\r\nmuch less clear to Hulot than the old soldier had thought it. He twirled\r\nhis moustache and looked uneasily at Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who made\r\nhim a sign, as if to say she was still carrying out her plan.\r\n\r\n"Now," continued Marie, after a pause, "let us discuss these matters.\r\nFrancine, my dear, bring lights."\r\n\r\nShe adroitly led the conversation to the times which had now, within\r\na few short years, become the "ancien regime." She brought back\r\nthat period to the count\'s mind by the liveliness of her remarks and\r\nsketches, and gave him so many opportunities to display his wit, by\r\ncleverly throwing repartees in his way, that he ended by thinking he\r\nhad never been so charming; and that idea having rejuvenated him, he\r\nendeavored to inspire this seductive young woman with his own good\r\nopinion of himself. The malicious creature practised, in return, every\r\nart of her coquetry upon him, all the more adroitly because it was mere\r\nplay to her. Sometimes she let him think he was making rapid progress,\r\nand then, as if surprised at the sentiment she was feeling, she showed a\r\nsudden coolness which charmed him, and served to increase imperceptibly\r\nhis impromptu passion. She was like a fisherman who lifts his line\r\nfrom time to time to see if the fish is biting. The poor count allowed\r\nhimself to be deceived by the innocent air with which she accepted two\r\nor three neatly turned compliments. Emigration, Brittany, the Republic,\r\nand the Chouans were far indeed from his thoughts. Hulot sat erect\r\nand silent as the god Thermes. His want of education made him quite\r\nincapable of taking part in a conversation of this kind; he supposed\r\nthat the talking pair were very witty, but his efforts at comprehension\r\nwere limited to discovering whether they were plotting against the\r\nRepublic in covert language.\r\n\r\n"Montauran," the count was saying, "has birth and breeding, he is a\r\ncharming fellow, but he doesn\'t understand gallantry. He is too young\r\nto have seen Versailles. His education is deficient. Instead of\r\ndiplomatically defaming, he strikes a blow. He may be able to love\r\nviolently, but he will never have that fine flower of breeding in his\r\ngallantry which distinguished Lauzun, Adhemar, Coigny, and so many\r\nothers! He hasn\'t the winning art of saying those pretty nothings to\r\nwomen which, after all, they like better than bursts of passion, which\r\nsoon weary them. Yes, though he has undoubtedly had many love-affairs,\r\nhe has neither the grace nor the ease that should belong to them."\r\n\r\n"I have noticed that myself," said Marie.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" thought the count, "there\'s an inflection in her voice, and a look\r\nin her eye which shows me plainly I shall soon be _on terms_ with her;\r\nand faith! to get her, I\'ll believe all she wants me to."\r\n\r\nHe offered her his hand, for dinner was now announced. Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil did the honors with a politeness and tact which could only have\r\nbeen acquired by the life and training of a court.\r\n\r\n"Leave us," she whispered to Hulot as they left the table. "You will\r\nonly frighten him; whereas, if I am alone with him I shall soon find\r\nout all I want to know; he has reached the point where a man tells me\r\neverything he thinks, and sees through my eyes only."\r\n\r\n"But afterwards?" said Hulot, evidently intending to claim the prisoner.\r\n\r\n"Afterwards, he is to be free--free as air," she replied.\r\n\r\n"But he was taken with arms in his hand."\r\n\r\n"No," she said, making one of those sophistical jokes with which women\r\nparry unanswerable arguments, "I had disarmed him. Count," she said,\r\nturning back to him as Hulot departed, "I have just obtained your\r\nliberty, but--nothing for nothing," she added, laughing, with her head\r\non one side as if to interrogate him.\r\n\r\n"Ask all, even my name and my honor," he cried, intoxicated. "I lay them\r\nat your feet."\r\n\r\nHe advanced to seize her hand, trying to make her take his passion\r\nfor gratitude; but Mademoiselle de Verneuil was not a woman to be thus\r\nmisled. So, smiling in a way to give some hope to this new lover,\r\nshe drew back a few steps and said: "You might make me regret my\r\nconfidence."\r\n\r\n"The imagination of a young girl is more rapid than that of a woman," he\r\nanswered, laughing.\r\n\r\n"A young girl has more to lose than a woman."\r\n\r\n"True; those who carry a treasure ought to be distrustful."\r\n\r\n"Let us quit such conventional language," she said, "and talk seriously.\r\nYou are to give a ball at Saint-James. I hear that your headquarters,\r\narsenals, and base of supplies are there. When is the ball to be?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow evening."\r\n\r\n"You will not be surprised if a slandered woman desires, with a woman\'s\r\nobstinacy, to obtain a public reparation for the insults offered to her,\r\nin presence of those who witnessed them. I shall go to your ball. I ask\r\nyou to give me your protection from the moment I enter the room until I\r\nleave it. I ask nothing more than a promise," she added, as he laid his\r\nhand on his heart. "I abhor oaths; they are too like precautions. Tell\r\nme only that you engage to protect my person from all dangers,\r\ncriminal or shameful. Promise to repair the wrong you did me, by openly\r\nacknowledging that I am the daughter of the Duc de Verneuil; but say\r\nnothing of the trials I have borne in being illegitimate,--this will pay\r\nyour debt to me. Ha! two hours\' attendance on a woman in a ball-room\r\nis not so dear a ransom for your life, is it? You are not worth a ducat\r\nmore." Her smile took the insult from her words.\r\n\r\n"What do you ask for the gun?" said the count, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Oh! more than I do for you."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Secrecy. Believe me, my dear count, a woman is never fathomed except\r\nby a woman. I am certain that if you say one word of this, I shall be\r\nmurdered on my way to that ball. Yesterday I had warning enough. Yes,\r\nthat woman is quick to act. Ah! I implore you," she said, "contrive that\r\nno harm shall come to me at the ball."\r\n\r\n"You will be there under my protection," said the count, proudly.\r\n"But," he added, with a doubtful air, "are you coming for the sake of\r\nMontauran?"\r\n\r\n"You wish to know more than I know myself," she answered, laughing. "Now\r\ngo," she added, after a pause. "I will take you to the gate of the town\r\nmyself, for this seems to me a cannibal warfare."\r\n\r\n"Then you do feel some interest in me?" exclaimed the count. "Ah!\r\nmademoiselle, permit me to hope that you will not be insensible to my\r\nfriendship--for that sentiment must content me, must it not?" he added\r\nwith a conceited air.\r\n\r\n"Ah! diviner!" she said, putting on the gay expression a woman assumes\r\nwhen she makes an avowal which compromises neither her dignity nor her\r\nsecret sentiments.\r\n\r\nThen, having slipped on a pelisse, she accompanied him as far as\r\nthe Nid-aux-Crocs. When they reached the end of the path she said,\r\n"Monsieur, be absolutely silent on all this; even to the marquis"; and\r\nshe laid her finger on both lips.\r\n\r\nThe count, emboldened by so much kindness, took her hand; she let him do\r\nso as though it were a great favor, and he kissed it tenderly.\r\n\r\n"Oh! mademoiselle," he cried, on knowing himself beyond all danger,\r\n"rely on me for life, for death. Though I owe you a gratitude equal to\r\nthat I owe my mother, it will be very difficult to restrain my feelings\r\nto mere respect."\r\n\r\nHe sprang into the narrow pathway. After watching him till he\r\nreached the rocks of Saint-Sulpice, Marie nodded her head in sign of\r\nsatisfaction, saying to herself in a low voice: "That fat fellow has\r\ngiven me more than his life for his life! I can make him my creator at\r\na very little cost! Creature or creator, that\'s all the difference there\r\nis between one man and another--"\r\n\r\nShe did not finish her thought, but with a look of despair she turned\r\nand re-entered the Porte Saint-Leonard, where Hulot and Corentin were\r\nawaiting her.\r\n\r\n"Two more days," she cried, "and then--" She stopped, observing that\r\nthey were not alone--"he shall fall under your guns," she whispered to\r\nHulot.\r\n\r\nThe commandant recoiled a step and looked with a jeering contempt,\r\nimpossible to render, at the woman whose features and expression gave no\r\nsign whatever of relenting. There is one thing remarkable about women:\r\nthey never reason about their blameworthy actions,--feeling carries\r\nthem off their feet; even in their dissimulation there is an element of\r\nsincerity; and in women alone crime may exist without baseness, for\r\nit often happens that they do not know how it came about that they\r\ncommitted it.\r\n\r\n"I am going to Saint-James, to a ball the Chouans give to-morrow night,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"But," said Corentin, interrupting her, "that is fifteen miles distant;\r\nhad I not better accompany you?"\r\n\r\n"You think a great deal too much of something I never think of at all,"\r\nshe replied, "and that is yourself."\r\n\r\nMarie\'s contempt for Corentin was extremely pleasing to Hulot, who made\r\nhis well-known grimace as she turned away in the direction of her own\r\nhouse. Corentin followed her with his eyes, letting his face express\r\na consciousness of the fatal power he knew he could exercise over the\r\ncharming creature, by working upon the passions which sooner or later,\r\nhe believed, would give her to him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mademoiselle de Verneuil reached home she began to deliberate\r\non her ball-dress. Francine, accustomed to obey without understanding\r\nher mistress\'s motives, opened the trunks, and suggested a Greek\r\ncostume. The Republican fashions of those days were all Greek in style.\r\nMarie chose one which could be put in a box that was easy to carry.\r\n\r\n"Francine, my dear, I am going on an excursion into the country; do you\r\nwant to go with me, or will you stay behind?"\r\n\r\n"Stay behind!" exclaimed Francine; "then who would dress you?"\r\n\r\n"Where have you put that glove I gave you this morning?"\r\n\r\n"Here it is."\r\n\r\n"Sew this green ribbon into it, and, above all, take plenty of\r\nmoney." Then noticing that Francine was taking out a number of the new\r\nRepublican coins, she cried out, "Not those; they would get us murdered.\r\nSend Jeremie to Corentin--no, stay, the wretch would follow me--send to\r\nthe commandant; ask him from me for some six-franc crowns."\r\n\r\nWith the feminine sagacity which takes in the smallest detail, she\r\nthought of everything. While Francine was completing the arrangements\r\nfor this extraordinary trip, Marie practised the art of imitating an\r\nowl, and so far succeeded in rivalling Marche-a-Terre that the\r\nillusion was a good one. At midnight she left Fougeres by the gate\r\nof Saint-Leonard, took the little path to Nid-aux-Crocs, and started,\r\nfollowed by Francine, to cross the Val de Gibarry with a firm step,\r\nunder the impulse of that strong will which gives to the body and\r\nits bearing such an expression of force. To leave a ball-room with\r\nsufficient care to avoid a cold is an important affair to the health of\r\na woman; but let her have a passion in her heart, and her body becomes\r\nadamant. Such an enterprise as Marie had now undertaken would have\r\nfloated in a bold man\'s mind for a long time; but Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil had no sooner thought of it than its dangers became to her\r\nattractions.\r\n\r\n"You are starting without asking God to bless you," said Francine,\r\nturning to look at the tower of Saint-Leonard.\r\n\r\nThe pious Breton stopped, clasped her hands, and said an "Ave" to Saint\r\nAnne of Auray, imploring her to bless their expedition; during which\r\ntime her mistress waited pensively, looking first at the artless\r\nattitude of her maid who was praying fervently, and then at the effects\r\nof the vaporous moonlight as it glided among the traceries of the church\r\nbuilding, giving to the granite all the delicacy of filagree. The pair\r\nsoon reached the hut of Galope-Chopine. Light as their steps were they\r\nroused one of those huge watch-dogs on whose fidelity the Bretons rely,\r\nputting no fastening to their doors but a simple latch. The dog ran to\r\nthe strangers, and his bark became so threatening that they were forced\r\nto retreat a few steps and call for help. But no one came. Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil then gave the owl\'s cry, and instantly the rusty hinges\r\nof the door made a creaking sound, and Galope-Chopine, who had risen\r\nhastily, put out his head.\r\n\r\n"I wish to go to Saint-James," said Marie, showing the Gars\' glove.\r\n"Monsieur le Comte de Bauvan told me that you would take me there and\r\nprotect me on the way. Therefore be good enough to get us two riding\r\ndonkeys, and make yourself ready to go with us. Time is precious, for\r\nif we do not get to Saint-James before to-morrow night I can neither see\r\nthe ball nor the Gars."\r\n\r\nGalope-Chopine, completely bewildered, took the glove and turned it over\r\nand over, after lighting a pitch candle about a finger thick and\r\nthe color of gingerbread. This article of consumption, imported into\r\nBrittany from the North, was only one more proof to the eyes in this\r\nstrange country of a utter ignorance of all commercial principles, even\r\nthe commonest. After seeing the green ribbon, staring at Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil, scratching his ear, and drinking a beaker of cider (having\r\nfirst offered a glass to the beautiful lady), Galope-Chopine left her\r\nseated before the table and went to fetch the required donkeys.\r\n\r\nThe violet gleam cast by the pitch candle was not powerful enough\r\nto counteract the fitful moonlight, which touched the dark floor and\r\nfurniture of the smoke-blackened cottage with luminous points. The\r\nlittle boy had lifted his pretty head inquisitively, and above it two\r\ncows were poking their rosy muzzles and brilliant eyes through the holes\r\nin the stable wall. The big dog, whose countenance was by no means the\r\nleast intelligent of the family, seemed to be examining the strangers\r\nwith as much curiosity as the little boy. A painter would have stopped\r\nto admire the night effects of this scene, but Marie, not wishing to\r\nenter into conversation with Barbette, who sat up in bed and began to\r\nshow signs of amazement at recognizing her, left the hovel to escape\r\nits fetid air and the questions of its mistress. She ran quickly up the\r\nstone staircase behind the cottage, admiring the vast details of the\r\nlandscape, the aspect of which underwent as many changes as spectators\r\nmade steps either upward to the summits or downward to the valleys.\r\nThe moonlight was now enveloping like a luminous mist the valley of\r\nCouesnon. Certainly a woman whose heart was burdened with a despised\r\nlove would be sensitive to the melancholy which that soft brilliancy\r\ninspires in the soul, by the weird appearance it gives to objects and\r\nthe colors with which it tints the streams.\r\n\r\nThe silence was presently broken by the braying of a donkey. Marie went\r\nquickly back to the hut, and the party started. Galope-Chopine, armed\r\nwith a double-barrelled gun, wore a long goatskin, which gave him\r\nsomething the look of Robinson Crusoe. His blotched face, seamed with\r\nwrinkles, was scarcely visible under the broad-brimmed hat which the\r\nBreton peasants still retain as a tradition of the olden time; proud to\r\nhave won, after their servitude, the right to wear the former ornament\r\nof seignorial heads. This nocturnal caravan, protected by a guide whose\r\nclothing, attitudes, and person had something patriarchal about them,\r\nbore no little resemblance to the Flight into Egypt as we see it\r\nrepresented by the sombre brush of Rembrandt. Galope-Chopine carefully\r\navoided the main-road and guided the two women through the labyrinth of\r\nby-ways which intersect Brittany.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil then understood the Chouan warfare. In\r\nthreading these complicated paths, she could better appreciate the\r\ncondition of a country which when she saw it from an elevation had\r\nseemed to her so charming, but into which it was necessary to penetrate\r\nbefore the dangers and inextricable difficulties of it could be\r\nunderstood. Round each field, and from time immemorial, the peasants\r\nhave piled mud walls, about six feet high, and prismatic in shape;\r\non the top of which grow chestnuts, oaks and beeches. The walls thus\r\nplanted are called hedges (Norman hedges) and the long branches of the\r\ntrees sweeping over the pathways arch them. Sunken between these\r\nwalls (made of a clay soil) the paths are like the covered ways of a\r\nfortification, and where the granite rock, which in these regions comes\r\nto the surface of the ground, does not make a sort of rugged natural\r\npavement, they become so impracticable that the smallest vehicles can\r\nonly be drawn over them by two pairs of oxen or Breton horses, which\r\nare small but usually vigorous. These by-ways are so swampy that\r\nfoot-passengers have gradually by long usage made other paths beside\r\nthem on the hedge-banks which are called "rotes"; and these begin and\r\nend with each division into fields. In order to cross from one field to\r\nanother it is necessary to climb the clay banks by means of steps which\r\nare often very slippery after a rain.\r\n\r\nTravellers have many other obstacles to encounter in these intricate\r\npaths. Thus surrounded, each field is closed by what is called in the\r\nWest an _echalier_. That is a trunk or stout branch of a tree, one end\r\nof which, being pierced, is fitted to an upright post which serves as a\r\npivot on which it turns. One end of the _echalier_ projects far enough\r\nbeyond the pivot to hold a weight, and this singular rustic gate, the\r\npost of which rests in a hole made in the bank, is so easy to work that\r\na child can handle it. Sometimes the peasants economize the stone which\r\nforms the weight by lengthening the trunk or branch beyond the pivot.\r\nThis method of enclosure varies with the genius of each proprietor.\r\nSometimes it consists of a single trunk or branch, both ends of which\r\nare embedded in the bank. In other places it looks like a gate, and is\r\nmade of several slim branches placed at regular distances like the steps\r\nof a ladder lying horizontally. The form turns, like the _echalier_, on\r\na pivot. These "hedges" and _echaliers_ give the region the appearance\r\nof a huge chess-board, each field forming a square, perfectly isolated\r\nfrom the rest, closed like a fortress and protected by ramparts. The\r\ngate, which is very easy to defend, is a dangerous spot for assailants.\r\nThe Breton peasant thinks he improves his fallow land by encouraging the\r\ngrowth of gorse, a shrub so well treated in these regions that it soon\r\nattains the height of a man. This delusion, worthy of a population which\r\nputs its manure on the highest spot in the courtyard, has covered the\r\nsoil to a proportion of one fourth with masses of gorse, in the midst\r\nof which a thousand men might ambush. Also there is scarcely a field\r\nwithout a number of old apple-trees, the fruit being used for cider,\r\nwhich kill the vegetation wherever their branches cover the ground. Now,\r\nif the reader will reflect on the small extent of open ground within\r\nthese hedges and large trees whose hungry roots impoverish the soil, he\r\nwill have an idea of the cultivation and general character of the region\r\nthrough which Mademoiselle de Verneuil was now passing.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say whether the object of these enclosures is to\r\navoid all disputes of possession, or whether the custom is a lazy one of\r\nkeeping the cattle from straying, without the trouble of watching them;\r\nat any rate such formidable barriers are permanent obstacles, which make\r\nthese regions impenetrable and ordinary warfare impossible. There lies\r\nthe whole secret of the Chouan war. Mademoiselle de Verneuil saw plainly\r\nthe necessity the Republic was under to strangle the disaffection by\r\nmeans of police and by negotiation, rather than by a useless employment\r\nof military force. What could be done, in fact, with a people wise\r\nenough to despise the possession of towns, and hold to that of an open\r\ncountry already furnished with indestructible fortifications? Surely,\r\nnothing except negotiate; especially as the whole active strength of\r\nthese deluded peasants lay in a single able and enterprising leader. She\r\nadmired the genius of the minister who, sitting in his study, had\r\nbeen able to grasp the true way of procuring peace. She thought she\r\nunderstood the considerations which act on the minds of men powerful\r\nenough to take a bird\'s-eye view of an empire; men whose actions,\r\ncriminal in the eyes of the masses, are the outcome of a vast and\r\nintelligent thought. There is in these terrible souls some mysterious\r\nblending of the force of fate and that of destiny, some prescience which\r\nsuddenly elevates them above their fellows; the masses seek them for a\r\ntime in their own ranks, then they raise their eyes and see these lordly\r\nsouls above them.\r\n\r\nSuch reflections as these seemed to Mademoiselle de Verneuil to justify\r\nand even to ennoble her thoughts of vengeance; this travail of her soul\r\nand its expectations gave her vigor enough to bear the unusual fatigues\r\nof this strange journey. At the end of each property Galope-Chopine made\r\nthe women dismount from their donkeys and climb the obstructions;\r\nthen, mounting again, they made their way through the boggy paths which\r\nalready felt the approach of winter. The combination of tall trees,\r\nsunken paths, and enclosed places, kept the soil in a state of humidity\r\nwhich wrapped the travellers in a mantle of ice. However, after much\r\nwearisome fatigue, they managed to reach the woods of Marignay by\r\nsunrise. The journey then became less difficult, and led by a broad\r\nfootway through the forest. The arch formed by the branches, and the\r\ngreat size of the trees protected the travellers from the weather, and\r\nthe many difficulties of the first half of their way did not recur.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly gone a couple of miles through the woods before they\r\nheard a confused noise of distant voices and the tinkling of a bell, the\r\nsilvery tones of which did not have the monotonous sound given by the\r\nmovements of cattle. Galope-Chopine listened with great attention, as he\r\nwalked along, to this melody; presently a puff of wind brought several\r\nchanted words to his ear, which seemed to affect him powerfully, for he\r\nsuddenly turned the wearied donkeys into a by-path, which led away from\r\nSaint-James, paying no attention to the remonstrances of Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil, whose fears were increased by the darkness of the forest path\r\nalong which their guide now led them. To right and left were enormous\r\nblocks of granite, laid one upon the other, of whimsical shape. Across\r\nthem huge roots had glided, like monstrous serpents, seeking from afar\r\nthe juicy nourishment enjoyed by a few beeches. The two sides of the\r\nroad resembled the subterranean grottos that are famous for stalactites.\r\nImmense festoons of stone, where the darkling verdure of ivy and holly\r\nallied itself to the green-gray patches of the moss and lichen, hid\r\nthe precipices and the openings into several caves. When the three\r\ntravellers had gone a few steps through a very narrow path a most\r\nsurprising spectacle suddenly unfolded itself to Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil\'s eyes, and made her understand the obstinacy of her Chouan\r\nguide.\r\n\r\nA semi-circular basin of granite blocks formed an ampitheatre, on the\r\nrough tiers of which rose tall black pines and yellowing chestnuts, one\r\nabove the other, like a vast circus, where the wintry sun shed its pale\r\ncolors rather than poured its light, and autumn had spread her tawny\r\ncarpet of fallen leaves. About the middle of this hall, which seemed\r\nto have had the deluge for its architect, stood three enormous Druid\r\nstones,--a vast altar, on which was raised an old church-banner. About\r\na hundred men, kneeling with bared heads, were praying fervently in this\r\nnatural enclosure, where a priest, assisted by two other ecclesiastics,\r\nwas saying mass. The poverty of the sacerdotal vestments, the feeble\r\nvoice of the priest, which echoed like a murmur through the open space,\r\nthe praying men filled with conviction and united by one and the same\r\nsentiment, the bare cross, the wild and barren temple, the dawning day,\r\ngave the primitive character of the earlier times of Christianity to the\r\nscene. Mademoiselle de Verneuil was struck with admiration. This mass\r\nsaid in the depths of the woods, this worship driven back by persecution\r\nto its sources, the poesy of ancient times revived in the midst of this\r\nweird and romantic nature, these armed and unarmed Chouans, cruel and\r\npraying, men yet children, all these things resembled nothing that she\r\nhad ever seen or yet imagined. She remembered admiring in her childhood\r\nthe pomps of the Roman church so pleasing to the senses; but she knew\r\nnothing of God _alone_, his cross on the altar, his altar the earth. In\r\nplace of the carved foliage of a Gothic cathedral, the autumnal trees\r\nupheld the sky; instead of a thousand colors thrown through stained\r\nglass windows, the sun could barely slide its ruddy rays and dull\r\nreflections on altar, priest, and people. The men present were a fact,\r\na reality, and not a system,--it was a prayer, not a religion. But human\r\npassions, the momentary repression of which gave harmony to the picture,\r\nsoon reappeared on this mysterious scene and gave it powerful vitality.\r\n\r\nAs Mademoiselle de Verneuil reached the spot the reading of the gospel\r\nwas just over. She recognized in the officiating priest, not without\r\nfear, the Abbe Gudin, and she hastily slipped behind a granite\r\nblock, drawing Francine after her. She was, however, unable to move\r\nGalope-Chopine from the place he had chosen, and from which he intended\r\nto share in the benefits of the ceremony; but she noticed the nature\r\nof the ground around her, and hoped to be able to evade the danger by\r\ngetting away, when the service was over, before the priests. Through a\r\nlarge fissure of the rock that hid her, she saw the Abbe Gudin mounting\r\na block of granite which served him as a pulpit, where he began his\r\nsermon with the words,--\r\n\r\n"_In nomine Patris et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti_."\r\n\r\nAll present made the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\n"My dear friends," continued the abbe, "let us pray in the first place\r\nfor the souls of the dead,--Jean Cochegrue, Nicalos Laferte, Joseph\r\nBrouet, Francois Parquoi, Sulpice Coupiau, all of this parish, and dead\r\nof wounds received in the fight on Mont Pelerine and at the siege of\r\nFougeres. _De profundis_," etc.\r\n\r\nThe psalm was recited, according to custom, by the congregation and the\r\npriests, taking verses alternately with a fervor which augured well for\r\nthe success of the sermon. When it was over the abbe continued, in a\r\nvoice which became gradually louder and louder, for the former Jesuit\r\nwas not unaware that vehemence of delivery was in itself a powerful\r\nargument with which to persuade his semi-savage hearers.\r\n\r\n"These defenders of our God, Christians, have set you an example of\r\nduty," he said. "Are you not ashamed of what will be said of you in\r\nparadise? If it were not for these blessed ones, who have just been\r\nreceived with open arms by all the saints, our Lord might have thought\r\nthat your parish is inhabited by Mahometans!--Do you know, men, what\r\nis said of you in Brittany and in the king\'s presence? What! you don\'t\r\nknow? Then I shall tell you. They say: \'Behold, the Blues have cast down\r\naltars, and killed priests, and murdered the king and queen; they mean\r\nto make the parish folk of Brittany Blues like themselves, and send them\r\nto fight in foreign lands, away from their churches, where they run the\r\nrisk of dying without confession and going eternally to hell; and yet\r\nthe gars of Marignay, whose churches they have burned, stand still with\r\nfolded arms! Oh! oh! this Republic of damned souls has sold the property\r\nof God and that of the nobles at auction; it has shared the proceeds\r\nwith the Blues; it has decreed, in order to gorge itself with money\r\nas it does with blood, that a crown shall be only worth three francs\r\ninstead of six; and yet the gars of Marignay haven\'t seized their\r\nweapons and driven the Blues from Brittany! Ha! paradise will be closed\r\nto them! they can never save their souls!\' That\'s what they say of you\r\nin the king\'s presence! It is your own salvation, Christians, which is\r\nat stake. Your souls are to be saved by fighting for religion and the\r\nking. Saint Anne of Auray herself appeared to me yesterday at half-past\r\ntwo o\'clock; and she said to me these very words which I now repeat to\r\nyou: \'Are you a priest of Marignay?\' \'Yes, madame, ready to serve you.\'\r\n\'I am Saint Anne of Auray, aunt of God, after the manner of Brittany. I\r\nhave come to bid you warn the people of Marignay that they must not\r\nhope for salvation if they do not take arms. You are to refuse them\r\nabsolution for their sins unless they serve God. Bless their guns, and\r\nthose who gain absolution will never miss the Blues, because their guns\r\nare sanctified.\' She disappeared, leaving an odor of incense behind her.\r\nI marked the spot. It is under the oak of the Patte d\'Oie; just where\r\nthat beautiful wooden Virgin was placed by the rector of Saint-James;\r\nto whom the crippled mother of Pierre Leroi (otherwise called\r\nMarche-a-Terre) came to pray, and was cured of all her pains, because\r\nof her son\'s good deeds. You see her there in the midst of you, and\r\nyou know that she walks without assistance. It was a miracle--a miracle\r\nintended, like the resurrection of Marie Lambrequin to prove to you that\r\nGod will never forsake the Breton cause so long as the people fight for\r\nhis servants and for the king. Therefore, my dear brothers, if you wish\r\nto save your souls and show yourselves defenders of God and the king,\r\nyou will obey all the orders of the man whom God has sent to us, and\r\nwhom we call THE GARS. Then indeed, you will no longer be Mahometans;\r\nyou will rank with all the gars of Brittany under the flag of God. You\r\ncan take from the pockets of the Blues the money they have stolen from\r\nyou; for, if the fields have to go uncultivated while you are making\r\nwar, God and the king will deliver to you the spoils of your enemies.\r\nShall it be said, Christians, that the gars of Marignay are behind the\r\ngars of the Morbihan, the gars of Saint-Georges, of Vitre, or Antrain,\r\nwho are all faithful to God and the king? Will you let them get all the\r\nspoils? Will you stand like heretics, with your arms folded, when other\r\nBretons are saving their souls and saving their king? \'Forsake all,\r\nand follow me,\' says the Gospel. Have we not forsaken our tithes, we\r\npriests? And you, I say to you, forsake all for this holy war! You\r\nshall be like the Maccabees. All will be forgiven you. You will find the\r\npriests and curates in your midst, and you will conquer! Pay attention\r\nto these words, Christians," he said, as he ended; "for this day only\r\nhave we the power to bless your guns. Those who do not take advantage of\r\nthe Saint\'s favor will not find her merciful; she will not forgive them\r\nor listen to them as she did in the last war."\r\n\r\nThis appeal, enforced by the power of a loud voice and by many gestures,\r\nthe vehemence of which bathed the orator in perspiration, produced,\r\napparently, very little effect. The peasants stood motionless, their\r\neyes on the speaker, like statues; but Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\npresently noticed that this universal attitude was the result of a\r\nspell cast by the abbe on the crowd. He had, like great actors, held his\r\naudience as one man by addressing their passions and self-interests. He\r\nhad absolved excesses before committal, and broken the only bonds which\r\nheld these boorish men to the practice of religious and social precepts.\r\nHe had prostituted his sacred office to political interests; but it must\r\nbe said that, in these times of revolution, every man made a weapon\r\nof whatever he possessed for the benefit of his party, and the pacific\r\ncross of Jesus became as much an instrument of war as the peasant\'s\r\nplough-share.\r\n\r\nSeeing no one with whom to advise, Mademoiselle de Verneuil turned\r\nto look for Francine, and was not a little astonished to see that she\r\nshared in the rapt enthusiasm, and was devoutly saying her chaplet\r\nover some beads which Galope-Chopine had probably given her during the\r\nsermon.\r\n\r\n"Francine," she said, in a low voice, "are you afraid of being a\r\nMahometan?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! mademoiselle," replied the girl, "just see Pierre\'s mother; she is\r\nwalking!"\r\n\r\nFrancine\'s whole attitude showed such deep conviction that Marie\r\nunderstood at once the secret of the homily, the influence of the clergy\r\nover the rural masses, and the tremendous effect of the scene which was\r\nnow beginning.\r\n\r\nThe peasants advanced one by one and knelt down, presenting their guns\r\nto the preacher, who laid them upon the altar. Galope-Chopine offered\r\nhis old duck-shooter. The three priests sang the hymn "Veni, Creator,"\r\nwhile the celebrant wrapped the instruments of death in bluish clouds\r\nof incense, waving the smoke into shapes that appeared to interlace one\r\nanother. When the breeze had dispersed the vapor the guns were returned\r\nin due order. Each man received his own on his knees from the hands of\r\nthe priests, who recited a Latin prayer as they returned them. After\r\nthe men had regained their places, the profound enthusiasm of the\r\ncongregation, mute till then, broke forth and resounded in a formidable\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n"_Domine salvum fac regem_!" was the prayer which the preacher intoned\r\nin an echoing voice, and was then sung vehemently by the people. The\r\ncry had something savage and warlike in it. The two notes of the word\r\n_regem_, readily interpreted by the peasants, were taken with such\r\nenergy that Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s thoughts reverted almost tenderly\r\nto the exiled Bourbon family. These recollections awakened those of her\r\npast life. Her memory revived the fetes of a court now dispersed, in\r\nwhich she had once a share. The face of the marquis entered her reverie.\r\nWith the natural mobility of a woman\'s mind she forgot the scene before\r\nher and reverted to her plans of vengeance, which might cost her her\r\nlife or come to nought under the influence of a look. Seeing a branch of\r\nholly the trivial thought crossed her mind that in this decisive moment,\r\nwhen she wished to appear in all her beauty at the ball, she had no\r\ndecoration for her hair; and she gathered a tuft of the prickly leaves\r\nand shining berries with the idea of wearing them.\r\n\r\n"Ho! ho! my gun may miss fire on a duck, but on a Blue, never!" cried\r\nGalope-Chopine, nodding his head in sign of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMarie examined her guide\'s face attentively, and found it of the type of\r\nthose she had just seen. The old Chouan had evidently no more ideas than\r\na child. A naive joy wrinkled his cheeks and forehead as he looked at\r\nhis gun; but a pious conviction cast upon that expression of his joy\r\na tinge of fanaticism, which brought into his face for an instant the\r\nsigns of the vices of civilization.\r\n\r\nPresently they reached a village, or rather a collection of huts like\r\nthat of Galope-Chopine, where the rest of the congregation arrived\r\nbefore Mademoiselle de Verneuil had finished the milk and bread and\r\nbutter which formed the meal. This irregular company was led by the\r\nabbe, who held in his hand a rough cross draped with a flag, followed\r\nby a gars, who was proudly carrying the parish banner. Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil was compelled to mingle with this detachment, which was on its\r\nway, like herself, to Saint-James, and would naturally protect her from\r\nall danger as soon as Galope-Chopine informed them that the Gars glove\r\nwas in her possession, provided always that the abbe did not see her.\r\n\r\nTowards sunset the three travellers arrived safely at Saint-James, a\r\nlittle town which owes its name to the English, by whom it was built\r\nin the fourteenth century, during their occupation of Brittany. Before\r\nentering it Mademoiselle de Verneuil was witness of a strange scene\r\nof this strange war, to which, however, she gave little attention; she\r\nfeared to be recognized by some of her enemies, and this dread hastened\r\nher steps. Five or six thousand peasants were camping in a field.\r\nTheir clothing was not in any degree warlike; in fact, this tumultuous\r\nassembly resembled that of a great fair. Some attention was needed to\r\neven observe that these Bretons were armed, for their goatskins were so\r\nmade as to hide their guns, and the weapons that were chiefly visible\r\nwere the scythes with which some of the men had armed themselves while\r\nawaiting the distribution of muskets. Some were eating and drinking,\r\nothers were fighting and quarrelling in loud tones, but the greater\r\npart were sleeping on the ground. An officer in a red uniform attracted\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil\'s attention, and she supposed him to belong to\r\nthe English service. At a little distance two other officers seemed to\r\nbe trying to teach a few Chouans, more intelligent than the rest, to\r\nhandle two cannon, which apparently formed the whole artillery of the\r\nroyalist army. Shouts hailed the coming of the gars of Marignay, who\r\nwere recognized by their banner. Under cover of the tumult which the\r\nnew-comers and the priests excited in the camp, Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nwas able to make her way past it and into the town without danger. She\r\nstopped at a plain-looking inn not far from the building where the ball\r\nwas to be given. The town was so full of strangers that she could only\r\nobtain one miserable room. When she was safely in it Galope-Chopine\r\nbrought Francine the box which contained the ball dress, and having done\r\nso he stood stock-still in an attitude of indescribable irresolution. At\r\nany other time Mademoiselle de Verneuil would have been much amused to\r\nsee what a Breton peasant can be like when he leaves his native parish;\r\nbut now she broke the charm by opening her purse and producing four\r\ncrowns of six francs each, which she gave him.\r\n\r\n"Take it," she said, "and if you wish to oblige me, you will go straight\r\nback to Fougeres without entering the camp or drinking any cider."\r\n\r\nThe Chouan, amazed at her liberality, looked first at the crowns (which\r\nhe had taken) and then at Mademoiselle de Verneuil; but she made him a\r\nsign with her hand and he disappeared.\r\n\r\n"How could you send him away, mademoiselle?" said Francine. "Don\'t you\r\nsee how the place is surrounded? we shall never get away! and who will\r\nprotect you here?"\r\n\r\n"You have a protector of your own," said Marie maliciously, giving in an\r\nundertone Marche-a-Terre\'s owl cry which she was constantly practising.\r\n\r\nFrancine colored, and smiled rather sadly at her mistress\'s gaiety.\r\n\r\n"But who is yours?" she said.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil plucked out her dagger, and showed it to the\r\nfrightened girl, who dropped on a chair and clasped her hands.\r\n\r\n"What have you come here for, Marie?" she cried in a supplicating voice\r\nwhich asked no answer.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil was busily twisting the branches of holly which\r\nshe had gathered.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether this holly will be becoming," she said; "a\r\nbrilliant skin like mine may possibly bear a dark wreath of this kind.\r\nWhat do you think, Francine?"\r\n\r\nSeveral remarks of the same kind as she dressed for the ball showed the\r\nabsolute self-possession and coolness of this strange woman. Whoever had\r\nlistened to her then would have found it hard to believe in the gravity\r\nof a situation in which she was risking her life. An Indian muslin\r\ngown, rather short and clinging like damp linen, revealed the delicate\r\noutlines of her shape; over this she wore a red drapery, numerous folds\r\nof which, gradually lengthening as they fell by her side, took the\r\ngraceful curves of a Greek peplum. This voluptuous garment of the pagan\r\npriestesses lessened the indecency of the rest of the attire which the\r\nfashions of the time suffered women to wear. To soften its immodesty\r\nstill further, Marie threw a gauze scarf over her shoulders, left bare\r\nand far too low by the red drapery. She wound the long braids of her\r\nhair into the flat irregular cone above the nape of the neck which gives\r\nsuch grace to certain antique statues by an artistic elongation of the\r\nhead, while a few stray locks escaping from her forehead fell in\r\nshining curls beside her cheeks. With a form and head thus dressed,\r\nshe presented a perfect likeness of the noble masterpieces of Greek\r\nsculpture. She smiled as she looked with approval at the arrangement of\r\nher hair, which brought out the beauties of her face, while the scarlet\r\nberries of the holly wreath which she laid upon it repeated charmingly\r\nthe color of the peplum. As she twisted and turned a few leaves, to\r\ngive capricious diversity to their arrangement, she examined her whole\r\ncostume in a mirror to judge of its general effect.\r\n\r\n"I am horrible to-night," she said, as though she were surrounded by\r\nflatterers. "I look like a statue of Liberty."\r\n\r\nShe placed the dagger carefully in her bosom leaving the rubies in the\r\nhilt exposed, their ruddy reflections attracting the eye to the hidden\r\nbeauties of her shape. Francine could not bring herself to leave her\r\nmistress. When Marie was ready she made various pretexts to follow her.\r\nShe must help her to take off her mantle, and the overshoes which the\r\nmud and muck in the streets compelled her to wear (though the roads had\r\nbeen sanded for this occasion); also the gauze veil which Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil had thrown over her head to conceal her features from the\r\nChouans who were collecting in the streets to watch the company. The\r\ncrowd was in fact so great that they were forced to make their way\r\nthrough two hedges of Chouans. Francine no longer strove to detain her\r\nmistress, and after giving a few last touches to a costume the greatest\r\ncharm of which was its exquisite freshness, she stationed herself in the\r\ncourtyard that she might not abandon this beloved mistress to her fate\r\nwithout being able to fly to her succor; for the poor girl foresaw only\r\nevil in these events.\r\n\r\nA strange scene was taking place in Montauran\'s chamber as Marie was on\r\nher way to the ball. The young marquis, who had just finished dressing,\r\nwas putting on the broad red ribbon which distinguished him as first\r\nin rank of the assembly, when the Abbe Gudin entered the room with an\r\nanxious air.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur le marquis, come quickly," he said. "You alone can quell a\r\ntumult which has broken out, I don\'t know why, among the leaders. They\r\ntalk of abandoning the king\'s cause. I think that devil of a Rifoel\r\nis at the bottom of it. Such quarrels are always caused by some mere\r\nnonsense. Madame du Gua reproached him, so I hear, for coming to the\r\nball ill-dressed."\r\n\r\n"That woman must be crazy," cried the marquis, "to try to--"\r\n\r\n"Rifoel retorted," continued the abbe, interrupting his chief, "that if\r\nyou had given him the money promised him in the king\'s name--"\r\n\r\n"Enough, enough; I understand it all now. This scene has all been\r\narranged, and you are put forward as ambassador--"\r\n\r\n"I, monsieur le marquis!" said the abbe, again interrupting him. "I am\r\nsupporting you vigorously, and you will, I hope, do me the justice to\r\nbelieve that the restoration of our altars in France and that of the\r\nking upon the throne of his fathers are far more powerful incentives to\r\nmy humble labors than the bishopric of Rennes which you--"\r\n\r\nThe abbe dared say no more, for the marquis smiled bitterly at his last\r\nwords. However, the young chief instantly repressed all expression of\r\nfeeling, his brow grew stern, and he followed the Abbe Gudin into a hall\r\nwhere the worst of the clamor was echoing.\r\n\r\n"I recognize no authority here," Rifoel was saying, casting angry looks\r\nat all about him and laying his hand on the hilt of his sabre.\r\n\r\n"Do you recognize that of common-sense?" asked the marquis, coldly.\r\n\r\nThe young Chevalier de Vissard, better known under his patronymic of\r\nRifoel, was silent before the general of the Catholic armies.\r\n\r\n"What is all this about, gentlemen?" asked the marquis, examining the\r\nfaces round him.\r\n\r\n"This, monsieur le marquis," said a famous smuggler, with the\r\nawkwardness of a man of the people who long remains under the yoke of\r\nrespect to a great lord, though he admits no barriers after he has once\r\njumped them, and regards the aristocrat as an equal only, "_this_," he\r\nsaid, "and you have come in the nick of time to hear it. I am no speaker\r\nof gilded phrases, and I shall say things plainly. I commanded five\r\nhundred men during the late war. Since we have taken up arms again I\r\nhave raised a thousand heads as hard as mine for the service of the\r\nking. It is now seven years that I have risked my life in the good\r\ncause; I don\'t blame you, but I say that the laborer is worthy of\r\nhis hire. Now, to begin with, I demand that I be called Monsieur de\r\nCottereau. I also demand that the rank of colonel shall be granted me,\r\nor I send in my adhesion to the First Consul! Let me tell you, monsieur\r\nle marquis, my men and I have a devilishly importunate creditor who must\r\nbe satisfied--he\'s here!" he added, striking his stomach.\r\n\r\n"Have the musicians come?" said the marquis, in a contemptuous tone,\r\nturning to Madame du Gua.\r\n\r\nBut the smuggler had dealt boldly with an important topic, and the\r\ncalculating, ambitious minds of those present had been too long in\r\nsuspense as to what they might hope for from the king to allow the scorn\r\nof their new leader to put an end to the scene. Rifoel hastily blocked\r\nthe way before Montauran, and seized his hand to oblige him to remain.\r\n\r\n"Take care, monsieur le marquis," he said; "you are treating far too\r\nlightly men who have a right to the gratitude of him whom you are here\r\nto represent. We know that his Majesty has sent you with full powers to\r\njudge of our services, and we say that they ought to be recognized and\r\nrewarded, for we risk our heads upon the scaffold daily. I know, so far\r\nas I am concerned, that the rank of brigadier-general--"\r\n\r\n"You mean colonel."\r\n\r\n"No, monsieur le marquis; Charette made me a colonel. The rank I mention\r\ncannot be denied me. I am not arguing for myself, I speak for my brave\r\nbrothers-in-arms, whose services ought to be recorded. Your signature\r\nand your promise will suffice them for the present; though," he added,\r\nin a low voice, "I must say they are satisfied with very little. But,"\r\nhe continued, raising his voice, "when the sun rises on the chateau of\r\nVersailles to glorify the return of the monarchy after the faithful have\r\nconquered France, _in France_, for the king, will they obtain favors\r\nfor their families, pensions for widows, and the restitution of their\r\nconfiscated property? I doubt it. But, monsieur le marquis, we must\r\nhave certified proof of our services when that time comes. I will never\r\ndistrust the king, but I do distrust those cormorants of ministers and\r\ncourtiers, who tingle his ears with talk about the public welfare, the\r\nhonor of France, the interests of the crown, and other crochets. They\r\nwill sneer at a loyal Vendean or a brave Chouan, because he is old\r\nand the sword he drew for the good cause dangles on his withered legs,\r\npalsied with exposure. Can you say that we are wrong in feeling thus?"\r\n\r\n"You talk well, Monsieur du Vissard, but you are over hasty," replied\r\nthe marquis.\r\n\r\n"Listen, marquis," said the Comte de Bauvan, in a whisper. "Rifoel has\r\nreally, on my word, told the truth. You are sure, yourself, to have the\r\near of the king, while the rest of us only see him at a distance and\r\nfrom time to time. I will own to you that if you do not give me your\r\nword as a gentleman that I shall, in due course of time, obtain the\r\nplace of Master of Woods and Waters in France, the devil take me if I\r\nwill risk my neck any longer. To conquer Normandy for the king is not\r\nan easy matter, and I demand the Order for it. But," he added, coloring,\r\n"there\'s time enough to think of that. God forbid that I should imitate\r\nthese poor mercenaries and harass you. Speak to the king for me, and\r\nthat\'s enough."\r\n\r\nEach of the chiefs found means to let the marquis know, in a more\r\nor less ingenious manner, the exaggerated price they set upon their\r\nservices. One modestly demanded the governorship of Brittany; another\r\na barony; this one a promotion; that one a command; and all wanted\r\npensions.\r\n\r\n"Well, baron," said the marquis to Monsieur du Guenic, "don\'t you want\r\nanything?"\r\n\r\n"These gentlemen have left me nothing but the crown of France, marquis,\r\nbut I might manage to put up with that--"\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen!" cried the Abbe Gudin, in a loud voice, "remember that if\r\nyou are too eager you will spoil everything in the day of victory. The\r\nking will then be compelled to make concessions to the revolutionists."\r\n\r\n"To those Jacobins!" shouted the smuggler. "Ha! if the king would let me\r\nhave my way, I\'d answer for my thousand men; we\'d soon wring their necks\r\nand be rid of them."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur _de_ Cottereau," said the marquis, "I see some of our invited\r\nguests arriving. We must all do our best by attention and courtesy to\r\nmake them share our sacred enterprise; you will agree, I am sure, that\r\nthis is not the moment to bring forward your demands, however just they\r\nmay be."\r\n\r\nSo saying, the marquis went to the door, as if to meet certain of the\r\ncountry nobles who were entering the room, but the bold smuggler barred\r\nhis way in a respectful manner.\r\n\r\n"No, no, monsieur le marquis, excuse me," he said; "the Jacobins taught\r\nme too well in 1793 that it is not he who sows and reaps who eats the\r\nbread. Sign this bit of paper for me, and to-morrow I\'ll bring you\r\nfifteen hundred gars. If not, I\'ll treat with the First Consul."\r\n\r\nLooking haughtily about him, the marquis saw plainly that the boldness\r\nof the old partisan and his resolute air were not displeasing to any of\r\nthe spectators of this debate. One man alone, sitting by himself in a\r\ncorner of the room, appeared to take no part in the scene, and to be\r\nchiefly occupied in filling his pipe. The contemptuous air with which\r\nhe glanced at the speakers, his modest demeanor, and a look of sympathy\r\nwhich the marquis encountered in his eyes, made the young leader observe\r\nthe man, whom he then recognized as Major Brigaut, and he went suddenly\r\nup to him.\r\n\r\n"And you, what do you want?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, monsieur le marquis, if the king comes back that\'s all I want."\r\n\r\n"But for yourself?"\r\n\r\n"For myself? are you joking?"\r\n\r\nThe marquis pressed the horny hand of the Breton, and said to Madame du\r\nGua, who was near them: "Madame, I may perish in this enterprise before\r\nI have time to make a faithful report to the king on the Catholic armies\r\nof Brittany. I charge you, in case you live to see the Restoration,\r\nnot to forget this honorable man nor the Baron du Guenic. There is more\r\ndevotion in them than in all those other men put together."\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the chiefs, who were waiting with some impatience till the\r\nmarquis should reply to their demands. They were all holding papers in\r\ntheir hands, on which, no doubt, their services were recorded over\r\nthe signatures of the various generals of the former war; and all were\r\nmurmuring. The Abbe Gudin, the Comte de Bauvan, and the Baron du\r\nGuenic were consulting how best to help the marquis in rejecting these\r\nextravagant demands, for they felt the position of the young leader to\r\nbe extremely delicate.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the marquis ran his blue eyes, gleaming with satire, over the\r\nwhole assembly, and said in a clear voice: "Gentlemen, I do not know\r\nwhether the powers which the king has graciously assigned to me are such\r\nthat I am able to satisfy your demands. He doubtless did not foresee\r\nsuch zeal, such devotion, on your part. You shall judge yourselves of\r\nthe duties put upon me,--duties which I shall know how to accomplish."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he left the room and returned immediately holding in his hand\r\nan open letter bearing the royal seal and signature.\r\n\r\n"These are the letters-patent in virtue of which you are to obey me," he\r\nsaid. "They authorize me to govern the provinces of Brittany, Normandy,\r\nMaine, and Anjou, in the king\'s name, and to recognize the services of\r\nsuch officers as may distinguish themselves in his armies."\r\n\r\nA movement of satisfaction ran through the assembly. The Chouans\r\napproached the marquis and made a respectful circle round him. All eyes\r\nfastened on the king\'s signature. The young chief, who was standing near\r\nthe chimney, suddenly threw the letters into the fire, and they were\r\nburned in a second.\r\n\r\n"I do not choose to command any," cried the young man, "but those who\r\nsee a king in the king, and not a prey to prey upon. You are free,\r\ngentlemen, to leave me."\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua, the Abbe Gudin, Major Brigaut, the Chevalier du Vissard,\r\nthe Baron du Guenic, and the Comte de Bauvan raised the cry of "Vive le\r\nroi!" For a moment the other leaders hesitated; then, carried away by\r\nthe noble action of the marquis, they begged him to forget what had\r\npassed, assuring him that, letters-patent or not, he must always be\r\ntheir leader.\r\n\r\n"Come and dance," cried the Comte de Bauvan, "and happen what will!\r\nAfter all," he added, gaily, "it is better, my friends, to pray to God\r\nthan the saints. Let us fight first, and see what comes of it."\r\n\r\n"Ha! that\'s good advice," said Brigaut. "I have never yet known a day\'s\r\npay drawn in the morning."\r\n\r\nThe assembly dispersed about the rooms, where the guests were now\r\narriving. The marquis tried in vain to shake off the gloom which\r\ndarkened his face. The chiefs perceived the unfavorable impression\r\nmade upon a young man whose devotion was still surrounded by all the\r\nbeautiful illusions of youth, and they were ashamed of their action.\r\n\r\nHowever, a joyous gaiety soon enlivened the opening of the ball, at\r\nwhich were present the most important personages of the royalist party,\r\nwho, unable to judge rightly, in the depths of a rebellious province, of\r\nthe actual events of the Revolution, mistook their hopes for realities.\r\nThe bold operations already begun by Montauran, his name, his\r\nfortune, his capacity, raised their courage and caused that political\r\nintoxication, the most dangerous of all excitements, which does not cool\r\ntill torrents of blood have been uselessly shed. In the minds of all\r\npresent the Revolution was nothing more than a passing trouble to the\r\nkingdom of France, where, to their belated eyes, nothing was changed.\r\nThe country belonged as it ever did to the house of Bourbon. The\r\nroyalists were the lords of the soil as completely as they were four\r\nyears earlier, when Hoche obtained less a peace than an armistice. The\r\nnobles made light of the revolutionists; for them Bonaparte was another,\r\nbut more fortunate, Marceau. So gaiety reigned. The women had come to\r\ndance. A few only of the chiefs, who had fought the Blues, knew the\r\ngravity of the situation; but they were well aware that if they talked\r\nof the First Consul and his power to their benighted companions, they\r\ncould not make themselves understood. These men stood apart and looked\r\nat the women with indifference. Madame du Gua, who seemed to do the\r\nhonors of the ball, endeavored to quiet the impatience of the dancers by\r\ndispensing flatteries to each in turn. The musicians were tuning their\r\ninstruments and the dancing was about to begin, when Madame du Gua\r\nnoticed the gloom on de Montauran\'s face and went hurriedly up to him.\r\n\r\n"I hope it is not that vulgar scene you have just had with those\r\nclodhoppers which depresses you?" she said.\r\n\r\nShe got no answer; the marquis, absorbed in thought, was listening in\r\nfancy to the prophetic reasons which Marie had given him in the midst of\r\nthe same chiefs at La Vivetiere, urging him to abandon the struggle\r\nof kings against peoples. But the young man\'s soul was too proud, too\r\nlofty, too full perhaps of conviction, to abandon an enterprise he had\r\nonce begun, and he decided at this moment, to continue it boldly in the\r\nface of all obstacles. He raised his head haughtily, and for the first\r\ntime noticed that Madame du Gua was speaking to him.\r\n\r\n"Your mind is no doubt at Fougeres," she remarked bitterly, seeing how\r\nuseless her efforts to attract his attention had been. "Ah, monsieur,\r\nI would give my life to put _her_ within your power, and see you happy\r\nwith her."\r\n\r\n"Then why have you done all you could to kill her?"\r\n\r\n"Because I wish her dead or in your arms. Yes, I may have loved the\r\nMarquis de Montauran when I thought him a hero, but now I feel only a\r\npitying friendship for him; I see him shorn of all his glory by a fickle\r\nlove for a worthless woman."\r\n\r\n"As for love," said the marquis, in a sarcastic tone, "you judge me\r\nwrong. If I loved that girl, madame, I might desire her less; if it were\r\nnot for you, perhaps I should not think of her at all."\r\n\r\n"Here she is!" exclaimed Madame du Gua, abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe haste with which the marquis looked round went to the heart of the\r\nwoman; but the clear light of the wax candles enabled her to see every\r\nchange on the face of the man she loved so violently, and when he turned\r\nback his face, smiling at her woman\'s trick, she fancied there was still\r\nsome hope of recovering him.\r\n\r\n"What are you laughing at?" asked the Comte de Bauvan.\r\n\r\n"At a soap-bubble which has burst," interposed Madame du Gua, gaily.\r\n"The marquis, if we are now to believe him, is astonished that his\r\nheart ever beat the faster for that girl who presumes to call herself\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil. You know who I mean."\r\n\r\n"That girl!" echoed the count. "Madame, the author of a wrong is\r\nbound to repair it. I give you my word of honor that she is really the\r\ndaughter of the Duc de Verneuil."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur le comte," said the marquis, in a changed voice, "which of\r\nyour statements am I to believe,--that of La Vivetiere, or that now\r\nmade?"\r\n\r\nThe loud voice of a servant at the door announced Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil. The count sprang forward instantly, offered his hand to the\r\nbeautiful woman with every mark of profound respect, and led her through\r\nthe inquisitive crowd to the marquis and Madame du Gua. "Believe the one\r\nnow made," he replied to the astonished young leader.\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua turned pale at the unwelcome sight of the girl, who stood\r\nfor a moment, glancing proudly over the assembled company, among whom\r\nshe sought to find the guests at La Vivetiere. She awaited the forced\r\nsalutation of her rival, and, without even looking at the marquis, she\r\nallowed the count to lead her to the place of honor beside Madame du\r\nGua, whose bow she returned with an air that was slightly protecting.\r\nBut the latter, with a woman\'s instinct, took no offense; on the\r\ncontrary, she immediately assumed a smiling, friendly manner. The\r\nextraordinary dress and beauty of Mademoiselle de Verneuil caused a\r\nmurmur throughout the ballroom. When the marquis and Madame du Gua\r\nlooked towards the late guests at La Vivetiere they saw them in an\r\nattitude of respectful admiration which was not assumed; each seemed\r\ndesirous of recovering favor with the misjudged young woman. The enemies\r\nwere in presence of each other.\r\n\r\n"This is really magic, mademoiselle," said Madame du Gua; "there is no\r\none like you for surprises. Have you come all alone?"\r\n\r\n"All alone," replied Mademoiselle de Verneuil. "So you have only one to\r\nkill to-night, madame."\r\n\r\n"Be merciful," said Madame du Gua. "I cannot express to you the pleasure\r\nI have in seeing you again. I have truly been overwhelmed by the\r\nremembrance of the wrongs I have done you, and am most anxious for an\r\noccasion to repair them."\r\n\r\n"As for those wrongs, madame, I readily pardon those you did to me, but\r\nmy heart bleeds for the Blues whom you murdered. However, I excuse all,\r\nin return for the service you have done me."\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua lost countenance as she felt her hand pressed by her\r\nbeautiful rival with insulting courtesy. The marquis had hitherto stood\r\nmotionless, but he now seized the arm of the count.\r\n\r\n"You have shamefully misled me," he said; "you have compromised my\r\nhonor. I am not a Geronte of comedy, and I shall have your life or you\r\nwill have mine."\r\n\r\n"Marquis," said the count, haughtily, "I am ready to give you all the\r\nexplanations you desire."\r\n\r\nThey passed into the next room. The witnesses of this scene, even those\r\nleast initiated into the secret, began to understand its nature, so\r\nthat when the musicians gave the signal for the dancing to begin no one\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle, what service have I rendered you that deserves a return?"\r\nsaid Madame du Gua, biting her lips in a sort of rage.\r\n\r\n"Did you not enlighten me as to the true character of the Marquis de\r\nMontauran, madame? With what utter indifference that man allowed me to\r\ngo to my death! I give him up to you willingly!"\r\n\r\n"Then why are you here?" asked Madame du Gua, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"To recover the respect and consideration you took from me at La\r\nVivetiere, madame. As for all the rest, make yourself easy. Even if the\r\nmarquis returned to me, you know very well that a return is never love."\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua took Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s hand with that\r\naffectionate touch and motion which women practise to each other,\r\nespecially in the presence of men.\r\n\r\n"Well, my poor dear child," she said, "I am glad to find you so\r\nreasonable. If the service I did you was rather harsh," she added,\r\npressing the hand she held, and feeling a desire to rend it as her\r\nfingers felt its softness and delicacy, "it shall at least be thorough.\r\nListen to me, I know the character of the Gars; he meant to deceive you;\r\nhe neither can nor will marry any woman except--"\r\n\r\n"Ah!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mademoiselle, he has accepted his dangerous mission to win the\r\nhand of Mademoiselle d\'Uxelles, a marriage to which his Majesty has\r\npromised his countenance."\r\n\r\n"Ah! ah!"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil added not a word to that scornful ejaculation.\r\nThe young and handsome Chevalier du Vissard, eager to be forgiven for\r\nthe joke which had led to the insults at La Vivetiere, now came up to\r\nher and respectfully invited her to dance. She placed her hand in his,\r\nand they took their places in a quadrille opposite to Madame du Gua. The\r\ngowns of the royalist women, which recalled the fashions of the exiled\r\ncourt, and their creped and powdered hair seemed absurd as soon as they\r\nwere contrasted with the attire which republican fashions authorized\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil to wear. This attire, which was elegant, rich,\r\nand yet severe, was loudly condemned but inwardly envied by all the\r\nwomen present. The men could not restrain their admiration for the\r\nbeauty of her natural hair and the adjustment of a dress the charm of\r\nwhich was in the proportions of the form which it revealed.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the marquis and the count re-entered the ballroom behind\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, who did not turn her head. If a mirror had not\r\nbeen there to inform her of Montauran\'s presence, she would have\r\nknown it from Madame du Gua\'s face, which scarcely concealed, under an\r\napparently indifferent air, the impatience with which she awaited the\r\nconflict which must, sooner or later, take place between the lovers.\r\nThough the marquis talked with the count and other persons, he heard\r\nthe remarks of all the dancers who from time to time in the mazes of the\r\nquadrille took the place of Mademoiselle de Verneuil and her partner.\r\n\r\n"Positively, madame, she came alone," said one.\r\n\r\n"She must be a bold woman," replied the lady.\r\n\r\n"If I were dressed like that I should feel myself naked," said another\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the gown is not decent, certainly," replied her partner; "but it is\r\nso becoming, and she is so handsome."\r\n\r\n"I am ashamed to look at such perfect dancing, for her sake; isn\'t it\r\nexactly that of an opera girl?" said the envious woman.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose that she has come here to intrigue for the First\r\nConsul?" said another.\r\n\r\n"A joke if she has," replied the partner.\r\n\r\n"Well, she can\'t offer innocence as a dowry," said the lady, laughing.\r\n\r\nThe Gars turned abruptly to see the lady who uttered this sarcasm, and\r\nMadame du Gua looked at him as if to say, "You see what people think of\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Madame," said the count, laughing, "so far, it is only women who have\r\ntaken her innocence away from her."\r\n\r\nThe marquis privately forgave the count. When he ventured to look at his\r\nmistress, whose beauty was, like that of most women, brought into relief\r\nby the light of the wax candles, she turned her back upon him as she\r\nresumed her place, and went on talking to her partner in a way to let\r\nthe marquis hear the sweetest and most caressing tones of her voice.\r\n\r\n"The First Consul sends dangerous ambassadors," her partner was saying.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," she replied, "you all said that at La Vivetiere."\r\n\r\n"You have the memory of a king," replied he, disconcerted at his own\r\nawkwardness.\r\n\r\n"To forgive injuries one must needs remember them," she said quickly,\r\nrelieving his embarrassment with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Are we all included in that amnesty?" said the marquis, approaching\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut she darted away in the dance, with the gaiety of a child, leaving\r\nhim without an answer. He watched her coldly and sadly; she saw it, and\r\nbent her head with one of those coquettish motions which the graceful\r\nlines of her throat enabled her to make, omitting no movement or\r\nattitude which could prove to him the perfection of her figure. She\r\nattracted him like hope, and eluded him like a memory. To see her thus\r\nwas to desire to possess her at any cost. She knew that, and the\r\nsense it gave her of her own beauty shed upon her whole person an\r\ninexpressible charm. The marquis felt the storm of love, of rage, of\r\nmadness, rising in his heart; he wrung the count\'s hand violently, and\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\n"Is he gone?" said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, returning to her place.\r\n\r\nThe count gave her a glance and passed into the next room, from which he\r\npresently returned accompanied by the Gars.\r\n\r\n"He is mine!" she thought, observing his face in the mirror.\r\n\r\nShe received the young leader with a displeased air and said nothing,\r\nbut she smiled as she turned away from him; he was so superior to all\r\nabout him that she was proud of being able to rule him; and obeying an\r\ninstinct which sways all women more or less, she resolved to let him\r\nknow the value of a few gracious words by making him pay dear for them.\r\nAs soon as the quadrille was over, all the gentlemen who had been at\r\nLa Vivetiere surrounded Mademoiselle de Verneuil, wishing by their\r\nflattering attentions to obtain her pardon for the mistake they had\r\nmade; but he whom she longed to see at her feet did not approach the\r\ncircle over which she now reigned a queen.\r\n\r\n"He thinks I still love him," she thought, "and does not wish to be\r\nconfounded with mere flatterers."\r\n\r\nShe refused to dance again. Then, as if the ball were given for her, she\r\nwalked about on the arm of the Comte de Bauvan, to whom she was pleased\r\nto show some familiarity. The affair at La Vivetiere was by this time\r\nknown to all present, thanks to Madame du Gua, and the lovers were the\r\nobject of general attention. The marquis dared not again address his\r\nmistress; a sense of the wrong he had done her and the violence of his\r\nreturning passion made her seem to him actually terrible. On her side\r\nMarie watched his apparently calm face while she seemed to be observing\r\nthe ball.\r\n\r\n"It is fearfully hot here," she said to the count. "Take me to the other\r\nside where I can breathe; I am stifling here."\r\n\r\nAnd she motioned towards a small room where a few card-players were\r\nassembled. The marquis followed her. He ventured to hope she had left\r\nthe crowd to receive him, and this supposed favor roused his passion to\r\nextreme violence; for his love had only increased through the resistance\r\nhe had made to it during the last few days. Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nstill tormented him; her eyes, so soft and velvety for the count, were\r\nhard and stern when, as if by accident, they met his. Montauran at last\r\nmade a painful effort and said, in a muffled voice, "Will you never\r\nforgive me?"\r\n\r\n"Love forgives nothing, or it forgives all," she said, coldly. "But,"\r\nshe added, noticing his joyful look, "it must be love."\r\n\r\nShe took the count\'s arm once more and moved forward into a small\r\nboudoir which adjoined the cardroom. The marquis followed her.\r\n\r\n"Will you not hear me?" he said.\r\n\r\n"One would really think, monsieur," she replied, "that I had come here\r\nto meet you, and not to vindicate my own self-respect. If you do not\r\ncease this odious pursuit I shall leave the ballroom."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he cried, recollecting one of the crazy actions of the last Duc de\r\nLorraine, "let me speak to you so long as I can hold this live coal in\r\nmy hand."\r\n\r\nHe stooped to the hearth and picking up a brand held it tightly.\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil flushed, took her arm from that of the count,\r\nand looked at the marquis in amazement. The count softly withdrew,\r\nleaving them alone together. So crazy an action shook Marie\'s heart, for\r\nthere is nothing so persuasive in love as courageous folly.\r\n\r\n"You only prove to me," she said, trying to make him throw away the\r\nbrand, "that you are willing to make me suffer cruelly. You are extreme\r\nin everything. On the word of a fool and the slander of a woman you\r\nsuspected that one who had just saved your life was capable of betraying\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, smiling, "I have been very cruel to you; but\r\nnevertheless, forget it; I shall never forget it. Hear me. I have been\r\nshamefully deceived; but so many circumstances on that fatal day told\r\nagainst you--"\r\n\r\n"And those circumstances were stronger than your love?"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated; she made a motion of contempt, and rose.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Marie. I shall never cease to believe in you now."\r\n\r\n"Then throw that fire away. You are mad. Open your hand; I insist upon\r\nit."\r\n\r\nHe took delight in still resisting the soft efforts of her fingers, but\r\nshe succeeded in opening the hand she would fain have kissed.\r\n\r\n"What good did that do you?" she said, as she tore her handkerchief and\r\nlaid it on the burn, which the marquis covered with his glove.\r\n\r\nMadame du Gua had stolen softly into the cardroom, watching the lovers\r\nwith furtive eyes, but escaping theirs adroitly; it was, however,\r\nimpossible for her to understand their conversation from their actions.\r\n\r\n"If all that they said of me was true you must admit that I am avenged\r\nat this moment," said Marie, with a look of malignity which startled the\r\nmarquis.\r\n\r\n"What feeling brought you here?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose, my dear friend, that you can despise a woman like me\r\nwith impunity? I came here for your sake and for my own," she continued,\r\nafter a pause, laying her hand on the hilt of rubies in her bosom and\r\nshowing him the blade of her dagger.\r\n\r\n"What does all that mean?" thought Madame du Gua.\r\n\r\n"But," she continued, "you still love me; at any rate, you desire me,\r\nand the folly you have just committed," she added, taking his hand,\r\n"proves it to me. I will again be that I desired to be; and I return to\r\nFougeres happy. Love absolves everything. You love me; I have regained\r\nthe respect of the man who represents to me the whole world, and I can\r\ndie."\r\n\r\n"Then you still love me?" said the marquis.\r\n\r\n"Have I said so?" she replied with a scornful look, delighting in the\r\ntorture she was making him endure. "I have run many risks to come here.\r\nI have saved Monsieur de Bauvan\'s life, and he, more grateful than\r\nothers, offers me in return his fortune and his name. You have never\r\neven thought of doing that."\r\n\r\nThe marquis, bewildered by these words, stifled the worst anger he had\r\never felt, supposing that the count had played him false. He made no\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you reflect," she said, bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," replied the young man, "your doubts justify mine."\r\n\r\n"Let us leave this room," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, catching sight\r\nof a corner of Madame du Gua\'s gown, and rising. But the wish to reduce\r\nher rival to despair was too strong, and she made no further motion to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to drive me to hell?" cried the marquis, seizing her hand\r\nand pressing it violently.\r\n\r\n"Did you not drive me to hell five days ago? are you not leaving me at\r\nthis very moment uncertain whether your love is sincere or not?"\r\n\r\n"But how do I know whether your revenge may not lead you to obtain my\r\nlife to tarnish it, instead of killing me?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! you do not love me! you think of yourself and not of me!" she said\r\nangrily, shedding a few tears.\r\n\r\nThe coquettish creature well knew the power of her eyes when moistened\r\nby tears.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," he cried, beside himself, "take my life, but dry those\r\ntears."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my love! my love!" she exclaimed in a stifled voice: "those are the\r\nwords, the accents, the looks I have longed for, to allow me to prefer\r\nyour happiness to mine. But," she added, "I ask one more proof of your\r\nlove, which you say is so great. I wish to stay here only so long as may\r\nbe needed to show the company that you are mine. I will not even drink\r\na glass of water in the house of a woman who has twice tried to kill me,\r\nwho is now, perhaps, plotting mischief against us," and she showed the\r\nmarquis the floating corner of Madame du Gua\'s drapery. Then she dried\r\nher eyes and put her lips to the ear of the young man, who quivered as\r\nhe felt the caress of her warm breath. "See that everything is prepared\r\nfor my departure," she said; "you shall take me yourself to Fougeres and\r\nthere only will I tell you if I love you. For the second time I trust\r\nyou. Will you trust me a second time?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Marie, you have brought me to a point where I know not what I do. I\r\nam intoxicated by your words, your looks, by you--by you, and I am ready\r\nto obey you."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, make me for an instant very happy. Let me enjoy the only\r\ntriumph I desire. I want to breathe freely, to drink of the life I have\r\ndreamed, to feed my illusions before they are gone forever. Come--come\r\ninto the ballroom and dance with me."\r\n\r\nThey re-entered the room together, and though Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nwas as completely satisfied in heart and vanity as any woman ever could\r\nbe, the unfathomable gentleness of her eyes, the demure smile on her\r\nlips, the rapidity of the motions of a gay dance, kept the secret of her\r\nthoughts as the sea swallows those of the criminal who casts a weighted\r\nbody into its depths. But a murmur of admiration ran through the company\r\nas, circling in each other\'s arms, voluptuously interlaced, with heavy\r\nheads, and dimmed sight, they waltzed with a sort of frenzy, dreaming of\r\nthe pleasures they hoped to find in a future union.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Mademoiselle de Verneuil and the marquis were in\r\nthe latter\'s travelling-carriage drawn by four horses. Surprised to\r\nsee these enemies hand in hand, and evidently understanding each other,\r\nFrancine kept silence, not daring to ask her mistress whether her\r\nconduct was that of treachery or love. Thanks to the darkness, the\r\nmarquis did not observe Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s agitation as\r\nthey neared Fougeres. The first flush of dawn showed the towers of\r\nSaint-Leonard in the distance. At that moment Marie was saying to\r\nherself: "I am going to my death."\r\n\r\nAs they ascended the first hill the lovers had the same thought; they\r\nleft the carriage and mounted the rise on foot, in memory of their first\r\nmeeting. When Marie took the young man\'s arm she thanked him by a smile\r\nfor respecting her silence; then, as they reached the summit of the\r\nplateau and looked at Fougeres, she threw off her reverie.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t come any farther," she said; "my authority cannot save you from\r\nthe Blues to-day."\r\n\r\nMontauran showed some surprise. She smiled sadly and pointed to a block\r\nof granite, as if to tell him to sit down, while she herself stood\r\nbefore him in a melancholy attitude. The rending emotions of her soul no\r\nlonger permitted her to play a part. At that moment she would have knelt\r\non red-hot coals without feeling them any more than the marquis had felt\r\nthe fire-brand he had taken in his hand to prove the strength of his\r\npassion. It was not until she had contemplated her lover with a look of\r\nthe deepest anguish that she said to him, at last:--\r\n\r\n"All that you have suspected of me is true."\r\n\r\nThe marquis started.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I pray you," she said, clasping her hands, "listen to me without\r\ninterruption. I am indeed the daughter of the Duc de Verneuil,--but his\r\nnatural daughter. My mother, a Demoiselle de Casteran, who became a nun\r\nto escape the reproaches of her family, expiated her fault by fifteen\r\nyears of sorrow, and died at Seez, where she was abbess. On her\r\ndeath-bed she implored, for the first time and only for me, the help of\r\nthe man who had betrayed her, for she knew she was leaving me without\r\nfriends, without fortune, without a future. The duke accepted the\r\ncharge, and took me from the roof of Francine\'s mother, who had hitherto\r\ntaken care of me; perhaps he liked me because I was beautiful; possibly\r\nI reminded him of his youth. He was one of those great lords of the\r\nold regime, who took pride in showing how they could get their crimes\r\nforgiven by committing them with grace. I will say no more, he was my\r\nfather. But let me explain to you how my life in Paris injured my soul.\r\nThe society of the Duc de Verneuil, to which he introduced me, was\r\nbitten by that scoffing philosophy about which all France was\r\nthen enthusiastic because it was wittily professed. The brilliant\r\nconversations which charmed my ear were marked by subtlety of perception\r\nand by witty contempt for all that was true and spiritual. Men laughed\r\nat sentiments, and pictured them all the better because they did\r\nnot feel them; their satirical epigrams were as fascinating as the\r\nlight-hearted humor with which they could put a whole adventure into\r\na word; and yet they had sometimes too much wit, and wearied women by\r\nmaking love an art, and not a matter of feeling. I could not resist the\r\ntide. And yet my soul was too ardent--forgive this pride--not to feel\r\nthat their minds had withered their hearts; and the life I led resulted\r\nin a perpetual struggle between my natural feelings and beliefs and the\r\nvicious habits of mind which I there contracted. Several superior men\r\ntook pleasure in developing in me that liberty of thought and contempt\r\nfor public opinion which do tear from a woman her modesty of soul,\r\nrobbed of which she loses her charm. Alas! my subsequent misfortunes\r\nhave failed to lessen the faults I learned through opulence. My father,"\r\nshe continued, with a sigh, "the Duc de Verneuil, died, after duly\r\nrecognizing me as his daughter and making provisions for me by his will,\r\nwhich considerably reduced the fortune of my brother, his legitimate\r\nson. I found myself one day without a home and without a protector. My\r\nbrother contested the will which made me rich. Three years of my late\r\nlife had developed my vanity. By satisfying all my fancies my father\r\nhad created in my nature a need of luxury, and given me habits of\r\nself-indulgence of which my own mind, young and artless as it then was,\r\ncould not perceive either the danger or the tyranny. A friend of my\r\nfather, the Marechal Duc de Lenoncourt, then seventy years old, offered\r\nto become my guardian, and I found myself, soon after the termination of\r\nthe odious suit, in a brilliant home, where I enjoyed all the advantages\r\nof which my brother\'s cruelty had deprived me. Every evening the old\r\nmarechal came to sit with me and comfort me with kind and consoling\r\nwords. His white hair and the many proofs he gave me of paternal\r\ntenderness led me to turn all the feelings of my heart upon him, and\r\nI felt myself his daughter. I accepted his presents, hiding none of my\r\ncaprices from him, for I saw how he loved to gratify them. I heard one\r\nfatal evening that all Paris believed me the mistress of the poor old\r\nman. I was told that it was then beyond my power to recover an innocence\r\nthus gratuitously denied me. They said that the man who had abused my\r\ninexperience could not be lover, and would not be my husband. The week\r\nin which I made this horrible discovery the duke left Paris. I was\r\nshamefully ejected from the house where he had placed me, and which did\r\nnot belong to him. Up to this point I have told you the truth as though\r\nI stood before God; but now, do not ask a wretched woman to give account\r\nof sufferings which are buried in her heart. The time came when I found\r\nmyself married to Danton. A few days later the storm uprooted the mighty\r\noak around which I had thrown my arms. Again I was plunged into the\r\nworst distress, and I resolved to kill myself. I don\'t know whether\r\nlove of life, or the hope of wearying ill-fortune and of finding at\r\nthe bottom of the abyss the happiness which had always escaped me were,\r\nunconsciously to myself, my advisers, or whether I was fascinated by the\r\narguments of a young man from Vendome, who, for the last two years, has\r\nwound himself about me like a serpent round a tree,--in short, I know\r\nnot how it is that I accepted, for a payment of three hundred thousand\r\nfrancs, the odious mission of making an unknown man fall in love with\r\nme and then betraying him. I met you; I knew you at once by one of\r\nthose presentiments which never mislead us; yet I tried to doubt my\r\nrecognition, for the more I came to love you, the more the certainty\r\nappalled me. When I saved you from the hands of Hulot, I abjured the\r\npart I had taken; I resolved to betray the slaughterers, and not\r\ntheir victim. I did wrong to play with men, with their lives, their\r\nprinciples, with myself, like a thoughtless girl who sees only\r\nsentiments in this life. I believed you loved me; I let myself cling to\r\nthe hope that my life might begin anew; but all things have revealed my\r\npast,--even I myself, perhaps, for you must have distrusted a woman so\r\npassionate as you have found me. Alas! is there no excuse for my love\r\nand my deception? My life was like a troubled sleep; I woke and thought\r\nmyself a girl; I was in Alencon, where all my memories were pure and\r\nchaste. I had the mad simplicity to think that love would baptize me\r\ninto innocence. For a moment I thought myself pure, for I had never\r\nloved. But last night your passion seemed to me true, and a voice\r\ncried to me, \'Do not deceive him.\' Monsieur le marquis," she said, in a\r\nguttural voice which haughtily challenged condemnation, "know this; I am\r\na dishonored creature, unworthy of you. From this hour I accept my fate\r\nas a lost woman. I am weary of playing a part,--the part of a woman to\r\nwhom you had brought back the sanctities of her soul. Virtue is a burden\r\nto me. I should despise you if you were weak enough to marry me. The\r\nComte de Bauvan might commit that folly, but you--you must be worthy of\r\nyour future and leave me without regret. A courtesan is too exacting; I\r\nshould not love you like the simple, artless girl who felt for a moment\r\nthe delightful hope of being your companion, of making you happy, of\r\ndoing you honor, of becoming a noble wife. But I gather from that futile\r\nhope the courage to return to a life of vice and infamy, that I may put\r\nan eternal barrier between us. I sacrifice both honor and fortune\r\nto you. The pride I take in that sacrifice will support me in my\r\nwretchedness,--fate may dispose of me as it will. I will never betray\r\nyou. I shall return to Paris. There your name will be to me a part of\r\nmyself, and the glory you win will console my grief. As for you, you are\r\na man, and you will forget me. Farewell."\r\n\r\nShe darted away in the direction of the gorges of Saint-Sulpice, and\r\ndisappeared before the marquis could rise to detain her. But she came\r\nback unseen, hid herself in a cavity of the rocks, and examined the\r\nyoung man with a curiosity mingled with doubt. Presently she saw him\r\nwalking like a man overwhelmed, without seeming to know where he went.\r\n\r\n"Can he be weak?" she thought, when he had disappeared, and she felt\r\nshe was parted from him. "Will he understand me?" She quivered. Then\r\nshe turned and went rapidly towards Fougeres, as though she feared the\r\nmarquis might follow her into the town, where certain death awaited him.\r\n\r\n"Francine, what did he say to you?" she asked, when the faithful girl\r\nrejoined her.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Marie, how I pitied him. You great ladies stab a man with your\r\ntongues."\r\n\r\n"How did he seem when he came up to you?"\r\n\r\n"As if he saw me not at all! Oh, Marie, he loves you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he loves me, or he does not love me--there is heaven or hell for\r\nme in that," she answered. "Between the two extremes there is no spot\r\nwhere I can set my foot."\r\n\r\nAfter thus carrying out her resolution, Marie gave way to grief, and her\r\nface, beautified till then by these conflicting sentiments, changed\r\nfor the worse so rapidly that in a single day, during which she floated\r\nincessantly between hope and despair, she lost the glow of beauty, and\r\nthe freshness which has its source in the absence of passion or the\r\nardor of joy. Anxious to ascertain the result of her mad enterprise,\r\nHulot and Corentin came to see her soon after her return. She received\r\nthem smiling.\r\n\r\n"Well," she said to the commandant, whose care-worn face had a\r\nquestioning expression, "the fox is coming within range of your guns;\r\nyou will soon have a glorious triumph over him."\r\n\r\n"What happened?" asked Corentin, carelessly, giving Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil one of those oblique glances with which diplomatists of his\r\nclass spy on thought.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she said, "the Gars is more in love than ever; I made him come\r\nwith me to the gates of Fougeres."\r\n\r\n"Your power seems to have stopped there," remarked Corentin; "the fears\r\nof your _ci-devant_ are greater than the love you inspire."\r\n\r\n"You judge him by yourself," she replied, with a contemptuous look.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said he, unmoved, "why did you not bring him here to your\r\nown house?"\r\n\r\n"Commandant," she said to Hulot, with a coaxing smile, "if he really\r\nloves me, would you blame me for saving his life and getting him to\r\nleave France?"\r\n\r\nThe old soldier came quickly up to her, took her hand, and kissed it\r\nwith a sort of enthusiasm. Then he looked at her fixedly and said in a\r\ngloomy tone: "You forget my two friends and my sixty-three men."\r\n\r\n"Ah, commandant," she cried, with all the naivete of passion, "he was\r\nnot accountable for that; he was deceived by a bad woman, Charette\'s\r\nmistress, who would, I do believe, drink the blood of the Blues."\r\n\r\n"Come, Marie," said Corentin, "don\'t tease the commandant; he does not\r\nunderstand such jokes."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue," she answered, "and remember that the day when you\r\ndisplease me too much will have no morrow for you."\r\n\r\n"I see, mademoiselle," said Hulot, without bitterness, "that I must\r\nprepare for a fight."\r\n\r\n"You are not strong enough, my dear colonel. I saw more than six\r\nthousand men at Saint-James,--regular troops, artillery, and English\r\nofficers. But they cannot do much unless _he_ leads them? I agree with\r\nFouche, his presence is the head and front of everything."\r\n\r\n"Are we to get his head?--that\'s the point," said Corentin, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she answered, carelessly.\r\n\r\n"English officers!" cried Hulot, angrily, "that\'s all that was wanting\r\nto make a regular brigand of him. Ha! ha! I\'ll give him English, I\r\nwill!"\r\n\r\n"It seems to me, citizen-diplomat," said Hulot to Corentin, after the\r\ntwo had taken leave and were at some distance from the house, "that you\r\nallow that girl to send you to the right-about when she pleases."\r\n\r\n"It is quite natural for you, commandant," replied Corentin, with a\r\nthoughtful air, "to see nothing but fighting in what she said to us. You\r\nsoldiers never seem to know there are various ways of making war. To use\r\nthe passions of men and women like wires to be pulled for the benefit\r\nof the State; to keep the running-gear of the great machine we call\r\ngovernment in good order, and fasten to it the desires of human nature,\r\nlike baited traps which it is fun to watch,--I call _that_ creating a\r\nworld, like God, and putting ourselves at the centre of it!"\r\n\r\n"You will please allow me to prefer my calling to yours," said the\r\nsoldier, curtly. "You can do as you like with your running-gear; I\r\nrecognize no authority but that of the minister of war. I have my\r\norders; I shall take the field with veterans who don\'t skulk, and face\r\nan enemy you want to catch behind."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you can fight if you want to," replied Corentin. "From what that\r\ngirl has dropped, close-mouthed as you think she is, I can tell you that\r\nyou\'ll have to skirmish about, and I myself will give you the pleasure\r\nof an interview with the Gars before long."\r\n\r\n"How so?" asked Hulot, moving back a step to get a better view of this\r\nstrange individual.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle de Verneuil is in love with him," replied Corentin, in\r\na thick voice, "and perhaps he loves her. A marquis, a knight\r\nof Saint-Louis, young, brilliant, perhaps rich,--what a list of\r\ntemptations! She would be foolish indeed not to look after her own\r\ninterests and try to marry him rather than betray him. The girl is\r\nattempting to fool us. But I saw hesitation in her eyes. They probably\r\nhave a rendezvous; perhaps they\'ve met already. Well, to-morrow I shall\r\nhave him by the forelock. Yesterday he was nothing more than the enemy\r\nof the Republic, to-day he is mine; and I tell you this, every man who\r\nhas been so rash as to come between that girl and me has died upon the\r\nscaffold."\r\n\r\nSo saying, Corentin dropped into a reverie which hindered him from\r\nobserving the disgust on the face of the honest soldier as he discovered\r\nthe depths of this intrigue, and the mechanism of the means employed by\r\nFouche. Hulot resolved on the spot to thwart Corentin in every way that\r\ndid not conflict essentially with the success of the government, and to\r\ngive the Gars a fair chance of dying honorably, sword in hand, before\r\nhe could fall a prey to the executioner, for whom this agent of the\r\ndetective police acknowledged himself the purveyor.\r\n\r\n"If the First Consul would listen to me," thought Hulot, as he turned\r\nhis back on Corentin, "he would leave those foxes to fight aristocrats,\r\nand send his solders on other business."\r\n\r\nCorentin looked coldly after the old soldier, whose face had brightened\r\nat the resolve, and his eyes gleamed with a sardonic expression, which\r\nshowed the mental superiority of this subaltern Machiavelli.\r\n\r\n"Give an ell of blue cloth to those fellows, and hang a bit of iron at\r\ntheir waists," he said to himself, "and they\'ll think there\'s but one\r\nway to kill people." Then, after walking up and down awhile very slowly,\r\nhe exclaimed suddenly, "Yes, the time has come, that woman shall be\r\nmine! For five years I\'ve been drawing the net round her, and I have\r\nher now; with her, I can be a greater man in the government than Fouche\r\nhimself. Yes, if she loses the only man she has ever loved, grief will\r\ngive her to me, body and soul; but I must be on the watch night and\r\nday."\r\n\r\nA few moments later the pale face of this man might have been seen\r\nthrough the window of a house, from which he could observe all who\r\nentered the cul-de-sac formed by the line of houses running parallel\r\nwith Saint-Leonard, one of those houses being that now occupied by\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil. With the patience of a cat watching a mouse\r\nCorentin was there in the same place on the following morning, attentive\r\nto the slightest noise, and subjecting the passers-by to the closest\r\nexamination. The day that was now beginning was a market-day. Although\r\nin these calamitous times the peasants rarely risked themselves in\r\nthe towns, Corentin presently noticed a small man with a gloomy face,\r\nwrapped in a goatskin, and carrying on his arm a small flat basket; he\r\nwas making his way in the direction of Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s house,\r\ncasting careless glances about him. Corentin watched him enter the\r\nhouse; then he ran down into the street, meaning to waylay the man as\r\nhe left; but on second thoughts it occurred to him that if he called\r\nunexpectedly on Mademoiselle de Verneuil he might surprise by a single\r\nglance the secret that was hidden in the basket of the emissary.\r\nBesides, he had already learned that it was impossible to extract\r\nanything from the inscrutable answers of Bretons and Normans.\r\n\r\n"Galope-Chopine!" cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil, when Francine brought\r\nthe man to her. "Does he love me?" she murmured to herself, in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe instinctive hope sent a brilliant color to her cheeks and joy into\r\nher heart. Galope-Chopine looked alternately from the mistress to the\r\nmaid with evident distrust of the latter; but a sign from Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil reassured him.\r\n\r\n"Madame," he said, "about two o\'clock _he_ will be at my house waiting\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\nEmotion prevented Mademoiselle de Verneuil from giving any other reply\r\nthan a movement of her head, but the man understood her meaning. At\r\nthat moment Corentin\'s step was heard in the adjoining room, but\r\nGalope-Chopine showed no uneasiness, though Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s\r\nlook and shudder warned him of danger, and as soon as the spy had\r\nentered the room the Chouan raised his voice to an ear-splitting tone.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha!" he said to Francine, "I tell you there\'s Breton butter _and_\r\nBreton butter. You want the Gibarry kind, and you won\'t give more than\r\neleven sous a pound; then why did you send me to fetch it? It is good\r\nbutter that," he added, uncovering the basket to show the pats which\r\nBarbette had made. "You ought to be fair, my good lady, and pay one sou\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nHis hollow voice betrayed no emotion, and his green eyes, shaded by\r\nthick gray eyebrows, bore Corentin\'s piercing glance without flinching.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, my good man, you are not here to sell butter; you are talking\r\nto a lady who never bargained for a thing in her life. The trade you\r\nrun, old fellow, will shorten you by a head in a very few days"; and\r\nCorentin, with a friendly tap on the man\'s shoulder, added, "you can\'t\r\nkeep up being a spy of the Blues and a spy of the Chouans very long."\r\n\r\nGalope-Chopine needed all his presence of mind to subdue his rage,\r\nand not deny the accusation which his avarice had made a just one. He\r\ncontented himself with saying:--\r\n\r\n"Monsieur is making game of me."\r\n\r\nCorentin turned his back on the Chouan, but, while bowing to\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, whose heart stood still, he watched him in\r\nthe mirror behind her. Galope-Chopine, unaware of this, gave a glance\r\nto Francine, to which she replied by pointing to the door, and saying,\r\n"Come with me, my man, and we will settle the matter between us."\r\n\r\nNothing escaped Corentin, neither the fear which Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil could not conceal under a smile, nor her color and the\r\ncontraction of her features, nor the Chouan\'s sign and Francine\'s reply;\r\nhe had seen all. Convinced that Galope-Chopine was sent by the marquis,\r\nhe caught the man by the long hairs of his goatskin as he was leaving\r\nthe room, turned him round to face him, and said with a keen look:\r\n"Where do you live, my man? I want butter, too."\r\n\r\n"My good monsieur," said the Chouan, "all Fougeres knows where I live. I\r\nam--"\r\n\r\n"Corentin!" exclaimed Mademoiselle de Verneuil, interrupting\r\nGalope-Chopine. "Why do you come here at this time of day? I am scarcely\r\ndressed. Let that peasant alone; he does not understand your tricks any\r\nmore than I understand the motive of them. You can go, my man."\r\n\r\nGalope-Chopine hesitated a moment. The indecision, real or feigned, of\r\nthe poor devil, who knew not which to obey, deceived even Corentin; but\r\nthe Chouan, finally, after an imperative gesture from the lady, left the\r\nroom with a dragging step. Mademoiselle de Verneuil and Corentin looked\r\nat each other in silence. This time Marie\'s limpid eyes could not endure\r\nthe gleam of cruel fire in the man\'s look. The resolute manner in which\r\nthe spy had forced his way into her room, an expression on his face\r\nwhich Marie had never seen there before, the deadened tones of his\r\nshrill voice, his whole demeanor,--all these things alarmed her; she\r\nfelt that a secret struggle was about to take place between them,\r\nand that he meant to employ against her all the powers of his evil\r\ninfluence. But though she had at this moment a full and distinct view\r\nof the gulf into which she was plunging, she gathered strength from her\r\nlove to shake off the icy chill of these presentiments.\r\n\r\n"Corentin," she said, with a sort of gayety, "I hope you are going to\r\nlet me make my toilet?"\r\n\r\n"Marie," he said,--"yes, permit me to call you so,--you don\'t yet know\r\nme. Listen; a much less sagacious man than I would see your love for\r\nthe Marquis de Montauran. I have several times offered you my heart\r\nand hand. You have never thought me worthy of you; and perhaps you are\r\nright. But however much you may feel yourself too high, too beautiful,\r\ntoo superior for me, I can compel you to come down to my level. My\r\nambition and my maxims have given you a low opinion of me; frankly, you\r\nare mistaken. Men are not worth even what I rate them at, and that is\r\nnext to nothing. I shall certainly attain a position which will gratify\r\nyour pride. Who will ever love you better, or make you more absolutely\r\nmistress of yourself and of him, than the man who has loved you now for\r\nfive years? Though I run the risk of exciting your suspicions,--for you\r\ncannot conceive that any one should renounce an idolized woman out\r\nof excessive love,--I will now prove to you the unselfishness of my\r\npassion. If the marquis loves you, marry him; but before you do so, make\r\nsure of his sincerity. I could not endure to see you deceived, for I do\r\nprefer your happiness to my own. My resolution may surprise you; lay\r\nit to the prudence of a man who is not so great a fool as to wish to\r\npossess a woman against her will. I blame myself, not you, for the\r\nfailure of my efforts to win you. I hoped to do so by submission and\r\ndevotion, for I have long, as you well know, tried to make you happy\r\naccording to my lights; but you have never in any way rewarded me."\r\n\r\n"I have suffered you to be near me," she said, haughtily.\r\n\r\n"Add that you regret it."\r\n\r\n"After involving me in this infamous enterprise, do you think that I\r\nhave any thanks to give you?"\r\n\r\n"When I proposed to you an enterprise which was not exempt from blame to\r\ntimid minds," he replied, audaciously, "I had only your own prosperity\r\nin view. As for me, whether I succeed or fail, I can make all results\r\nfurther my ends. If you marry Montauran, I shall be delighted to serve\r\nthe Bourbons in Paris, where I am already a member of the Clichy club.\r\nNow, if circumstances were to put me in correspondence with the princes\r\nI should abandon the interests of the Republic, which is already on its\r\nlast legs. General Bonaparte is much too able a man not to know that he\r\ncan\'t be in England and in Italy at the same time, and that is how the\r\nRepublic is about to fall. I have no doubt he made the 18th Brumaire\r\nto obtain greater advantages over the Bourbons when it came to\r\ntreating with them. He is a long-headed fellow, and very keen; but the\r\npoliticians will get the better of him on their own ground. The betrayal\r\nof France is another scruple which men of superiority leave to fools.\r\nI won\'t conceal from you that I have come here with the necessary\r\nauthority to open negotiations with the Chouans, _or_ to further their\r\ndestruction, as the case may be; for Fouche, my patron, is deep; he\r\nhas always played a double part; during the Terror he was as much for\r\nRobespierre as for Danton--"\r\n\r\n"Whom you basely abandoned," she said.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense; he is dead,--forget him," replied Corentin. "Come, speak\r\nhonestly to me; I have set you the example. Old Hulot is deeper than\r\nhe looks; if you want to escape his vigilance, I can help you. Remember\r\nthat he holds all the valleys and will instantly detect a rendezvous. If\r\nyou make one in Fougeres, under his very eyes, you are at the mercy of\r\nhis patrols. See how quickly he knew that this Chouan had entered your\r\nhouse. His military sagacity will show him that your movements betray\r\nthose of the Gars--if Montauran loves you."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil had never listened to a more affectionate\r\nvoice; Corentin certainly seemed sincere, and spoke confidingly. The\r\npoor girl\'s heart was so open to generous impressions that she was on\r\nthe point of betraying her secret to the serpent who had her in his\r\nfolds, when it occurred to her that she had no proof beyond his own\r\nwords of his sincerity, and she felt no scruple in blinding him.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, "you are right, Corentin. I do love the marquis, but\r\nhe does not love me--at least, I fear so; I can\'t help fearing that the\r\nappointment he wishes me to make with him is a trap."\r\n\r\n"But you said yesterday that he came as far as Fougeres with you,"\r\nreturned Corentin. "If he had meant to do you bodily harm you wouldn\'t\r\nbe here now."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve a cold heart, Corentin. You can draw shrewd conclusions as to\r\nthe ordinary events of human life, but not on those of passion.\r\nPerhaps that is why you inspire me with such repulsion. As you are\r\nso clear-sighted, you may be able to tell me why a man from whom I\r\nseparated myself violently two days ago now wishes me to meet him in a\r\nhouse at Florigny on the road to Mayenne."\r\n\r\nAt this avowal, which seemed to escape her with a recklessness that was\r\nnot unnatural in so passionate a creature, Corentin flushed, for he\r\nwas still young; but he gave her a sidelong penetrating look, trying\r\nto search her soul. The girl\'s artlessness was so well played, however,\r\nthat she deceived the spy, and he answered with crafty good-humor,\r\n"Shall I accompany you at a distance? I can take a few solders with me,\r\nand be ready to help and obey you."\r\n\r\n"Very good," she said; "but promise me, on your honor,--no, I don\'t\r\nbelieve in it; by your salvation,--but you don\'t believe in God; by your\r\nsoul,--but I don\'t suppose you have any! what pledge _can_ you give me\r\nof your fidelity? and yet you expect me to trust you, and put more than\r\nmy life--my love, my vengeance--into your hands?"\r\n\r\nThe slight smile which crossed the pallid lips of the spy showed\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil the danger she had just escaped. The man, whose\r\nnostrils contracted instead of dilating, took the hand of his victim,\r\nkissed it with every mark of the deepest respect, and left the room with\r\na bow that was not devoid of grace.\r\n\r\nThree hours after this scene Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who feared the\r\nman\'s return, left the town furtively by the Porte Saint-Leonard,\r\nand made her way through the labyrinth of paths to the cottage of\r\nGalope-Chopine, led by the dream of at last finding happiness, and also\r\nby the purpose of saving her lover from the danger that threatened him.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Corentin had gone to find the commandant. He had some\r\ndifficulty in recognizing Hulot when he found him in a little square,\r\nwhere he was busy with certain military preparations. The brave veteran\r\nhad made a sacrifice, the full merit of which may be difficult to\r\nappreciate. His queue and his moustache were cut off, and his hair had\r\na sprinkling of powder. He had changed his uniform for a goatskin, wore\r\nhobnailed shoes, a belt full of pistols, and carried a heavy carbine.\r\nIn this costume he was reviewing about two hundred of the natives of\r\nFougeres, all in the same kind of dress, which was fitted to deceive the\r\neye of the most practised Chouan. The warlike spirit of the little town\r\nand the Breton character were fully displayed in this scene, which\r\nwas not at all uncommon. Here and there a few mothers and sisters\r\nwere bringing to their sons and brothers gourds filled with brandy, or\r\nforgotten pistols. Several old men were examining into the number and\r\ncondition of the cartridges of these young national guards dressed in\r\nthe guise of Chouans, whose gaiety was more in keeping with a hunting\r\nexpedition than the dangerous duty they were undertaking. To them, such\r\nencounters with Chouannerie, where the Breton of the town fought the\r\nBreton of the country district, had taken the place of the old chivalric\r\ntournaments. This patriotic enthusiasm may possibly have been connected\r\nwith certain purchases of the "national domain." Still, the benefits\r\nof the Revolution which were better understood and appreciated in the\r\ntowns, party spirit, and a certain national delight in war, had a great\r\ndeal to do with their ardor.\r\n\r\nHulot, much gratified, was going through the ranks and getting\r\ninformation from Gudin, on whom he was now bestowing the confidence and\r\ngood-will he had formerly shown to Merle and Gerard. A number of the\r\ninhabitants stood about watching the preparations, and comparing the\r\nconduct of their tumultuous contingent with the regulars of Hulot\'s\r\nbrigade. Motionless and silent the Blues were awaiting, under control of\r\ntheir officers, the orders of the commandant, whose figure they followed\r\nwith their eyes as he passed from rank to rank of the contingent. When\r\nCorentin came near the old warrior he could not help smiling at the\r\nchange which had taken place in him. He looked like a portrait that has\r\nlittle or no resemblance to the original.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this?" asked Corentin.\r\n\r\n"Come with us under fire, and you\'ll find out," replied Hulot.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I\'m not a Fougeres man," said Corentin.\r\n\r\n"Easy to see that, citizen," retorted Gudin.\r\n\r\nA few contemptuous laughs came from the nearest ranks.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," said Corentin, sharply, "that the only way to serve\r\nFrance is with bayonets?"\r\n\r\nThen he turned his back to the laughers, and asked a woman beside him if\r\nshe knew the object of the expedition.\r\n\r\n"Hey! my good man, the Chouans are at Florigny. They say there are more\r\nthan three thousand, and they are coming to take Fougeres."\r\n\r\n"Florigny?" cried Corentin, turning white; "then the rendezvous is not\r\nthere! Is Florigny on the road to Mayenne?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"There are not two Florignys," replied the woman, pointing in the\r\ndirection of the summit of La Pelerine.\r\n\r\n"Are you going in search of the Marquis de Montauran?" said Corentin to\r\nHulot.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I am," answered the commandant, curtly.\r\n\r\n"He is not at Florigny," said Corentin. "Send your troops there by all\r\nmeans; but keep a few of those imitation Chouans of yours with you, and\r\nwait for me."\r\n\r\n"He is too malignant not to know what he\'s about," thought Hulot as\r\nCorentin made off rapidly, "he\'s the king of spies."\r\n\r\nHulot ordered the battalion to start. The republican soldiers marched\r\nwithout drums and silently through the narrow suburb which led to the\r\nMayenne high-road, forming a blue and red line among the trees and\r\nhouses. The disguised guard followed them; but Hulot, detaining Gudin\r\nand about a score of the smartest young fellows of the town, remained in\r\nthe little square, awaiting Corentin, whose mysterious manner had piqued\r\nhis curiosity. Francine herself told the astute spy, whose suspicions\r\nshe changed into certainty, of her mistress\'s departure. Inquiring of\r\nthe post guard at the Porte Saint-Leonard, he learned that Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil had passed that way. Rushing to the Promenade, he was,\r\nunfortunately, in time to see her movements. Though she was wearing a\r\ngreen dress and hood, to be less easily distinguished, the rapidity\r\nof her almost distracted step enabled him to follow her with his eye\r\nthrough the leafless hedges, and to guess the point towards which she\r\nwas hurrying.\r\n\r\n"Ha!" he cried, "you said you were going to Florigny, but you are in\r\nthe valley of Gibarry! I am a fool, she has tricked me! No matter, I can\r\nlight my lamp by day as well as by night."\r\n\r\nCorentin, satisfied that he knew the place of the lovers\' rendezvous,\r\nreturned in all haste to the little square, which Hulot, resolved not to\r\nwait any longer, was just quitting to rejoin his troops.\r\n\r\n"Halt, general!" he cried to the commandant, who turned round.\r\n\r\nHe then told Hulot the events relating to the marquis and Mademoiselle\r\nde Verneuil, and showed him the scheme of which he held a thread. Hulot,\r\nstruck by his perspicacity, seized him by the arm.\r\n\r\n"God\'s thunder! citizen, you are right," he cried. "The brigands are\r\nmaking a false attack over there to keep the coast clear; but the two\r\ncolumns I sent to scour the environs between Antrain and Vitre have not\r\nyet returned, so we shall have plenty of reinforcements if we need them;\r\nand I dare say we shall, for the Gars is not such a fool as to risk his\r\nlife without a bodyguard of those damned owls. Gudin," he added, "go and\r\ntell Captain Lebrun that he must rub those fellows\' noses at Florigny\r\nwithout me, and come back yourself in a flash. You know the paths.\r\nI\'ll wait till you return, and _then_--we\'ll avenge those murders at La\r\nVivetiere. Thunder! how he runs," he added, seeing Gudin disappear as if\r\nby magic. "Gerard would have loved him."\r\n\r\nOn his return Gudin found Hulot\'s little band increased in numbers by\r\nthe arrival of several soldiers taken from the various posts in the\r\ntown. The commandant ordered him to choose a dozen of his compatriots\r\nwho could best counterfeit the Chouans, and take them out by the Porte\r\nSaint-Leonard, so as to creep round the side of the Saint-Sulpice rocks\r\nwhich overlooks the valley of Couesnon and on which was the hovel of\r\nGalope-Chopine. Hulot himself went out with the rest of his troop by\r\nthe Porte Saint-Sulpice, to reach the summit of the same rocks, where,\r\naccording to his calculations, he ought to meet the men under Beau-Pied,\r\nwhom he meant to use as a line of sentinels from the suburb of\r\nSaint-Sulpice to the Nid-aux-Crocs.\r\n\r\nCorentin, satisfied with having delivered over the fate of the Gars to\r\nhis implacable enemies, went with all speed to the Promenade, so as to\r\nfollow with his eyes the military arrangements of the commandant. He\r\nsoon saw Gudin\'s little squad issuing from the valley of the Nancon\r\nand following the line of the rocks to the great valley, while Hulot,\r\ncreeping round the castle of Fougeres, was mounting the dangerous path\r\nwhich leads to the summit of Saint-Sulpice. The two companies were\r\ntherefore advancing on parallel lines. The trees and shrubs, draped by\r\nthe rich arabesques of the hoarfrost, threw whitish reflections which\r\nenabled the watcher to see the gray lines of the squads in motion. When\r\nHulot reached the summit of the rocks, he detached all the soldiers in\r\nuniform from his main body, and made them into a line of sentinels, each\r\ncommunicating with the other, the first with Gudin, the last with Hulot;\r\nso that no shrub could escape the bayonets of the three lines which were\r\nnow in a position to hunt the Gars across field and mountain.\r\n\r\n"The sly old wolf!" thought Corentin, as the shining muzzle of the last\r\ngun disappeared in the bushes. "The Gars is done for. If Marie had only\r\nbetrayed that damned marquis, she and I would have been united in the\r\nstrongest of all bonds--a vile deed. But she\'s mine, in any case."\r\n\r\nThe twelve young men under Gudin soon reached the base of the rocks\r\nof Saint-Sulpice. Here Gudin himself left the road with six of them,\r\njumping the stiff hedge into the first field of gorse that he came to,\r\nwhile the other six by his orders did the same on the other side of the\r\nroad. Gudin advanced to an apple-tree which happened to be in the middle\r\nof the field. Hearing the rustle of this movement through the gorse,\r\nseven or eight men, at the head of whom was Beau-Pied, hastily hid\r\nbehind some chestnut-trees which topped the bank of this particular\r\nfield. Gudin\'s men did not see them, in spite of the white reflections\r\nof the hoar-frost and their own practised sight.\r\n\r\n"Hush! here they are," said Beau-Pied, cautiously putting out his head.\r\n"The brigands have more men than we, but we have \'em at the muzzles of\r\nour guns, and we mustn\'t miss them, or, by the Lord, we are not fit to\r\nbe soldiers of the pope."\r\n\r\nBy this time Gudin\'s keen eyes had discovered a few muzzles pointing\r\nthrough the branches at his little squad. Just then eight voices cried\r\nin derision, "Qui vive?" and eight shots followed. The balls whistled\r\nround Gudin and his men. One fell, another was shot in the arm. The\r\nfive others who were safe and sound replied with a volley and the cry,\r\n"Friends!" Then they marched rapidly on their assailants so as to reach\r\nthem before they had time to reload.\r\n\r\n"We did not know how true we spoke," cried Gudin, as he recognized the\r\nuniforms and the battered hats of his own brigade. "Well, we behaved\r\nlike Bretons, and fought before explaining."\r\n\r\nThe other men were stupefied on recognizing the little company.\r\n\r\n"Who the devil would have known them in those goatskins?" cried\r\nBeau-Pied, dismally.\r\n\r\n"It is a misfortune," said Gudin, "but we are all innocent if you were\r\nnot informed of the sortie. What are you doing here?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"A dozen of those Chouans are amusing themselves by picking us off, and\r\nwe are getting away as best we can, like poisoned rats; but by dint\r\nof scrambling over these hedges and rocks--may the lightning blast\r\n\'em!--our compasses have got so rusty we are forced to take a rest. I\r\nthink those brigands are now somewhere near the old hovel where you see\r\nthat smoke."\r\n\r\n"Good!" cried Gudin. "You," he added to Beau-Pied and his men, "fall\r\nback towards the rocks through the fields, and join the line of\r\nsentinels you\'ll find there. You can\'t go with us, because you are in\r\nuniform. We mean to make an end of those curs now; the Gars is with\r\nthem. I can\'t stop to tell you more. To the right, march! and don\'t\r\nadminister any more shots to our own goatskins; you\'ll know ours by\r\ntheir cravats, which they twist round their necks and don\'t tie."\r\n\r\nGudin left his two wounded men under the apple-tree, and marched towards\r\nGalope-Chopine\'s cottage, which Beau-Pied had pointed out to him, the\r\nsmoke from the chimney serving as a guide.\r\n\r\nWhile the young officer was thus closing in upon the Chouans, the little\r\ndetachment under Hulot had reached a point still parallel with that at\r\nwhich Gudin had arrived. The old soldier, at the head of his men, was\r\nsilently gliding along the hedges with the ardor of a young man; he\r\njumped them from time to time actively enough, casting his wary eyes to\r\nthe heights and listening with the ear of a hunter to every noise. In\r\nthe third field to which he came he found a woman about thirty years\r\nold, with bent back, hoeing the ground vigorously, while a small boy\r\nwith a sickle in his hand was knocking the hoarfrost from the rushes,\r\nwhich he cut and laid in a heap. At the noise Hulot made in jumping\r\nthe hedge, the boy and his mother raised their heads. Hulot mistook\r\nthe young woman for an old one, naturally enough. Wrinkles, coming\r\nlong before their time, furrowed her face and neck; she was clothed so\r\ngrotesquely in a worn-out goatskin that if it had not been for a dirty\r\nyellow petticoat, a distinctive mark of sex, Hulot would hardly have\r\nknown the gender she belonged to; for the meshes of her long black hair\r\nwere twisted up and hidden by a red worsted cap. The tatters of the\r\nlittle boy did not cover him, but left his skin exposed.\r\n\r\n"Ho! old woman!" called Hulot, in a low voice, approaching her, "where\r\nis the Gars?"\r\n\r\nThe twenty men who accompanied Hulot now jumped the hedge.\r\n\r\n"Hey! if you want the Gars you\'ll have to go back the way you came,"\r\nsaid the woman, with a suspicious glance at the troop.\r\n\r\n"Did I ask you the road to Fougeres, old carcass?" said Hulot, roughly.\r\n"By Saint-Anne of Auray, have you seen the Gars go by?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean," replied the woman, bending over her hoe.\r\n\r\n"You damned garce, do you want to have us eaten up by the Blues who are\r\nafter us?"\r\n\r\nAt these words the woman raised her head and gave another look of\r\ndistrust at the troop as she replied, "How can the Blues be after you?\r\nI have just seen eight or ten of them who were going back to Fougeres by\r\nthe lower road."\r\n\r\n"One would think she meant to stab us with that nose of hers!" cried\r\nHulot. "Here, look, you old nanny-goat!"\r\n\r\nAnd he showed her in the distance three or four of his sentinels, whose\r\nhats, guns, and uniforms it was easy to recognize.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to let those fellows cut the throats of men who are sent\r\nby Marche-a-Terre to protect the Gars?" he cried, angrily.\r\n\r\n"Ah, beg pardon," said the woman; "but it is so easy to be deceived.\r\nWhat parish do you belong to?"\r\n\r\n"Saint-Georges," replied two or three of the men, in the Breton patois,\r\n"and we are dying of hunger."\r\n\r\n"Well, there," said the woman; "do you see that smoke down there? that\'s\r\nmy house. Follow the path to the right, and you will come to the rock\r\nabove it. Perhaps you\'ll meet my man on the way. Galope-Chopine is sure\r\nto be on watch to warn the Gars. He is spending the day in our house,"\r\nshe said, proudly, "as you seem to know."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my good woman," replied Hulot. "Forward, march! God\'s\r\nthunder! we\'ve got him," he added, speaking to his men.\r\n\r\nThe detachment followed its leader at a quick step through the path\r\npointed out to them. The wife of Galope-Chopine turned pale as she heard\r\nthe un-Catholic oath of the so-called Chouan. She looked at the gaiters\r\nand goatskins of his men, then she caught her boy in her arms, and sat\r\ndown on the ground, saying, "May the holy Virgin of Auray and the ever\r\nblessed Saint-Labre have pity upon us! Those men are not ours; their\r\nshoes have no nails in them. Run down by the lower road and warn your\r\nfather; you may save his head," she said to the boy, who disappeared\r\nlike a deer among the bushes.\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil met no one on her way, neither Blues nor\r\nChouans. Seeing the column of blue smoke which was rising from the\r\nhalf-ruined chimney of Galope-Chopine\'s melancholy dwelling, her heart\r\nwas seized with a violent palpitation, the rapid, sonorous beating of\r\nwhich rose to her throat in waves. She stopped, rested her hand against\r\na tree, and watched the smoke which was serving as a beacon to the foes\r\nas well as to the friends of the young chieftain. Never had she felt\r\nsuch overwhelming emotion.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I love him too much," she said, with a sort of despair. "To-day,\r\nperhaps, I shall no longer be mistress of myself--"\r\n\r\nShe hurried over the distance which separated her from the cottage,\r\nand reached the courtyard, the filth of which was now stiffened by the\r\nfrost. The big dog sprang up barking, but a word from Galope-Chopine\r\nsilenced him and he wagged his tail. As she entered the house Marie\r\ngave a look which included everything. The marquis was not there. She\r\nbreathed more freely, and saw with pleasure that the Chouan had taken\r\nsome pains to clean the dirty and only room in his hovel. He now took\r\nhis duck-gun, bowed silently to his guest and left the house, followed\r\nby his dog. Marie went to the threshold of the door and watched him as\r\nhe took the path to the right of his hut. From there she could overlook\r\na series of fields, the curious openings to which formed a perspective\r\nof gates; for the leafless trees and hedges were no longer a barrier to\r\na full view of the country. When the Chouan\'s broad hat was out of\r\nsight Mademoiselle de Verneuil turned round to look for the church at\r\nFougeres, but the shed concealed it. She cast her eyes over the valley\r\nof the Couesnon, which lay before her like a vast sheet of muslin, the\r\nwhiteness of which still further dulled a gray sky laden with snow. It\r\nwas one of those days when nature seems dumb and noises are absorbed by\r\nthe atmosphere. Therefore, though the Blues and their contingent were\r\nmarching through the country in three lines, forming a triangle which\r\ndrew together as they neared the cottage, the silence was so profound\r\nthat Mademoiselle de Verneuil was overcome by a presentiment which added\r\na sort of physical pain to her mental torture. Misfortune was in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAt last, in a spot where a little curtain of wood closed the perspective\r\nof gates, she saw a young man jumping the barriers like a squirrel and\r\nrunning with astonishing rapidity. "It is he!" she thought.\r\n\r\nThe Gars was dressed as a Chouan, with a musket slung from his shoulder\r\nover his goatskin, and would have been quite disguised were it not for\r\nthe grace of his movements. Marie withdrew hastily into the cottage,\r\nobeying one of those instinctive promptings which are as little\r\nexplicable as fear itself. The young man was soon beside her before the\r\nchimney, where a bright fire was burning. Both were voiceless, fearing\r\nto look at each other, or even to make a movement. One and the same hope\r\nunited them, the same doubt; it was agony, it was joy.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil at last, in a trembling voice,\r\n"your safety alone has brought me here."\r\n\r\n"My safety!" he said, bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered; "so long as I stay at Fougeres your life is\r\nthreatened, and I love you too well not to leave it. I go to-night."\r\n\r\n"Leave me! ah, dear love, I shall follow you."\r\n\r\n"Follow me!--the Blues?"\r\n\r\n"Dear Marie, what have the Blues got to do with our love?"\r\n\r\n"But it seems impossible that you can stay with me in France, and still\r\nmore impossible that you should leave it with me."\r\n\r\n"Is there anything impossible to those who love?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, true! true! all is possible--have I not the courage to resign you,\r\nfor your sake."\r\n\r\n"What! you could give yourself to a hateful being whom you did not love,\r\nand you refuse to make the happiness of a man who adores you, whose life\r\nyou fill, who swears to be yours, and yours only. Hear me, Marie, do you\r\nlove me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said.\r\n\r\n"Then be mine."\r\n\r\n"You forget the infamous career of a lost woman; I return to it, I leave\r\nyou--yes, that I may not bring upon your head the contempt that falls on\r\nmine. Without that fear, perhaps--"\r\n\r\n"But if I fear nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Can I be sure of that? I am distrustful. Who could be otherwise in\r\na position like mine? If the love we inspire cannot last at least it\r\nshould be complete, and help us to bear with joy the injustice of the\r\nworld. But you, what have you done for me? You desire me. Do you think\r\nthat lifts you above other men? Suppose I bade you renounce your ideas,\r\nyour hopes, your king (who will, perhaps, laugh when he hears you have\r\ndied for him, while I would die for you with sacred joy!); or suppose I\r\nshould ask you to send your submission to the First Consul so that you\r\ncould follow me to Paris, or go with me to America,--away from the world\r\nwhere all is vanity; suppose I thus tested you, to know if you loved\r\nme for myself as at this moment I love you? To say all in a word, if I\r\nwished, instead of rising to your level, that you should fall to mine,\r\nwhat would you do?"\r\n\r\n"Hush, Marie, be silent, do not slander yourself," he cried. "Poor\r\nchild, I comprehend you. If my first desire was passion, my passion now\r\nis love. Dear soul of my soul, you are as noble as your name, I know\r\nit,--as great as you are beautiful. I am noble enough, I feel myself\r\ngreat enough to force the world to receive you. Is it because I foresee\r\nin you the source of endless, incessant pleasure, or because I find in\r\nyour soul those precious qualities which make a man forever love the one\r\nwoman? I do not know the cause, but this I know--that my love for you is\r\nboundless. I know I can no longer live without you. Yes, life would be\r\nunbearable unless you are ever with me."\r\n\r\n"Ever with you!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! Marie, will you not understand me?"\r\n\r\n"You think to flatter me by the offer of your hand and name," she said,\r\nwith apparent haughtiness, but looking fixedly at the marquis as if to\r\ndetect his inmost thought. "How do you know you would love me six months\r\nhence? and then what would be my fate? No, a mistress is the only woman\r\nwho is sure of a man\'s heart; duty, law, society, the interests of\r\nchildren, are poor auxiliaries. If her power lasts it gives her joys and\r\nflatteries which make the trials of life endurable. But to be your wife\r\nand become a drag upon you,--rather than that, I prefer a passing love\r\nand a true one, though death and misery be its end. Yes, I could be a\r\nvirtuous mother, a devoted wife; but to keep those instincts firmly in\r\na woman\'s soul the man must not marry her in a rush of passion. Besides,\r\nhow do I know that you will please me to-morrow? No, I will not bring\r\nevil upon you; I leave Brittany," she said, observing hesitation in his\r\neyes. "I return to Fougeres now, where you cannot come to me--"\r\n\r\n"I can! and if to-morrow you see smoke on the rocks of Saint-Sulpice\r\nyou will know that I shall be with you at night, your lover, your\r\nhusband,--what you will that I be to you; I brave all!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! Alphonse, you love me well," she said, passionately, "to risk your\r\nlife before you give it to me."\r\n\r\nHe did not answer; he looked at her and her eyes fell; but he read in\r\nher ardent face a passion equal to his own, and he held out his arms to\r\nher. A sort of madness overcame her, and she let herself fall softly on\r\nhis breast, resolved to yield to him, and turn this yielding to great\r\nresults,--staking upon it her future happiness, which would become more\r\ncertain if she came victorious from this crucial test. But her head\r\nhad scarcely touched her lover\'s shoulder when a slight noise was heard\r\nwithout. She tore herself from his arms as if suddenly awakened, and\r\nsprang from the cottage. Her coolness came back to her, and she thought\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\n"He might have accepted me and scorned me," she reflected. "Ah! if I\r\ncould think that, I would kill him. But not yet!" she added, catching\r\nsight of Beau-Pied, to whom she made a sign which the soldier was quick\r\nto understand. He turned on his heel, pretending to have seen nothing.\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil re-entered the cottage, putting her finger to\r\nher lips to enjoin silence.\r\n\r\n"They are there!" she whispered in a frightened voice.\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"The Blues."\r\n\r\n"Ah! must I die without one kiss!"\r\n\r\n"Take it," she said.\r\n\r\nHe caught her to him, cold and unresisting, and gathered from her lips a\r\nkiss of horror and of joy, for while it was the first, it might also be\r\nthe last. Then they went together to the door and looked cautiously\r\nout. The marquis saw Gudin and his men holding the paths leading to the\r\nvalley. Then he turned to the line of gates where the first rotten trunk\r\nwas guarded by five men. Without an instant\'s pause he jumped on the\r\nbarrel of cider and struck a hole through the thatch of the roof, from\r\nwhich to spring upon the rocks behind the house; but he drew his head\r\nhastily back through the gap he had made, for Hulot was on the height;\r\nhis retreat was cut off in that direction. The marquis turned and looked\r\nat his mistress, who uttered a cry of despair; for she heard the tramp\r\nof the three detachments near the house.\r\n\r\n"Go out first," he said; "you shall save me."\r\n\r\nHearing the words, to her all-glorious, she went out and stood before\r\nthe door. The marquis loaded his musket. Measuring with his eye the\r\nspace between the door of the hut and the old rotten trunk where seven\r\nmen stood, the Gars fired into their midst and sprang forward instantly,\r\nforcing a passage through them. The three troops rushed towards the\r\nopening through which he had passed, and saw him running across the\r\nfield with incredible celerity.\r\n\r\n"Fire! fire! a thousand devils! You\'re not Frenchmen! Fire, I say!"\r\ncalled Hulot.\r\n\r\nAs he shouted these words from the height above, his men and Gudin\'s\r\nfired a volley, which was fortunately ill-aimed. The marquis reached the\r\ngate of the next field, but as he did so he was almost caught by\r\nGudin, who was close upon his heels. The Gars redoubled his speed.\r\nNevertheless, he and his pursuer reached the next barrier together; but\r\nthe marquis dashed his musket at Gudin\'s head with so good an aim that\r\nhe stopped his rush. It is impossible to depict the anxiety betrayed\r\nby Marie, or the interest of Hulot and his troops as they watched the\r\nscene. They all, unconsciously or silently, repeated the gestures which\r\nthey saw the runners making. The Gars and Gudin reached the little wood\r\ntogether, but as they did so the latter stopped and darted behind a\r\ntree. About twenty Chouans, afraid to fire at a distance lest they\r\nshould kill their leader, rushed from the copse and riddled the tree\r\nwith balls. Hulot\'s men advanced at a run to save Gudin, who, being\r\nwithout arms, retreated from tree to tree, seizing his opportunity as\r\nthe Chouans reloaded. His danger was soon over. Hulot and the Blues met\r\nhim at the spot where the marquis had thrown his musket. At this instant\r\nGudin perceived his adversary sitting among the trees and out of breath,\r\nand he left his comrades firing at the Chouans, who had retreated behind\r\na lateral hedge; slipping round them, he darted towards the marquis with\r\nthe agility of a wild animal. Observing this manoeuvre the Chouans set\r\nup a cry to warn their leader; then, having fired on the Blues and their\r\ncontingent with the gusto of poachers, they boldly made a rush for them;\r\nbut Hulot\'s men sprang through the hedge which served them as a rampart\r\nand took a bloody revenge. The Chouans then gained the road which\r\nskirted the fields and took to the heights which Hulot had committed the\r\nblunder of abandoning. Before the Blues had time to reform, the Chouans\r\nwere entrenched behind the rocks, where they could fire with impunity on\r\nthe Republicans if the latter made any attempt to dislodge them.\r\n\r\nWhile Hulot and his soldiers went slowly towards the little wood to\r\nmeet Gudin, the men from Fougeres busied themselves in rifling the\r\ndead Chouans and dispatching those who still lived. In this fearful war\r\nneither party took prisoners. The marquis having made good his escape,\r\nthe Chouans and the Blues mutually recognized their respective positions\r\nand the uselessness of continuing the fight; so that both sides prepared\r\nto retreat.\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha!" cried one of the Fougeres men, busy about the bodies, "here\'s\r\na bird with yellow wings."\r\n\r\nAnd he showed his companions a purse full of gold which he had just\r\nfound in the pocket of a stout man dressed in black.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?" said another, pulling a breviary from the dead man\'s\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n"Communion bread--he\'s a priest!" cried the first man, flinging the\r\nbreviary on the ground.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a wretch!" cried a third, finding only two crowns in the pockets\r\nof the body he was stripping, "a cheat!"\r\n\r\n"But he\'s got a fine pair of shoes!" said a soldier, beginning to pull\r\nthem off.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t have them unless they fall to your share," said the Fougeres\r\nman, dragging the dead feet away and flinging the boots on a heap of\r\nclothing already collected.\r\n\r\nAnother Chouan took charge of the money, so that lots might be drawn as\r\nsoon as the troops were all assembled. When Hulot returned with Gudin,\r\nwhose last attempt to overtake the Gars was useless as well as perilous,\r\nhe found about a score of his own men and thirty of the contingent\r\nstanding around eleven of the enemy, whose naked bodies were thrown into\r\na ditch at the foot of the bank.\r\n\r\n"Soldiers!" cried Hulot, sternly. "I forbid you to share that clothing.\r\nForm in line, quick!"\r\n\r\n"Commandant," said a soldier, pointing to his shoes, at the points of\r\nwhich five bare toes could be seen on each foot, "all right about the\r\nmoney, but those boots," motioning to a pair of hobnailed boots with the\r\nbutt of his gun, "would fit me like a glove."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to put English shoes on your feet?" retorted Hulot.\r\n\r\n"But," said one of the Fougeres men, respectfully, "we\'ve divided the\r\nbooty all through the war."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t prevent you civilians from following your own ways," replied\r\nHulot, roughly.\r\n\r\n"Here, Gudin, here\'s a purse with three louis," said the officer who\r\nwas distributing the money. "You have run hard and the commandant won\'t\r\nprevent your taking it."\r\n\r\nHulot looked askance at Gudin, and saw that he turned pale.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my uncle\'s purse!" exclaimed the young man.\r\n\r\nExhausted as he was with his run, he sprang to the mound of bodies, and\r\nthe first that met his eyes was that of his uncle. But he had hardly\r\nrecognized the rubicund face now furrowed with blue lines, and seen\r\nthe stiffened arms and the gunshot wound before he gave a stifled cry,\r\nexclaiming, "Let us be off, commandant."\r\n\r\nThe Blues started. Hulot gave his arm to his young friend.\r\n\r\n"God\'s thunder!" he cried. "Never mind, it is no great matter."\r\n\r\n"But he is dead," said Gudin, "dead! He was my only relation, and though\r\nhe cursed me, still he loved me. If the king returns, the neighborhood\r\nwill want my head, and my poor uncle would have saved it."\r\n\r\n"What a fool Gudin is," said one of the men who had stayed behind to\r\nshare the spoils; "his uncle was rich, and he hasn\'t had time to make a\r\nwill and disinherit him."\r\n\r\nThe division over, the men of Fougeres rejoined the little battalion of\r\nthe Blues on their way to the town.\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTowards midnight the cottage of Galope-Chopine, hitherto the scene of\r\nlife without a care, was full of dread and horrible anxiety. Barbette\r\nand her little boy returned at the supper-hour, one with her heavy\r\nburden of rushes, the other carrying fodder for the cattle. Entering the\r\nhut, they looked about in vain for Galope-Chopine; the miserable chamber\r\nnever looked to them as large, so empty was it. The fire was out, and\r\nthe darkness, the silence, seemed to tell of some disaster. Barbette\r\nhastened to make a blaze, and to light two _oribus_, the name given to\r\ncandles made of pitch in the region between the villages of Amorique\r\nand the Upper Loire, and still used beyond Amboise in the Vendomois\r\ndistricts. Barbette did these things with the slowness of a person\r\nabsorbed in one overpowering feeling. She listened to every sound.\r\nDeceived by the whistling of the wind she went often to the door of the\r\nhut, returning sadly. She cleaned two beakers, filled them with cider,\r\nand placed them on the long table. Now and again she looked at her boy,\r\nwho watched the baking of the buckwheat cakes, but did not speak to\r\nhim. The lad\'s eyes happened to rest on the nails which usually held his\r\nfather\'s duck-gun, and Barbette trembled as she noticed that the gun was\r\ngone. The silence was broken only by the lowing of a cow or the splash\r\nof the cider as it dropped at regular intervals from the bung of\r\nthe cask. The poor woman sighed while she poured into three brown\r\nearthenware porringers a sort of soup made of milk, biscuit broken into\r\nbits, and boiled chestnuts.\r\n\r\n"They must have fought in the field next to the Berandiere," said the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n"Go and see," replied his mother.\r\n\r\nThe child ran to the place where the fighting had, as he said, taken\r\nplace. In the moonlight he found the heap of bodies, but his father was\r\nnot among them, and he came back whistling joyously, having picked up\r\nseveral five-franc pieces trampled in the mud and overlooked by the\r\nvictors. His mother was sitting on a stool beside the fire, employed\r\nin spinning flax. He made a negative sign to her, and then, ten o\'clock\r\nhaving struck from the tower of Saint-Leonard, he went to bed, muttering\r\na prayer to the holy Virgin of Auray. At dawn, Barbette, who had not\r\nclosed her eyes, gave a cry of joy, as she heard in the distance a\r\nsound she knew well of hobnailed shoes, and soon after Galope-Chopine\'s\r\nscowling face presented itself.\r\n\r\n"Thanks to Saint-Labre," he said, "to whom I owe a candle, the Gars is\r\nsafe. Don\'t forget that we now owe three candles to the saint."\r\n\r\nHe seized a beaker of cider and emptied it at a draught without drawing\r\nbreath. When his wife had served his soup and taken his gun and he\r\nhimself was seated on the wooden bench, he said, looking at the fire: "I\r\ncan\'t make out how the Blues got here. The fighting was at Florigny. Who\r\nthe devil could have told them that the Gars was in our house; no one\r\nknew it but he and the handsome garce and we--"\r\n\r\nBarbette turned white.\r\n\r\n"They made me believe they were the gars of Saint-Georges," she said,\r\ntrembling, "it was I who told them the Gars was here."\r\n\r\nGalope-Chopine turned pale himself and dropped his porringer on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"I sent the boy to warn you," said Barbette, frightened, "didn\'t you\r\nmeet him?"\r\n\r\nThe Chouan rose and struck his wife so violently that she dropped, pale\r\nas death, upon the bed.\r\n\r\n"You cursed woman," he said, "you have killed me!" Then seized with\r\nremorse, he took her in his arms. "Barbette!" he cried, "Barbette!--Holy\r\nVirgin, my hand was too heavy!"\r\n\r\n"Do you think," she said, opening her eyes, "that Marche-a-Terre will\r\nhear of it?"\r\n\r\n"The Gars will certainly inquire who betrayed him."\r\n\r\n"Will he tell it to Marche-a-Terre?"\r\n\r\n"Marche-a-Terre and Pille-Miche were both at Florigny."\r\n\r\nBarbette breathed a little easier.\r\n\r\n"If they touch a hair of your head," she cried, "I\'ll rinse their\r\nglasses with vinegar."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I can\'t eat," said Galope-Chopine, anxiously.\r\n\r\nHis wife set another pitcher full of cider before him, but he paid no\r\nheed to it. Two big tears rolled from the woman\'s eyes and moistened the\r\ndeep furrows of her withered face.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, wife; to-morrow morning you must gather fagots on the\r\nrocks of Saint-Sulpice, to the right and Saint-Leonard and set fire to\r\nthem. That is a signal agreed upon between the Gars and the old rector\r\nof Saint-Georges who is to come and say mass for him."\r\n\r\n"Is the Gars going to Fougeres?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to see his handsome garce. I have been sent here and there all\r\nday about it. I think he is going to marry her and carry her off; for he\r\ntold me to hire horses and have them ready on the road to Saint-Malo."\r\n\r\nThereupon Galope-Chopine, who was tired out, went to bed for an hour or\r\ntwo, at the end of which time he again departed. Later, on the following\r\nmorning, he returned, having carefully fulfilled all the commissions\r\nentrusted to him by the Gars. Finding that Marche-a-Terre and\r\nPille-Miche had not appeared at the cottage, he relieved the\r\napprehensions of his wife, who went off, reassured, to the rocks of\r\nSaint-Sulpice, where she had collected the night before several piles of\r\nfagots, now covered with hoarfrost. The boy went with her, carrying fire\r\nin a broken wooden shoe.\r\n\r\nHardly had his wife and son passed out of sight behind the shed when\r\nGalope-Chopine heard the noise of men jumping the successive barriers,\r\nand he could dimly see, through the fog which was growing thicker, the\r\nforms of two men like moving shadows.\r\n\r\n"It is Marche-a-Terre and Pille-Miche," he said, mentally; then he\r\nshuddered. The two Chouans entered the courtyard and showed their gloomy\r\nfaces under the broad-brimmed hats which made them look like the figures\r\nwhich engravers introduce into their landscapes.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Galope-Chopine," said Marche-a-Terre, gravely.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre," replied the other, humbly.\r\n"Will you come in and drink a drop? I\'ve some cold buckwheat cake and\r\nfresh-made butter."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not to be refused, cousin," said Pille-Miche.\r\n\r\nThe two Chouans entered the cottage. So far there was nothing alarming\r\nfor the master of the house, who hastened to fill three beakers from his\r\nhuge cask of cider, while Marche-a-Terre and Pille-Miche, sitting on the\r\npolished benches on each side of the long table, cut the cake and spread\r\nit with the rich yellow butter from which the milk spurted as the knife\r\nsmoothed it. Galope-Chopine placed the beakers full of frothing cider\r\nbefore his guests, and the three Chouans began to eat; but from time to\r\ntime the master of the house cast side-long glances at Marche-a-Terre as\r\nhe drank his cider.\r\n\r\n"Lend me your snuff-box," said Marche-a-Terre to Pille-Miche.\r\n\r\nHaving shaken several pinches into the palm of his hand the Breton\r\ninhaled the tobacco like a man who is making ready for serious business.\r\n\r\n"It is cold," said Pille-Miche, rising to shut the upper half of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe daylight, already dim with fog, now entered only through the\r\nlittle window, and feebly lighted the room and the two seats; the fire,\r\nhowever, gave out a ruddy glow. Galope-Chopine refilled the beakers, but\r\nhis guests refused to drink again, and throwing aside their large\r\nhats looked at him solemnly. Their gestures and the look they gave him\r\nterrified Galope-Chopine, who fancied he saw blood in the red woollen\r\ncaps they wore.\r\n\r\n"Fetch your axe," said Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\n"But, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre, what do you want it for?"\r\n\r\n"Come, cousin, you know very well," said Pille-Miche, pocketing his\r\nsnuff-box which Marche-a-Terre returned to him; "you are condemned."\r\n\r\nThe two Chouans rose together and took their guns.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Marche-a-Terre, I never said one word about the Gars--"\r\n\r\n"I told you to fetch your axe," said Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\nThe hapless man knocked against the wooden bedstead of his son, and\r\nseveral five-franc pieces rolled on the floor. Pille-Miche picked them\r\nup.\r\n\r\n"Ho! ho! the Blues paid you in new money," cried Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\n"As true as that\'s the image of Saint-Labre," said Galope-Chopine, "I\r\nhave told nothing. Barbette mistook the Fougeres men for the gars of\r\nSaint-Georges, and that\'s the whole of it."\r\n\r\n"Why do you tell things to your wife?" said Marche-a-Terre, roughly.\r\n\r\n"Besides, cousin, we don\'t want excuses, we want your axe. You are\r\ncondemned."\r\n\r\nAt a sign from his companion, Pille-Miche helped Marche-a-Terre to seize\r\nthe victim. Finding himself in their grasp Galope-Chopine lost all\r\npower and fell on his knees holding up his hands to his slayers in\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\n"My friends, my good friends, my cousin," he said, "what will become of\r\nmy little boy?"\r\n\r\n"I will take charge of him," said Marche-a-Terre.\r\n\r\n"My good comrades," cried the victim, turning livid. "I am not fit to\r\ndie. Don\'t make me go without confession. You have the right to take my\r\nlife, but you\'ve no right to make me lose a blessed eternity."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Marche-a-Terre, addressing Pille-Miche.\r\n\r\nThe two Chouans waited a moment in much uncertainty, unable to decide\r\nthis case of conscience. Galope-Chopine listened to the rustling of the\r\nwind as though he still had hope. Suddenly Pille-Miche took him by the\r\narm into a corner of the hut.\r\n\r\n"Confess your sins to me," he said, "and I will tell them to a priest\r\nof the true Church, and if there is any penance to do I will do it for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nGalope-Chopine obtained some respite by the way in which he confessed\r\nhis sins; but in spite of their number and the circumstances of each\r\ncrime, he came finally to the end of them.\r\n\r\n"Cousin," he said, imploringly, "since I am speaking to you as I would\r\nto my confessor, I do assure you, by the holy name of God, that I\r\nhave nothing to reproach myself with except for having, now and then,\r\nbuttered my bread on both sides; and I call on Saint-Labre, who is there\r\nover the chimney-piece, to witness that I have never said one word about\r\nthe Gars. No, my good friends, I have not betrayed him."\r\n\r\n"Very good, that will do, cousin; you can explain all that to God in\r\ncourse of time."\r\n\r\n"But let me say good-bye to Barbette."\r\n\r\n"Come," said Marche-a-Terre, "if you don\'t want us to think you worse\r\nthan you are, behave like a Breton and be done with it."\r\n\r\nThe two Chouans seized him again and threw him on the bench where he\r\ngave no other sign of resistance than the instinctive and convulsive\r\nmotions of an animal, uttering a few smothered groans, which ceased when\r\nthe axe fell. The head was off at the first blow. Marche-a-Terre took it\r\nby the hair, left the room, sought and found a large nail in the rough\r\ncasing of the door, and wound the hair about it; leaving the bloody\r\nhead, the eyes of which he did not even close, to hang there.\r\n\r\nThe two Chouans then washed their hands, without the least haste, in a\r\npot full of water, picked up their hats and guns, and jumped the gate,\r\nwhistling the "Ballad of the Captain." Pille-Miche began to sing in\r\na hoarse voice as he reached the field the last verses of that rustic\r\nsong, their melody floating on the breeze:--\r\n\r\n  "At the first town\r\n  Her lover dressed her\r\n  All in white satin;\r\n\r\n  "At the next town\r\n  Her lover dressed her\r\n  In gold and silver.\r\n\r\n  "So beautiful was she\r\n  They gave her veils\r\n  To wear in the regiment."\r\n\r\nThe tune became gradually indistinguishable as the Chouans got further\r\naway; but the silence of the country was so great that several of the\r\nnotes reached Barbette\'s ear as she neared home, holding her boy by the\r\nhand. A peasant-woman never listens coldly to that song, so popular is\r\nit in the West of France, and Barbette began, unconsciously, to sing the\r\nfirst verses:--\r\n\r\n  "Come, let us go, my girl,\r\n  Let us go to the war;\r\n  Let us go, it is time.\r\n\r\n  "Brave captain,\r\n  Let it not trouble you,\r\n  But my daughter is not for you.\r\n\r\n  "You shall not have her on earth,\r\n  You shall not have her at sea,\r\n  Unless by treachery.\r\n\r\n  "The father took his daughter,\r\n  He unclothed her\r\n  And flung her out to sea.\r\n\r\n  "The captain, wiser still,\r\n  Into the waves he jumped\r\n  And to the shore he brought her.\r\n\r\n  "Come, let us go, my girl,\r\n  Let us go to the war;\r\n  Let us go, it is time.\r\n\r\n  "At the first town\r\n  Her lover dressed her,"\r\n  Etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAs Barbette reached this verse of the song, where Pille-Miche had begun\r\nit, she was entering the courtyard of her home; her tongue suddenly\r\nstiffened, she stood still, and a great cry, quickly repressed, came\r\nfrom her gaping lips.\r\n\r\n"What is it, mother?" said the child.\r\n\r\n"Walk alone," she cried, pulling her hand away and pushing him roughly;\r\n"you have neither father nor mother."\r\n\r\nThe child, who was rubbing his shoulder and weeping, suddenly caught\r\nsight of the thing on the nail; his childlike face kept the nervous\r\nconvulsion his crying had caused, but he was silent. He opened his\r\neyes wide, and gazed at the head of his father with a stupid look which\r\nbetrayed no emotion; then his face, brutalized by ignorance, showed\r\nsavage curiosity. Barbette again took his hand, grasped it violently,\r\nand dragged him into the house. When Pille-Miche and Marche-a-Terre\r\nthrew their victim on the bench one of his shoes, dropping off, fell on\r\nthe floor beneath his neck and was afterward filled with blood. It was\r\nthe first thing that met the widow\'s eye.\r\n\r\n"Take off your shoe," said the mother to her son. "Put your foot in\r\nthat. Good. Remember," she cried, in a solemn voice, "your father\'s\r\nshoe; never put on your own without remembering how the Chouans filled\r\nit with his blood, and _kill the Chouans_!"\r\n\r\nShe swayed her head with so convulsive an action that the meshes of\r\nher black hair fell upon her neck and gave a sinister expression to her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"I call Saint-Labre to witness," she said, "that I vow you to the Blues.\r\nYou shall be a soldier to avenge your father. Kill, kill the _Chouans_,\r\nand do as I do. Ha! they\'ve taken the head of my man, and I am going to\r\ngive that of the Gars to the Blues."\r\n\r\nShe sprang at a bound on the bed, seized a little bag of money from a\r\nhiding-place, took the hand of the astonished little boy, and dragged\r\nhim after her without giving him time to put on his shoe, and was on her\r\nway to Fougeres rapidly, without once turning her head to look at\r\nthe home she abandoned. When they reached the summit of the rocks of\r\nSaint-Sulpice Barbette set fire to the pile of fagots, and the boy\r\nhelped her to pile on the green gorse, damp with hoarfrost, to make the\r\nsmoke more dense.\r\n\r\n"That fire will last longer than your father, longer than I, longer than\r\nthe Gars," said Barbette, in a savage voice.\r\n\r\nWhile the widow of Galope-Chopine and her son with his bloody foot stood\r\nwatching, the one, with a gloomy expression of revenge, the other with\r\ncuriosity, the curling of the smoke, Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s eyes\r\nwere fastened on the same rock, trying, but in vain, to see her lover\'s\r\nsignal. The fog, which had thickened, buried the whole region under a\r\nveil, its gray tints obscuring even the outlines of the scenery that\r\nwas nearest the town. She examined with tender anxiety the rocks, the\r\ncastle, the buildings, which loomed like shadows through the mist. Near\r\nher window several trees stood out against this blue-gray background;\r\nthe sun gave a dull tone as of tarnished silver to the sky; its rays\r\ncolored the bare branches of the trees, where a few last leaves\r\nwere fluttering, with a dingy red. But too many dear and delightful\r\nsentiments filled Marie\'s soul to let her notice the ill-omens of a\r\nscene so out of harmony with the joys she was tasting in advance.\r\nFor the last two days her ideas had undergone a change. The fierce,\r\nundisciplined vehemence of her passions had yielded under the influence\r\nof the equable atmosphere which a true love gives to life. The certainty\r\nof being loved, sought through so many perils, had given birth to a\r\ndesire to re-enter those social conditions which sanction love, and\r\nwhich despair alone had made her leave. To love for a moment only now\r\nseemed to her a species of weakness. She saw herself lifted from the\r\ndregs of society, where misfortune had driven her, to the high rank in\r\nwhich her father had meant to place her. Her vanity, repressed for a\r\ntime by the cruel alternations of hope and misconception, was awakened\r\nand showed her all the benefits of a great position. Born in a certain\r\nway to rank, marriage to a marquis meant, to her mind, living and acting\r\nin the sphere that belonged to her. Having known the chances and changes\r\nof an adventurous life, she could appreciate, better than other women,\r\nthe grandeur of the feelings which make the Family. Marriage and\r\nmotherhood with all their cares seemed to her less a task than a rest.\r\nShe loved the calm and virtuous life she saw through the clouds of this\r\nlast storm as a woman weary of virtue may sometimes covet an illicit\r\npassion. Virtue was to her a new seduction.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," she thought, leaving the window without seeing the signal on\r\nthe rocks of Saint-Sulpice, "I have been too coquettish with him--but\r\nI knew he loved me! Francine, it is not a dream; to-night I shall\r\nbe Marquise de Montauran. What have I done to deserve such perfect\r\nhappiness? Oh! I love him, and love alone is love\'s reward. And yet, I\r\nthink God means to recompense me for taking heart through all my misery;\r\nhe means me to forget my sufferings--for you know, Francine, I have\r\nsuffered."\r\n\r\n"To-night, Marquise de Montauran, you, Marie? Ah! until it is done I\r\ncannot believe it! Who has told him your true goodness?"\r\n\r\n"Dear child! he has more than his handsome eyes to see me with, he has\r\na soul. If you had seen him, as I have, in danger! Oh! he knows how to\r\nlove--he is so brave!"\r\n\r\n"If you really love him why do you let him come to Fougeres?"\r\n\r\n"We had no time to say one word to each other when the Blues surprised\r\nus. Besides, his coming is a proof of love. Can I ever have proofs\r\nenough? And now, Francine, do my hair."\r\n\r\nBut she pulled it down a score of times with motions that seemed\r\nelectric, as though some stormy thoughts were mingling still with the\r\narts of her coquetry. As she rolled a curl or smoothed the shining\r\nplaits she asked herself, with a remnant of distrust, whether the\r\nmarquis were deceiving her; but treachery seemed to her impossible, for\r\ndid he not expose himself to instant vengeance by entering Fougeres?\r\nWhile studying in her mirror the effects of a sidelong glance, a smile,\r\na gentle frown, an attitude of anger, or of love, or disdain, she was\r\nseeking some woman\'s wile by which to probe to the last instant the\r\nheart of the young leader.\r\n\r\n"You are right, Francine," she said; "I wish with you that the marriage\r\nwere over. This is the last of my cloudy days--it is big with death or\r\nhappiness. Oh! that fog is dreadful," she went on, again looking towards\r\nthe heights of Saint-Sulpice, which were still veiled in mist.\r\n\r\nShe began to arrange the silk and muslin curtains which draped the\r\nwindow, making them intercept the light and produce in the room a\r\nvoluptuous chiaro-scuro.\r\n\r\n"Francine," she said, "take away those knick-knacks on the mantelpiece;\r\nleave only the clock and the two Dresden vases. I\'ll fill those vases\r\nmyself with the flowers Corentin brought me. Take out the chairs, I want\r\nonly this sofa and a fauteuil. Then sweep the carpet, so as to bring out\r\nthe colors, and put wax candles in the sconces and on the mantel."\r\n\r\nMarie looked long and carefully at the old tapestry on the walls.\r\nGuided by her innate taste she found among the brilliant tints of these\r\nhangings the shades by which to connect their antique beauty with the\r\nfurniture and accessories of the boudoir, either by the harmony of color\r\nor the charm of contrast. The same thought guided the arrangement of\r\nthe flowers with which she filled the twisted vases which decorated her\r\nchamber. The sofa was placed beside the fire. On either side of the bed,\r\nwhich filled the space parallel to that of the chimney, she placed on\r\ngilded tables tall Dresden vases filled with foliage and flowers that\r\nwere sweetly fragrant. She quivered more than once as she arranged the\r\nfolds of the green damask above the bed, and studied the fall of the\r\ndrapery which concealed it. Such preparations have a secret, ineffable\r\nhappiness about them; they cause so many delightful emotions that a\r\nwoman as she makes them forgets her doubts; and Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nforgot hers. There is in truth a religious sentiment in the multiplicity\r\nof cares taken for one beloved who is not there to see them and reward\r\nthem, but who will reward them later with the approving smile these\r\ntender preparations (always so fully understood) obtain. Women, as they\r\nmake them, love in advance; and there are few indeed who would not say\r\nto themselves, as Mademoiselle de Verneuil now thought: "To-night I\r\nshall be happy!" That soft hope lies in every fold of silk or muslin;\r\ninsensibly, the harmony the woman makes about her gives an atmosphere of\r\nlove in which she breathes; to her these things are beings, witnesses;\r\nshe has made them the sharers of her coming joy. Every movement, every\r\nthought brings that joy within her grasp. But presently she expects no\r\nlonger, she hopes no more, she questions silence; the slightest sound\r\nis to her an omen; doubt hooks its claws once more into her heart; she\r\nburns, she trembles, she is grasped by a thought which holds her like\r\na physical force; she alternates from triumph to agony, and without the\r\nhope of coming happiness she could not endure the torture. A score of\r\ntimes did Mademoiselle de Verneuil raise the window-curtain, hoping to\r\nsee the smoke rising above the rocks; but the fog only took a grayer\r\ntone, which her excited imagination turned into a warning. At last she\r\nlet fall the curtain, impatiently resolving not to raise it again. She\r\nlooked gloomily around the charming room to which she had given a soul\r\nand a voice, asking herself if it were done in vain, and this thought\r\nbrought her back to her preparations.\r\n\r\n"Francine," she said, drawing her into a little dressing-room which\r\nadjoined her chamber and was lighted through a small round window\r\nopening on a dark corner of the fortifications where they joined the\r\nrock terrace of the Promenade, "put everything in order. As for the\r\nsalon, you can leave that as it is," she added, with a smile which women\r\nreserve for their nearest friends, the delicate sentiment of which men\r\nseldom understand.\r\n\r\n"Ah! how sweet you are!" exclaimed the little maid.\r\n\r\n"A lover is our beauty--foolish women that we are!" she replied gaily.\r\n\r\nFrancine left her lying on the ottoman and went away convinced\r\nthat, whether her mistress were loved or not, she would never betray\r\nMontauran.\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n"Are you sure of what you are telling me, old woman?" Hulot was saying\r\nto Barbette, who had sought him out as soon as she had reached Fougeres.\r\n\r\n"Have you got eyes? Look at the rocks of Saint-Sulpice, there, my good\r\nman, to the right of Saint-Leonard."\r\n\r\nCorentin, who was with Hulot, looked towards the summit in the direction\r\npointed out by Barbette, and, as the fog was beginning to lift, he could\r\nsee with some distinctness the column of white smoke the woman told of.\r\n\r\n"But when is he coming, old woman?--to-night, or this evening?"\r\n\r\n"My good man," said Barbette, "I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Why do you betray your own side?" said Hulot, quickly, having drawn her\r\nout of hearing of Corentin.\r\n\r\n"Ah! general, see my boy\'s foot--that\'s washed in the blood of my man,\r\nwhom the Chouans have killed like a calf, to punish him for the few\r\nwords you got out of me the other day when I was working in the fields.\r\nTake my boy, for you\'ve deprived him of his father and his mother; make\r\na Blue of him, my good man, teach him to kill Chouans. Here, there\'s two\r\nhundred crowns,--keep them for him; if he is careful, they\'ll last him\r\nlong, for it took his father twelve years to lay them by."\r\n\r\nHulot looked with amazement at the pale and withered woman, whose eyes\r\nwere dry.\r\n\r\n"But you, mother," he said, "what will become of you? you had better\r\nkeep the money."\r\n\r\n"I?" she replied, shaking her head sadly. "I don\'t need anything in this\r\nworld. You might bolt me into that highest tower over there" (pointing\r\nto the battlements of the castle) "and the Chouans would contrive to\r\ncome and kill me."\r\n\r\nShe kissed her boy with an awful expression of grief, looked at him,\r\nwiped away her tears, looked at him again, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Commandant," said Corentin, "this is an occasion when two heads are\r\nbetter than one. We know all, and yet we know nothing. If you surrounded\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil\'s house now, you will only warn her. Neither\r\nyou, nor I, nor your Blues and your battalions are strong enough to\r\nget the better of that girl if she takes it into her head to save the\r\n_ci-devant_. The fellow is brave, and consequently wily; he is a young\r\nman full of daring. We can never get hold of him as he enters Fougeres.\r\nPerhaps he is here already. Domiciliary visit? Absurdity! that\'s no\r\ngood, it will only give them warning."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Hulot impatiently, "I shall tell the sentry on the Place\r\nSaint-Leonard to keep his eye on the house, and pass word along the\r\nother sentinels, if a young man enters it; as soon as the signal reaches\r\nme I shall take a corporal and four men and--"\r\n\r\n"--and," said Corentin, interrupting the old soldier, "if the young man\r\nis not the marquis, or if the marquis doesn\'t go in by the front door,\r\nor if he is already there, if--if--if--what then?"\r\n\r\nCorentin looked at the commandant with so insulting an air of\r\nsuperiority that the old soldier shouted out: "God\'s thousand thunders!\r\nget out of here, citizen of hell! What have I got to do with your\r\nintrigues? If that cockchafer buzzes into my guard-room I shall shoot\r\nhim; if I hear he is in a house I shall surround that house and take him\r\nwhen he leaves it and shoot him, but may the devil get me if I soil my\r\nuniform with any of your tricks."\r\n\r\n"Commandant, the order of the ministers states that you are to obey\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil."\r\n\r\n"Let her come and give them to me herself and I\'ll see about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, citizen," said Corentin, haughtily, "she shall come. She shall\r\ntell you herself the hour at which she expects the _ci-devant_. Possibly\r\nshe won\'t be easy till you do post the sentinels round the house."\r\n\r\n"The devil is made man," thought the old leader as he watched Corentin\r\nhurrying up the Queen\'s Staircase at the foot of which this scene had\r\ntaken place. "He means to deliver Montauran bound hand and foot, with no\r\nchance to fight for his life, and I shall be harrassed to death with a\r\ncourt-martial. However," he added, shrugging his shoulders, "the Gars\r\ncertainly is an enemy of the Republic, and he killed my poor Gerard, and\r\nhis death will make a noble the less--the devil take him!"\r\n\r\nHe turned on the heels of his boots and went off, whistling the\r\nMarseillaise, to inspect his guard-rooms.\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil was absorbed in one of those meditations the\r\nmysteries of which are buried in the soul, and prove by their thousand\r\ncontradictory emotions, to the woman who undergoes them, that it is\r\npossible to have a stormy and passionate existence between four walls\r\nwithout even moving from the ottoman on which her very life is burning\r\nitself away. She had reached the final scene of the drama she had come\r\nto enact, and her mind was going over and over the phases of love and\r\nanger which had so powerfully stirred her during the ten days which\r\nhad now elapsed since her first meeting with the marquis. A man\'s\r\nstep suddenly sounded in the adjoining room and she trembled; the door\r\nopened, she turned quickly and saw Corentin.\r\n\r\n"You little cheat!" said the police-agent, "when will you stop\r\ndeceiving? Ah, Marie, Marie, you are playing a dangerous game by not\r\ntaking me into your confidence. Why do you play such tricks without\r\nconsulting me? If the marquis escapes his fate--"\r\n\r\n"It won\'t be your fault, will it?" she replied, sarcastically.\r\n"Monsieur," she continued, in a grave voice, "by what right do you come\r\ninto my house?"\r\n\r\n"Your house?" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"You remind me," she answered, coldly, "that I have no home. Perhaps you\r\nchose this house deliberately for the purpose of committing murder. I\r\nshall leave it. I would live in a desert to get away from--"\r\n\r\n"Spies, say the word," interrupted Corentin. "But this house is neither\r\nyours nor mine, it belongs to the government; and as for leaving it you\r\nwill do nothing of the kind," he added, giving her a diabolical look.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil rose indignantly, made a few steps to leave the\r\nroom, but stopped short suddenly as Corentin raised the curtain of the\r\nwindow and beckoned her, with a smile, to come to him.\r\n\r\n"Do you see that column of smoke?" he asked, with the calmness he always\r\nkept on his livid face, however intense his feelings might be.\r\n\r\n"What has my departure to do with that burning brush?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Why does your voice tremble?" he said. "You poor thing!" he added, in\r\na gentle voice, "I know all. The marquis is coming to Fougeres this\r\nevening; and it is not with any intention of delivering him to us that\r\nyou have arranged this boudoir and the flowers and candles."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil turned pale, for she saw her lover\'s death in\r\nthe eyes of this tiger with a human face, and her love for him rose to\r\nfrenzy. Each hair on her head caused her an acute pain she could not\r\nendure, and she fell on the ottoman. Corentin stood looking at her for a\r\nmoment with his arms folded, half pleased at inflicting a torture which\r\navenged him for the contempt and the sarcasms this woman had heaped upon\r\nhis head, half grieved by the sufferings of a creature whose yoke was\r\npleasant to him, heavy as it was.\r\n\r\n"She loves him!" he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Loves him!" she cried. "Ah! what are words? Corentin! he is my life,\r\nmy soul, my breath!" She flung herself at the feet of the man, whose\r\nsilence terrified her. "Soul of vileness!" she cried, "I would rather\r\ndegrade myself to save his life than degrade myself by betraying him. I\r\nwill save him at the cost of my own blood. Speak, what price must I pay\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nCorentin quivered.\r\n\r\n"I came to take your orders, Marie," he said, raising her. "Yes, Marie,\r\nyour insults will not hinder my devotion to your wishes, provided you\r\nwill promise not to deceive me again; you must know by this time that no\r\none dupes me with impunity."\r\n\r\n"If you want me to love you, Corentin, help me to save him."\r\n\r\n"At what hour is he coming?" asked the spy, endeavoring to ask the\r\nquestion calmly.\r\n\r\n"Alas, I do not know."\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in silence.\r\n\r\n"I am lost!" thought Mademoiselle de Verneuil.\r\n\r\n"She is deceiving me!" thought Corentin. "Marie," he continued, "I\r\nhave two maxims. One is never to believe a single word a woman says to\r\nme--that\'s the only means of not being duped; the other is to find what\r\ninterest she has in doing the opposite of what she says, and behaving in\r\ncontradiction to the facts she pretends to confide to me. I think that\r\nyou and I understand each other now."\r\n\r\n"Perfectly," replied Mademoiselle de Verneuil. "You want proofs of my\r\ngood faith; but I reserve them for the time when you give me some of\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"Adieu, mademoiselle," said Corentin, coolly.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," said the girl, smiling; "sit down, and pray don\'t sulk; but\r\nif you do I shall know how to save the marquis without you. As for the\r\nthree hundred thousand francs which are always spread before your eyes,\r\nI will give them to you in good gold as soon as the marquis is safe."\r\n\r\nCorentin rose, stepped back a pace or two, and looked at Marie.\r\n\r\n"You have grown rich in a very short time," he said, in a tone of\r\nill-disguised bitterness.\r\n\r\n"Montauran," she continued, "will make you a better offer still for his\r\nransom. Now, then, prove to me that you have the means of guaranteeing\r\nhim from all danger and--"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you send him away the moment he arrives?" cried Corentin,\r\nsuddenly. "Hulot does not know he is coming, and--" He stopped as if he\r\nhad said too much. "But how absurd that you should ask me how to play\r\na trick," he said, with an easy laugh. "Now listen, Marie, I do feel\r\ncertain of your loyalty. Promise me a compensation for all I lose in\r\nfurthering your wishes, and I will make that old fool of a commandant\r\nso unsuspicious that the marquis will be as safe at Fougeres as at\r\nSaint-James."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I promise it," said the girl, with a sort of solemnity.\r\n\r\n"No, not in that way," he said, "swear it by your mother."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil shuddered; raising a trembling hand she made\r\nthe oath required by the man whose tone to her had changed so suddenly.\r\n\r\n"You can command me," he said; "don\'t deceive me again, and you shall\r\nhave reason to bless me to-night."\r\n\r\n"I will trust you, Corentin," cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil, much\r\nmoved. She bowed her head gently towards him and smiled with a kindness\r\nnot unmixed with surprise, as she saw an expression of melancholy\r\ntenderness on his face.\r\n\r\n"What an enchanting creature!" thought Corentin, as he left the house.\r\n"Shall I ever get her as a means to fortune and a source of delight? To\r\nfling herself at my feet! Oh, yes, the marquis shall die! If I can\'t get\r\nthat woman in any other way than by dragging her through the mud, I\'ll\r\nsink her in it. At any rate," he thought, as he reached the square\r\nunconscious of his steps, "she no longer distrusts me. Three hundred\r\nthousand francs down! she thinks me grasping! Either the offer was a\r\ntrick or she is already married to him."\r\n\r\nCorentin, buried in thought, was unable to come to a resolution. The\r\nfog which the sun had dispersed at mid-day was now rolling thicker and\r\nthicker, so that he could hardly see the trees at a little distance.\r\n\r\n"That\'s another piece of ill-luck," he muttered, as he turned slowly\r\nhomeward. "It is impossible to see ten feet. The weather protects the\r\nlovers. How is one to watch a house in such a fog? Who goes there?" he\r\ncried, catching the arm of a boy who seemed to have clambered up the\r\ndangerous rocks which made the terrace of the Promenade.\r\n\r\n"It is I," said a childish voice.\r\n\r\n"Ah! the boy with the bloody foot. Do you want to revenge your father?"\r\nsaid Corentin.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the child.\r\n\r\n"Very good. Do you know the Gars?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Good again. Now, don\'t leave me except to do what I bid you, and you\r\nwill obey your mother and earn some big sous--do you like sous?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You like sous, and you want to kill the Gars who killed your\r\nfather--well, I\'ll take care of you. Ah! Marie," he muttered, after a\r\npause, "you yourself shall betray him, as you engaged to do! She is too\r\nviolent to suspect me--passion never reflects. She does not know the\r\nmarquis\'s writing. Yes, I can set a trap into which her nature will\r\ndrive her headlong. But I must first see Hulot."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil and Francine were deliberating on the means of\r\nsaving the marquis from the more than doubtful generosity of Corentin\r\nand Hulot\'s bayonets.\r\n\r\n"I could go and warn him," said the Breton girl.\r\n\r\n"But we don\'t know where he is," replied Marie; "even I, with the\r\ninstincts of love, could never find him."\r\n\r\nAfter making and rejecting a number of plans Mademoiselle de Verneuil\r\nexclaimed, "When I see him his danger will inspire me."\r\n\r\nShe thought, like other ardent souls, to act on the spur of the moment,\r\ntrusting to her star, or to that instinct of adroitness which rarely, if\r\never, fails a woman. Perhaps her heart was never so wrung. At times she\r\nseemed stupefied, her eyes were fixed, and then, at the least noise, she\r\nshook like a half-uprooted tree which the woodsman drags with a rope to\r\nhasten its fall. Suddenly, a loud report from a dozen guns echoed from\r\na distance. Marie turned pale and grasped Francine\'s hand. "I am dying,"\r\nshe cried; "they have killed him!"\r\n\r\nThe heavy footfall of a man was heard in the antechamber. Francine went\r\nout and returned with a corporal. The man, making a military salute to\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, produced some letters, the covers of which\r\nwere a good deal soiled. Receiving no acknowledgment, the Blue said as\r\nhe withdrew, "Madame, they are from the commandant."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil, a prey to horrible presentiments, read a\r\nletter written apparently in great haste by Hulot:--\r\n\r\n  "Mademoiselle--a party of my men have just caught a messenger from\r\n  the Gars and have shot him. Among the intercepted letters is one\r\n  which may be useful to you and I transmit it--etc."\r\n\r\n"Thank God, it was not he they shot," she exclaimed, flinging the letter\r\ninto the fire.\r\n\r\nShe breathed more freely and took up the other letter, enclosed by\r\nHulot. It was apparently written to Madame du Gua by the marquis.\r\n\r\n  "No, my angel," the letter said, "I cannot go to-night to La\r\n  Vivetiere. You must lose your wager with the count. I triumph over\r\n  the Republic in the person of their beautiful emissary. You must\r\n  allow that she is worth the sacrifice of one night. It will be my\r\n  only victory in this campaign, for I have received the news that\r\n  La Vendee surrenders. I can do nothing more in France. Let us go\r\n  back to England--but we will talk of all this to-morrow."\r\n\r\nThe letter fell from Marie\'s hands; she closed her eyes, and was silent,\r\nleaning backward, with her head on a cushion. After a long pause she\r\nlooked at the clock, which then marked four in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n"My lord keeps me waiting," she said, with savage irony.\r\n\r\n"Oh! God grant he may not come!" cried Francine.\r\n\r\n"If he does not come," said Marie, in a stifled tone, "I shall go to\r\nhim. No, no, he will soon be here. Francine, do I look well?"\r\n\r\n"You are very pale."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" continued Mademoiselle de Verneuil, glancing about her, "this\r\nperfumed room, the flowers, the lights, this intoxicating air, it is\r\nfull of that celestial life of which I dreamed--"\r\n\r\n"Marie, what has happened?"\r\n\r\n"I am betrayed, deceived, insulted, fooled! I will kill him, I will tear\r\nhim bit by bit! Yes, there was always in his manner a contempt he could\r\nnot hide and which I would not see. Oh! I shall die of this! Fool that\r\nI am," she went on laughing, "he is coming; I have one night in which\r\nto teach him that, married or not, the man who has possessed me cannot\r\nabandon me. I will measure my vengeance by his offence; he shall die\r\nwith despair in his soul. I did believe he had a soul of honor, but no!\r\nit is that of a lackey. Ah, he has cleverly deceived me, for even now\r\nit seems impossible that the man who abandoned me to Pille-Miche should\r\nsink to such back-stair tricks. It is so base to deceive a loving woman,\r\nfor it is so easy. He might have killed me if he chose, but lie to me!\r\nto me, who held him in my thoughts so high! The scaffold! the scaffold!\r\nah! could I only see him guillotined! Am I cruel? He shall go to his\r\ndeath covered with caresses, with kisses which might have blessed him\r\nfor a lifetime--"\r\n\r\n"Marie," said Francine, gently, "be the victim of your lover like other\r\nwomen; not his mistress and his betrayer. Keep his memory in your heart;\r\ndo not make it an anguish to you. If there were no joys in hopeless\r\nlove, what would become of us, poor women that we are? God, of whom\r\nyou never think, Marie, will reward us for obeying our vocation on this\r\nearth,--to love, and suffer."\r\n\r\n"Dear," replied Mademoiselle de Verneuil, taking Francine\'s hand\r\nand patting it, "your voice is very sweet and persuasive. Reason is\r\nattractive from your lips. I should like to obey you, but--"\r\n\r\n"You will forgive him, you will not betray him?"\r\n\r\n"Hush! never speak of that man again. Compared with him Corentin is a\r\nnoble being. Do you hear me?"\r\n\r\nShe rose, hiding beneath a face that was horribly calm the madness of\r\nher soul and a thirst for vengeance. The slow and measured step with\r\nwhich she left the room conveyed the sense of an irrevocable resolution.\r\nLost in thought, hugging her insults, too proud to show the slightest\r\nsuffering, she went to the guard-room at the Porte Saint-Leonard and\r\nasked where the commandant lived. She had hardly left her house when\r\nCorentin entered it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Monsieur Corentin," cried Francine, "if you are interested in this\r\nyoung man, save him; Mademoiselle has gone to give him up because of\r\nthis wretched letter."\r\n\r\nCorentin took the letter carelessly and asked,--\r\n\r\n"Which way did she go?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "I will save her from her own despair."\r\n\r\nHe disappeared, taking the letter with him. When he reached the street\r\nhe said to Galope-Chopine\'s boy, whom he had stationed to watch the\r\ndoor, "Which way did a lady go who left the house just now?"\r\n\r\nThe boy went with him a little way and showed him the steep street which\r\nled to the Porte Saint-Leonard. "That way," he said.\r\n\r\nAt this moment four men entered Mademoiselle de Verneuil\'s house, unseen\r\nby either the boy or Corentin.\r\n\r\n"Return to your watch," said the latter. "Play with the handles of the\r\nblinds and see what you can inside; look about you everywhere, even on\r\nthe roof."\r\n\r\nCorentin darted rapidly in the direction given him, and thought he\r\nrecognized Mademoiselle de Verneuil through the fog; he did, in fact,\r\novertake her just as she reached the guard-house.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" he said; "you are pale--what has happened? Is it\r\nright for you to be out alone? Take my arm."\r\n\r\n"Where is the commandant?" she asked.\r\n\r\nHardly had the words left her lips when she heard the movement of troops\r\nbeyond the Porte Saint-Leonard and distinguished Hulot\'s gruff voice in\r\nthe tumult.\r\n\r\n"God\'s thunder!" he cried, "I never saw such fog as this for a\r\nreconnaissance! The Gars must have ordered the weather."\r\n\r\n"What are you complaining of?" said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, grasping\r\nhis arm. "The fog will cover vengeance as well as perfidy. Commandant,"\r\nshe added, in a low voice, "you must take measures at once so that the\r\nGars may not escape us."\r\n\r\n"Is he at your house?" he asked, in a tone which showed his amazement.\r\n\r\n"Not yet," she replied; "but give me a safe man and I will send him to\r\nyou when the marquis comes."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a mistake," said Corentin; "a soldier will alarm him, but a boy,\r\nand I can find one, will not."\r\n\r\n"Commandant," said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, "thanks to this fog which\r\nyou are cursing, you can surround my house. Put soldiers everywhere.\r\nPlace a guard in the church to command the esplanade on which the\r\nwindows of my salon open. Post men on the Promenade; for though the\r\nwindows of my bedroom are twenty feet above the ground, despair does\r\nsometimes give a man the power to jump even greater distances safely.\r\nListen to what I say. I shall probably send this gentleman out of the\r\ndoor of my house; therefore see that only brave men are there to meet\r\nhim; for," she added, with a sigh, "no one denies him courage; he will\r\nassuredly defend himself."\r\n\r\n"Gudin!" called the commandant. "Listen, my lad," he continued in a low\r\nvoice when the young man joined him, "this devil of a girl is betraying\r\nthe Gars to us--I am sure I don\'t know why, but that\'s no matter. Take\r\nten men and place yourself so as to hold the cul-de-sac in which the\r\nhouse stands; be careful that no one sees either you or your men."\r\n\r\n"Yes, commandant, I know the ground."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Hulot. "I\'ll send Beau-Pied to let you know when\r\nto play your sabres. Try to meet the marquis yourself, and if you can\r\nmanage to kill him, so that I sha\'n\'t have to shoot him judicially, you\r\nshall be a lieutenant in a fortnight or my name\'s not Hulot."\r\n\r\nGudin departed with a dozen soldiers.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what you have done?" said Corentin to Mademoiselle de\r\nVerneuil, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, but looked with a sort of satisfaction at the\r\nmen who were starting, under command of the sub-lieutenant, for the\r\nPromenade, while others, following the next orders given by Hulot, were\r\nto post themselves in the shadows of the church of Saint-Leonard.\r\n\r\n"There are houses adjoining mine," she said; "you had better surround\r\nthem all. Don\'t lay up regrets by neglecting a single precaution."\r\n\r\n"She is mad," thought Hulot.\r\n\r\n"Was I not a prophet?" asked Corentin in his ear. "As for the boy\r\nI shall send with her, he is the little gars with a bloody foot;\r\ntherefore--"\r\n\r\nHe did not finish his sentence, for Mademoiselle de Verneuil by a sudden\r\nmovement darted in the direction of her house, whither he followed her,\r\nwhistling like a man supremely satisfied. When he overtook her she was\r\nalready at the door of her house, where Galope-Chopine\'s little boy was\r\non the watch.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," said Corentin, "take the lad with you; you cannot have\r\na more innocent or active emissary. Boy," he added, "when you have seen\r\nthe Gars enter the house come to me, no matter who stops you; you\'ll\r\nfind me at the guard-house and I\'ll give you something that will make\r\nyou eat cake for the rest of your days."\r\n\r\nAt these words, breathed rather than said in the child\'s ear, Corentin\r\nfelt his hand squeezed by that of the little Breton, who followed\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil into the house.\r\n\r\n"Now, my good friends, you can come to an explanation as soon as you\r\nlike," cried Corentin when the door was closed. "If you make love, my\r\nlittle marquis, it will be on your winding-sheet."\r\n\r\nBut Corentin could not bring himself to let that fatal house completely\r\nout of sight, and he went to the Promenade, where he found the\r\ncommandant giving his last orders. By this time it was night. Two hours\r\nwent by; but the sentinels posted at intervals noticed nothing that\r\nled them to suppose the marquis had evaded the triple line of men\r\nwho surrounded the three sides by which the tower of Papegaut was\r\naccessible. Twenty times had Corentin gone from the Promenade to the\r\nguard-room, always to find that his little emissary had not appeared.\r\nSunk in thought, the spy paced the Promenade slowly, enduring the\r\nmartyrdom to which three passions, terrible in their clashing, subject\r\na man,--love, avarice, and ambition. Eight o\'clock struck from all the\r\ntowers in the town. The moon rose late. Fog and darkness wrapped in\r\nimpenetrable gloom the places where the drama planned by this man\r\nwas coming to its climax. He was able to silence the struggle of his\r\npassions as he walked up and down, his arms crossed, and his eyes fixed\r\non the windows which rose like the luminous eyes of a phantom above the\r\nrampart. The deep silence was broken only by the rippling of the Nancon,\r\nby the regular and lugubrious tolling from the belfries, by the heavy\r\nsteps of the sentinels or the rattle of arms as the guard was hourly\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n"The night\'s as thick as a wolf\'s jaw," said the voice of Pille-Miche.\r\n\r\n"Go on," growled Marche-a-Terre, "and don\'t talk more than a dead dog."\r\n\r\n"I\'m hardly breathing," said the Chouan.\r\n\r\n"If the man who made that stone roll down wants his heart to serve as\r\nthe scabbard for my knife he\'ll do it again," said Marche-a-Terre, in a\r\nlow voice scarcely heard above the flowing of the river.\r\n\r\n"It was I," said Pille-Miche.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, old money-bag, down on your stomach," said the other, "and\r\nwriggle like a snake through a hedge, or we shall leave our carcasses\r\nbehind us sooner than we need."\r\n\r\n"Hey, Marche-a-Terre," said the incorrigible Pille-Miche, who was using\r\nhis hands to drag himself along on his stomach, and had reached the\r\nlevel of his comrade\'s ear. "If the Grande-Garce is to be believed\r\nthere\'ll be a fine booty to-day. Will you go shares with me?"\r\n\r\n"Look here, Pille-Miche," said Marche-a-Terre stopping short on the flat\r\nof his stomach. The other Chouans, who were accompanying the two men,\r\ndid the same, so wearied were they with the difficulties they had met\r\nwith in climbing the precipice. "I know you," continued Marche-a-Terre,\r\n"for a Jack Grab-All who would rather give blows than receive them when\r\nthere\'s nothing else to be done. We have not come here to grab dead\r\nmen\'s shoes; we are devils against devils, and sorrow to those whose\r\nclaws are too short. The Grande-Garce has sent us here to save the\r\nGars. He is up there; lift your dog\'s nose and see that window above the\r\ntower."\r\n\r\nMidnight was striking. The moon rose, giving the appearance of white\r\nsmoke to the fog. Pille-Miche squeezed Marche-a-Terre\'s arm and silently\r\nshowed him on the terrace just above them, the triangular iron of\r\nseveral shining bayonets.\r\n\r\n"The Blues are there already," said Pille-Miche; "we sha\'n\'t gain\r\nanything by force."\r\n\r\n"Patience," replied Marche-a-Terre; "if I examined right this morning,\r\nwe must be at the foot of the Papegaut tower between the ramparts and\r\nthe Promenade,--that place where they put the manure; it is like a\r\nfeather-bed to fall on."\r\n\r\n"If Saint-Labre," remarked Pille-Miche, "would only change into cider\r\nthe blood we shall shed to-night the citizens might lay in a good stock\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\nMarche-a-Terre laid his large hand over his friend\'s mouth; then an\r\norder muttered by him went from rank to rank of the Chouans suspended\r\nas they were in mid-air among the brambles of the slate rocks. Corentin,\r\nwalking up and down the esplanade had too practiced an ear not to hear\r\nthe rustling of the shrubs and the light sound of pebbles rolling down\r\nthe sides of the precipice. Marche-a-Terre, who seemed to possess the\r\ngift of seeing in darkness, and whose senses, continually in action,\r\nwere acute as those of a savage, saw Corentin; like a trained dog he had\r\nscented him. Fouche\'s diplomatist listened but heard nothing; he looked\r\nat the natural wall of rock and saw no signs. If the confusing gleam of\r\nthe fog enabled him to see, here and there, a crouching Chouan, he took\r\nhim, no doubt, for a fragment of rock, for these human bodies had all\r\nthe appearance of inert nature. This danger to the invaders was of short\r\nduration. Corentin\'s attention was diverted by a very distinct noise\r\ncoming from the other end of the Promenade, where the rock wall ended\r\nand a steep descent leading down to the Queen\'s Staircase began. When\r\nCorentin reached the spot he saw a figure gliding past it as if by\r\nmagic. Putting out his hand to grasp this real or fantastic being, who\r\nwas there, he supposed, with no good intentions, he encountered the soft\r\nand rounded figure of a woman.\r\n\r\n"The devil take you!" he exclaimed, "if any one else had met you, you\'d\r\nhave had a ball through your head. What are you doing, and where are you\r\ngoing, at this time of night? Are you dumb? It certainly is a woman," he\r\nsaid to himself.\r\n\r\nThe silence was suspicious, but the stranger broke it by saying, in a\r\nvoice which suggested extreme fright, "Ah, my good man, I\'m on my way\r\nback from a wake."\r\n\r\n"It is the pretended mother of the marquis," thought Corentin. "I\'ll see\r\nwhat she\'s about. Well, go that way, old woman," he replied, feigning\r\nnot to recognize her. "Keep to the left if you don\'t want to be shot."\r\n\r\nHe stood quite still; then observing that Madame du Gua was making\r\nfor the Papegaut tower, he followed her at a distance with diabolical\r\ncaution. During this fatal encounter the Chouans had posted themselves\r\non the manure towards which Marche-a-Terre had guided them.\r\n\r\n"There\'s the Grande-Garce!" thought Marche-a-Terre, as he rose to his\r\nfeet against the tower wall like a bear.\r\n\r\n"We are here," he said to her in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Good," she replied, "there\'s a ladder in the garden of that house about\r\nsix feet above the manure; find it, and the Gars is saved. Do you see\r\nthat small window up there? It is in the dressing-room; you must get to\r\nit. This side of the tower is the only one not watched. The horses are\r\nready; if you can hold the passage over the Nancon, a quarter of an hour\r\nwill put him out of danger--in spite of his folly. But if that woman\r\ntries to follow him, stab her."\r\n\r\nCorentin now saw several of the forms he had hitherto supposed to be\r\nstones moving cautiously but swiftly. He went at once to the guard-room\r\nat the Porte Saint-Leonard, where he found the commandant fully dressed\r\nand sound asleep on a camp bed.\r\n\r\n"Let him alone," said Beau-Pied, roughly, "he has only just lain down."\r\n\r\n"The Chouans are here!" cried Corentin, in Hulot\'s ear.\r\n\r\n"Impossible! but so much the better," cried the old soldier, still half\r\nasleep; "then he can fight."\r\n\r\nWhen Hulot reached the Promenade Corentin pointed out to him the\r\nsingular position taken by the Chouans.\r\n\r\n"They must have deceived or strangled the sentries I placed between the\r\ncastle and the Queen\'s Staircase. Ah! what a devil of a fog! However,\r\npatience! I\'ll send a squad of men under a lieutenant to the foot of the\r\nrock. There is no use attacking them where they are, for those animals\r\nare so hard they\'d let themselves roll down the precipice without\r\nbreaking a limb."\r\n\r\nThe cracked clock of the belfry was ringing two when the commandant\r\ngot back to the Promenade after giving these orders and taking every\r\nmilitary precaution to seize the Chouans. The sentries were doubled and\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil\'s house became the centre of a little army.\r\nHulot found Corentin absorbed in contemplation of the window which\r\noverlooked the tower.\r\n\r\n"Citizen," said the commandant, "I think the _ci-devant_ has fooled us;\r\nthere\'s nothing stirring."\r\n\r\n"He is there," cried Corentin, pointing to the window. "I have seen a\r\nman\'s shadow on the curtain. But I can\'t think what has become of that\r\nboy. They must have killed him or locked him up. There! commandant,\r\ndon\'t you see that? there\'s a man\'s shadow; come, come on!"\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t seize him in bed; thunder of God! He will come out if he\r\nwent in; Gudin won\'t miss him," cried Hulot, who had his own reasons for\r\nwaiting till the Gars could defend himself.\r\n\r\n"Commandant, I enjoin you, in the name of the law to proceed at once\r\ninto that house."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a fine scoundrel to try to make me do that."\r\n\r\nWithout showing any resentment at the commandant\'s language, Corentin\r\nsaid coolly: "You will obey me. Here is an order in good form, signed\r\nby the minister of war, which will force you to do so." He drew a paper\r\nfrom his pocket and held it out. "Do you suppose we are such fools as\r\nto leave that girl to do as she likes? We are endeavoring to suppress a\r\ncivil war, and the grandeur of the purpose covers the pettiness of the\r\nmeans."\r\n\r\n"I take the liberty, citizen, of sending you to--you understand me?\r\nEnough. To the right-about, march! Let me alone, or it will be the worse\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\n"But read that," persisted Corentin.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t bother me with your functions," cried Hulot, furious at receiving\r\norders from a man he regarded as contemptible.\r\n\r\nAt this instant Galope-Chopine\'s boy suddenly appeared among them like a\r\nrat from a hole.\r\n\r\n"The Gars has started!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"Which way?"\r\n\r\n"The rue Saint-Leonard."\r\n\r\n"Beau-Pied," said Hulot in a whisper to the corporal who was near him,\r\n"go and tell your lieutenant to draw in closer round the house, and make\r\nready to fire. Left wheel, forward on the tower, the rest of you!" he\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\nTo understand the conclusion of this fatal drama we must re-enter\r\nthe house with Mademoiselle de Verneuil when she returned to it after\r\ndenouncing the marquis to the commandant.\r\n\r\nWhen passions reach their crisis they bring us under the dominion of far\r\ngreater intoxication than the petty excitements of wine or opium. The\r\nlucidity then given to ideas, the delicacy of the high-wrought senses,\r\nproduce the most singular and unexpected effects. Some persons when\r\nthey find themselves under the tyranny of a single thought can see with\r\nextraordinary distinctness objects scarcely visible to others, while at\r\nthe same time the most palpable things become to them almost as if they\r\ndid not exist. When Mademoiselle de Verneuil hurried, after reading\r\nthe marquis\'s letter, to prepare the way for vengeance just as she had\r\nlately been preparing all for love, she was in that stage of mental\r\nintoxication which makes real life like the life of a somnambulist. But\r\nwhen she saw her house surrounded, by her own orders, with a triple line\r\nof bayonets a sudden flash of light illuminated her soul. She judged her\r\nconduct and saw with horror that she had committed a crime. Under the\r\nfirst shock of this conviction she sprang to the threshold of the door\r\nand stood there irresolute, striving to think, yet unable to follow out\r\nher reasoning. She knew so vaguely what had happened that she tried in\r\nvain to remember why she was in the antechamber, and why she was leading\r\na strange child by the hand. A million of stars were floating in the air\r\nbefore her like tongues of fire. She began to walk about, striving to\r\nshake off the horrible torpor which laid hold of her; but, like one\r\nasleep, no object appeared to her under its natural form or in its\r\nown colors. She grasped the hand of the little boy with a violence not\r\nnatural to her, dragging him along with such precipitate steps that she\r\nseemed to have the motions of a madwoman. She saw neither persons nor\r\nthings in the salon as she crossed it, and yet she was saluted by three\r\nmen who made way to let her pass.\r\n\r\n"That must be she," said one of them.\r\n\r\n"She is very handsome," exclaimed another, who was a priest.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the first; "but how pale and agitated--"\r\n\r\n"And beside herself," said the third; "she did not even see us."\r\n\r\nAt the door of her own room Mademoiselle de Verneuil saw the smiling\r\nface of Francine, who whispered to her: "He is here, Marie."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil awoke, reflected, looked at the child whose\r\nhand she held, remembered all, and replied to the girl: "Shut up that\r\nboy; if you wish me to live do not let him escape you."\r\n\r\nAs she slowly said the words her eyes were fixed on the door of her\r\nbedroom, and there they continued fastened with so dreadful a fixedness\r\nthat it seemed as if she saw her victim through the wooden panels. Then\r\nshe gently opened it, passed through and closed it behind her without\r\nturning round, for she saw the marquis standing before the fireplace.\r\nHis dress, without being too choice, had the look of careful arrangement\r\nwhich adds so much to the admiration which a woman feels for her lover.\r\nAll her self-possession came back to her at the sight of him. Her lips,\r\nrigid, although half-open, showed the enamel of her white teeth and\r\nformed a smile that was fixed and terrible rather than voluptuous. She\r\nwalked with slow steps toward the young man and pointed with her finger\r\nto the clock.\r\n\r\n"A man who is worthy of love is worth waiting for," she said with\r\ndeceptive gaiety.\r\n\r\nThen, overcome with the violence of her emotions, she dropped upon the\r\nsofa which was near the fireplace.\r\n\r\n"Dear Marie, you are so charming when you are angry," said the marquis,\r\nsitting down beside her and taking her hand, which she let him take, and\r\nentreating a look, which she refused him. "I hope," he continued, in a\r\ntender, caressing voice, "that my wife will not long refuse a glance to\r\nher loving husband."\r\n\r\nHearing the words she turned abruptly and looked into his eyes.\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of that dreadful look?" he said, laughing. "But\r\nyour hand is burning! oh, my love, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"Your love!" she repeated, in a dull, changed voice.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, throwing himself on his knees beside her and taking her\r\ntwo hands which he covered with kisses. "Yes, my love--I am thine for\r\nlife."\r\n\r\nShe pushed him violently away from her and rose. Her features\r\ncontracted, she laughed as mad people laugh, and then she said to him:\r\n"You do not mean one word of all you are saying, base man--baser than\r\nthe lowest villain." She sprang to the dagger which was lying beside\r\na flower-vase, and let it sparkle before the eyes of the amazed young\r\nmarquis. "Bah!" she said, flinging it away from her, "I do not respect\r\nyou enough to kill you. Your blood is even too vile to be shed by\r\nsoldiers; I see nothing fit for you but the executioner."\r\n\r\nThe words were painfully uttered in a low voice, and she moved her feet\r\nlike a spoilt child, impatiently. The marquis went to her and tried to\r\nclasp her.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t touch me!" she cried, recoiling from him with a look of horror.\r\n\r\n"She is mad!" said the marquis in despair.\r\n\r\n"Mad, yes!" she repeated, "but not mad enough to be your dupe. What\r\nwould I not forgive to passion? but to seek to possess me without love,\r\nand to write to that woman--"\r\n\r\n"To whom have I written?" he said, with an astonishment which was\r\ncertainly not feigned.\r\n\r\n"To that chaste woman who sought to kill me."\r\n\r\nThe marquis turned pale with anger and said, grasping the back of a\r\nchair until he broke it, "If Madame du Gua has committed some dastardly\r\nwrong--"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil looked for the letter; not finding it she\r\ncalled to Francine.\r\n\r\n"Where is that letter?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Corentin took it."\r\n\r\n"Corentin! ah! I understand it all; he wrote the letter; he has deceived\r\nme with diabolical art--as he alone can deceive."\r\n\r\nWith a piercing cry she flung herself on the sofa, tears rushing from\r\nher eyes. Doubt and confidence were equally dreadful now. The marquis\r\nknelt beside her and clasped her to his breast, saying, again and again,\r\nthe only words he was able to utter:--\r\n\r\n"Why do you weep, my darling? there is no harm done; your reproaches\r\nwere all love; do not weep, I love you--I shall always love you."\r\n\r\nSuddenly he felt her press him with almost supernatural force. "Do you\r\nstill love me?" she said, amid her sobs.\r\n\r\n"Can you doubt it?" he replied in a tone that was almost melancholy.\r\n\r\nShe abruptly disengaged herself from his arms, and fled, as if\r\nfrightened and confused, to a little distance.\r\n\r\n"Do I doubt it?" she exclaimed, but a smile of gentle meaning was on her\r\nlover\'s face, and the words died away upon her lips; she let him take\r\nher by the hand and lead her to the salon. There an altar had been\r\nhastily arranged during her absence. The priest was robed in his\r\nofficiating vestments. The lighted tapers shed upon the ceiling a glow\r\nas soft as hope itself. She now recognized the two men who had bowed to\r\nher, the Comte de Bauvan and the Baron du Guenic, the witnesses chosen\r\nby Montauran.\r\n\r\n"You will not still refuse?" said the marquis.\r\n\r\nBut at the sight she stopped, stepped backward into her chamber and\r\nfell on her knees; raising her hands towards the marquis she cried out:\r\n"Pardon! pardon! pardon!"\r\n\r\nHer voice died away, her head fell back, her eyes closed, and she lay in\r\nthe arms of her lover and Francine as if dead. When she opened her eyes\r\nthey met those of the young man full of loving tenderness.\r\n\r\n"Marie! patience! this is your last trial," he said.\r\n\r\n"The last!" she exclaimed, bitterly.\r\n\r\nFrancine and the marquis looked at each other in surprise, but she\r\nsilenced them by a gesture.\r\n\r\n"Call the priest," she said, "and leave me alone with him."\r\n\r\nThey did so, and withdrew.\r\n\r\n"My father," she said to the priest so suddenly called to her, "in my\r\nchildhood an old man, white-haired like yourself, used to tell me that\r\nGod would grant all things to those who had faith. Is that true?"\r\n\r\n"It is true," replied the priest; "all things are possible to Him who\r\ncreated all."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Verneuil threw herself on her knees before him with\r\nincredible enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God!" she cried in ecstasy, "my faith in thee is equal to my\r\nlove for him; inspire me! do here a miracle, or take my life!"\r\n\r\n"Your prayer will be granted," said the priest.\r\n\r\nMarie returned to the salon leaning on the arm of the venerable old\r\nman. A deep and secret emotion brought her to the arms of her lover more\r\nbrilliant than on any of her past days, for a serenity like that which\r\npainters give to the martyrs added to her face an imposing dignity. She\r\nheld out her hand to the marquis and together they advanced to the\r\naltar and knelt down. The marriage was about to be celebrated beside\r\nthe nuptial bed, the altar hastily raised, the cross, the vessels, the\r\nchalice, secretly brought thither by the priest, the fumes of incense\r\nrising to the ceiling, the priest himself, who wore a stole above his\r\ncassock, the tapers on an altar in a salon,--all these things combined\r\nto form a strange and touching scene, which typified those times of\r\nsaddest memory, when civil discord overthrew all sacred institutions.\r\nReligious ceremonies then had the savor of the mysteries. Children were\r\nbaptized in the chambers where the mothers were still groaning from\r\ntheir labor. As in the olden time, the Saviour went, poor and lowly,\r\nto console the dying. Young girls received their first communion in the\r\nhome where they had played since infancy. The marriage of the marquis\r\nand Mademoiselle de Verneuil was now solemnized, like many other unions,\r\nby a service contrary to the recent legal enactments. In after\r\nyears these marriages, mostly celebrated at the foot of oaks, were\r\nscrupulously recognized and considered legal. The priest who thus\r\npreserved the ancient usages was one of those men who hold to their\r\nprinciples in the height of the storm. His voice, which never made the\r\noath exacted by the Republic, uttered no word throughout the tempest\r\nthat did not make for peace. He never incited, like the Abbe Gudin, to\r\nfire and sword; but like many others, he devoted himself to the still\r\nmore dangerous mission of performing his priestly functions for the\r\nsouls of faithful Catholics. To accomplish this perilous ministry he\r\nused all the pious deceptions necessitated by persecution, and the\r\nmarquis, when he sought his services on this occasion, had found him in\r\none of those excavated caverns which are known, even to the present day,\r\nby the name of "the priest\'s hiding-place." The mere sight of that pale\r\nand suffering face was enough to give this worldly room a holy aspect.\r\n\r\nAll was now ready for the act of misery and of joy. Before beginning the\r\nceremony the priest asked, in the dead silence, the names of the bride.\r\n\r\n"Marie-Nathalie, daughter of Mademoiselle Blanche de Casteran, abbess,\r\ndeceased, of Notre-Dame de Seez, and Victor-Amedee, Duc de Verneuil."\r\n\r\n"Where born?"\r\n\r\n"At La Chasterie, near Alencon."\r\n\r\n"I never supposed," said the baron in a low voice to the count, "that\r\nMontauran would have the folly to marry her. The natural daughter of a\r\nduke!--horrid!"\r\n\r\n"If it were of the king, well and good," replied the Comte de Bauvan,\r\nsmiling. "However, it is not for me to blame him; I like Charette\'s\r\nmistress full as well; and I shall transfer the war to her--though she\'s\r\nnot one to bill and coo."\r\n\r\nThe names of the marquis had been filled in previously, and the two\r\nlovers now signed the document with their witnesses. The ceremony then\r\nbegan. At that instant Marie, and she alone, heard the sound of muskets\r\nand the heavy tread of soldiers,--no doubt relieving the guard in the\r\nchurch which she had herself demanded. She trembled violently and raised\r\nher eyes to the cross on the altar.\r\n\r\n"A saint at last," said Francine, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Give me such saints, and I\'ll be devilishly devout," added the count,\r\nin a whisper.\r\n\r\nWhen the priest made the customary inquiry of Mademoiselle de Verneuil,\r\nshe answered by a "yes" uttered with a deep sigh. Bending to her\r\nhusband\'s ear she said: "You will soon know why I have broken the oath I\r\nmade never to marry you."\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony all present passed into the dining-room, where dinner\r\nwas served, and as they took their places Jeremie, Marie\'s footman, came\r\ninto the room terrified. The poor bride rose and went to him; Francine\r\nfollowed her. With one of those pretexts which never fail a woman, she\r\nbegged the marquis to do the honors for a moment, and went out, taking\r\nJeremie with her before he could utter the fatal words.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Francine, to be dying a thousand deaths and not to die!" she cried.\r\n\r\nThis absence might well be supposed to have its cause in the ceremony\r\nthat had just taken place. Towards the end of the dinner, as the marquis\r\nwas beginning to feel uneasy, Marie returned in all the pomp of a bridal\r\nrobe. Her face was calm and joyful, while that of Francine who followed\r\nher had terror imprinted on every feature, so that the guests might well\r\nhave thought they saw in these two women a fantastic picture by Salvator\r\nRosa, of Life and Death holding each other by the hand.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Marie to the priest, the baron, and the count, "you\r\nare my guests for the night. I find you cannot leave Fougeres; it would\r\nbe dangerous to attempt it. My good maid has instructions to make you\r\ncomfortable in your apartments. No, you must not rebel," she added to\r\nthe priest, who was about to speak. "I hope you will not thwart a woman\r\non her wedding-day."\r\n\r\nAn hour later she was alone with her husband in the room she had so\r\njoyously arranged a few hours earlier. They had reached that fatal bed\r\nwhere, like a tomb, so many hopes are wrecked, where the waking to a\r\nhappy life is all uncertain, where love is born or dies, according to\r\nthe natures that are tried there. Marie looked at the clock. "Six hours\r\nto live," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Can I have slept?" she cried toward morning, wakening with one of those\r\nsudden movements which rouse us when we have made ourselves a promise to\r\nwake at a certain hour. "Yes, I have slept," she thought, seeing by the\r\nlight of the candles that the hands of the clock were pointing to two in\r\nthe morning. She turned and looked at the sleeping marquis, lying like a\r\nchild with his head on one hand, the other clasping his wife\'s hand, his\r\nlips half smiling as though he had fallen asleep while she kissed him.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she whispered to herself, "he sleeps like an infant; he does not\r\ndistrust me--me, to whom he has given a happiness without a name."\r\n\r\nShe touched him softly and he woke, continuing to smile. He kissed the\r\nhand he held and looked at the wretched woman with eyes so sparkling\r\nthat she could not endure their light and slowly lowered her large\r\neyelids. Her husband might justly have accused her of coquetry if she\r\nwere not concealing the terrors of her soul by thus evading the fire of\r\nhis looks. Together they raised their charming heads and made each other\r\na sign of gratitude for the pleasures they had tasted; but after a rapid\r\nglance at the beautiful picture his wife presented, the marquis was\r\nstruck with an expression on her face which seemed to him melancholy,\r\nand he said in a tender voice, "Why sad, dear love?"\r\n\r\n"Poor Alphonse," she answered, "do you know to what I have led you?"\r\n\r\n"To happiness."\r\n\r\n"To death!"\r\n\r\nShuddering with horror she sprang from the bed; the marquis, astonished,\r\nfollowed her. His wife motioned him to a window and raised the curtain,\r\npointing as she did so to a score of soldiers. The moon had scattered\r\nthe fog and was now casting her white light on the muskets and the\r\nuniforms, on the impassible Corentin pacing up and down like a jackal\r\nwaiting for his prey, on the commandant, standing still, his arms\r\ncrossed, his nose in the air, his lips curling, watchful and displeased.\r\n\r\n"Come, Marie, leave them and come back to me."\r\n\r\n"Why do you smile? I placed them there."\r\n\r\n"You are dreaming."\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other for a moment. The marquis divined the whole\r\ntruth, and he took her in his arms. "No matter!" he said, "I love you\r\nstill."\r\n\r\n"All is not lost!" cried Marie, "it cannot be! Alphonse," she said after\r\na pause, "there is hope."\r\n\r\nAt this moment they distinctly heard the owl\'s cry, and Francine entered\r\nfrom the dressing-room.\r\n\r\n"Pierre has come!" she said with a joy that was like delirium.\r\n\r\nThe marquise and Francine dressed Montauran in Chouan clothes with that\r\namazing rapidity that belongs only to women. As soon as Marie saw her\r\nhusband loading the gun Francine had brought in she slipped hastily\r\nfrom the room with a sign to her faithful maid. Francine then took the\r\nmarquis to the dressing-room adjoining the bed-chamber. The young man\r\nseeing a large number of sheets knotted firmly together, perceived the\r\nmeans by which the girl expected him to escape the vigilance of the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t get through there," he said, examining the bull\'s-eye window.\r\n\r\nAt that instant it was darkened by a thickset figure, and a hoarse\r\nvoice, known to Francine, said in a whisper, "Make haste, general, those\r\nrascally Blues are stirring."\r\n\r\n"Oh! one more kiss," said a trembling voice beside him.\r\n\r\nThe marquis, whose feet were already on the liberating ladder, though\r\nhe was not wholly through the window, felt his neck clasped with a\r\ndespairing pressure. Seeing that his wife had put on his clothes, he\r\ntried to detain her; but she tore herself roughly from his arms and\r\nhe was forced to descend. In his hand he held a fragment of some stuff\r\nwhich the moonlight showed him was a piece of the waistcoat he had worn\r\nthe night before.\r\n\r\n"Halt! fire!"\r\n\r\nThese words uttered by Hulot in the midst of a silence that was\r\nalmost horrible broke the spell which seemed to hold the men and their\r\nsurroundings. A volley of balls coming from the valley and reaching to\r\nthe foot of the tower succeeded the discharges of the Blues posted on\r\nthe Promenade. Not a cry came from the Chouans. Between each discharge\r\nthe silence was frightful.\r\n\r\nBut Corentin had heard a fall from the ladder on the precipice side of\r\nthe tower, and he suspected some ruse.\r\n\r\n"None of those animals are growling," he said to Hulot; "our lovers\r\nare capable of fooling us on this side, and escaping themselves on the\r\nother."\r\n\r\nThe spy, to clear up the mystery, sent for torches; Hulot, understanding\r\nthe force of Corentin\'s supposition, and hearing the noise of a serious\r\nstruggle in the direction of the Porte Saint-Leonard, rushed to the\r\nguard-house exclaiming: "That\'s true, they won\'t separate."\r\n\r\n"His head is well-riddled, commandant," said Beau-Pied, who was the\r\nfirst to meet him, "but he killed Gudin, and wounded two men. Ha!\r\nthe savage; he got through three ranks of our best men and would have\r\nreached the fields if it hadn\'t been for the sentry at the gate who\r\nspitted him on his bayonet."\r\n\r\nThe commandant rushed into the guard-room and saw on a camp bedstead a\r\nbloody body which had just been laid there. He went up to the supposed\r\nmarquis, raised the hat which covered the face, and fell into a chair.\r\n\r\n"I suspected it!" he cried, crossing his arms violently; "she kept him,\r\ncursed thunder! too long."\r\n\r\nThe soldiers stood about, motionless. The commandant himself unfastened\r\nthe long black hair of a woman. Suddenly the silence was broken by the\r\ntramp of men and Corentin entered the guardroom, preceding four soldiers\r\nwho bore on their guns, crossed to make a litter, the body of Montauran,\r\nwho was shot in the thighs and arms. They laid him on the bedstead\r\nbeside his wife. He saw her, and found strength to clasp her hand with\r\na convulsive gesture. The dying woman turned her head, recognized her\r\nhusband, and shuddered with a spasm that was horrible to see, murmuring\r\nin a voice almost extinct: "A day without a morrow! God heard me too\r\nwell!"\r\n\r\n"Commandant," said the marquis, collecting all his strength, and still\r\nholding Marie\'s hand, "I count on your honor to send the news of my\r\ndeath to my young brother, who is now in London. Write him that if he\r\nwishes to obey my last injunction he will never bear arms against his\r\ncountry--neither must he abandon the king\'s service."\r\n\r\n"It shall be done," said Hulot, pressing the hand of the dying man.\r\n\r\n"Take them to the nearest hospital," cried Corentin.\r\n\r\nHulot took the spy by the arm with a grip that left the imprint of his\r\nfingers on the flesh.\r\n\r\n"Out of this camp!" he cried; "your business is done here. Look well at\r\nthe face of Commander Hulot, and never find yourself again in his way if\r\nyou don\'t want your belly to be the scabbard of his blade--"\r\n\r\nAnd the older soldier flourished his sabre.\r\n\r\n"That\'s another of the honest men who will never make their way," said\r\nCorentin to himself when he was some distance from the guard-room.\r\n\r\nThe marquis was still able to thank his gallant adversary by a look\r\nmarking the respect which all soldiers feel for loyal enemies.\r\n\r\n             *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn 1827 an old man accompanied by his wife was buying cattle in the\r\nmarket-place of Fougeres. Few persons remembered that he had killed\r\na hundred or more men, and that his former name was Marche-a-Terre. A\r\nperson to whom we owe important information about all the personages of\r\nthis drama saw him there, leading a cow, and was struck by his simple,\r\ningenuous air, which led her to remark, "That must be a worthy man."\r\n\r\nAs for Cibot, otherwise called Pille-Miche, we already know his end. It\r\nis likely that Marche-a-Terre made some attempt to save his comrade from\r\nthe scaffold; possibly he was in the square at Alencon on the occasion\r\nof the frightful tumult which was one of the events of the famous trial\r\nof Rifoel, Briond, and la Chanterie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDUM\r\n\r\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\r\n\r\n     Berthier, Alexandre\r\n       The Gondreville Mystery\r\n\r\n     Brigaut, Major\r\n       Pierrette\r\n\r\n     Casteran, De\r\n       The Seamy Side of History\r\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\r\n       Beatrix\r\n       The Peasantry\r\n\r\n     Cibot, Jean (alias Pille-Miche)\r\n       The Seamy Side of History\r\n\r\n     Corentin\r\n       The Gondreville Mystery\r\n       Scenes from a Courtesan\'s Life\r\n       The Middle Classes\r\n\r\n     Esgrignon, Charles-Marie-Victor-Ange-Carol,\r\n       Marquis d\' (or Des Grignons)\r\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\r\n\r\n     Falcon, Jean (alias Beaupied or Beau-Pied)\r\n       The Muse of the Department\r\n       Cousin Betty\r\n\r\n     Ferdinand\r\n       Beatrix\r\n\r\n     Fontaine, Comte de\r\n       Modeste Mignon\r\n       The Ball at Sceaux\r\n       Cesar Birotteau\r\n       The Government Clerks\r\n\r\n     Fouche, Joseph\r\n       The Gondreville Mystery\r\n       Scenes from a Courtesan\'s Life\r\n\r\n     Guenic, Gaudebert-Calyste-Charles, Baron du\r\n       Beatrix\r\n\r\n     Hulot (Marshal)\r\n       The Muse of the Department\r\n       Cousin Betty\r\n\r\n     La Billardiere, Athanase-Jean-Francois-Michel, Baron Flamet de\r\n       Cesar Birotteau\r\n       The Government Clerks\r\n\r\n     Leroi, Pierre\r\n       The Seamy Side of History\r\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\r\n\r\n     Loudon, Prince de\r\n       Modeste Mignon\r\n\r\n     Louis XVIII., Louis-Stanislas-Xavier\r\n       The Seamy Side of History\r\n       The Gondreville Mystery\r\n       Scenes from a Courtesan\'s Life\r\n       The Ball at Sceaux\r\n       The Lily of the Valley\r\n       Colonel Chabert\r\n       The Government Clerks\r\n\r\n     Montauran, Marquis Alphonse de\r\n       Cesar Birotteau\r\n\r\n     Montauran, Marquis de (younger brother of Alphonse de)\r\n       The Seamy Side of History\r\n       Cousin Betty\r\n\r\n     Stael-Holstein (Anne-Louise-Germaine Necker) Baronne de\r\n       Louis Lambert\r\n       Letters of Two Brides\r\n\r\n     Talleyrand-Perigord, Charles-Maurice de\r\n       The Gondreville Mystery\r\n       The Thirteen\r\n       Letters of Two Brides\r\n       Gaudissart II.\r\n\r\n     Troisville, Guibelin, Vicomte de\r\n       The Seamy Side of History\r\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\r\n       The Peasantry\r\n\r\n     Valois, Chevalier de\r\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\r\n\r\n     Verneuil, Duc de\r\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\r\n\r\n     Vissard, Charles-Amedee-Louis-Joseph Rifoel, Chevalier du\r\n       The Seamy Side of History\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Chouans, by Honore de Balzac\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CHOUANS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1921.txt or 1921.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/2/1921/\r\n\r\nProduced by John Bickers, and Dagny\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
