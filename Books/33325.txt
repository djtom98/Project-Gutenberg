Knowing the church to be\r\nnear, she prepared in her room for the little rural walk, and on her way\r\ndown again, passing through corridors and observing imbecilities of\r\ndecoration, the \xe6sthetic misery of the big commodious house, she felt a\r\nreturn of the tide of last night\'s irritation, a renewal of everything\r\nshe could secretly suffer from ugliness and stupidity. Why did she\r\nconsent to such contacts, why did she so rashly expose herself? She had\r\nhad, heaven knew, her reasons, but the whole experience was to be\r\nsharper than she had feared. To get away from it and out into the air,\r\ninto the presence of sky and trees, flowers and birds, was a necessity\r\nof every nerve. The flowers at Waterbath would probably go wrong in\r\ncolor and the nightingales sing out of tune; but she remembered to have\r\nheard the place described as possessing those advantages that are\r\nusually spoken of as natural. There were advantages enough it clearly\r\ndidn\'t possess. It was hard for her to believe that a woman could look\r\npresentable who had been kept awake for hours by the wall-paper in her\r\nroom; yet none the less, as in her fresh widow\'s weeds she rustled\r\nacross the hall, she was sustained by the consciousness, which always\r\nadded to the unction of her social Sundays, that she was, as usual, the\r\nonly person in the house incapable of wearing in her preparation the\r\nhorrible stamp of the same exceptional smartness that would be\r\nconspicuous in a grocer\'s wife. She would rather have perished than have\r\nlooked _endimanch\xe9e_.\r\n\r\nShe was fortunately not challenged, the hall being empty of the other\r\nwomen, who were engaged precisely in arraying themselves to that dire\r\nend. Once in the grounds, she recognized that, with a site, a view that\r\nstruck the note, set an example to its inmates, Waterbath ought to have\r\nbeen charming. How she herself, with such elements to handle, would have\r\ntaken the fine hint of nature! Suddenly, at the turn of a walk, she came\r\non a member of the party, a young lady seated on a bench in deep and\r\nlonely meditation. She had observed the girl at dinner and afterwards:\r\nshe was always looking at girls with an apprehensive or speculative\r\nreference to her son. Deep in her heart was a conviction that Owen\r\nwould, in spite of all her spells, marry at last a frump; and this from\r\nno evidence that she could have represented as adequate, but simply from\r\nher deep uneasiness, her belief that such a special sensibility as her\r\nown could have been inflicted on a woman only as a source of anguish. It\r\nwould be her fate, her discipline, her cross, to have a frump brought\r\nhideously home to her. This girl, one of the two Vetches, had no beauty,\r\nbut Mrs. Gereth, scanning the dullness for a sign of life, had been\r\nstraightway able to classify such a figure as the least, for the moment,\r\nof her afflictions. Fleda Vetch was dressed with an idea, though perhaps\r\nwith not much else; and that made a bond when there was none other,\r\nespecially as in this case the idea was real, not imitation. Mrs. Gereth\r\nhad long ago generalized the truth that the temperament of the frump is\r\namply consistent with a certain usual prettiness. There were five girls\r\nin the party, and the prettiness of this one, slim, pale, and\r\nblack-haired, was less likely than that of the others ever to occasion\r\nan exchange of platitudes. The two less developed Brigstocks, daughters\r\nof the house, were in particular tiresomely "lovely." A second glance,\r\nthis morning, at the young lady before her conveyed to Mrs. Gereth the\r\nsoothing assurance that she also was guiltless of looking hot and fine.\r\nThey had had no talk as yet, but this was a note that would effectually\r\nintroduce them if the girl should show herself in the least conscious of\r\ntheir community. She got up from her seat with a smile that but partly\r\ndissipated the prostration Mrs. Gereth had recognized in her attitude.\r\nThe elder woman drew her down again, and for a minute, as they sat\r\ntogether, their eyes met and sent out mutual soundings. "Are you safe?\r\nCan I utter it?" each of them said to the other, quickly recognizing,\r\nalmost proclaiming, their common need to escape. The tremendous fancy,\r\nas it came to be called, that Mrs. Gereth was destined to take to Fleda\r\nVetch virtually began with this discovery that the poor child had been\r\nmoved to flight even more promptly than herself. That the poor child no\r\nless quickly perceived how far she could now go was proved by the\r\nimmense friendliness with which she instantly broke out: "Isn\'t it too\r\ndreadful?"\r\n\r\n"Horrible--horrible!" cried Mrs. Gereth, with a laugh, "and it\'s really\r\na comfort to be able to say it." She had an idea, for it was her\r\nambition, that she successfully made a secret of that awkward oddity,\r\nher proneness to be rendered unhappy by the presence of the dreadful.\r\nHer passion for the exquisite was the cause of this, but it was a\r\npassion she considered that she never advertised nor gloried in,\r\ncontenting herself with letting it regulate her steps and show quietly\r\nin her life, remembering at all times that there are few things more\r\nsoundless than a deep devotion. She was therefore struck with the\r\nacuteness of the little girl who had already put a finger on her hidden\r\nspring. What was dreadful now, what was horrible, was the intimate\r\nugliness of Waterbath, and it was of that phenomenon these ladies talked\r\nwhile they sat in the shade and drew refreshment from the great tranquil\r\nsky, from which no blue saucers were suspended. It was an ugliness\r\nfundamental and systematic, the result of the abnormal nature of the\r\nBrigstocks, from whose composition the principle of taste had been\r\nextravagantly omitted. In the arrangement of their home some other\r\nprinciple, remarkably active, but uncanny and obscure, had operated\r\ninstead, with consequences depressing to behold, consequences that took\r\nthe form of a universal futility. The house was bad in all conscience,\r\nbut it might have passed if they had only let it alone. This saving\r\nmercy was beyond them; they had smothered it with trumpery ornament and\r\nscrapbook art, with strange excrescences and bunchy draperies, with\r\ngimcracks that might have been keepsakes for maid-servants and\r\nnondescript conveniences that might have been prizes for the blind. They\r\nhad gone wildly astray over carpets and curtains; they had an infallible\r\ninstinct for disaster, and were so cruelly doom-ridden that it rendered\r\nthem almost tragic. Their drawing-room, Mrs. Gereth lowered her voice to\r\nmention, caused her face to burn, and each of the new friends confided\r\nto the other that in her own apartment she had given way to tears. There\r\nwas in the elder lady\'s a set of comic water-colors, a family joke by a\r\nfamily genius, and in the younger\'s a souvenir from some centennial or\r\nother Exhibition, that they shudderingly alluded to. The house was\r\nperversely full of souvenirs of places even more ugly than itself and of\r\nthings it would have been a pious duty to forget. The worst horror was\r\nthe acres of varnish, something advertised and smelly, with which\r\neverything was smeared; it was Fleda Vetch\'s conviction that the\r\napplication of it, by their own hands and hilariously shoving each\r\nother, was the amusement of the Brigstocks on rainy days.\r\n\r\nWhen, as criticism deepened, Fleda dropped the suggestion that some\r\npeople would perhaps see something in Mona, Mrs. Gereth caught her up\r\nwith a groan of protest, a smothered familiar cry of "Oh, my dear!" Mona\r\nwas the eldest of the three, the one Mrs. Gereth most suspected. She\r\nconfided to her young friend that it was her suspicion that had brought\r\nher to Waterbath; and this was going very far, for on the spot, as a\r\nrefuge, a remedy, she had clutched at the idea that something might be\r\ndone with the girl before her. It was her fancied exposure at any rate\r\nthat had sharpened the shock; made her ask herself with a terrible chill\r\nif fate could really be plotting to saddle her with a daughter-in-law\r\nbrought up in such a place. She had seen Mona in her appropriate setting\r\nand she had seen Owen, handsome and heavy, dangle beside her; but the\r\neffect of these first hours had happily not been to darken the prospect.\r\nIt was clearer to her that she could never accept Mona, but it was after\r\nall by no means certain that Owen would ask her to. He had sat by\r\nsomebody else at dinner, and afterwards he had talked to Mrs. Firmin,\r\nwho was as dreadful as all the rest, but redeemingly married. His\r\nheaviness, which in her need of expansion she freely named, had two\r\naspects: one of them his monstrous lack of taste, the other his\r\nexaggerated prudence. If it should come to a question of carrying Mona\r\nwith a high hand there would be no need to worry, for that was rarely\r\nhis manner of proceeding.\r\n\r\nInvited by her companion, who had asked if it weren\'t wonderful, Mrs.\r\nGereth had begun to say a word about Poynton; but she heard a sound of\r\nvoices that made her stop short. The next moment she rose to her feet,\r\nand Fleda could see that her alarm was by no means quenched. Behind the\r\nplace where they had been sitting the ground dropped with a certain\r\nsteepness, forming a long grassy bank, up which Owen Gereth and Mona\r\nBrigstock, dressed for church but making a familiar joke of it, were in\r\nthe act of scrambling and helping each other. When they had reached the\r\neven ground Fleda was able to read the meaning of the exclamation in\r\nwhich Mrs. Gereth had expressed her reserves on the subject of Miss\r\nBrigstock\'s personality. Miss Brigstock had been laughing and even\r\nromping, but the circumstance hadn\'t contributed the ghost of an\r\nexpression to her countenance. Tall, straight and fair, long-limbed and\r\nstrangely festooned, she stood there without a look in her eye or any\r\nperceptible intention of any sort in any other feature. She belonged to\r\nthe type in which speech is an unaided emission of sound and the secret\r\nof being is impenetrably and incorruptibly kept. Her expression would\r\nprobably have been beautiful if she had had one, but whatever she\r\ncommunicated she communicated, in a manner best known to herself,\r\nwithout signs. This was not the case with Owen Gereth, who had plenty of\r\nthem, and all very simple and immediate. Robust and artless, eminently\r\nnatural, yet perfectly correct, he looked pointlessly active and\r\npleasantly dull. Like his mother and like Fleda Vetch, but not for the\r\nsame reason, this young pair had come out to take a turn before church.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the two couples was sensibly awkward, and Fleda, who was\r\nsagacious, took the measure of the shock inflicted on Mrs. Gereth. There\r\nhad been intimacy--oh yes, intimacy as well as puerility--in the\r\nhorse-play of which they had just had a glimpse. The party began to\r\nstroll together to the house, and Fleda had again a sense of Mrs.\r\nGereth\'s quick management in the way the lovers, or whatever they were,\r\nfound themselves separated. She strolled behind with Mona, the mother\r\npossessing herself of her son, her exchange of remarks with whom,\r\nhowever, remained, as they went, suggestively inaudible. That member of\r\nthe party in whose intenser consciousness we shall most profitably seek\r\na reflection of the little drama with which we are concerned received an\r\neven livelier impression of Mrs. Gereth\'s intervention from the fact\r\nthat ten minutes later, on the way to church, still another pairing had\r\nbeen effected. Owen walked with Fleda, and it was an amusement to the\r\ngirl to feel sure that this was by his mother\'s direction. Fleda had\r\nother amusements as well: such as noting that Mrs. Gereth was now with\r\nMona Brigstock; such as observing that she was all affability to that\r\nyoung woman; such as reflecting that, masterful and clever, with a great\r\nbright spirit, she was one of those who impose themselves as an\r\ninfluence; such as feeling finally that Owen Gereth was absolutely\r\nbeautiful and delightfully dense. This young person had even from\r\nherself wonderful secrets of delicacy and pride; but she came as near\r\ndistinctness as in the consideration of such matters she had ever come\r\nat all in now surrendering herself to the idea that it was of a pleasant\r\neffect and rather remarkable to be stupid without offense--of a\r\npleasanter effect and more remarkable indeed than to be clever and\r\nhorrid. Owen Gereth at any rate, with his inches, his features, and his\r\nlapses, was neither of these latter things. She herself was prepared, if\r\nshe should ever marry, to contribute all the cleverness, and she liked\r\nto think that her husband would be a force grateful for direction. She\r\nwas in her small way a spirit of the same family as Mrs. Gereth. On that\r\nflushed and huddled Sunday a great matter occurred; her little life\r\nbecame aware of a singular quickening. Her meagre past fell away from\r\nher like a garment of the wrong fashion, and as she came up to town on\r\nthe Monday what she stared at in the suburban fields from the train was\r\na future full of the things she particularly loved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were neither more nor less than the things with which she had had\r\ntime to learn from Mrs. Gereth that Poynton overflowed. Poynton, in the\r\nsouth of England, was this lady\'s established, or rather her\r\ndisestablished home, having recently passed into the possession of her\r\nson. The father of the boy, an only child, had died two years before,\r\nand in London, with his mother, Owen was occupying for May and June a\r\nhouse good-naturedly lent them by Colonel Gereth, their uncle and\r\nbrother-in-law. His mother had laid her hand so engagingly on Fleda\r\nVetch that in a very few days the girl knew it was possible they should\r\nsuffer together in Cadogan Place almost as much as they had suffered\r\ntogether at Waterbath. The kind colonel\'s house was also an ordeal, but\r\nthe two women, for the ensuing month, had at least the relief of their\r\nconfessions. The great drawback of Mrs. Gereth\'s situation was that,\r\nthanks to the rare perfection of Poynton, she was condemned to wince\r\nwherever she turned. She had lived for a quarter of a century in such\r\nwarm closeness with the beautiful that, as she frankly admitted, life\r\nhad become for her a kind of fool\'s paradise. She couldn\'t leave her own\r\nhouse without peril of exposure. She didn\'t say it in so many words, but\r\nFleda could see she held that there was nothing in England really to\r\ncompare to Poynton. There were places much grander and richer, but there\r\nwas no such complete work of art, nothing that would appeal so to those\r\nwho were really informed. In putting such elements into her hand fortune\r\nhad given her an inestimable chance; she knew how rarely well things had\r\ngone with her and that she had tasted a happiness altogether rare.\r\n\r\nThere had been in the first place the exquisite old house itself, early\r\nJacobean, supreme in every part: it was a provocation, an inspiration, a\r\nmatchless canvas for the picture. Then there had been her husband\'s\r\nsympathy and generosity, his knowledge and love, their perfect accord\r\nand beautiful life together, twenty-six years of planning and seeking, a\r\nlong, sunny harvest of taste and curiosity. Lastly, she never denied,\r\nthere had been her personal gift, the genius, the passion, the patience\r\nof the collector--a patience, an almost infernal cunning, that had\r\nenabled her to do it all with a limited command of money. There wouldn\'t\r\nhave been money enough for any one else, she said with pride, but there\r\nhad been money enough for her. They had saved on lots of things in life,\r\nand there were lots of things they hadn\'t had, but they had had in every\r\ncorner of Europe their swing among the Jews. It was fascinating to poor\r\nFleda, who hadn\'t a penny in the world nor anything nice at home, and\r\nwhose only treasure was her subtle mind, to hear this genuine English\r\nlady, fresh and fair, young in the fifties, declare with gayety and\r\nconviction that she was herself the greatest Jew who had ever tracked a\r\nvictim. Fleda, with her mother dead, hadn\'t so much even as a home, and\r\nher nearest chance of one was that there was some appearance her sister\r\nwould become engaged to a curate whose eldest brother was supposed to\r\nhave property and would perhaps allow him something. Her father paid\r\nsome of her bills, but he didn\'t like her to live with him; and she had\r\nlately, in Paris, with several hundred other young women, spent a year\r\nin a studio, arming herself for the battle of life by a course with an\r\nimpressionist painter. She was determined to work, but her impressions,\r\nor somebody\'s else, were as yet her only material. Mrs. Gereth had told\r\nher she liked her because she had an extraordinary _flair_; but under\r\nthe circumstances a _flair_ was a questionable boon: in the dry places\r\nin which she had mainly moved she could have borne a chronic catarrh.\r\nShe was constantly summoned to Cadogan Place, and before the month was\r\nout was kept to stay, to pay a visit of which the end, it was agreed,\r\nshould have nothing to do with the beginning. She had a sense, partly\r\nexultant and partly alarmed, of having quickly become necessary to her\r\nimperious friend, who indeed gave a reason quite sufficient for it in\r\ntelling her there was nobody else who understood. From Mrs. Gereth there\r\nwas in these days an immense deal to understand, though it might be\r\nfreely summed up in the circumstance that she was wretched. She told\r\nFleda that she couldn\'t completely know why till she should have seen\r\nthe things at Poynton. Fleda could perfectly grasp this connection,\r\nwhich was exactly one of the matters that, in their inner mystery, were\r\na blank to everybody else.\r\n\r\nThe girl had a promise that the wonderful house should be shown her\r\nearly in July, when Mrs. Gereth would return to it as to her home; but\r\neven before this initiation she put her finger on the spot that in the\r\npoor lady\'s troubled soul ached hardest. This was the misery that\r\nhaunted her, the dread of the inevitable surrender. What Fleda had to\r\nsit up to was the confirmed appearance that Owen Gereth would marry Mona\r\nBrigstock, marry her in his mother\'s teeth, and that such an act would\r\nhave incalculable bearings. They were present to Mrs. Gereth, her\r\ncompanion could see, with a vividness that at moments almost ceased to\r\nbe that of sanity. She would have to give up Poynton, and give it up to\r\na product of Waterbath--that was the wrong that rankled, the humiliation\r\nat which Fleda would be able adequately to shudder only when she should\r\nknow the place. She did know Waterbath, and she despised it--she had\r\nthat qualification for sympathy. Her sympathy was intelligent, for she\r\nread deep into the matter; she stared, aghast, as it came home to her\r\nfor the first time, at the cruel English custom of the expropriation of\r\nthe lonely mother. Mr. Gereth had apparently been a very amiable man,\r\nbut Mr. Gereth had left things in a way that made the girl marvel. The\r\nhouse and its contents had been treated as a single splendid object;\r\neverything was to go straight to his son, and his widow was to have a\r\nmaintenance and a cottage in another county. No account whatever had\r\nbeen taken of her relation to her treasures, of the passion with which\r\nshe had waited for them, worked for them, picked them over, made them\r\nworthy of each other and the house, watched them, loved them, lived with\r\nthem. He appeared to have assumed that she would settle questions with\r\nher son, that he could depend upon Owen\'s affection. And in truth, as\r\npoor Mrs. Gereth inquired, how could he possibly have had a\r\nprevision--he who turned his eyes instinctively from everything\r\nrepulsive--of anything so abnormal as a Waterbath Brigstock? He had been\r\nin ugly houses enough, but had escaped that particular nightmare.\r\nNothing so perverse could have been expected to happen as that the heir\r\nto the loveliest thing in England should be inspired to hand it over to\r\na girl so exceptionally tainted. Mrs. Gereth spoke of poor Mona\'s taint\r\nas if to mention it were almost a violation of decency, and a person who\r\nhad listened without enlightenment would have wondered of what fault the\r\ngirl had been or had indeed not been guilty. But Owen had from a boy\r\nnever cared, had never had the least pride or pleasure in his home.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, if he doesn\'t care!"--Fleda exclaimed, with some\r\nimpetuosity; stopping short, however, before she completed her sentence.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth looked at her rather hard. "If he doesn\'t care?"\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated; she had not quite had a definite idea. "Well--he\'ll\r\ngive them up."\r\n\r\n"Give what up?"\r\n\r\n"Why, those beautiful things."\r\n\r\n"Give them up to whom?" Mrs. Gereth more boldly stared.\r\n\r\n"To you, of course--to enjoy, to keep for yourself."\r\n\r\n"And leave his house as bare as your hand? There\'s nothing in it that\r\nisn\'t precious."\r\n\r\nFleda considered; her friend had taken her up with a smothered ferocity\r\nby which she was slightly disconcerted. "I don\'t mean of course that he\r\nshould surrender everything; but he might let you pick out the things to\r\nwhich you\'re most attached."\r\n\r\n"I think he would if he were free," said Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\n"And do you mean, as it is, that _she_\'ll prevent him?" Mona Brigstock,\r\nbetween these ladies, was now nothing but "she."\r\n\r\n"By every means in her power."\r\n\r\n"But surely not because she understands and appreciates them?"\r\n\r\n"No," Mrs. Gereth replied, "but because they belong to the house and the\r\nhouse belongs to Owen. If I should wish to take anything, she would\r\nsimply say, with that motionless mask: \'It goes with the house.\' And day\r\nafter day, in the face of every argument, of every consideration of\r\ngenerosity, she would repeat, without winking, in that voice like the\r\nsqueeze of a doll\'s stomach: \'It goes with the house--it goes with the\r\nhouse.\' In that attitude they\'ll shut themselves up."\r\n\r\nFleda was struck, was even a little startled with the way Mrs. Gereth\r\nhad turned this over--had faced, if indeed only to recognize its\r\nfutility, the notion of a battle with her only son. These words led her\r\nto make an inquiry which she had not thought it discreet to make before;\r\nshe brought out the idea of the possibility, after all, of her friend\'s\r\ncontinuing to live at Poynton. Would they really wish to proceed to\r\nextremities? Was no good-humored, graceful compromise to be imagined or\r\nbrought about? Couldn\'t the same roof cover them? Was it so very\r\ninconceivable that a married son should, for the rest of her days, share\r\nwith so charming a mother the home she had devoted more than a score of\r\nyears to making beautiful for him? Mrs. Gereth hailed this question with\r\na wan, compassionate smile; she replied that a common household, in such\r\na case, was exactly so inconceivable that Fleda had only to glance over\r\nthe fair face of the English land to see how few people had ever\r\nconceived it. It was always thought a wonder, a "mistake," a piece of\r\noverstrained sentiment; and she confessed that she was as little capable\r\nof a flight of that sort as Owen himself. Even if they both had been\r\ncapable, they would still have Mona\'s hatred to reckon with. Fleda\'s\r\nbreath was sometimes taken away by the great bounds and elisions which,\r\non Mrs. Gereth\'s lips, the course of discussion could take. This was the\r\nfirst she had heard of Mona\'s hatred, though she certainly had not\r\nneeded Mrs. Gereth to tell her that in close quarters that young lady\r\nwould prove secretly mulish. Later Fleda perceived indeed that perhaps\r\nalmost any girl would hate a person who should be so markedly averse to\r\nhaving anything to do with her. Before this, however, in conversation\r\nwith her young friend, Mrs. Gereth furnished a more vivid motive for her\r\ndespair by asking how she could possibly be expected to sit there with\r\nthe new proprietors and accept--or call it, for a day, endure--the\r\nhorrors they would perpetrate in the house. Fleda reasoned that they\r\nwouldn\'t after all smash things nor burn them up; and Mrs. Gereth\r\nadmitted when pushed that she didn\'t quite suppose they would. What she\r\nmeant was that they would neglect them, ignore them, leave them to\r\nclumsy servants (there wasn\'t an object of them all but should be\r\nhandled with perfect love), and in many cases probably wish to replace\r\nthem by pieces answerable to some vulgar modern notion of the\r\nconvenient. Above all, she saw in advance, with dilated eyes, the\r\nabominations they would inevitably mix up with them--the maddening\r\nrelics of Waterbath, the little brackets and pink vases, the sweepings\r\nof bazaars, the family photographs and illuminated texts, the "household\r\nart" and household piety of Mona\'s hideous home. Wasn\'t it enough simply\r\nto contend that Mona would approach Poynton in the spirit of a\r\nBrigstock, and that in the spirit of a Brigstock she would deal with her\r\nacquisition? Did Fleda really see _her_, Mrs. Gereth demanded, spending\r\nthe remainder of her days with such a creature\'s elbow in her eye?\r\n\r\nFleda had to declare that she certainly didn\'t, and that Waterbath had\r\nbeen a warning it would be frivolous to overlook. At the same time she\r\nprivately reflected that they were taking a great deal for granted, and\r\nthat, inasmuch as to her knowledge Owen Gereth had positively denied his\r\nbetrothal, the ground of their speculations was by no means firm. It\r\nseemed to our young lady that in a difficult position Owen conducted\r\nhimself with some natural art; treating this domesticated confidant of\r\nhis mother\'s wrongs with a simple civility that almost troubled her\r\nconscience, so deeply she felt that she might have had for him the air\r\nof siding with that lady against him. She wondered if he would ever know\r\nhow little really she did this, and that she was there, since Mrs.\r\nGereth had insisted, not to betray, but essentially to confirm and\r\nprotect. The fact that his mother disliked Mona Brigstock might have\r\nmade him dislike the object of her preference, and it was detestable to\r\nFleda to remember that she might have appeared to him to offer herself\r\nas an exemplary contrast. It was clear enough, however, that the happy\r\nyouth had no more sense for a motive than a deaf man for a tune, a\r\nlimitation by which, after all, she could gain as well as lose. He came\r\nand went very freely on the business with which London abundantly\r\nfurnished him, but he found time more than once to say to her, "It\'s\r\nawfully nice of you to look after poor Mummy." As well as his quick\r\nspeech, which shyness made obscure--it was usually as desperate as a\r\n"rush" at some violent game--his child\'s eyes in his man\'s face put it\r\nto her that, you know, this really meant a good deal for him and that he\r\nhoped she would stay on. With a person in the house who, like herself,\r\nwas clever, poor Mummy was conveniently occupied; and Fleda found a\r\nbeauty in the candor and even in the modesty which apparently kept him\r\nfrom suspecting that two such wiseheads could possibly be occupied with\r\nOwen Gereth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThey went at last, the wiseheads, down to Poynton, where the palpitating\r\ngirl had the full revelation. "_Now_ do you know how I feel?" Mrs.\r\nGereth asked when in the wonderful hall, three minutes after their\r\narrival, her pretty associate dropped on a seat with a soft gasp and a\r\nroll of dilated eyes. The answer came clearly enough, and in the rapture\r\nof that first walk through the house Fleda took a prodigious span. She\r\nperfectly understood how Mrs. Gereth felt--she had understood but\r\nmeagrely before; and the two women embraced with tears over the\r\ntightening of their bond--tears which on the younger one\'s part were the\r\nnatural and usual sign of her submission to perfect beauty. It was not\r\nthe first time she had cried for the joy of admiration, but it was the\r\nfirst time the mistress of Poynton, often as she had shown her house,\r\nhad been present at such an exhibition. She exulted in it; it quickened\r\nher own tears; she assured her companion that such an occasion made the\r\npoor old place fresh to her again and more precious than ever. Yes,\r\nnobody had ever, that way, felt what she had achieved: people were so\r\ngrossly ignorant, and everybody, even the knowing ones, as they thought\r\nthemselves, more or less dense. What Mrs. Gereth had achieved was indeed\r\nan exquisite work; and in such an art of the treasure-hunter, in\r\nselection and comparison refined to that point, there was an element of\r\ncreation, of personality. She had commended Fleda\'s _flair_, and Fleda\r\nnow gave herself up to satiety. Preoccupations and scruples fell away\r\nfrom her; she had never known a greater happiness than the week she\r\npassed in this initiation.\r\n\r\nWandering through clear chambers where the general effect made\r\npreferences almost as impossible as if they had been shocks, pausing at\r\nopen doors where vistas were long and bland, she would, even if she had\r\nnot already known, have discovered for herself that Poynton was the\r\nrecord of a life. It was written in great syllables of color and form,\r\nthe tongues of other countries and the hands of rare artists. It was all\r\nFrance and Italy, with their ages composed to rest. For England you\r\nlooked out of old windows--it was England that was the wide embrace.\r\nWhile outside, on the low terraces, she contradicted gardeners and\r\nrefined on nature, Mrs. Gereth left her guest to finger fondly the\r\nbrasses that Louis Quinze might have thumbed, to sit with Venetian\r\nvelvets just held in a loving palm, to hang over cases of enamels and\r\npass and repass before cabinets. There were not many pictures--the\r\npanels and the stuffs were themselves the picture; and in all the great\r\nwainscoted house there was not an inch of pasted paper. What struck\r\nFleda most in it was the high pride of her friend\'s taste, a fine\r\narrogance, a sense of style which, however amused and amusing, never\r\ncompromised nor stooped. She felt indeed, as this lady had intimated to\r\nher that she would, both a respect and a compassion that she had not\r\nknown before; the vision of the coming surrender filled her with an\r\nequal pain. To give it all up, to die to it--that thought ached in her\r\nbreast. She herself could imagine clinging there with a closeness\r\nseparate from dignity. To have created such a place was to have had\r\ndignity enough; when there was a question of defending it the fiercest\r\nattitude was the right one. After so intense a taking of possession she\r\ntoo was to give it up; for she reflected that if Mrs. Gereth\'s remaining\r\nthere would have offered her a sort of future--stretching away in safe\r\nyears on the other side of a gulf--the advent of the others could only\r\nbe, by the same law, a great vague menace, the ruffling of a still\r\nwater. Such were the emotions of a hungry girl whose sensibility was\r\nalmost as great as her opportunities for comparison had been small. The\r\nmuseums had done something for her, but nature had done more.\r\n\r\nIf Owen had not come down with them nor joined them later, it was\r\nbecause he still found London jolly; yet the question remained of\r\nwhether the jollity of London was not merely the only name his small\r\nvocabulary yielded for the jollity of Mona Brigstock. There was indeed\r\nin his conduct another ambiguity--something that required explaining so\r\nlong as his motive didn\'t come to the surface. If he was in love, what\r\nwas the matter? And what was the matter still more if he wasn\'t? The\r\nmystery was at last cleared up: this Fleda gathered from the tone in\r\nwhich, one morning at breakfast, a letter just opened made Mrs. Gereth\r\ncry out. Her dismay was almost a shriek: "Why, he\'s bringing her\r\ndown--he wants her to see the house!" They flew, the two women, into\r\neach other\'s arms and, with their heads together, soon made out that the\r\nreason, the baffling reason why nothing had yet happened, was that Mona\r\ndidn\'t know, or Owen didn\'t, whether Poynton would really please her.\r\nShe was coming down to judge; and could anything in the world be more\r\nlike poor Owen than the ponderous probity which had kept him from\r\npressing her for a reply till she should have learned whether she\r\napproved what he had to offer her? That was a scruple it had naturally\r\nbeen impossible to impute. If only they might fondly hope, Mrs. Gereth\r\nwailed, that the girl\'s expectations would be dashed! There was a fine\r\nconsistency, a sincerity quite affecting, in her arguing that the better\r\nthe place should happen to look and to express the conceptions to which\r\nit owed its origin, the less it would speak to an intelligence so\r\nprimitive. How could a Brigstock possibly understand what it was all\r\nabout? How, really, could a Brigstock logically do anything but hate it?\r\nMrs. Gereth, even as she whisked away linen shrouds, persuaded herself\r\nof the possibility on Mona\'s part of some bewildered blankness, some\r\ncollapse of admiration that would prove disconcerting to her swain--a\r\nhope of which Fleda at least could see the absurdity and which gave the\r\nmeasure of the poor lady\'s strange, almost maniacal disposition to\r\nthrust in everywhere the question of "things," to read all behavior in\r\nthe light of some fancied relation to them. "Things" were of course the\r\nsum of the world; only, for Mrs. Gereth, the sum of the world was rare\r\nFrench furniture and Oriental china. She could at a stretch imagine\r\npeople\'s not having, but she couldn\'t imagine their not wanting and not\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nThe young couple were to be accompanied by Mrs. Brigstock, and with a\r\nprevision of how fiercely they would be watched Fleda became conscious,\r\nbefore the party arrived, of an amused, diplomatic pity for them. Almost\r\nas much as Mrs. Gereth\'s her taste was her life, but her life was\r\nsomehow the larger for it. Besides, she had another care now: there was\r\nsome one she wouldn\'t have liked to see humiliated even in the form of a\r\nyoung lady who would contribute to his never suspecting so much\r\ndelicacy. When this young lady appeared Fleda tried, so far as the wish\r\nto efface herself allowed, to be mainly the person to take her about,\r\nshow her the house, and cover up her ignorance. Owen\'s announcement had\r\nbeen that, as trains made it convenient, they would present themselves\r\nfor luncheon and depart before dinner; but Mrs. Gereth, true to her\r\nsystem of glaring civility, proposed and obtained an extension, a dining\r\nand spending of the night. She made her young friend wonder against what\r\nrebellion of fact she was sacrificing in advance so profusely to form.\r\nFleda was appalled, after the first hour, by the rash innocence with\r\nwhich Mona had accepted the responsibility of observation, and indeed by\r\nthe large levity with which, sitting there like a bored tourist in fine\r\nscenery, she exercised it. She felt in her nerves the effect of such a\r\nmanner on her companion\'s, and it was this that made her want to entice\r\nthe girl away, give her some merciful warning or some jocular cue. Mona\r\nmet intense looks, however, with eyes that might have been blue beads,\r\nthe only ones she had--eyes into which Fleda thought it strange Owen\r\nGereth should have to plunge for his fate and his mother for a\r\nconfession of whether Poynton was a success. She made no remark that\r\nhelped to supply this light; her impression at any rate had nothing in\r\ncommon with the feeling that, as the beauty of the place throbbed out\r\nlike music, had caused Fleda Vetch to burst into tears. She was as\r\ncontent to say nothing as if, Mrs. Gereth afterwards exclaimed, she had\r\nbeen keeping her mouth shut in a railway-tunnel. Mrs. Gereth contrived\r\nat the end of an hour to convey to Fleda that it was plain she was\r\nbrutally ignorant; but Fleda more subtly discovered that her ignorance\r\nwas obscurely active.\r\n\r\nShe was not so stupid as not to see that something, though she scarcely\r\nknew what, was expected of her that she couldn\'t give; and the only mode\r\nher intelligence suggested of meeting the expectation was to plant her\r\nbig feet and pull another way. Mrs. Gereth wanted her to rise, somehow\r\nor somewhere, and was prepared to hate her if she didn\'t: very well, she\r\ncouldn\'t, she wouldn\'t rise; she already moved at the altitude that\r\nsuited her, and was able to see that, since she was exposed to the\r\nhatred, she might at least enjoy the calm. The smallest trouble, for a\r\ngirl with no nonsense about her, was to earn what she incurred; so that,\r\na dim instinct teaching her she would earn it best by not being\r\neffusive, and combining with the conviction that she now held Owen, and\r\ntherefore the place, she had the pleasure of her honesty as well as of\r\nher security. Didn\'t her very honesty lead her to be belligerently blank\r\nabout Poynton, inasmuch as it was just Poynton that was forced upon her\r\nas a subject for effusiveness? Such subjects, to Mona Brigstock, had an\r\nair almost of indecency, and the house became uncanny to her through\r\nsuch an appeal--an appeal that, somewhere in the twilight of her being,\r\nas Fleda was sure, she thanked heaven she _was_ the girl stiffly to draw\r\nback from. She was a person whom pressure at a given point infallibly\r\ncaused to expand in the wrong place instead of, as it is usually\r\nadministered in the hope of doing, the right one. Her mother, to make up\r\nfor this, broke out universally, pronounced everything "most striking,"\r\nand was visibly happy that Owen\'s captor should be so far on the way to\r\nstrike: but she jarred upon Mrs. Gereth by her formula of admiration,\r\nwhich was that anything she looked at was "in the style" of something\r\nelse. This was to show how much she had seen, but it only showed she had\r\nseen nothing; everything at Poynton was in the style of Poynton, and\r\npoor Mrs. Brigstock, who at least was determined to rise, and had\r\nbrought with her a trophy of her journey, a "lady\'s magazine" purchased\r\nat the station, a horrible thing with patterns for antimacassars, which,\r\nas it was quite new, the first number, and seemed so clever, she kindly\r\noffered to leave for the house, was in the style of a vulgar old woman\r\nwho wore silver jewelry and tried to pass off a gross avidity as a sense\r\nof the beautiful.\r\n\r\nBy the day\'s end it was clear to Fleda Vetch that, however Mona judged,\r\nthe day had been determinant; whether or no she felt the charm, she felt\r\nthe challenge: at an early moment Owen Gereth would be able to tell his\r\nmother the worst. Nevertheless, when the elder lady, at bedtime, coming\r\nin a dressing-gown and a high fever to the younger one\'s room, cried\r\nout, "She hates it; but what will she do?" Fleda pretended vagueness,\r\nplayed at obscurity and assented disingenuously to the proposition that\r\nthey at least had a respite. The future was dark to her, but there was a\r\nsilken thread she could clutch in the gloom--she would never give Owen\r\naway. He might give himself--he even certainly would; but that was his\r\nown affair, and his blunders, his innocence, only added to the appeal he\r\nmade to her. She would cover him, she would protect him, and beyond\r\nthinking her a cheerful inmate he would never guess her intention, any\r\nmore than, beyond thinking her clever enough for anything, his acute\r\nmother would discover it. From this hour, with Mrs. Gereth, there was a\r\nflaw in her frankness: her admirable friend continued to know everything\r\nshe did; what was to remain unknown was the general motive.\r\n\r\nFrom the window of her room, the next morning before breakfast, the girl\r\nsaw Owen in the garden with Mona, who strolled beside him with a\r\nlistening parasol, but without a visible look for the great florid\r\npicture that had been hung there by Mrs. Gereth\'s hand. Mona kept\r\ndropping her eyes, as she walked, to catch the sheen of her\r\npatent-leather shoes, which resembled a man\'s and which she kicked\r\nforward a little--it gave her an odd movement--to help her see what she\r\nthought of them. When Fleda came down Mrs. Gereth was in the\r\nbreakfast-room; and at that moment Owen, through a long window, passed\r\nin alone from the terrace and very endearingly kissed his mother. It\r\nimmediately struck the girl that she was in their way, for hadn\'t he\r\nbeen borne on a wave of joy exactly to announce, before the Brigstocks\r\ndeparted, that Mona had at last faltered out the sweet word he had been\r\nwaiting for? He shook hands with his friendly violence, but Fleda\r\ncontrived not to look into his face: what she liked most to see in it\r\nwas not the reflection of Mona\'s big boot-toes. She could bear well\r\nenough that young lady herself, but she couldn\'t bear Owen\'s opinion of\r\nher. She was on the point of slipping into the garden when the movement\r\nwas checked by Mrs. Gereth\'s suddenly drawing her close, as if for the\r\nmorning embrace, and then, while she kept her there with the bravery of\r\nthe night\'s repose, breaking out: "Well, my dear boy, what _does_ your\r\nyoung friend there make of our odds and ends?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she thinks they\'re all right!"\r\n\r\nFleda immediately guessed from his tone that he had not come in to say\r\nwhat she supposed; there was even something in it to confirm Mrs.\r\nGereth\'s belief that their danger had dropped. She was sure, moreover,\r\nthat his tribute to Mona\'s taste was a repetition of the eloquent words\r\nin which the girl had herself recorded it; she could indeed hear, with\r\nall vividness, the pretty passage between the pair. "Don\'t you think\r\nit\'s rather jolly, the old shop?" "Oh, it\'s all right!" Mona had\r\ngraciously remarked; and then they had probably, with a slap on a back,\r\nrun another race up or down a green bank. Fleda knew Mrs. Gereth had not\r\nyet uttered a word to her son that would have shown him how much she\r\nfeared; but it was impossible to feel her friend\'s arm round her and not\r\nbecome aware that this friend was now throbbing with a strange\r\nintention. Owen\'s reply had scarcely been of a nature to usher in a\r\ndiscussion of Mona\'s sensibilities; but Mrs. Gereth went on, in a\r\nmoment, with an innocence of which Fleda could measure the cold\r\nhypocrisy: "Has she any sort of feeling for nice old things?" The\r\nquestion was as fresh as the morning light.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course she likes everything that\'s nice." And Owen, who\r\nconstitutionally disliked questions--an answer was almost as hateful to\r\nhim as a "trick" to a big dog--smiled kindly at Fleda and conveyed that\r\nshe would understand what he meant even if his mother didn\'t. Fleda,\r\nhowever, mainly understood that Mrs. Gereth, with an odd, wild laugh,\r\nheld her so hard that she hurt her.\r\n\r\n"I could give up everything without a pang, I think, to a person I could\r\ntrust, I could respect." The girl heard her voice tremble under the\r\neffort to show nothing but what she wanted to show, and felt the\r\nsincerity of her implication that the piety most real to her was to be\r\non one\'s knees before one\'s high standard. "The best things here, as you\r\nknow, are the things your father and I collected, things all that we\r\nworked for and waited for and suffered for. Yes," cried Mrs. Gereth,\r\nwith a fine freedom of fancy, "there are things in the house that we\r\nalmost starved for! They were our religion, they were our life, they\r\nwere _us_! And now they\'re only _me_--except that they\'re also _you_,\r\nthank God, a little, you dear!" she continued, suddenly inflicting on\r\nFleda a kiss apparently intended to knock her into position. "There\r\nisn\'t one of them I don\'t know and love--yes, as one remembers and\r\ncherishes the happiest moments of one\'s life. Blindfold, in the dark,\r\nwith the brush of a finger, I could tell one from another. They\'re\r\nliving things to me; they know me, they return the touch of my hand. But\r\nI could let them all go, since I have to, so strangely, to another\r\naffection, another conscience. There\'s a care they want, there\'s a\r\nsympathy that draws out their beauty. Rather than make them over to a\r\nwoman ignorant and vulgar, I think I\'d deface them with my own hands.\r\nCan\'t you see me, Fleda, and wouldn\'t you do it yourself?"--she appealed\r\nto her companion with glittering eyes. "I couldn\'t bear the thought of\r\nsuch a woman here--I _couldn\'t_. I don\'t know what she\'d do; she\'d be\r\nsure to invent some deviltry, if it should be only to bring in her own\r\nlittle belongings and horrors. The world is full of cheap gimcracks, in\r\nthis awful age, and they\'re thrust in at one at every turn. They\'d be\r\nthrust in here, on top of my treasures, my own. Who would save _them_\r\nfor me--I ask you who _would_?" and she turned again to Fleda with a\r\ndry, strained smile. Her handsome, high-nosed, excited face might have\r\nbeen that of Don Quixote tilting at a windmill. Drawn into the eddy of\r\nthis outpouring, the girl, scared and embarrassed, laughed off her\r\nexposure; but only to feel herself more passionately caught up and, as\r\nit seemed to her, thrust down the fine open mouth (it showed such\r\nperfect teeth) with which poor Owen\'s slow cerebration gaped. "_You_\r\nwould, of course--only you, in all the world, because you know, you\r\nfeel, as I do myself, what\'s good and true and pure." No severity of the\r\nmoral law could have taken a higher tone in this implication of the\r\nyoung lady who had not the only virtue Mrs. Gereth actively esteemed.\r\n"_You_ would replace me, _you_ would watch over them, _you_ would keep\r\nthe place right," she austerely pursued, "and with you here--yes, with\r\nyou, I believe I might rest, at last, in my grave!" She threw herself on\r\nFleda\'s neck, and before Fleda, horribly shamed, could shake her off,\r\nhad burst into tears which couldn\'t have been explained, but which might\r\nperhaps have been understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nA week later Owen Gereth came down to inform his mother that he had\r\nsettled with Mona Brigstock; but it was not at all a joy to Fleda,\r\nconscious how much to himself it would be a surprise, that he should\r\nfind her still in the house. That dreadful scene before breakfast had\r\nmade her position false and odious; it had been followed, after they\r\nwere left alone, by a scene of her own making with her extravagant\r\nfriend. She notified Mrs. Gereth of her instant departure: she couldn\'t\r\npossibly remain after being offered to Owen, that way, before her very\r\nface, as his mother\'s candidate for the honor of his hand. That was all\r\nhe could have seen in such an outbreak and in the indecency of her\r\nstanding there to enjoy it. Fleda had on the prior occasion dashed out\r\nof the room by the shortest course and in her confusion had fallen upon\r\nMona in the garden. She had taken an aimless turn with her, and they had\r\nhad some talk, rendered at first difficult and almost disagreeable by\r\nMona\'s apparent suspicion that she had been sent out to spy, as Mrs.\r\nGereth had tried to spy, into her opinions. Fleda was sagacious enough\r\nto treat these opinions as a mystery almost awful; which had an effect\r\nso much more than reassuring that at the end of five minutes the young\r\nlady from Waterbath suddenly and perversely said: "Why has she never had\r\na winter garden thrown out? If ever I have a place of my own I mean to\r\nhave one." Fleda, dismayed, could see the thing--something glazed and\r\npiped, on iron pillars, with untidy plants and cane sofas; a shiny\r\nexcrescence on the noble face of Poynton. She remembered at Waterbath a\r\nconservatory where she had caught a bad cold in the company of a stuffed\r\ncockatoo fastened to a tropical bough and a waterless fountain composed\r\nof shells stuck into some hardened paste. She asked Mona if her idea\r\nwould be to make something like this conservatory; to which Mona\r\nreplied: "Oh no, much finer; we haven\'t got a winter garden at\r\nWaterbath." Fleda wondered if she meant to convey that it was the only\r\ngrandeur they lacked, and in a moment Mona went on: "But we have got a\r\nbilliard-room--that I will say for us!" There was no billiard-room at\r\nPoynton, but there would evidently be one, and it would have, hung on\r\nits walls, framed at the "Stores," caricature-portraits of celebrities,\r\ntaken from a "society-paper."\r\n\r\nWhen the two girls had gone in to breakfast it was for Fleda to see at a\r\nglance that there had been a further passage, of some high color,\r\nbetween Owen and his mother; and she had turned pale in guessing to what\r\nextremity, at her expense, Mrs. Gereth had found occasion to proceed.\r\nHadn\'t she, after her clumsy flight, been pressed upon Owen in still\r\nclearer terms? Mrs. Gereth would practically have said to him: "If\r\nyou\'ll take _her_, I\'ll move away without a sound. But if you take any\r\none else, any one I\'m not sure of, as I am of her--heaven help me, I\'ll\r\nfight to the death!" Breakfast, this morning, at Poynton, had been a\r\nmeal singularly silent, in spite of the vague little cries with which\r\nMrs. Brigstock turned up the underside of plates and the knowing but\r\nalarming raps administered by her big knuckles to porcelain cups. Some\r\none had to respond to her, and the duty assigned itself to Fleda, who,\r\nwhile pretending to meet her on the ground of explanation, wondered what\r\nOwen thought of a girl still indelicately anxious, after she had been\r\ngrossly hurled at him, to prove by exhibitions of her fine taste that\r\nshe was really what his mother pretended. This time, at any rate, their\r\nfate was sealed: Owen, as soon as he should get out of the house, would\r\ndescribe to Mona that lady\'s extraordinary conduct, and if anything more\r\nhad been wanted to "fetch" Mona, as he would call it, the deficiency was\r\nnow made up. Mrs. Gereth in fact took care of that--took care of it by\r\nthe way, at the last, on the threshold, she said to the younger of her\r\ndeparting guests, with an irony of which the sting was wholly in the\r\nsense, not at all in the sound: "We haven\'t had the talk we might have\r\nhad, have we? You\'ll feel that I\'ve neglected you, and you\'ll treasure\r\nit up against me. _Don\'t_, because really, you know, it has been quite\r\nan accident, and I\'ve all sorts of information at your disposal. If you\r\nshould come down again (only you won\'t, ever,--I feel that!) I should\r\ngive you plenty of time to worry it out of me. Indeed there are some\r\nthings I should quite insist on your learning; not permit you at all, in\r\nany settled way, _not_ to learn. Yes indeed, you\'d put me through, and I\r\nshould put you, my dear! We should have each other to reckon with, and\r\nyou would see me as I really am. I\'m not a bit the vague, mooning, easy\r\ncreature I dare say you think. However, if you won\'t come, you won\'t;\r\n_n\'en parlons plus_. It _is_ stupid here after what you\'re accustomed\r\nto. We can only, all round, do what we can, eh? For heaven\'s sake, don\'t\r\nlet your mother forget her precious publication, the female magazine,\r\nwith the what-do-you-call-\'em?--the grease-catchers. There!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth, delivering herself from the doorstep, had tossed the\r\nperiodical higher in air than was absolutely needful--tossed it toward\r\nthe carriage the retreating party was about to enter. Mona, from the\r\nforce of habit, the reflex action of the custom of sport, had popped\r\nout, with a little spring, a long arm and intercepted the missile as\r\neasily as she would have caused a tennis-ball to rebound from a racket.\r\n"Good catch!" Owen had cried, so genuinely pleased that practically no\r\nnotice was taken of his mother\'s impressive remarks. It was to the\r\naccompaniment of romping laughter, as Mrs. Gereth afterwards said, that\r\nthe carriage had rolled away; but it was while that laughter was still\r\nin the air that Fleda Vetch, white and terrible, had turned upon her\r\nhostess with her scorching "How _could_ you? Great God, how _could_\r\nyou?" This lady\'s perfect blankness was from the first a sign of her\r\nserene conscience, and the fact that till indoctrinated she didn\'t even\r\nknow what Fleda meant by resenting her late offense to every\r\nsusceptibility gave our young woman a sore, scared perception that her\r\nown value in the house was just the value, as one might say, of a good\r\nagent. Mrs. Gereth was generously sorry, but she was still more\r\nsurprised--surprised at Fleda\'s not having liked to be shown off to Owen\r\nas the right sort of wife for him. Why not, in the name of wonder, if\r\nshe absolutely _was_ the right sort? She had admitted on explanation\r\nthat she could see what her young friend meant by having been laid, as\r\nFleda called it, at his feet; but it struck the girl that the admission\r\nwas only made to please her, and that Mrs. Gereth was secretly surprised\r\nat her not being as happy to be sacrificed to the supremacy of a high\r\nstandard as she was happy to sacrifice her. She had taken a tremendous\r\nfancy to her, but that was on account of the fancy--to Poynton of\r\ncourse--Fleda herself had taken. Wasn\'t this latter fancy then so great\r\nafter all? Fleda felt that she could declare it to be great indeed when\r\nreally for the sake of it she could forgive what she had suffered and,\r\nafter reproaches and tears, asseverations and kisses, after learning\r\nthat she was cared for only as a priestess of the altar and a view of\r\nher bruised dignity which left no alternative to flight, could accept\r\nthe shame with the balm, consent not to depart, take refuge in the thin\r\ncomfort of at least knowing the truth. The truth was simply that all\r\nMrs. Gereth\'s scruples were on one side and that her ruling passion had\r\nin a manner despoiled her of her humanity. On the second day, after the\r\ntide of emotion had somewhat ebbed, she said soothingly to her\r\ncompanion: "But you _would_, after all, marry him, you know, darling,\r\nwouldn\'t you, if that girl were not there? I mean of course if he were\r\nto ask you," Mrs. Gereth had thoughtfully added.\r\n\r\n"Marry him if he were to ask me? Most distinctly not!"\r\n\r\nThe question had not come up with this definiteness before, and Mrs.\r\nGereth was clearly more surprised than ever. She marveled a moment. "Not\r\neven to have Poynton?"\r\n\r\n"Not even to have Poynton."\r\n\r\n"But why on earth?" Mrs. Gereth\'s sad eyes were fixed on her.\r\n\r\nFleda colored; she hesitated. "Because he\'s too stupid!" Save on one\r\nother occasion, at which we shall in time arrive, little as the reader\r\nmay believe it, she never came nearer to betraying to Mrs. Gereth that\r\nshe was in love with Owen. She found a dim amusement in reflecting that\r\nif Mona had not been there and he had not been too stupid and he verily\r\nhad asked her, she might, should she have wished to keep her secret,\r\nhave found it possible to pass off the motive of her action as a mere\r\npassion for Poynton.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth evidently thought in these days of little but things\r\nhymeneal; for she broke out with sudden rapture, in the middle of the\r\nweek: "I know what they\'ll do: they _will_ marry, but they\'ll go and\r\nlive at Waterbath!" There was positive joy in that form of the idea,\r\nwhich she embroidered and developed: it seemed so much the safest thing\r\nthat could happen. "Yes, I\'ll have you, but I won\'t go _there_!" Mona\r\nwould have said with a vicious nod at the southern horizon: "we\'ll leave\r\nyour horrid mother alone there for life." It would be an ideal solution,\r\nthis ingress the lively pair, with their spiritual need of a warmer\r\nmedium, would playfully punch in the ribs of her ancestral home; for it\r\nwould not only prevent recurring panic at Poynton--it would offer them,\r\nas in one of their gimcrack baskets or other vessels of ugliness, a\r\ndefinite daily felicity that Poynton could never give. Owen might manage\r\nhis estate just as he managed it now, and Mrs. Gereth would manage\r\neverything else. When, in the hall, on the unforgettable day of his\r\nreturn, she had heard his voice ring out like a call to a terrier, she\r\nhad still, as Fleda afterwards learned, clutched frantically at the\r\nconceit that he had come, at the worst, to announce some compromise; to\r\ntell her she would have to put up with the girl, yes, but that some way\r\nwould be arrived at of leaving her in personal possession. Fleda Vetch,\r\nwhom from the first hour no illusion had brushed with its wing, now held\r\nher breath, went on tiptoe, wandered in outlying parts of the house and\r\nthrough delicate, muffled rooms, while the mother and son faced each\r\nother below. From time to time she stopped to listen; but all was so\r\nquiet she was almost frightened: she had vaguely expected a sound of\r\ncontention. It lasted longer than she would have supposed, whatever it\r\nwas they were doing; and when finally, from a window, she saw Owen\r\nstroll out of the house, stop and light a cigarette and then pensively\r\nlose himself in the plantations, she found other matter for trepidation\r\nin the fact that Mrs. Gereth didn\'t immediately come rushing up into her\r\narms. She wondered whether she oughtn\'t to go down to her, and measured\r\nthe gravity of what had occurred by the circumstance, which she\r\npresently ascertained, that the poor lady had retired to her room and\r\nwished not to be disturbed. This admonition had been for her maid, with\r\nwhom Fleda conferred as at the door of a death-chamber; but the girl,\r\nwithout either fatuity or resentment, judged that, since it could render\r\nMrs. Gereth indifferent even to the ministrations of disinterested\r\nattachment, the scene had been tremendous.\r\n\r\nShe was absent from luncheon, where indeed Fleda had enough to do to\r\nlook Owen in the face; there would be so much to make that hateful in\r\ntheir common memory of the passage in which his last visit had\r\nterminated. This had been her apprehension at least; but as soon as he\r\nstood there she was constrained to wonder at the practical simplicity of\r\nthe ordeal--a simplicity which was really just his own simplicity, the\r\nparticular thing that, for Fleda Vetch, some other things of course\r\naiding, made almost any direct relation with him pleasant. He had\r\nneither wit, nor tact, nor inspiration: all she could say was that when\r\nthey were together the alienation these charms were usually depended on\r\nto allay didn\'t occur. On this occasion, for instance, he did so much\r\nbetter than "carry off" an awkward remembrance: he simply didn\'t have\r\nit. He had clean forgotten that she was the girl his mother would have\r\nfobbed off on him; he was conscious only that she was there in a manner\r\nfor service--conscious of the dumb instinct that from the first had made\r\nhim regard her not as complicating his intercourse with that personage,\r\nbut as simplifying it. Fleda found beautiful that this theory should\r\nhave survived the incident of the other day; found exquisite that\r\nwhereas she was conscious, through faint reverberations, that for her\r\nkind little circle at large, whom it didn\'t concern, her tendency had\r\nbegun to define itself as parasitical, this strong young man, who had a\r\nright to judge and even a reason to loathe her, didn\'t judge and didn\'t\r\nloathe, let her down gently, treated her as if she pleased him, and in\r\nfact evidently liked her to be just where she was. She asked herself\r\nwhat he did when Mona denounced her, and the only answer to the question\r\nwas that perhaps Mona didn\'t denounce her. If Mona was inarticulate he\r\nwasn\'t such a fool, then, to marry her. That he was glad Fleda was there\r\nwas at any rate sufficiently shown by the domestic familiarity with\r\nwhich he said to her: "I must tell you I\'ve been having an awful row\r\nwith my mother. I\'m engaged to be married to Miss Brigstock."\r\n\r\n"Ah, really?" cried Fleda, achieving a radiance of which she was\r\nsecretly proud. "How very exciting!"\r\n\r\n"Too exciting for poor Mummy. She won\'t hear of it. She has been slating\r\nher fearfully. She says she\'s a \'barbarian.\'"\r\n\r\n"Why, she\'s lovely!" Fleda exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s all right. Mother must come round."\r\n\r\n"Only give her time," said Fleda. She had advanced to the threshold of\r\nthe door thus thrown open to her and, without exactly crossing it, she\r\nthrew in an appreciative glance. She asked Owen when his marriage would\r\ntake place, and in the light of his reply read that Mrs. Gereth\'s\r\nwretched attitude would have no influence at all on the event,\r\nabsolutely fixed when he came down, and distant by only three months. He\r\nliked Fleda\'s seeming to be on his side, though that was a secondary\r\nmatter, for what really most concerned him now was the line his mother\r\ntook about Poynton, her declared unwillingness to give it up.\r\n\r\n"Naturally I want my own house, you know," he said, "and my father made\r\nevery arrangement for me to have it. But she may make it devilish\r\nawkward. What in the world\'s a fellow to do?" This it was that Owen\r\nwanted to know, and there could be no better proof of his friendliness\r\nthan his air of depending on Fleda Vetch to tell him. She questioned\r\nhim, they spent an hour together, and, as he gave her the scale of the\r\nconcussion from which he had rebounded, she found herself saddened and\r\nfrightened by the material he seemed to offer her to deal with. It _was_\r\ndevilish awkward, and it was so in part because Owen had no imagination.\r\nIt had lodged itself in that empty chamber that his mother hated the\r\nsurrender because she hated Mona. He didn\'t of course understand why she\r\nhated Mona, but this belonged to an order of mysteries that never\r\ntroubled him: there were lots of things, especially in people\'s minds,\r\nthat a fellow didn\'t understand. Poor Owen went through life with a\r\nfrank dread of people\'s minds: there were explanations he would have\r\nbeen almost as shy of receiving as of giving. There was therefore\r\nnothing that accounted for anything, though in its way it was vivid\r\nenough, in his picture to Fleda of his mother\'s virtual refusal to move.\r\nThat was simply what it was; for didn\'t she refuse to move when she as\r\ngood as declared that she would move only with the furniture? It was the\r\nfurniture she wouldn\'t give up; and what was the good of Poynton without\r\nthe furniture? Besides, the furniture happened to be his, just as\r\neverything else happened to be. The furniture--the word, on his lips,\r\nhad somehow, for Fleda, the sound of washing-stands and copious bedding,\r\nand she could well imagine the note it might have struck for Mrs.\r\nGereth. The girl, in this interview with him, spoke of the contents of\r\nthe house only as "the works of art." It didn\'t, however, in the least\r\nmatter to Owen what they were called; what did matter, she easily\r\nguessed, was that it had been laid upon him by Mona, been made in effect\r\na condition of her consent, that he should hold his mother to the\r\nstrictest accountability for them. Mona had already entered upon the\r\nenjoyment of her rights. She had made him feel that Mrs. Gereth had been\r\nliberally provided for, and had asked him cogently what room there would\r\nbe at Ricks for the innumerable treasures of the big house. Ricks, the\r\nsweet little place offered to the mistress of Poynton as the refuge of\r\nher declining years, had been left to the late Mr. Gereth, a\r\nconsiderable time before his death, by an old maternal aunt, a good lady\r\nwho had spent most of her life there. The house had in recent times been\r\nlet, but it was amply furnished, it contained all the defunct aunt\'s\r\npossessions. Owen had lately inspected it, and he communicated to Fleda\r\nthat he had quietly taken Mona to see it. It wasn\'t a place like\r\nPoynton--what dower-house ever was?--but it was an awfully jolly little\r\nplace, and Mona had taken a tremendous fancy to it. If there were a few\r\nthings at Poynton that were Mrs. Gereth\'s peculiar property, of course\r\nshe must take them away with her; but one of the matters that became\r\nclear to Fleda was that this transfer would be immediately subject to\r\nMiss Brigstock\'s approval. The special business that she herself now\r\nbecame aware of being charged with was that of seeing Mrs. Gereth safely\r\nand singly off the premises.\r\n\r\nHer heart failed her, after Owen had returned to London, with the\r\nugliness of this duty--with the ugliness, indeed, of the whole close\r\nconflict. She saw nothing of Mrs. Gereth that day; she spent it in\r\nroaming with sick sighs, in feeling, as she passed from room to room,\r\nthat what was expected of her companion was really dreadful. It would\r\nhave been better never to have had such a place than to have had it and\r\nlose it. It was odious to _her_ to have to look for solutions: what a\r\nstrange relation between mother and son when there was no fundamental\r\ntenderness out of which a solution would irrepressibly spring! Was it\r\nOwen who was mainly responsible for that poverty? Fleda couldn\'t think\r\nso when she remembered that, so far as he was concerned, Mrs. Gereth\r\nwould still have been welcome to have her seat by the Poynton fire. The\r\nfact that from the moment one accepted his marrying one saw no very\r\ndifferent course for Owen to take made her all the rest of that aching\r\nday find her best relief in the mercy of not having yet to face her\r\nhostess. She dodged and dreamed and romanced away the time; instead of\r\ninventing a remedy or a compromise, instead of preparing a plan by which\r\na scandal might be averted, she gave herself, in her sentient solitude,\r\nup to a mere fairy tale, up to the very taste of the beautiful peace\r\nwith which she would have filled the air if only something might have\r\nbeen that could never have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give up the house if they\'ll let me take what I require!" That, on\r\nthe morrow, was what Mrs. Gereth\'s stifled night had qualified her to\r\nsay, with a tragic face, at breakfast. Fleda reflected that what she\r\n"required" was simply every object that surrounded them. The poor woman\r\nwould have admitted this truth and accepted the conclusion to be drawn\r\nfrom it, the reduction to the absurd of her attitude, the exaltation of\r\nher revolt. The girl\'s dread of a scandal, of spectators and critics,\r\ndiminished the more she saw how little vulgar avidity had to do with\r\nthis rigor. It was not the crude love of possession; it was the need to\r\nbe faithful to a trust and loyal to an idea. The idea was surely noble:\r\nit was that of the beauty Mrs. Gereth had so patiently and consummately\r\nwrought. Pale but radiant, with her back to the wall, she rose there\r\nlike a heroine guarding a treasure. To give up the ship was to flinch\r\nfrom her duty; there was something in her eyes that declared she would\r\ndie at her post. If their difference should become public the shame\r\nwould be all for the others. If Waterbath thought it could afford to\r\nexpose itself, then Waterbath was welcome to the folly. Her fanaticism\r\ngave her a new distinction, and Fleda perceived almost with awe that she\r\nhad never carried herself so well. She trod the place like a reigning\r\nqueen or a proud usurper; full as it was of splendid pieces, it could\r\nshow in these days no ornament so effective as its menaced mistress.\r\n\r\nOur young lady\'s spirit was strangely divided; she had a tenderness for\r\nOwen which she deeply concealed, yet it left her occasion to marvel at\r\nthe way a man was made who could care in any relation for a creature\r\nlike Mona Brigstock when he had known in any relation a creature like\r\nAdela Gereth. With such a mother to give him the pitch, how could he\r\ntake it so low? She wondered that she didn\'t despise him for this, but\r\nthere was something that kept her from it. If there had been nothing\r\nelse it would have sufficed that she really found herself from this\r\nmoment the medium of communication with him.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll come back to assert himself," Mrs. Gereth had said; and the\r\nfollowing week Owen in fact reappeared. He might merely have written,\r\nFleda could see, but he had come in person because it was at once\r\n"nicer" for his mother and stronger for his cause. He didn\'t like the\r\nrow, though Mona probably did; if he hadn\'t a sense of beauty he had\r\nafter all a sense of justice; but it was inevitable he should clearly\r\nannounce at Poynton the date at which he must look to find the house\r\nvacant. "You don\'t think I\'m rough or hard, do you?" he asked of Fleda,\r\nhis impatience shining in his idle eyes as the dining-hour shines in\r\nclub-windows. "The place at Ricks stands there with open arms. And then\r\nI give her lots of time. Tell her she can remove everything that belongs\r\nto her." Fleda recognized the elements of what the newspapers call a\r\ndeadlock in the circumstance that nothing at Poynton belonged to Mrs.\r\nGereth either more or less than anything else. She must either take\r\neverything or nothing, and the girl\'s suggestion was that it might\r\nperhaps be an inspiration to do the latter and begin again on a clean\r\npage. What, however, was the poor woman, in that case, to begin with?\r\nWhat was she to do at all, on her meagre income, but make the best of\r\nthe _objets d\'art_ of Ricks, the treasures collected by Mr. Gereth\'s\r\nmaiden aunt? She had never been near the place: for long years it had\r\nbeen let to strangers, and after that the foreboding that it would be\r\nher doom had kept her from the abasement of it. She had felt that she\r\nshould see it soon enough, but Fleda (who was careful not to betray to\r\nher that Mona had seen it and had been gratified) knew her reasons for\r\nbelieving that the maiden aunt\'s principles had had much in common with\r\nthe principles of Waterbath. The only thing, in short, that she would\r\never have to do with the objets d\'art of Ricks would be to turn them out\r\ninto the road. What belonged to her at Poynton, as Owen said, would\r\nconveniently mitigate the void resulting from that demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of observations between the friends had grown very direct\r\nby the time Fleda asked Mrs. Gereth whether she literally meant to shut\r\nherself up and stand a siege, or whether it was her idea to expose\r\nherself, more informally, to be dragged out of the house by constables.\r\n"Oh, I prefer the constables and the dragging!" the heroine of Poynton\r\nhad answered. "I want to make Owen and Mona do everything that will be\r\nmost publicly odious." She gave it out that it was her one thought now\r\nto force them to a line that would dishonor them and dishonor the\r\ntradition they embodied, though Fleda was privately sure that she had\r\nvisions of an alternative policy. The strange thing was that, proud and\r\nfastidious all her life, she now showed so little distaste for the\r\nworld\'s hearing of the squabble. What had taken place in her above all\r\nwas that a long resentment had ripened. She hated the effacement to\r\nwhich English usage reduced the widowed mother: she had discoursed of it\r\npassionately to Fleda; contrasted it with the beautiful homage paid in\r\nother countries to women in that position, women no better than herself,\r\nwhom she had seen acclaimed and enthroned, whom she had known and\r\nenvied; made in short as little as possible a secret of the injury, the\r\nbitterness she found in it. The great wrong Owen had done her was not\r\nhis "taking up" with Mona--that was disgusting, but it was a detail, an\r\naccidental form: it was his failure from the first to understand what it\r\nwas to have a mother at all, to appreciate the beauty and sanctity of\r\nthe character. She was just his mother as his nose was just his nose,\r\nand he had never had the least imagination or tenderness or gallantry\r\nabout her. One\'s mother, gracious heaven, if one were the kind of fine\r\nyoung man one ought to be, the only kind Mrs. Gereth cared for, was a\r\nsubject for poetry, for idolatry. Hadn\'t she often told Fleda of her\r\nfriend Madame de Jaume, the wittiest of women, but a small, black,\r\ncrooked person, each of whose three boys, when absent, wrote to her\r\nevery day of their lives? She had the house in Paris, she had the house\r\nin Poitou, she had more than in the lifetime of her husband (to whom, in\r\nspite of her appearance, she had afforded repeated cause for jealousy),\r\nbecause she had to the end of her days the supreme word about\r\neverything. It was easy to see that Mrs. Gereth would have given again\r\nand again her complexion, her figure, and even perhaps the spotless\r\nvirtue she had still more successfully retained, to have been the\r\nconsecrated Madame de Jaume. She wasn\'t, alas, and this was what she had\r\nat present a magnificent occasion to protest against. She was of course\r\nfully aware of Owen\'s concession, his willingness to let her take away\r\nwith her the few things she liked best; but as yet she only declared\r\nthat to meet him on this ground would be to give him a triumph, to put\r\nhim impossibly in the right. "Liked best"? There wasn\'t a thing in the\r\nhouse that she didn\'t like best, and what she liked better still was to\r\nbe left where she was. How could Owen use such an expression without\r\nbeing conscious of his hypocrisy? Mrs. Gereth, whose criticism was often\r\ngay, dilated with sardonic humor on the happy look a dozen objects from\r\nPoynton would wear and the charming effect they would conduce to when\r\ninterspersed with the peculiar features of Ricks. What had her whole\r\nlife been but an effort toward completeness and perfection? Better\r\nWaterbath at once, in its cynical unity, than the ignominy of such a\r\nmixture!\r\n\r\nAll this was of no great help to Fleda, in so far as Fleda tried to rise\r\nto her mission of finding a way out. When at the end of a fortnight Owen\r\ncame down once more, it was ostensibly to tackle a farmer whose\r\nproceedings had been irregular; the girl was sure, however, that he had\r\nreally come, on the instance of Mona, to see what his mother was doing.\r\nHe wished to satisfy himself that she was preparing her departure, and\r\nhe wished to perform a duty, distinct but not less imperative, in regard\r\nto the question of the perquisites with which she would retreat. The\r\ntension between them was now such that he had to perpetrate these\r\noffenses without meeting his adversary. Mrs. Gereth was as willing as\r\nhimself that he should address to Fleda Vetch whatever cruel remarks he\r\nmight have to make: she only pitied her poor young friend for repeated\r\nencounters with a person as to whom she perfectly understood the girl\'s\r\nrepulsion. Fleda thought it nice of Owen not to have expected her to\r\nwrite to him; he wouldn\'t have wished any more than herself that she\r\nshould have the air of spying on his mother in his interest. What made\r\nit comfortable to deal with him in this more familiar way was the sense\r\nthat she understood so perfectly how poor Mrs. Gereth suffered, and that\r\nshe measured so adequately the sacrifice the other side did take rather\r\nmonstrously for granted. She understood equally how Owen himself\r\nsuffered, now that Mona had already begun to make him do things he\r\ndidn\'t like. Vividly Fleda apprehended how _she_ would have first made\r\nhim like anything she would have made him do; anything even as\r\ndisagreeable as this appearing there to state, virtually on Mona\'s\r\nbehalf, that of course there must be a definite limit to the number of\r\narticles appropriated. She took a longish stroll with him in order to\r\ntalk the matter over; to say if she didn\'t think a dozen pieces, chosen\r\nabsolutely at will, would be a handsome allowance; and above all to\r\nconsider the very delicate question of whether the advantage enjoyed by\r\nMrs. Gereth mightn\'t be left to her honor. To leave it so was what Owen\r\nwished; but there was plainly a young lady at Waterbath to whom, on his\r\nside, he already had to render an account. He was as touching in his\r\noffhand annoyance as his mother was tragic in her intensity; for if he\r\ncouldn\'t help having a sense of propriety about the whole matter, so he\r\ncould as little help hating it. It was for his hating it, Fleda\r\nreasoned, that she liked him so, and her insistence to his mother on the\r\nhatred perilously resembled, on one or two occasions, a revelation of\r\nthe liking. There were moments when, in conscience, that revelation\r\npressed her; inasmuch as it was just on the ground of her not liking him\r\nthat Mrs. Gereth trusted her so much. Mrs. Gereth herself didn\'t in\r\nthese days like him at all, and she was of course and always on Mrs.\r\nGereth\'s side. He ended really, while the preparations for his marriage\r\nwent on, by quite a little custom of coming and going; but on no one of\r\nthese occasions would his mother receive him. He talked only with Fleda\r\nand strolled with Fleda; and when he asked her, in regard to the great\r\nmatter, if Mrs. Gereth were really doing nothing, the girl usually\r\nreplied: "She pretends not to be, if I may say so; but I think she\'s\r\nreally thinking over what she\'ll take." When her friend asked her what\r\nOwen was doing, she could have but one answer: "He\'s waiting, dear lady,\r\nto see what _you_ do!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth, a month after she had received her great shock, did\r\nsomething abrupt and extraordinary: she caught up her companion and went\r\nto have a look at Ricks. They had come to London first and taken a train\r\nfrom Liverpool Street, and the least of the sufferings they were armed\r\nagainst was that of passing the night. Fleda\'s admirable dressing-bag\r\nhad been given her by her friend. "Why, it\'s charming!" she exclaimed a\r\nfew hours later, turning back again into the small prim parlor from a\r\nfriendly advance to the single plate of the window. Mrs. Gereth hated\r\nsuch windows, the one flat glass, sliding up and down, especially when\r\nthey enjoyed a view of four iron pots on pedestals, painted white and\r\ncontaining ugly geraniums, ranged on the edge of a gravel-path and doing\r\ntheir best to give it the air of a terrace. Fleda had instantly averted\r\nher eyes from these ornaments, but Mrs. Gereth grimly gazed, wondering\r\nof course how a place in the deepest depths of Essex and three miles\r\nfrom a small station could contrive to look so suburban. The room was\r\npractically a shallow box, with the junction of the walls and ceiling\r\nguiltless of curve or cornice and marked merely by the little band of\r\ncrimson paper glued round the top of the other paper, a turbid gray\r\nsprigged with silver flowers. This decoration was rather new and quite\r\nfresh; and there was in the centre of the ceiling a big square beam\r\npapered over in white, as to which Fleda hesitated about venturing to\r\nremark that it was rather picturesque. She recognized in time that this\r\nremark would be weak and that, throughout, she should be able to say\r\nnothing either for the mantelpieces or for the doors, of which she saw\r\nher companion become sensible with a soundless moan. On the subject of\r\ndoors especially Mrs. Gereth had the finest views: the thing in the\r\nworld she most despised was the meanness of the single flap. From end to\r\nend, at Poynton, there were high double leaves. At Ricks the entrances\r\nto the rooms were like the holes of rabbit-hutches.\r\n\r\nIt was all, none the less, not so bad as Fleda had feared; it was faded\r\nand melancholy, whereas there had been a danger that it would be\r\ncontradictious and positive, cheerful and loud. The house was crowded\r\nwith objects of which the aggregation somehow made a thinness and the\r\nfutility a grace; things that told her they had been gathered as slowly\r\nand as lovingly as the golden flowers of Poynton. She too, for a home,\r\ncould have lived with them: they made her fond of the old maiden-aunt;\r\nthey made her even wonder if it didn\'t work more for happiness not to\r\nhave tasted, as she herself had done, of knowledge. Without resources,\r\nwithout a stick, as she said, of her own, Fleda was moved, after all, to\r\nsome secret surprise at the pretensions of a shipwrecked woman who could\r\nhold such an asylum cheap. The more she looked about the surer she felt\r\nof the character of the maiden-aunt, the sense of whose dim presence\r\nurged her to pacification: the maiden-aunt had been a dear; she would\r\nhave adored the maiden-aunt. The poor lady had had some tender little\r\nstory; she had been sensitive and ignorant and exquisite: that too was a\r\nsort of origin, a sort of atmosphere for relics and rarities, though\r\ndifferent from the sorts most prized at Poynton. Mrs. Gereth had of\r\ncourse more than once said that one of the deepest mysteries of life was\r\nthe way that, by certain natures, hideous objects could be loved; but it\r\nwasn\'t a question of love, now, for these: it was only a question of a\r\ncertain practical patience. Perhaps some thought of that kind had stolen\r\nover Mrs. Gereth when, at the end of a brooding hour, she exclaimed,\r\ntaking in the house with a strenuous sigh: "Well, something can be done\r\nwith it!" Fleda had repeated to her more than once the indulgent fancy\r\nabout the maiden-aunt--she was so sure she had deeply suffered. "I\'m\r\nsure I hope she did!" was, however, all that Mrs. Gereth had replied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief to the girl at last to perceive that the dreadful\r\nmove would really be made. What might happen if it shouldn\'t had been\r\nfrom the first indefinite. It was absurd to pretend that any violence\r\nwas probable--a tussel, dishevelment, shrieks; yet Fleda had an\r\nimagination of a drama, a "great scene," a thing, somehow, of indignity\r\nand misery, of wounds inflicted and received, in which indeed, though\r\nMrs. Gereth\'s presence, with movements and sounds, loomed large to her,\r\nOwen remained indistinct and on the whole unaggressive. He wouldn\'t be\r\nthere with a cigarette in his teeth, very handsome and insolently quiet:\r\nthat was only the way he would be in a novel, across whose interesting\r\npage some such figure, as she half closed her eyes, seemed to her to\r\nwalk. Fleda had rather, and indeed with shame, a confused, pitying\r\nvision of Mrs. Gereth with her great scene left in a manner on her\r\nhands, Mrs. Gereth missing her effect and having to appear merely hot\r\nand injured and in the wrong. The symptoms that she would be spared even\r\nthat spectacle resided not so much, through the chambers of Poynton, in\r\nan air of concentration as in the hum of buzzing alternatives. There was\r\nno common preparation, but one day, at the turn of a corridor, she found\r\nher hostess standing very still, with the hanging hands of an invalid\r\nand the active eyes of an adventurer. These eyes appeared to Fleda to\r\nmeet her own with a strange, dim bravado, and there was a silence,\r\nalmost awkward, before either of the friends spoke. The girl afterwards\r\nthought of the moment as one in which her hostess mutely accused her of\r\nan accusation, meeting it, however, at the same time, by a kind of\r\ndefiant acceptance. Yet it was with mere melancholy candor that Mrs.\r\nGereth at last sighingly exclaimed: "I\'m thinking over what I had better\r\ntake!" Fleda could have embraced her for this virtual promise of a\r\nconcession, the announcement that she had finally accepted the problem\r\nof knocking together a shelter with the small salvage of the wreck.\r\n\r\nIt was true that when after their return from Ricks they tried to\r\nlighten the ship, the great embarrassment was still immutably there, the\r\nodiousness of sacrificing the exquisite things one wouldn\'t take to the\r\nexquisite things one would. This immediately made the things one\r\nwouldn\'t take the very things one ought to, and, as Mrs. Gereth said,\r\ncondemned one, in the whole business, to an eternal vicious circle. In\r\nsuch a circle, for days, she had been tormentedly moving, prowling up\r\nand down, comparing incomparables. It was for that one had to cling to\r\nthem and their faces of supplication. Fleda herself could judge of these\r\nfaces, so conscious of their race and their danger, and she had little\r\nenough to say when her companion asked her if the whole place,\r\nperversely fair on October afternoons, looked like a place to give up.\r\nIt looked, to begin with, through some effect of season and light,\r\nlarger than ever, immense, and it was filled with the hush of sorrow,\r\nwhich in turn was all charged with memories. Everything was in the\r\nair--every history of every find, every circumstance of every struggle.\r\nMrs. Gereth had drawn back every curtain and removed every cover; she\r\nprolonged the vistas, opened wide the whole house, gave it an appearance\r\nof awaiting a royal visit. The shimmer of wrought substances spent\r\nitself in the brightness; the old golds and brasses, old ivories and\r\nbronzes, the fresh old tapestries and deep old damasks threw out a\r\nradiance in which the poor woman saw in solution all her old loves and\r\npatiences, all her old tricks and triumphs.\r\n\r\nFleda had a depressed sense of not, after all, helping her much: this\r\nwas lightened indeed by the fact that Mrs. Gereth, letting her off\r\neasily, didn\'t now seem to expect it. Her sympathy, her interest, her\r\nfeeling for everything for which Mrs. Gereth felt, were a force that\r\nreally worked to prolong the deadlock. "I only wish I bored you and my\r\npossessions bored you," that lady, with some humor, declared; "then\r\nyou\'d make short work with me, bundle me off, tell me just to pile\r\ncertain things into a cart and have done." Fleda\'s sharpest difficulty\r\nwas in having to act up to the character of thinking Owen a brute, or at\r\nleast to carry off the inconsistency of seeing him when he came down. By\r\ngood fortune it was her duty, her function, as well as a protection to\r\nMrs. Gereth. She thought of him perpetually, and her eyes had come to\r\nrejoice in his manly magnificence more even than they rejoiced in the\r\nroyal cabinets of the red saloon. She wondered, very faintly at first,\r\nwhy he came so often; but of course she knew nothing about the business\r\nhe had in hand, over which, with men red-faced and leather-legged, he\r\nwas sometimes closeted for an hour in a room of his own that was the one\r\nmonstrosity of Poynton: all tobacco-pots and bootjacks, his mother had\r\nsaid--such an array of arms of aggression and castigation that he\r\nhimself had confessed to eighteen rifles and forty whips. He was\r\narranging for settlements on his wife, he was doing things that would\r\nmeet the views of the Brigstocks. Considering the house was his own,\r\nFleda thought it nice of him to keep himself in the background while his\r\nmother remained; making his visits, at some cost of ingenuity about\r\ntrains from town, only between meals, doing everything to let it press\r\nlightly upon her that he was there. This was rather a stoppage to her\r\nmeeting Mrs. Gereth on the ground of his being a brute; the most she\r\nreally at last could do was not to contradict her when she repeated that\r\nhe was watching--just insultingly watching. He _was_ watching, no doubt;\r\nbut he watched somehow with his head turned away. He knew that Fleda\r\nknew at present what he wanted of her, so that it would be gross of him\r\nto say it over and over. It existed as a confidence between them, and\r\nmade him sometimes, with his wandering stare, meet her eyes as if a\r\nsilence so pleasant could only unite them the more. He had no great flow\r\nof speech, certainly, and at first the girl took for granted that this\r\nwas all there was to be said about the matter. Little by little she\r\nspeculated as to whether, with a person who, like herself, could put\r\nhim, after all, at a sort of domestic ease, it was not supposable that\r\nhe would have more conversation if he were not keeping some of it back\r\nfor Mona.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment she suspected he might be thinking what Mona would say\r\nto his chattering so to an underhand "companion," who was all but paid,\r\nthis young lady\'s repressed emotion began to require still more\r\nrepression. She grew impatient of her situation at Poynton; she\r\nprivately pronounced it false and horrid. She said to herself that she\r\nhad let Owen know that she had, to the best of her power, directed his\r\nmother in the general sense he desired; that he quite understood it and\r\nthat he also understood how unworthy it was of either of them to stand\r\nover the good lady with a notebook and a lash. Wasn\'t this practical\r\nunanimity just practical success? Fleda became aware of a sudden desire,\r\nas well as of pressing reasons, to bring her stay at Poynton to a close.\r\nShe had not, on the one hand, like a minion of the law, undertaken to\r\nsee Mrs. Gereth down to the train and locked, in sign of her abdication,\r\ninto a compartment; neither had she on the other committed herself to\r\nhold Owen indefinitely in dalliance while his mother gained time or dug\r\na counter-mine. Besides, people _were_ saying that she fastened like a\r\nleech on other people--people who had houses where something was to be\r\npicked up: this revelation was frankly made her by her sister, now\r\ndistinctly doomed to the curate and in view of whose nuptials she had\r\nalmost finished, as a present, a wonderful piece of embroidery,\r\nsuggested, at Poynton, by an old Spanish altar-cloth. She would have to\r\nexert herself still further for the intended recipient of this offering,\r\nturn her out for her marriage with more than that drapery. She would go\r\nup to town, in short, to dress Maggie; and their father, in lodgings at\r\nWest Kensington, would stretch a point and take them in. He, to do him\r\njustice, never reproached her with profitable devotions; so far as they\r\nexisted he consciously profited by them. Mrs. Gereth gave her up as\r\nheroically as if she had been a great bargain, and Fleda knew that she\r\nwouldn\'t at present miss any visit of Owen\'s, for Owen was shooting at\r\nWaterbath. Owen shooting was Owen lost, and there was scant sport at\r\nPoynton.\r\n\r\nThe first news she had from Mrs. Gereth was news of that lady\'s having\r\naccomplished, in form at least, her migration. The letter was dated from\r\nRicks, to which place she had been transported by an impulse apparently\r\nas sudden as the inspiration she had obeyed before. "Yes, I\'ve literally\r\ncome," she wrote, "with a bandbox and a kitchen-maid; I\'ve crossed the\r\nRubicon, I\'ve taken possession. It has been like plumping into cold\r\nwater: I saw the only thing was to do it, not to stand shivering. I\r\nshall have warmed the place a little by simply being here for a week;\r\nwhen I come back the ice will have been broken. I didn\'t write to you to\r\nmeet me on my way through town, because I know how busy you are and\r\nbecause, besides, I\'m too savage and odious to be fit company even for\r\nyou. You\'d say I really go too far, and there\'s no doubt whatever I do.\r\nI\'m here, at any rate, just to look round once more, to see that certain\r\nthings are done before I enter in force. I shall probably be at Poynton\r\nall next week. There\'s more room than I quite measured the other day,\r\nand a rather good set of old Worcester. But what are space and time,\r\nwhat\'s even old Worcester, to your wretched and affectionate A. G.?"\r\n\r\nThe day after Fleda received this letter she had occasion to go into a\r\nbig shop in Oxford Street--a journey that she achieved circuitously,\r\nfirst on foot and then by the aid of two omnibuses. The second of these\r\nvehicles put her down on the side of the street opposite her shop, and\r\nwhile, on the curbstone, she humbly waited, with a parcel, an umbrella,\r\nand a tucked-up frock, to cross in security, she became aware that,\r\nclose beside her, a hansom had pulled up short, in obedience to the\r\nbrandished stick of a demonstrative occupant. This occupant was Owen\r\nGereth, who had caught sight of her as he rattled along and who, with an\r\nexhibition of white teeth that, from under the hood of the cab, had\r\nalmost flashed through the fog, now alighted to ask her if he couldn\'t\r\ngive her a lift. On finding that her destination was only over the way\r\nhe dismissed his vehicle and joined her, not only piloting her to the\r\nshop, but taking her in; with the assurance that his errands didn\'t\r\nmatter, that it amused him to be concerned with hers. She told him she\r\nhad come to buy a trimming for her sister\'s frock, and he expressed an\r\nhilarious interest in the purchase. His hilarity was almost always out\r\nof proportion to the case, but it struck her at present as more so than\r\never; especially when she had suggested that he might find it a good\r\ntime to buy a garnishment of some sort for Mona. After wondering an\r\ninstant whether he gave the full satiric meaning, such as it was, to\r\nthis remark, Fleda dismissed the possibility as inconceivable. He\r\nstammered out that it was for _her_ he would like to buy something,\r\nsomething "ripping," and that she must give him the pleasure of telling\r\nhim what would best please her: he couldn\'t have a better opportunity\r\nfor making her a present--the present, in recognition of all she had\r\ndone for Mummy, that he had had in his head for weeks.\r\n\r\nFleda had more than one small errand in the big bazaar, and he went up\r\nand down with her, pointedly patient, pretending to be interested in\r\nquestions of tape and of change. She had now not the least hesitation in\r\nwondering what Mona would think of such proceedings. But they were not\r\nher doing--they were Owen\'s; and Owen, inconsequent and even\r\nextravagant, was unlike anything she had ever seen him before. He broke\r\noff, he came back, he repeated questions without heeding answers, he\r\nmade vague, abrupt remarks about the resemblances of shopgirls and the\r\nuses of chiffon. He unduly prolonged their business together, giving\r\nFleda a sense that he was putting off something particular that he had\r\nto face. If she had ever dreamed of Owen Gereth as nervous she would\r\nhave seen him with some such manner as this. But why should he be\r\nnervous? Even at the height of the crisis his mother hadn\'t made him so,\r\nand at present he was satisfied about his mother. The one idea he stuck\r\nto was that Fleda should mention something she would let him give her:\r\nthere was everything in the world in the wonderful place, and he made\r\nher incongruous offers--a traveling-rug, a massive clock, a table for\r\nbreakfast in bed, and above all, in a resplendent binding, a set of\r\nsomebody\'s "works." His notion was a testimonial, a tribute, and the\r\n"works" would be a graceful intimation that it was her cleverness he\r\nwished above all to commemorate. He was immensely in earnest, but the\r\narticles he pressed upon her betrayed a delicacy that went to her heart:\r\nwhat he would really have liked, as he saw them tumbled about, was one\r\nof the splendid stuffs for a gown--a choice proscribed by his fear of\r\nseeming to patronize her, to refer to her small means and her\r\ndeficiencies. Fleda found it easy to chaff him about his exaggeration of\r\nher deserts; she gave the just measure of them in consenting to accept a\r\nsmall pin-cushion, costing sixpence, in which the letter F was marked\r\nout with pins. A sense of loyalty to Mona was not needed to enforce this\r\ndiscretion, and after that first allusion to her she never sounded her\r\nname. She noticed on this occasion more things in Owen Gereth than she\r\nhad ever noticed before, but what she noticed most was that he said no\r\nword of his intended. She asked herself what he had done, in so long a\r\nparenthesis, with his loyalty or at least his "form;" and then reflected\r\nthat even if he had done something very good with them the situation in\r\nwhich such a question could come up was already a little strange. Of\r\ncourse he wasn\'t doing anything so vulgar as making love to her; but\r\nthere was a kind of punctilio for a man who was engaged.\r\n\r\nThat punctilio didn\'t prevent Owen from remaining with her after they\r\nhad left the shop, from hoping she had a lot more to do, and from\r\npressing her to look with him, for a possible glimpse of something she\r\nmight really let him give her, into the windows of other establishments.\r\nThere was a moment when, under this pressure, she made up her mind that\r\nhis tribute would be, if analyzed, a tribute to her insignificance. But\r\nall the same he wanted her to come somewhere and have luncheon with him:\r\nwhat was that a tribute to? She must have counted very little if she\r\ndidn\'t count too much for a romp in a restaurant. She had to get home\r\nwith her trimming, and the most, in his company, she was amenable to was\r\na retracing of her steps to the Marble Arch and then, after a discussion\r\nwhen they had reached it, a walk with him across the Park. She knew Mona\r\nwould have considered that she ought to take the omnibus again; but she\r\nhad now to think for Owen as well as for herself--she couldn\'t think for\r\nMona. Even in the Park the autumn air was thick, and as they moved\r\nwestward over the grass, which was what Owen preferred, the cool\r\ngrayness made their words soft, made them at last rare and everything\r\nelse dim. He wanted to stay with her--he wanted not to leave her: he had\r\ndropped into complete silence, but that was what his silence said. What\r\nwas it he had postponed? What was it he wanted still to postpone? She\r\ngrew a little scared as they strolled together and she thought. It was\r\ntoo confused to be believed, but it was as if somehow he felt\r\ndifferently. Fleda Vetch didn\'t suspect him at first of feeling\r\ndifferently to _her_, but only of feeling differently to Mona; yet she\r\nwas not unconscious that this latter difference would have had something\r\nto do with his being on the grass beside her. She had read in novels\r\nabout gentlemen who on the eve of marriage, winding up the past, had\r\nsurrendered themselves for the occasion to the influence of a former\r\ntie; and there was something in Owen\'s behavior now, something in his\r\nvery face, that suggested a resemblance to one of those gentlemen. But\r\nwhom and what, in that case, would Fleda herself resemble? She wasn\'t a\r\nformer tie, she wasn\'t any tie at all; she was only a deep little person\r\nfor whom happiness was a kind of pearl-diving plunge. It was down at the\r\nvery bottom of all that had lately happened; for all that had lately\r\nhappened was that Owen Gereth had come and gone at Poynton. That was the\r\nsmall sum of her experience, and what it had made for her was her own\r\naffair, quite consistent with her not having dreamed it had made a\r\ntie--at least what _she_ called one--for Owen. The old one, at any rate,\r\nwas Mona--Mona whom he had known so very much longer.\r\n\r\nThey walked far, to the southwest corner of the great Gardens, where, by\r\nthe old round pond and the old red palace, when she had put out her hand\r\nto him in farewell, declaring that from the gate she must positively\r\ntake a conveyance, it seemed suddenly to rise between them that this was\r\na real separation. She was on his mother\'s side, she belonged to his\r\nmother\'s life, and his mother, in the future, would never come to\r\nPoynton. After what had passed she wouldn\'t even be at his wedding, and\r\nit was not possible now that Mrs. Gereth should mention that ceremony to\r\nthe girl, much less express a wish that the girl should be present at\r\nit. Mona, from decorum and with reference less to the bridegroom than to\r\nthe bridegroom\'s mother, would of course not invite any such girl as\r\nFleda. Everything therefore was ended; they would go their different\r\nways; this was the last time they would stand face to face. They looked\r\nat each other with the fuller sense of it and, on Owen\'s part, with an\r\nexpression of dumb trouble, the intensification of his usual appeal to\r\nany interlocutor to add the right thing to what he said. To Fleda, at\r\nthis moment, it appeared that the right thing might easily be the wrong.\r\nHe only said, at any rate: "I want you to understand, you know--I want\r\nyou to understand."\r\n\r\nWhat did he want her to understand? He seemed unable to bring it out,\r\nand this understanding was moreover exactly what she wished not to\r\narrive at. Bewildered as she was, she had already taken in as much as\r\nshe should know what to do with; the blood also was rushing into her\r\nface. He liked her--it was stupefying--more than he really ought: that\r\nwas what was the matter with him and what he desired her to assimilate;\r\nso that she was suddenly as frightened as some thoughtless girl who\r\nfinds herself the object of an overture from a married man.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Mr. Gereth--I _must_ get on!" she declared with a\r\ncheerfulness that she felt to be an unnatural grimace. She broke away\r\nfrom him sharply, smiling, backing across the grass and then turning\r\naltogether and moving as fast as she could. "Good-bye, good-bye!" she\r\nthrew off again as she went, wondering if he would overtake her before\r\nshe reached the gate; conscious with a red disgust that her movement was\r\nalmost a run; conscious too of just the confused, handsome face with\r\nwhich he would look after her. She felt as if she had answered a\r\nkindness with a great flouncing snub, but at any rate she had got away,\r\nthough the distance to the gate, her ugly gallop down the Broad Walk,\r\nevery graceless jerk of which hurt her, seemed endless. She signed from\r\nafar to a cab on the stand in the Kensington Road and scrambled into it,\r\nglad of the encompassment of the four-wheeler that had officiously\r\nobeyed her summons and that, at the end of twenty yards, when she had\r\nviolently pulled up a glass, permitted her to recognize the fact that\r\nshe was on the point of bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as her sister was married she went down to Mrs. Gereth at\r\nRicks--a promise to this effect having been promptly exacted and given;\r\nand her inner vision was much more fixed on the alterations there,\r\ncomplete now, as she understood, than on the success of her plotting and\r\npinching for Maggie\'s happiness. Her imagination, in the interval, had\r\nindeed had plenty to do and numerous scenes to visit; for when on the\r\nsummons just mentioned it had taken a flight from West Kensington to\r\nRicks, it had hung but an hour over the terrace of painted pots and then\r\nyielded to a current of the upper air that swept it straight off to\r\nPoynton and to Waterbath. Not a sound had reached her of any supreme\r\nclash, and Mrs. Gereth had communicated next to nothing; giving out\r\nthat, as was easily conceivable, she was too busy, too bitter, and too\r\ntired for vain civilities. All she had written was that she had got the\r\nnew place well in hand and that Fleda would be surprised at the way it\r\nwas turning out. Everything was even yet upside down; nevertheless, in\r\nthe sense of having passed the threshold of Poynton for the last time,\r\nthe amputation, as she called it, had been performed. Her leg had come\r\noff--she had now begun to stump along with the lovely wooden substitute;\r\nshe would stump for life, and what her young friend was to come and\r\nadmire was the beauty of her movement and the noise she made about the\r\nhouse. The reserve of Poynton and Waterbath had been matched by the\r\nausterity of Fleda\'s own secret, under the discipline of which she had\r\nrepeated to herself a hundred times a day that she rejoiced at having\r\ncares that excluded all thought of it. She had lavished herself, in act,\r\non Maggie and the curate, and had opposed to her father\'s selfishness a\r\nsweetness quite ecstatic. The young couple wondered why they had waited\r\nso long, since everything was after all so easy. She had thought of\r\neverything, even to how the "quietness" of the wedding should be\r\nrelieved by champagne and her father kept brilliant on a single bottle.\r\nFleda knew, in short, and liked the knowledge, that for several weeks\r\nshe had appeared exemplary in every relation of life.\r\n\r\nShe had been perfectly prepared to be surprised at Ricks, for Mrs.\r\nGereth was a wonder-working wizard, with a command, when all was said,\r\nof good material; but the impression in wait for her on the threshold\r\nmade her catch her breath and falter. Dusk had fallen when she arrived,\r\nand in the plain square hall, one of the few good features, the glow of\r\na Venetian lamp just showed, on either wall, the richness of an\r\nadmirable tapestry. This instant perception that the place had been\r\ndressed at the expense of Poynton was a shock: it was as if she had\r\nabruptly seen herself in the light of an accomplice. The next moment,\r\nfolded in Mrs. Gereth\'s arms, her eyes were diverted; but she had\r\nalready had, in a flash, the vision of the great gaps in the other\r\nhouse. The two tapestries, not the largest, but those most splendidly\r\ntoned by time, had been on the whole its most uplifted pride. When she\r\ncould really see again she was on a sofa in the drawing-room, staring\r\nwith intensity at an object soon distinct as the great Italian cabinet\r\nthat, at Poynton, had been in the red saloon. Without looking, she was\r\nsure the room was occupied with other objects like it, stuffed with as\r\nmany as it could hold of the trophies of her friend\'s struggle. By this\r\ntime the very fingers of her glove, resting on the seat of the sofa, had\r\nthrilled at the touch of an old velvet brocade, a wondrous texture that\r\nshe could recognize, would have recognized among a thousand, without\r\ndropping her eyes on it. They stuck to the cabinet with a kind of\r\ndissimulated dread, while she painfully asked herself whether she should\r\nnotice it, notice everything, or just pretend not to be affected. How\r\ncould she pretend not to be affected, with the very pendants of the\r\nlustres tinkling at her and with Mrs. Gereth, beside her and staring at\r\nher even as she herself stared at the cabinet, hunching up a back like\r\nAtlas under his globe? She was appalled at this image of what Mrs.\r\nGereth had on her shoulders. That lady was waiting and watching her,\r\nbracing herself, and preparing the same face of confession and defiance\r\nshe had shown the day, at Poynton, she had been surprised in the\r\ncorridor. It was farcical not to speak; and yet to exclaim, to\r\nparticipate, would give one a bad sense of being mixed up with a theft.\r\nThis ugly word sounded, for herself, in Fleda\'s silence, and the very\r\nviolence of it jarred her into a scared glance, as of a creature\r\ndetected, to right and left. But what again the full picture most showed\r\nher was the far-away empty sockets, a scandal of nakedness in high, bare\r\nwalls. She at last uttered something formal and incoherent--she didn\'t\r\nknow what: it had no relation to either house. Then she felt Mrs.\r\nGereth\'s hand once more on her arm. "I\'ve arranged a charming room for\r\nyou--it\'s really lovely. You\'ll be very happy there." This was spoken\r\nwith extraordinary sweetness and with a smile that meant, "Oh, I know\r\nwhat you\'re thinking; but what does it matter when you\'re so loyally on\r\nmy side?" It had come indeed to a question of "sides," Fleda thought,\r\nfor the whole place was in battle array. In the soft lamplight, with one\r\nfine feature after another looming up into sombre richness, it defied\r\nher not to pronounce it a triumph of taste. Her passion for beauty\r\nleaped back into life; and was not what now most appealed to it a\r\ncertain gorgeous audacity? Mrs. Gereth\'s high hand was, as mere great\r\neffect, the climax of the impression.\r\n\r\n"It\'s too wonderful, what you\'ve done with the house!"--the visitor met\r\nher friend\'s eyes. They lighted up with joy--that friend herself so\r\npleased with what she had done. This was not at all, in its accidental\r\nair of enthusiasm, what Fleda wanted to have said: it offered her as\r\nstupidly announcing from the first minute on whose side she was. Such\r\nwas clearly the way Mrs. Gereth took it: she threw herself upon the\r\ndelightful girl and tenderly embraced her again; so that Fleda soon went\r\non, with a studied difference and a cooler inspection: "Why, you brought\r\naway absolutely everything!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, not everything; I saw how little I could get into this scrap of\r\na house. I only brought away what I required."\r\n\r\nFleda had got up; she took a turn round the room. "You \'required\' the\r\nvery best pieces--the _morceaux de mus\xe9e_, the individual gems!"\r\n\r\n"I certainly didn\'t want the rubbish, if that\'s what you mean." Mrs.\r\nGereth, on the sofa, followed the direction of her companion\'s eyes;\r\nwith the light of her satisfaction still in her face, she slowly rubbed\r\nher large, handsome hands. Wherever she was, she was herself the great\r\npiece in the gallery. It was the first Fleda had heard of there being\r\n"rubbish" at Poynton, but she didn\'t for the moment take up this\r\ninsincerity; she only, from where she stood in the room, called out, one\r\nafter the other, as if she had had a list in her hand, the pieces that\r\nin the great house had been scattered and that now, if they had a fault,\r\nwere too much like a minuet danced on a hearth-rug. She knew them each,\r\nin every chink and charm--knew them by the personal name their\r\ndistinctive sign or story had given them; and a second time she felt\r\nhow, against her intention, this uttered knowledge struck her hostess as\r\nso much free approval. Mrs. Gereth was never indifferent to approval,\r\nand there was nothing she could so love you for as for doing justice to\r\nher deep morality. There was a particular gleam in her eyes when Fleda\r\nexclaimed at last, dazzled by the display: "And even the Maltese cross!"\r\nThat description, though technically incorrect, had always been applied,\r\nat Poynton, to a small but marvelous crucifix of ivory, a masterpiece of\r\ndelicacy, of expression, and of the great Spanish period, the existence\r\nand precarious accessibility of which she had heard of at Malta, years\r\nbefore, by an odd and romantic chance--a clue followed through mazes of\r\nsecrecy till the treasure was at last unearthed.\r\n\r\n"\'Even\' the Maltese cross?" Mrs. Gereth rose as she sharply echoed the\r\nwords. "My dear child, you don\'t suppose I\'d have sacrificed _that_! For\r\nwhat in the world would you have taken me?"\r\n\r\n"A _bibelot_ the more or the less," Fleda said, "could have made little\r\ndifference in this grand general view of you. I take you simply for the\r\ngreatest of all conjurers. You\'ve operated with a quickness--and with a\r\nquietness!" Her voice trembled a little as she spoke, for the plain\r\nmeaning of her words was that what her friend had achieved belonged to\r\nthe class of operation essentially involving the protection of darkness.\r\nFleda felt she really could say nothing at all if she couldn\'t say that\r\nshe knew what the danger had been. She completed her thought by a\r\nresolute and perfectly candid question: "How in the world did you get\r\noff with them?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth confessed to the fact of danger with a cynicism that\r\nsurprised the girl. "By calculating, by choosing my time. I _was_ quiet,\r\nand I _was_ quick. I manoeuvred; then at the last rushed!" Fleda drew\r\na long breath: she saw in the poor woman something much better than\r\nsophistical ease, a crude elation that was a comparatively simple state\r\nto deal with. Her elation, it was true, was not so much from what she\r\nhad done as from the way she had done it--by as brilliant a stroke as\r\nany commemorated in the annals of crime. "I succeeded because I had\r\nthought it all out and left nothing to chance: the whole process was\r\norganized in advance, so that the mere carrying it into effect took but\r\na few hours. It was largely a matter of money: oh, I was horribly\r\nextravagant--I had to turn on so many people. But they were all to be\r\nhad--a little army of workers, the packers, the porters, the helpers of\r\nevery sort, the men with the mighty vans. It was a question of arranging\r\nin Tottenham Court Road and of paying the price. I haven\'t paid it yet;\r\nthere\'ll be a horrid bill; but at least the thing\'s done! Expedition\r\npure and simple was the essence of the bargain. \'I can give you two\r\ndays,\' I said; \'I can\'t give you another second.\' They undertook the\r\njob, and the two days saw them through. The people came down on a\r\nTuesday morning; they were off on the Thursday. I admit that some of\r\nthem worked all Wednesday night. I had thought it all out; I stood over\r\nthem; I showed them how. Yes, I coaxed them, I made love to them. Oh, I\r\nwas inspired--they found me wonderful. I neither ate nor slept, but I\r\nwas as calm as I am now. I didn\'t know what was in me; it was worth\r\nfinding out. I\'m very remarkable, my dear: I lifted tons with my own\r\narms. I\'m tired, very, very tired; but there\'s neither a scratch nor a\r\nnick, there isn\'t a teacup missing." Magnificent both in her exhaustion\r\nand in her triumph, Mrs. Gereth sank on the sofa again, the sweep of her\r\neyes a rich synthesis and the restless friction of her hands a clear\r\nbetrayal. "Upon my word," she laughed, "they really look better here!"\r\n\r\nFleda had listened in awe. "And no one at Poynton said anything? There\r\nwas no alarm?"\r\n\r\n"What alarm should there have been? Owen left me almost defiantly alone:\r\nI had taken a time that I had reason to believe was safe from a\r\ndescent." Fleda had another wonder, which she hesitated to express: it\r\nwould scarcely do to ask Mrs. Gereth if she hadn\'t stood in fear of her\r\nservants. She knew, moreover, some of the secrets of her humorous\r\nhousehold rule, all made up of shocks to shyness and provocations to\r\ncuriosity--a diplomacy so artful that several of the maids quite yearned\r\nto accompany her to Ricks. Mrs. Gereth, reading sharply the whole of her\r\nvisitor\'s thought, caught it up with fine frankness. "You mean that I\r\nwas watched--that he had his myrmidons, pledged to wire him if they\r\nshould see what I was \'up to\'? Precisely. I know the three persons you\r\nhave in mind: I had them in mind myself. Well, I took a line with\r\nthem--I settled them."\r\n\r\nFleda had had no one in particular in mind; she had never believed in\r\nthe myrmidons; but the tone in which Mrs. Gereth spoke added to her\r\nsuspense. "What did you do to them?"\r\n\r\n"I took hold of them hard--I put them in the forefront. I made them\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"To move the furniture?"\r\n\r\n"To help, and to help so as to please me. That was the way to take them;\r\nit was what they had least expected. I marched up to them and looked\r\neach straight in the eye, giving him the chance to choose if he\'d\r\ngratify me or gratify my son. He gratified _me_. They were too stupid!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth massed herself there more and more as an immoral woman, but\r\nFleda had to recognize that she too would have been stupid and she too\r\nwould have gratified her. "And when did all this take place?"\r\n\r\n"Only last week; it seems a hundred years. We\'ve worked here as fast as\r\nwe worked there, but I\'m not settled yet: you\'ll see in the rest of the\r\nhouse. However, the worst is over."\r\n\r\n"Do you really think so?" Fleda presently inquired. "I mean, does he,\r\nafter the fact, as it were, accept it?"\r\n\r\n"Owen--what I\'ve done? I haven\'t the least idea," said Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\n"Does Mona?"\r\n\r\n"You mean that she\'ll be the soul of the row?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly see Mona as the \'soul\' of anything," the girl replied. "But\r\nhave they made no sound? Have you heard nothing at all?"\r\n\r\n"Not a whisper, not a step, in all the eight days. Perhaps they don\'t\r\nknow. Perhaps they\'re crouching for a leap."\r\n\r\n"But wouldn\'t they have gone down as soon as you left?"\r\n\r\n"They may not have known of my leaving." Fleda wondered afresh; it\r\nstruck her as scarcely supposable that some sign shouldn\'t have flashed\r\nfrom Poynton to London. If the storm was taking this term of silence to\r\ngather, even in Mona\'s breast, it would probably discharge itself in\r\nsome startling form. The great hush of every one concerned was strange;\r\nbut when she pressed Mrs. Gereth for some explanation of it, that lady\r\nonly replied, with her brave irony: "Oh, I took their breath away!" She\r\nhad no illusions, however; she was still prepared to fight. What indeed\r\nwas her spoliation of Poynton but the first engagement of a campaign?\r\n\r\nAll this was exciting, but Fleda\'s spirit dropped, at bedtime, in the\r\nchamber embellished for her pleasure, where she found several of the\r\nobjects that in her earlier room she had most admired. These had been\r\nreinforced by other pieces from other rooms, so that the quiet air of it\r\nwas a harmony without a break, the finished picture of a maiden\'s bower.\r\nIt was the sweetest Louis Seize, all assorted and combined--old\r\nchastened, figured, faded France. Fleda was impressed anew with her\r\nfriend\'s genius for composition. She could say to herself that no girl\r\nin England, that night, went to rest with so picked a guard; but there\r\nwas no joy for her in her privilege, no sleep even for the tired hours\r\nthat made the place, in the embers of the fire and the winter dawn, look\r\ngray, somehow, and loveless. She couldn\'t care for such things when they\r\ncame to her in such ways; there was a wrong about them all that turned\r\nthem to ugliness. In the watches of the night she saw Poynton\r\ndishonored; she had cared for it as a happy whole, she reasoned, and the\r\nparts of it now around her seemed to suffer like chopped limbs. Before\r\ngoing to bed she had walked about with Mrs. Gereth and seen at whose\r\nexpense the whole house had been furnished. At poor Owen\'s, from top to\r\nbottom--there wasn\'t a chair he hadn\'t sat upon. The maiden aunt had\r\nbeen exterminated--no trace of her to tell her tale. Fleda tried to\r\nthink of some of the things at Poynton still unappropriated, but her\r\nmemory was a blank about them, and in trying to focus the old\r\ncombinations she saw again nothing but gaps and scars, a vacancy that\r\ngathered at moments into something worse. This concrete image was her\r\ngreatest trouble, for it was Owen Gereth\'s face, his sad, strange eyes,\r\nfixed upon her now as they had never been. They stared at her out of the\r\ndarkness, and their expression was more than she could bear: it seemed\r\nto say that he was in pain and that it was somehow her fault. He had\r\nlooked to her to help him, and this was what her help had been. He had\r\ndone her the honor to ask her to exert herself in his interest,\r\nconfiding to her a task of difficulty, but of the highest delicacy.\r\nHadn\'t that been exactly the sort of service she longed to render him?\r\nWell, her way of rendering it had been simply to betray him and hand him\r\nover to his enemy. Shame, pity, resentment oppressed her in turn; in the\r\nlast of these feelings the others were quickly submerged. Mrs. Gereth\r\nhad imprisoned her in that torment of taste; but it was clear to her for\r\nan hour at least that she might hate Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\nSomething else, however, when morning came, was even more intensely\r\ndefinite: the most odious thing in the world for her would be ever again\r\nto meet Owen. She took on the spot a resolve to neglect no precaution\r\nthat could lead to her going through life without that accident. After\r\nthis, while she dressed, she took still another. Her position had\r\nbecome, in a few hours, intolerably false; in as few more hours as\r\npossible she would therefore put an end to it. The way to put an end to\r\nit would be to inform Mrs. Gereth that, to her great regret, she\r\ncouldn\'t be with her now, couldn\'t cleave to her to the point that\r\neverything about her so plainly urged. She dressed with a sort of\r\nviolence, a symbol of the manner in which this purpose was precipitated.\r\nThe more they parted company the less likely she was to come across\r\nOwen; for Owen would be drawn closer to his mother now by the very\r\nnecessity of bringing her down. Fleda, in the inconsequence of distress,\r\nwished to have nothing to do with her fall; she had had too much to do\r\nwith everything. She was well aware of the importance, before breakfast\r\nand in view of any light they might shed on the question of motive, of\r\nnot suffering her invidious expression of a difference to be accompanied\r\nby the traces of tears; but it none the less came to pass, downstairs,\r\nthat after she had subtly put her back to the window, to make a mystery\r\nof the state of her eyes, she stupidly let a rich sob escape her before\r\nshe could properly meet the consequences of being asked if she wasn\'t\r\ndelighted with her room. This accident struck her on the spot as so\r\ngrave that she felt the only refuge to be instant hypocrisy, some\r\ngraceful impulse that would charge her emotion to the quickened sense of\r\nher friend\'s generosity--a demonstration entailing a flutter round the\r\ntable and a renewed embrace, and not so successfully improvised but that\r\nFleda fancied Mrs. Gereth to have been only half reassured. She had been\r\nstartled, at any rate, and she might remain suspicious: this reflection\r\ninterposed by the time, after breakfast, the girl had recovered\r\nsufficiently to say what was in her heart. She accordingly didn\'t say it\r\nthat morning at all: she had absurdly veered about; she had encountered\r\nthe shock of the fear that Mrs. Gereth, with sharpened eyes, might\r\nwonder why the deuce (she often wondered in that phrase) she had grown\r\nso warm about Owen\'s rights. She would doubtless, at a pinch, be able to\r\ndefend them on abstract grounds, but that would involve a discussion,\r\nand the idea of a discussion made her nervous for her secret. Until in\r\nsome way Poynton should return the blow and give her a cue, she must\r\nkeep nervousness down; and she called herself a fool for having\r\nforgotten, however briefly, that her one safety was in silence.\r\n\r\nDirectly after luncheon Mrs. Gereth took her into the garden for a\r\nglimpse of the revolution--or at least, said the mistress of Ricks, of\r\nthe great row--that had been decreed there; but the ladies had scarcely\r\nplaced themselves for this view before the younger one found herself\r\nembracing a prospect that opened in quite another quarter. Her attention\r\nwas called to it, oddly, by the streamers of the parlor-maid\'s cap,\r\nwhich, flying straight behind the neat young woman who unexpectedly\r\nburst from the house and showed a long red face as she ambled over the\r\ngrass, seemed to articulate in their flutter the name that Fleda lived\r\nat present only to catch. "Poynton--Poynton!" said the morsels of\r\nmuslin; so that the parlor-maid became on the instant an actress in the\r\ndrama, and Fleda, assuming pusillanimously that she herself was only a\r\nspectator, looked across the footlights at the exponent of the principal\r\npart. The manner in which this artist returned her look showed that she\r\nwas equally preoccupied. Both were haunted alike by possibilities, but\r\nthe apprehension of neither, before the announcement was made, took the\r\nform of the arrival at Ricks, in the flesh, of Mrs. Gereth\'s victim.\r\nWhen the messenger informed them that Mr. Gereth was in the\r\ndrawing-room, the blank "Oh!" emitted by Fleda was quite as precipitate\r\nas the sound on her hostess\'s lips, besides being, as she felt, much\r\nless pertinent. "I thought it would be somebody," that lady afterwards\r\nsaid; "but I expected on the whole a solicitor\'s clerk." Fleda didn\'t\r\nmention that she herself had expected on the whole a pair of constables.\r\nShe was surprised by Mrs. Gereth\'s question to the parlor-maid.\r\n\r\n"For whom did he ask?"\r\n\r\n"Why, for _you_, of course, dearest friend!" Fleda interjected, falling\r\ninstinctively into the address that embodied the intensest pressure. She\r\nwanted to put Mrs. Gereth between her and her danger.\r\n\r\n"He asked for Miss Vetch, mum," the girl replied, with a face that\r\nbrought startlingly to Fleda\'s ear the muffled chorus of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Quite proper," said Mrs. Gereth austerely. Then to Fleda: "Please go to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"But what to do?"\r\n\r\n"What you always do--to see what he wants." Mrs. Gereth dismissed the\r\nmaid. "Tell him Miss Vetch will come." Fleda saw that nothing was in the\r\nmother\'s imagination at this moment but the desire not to meet her son.\r\nShe had completely broken with him, and there was little in what had\r\njust happened to repair the rupture. It would now take more to do so\r\nthan his presenting himself uninvited at her door. "He\'s right in asking\r\nfor you--he\'s aware that you\'re still our communicator; nothing has\r\noccurred to alter that. To what he wishes to transmit through you I\'m\r\nready, as I\'ve been ready before, to listen. As far as _I_\'m concerned,\r\nif I couldn\'t meet him a month ago, how am I to meet him to-day? If he\r\nhas come to say, \'My dear mother, you\'re here, in the hovel into which\r\nI\'ve flung you, with consolations that give me pleasure,\' I\'ll listen to\r\nhim; but on no other footing. That\'s what you\'re to ascertain, please.\r\nYou\'ll oblige me as you\'ve obliged me before. There!" Mrs. Gereth turned\r\nher back and, with a fine imitation of superiority, began to redress the\r\nmiseries immediately before her. Fleda meanwhile hesitated, lingered for\r\nsome minutes where she had been left, feeling secretly that her fate\r\nstill had her in hand. It had put her face to face with Owen Gereth, and\r\nit evidently meant to keep her so. She was reminded afresh of two\r\nthings: one of which was that, though she judged her friend\'s rigor, she\r\nhad never really had the story of the scene enacted in the great\r\nawestricken house between the mother and the son weeks before--the day\r\nthe former took to her bed in her over-throw; the other was, that at\r\nRicks as at Poynton, it was before all things her place to accept\r\nthankfully a usefulness not, she must remember, universally\r\nacknowledged. What determined her at the last, while Mrs. Gereth\r\ndisappeared in the shrubbery, was that, though she was at a distance\r\nfrom the house and the drawing-room was turned the other way, she could\r\nabsolutely see the young man alone there with the sources of his pain.\r\nShe saw his simple stare at his tapestries, heard his heavy tread on his\r\ncarpets and the hard breath of his sense of unfairness. At this she went\r\nto him fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n"I asked for you," he said when she stood there, "because I heard from\r\nthe flyman who drove me from the station to the inn that he had brought\r\nyou here yesterday. We had some talk, and he mentioned it."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t know I was here?"\r\n\r\n"No. I knew only that you had had, in London, all that you told me, that\r\nday, to do; and it was Mona\'s idea that after your sister\'s marriage you\r\nwere staying on with your father. So I thought you were with him still."\r\n\r\n"I am," Fleda replied, idealizing a little the fact. "I\'m here only for\r\na moment. But do you mean," she went on, "that if you had known I was\r\nwith your mother you wouldn\'t have come down?"\r\n\r\nThe way Owen hung fire at this question made it sound more playful than\r\nshe had intended. She had, in fact, no consciousness of any intention\r\nbut that of confining herself rigidly to her function. She could already\r\nsee that, in whatever he had now braced himself for, she was an element\r\nhe had not reckoned with. His preparation had been of a different\r\nsort--the sort congruous with his having been careful to go first and\r\nlunch solidly at the inn. He had not been forced to ask for her, but she\r\nbecame aware, in his presence, of a particular desire to make him feel\r\nthat no harm could really come to him. She might upset him, as people\r\ncalled it, but she would take no advantage of having done so. She had\r\nnever seen a person with whom she wished more to be light and easy, to\r\nbe exceptionally human. The account he presently gave of the matter was\r\nthat he indeed wouldn\'t have come if he had known she was on the spot;\r\nbecause then, didn\'t she see? he could have written to her. He would\r\nhave had her there to let fly at his mother.\r\n\r\n"That would have saved me--well, it would have saved me a lot. Of course\r\nI would rather see you than her," he somewhat awkwardly added. "When the\r\nfellow spoke of you, I assure you I quite jumped at you. In fact I\'ve no\r\nreal desire to see Mummy at all. If she thinks I _like_ it--!" He sighed\r\ndisgustedly. "I only came down because it seemed better than any other\r\nway. I didn\'t want her to be able to say I hadn\'t been all right. I dare\r\nsay you know she has taken everything; or if not quite everything, why,\r\na lot more than one ever dreamed. You can see for yourself--she has got\r\nhalf the place down. She has got them crammed--you can see for\r\nyourself!" He had his old trick of artless repetition, his helpless\r\niteration of the obvious; but he was sensibly different, for Fleda, if\r\nonly by the difference of his clear face, mottled over and almost\r\ndisfigured by little points of pain. He might have been a fine young man\r\nwith a bad toothache; with the first even of his life. What ailed him\r\nabove all, she felt, was that trouble was new to him: he had never known\r\na difficulty; he had taken all his fences, his world wholly the world of\r\nthe personally possible, rounded indeed by a gray suburb into which he\r\nhad never had occasion to stray. In this vulgar and ill-lighted region\r\nhe had evidently now lost himself. "We left it quite to her honor, you\r\nknow," he said ruefully.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you\'ve a right to say that you left it a little to mine." Mixed\r\nup with the spoils there, rising before him as if she were in a manner\r\ntheir keeper, she felt that she must absolutely dissociate herself. Mrs.\r\nGereth had made it impossible to do anything but give her away. "I can\r\nonly tell you that, on my side, I left it to her. I never dreamed either\r\nthat she would pick out so many things."\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t really think it\'s fair, do you? You _don\'t_!" He spoke\r\nvery quickly; he really seemed to plead.\r\n\r\nFleda faltered a moment. "I think she has gone too far." Then she added:\r\n"I shall immediately tell her that I\'ve said that to you."\r\n\r\nHe appeared puzzled by this statement, but he presently rejoined: "You\r\nhaven\'t then said to mamma what you think?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet; remember that I only got here last night." She appeared to\r\nherself ignobly weak. "I had had no idea what she was doing; I was taken\r\ncompletely by surprise. She managed it wonderfully."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the sharpest thing I ever saw in _my_ life!" They looked at each\r\nother with intelligence, in appreciation of the sharpness, and Owen\r\nquickly broke into a loud laugh. The laugh was in itself natural, but\r\nthe occasion of it strange; and stranger still, to Fleda, so that she\r\ntoo almost laughed, the inconsequent charity with which he added: "Poor\r\ndear old Mummy! That\'s one of the reasons I asked for you," he went\r\non--"to see if you\'d back her up."\r\n\r\nWhatever he said or did, she somehow liked him the better for it. "How\r\ncan I back her up, Mr. Gereth, when I think, as I tell you, that she has\r\nmade a great mistake?"\r\n\r\n"A great mistake! That\'s all right." He spoke--it wasn\'t clear to her\r\nwhy--as if this declaration were a great point gained.\r\n\r\n"Of course there are many things she hasn\'t taken," Fleda continued.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, a lot of things. But you wouldn\'t know the place, all the\r\nsame." He looked about the room with his discolored, swindled face,\r\nwhich deepened Fleda\'s compassion for him, conjuring away any smile at\r\nso candid an image of the dupe. "You\'d know this one soon enough,\r\nwouldn\'t you? These are just the things she ought to have left. Is the\r\nwhole house full of them?"\r\n\r\n"The whole house," said Fleda uncompromisingly. She thought of her\r\nlovely room.\r\n\r\n"I never knew how much I cared for them. They\'re awfully valuable,\r\naren\'t they?" Owen\'s manner mystified her; she was conscious of a return\r\nof the agitation he had produced in her on that last bewildering day,\r\nand she reminded herself that, now she was warned, it would be\r\ninexcusable of her to allow him to justify the fear that had dropped on\r\nher. "Mother thinks I never took any notice, but I assure you I was\r\nawfully proud of everything. Upon my honor, I _was_ proud, Miss Vetch."\r\n\r\nThere was an oddity in his helplessness; he appeared to wish to persuade\r\nher and to satisfy himself that she sincerely felt how worthy he really\r\nwas to treat what had happened as an injury. She could only exclaim,\r\nalmost as helplessly as himself: "Of course you did justice! It\'s all\r\nmost painful. I shall instantly let your mother know," she again\r\ndeclared, "the way I\'ve spoken of her to you." She clung to that idea as\r\nto the sign of her straightness.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll tell her what you think she ought to do?" he asked with some\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\n"What she ought to do?"\r\n\r\n"_Don\'t_ you think it--I mean that she ought to give them up?"\r\n\r\n"To give them up?" Fleda hesitated again.\r\n\r\n"To send them back--to keep it quiet." The girl had not felt the impulse\r\nto ask him to sit down among the monuments of his wrong, so that,\r\nnervously, awkwardly, he fidgeted about the room with his hands in his\r\npockets and an effect of returning a little into possession through the\r\nformulation of his view. "To have them packed and dispatched again,\r\nsince she knows so well how. She does it beautifully"--he looked close\r\nat two or three precious pieces. "What\'s sauce for the goose is sauce\r\nfor the gander!"\r\n\r\nHe had laughed at his way of putting it, but Fleda remained grave. "Is\r\nthat what you came to say to her?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly those words. But I did come to say"--he stammered, then\r\nbrought it out--"I did come to say we must have them right back."\r\n\r\n"And did you think your mother would see you?"\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t sure, but I thought it right to try--to put it to her kindly,\r\ndon\'t you see? If she won\'t see me, then she has herself to thank. The\r\nonly other way would have been to set the lawyers at her."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you didn\'t do that."\r\n\r\n"I\'m dashed if I want to!" Owen honestly declared. "But what\'s a fellow\r\nto do if she won\'t meet a fellow?"\r\n\r\n"What do you call meeting a fellow?" Fleda asked, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Why, letting _me_ tell her a dozen things she can have."\r\n\r\nThis was a transaction that Fleda, after a moment, had to give up trying\r\nto represent to herself. "If she won\'t do that--?" she went on.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave it all to my solicitor. _He_ won\'t let her off: by Jove, I\r\nknow the fellow!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s horrible!" said Fleda, looking at him in woe.\r\n\r\n"It\'s utterly beastly!"\r\n\r\nHis want of logic as well as his vehemence startled her; and with her\r\neyes still on his she considered before asking him the question these\r\nthings suggested. At last she asked it. "Is Mona very angry?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes!" said Owen.\r\n\r\nShe had perceived that he wouldn\'t speak of Mona without her beginning.\r\nAfter waiting fruitlessly now for him to say more, she continued: "She\r\nhas been there again? She has seen the state of the house?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes!" Owen repeated.\r\n\r\nFleda disliked to appear not to take account of his brevity, but it was\r\njust because she was struck by it that she felt the pressure of the\r\ndesire to know more. What it suggested was simply what her intelligence\r\nsupplied, for he was incapable of any art of insinuation. Wasn\'t it at\r\nall events the rule of communication with him to say for him what he\r\ncouldn\'t say? This truth was present to the girl as she inquired if Mona\r\ngreatly resented what Mrs. Gereth had done. He satisfied her promptly;\r\nhe was standing before the fire, his back to it, his long legs apart,\r\nhis hands, behind him, rather violently jiggling his gloves. "She hates\r\nit awfully. In fact, she refuses to put up with it at all. Don\'t you\r\nsee?--she saw the place with all the things."\r\n\r\n"So that of course she misses them."\r\n\r\n"Misses them--rather! She was awfully sweet on them." Fleda remembered\r\nhow sweet Mona had been, and reflected that if that was the sort of plea\r\nhe had prepared it was indeed as well he shouldn\'t see his mother. This\r\nwas not all she wanted to know, but it came over her that it was all she\r\nneeded. "You see it puts me in the position of not carrying out what I\r\npromised," Owen said. "As she says herself"--he hesitated an\r\ninstant--"it\'s just as if I had obtained her under false pretenses."\r\nJust before, when he spoke with more drollery than he knew, it had left\r\nFleda serious; but now his own clear gravity had the effect of exciting\r\nher mirth. She laughed out, and he looked surprised, but went on: "She\r\nregards it as a regular sell."\r\n\r\nFleda was silent; but finally, as he added nothing, she exclaimed: "Of\r\ncourse it makes a great difference!" She knew all she needed, but none\r\nthe less she risked, after another pause, an interrogative remark. "I\r\nforget when it is that your marriage takes place?"\r\n\r\nOwen came away from the fire and, apparently at a loss where to turn,\r\nended by directing himself to one of the windows. "It\'s a little\r\nuncertain; the date isn\'t quite fixed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thought I remembered that at Poynton you had told me a day, and\r\nthat it was near at hand."\r\n\r\n"I dare say I did; it was for the 19th. But we\'ve altered that--she\r\nwants to shift it." He looked out of the window; then he said: "In fact,\r\nit won\'t come off till Mummy has come round."\r\n\r\n"Come round?"\r\n\r\n"Put the place as it was." In his offhand way he added: "You know what I\r\nmean!"\r\n\r\nHe spoke not impatiently, but with a kind of intimate familiarity, the\r\nsweetness of which made her feel a pang for having forced him to tell\r\nher what was embarrassing to him, what was even humiliating. Yes indeed,\r\nshe knew all she needed: all she needed was that Mona had proved apt at\r\nputting down that wonderful patent-leather foot. Her type was misleading\r\nonly to the superficial, and no one in the world was less superficial\r\nthan Fleda. She had guessed the truth at Waterbath and she had suffered\r\nfrom it at Poynton; at Ricks the only thing she could do was to accept\r\nit with the dumb exaltation that she felt rising. Mona had been prompt\r\nwith her exercise of the member in question, for it might be called\r\nprompt to do that sort of thing before marriage. That she had indeed\r\nbeen premature who should say save those who should have read the matter\r\nin the full light of results? Neither at Waterbath nor at Poynton had\r\neven Fleda\'s thoroughness discovered all that there was--or rather, all\r\nthat there was not--in Owen Gereth. "Of course it makes all the\r\ndifference!" she said in answer to his last words. She pursued, after\r\nconsidering: "What you wish me to say from you then to your mother is\r\nthat you demand immediate and practically complete restitution?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, please. It\'s tremendously good of you."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then. Will you wait?"\r\n\r\n"For Mummy\'s answer?" Owen stared and looked perplexed; he was more and\r\nmore fevered with so much vivid expression of his case. "Don\'t you think\r\nthat if I\'m here she may hate it worse--think I may want to make her\r\nreply bang off?"\r\n\r\nFleda thought. "You don\'t, then?"\r\n\r\n"I want to take her in the right way, don\'t you know?--treat her as if I\r\ngave her more than just an hour or two."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Fleda. "Then, if you don\'t wait--good-bye."\r\n\r\nThis again seemed not what he wanted. "Must _you_ do it bang off?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m only thinking she\'ll be impatient--I mean, you know, to learn what\r\nwill have passed between us."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Owen, looking at his gloves. "I can give her a day or two,\r\nyou know. Of course I didn\'t come down to sleep," he went on. "The inn\r\nseems a horrid hole. I know all about the trains--having no idea you\r\nwere here." Almost as soon as his interlocutress he was struck with the\r\nabsence of the visible, in this, as between effect and cause. "I mean\r\nbecause in that case I should have felt I could stop over. I should have\r\nfelt I could talk with you a blessed sight longer than with Mummy."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve already talked a long time," smiled Fleda.\r\n\r\n"Awfully, haven\'t we?" He spoke with the stupidity she didn\'t object to.\r\nInarticulate as he was, he had more to say; he lingered perhaps because\r\nhe was vaguely aware of the want of sincerity in her encouragement to\r\nhim to go. "There\'s one thing, please," he mentioned, as if there might\r\nbe a great many others too. "Please don\'t say anything about Mona."\r\n\r\nShe didn\'t understand. "About Mona?"\r\n\r\n"About its being _her_ that thinks she has gone too far." This was still\r\nslightly obscure, but now Fleda understood. "It mustn\'t seem to come\r\nfrom _her_ at all, don\'t you know? That would only make Mummy worse."\r\n\r\nFleda knew exactly how much worse, but she felt a delicacy about\r\nexplicitly assenting: she was already immersed moreover in the deep\r\nconsideration of what might make "Mummy" better. She couldn\'t see as yet\r\nat all; she could only clutch at the hope of some inspiration after he\r\nshould go. Oh, there was a remedy, to be sure, but it was out of the\r\nquestion; in spite of which, in the strong light of Owen\'s troubled\r\npresence, of his anxious face and restless step, it hung there before\r\nher for some minutes. She felt that, remarkably, beneath the decent\r\nrigor of his errand, the poor young man, for reasons, for weariness, for\r\ndisgust, would have been ready not to insist. His fitness to fight his\r\nmother had left him--he wasn\'t in fighting trim. He had no natural\r\navidity and even no special wrath; he had none that had not been taught\r\nhim, and it was doing his best to learn the lesson that had made him so\r\nsick. He had his delicacies, but he hid them away like presents before\r\nChristmas. He was hollow, perfunctory, pathetic; he had been girded by\r\nanother hand. That hand had naturally been Mona\'s, and it was heavy even\r\nnow on his strong, broad back. Why then had he originally rejoiced so in\r\nits touch? Fleda dashed aside this question, for it had nothing to do\r\nwith her problem. Her problem was to help him to live as a gentleman and\r\ncarry through what he had undertaken; her problem was to reinstate him\r\nin his rights. It was quite irrelevant that Mona had no intelligence of\r\nwhat she had lost--quite irrelevant that she was moved not by the\r\nprivation, but by the insult: she had every reason to be moved, though\r\nshe was so much more movable, in the vindictive way, at any rate, than\r\none might have supposed--assuredly more than Owen himself had imagined.\r\n\r\n"Certainly I shall not mention Mona," Fleda said, "and there won\'t be\r\nthe slightest necessity for it. The wrong\'s quite sufficiently yours,\r\nand the demand you make is perfectly justified by it."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you what it is to me to feel you on my side!" Owen\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Up to this time," said Fleda, after a pause, "your mother has had no\r\ndoubt of my being on hers."\r\n\r\n"Then of course she won\'t like your changing."\r\n\r\n"I dare say she won\'t like it at all."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say you\'ll have a regular kick-up with her?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t exactly know what you mean by a regular kick-up. We shall\r\nnaturally have a great deal of discussion--if she consents to discuss\r\nthe matter at all. That\'s why you must decidedly give her two or three\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"I see you think she _may_ refuse to discuss it at all," said Owen.\r\n\r\n"I\'m only trying to be prepared for the worst. You must remember that to\r\nhave to withdraw from the ground she has taken, to make a public\r\nsurrender of what she has publicly appropriated, will go uncommonly hard\r\nwith her pride."\r\n\r\nOwen considered; his face seemed to broaden, but not into a smile. "I\r\nsuppose she\'s tremendously proud, isn\'t she?" This might have been the\r\nfirst time it had occurred to him.\r\n\r\n"You know better than I," said Fleda, speaking with high extravagance.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything in the world half so well as you. If I were as\r\nclever as you I might hope to get round her." Owen hesitated; then he\r\nwent on: "In fact I don\'t quite see what even you can say or do that\r\nwill really fetch her."\r\n\r\n"Neither do I, as yet. I must think--I must pray!" the girl pursued,\r\nsmiling. "I can only say to you that I\'ll try. I _want_ to try, you\r\nknow--I want to help you." He stood looking at her so long on this that\r\nshe added with much distinctness: "So you must leave me, please, quite\r\nalone with her. You must go straight back."\r\n\r\n"Back to the inn?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, back to town. I\'ll write to you to-morrow."\r\n\r\nHe turned about vaguely for his hat.\r\n\r\n"There\'s the chance, of course, that she may be afraid."\r\n\r\n"Afraid, you mean, of the legal steps you may take?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a perfect case--I could have her up. The Brigstocks say it\'s\r\nsimple stealing."\r\n\r\n"I can easily fancy what the Brigstocks say!" Fleda permitted herself to\r\nremark without solemnity.\r\n\r\n"It\'s none of their business, is it?" was Owen\'s unexpected rejoinder.\r\nFleda had already noted that no one so slow could ever have had such\r\nrapid transitions.\r\n\r\nShe showed her amusement. "They\'ve a much better right to say it\'s none\r\nof mine."\r\n\r\n"Well, at any rate, you don\'t call her names."\r\n\r\nFleda wondered whether Mona did; and this made it all the finer of her\r\nto exclaim in a moment: "You don\'t know what I shall call her if she\r\nholds out!"\r\n\r\nOwen gave her a gloomy glance; then he blew a speck off the crown of his\r\nhat. "But if you do have a set-to with her?"\r\n\r\nHe paused so long for a reply that Fleda said: "I don\'t think I know\r\nwhat you mean by a set-to."\r\n\r\n"Well, if she calls _you_ names."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she\'ll do that."\r\n\r\n"What I mean to say is, if she\'s angry at your backing me up--what will\r\nyou do then? She can\'t possibly like it, you know."\r\n\r\n"She may very well not like it; but everything depends. I must see what\r\nI shall do. You mustn\'t worry about me."\r\n\r\nShe spoke with decision, but Owen seemed still unsatisfied. "You won\'t\r\ngo away, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"Go away?"\r\n\r\n"If she does take it ill of you."\r\n\r\nFleda moved to the door and opened it. "I\'m not prepared to say. You\r\nmust have patience and see."\r\n\r\n"Of course I must," said Owen--"of course, of course." But he took no\r\nmore advantage of the open door than to say: "You want me to be off, and\r\nI\'m off in a minute. Only, before I go, please answer me a question. If\r\nyou _should_ leave my mother, where would you go?"\r\n\r\nFleda smiled again. "I haven\'t the least idea."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'d go back to London."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the least idea," Fleda repeated.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t--a--live anywhere in particular, do you?" the young man went\r\non. He looked conscious as soon as he had spoken; she could see that he\r\nfelt himself to have alluded more grossly than he meant to the\r\ncircumstance of her having, if one were plain about it, no home of her\r\nown. He had meant it as an allusion of a tender sort to all that she\r\nwould sacrifice in the case of a quarrel with his mother; but there was\r\nindeed no graceful way of touching on that. One just couldn\'t be plain\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nFleda, wound up as she was, shrank from any treatment at all of the\r\nmatter, and she made no answer to his question. "I _won\'t_ leave your\r\nmother," she said. "I\'ll produce an effect on her; I\'ll convince her\r\nabsolutely."\r\n\r\n"I believe you will, if you look at her like that!"\r\n\r\nShe was wound up to such a height that there might well be a light in\r\nher pale, fine little face--a light that, while, for all return, at\r\nfirst, she simply shone back at him, was intensely reflected in his own.\r\n"I\'ll make her see it--I\'ll make her see it!" She rang out like a silver\r\nbell. She had at that moment a perfect faith that she should succeed;\r\nbut it passed into something else when, the next instant, she became\r\naware that Owen, quickly getting between her and the door she had\r\nopened, was sharply closing it, as might be said, in her face. He had\r\ndone this before she could stop him, and he stood there with his hand on\r\nthe knob and smiled at her strangely. Clearer than he could have spoken\r\nit was the sense of those seconds of silence.\r\n\r\n"When I got into this I didn\'t know you, and now that I know you how can\r\nI tell you the difference? And _she_\'s so different, so ugly and vulgar,\r\nin the light of this squabble. No, like _you_ I\'ve never known one. It\'s\r\nanother thing, it\'s a new thing altogether. Listen to me a little: can\'t\r\nsomething be done?" It was what had been in the air in those moments at\r\nKensington, and it only wanted words to be a committed act. The more\r\nreason, to the girl\'s excited mind, why it shouldn\'t have words; her one\r\nthought was not to hear, to keep the act uncommitted. She would do this\r\nif she had to be horrid.\r\n\r\n"Please let me out, Mr. Gereth," she said; on which he opened the door\r\nwith an hesitation so very brief that in thinking of these things\r\nafterwards--for she was to think of them forever--she wondered in what\r\ntone she could have spoken. They went into the hall, where she\r\nencountered the parlor-maid, of whom she inquired whether Mrs. Gereth\r\nhad come in.\r\n\r\n"No, miss; and I think she has left the garden. She has gone up the back\r\nroad." In other words, they had the whole place to themselves. It would\r\nhave been a pleasure, in a different mood, to converse with that\r\nparlor-maid.\r\n\r\n"Please open the house-door," said Fleda.\r\n\r\nOwen, as if in quest of his umbrella, looked vaguely about the\r\nhall--looked even wistfully up the staircase--while the neat young woman\r\ncomplied with Fleda\'s request. Owen\'s eyes then wandered out of the open\r\ndoor. "I think it\'s awfully nice here," he observed; "I assure you I\r\ncould do with it myself."\r\n\r\n"I should think you might, with half your things here! It\'s Poynton\r\nitself--almost. Good-bye, Mr. Gereth," Fleda added. Her intention had\r\nnaturally been that the neat young woman, opening the front door, should\r\nremain to close it on the departing guest. That functionary, however,\r\nhad acutely vanished behind a stiff flap of green baize which Mrs.\r\nGereth had not yet had time to abolish. Fleda put out her hand, but Owen\r\nturned away--he couldn\'t find his umbrella. She passed into the open\r\nair--she was determined to get him out; and in a moment he joined her in\r\nthe little plastered portico which had small resemblance to any feature\r\nof Poynton. It was, as Mrs. Gereth had said, like the portico of a house\r\nin Brompton.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t mean with all the things here," he explained in regard to\r\nthe opinion he had just expressed. "I mean I could put up with it just\r\nas it was; it had a lot of good things, don\'t you think? I mean if\r\neverything was back at Poynton, if everything was all right." He brought\r\nout these last words with a sort of smothered sigh. Fleda didn\'t\r\nunderstand his explanation unless it had reference to another and more\r\nwonderful exchange--the restoration to the great house not only of its\r\ntables and chairs, but of its alienated mistress. This would imply the\r\ninstallation of his own life at Ricks, and obviously that of another\r\nperson. Such another person could scarcely be Mona Brigstock. He put out\r\nhis hand now; and once more she heard his unsounded words: "With\r\neverything patched up at the other place, I could live here with _you_.\r\nDon\'t you see what I mean?"\r\n\r\nFleda saw perfectly, and, with a face in which she flattered herself\r\nthat nothing of this vision appeared, gave him her hand and said:\r\n"Good-bye, good-bye."\r\n\r\nOwen held her hand very firmly and kept it even after an effort made by\r\nher to recover it--an effort not repeated, as she felt it best not to\r\nshow she was flurried. That solution--of her living with him at\r\nRicks--disposed of him beautifully, and disposed not less so of herself;\r\nit disposed admirably too of Mrs. Gereth. Fleda could only vainly wonder\r\nhow it provided for poor Mona. While he looked at her, grasping her\r\nhand, she felt that now indeed she was paying for his mother\'s\r\nextravagance at Poynton--the vividness of that lady\'s public plea that\r\nlittle Fleda Vetch was the person to insure the general peace. It was to\r\nthat vividness poor Owen had come back, and if Mrs. Gereth had had more\r\ndiscretion little Fleda Vetch wouldn\'t have been in a predicament. She\r\nsaw that Owen had at this moment his sharpest necessity of speech, and\r\nso long as he didn\'t release her hand she could only submit to him. Her\r\ndefense would be perhaps to look blank and hard; so she looked as blank\r\nand as hard as she could, with the reward of an immediate sense that\r\nthis was not a bit what he wanted. It even made him hang fire, as if he\r\nwere suddenly ashamed of himself, were recalled to some idea of duty and\r\nof honor. Yet he none the less brought it out. "There\'s one thing I dare\r\nsay I ought to tell you, if you\'re going so kindly to act for me; though\r\nof course you\'ll see for yourself it\'s a thing it won\'t do to tell\r\n_her_." What was it? He made her wait for it again, and while she\r\nwaited, under firm coercion, she had the extraordinary impression that\r\nOwen\'s simplicity was in eclipse. His natural honesty was like the scent\r\nof a flower, and she felt at this moment as if her nose had been brushed\r\nby the bloom without the odor. The allusion was undoubtedly to his\r\nmother; and was not what he meant about the matter in question the\r\nopposite of what he said--that it just _would_ do to tell her? It would\r\nhave been the first time he had said the opposite of what he meant, and\r\nthere was certainly a fascination in the phenomenon, as well as a\r\nchallenge to suspense in the ambiguity. "It\'s just that I understand\r\nfrom Mona, you know," he stammered; "it\'s just that she has made no\r\nbones about bringing home to me--" He tried to laugh, and in the effort\r\nhe faltered again.\r\n\r\n"About bringing home to you?"--Fleda encouraged him.\r\n\r\nHe was sensible of it, he achieved his performance. "Why, that if I\r\ndon\'t get the things back--every blessed one of them except a few\r\n_she_\'ll pick out--she won\'t have anything more to say to me."\r\n\r\nFleda, after an instant, encouraged him again. "To say to you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, she simply won\'t marry me, don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\nOwen\'s legs, not to mention his voice, had wavered while he spoke, and\r\nshe felt his possession of her hand loosen so that she was free again.\r\nHer stare of perception broke into a lively laugh. "Oh, you\'re all\r\nright, for you _will_ get them. You will; you\'re quite safe; don\'t\r\nworry!" She fell back into the house with her hand on the door.\r\n"Good-bye, good-bye." She repeated it several times, laughing bravely,\r\nquite waving him away and, as he didn\'t move and save that he was on the\r\nother side of it, closing the door in his face quite as he had closed\r\nthat of the drawing-room in hers. Never had a face, never at least had\r\nsuch a handsome one, been so presented to that offense. She even held\r\nthe door a minute, lest he should try to come in again. At last, as she\r\nheard nothing, she made a dash for the stairs and ran up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn knowing a while before all she needed, Fleda had been far from\r\nknowing as much as that; so that once upstairs, where, in her room, with\r\nher sense of danger and trouble, the age of Louis Seize suddenly struck\r\nher as wanting in taste and point, she felt that she now for the first\r\ntime knew her temptation. Owen had put it before her with an art beyond\r\nhis own dream. Mona would cast him off if he didn\'t proceed to\r\nextremities; if his negotiation with his mother should fail he would be\r\ncompletely free. That negotiation depended on a young lady to whom he\r\nhad pressingly suggested the condition of his freedom; and as if to\r\naggravate the young lady\'s predicament designing fate had sent Mrs.\r\nGereth, as the parlor-maid said, "up the back road." This would give the\r\nyoung lady more time to make up her mind that nothing should come of the\r\nnegotiation. There would be different ways of putting the question to\r\nMrs. Gereth, and Fleda might profitably devote the moments before her\r\nreturn to a selection of the way that would most surely be tantamount to\r\nfailure. This selection indeed required no great adroitness; it was so\r\nconspicuous that failure would be the reward of an effective\r\nintroduction of Mona. If that abhorred name should be properly invoked\r\nMrs. Gereth would resist to the death, and before envenomed resistance\r\nOwen would certainly retire. His retirement would be into single life,\r\nand Fleda reflected that he had now gone away conscious of having\r\npractically told her so. She could only say, as she waited for the back\r\nroad to disgorge, that she hoped it was a consciousness he enjoyed.\r\nThere was something _she_ enjoyed; but that was a very different matter.\r\nTo know that she had become to him an object of desire gave her wings\r\nthat she felt herself flutter in the air: it was like the rush of a\r\nflood into her own accumulations. These stored depths had been\r\nfathomless and still, but now, for half an hour, in the empty house,\r\nthey spread till they overflowed. He seemed to have made it right for\r\nher to confess to herself her secret. Strange then there should be for\r\nhim in return nothing that such a confession could make right! How could\r\nit make right that he should give up Mona for another woman? His\r\nattitude was a sorry appeal to Fleda to legitimate that. But he didn\'t\r\nbelieve it himself, and he had none of the courage of his suggestion.\r\nShe could easily see how wrong everything must be when a man so made to\r\nbe manly was wanting in courage. She had upset him, as people called it,\r\nand he had spoken out from the force of the jar of finding her there. He\r\nhad upset her too, heaven knew, but she was one of those who could pick\r\nthemselves up. She had the real advantage, she considered, of having\r\nkept him from seeing that she had been overthrown.\r\n\r\nShe had moreover at present completely recovered her feet, though there\r\nwas in the intensity of the effort required to do so a vibration which\r\nthrobbed away into an immense allowance for the young man. How could she\r\nafter all know what, in the disturbance wrought by his mother, Mona\'s\r\nrelations with him might have become? If he had been able to keep his\r\nwits, such as they were, more about him he would probably have felt--as\r\nsharply as she felt on his behalf--that so long as those relations were\r\nnot ended he had no right to say even the little he had said. He had no\r\nright to appear to wish to draw in another girl to help him to an\r\nescape. If he was in a plight he must get out of the plight himself, he\r\nmust get out of it first, and anything he should have to say to any one\r\nelse must be deferred and detached. She herself, at any rate--it was her\r\nown case that was in question--couldn\'t dream of assisting him save in\r\nthe sense of their common honor. She could never be the girl to be drawn\r\nin, she could never lift her finger against Mona. There was something in\r\nher that would make it a shame to her forever to have owed her happiness\r\nto an interference. It would seem intolerably vulgar to her to have\r\n"ousted" the daughter of the Brigstocks; and merely to have abstained\r\neven wouldn\'t assure her that she had been straight. Nothing was really\r\nstraight but to justify her little pensioned presence by her use; and\r\nnow, won over as she was to heroism, she could see her use only as some\r\nhigh and delicate deed. She couldn\'t do anything at all, in short,\r\nunless she could do it with a kind of pride, and there would be nothing\r\nto be proud of in having arranged for poor Owen to get off easily.\r\nNobody had a right to get off easily from pledges so deep, so sacred.\r\nHow could Fleda doubt they had been tremendous when she knew so well\r\nwhat any pledge of her own would be? If Mona was so formed that she\r\ncould hold such vows light, that was Mona\'s peculiar business. To have\r\nloved Owen apparently, and yet to have loved him only so much, only to\r\nthe extent of a few tables and chairs, was not a thing she could so much\r\nas try to grasp. Of a different way of loving him she was herself ready\r\nto give an instance, an instance of which the beauty indeed would not be\r\ngenerally known. It would not perhaps if revealed be generally\r\nunderstood, inasmuch as the effect of the particular pressure she\r\nproposed to exercise would be, should success attend it, to keep him\r\ntied to an affection that had died a sudden and violent death. Even in\r\nthe ardor of her meditation Fleda remained in sight of the truth that it\r\nwould be an odd result of her magnanimity to prevent her friend\'s\r\nshaking off a woman he disliked. If he didn\'t dislike Mona, what was the\r\nmatter with him? And if he did, Fleda asked, what was the matter with\r\nher own silly self?\r\n\r\nOur young lady met this branch of the temptation it pleased her frankly\r\nto recognize by declaring that to encourage any such cruelty would be\r\ntortuous and base. She had nothing to do with his dislikes; she had only\r\nto do with his good-nature and his good name. She had joy of him just as\r\nhe was, but it was of these things she had the greatest. The worst\r\naversion and the liveliest reaction moreover wouldn\'t alter the\r\nfact--since one was facing facts--that but the other day his strong arms\r\nmust have clasped a remarkably handsome girl as close as she had\r\npermitted. Fleda\'s emotion at this time was a wondrous mixture, in which\r\nMona\'s permissions and Mona\'s beauty figured powerfully as aids to\r\nreflection. She herself had no beauty, and _her_ permissions were the\r\nstony stares she had just practiced in the drawing-room--a consciousness\r\nof a kind appreciably to add to the particular sense of triumph that\r\nmade her generous. I may not perhaps too much diminish the merit of that\r\ngenerosity if I mention that it could take the flight we are considering\r\njust because really, with the telescope of her long thought, Fleda saw\r\nwhat might bring her out of the wood. Mona herself would bring her out;\r\nat the least Mona possibly might. Deep down plunged the idea that even\r\nshould she achieve what she had promised Owen, there was still the\r\ncontingency of Mona\'s independent action. She might by that time, under\r\nstress of temper or of whatever it was that was now moving her, have\r\nsaid or done the things there is no patching up. If the rupture should\r\ncome from Waterbath they might all be happy yet. This was a calculation\r\nthat Fleda wouldn\'t have committed to paper, but it affected the total\r\nof her sentiments. She was meanwhile so remarkably constituted that\r\nwhile she refused to profit by Owen\'s mistake, even while she judged it\r\nand hastened to cover it up, she could drink a sweetness from it that\r\nconsorted little with her wishing it mightn\'t have been made. There was\r\nno harm done, because he had instinctively known, poor dear, with whom\r\nto make it, and it was a compensation for seeing him worried that he\r\nhadn\'t made it with some horrid mean girl who would immediately have\r\ndished him by making a still bigger one. Their protected error (for she\r\nindulged a fancy that it was hers too) was like some dangerous, lovely\r\nliving thing that she had caught and could keep--keep vivid and helpless\r\nin the cage of her own passion and look at and talk to all day long. She\r\nhad got it well locked up there by the time that, from an upper window,\r\nshe saw Mrs. Gereth again in the garden. At this she went down to meet\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nFleda\'s line had been taken, her word was quite ready; on the terrace of\r\nthe painted pots she broke out before her interlocutress could put a\r\nquestion. "His errand was perfectly simple: he came to demand that you\r\nshall pack everything straight up again and send it back as fast as the\r\nrailway will carry it."\r\n\r\nThe back road had apparently been fatiguing to Mrs. Gereth; she rose\r\nthere rather white and wan with her walk. A certain sharp thinness was\r\nin her ejaculation of "Oh!"--after which she glanced about her for a\r\nplace to sit down. The movement was a criticism of the order of events\r\nthat offered such a piece of news to a lady coming in tired; but Fleda\r\ncould see that in turning over the possibilities this particular peril\r\nwas the one that during the last hour her friend had turned up oftenest.\r\nAt the end of the short, gray day, which had been moist and mild, the\r\nsun was out; the terrace looked to the south, and a bench, formed as to\r\nlegs and arms of iron representing knotted boughs, stood against the\r\nwarmest wall of the house. The mistress of Ricks sank upon it and\r\npresented to her companion the handsome face she had composed to hear\r\neverything. Strangely enough, it was just this fine vessel of her\r\nattention that made the girl most nervous about what she must drop in.\r\n"Quite a \'demand,\' dear, is it?" asked Mrs. Gereth, drawing in her\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s what I should call it!" Fleda laughed, to her own surprise.\r\n\r\n"I mean with the threat of enforcement and that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Distinctly with the threat of enforcement--what would be called, I\r\nsuppose, coercion."\r\n\r\n"What sort of coercion?" said Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\n"Why, legal, don\'t you know?--what he calls setting the lawyers at you."\r\n\r\n"Is that what he calls it?" She seemed to speak with disinterested\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what he calls it," said Fleda.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth considered an instant. "Oh, the lawyers!" she exclaimed\r\nlightly. Seated there almost cosily in the reddening winter sunset, only\r\nwith her shoulders raised a little and her mantle tightened as if from a\r\nslight chill, she had never yet looked to Fleda so much in possession\r\nnor so far from meeting unsuspectedness halfway. "Is he going to send\r\nthem down here?"\r\n\r\n"I dare say he thinks it may come to that."\r\n\r\n"The lawyers can scarcely do the packing," Mrs. Gereth humorously\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he means them--in the first place, at least--to try to talk\r\nyou over."\r\n\r\n"In the first place, eh? And what does he mean in the second?"\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated; she had not foreseen that so simple an inquiry could\r\ndisconcert her. "I\'m afraid I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you ask?" Mrs. Gereth spoke as if she might have said, "What\r\nthen were you doing all the while?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t ask very much," said her companion. "He has been gone some\r\ntime. The great thing seemed to be to understand clearly that he\r\nwouldn\'t be content with anything less than what he mentioned."\r\n\r\n"My just giving everything back?"\r\n\r\n"Your just giving everything back."\r\n\r\n"Well, darling, what did you tell him?" Mrs. Gereth blandly inquired.\r\n\r\nFleda faltered again, wincing at the term of endearment, at what the\r\nwords took for granted, charged with the confidence she had now\r\ncommitted herself to betray. "I told him I would tell you!" She smiled,\r\nbut she felt that her smile was rather hollow and even that Mrs. Gereth\r\nhad begun to look at her with some fixedness.\r\n\r\n"Did he seem very angry?"\r\n\r\n"He seemed very sad. He takes it very hard," Fleda added.\r\n\r\n"And how does _she_ take it?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that--that I felt a delicacy about asking."\r\n\r\n"So you didn\'t ask?" The words had the note of surprise.\r\n\r\nFleda was embarrassed; she had not made up her mind definitely to lie.\r\n"I didn\'t think you\'d care." That small untruth she would risk.\r\n\r\n"Well--I don\'t!" Mrs. Gereth declared; and Fleda felt less guilty to\r\nhear her, for the statement was as inexact as her own. "Didn\'t you say\r\nanything in return?" Mrs. Gereth presently continued.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean in the way of justifying you?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to trouble you to do that. My justification," said Mrs.\r\nGereth, sitting there warmly and, in the lucidity of her thought, which\r\nnevertheless hung back a little, dropping her eyes on the gravel--"my\r\njustification was all the past. My justification was the cruelty--" But\r\nat this, with a short, sharp gesture, she checked herself. "It\'s too\r\ngood of me to talk--now." She produced these sentences with a cold\r\npatience, as if addressing Fleda in the girl\'s virtual and actual\r\ncharacter of Owen\'s representative. Our young lady crept to and fro\r\nbefore the bench, combating the sense that it was occupied by a judge,\r\nlooking at her boot-toes, reminding herself in doing so of Mona, and\r\nlightly crunching the pebbles as she walked. She moved about because she\r\nwas afraid, putting off from moment to moment the exercise of the\r\ncourage she had been sure she possessed. That courage would all come to\r\nher if she could only be equally sure that what she should be called\r\nupon to do for Owen would be to suffer. She had wondered, while Mrs.\r\nGereth spoke, how that lady would describe her justification. She had\r\ndescribed it as if to be irreproachably fair, give her adversary the\r\nbenefit of every doubt, and then dismiss the question forever. "Of\r\ncourse," Mrs. Gereth went on, "if we didn\'t succeed in showing him at\r\nPoynton the ground we took, it\'s simply that he shuts his eyes. What I\r\nsupposed was that you would have given him your opinion that if I was\r\nthe woman so signally to assert myself, I\'m also the woman to rest upon\r\nit imperturbably enough."\r\n\r\nFleda stopped in front of her hostess. "I gave him my opinion that\r\nyou\'re very logical, very obstinate, and very proud."\r\n\r\n"Quite right, my dear: I\'m a rank bigot--about that sort of thing!" and\r\nMrs. Gereth jerked her head at the contents of the house. "I\'ve never\r\ndenied it. I\'d kidnap--to save them, to convert them--the children of\r\nheretics. When I know I\'m right I go to the stake. Oh, he may burn me\r\nalive!" she cried with a happy face. "Did he abuse me?" she then\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nFleda had remained there, gathering in her purpose. "How little you know\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth stared, then broke into a laugh that her companion had not\r\nexpected. "Ah, my dear, certainly not so well as you!" The girl, at\r\nthis, turned away again--she felt she looked too conscious; and she was\r\naware that, during a pause, Mrs. Gereth\'s eyes watched her as she went.\r\nShe faced about afresh to meet them, but what she met was a question\r\nthat reinforced them. "Why had you a \'delicacy\' as to speaking of Mona?"\r\n\r\nShe stopped again before the bench, and an inspiration came to her. "I\r\nshould think _you_ would know," she said with proper dignity.\r\n\r\nBlankness was for a moment on Mrs. Gereth\'s brow; then light broke--she\r\nvisibly remembered the scene in the breakfast-room after Mona\'s night at\r\nPoynton. "Because I contrasted you--told him _you_ were the one?" Her\r\neyes looked deep. "You were--you are still!"\r\n\r\nFleda gave a bold dramatic laugh. "Thank you, my love--with all the best\r\nthings at Ricks!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth considered, trying to penetrate, as it seemed; but at last\r\nshe brought out roundly: "For you, you know, I\'d send them back!"\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s heart gave a tremendous bound; the right way dawned upon her\r\nin a flash. Obscurity indeed the next moment engulfed this course, but\r\nfor a few thrilled seconds she had understood. To send the things back\r\n"for her" meant of course to send them back if there were even a dim\r\nchance that she might become mistress of them. Fleda\'s palpitation was\r\nnot allayed as she asked herself what portent Mrs. Gereth had suddenly\r\nperceived of such a chance: that perception could come only from a\r\nsudden suspicion of her secret. This suspicion, in turn, was a tolerably\r\nstraight consequence of that implied view of the propriety of surrender\r\nfrom which, she was well aware, she could say nothing to dissociate\r\nherself. What she first felt was that if she wished to rescue the spoils\r\nshe wished also to rescue her secret. So she looked as innocent as she\r\ncould and said as quickly as possible: "For me? Why in the world for\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Because you\'re so awfully keen."\r\n\r\n"Am I? Do I strike you so? You know I hate him," Fleda went on.\r\n\r\nShe had the sense for a while of Mrs. Gereth\'s regarding her with the\r\ndetachment of some stern, clever stranger. "Then what\'s the matter with\r\nyou? Why do you want me to give in?"\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated; she felt herself reddening. "I\'ve only said your son\r\nwants it. I haven\'t said _I_ do."\r\n\r\n"Then say it and have done with it!"\r\n\r\nThis was more peremptory than any word her friend, though often speaking\r\nin her presence with much point, had ever yet directly addressed to her.\r\nIt affected her like the crack of a whip, but she confined herself, with\r\nan effort, to taking it as a reminder that she must keep her head. "I\r\nknow he has his engagement to carry out."\r\n\r\n"His engagement to marry? Why, it\'s just that engagement we loathe!"\r\n\r\n"Why should _I_ loathe it?" Fleda asked with a strained smile. Then,\r\nbefore Mrs. Gereth could reply, she pursued: "I\'m thinking of his\r\ngeneral undertaking--to give her the house as she originally saw it."\r\n\r\n"To give her the house!" Mrs. Gereth brought up the words from the depth\r\nof the unspeakable. The effort was like the moan of an autumn wind; it\r\nwas in the power of such an image to make her turn pale.\r\n\r\n"I\'m thinking," Fleda continued, "of the simple question of his keeping\r\nfaith on an important clause of his contract: it doesn\'t matter whether\r\nit\'s with a stupid girl or with a monster of cleverness. I\'m thinking of\r\nhis honor and his good name."\r\n\r\n"The honor and good name of a man you hate?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," the girl resolutely answered. "I don\'t see why you should\r\ntalk as if one had a petty mind. You don\'t think so. It\'s not on that\r\nassumption you\'ve ever dealt with me. I can do your son justice, as he\r\nput his case to me."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then he did put his case to you!" Mrs. Gereth exclaimed, with an\r\naccent of triumph. "You seemed to speak just now as if really nothing of\r\nany consequence had passed between you."\r\n\r\n"Something always passes when one has a little imagination," our young\r\nlady declared.\r\n\r\n"I take it you don\'t mean that Owen has any!" Mrs. Gereth cried with her\r\nlarge laugh.\r\n\r\nFleda was silent a moment. "No, I don\'t mean that Owen has any," she\r\nreturned at last.\r\n\r\n"Why is it you hate him so?" her hostess abruptly inquired.\r\n\r\n"Should I love him for all he has made you suffer?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth slowly rose at this and, coming across the walk, took her\r\nyoung friend in her arms and kissed her. She then passed into one of\r\nFleda\'s an arm perversely and imperiously sociable. "Let us move a\r\nlittle," she said, holding her close and giving a slight shiver. They\r\nstrolled along the terrace, and she brought out another question. "He\r\n_was_ eloquent, then, poor dear--he poured forth the story of his\r\nwrongs?"\r\n\r\nFleda smiled down at her companion, who, cloaked and perceptibly bowed,\r\nleaned on her heavily and gave her an odd, unwonted sense of age and\r\ncunning. She took refuge in an evasion. "He couldn\'t tell me anything\r\nthat I didn\'t know pretty well already."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very true that you know everything. No, dear, you haven\'t a petty\r\nmind; you\'ve a lovely imagination and you\'re the nicest creature in the\r\nworld. If you were inane, like most girls--like every one, in fact--I\r\nwould have insulted you, I would have outraged you, and then you would\r\nhave fled from me in terror. No, now that I think of it," Mrs. Gereth\r\nwent on, "you wouldn\'t have fled from me; nothing, on the contrary,\r\nwould have made you budge. You would have cuddled into your warm corner,\r\nbut you would have been wounded and weeping and martyrized, and you\r\nwould have taken every opportunity to tell people I\'m a brute--as indeed\r\nI should have been!" They went to and fro, and she would not allow\r\nFleda, who laughed and protested, to attenuate with any light civility\r\nthis spirited picture. She praised her cleverness and her patience; then\r\nshe said it was getting cold and dark and they must go in to tea. She\r\ndelayed quitting the place, however, and reverted instead to Owen\'s\r\nultimatum, about which she asked another question or two; in particular\r\nwhether it had struck Fleda that he really believed she would comply\r\nwith such a summons.\r\n\r\n"I think he really believes that if I try hard enough I can make you:"\r\nafter uttering which words our young lady stopped short and emulated the\r\nembrace she had received a few moments before.\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve promised to try: I see. You didn\'t tell me that, either,"\r\nMrs. Gereth added as they went on. "But you\'re rascal enough for\r\nanything!" While Fleda was occupied in thinking in what terms she could\r\nexplain why she had indeed been rascal enough for the reticence thus\r\ndenounced, her companion broke out with an inquiry somewhat irrelevant\r\nand even in form somewhat profane. "Why the devil, at any rate, doesn\'t\r\nit come off?"\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated. "You mean their marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I mean their marriage!" Fleda hesitated again. "I haven\'t the\r\nleast idea."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t ask him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, how in the world can you fancy?" She spoke in a shocked tone.\r\n\r\n"Fancy your putting a question so indelicate? _I_ should have put it--I\r\nmean in your place; but I\'m quite coarse, thank God!" Fleda felt\r\nprivately that she herself was coarse, or at any rate would presently\r\nhave to be; and Mrs. Gereth, with a purpose that struck the girl as\r\nincreasing, continued: "What, then, _was_ the day to be? Wasn\'t it just\r\none of these?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t remember."\r\n\r\nIt was part of the great rupture and an effect of Mrs. Gereth\'s\r\ncharacter that up to this moment she had been completely and haughtily\r\nindifferent to that detail. Now, however, she had a visible reason for\r\nbeing clear about it. She bethought herself and she broke out--"Isn\'t\r\nthe day past?" Then, stopping short, she added: "Upon my word, they must\r\nhave put it off!" As Fleda made no answer to this she sharply went on:\r\n"_Have_ they put it off?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the least idea," said the girl.\r\n\r\nHer hostess was looking at her hard again. "Didn\'t he tell you--didn\'t\r\nhe say anything about it?"\r\n\r\nFleda, meanwhile, had had time to make her reflections, which were\r\nmoreover the continued throb of those that had occupied the interval\r\nbetween Owen\'s departure and his mother\'s return. If she should now\r\nrepeat his words, this wouldn\'t at all play the game of her definite\r\nvow; it would only play the game of her little gagged and blinded\r\ndesire. She could calculate well enough the effect of telling Mrs.\r\nGereth how she had had it from Owen\'s troubled lips that Mona was only\r\nwaiting for the restitution and would do nothing without it. The thing\r\nwas to obtain the restitution without imparting that knowledge. The only\r\nway, also, not to impart it was not to tell any truth at all about it;\r\nand the only way to meet this last condition was to reply to her\r\ncompanion, as she presently did: "He told me nothing whatever: he didn\'t\r\ntouch on the subject."\r\n\r\n"Not in any way?"\r\n\r\n"Not in any way."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth watched Fleda and considered. "You haven\'t any idea if they\r\nare waiting for the things?"\r\n\r\n"How should I have? I\'m not in their counsels."\r\n\r\n"I dare say they are--or that Mona is." Mrs. Gereth reflected again; she\r\nhad a bright idea. "If I don\'t give in, I\'ll be hanged if she\'ll not\r\nbreak off."\r\n\r\n"She\'ll never, never break off!" said Fleda.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t be sure, but it\'s my belief."\r\n\r\n"Derived from _him_?"\r\n\r\nThe girl hung fire a few seconds. "Derived from him."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth gave her a long last look, then turned abruptly away. "It\'s\r\nan awful bore you didn\'t really get it out of him! Well, come to tea,"\r\nshe added rather dryly, passing straight into the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sense of her adversary\'s dryness, which was ominous of something she\r\ncouldn\'t read, made Fleda, before complying, linger a little on the\r\nterrace; she felt the need moreover of taking breath after such a flight\r\ninto the cold air of denial. When at last she rejoined Mrs. Gereth she\r\nfound her erect before the drawing-room fire. Their tea had been set out\r\nin the same quarter, and the mistress of the house, for whom the\r\npreparation of it was in general a high and undelegated function, was in\r\nan attitude to which the hissing urn made no appeal. This omission, for\r\nFleda, was such a further sign of something to come that, to disguise\r\nher apprehension, she immediately and without an apology took the duty\r\nin hand; only, however, to be promptly reminded that she was performing\r\nit confusedly and not counting the journeys of the little silver shovel\r\nshe emptied into the pot. "Not _five_, my dear--the usual three," said\r\nher hostess, with the same dryness; watching her then in silence while\r\nshe clumsily corrected her mistake. The tea took some minutes to draw,\r\nand Mrs. Gereth availed herself of them suddenly to exclaim: "You\r\nhaven\'t yet told me, you know, how it is you propose to \'make\' me!"\r\n\r\n"Give everything back?" Fleda looked into the pot again and uttered her\r\nquestion with a briskness that she felt to be a little overdone. "Why,\r\nby putting the question well before you; by being so eloquent that I\r\nshall persuade you, shall act upon you; by making you sorry for having\r\ngone so far," she said boldly; "by simply and earnestly asking it of\r\nyou, in short; and by reminding you at the same time that it\'s the first\r\nthing I ever have so asked. Oh, you\'ve done things for me--endless and\r\nbeautiful things," she exclaimed; "but you\'ve done them all from your\r\nown generous impulse. I\'ve never so much as hinted to you to lend me a\r\npostage-stamp."\r\n\r\n"Give me a cup of tea," said Mrs. Gereth. A moment later, taking the\r\ncup, she replied: "No, you\'ve never asked me for a postage-stamp."\r\n\r\n"That gives me a pull!" Fleda returned, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Puts you in the situation of expecting that I shall do this thing just\r\nsimply to oblige you?"\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated. "You said a while ago that for me you _would_ do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"For you, but not for your eloquence. Do you understand what I mean by\r\nthe difference?" Mrs. Gereth asked as she stood stirring her tea.\r\n\r\nFleda, to postpone answering, looked round, while she drank it, at the\r\nbeautiful room. "I don\'t in the least like, you know, your having taken\r\nso much. It was a great shock to me, on my arrival here, to find you had\r\ndone so."\r\n\r\n"Give me some more tea," said Mrs. Gereth; and there was a moment\'s\r\nsilence as Fleda poured out another cup. "If you were shocked, my dear,\r\nI\'m bound to say you concealed your shock."\r\n\r\n"I know I did. I was afraid to show it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth drank off her second cup. "And you\'re not afraid now?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not afraid now."\r\n\r\n"What has made the difference?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve pulled myself together." Fleda paused; then she added: "And I\'ve\r\nseen Mr. Owen."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve seen Mr. Owen"--Mrs. Gereth concurred. She put down her cup and\r\nsank into a chair, in which she leaned back, resting her head and gazing\r\nat her young friend. "Yes, I did tell you a while ago that for you I\'d\r\ndo it. But you haven\'t told me yet what you\'ll do in return."\r\n\r\nFleda thought an instant. "Anything in the wide world you may require."\r\n\r\n"Oh, \'anything\' is nothing at all! That\'s too easily said." Mrs. Gereth,\r\nreclining more completely, closed her eyes with an air of disgust, an\r\nair indeed of inviting slumber.\r\n\r\nFleda looked at her quiet face, which the appearance of slumber always\r\nmade particularly handsome; she noted how much the ordeal of the last\r\nfew weeks had added to its indications of age. "Well then, try me with\r\nsomething. What is it you demand?"\r\n\r\nAt this, opening her eyes, Mrs. Gereth sprang straight up. "Get him away\r\nfrom her!"\r\n\r\nFleda marveled: her companion had in an instant become young again.\r\n"Away from Mona? How in the world--?"\r\n\r\n"By not looking like a fool!" cried Mrs. Gereth very sharply. She kissed\r\nher, however, on the spot, to make up for this roughness, and summarily\r\ntook off her hat, which, on coming into the house, our young lady had\r\nnot removed. She applied a friendly touch to the girl\'s hair and gave a\r\nbusinesslike pull to her jacket. "I say don\'t look like an idiot,\r\nbecause you happen not to be one, not the least bit. _I_\'m idiotic; I\'ve\r\nbeen so, I\'ve just discovered, ever since our first days together. I\'ve\r\nbeen a precious donkey; but that\'s another affair."\r\n\r\nFleda, as if she humbly assented, went through no form of controverting\r\nthis; she simply stood passive to her companion\'s sudden refreshment of\r\nher appearance. "How _can_ I get him away from her?" she presently\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n"By letting yourself go."\r\n\r\n"By letting myself go?" She spoke mechanically, still more like an\r\nidiot, and felt as if her face flamed out the insincerity of her\r\nquestion. It was vividly back again, the vision of the real way to act\r\nupon Mrs. Gereth. This lady\'s movements were now rapid; she turned off\r\nfrom her as quickly as she had seized her, and Fleda sat down to steady\r\nherself for full responsibility.\r\n\r\nHer hostess, without taking up her ejaculation, gave a violent poke at\r\nthe fire and then faced her again. "You\'ve done two things, then,\r\nto-day--haven\'t you?--that you\'ve never done before. One has been asking\r\nme the service, or favor, or concession--whatever you call it--that you\r\njust mentioned; the other has been telling me--certainly too for the\r\nfirst time--an immense little fib."\r\n\r\n"An immense little fib?" Fleda felt weak; she was glad of the support of\r\nher seat.\r\n\r\n"An immense big one, then!" said Mrs. Gereth irritatedly. "You don\'t in\r\nthe least \'hate\' Owen, my darling. You care for him very much. In fact,\r\nmy own, you\'re in love with him--there! Don\'t tell me any more lies!"\r\ncried Mrs. Gereth with a voice and a face in the presence of which Fleda\r\nrecognized that there was nothing for her but to hold herself and take\r\nthem. When once the truth was out, it was out, and she could see more\r\nand more every instant that it would be the only way. She accepted\r\ntherefore what had to come; she leaned back her head and closed her eyes\r\nas her companion had done just before. She would have covered her face\r\nwith her hands but for the still greater shame. "Oh, you\'re a wonder, a\r\nwonder," said Mrs. Gereth; "you\'re magnificent, and I was right, as soon\r\nas I saw you, to pick you out and trust you!" Fleda closed her eyes\r\ntighter at this last word, but her friend kept it up. "I never dreamed\r\nof it till a while ago, when, after he had come and gone, we were face\r\nto face. Then something stuck out of you; it strongly impressed me, and\r\nI didn\'t know at first quite what to make of it. It was that you had\r\njust been with him and that you were not natural. Not natural to _me_,"\r\nshe added with a smile. "I pricked up my ears, and all that this might\r\nmean dawned upon me when you said you had asked nothing about Mona. It\r\nput me on the scent, but I didn\'t show you, did I? I felt it was _in_\r\nyou, deep down, and that I must draw it out. Well, I _have_ drawn it,\r\nand it\'s a blessing. Yesterday, when you shed tears at breakfast, I was\r\nawfully puzzled. What has been the matter with you all the while? Why,\r\nFleda, it isn\'t a crime, don\'t you know that?" cried the delighted\r\nwoman. "When I was a girl I was always in love, and not always with such\r\nnice people as Owen. I didn\'t behave as well as you; compared with you I\r\nthink I must have been horrid. But if you\'re proud and reserved, it\'s\r\nyour own affair; I\'m proud too, though I\'m not reserved--that\'s what\r\nspoils it. I\'m stupid, above all--that\'s what I am; so dense that I\r\nreally blush for it. However, no one but you could have deceived me. If\r\nI trusted you, moreover, it was exactly to be cleverer than myself. You\r\nmust be so now more than ever!" Suddenly Fleda felt her hands grasped:\r\nMrs. Gereth had plumped down at her feet and was leaning on her knees.\r\n"Save him--save him: you _can_!" she passionately pleaded. "How could\r\nyou _not_ like him, when he\'s such a dear? He _is_ a dear, darling;\r\nthere\'s no harm in my own boy! You can do what you will with him--you\r\nknow you can! What else does he give us all this time for? Get him away\r\nfrom her; it\'s as if he besought you to, poor wretch! Don\'t abandon him\r\nto such a fate, and I\'ll never abandon _you_. Think of him with that\r\ncreature, that future! If you\'ll take him I\'ll give up everything.\r\nThere, it\'s a solemn promise, the most sacred of my life! Get the better\r\nof her, and he shall have every stick I removed. Give me your word, and\r\nI\'ll accept it. I\'ll write for the packers to-night!"\r\n\r\nFleda, before this, had fallen forward on her companion\'s neck, and the\r\ntwo women, clinging together, had got up while the younger wailed on the\r\nother\'s bosom. "You smooth it down because you see more in it than there\r\ncan ever be; but after my hideous double game how will you be able to\r\nbelieve in me again?"\r\n\r\n"I see in it simply what _must_ be, if you\'ve a single spark of pity.\r\nWhere on earth was the double game, when you\'ve behaved like such a\r\nsaint? You\'ve been beautiful, you\'ve been exquisite, and all our trouble\r\nis over."\r\n\r\nFleda, drying her eyes, shook her head ever so sadly. "No, Mrs. Gereth,\r\nit isn\'t over. I can\'t do what you ask--I can\'t meet your condition."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth stared; the cloud gathered in her face again. "Why, in the\r\nname of goodness, when you adore him? I know what you see in him," she\r\ndeclared in another tone. "You\'re right!"\r\n\r\nFleda gave a faint, stubborn smile. "He cares for her too much."\r\n\r\n"Then why doesn\'t he marry her? He\'s giving you an extraordinary\r\nchance."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t dream I\'ve ever thought of him," said Fleda. "Why should he,\r\nif you didn\'t?"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t with me you were in love, my duck." Then Mrs. Gereth added:\r\n"I\'ll go and tell him."\r\n\r\n"If you do any such thing, you shall never see me again,--absolutely,\r\nliterally never!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth looked hard at her young friend, showing she saw she must\r\nbelieve her. "Then you\'re perverse, you\'re wicked. Will you swear he\r\ndoesn\'t know?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he doesn\'t know!" cried Fleda indignantly.\r\n\r\nHer interlocutress was silent a little. "And that he has no feeling on\r\n_his_ side?"\r\n\r\n"For me?" Fleda stared. "Before he has even married her?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth gave a sharp laugh at this. "He ought at least to appreciate\r\nyour wit. Oh, my dear, you _are_ a treasure! Doesn\'t he appreciate\r\nanything? Has he given you absolutely no symptom--not looked a look, not\r\nbreathed a sigh?"\r\n\r\n"The case," said Fleda coldly, "is as I\'ve had the honor to state it."\r\n\r\n"Then he\'s as big a donkey as his mother! But you know you must account\r\nfor their delay," Mrs. Gereth remarked.\r\n\r\n"Why must I?" Fleda asked after a moment.\r\n\r\n"Because you were closeted with him here so long. You can\'t pretend at\r\npresent, you know, not to have any art."\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated an instant; she was conscious that she must choose\r\nbetween two risks. She had had a secret and the secret was gone. Owen\r\nhad one, which was still unbruised, and the greater risk now was that\r\nhis mother should lay her formidable hand upon it. All Fleda\'s\r\ntenderness for him moved her to protect it; so she faced the smaller\r\nperil. "Their delay," she brought herself to reply, "may perhaps be\r\nMona\'s doing. I mean because he has lost her the things."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth jumped at this. "So that she\'ll break altogether if I keep\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\nFleda winced. "I\'ve told you what I believe about that. She\'ll make\r\nscenes and conditions; she\'ll worry him. But she\'ll hold him fast;\r\nshe\'ll never give him up."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth turned it over. "Well, I\'ll keep them, to try her," she\r\nfinally pronounced; at which Fleda felt quite sick, as if she had given\r\neverything and got nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\n"I must in common decency let him know that I\'ve talked of the matter\r\nwith you," she said to her hostess that evening. "What answer do you\r\nwish me to write to him?"\r\n\r\n"Write to him that you must see him again," said Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\nFleda looked very blank. "What on earth am I to see him for?"\r\n\r\n"For anything you like."\r\n\r\nThe girl would have been struck with the levity of this had she not\r\nalready, in an hour, felt the extent of the change suddenly wrought in\r\nher commerce with her friend--wrought above all, to that friend\'s view,\r\nin her relation to the great issue. The effect of what had followed\r\nOwen\'s visit was to make that relation the very key of the crisis.\r\nPressed upon her, goodness knew, the crisis had been, but it now seemed\r\nto put forth big, encircling arms--arms that squeezed till they hurt and\r\nshe must cry out. It was as if everything at Ricks had been poured into\r\na common receptacle, a public ferment of emotion and zeal, out of which\r\nit was ladled up to be tasted and talked about; everything at least but\r\nthe one little treasure of knowledge that she kept back. She ought to\r\nhave liked this, she reflected, because it meant sympathy, meant a\r\ncloser union with the source of so much in her life that had been\r\nbeautiful and renovating; but there were fine instincts in her that\r\nstood off. She had had--and it was not merely at this time--to recognize\r\nthat there were things for which Mrs. Gereth\'s _flair_ was not so happy\r\nas for bargains and "marks." It wouldn\'t be happy now as to the best\r\naction on the knowledge she had just gained; yet as from this moment\r\nthey were still more intimately together, so a person deeply in her debt\r\nwould simply have to stand and meet what was to come. There were ways in\r\nwhich she could sharply incommode such a person, and not only with the\r\nbest conscience in the world, but with a sort of brutality of good\r\nintentions. One of the straightest of these strokes, Fleda saw, would be\r\nthe dance of delight over the mystery Mrs. Gereth had laid bare--the\r\nloud, lawful, tactless joy of the explorer leaping upon the strand. Like\r\nany other lucky discoverer, she would take possession of the fortunate\r\nisland. She was nothing if not practical: almost the only thing she took\r\naccount of in her young friend\'s soft secret was the excellent use she\r\ncould make of it--a use so much to her taste that she refused to feel a\r\nhindrance in the quality of the material. Fleda put into Mrs. Gereth\'s\r\nanswer to her question a good deal more meaning than it would have\r\noccurred to her a few hours before that she was prepared to put, but she\r\nhad on the spot a foreboding that even so broad a hint would live to be\r\nbettered.\r\n\r\n"Do you suggest that I shall propose to him to come down here again?"\r\nshe presently inquired.\r\n\r\n"Dear, no; say that you\'ll go up to town and meet him." It _was_\r\nbettered, the broad hint; and Fleda felt this to be still more the case\r\nwhen, returning to the subject before they went to bed, her companion\r\nsaid: "I make him over to you wholly, you know--to do what you please\r\nwith. Deal with him in your own clever way--I ask no questions. All I\r\nask is that you succeed."\r\n\r\n"That\'s charming," Fleda replied, "but it doesn\'t tell me a bit, you\'ll\r\nbe so good as to consider, in what terms to write to him. It\'s not an\r\nanswer from you to the message I was to give you."\r\n\r\n"The answer to his message is perfectly distinct: he shall have\r\neverything in the place the minute he\'ll say he\'ll marry you."\r\n\r\n"You really pretend," Fleda asked, "to think me capable of transmitting\r\nhim that news?"\r\n\r\n"What else can I really pretend when you threaten so to cast me off if I\r\nspeak the word myself?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, if _you_ speak the word!" the girl murmured very gravely, but happy\r\nat least to know that in this direction Mrs. Gereth confessed herself\r\nwarned and helpless. Then she added: "How can I go on living with you on\r\na footing of which I so deeply disapprove? Thinking as I do that you\'ve\r\ndespoiled him far more than is just or merciful--for if I expected you\r\nto take something, I didn\'t in the least expect you to take\r\neverything--how can I stay here without a sense that I\'m backing you up\r\nin your cruelty and participating in your ill-gotten gains?" Fleda was\r\ndetermined that if she had the chill of her exposed and investigated\r\nstate she would also have the convenience of it, and that if Mrs. Gereth\r\npopped in and out of the chamber of her soul she would at least return\r\nthe freedom. "I shall quite hate, you know, in a day or two, every\r\nobject that surrounds you--become blind to all the beauty and rarity\r\nthat I formerly delighted in. Don\'t think me harsh; there\'s no use in my\r\nnot being frank now. If I leave you, everything\'s at an end."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth, however, was imperturbable: Fleda had to recognize that her\r\nadvantage had become too real. "It\'s too beautiful, the way you care for\r\nhim; it\'s music in my ears. Nothing else but such a passion could make\r\nyou say such things; that\'s the way I should have been too, my dear. Why\r\ndidn\'t you tell me sooner? I\'d have gone right in for you; I never would\r\nhave moved a candlestick. Don\'t stay with me if it torments you; don\'t,\r\nif you suffer, be where you see the old rubbish. Go up to town--go back\r\nfor a little to your father\'s. It need be only for a little; two or\r\nthree weeks will see us through. Your father will take you and be glad,\r\nif you only will make him understand what it\'s a question of--of your\r\ngetting yourself off his hands forever. _I_\'ll make him understand, you\r\nknow, if you feel shy. I\'d take you up myself, I\'d go with you, to spare\r\nyour being bored; we\'d put up at an hotel and we might amuse ourselves a\r\nbit. We haven\'t had much pleasure since we met, have we? But of course\r\nthat wouldn\'t suit our book. I should be a bugaboo to Owen--I should be\r\nfatally in the way. Your chance is there--your chance is to be alone;\r\nfor God\'s sake, use it to the right end. If you\'re in want of money I\'ve\r\na little I can give you. But I ask no questions--not a question as small\r\nas your shoe!"\r\n\r\nShe asked no questions, but she took the most extraordinary things for\r\ngranted. Fleda felt this still more at the end of a couple of days. On\r\nthe second of these our young lady wrote to Owen; her emotion had to a\r\ncertain degree cleared itself--there was something she could say\r\nbriefly. If she had given everything to Mrs. Gereth and as yet got\r\nnothing, so she had on the other hand quickly reacted--it took but a\r\nnight--against the discouragement of her first check. Her desire to\r\nserve him was too passionate, the sense that he counted upon her too\r\nsweet: these things caught her up again and gave her a new patience and\r\na new subtlety. It shouldn\'t really be for nothing that she had given so\r\nmuch; deep within her burned again the resolve to get something back. So\r\nwhat she wrote to Owen was simply that she had had a great scene with\r\nhis mother, but that he must be patient and give her time. It was\r\ndifficult, as they both had expected, but she was working her hardest\r\nfor him. She had made an impression--she would do everything to follow\r\nit up. Meanwhile he must keep intensely quiet and take no other steps;\r\nhe must only trust her and pray for her and believe in her perfect\r\nloyalty. She made no allusion whatever to Mona\'s attitude, nor to his\r\nnot being, as regarded that young lady, master of the situation; but she\r\nsaid in a postscript, in reference to his mother, "Of course she wonders\r\na good deal why your marriage doesn\'t take place." After the letter had\r\ngone she regretted having used the word "loyalty;" there were two or\r\nthree milder terms which she might as well have employed. The answer she\r\nimmediately received from Owen was a little note of which she met all\r\nthe deficiencies by describing it to herself as pathetically simple, but\r\nwhich, to prove that Mrs. Gereth might ask as many questions as she\r\nliked, she at once made his mother read. He had no art with his pen, he\r\nhad not even a good hand, and his letter, a short profession of friendly\r\nconfidence, consisted of but a few familiar and colorless words of\r\nacknowledgment and assent. The gist of it was that he would certainly,\r\nsince Miss Vetch recommended it, not hurry mamma too much. He would not\r\nfor the present cause her to be approached by any one else, but he would\r\nnevertheless continue to hope that she would see she _must_ come round.\r\n"Of course, you know," he added, "she can\'t keep me waiting\r\nindefinitely. Please give her my love and tell her that. If it can be\r\ndone peaceably I know you\'re just the one to do it."\r\n\r\nFleda had awaited his rejoinder in deep suspense; such was her\r\nimagination of the possibility of his having, as she tacitly phrased it,\r\nlet himself go on paper that when it arrived she was at first almost\r\nafraid to open it. There was indeed a distinct danger, for if he should\r\ntake it into his head to write her love-letters the whole chance of\r\naiding him would drop: she would have to return them, she would have to\r\ndecline all further communication with him: it would be quite the end of\r\nthe business. This imagination of Fleda\'s was a faculty that easily\r\nembraced all the heights and depths and extremities of things; that made\r\na single mouthful, in particular, of any tragic or desperate necessity.\r\nShe was perhaps at first just a trifle disappointed not to find in the\r\nnote in question a syllable that strayed from the text; but the next\r\nmoment she had risen to a point of view from which it presented itself\r\nas a production almost inspired in its simplicity. It was simple even\r\nfor Owen, and she wondered what had given him the cue to be more so than\r\nusual. Then she saw how natures that are right just do the things that\r\nare right. He wasn\'t clever--his manner of writing showed it; but the\r\ncleverest man in England couldn\'t have had more the instinct that, under\r\nthe circumstances, was the supremely happy one, the instinct of giving\r\nher something that would do beautifully to be shown to Mrs. Gereth. This\r\nwas a kind of divination, for naturally he couldn\'t know the line Mrs.\r\nGereth was taking. It was furthermore explained--and that was the most\r\ntouching part of all--by his wish that she herself should notice how\r\nawfully well he was behaving. His very bareness called her attention to\r\nhis virtue; and these were the exact fruits of her beautiful and\r\nterrible admonition. He was cleaving to Mona; he was doing his duty; he\r\nwas making tremendously sure he should be without reproach.\r\n\r\nIf Fleda handed this communication to her friend as a triumphant gage of\r\nthe innocence of the young man\'s heart, her elation lived but a moment\r\nafter Mrs. Gereth had pounced upon the tell-tale spot in it. "Why in the\r\nworld, then," that lady cried, "does he still not breathe a breath about\r\nthe day, the _day_, the day?" She repeated the word with a crescendo of\r\nsuperior acuteness; she proclaimed that nothing could be more marked\r\nthan its absence--an absence that simply spoke volumes. What did it\r\nprove in fine but that she was producing the effect she had toiled\r\nfor--that she had settled or was rapidly settling Mona?\r\n\r\nSuch a challenge Fleda was obliged in some manner to take up. "You may\r\nbe settling Mona," she returned with a smile, "but I can hardly regard\r\nit as sufficient evidence that you\'re settling Mona\'s lover."\r\n\r\n"Why not, with such a studied omission on his part to gloss over in any\r\nmanner the painful tension existing between them--the painful tension\r\nthat, under providence, I\'ve been the means of bringing about? He gives\r\nyou by his silence clear notice that his marriage is practically off."\r\n\r\n"He speaks to me of the only thing that concerns me. He gives me clear\r\nnotice that he abates not one jot of his demand."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, let him take the only way to get it satisfied."\r\n\r\nFleda had no need to ask again what such a way might be, nor was her\r\nsupport removed by the fine assurance with which Mrs. Gereth could make\r\nher argument wait upon her wish. These days, which dragged their length\r\ninto a strange, uncomfortable fortnight, had already borne more\r\ntestimony to that element than all the other time the two women had\r\npassed together. Our young lady had been at first far from measuring the\r\nwhole of a feature that Owen himself would probably have described as\r\nher companion\'s "cheek." She lived now in a kind of bath of boldness,\r\nfelt as if a fierce light poured in upon her from windows opened wide;\r\nand the singular part of the ordeal was that she couldn\'t protest\r\nagainst it fully without incurring, even to her own mind, some reproach\r\nof ingratitude, some charge of smallness. If Mrs. Gereth\'s apparent\r\ndetermination to hustle her into Owen\'s arms was accompanied with an air\r\nof holding her dignity rather cheap, this was after all only as a\r\nconsequence of her being held in respect to some other attributes rather\r\ndear. It was a new version of the old story of being kicked upstairs.\r\nThe wonderful woman was the same woman who, in the summer, at Poynton,\r\nhad been so puzzled to conceive why a good-natured girl shouldn\'t have\r\ncontributed more to the personal rout of the Brigstocks--shouldn\'t have\r\nbeen grateful even for the handsome puff of Fleda Vetch. Only her\r\npassion was keener now and her scruple more absent; the fight made a\r\ndemand upon her, and her pugnacity had become one with her constant\r\nhabit of using such weapons as she could pick up. She had no imagination\r\nabout anybody\'s life save on the side she bumped against. Fleda was\r\nquite aware that she would have otherwise been a rare creature; but a\r\nrare creature was originally just what she had struck her as being. Mrs.\r\nGereth had really no perception of anybody\'s nature--had only one\r\nquestion about persons: were they clever or stupid? To be clever meant\r\nto know the marks. Fleda knew them by direct inspiration, and a warm\r\nrecognition of this had been her friend\'s tribute to her character. The\r\ngirl had hours, now, of sombre wishing that she might never see anything\r\ngood again: that kind of experience was evidently not an infallible\r\nsource of peace. She would be more at peace in some vulgar little place\r\nthat should owe its _cachet_ to Tottenham Court Road. There were nice\r\nstrong horrors in West Kensington; it was as if they beckoned her and\r\nwooed her back to them. She had a relaxed recollection of Waterbath; and\r\nof her reasons for staying on at Ricks the force was rapidly ebbing. One\r\nof these was her pledge to Owen--her vow to press his mother close; the\r\nother was the fact that of the two discomforts, that of being prodded by\r\nMrs. Gereth and that of appearing to run after somebody else, the former\r\nremained for a while the more endurable.\r\n\r\nAs the days passed, however, it became plainer to Fleda that her only\r\nchance of success would be in lending herself to this low appearance.\r\nThen, moreover, at last, her nerves settling the question, the choice\r\nwas simply imposed by the violence done to her taste--to whatever was\r\nleft of that high principle, at least, after the free and reckless\r\nmeeting, for months, of great drafts and appeals. It was all very well\r\nto try to evade discussion: Owen Gereth was looking to her for a\r\nstruggle, and it wasn\'t a bit of a struggle to be disgusted and dumb.\r\nShe was on too strange a footing--that of having presented an ultimatum\r\nand having had it torn up in her face. In such a case as that the envoy\r\nalways departed; he never sat gaping and dawdling before the city. Mrs.\r\nGereth, every morning, looked publicly into "The Morning Post," the only\r\nnewspaper she received; and every morning she treated the blankness of\r\nthat journal as fresh evidence that everything was "off." What did the\r\nPost exist for but to tell you your children were wretchedly\r\nmarried?--so that if such a source of misery was dry, what could you do\r\nbut infer that for once you had miraculously escaped? She almost taunted\r\nFleda with supineness in not getting something out of somebody--in the\r\nsame breath indeed in which she drenched her with a kind of appreciation\r\nmore onerous to the girl than blame. Mrs. Gereth herself had of course\r\nwashed her hands of the matter; but Fleda knew people who knew Mona and\r\nwould be sure to be in her confidence--inconceivable people who admired\r\nher and had the privilege of Waterbath. What was the use therefore of\r\nbeing the most natural and the easiest of letter-writers, if no sort of\r\nside-light--in some pretext for correspondence--was, by a brilliant\r\ncreature, to be got out of such barbarians? Fleda was not only a\r\nbrilliant creature, but she heard herself commended in these days for\r\nnew and strange attractions; she figured suddenly, in the queer\r\nconversations of Ricks, as a distinguished, almost as a dangerous\r\nbeauty. That retouching of her hair and dress in which her friend had\r\nimpulsively indulged on a first glimpse of her secret was by implication\r\nvery frequently repeated. She had the sense not only of being advertised\r\nand offered, but of being counseled and enlightened in ways that she\r\nscarcely understood--arts obscure even to a poor girl who had had, in\r\ngood society and motherless poverty, to look straight at realities and\r\nfill out blanks.\r\n\r\nThese arts, when Mrs. Gereth\'s spirits were high, were handled with a\r\nbrave and cynical humor with which Fleda\'s fancy could keep no step:\r\nthey left our young lady wondering what on earth her companion wanted\r\nher to do. "I want you to cut in!"--that was Mrs. Gereth\'s familiar and\r\ncomprehensive phrase for the course she prescribed. She challenged again\r\nand again Fleda\'s picture, as she called it (though the sketch was too\r\nslight to deserve the name), of the indifference to which a prior\r\nattachment had committed the proprietor of Poynton. "Do you mean to say\r\nthat, Mona or no Mona, he could see you that way, day after day, and not\r\nhave the ordinary feelings of a man?" This was the sort of interrogation\r\nto which Fleda was fitfully and irrelevantly treated. She had grown\r\nalmost used to the refrain. "Do you mean to say that when, the other\r\nday, one had quite made you over to him, the great gawk, and he was, on\r\nthis very spot, utterly alone with you--?" The poor girl at this point\r\nnever left any doubt of what she meant to say, but Mrs. Gereth could be\r\ntrusted to break out in another place and at another time. At last Fleda\r\nwrote to her father that he must take her in for a while; and when, to\r\nher companion\'s delight, she returned to London, that lady went with her\r\nto the station and wafted her on her way. "The Morning Post" had been\r\ndelivered as they left the house, and Mrs. Gereth had brought it with\r\nher for the traveler, who never spent a penny on a newspaper. On the\r\nplatform, however, when this young person was ticketed, labeled, and\r\nseated, she opened it at the window of the carriage, exclaiming as\r\nusual, after looking into it a moment: "Nothing--nothing--nothing: don\'t\r\ntell _me_!" Every day that there was nothing was a nail in the coffin of\r\nthe marriage. An instant later the train was off, but, moving quickly\r\nbeside it, while Fleda leaned inscrutably forth, Mrs. Gereth grasped her\r\nfriend\'s hand and looked up with wonderful eyes. "Only let yourself go,\r\ndarling--only let yourself go!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThat she desired to ask no questions Mrs. Gereth conscientiously proved\r\nby closing her lips tight after Fleda had gone to London. No letter from\r\nRicks arrived at West Kensington, and Fleda, with nothing to communicate\r\nthat could be to the taste of either party, forbore to open a\r\ncorrespondence. If her heart had been less heavy she might have been\r\namused to perceive how much rope this reticence of Ricks seemed to\r\nsignify to her that she could take. She had at all events no good news\r\nfor her friend save in the sense that her silence was not bad news. She\r\nwas not yet in a position to write that she had "cut in;" but neither,\r\non the other hand, had she gathered material for announcing that Mona\r\nwas undisseverable from her prey. She had made no use of the pen so\r\nglorified by Mrs. Gereth to wake up the echoes of Waterbath; she had\r\nsedulously abstained from inquiring what in any quarter, far or near,\r\nwas said or suggested or supposed. She only spent a matutinal penny on\r\n"The Morning Post;" she only saw, on each occasion, that that inspired\r\nsheet had as little to say about the imminence as about the abandonment\r\nof certain nuptials. It was at the same time obvious that Mrs. Gereth\r\ntriumphed on these occasions much more than she trembled, and that with\r\na few such triumphs repeated she would cease to tremble at all. What was\r\nmost manifest, however, was that she had had a rare preconception of the\r\ncircumstances that would have ministered, had Fleda been disposed, to\r\nthe girl\'s cutting in. It was brought home to Fleda that these\r\ncircumstances would have particularly favored intervention; she was\r\nquickly forced to do them a secret justice. One of the effects of her\r\nintimacy with Mrs. Gereth was that she had quite lost all sense of\r\nintimacy with any one else. The lady of Ricks had made a desert around\r\nher, possessing and absorbing her so utterly that other partakers had\r\nfallen away. Hadn\'t she been admonished, months before, that people\r\nconsidered they had lost her and were reconciled on the whole to the\r\nprivation? Her present position in the great unconscious town defined\r\nitself as obscure: she regarded it at any rate with eyes suspicious of\r\nthat lesson. She neither wrote notes nor received them; she indulged in\r\nno reminders nor knocked at any doors; she wandered vaguely in the\r\nwestern wilderness or cultivated shy forms of that "household art" for\r\nwhich she had had a respect before tasting the bitter tree of knowledge.\r\nHer only plan was to be as quiet as a mouse, and when she failed in the\r\nattempt to lose herself in the flat suburb she felt like a lonely fly\r\ncrawling over a dusty chart.\r\n\r\nHow had Mrs. Gereth known in advance that if she had chosen to be "vile"\r\n(that was what Fleda called it) everything would happen to help\r\nher?--especially the way her poor father, after breakfast, doddered off\r\nto his club, showing seventy when he was really fifty-seven, and leaving\r\nher richly alone for the day. He came back about midnight, looking at\r\nher very hard and not risking long words--only making her feel by\r\ninimitable touches that the presence of his family compelled him to\r\nalter all his hours. She had in their common sitting-room the company of\r\nthe objects he was fond of saying that he had collected--objects, shabby\r\nand battered, of a sort that appealed little to his daughter: old\r\nbrandy-flasks and match-boxes, old calendars and hand-books, intermixed\r\nwith an assortment of pen-wipers and ash-trays, a harvest he had\r\ngathered in from penny bazaars. He was blandly unconscious of that side\r\nof Fleda\'s nature which had endeared her to Mrs. Gereth, and she had\r\noften heard him wish to goodness there was something striking she cared\r\nfor. Why didn\'t she try collecting something?--it didn\'t matter what.\r\nShe would find it gave an interest to life, and there was no end of\r\nlittle curiosities one could easily pick up. He was conscious of having\r\na taste for fine things which his children had unfortunately not\r\ninherited. This indicated the limits of their acquaintance with\r\nhim--limits which, as Fleda was now sharply aware, could only leave him\r\nto wonder what the mischief she was there for. As she herself echoed\r\nthis question to the letter she was not in a position to clear up the\r\nmystery. She couldn\'t have given a name to her errand in town or\r\nexplained it save by saying that she had had to get away from Ricks. It\r\nwas intensely provisional, but what was to come next? Nothing could come\r\nnext but a deeper anxiety. She had neither a home nor an\r\noutlook--nothing in all the wide world but a feeling of suspense.\r\n\r\nOf course she had her duty--her duty to Owen--a definite undertaking,\r\nreaffirmed, after his visit to Ricks, under her hand and seal; but there\r\nwas no sense of possession attached to that; there was only a horrible\r\nsense of privation. She had quite moved from under Mrs. Gereth\'s wide\r\nwing; and now that she was really among the pen-wipers and ash-trays she\r\nwas swept, at the thought of all the beauty she had forsworn, by short,\r\nwild gusts of despair. If her friend should really keep the spoils she\r\nwould never return to her. If that friend should on the other hand part\r\nwith them, what on earth would there be to return to? The chill struck\r\ndeep as Fleda thought of the mistress of Ricks reduced, in vulgar\r\nparlance, to what she had on her back: there was nothing to which she\r\ncould compare such an image but her idea of Marie Antoinette in the\r\nConciergerie, or perhaps the vision of some tropical bird, the creature\r\nof hot, dense forests, dropped on a frozen moor to pick up a living. The\r\nmind\'s eye could see Mrs. Gereth, indeed, only in her thick, colored\r\nair; it took all the light of her treasures to make her concrete and\r\ndistinct. She loomed for a moment, in any mere house, gaunt and\r\nunnatural; then she vanished as if she had suddenly sunk into a\r\nquicksand. Fleda lost herself in the rich fancy of how, if _she_ were\r\nmistress of Poynton, a whole province, as an abode, should be assigned\r\nthere to the august queen-mother. She would have returned from her\r\ncampaign with her baggage-train and her loot, and the palace would unbar\r\nits shutters and the morning flash back from its halls. In the event of\r\na surrender the poor woman would never again be able to begin to\r\ncollect: she was now too old and too moneyless, and times were altered\r\nand good things impossibly dear. A surrender, furthermore, to any\r\ndaughter-in-law save an oddity like Mona needn\'t at all be an abdication\r\nin fact; any other fairly nice girl whom Owen should have taken it into\r\nhis head to marry would have been positively glad to have, for the\r\nmuseum, a custodian who was a walking catalogue and who understood\r\nbeyond any one in England the hygiene and temperament of rare pieces. A\r\nfairly nice girl would somehow be away a good deal and would at such\r\ntimes count it a blessing to feel Mrs. Gereth at her post.\r\n\r\nFleda had fully recognized, the first days, that, quite apart from any\r\nquestion of letting Owen know where she was, it would be a charity to\r\ngive him some sign: it would be weak, it would be ugly, to be diverted\r\nfrom that kindness by the fact that Mrs. Gereth had attached a tinkling\r\nbell to it. A frank relation with him was only superficially\r\ndiscredited: she ought for his own sake to send him a word of cheer. So\r\nshe repeatedly reasoned, but she as repeatedly delayed performance: if\r\nher general plan had been to be as still as a mouse, an interview like\r\nthe interview at Ricks would be an odd contribution to that ideal.\r\nTherefore with a confused preference of practice to theory she let the\r\ndays go by; she felt that nothing was so imperative as the gain of\r\nprecious time. She shouldn\'t be able to stay with her father forever,\r\nbut she might now reap the benefit of having married her sister.\r\nMaggie\'s union had been built up round a small spare room. Concealed in\r\nthis apartment she might try to paint again, and abetted by the grateful\r\nMaggie--for Maggie at least was grateful--she might try to dispose of\r\nher work. She had not indeed struggled with a brush since her visit to\r\nWaterbath, where the sight of the family splotches had put her immensely\r\non her guard. Poynton moreover had been an impossible place for\r\nproducing; no active art could flourish there but a Buddhistic\r\ncontemplation. It had stripped its mistress clean of all feeble\r\naccomplishments; her hands were imbrued neither with ink nor with\r\nwater-color. Close to Fleda\'s present abode was the little shop of a man\r\nwho mounted and framed pictures and desolately dealt in artists\'\r\nmaterials. She sometimes paused before it to look at a couple of shy\r\nexperiments for which its dull window constituted publicity, small\r\nstudies placed there for sale and full of warning to a young lady\r\nwithout fortune and without talent. Some such young lady had brought\r\nthem forth in sorrow; some such young lady, to see if they had been\r\nsnapped up, had passed and repassed as helplessly as she herself was\r\ndoing. They never had been, they never would be, snapped up; yet they\r\nwere quite above the actual attainment of some other young ladies. It\r\nwas a matter of discipline with Fleda to take an occasional lesson from\r\nthem; besides which, when she now quitted the house, she had to look for\r\nreasons after she was out. The only place to find them was in the\r\nshop-windows. They made her feel like a servant-girl taking her\r\n"afternoon," but that didn\'t signify: perhaps some day she would\r\nresemble such a person still more closely. This continued a fortnight,\r\nat the end of which the feeling was suddenly dissipated. She had stopped\r\nas usual in the presence of the little pictures; then, as she turned\r\naway, she had found herself face to face with Owen Gereth.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of him two fresh waves passed quickly across her heart, one\r\nat the heels of the other. The first was an instant perception that this\r\nencounter was not an accident; the second a consciousness as prompt that\r\nthe best place for it was the street. She knew before he told her that\r\nhe had been to see her, and the next thing she knew was that he had had\r\ninformation from his mother. Her mind grasped these things while he said\r\nwith a smile: "I saw only your back, but I was sure. I was over the way.\r\nI\'ve been at your house."\r\n\r\n"How came you to know my house?" Fleda asked.\r\n\r\n"I like that!" he laughed. "How came you not to let me know that you\r\nwere there?"\r\n\r\nFleda, at this, thought it best also to laugh. "Since I didn\'t let you\r\nknow, why did you come?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say!" cried Owen. "Don\'t add insult to injury. Why in the world\r\ndidn\'t you let me know? I came because I want awfully to see you." He\r\nhesitated, then he added: "I got the tip from mother: she has written to\r\nme--fancy!"\r\n\r\nThey still stood where they had met. Fleda\'s instinct was to keep him\r\nthere; the more so that she could already see him take for granted that\r\nthey would immediately proceed together to her door. He rose before her\r\nwith a different air: he looked less ruffled and bruised than he had\r\ndone at Ricks, he showed a recovered freshness. Perhaps, however, this\r\nwas only because she had scarcely seen him at all as yet in London form,\r\nas he would have called it--"turned out" as he was turned out in town.\r\nIn the country, heated with the chase and splashed with the mire, he had\r\nalways rather reminded her of a picturesque peasant in national costume.\r\nThis costume, as Owen wore it, varied from day to day; it was as copious\r\nas the wardrobe of an actor; but it never failed of suggestions of the\r\nearth and the weather, the hedges and the ditches, the beasts and the\r\nbirds. There had been days when it struck her as all nature in one pair\r\nof boots. It didn\'t make him now another person that he was delicately\r\ndressed, shining and splendid--that he had a higher hat and light gloves\r\nwith black seams, and a spearlike umbrella; but it made him, she soon\r\ndecided, really handsomer, and that in turn gave him--for she never\r\ncould think of him, or indeed of some other things, without the aid of\r\nhis vocabulary--a tremendous pull. Yes, this was for the moment, as he\r\nlooked at her, the great fact of their situation--his pull was\r\ntremendous. She tried to keep the acknowledgement of it from trembling\r\nin her voice as she said to him with more surprise than she really felt:\r\n"You\'ve then reopened relations with her?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s she who has reopened them with me. I got her letter this morning.\r\nShe told me you were here and that she wished me to know it. She didn\'t\r\nsay much; she just gave me your address. I wrote her back, you know,\r\n\'Thanks no end. Shall go to-day.\' So we _are_ in correspondence again,\r\naren\'t we? She means of course that you\'ve something to tell me from\r\nher, eh? But if you have, why haven\'t you let a fellow know?" He waited\r\nfor no answer to this, he had so much to say. "At your house, just now,\r\nthey told me how long you\'ve been here. Haven\'t you known all the while\r\nthat I\'m counting the hours? I left a word for you--that I would be back\r\nat six; but I\'m awfully glad to have caught you so much sooner. You\r\ndon\'t mean to say you\'re not going home!" he exclaimed in dismay. "The\r\nyoung woman there told me you went out early."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been out a very short time," said Fleda, who had hung back with\r\nthe general purpose of making things difficult for him. The street would\r\nmake them difficult; she could trust the street. She reflected in time,\r\nhowever, that to betray to him she was afraid to admit him would give\r\nhim more a feeling of facility than of anything else. She moved on with\r\nhim after a moment, letting him direct their course to her door, which\r\nwas only round a corner: she considered as they went that it might not\r\nprove such a stroke to have been in London so long and yet not to have\r\ncalled him. She desired he should feel she was perfectly simple with\r\nhim, and there was no simplicity in that. None the less, on the steps of\r\nthe house, though she had a key, she rang the bell; and while they\r\nwaited together and she averted her face she looked straight into the\r\ndepths of what Mrs. Gereth had meant by giving him the "tip." This had\r\nbeen perfidious, had been monstrous of Mrs. Gereth, and Fleda wondered\r\nif her letter had contained only what Owen repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Owen and Fleda were in her father\'s little place and, among the\r\nbrandy-flasks and pen-wipers, still more disconcerted and divided, the\r\ngirl--to do something, though it would make him stay--had ordered tea,\r\nhe put the letter before her quite as if he had guessed her thought.\r\n"She\'s still a bit nasty--fancy!" He handed her the scrap of a note\r\nwhich he had pulled out of his pocket and from its envelope. "Fleda\r\nVetch," it ran, "is at 10 Raphael Road, West Kensington. Go to see her,\r\nand try, for God\'s sake, to cultivate a glimmer of intelligence." When\r\nin handing it back to him she took in his face she saw that its\r\nheightened color was the effect of his watching her read such an\r\nallusion to his want of wit. Fleda knew what it was an allusion to, and\r\nhis pathetic air of having received this buffet, tall and fine and kind\r\nas he stood there, made her conscious of not quite concealing her\r\nknowledge. For a minute she was kept silent by an angered sense of the\r\ntrick that had been played her. It was a trick because Fleda considered\r\nthere had been a covenant; and the trick consisted of Mrs. Gereth\'s\r\nhaving broken the spirit of their agreement while conforming in a\r\nfashion to the letter. Under the girl\'s menace of a complete rupture she\r\nhad been afraid to make of her secret the use she itched to make; but in\r\nthe course of these days of separation she had gathered pluck to hazard\r\nan indirect betrayal. Fleda measured her hesitations and the impulse\r\nwhich she had finally obeyed and which the continued procrastination of\r\nWaterbath had encouraged, had at last made irresistible. If in her\r\nhigh-handed manner of playing their game she had not named the thing\r\nhidden, she had named the hiding-place. It was over the sense of this\r\nwrong that Fleda\'s lips closed tight: she was afraid of aggravating her\r\ncase by some ejaculation that would make Owen prick up his ears. A\r\ngreat, quick effort, however, helped her to avoid the danger; with her\r\nconstant idea of keeping cool and repressing a visible flutter, she\r\nfound herself able to choose her words. Meanwhile he had exclaimed with\r\nhis uncomfortable laugh: "That\'s a good one for me, Miss Vetch, isn\'t\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you know by this time that your mother\'s very sharp," said\r\nFleda.\r\n\r\n"I think I can understand well enough when I know what\'s to be\r\nunderstood," the young man asserted. "But I hope you won\'t mind my\r\nsaying that you\'ve kept me pretty well in the dark about that. I\'ve been\r\nwaiting, waiting, waiting; so much has depended on your news. If you\'ve\r\nbeen working for me I\'m afraid it has been a thankless job. Can\'t she\r\nsay what she\'ll do, one way or the other? I can\'t tell in the least\r\nwhere I am, you know. I haven\'t really learnt from you, since I saw you\r\nthere, where _she_ is. You wrote me to be patient, and upon my soul I\r\nhave been. But I\'m afraid you don\'t quite realize what I\'m to be patient\r\nwith. At Waterbath, don\'t you know? I\'ve simply to account and answer\r\nfor the damned things. Mona looks at me and waits, and I, hang it, I\r\nlook at you and do the same." Fleda had gathered fuller confidence as he\r\ncontinued; so plain was it that she had succeeded in not dropping into\r\nhis mind the spark that might produce the glimmer invoked by his mother.\r\nBut even this fine assurance gave a start when, after an appealing\r\npause, he went on: "I hope, you know, that after all you\'re not keeping\r\nanything back from me."\r\n\r\nIn the full face of what she was keeping back such a hope could only\r\nmake her wince; but she was prompt with her explanations in proportion\r\nas she felt they failed to meet him. The smutty maid came in with\r\ntea-things, and Fleda, moving several objects, eagerly accepted the\r\ndiversion of arranging a place for them on one of the tables. "I\'ve been\r\ntrying to break your mother down because it has seemed there may be some\r\nchance of it. That\'s why I\'ve let you go on expecting it. She\'s too\r\nproud to veer round all at once, but I think I speak correctly in saying\r\nthat I\'ve made an impression."\r\n\r\nIn spite of ordering tea she had not invited him to sit down; she\r\nherself made a point of standing. He hovered by the window that looked\r\ninto Raphael Road; she kept at the other side of the room; the stunted\r\nslavey, gazing wide-eyed at the beautiful gentleman and either stupidly\r\nor cunningly bringing but one thing at a time, came and went between the\r\ntea-tray and the open door.\r\n\r\n"You pegged at her so hard?" Owen asked.\r\n\r\n"I explained to her fully your position and put before her much more\r\nstrongly than she liked what seemed to me her absolute duty."\r\n\r\nOwen waited a little. "And having done that, you departed?"\r\n\r\nFleda felt the full need of giving a reason for her departure; but at\r\nfirst she only said with cheerful frankness: "I departed."\r\n\r\nHer companion again looked at her in silence. "I thought you had gone to\r\nher for several months."\r\n\r\n"Well," Fleda replied, "I couldn\'t stay. I didn\'t like it. I didn\'t like\r\nit at all--I couldn\'t bear it," she went on. "In the midst of those\r\ntrophies of Poynton, living with them, touching them, using them, I felt\r\nas if I were backing her up. As I was not a bit of an accomplice, as I\r\nhate what she has done, I didn\'t want to be, even to the extent of the\r\nmere look of it--what is it you call such people?--an accessory after\r\nthe fact." There was something she kept back so rigidly that the joy of\r\nuttering the rest was double. She felt the sharpest need of giving him\r\nall the other truth. There was a matter as to which she had deceived\r\nhim, and there was a matter as to which she had deceived Mrs. Gereth,\r\nbut her lack of pleasure in deception as such came home to her now. She\r\nbusied herself with the tea and, to extend the occupation, cleared the\r\ntable still more, spreading out the coarse cups and saucers and the\r\nvulgar little plates. She was aware that she produced more confusion\r\nthan symmetry, but she was also aware that she was violently nervous.\r\nOwen tried to help her with something: this made rather for disorder.\r\n"My reason for not writing to you," she pursued, "was simply that I was\r\nhoping to hear more from Ricks. I\'ve waited from day to day for that."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve heard nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"Then what I understand," said Owen, "is that, practically, you and\r\nMummy have quarreled. And you\'ve done it--I mean you personally--for\r\n_me_."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, we haven\'t quarreled a bit!" Then with a smile: "We\'ve only\r\ndiverged."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve diverged uncommonly far!"--Owen laughed back. Fleda, with her\r\nhideous crockery and her father\'s collections, could conceive that these\r\nobjects, to her visitor\'s perception even more strongly than to her own,\r\nmeasured the length of the swing from Poynton and Ricks; she was aware\r\ntoo that her high standards figured vividly enough even to Owen\'s\r\nsimplicity to make him reflect that West Kensington was a tremendous\r\nfall. If she had fallen it was because she had acted for him. She was\r\nall the more content he should thus see she _had_ acted, as the cost of\r\nit, in his eyes, was none of her own showing. "What seems to have\r\nhappened," he exclaimed, "is that you\'ve had a row with her and yet not\r\nmoved her!"\r\n\r\nFleda considered a moment; she was full of the impression that,\r\nnotwithstanding her scant help, he saw his way clearer than he had seen\r\nit at Ricks. He might mean many things; and what if the many should mean\r\nin their turn only one? "The difficulty is, you understand, that she\r\ndoesn\'t really see into your situation." She hesitated. "She doesn\'t\r\ncomprehend why your marriage hasn\'t yet taken place."\r\n\r\nOwen stared. "Why, for the reason I told you: that Mona won\'t take\r\nanother step till mother has given full satisfaction. Everything must be\r\nthere. You see, everything _was_ there the day of that fatal visit."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s what I understood from you at Ricks," said Fleda; "but I\r\nhaven\'t repeated it to your mother." She had hated, at Ricks, to talk\r\nwith him about Mona, but now that scruple was swept away. If he could\r\nspeak of Mona\'s visit as fatal, she need at least not pretend not to\r\nnotice it. It made all the difference that she had tried to assist him\r\nand had failed: to give him any faith in her service she must give him\r\nall her reasons but one. She must give him, in other words, with a\r\ncorresponding omission, all Mrs. Gereth\'s. "You can easily see that, as\r\nshe dislikes your marriage, anything that may seem to make it less\r\ncertain works in her favor. Without my telling her, she has suspicions\r\nand views that are simply suggested by your delay. Therefore it didn\'t\r\nseem to me right to make them worse. By holding off long enough, she\r\nthinks she may put an end to your engagement. If Mona\'s waiting, she\r\nbelieves she may at last tire Mona out." That, in all conscience, Fleda\r\nfelt was lucid enough.\r\n\r\nSo the young man, following her attentively, appeared equally to feel.\r\n"So far as that goes," he promptly declared, "she _has_ at last tired\r\nMona out." He uttered the words with a strange approach to hilarity.\r\n\r\nFleda\'s surprise at this aberration left her a moment looking at him.\r\n"Do you mean your marriage is off?"\r\n\r\nOwen answered with a kind of gay despair. "God knows, Miss Vetch, where\r\nor when or what my marriage is! If it isn\'t \'off,\' it certainly, at the\r\npoint things have reached, isn\'t _on_. I haven\'t seen Mona for ten days,\r\nand for a week I haven\'t heard from her. She used to write me every\r\nweek, don\'t you know? She won\'t budge from Waterbath, and I haven\'t\r\nbudged from town." Then he suddenly broke out: "If she _does_ chuck me,\r\nwill mother come round?"\r\n\r\nFleda, at this, felt that her heroism had come to its real test--felt\r\nthat in telling him the truth she should effectively raise a hand to\r\npush his impediment out of the way. Was the knowledge that such a motion\r\nwould probably dispose forever of Mona capable of yielding to the\r\nconception of still giving her every chance she was entitled to? That\r\nconception was heroic, but at the same moment it reminded Fleda of the\r\nplace it had held in her plan, she was also reminded of the not less\r\nurgent claim of the truth. Ah, the truth--there was a limit to the\r\nimpunity with which one could juggle with it! Wasn\'t what she had most\r\nto remember the fact that Owen had a right to his property and that he\r\nhad also her vow to stand by him in the effort to recover it? How did\r\nshe stand by him if she hid from him the single way to recover it of\r\nwhich she was quite sure? For an instant that seemed to her the fullest\r\nof her life she debated. "Yes," she said at last, "if your marriage is\r\nreally abandoned, she will give up everything she has taken."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what makes Mona hesitate!" Owen honestly exclaimed. "I mean\r\nthe idea that I shall get back the things only if she gives me up."\r\n\r\nFleda thought an instant. "You mean makes her hesitate to keep you--not\r\nhesitate to renounce you?"\r\n\r\nOwen looked a trifle bewildered. "She doesn\'t see the use of hanging on,\r\nas I haven\'t even yet put the matter into legal hands. She\'s awfully\r\nkeen about that, and awfully disgusted that I don\'t. She says it\'s the\r\nonly real way, and she thinks I\'m afraid to take it. She has given me\r\ntime and then has given me again more. She says I give Mummy too much.\r\nShe says I\'m a muff to go pottering on. That\'s why she\'s drawing off so\r\nhard, don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see very clearly. Of course you must give her what you offered\r\nher; of course you must keep your word. There must be no mistake about\r\n_that_!" the girl declared.\r\n\r\nOwen\'s bewilderment visibly increased. "You think, then, as she does,\r\nthat I _must_ send down the police?"\r\n\r\nThe mixture of reluctance and dependence in this made her feel how much\r\nshe was failing him. She had the sense of "chucking" him too. "No, no,\r\nnot yet!" she said, though she had really no other and no better course\r\nto prescribe. "Doesn\'t it occur to you," she asked in a moment, "that if\r\nMona is, as you say, drawing away, she may have, in doing so, a very\r\nhigh motive? She knows the immense value of all the objects detained by\r\nyour mother, and to restore the spoils of Poynton she is ready--is that\r\nit!--to make a sacrifice. The sacrifice is that of an engagement she had\r\nentered upon with joy."\r\n\r\nOwen had been blank a moment before, but he followed this argument with\r\nsuccess--a success so immediate that it enabled him to produce with\r\ndecision: "Ah, she\'s not that sort! She wants them herself," he added;\r\n"she wants to feel they\'re hers; she doesn\'t care whether I have them or\r\nnot! And if she can\'t get them she doesn\'t want _me_. If she can\'t get\r\nthem she doesn\'t want anything at all."\r\n\r\nThis was categoric; Fleda drank it in. "She takes such an interest in\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\n"So it appears."\r\n\r\n"So much that they\'re _all_, and that she can let everything else\r\nabsolutely depend upon them?"\r\n\r\nOwen weighed her question as if he felt the responsibility of his\r\nanswer. But that answer came in a moment, and, as Fleda could see, out\r\nof a wealth of memory. "She never wanted them particularly till they\r\nseemed to be in danger. Now she has an idea about them; and when she\r\ngets hold of an idea--Oh dear me!" He broke off, pausing and looking\r\naway as with a sense of the futility of expression: it was the first\r\ntime Fleda had ever heard him explain a matter so pointedly or embark at\r\nall on a generalization. It was striking, it was touching to her, as he\r\nfaltered, that he appeared but half capable of floating his\r\ngeneralization to the end. The girl, however, was so far competent to\r\nfill up his blank as that she had divined, on the occasion of Mona\'s\r\nvisit to Poynton, what would happen in the event of the accident at\r\nwhich he glanced. She had there with her own eyes seen Owen\'s betrothed\r\nget hold of an idea. "I say, you know, _do_ give me some tea!" he went\r\non irrelevantly and familiarly.\r\n\r\nHer profuse preparations had all this time had no sequel, and, with a\r\nlaugh that she felt to be awkward, she hastily complied with his\r\nrequest. "It\'s sure to be horrid," she said; "we don\'t have at all good\r\nthings." She offered him also bread and butter, of which he partook,\r\nholding his cup and saucer in his other hand and moving slowly about the\r\nroom. She poured herself a cup, but not to take it; after which, without\r\nwanting it, she began to eat a small stale biscuit. She was struck with\r\nthe extinction of the unwillingness she had felt at Ricks to contribute\r\nto the bandying between them of poor Mona\'s name; and under this\r\ninfluence she presently resumed: "Am I to understand that she engaged\r\nherself to marry you without caring for you?"\r\n\r\nOwen looked out into Raphael Road. "She _did_ care for me awfully. But\r\nshe can\'t stand the strain."\r\n\r\n"The strain of what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of the whole wretched thing."\r\n\r\n"The whole thing has indeed been wretched, and I can easily conceive its\r\neffect upon her," Fleda said.\r\n\r\nHer visitor turned sharp round. "You _can_?" There was a light in his\r\nstrong stare. "You can understand it\'s spoiling her temper and making\r\nher come down on _me_? She behaves as if I were of no use to her at\r\nall!"\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated. "She\'s rankling under the sense of her wrong."\r\n\r\n"Well, was it _I_, pray, who perpetrated the wrong? Ain\'t I doing what I\r\ncan to get the thing arranged?"\r\n\r\nThe ring of his question made his anger at Mona almost resemble for a\r\nminute an anger at Fleda; and this resemblance in turn caused our young\r\nlady to observe how handsome he looked when he spoke, for the first time\r\nin her hearing, with that degree of heat, and used, also for the first\r\ntime, such a term as "perpetrated." In addition, his challenge rendered\r\nstill more vivid to her the mere flimsiness of her own aid. "Yes, you\'ve\r\nbeen perfect," she said. "You\'ve had a most difficult part. You\'ve _had_\r\nto show tact and patience, as well as firmness, with your mother, and\r\nyou\'ve strikingly shown them. It\'s I who, quite unintentionally, have\r\ndeceived you. I haven\'t helped you at all to your remedy."\r\n\r\n"Well, you wouldn\'t at all events have ceased to like me, would you?"\r\nOwen demanded. It evidently mattered to him to know if she really\r\njustified Mona. "I mean of course if you _had_ liked me--liked me as\r\n_she_ liked me," he explained.\r\n\r\nFleda looked this inquiry in the face only long enough to recognize\r\nthat, in her embarrassment, she must take instant refuge in a superior\r\none. "I can answer that better if I know how kind to her you\'ve been.\r\n_Have_ you been kind to her?" she asked as simply as she could.\r\n\r\n"Why, rather, Miss Vetch!" Owen declared. "I\'ve done every blessed thing\r\nshe wished. I rushed down to Ricks, as you saw, with fire and sword, and\r\nthe day after that I went to see her at Waterbath." At this point he\r\nchecked himself, though it was just the point at which her interest\r\ndeepened. A different look had come into his face as he put down his\r\nempty teacup. "But why should I tell you such things, for any good it\r\ndoes me? I gather that you\'ve no suggestion to make me now except that I\r\nshall request my solicitor to act. _Shall_ I request him to act?"\r\n\r\nFleda scarcely heard his words; something new had suddenly come into her\r\nmind. "When you went to Waterbath after seeing me," she asked, "did you\r\ntell her all about that?"\r\n\r\nOwen looked conscious. "All about it?"\r\n\r\n"That you had had a long talk with me, without seeing your mother at\r\nall?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I told her exactly, and that you had been most awfully kind,\r\nand that I had placed the whole thing in your hands."\r\n\r\nFleda was silent a moment. "Perhaps that displeased her," she at last\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n"It displeased her fearfully," said Owen, looking very queer.\r\n\r\n"Fearfully?" broke from the girl. Somehow, at the word, she was\r\nstartled.\r\n\r\n"She wanted to know what right you had to meddle. She said you were not\r\nhonest."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Fleda cried, with a long wail. Then she controlled herself. "I\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"She abused you, and I defended you. She denounced you--"\r\n\r\nShe checked him with a gesture. "Don\'t tell me what she did!" She had\r\ncolored up to her eyes, where, as with the effect of a blow in the face,\r\nshe quickly felt the tears gathering. It was a sudden drop in her great\r\nflight, a shock to her attempt to watch over what Mona was entitled to.\r\nWhile she had been straining her very soul in this attempt, the object\r\nof her magnanimity had been pronouncing her "not honest." She took it\r\nall in, however, and after an instant was able to speak with a smile.\r\nShe would not have been surprised to learn, indeed, that her smile was\r\nstrange. "You had said a while ago that your mother and I quarreled\r\nabout you. It\'s much more true that you and Mona have quarreled about\r\n_me_."\r\n\r\nOwen hesitated, but at last he brought it out. "What I mean to say is,\r\ndon\'t you know, that Mona, if you don\'t mind my saying so, has taken it\r\ninto her head to be jealous."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Fleda. "Well, I dare say our conferences have looked very\r\nodd."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve looked very beautiful, and they\'ve been very beautiful. Oh,\r\nI\'ve told her the sort you are!" the young man pursued.\r\n\r\n"That of course hasn\'t made her love me better."\r\n\r\n"No, nor love me," said Owen. "Of course, you know, she says she loves\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"And do you say you love her?"\r\n\r\n"I say nothing else--I say it all the while. I said it the other day a\r\ndozen times." Fleda made no immediate rejoinder to this, and before she\r\ncould choose one he repeated his question of a moment before. "_Am_ I to\r\ntell my solicitor to act?"\r\n\r\nShe had at that moment turned away from this solution, precisely because\r\nshe saw in it the great chance of her secret. If she should determine\r\nhim to adopt it she might put out her hand and take him. It would shut\r\nin Mrs. Gereth\'s face the open door of surrender: she would flare up and\r\nfight, flying the flag of a passionate, an heroic defense. The case\r\nwould obviously go against her, but the proceedings would last longer\r\nthan Mona\'s patience or Owen\'s propriety. With a formal rupture he would\r\nbe at large; and she had only to tighten her fingers round the string\r\nthat would raise the curtain on that scene. "You tell me you \'say\' you\r\nlove her, but is there nothing more in it than your saying so? You\r\nwouldn\'t say so, would you, if it\'s not true? What in the world has\r\nbecome, in so short a time, of the affection that led to your\r\nengagement?"\r\n\r\n"The deuce knows what has become of it, Miss Vetch!" Owen cried. "It\r\nseemed all to go to pot as this horrid struggle came on." He was close\r\nto her now, and, with his face lighted again by the relief of it, he\r\nlooked all his helpless history into her eyes. "As I saw you and noticed\r\nyou more, as I knew you better and better, I felt less and less--I\r\ncouldn\'t help it--about anything or any one else. I wished I had known\r\nyou sooner--I knew I should have liked you better than any one in the\r\nworld. But it wasn\'t you who made the difference," he eagerly continued,\r\n"and I was awfully determined to stick to Mona to the death. It was she\r\nherself who made it, upon my soul, by the state she got into, the way\r\nshe sulked, the way she took things, and the way she let me have it! She\r\ndestroyed our prospects and our happiness, upon my honor. She made just\r\nthe same smash of them as if she had kicked over that tea-table. She\r\nwanted to know all the while what was passing between us, between you\r\nand me; and she wouldn\'t take my solemn assurance that nothing was\r\npassing but what might have directly passed between me and old Mummy.\r\nShe said a pretty girl like you was a nice old Mummy for me, and, if\r\nyou\'ll believe it, she never called you anything else but that. I\'ll be\r\nhanged if I haven\'t been good, haven\'t I? I haven\'t breathed a breath of\r\nany sort to you, have I? You\'d have been down on me hard if I had,\r\nwouldn\'t you? You\'re down on me pretty hard as it is, I think, aren\'t\r\nyou? But I don\'t care what you say now, or what Mona says, either, or a\r\nsingle rap what any one says: she has given me at last, by her\r\nconfounded behavior, a right to speak out, to utter the way I feel about\r\nit. The way I feel about it, don\'t you know, is that it had all better\r\ncome to an end. You ask me if I don\'t love her, and I suppose it\'s\r\nnatural enough you should. But you ask it at the very moment I\'m half\r\nmad to say to you that there\'s only one person on the whole earth I\r\n_really_ love, and that that person--" Here Owen pulled up short, and\r\nFleda wondered if it was from the effect of his perceiving, through the\r\nclosed door, the sound of steps and voices on the landing of the stairs.\r\nShe had caught this sound herself with surprise and a vague uneasiness:\r\nit was not an hour at which her father ever came in, and there was no\r\npresent reason why she should have a visitor. She had a fear, which\r\nafter a few seconds deepened: a visitor was at hand; the visitor would\r\nbe simply Mrs. Gereth. That lady wished for a near view of the\r\nconsequence of her note to Owen. Fleda straightened herself with the\r\ninstant thought that if this was what Mrs. Gereth desired Mrs. Gereth\r\nshould have it in a form not to be mistaken. Owen\'s pause was the matter\r\nof a moment, but during that moment our young couple stood with their\r\neyes holding each other\'s eyes and their ears catching the suggestion,\r\nstill through the door, of a murmured conference in the hall. Fleda had\r\nbegun to make the movement to cut it short when Owen stopped her with a\r\ngrasp of her arm. "You\'re surely able to guess," he said, with his voice\r\ndropped and her arm pressed as she had never known such a drop or such a\r\npressure--"you\'re surely able to guess the one person on earth I love?"\r\n\r\nThe handle of the door turned, and Fleda had only time to jerk at him:\r\n"Your mother!"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the smutty maid, edging in, announced "Mrs.\r\nBrigstock!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigstock, in the doorway, stood looking from one of the occupants\r\nof the room to the other; then they saw her eyes attach themselves to a\r\nsmall object that had lain hitherto unnoticed on the carpet. This was\r\nthe biscuit of which, on giving Owen his tea, Fleda had taken a\r\nperfunctory nibble: she had immediately laid it on the table, and that\r\nsubsequently, in some precipitate movement, she should have brushed it\r\noff was doubtless a sign of the agitation that possessed her. For Mrs.\r\nBrigstock there was apparently more in it than met the eye. Owen at any\r\nrate picked it up, and Fleda felt as if he were removing the traces of\r\nsome scene that the newspapers would have characterized as lively. Mrs.\r\nBrigstock clearly took in also the sprawling tea-things and the mark as\r\nof high water in the full faces of her young friends. These elements\r\nmade the little place a vivid picture of intimacy. A minute was filled\r\nby Fleda\'s relief at finding her visitor not to be Mrs. Gereth, and a\r\nlonger space by the ensuing sense of what was really more compromising\r\nin the actual apparition. It dimly occurred to her that the lady of\r\nRicks had also written to Waterbath. Not only had Mrs. Brigstock never\r\npaid her a call, but Fleda would have been unable to figure her so\r\nemployed. A year before the girl had spent a day under her roof, but\r\nnever feeling that Mrs. Brigstock regarded this as constituting a bond.\r\nShe had never stayed in any house but Poynton where the imagination of a\r\nbond, one way or the other, prevailed. After the first astonishment she\r\ndashed gayly at her guest, emphasizing her welcome and wondering how her\r\nwhereabouts had become known at Waterbath. Had not Mrs. Brigstock\r\nquitted that residence for the very purpose of laying her hand on the\r\nassociate of Mrs. Gereth\'s misconduct? The spirit in which this hand was\r\nto be laid our young lady was yet to ascertain; but she was a person who\r\ncould think ten thoughts at once--a circumstance which, even putting her\r\npresent plight at its worst, gave her a great advantage over a person\r\nwho required easy conditions for dealing even with one. The very\r\nvibration of the air, however, told her that whatever Mrs. Brigstock\'s\r\nspirit might originally have been, it had been sharply affected by the\r\nsight of Owen. He was essentially a surprise: she had reckoned with\r\neverything that concerned him but his presence. With that, in awkward\r\nsilence, she was reckoning now, as Fleda could see, while she effected\r\nwith friendly aid an embarrassed transit to the sofa. Owen would be\r\nuseless, would be deplorable: that aspect of the case Fleda had taken in\r\nas well. Another aspect was that he would admire her, adore her, exactly\r\nin proportion as she herself should rise gracefully superior. Fleda felt\r\nfor the first time free to let herself "go," as Mrs. Gereth had said,\r\nand she was full of the sense that to "go" meant now to aim straight at\r\nthe effect of moving Owen to rapture at her simplicity and tact. It was\r\nher impression that he had no positive dislike of Mona\'s mother; but she\r\ncouldn\'t entertain that notion without a glimpse of the implication that\r\nhe had a positive dislike of Mrs. Brigstock\'s daughter. Mona\'s mother\r\ndeclined tea, declined a better seat, declined a cushion, declined to\r\nremove her boa: Fleda guessed that she had not come on purpose to be\r\ndry, but that the voice of the invaded room had itself given her the\r\nhint.\r\n\r\n"I just came on the mere chance," she said. "Mona found yesterday,\r\nsomewhere, the card of invitation to your sister\'s marriage that you\r\nsent us, or your father sent us, some time ago. We couldn\'t be\r\npresent--it was impossible; but as it had this address on it I said to\r\nmyself that I might find you here."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad to be at home," Fleda responded.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that doesn\'t happen very often, does it?" Mrs. Brigstock looked\r\nround afresh at Fleda\'s home.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I came back from Ricks last week. I shall be here now till I don\'t\r\nknow when."\r\n\r\n"We thought it very likely you would have come back. We knew of course\r\nof your having been at Ricks. If I didn\'t find you I thought I might\r\nperhaps find Mr. Vetch," Mrs. Brigstock went on.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry he\'s out. He\'s always out--all day long."\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigstock\'s round eyes grew rounder. "All day long?"\r\n\r\n"All day long," Fleda smiled.\r\n\r\n"Leaving you quite to yourself?"\r\n\r\n"A good deal to myself, but a little, to-day, as you see, to Mr.\r\nGereth,--" and the girl looked at Owen to draw him into their\r\nsociability. For Mrs. Brigstock he had immediately sat down; but the\r\nmovement had not corrected the sombre stiffness taking possession of him\r\nat the sight of her. Before he found a response to the appeal addressed\r\nto him Fleda turned again to her other visitor. "Is there any purpose\r\nfor which you would like my father to call on you?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigstock received this question as if it were not to be\r\nunguardedly answered; upon which Owen intervened with pale irrelevance:\r\n"I wrote to Mona this morning of Miss Vetch\'s being in town; but of\r\ncourse the letter hadn\'t arrived when you left home."\r\n\r\n"No, it hadn\'t arrived. I came up for the night--I\'ve several matters to\r\nattend to." Then looking with an intention of fixedness from one of her\r\ncompanions to the other, "I\'m afraid I\'ve interrupted your\r\nconversation," Mrs. Brigstock said. She spoke without effectual point,\r\nhad the air of merely announcing the fact. Fleda had not yet been\r\nconfronted with the question of the sort of person Mrs. Brigstock was;\r\nshe had only been confronted with the question of the sort of person\r\nMrs. Gereth scorned her for being. She was really, somehow, no sort of\r\nperson at all, and it came home to Fleda that if Mrs. Gereth could see\r\nher at this moment she would scorn her more than ever. She had a face of\r\nwhich it was impossible to say anything but that it was pink, and a mind\r\nthat it would be possible to describe only if one had been able to mark\r\nit in a similar fashion. As nature had made this organ neither green nor\r\nblue nor yellow, there was nothing to know it by: it strayed and bleated\r\nlike an unbranded sheep. Fleda felt for it at this moment much of the\r\nkindness of compassion, since Mrs. Brigstock had brought it with her to\r\ndo something for her that she regarded as delicate. Fleda was quite\r\nprepared to help it to perform, if she should be able to gather what it\r\nwanted to do. What she gathered, however, more and more, was that it\r\nwanted to do something different from what it had wanted to do in\r\nleaving Waterbath. There was still nothing to enlighten her more\r\nspecifically in the way her visitor continued: "You must be very much\r\ntaken up. I believe you quite espouse his dreadful quarrel."\r\n\r\nFleda vaguely demurred. "His dreadful quarrel?"\r\n\r\n"About the contents of the house. Aren\'t you looking after them for\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"She knows how awfully kind you\'ve been to me," Owen said. He showed\r\nsuch discomfiture that he really gave away their situation; and Fleda\r\nfound herself divided between the hope that he would take leave and the\r\nwish that he should see the whole of what the occasion might enable her\r\nto bring to pass for him.\r\n\r\nShe explained to Mrs. Brigstock. "Mrs. Gereth, at Ricks, the other day,\r\nasked me particularly to see him for her."\r\n\r\n"And did she ask you also particularly to see him here in town?" Mrs.\r\nBrigstock\'s hideous bonnet seemed to argue for the unsophisticated\r\ntruth; and it was on Fleda\'s lips to reply that such had indeed been\r\nMrs. Gereth\'s request. But she checked herself, and before she could say\r\nanything else Owen had addressed their companion.\r\n\r\n"I made a point of letting Mona know that I should be here, don\'t you\r\nsee? That\'s exactly what I wrote her this morning."\r\n\r\n"She would have had no doubt you would be here, if you had a chance,"\r\nMrs. Brigstock returned. "If your letter had arrived it might have\r\nprepared me for finding you here at tea. In that case I certainly\r\nwouldn\'t have come."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad, then, it didn\'t arrive. Shouldn\'t you like him to go?" Fleda\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigstock looked at Owen and considered: nothing showed in her face\r\nbut that it turned a deeper pink. "I should like him to go with _me_."\r\nThere was no menace in her tone, but she evidently knew what she wanted.\r\nAs Owen made no response to this Fleda glanced at him to invite him to\r\nassent; then, for fear that he wouldn\'t, and would thereby make his case\r\nworse, she took upon herself to declare that she was sure he would be\r\nvery glad to meet such a wish. She had no sooner spoken than she felt\r\nthat the words had a bad effect of intimacy: she had answered for him as\r\nif she had been his wife. Mrs. Brigstock continued to regard him as if\r\nshe had observed nothing, and she continued to address Fleda: "I\'ve not\r\nseen him for a long time--I\'ve particular things to say to him."\r\n\r\n"So have I things to say to you, Mrs. Brigstock!" Owen interjected. With\r\nthis he took up his hat as if for an immediate departure.\r\n\r\nThe other visitor meanwhile turned to Fleda. "What is Mrs. Gereth going\r\nto do?"\r\n\r\n"Is that what you came to ask me?" Fleda demanded.\r\n\r\n"That and several other things."\r\n\r\n"Then you had much better let Mr. Gereth go, and stay by yourself and\r\nmake me a pleasant visit. You can talk with him when you like, but it is\r\nthe first time you\'ve been to see me."\r\n\r\nThis appeal had evidently a certain effect; Mrs. Brigstock visibly\r\nwavered. "I can\'t talk with him whenever I like," she returned; "he\r\nhasn\'t been near us since I don\'t know when. But there are things that\r\nhave brought me here."\r\n\r\n"They are not things of any importance," Owen, to Fleda\'s surprise,\r\nsuddenly asserted. He had not at first taken up Mrs. Brigstock\'s\r\nexpression of a wish to carry him off: Fleda could see that the instinct\r\nat the bottom of this was that of standing by her, of seeming not to\r\nabandon her. But abruptly, all his soreness working within him, it had\r\nstruck him that he should abandon her still more if he should leave her\r\nto be dealt with by her other visitor. "You must allow me to say, you\r\nknow, Mrs. Brigstock, that I don\'t think you should come down on Miss\r\nVetch about anything. It\'s very good of her to take the smallest\r\ninterest in us and our horrid little squabble. If you want to talk about\r\nit, talk about it with _me_." He was flushed with the idea of protecting\r\nFleda, of exhibiting his consideration for her. "I don\'t like your\r\ncross-questioning her, don\'t you see? She\'s as straight as a die: _I_\'ll\r\ntell you all about her!" he declared with an excited laugh. "Please come\r\noff with me and let her alone."\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigstock, at this, became vivid at once; Fleda thought she looked\r\nmost peculiar. She stood straight up, with a queer distention of her\r\nwhole person and of everything in her face but her mouth, which she\r\ngathered into a small, tight orifice. Fleda was painfully divided; her\r\njoy was deep within, but it was more relevant to the situation that she\r\nshould not appear to associate herself with the tone of familiarity in\r\nwhich Owen addressed a lady who had been, and was perhaps still, about\r\nto become his mother-in-law. She laid on Mrs. Brigstock\'s arm a\r\nrepressive hand. Mrs. Brigstock, however, had already exclaimed on her\r\nhaving so wonderful a defender. "He speaks, upon my word, as if I had\r\ncome here to be rude to you!"\r\n\r\nAt this, grasping her hard, Fleda laughed; then she achieved the exploit\r\nof delicately kissing her. "I\'m not in the least afraid to be alone with\r\nyou, or of your tearing me to pieces. I\'ll answer any question that you\r\ncan possibly dream of putting to me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m the proper person to answer Mrs. Brigstock\'s questions," Owen broke\r\nin again, "and I\'m not a bit less ready to meet them than you are." He\r\nwas firmer than she had ever seen him: it was as if she had not known he\r\ncould be so firm.\r\n\r\n"But she\'ll only have been here a few minutes. What sort of a visit is\r\nthat?" Fleda cried.\r\n\r\n"It has lasted long enough for my purpose. There was something I wanted\r\nto know, but I think I know it now."\r\n\r\n"Anything you don\'t know I dare say I can tell you!" Owen observed as he\r\nimpatiently smoothed his hat with the cuff of his coat.\r\n\r\nFleda by this time desired immensely to keep his companion, but she saw\r\nshe could do so only at the cost of provoking on his part a further\r\nexhibition of the sheltering attitude, which he exaggerated precisely\r\nbecause it was the first thing, since he had begun to "like" her, that\r\nhe had been able frankly to do for her. It was not in her interest that\r\nMrs. Brigstock should be more struck than she already was with that\r\nbenevolence. "There may be things you know that I don\'t," she presently\r\nsaid to her, with a smile. "But I\'ve a sort of sense that you\'re\r\nlaboring under some great mistake."\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigstock, at this, looked into her eyes more deeply and yearningly\r\nthan she had supposed Mrs. Brigstock could look; it was the flicker of a\r\ncertain willingness to give her a chance. Owen, however, quickly spoiled\r\neverything. "Nothing is more probable than that Mrs. Brigstock is doing\r\nwhat you say; but there\'s no one in the world to whom you owe an\r\nexplanation. I may owe somebody one--I dare say I do; but not you, no!"\r\n\r\n"But what if there\'s one that it\'s no difficulty at all for me to give?"\r\nFleda inquired. "I\'m sure that\'s the only one Mrs. Brigstock came to\r\nask, if she came to ask any at all."\r\n\r\nAgain the good lady looked hard at her young hostess. "I came, I\r\nbelieve, Fleda, just, you know, to plead with you."\r\n\r\nFleda, with a bright face, hesitated a moment. "As if I were one of\r\nthose bad women in a play?"\r\n\r\nThe remark was disastrous. Mrs. Brigstock, on whom her brightness was\r\nlost, evidently thought it singularly free. She turned away, as from a\r\npresence that had really defined itself as objectionable, and Fleda had\r\na vain sense that her good humor, in which there was an idea, was taken\r\nfor impertinence, or at least for levity. Her allusion was improper,\r\neven if she herself wasn\'t; Mrs. Brigstock\'s emotion simplified: it came\r\nto the same thing. "I\'m quite ready," that lady said to Owen rather\r\nmildly and woundedly. "I do want to speak to you very much."\r\n\r\n"I\'m completely at your service." Owen held out his hand to Fleda.\r\n"Good-bye, Miss Vetch. I hope to see you again to-morrow." He opened the\r\ndoor for Mrs. Brigstock, who passed before the girl with an oblique,\r\naverted salutation. Owen and Fleda, while he stood at the door, then\r\nfaced each other darkly and without speaking. Their eyes met once more\r\nfor a long moment, and she was conscious there was something in hers\r\nthat the darkness didn\'t quench, that he had never seen before and that\r\nhe was perhaps never to see again. He stayed long enough to take it--to\r\ntake it with a sombre stare that just showed the dawn of wonder; then he\r\nfollowed Mrs. Brigstock out of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had uttered the hope that he should see her the next day, but Fleda\r\ncould easily reflect that he wouldn\'t see her if she were not there to\r\nbe seen. If there was a thing in the world she desired at that moment,\r\nit was that the next day should have no point of resemblance with the\r\nday that had just elapsed. She accordingly aspired to an absence: she\r\nwould go immediately down to Maggie. She ran out that evening and\r\ntelegraphed to her sister, and in the morning she quitted London by an\r\nearly train. She required for this step no reason but the sense of\r\nnecessity. It was a strong personal need; she wished to interpose\r\nsomething, and there was nothing she could interpose but distance, but\r\ntime. If Mrs. Brigstock had to deal with Owen she would allow Mrs.\r\nBrigstock the chance. To be there, to be in the midst of it, was the\r\nreverse of what she craved: she had already been more in the midst of it\r\nthan had ever entered into her plan. At any rate she had renounced her\r\nplan; she had no plan now but the plan of separation. This was to\r\nabandon Owen, to give up the fine office of helping him back to his own;\r\nbut when she had undertaken that office she had not foreseen that Mrs.\r\nGereth would defeat it by a manoeuvre so simple. The scene at her\r\nfather\'s rooms had extinguished all offices, and the scene at her\r\nfather\'s rooms was of Mrs. Gereth\'s producing. Owen, at all events, must\r\nnow act for himself: he had obligations to meet, he had satisfactions to\r\ngive, and Fleda fairly ached with the wish that he might be equal to\r\nthem. She never knew the extent of her tenderness for him till she\r\nbecame conscious of the present force of her desire that he should be\r\nsuperior, be perhaps even sublime. She obscurely made out that\r\nsuperiority, that sublimity, mightn\'t after all be fatal. She closed her\r\neyes and lived for a day or two in the mere beauty of confidence. It was\r\nwith her on the short journey; it was with her at Maggie\'s; it glorified\r\nthe mean little house in the stupid little town. Owen had grown larger\r\nto her: he would do, like a man, whatever he should have to do. He\r\nwouldn\'t be weak--not as she was: she herself was weak exceedingly.\r\n\r\nArranging her few possessions in Maggie\'s fewer receptacles, she caught\r\na glimpse of the bright side of the fact that her old things were not\r\nsuch a problem as Mrs. Gereth\'s. Picking her way with Maggie through the\r\nlocal puddles, diving with her into smelly cottages and supporting her,\r\nat smellier shops, in firmness over the weight of joints and the taste\r\nof cheese, it was still her own secret that was universally inter-woven\r\nIn the puddles, the cottages, the shops she was comfortably alone with\r\nit; that comfort prevailed even while, at the evening meal, her\r\nbrother-in-law invited her attention to a diagram, drawn with a fork on\r\ntoo soiled a tablecloth, of the scandalous drains of the Convalescent\r\nHome. To be alone with it she had come away from Ricks; and now she knew\r\nthat to be alone with it she had come away from London. This advantage\r\nwas of course menaced, but not immediately destroyed, by the arrival, on\r\nthe second day, of the note she had been sure she should receive from\r\nOwen. He had gone to West Kensington and found her flown, but he had got\r\nher address from the little maid and then hurried to a club and written\r\nto her. "Why have you left me just when I want you most?" he demanded.\r\nThe next words, it was true, were more reassuring on the question of his\r\nsteadiness. "I don\'t know what your reason may be," they went on, "nor\r\nwhy you\'ve not left a line for me; but I don\'t think you can feel that I\r\ndid anything yesterday that it wasn\'t right for me to do. As regards\r\nMrs. Brigstock, certainly, I just felt what was right and I did it. She\r\nhad no business whatever to attack you that way, and I should have been\r\nashamed if I had left her there to worry you. I won\'t have you worried\r\nby any one; no one shall be disagreeable to you but me. I didn\'t mean to\r\nbe so yesterday, and I don\'t to-day; but I\'m perfectly free now to want\r\nyou, and I want you much more than you\'ve allowed me to explain. You\'ll\r\nsee if I\'m not all right, if you\'ll let me come to you. Don\'t be\r\nafraid--I\'ll not hurt you nor trouble you. I give you my honor I\'ll not\r\nhurt any one. Only I _must_ see you, on what I had to say to Mrs. B. She\r\nwas nastier than I thought she could be, but I\'m behaving like an angel.\r\nI assure you I\'m all right--that\'s exactly what I want you to see. You\r\nowe me something, you know, for what you said you would do and haven\'t\r\ndone; what your departure without a word gives me to understand--doesn\'t\r\nit?--that you definitely can\'t do. Don\'t simply forsake me. See me, if\r\nyou only see me once. I shan\'t wait for any leave--I shall come down\r\nto-morrow. I\'ve been looking into trains and find there\'s something that\r\nwill bring me down just after lunch and something very good for getting\r\nme back. I won\'t stop long. For God\'s sake, be there."\r\n\r\nThis communication arrived in the morning, but Fleda would still have\r\nhad time to wire a protest. She debated on that alternative; then she\r\nread the note over and found in one phrase an exact statement of her\r\nduty. Owen\'s simplicity had expressed it, and her subtlety had nothing\r\nto answer. She owed him something for her obvious failure, and what she\r\nowed him was to receive him. If indeed she had known he would make this\r\nattempt she might have been held to have gained nothing by her flight.\r\nWell, she had gained what she had gained--she had gained the interval.\r\nShe had no compunction for the greater trouble she should give the young\r\nman; it was now doubtless right that he should have as much trouble as\r\npossible. Maggie, who thought she was in her confidence, but was\r\nimmensely not, had reproached her for having left Mrs. Gereth, and\r\nMaggie was just in this proportion gratified to hear of the visitor with\r\nwhom, early in the afternoon, she would have to ask to be left alone.\r\nMaggie liked to see far, and now she could sit upstairs and rake the\r\nwhole future. She had known that, as she familiarly said, there was\r\nsomething the matter with Fleda, and the value of that knowledge was\r\naugmented by the fact that there was apparently also something the\r\nmatter with Mr. Gereth.\r\n\r\nFleda, downstairs, learned soon enough what this was. It was simply\r\nthat, as he announced the moment he stood before her, he was now all\r\nright. When she asked him what he meant by that state he replied that he\r\nmeant he could practically regard himself henceforth as a free man: he\r\nhad had at West Kensington, as soon as they got into the street, such a\r\nhorrid scene with Mrs. Brigstock.\r\n\r\n"I knew what she wanted to say to me: that\'s why I was determined to get\r\nher off. I knew I shouldn\'t like it, but I was perfectly prepared," said\r\nOwen. "She brought it out as soon as we got round the corner; she asked\r\nme point-blank if I was in love with you."\r\n\r\n"And what did you say to that?"\r\n\r\n"That it was none of her business."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Fleda, "I\'m not so sure!"\r\n\r\n"Well, _I_ am, and I\'m the person most concerned. Of course I didn\'t use\r\njust those words: I was perfectly civil, quite as civil as she. But I\r\ntold her I didn\'t consider she had a right to put me any such question.\r\nI said I wasn\'t sure that even Mona had, with the extraordinary line,\r\nyou know, that Mona has taken. At any rate the whole thing, the way _I_\r\nput it, was between Mona and me; and between Mona and me, if she didn\'t\r\nmind, it would just have to remain."\r\n\r\nFleda was silent a little. "All that didn\'t answer her question."\r\n\r\n"Then you think I ought to have told her?"\r\n\r\nAgain our young lady reflected. "I think I\'m rather glad you didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I knew what I was about," said Owen. "It didn\'t strike me that she had\r\nthe least right to come down on us that way and ask for explanations."\r\n\r\nFleda looked very grave, weighing the whole matter. "I dare say that\r\nwhen she started, when she arrived, she didn\'t mean to \'come down.\'"\r\n\r\n"What then did she mean to do?"\r\n\r\n"What she said to me just before she went: she meant to plead with me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I heard her!" said Owen. "But plead with you for what?"\r\n\r\n"For you, of course--to entreat me to give you up. She thinks me awfully\r\ndesigning--that I\'ve taken some sort of possession of you."\r\n\r\nOwen stared. "You haven\'t lifted a finger! It\'s I who have taken\r\npossession."\r\n\r\n"Very true, you\'ve done it all yourself." Fleda spoke gravely and\r\ngently, without a breath of coquetry. "But those are shades between\r\nwhich she\'s probably not obliged to distinguish. It\'s enough for her\r\nthat we\'re singularly intimate."\r\n\r\n"I am, but you\'re not!" Owen exclaimed.\r\n\r\nFleda gave a dim smile. "You make me at least feel that I\'m learning to\r\nknow you very well when I hear you say such a thing as that. Mrs.\r\nBrigstock came to get round me, to supplicate me," she went on; "but to\r\nfind you there, looking so much at home, paying me a friendly call and\r\nshoving the tea-things about--that was too much for her patience. She\r\ndoesn\'t know, you see, that I\'m after all a decent girl. She simply made\r\nup her mind on the spot that I\'m a very bad case."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t stand the way she treated you, and that was what I had to\r\nsay to her," Owen returned.\r\n\r\n"She\'s simple and slow, but she\'s not a fool: I think she treated me, on\r\nthe whole, very well." Fleda remembered how Mrs. Gereth had treated Mona\r\nwhen the Brigstocks came down to Poynton.\r\n\r\nOwen evidently thought her painfully perverse. "It was you who carried\r\nit off; you behaved like a brick. And so did I, I consider. If you only\r\nknew the difficulty I had! I told her you were the noblest and\r\nstraightest of women."\r\n\r\n"That can hardly have removed her impression that there are things I put\r\nyou up to."\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t," Owen replied with candor. "She said our relation, yours and\r\nmine, isn\'t innocent."\r\n\r\n"What did she mean by that?"\r\n\r\n"As you may suppose, I particularly inquired. Do you know what she had\r\nthe cheek to tell me?" Owen asked. "She didn\'t better it much: she said\r\nshe meant that it\'s excessively unnatural."\r\n\r\nFleda considered afresh. "Well, it is!" she brought out at last.\r\n\r\n"Then, upon my honor, it\'s only you who make it so!" Her perversity was\r\ndistinctly too much for him. "I mean you make it so by the way you keep\r\nme off."\r\n\r\n"Have I kept you off to-day?" Fleda sadly shook her head, raising her\r\narms a little and dropping them.\r\n\r\nHer gesture of resignation gave him a pretext for catching at her hand,\r\nbut before he could take it she had put it behind her. They had been\r\nseated together on Maggie\'s single sofa, and her movement brought her to\r\nher feet, while Owen, looking at her reproachfully, leaned back in\r\ndiscouragement. "What good does it do me to be here when I find you only\r\na stone?"\r\n\r\nShe met his eyes with all the tenderness she had not yet uttered, and\r\nshe had not known till this moment how great was the accumulation.\r\n"Perhaps, after all," she risked, "there may be even in a stone still\r\nsome little help for you."\r\n\r\nOwen sat there a minute staring at her. "Ah, you\'re beautiful, more\r\nbeautiful than any one," he broke out, "but I\'ll be hanged if I can ever\r\nunderstand you! On Tuesday, at your father\'s, you were beautiful--as\r\nbeautiful, just before I left, as you are at this instant. But the next\r\nday, when I went back, I found it had apparently meant nothing; and now,\r\nagain, that you let me come here and you shine at me like an angel, it\r\ndoesn\'t bring you an inch nearer to saying what I want you to say." He\r\nremained a moment longer in the same position; then he jerked himself\r\nup. "What I want you to say is that you like me--what I want you to say\r\nis that you pity me." He sprang up and came to her. "What I want you to\r\nsay is that you\'ll _save_ me!"\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated. "Why do you need saving, when you announced to me just\r\nnow that you\'re a free man?"\r\n\r\nHe too hesitated, but he was not checked. "It\'s just for the reason that\r\nI\'m free. Don\'t you know what I mean, Miss Vetch? I want you to marry\r\nme."\r\n\r\nFleda, at this, put out her hand in charity; she held his own, which\r\nquickly grasped it a moment, and if he had described her as shining at\r\nhim it may be assumed that she shone all the more in her deep, still\r\nsmile. "Let me hear a little more about your freedom first," she said.\r\n"I gather that Mrs. Brigstock was not wholly satisfied with the way you\r\ndisposed of her question."\r\n\r\n"I dare say she wasn\'t. But the less she\'s satisfied the more I\'m free."\r\n\r\n"What bearing have _her_ feelings, pray?" Fleda asked.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mona\'s much worse than her mother. She wants much more to give me\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"Then why doesn\'t she do it?"\r\n\r\n"She will, as soon as her mother gets home and tells her."\r\n\r\n"Tells her what?" Fleda inquired.\r\n\r\n"Why, that I\'m in love with _you_!"\r\n\r\nFleda debated. "Are you so very sure she will?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I\'m sure, with all the evidence I already have. That will\r\nfinish her!" Owen declared.\r\n\r\nThis made his companion thoughtful again. "Can you take such pleasure in\r\nher being \'finished\'--a poor girl you\'ve once loved?"\r\n\r\nOwen waited long enough to take in the question; then with a serenity\r\nstartling even to her knowledge of his nature, "I don\'t think I can have\r\n_really_ loved her, you know," he replied.\r\n\r\nFleda broke into a laugh which gave him a surprise as visible as the\r\nemotion it testified to. "Then how am I to know that you \'really\'\r\nlove--anybody else?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll show you that!" said Owen.\r\n\r\n"I must take it on trust," the girl pursued. "And what if Mona doesn\'t\r\ngive you up?" she added.\r\n\r\nOwen was baffled but a few seconds; he had thought of everything. "Why,\r\nthat\'s just where you come in."\r\n\r\n"To save you? I see. You mean I must get rid of her for you." His\r\nblankness showed for a little that he felt the chill of her cold logic;\r\nbut as she waited for his rejoinder she knew to which of them it cost\r\nmost. He gasped a minute, and that gave her time to say: "You see, Mr.\r\nOwen, how impossible it is to talk of such things yet!"\r\n\r\nLike lightning he had grasped her arm. "You mean you _will_ talk of\r\nthem?" Then as he began to take the flood of assent from her eyes: "You\r\n_will_ listen to me? Oh, you dear, you dear--when, when?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, when it isn\'t mere misery!" The words had broken from her in a\r\nsudden loud cry, and what next happened was that the very sound of her\r\npain upset her. She heard her own true note; she turned short away from\r\nhim; in a moment she had burst into sobs; in another his arms were round\r\nher; the next she had let herself go so far that even Mrs. Gereth might\r\nhave seen it. He clasped her, and she gave herself--she poured out her\r\ntears on his breast; something prisoned and pent throbbed and gushed;\r\nsomething deep and sweet surged up--something that came from far within\r\nand far off, that had begun with the sight of him in his indifference\r\nand had never had rest since then. The surrender was short, but the\r\nrelief was long: she felt his lips upon her face and his arms tighten\r\nwith his full divination. What she did, what she _had_ done, she\r\nscarcely knew: she only was aware, as she broke from him again, of what\r\nhad taken place in his own quick breast. What had taken place was that,\r\nwith the click of a spring, he saw. He had cleared the high wall at a\r\nbound; they were together without a veil. She had not a shred of a\r\nsecret left; it was as if a whirlwind had come and gone, laying low the\r\ngreat false front that she had built up stone by stone. The strangest\r\nthing of all was the momentary sense of desolation.\r\n\r\n"Ah, all the while you _cared_?" Owen read the truth with a wonder so\r\ngreat that it was visibly almost a sadness, a terror caused by his\r\nsudden perception of where the impossibility was not. That made it all\r\nperhaps elsewhere.\r\n\r\n"I cared, I cared, I cared!" Fleda moaned it as defiantly as if she were\r\nconfessing a misdeed. "How couldn\'t I care? But you mustn\'t, you must\r\nnever, never ask! It isn\'t for us to talk about!" she insisted. "Don\'t\r\nspeak of it, don\'t speak!"\r\n\r\nIt was easy indeed not to speak when the difficulty was to find words.\r\nHe clasped his hands before her as he might have clasped them at an\r\naltar; his pressed palms shook together while he held his breath and\r\nwhile she stilled herself in the effort to come round again to the real\r\nand the right. He helped this effort, soothing her into a seat with a\r\ntouch as light as if she had really been something sacred. She sank into\r\na chair and he dropped before her on his knees; she fell back with\r\nclosed eyes and he buried his face in her lap. There was no way to thank\r\nher but this act of prostration, which lasted, in silence, till she laid\r\nconsenting hands on him, touched his head and stroked it, held it in her\r\ntenderness till he acknowledged his long density. He made the avowal\r\nseem only his--made her, when she rose again, raise him at last, softly,\r\nas if from the abasement of shame. If in each other\'s eyes now, however,\r\nthey saw the truth, this truth, to Fleda, looked harder even than\r\nbefore--all the harder that when, at the very moment she recognized it,\r\nhe murmured to her ecstatically, in fresh possession of her hands, which\r\nhe drew up to his breast, holding them tight there with both his own:\r\n"I\'m saved, I\'m saved,--I _am_! I\'m ready for anything. I have your\r\nword. Come!" he cried, as if from the sight of a response slower than he\r\nneeded, and in the tone he so often had of a great boy at a great game.\r\n\r\nShe had once more disengaged herself, with the private vow that he\r\nshouldn\'t yet touch her again. It was all too horribly soon--her sense\r\nof this was rapidly surging back. "We mustn\'t talk, we mustn\'t talk; we\r\nmust _wait_!" she intensely insisted. "I don\'t know what you mean by\r\nyour freedom; I don\'t see it, I don\'t feel it. Where is it yet, where,\r\nyour freedom? If it\'s real there\'s plenty of time, and if it isn\'t\r\nthere\'s more than enough. I hate myself," she protested, "for having\r\nanything to say about her: it\'s like waiting for dead men\'s shoes! What\r\nbusiness is it of mine what she does? She has her own trouble and her\r\nown plan. It\'s too hideous to watch her and count on her!"\r\n\r\nOwen\'s face, at this, showed a reviving dread, the fear of some darksome\r\nprocess of her mind. "If you speak for yourself I can understand, but\r\nwhy is it hideous for _me_?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I mean for myself!" Fleda said impatiently.\r\n\r\n"_I_ watch her, _I_ count on her: how can I do anything else? If I count\r\non her to let me definitely know how we stand, I do nothing in life but\r\nwhat she herself has led straight up to. I never thought of asking you\r\nto \'get rid of her\' for me, and I never would have spoken to you if I\r\nhadn\'t held that I _am_ rid of her, that she has backed out of the whole\r\nthing. Didn\'t she do so from the moment she began to put it off? I had\r\nalready applied for the license; the very invitations were half\r\naddressed. Who but she, all of a sudden, demanded an unnatural wait? It\r\nwas none of _my_ doing; I had never dreamed of anything but coming up to\r\nthe scratch." Owen grew more and more lucid, and more confident of the\r\neffect of his lucidity. "She called it \'taking a stand,\' to see what\r\nmother would do. I told her mother would do what I would make her do;\r\nand to that she replied that she would like to see me make her first. I\r\nsaid I would arrange that everything should be all right, and she said\r\nshe really preferred to arrange it herself. It was a flat refusal to\r\ntrust me in the smallest degree. Why then had she pretended so\r\ntremendously to care for me? And of course, at present," said Owen, "she\r\ntrusts me, if possible, still less."\r\n\r\nFleda paid this statement the homage of a minute\'s muteness. "As to\r\nthat, naturally, she has reason."\r\n\r\n"Why on earth has she reason?" Then, as his companion, moving away,\r\nsimply threw up her hands, "I never looked at you--not to call\r\nlooking--till she had regularly driven me to it," he went on. "I know\r\nwhat I\'m about. I do assure you I\'m all right!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re not all right--you\'re all wrong!" Fleda cried in despair. "You\r\nmustn\'t stay here, you mustn\'t!" she repeated with clear decision. "You\r\nmake me say dreadful things, and I feel as if I made _you_ say them."\r\nBut before he could reply she took it up in another tone. "Why in the\r\nworld, if everything had changed, didn\'t you break off?"\r\n\r\n"I?--" The inquiry seemed to have moved him to stupefaction. "Can you\r\nask me that question when I only wanted to please you? Didn\'t you seem\r\nto show me, in your wonderful way, that that was exactly how? I didn\'t\r\nbreak off just on purpose to leave it to _her_. I didn\'t break off so\r\nthat there shouldn\'t be a thing to be said against me."\r\n\r\nThe instant after her challenge Fleda had faced him again in\r\nself-reproof. "There _isn\'t_ a thing to be said against you, and I don\'t\r\nknow what nonsense you make me talk! You _have_ pleased me, and you\'ve\r\nbeen right and good, and it\'s the only comfort, and you must go.\r\nEverything must come from Mona, and if it doesn\'t come we\'ve said\r\nentirely too much. You must leave me alone--forever."\r\n\r\n"Forever?" Owen gasped.\r\n\r\n"I mean unless everything is different."\r\n\r\n"Everything _is_ different--when I _know_!"\r\n\r\nFleda winced at what he knew; she made a wild gesture which seemed to\r\nwhirl it out of the room. The mere allusion was like another embrace.\r\n"You know nothing--and you must go and wait! You mustn\'t break down at\r\nthis point."\r\n\r\nHe looked about him and took up his hat: it was as if, in spite of\r\nfrustration, he had got the essence of what he wanted and could afford\r\nto agree with her to the extent of keeping up the forms. He covered her\r\nwith his fine, simple smile, but made no other approach. "Oh, I\'m so\r\nawfully happy!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated: she would only be impeccable even though she should have\r\nto be sententious. "You\'ll be happy if you\'re perfect!" she risked.\r\n\r\nHe laughed out at this, and she wondered if, with a new-born acuteness,\r\nhe saw the absurdity of her speech, and that no one was happy just\r\nbecause no one could be what she so lightly prescribed. "I don\'t pretend\r\nto be perfect, but I shall find a letter to-night!"\r\n\r\n"So much the better, if it\'s the kind of one you desire." That was the\r\nmost she could say, and having made it sound as dry as possible she\r\nlapsed into a silence so pointed as to deprive him of all pretext for\r\nnot leaving her. Still, nevertheless, he stood there, playing with his\r\nhat and filling the long pause with a strained and anxious smile. He\r\nwished to obey her thoroughly, to appear not to presume on any advantage\r\nhe had won from her; but there was clearly something he longed for\r\nbeside. While he showed this by hanging on she thought of two other\r\nthings. One of these was that his countenance, after all, failed to bear\r\nout his description of his bliss. As for the other, it had no sooner\r\ncome into her head than she found it seated, in spite of her resolution,\r\non her lips. It took the form of an inconsequent question. "When did you\r\nsay Mrs. Brigstock was to have gone back?"\r\n\r\nOwen stared. "To Waterbath? She was to have spent the night in town,\r\ndon\'t you know? But when she left me, after our talk, I said to myself\r\nthat she would take an evening train. I know I made her want to get\r\nhome."\r\n\r\n"Where did you separate?" Fleda asked.\r\n\r\n"At the West Kensington station--she was going to Victoria. I had walked\r\nwith her there, and our talk was all on the way."\r\n\r\nFleda pondered a moment. "If she did go back that night you would have\r\nheard from Waterbath by this time."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Owen. "I thought I might hear this morning."\r\n\r\n"She can\'t have gone back," Fleda declared. "Mona would have written on\r\nthe spot."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, she _will_ have written bang off!" Owen cheerfully conceded.\r\n\r\nFleda thought again. "Then, even in the event of her mother\'s not having\r\ngot home till the morning, you would have had your letter at the latest\r\nto-day. You see she has had plenty of time."\r\n\r\nOwen hesitated; then, "Oh, she\'s all right!" he laughed. "I go by Mrs.\r\nBrigstock\'s certain effect on her--the effect of the temper the old lady\r\nshowed when we parted. Do you know what she asked me?" he sociably\r\ncontinued. "She asked me in a kind of nasty manner if I supposed you\r\n\'really\' cared anything about me. Of course I told her I supposed you\r\ndidn\'t--not a solitary rap. How could I suppose you _do_, with your\r\nextraordinary ways? It doesn\'t matter; I could see she thought I lied."\r\n\r\n"You should have told her, you know, that I had seen you in town only\r\nthat one time," Fleda observed.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, I did--for _you_! It was only for you."\r\n\r\nSomething in this touched the girl so that for a moment she could not\r\ntrust herself to speak. "You\'re an honest man," she said at last. She\r\nhad gone to the door and opened it. "Good-bye."\r\n\r\nEven yet, however, he hung back; and she remembered how, at the end of\r\nhis hour at Ricks, she had been put to it to get him out of the house.\r\nHe had in general a sort of cheerful slowness which helped him at such\r\ntimes, though she could now see his strong fist crumple his big, stiff\r\ngloves as if they had been paper. "But even if there\'s no letter--" he\r\nbegan. He began, but there he left it.\r\n\r\n"You mean, even if she doesn\'t let you off? Ah, you ask me too much!"\r\nFleda spoke from the tiny hall, where she had taken refuge between the\r\nold barometer and the old mackintosh. "There are things too utterly for\r\nyourselves alone. How can I tell? What do I know? Good-bye, good-bye! If\r\nshe doesn\'t let you off, it will be because she _is_ attached to you."\r\n\r\n"She\'s not, she\'s not: there\'s nothing in it! Doesn\'t a fellow\r\nknow?--except with _you_!" Owen ruefully added. With this he came out of\r\nthe room, lowering his voice to secret supplication, pleading with her\r\nreally to meet him on the ground of the negation of Mona. It was this\r\nbetrayal of his need of support and sanction that made her\r\nretreat--harden herself in the effort to save what might remain of all\r\nshe had given, given probably for nothing. The very vision of him as he\r\nthus morally clung to her was the vision of a weakness somewhere in the\r\ncore of his bloom, a blessed manly weakness of which, if she had only\r\nthe valid right, it would be all a sweetness to take care. She faintly\r\nsickened, however, with the sense that there was as yet no valid right\r\npoor Owen could give. "You can take it from my honor, you know," he\r\nwhispered, "that she loathes me."\r\n\r\nFleda had stood clutching the knob of Maggie\'s little painted\r\nstair-rail; she took, on the stairs, a step backward. "Why then doesn\'t\r\nshe prove it in the only clear way?"\r\n\r\n"She _has_ proved it. Will you believe it if you see the letter?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to see any letter," said Fleda. "You\'ll miss your train."\r\n\r\nFacing him, waving him away, she had taken another upward step; but he\r\nsprang to the side of the stairs and brought his hand, above the\r\nbanister, down hard on her wrist. "Do you mean to tell me that I must\r\nmarry a woman I hate?"\r\n\r\nFrom her step she looked down into his raised face. "Ah, you see it\'s\r\nnot true that you\'re free!" She seemed almost to exult. "It\'s not\r\ntrue--it\'s not true!"\r\n\r\nHe only, at this, like a buffeting swimmer, gave a shake of his head and\r\nrepeated his question. "Do you mean to tell me I must marry such a\r\nwoman?"\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated; he held her fast. "No. Anything is better than that."\r\n\r\n"Then, in God\'s name, what must I do?"\r\n\r\n"You must settle that with her. You mustn\'t break faith. Anything is\r\nbetter than that. You must at any rate be utterly sure. She _must_ love\r\nyou--how can she help it? _I_ wouldn\'t give you up!" said Fleda. She\r\nspoke in broken bits, panting out her words. "The great thing is to keep\r\nfaith. Where _is_ a man if he doesn\'t? If he doesn\'t he may be so cruel.\r\nSo cruel, so cruel, so cruel!" Fleda repeated. "I couldn\'t have a hand\r\nin _that_, you know: that\'s my position--that\'s mine. You offered her\r\nmarriage: it\'s a tremendous thing for her." Then looking at him another\r\nmoment, "_I_ wouldn\'t give you up!" she said again. He still had hold of\r\nher arm; she took in his blank alarm. With a quick dip of her face she\r\nreached his hand with her lips, pressing them to the back of it with a\r\nforce that doubled the force of her words. "Never, never, never!" she\r\ncried; and before he could succeed in seizing her she had turned and,\r\nscrambling up the stairs, got away from him even faster than she had got\r\naway from him at Ricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTen days after his visit she received a communication from Mrs.\r\nGereth--a telegram of eight words, exclusive of signature and date.\r\n"Come up immediately and stay with me here"--it was characteristically\r\nsharp, as Maggie said; but, as Maggie added, it was also\r\ncharacteristically kind. "Here" was an hotel in London, and Maggie had\r\nembraced a condition of life which already began to produce in her some\r\nyearning for hotels in London. She would have responded in an instant,\r\nand she was surprised that her sister seemed to hesitate. Fleda\'s\r\nhesitation, which lasted but an hour, was expressed in that young lady\'s\r\nown mind by the reflection that in obeying her friend\'s summons she\r\nshouldn\'t know what she should be "in for." Her friend\'s summons,\r\nhowever, was but another name for her friend\'s appeal; and Mrs. Gereth\'s\r\nbounty had laid her under obligations more sensible than any reluctance.\r\nIn the event--that is at the end of her hour--she testified to her\r\ngratitude by taking the train and to her mistrust by leaving her\r\nluggage. She went as if she had gone up for the day. In the train,\r\nhowever, she had another thoughtful hour, during which it was her\r\nmistrust that mainly deepened. She felt as if for ten days she had sat\r\nin darkness, looking to the east for a dawn that had not yet glimmered.\r\nHer mind had lately been less occupied with Mrs. Gereth; it had been so\r\nexceptionally occupied with Mona. If the sequel was to justify Owen\'s\r\nprevision of Mrs. Brigstock\'s action upon her daughter, this action was\r\nat the end of a week as much a mystery as ever. The stillness, all\r\nround, had been exactly what Fleda desired, but it gave her for the time\r\na deep sense of failure, the sense of a sudden drop from a height at\r\nwhich she had all things beneath her. She had nothing beneath her now;\r\nshe herself was at the bottom of the heap. No sign had reached her from\r\nOwen--poor Owen, who had clearly no news to give about his precious\r\nletter from Waterbath. If Mrs. Brigstock had hurried back to obtain that\r\nthis letter should be written, Mrs. Brigstock might then have spared\r\nherself so great an inconvenience. Owen had been silent for the best of\r\nall reasons--the reason that he had had nothing in life to say. If the\r\nletter had not been written he would simply have had to introduce some\r\nlarge qualification into his account of his freedom. He had left his\r\nyoung friend under her refusal to listen to him until he should be able,\r\non the contrary, to extend that picture; and his present submission was\r\nall in keeping with the rigid honesty that his young friend had\r\nprescribed.\r\n\r\nIt was this that formed the element through which Mona loomed large;\r\nFleda had enough imagination, a fine enough feeling for life, to be\r\nimpressed with such an image of successful immobility. The massive\r\nmaiden at Waterbath _was_ successful from the moment she could entertain\r\nher resentments as if they had been poor relations who needn\'t put her\r\nto expense. She was a magnificent dead weight; there was something\r\npositive and portentous in her quietude. "What game are they all\r\nplaying?" poor Fleda could only ask; for she had an intimate conviction\r\nthat Owen was now under the roof of his betrothed. That was stupefying\r\nif he really hated Mona; and if he didn\'t really hate her what had\r\nbrought him to Raphael Road and to Maggie\'s? Fleda had no real light,\r\nbut she felt that to account for the absence of any result of their last\r\nmeeting would take a supposition of the full sacrifice to charity that\r\nshe had held up before him. If he had gone to Waterbath it had been\r\nsimply because he had to go. She had as good as told him that he would\r\nhave to go; that this was an inevitable incident of his keeping perfect\r\nfaith--faith so literal that the smallest subterfuge would always be a\r\nreproach to him. When she tried to remember that it was for herself he\r\nwas taking his risk, she felt how weak a way that was of expressing\r\nMona\'s supremacy. There would be no need of keeping him up if there were\r\nnothing to keep him up to. Her eyes grew wan as she discerned in the\r\nimpenetrable air that Mona\'s thick outline never wavered an inch. She\r\nwondered fitfully what Mrs. Gereth had by this time made of it, and\r\nreflected with a strange elation that the sand on which the mistress of\r\nRicks had built a momentary triumph was quaking beneath the surface. As\r\nThe Morning Post still held its peace, she would be, of course, more\r\nconfident; but the hour was at hand at which Owen would have absolutely\r\nto do either one thing or the other. To keep perfect faith was to inform\r\nagainst his mother, and to hear the police at her door would be Mrs.\r\nGereth\'s awakening. How much she was beguiled Fleda could see from her\r\nhaving been for a whole month quite as deep and dark as Mona. She had\r\nlet her young friend alone because of the certitude, cultivated at\r\nRicks, that Owen had done the opposite. He had done the opposite indeed,\r\nbut much good had that brought forth! To have sent for her now, Fleda\r\nfelt, was from this point of view wholly natural: she had sent for her\r\nto show at last how much she had scored. If, however, Owen was really at\r\nWaterbath the refutation of that boast was easy.\r\n\r\nFleda found Mrs. Gereth in modest apartments and with an air of fatigue\r\nin her distinguished face--a sign, as she privately remarked, of the\r\nstrain of that effort to be discreet of which she herself had been\r\nhaving the benefit. It was a constant feature of their relation that\r\nthis lady could make Fleda blench a little, and that the effect\r\nproceeded from the intense pressure of her confidence. If the confidence\r\nhad been heavy even when the girl, in the early flush of devotion, had\r\nbeen able to feel herself most responsive, it drew her heart into her\r\nmouth now that she had reserves and conditions, now that she couldn\'t\r\nsimplify with the same bold hand as her protectress. In the very\r\nbrightening of the tired look, and at the moment of their embrace, Fleda\r\nfelt on her shoulders the return of the load, so that her spirit frankly\r\nquailed as she asked herself what she had brought up from her trusted\r\nseclusion to support it. Mrs. Gereth\'s free manner always made a joke of\r\nweakness, and there was in such a welcome a richness, a kind of familiar\r\nnobleness, that suggested shame to a harried conscience. Something had\r\nhappened, she could see, and she could also see, in the bravery that\r\nseemed to announce it had changed everything, a formidable assumption\r\nthat what had happened was what a healthy young woman must like. The\r\nabsence of luggage had made this young woman feel meagre even before her\r\ncompanion, taking in the bareness at a second glance, exclaimed upon it\r\nand roundly rebuked her. Of course she had expected her to stay.\r\n\r\nFleda thought best to show bravery too, and to show it from the first.\r\n"What you expected, dear Mrs. Gereth, is exactly what I came up to\r\nascertain. It struck me as right to do that first. I mean to ascertain,\r\nwithout making preparations."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll be so good as to make them on the spot!" Mrs. Gereth was\r\nmost emphatic. "You\'re going abroad with me."\r\n\r\nFleda wondered, but she also smiled. "To-night--to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"In as few days as possible. That\'s all that\'s left for me now." Fleda\'s\r\nheart, at this, gave a bound; she wondered to what particular difference\r\nin Mrs. Gereth\'s situation as last known to her it was an allusion.\r\n"I\'ve made my plan," her friend continued: "I go for at least a year. We\r\nshall go straight to Florence; we can manage there. I of course don\'t\r\nlook to you, however," she added, "to stay with me all that time. That\r\nwill require to be settled. Owen will have to join us as soon as\r\npossible; he may not be quite ready to get off with us. But I\'m\r\nconvinced it\'s quite the right thing to go. It will make a good change;\r\nit will put in a decent interval."\r\n\r\nFleda listened; she was deeply mystified. "How kind you are to me!" she\r\npresently said. The picture suggested so many questions that she\r\nscarcely knew which to ask first. She took one at a venture. "You really\r\nhave it from Mr. Gereth that he\'ll give us his company?"\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Gereth\'s mother smiled in response to this, Fleda knew that her\r\nsmile was a tacit criticism of such a form of reference to her son.\r\nFleda habitually spoke of him as Mr. Owen, and it was a part of her\r\npresent vigilance to appear to have relinquished that right. Mrs.\r\nGereth\'s manner confirmed a certain impression of her pretending to more\r\nthan she felt; her very first words had conveyed it, and it reminded\r\nFleda of the conscious courage with which, weeks before, the lady had\r\nmet her visitor\'s first startled stare at the clustered spoils of\r\nPoynton. It was her practice to take immensely for granted whatever she\r\nwished. "Oh, if you\'ll answer for him, it will do quite as well!" she\r\nsaid. Then she put her hands on the girl\'s shoulders and held them at\r\narm\'s length, as if to shake them a little, while in the depths of her\r\nshining eyes Fleda discovered something obscure and unquiet. "You bad,\r\nfalse thing, why didn\'t you tell me?" Her tone softened her harshness,\r\nand her visitor had never had such a sense of her indulgence. Mrs.\r\nGereth could show patience; it was a part of the general bribe, but it\r\nwas also like the handing in of a heavy bill before which Fleda could\r\nonly fumble in a penniless pocket. "You must perfectly have known at\r\nRicks, and yet you practically denied it. That\'s why I call you bad and\r\nfalse!" It was apparently also why she again almost roughly kissed her.\r\n\r\n"I think that before I answer you I had better know what you\'re talking\r\nabout," Fleda said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth looked at her with a slight increase of hardness. "You\'ve\r\ndone everything you need for modesty, my dear! If he\'s sick with love of\r\nyou, you haven\'t had to wait for me to inform you."\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated. "Has he informed _you_, dear Mrs. Gereth?"\r\n\r\nDear Mrs. Gereth smiled sweetly. "How could he, when our situation is\r\nsuch that he communicates with me only through you, and that you are so\r\ntortuous you conceal everything?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t he answer the note in which you let him know that I was in\r\ntown?" Fleda asked.\r\n\r\n"He answered it sufficiently by rushing off on the spot to see you."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth met that allusion with a prompt firmness that made almost\r\ninsolently light of any ground of complaint, and Fleda\'s own sense of\r\nresponsibility was now so vivid that all resentments turned\r\ncomparatively pale. She had no heart to produce a grievance; she could\r\nonly, left as she was with the little mystery on her hands, produce,\r\nafter a moment, a question. "How then do you come to know that your son\r\nhas ever thought--"\r\n\r\n"That he would give his ears to get you?" Mrs. Gereth broke in. "I had a\r\nvisit from Mrs. Brigstock."\r\n\r\nFleda opened her eyes. "She went down to Ricks?"\r\n\r\n"The day after she had found Owen at your feet. She knows everything."\r\n\r\nFleda shook her head sadly; she was more startled than she cared to\r\nshow. This odd journey of Mrs. Brigstock\'s, which, with a simplicity\r\nequal for once to Owen\'s, she had not divined, now struck her as having\r\nproduced the hush of the last ten days. "There are things she doesn\'t\r\nknow!" she presently exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"She knows he would do anything to marry you."\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t told her so," Fleda said.\r\n\r\n"No, but he has told you. That\'s better still!" laughed Mrs. Gereth. "My\r\ndear child," she went on with an air that affected the girl as a sort of\r\nblind profanity, "don\'t try to make yourself out better than you are.\r\n_I_ know what you are. I haven\'t lived with you so much for nothing.\r\nYou\'re not quite a saint in heaven yet. Lord, what a creature you\'d have\r\nthought me in my good time! But you do like it, fortunately, you idiot.\r\nYou\'re pale with your passion, you sweet thing. That\'s exactly what I\r\nwanted to see. I can\'t for the life of me think where the shame comes\r\nin." Then with a finer significance, a look that seemed to Fleda\r\nstrange, she added: "It\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen him but twice," said Fleda.\r\n\r\n"But twice?" Mrs. Gereth still smiled.\r\n\r\n"On the occasion, at papa\'s, that Mrs. Brigstock told you of, and one\r\nday, since then, down at Maggie\'s."\r\n\r\n"Well, those things are between yourselves, and you seem to me both poor\r\ncreatures at best." Mrs. Gereth spoke with a rich humor which tipped\r\nwith light for an instant a real conviction. "I don\'t know what you\'ve\r\ngot in your veins: you absurdly exaggerated the difficulties. But enough\r\nis as good as a feast, and when once I get you abroad together--!" She\r\nchecked herself as if from excess of meaning; what might happen when she\r\nshould get them abroad together was to be gathered only from the way she\r\nslowly rubbed her hands.\r\n\r\nThe gesture, however, made the promise so definite that for a moment her\r\ncompanion was almost beguiled. But there was nothing to account, as yet,\r\nfor the wealth of Mrs. Gereth\'s certitude: the visit of the lady of\r\nWaterbath appeared but half to explain it. "Is it permitted to be\r\nsurprised," Fleda deferentially asked, "at Mrs. Brigstock\'s thinking it\r\nwould help her to see you?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s never permitted to be surprised at the aberrations of born fools,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Gereth. "If a cow should try to calculate, that\'s the kind of\r\nhappy thought she\'d have. Mrs. Brigstock came down to plead with me."\r\n\r\nFleda mused a moment. "That\'s what she came to do with _me_," she then\r\nhonestly returned. "But what did she expect to get of you, with your\r\nopposition so marked from the first?"\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t know I want _you_, my dear. It\'s a wonder, with all my\r\nviolence--the gross publicity I\'ve given my desires. But she\'s as stupid\r\nas an owl--she doesn\'t feel your charm."\r\n\r\nFleda felt herself flush slightly, but she tried to smile. "Did you tell\r\nher all about it? Did you make her understand you want me?"\r\n\r\n"For what do you take me? I wasn\'t such a donkey."\r\n\r\n"So as not to aggravate Mona?" Fleda suggested.\r\n\r\n"So as not to aggravate Mona, naturally. We\'ve had a narrow course to\r\nsteer, but thank God we\'re at last in the open!"\r\n\r\n"What do you call the open, Mrs. Gereth?" Fleda demanded. Then as the\r\nother faltered: "Do you know where Mr. Owen is to-day?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth stared. "Do you mean he\'s at Waterbath? Well, that\'s your\r\nown affair. I can bear it if _you_ can."\r\n\r\n"Wherever he is, I can bear it," Fleda said. "But I haven\'t the least\r\nidea where he is."\r\n\r\n"Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself!" Mrs. Gereth broke out with a\r\nchange of note that showed how deep a passion underlay everything she\r\nhad said. The poor woman, catching her companion\'s hand, however, the\r\nnext moment, as if to retract something of this harshness, spoke more\r\npatiently. "Don\'t you understand, Fleda, how immensely, how devotedly,\r\nI\'ve trusted you?" Her tone was indeed a supplication.\r\n\r\nFleda was infinitely shaken; she was silent a little. "Yes, I\r\nunderstand. Did she go to you to complain of me?"\r\n\r\n"She came to see what she could do. She had been tremendously upset, the\r\nday before, by what had taken place at your father\'s, and she had posted\r\ndown to Ricks on the inspiration of the moment. She hadn\'t meant it on\r\nleaving home; it was the sight of you closeted there with Owen that had\r\nsuddenly determined her. The whole story, she said, was written in your\r\ntwo faces: she spoke as if she had never seen such an exhibition. Owen\r\nwas on the brink, but there might still be time to save him, and it was\r\nwith this idea she had bearded me in my den. \'What won\'t a mother do,\r\nyou know?\'--that was one of the things she said. What wouldn\'t a mother\r\ndo indeed? I thought I had sufficiently shown her what! She tried to\r\nbreak me down by an appeal to my good nature, as she called it, and from\r\nthe moment she opened on _you_, from the moment she denounced Owen\'s\r\nfalsity, I was as good-natured as she could wish. I understood that it\r\nwas a plea for mere mercy, that you and he between you were killing her\r\nchild. Of course I was delighted that Mona should be killed, but I was\r\nstudiously kind to Mrs. Brigstock. At the same time I was honest, I\r\ndidn\'t pretend to anything I couldn\'t feel. I asked her why the marriage\r\nhadn\'t taken place months ago, when Owen was perfectly ready; and I\r\nshowed her how completely that fatuous mistake on Mona\'s part cleared\r\nhis responsibility. It was she who had killed _him_--it was she who had\r\ndestroyed his affection, his illusions. Did she want him now when he was\r\nestranged, when he was disgusted, when he had a sore grievance? She\r\nreminded me that Mona had a sore grievance too, but she admitted that\r\nshe hadn\'t come to me to speak of that. What she had come to me for was\r\nnot to get the old things back, but simply to get Owen. What she wanted\r\nwas that I would, in simple pity, see fair play. Owen had been awfully\r\nbedeviled--she didn\'t call it that, she called it \'misled\'--but it was\r\nsimply you who had bedeviled him. He would be all right still if I would\r\nsee that you were out of the way. She asked me point-blank if it was\r\npossible I could want him to marry you."\r\n\r\nFleda had listened in unbearable pain and growing terror, as if her\r\ninterlocutress, stone by stone, were piling some fatal mass upon her\r\nbreast. She had the sense of being buried alive, smothered in the mere\r\nexpansion of another will; and now there was but one gap left to the\r\nair. A single word, she felt, might close it, and with the question that\r\ncame to her lips as Mrs. Gereth paused she seemed to herself to ask, in\r\ncold dread, for her doom. "What did you say to that?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"I was embarrassed, for I saw my danger--the danger of her going home\r\nand saying to Mona that I was backing you up. It had been a bliss to\r\nlearn that Owen had really turned to you, but my joy didn\'t put me off\r\nmy guard. I reflected intensely for a few seconds; then I saw my issue."\r\n\r\n"Your issue?" Fleda murmured.\r\n\r\n"I remembered how you had tied my hands about saying a word to Owen."\r\n\r\nFleda wondered. "And did you remember the little letter that, with your\r\nhands tied, you still succeeded in writing to him?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly; my little letter was a model of reticence. What I remembered\r\nwas all that in those few words I forbade myself to say. I had been an\r\nangel of delicacy--I had effaced myself like a saint. It was not for me\r\nto have done all that and then figure to such a woman as having done the\r\nopposite. Besides, it was none of her business."\r\n\r\n"Is that what you said to her?" Fleda asked.\r\n\r\n"I said to her that her question revealed a total misconception of the\r\nnature of my present relations with my son. I said to her that I had no\r\nrelations with him at all, and that nothing had passed between us for\r\nmonths. I said to her that my hands were spotlessly clean of any attempt\r\nto make him make up to you. I said to her that I had taken from Poynton\r\nwhat I had a right to take, but had done nothing else in the world. I\r\nwas determined that if I had bit my tongue off to oblige you I would at\r\nleast have the righteousness that my sacrifice gave me."\r\n\r\n"And was Mrs. Brigstock satisfied with your answer?"\r\n\r\n"She was visibly relieved."\r\n\r\n"It was fortunate for you," said Fleda, "that she\'s apparently not aware\r\nof the manner in which, almost under her nose, you advertised me to him\r\nat Poynton."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth appeared to recall that scene; she smiled with a serenity\r\nremarkably effective as showing how cheerfully used she had grown to\r\ninvidious allusions to it. "How should she be aware of it?"\r\n\r\n"She would if Owen had described your outbreak to Mona."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he didn\'t describe it. All his instinct was to conceal it from\r\nMona. He wasn\'t conscious, but he was already in love with you!" Mrs.\r\nGereth declared.\r\n\r\nFleda shook her head wearily. "No--I was only in love with him!"\r\n\r\nHere was a faint illumination with which Mrs. Gereth instantly mingled\r\nher fire. "You dear old wretch!" she exclaimed; and she again, with\r\nferocity, embraced her young friend.\r\n\r\nFleda submitted like a sick animal: she would submit to everything now.\r\n"Then what further passed?"\r\n\r\n"Only that she left me thinking she had got something."\r\n\r\n"And what had she got?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but her luncheon. But _I_ got everything!"\r\n\r\n"Everything?" Fleda quavered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth, struck apparently by something in her tone, looked at her\r\nfrom a tremendous height. "Don\'t fail me now!"\r\n\r\nIt sounded so like a menace that, with a full divination at last, the\r\npoor girl fell weakly into a chair. "What on earth have you done?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth stood there in all the glory of a great stroke. "I\'ve\r\nsettled you." She filled the room, to Fleda\'s scared vision, with the\r\nglare of her magnificence. "I\'ve sent everything back."\r\n\r\n"Everything?" Fleda gasped.\r\n\r\n"To the smallest snuff-box. The last load went yesterday. The same\r\npeople did it. Poor little Ricks is empty." Then as if, for a crowning\r\nsplendor, to check all deprecation, "They\'re yours, you goose!" Mrs.\r\nGereth concluded, holding up her handsome head and rubbing her white\r\nhands. Fleda saw that there were tears in her deep eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was slow to take in the announcement, but when she had done so she\r\nfelt it to be more than her cup of bitterness would hold. Her bitterness\r\nwas her anxiety, the taste of which suddenly sickened her. What had she\r\nbecome, on the spot, but a traitress to her friend? The treachery\r\nincreased with the view of the friend\'s motive, a motive magnificent as\r\na tribute to her value. Mrs. Gereth had wished to make sure of her and\r\nhad reasoned that there would be no such way as by a large appeal to her\r\nhonor. If it be true, as men have declared, that the sense of honor is\r\nweak in women, some of the bearings of this stroke might have thrown a\r\nlight on the question. What was now, at all events, put before Fleda was\r\nthat she had been made sure of, for the greatness of the surrender\r\nimposed an obligation as great. There was an expression she had heard\r\nused by young men with whom she danced: the only word to fit Mrs.\r\nGereth\'s intention was that Mrs. Gereth had designed to "fetch" her. It\r\nwas a calculated, it was a crushing bribe; it looked her in the eyes and\r\nsaid simply: "That\'s what I do for you!" What Fleda was to do in return\r\nrequired no pointing out. The sense, at present, of how little she had\r\ndone made her almost cry aloud with pain; but her first endeavor, in the\r\nface of the fact, was to keep such a cry from reaching her companion.\r\nHow little she had done Mrs. Gereth didn\'t yet know, and possibly there\r\nwould be still some way of turning round before the discovery. On her\r\nown side too Fleda had almost made one: she had known she was wanted,\r\nbut she had not after all conceived how magnificently much. She had been\r\ntreated by her friend\'s act as a conscious prize, but what made her a\r\nconscious prize was only the power the act itself imputed to her. As\r\nhigh, bold diplomacy it dazzled and carried her off her feet. She\r\nadmired the noble risk of it, a risk Mrs. Gereth had faced for the\r\nutterly poor creature that the girl now felt herself. The change it\r\ninstantly wrought in her was, moreover, extraordinary: it transformed at\r\na touch her emotion on the subject of concessions. A few weeks earlier\r\nshe had jumped at the duty of pleading for them, practically quarreling\r\nwith the lady of Ricks for her refusal to restore what she had taken.\r\nShe had been sore with the wrong to Owen, she had bled with the wounds\r\nof Poynton; now however, as she heard of the replenishment of the void\r\nthat had so haunted her, she came as near sounding an alarm as if from\r\nthe deck of a ship she had seen a person she loved jump into the sea.\r\nMrs. Gereth had become in a flash the victim; poor little Ricks had been\r\nlaid bare in a night. If Fleda\'s feeling about the old things had taken\r\nprecipitate form the form would have been a frantic command. It was\r\nindeed for mere want of breath that she didn\'t shout: "Oh, stop\r\nthem--it\'s no use; bring them back--it\'s too late!" And what most kept\r\nher breathless was her companion\'s very grandeur. Fleda distinguished as\r\nnever before the purity of such a passion; it made Mrs. Gereth august\r\nand almost sublime. It was absolutely unselfish--she cared nothing for\r\nmere possession. She thought solely and incorruptibly of what was best\r\nfor the things; she had surrendered them to the presumptive care of the\r\none person of her acquaintance who felt about them as she felt herself,\r\nand whose long lease of the future would be the nearest approach that\r\ncould be compassed to committing them to a museum. Now it was indeed\r\nthat Fleda knew what rested on her; now it was also that she measured as\r\nif for the first time Mrs. Gereth\'s view of the natural influence of a\r\nfine acquisition. She had adopted the idea of blowing away the last\r\ndoubt of what her young friend would gain, of making good still more\r\nthan she was obliged to make it the promise of weeks before. It was one\r\nthing for the girl to have heard that in a certain event restitution\r\nwould be made; it was another for her to see the condition, with a noble\r\ntrust, treated in advance as performed, and to be able to feel that she\r\nshould have only to open a door to find every old piece in every old\r\ncorner. To have played such a card was therefore, practically, for Mrs.\r\nGereth, to have won the game. Fleda had certainly to recognize that, so\r\nfar as the theory of the matter went, the game had been won. Oh, she had\r\nbeen made sure of!\r\n\r\nShe couldn\'t, however, succeed for so very many minutes in deferring her\r\nexposure. "Why didn\'t you wait, dearest? Ah, why didn\'t you wait?"--if\r\nthat inconsequent appeal kept rising to her lips to be cut short before\r\nit was spoken, this was only because at first the humility of gratitude\r\nhelped her to gain time, enabled her to present herself very honestly as\r\ntoo overcome to be clear. She kissed her companion\'s hands, she did\r\nhomage at her feet, she murmured soft snatches of praise, and yet in the\r\nmidst of it all was conscious that what she really showed most was the\r\nwan despair at her heart. She saw Mrs. Gereth\'s glimpse of this despair\r\nsuddenly widen, heard the quick chill of her voice pierce through the\r\nfalse courage of endearments. "Do you mean to tell me at such an hour as\r\nthis that you\'ve really lost him?"\r\n\r\nThe tone of the question made the idea a possibility for which Fleda had\r\nnothing from this moment but terror. "I don\'t know, Mrs. Gereth; how can\r\nI say?" she asked. "I\'ve not seen him for so long; as I told you just\r\nnow, I don\'t even know where he is. That\'s by no fault of his," she\r\nhurried on: "he would have been with me every day if I had consented.\r\nBut I made him understand, the last time, that I\'ll receive him again\r\nonly when he\'s able to show me that his release has been complete and\r\ndefinite. Oh, he can\'t yet, don\'t you see, and that\'s why he hasn\'t been\r\nback. It\'s far better than his coming only that we should both be\r\nmiserable. When he does come he\'ll be in a better position. He\'ll be\r\ntremendously moved by the splendid thing you\'ve done. I know you wish me\r\nto feel that you\'ve done it as much for me as for Owen, but your having\r\ndone it for me is just what will delight him most! When he hears of it,"\r\nsaid Fleda, in desperate optimism, "when he hears of it--" There indeed,\r\nregretting her advance, she quite broke down. She was wholly powerless\r\nto say what Owen would do when he heard of it. "I don\'t know what he\r\nwon\'t make of you and how he won\'t hug you!" she had to content herself\r\nwith lamely declaring. She had drawn Mrs. Gereth to a sofa with a vague\r\ninstinct of pacifying her and still, after all, gaining time; but it was\r\na position in which her great duped benefactress, portentously patient\r\nagain during this demonstration, looked far from inviting a "hug." Fleda\r\nfound herself tricking out the situation with artificial flowers, trying\r\nto talk even herself into the fancy that Owen, whose name she now made\r\nsimple and sweet, might come in upon them at any moment. She felt an\r\nimmense need to be understood and justified; she averted her face in\r\ndread from all that she might have to be forgiven. She pressed on her\r\ncompanion\'s arm as if to keep her quiet till she should really know, and\r\nthen, after a minute, she poured out the clear essence of what in\r\nhappier days had been her "secret." "You mustn\'t think I don\'t adore him\r\nwhen I\'ve told him so to his face. I love him so that I\'d die for him--I\r\nlove him so that it\'s horrible. Don\'t look at me therefore as if I had\r\nnot been kind, as if I had not been as tender as if he were dying and my\r\ntenderness were what would save him. Look at me as if you believe me, as\r\nif you feel what I\'ve been through. Darling Mrs. Gereth, I could kiss\r\nthe ground he walks on. I haven\'t a rag of pride; I used to have, but\r\nit\'s gone. I used to have a secret, but every one knows it now, and any\r\none who looks at me can say, I think, what\'s the matter with me. It\'s\r\nnot so very fine, my secret, and the less one really says about it the\r\nbetter; but I want you to have it from me because I was stiff before. I\r\nwant you to see for yourself that I\'ve been brought as low as a girl can\r\nvery well be. It serves me right," Fleda laughed, "if I was ever proud\r\nand horrid to you! I don\'t know what you wanted me, in those days at\r\nRicks, to do, but I don\'t think you can have wanted much more than what\r\nI\'ve done. The other day at Maggie\'s I did things that made me,\r\nafterwards, think of you! I don\'t know what girls may do; but if he\r\ndoesn\'t know that there isn\'t an inch of me that isn\'t his--!" Fleda\r\nsighed as if she couldn\'t express it; she piled it up, as she would have\r\nsaid; holding Mrs. Gereth with dilated eyes, she seemed to sound her for\r\nthe effect of these words. "It\'s idiotic," she wearily smiled; "it\'s so\r\nstrange that I\'m almost angry for it, and the strangest part of all is\r\nthat it isn\'t even happiness. It\'s anguish--it was from the first; from\r\nthe first there was a bitterness and a kind of dread. But I owe you\r\nevery word of the truth. You don\'t do him justice, either: he\'s a dear,\r\nI assure you he\'s a dear. I\'d trust him to the last breath; I don\'t\r\nthink you really know him. He\'s ever so much cleverer than he makes a\r\nshow of; he\'s remarkable in his own shy way. You told me at Ricks that\r\nyou wanted me to let myself go, and I\'ve \'gone\' quite far enough to\r\ndiscover as much as that, as well as all sorts of other delightful\r\nthings about him. You\'ll tell me I make myself out worse than I am,"\r\nsaid the girl, feeling more and more in her companion\'s attitude a\r\nquality that treated her speech as a desperate rigmarole and even\r\nperhaps as a piece of cold immodesty. She wanted to make herself out\r\n"bad"--it was a part of her justification; but it suddenly occurred to\r\nher that such a picture of her extravagance imputed a want of gallantry\r\nto the young man. "I don\'t care for anything you think," she declared,\r\n"because Owen, don\'t you know, sees me as I am. He\'s so kind that it\r\nmakes up for everything!"\r\n\r\nThis attempt at gayety was futile; the silence with which, for a minute,\r\nher adversary greeted her troubled plea brought home to her afresh that\r\nshe was on the bare defensive. "Is it a part of his kindness never to\r\ncome near you?" Mrs. Gereth inquired at last. "Is it a part of his\r\nkindness to leave you without an inkling of where he is?" She rose again\r\nfrom where Fleda had kept her down; she seemed to tower there in the\r\nmajesty of her gathered wrong. "Is it a part of his kindness that, after\r\nI\'ve toiled as I\'ve done for six days, and with my own weak hands, which\r\nI haven\'t spared, to denude myself, in your interest, to that point that\r\nI\'ve nothing left, as I may say, but what I have on my back--is it a\r\npart of his kindness that you\'re not even able to produce him for me?"\r\n\r\nThere was a high contempt in this which was for Owen quite as much, and\r\nin the light of which Fleda felt that her effort at plausibility had\r\nbeen mere groveling. She rose from the sofa with an humiliated sense of\r\nrising from ineffectual knees. That discomfort, however, lived but an\r\ninstant: it was swept away in a rush of loyalty to the absent. She\r\nherself could bear his mother\'s scorn; but to avert it from his sweet\r\ninnocence she broke out with a quickness that was like the raising of an\r\narm. "Don\'t blame him--don\'t blame him: he\'d do anything on earth for\r\nme! It was I," said Fleda, eagerly, "who sent him back to her; I made\r\nhim go; I pushed him out of the house; I declined to have anything to\r\nsay to him except on another footing."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth stared as at some gross material ravage. "Another footing?\r\nWhat other footing?"\r\n\r\n"The one I\'ve already made so clear to you: my having it in black and\r\nwhite, as you may say, from her that she freely gives him up."\r\n\r\n"Then you think he lies when he tells you that he has recovered his\r\nliberty?"\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated a moment; after which she exclaimed with a certain hard\r\npride: "He\'s enough in love with me for anything!"\r\n\r\n"For anything, apparently, except to act like a man and impose his\r\nreason and his will on your incredible folly. For anything except to put\r\nan end, as any man worthy of the name would have put it, to your\r\nsystematic, to your idiotic perversity. What are you, after all, my\r\ndear, I should like to know, that a gentleman who offers you what Owen\r\noffers should have to meet such wonderful exactions, to take such\r\nextraordinary precautions about your sweet little scruples?" Her\r\nresentment rose to a strange insolence which Fleda took full in the face\r\nand which, for the moment at least, had the horrible force to present to\r\nher vengefully a showy side of the truth. It gave her a blinding glimpse\r\nof lost alternatives. "I don\'t know what to think of him," Mrs. Gereth\r\nwent on; "I don\'t know what to call him: I\'m so ashamed of him that I\r\ncan scarcely speak of him even to _you_. But indeed I\'m so ashamed of\r\nyou both together that I scarcely know in common decency where to look."\r\nShe paused to give Fleda the full benefit of this remarkable statement;\r\nthen she exclaimed: "Any one but a jackass would have tucked you under\r\nhis arm and marched you off to the Registrar!"\r\n\r\nFleda wondered; with her free imagination she could wonder even while\r\nher cheek stung from a slap. "To the Registrar?"\r\n\r\n"That would have been the sane, sound, immediate course to adopt. With a\r\ngrain of gumption you\'d both instantly have felt it. _I_ should have\r\nfound a way to take you, you know, if I\'d been what Owen\'s supposed to\r\nbe. _I_ should have got the business over first; the rest could come\r\nwhen you liked! Good God, girl, your place was to stand before me as a\r\nwoman honestly married. One doesn\'t know what one has hold of in\r\ntouching you, and you must excuse my saying that you\'re literally\r\nunpleasant to me to meet as you are. Then at least we could have talked,\r\nand Owen, if he had the ghost of a sense of humor, could have snapped\r\nhis fingers at your refinements."\r\n\r\nThis stirring speech affected our young lady as if it had been the shake\r\nof a tambourine borne towards her from a gypsy dance: her head seemed to\r\ngo round and she felt a sudden passion in her feet. The emotion,\r\nhowever, was but meagrely expressed in the flatness with which she heard\r\nherself presently say: "I\'ll go to the Registrar now."\r\n\r\n"Now?" Magnificent was the sound Mrs. Gereth threw into this\r\nmonosyllable. "And pray who\'s to take you?" Fleda gave a colorless\r\nsmile, and her companion continued: "Do you literally mean that you\r\ncan\'t put your hand upon him?" Fleda\'s wan grimace appeared to irritate\r\nher; she made a short, imperious gesture. "Find him for me, you\r\nfool--_find_ him for me!"\r\n\r\n"What do you want of him," Fleda sadly asked, "feeling as you do to both\r\nof us?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind how I feel, and never mind what I say when I\'m furious!"\r\nMrs. Gereth still more incisively added. "Of course I cling to you, you\r\nwretches, or I shouldn\'t suffer as I do. What I want of him is to see\r\nthat he takes you; what I want of him is to go with you myself to the\r\nplace." She looked round the room as if, in feverish haste, for a mantle\r\nto catch up; she bustled to the window as if to spy out a cab: she would\r\nallow half an hour for the job. Already in her bonnet, she had snatched\r\nfrom the sofa a garment for the street: she jerked it on as she came\r\nback. "Find him, find him," she repeated; "come straight out with me, to\r\ntry, at least, to get at him!"\r\n\r\n"How can I get at him? He\'ll come when he\'s ready," Fleda replied.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth turned on her sharply. "Ready for what? Ready to see me\r\nruined without a reason or a reward?"\r\n\r\nFleda was silent; the worst of it all was that there was something\r\nunspoken between them. Neither of them dared to utter it, but the\r\ninfluence of it was in the girl\'s tone when she returned at last, with\r\ngreat gentleness: "Don\'t be harsh to me--I\'m very unhappy." The words\r\nproduced a visible impression on Mrs. Gereth, who held her face averted\r\nand sent off through the window a gaze that kept pace with the long\r\ncaravan of her treasures. Fleda knew she was watching it wind up the\r\navenue of Poynton--Fleda participated indeed fully in the vision; so\r\nthat after a little the most consoling thing seemed to her to add: "I\r\ndon\'t see why in the world you take so for granted that he\'s, as you\r\nsay, \'lost.\'"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth continued to stare out of the window, and her stillness\r\ndenoted some success in controlling herself. "If he\'s not lost, why are\r\nyou unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m unhappy because I torment you, and you don\'t understand me."\r\n\r\n"No, Fleda, I don\'t understand you," said Mrs. Gereth, finally facing\r\nher again. "I don\'t understand you at all, and it\'s as if you and Owen\r\nwere of quite another race and another flesh. You make me feel very\r\nold-fashioned and simple and bad. But you must take me as I am, since\r\nyou take so much else _with_ me!" She spoke now with the drop of her\r\nresentment, with a dry and weary calm. "It would have been better for me\r\nif I had never known you," she pursued, "and certainly better if I\r\nhadn\'t taken such an extraordinary fancy to you. But that too was\r\ninevitable: everything, I suppose, is inevitable. It was all my own\r\ndoing--you didn\'t run after me: I pounced on you and caught you up.\r\nYou\'re a stiff little beggar, in spite of your pretty manners: yes,\r\nyou\'re hideously misleading. I hope you feel how handsome it is of me to\r\nrecognize the independence of your character. It was your clever\r\nsympathy that did it--your extraordinary feeling for those accursed\r\nvanities. You were sharper about them than any one I had ever known, and\r\nthat was a thing I simply couldn\'t resist. Well," the poor lady\r\nconcluded after a pause, "you see where it has landed us!"\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll go for him yourself, I\'ll wait here," said Fleda.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth, holding her mantle together, appeared for a while to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n"To his club, do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it there, when he\'s in town, that he has a room? He has at\r\npresent no other London address," Fleda said: "it\'s there one writes to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"How do _I_ know, with my wretched relations with him?" Mrs. Gereth\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Mine have not been quite so bad as that," Fleda desperately smiled.\r\nThen she added: "His silence, _her_ silence, our hearing nothing at\r\nall--what are these but the very things on which, at Poynton and at\r\nRicks, you rested your assurance that everything is at an end between\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth looked dark and void. "Yes, but I hadn\'t heard from you then\r\nthat you could invent nothing better than, as you call it, to send him\r\nback to her."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but, on the other hand, you\'ve learned from them what you didn\'t\r\nknow--you\'ve learned by Mrs. Brigstock\'s visit that he cares for me."\r\nFleda found herself in the position of availing herself of optimistic\r\narguments that she formerly had repudiated; her refutation of her\r\ncompanion had completely changed its ground.\r\n\r\nShe was in a fever of ingenuity and painfully conscious, on behalf of\r\nher success, that her fever was visible. She could herself see the\r\nreflection of it glitter in Mrs. Gereth\'s sombre eyes.\r\n\r\n"You plunge me in stupefaction," that lady answered, "and at the same\r\ntime you terrify me. Your account of Owen is inconceivable, and yet I\r\ndon\'t know what to hold on by. He cares for you, it does appear, and yet\r\nin the same breath you inform me that nothing is more possible than that\r\nhe\'s spending these days at Waterbath. Excuse me if I\'m so dull as not\r\nto see my way in such darkness. If he\'s at Waterbath he doesn\'t care for\r\nyou. If he cares for you he\'s not at Waterbath."\r\n\r\n"Then where is he?" poor Fleda helplessly wailed. She caught herself up,\r\nhowever; she did her best to be brave and clear. Before Mrs. Gereth\r\ncould reply, with due obviousness, that this was a question for her not\r\nto ask, but to answer, she found an air of assurance to say: "You\r\nsimplify far too much. You always did and you always will. The tangle of\r\nlife is much more intricate than you\'ve ever, I think, felt it to be.\r\nYou slash into it," cried Fleda finely, "with a great pair of shears,\r\nyou nip at it as if you were one of the Fates! If Owen\'s at Waterbath\r\nhe\'s there to wind everything up."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth shook her head with slow austerity. "You don\'t believe a\r\nword you\'re saying. I\'ve frightened you, as you\'ve frightened me: you\'re\r\nwhistling in the dark to keep up our courage. I do simplify, doubtless,\r\nif to simplify is to fail to comprehend the insanity of a passion that\r\nbewilders a young blockhead with bugaboo barriers, with hideous and\r\nmonstrous sacrifices. I can only repeat that you\'re beyond me. Your\r\nperversity\'s a thing to howl over. However," the poor woman continued\r\nwith a break in her voice, a long hesitation and then the dry triumph of\r\nher will, "I\'ll never mention it to you again! Owen I can just make out;\r\nfor Owen _is_ a blockhead. Owen\'s a blockhead," she repeated with a\r\nquiet, tragic finality, looking straight into Fleda\'s eyes. "I don\'t\r\nknow why you dress up so the fact that he\'s disgustingly weak."\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated; at last, before her companion\'s, she lowered her look.\r\n"Because I love him. It\'s because he\'s weak that he needs me," she\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n"That was why his father, whom he exactly resembles, needed _me_. And I\r\ndidn\'t fail his father," said Mrs. Gereth. She gave Fleda a moment to\r\nappreciate the remark; after which she pursued: "Mona Brigstock isn\'t\r\nweak; she\'s stronger than you!"\r\n\r\n"I never thought she was weak," Fleda answered. She looked vaguely round\r\nthe room with a new purpose: she had lost sight of her umbrella.\r\n\r\n"I did tell you to let yourself go, but it\'s clear enough that you\r\nreally haven\'t," Mrs. Gereth declared. "If Mona has got him--"\r\n\r\nFleda had accomplished her search; her interlocutress paused. "If Mona\r\nhas got him?" the girl inquired, tightening the umbrella.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mrs. Gereth profoundly, "it will be clear enough that Mona\r\n_has_."\r\n\r\n"Has let herself go?"\r\n\r\n"Has let herself go." Mrs. Gereth spoke as if she saw it in every\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nFleda felt the tone and finished her preparation; then she went and\r\nopened the door. "We\'ll look for him together," she said to her friend,\r\nwho stood a moment taking in her face. "They may know something about\r\nhim at the Colonel\'s."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go there." Mrs. Gereth had picked up her gloves and her purse.\r\n"But the first thing," she went on, "will be to wire to Poynton."\r\n\r\n"Why not to Waterbath at once?" Fleda asked.\r\n\r\nHer companion hesitated. "In _your_ name?"\r\n\r\n"In my name. I noticed a place at the corner."\r\n\r\nWhile Fleda held the door open Mrs. Gereth drew on her gloves. "Forgive\r\nme," she presently said. "Kiss me," she added.\r\n\r\nFleda, on the threshold, kissed her; then they went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the place at the corner, on the chance of its saving time, Fleda\r\nwrote her telegram--wrote it in silence under Mrs. Gereth\'s eye and then\r\nin silence handed it to her. "I send this to Waterbath, on the\r\npossibility of your being there, to ask you to come to me." Mrs. Gereth\r\nheld it a moment, read it more than once; then keeping it, and with her\r\neyes on her companion, seemed to consider. There was the dawn of a\r\nkindness in her look; Fleda perceived in it, as if as the reward of\r\ncomplete submission, a slight relaxation of her rigor.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t it perhaps after all be better," she asked, "before doing\r\nthis, to see if we can make his whereabouts certain?"\r\n\r\n"Why so? It will be always so much done," said Fleda. "Though I\'m poor,"\r\nshe added with a smile, "I don\'t mind the shilling."\r\n\r\n"The shilling\'s _my_ shilling," said Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\nFleda stayed her hand. "No, no--I\'m superstitious."\r\n\r\n"Superstitious?"\r\n\r\n"To succeed, it must be all me!"\r\n\r\n"Well, if that will make it succeed!" Mrs. Gereth took back her\r\nshilling, but she still kept the telegram. "As he\'s most probably not\r\nthere--"\r\n\r\n"If he shouldn\'t be there," Fleda interrupted, "there will be no harm\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"If he \'shouldn\'t be\' there!" Mrs. Gereth ejaculated. "Heaven help us,\r\nhow you assume it!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m only prepared for the worst. The Brigstocks will simply send any\r\ntelegram on."\r\n\r\n"Where will they send it?"\r\n\r\n"Presumably to Poynton."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll read it first," said Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\n"Read it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mona will. She\'ll open it under the pretext of having it repeated;\r\nand then she\'ll probably do nothing. She\'ll keep it as a proof of your\r\nimmodesty."\r\n\r\n"What of that?" asked Fleda.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mind her seeing it?"\r\n\r\nRather musingly and absently Fleda shook her head. "I don\'t mind\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, that\'s all right," said Mrs. Gereth as if she had only\r\nwanted to feel that she had been irreproachably considerate. After this\r\nshe was gentler still, but she had another point to clear up. "Why have\r\nyou given, for a reply, your sister\'s address?"\r\n\r\n"Because if he _does_ come to me he must come to me there. If that\r\ntelegram goes," said Fleda, "I return to Maggie\'s to-night."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth seemed to wonder at this. "You won\'t receive him here with\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t receive him here with you. Only where I received him\r\nlast--only there again." She showed her companion that as to that she\r\nwas firm.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Gereth had obviously now had some practice in following queer\r\nmovements prompted by queer feelings. She resigned herself, though she\r\nfingered the paper a moment longer. She appeared to hesitate; then she\r\nbrought out: "You couldn\'t then, if I release you, make your message a\r\nlittle stronger?"\r\n\r\nFleda gave her a faint smile. "He\'ll come if he can."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth met fully what this conveyed; with decision she pushed in\r\nthe telegram. But she laid her hand quickly upon another form and with\r\nstill greater decision wrote another message. "From _me_, this," she\r\nsaid to Fleda when she had finished: "to catch him possibly at Poynton.\r\nWill you read it?"\r\n\r\nFleda turned away. "Thank you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s stronger than yours."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Fleda, moving to the door. Mrs. Gereth, having paid\r\nfor the second missive, rejoined her, and they drove together to Owen\'s\r\nclub, where the elder lady alone got out. Fleda, from the hansom,\r\nwatched through the glass doors her brief conversation with the\r\nhall-porter and then met in silence her return with the news that he had\r\nnot seen Owen for a fortnight and was keeping his letters till called\r\nfor. These had been the last orders; there were a dozen letters lying\r\nthere. He had no more information to give, but they would see what they\r\ncould find at Colonel Gereth\'s. To any connection with this inquiry,\r\nhowever, Fleda now roused herself to object, and her friend had indeed\r\nto recognize that on second thoughts it couldn\'t be quite to the taste\r\nof either of them to advertise in the remoter reaches of the family that\r\nthey had forfeited the confidence of the master of Poynton. The letters\r\nlying at the club proved effectively that he was not in London, and this\r\nwas the question that immediately concerned them. Nothing could concern\r\nthem further till the answers to their telegrams should have had time to\r\narrive. Mrs. Gereth had got back into the cab, and, still at the door of\r\nthe club, they sat staring at their need of patience. Fleda\'s eyes\r\nrested, in the great hard street, on passing figures that struck her as\r\npuppets pulled by strings. After a little the driver challenged them\r\nthrough the hole in the top. "Anywhere in particular, ladies?"\r\n\r\nFleda decided. "Drive to Euston, please."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t wait for what we may hear?" Mrs. Gereth asked.\r\n\r\n"Whatever we hear, I must go." As the cab went on she added: "But I\r\nneedn\'t drag _you_ to the station."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth was silent a moment; then "Nonsense!" she sharply replied.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this sharpness they were now almost equally and almost\r\ntremulously mild; though their mildness took mainly the form of an\r\ninevitable sense of nothing left to say. It was the unsaid that occupied\r\nthem--the thing that for more than an hour they had been going round and\r\nround without naming it. Much too early for Fleda\'s train, they\r\nencountered at the station a long half-hour to wait. Fleda made no\r\nfurther allusion to Mrs. Gereth\'s leaving her; their dumbness, with the\r\nelapsing minutes, grew to be in itself a reconstituted bond. They slowly\r\npaced the great gray platform, and presently Mrs. Gereth took the girl\'s\r\narm and leaned on it with a hard demand for support. It seemed to Fleda\r\nnot difficult for each to know of what the other was thinking--to know\r\nindeed that they had in common two alternating visions, one of which, at\r\nmoments, brought them as by a common impulse to a pause. This was the\r\none that was fixed; the other filled at times the whole space and then\r\nwas shouldered away. Owen and Mona glared together out of the gloom and\r\ndisappeared, but the replenishment of Poynton made a shining, steady\r\nlight. The old splendor was there again, the old things were in their\r\nplaces. Our friends looked at them with an equal yearning; face to face,\r\non the platform, they counted them in each other\'s eyes. Fleda had come\r\nback to them by a road as strange as the road they themselves had\r\nfollowed. The wonder of their great journeys, the prodigy of this second\r\none, was the question that made her occasionally stop. Several times she\r\nuttered it, asked how this and that difficulty had been met. Mrs. Gereth\r\nreplied with pale lucidity--was naturally the person most familiar with\r\nthe truth that what she undertook was always somehow achieved. To do it\r\nwas to do it--she had more than one kind of magnificence. She confessed\r\nthere, audaciously enough, to a sort of arrogance of energy, and Fleda,\r\ngoing on again, her inquiry more than answered and her arm rendering\r\nservice, flushed, in her diminished identity, with the sense that such a\r\nwoman was great.\r\n\r\n"You do mean literally everything, to the last little miniature on the\r\nlast little screen?"\r\n\r\n"I mean literally everything. Go over them with the catalogue!"\r\n\r\nFleda went over them while they walked again; she had no need of the\r\ncatalogue. At last she spoke once more: "Even the Maltese cross?"\r\n\r\n"Even the Maltese cross. Why not that as well as everything\r\nelse?--especially as I remembered how you like it."\r\n\r\nFinally, after an interval, the girl exclaimed: "But the mere fatigue of\r\nit, the exhaustion of such a feat! I drag you to and fro here while you\r\nmust be ready to drop."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very, very tired." Mrs. Gereth\'s slow head-shake was tragic. "I\r\ncouldn\'t do it again."\r\n\r\n"I doubt if they\'d bear it again!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s another matter: they\'d bear it if I could. There won\'t have\r\nbeen, this time either, a shake or a scratch. But I\'m too tired--I very\r\nnearly don\'t care."\r\n\r\n"You must sit down, then, till I go," said Fleda. "We must find a\r\nbench."\r\n\r\n"No. I\'m tired of _them_: I\'m not tired of you. This is the way for you\r\nto feel most how much I rest on you." Fleda had a compunction, wondering\r\nas they continued to stroll whether it was right after all to leave her.\r\nShe believed, however, that if the flame might for the moment burn low,\r\nit was far from dying out; an impression presently confirmed by the way\r\nMrs. Gereth went on: "But one\'s fatigue is nothing. The idea under which\r\none worked kept one up. For you I _could_--I can still. Nothing will\r\nhave mattered if _she\'s_ not there."\r\n\r\nThere was a question that this imposed, but Fleda at first found no\r\nvoice to utter it: it was the thing that, between them, since her\r\narrival, had been so consciously and vividly unsaid. Finally she was\r\nable to breathe: "And if she _is_ there--if she\'s there already?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth\'s rejoinder too hung back; then when it came--from sad eyes\r\nas well as from lips barely moved--it was unexpectedly merciful. "It\r\nwill be very hard." That was all, now; and it was poignantly simple. The\r\ntrain Fleda was to take had drawn up; the girl kissed her as if in\r\nfarewell. Mrs. Gereth submitted, then after a little brought out: "If we\r\n_have_ lost--"\r\n\r\n"If we have lost?" Fleda repeated as she paused again.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll all the same come abroad with me?"\r\n\r\n"It will seem very strange to me if you want me. But whatever you ask,\r\nwhatever you need, that I will always do."\r\n\r\n"I shall need your company," said Mrs. Gereth. Fleda wondered an instant\r\nif this were not practically a demand for penal submission--for a\r\nsurrender that, in its complete humility, would be a long expiation. But\r\nthere was none of the latent chill of the vindictive in the way Mrs.\r\nGereth pursued: "We can always, as time goes on, talk of them together."\r\n\r\n"Of the old things?" Fleda had selected a third-class compartment: she\r\nstood a moment looking into it and at a fat woman with a basket who had\r\nalready taken possession. "Always?" she said, turning again to her\r\ncompanion. "Never!" she exclaimed. She got into the carriage, and two\r\nmen with bags and boxes immediately followed, blocking up door and\r\nwindow so long that when she was able to look out again Mrs. Gereth had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came to her at her sister\'s no telegram in answer to her own: the\r\nrest of that day and the whole of the next elapsed without a word either\r\nfrom Owen or from his mother. She was free, however, to her infinite\r\nrelief, from any direct dealing with suspense, and conscious, to her\r\nsurprise, of nothing that could show her, or could show Maggie and her\r\nbrother-in-law, that she was excited. Her excitement was composed of\r\npulses as swift and fine as the revolutions of a spinning top: she\r\nsupposed she was going round, but she went round so fast that she\r\ncouldn\'t even feel herself move. Her emotion occupied some quarter of\r\nher soul that had closed its doors for the day and shut out even her own\r\nsense of it; she might perhaps have heard something if she had pressed\r\nher ear to a partition. Instead of that she sat with her patience in a\r\ncold, still chamber from which she could look out in quite another\r\ndirection. This was to have achieved an equilibrium to which she\r\ncouldn\'t have given a name: indifference, resignation, despair were the\r\nterms of a forgotten tongue. The time even seemed not long, for the\r\nstages of the journey were the items of Mrs. Gereth\'s surrender. The\r\ndetail of that performance, which filled the scene, was what Fleda had\r\nnow before her eyes. The part of her loss that she could think of was\r\nthe reconstituted splendor of Poynton. It was the beauty she was most\r\ntouched by that, in tons, she had lost--the beauty that, charged upon\r\nbig wagons, had safely crept back to its home. But the loss was a gain\r\nto memory and love; it was to her too, at last, that, in condonation of\r\nher treachery, the old things had crept back. She greeted them with open\r\narms; she thought of them hour after hour; they made a company with\r\nwhich solitude was warm and a picture that, at this crisis, overlaid\r\npoor Maggie\'s scant mahogany. It was really her obliterated passion that\r\nhad revived, and with it an immense assent to Mrs. Gereth\'s early\r\njudgment of her. She too, she felt, was of the religion, and like any\r\nother of the passionately pious she could worship now even in the\r\ndesert. Yes, it was all for her; far round as she had gone she had been\r\nstrong enough: her love had gathered in the spoils. She wanted indeed no\r\ncatalogue to count them over; the array of them, miles away, was\r\ncomplete; each piece, in its turn, was perfect to her; she could have\r\ndrawn up a catalogue from memory. Thus again she lived with them, and\r\nshe thought of them without a question of any personal right. That they\r\nmight have been, that they might still be hers, that they were perhaps\r\nalready another\'s, were ideas that had too little to say to her. They\r\nwere nobody\'s at all--too proud, unlike base animals and humans, to be\r\nreducible to anything so narrow. It was Poynton that was theirs; they\r\nhad simply recovered their own. The joy of that for them was the source\r\nof the strange peace in which the girl found herself floating.\r\n\r\nIt was broken on the third day by a telegram from Mrs. Gereth. "Shall be\r\nwith you at 11.30--don\'t meet me at station." Fleda turned this over,\r\nbut was sufficiently expert not to disobey the injunction. She had only\r\nan hour to take in its meaning, but that hour was longer than all the\r\nprevious time. If Maggie had studied her convenience the day Owen came,\r\nMaggie was also at the present juncture a miracle of refinement.\r\nIncreasingly and resentfully mystified, in spite of all reassurance, by\r\nthe impression that Fleda suffered more than she gained from the\r\ngrandeur of the Gereths, she had it at heart to exemplify the perhaps\r\ntruer distinction of nature that characterized the house of Vetch. She\r\nwas not, like poor Fleda, at every one\'s beck, and the visitor was to\r\nsee no more of her than what the arrangement of luncheon might\r\ntantalizingly show. Maggie described herself to her sister as intending\r\nfor a just provocation even the understanding she had had with her\r\nhusband that he also should remain invisible. Fleda accordingly awaited\r\nalone the subject of so many manoeuvres--a period that was slightly\r\nprolonged even after the drawing-room door, at 11.30, was thrown open.\r\nMrs. Gereth stood there with a face that spoke plain, but no sound fell\r\nfrom her till the withdrawal of the maid, whose attention had\r\nimmediately attached itself to the rearrangement of a window-blind and\r\nwho seemed, while she bustled at it, to contribute to the pregnant\r\nsilence; before the duration of which, however, she retreated with a\r\nsudden stare.\r\n\r\n"He has done it," said Mrs. Gereth, turning her eyes avoidingly but not\r\nunperceivingly about her and in spite of herself dropping an opinion\r\nupon the few objects in the room. Fleda, on her side, in her silence,\r\nobserved how characteristically she looked at Maggie\'s possessions\r\nbefore looking at Maggie\'s sister. The girl understood and at first had\r\nnothing to say; she was still dumb while Mrs. Gereth selected, with\r\nhesitation, a seat less distasteful than the one that happened to be\r\nnearest. On the sofa near the window the poor woman finally showed what\r\nthe two past days had done for the age of her face. Her eyes at last met\r\nFleda\'s. "It\'s the end."\r\n\r\n"They\'re married?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re married."\r\n\r\nFleda came to the sofa in obedience to the impulse to sit down by her;\r\nthen paused before her while Mrs. Gereth turned up a dead gray mask. A\r\ntired old woman sat there with empty hands in her lap. "I\'ve heard\r\nnothing," said Fleda. "No answer came."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the only answer. It\'s the answer to everything." So Fleda saw;\r\nfor a minute she looked over her companion\'s head and far away. "He\r\nwasn\'t at Waterbath; Mrs. Brigstock must have read your telegram and\r\nkept it. But mine, the one to Poynton, brought something. \'We are\r\nhere--what do you want?\'" Mrs. Gereth stopped as if with a failure of\r\nvoice; on which Fleda sank upon the sofa and made a movement to take her\r\nhand. It met no response; there could be no attenuation. Fleda waited;\r\nthey sat facing each other like strangers. "I wanted to go down," Mrs.\r\nGereth presently continued. "Well, I went."\r\n\r\nAll the girl\'s effort tended for the time to a single aim--that of\r\ntaking the thing with outward detachment, speaking of it as having\r\nhappened to Owen and to his mother and not in any degree to herself.\r\nSomething at least of this was in the encouraging way she said:\r\n"Yesterday morning?"\r\n\r\n"Yesterday morning. I saw him."\r\n\r\nFleda hesitated. "Did you see _her_?"\r\n\r\n"Thank God, no!"\r\n\r\nFleda laid on her arm a hand of vague comfort, of which Mrs. Gereth took\r\nno notice. "You\'ve been capable, just to tell me, of this wretched\r\njourney, of this consideration that I don\'t deserve?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re together, we\'re together," said Mrs. Gereth. She looked helpless\r\nas she sat there, her eyes, unseeingly enough, on a tall Dutch clock,\r\nold but rather poor, that Maggie had had as a wedding-gift and that eked\r\nout the bareness of the room.\r\n\r\nTo Fleda, in the face of the event, it appeared that this was exactly\r\nwhat they were not: the last inch of common ground, the ground of their\r\npast intercourse, had fallen from under them. Yet what was still there\r\nwas the grand style of her companion\'s treatment of her. Mrs. Gereth\r\ncouldn\'t stand upon small questions, couldn\'t, in conduct, make small\r\ndifferences. "You\'re magnificent!" her young friend exclaimed. "There\'s\r\na rare greatness in your generosity."\r\n\r\n"We\'re together, we\'re together," Mrs. Gereth lifelessly repeated.\r\n"That\'s all we _are_ now; it\'s all we have." The words brought to Fleda\r\na sudden vision of the empty little house at Ricks; such a vision might\r\nalso have been what her companion found in the face of the stopped Dutch\r\nclock. Yet with this it was clear that she would now show no bitterness:\r\nshe had done with that, had given the last drop to those horrible hours\r\nin London. No passion even was left to her, and her forbearance only\r\nadded to the force with which she represented the final vanity of\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nFleda was so far from a wish to triumph that she was absolutely ashamed\r\nof having anything to say for herself; but there was one thing, all the\r\nsame, that not to say was impossible. "That he has done it, that he\r\ncouldn\'t _not_ do it, shows how right I was." It settled forever her\r\nattitude, and she spoke as if for her own mind; then after a little she\r\nadded very gently, for Mrs. Gereth\'s: "That\'s to say, it shows that he\r\nwas bound to her by an obligation that, however much he may have wanted\r\nto, he couldn\'t in any sort of honor break."\r\n\r\nBlanched and bleak, Mrs. Gereth looked at her. "What sort of an\r\nobligation do you call that? No such obligation exists for an hour\r\nbetween any man and any woman who have hatred on one side. He had ended\r\nby hating her, and now he hates her more than ever."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you so?" Fleda asked.\r\n\r\n"No. He told me nothing but the great gawk of a fact. I saw him but for\r\nthree minutes." She was silent again, and Fleda, as before some lurid\r\nimage of this interview, sat without speaking. "Do you wish to appear as\r\nif you don\'t care?" Mrs. Gereth presently demanded.\r\n\r\n"I\'m trying not to think of myself."\r\n\r\n"Then if you\'re thinking of Owen, how can you _bear_ to think?"\r\n\r\nSadly and submissively Fleda shook her head; the slow tears had come\r\ninto her eyes. "I can\'t. I don\'t understand--I don\'t understand!" she\r\nbroke out.\r\n\r\n"_I_ do, then." Mrs. Gereth looked hard at the floor. "There was no\r\nobligation at the time you saw him last--when you sent him, hating her\r\nas he did, back to her."\r\n\r\n"If he went," Fleda asked, "doesn\'t that exactly prove that he\r\nrecognized one?"\r\n\r\n"He recognized rot! You know what _I_ think of him." Fleda knew; she had\r\nno wish to challenge a fresh statement. Mrs. Gereth made one--it was her\r\nsole, faint flicker of passion--to the extent of declaring that he was\r\ntoo abjectly weak to deserve the name of a man. For all Fleda cared!--it\r\nwas his weakness she loved in him. "He took strange ways of pleasing\r\nyou!" her friend went on. "There was no obligation till suddenly, the\r\nother day, the situation changed."\r\n\r\nFleda wondered. "The other day?"\r\n\r\n"It came to Mona\'s knowledge--I can\'t tell you how, but it came--that\r\nthe things I was sending back had begun to arrive at Poynton. I had sent\r\nthem for you, but it was _her_ I touched." Mrs. Gereth paused; Fleda was\r\ntoo absorbed in her explanation to do anything but take blankly the\r\nfull, cold breath of this. "They were there, and that determined her."\r\n\r\n"Determined her to what?"\r\n\r\n"To act, to take means."\r\n\r\n"To take means?" Fleda repeated.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you what they were, but they were powerful. She knew how,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\nFleda received with the same stoicism the quiet immensity of this\r\nallusion to the person who had not known how. But it made her think a\r\nlittle, and the thought found utterance, with unconscious irony, in the\r\nsimple interrogation: "Mona?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? She\'s a brute."\r\n\r\n"But if he knew that so well, what chance was there in it for her?"\r\n\r\n"How can I tell you? How can I talk of such horrors? I can only give\r\nyou, of the situation, what I see. He knew it, yes. But as she couldn\'t\r\nmake him forget it, she tried to make him like it. She tried and she\r\nsucceeded: that\'s what she did. She\'s after all so much less of a fool\r\nthan he. And what _else_ had he originally liked?" Mrs. Gereth shrugged\r\nher shoulders. "She did what you wouldn\'t!" Fleda\'s face had grown dark\r\nwith her wonder, but her friend\'s empty hands offered no balm to the\r\npain in it. "It was that if it was anything. Nothing else meets the\r\nmisery of it. Then there was quick work. Before he could turn round he\r\nwas married."\r\n\r\nFleda, as if she had been holding her breath, gave the sigh of a\r\nlistening child. "At that place you spoke of in town?"\r\n\r\n"At the Registrar\'s, like a pair of low atheists."\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated. "What do people say of that? I mean the \'world.\'"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, because nobody knows. They\'re to be married on the 17th, at\r\nWaterbath church. If anything else comes out, everybody is a little\r\nprepared. It will pass for some stroke of diplomacy, some move in the\r\ngame, some outwitting of _me_. It\'s known there has been a row with me."\r\n\r\nFleda was mystified. "People surely knew at Poynton," she objected, "if,\r\nas you say, she\'s there."\r\n\r\n"She was there, day before yesterday, only for a few hours. She met him\r\nin London and went down to see the things."\r\n\r\nFleda remembered that she had seen them only once. "Did _you_ see them?"\r\nshe then ventured to ask.\r\n\r\n"Everything."\r\n\r\n"Are they right?"\r\n\r\n"Quite right. There\'s nothing like them," said Mrs. Gereth. At this her\r\ncompanion took up one of her hands again and kissed it as she had done\r\nin London. "Mona went back that night; she was not there yesterday. Owen\r\nstayed on," she added.\r\n\r\nFleda stared. "Then she\'s not to live there?"\r\n\r\n"Rather! But not till after the public marriage." Mrs. Gereth seemed to\r\nmuse; then she brought out: "She\'ll live there alone."\r\n\r\n"Alone?"\r\n\r\n"She\'ll have it to herself."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t live with her?"\r\n\r\n"Never! But she\'s none the less his wife, and you\'re not," said Mrs.\r\nGereth, getting up. "Our only chance is the chance she may die."\r\n\r\nFleda appeared to consider: she appreciated her visitor\'s magnanimous\r\nuse of the plural. "Mona won\'t die," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Well, _I_ shall, thank God! Till then"--and with this, for the first\r\ntime, Mrs. Gereth put out her hand--"don\'t desert me."\r\n\r\nFleda took her hand, and her clasp of it was a reiteration of a promise\r\nalready given. She said nothing, but her silence was an acceptance as\r\nresponsible as the vow of a nun. The next moment something occurred to\r\nher. "I mustn\'t put myself in your son\'s way."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth gave a dry, flat laugh. "You\'re prodigious! But how shall\r\nyou possibly be more out of it? Owen and I--" She didn\'t finish her\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n"That\'s your great feeling about _him_," Fleda said; "but how, after\r\nwhat has happened, can it be his about you?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth hesitated. "How do you know what has happened? You don\'t\r\nknow what I said to him."\r\n\r\n"Yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Yesterday."\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other with a long, deep gaze. Then, as Mrs. Gereth\r\nseemed again about to speak, the girl, closing her eyes, made a gesture\r\nof strong prohibition. "Don\'t tell me!"\r\n\r\n"Merciful powers, how you worship him!" Mrs. Gereth wonderingly moaned.\r\nIt was, for Fleda, the shake that made the cup overflow. She had a\r\npause, that of the child who takes time to know that he responds to an\r\naccident with pain; then, dropping again on the sofa, she broke into\r\ntears. They were beyond control, they came in long sobs, which for a\r\nmoment Mrs. Gereth, almost with an air of indifference, stood hearing\r\nand watching. At last Mrs. Gereth too sank down again. Mrs. Gereth\r\nsoundlessly, wearily wept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\n"It looks just like Waterbath; but, after all, we bore _that_ together:"\r\nthese words formed part of a letter in which, before the 17th, Mrs.\r\nGereth, writing from disfigured Ricks, named to Fleda the day on which\r\nshe would be expected to arrive there on a second visit. "I sha\'n\'t, for\r\na long time to come," the missive continued, "be able to receive any one\r\nwho may _like_ it, who would try to smooth it down, and me with it; but\r\nthere are always things you and I can comfortably hate together, for\r\nyou\'re the only person who comfortably understands. You don\'t understand\r\nquite everything, but of all my acquaintance you\'re far away the least\r\nstupid. For action you\'re no good at all; but action is over, for me,\r\nforever, and you will have the great merit of knowing, when I\'m brutally\r\nsilent, what I shall be thinking about. Without setting myself up for\r\nyour equal, I dare say I shall also know what are your own thoughts.\r\nMoreover, with nothing else but my four walls, you\'ll at any rate be a\r\nbit of furniture. For that, you know, a little, I\'ve always taken\r\nyou--quite one of my best finds. So come, if possible, on the 15th."\r\n\r\nThe position of a bit of furniture was one that Fleda could\r\nconscientiously accept, and she by no means insisted on so high a place\r\nin the list. This communication made her easier, if only by its\r\nacknowledgment that her friend had some thing left: it still implied\r\nrecognition of the principle of property. Something to hate, and to hate\r\n"comfortably," was at least not the utter destitution to which, after\r\ntheir last interview, she had helplessly seemed to see Mrs. Gereth go\r\nforth. She remembered indeed that, in the state in which they first saw\r\nit, she herself had "liked" the blessed refuge of Ricks; and she now\r\nwondered if the tact for which she was commended had then operated to\r\nmake her keep her kindness out of sight. She was at present ashamed of\r\nsuch obliquity, and made up her mind that if this happy impression,\r\nquenched in the spoils of Poynton, should revive on the spot, she would\r\nutter it to her companion without reserve. Yes, she was capable of as\r\nmuch "action" as that: all the more that the spirit of her hostess\r\nseemed, for the time at least, wholly to have failed. Mrs. Gereth\'s\r\nthree minutes with Owen had been a blow to all talk of travel, and after\r\nher woeful hour at Maggie\'s she had, like some great moaning, wounded\r\nbird, made her way, with wings of anguish, back to the nest she knew she\r\nshould find empty. Fleda, on that dire day, could neither keep her nor\r\ngive her up; she had pressingly offered to return with her, but Mrs.\r\nGereth, in spite of the theory that their common grief was a bond, had\r\neven declined all escort to the station, conscious apparently of\r\nsomething abject in her collapse and almost fiercely eager, as with a\r\npersonal shame, to be unwatched. All she had said to Fleda was that she\r\nwould go back to Ricks that night, and the girl had lived for days after\r\nwith a dreadful image of her position and her misery there. She had had\r\na vision of her now lying prone on some unmade bed, now pacing a bare\r\nfloor like a lioness deprived of her cubs. There had been moments when\r\nher mind\'s ear was strained to listen for some sound of grief wild\r\nenough to be wafted from afar. But the first sound, at the end of a\r\nweek, had been a note announcing, without reflections, that the plan of\r\ngoing abroad had been abandoned. "It has come to me indirectly, but with\r\nmuch appearance of truth, that _they_ are going--for an indefinite time.\r\nThat quite settles it; I shall stay where I am, and as soon as I\'ve\r\nturned round again I shall look for you." The second letter had come a\r\nweek later, and on the 15th Fleda was on her way to Ricks.\r\n\r\nHer arrival took the form of a surprise very nearly as violent as that\r\nof the other time. The elements were different, but the effect, like the\r\nother, arrested her on the threshold: she stood there stupefied and\r\ndelighted at the magic of a passion of which such a picture represented\r\nthe low-water mark. Wound up but sincere, and passing quickly from room\r\nto room, Fleda broke out before she even sat down. "If you turn me out\r\nof the house for it, my dear, there isn\'t a woman in England for whom it\r\nwouldn\'t be a privilege to live here." Mrs. Gereth was as honestly\r\nbewildered as she had of old been falsely calm. She looked about at the\r\nfew sticks that, as she afterwards phrased it, she had gathered in, and\r\nthen hard at her guest, as if to protect herself against a joke\r\nsufficiently cruel. The girl\'s heart gave a leap, for this stare was the\r\nsign of an opportunity. Mrs. Gereth was all unwitting; she didn\'t in the\r\nleast know what she had done, and as Fleda could tell her Fleda suddenly\r\nbecame the one who knew most. That counted for the moment as a\r\nmagnificent position; it almost made all the difference. Yet what\r\ncontradicted it was the vivid presence of the artist\'s idea. "Where on\r\nearth did you put your hand on such beautiful things?"\r\n\r\n"Beautiful things?" Mrs. Gereth turned again to the little worn,\r\nbleached stuffs and the sweet spindle-legs. "They\'re the wretched things\r\nthat were here--that stupid, starved old woman\'s."\r\n\r\n"The maiden aunt\'s, the nicest, the dearest old woman that ever lived? I\r\nthought you had got rid of the maiden aunt."\r\n\r\n"She was stored in an empty barn--stuck away for a sale; a matter that,\r\nfortunately, I\'ve had neither time nor freedom of mind to arrange. I\'ve\r\nsimply, in my extremity, fished her out again."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve simply, in your extremity, made a delight of her." Fleda took\r\nthe highest line and the upper hand, and as Mrs. Gereth, challenging her\r\ncheerfulness, turned again a lustreless eye over the contents of the\r\nplace, she broke into a rapture that was unforced, but that she was\r\nconscious of an advantage in being able to feel. She moved, as she had\r\ndone on the previous occasion, from one piece to another, with looks of\r\nrecognition and hands that lightly lingered, but she was as feverishly\r\njubilant now as she had formerly been anxious and mute. "Ah, the little\r\nmelancholy, tender, tell-tale things: how can they _not_ speak to you\r\nand find a way to your heart? It\'s not the great chorus of Poynton; but\r\nyou\'re not, I\'m sure, either so proud or so broken as to be reached by\r\nnothing but that. This is a voice so gentle, so human, so feminine--a\r\nfaint, far-away voice with the little quaver of a heart-break. You\'ve\r\nlistened to it unawares; for the arrangement and effect of\r\neverything--when I compare them with what we found the first day we came\r\ndown--shows, even if mechanically and disdainfully exercised, your\r\nadmirable, infallible hand. It\'s your extraordinary genius; you make\r\nthings \'compose\' in spite of yourself. You\'ve only to be a day or two in\r\na place with four sticks for something to come of it!"\r\n\r\n"Then if anything has come of it here, it has come precisely of just\r\nfour. That\'s literally, by the inventory, all there are!" said Mrs.\r\nGereth.\r\n\r\n"If there were more there would be too many to convey the impression in\r\nwhich half the beauty resides--the impression, somehow, of something\r\ndreamed and missed, something reduced, relinquished, resigned: the\r\npoetry, as it were, of something sensibly _gone_." Fleda ingeniously and\r\ntriumphantly worked it out. "Ah, there\'s something here that will never\r\nbe in the inventory!"\r\n\r\n"Does it happen to be in your power to give it a name?" Mrs. Gereth\'s\r\nface showed the dim dawn of an amusement at finding herself seated at\r\nthe feet of her pupil.\r\n\r\n"I can give it a dozen. It\'s a kind of fourth dimension. It\'s a\r\npresence, a perfume, a touch. It\'s a soul, a story, a life. There\'s ever\r\nso much more here than you and I. We\'re in fact just three!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you count the ghosts!"\r\n\r\n"Of course I count the ghosts. It seems to me ghosts count double--for\r\nwhat they were and for what they are. Somehow there were no ghosts at\r\nPoynton," Fleda went on. "That was the only fault."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth, considering, appeared to fall in with the girl\'s fine\r\nhumor. "Poynton was too splendidly happy."\r\n\r\n"Poynton was too splendidly happy," Fleda promptly echoed.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s cured of that now," her companion added.\r\n\r\n"Yes, henceforth there\'ll be a ghost or two."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth thought again: she found her young friend suggestive. "Only\r\n_she_ won\'t see them."\r\n\r\n"No, \'she\' won\'t see them." Then Fleda said, "What I mean is, for this\r\ndear one of ours, that if she had (as I _know_ she did; it\'s in the very\r\ntaste of the air!) a great accepted pain--"\r\n\r\nShe had paused an instant, and Mrs. Gereth took her up. "Well, if she\r\nhad?"\r\n\r\nFleda still hesitated. "Why, it was worse than yours."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth reflected. "Very likely." Then she too hesitated. "The\r\nquestion is if it was worse than yours."\r\n\r\n"Mine?" Fleda looked vague.\r\n\r\n"Precisely. Yours."\r\n\r\nAt this our young lady smiled. "Yes, because it was a disappointment.\r\nShe had been so sure."\r\n\r\n"I see. And you were never sure."\r\n\r\n"Never. Besides, I\'m happy," said Fleda.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth met her eyes awhile. "Goose!" she quietly remarked as she\r\nturned away. There was a curtness in it; nevertheless it represented a\r\nconsiderable part of the basis of their new life.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th The Morning Post had at last its clear message, a brief\r\naccount of the marriage, from the residence of the bride\'s mother, of\r\nMr. Owen Gereth of Poynton Park to Miss Mona Brigstock of Waterbath.\r\nThere were two ecclesiastics and six bridesmaids and, as Mrs. Gereth\r\nsubsequently said, a hundred frumps, as well as a special train from\r\ntown: the scale of the affair sufficiently showed that the preparations\r\nhad been complete for weeks. The happy pair were described as having\r\ntaken their departure for Mr. Gereth\'s own seat, famous for its unique\r\ncollection of artistic curiosities. The newspapers and letters, the\r\nfruits of the first London post, had been brought to the mistress of\r\nRicks in the garden; and she lingered there alone a long time after\r\nreceiving them. Fleda kept at a distance; she knew what must have\r\nhappened, for from one of the windows she saw her rigid in a chair, her\r\neyes strange and fixed, the newspaper open on the ground and the letters\r\nuntouched in her lap. Before the morning\'s end she had disappeared, and\r\nthe rest of that day she remained in her room: it recalled to Fleda, who\r\nhad picked up the newspaper, the day, months before, on which Owen had\r\ncome down to Poynton to make his engagement known. The hush of the house\r\nwas at least the same, and the girl\'s own waiting, her soft wandering,\r\nthrough the hours: there was a difference indeed sufficiently great, of\r\nwhich her companion\'s absence might in some degree have represented a\r\nconsiderate recognition. That was at any rate the meaning Fleda,\r\ndevoutly glad to be alone, attached to her opportunity. Mrs. Gereth\'s\r\nsole allusion, the next day, to the subject of their thoughts, has\r\nalready been mentioned: it was a dazzled glance at the fact that Mona\'s\r\nquiet pace had really never slackened.\r\n\r\nFleda fully assented. "I said of our disembodied friend here that she\r\nhad suffered in proportion as she had been sure. But that\'s not always a\r\nsource of suffering. It\'s Mona who must have been sure!"\r\n\r\n"She was sure of _you_!" Mrs. Gereth returned. But this didn\'t diminish\r\nthe satisfaction taken by Fleda in showing how serenely and lucidly she\r\ncould talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHer relation with her wonderful friend had, however, in becoming a new\r\none, begun to shape itself almost wholly on breaches and omissions.\r\nSomething had dropped out altogether, and the question between them,\r\nwhich time would answer, was whether the change had made them strangers\r\nor yokefellows. It was as if at last, for better or worse, they were, in\r\na clearer, cruder air, really to know each other. Fleda wondered how\r\nMrs. Gereth had escaped hating her: there were hours when it seemed that\r\nsuch a feat might leave after all a scant margin for future accidents.\r\nThe thing indeed that now came out in its simplicity was that even in\r\nher shrunken state the lady of Ricks was larger than her wrongs. As for\r\nthe girl herself, she had made up her mind that her feelings had no\r\nconnection with the case. It was her pretension that they had never yet\r\nemerged from the seclusion into which, after her friend\'s visit to her\r\nat her sister\'s, we saw them precipitately retire: if she should\r\nsuddenly meet them in straggling procession on the road it would be time\r\nenough to deal with them. They were all bundled there together, likes\r\nwith dislikes and memories with fears; and she had for not thinking of\r\nthem the excellent reason that she was too occupied with the actual. The\r\nactual was not that Owen Gereth had seen his necessity where she had\r\npointed it out; it was that his mother\'s bare spaces demanded all the\r\ntapestry that the recipient of her bounty could furnish. There were\r\nmoments during the month that followed when Mrs. Gereth struck her as\r\nstill older and feebler, and as likely to become quite easily amused.\r\n\r\nAt the end of it, one day, the London paper had another piece of news:\r\n"Mr. and Mrs. Owen Gereth, who arrived in town last week, proceed this\r\nmorning to Paris." They exchanged no word about it till the evening, and\r\nnone indeed would then have been uttered had not Mrs. Gereth\r\nirrelevantly broken out: "I dare say you wonder why I declared the other\r\nday with such assurance that he wouldn\'t live with her. He apparently\r\n_is_ living with her."\r\n\r\n"Surely it\'s the only proper thing for him to do."\r\n\r\n"They\'re beyond me--I give it up," said Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t give it up--I never did," Fleda returned.\r\n\r\n"Then what do you make of his aversion to her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she has dispelled it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth said nothing for a minute. "You\'re prodigious in your choice\r\nof terms!" she then simply ejaculated.\r\n\r\nBut Fleda went luminously on; she once more enjoyed her great command of\r\nher subject: "I think that when you came to see me at Maggie\'s you saw\r\ntoo many things, you had too many ideas."\r\n\r\n"You had none," said Mrs. Gereth: "you were completely bewildered."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I didn\'t quite understand--but I think I understand now. The case\r\nis simple and logical enough. She\'s a person who\'s upset by failure and\r\nwho blooms and expands with success. There was something she had set her\r\nheart upon, set her teeth about--the house exactly as she had seen it."\r\n\r\n"She never saw it at all, she never looked at it!" cried Mrs. Gereth.\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t look with her eyes; she looks with her ears. In her own way\r\nshe had taken it in; she knew, she felt when it had been touched. That\r\nprobably made her take an attitude that was extremely disagreeable. But\r\nthe attitude lasted only while the reason for it lasted."\r\n\r\n"Go on--I can bear it now," said Mrs. Gereth. Her companion had just\r\nperceptibly paused.\r\n\r\n"I know you can, or I shouldn\'t dream of speaking. When the pressure was\r\nremoved she came up again. From the moment the house was once more what\r\nit had to be, her natural charm reasserted itself."\r\n\r\n"Her natural charm!" Mrs. Gereth could barely articulate.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very great; everybody thinks so; there must be something in it. It\r\noperated as it had operated before. There\'s no need of imagining\r\nanything very monstrous. Her restored good humor, her splendid beauty,\r\nand Mr. Owen\'s impressibility and generosity sufficiently cover the\r\nground. His great bright sun came out!"\r\n\r\n"And his great bright passion for another person went in. Your\r\nexplanation would doubtless be perfection if he didn\'t love you."\r\n\r\nFleda was silent a little. "What do you know about his \'loving\' me?"\r\n\r\n"I know what Mrs. Brigstock herself told me."\r\n\r\n"You never in your life took her word for any other matter."\r\n\r\n"Then won\'t yours do?" Mrs. Gereth demanded. "Haven\'t I had it from your\r\nown mouth that he cares for you?"\r\n\r\nFleda turned pale, but she faced her companion and smiled. "You\r\nconfound, Mrs. Gereth, you mix things up. You\'ve only had it from my own\r\nmouth that I care for _him_!"\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless in contradictious allusion to this (which at the time\r\nhad made her simply drop her head as in a strange, vain reverie) that\r\nMrs. Gereth, a day or two later, said to Fleda: "Don\'t think I shall be\r\na bit affected if I\'m here to see it when he comes again to make up to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t do that," the girl replied. Then she added, smiling: "But if\r\nhe should be guilty of such bad taste, it wouldn\'t be nice of you not to\r\nbe disgusted."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not talking of disgust; I\'m talking of its opposite," said Mrs.\r\nGereth.\r\n\r\n"Of its opposite?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of any reviving pleasure that one might feel in such an\r\nexhibition. I shall feel none at all. You may personally take it as you\r\nlike; but what conceivable good will it do?"\r\n\r\nFleda wondered. "To me, do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Deuce take you, no! To what we don\'t, you know, by your wish, ever talk\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"The old things?" Fleda considered again. "It will do no good of any\r\nsort to anything or any one. That\'s another question I would rather we\r\nshouldn\'t discuss, please," she gently added.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"It certainly isn\'t worth it!"\r\n\r\nSomething in her manner prompted her companion, with a certain\r\ninconsequence, to speak again. "That was partly why I came back to you,\r\nyou know--that there should be the less possibility of anything\r\npainful."\r\n\r\n"Painful?" Mrs. Gereth stared. "What pain can I ever feel again?"\r\n\r\n"I meant painful to myself," Fleda, with a slight impatience, explained.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see." Her friend was silent a minute. "You use sometimes such odd\r\nexpressions. Well, I shall last a little, but I sha\'n\'t last forever."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll last quite as long--" Here Fleda suddenly hesitated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gereth took her up with a cold smile that seemed the warning of\r\nexperience against hyperbole. "As long as what, please?"\r\n\r\nThe girl thought an instant; then met the difficulty by adopting, as an\r\namendment, the same tone. "As any danger of the ridiculous."\r\n\r\nThat did for the time, and she had moreover, as the months went on, the\r\nprotection of suspended allusions. This protection was marked when, in\r\nthe following November, she received a letter directed in a hand at\r\nwhich a quick glance sufficed to make her hesitate to open it. She said\r\nnothing, then or afterwards; but she opened it, for reasons that had\r\ncome to her, on the morrow. It consisted of a page and a half from Owen\r\nGereth, dated from Florence, but with no other preliminary. She knew\r\nthat during the summer he had returned to England with his wife, and\r\nthat after a couple of months they had again gone abroad. She also knew,\r\nwithout communication, that Mrs. Gereth, round whom Ricks had grown\r\nsubmissively and indescribably sweet, had her own interpretation of her\r\ndaughter-in-law\'s share in this second migration. It was a piece of\r\ncalculated insolence--a stroke odiously directed at showing whom it\r\nmight concern that now she had Poynton fast she was perfectly\r\nindifferent to living there. The Morning Post, at Ricks, had again been\r\na resource: it was stated in that journal that Mr. and Mrs. Owen Gereth\r\nproposed to spend the winter in India. There was a person to whom it was\r\nclear that she led her wretched husband by the nose. Such was the light\r\nin which contemporary history was offered to Fleda until, in her own\r\nroom, late at night, she broke the seal of her letter.\r\n\r\n"I want you, inexpressibly, to have, as a remembrance, something of\r\nmine--something of real value. Something from Poynton is what I mean and\r\nwhat I should prefer. You know everything there, and far better than I\r\nwhat\'s best and what isn\'t. There are a lot of differences, but aren\'t\r\nsome of the smaller things the most remarkable? I mean for judges, and\r\nfor what they\'d bring. What I want you to take from me, and to choose\r\nfor yourself, is the thing in the whole house that\'s most beautiful and\r\nprecious. I mean the \'gem of the collection,\' don\'t you know? If it\r\nhappens to be of such a sort that you can take immediate possession of\r\nit--carry it right away with you--so much the better. You\'re to have it\r\non the spot, whatever it is. I humbly beg of you to go down there and\r\nsee. The people have complete instructions: they\'ll act for you in every\r\npossible way and put the whole place at your service. There\'s a thing\r\nmamma used to call the Maltese cross and that I think I\'ve heard her say\r\nis very wonderful. Is _that_ the gem of the collection? Perhaps you\r\nwould take it, or anything equally convenient. Only I do want you\r\nawfully to let it be the very pick of the place. Let me feel that I can\r\ntrust you for this. You won\'t refuse if you will think a little what it\r\nmust be that makes me ask."\r\n\r\nFleda read that last sentence over more times even than the rest; she\r\nwas baffled--she couldn\'t think at all of what it might be. This was\r\nindeed because it might be one of so many things. She made for the\r\npresent no answer; she merely, little by little, fashioned for herself\r\nthe form that her answer should eventually wear. There was only one form\r\nthat was possible--the form of doing, at her time, what he wished. She\r\nwould go down to Poynton as a pilgrim might go to a shrine, and as to\r\nthis she must look out for her chance. She lived with her letter, before\r\nany chance came, a month, and even after a month it had mysteries for\r\nher that she couldn\'t meet. What did it mean, what did it represent, to\r\nwhat did it correspond in his imagination or his soul? What was behind\r\nit, what was beyond it, what was, in the deepest depth, within it? She\r\nsaid to herself that with these questions she was under no obligation to\r\ndeal. There was an explanation of them that, for practical purposes,\r\nwould do as well as another: he had found in his marriage a happiness so\r\nmuch greater than, in the distress of his dilemma, he had been able to\r\ntake heart to believe, that he now felt he owed her a token of gratitude\r\nfor having kept him in the straight path. That explanation, I say, she\r\ncould throw off; but no explanation in the least mattered: what\r\ndetermined her was the simple strength of her impulse to respond. The\r\npassion for which what had happened had made no difference, the passion\r\nthat had taken this into account before as well as after, found here an\r\nissue that there was nothing whatever to choke. It found even a relief\r\nto which her imagination immensely contributed. Would she act upon his\r\noffer? She would act with secret rapture. To have as her own something\r\nsplendid that he had given her, of which the gift had been his signed\r\ndesire, would be a greater joy than the greatest she had supposed to be\r\nleft to her, and she felt that till the sense of this came home she had\r\neven herself not known what burned in her successful stillness. It was\r\nan hour to dream of and watch for; to be patient was to draw out the\r\nsweetness. She was capable of feeling it as an hour of triumph, the\r\ntriumph of everything in her recent life that had not held up its head.\r\nShe moved there in thought--in the great rooms she knew; she should be\r\nable to say to herself that, for once at least, her possession was as\r\ncomplete as that of either of the others whom it had filled only with\r\nbitterness. And a thousand times yes--her choice should know no scruple:\r\nthe thing she should go down to take would be up to the height of her\r\nprivilege. The whole place was in her eyes, and she spent for weeks her\r\nprivate hours in a luxury of comparison and debate. It should be one of\r\nthe smallest things because it should be one she could have close to\r\nher; and it should be one of the finest because it was in the finest he\r\nsaw his symbol. She said to herself that of what it would symbolize she\r\nwas content to know nothing more than just what her having it would tell\r\nher. At bottom she inclined to the Maltese cross--with the added reason\r\nthat he had named it. But she would look again and judge afresh; she\r\nwould on the spot so handle and ponder that there shouldn\'t be the shade\r\nof a mistake.\r\n\r\nBefore Christmas she had a natural opportunity to go to London; there\r\nwas her periodical call upon her father to pay as well as a promise to\r\nMaggie to redeem. She spent her first night in West Kensington, with the\r\nidea of carrying out on the morrow the purpose that had most of a\r\nmotive. Her father\'s affection was not inquisitive, but when she\r\nmentioned to him that she had business in the country that would oblige\r\nher to catch an early train, he deprecated her excursion in view of the\r\nmenace of the weather. It was spoiling for a storm; all the signs of a\r\nwinter gale were in the air. She replied that she would see what the\r\nmorning might bring; and it brought, in fact, what seemed in London an\r\namendment. She was to go to Maggie the next day, and now that she had\r\nstarted her eagerness had become suddenly a pain. She pictured her\r\nreturn that evening with her trophy under her cloak; so that after\r\nlooking, from the doorstep, up and down the dark street, she decided,\r\nwith a new nervousness, and sallied forth to the nearest place of access\r\nto the "Underground." The December dawn was dolorous, but there was\r\nneither rain nor snow; it was not even cold, and the atmosphere of West\r\nKensington, purified by the wind, was like a dirty old coat that had\r\nbeen bettered by a dirty brush. At the end of almost an hour, in the\r\nlarger station, she had taken her place in a third-class compartment;\r\nthe prospect before her was the run of eighty minutes to Poynton. The\r\ntrain was a fast one, and she was familiar with the moderate measure of\r\nthe walk to the park from the spot at which it would drop her.\r\n\r\nOnce in the country, indeed, she saw that her father was right: the\r\nbreath of December was abroad with a force from which the London\r\nlabyrinth had protected her. The green fields were black, the sky was\r\nall alive with the wind; she had, in her anxious sense of the elements,\r\nher wonder at what might happen, a reminder of the surmises, in the old\r\ndays of going to the Continent, that used to worry her on the way, at\r\nnight, to the horrid cheap crossings by long sea. Something, in a dire\r\ndegree, at this last hour, had begun to press on her heart: it was the\r\nsudden imagination of a disaster, or at least of a check, before her\r\nerrand was achieved. When she said to herself that something might\r\nhappen she wanted to go faster than the train. But nothing could happen\r\nsave a dismayed discovery that, by some altogether unlikely chance, the\r\nmaster and mistress of the house had already come back. In that case she\r\nmust have had a warning, and the fear was but the excess of her hope. It\r\nwas every one\'s being exactly where every one was that lent the quality\r\nto her visit. Beyond lands and seas and alienated forever, they in their\r\ndifferent ways gave her the impression to take as she had never taken\r\nit. At last it was already there, though the darkness of the day had\r\ndeepened; they had whizzed past Chater--Chater, which was the station\r\nbefore the right one. Off in that quarter was an air of wild rain, but\r\nthere shimmered straight across it a brightness that was the color of\r\nthe great interior she had been haunting. That vision settled before\r\nher--in the house the house was all; and as the train drew up she rose,\r\nin her mean compartment, quite proudly erect with the thought that all\r\nfor Fleda Vetch then the house was standing there.\r\n\r\nBut with the opening of the door she encountered a shock, though for an\r\ninstant she couldn\'t have named it; the next moment she saw it was given\r\nher by the face of the man advancing to let her out, an old lame porter\r\nof the station, who had been there in Mrs. Gereth\'s time and who now\r\nrecognized her. He looked up at her so hard that she took an alarm and\r\nbefore alighting broke out to him: "They\'ve come back?" She had a\r\nconfused, absurd sense that even he would know that in this case she\r\nmustn\'t be there. He hesitated, and in the few seconds her alarm had\r\ncompletely changed its ground: it seemed to leap, with her quick jump\r\nfrom the carriage, to the ground that was that of his stare at her.\r\n"Smoke?" She was on the platform with her frightened sniff: it had taken\r\nher a minute to become aware of an extraordinary smell. The air was full\r\nof it, and there were already heads at the window of the train, looking\r\nout at something she couldn\'t see. Some one, the only other passenger,\r\nhad got out of another carriage, and the old porter hobbled off to close\r\nhis door. The smoke was in her eyes, but she saw the station-master,\r\nfrom the end of the platform, recognize her too and come straight to\r\nher. He brought her a finer shade of surprise than the porter, and while\r\nhe was coming she heard a voice at a window of the train say that\r\nsomething was "a good bit off--a mile from the town." That was just what\r\nPoynton was. Then her heart stood still at the white wonder in the\r\nstation-master\'s face.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come down to it, miss, already?"\r\n\r\nAt this she knew. "Poynton\'s on fire?"\r\n\r\n"Gone, miss--with this awful gale. You weren\'t wired? Look out!" he\r\ncried in the next breath, seizing her; the train was going on, and she\r\nhad given a lurch that almost made it catch her as it passed. When it\r\nhad drawn away she became more conscious of the pervading smoke, which\r\nthe wind seemed to hurl in her face.\r\n\r\n"_Gone?_" She was in the man\'s hands; she clung to him.\r\n\r\n"Burning still, miss. Ain\'t it quite too dreadful? Took early this\r\nmorning--the whole place is up there."\r\n\r\nIn her bewildered horror she tried to think. "Have they come back?"\r\n\r\n"Back? They\'ll be there all day!"\r\n\r\n"Not Mr. Gereth, I mean--nor his wife?"\r\n\r\n"Nor his mother, miss--not a soul of _them_ back. A pack o\' servants in\r\ncharge--not the old lady\'s lot, eh? A nice job for care-takers! Some\r\nrotten chimley or one of them portable lamps set down in the wrong\r\nplace. What has done it is this cruel, cruel night." Then as a great\r\nwave of smoke half choked them, he drew her with force to the little\r\nwaiting room. "Awkward for you, miss--I see!"\r\n\r\nShe felt sick; she sank upon a seat, staring up at him. "Do you mean\r\nthat great house is _lost_?"\r\n\r\n"It was near it, I was told, an hour ago--the fury of the flames had got\r\nsuch a start. I was there myself at six, the very first I heard of it.\r\nThey were fighting it then, but you couldn\'t quite say they had got it\r\ndown."\r\n\r\nFleda jerked herself up. "Were they saving the things?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just where it was, miss--to get _at_ the blessed things. And the\r\nwant of right help--it maddened me to stand and see \'em muff it. This\r\nain\'t a place, like, for anything organized. They don\'t come up to a\r\n_reel_ emergency."\r\n\r\nShe passed out of the door that opened toward the village and met a\r\ngreat acrid gust. She heard a far-off windy roar which, in her dismay,\r\nshe took for that of flames a mile away, and which, the first instant,\r\nacted upon her as a wild solicitation. "I must go there." She had\r\nscarcely spoken before the same omen had changed into an appalling\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nHer vivid friend, moreover, had got before her; he clearly suffered from\r\nthe nature of the control he had to exercise. "Don\'t do that, miss--you\r\nwon\'t care for it at all." Then as she waveringly stood her ground,\r\n"It\'s not a place for a young lady, nor, if you\'ll believe me, a sight\r\nfor them as are in any way affected."\r\n\r\nFleda by this time knew in what way she was affected: she became limp\r\nand weak again; she felt herself give everything up. Mixed with the\r\nhorror, with the kindness of the station-master, with the smell of\r\ncinders and the riot of sound, was the raw bitterness of a hope that she\r\nmight never again in life have to give up so much at such short notice.\r\nShe heard herself repeat mechanically, yet as if asking it for the first\r\ntime: "Poynton\'s _gone_?"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated. "What can you call it, miss, if it ain\'t really\r\nsaved?"\r\n\r\nA minute later she had returned with him to the waiting-room, where, in\r\nthe thick swim of things, she saw something like the disk of a clock.\r\n"Is there an up-train?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"In seven minutes."\r\n\r\nShe came out on the platform: everywhere she met the smoke.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
