Amory, Son of Beatrice\r\n\r\n\r\n      Amory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the\r\n      stray inexpressible few, that made him worth while. His father,\r\n      an ineffectual, inarticulate man with a taste for Byron and a\r\n      habit of drowsing over the Encyclopedia Britannica, grew wealthy\r\n      at thirty through the death of two elder brothers, successful\r\n      Chicago brokers, and in the first flush of feeling that the world\r\n      was his, went to Bar Harbor and met Beatrice O\xe2\x80\x99Hara. In\r\n      consequence, Stephen Blaine handed down to posterity his height\r\n      of just under six feet and his tendency to waver at crucial\r\n      moments, these two abstractions appearing in his son Amory. For\r\n      many years he hovered in the background of his family\xe2\x80\x99s life, an\r\n      unassertive figure with a face half-obliterated by lifeless,\r\n      silky hair, continually occupied in \xe2\x80\x9ctaking care\xe2\x80\x9d of his wife,\r\n      continually harassed by the idea that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      understand her.\r\n\r\n      But Beatrice Blaine! There was a woman! Early pictures taken on\r\n      her father\xe2\x80\x99s estate at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, or in Rome at the\r\n      Sacred Heart Convent\xe2\x80\x94an educational extravagance that in her\r\n      youth was only for the daughters of the exceptionally\r\n      wealthy\xe2\x80\x94showed the exquisite delicacy of her features, the\r\n      consummate art and simplicity of her clothes. A brilliant\r\n      education she had\xe2\x80\x94her youth passed in renaissance glory, she was\r\n      versed in the latest gossip of the Older Roman Families; known by\r\n      name as a fabulously wealthy American girl to Cardinal Vitori and\r\n      Queen Margherita and more subtle celebrities that one must have\r\n      had some culture even to have heard of. She learned in England to\r\n      prefer whiskey and soda to wine, and her small talk was broadened\r\n      in two senses during a winter in Vienna. All in all Beatrice\r\n      O\xe2\x80\x99Hara absorbed the sort of education that will be quite\r\n      impossible ever again; a tutelage measured by the number of\r\n      things and people one could be contemptuous of and charming\r\n      about; a culture rich in all arts and traditions, barren of all\r\n      ideas, in the last of those days when the great gardener clipped\r\n      the inferior roses to produce one perfect bud.\r\n\r\n      In her less important moments she returned to America, met\r\n      Stephen Blaine and married him\xe2\x80\x94this almost entirely because she\r\n      was a little bit weary, a little bit sad. Her only child was\r\n      carried through a tiresome season and brought into the world on a\r\n      spring day in ninety-six.\r\n\r\n      When Amory was five he was already a delightful companion for\r\n      her. He was an auburn-haired boy, with great, handsome eyes which\r\n      he would grow up to in time, a facile imaginative mind and a\r\n      taste for fancy dress. From his fourth to his tenth year he did\r\n      the country with his mother in her father\xe2\x80\x99s private car, from\r\n      Coronado, where his mother became so bored that she had a nervous\r\n      breakdown in a fashionable hotel, down to Mexico City, where she\r\n      took a mild, almost epidemic consumption. This trouble pleased\r\n      her, and later she made use of it as an intrinsic part of her\r\n      atmosphere\xe2\x80\x94especially after several astounding bracers.\r\n\r\n      So, while more or less fortunate little rich boys were defying\r\n      governesses on the beach at Newport, or being spanked or tutored\r\n      or read to from \xe2\x80\x9cDo and Dare,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cFrank on the Mississippi,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      Amory was biting acquiescent bell-boys in the Waldorf, outgrowing\r\n      a natural repugnance to chamber music and symphonies, and\r\n      deriving a highly specialized education from his mother.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Beatrice.\xe2\x80\x9d (Such a quaint name for his mother; she\r\n      encouraged it.)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDear, don\xe2\x80\x99t _think_ of getting out of bed yet. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always\r\n      suspected that early rising in early life makes one nervous.\r\n      Clothilde is having your breakfast brought up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI am feeling very old to-day, Amory,\xe2\x80\x9d she would sigh, her face a\r\n      rare cameo of pathos, her voice exquisitely modulated, her hands\r\n      as facile as Bernhardt\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cMy nerves are on edge\xe2\x80\x94on edge. We must\r\n      leave this terrifying place to-morrow and go searching for\r\n      sunshine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s penetrating green eyes would look out through tangled\r\n      hair at his mother. Even at this age he had no illusions about\r\n      her.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _yes_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to take a red-hot bath as hot as you can bear it, and\r\n      just relax your nerves. You can read in the tub if you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She fed him sections of the \xe2\x80\x9cFetes Galantes\xe2\x80\x9d before he was ten;\r\n      at eleven he could talk glibly, if rather reminiscently, of\r\n      Brahms and Mozart and Beethoven. One afternoon, when left alone\r\n      in the hotel at Hot Springs, he sampled his mother\xe2\x80\x99s apricot\r\n      cordial, and as the taste pleased him, he became quite tipsy.\r\n      This was fun for a while, but he essayed a cigarette in his\r\n      exaltation, and succumbed to a vulgar, plebeian reaction. Though\r\n      this incident horrified Beatrice, it also secretly amused her and\r\n      became part of what in a later generation would have been termed\r\n      her \xe2\x80\x9cline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThis son of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard her tell a room full of awestruck,\r\n      admiring women one day, \xe2\x80\x9cis entirely sophisticated and quite\r\n      charming\xe2\x80\x94but delicate\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re all delicate; _here_, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d Her\r\n      hand was radiantly outlined against her beautiful bosom; then\r\n      sinking her voice to a whisper, she told them of the apricot\r\n      cordial. They rejoiced, for she was a brave raconteuse, but many\r\n      were the keys turned in sideboard locks that night against the\r\n      possible defection of little Bobby or Barbara....\r\n\r\n      These domestic pilgrimages were invariably in state; two maids,\r\n      the private car, or Mr. Blaine when available, and very often a\r\n      physician. When Amory had the whooping-cough four disgusted\r\n      specialists glared at each other hunched around his bed; when he\r\n      took scarlet fever the number of attendants, including physicians\r\n      and nurses, totalled fourteen. However, blood being thicker than\r\n      broth, he was pulled through.\r\n\r\n      The Blaines were attached to no city. They were the Blaines of\r\n      Lake Geneva; they had quite enough relatives to serve in place of\r\n      friends, and an enviable standing from Pasadena to Cape Cod. But\r\n      Beatrice grew more and more prone to like only new acquaintances,\r\n      as there were certain stories, such as the history of her\r\n      constitution and its many amendments, memories of her years\r\n      abroad, that it was necessary for her to repeat at regular\r\n      intervals. Like Freudian dreams, they must be thrown off, else\r\n      they would sweep in and lay siege to her nerves. But Beatrice was\r\n      critical about American women, especially the floating population\r\n      of ex-Westerners.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThey have accents, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Amory, \xe2\x80\x9cnot Southern\r\n      accents or Boston accents, not an accent attached to any\r\n      locality, just an accent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she became dreamy. \xe2\x80\x9cThey pick up old,\r\n      moth-eaten London accents that are down on their luck and have to\r\n      be used by some one. They talk as an English butler might after\r\n      several years in a Chicago grand-opera company.\xe2\x80\x9d She became\r\n      almost incoherent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose\xe2\x80\x94time in every Western woman\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x94she\r\n      feels her husband is prosperous enough for her to\r\n      have\xe2\x80\x94accent\xe2\x80\x94they try to impress _me_, my dear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Though she thought of her body as a mass of frailties, she\r\n      considered her soul quite as ill, and therefore important in her\r\n      life. She had once been a Catholic, but discovering that priests\r\n      were infinitely more attentive when she was in process of losing\r\n      or regaining faith in Mother Church, she maintained an\r\n      enchantingly wavering attitude. Often she deplored the bourgeois\r\n      quality of the American Catholic clergy, and was quite sure that\r\n      had she lived in the shadow of the great Continental cathedrals\r\n      her soul would still be a thin flame on the mighty altar of Rome.\r\n      Still, next to doctors, priests were her favorite sport.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Bishop Wiston,\xe2\x80\x9d she would declare, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not want to talk of\r\n      myself. I can imagine the stream of hysterical women fluttering\r\n      at your doors, beseeching you to be simpatico\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then after an\r\n      interlude filled by the clergyman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut my mood\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94oddly\r\n      dissimilar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Only to bishops and above did she divulge her clerical romance.\r\n      When she had first returned to her country there had been a\r\n      pagan, Swinburnian young man in Asheville, for whose passionate\r\n      kisses and unsentimental conversations she had taken a decided\r\n      penchant\xe2\x80\x94they had discussed the matter pro and con with an\r\n      intellectual romancing quite devoid of sappiness. Eventually she\r\n      had decided to marry for background, and the young pagan from\r\n      Asheville had gone through a spiritual crisis, joined the\r\n      Catholic Church, and was now\xe2\x80\x94Monsignor Darcy.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Mrs. Blaine, he is still delightful company\xe2\x80\x94quite the\r\n      cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s right-hand man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory will go to him one day, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d breathed the beautiful\r\n      lady, \xe2\x80\x9cand Monsignor Darcy will understand him as he understood\r\n      me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory became thirteen, rather tall and slender, and more than\r\n      ever on to his Celtic mother. He had tutored occasionally\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      idea being that he was to \xe2\x80\x9ckeep up,\xe2\x80\x9d at each place \xe2\x80\x9ctaking up the\r\n      work where he left off,\xe2\x80\x9d yet as no tutor ever found the place he\r\n      left off, his mind was still in very good shape. What a few more\r\n      years of this life would have made of him is problematical.\r\n      However, four hours out from land, Italy bound, with Beatrice,\r\n      his appendix burst, probably from too many meals in bed, and\r\n      after a series of frantic telegrams to Europe and America, to the\r\n      amazement of the passengers the great ship slowly wheeled around\r\n      and returned to New York to deposit Amory at the pier. You will\r\n      admit that if it was not life it was magnificent.\r\n\r\n      After the operation Beatrice had a nervous breakdown that bore a\r\n      suspicious resemblance to delirium tremens, and Amory was left in\r\n      Minneapolis, destined to spend the ensuing two years with his\r\n      aunt and uncle. There the crude, vulgar air of Western\r\n      civilization first catches him\xe2\x80\x94in his underwear, so to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n      A KISS FOR AMORY\r\n\r\n      His lip curled when he read it.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to have a bobbing party,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9con Thursday, December\r\n  the seventeenth, at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and I would like it very much if\r\n  you could come.\r\n                        Yours truly,\r\n  R.S.V.P.                                     Myra St. Claire.\r\n\r\n      He had been two months in Minneapolis, and his chief struggle had\r\n      been the concealing from \xe2\x80\x9cthe other guys at school\xe2\x80\x9d how\r\n      particularly superior he felt himself to be, yet this conviction\r\n      was built upon shifting sands. He had shown off one day in French\r\n      class (he was in senior French class) to the utter confusion of\r\n      Mr. Reardon, whose accent Amory damned contemptuously, and to the\r\n      delight of the class. Mr. Reardon, who had spent several weeks in\r\n      Paris ten years before, took his revenge on the verbs, whenever\r\n      he had his book open. But another time Amory showed off in\r\n      history class, with quite disastrous results, for the boys there\r\n      were his own age, and they shrilled innuendoes at each other all\r\n      the following week:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAw\xe2\x80\x94I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve, doncherknow, the Umuricun revolution was _lawgely_\r\n      an affair of the middul _clawses_,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWashington came of very good blood\xe2\x80\x94aw, quite good\xe2\x80\x94I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory ingeniously tried to retrieve himself by blundering on\r\n      purpose. Two years before he had commenced a history of the\r\n      United States which, though it only got as far as the Colonial\r\n      Wars, had been pronounced by his mother completely enchanting.\r\n\r\n      His chief disadvantage lay in athletics, but as soon as he\r\n      discovered that it was the touchstone of power and popularity at\r\n      school, he began to make furious, persistent efforts to excel in\r\n      the winter sports, and with his ankles aching and bending in\r\n      spite of his efforts, he skated valiantly around the Lorelie rink\r\n      every afternoon, wondering how soon he would be able to carry a\r\n      hockey-stick without getting it inexplicably tangled in his\r\n      skates.\r\n\r\n      The invitation to Miss Myra St. Claire\xe2\x80\x99s bobbing party spent the\r\n      morning in his coat pocket, where it had an intense physical\r\n      affair with a dusty piece of peanut brittle. During the afternoon\r\n      he brought it to light with a sigh, and after some consideration\r\n      and a preliminary draft in the back of Collar and Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFirst-Year Latin,\xe2\x80\x9d composed an answer:\r\n\r\n  My dear Miss St. Claire: Your truly charming envitation for the\r\n  evening of next Thursday evening was truly delightful to receive this\r\n  morning.  I will be charm and inchanted indeed to present my\r\n  compliments on next Thursday evening. Faithfully,\r\n                                          Amory Blaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n      On Thursday, therefore, he walked pensively along the slippery,\r\n      shovel-scraped sidewalks, and came in sight of Myra\xe2\x80\x99s house, on\r\n      the half-hour after five, a lateness which he fancied his mother\r\n      would have favored. He waited on the door-step with his eyes\r\n      nonchalantly half-closed, and planned his entrance with\r\n      precision. He would cross the floor, not too hastily, to Mrs. St.\r\n      Claire, and say with exactly the correct modulation:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy _dear_ Mrs. St. Claire, I\xe2\x80\x99m _frightfully_ sorry to be late,\r\n      but my maid\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he paused there and realized he would be\r\n      quoting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut my uncle and I had to see a fella\xe2\x80\x94Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve met your\r\n      enchanting daughter at dancing-school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Then he would shake hands, using that slight, half-foreign bow,\r\n      with all the starchy little females, and nod to the fellas who\r\n      would be standing \xe2\x80\x99round, paralyzed into rigid groups for mutual\r\n      protection.\r\n\r\n      A butler (one of the three in Minneapolis) swung open the door.\r\n      Amory stepped inside and divested himself of cap and coat. He was\r\n      mildly surprised not to hear the shrill squawk of conversation\r\n      from the next room, and he decided it must be quite formal. He\r\n      approved of that\xe2\x80\x94as he approved of the butler.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Myra,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n      To his surprise the butler grinned horribly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yeah,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x9d He was unaware that his\r\n      failure to be cockney was ruining his standing. Amory considered\r\n      him coldly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the butler, his voice rising unnecessarily,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s the only one what _is_ here. The party\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory gasped in sudden horror.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for Amory Blaine. That\xe2\x80\x99s you, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? Her\r\n      mother says that if you showed up by five-thirty you two was to\r\n      go after \xe2\x80\x99em in the Packard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s despair was crystallized by the appearance of Myra\r\n      herself, bundled to the ears in a polo coat, her face plainly\r\n      sulky, her voice pleasant only with difficulty.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Lo, Amory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Lo, Myra.\xe2\x80\x9d He had described the state of his vitality.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94you _got_ here, _any_ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. I guess you don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the auto\r\n      accident,\xe2\x80\x9d he romanced.\r\n\r\n      Myra\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened wide.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWho was it to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued desperately, \xe2\x80\x9cuncle \xe2\x80\x99n aunt \xe2\x80\x99n I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWas any one _killed?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory paused and then nodded.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYour uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94alarm.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no just a horse\xe2\x80\x94a sorta gray horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      At this point the Erse butler snickered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cProbably killed the engine,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested. Amory would have put\r\n      him on the rack without a scruple.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Myra coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Amory, the bobs were\r\n      ordered for five and everybody was here, so we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, could I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSo mama said for me to wait till ha\xe2\x80\x99past five. We\xe2\x80\x99ll catch the\r\n      bobs before it gets to the Minnehaha Club, Amory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s shredded poise dropped from him. He pictured the happy\r\n      party jingling along snowy streets, the appearance of the\r\n      limousine, the horrible public descent of him and Myra before\r\n      sixty reproachful eyes, his apology\xe2\x80\x94a real one this time. He\r\n      sighed aloud.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Myra.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I was just yawning. Are we going to _surely_ catch up\r\n      with \xe2\x80\x99em before they get there?\xe2\x80\x9d He was encouraging a faint hope\r\n      that they might slip into the Minnehaha Club and meet the others\r\n      there, be found in blas\xc3\xa9 seclusion before the fire and quite\r\n      regain his lost attitude.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, sure Mike, we\xe2\x80\x99ll catch \xe2\x80\x99em all right\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He became conscious of his stomach. As they stepped into the\r\n      machine he hurriedly slapped the paint of diplomacy over a rather\r\n      box-like plan he had conceived. It was based upon some\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9ctrade-lasts\xe2\x80\x9d gleaned at dancing-school, to the effect that he\r\n      was \xe2\x80\x9cawful good-looking and _English_, sort of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMyra,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, lowering his voice and choosing his words\r\n      carefully, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg a thousand pardons. Can you ever forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      She regarded him gravely, his intent green eyes, his mouth, that\r\n      to her thirteen-year-old, arrow-collar taste was the quintessence\r\n      of romance. Yes, Myra could forgive him very easily.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He looked at her again, and then dropped his eyes. He had lashes.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m diff\xe2\x80\x99runt. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I\r\n      make faux pas. \xe2\x80\x99Cause I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, recklessly:\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI been smoking too much. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got t\xe2\x80\x99bacca heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Myra pictured an all-night tobacco debauch, with Amory pale and\r\n      reeling from the effect of nicotined lungs. She gave a little\r\n      gasp.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _Amory_, don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke. You\xe2\x80\x99ll stunt your _growth!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cI gotta. I got the habit.\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of things that if my fambly knew\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he hesitated,\r\n      giving her imagination time to picture dark horrors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI went to\r\n      the burlesque show last week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Myra was quite overcome. He turned the green eyes on her again.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the only girl in town I like much,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in a\r\n      rush of sentiment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re simpatico.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Myra was not sure that she was, but it sounded stylish though\r\n      vaguely improper.\r\n\r\n      Thick dusk had descended outside, and as the limousine made a\r\n      sudden turn she was jolted against him; their hands touched.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t smoke, Amory,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know\r\n      that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He shook his head.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNobody cares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Myra hesitated.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Something stirred within Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, you do! You got a crush on Froggy Parker. I guess\r\n      everybody knows that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d very slowly.\r\n\r\n      A silence, while Amory thrilled. There was something fascinating\r\n      about Myra, shut away here cosily from the dim, chill air. Myra,\r\n      a little bundle of clothes, with strands of yellow hair curling\r\n      out from under her skating cap.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a crush, too\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, for he heard in the\r\n      distance the sound of young laughter, and, peering through the\r\n      frosted glass along the lamp-lit street, he made out the dark\r\n      outline of the bobbing party. He must act quickly. He reached\r\n      over with a violent, jerky effort, and clutched Myra\xe2\x80\x99s hand\xe2\x80\x94her\r\n      thumb, to be exact.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTell him to go to the Minnehaha straight,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n      wanta talk to you\xe2\x80\x94I _got_ to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Myra made out the party ahead, had an instant vision of her\r\n      mother, and then\xe2\x80\x94alas for convention\xe2\x80\x94glanced into the eyes\r\n      beside. \xe2\x80\x9cTurn down this side street, Richard, and drive straight\r\n      to the Minnehaha Club!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried through the speaking tube.\r\n      Amory sank back against the cushions with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI can kiss her,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet I can. I\xe2\x80\x99ll _bet_ I can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Overhead the sky was half crystalline, half misty, and the night\r\n      around was chill and vibrant with rich tension. From the Country\r\n      Club steps the roads stretched away, dark creases on the white\r\n      blanket; huge heaps of snow lining the sides like the tracks of\r\n      giant moles. They lingered for a moment on the steps, and watched\r\n      the white holiday moon.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPale moons like that one\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Amory made a vague gesture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmake\r\n      people mysterieuse. You look like a young witch with her cap off\r\n      and her hair sorta mussed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94her hands clutched at her hair\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\n      leave it, it looks _good_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They drifted up the stairs and Myra led the way into the little\r\n      den of his dreams, where a cosy fire was burning before a big\r\n      sink-down couch. A few years later this was to be a great stage\r\n      for Amory, a cradle for many an emotional crisis. Now they talked\r\n      for a moment about bobbing parties.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always a bunch of shy fellas,\xe2\x80\x9d he commented, \xe2\x80\x9csitting at\r\n      the tail of the bob, sorta lurkin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 whisperin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 pushin\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      each other off. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s always some crazy cross-eyed\r\n      girl\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he gave a terrifying imitation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s always talkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      _hard_, sorta, to the chaperon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re such a funny boy,\xe2\x80\x9d puzzled Myra.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99y\xe2\x80\x99 mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Amory gave immediate attention, on his own\r\n      ground at last.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94always talking about crazy things. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come ski-ing\r\n      with Marylyn and I to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like girls in the daytime,\xe2\x80\x9d he said shortly, and then,\r\n      thinking this a bit abrupt, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I like you.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\n      cleared his throat. \xe2\x80\x9cI like you first and second and third.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Myra\xe2\x80\x99s eyes became dreamy. What a story this would make to tell\r\n      Marylyn! Here on the couch with this _wonderful_-looking boy\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      little fire\xe2\x80\x94the sense that they were alone in the great building\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      Myra capitulated. The atmosphere was too appropriate.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI like you the first twenty-five,\xe2\x80\x9d she confessed, her voice\r\n      trembling, \xe2\x80\x9cand Froggy Parker twenty-sixth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Froggy had fallen twenty-five places in one hour. As yet he had\r\n      not even noticed it.\r\n\r\n      But Amory, being on the spot, leaned over quickly and kissed\r\n      Myra\xe2\x80\x99s cheek. He had never kissed a girl before, and he tasted\r\n      his lips curiously, as if he had munched some new fruit. Then\r\n      their lips brushed like young wild flowers in the wind.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re awful,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoiced Myra gently. She slipped her hand into\r\n      his, her head drooped against his shoulder. Sudden revulsion\r\n      seized Amory, disgust, loathing for the whole incident. He\r\n      desired frantically to be away, never to see Myra again, never to\r\n      kiss any one; he became conscious of his face and hers, of their\r\n      clinging hands, and he wanted to creep out of his body and hide\r\n      somewhere safe out of sight, up in the corner of his mind.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cKiss me again.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice came out of a great void.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard himself saying. There was another\r\n      pause.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated passionately.\r\n\r\n      Myra sprang up, her cheeks pink with bruised vanity, the great\r\n      bow on the back of her head trembling sympathetically.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ever dare to speak to me\r\n      again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell mama you kissed me! I will too! I will too! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\n      mama, and she won\xe2\x80\x99t let me play with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory rose and stared at her helplessly, as though she were a new\r\n      animal of whose presence on the earth he had not heretofore been\r\n      aware.\r\n\r\n      The door opened suddenly, and Myra\xe2\x80\x99s mother appeared on the\r\n      threshold, fumbling with her lorgnette.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, adjusting it benignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe man at the desk\r\n      told me you two children were up here\xe2\x80\x94How do you do, Amory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory watched Myra and waited for the crash\xe2\x80\x94but none came. The\r\n      pout faded, the high pink subsided, and Myra\xe2\x80\x99s voice was placid\r\n      as a summer lake when she answered her mother.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, we started so late, mama, that I thought we might as well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He heard from below the shrieks of laughter, and smelled the\r\n      vapid odor of hot chocolate and tea-cakes as he silently followed\r\n      mother and daughter down-stairs. The sound of the graphophone\r\n      mingled with the voices of many girls humming the air, and a\r\n      faint glow was born and spread over him:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cCasey-Jones\xe2\x80\x94mounted to the cab-un Casey-Jones\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99th his orders in his\r\n   hand. Casey-Jones\xe2\x80\x94mounted to the cab-un Took his farewell journey to\r\n   the prom-ised land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      SNAPSHOTS OF THE YOUNG EGOTIST\r\n\r\n      Amory spent nearly two years in Minneapolis. The first winter he\r\n      wore moccasins that were born yellow, but after many applications\r\n      of oil and dirt assumed their mature color, a dirty, greenish\r\n      brown; he wore a gray plaid mackinaw coat, and a red toboggan\r\n      cap. His dog, Count Del Monte, ate the red cap, so his uncle gave\r\n      him a gray one that pulled down over his face. The trouble with\r\n      this one was that you breathed into it and your breath froze; one\r\n      day the darn thing froze his cheek. He rubbed snow on his cheek,\r\n      but it turned bluish-black just the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Count Del Monte ate a box of bluing once, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt\r\n      him. Later, however, he lost his mind and ran madly up the\r\n      street, bumping into fences, rolling in gutters, and pursuing his\r\n      eccentric course out of Amory\xe2\x80\x99s life. Amory cried on his bed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little Count,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _poor_ little _Count!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      After several months he suspected Count of a fine piece of\r\n      emotional acting.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Amory and Frog Parker considered that the greatest line in\r\n      literature occurred in Act III of \xe2\x80\x9cArsene Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They sat in the first row at the Wednesday and Saturday matinees.\r\n      The line was:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf one can\xe2\x80\x99t be a great artist or a great soldier, the next best\r\n      thing is to be a great criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      Amory fell in love again, and wrote a poem. This was it:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cMarylyn and Sallee, Those are the girls for me. Marylyn stands\r\n   above Sallee in that sweet, deep love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He was interested in whether McGovern of Minnesota would make the\r\n      first or second All-American, how to do the card-pass, how to do\r\n      the coin-pass, chameleon ties, how babies were born, and whether\r\n      Three-fingered Brown was really a better pitcher than Christie\r\n      Mathewson.\r\n\r\n      Among other things he read: \xe2\x80\x9cFor the Honor of the School,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Women\xe2\x80\x9d (twice), \xe2\x80\x9cThe Common Law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSapho,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDangerous Dan\r\n      McGrew,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Broad Highway\xe2\x80\x9d (three times), \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fall of the\r\n      House of Usher,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThree Weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMary Ware, the Little Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      Chum,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGunga Din,\xe2\x80\x9d The Police Gazette, and Jim-Jam Jems.\r\n\r\n      He had all the Henty biasses in history, and was particularly\r\n      fond of the cheerful murder stories of Mary Roberts Rinehart.\r\n\r\n\r\n      School ruined his French and gave him a distaste for standard\r\n      authors. His masters considered him idle, unreliable and\r\n      superficially clever.\r\n\r\n\r\n      He collected locks of hair from many girls. He wore the rings of\r\n      several. Finally he could borrow no more rings, owing to his\r\n      nervous habit of chewing them out of shape. This, it seemed,\r\n      usually aroused the jealous suspicions of the next borrower.\r\n\r\n\r\n      All through the summer months Amory and Frog Parker went each\r\n      week to the Stock Company. Afterward they would stroll home in\r\n      the balmy air of August night, dreaming along Hennepin and\r\n      Nicollet Avenues, through the gay crowd. Amory wondered how\r\n      people could fail to notice that he was a boy marked for glory,\r\n      and when faces of the throng turned toward him and ambiguous eyes\r\n      stared into his, he assumed the most romantic of expressions and\r\n      walked on the air cushions that lie on the asphalts of fourteen.\r\n\r\n      Always, after he was in bed, there were voices\xe2\x80\x94indefinite,\r\n      fading, enchanting\xe2\x80\x94just outside his window, and before he fell\r\n      asleep he would dream one of his favorite waking dreams, the one\r\n      about becoming a great half-back, or the one about the Japanese\r\n      invasion, when he was rewarded by being made the youngest general\r\n      in the world. It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the\r\n      being. This, too, was quite characteristic of Amory.\r\n\r\n\r\n      CODE OF THE YOUNG EGOTIST\r\n\r\n      Before he was summoned back to Lake Geneva, he had appeared, shy\r\n      but inwardly glowing, in his first long trousers, set off by a\r\n      purple accordion tie and a \xe2\x80\x9cBelmont\xe2\x80\x9d collar with the edges\r\n      unassailably meeting, purple socks, and handkerchief with a\r\n      purple border peeping from his breast pocket. But more than that,\r\n      he had formulated his first philosophy, a code to live by, which,\r\n      as near as it can be named, was a sort of aristocratic egotism.\r\n\r\n      He had realized that his best interests were bound up with those\r\n      of a certain variant, changing person, whose label, in order that\r\n      his past might always be identified with him, was Amory Blaine.\r\n      Amory marked himself a fortunate youth, capable of infinite\r\n      expansion for good or evil. He did not consider himself a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\r\n      char\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99ter,\xe2\x80\x9d but relied on his facility (learn things sorta\r\n      quick) and his superior mentality (read a lotta deep books). He\r\n      was proud of the fact that he could never become a mechanical or\r\n      scientific genius. From no other heights was he debarred.\r\n\r\n      Physically.\xe2\x80\x94Amory thought that he was exceedingly handsome. He\r\n      was. He fancied himself an athlete of possibilities and a supple\r\n      dancer.\r\n\r\n      Socially.\xe2\x80\x94Here his condition was, perhaps, most dangerous. He\r\n      granted himself personality, charm, magnetism, poise, the power\r\n      of dominating all contemporary males, the gift of fascinating all\r\n      women.\r\n\r\n      Mentally.\xe2\x80\x94Complete, unquestioned superiority.\r\n\r\n      Now a confession will have to be made. Amory had rather a Puritan\r\n      conscience. Not that he yielded to it\xe2\x80\x94later in life he almost\r\n      completely slew it\xe2\x80\x94but at fifteen it made him consider himself a\r\n      great deal worse than other boys... unscrupulousness... the\r\n      desire to influence people in almost every way, even for evil...\r\n      a certain coldness and lack of affection, amounting sometimes to\r\n      cruelty... a shifting sense of honor... an unholy selfishness...\r\n      a puzzled, furtive interest in everything concerning sex.\r\n\r\n      There was, also, a curious strain of weakness running crosswise\r\n      through his make-up... a harsh phrase from the lips of an older\r\n      boy (older boys usually detested him) was liable to sweep him off\r\n      his poise into surly sensitiveness, or timid stupidity... he was\r\n      a slave to his own moods and he felt that though he was capable\r\n      of recklessness and audacity, he possessed neither courage,\r\n      perseverance, nor self-respect.\r\n\r\n      Vanity, tempered with self-suspicion if not self-knowledge, a\r\n      sense of people as automatons to his will, a desire to \xe2\x80\x9cpass\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\n      many boys as possible and get to a vague top of the world... with\r\n      this background did Amory drift into adolescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n      PREPARATORY TO THE GREAT ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n      The train slowed up with midsummer languor at Lake Geneva, and\r\n      Amory caught sight of his mother waiting in her electric on the\r\n      gravelled station drive. It was an ancient electric, one of the\r\n      early types, and painted gray. The sight of her sitting there,\r\n      slenderly erect, and of her face, where beauty and dignity\r\n      combined, melting to a dreamy recollected smile, filled him with\r\n      a sudden great pride of her. As they kissed coolly and he stepped\r\n      into the electric, he felt a quick fear lest he had lost the\r\n      requisite charm to measure up to her.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDear boy\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re _so_ tall... look behind and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      anything coming...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She looked left and right, she slipped cautiously into a speed of\r\n      two miles an hour, beseeching Amory to act as sentinel; and at\r\n      one busy crossing she made him get out and run ahead to signal\r\n      her forward like a traffic policeman. Beatrice was what might be\r\n      termed a careful driver.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ tall\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99re still very handsome\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve skipped the\r\n      awkward age, or is that sixteen; perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s fourteen or\r\n      fifteen; I can never remember; but you\xe2\x80\x99ve skipped it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t embarrass me,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear boy, what odd clothes! They look as if they were a\r\n      _set_\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t they? Is your underwear purple, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory grunted impolitely.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou must go to Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 and get some really nice suits. Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n      have a talk to-night or perhaps to-morrow night. I want to tell\r\n      you about your heart\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably been neglecting your\r\n      heart\xe2\x80\x94and you don\xe2\x80\x99t _know_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory thought how superficial was the recent overlay of his own\r\n      generation. Aside from a minute shyness, he felt that the old\r\n      cynical kinship with his mother had not been one bit broken. Yet\r\n      for the first few days he wandered about the gardens and along\r\n      the shore in a state of superloneliness, finding a lethargic\r\n      content in smoking \xe2\x80\x9cBull\xe2\x80\x9d at the garage with one of the\r\n      chauffeurs.\r\n\r\n      The sixty acres of the estate were dotted with old and new summer\r\n      houses and many fountains and white benches that came suddenly\r\n      into sight from foliage-hung hiding-places; there was a great and\r\n      constantly increasing family of white cats that prowled the many\r\n      flower-beds and were silhouetted suddenly at night against the\r\n      darkening trees. It was on one of the shadowy paths that Beatrice\r\n      at last captured Amory, after Mr. Blaine had, as usual, retired\r\n      for the evening to his private library. After reproving him for\r\n      avoiding her, she took him for a long tete-a-tete in the\r\n      moonlight. He could not reconcile himself to her beauty, that was\r\n      mother to his own, the exquisite neck and shoulders, the grace of\r\n      a fortunate woman of thirty.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she crooned softly, \xe2\x80\x9cI had such a strange, weird\r\n      time after I left you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDid you, Beatrice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had my last breakdown\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she spoke of it as a sturdy,\r\n      gallant feat.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctors told me\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94her voice sang on a confidential note\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\n      if any man alive had done the consistent drinking that I have, he\r\n      would have been physically _shattered_, my dear, and in his\r\n      _grave_\xe2\x80\x94long in his grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory winced, and wondered how this would have sounded to Froggy\r\n      Parker.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Beatrice tragically, \xe2\x80\x9cI had dreams\xe2\x80\x94wonderful\r\n      visions.\xe2\x80\x9d She pressed the palms of her hands into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n      saw bronze rivers lapping marble shores, and great birds that\r\n      soared through the air, parti-colored birds with iridescent\r\n      plumage. I heard strange music and the flare of barbaric\r\n      trumpets\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory had snickered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Amory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI said go on, Beatrice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat was all\xe2\x80\x94it merely recurred and recurred\xe2\x80\x94gardens that\r\n      flaunted coloring against which this would be quite dull, moons\r\n      that whirled and swayed, paler than winter moons, more golden\r\n      than harvest moons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite well now, Beatrice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cQuite well\xe2\x80\x94as well as I will ever be. I am not understood,\r\n      Amory. I know that can\xe2\x80\x99t express it to you, Amory, but\xe2\x80\x94I am not\r\n      understood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory was quite moved. He put his arm around his mother, rubbing\r\n      his head gently against her shoulder.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Beatrice\xe2\x80\x94poor Beatrice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about _you_, Amory. Did you have two _horrible_ years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory considered lying, and then decided against it.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Beatrice. I enjoyed them. I adapted myself to the\r\n      bourgeoisie. I became conventional.\xe2\x80\x9d He surprised himself by\r\n      saying that, and he pictured how Froggy would have gaped.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBeatrice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to go away to school.\r\n      Everybody in Minneapolis is going to go away to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Beatrice showed some alarm.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re only fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but everybody goes away to school at fifteen, and I _want_\r\n      to, Beatrice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      On Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion the subject was dropped for the rest of\r\n      the walk, but a week later she delighted him by saying:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory, I have decided to let you have your way. If you still\r\n      want to, you can go to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99s in Connecticut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory felt a quick excitement.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s being arranged,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Beatrice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better that you\r\n      should go away. I\xe2\x80\x99d have preferred you to have gone to Eton, and\r\n      then to Christ Church, Oxford, but it seems impracticable now\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      for the present we\xe2\x80\x99ll let the university question take care of\r\n      itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do, Beatrice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows. It seems my fate to fret away my years in this\r\n      country. Not for a second do I regret being American\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I\r\n      think that a regret typical of very vulgar people, and I feel\r\n      sure we are the great coming nation\xe2\x80\x94yet\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she sighed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI feel\r\n      my life should have drowsed away close to an older, mellower\r\n      civilization, a land of greens and autumnal browns\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory did not answer, so his mother continued:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy regret is that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been abroad, but still, as you are\r\n      a man, it\xe2\x80\x99s better that you should grow up here under the\r\n      snarling eagle\xe2\x80\x94is that the right term?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory agreed that it was. She would not have appreciated the\r\n      Japanese invasion.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhen do I go to school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNext month. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to start East a little early to take\r\n      your examinations. After that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a free week, so I want\r\n      you to go up the Hudson and pay a visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo Monsignor Darcy, Amory. He wants to see you. He went to\r\n      Harrow and then to Yale\xe2\x80\x94became a Catholic. I want him to talk to\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x94I feel he can be such a help\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stroked his auburn hair\r\n      gently. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Amory, dear Amory\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDear Beatrice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      So early in September Amory, provided with \xe2\x80\x9csix suits summer\r\n      underwear, six suits winter underwear, one sweater or T shirt,\r\n      one jersey, one overcoat, winter, etc.,\xe2\x80\x9d set out for New England,\r\n      the land of schools.\r\n\r\n      There were Andover and Exeter with their memories of New England\r\n      dead\xe2\x80\x94large, college-like democracies; St. Mark\xe2\x80\x99s, Groton, St.\r\n      Regis\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94recruited from Boston and the Knickerbocker families of\r\n      New York; St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s, with its great rinks; Pomfret and St.\r\n      George\xe2\x80\x99s, prosperous and well-dressed; Taft and Hotchkiss, which\r\n      prepared the wealth of the Middle West for social success at\r\n      Yale; Pawling, Westminster, Choate, Kent, and a hundred others;\r\n      all milling out their well-set-up, conventional, impressive type,\r\n      year after year; their mental stimulus the college entrance\r\n      exams; their vague purpose set forth in a hundred circulars as\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo impart a Thorough Mental, Moral, and Physical Training as a\r\n      Christian Gentleman, to fit the boy for meeting the problems of\r\n      his day and generation, and to give a solid foundation in the\r\n      Arts and Sciences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      At St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99 Amory stayed three days and took his exams with a\r\n      scoffing confidence, then doubling back to New York to pay his\r\n      tutelary visit. The metropolis, barely glimpsed, made little\r\n      impression on him, except for the sense of cleanliness he drew\r\n      from the tall white buildings seen from a Hudson River steamboat\r\n      in the early morning. Indeed, his mind was so crowded with dreams\r\n      of athletic prowess at school that he considered this visit only\r\n      as a rather tiresome prelude to the great adventure. This,\r\n      however, it did not prove to be.\r\n\r\n      Monsignor Darcy\xe2\x80\x99s house was an ancient, rambling structure set on\r\n      a hill overlooking the river, and there lived its owner, between\r\n      his trips to all parts of the Roman-Catholic world, rather like\r\n      an exiled Stuart king waiting to be called to the rule of his\r\n      land. Monsignor was forty-four then, and bustling\xe2\x80\x94a trifle too\r\n      stout for symmetry, with hair the color of spun gold, and a\r\n      brilliant, enveloping personality. When he came into a room clad\r\n      in his full purple regalia from thatch to toe, he resembled a\r\n      Turner sunset, and attracted both admiration and attention. He\r\n      had written two novels: one of them violently anti-Catholic, just\r\n      before his conversion, and five years later another, in which he\r\n      had attempted to turn all his clever jibes against Catholics into\r\n      even cleverer innuendoes against Episcopalians. He was intensely\r\n      ritualistic, startlingly dramatic, loved the idea of God enough\r\n      to be a celibate, and rather liked his neighbor.\r\n\r\n      Children adored him because he was like a child; youth revelled\r\n      in his company because he was still a youth, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\n      shocked. In the proper land and century he might have been a\r\n      Richelieu\xe2\x80\x94at present he was a very moral, very religious (if not\r\n      particularly pious) clergyman, making a great mystery about\r\n      pulling rusty wires, and appreciating life to the fullest, if not\r\n      entirely enjoying it.\r\n\r\n      He and Amory took to each other at first sight\xe2\x80\x94the jovial,\r\n      impressive prelate who could dazzle an embassy ball, and the\r\n      green-eyed, intent youth, in his first long trousers, accepted in\r\n      their own minds a relation of father and son within a half-hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      conversation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting to see you for years. Take a big\r\n      chair and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just come from school\xe2\x80\x94St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99s, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSo your mother says\xe2\x80\x94a remarkable woman; have a cigarette\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      sure you smoke. Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re like me, you loathe all science\r\n      and mathematics\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory nodded vehemently.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHate \xe2\x80\x99em all. Like English and history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course. You\xe2\x80\x99ll hate school for a while, too, but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x99re going to St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s school, and democracy won\xe2\x80\x99t hit you\r\n      so early. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find plenty of that in college.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI want to go to Princeton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but I\r\n      think of all Harvard men as sissies, like I used to be, and all\r\n      Yale men as wearing big blue sweaters and smoking pipes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Monsignor chuckled.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m one, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re different\xe2\x80\x94I think of Princeton as being lazy and\r\n      good-looking and aristocratic\xe2\x80\x94you know, like a spring day.\r\n      Harvard seems sort of indoors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Yale is November, crisp and energetic,\xe2\x80\x9d finished Monsignor.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never\r\n      recovered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI was for Bonnie Prince Charlie,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you were\xe2\x80\x94and for Hannibal\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and for the Southern Confederacy.\xe2\x80\x9d He was rather sceptical\r\n      about being an Irish patriot\xe2\x80\x94he suspected that being Irish was\r\n      being somewhat common\xe2\x80\x94but Monsignor assured him that Ireland was\r\n      a romantic lost cause and Irish people quite charming, and that\r\n      it should, by all means, be one of his principal biasses.\r\n\r\n      After a crowded hour which included several more cigarettes, and\r\n      during which Monsignor learned, to his surprise but not to his\r\n      horror, that Amory had not been brought up a Catholic, he\r\n      announced that he had another guest. This turned out to be the\r\n      Honorable Thornton Hancock, of Boston, ex-minister to The Hague,\r\n      author of an erudite history of the Middle Ages and the last of a\r\n      distinguished, patriotic, and brilliant family.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe comes here for a rest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monsignor confidentially,\r\n      treating Amory as a contemporary. \xe2\x80\x9cI act as an escape from the\r\n      weariness of agnosticism, and I think I\xe2\x80\x99m the only man who knows\r\n      how his staid old mind is really at sea and longs for a sturdy\r\n      spar like the Church to cling to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Their first luncheon was one of the memorable events of Amory\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      early life. He was quite radiant and gave off a peculiar\r\n      brightness and charm. Monsignor called out the best that he had\r\n      thought by question and suggestion, and Amory talked with an\r\n      ingenious brilliance of a thousand impulses and desires and\r\n      repulsions and faiths and fears. He and Monsignor held the floor,\r\n      and the older man, with his less receptive, less accepting, yet\r\n      certainly not colder mentality, seemed content to listen and bask\r\n      in the mellow sunshine that played between these two. Monsignor\r\n      gave the effect of sunlight to many people; Amory gave it in his\r\n      youth and, to some extent, when he was very much older, but never\r\n      again was it quite so mutually spontaneous.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a radiant boy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Thornton Hancock, who had seen the\r\n      splendor of two continents and talked with Parnell and Gladstone\r\n      and Bismarck\xe2\x80\x94and afterward he added to Monsignor: \xe2\x80\x9cBut his\r\n      education ought not to be intrusted to a school or college.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      But for the next four years the best of Amory\xe2\x80\x99s intellect was\r\n      concentrated on matters of popularity, the intricacies of a\r\n      university social system and American Society as represented by\r\n      Biltmore Teas and Hot Springs golf-links.\r\n\r\n      ... In all, a wonderful week, that saw Amory\xe2\x80\x99s mind turned inside\r\n      out, a hundred of his theories confirmed, and his joy of life\r\n      crystallized to a thousand ambitions. Not that the conversation\r\n      was scholastic\xe2\x80\x94heaven forbid! Amory had only the vaguest idea as\r\n      to what Bernard Shaw was\xe2\x80\x94but Monsignor made quite as much out of\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe Beloved Vagabond\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSir Nigel,\xe2\x80\x9d taking good care that\r\n      Amory never once felt out of his depth.\r\n\r\n      But the trumpets were sounding for Amory\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary skirmish\r\n      with his own generation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not sorry to go, of course. With people like us our home\r\n      is where we are not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monsignor.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ sorry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99re not. No one person in the world is necessary to you\r\n      or to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE EGOTIST DOWN\r\n\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s two years at St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99, though in turn painful and\r\n      triumphant, had as little real significance in his own life as\r\n      the American \xe2\x80\x9cprep\xe2\x80\x9d school, crushed as it is under the heel of\r\n      the universities, has to American life in general. We have no\r\n      Eton to create the self-consciousness of a governing class; we\r\n      have, instead, clean, flaccid and innocuous preparatory schools.\r\n\r\n      He went all wrong at the start, was generally considered both\r\n      conceited and arrogant, and universally detested. He played\r\n      football intensely, alternating a reckless brilliancy with a\r\n      tendency to keep himself as safe from hazard as decency would\r\n      permit. In a wild panic he backed out of a fight with a boy his\r\n      own size, to a chorus of scorn, and a week later, in desperation,\r\n      picked a battle with another boy very much bigger, from which he\r\n      emerged badly beaten, but rather proud of himself.\r\n\r\n      He was resentful against all those in authority over him, and\r\n      this, combined with a lazy indifference toward his work,\r\n      exasperated every master in school. He grew discouraged and\r\n      imagined himself a pariah; took to sulking in corners and reading\r\n      after lights. With a dread of being alone he attached a few\r\n      friends, but since they were not among the elite of the school,\r\n      he used them simply as mirrors of himself, audiences before which\r\n      he might do that posing absolutely essential to him. He was\r\n      unbearably lonely, desperately unhappy.\r\n\r\n      There were some few grains of comfort. Whenever Amory was\r\n      submerged, his vanity was the last part to go below the surface,\r\n      so he could still enjoy a comfortable glow when \xe2\x80\x9cWookey-wookey,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      the deaf old housekeeper, told him that he was the best-looking\r\n      boy she had ever seen. It had pleased him to be the lightest and\r\n      youngest man on the first football squad; it pleased him when\r\n      Doctor Dougall told him at the end of a heated conference that he\r\n      could, if he wished, get the best marks in school. But Doctor\r\n      Dougall was wrong. It was temperamentally impossible for Amory to\r\n      get the best marks in school.\r\n\r\n      Miserable, confined to bounds, unpopular with both faculty and\r\n      students\xe2\x80\x94that was Amory\xe2\x80\x99s first term. But at Christmas he had\r\n      returned to Minneapolis, tight-lipped and strangely jubilant.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I was sort of fresh at first,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Frog Parker\r\n      patronizingly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I got along fine\xe2\x80\x94lightest man on the squad.\r\n      You ought to go away to school, Froggy. It\xe2\x80\x99s great stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      INCIDENT OF THE WELL-MEANING PROFESSOR\r\n\r\n      On the last night of his first term, Mr. Margotson, the senior\r\n      master, sent word to study hall that Amory was to come to his\r\n      room at nine. Amory suspected that advice was forthcoming, but he\r\n      determined to be courteous, because this Mr. Margotson had been\r\n      kindly disposed toward him.\r\n\r\n      His summoner received him gravely, and motioned him to a chair.\r\n      He hemmed several times and looked consciously kind, as a man\r\n      will when he knows he\xe2\x80\x99s on delicate ground.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve sent for you on a personal matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed you this year and I\xe2\x80\x94I like you. I think you have in\r\n      you the makings of a\xe2\x80\x94a very good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory managed to articulate. He hated having people\r\n      talk as if he were an admitted failure.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the older man blindly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\n      not very popular with the boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d Amory licked his lips.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94I thought you might not understand exactly what it was\r\n      they\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94objected to. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you, because I\r\n      believe\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94that when a boy knows his difficulties he\xe2\x80\x99s better\r\n      able to cope with them\xe2\x80\x94to conform to what others expect of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      He a-hemmed again with delicate reticence, and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\n      seem to think that you\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94rather too fresh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory could stand no more. He rose from his chair, scarcely\r\n      controlling his voice when he spoke.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94oh, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ you s\xe2\x80\x99pose I know.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\n      what they think; do you s\xe2\x80\x99pose you have to _tell_ me!\xe2\x80\x9d He paused.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go back now\xe2\x80\x94hope I\xe2\x80\x99m not rude\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He left the room hurriedly. In the cool air outside, as he walked\r\n      to his house, he exulted in his refusal to be helped.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat _damn_ old fool!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t _know!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He decided, however, that this was a good excuse not to go back\r\n      to study hall that night, so, comfortably couched up in his room,\r\n      he munched Nabiscos and finished \xe2\x80\x9cThe White Company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      INCIDENT OF THE WONDERFUL GIRL\r\n\r\n      There was a bright star in February. New York burst upon him on\r\n      Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Birthday with the brilliance of a long-anticipated\r\n      event. His glimpse of it as a vivid whiteness against a deep-blue\r\n      sky had left a picture of splendor that rivalled the dream cities\r\n      in the Arabian Nights; but this time he saw it by electric light,\r\n      and romance gleamed from the chariot-race sign on Broadway and\r\n      from the women\xe2\x80\x99s eyes at the Astor, where he and young Paskert\r\n      from St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99 had dinner. When they walked down the aisle of\r\n      the theatre, greeted by the nervous twanging and discord of\r\n      untuned violins and the sensuous, heavy fragrance of paint and\r\n      powder, he moved in a sphere of epicurean delight. Everything\r\n      enchanted him. The play was \xe2\x80\x9cThe Little Millionaire,\xe2\x80\x9d with George\r\n      M. Cohan, and there was one stunning young brunette who made him\r\n      sit with brimming eyes in the ecstasy of watching her dance.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94wonderful girl, What a wonderful girl you are\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      sang the tenor, and Amory agreed silently, but passionately.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x94your\xe2\x80\x94wonderful words Thrill me through\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The violins swelled and quavered on the last notes, the girl sank\r\n      to a crumpled butterfly on the stage, a great burst of clapping\r\n      filled the house. Oh, to fall in love like that, to the\r\n      languorous magic melody of such a tune!\r\n\r\n      The last scene was laid on a roof-garden, and the cellos sighed\r\n      to the musical moon, while light adventure and facile froth-like\r\n      comedy flitted back and forth in the calcium. Amory was on fire\r\n      to be an habitui of roof-gardens, to meet a girl who should look\r\n      like that\xe2\x80\x94better, that very girl; whose hair would be drenched\r\n      with golden moonlight, while at his elbow sparkling wine was\r\n      poured by an unintelligible waiter. When the curtain fell for the\r\n      last time he gave such a long sigh that the people in front of\r\n      him twisted around and stared and said loud enough for him to\r\n      hear:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a _remarkable_-looking boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      This took his mind off the play, and he wondered if he really did\r\n      seem handsome to the population of New York.\r\n\r\n      Paskert and he walked in silence toward their hotel. The former\r\n      was the first to speak. His uncertain fifteen-year-old voice\r\n      broke in in a melancholy strain on Amory\xe2\x80\x99s musings:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d marry that girl to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      There was no need to ask what girl he referred to.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be proud to take her home and introduce her to my people,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      continued Paskert.\r\n\r\n      Amory was distinctly impressed. He wished he had said it instead\r\n      of Paskert. It sounded so mature.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder about actresses; are they all pretty bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, _sir_, not by a darn sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the worldly youth with\r\n      emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know that girl\xe2\x80\x99s as good as gold. I can tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They wandered on, mixing in the Broadway crowd, dreaming on the\r\n      music that eddied out of the cafes. New faces flashed on and off\r\n      like myriad lights, pale or rouged faces, tired, yet sustained by\r\n      a weary excitement. Amory watched them in fascination. He was\r\n      planning his life. He was going to live in New York, and be known\r\n      at every restaurant and cafe, wearing a dress-suit from early\r\n      evening to early morning, sleeping away the dull hours of the\r\n      forenoon.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, _sir_, I\xe2\x80\x99d marry that girl to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      HEROIC IN GENERAL TONE\r\n\r\n      October of his second and last year at St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99 was a high\r\n      point in Amory\xe2\x80\x99s memory. The game with Groton was played from\r\n      three of a snappy, exhilarating afternoon far into the crisp\r\n      autumnal twilight, and Amory at quarter-back, exhorting in wild\r\n      despair, making impossible tackles, calling signals in a voice\r\n      that had diminished to a hoarse, furious whisper, yet found time\r\n      to revel in the blood-stained bandage around his head, and the\r\n      straining, glorious heroism of plunging, crashing bodies and\r\n      aching limbs. For those minutes courage flowed like wine out of\r\n      the November dusk, and he was the eternal hero, one with the\r\n      sea-rover on the prow of a Norse galley, one with Roland and\r\n      Horatius, Sir Nigel and Ted Coy, scraped and stripped into trim\r\n      and then flung by his own will into the breach, beating back the\r\n      tide, hearing from afar the thunder of cheers... finally bruised\r\n      and weary, but still elusive, circling an end, twisting, changing\r\n      pace, straight-arming... falling behind the Groton goal with two\r\n      men on his legs, in the only touchdown of the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SLICKER\r\n\r\n      From the scoffing superiority of sixth-form year and success\r\n      Amory looked back with cynical wonder on his status of the year\r\n      before. He was changed as completely as Amory Blaine could ever\r\n      be changed. Amory plus Beatrice plus two years in\r\n      Minneapolis\xe2\x80\x94these had been his ingredients when he entered St.\r\n      Regis\xe2\x80\x99. But the Minneapolis years were not a thick enough overlay\r\n      to conceal the \xe2\x80\x9cAmory plus Beatrice\xe2\x80\x9d from the ferreting eyes of a\r\n      boarding-school, so St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99 had very painfully drilled\r\n      Beatrice out of him, and begun to lay down new and more\r\n      conventional planking on the fundamental Amory. But both St.\r\n      Regis\xe2\x80\x99 and Amory were unconscious of the fact that this\r\n      fundamental Amory had not in himself changed. Those qualities for\r\n      which he had suffered, his moodiness, his tendency to pose, his\r\n      laziness, and his love of playing the fool, were now taken as a\r\n      matter of course, recognized eccentricities in a star\r\n      quarter-back, a clever actor, and the editor of the St. Regis\r\n      Tattler: it puzzled him to see impressionable small boys\r\n      imitating the very vanities that had not long ago been\r\n      contemptible weaknesses.\r\n\r\n      After the football season he slumped into dreamy content. The\r\n      night of the pre-holiday dance he slipped away and went early to\r\n      bed for the pleasure of hearing the violin music cross the grass\r\n      and come surging in at his window. Many nights he lay there\r\n      dreaming awake of secret cafes in Mont Martre, where ivory women\r\n      delved in romantic mysteries with diplomats and soldiers of\r\n      fortune, while orchestras played Hungarian waltzes and the air\r\n      was thick and exotic with intrigue and moonlight and adventure.\r\n      In the spring he read \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99Allegro,\xe2\x80\x9d by request, and was inspired\r\n      to lyrical outpourings on the subject of Arcady and the pipes of\r\n      Pan. He moved his bed so that the sun would wake him at dawn that\r\n      he might dress and go out to the archaic swing that hung from an\r\n      apple-tree near the sixth-form house. Seating himself in this he\r\n      would pump higher and higher until he got the effect of swinging\r\n      into the wide air, into a fairyland of piping satyrs and nymphs\r\n      with the faces of fair-haired girls he passed in the streets of\r\n      Eastchester. As the swing reached its highest point, Arcady\r\n      really lay just over the brow of a certain hill, where the brown\r\n      road dwindled out of sight in a golden dot.\r\n\r\n      He read voluminously all spring, the beginning of his eighteenth\r\n      year: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gentleman from Indiana,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe New Arabian Nights,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe Morals of Marcus Ordeyne,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man Who Was Thursday,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\n      he liked without understanding; \xe2\x80\x9cStover at Yale,\xe2\x80\x9d that became\r\n      somewhat of a text-book; \xe2\x80\x9cDombey and Son,\xe2\x80\x9d because he thought he\r\n      really should read better stuff; Robert Chambers, David Graham\r\n      Phillips, and E. Phillips Oppenheim complete, and a scattering of\r\n      Tennyson and Kipling. Of all his class work only \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99Allegro\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n      some quality of rigid clarity in solid geometry stirred his\r\n      languid interest.\r\n\r\n      As June drew near, he felt the need of conversation to formulate\r\n      his own ideas, and, to his surprise, found a co-philosopher in\r\n      Rahill, the president of the sixth form. In many a talk, on the\r\n      highroad or lying belly-down along the edge of the baseball\r\n      diamond, or late at night with their cigarettes glowing in the\r\n      dark, they threshed out the questions of school, and there was\r\n      developed the term \xe2\x80\x9cslicker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGot tobacco?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Rahill one night, putting his head\r\n      inside the door five minutes after lights.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTake a couple of pillows and lie in the window-seat, why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory sat up in bed and lit a cigarette while Rahill settled for\r\n      a conversation. Rahill\xe2\x80\x99s favorite subject was the respective\r\n      futures of the sixth form, and Amory never tired of outlining\r\n      them for his benefit.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTed Converse? \xe2\x80\x99At\xe2\x80\x99s easy. He\xe2\x80\x99ll fail his exams, tutor all summer\r\n      at Harstrum\xe2\x80\x99s, get into Sheff with about four conditions, and\r\n      flunk out in the middle of the freshman year. Then he\xe2\x80\x99ll go back\r\n      West and raise hell for a year or so; finally his father will\r\n      make him go into the paint business. He\xe2\x80\x99ll marry and have four\r\n      sons, all bone heads. He\xe2\x80\x99ll always think St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99s spoiled him,\r\n      so he\xe2\x80\x99ll send his sons to day school in Portland. He\xe2\x80\x99ll die of\r\n      locomotor ataxia when he\xe2\x80\x99s forty-one, and his wife will give a\r\n      baptizing stand or whatever you call it to the Presbyterian\r\n      Church, with his name on it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHold up, Amory. That\xe2\x80\x99s too darned gloomy. How about yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in a superior class. You are, too. We\xe2\x80\x99re philosophers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSure you are. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a darn good head on you.\xe2\x80\x9d But Amory\r\n      knew that nothing in the abstract, no theory or generality, ever\r\n      moved Rahill until he stubbed his toe upon the concrete minutiae\r\n      of it.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Rahill. \xe2\x80\x9cI let people impose on me here and\r\n      don\xe2\x80\x99t get anything out of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m the prey of my friends, damn\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x94do their lessons, get \xe2\x80\x99em out of trouble, pay \xe2\x80\x99em stupid\r\n      summer visits, and always entertain their kid sisters; keep my\r\n      temper when they get selfish and then they think they pay me back\r\n      by voting for me and telling me I\xe2\x80\x99m the \xe2\x80\x98big man\xe2\x80\x99 of St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n      I want to get where everybody does their own work and I can tell\r\n      people where to go. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of being nice to every poor fish in\r\n      school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a slicker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory suddenly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cA what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cA slicker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of them. You\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\n      one, and neither am I, though I am more than you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWho is one? What makes you one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory considered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why, I suppose that the _sign_ of it is when a fellow slicks\r\n      his hair back with water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLike Carstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94sure. He\xe2\x80\x99s a slicker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They spent two evenings getting an exact definition. The slicker\r\n      was good-looking or clean-looking; he had brains, social brains,\r\n      that is, and he used all means on the broad path of honesty to\r\n      get ahead, be popular, admired, and never in trouble. He dressed\r\n      well, was particularly neat in appearance, and derived his name\r\n      from the fact that his hair was inevitably worn short, soaked in\r\n      water or tonic, parted in the middle, and slicked back as the\r\n      current of fashion dictated. The slickers of that year had\r\n      adopted tortoise-shell spectacles as badges of their slickerhood,\r\n      and this made them so easy to recognize that Amory and Rahill\r\n      never missed one. The slicker seemed distributed through school,\r\n      always a little wiser and shrewder than his contemporaries,\r\n      managing some team or other, and keeping his cleverness carefully\r\n      concealed.\r\n\r\n      Amory found the slicker a most valuable classification until his\r\n      junior year in college, when the outline became so blurred and\r\n      indeterminate that it had to be subdivided many times, and became\r\n      only a quality. Amory\xe2\x80\x99s secret ideal had all the slicker\r\n      qualifications, but, in addition, courage and tremendous brains\r\n      and talents\xe2\x80\x94also Amory conceded him a bizarre streak that was\r\n      quite irreconcilable to the slicker proper.\r\n\r\n      This was a first real break from the hypocrisy of school\r\n      tradition. The slicker was a definite element of success,\r\n      differing intrinsically from the prep school \xe2\x80\x9cbig man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cTHE SLICKER\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n 1. Clever sense of social values.\r\n 2. Dresses well.  Pretends that dress is superficial\xe2\x80\x94but knows that it\r\n isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n 3. Goes into such activities as he can shine in.\r\n 4. Gets to college and is, in a worldly way, successful.\r\n 5. Hair slicked.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cTHE BIG MAN\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n 1. Inclined to stupidity and unconscious of social values.\r\n 2. Thinks dress is superficial, and is inclined to be careless about\r\n it.\r\n 3. Goes out for everything from a sense of duty.\r\n 4. Gets to college and has a problematical future.  Feels lost without\r\n his circle, and always says that school days were happiest, after all.\r\n  Goes back to school and makes speeches about what St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99s boys\r\n are doing.\r\n 5. Hair not slicked.\r\n\r\n      Amory had decided definitely on Princeton, even though he would\r\n      be the only boy entering that year from St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99. Yale had a\r\n      romance and glamour from the tales of Minneapolis, and St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      men who had been \xe2\x80\x9ctapped for Skull and Bones,\xe2\x80\x9d but Princeton drew\r\n      him most, with its atmosphere of bright colors and its alluring\r\n      reputation as the pleasantest country club in America. Dwarfed by\r\n      the menacing college exams, Amory\xe2\x80\x99s school days drifted into the\r\n      past. Years afterward, when he went back to St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99, he seemed\r\n      to have forgotten the successes of sixth-form year, and to be\r\n      able to picture himself only as the unadjustable boy who had\r\n      hurried down corridors, jeered at by his rabid contemporaries mad\r\n      with common sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER 2. Spires and Gargoyles\r\n\r\n\r\n      At first Amory noticed only the wealth of sunshine creeping\r\n      across the long, green swards, dancing on the leaded\r\n      window-panes, and swimming around the tops of spires and towers\r\n      and battlemented walls. Gradually he realized that he was really\r\n      walking up University Place, self-conscious about his suitcase,\r\n      developing a new tendency to glare straight ahead when he passed\r\n      any one. Several times he could have sworn that men turned to\r\n      look at him critically. He wondered vaguely if there was\r\n      something the matter with his clothes, and wished he had shaved\r\n      that morning on the train. He felt unnecessarily stiff and\r\n      awkward among these white-flannelled, bareheaded youths, who must\r\n      be juniors and seniors, judging from the savoir faire with which\r\n      they strolled.\r\n\r\n      He found that 12 University Place was a large, dilapidated\r\n      mansion, at present apparently uninhabited, though he knew it\r\n      housed usually a dozen freshmen. After a hurried skirmish with\r\n      his landlady he sallied out on a tour of exploration, but he had\r\n      gone scarcely a block when he became horribly conscious that he\r\n      must be the only man in town who was wearing a hat. He returned\r\n      hurriedly to 12 University, left his derby, and, emerging\r\n      bareheaded, loitered down Nassau Street, stopping to investigate\r\n      a display of athletic photographs in a store window, including a\r\n      large one of Allenby, the football captain, and next attracted by\r\n      the sign \xe2\x80\x9cJigger Shop\xe2\x80\x9d over a confectionary window. This sounded\r\n      familiar, so he sauntered in and took a seat on a high stool.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cChocolate sundae,\xe2\x80\x9d he told a colored person.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDouble chocolate jiggah? Anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBacon bun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He munched four of these, finding them of pleasing savor, and\r\n      then consumed another double-chocolate jigger before ease\r\n      descended upon him. After a cursory inspection of the\r\n      pillow-cases, leather pennants, and Gibson Girls that lined the\r\n      walls, he left, and continued along Nassau Street with his hands\r\n      in his pockets. Gradually he was learning to distinguish between\r\n      upper classmen and entering men, even though the freshman cap\r\n      would not appear until the following Monday. Those who were too\r\n      obviously, too nervously at home were freshmen, for as each train\r\n      brought a new contingent it was immediately absorbed into the\r\n      hatless, white-shod, book-laden throng, whose function seemed to\r\n      be to drift endlessly up and down the street, emitting great\r\n      clouds of smoke from brand-new pipes. By afternoon Amory realized\r\n      that now the newest arrivals were taking him for an upper\r\n      classman, and he tried conscientiously to look both pleasantly\r\n      blas\xc3\xa9 and casually critical, which was as near as he could\r\n      analyze the prevalent facial expression.\r\n\r\n      At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock he felt the need of hearing his own voice, so he\r\n      retreated to his house to see if any one else had arrived. Having\r\n      climbed the rickety stairs he scrutinized his room resignedly,\r\n      concluding that it was hopeless to attempt any more inspired\r\n      decoration than class banners and tiger pictures. There was a tap\r\n      at the door.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      A slim face with gray eyes and a humorous smile appeared in the\r\n      doorway.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGot a hammer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94sorry. Maybe Mrs. Twelve, or whatever she goes by, has one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The stranger advanced into the room.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou an inmate of this asylum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory nodded.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAwful barn for the rent we pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory had to agree that it was.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI thought of the campus,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they say there\xe2\x80\x99s so few\r\n      freshmen that they\xe2\x80\x99re lost. Have to sit around and study for\r\n      something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The gray-eyed man decided to introduce himself.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBlaine\xe2\x80\x99s my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They shook hands with the fashionable low swoop. Amory grinned.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99d you prep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAndover\xe2\x80\x94where did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Regis\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, did you? I had a cousin there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They discussed the cousin thoroughly, and then Holiday announced\r\n      that he was to meet his brother for dinner at six.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome along and have a bite with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      At the Kenilworth Amory met Burne Holiday\xe2\x80\x94he of the gray eyes was\r\n      Kerry\xe2\x80\x94and during a limpid meal of thin soup and anaemic\r\n      vegetables they stared at the other freshmen, who sat either in\r\n      small groups looking very ill at ease, or in large groups seeming\r\n      very much at home.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI hear Commons is pretty bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the rumor. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to eat there\xe2\x80\x94or pay anyways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCrime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cImposition!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, at Princeton you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to swallow everything the first\r\n      year. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a damned prep school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory agreed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLot of pep, though,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone to Yale\r\n      for a million.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMe either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou going out for anything?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Amory of the elder\r\n      brother.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot me\xe2\x80\x94Burne here is going out for the Prince\xe2\x80\x94the Daily\r\n      Princetonian, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou going out for anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94yes.

This was followed by an indistinguishable song that\r\n      included much stamping and then by an endless, incoherent dirge.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cOh-h-h-h-h She works in a Jam Factoree And\xe2\x80\x94that-may-be-all-right\r\n   But you can\xe2\x80\x99t-fool-me For I know\xe2\x80\x94DAMN\xe2\x80\x94WELL That she\r\n   DON\xe2\x80\x99T-make-jam-all-night! Oh-h-h-h!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      As they pushed out, giving and receiving curious impersonal\r\n      glances, Amory decided that he liked the movies, wanted to enjoy\r\n      them as the row of upper classmen in front had enjoyed them, with\r\n      their arms along the backs of the seats, their comments Gaelic\r\n      and caustic, their attitude a mixture of critical wit and\r\n      tolerant amusement.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWant a sundae\xe2\x80\x94I mean a jigger?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kerry.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They suppered heavily and then, still sauntering, eased back to\r\n      12.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWonderful night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a whiz.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou men going to unpack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGuess so. Come on, Burne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory decided to sit for a while on the front steps, so he bade\r\n      them good night.\r\n\r\n      The great tapestries of trees had darkened to ghosts back at the\r\n      last edge of twilight. The early moon had drenched the arches\r\n      with pale blue, and, weaving over the night, in and out of the\r\n      gossamer rifts of moon, swept a song, a song with more than a\r\n      hint of sadness, infinitely transient, infinitely regretful.\r\n\r\n      He remembered that an alumnus of the nineties had told him of one\r\n      of Booth Tarkington\xe2\x80\x99s amusements: standing in mid-campus in the\r\n      small hours and singing tenor songs to the stars, arousing\r\n      mingled emotions in the couched undergraduates according to the\r\n      sentiment of their moods.\r\n\r\n      Now, far down the shadowy line of University Place a white-clad\r\n      phalanx broke the gloom, and marching figures, white-shirted,\r\n      white-trousered, swung rhythmically up the street, with linked\r\n      arms and heads thrown back:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cGoing back\xe2\x80\x94going back, Going\xe2\x80\x94back\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94Nas-sau\xe2\x80\x94Hall, Going back\xe2\x80\x94going\r\n   back\xe2\x80\x94 To the\xe2\x80\x94Best\xe2\x80\x94Old\xe2\x80\x94Place\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94All.

The\r\n      song soared so high that all dropped out except the tenors, who\r\n      bore the melody triumphantly past the danger-point and\r\n      relinquished it to the fantastic chorus. Then Amory opened his\r\n      eyes, half afraid that sight would spoil the rich illusion of\r\n      harmony.\r\n\r\n      He sighed eagerly. There at the head of the white platoon marched\r\n      Allenby, the football captain, slim and defiant, as if aware that\r\n      this year the hopes of the college rested on him, that his\r\n      hundred-and-sixty pounds were expected to dodge to victory\r\n      through the heavy blue and crimson lines.\r\n\r\n      Fascinated, Amory watched each rank of linked arms as it came\r\n      abreast, the faces indistinct above the polo shirts, the voices\r\n      blent in a paean of triumph\xe2\x80\x94and then the procession passed\r\n      through shadowy Campbell Arch, and the voices grew fainter as it\r\n      wound eastward over the campus.\r\n\r\n      The minutes passed and Amory sat there very quietly. He regretted\r\n      the rule that would forbid freshmen to be outdoors after curfew,\r\n      for he wanted to ramble through the shadowy scented lanes, where\r\n      Witherspoon brooded like a dark mother over Whig and Clio, her\r\n      Attic children, where the black Gothic snake of Little curled\r\n      down to Cuyler and Patton, these in turn flinging the mystery out\r\n      over the placid slope rolling to the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Princeton of the daytime filtered slowly into his\r\n      consciousness\xe2\x80\x94West and Reunion, redolent of the sixties,\r\n      Seventy-nine Hall, brick-red and arrogant, Upper and Lower Pyne,\r\n      aristocratic Elizabethan ladies not quite content to live among\r\n      shopkeepers, and, topping all, climbing with clear blue\r\n      aspiration, the great dreaming spires of Holder and Cleveland\r\n      towers.\r\n\r\n      From the first he loved Princeton\xe2\x80\x94its lazy beauty, its\r\n      half-grasped significance, the wild moonlight revel of the\r\n      rushes, the handsome, prosperous big-game crowds, and under it\r\n      all the air of struggle that pervaded his class. From the day\r\n      when, wild-eyed and exhausted, the jerseyed freshmen sat in the\r\n      gymnasium and elected some one from Hill School class president,\r\n      a Lawrenceville celebrity vice-president, a hockey star from St.\r\n      Paul\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, up until the end of sophomore year it never\r\n      ceased, that breathless social system, that worship, seldom\r\n      named, never really admitted, of the bogey \xe2\x80\x9cBig Man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      First it was schools, and Amory, alone from St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99, watched\r\n      the crowds form and widen and form again; St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s, Hill,\r\n      Pomfret, eating at certain tacitly reserved tables in Commons,\r\n      dressing in their own corners of the gymnasium, and drawing\r\n      unconsciously about them a barrier of the slightly less important\r\n      but socially ambitious to protect them from the friendly, rather\r\n      puzzled high-school element. From the moment he realized this\r\n      Amory resented social barriers as artificial distinctions made by\r\n      the strong to bolster up their weak retainers and keep out the\r\n      almost strong.\r\n\r\n      Having decided to be one of the gods of the class, he reported\r\n      for freshman football practice, but in the second week, playing\r\n      quarter-back, already paragraphed in corners of the Princetonian,\r\n      he wrenched his knee seriously enough to put him out for the rest\r\n      of the season. This forced him to retire and consider the\r\n      situation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c12 Univee\xe2\x80\x9d housed a dozen miscellaneous question-marks. There\r\n      were three or four inconspicuous and quite startled boys from\r\n      Lawrenceville, two amateur wild men from a New York private\r\n      school (Kerry Holiday christened them the \xe2\x80\x9cplebeian drunks\xe2\x80\x9d), a\r\n      Jewish youth, also from New York, and, as compensation for Amory,\r\n      the two Holidays, to whom he took an instant fancy.\r\n\r\n      The Holidays were rumored twins, but really the dark-haired one,\r\n      Kerry, was a year older than his blond brother, Burne. Kerry was\r\n      tall, with humorous gray eyes, and a sudden, attractive smile; he\r\n      became at once the mentor of the house, reaper of ears that grew\r\n      too high, censor of conceit, vendor of rare, satirical humor.\r\n      Amory spread the table of their future friendship with all his\r\n      ideas of what college should and did mean. Kerry, not inclined as\r\n      yet to take things seriously, chided him gently for being curious\r\n      at this inopportune time about the intricacies of the social\r\n      system, but liked him and was both interested and amused.\r\n\r\n      Burne, fair-haired, silent, and intent, appeared in the house\r\n      only as a busy apparition, gliding in quietly at night and off\r\n      again in the early morning to get up his work in the library\xe2\x80\x94he\r\n      was out for the Princetonian, competing furiously against forty\r\n      others for the coveted first place. In December he came down with\r\n      diphtheria, and some one else won the competition, but, returning\r\n      to college in February, he dauntlessly went after the prize\r\n      again. Necessarily, Amory\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with him was in the way\r\n      of three-minute chats, walking to and from lectures, so he failed\r\n      to penetrate Burne\xe2\x80\x99s one absorbing interest and find what lay\r\n      beneath it.\r\n\r\n      Amory was far from contented. He missed the place he had won at\r\n      St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99, the being known and admired, yet Princeton stimulated\r\n      him, and there were many things ahead calculated to arouse the\r\n      Machiavelli latent in him, could he but insert a wedge. The\r\n      upper-class clubs, concerning which he had pumped a reluctant\r\n      graduate during the previous summer, excited his curiosity: Ivy,\r\n      detached and breathlessly aristocratic; Cottage, an impressive\r\n      m\xc3\xa9lange of brilliant adventurers and well-dressed philanderers;\r\n      Tiger Inn, broad-shouldered and athletic, vitalized by an honest\r\n      elaboration of prep-school standards; Cap and Gown,\r\n      anti-alcoholic, faintly religious and politically powerful;\r\n      flamboyant Colonial; literary Quadrangle; and the dozen others,\r\n      varying in age and position.\r\n\r\n      Anything which brought an under classman into too glaring a light\r\n      was labelled with the damning brand of \xe2\x80\x9crunning it out.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\n      movies thrived on caustic comments, but the men who made them\r\n      were generally running it out; talking of clubs was running it\r\n      out; standing for anything very strongly, as, for instance,\r\n      drinking parties or teetotalling, was running it out; in short,\r\n      being personally conspicuous was not tolerated, and the\r\n      influential man was the non-committal man, until at club\r\n      elections in sophomore year every one should be sewed up in some\r\n      bag for the rest of his college career.\r\n\r\n      Amory found that writing for the Nassau Literary Magazine would\r\n      get him nothing, but that being on the board of the Daily\r\n      Princetonian would get any one a good deal. His vague desire to\r\n      do immortal acting with the English Dramatic Association faded\r\n      out when he found that the most ingenious brains and talents were\r\n      concentrated upon the Triangle Club, a musical comedy\r\n      organization that every year took a great Christmas trip. In the\r\n      meanwhile, feeling strangely alone and restless in Commons, with\r\n      new desires and ambitions stirring in his mind, he let the first\r\n      term go by between an envy of the embryo successes and a puzzled\r\n      fretting with Kerry as to why they were not accepted immediately\r\n      among the elite of the class.\r\n\r\n      Many afternoons they lounged in the windows of 12 Univee and\r\n      watched the class pass to and from Commons, noting satellites\r\n      already attaching themselves to the more prominent, watching the\r\n      lonely grind with his hurried step and downcast eye, envying the\r\n      happy security of the big school groups.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re the damned middle class, that\xe2\x80\x99s what!\xe2\x80\x9d he complained to\r\n      Kerry one day as he lay stretched out on the sofa, consuming a\r\n      family of Fatimas with contemplative precision.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why not? We came to Princeton so we could feel that way\r\n      toward the small colleges\xe2\x80\x94have it on \xe2\x80\x99em, more self-confidence,\r\n      dress better, cut a swathe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that I mind the glittering caste system,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted\r\n      Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cI like having a bunch of hot cats on top, but gosh,\r\n      Kerry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut just now, Amory, you\xe2\x80\x99re only a sweaty bourgeois.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory lay for a moment without speaking.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be\xe2\x80\x94long,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I hate to get anywhere\r\n      by working for it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show the marks, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHonorable scars.\xe2\x80\x9d Kerry craned his neck suddenly at the street.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Langueduc, if you want to see what he looks like\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      Humbird just behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory rose dynamically and sought the windows.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, scrutinizing these worthies, \xe2\x80\x9cHumbird looks like a\r\n      knock-out, but this Langueduc\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s the rugged type, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he? I\r\n      distrust that sort. All diamonds look big in the rough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kerry, as the excitement subsided, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\n      literary genius. It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Amory paused\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif I could be. I honestly think so\r\n      sometimes. That sounds like the devil, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it to\r\n      anybody except you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94go ahead. Let your hair grow and write poems like this guy\r\n      D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers in the Lit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory reached lazily at a pile of magazines on the table.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRead his latest effort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNever miss \xe2\x80\x99em. They\xe2\x80\x99re rare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory glanced through the issue.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in surprise, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a freshman, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYeah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cListen to this! My God!\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A serving lady speaks: Black velvet trails its folds over the day,\r\n  White tapers, prisoned in their silver frames, Wave their thin flames\r\n  like shadows in the wind, Pia, Pompia, come\xe2\x80\x94come away\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what the devil does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pantry scene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Her toes are stiffened like a stork\xe2\x80\x99s in flight; She\xe2\x80\x99s laid upon\r\n  her bed, on the white sheets, Her hands pressed on her smooth bust\r\n  like a saint, Bella Cunizza, come into the light!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy gosh, Kerry, what in hell is it all about? I swear I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      get him at all, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a literary bird myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty tricky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kerry, \xe2\x80\x9conly you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to think of\r\n      hearses and stale milk when you read it. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t as pash as\r\n      some of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory tossed the magazine on the table.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI sure am up in the air. I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not a\r\n      regular fellow, yet I loathe anybody else that isn\xe2\x80\x99t. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      decide whether to cultivate my mind and be a great dramatist, or\r\n      to thumb my nose at the Golden Treasury and be a Princeton\r\n      slicker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy decide?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Kerry. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter drift, like me. I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\n      to sail into prominence on Burne\xe2\x80\x99s coat-tails.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t drift\xe2\x80\x94I want to be interested. I want to pull strings,\r\n      even for somebody else, or be Princetonian chairman or Triangle\r\n      president. I want to be admired, Kerry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re thinking too much about yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory sat up at this.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about you, too. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get out and mix\r\n      around the class right now, when it\xe2\x80\x99s fun to be a snob. I\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\n      to bring a sardine to the prom in June, for instance, but I\r\n      wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it unless I could be damn debonaire about\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x94introduce her to all the prize parlor-snakes, and the football\r\n      captain, and all that simple stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kerry impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re just going around in a\r\n      circle. If you want to be prominent, get out and try for\r\n      something; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, just take it easy.\xe2\x80\x9d He yawned. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\r\n      let\xe2\x80\x99s let the smoke drift off. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go down and watch football\r\n      practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      Amory gradually accepted this point of view, decided that next\r\n      fall would inaugurate his career, and relinquished himself to\r\n      watching Kerry extract joy from 12 Univee.\r\n\r\n      They filled the Jewish youth\xe2\x80\x99s bed with lemon pie; they put out\r\n      the gas all over the house every night by blowing into the jet in\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s room, to the bewilderment of Mrs. Twelve and the local\r\n      plumber; they set up the effects of the plebeian drunks\xe2\x80\x94pictures,\r\n      books, and furniture\xe2\x80\x94in the bathroom, to the confusion of the\r\n      pair, who hazily discovered the transposition on their return\r\n      from a Trenton spree; they were disappointed beyond measure when\r\n      the plebeian drunks decided to take it as a joke; they played\r\n      red-dog and twenty-one and jackpot from dinner to dawn, and on\r\n      the occasion of one man\xe2\x80\x99s birthday persuaded him to buy\r\n      sufficient champagne for a hilarious celebration. The donor of\r\n      the party having remained sober, Kerry and Amory accidentally\r\n      dropped him down two flights of stairs and called, shame-faced\r\n      and penitent, at the infirmary all the following week.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSay, who are all these women?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Kerry one day,\r\n      protesting at the size of Amory\xe2\x80\x99s mail. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking at the\r\n      postmarks lately\xe2\x80\x94Farmington and Dobbs and Westover and Dana\r\n      Hall\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory grinned.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll from the Twin Cities.\xe2\x80\x9d He named them off. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Marylyn\r\n      De Witt\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty, got a car of her own and that\xe2\x80\x99s damn\r\n      convenient; there\xe2\x80\x99s Sally Weatherby\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s getting too fat;\r\n      there\xe2\x80\x99s Myra St. Claire, she\xe2\x80\x99s an old flame, easy to kiss if you\r\n      like it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat line do you throw \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Kerry. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tried\r\n      everything, and the mad wags aren\xe2\x80\x99t even afraid of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the \xe2\x80\x98nice boy\xe2\x80\x99 type,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it. Mother always feels the girl is safe if she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      with me. Honestly, it\xe2\x80\x99s annoying. If I start to hold somebody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      hand, they laugh at me, and let me, just as if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t part of\r\n      them. As soon as I get hold of a hand they sort of disconnect it\r\n      from the rest of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSulk,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cTell \xe2\x80\x99em you\xe2\x80\x99re wild and have \xe2\x80\x99em\r\n      reform you\xe2\x80\x94go home furious\xe2\x80\x94come back in half an hour\xe2\x80\x94startle\r\n      \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Kerry shook his head.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo chance. I wrote a St. Timothy girl a really loving letter\r\n      last year. In one place I got rattled and said: \xe2\x80\x98My God, how I\r\n      love you!\xe2\x80\x99 She took a nail scissors, clipped out the \xe2\x80\x98My God\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n      showed the rest of the letter all over school. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work at\r\n      all. I\xe2\x80\x99m just \xe2\x80\x98good old Kerry\xe2\x80\x99 and all that rot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory smiled and tried to picture himself as \xe2\x80\x9cgood old Amory.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\n      failed completely.\r\n\r\n      February dripped snow and rain, the cyclonic freshman mid-years\r\n      passed, and life in 12 Univee continued interesting if not\r\n      purposeful. Once a day Amory indulged in a club sandwich,\r\n      cornflakes, and Julienne potatoes at \xe2\x80\x9cJoe\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d accompanied usually\r\n      by Kerry or Alec Connage. The latter was a quiet, rather aloof\r\n      slicker from Hotchkiss, who lived next door and shared the same\r\n      enforced singleness as Amory, due to the fact that his entire\r\n      class had gone to Yale. \xe2\x80\x9cJoe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d was unaesthetic and faintly\r\n      unsanitary, but a limitless charge account could be opened there,\r\n      a convenience that Amory appreciated. His father had been\r\n      experimenting with mining stocks and, in consequence, his\r\n      allowance, while liberal, was not at all what he had expected.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cJoe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d had the additional advantage of seclusion from curious\r\n      upper-class eyes, so at four each afternoon Amory, accompanied by\r\n      friend or book, went up to experiment with his digestion. One day\r\n      in March, finding that all the tables were occupied, he slipped\r\n      into a chair opposite a freshman who bent intently over a book at\r\n      the last table. They nodded briefly. For twenty minutes Amory sat\r\n      consuming bacon buns and reading \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Warren\xe2\x80\x99s Profession\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\n      had discovered Shaw quite by accident while browsing in the\r\n      library during mid-years); the other freshman, also intent on his\r\n      volume, meanwhile did away with a trio of chocolate malted milks.\r\n\r\n      By and by Amory\xe2\x80\x99s eyes wandered curiously to his fellow-luncher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      book. He spelled out the name and title upside down\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMarpessa,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      by Stephen Phillips. This meant nothing to him, his metrical\r\n      education having been confined to such Sunday classics as \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\n      into the Garden, Maude,\xe2\x80\x9d and what morsels of Shakespeare and\r\n      Milton had been recently forced upon him.\r\n\r\n      Moved to address his vis-a-vis, he simulated interest in his book\r\n      for a moment, and then exclaimed aloud as if involuntarily:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHa! Great stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The other freshman looked up and Amory registered artificial\r\n      embarrassment.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAre you referring to your bacon buns?\xe2\x80\x9d His cracked, kindly voice\r\n      went well with the large spectacles and the impression of a\r\n      voluminous keenness that he gave.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI was referring to Bernard Shaw.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\n      turned the book around in explanation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never read any Shaw. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always meant to.\xe2\x80\x9d The boy paused\r\n      and then continued: \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever read Stephen Phillips, or do\r\n      you like poetry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory affirmed eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never read much of\r\n      Phillips, though.\xe2\x80\x9d (He had never heard of any Phillips except the\r\n      late David Graham.)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty fair, I think. Of course he\xe2\x80\x99s a Victorian.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\n      sallied into a discussion of poetry, in the course of which they\r\n      introduced themselves, and Amory\xe2\x80\x99s companion proved to be none\r\n      other than \xe2\x80\x9cthat awful highbrow, Thomas Parke D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers,\xe2\x80\x9d who\r\n      signed the passionate love-poems in the Lit. He was, perhaps,\r\n      nineteen, with stooped shoulders, pale blue eyes, and, as Amory\r\n      could tell from his general appearance, without much conception\r\n      of social competition and such phenomena of absorbing interest.\r\n      Still, he liked books, and it seemed forever since Amory had met\r\n      any one who did; if only that St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s crowd at the next table\r\n      would not mistake _him_ for a bird, too, he would enjoy the\r\n      encounter tremendously. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be noticing, so he\r\n      let himself go, discussed books by the dozens\xe2\x80\x94books he had read,\r\n      read about, books he had never heard of, rattling off lists of\r\n      titles with the facility of a Brentano\xe2\x80\x99s clerk. D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers was\r\n      partially taken in and wholly delighted. In a good-natured way he\r\n      had almost decided that Princeton was one part deadly Philistines\r\n      and one part deadly grinds, and to find a person who could\r\n      mention Keats without stammering, yet evidently washed his hands,\r\n      was rather a treat.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEver read any Oscar Wilde?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Who wrote it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a man\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, surely.\xe2\x80\x9d A faint chord was struck in Amory\xe2\x80\x99s memory. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      the comic opera, \xe2\x80\x98Patience,\xe2\x80\x99 written about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the fella. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just finished a book of his, \xe2\x80\x98The\r\n      Picture of Dorian Gray,\xe2\x80\x99 and I certainly wish you\xe2\x80\x99d read it.\r\n      You\xe2\x80\x99d like it. You can borrow it if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99d like it a lot\xe2\x80\x94thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to come up to the room? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few other\r\n      books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory hesitated, glanced at the St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s group\xe2\x80\x94one of them was\r\n      the magnificent, exquisite Humbird\xe2\x80\x94and he considered how\r\n      determinate the addition of this friend would be. He never got to\r\n      the stage of making them and getting rid of them\xe2\x80\x94he was not hard\r\n      enough for that\xe2\x80\x94so he measured Thomas Parke D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      undoubted attractions and value against the menace of cold eyes\r\n      behind tortoise-rimmed spectacles that he fancied glared from the\r\n      next table.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      So he found \xe2\x80\x9cDorian Gray\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cMystic and Somber Dolores\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n      the \xe2\x80\x9cBelle Dame sans Merci\xe2\x80\x9d; for a month was keen on naught else.\r\n      The world became pale and interesting, and he tried hard to look\r\n      at Princeton through the satiated eyes of Oscar Wilde and\r\n      Swinburne\xe2\x80\x94or \xe2\x80\x9cFingal O\xe2\x80\x99Flaherty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAlgernon Charles,\xe2\x80\x9d as he\r\n      called them in precieuse jest. He read enormously every\r\n      night\xe2\x80\x94Shaw, Chesterton, Barrie, Pinero, Yeats, Synge, Ernest\r\n      Dowson, Arthur Symons, Keats, Sudermann, Robert Hugh Benson, the\r\n      Savoy Operas\xe2\x80\x94just a heterogeneous mixture, for he suddenly\r\n      discovered that he had read nothing for years.\r\n\r\n      Tom D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers became at first an occasion rather than a\r\n      friend. Amory saw him about once a week, and together they gilded\r\n      the ceiling of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s room and decorated the walls with imitation\r\n      tapestry, bought at an auction, tall candlesticks and figured\r\n      curtains. Amory liked him for being clever and literary without\r\n      effeminacy or affectation. In fact, Amory did most of the\r\n      strutting and tried painfully to make every remark an epigram,\r\n      than which, if one is content with ostensible epigrams, there are\r\n      many feats harder. 12 Univee was amused. Kerry read \xe2\x80\x9cDorian Gray\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      and simulated Lord Henry, following Amory about, addressing him\r\n      as \xe2\x80\x9cDorian\xe2\x80\x9d and pretending to encourage in him wicked fancies and\r\n      attenuated tendencies to ennui. When he carried it into Commons,\r\n      to the amazement of the others at table, Amory became furiously\r\n      embarrassed, and after that made epigrams only before\r\n      D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers or a convenient mirror.\r\n\r\n      One day Tom and Amory tried reciting their own and Lord Dunsany\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      poems to the music of Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s graphophone.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cChant!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t recite! Chant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory, who was performing, looked annoyed, and claimed that he\r\n      needed a record with less piano in it. Kerry thereupon rolled on\r\n      the floor in stifled laughter.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPut on \xe2\x80\x98Hearts and Flowers\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d he howled. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Lord, I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\n      to cast a kitten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cShut off the damn graphophone,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory cried, rather red in the\r\n      face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not giving an exhibition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      In the meanwhile Amory delicately kept trying to awaken a sense\r\n      of the social system in D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers, for he knew that this poet\r\n      was really more conventional than he, and needed merely watered\r\n      hair, a smaller range of conversation, and a darker brown hat to\r\n      become quite regular. But the liturgy of Livingstone collars and\r\n      dark ties fell on heedless ears; in fact D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers faintly\r\n      resented his efforts; so Amory confined himself to calls once a\r\n      week, and brought him occasionally to 12 Univee. This caused mild\r\n      titters among the other freshmen, who called them \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Johnson\r\n      and Boswell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Alec Connage, another frequent visitor, liked him in a vague way,\r\n      but was afraid of him as a highbrow. Kerry, who saw through his\r\n      poetic patter to the solid, almost respectable depths within, was\r\n      immensely amused and would have him recite poetry by the hour,\r\n      while he lay with closed eyes on Amory\xe2\x80\x99s sofa and listened:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cAsleep or waking is it? for her neck Kissed over close, wears yet a\r\n   purple speck Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out; Soft and\r\n   stung softly\xe2\x80\x94fairer for a fleck...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerry would say softly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt pleases the elder\r\n      Holiday. That\xe2\x80\x99s a great poet, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d Tom, delighted at an\r\n      audience, would ramble through the \xe2\x80\x9cPoems and Ballades\xe2\x80\x9d until\r\n      Kerry and Amory knew them almost as well as he.\r\n\r\n      Amory took to writing poetry on spring afternoons, in the gardens\r\n      of the big estates near Princeton, while swans made effective\r\n      atmosphere in the artificial pools, and slow clouds sailed\r\n      harmoniously above the willows. May came too soon, and suddenly\r\n      unable to bear walls, he wandered the campus at all hours through\r\n      starlight and rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n      A DAMP SYMBOLIC INTERLUDE\r\n\r\n      The night mist fell. From the moon it rolled, clustered about the\r\n      spires and towers, and then settled below them, so that the\r\n      dreaming peaks were still in lofty aspiration toward the sky.\r\n      Figures that dotted the day like ants now brushed along as\r\n      shadowy ghosts, in and out of the foreground. The Gothic halls\r\n      and cloisters were infinitely more mysterious as they loomed\r\n      suddenly out of the darkness, outlined each by myriad faint\r\n      squares of yellow light. Indefinitely from somewhere a bell\r\n      boomed the quarter-hour, and Amory, pausing by the sun-dial,\r\n      stretched himself out full length on the damp grass. The cool\r\n      bathed his eyes and slowed the flight of time\xe2\x80\x94time that had crept\r\n      so insidiously through the lazy April afternoons, seemed so\r\n      intangible in the long spring twilights. Evening after evening\r\n      the senior singing had drifted over the campus in melancholy\r\n      beauty, and through the shell of his undergraduate consciousness\r\n      had broken a deep and reverent devotion to the gray walls and\r\n      Gothic peaks and all they symbolized as warehouses of dead ages.\r\n\r\n      The tower that in view of his window sprang upward, grew into a\r\n      spire, yearning higher until its uppermost tip was half invisible\r\n      against the morning skies, gave him the first sense of the\r\n      transiency and unimportance of the campus figures except as\r\n      holders of the apostolic succession. He liked knowing that Gothic\r\n      architecture, with its upward trend, was peculiarly appropriate\r\n      to universities, and the idea became personal to him. The silent\r\n      stretches of green, the quiet halls with an occasional\r\n      late-burning scholastic light held his imagination in a strong\r\n      grasp, and the chastity of the spire became a symbol of this\r\n      perception.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDamn it all,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered aloud, wetting his hands in the damp\r\n      and running them through his hair. \xe2\x80\x9cNext year I work!\xe2\x80\x9d Yet he\r\n      knew that where now the spirit of spires and towers made him\r\n      dreamily acquiescent, it would then overawe him. Where now he\r\n      realized only his own inconsequence, effort would make him aware\r\n      of his own impotency and insufficiency.\r\n\r\n      The college dreamed on\xe2\x80\x94awake. He felt a nervous excitement that\r\n      might have been the very throb of its slow heart. It was a stream\r\n      where he was to throw a stone whose faint ripple would be\r\n      vanishing almost as it left his hand. As yet he had given\r\n      nothing, he had taken nothing.\r\n\r\n      A belated freshman, his oilskin slicker rasping loudly, slushed\r\n      along the soft path. A voice from somewhere called the inevitable\r\n      formula, \xe2\x80\x9cStick out your head!\xe2\x80\x9d below an unseen window. A hundred\r\n      little sounds of the current drifting on under the fog pressed in\r\n      finally on his consciousness.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, God!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried suddenly, and started at the sound of his\r\n      voice in the stillness. The rain dripped on. A minute longer he\r\n      lay without moving, his hands clinched. Then he sprang to his\r\n      feet and gave his clothes a tentative pat.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very damn wet!\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud to the sun-dial.\r\n\r\n\r\n      HISTORICAL\r\n\r\n      The war began in the summer following his freshman year. Beyond a\r\n      sporting interest in the German dash for Paris the whole affair\r\n      failed either to thrill or interest him. With the attitude he\r\n      might have held toward an amusing melodrama he hoped it would be\r\n      long and bloody. If it had not continued he would have felt like\r\n      an irate ticket-holder at a prize-fight where the principals\r\n      refused to mix it up.\r\n\r\n      That was his total reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHA-HA HORTENSE!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, ponies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cShake it up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHey, ponies\xe2\x80\x94how about easing up on that crap game and shaking a\r\n      mean hip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHey, _ponies!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The coach fumed helplessly, the Triangle Club president,\r\n      glowering with anxiety, varied between furious bursts of\r\n      authority and fits of temperamental lassitude, when he sat\r\n      spiritless and wondered how the devil the show was ever going on\r\n      tour by Christmas.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll right. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take the pirate song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The ponies took last drags at their cigarettes and slumped into\r\n      place; the leading lady rushed into the foreground, setting his\r\n      hands and feet in an atmospheric mince; and as the coach clapped\r\n      and stamped and tumped and da-da\xe2\x80\x99d, they hashed out a dance.\r\n\r\n      A great, seething ant-hill was the Triangle Club. It gave a\r\n      musical comedy every year, travelling with cast, chorus,\r\n      orchestra, and scenery all through Christmas vacation. The play\r\n      and music were the work of undergraduates, and the club itself\r\n      was the most influential of institutions, over three hundred men\r\n      competing for it every year.\r\n\r\n      Amory, after an easy victory in the first sophomore Princetonian\r\n      competition, stepped into a vacancy of the cast as Boiling Oil, a\r\n      Pirate Lieutenant. Every night for the last week they had\r\n      rehearsed \xe2\x80\x9cHa-Ha Hortense!\xe2\x80\x9d in the Casino, from two in the\r\n      afternoon until eight in the morning, sustained by dark and\r\n      powerful coffee, and sleeping in lectures through the interim. A\r\n      rare scene, the Casino. A big, barnlike auditorium, dotted with\r\n      boys as girls, boys as pirates, boys as babies; the scenery in\r\n      course of being violently set up; the spotlight man rehearsing by\r\n      throwing weird shafts into angry eyes; over all the constant\r\n      tuning of the orchestra or the cheerful tumpty-tump of a Triangle\r\n      tune. The boy who writes the lyrics stands in the corner, biting\r\n      a pencil, with twenty minutes to think of an encore; the business\r\n      manager argues with the secretary as to how much money can be\r\n      spent on \xe2\x80\x9cthose damn milkmaid costumes\xe2\x80\x9d; the old graduate,\r\n      president in ninety-eight, perches on a box and thinks how much\r\n      simpler it was in his day.\r\n\r\n      How a Triangle show ever got off was a mystery, but it was a\r\n      riotous mystery, anyway, whether or not one did enough service to\r\n      wear a little gold Triangle on his watch-chain. \xe2\x80\x9cHa-Ha Hortense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      was written over six times and had the names of nine\r\n      collaborators on the programme. All Triangle shows started by\r\n      being \xe2\x80\x9csomething different\xe2\x80\x94not just a regular musical comedy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      but when the several authors, the president, the coach and the\r\n      faculty committee finished with it, there remained just the old\r\n      reliable Triangle show with the old reliable jokes and the star\r\n      comedian who got expelled or sick or something just before the\r\n      trip, and the dark-whiskered man in the pony-ballet, who\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely won\xe2\x80\x99t shave twice a day, doggone it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      There was one brilliant place in \xe2\x80\x9cHa-Ha Hortense!\xe2\x80\x9d It is a\r\n      Princeton tradition that whenever a Yale man who is a member of\r\n      the widely advertised \xe2\x80\x9cSkull and Bones\xe2\x80\x9d hears the sacred name\r\n      mentioned, he must leave the room. It is also a tradition that\r\n      the members are invariably successful in later life, amassing\r\n      fortunes or votes or coupons or whatever they choose to amass.\r\n      Therefore, at each performance of \xe2\x80\x9cHa-Ha Hortense!\xe2\x80\x9d half-a-dozen\r\n      seats were kept from sale and occupied by six of the\r\n      worst-looking vagabonds that could be hired from the streets,\r\n      further touched up by the Triangle make-up man. At the moment in\r\n      the show where Firebrand, the Pirate Chief, pointed at his black\r\n      flag and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a Yale graduate\xe2\x80\x94note my Skull and Bones!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94at\r\n      this very moment the six vagabonds were instructed to rise\r\n      _conspicuously_ and leave the theatre with looks of deep\r\n      melancholy and an injured dignity. It was claimed though never\r\n      proved that on one occasion the hired Elis were swelled by one of\r\n      the real thing.\r\n\r\n      They played through vacation to the fashionable of eight cities.\r\n      Amory liked Louisville and Memphis best: these knew how to meet\r\n      strangers, furnished extraordinary punch, and flaunted an\r\n      astonishing array of feminine beauty. Chicago he approved for a\r\n      certain verve that transcended its loud accent\xe2\x80\x94however, it was a\r\n      Yale town, and as the Yale Glee Club was expected in a week the\r\n      Triangle received only divided homage. In Baltimore, Princeton\r\n      was at home, and every one fell in love. There was a proper\r\n      consumption of strong waters all along the line; one man\r\n      invariably went on the stage highly stimulated, claiming that his\r\n      particular interpretation of the part required it. There were\r\n      three private cars; however, no one slept except in the third\r\n      car, which was called the \xe2\x80\x9canimal car,\xe2\x80\x9d and where were herded the\r\n      spectacled wind-jammers of the orchestra. Everything was so\r\n      hurried that there was no time to be bored, but when they arrived\r\n      in Philadelphia, with vacation nearly over, there was rest in\r\n      getting out of the heavy atmosphere of flowers and grease-paint,\r\n      and the ponies took off their corsets with abdominal pains and\r\n      sighs of relief.\r\n\r\n      When the disbanding came, Amory set out post haste for\r\n      Minneapolis, for Sally Weatherby\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, Isabelle Borge, was\r\n      coming to spend the winter in Minneapolis while her parents went\r\n      abroad. He remembered Isabelle only as a little girl with whom he\r\n      had played sometimes when he first went to Minneapolis. She had\r\n      gone to Baltimore to live\xe2\x80\x94but since then she had developed a\r\n      past.\r\n\r\n      Amory was in full stride, confident, nervous, and jubilant.\r\n      Scurrying back to Minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a\r\n      child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do, so without\r\n      compunction he wired his mother not to expect him... sat in the\r\n      train, and thought about himself for thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPETTING\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      On the Triangle trip Amory had come into constant contact with\r\n      that great current American phenomenon, the \xe2\x80\x9cpetting party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      None of the Victorian mothers\xe2\x80\x94and most of the mothers were\r\n      Victorian\xe2\x80\x94had any idea how casually their daughters were\r\n      accustomed to be kissed. \xe2\x80\x9cServant-girls are that way,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs.\r\n      Huston-Carmelite to her popular daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are kissed first\r\n      and proposed to afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      But the Popular Daughter becomes engaged every six months between\r\n      sixteen and twenty-two, when she arranges a match with young\r\n      Hambell, of Cambell & Hambell, who fatuously considers himself\r\n      her first love, and between engagements the P. D. (she is\r\n      selected by the cut-in system at dances, which favors the\r\n      survival of the fittest) has other sentimental last kisses in the\r\n      moonlight, or the firelight, or the outer darkness.\r\n\r\n      Amory saw girls doing things that even in his memory would have\r\n      been impossible: eating three-o\xe2\x80\x99clock, after-dance suppers in\r\n      impossible cafes, talking of every side of life with an air half\r\n      of earnestness, half of mockery, yet with a furtive excitement\r\n      that Amory considered stood for a real moral let-down. But he\r\n      never realized how wide-spread it was until he saw the cities\r\n      between New York and Chicago as one vast juvenile intrigue.\r\n\r\n      Afternoon at the Plaza, with winter twilight hovering outside and\r\n      faint drums down-stairs... they strut and fret in the lobby,\r\n      taking another cocktail, scrupulously attired and waiting. Then\r\n      the swinging doors revolve and three bundles of fur mince in. The\r\n      theatre comes afterward; then a table at the Midnight Frolic\xe2\x80\x94of\r\n      course, mother will be along there, but she will serve only to\r\n      make things more secretive and brilliant as she sits in solitary\r\n      state at the deserted table and thinks such entertainments as\r\n      this are not half so bad as they are painted, only rather\r\n      wearying. But the P. D. is in love again... it was odd, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      it?\xe2\x80\x94that though there was so much room left in the taxi the P. D.\r\n      and the boy from Williams were somehow crowded out and had to go\r\n      in a separate car. Odd! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you notice how flushed the P. D.\r\n      was when she arrived just seven minutes late? But the P. D. \xe2\x80\x9cgets\r\n      away with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The \xe2\x80\x9cbelle\xe2\x80\x9d had become the \xe2\x80\x9cflirt,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cflirt\xe2\x80\x9d had become the\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cbaby vamp.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cbelle\xe2\x80\x9d had five or six callers every afternoon.\r\n      If the P. D., by some strange accident, has two, it is made\r\n      pretty uncomfortable for the one who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a date with her. The\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cbelle\xe2\x80\x9d was surrounded by a dozen men in the intermissions\r\n      between dances. Try to find the P. D. between dances, just _try_\r\n      to find her.\r\n\r\n      The same girl... deep in an atmosphere of jungle music and the\r\n      questioning of moral codes. Amory found it rather fascinating to\r\n      feel that any popular girl he met before eight he might quite\r\n      possibly kiss before twelve.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth are we here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the girl with the green\r\n      combs one night as they sat in some one\xe2\x80\x99s limousine, outside the\r\n      Country Club in Louisville.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m just full of the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s be frank\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll never see each other again. I wanted to\r\n      come out here with you because I thought you were the\r\n      best-looking girl in sight. You really don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether you\r\n      ever see me again, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94but is this your line for every girl? What have I done to\r\n      deserve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel tired dancing or want a cigarette or any of\r\n      the things you said? You just wanted to be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s go in,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cif you want to _analyze_.\r\n      Let\xe2\x80\x99s not _talk_ about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      When the hand-knit, sleeveless jerseys were stylish, Amory, in a\r\n      burst of inspiration, named them \xe2\x80\x9cpetting shirts.\xe2\x80\x9d The name\r\n      travelled from coast to coast on the lips of parlor-snakes and P.\r\n      D.\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTIVE\r\n\r\n      Amory was now eighteen years old, just under six feet tall and\r\n      exceptionally, but not conventionally, handsome. He had rather a\r\n      young face, the ingenuousness of which was marred by the\r\n      penetrating green eyes, fringed with long dark eyelashes. He\r\n      lacked somehow that intense animal magnetism that so often\r\n      accompanies beauty in men or women; his personality seemed rather\r\n      a mental thing, and it was not in his power to turn it on and off\r\n      like a water-faucet. But people never forgot his face.\r\n\r\n\r\n      ISABELLE\r\n\r\n      She paused at the top of the staircase. The sensations attributed\r\n      to divers on spring-boards, leading ladies on opening nights, and\r\n      lumpy, husky young men on the day of the Big Game, crowded\r\n      through her. She should have descended to a burst of drums or a\r\n      discordant blend of themes from \xe2\x80\x9cThais\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCarmen.\xe2\x80\x9d She had\r\n      never been so curious about her appearance, she had never been so\r\n      satisfied with it. She had been sixteen years old for six months.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsabelle!\xe2\x80\x9d called her cousin Sally from the doorway of the\r\n      dressing-room.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\xe2\x80\x9d She caught a slight lump of nervousness in her\r\n      throat.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI had to send back to the house for another pair of slippers.\r\n      It\xe2\x80\x99ll be just a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Isabelle started toward the dressing-room for a last peek in the\r\n      mirror, but something decided her to stand there and gaze down\r\n      the broad stairs of the Minnehaha Club. They curved\r\n      tantalizingly, and she could catch just a glimpse of two pairs of\r\n      masculine feet in the hall below. Pump-shod in uniform black,\r\n      they gave no hint of identity, but she wondered eagerly if one\r\n      pair were attached to Amory Blaine. This young man, not as yet\r\n      encountered, had nevertheless taken up a considerable part of her\r\n      day\xe2\x80\x94the first day of her arrival. Coming up in the machine from\r\n      the station, Sally had volunteered, amid a rain of question,\r\n      comment, revelation, and exaggeration:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember Amory Blaine, of _course_. Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s simply mad to\r\n      see you again. He\xe2\x80\x99s stayed over a day from college, and he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      coming to-night. He\xe2\x80\x99s heard so much about you\xe2\x80\x94says he remembers\r\n      your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      This had pleased Isabelle. It put them on equal terms, although\r\n      she was quite capable of staging her own romances, with or\r\n      without advance advertising. But following her happy tremble of\r\n      anticipation, came a sinking sensation that made her ask:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean he\xe2\x80\x99s heard about me? What sort of things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Sally smiled. She felt rather in the capacity of a showman with\r\n      her more exotic cousin.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows you\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re considered beautiful and all that\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she\r\n      paused\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I guess he knows you\xe2\x80\x99ve been kissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      At this Isabelle\xe2\x80\x99s little fist had clinched suddenly under the\r\n      fur robe. She was accustomed to be thus followed by her desperate\r\n      past, and it never failed to rouse in her the same feeling of\r\n      resentment; yet\xe2\x80\x94in a strange town it was an advantageous\r\n      reputation. She was a \xe2\x80\x9cSpeed,\xe2\x80\x9d was she? Well\xe2\x80\x94let them find out.\r\n\r\n      Out of the window Isabelle watched the snow glide by in the\r\n      frosty morning. It was ever so much colder here than in\r\n      Baltimore; she had not remembered; the glass of the side door was\r\n      iced, the windows were shirred with snow in the corners. Her mind\r\n      played still with one subject. Did _he_ dress like that boy\r\n      there, who walked calmly down a bustling business street, in\r\n      moccasins and winter-carnival costume? How very _Western!_ Of\r\n      course he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that way: he went to Princeton, was a sophomore\r\n      or something. Really she had no distinct idea of him. An ancient\r\n      snap-shot she had preserved in an old kodak book had impressed\r\n      her by the big eyes (which he had probably grown up to by now).\r\n      However, in the last month, when her winter visit to Sally had\r\n      been decided on, he had assumed the proportions of a worthy\r\n      adversary. Children, most astute of match-makers, plot their\r\n      campaigns quickly, and Sally had played a clever correspondence\r\n      sonata to Isabelle\xe2\x80\x99s excitable temperament. Isabelle had been for\r\n      some time capable of very strong, if very transient emotions....\r\n\r\n      They drew up at a spreading, white-stone building, set back from\r\n      the snowy street. Mrs. Weatherby greeted her warmly and her\r\n      various younger cousins were produced from the corners where they\r\n      skulked politely. Isabelle met them tactfully. At her best she\r\n      allied all with whom she came in contact\xe2\x80\x94except older girls and\r\n      some women. All the impressions she made were conscious. The\r\n      half-dozen girls she renewed acquaintance with that morning were\r\n      all rather impressed and as much by her direct personality as by\r\n      her reputation. Amory Blaine was an open subject. Evidently a bit\r\n      light of love, neither popular nor unpopular\xe2\x80\x94every girl there\r\n      seemed to have had an affair with him at some time or other, but\r\n      no one volunteered any really useful information. He was going to\r\n      fall for her.... Sally had published that information to her\r\n      young set and they were retailing it back to Sally as fast as\r\n      they set eyes on Isabelle. Isabelle resolved secretly that she\r\n      would, if necessary, _force_ herself to like him\xe2\x80\x94she owed it to\r\n      Sally. Suppose she were terribly disappointed. Sally had painted\r\n      him in such glowing colors\xe2\x80\x94he was good-looking, \xe2\x80\x9csort of\r\n      distinguished, when he wants to be,\xe2\x80\x9d had a line, and was properly\r\n      inconstant. In fact, he summed up all the romance that her age\r\n      and environment led her to desire. She wondered if those were his\r\n      dancing-shoes that fox-trotted tentatively around the soft rug\r\n      below.\r\n\r\n      All impressions and, in fact, all ideas were extremely\r\n      kaleidoscopic to Isabelle. She had that curious mixture of the\r\n      social and the artistic temperaments found often in two classes,\r\n      society women and actresses. Her education or, rather, her\r\n      sophistication, had been absorbed from the boys who had dangled\r\n      on her favor; her tact was instinctive, and her capacity for\r\n      love-affairs was limited only by the number of the susceptible\r\n      within telephone distance. Flirt smiled from her large\r\n      black-brown eyes and shone through her intense physical\r\n      magnetism.\r\n\r\n      So she waited at the head of the stairs that evening while\r\n      slippers were fetched. Just as she was growing impatient, Sally\r\n      came out of the dressing-room, beaming with her accustomed good\r\n      nature and high spirits, and together they descended to the floor\r\n      below, while the shifting search-light of Isabelle\xe2\x80\x99s mind flashed\r\n      on two ideas: she was glad she had high color to-night, and she\r\n      wondered if he danced well.\r\n\r\n      Down-stairs, in the club\xe2\x80\x99s great room, she was surrounded for a\r\n      moment by the girls she had met in the afternoon, then she heard\r\n      Sally\xe2\x80\x99s voice repeating a cycle of names, and found herself\r\n      bowing to a sextet of black and white, terribly stiff, vaguely\r\n      familiar figures. The name Blaine figured somewhere, but at first\r\n      she could not place him. A very confused, very juvenile moment of\r\n      awkward backings and bumpings followed, and every one found\r\n      himself talking to the person he least desired to. Isabelle\r\n      manoeuvred herself and Froggy Parker, freshman at Harvard, with\r\n      whom she had once played hop-scotch, to a seat on the stairs. A\r\n      humorous reference to the past was all she needed. The things\r\n      Isabelle could do socially with one idea were remarkable. First,\r\n      she repeated it rapturously in an enthusiastic contralto with a\r\n      soupcon of Southern accent; then she held it off at a distance\r\n      and smiled at it\xe2\x80\x94her wonderful smile; then she delivered it in\r\n      variations and played a sort of mental catch with it, all this in\r\n      the nominal form of dialogue. Froggy was fascinated and quite\r\n      unconscious that this was being done, not for him, but for the\r\n      green eyes that glistened under the shining carefully watered\r\n      hair, a little to her left, for Isabelle had discovered Amory. As\r\n      an actress even in the fullest flush of her own conscious\r\n      magnetism gets a deep impression of most of the people in the\r\n      front row, so Isabelle sized up her antagonist. First, he had\r\n      auburn hair, and from her feeling of disappointment she knew that\r\n      she had expected him to be dark and of garter-advertisement\r\n      slenderness.... For the rest, a faint flush and a straight,\r\n      romantic profile; the effect set off by a close-fitting dress\r\n      suit and a silk ruffled shirt of the kind that women still\r\n      delight to see men wear, but men were just beginning to get tired\r\n      of.\r\n\r\n      During this inspection Amory was quietly watching.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ think so?\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly, turning to him,\r\n      innocent-eyed.\r\n\r\n      There was a stir, and Sally led the way over to their table.\r\n      Amory struggled to Isabelle\xe2\x80\x99s side, and whispered:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re my dinner partner, you know. We\xe2\x80\x99re all coached for each\r\n      other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Isabelle gasped\xe2\x80\x94this was rather right in line. But really she\r\n      felt as if a good speech had been taken from the star and given\r\n      to a minor character.... She mustn\xe2\x80\x99t lose the leadership a bit.\r\n      The dinner-table glittered with laughter at the confusion of\r\n      getting places and then curious eyes were turned on her, sitting\r\n      near the head. She was enjoying this immensely, and Froggy Parker\r\n      was so engrossed with the added sparkle of her rising color that\r\n      he forgot to pull out Sally\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and fell into a dim\r\n      confusion. Amory was on the other side, full of confidence and\r\n      vanity, gazing at her in open admiration. He began directly, and\r\n      so did Froggy:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot about you since you wore braids\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it funny this afternoon\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Both stopped. Isabelle turned to Amory shyly. Her face was always\r\n      enough answer for any one, but she decided to speak.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94from whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFrom everybody\xe2\x80\x94for all the years since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been away.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\n      blushed appropriately. On her right Froggy was _hors de combat_\r\n      already, although he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t quite realized it.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I remembered about you all these years,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      Amory continued. She leaned slightly toward him and looked\r\n      modestly at the celery before her. Froggy sighed\xe2\x80\x94he knew Amory,\r\n      and the situations that Amory seemed born to handle. He turned to\r\n      Sally and asked her if she was going away to school next year.\r\n      Amory opened with grape-shot.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got an adjective that just fits you.\xe2\x80\x9d This was one of his\r\n      favorite starts\xe2\x80\x94he seldom had a word in mind, but it was a\r\n      curiosity provoker, and he could always produce something\r\n      complimentary if he got in a tight corner.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d Isabelle\xe2\x80\x99s face was a study in enraptured curiosity.\r\n\r\n      Amory shook his head.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you very well yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me\xe2\x80\x94afterward?\xe2\x80\x9d she half whispered.\r\n\r\n      He nodded.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll sit out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Isabelle nodded.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDid any one ever tell you, you have keen eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n      Amory attempted to make them look even keener. He fancied, but he\r\n      was not sure, that her foot had just touched his under the table.\r\n      But it might possibly have been only the table leg. It was so\r\n      hard to tell. Still it thrilled him. He wondered quickly if there\r\n      would be any difficulty in securing the little den up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BABES IN THE WOODS\r\n\r\n      Isabelle and Amory were distinctly not innocent, nor were they\r\n      particularly brazen. Moreover, amateur standing had very little\r\n      value in the game they were playing, a game that would presumably\r\n      be her principal study for years to come. She had begun as he\r\n      had, with good looks and an excitable temperament, and the rest\r\n      was the result of accessible popular novels and dressing-room\r\n      conversation culled from a slightly older set. Isabelle had\r\n      walked with an artificial gait at nine and a half, and when her\r\n      eyes, wide and starry, proclaimed the ingenue most. Amory was\r\n      proportionately less deceived. He waited for the mask to drop\r\n      off, but at the same time he did not question her right to wear\r\n      it. She, on her part, was not impressed by his studied air of\r\n      blas\xc3\xa9 sophistication. She had lived in a larger city and had\r\n      slightly an advantage in range. But she accepted his pose\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\n      one of the dozen little conventions of this kind of affair. He\r\n      was aware that he was getting this particular favor now because\r\n      she had been coached; he knew that he stood for merely the best\r\n      game in sight, and that he would have to improve his opportunity\r\n      before he lost his advantage. So they proceeded with an infinite\r\n      guile that would have horrified her parents.\r\n\r\n      After the dinner the dance began... smoothly. Smoothly?\xe2\x80\x94boys cut\r\n      in on Isabelle every few feet and then squabbled in the corners\r\n      with: \xe2\x80\x9cYou might let me get more than an inch!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      like it either\xe2\x80\x94she told me so next time I cut in.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\n      true\xe2\x80\x94she told every one so, and gave every hand a parting\r\n      pressure that said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that your dances are _making_ my\r\n      evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      But time passed, two hours of it, and the less subtle beaux had\r\n      better learned to focus their pseudo-passionate glances\r\n      elsewhere, for eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock found Isabelle and Amory sitting on\r\n      the couch in the little den off the reading-room up-stairs. She\r\n      was conscious that they were a handsome pair, and seemed to\r\n      belong distinctively in this seclusion, while lesser lights\r\n      fluttered and chattered down-stairs.\r\n\r\n      Boys who passed the door looked in enviously\xe2\x80\x94girls who passed\r\n      only laughed and frowned and grew wise within themselves.\r\n\r\n      They had now reached a very definite stage. They had traded\r\n      accounts of their progress since they had met last, and she had\r\n      listened to much she had heard before. He was a sophomore, was on\r\n      the Princetonian board, hoped to be chairman in senior year. He\r\n      learned that some of the boys she went with in Baltimore were\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cterrible speeds\xe2\x80\x9d and came to dances in states of artificial\r\n      stimulation; most of them were twenty or so, and drove alluring\r\n      red Stutzes. A good half seemed to have already flunked out of\r\n      various schools and colleges, but some of them bore athletic\r\n      names that made him look at her admiringly. As a matter of fact,\r\n      Isabelle\xe2\x80\x99s closer acquaintance with the universities was just\r\n      commencing. She had bowing acquaintance with a lot of young men\r\n      who thought she was a \xe2\x80\x9cpretty kid\xe2\x80\x94worth keeping an eye on.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\n      Isabelle strung the names into a fabrication of gayety that would\r\n      have dazzled a Viennese nobleman. Such is the power of young\r\n      contralto voices on sink-down sofas.\r\n\r\n      He asked her if she thought he was conceited. She said there was\r\n      a difference between conceit and self-confidence. She adored\r\n      self-confidence in men.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIs Froggy a good friend of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRather\xe2\x80\x94why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a bum dancer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory laughed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe dances as if the girl were on his back instead of in his\r\n      arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She appreciated this.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re awfully good at sizing people up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory denied this painfully. However, he sized up several people\r\n      for her. Then they talked about hands.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got awfully nice hands,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey look as if you\r\n      played the piano. Do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I have said they had reached a very definite stage\xe2\x80\x94nay, more, a\r\n      very critical stage. Amory had stayed over a day to see her, and\r\n      his train left at twelve-eighteen that night. His trunk and\r\n      suitcase awaited him at the station; his watch was beginning to\r\n      hang heavy in his pocket.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsabelle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      They had been talking lightly about \xe2\x80\x9cthat funny look in her\r\n      eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d and Isabelle knew from the change in his manner what was\r\n      coming\xe2\x80\x94indeed, she had been wondering how soon it would come.\r\n      Amory reached above their heads and turned out the electric\r\n      light, so that they were in the dark, except for the red glow\r\n      that fell through the door from the reading-room lamps. Then he\r\n      began:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not you know what you\xe2\x80\x94what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\n      say. Lordy, Isabelle\xe2\x80\x94this _sounds_ like a line, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isabelle softly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll never meet again like this\xe2\x80\x94I have darned hard luck\r\n      sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d He was leaning away from her on the other arm of the\r\n      lounge, but she could see his eyes plainly in the dark.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll meet me again\xe2\x80\x94silly.\xe2\x80\x9d There was just the slightest\r\n      emphasis on the last word\xe2\x80\x94so that it became almost a term of\r\n      endearment. He continued a bit huskily:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen for a lot of people\xe2\x80\x94girls\xe2\x80\x94and I guess you have,\r\n      too\xe2\x80\x94boys, I mean, but, honestly, you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off suddenly and\r\n      leaned forward, chin on his hands: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\n      your way and I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ll go mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Silence for a moment. Isabelle was quite stirred; she wound her\r\n      handkerchief into a tight ball, and by the faint light that\r\n      streamed over her, dropped it deliberately on the floor. Their\r\n      hands touched for an instant, but neither spoke. Silences were\r\n      becoming more frequent and more delicious. Outside another stray\r\n      couple had come up and were experimenting on the piano in the\r\n      next room. After the usual preliminary of \xe2\x80\x9cchopsticks,\xe2\x80\x9d one of\r\n      them started \xe2\x80\x9cBabes in the Woods\xe2\x80\x9d and a light tenor carried the\r\n      words into the den:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand I\xe2\x80\x99ll understand We\xe2\x80\x99re off to slumberland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Isabelle hummed it softly and trembled as she felt Amory\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\n      close over hers.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsabelle,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I\xe2\x80\x99m mad about you. You _do_\r\n      give a darn about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you care\xe2\x80\x94do you like any one better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d He could scarcely hear her, although he bent so near that\r\n      he felt her breath against his cheek.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsabelle, I\xe2\x80\x99m going back to college for six long months, and why\r\n      shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we\xe2\x80\x94if I could only just have one thing to remember you\r\n      by\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cClose the door....\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice had just stirred so that he half\r\n      wondered whether she had spoken at all. As he swung the door\r\n      softly shut, the music seemed quivering just outside.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cMoonlight is bright, Kiss me good night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      What a wonderful song, she thought\xe2\x80\x94everything was wonderful\r\n      to-night, most of all this romantic scene in the den, with their\r\n      hands clinging and the inevitable looming charmingly close. The\r\n      future vista of her life seemed an unending succession of scenes\r\n      like this: under moonlight and pale starlight, and in the backs\r\n      of warm limousines and in low, cosy roadsters stopped under\r\n      sheltering trees\xe2\x80\x94only the boy might change, and this one was so\r\n      nice. He took her hand softly. With a sudden movement he turned\r\n      it and, holding it to his lips, kissed the palm.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsabelle!\xe2\x80\x9d His whisper blended in the music, and they seemed to\r\n      float nearer together. Her breath came faster. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I kiss you,\r\n      Isabelle\xe2\x80\x94Isabelle?\xe2\x80\x9d Lips half parted, she turned her head to him\r\n      in the dark. Suddenly the ring of voices, the sound of running\r\n      footsteps surged toward them. Quick as a flash Amory reached up\r\n      and turned on the light, and when the door opened and three boys,\r\n      the wrathy and dance-craving Froggy among them, rushed in, he was\r\n      turning over the magazines on the table, while she sat without\r\n      moving, serene and unembarrassed, and even greeted them with a\r\n      welcoming smile. But her heart was beating wildly, and she felt\r\n      somehow as if she had been deprived.\r\n\r\n      It was evidently over. There was a clamor for a dance, there was\r\n      a glance that passed between them\xe2\x80\x94on his side despair, on hers\r\n      regret, and then the evening went on, with the reassured beaux\r\n      and the eternal cutting in.\r\n\r\n      At quarter to twelve Amory shook hands with her gravely, in the\r\n      midst of a small crowd assembled to wish him good-speed. For an\r\n      instant he lost his poise, and she felt a bit rattled when a\r\n      satirical voice from a concealed wit cried:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTake her outside, Amory!\xe2\x80\x9d As he took her hand he pressed it a\r\n      little, and she returned the pressure as she had done to twenty\r\n      hands that evening\xe2\x80\x94that was all.\r\n\r\n      At two o\xe2\x80\x99clock back at the Weatherbys\xe2\x80\x99 Sally asked her if she and\r\n      Amory had had a \xe2\x80\x9ctime\xe2\x80\x9d in the den. Isabelle turned to her\r\n      quietly. In her eyes was the light of the idealist, the inviolate\r\n      dreamer of Joan-like dreams.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t do that sort of thing any more; he\r\n      asked me to, but I said no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      As she crept in bed she wondered what he\xe2\x80\x99d say in his special\r\n      delivery to-morrow. He had such a good-looking mouth\xe2\x80\x94would she\r\n      ever\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFourteen angels were watching o\xe2\x80\x99er them,\xe2\x80\x9d sang Sally sleepily\r\n      from the next room.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Isabelle, punching the pillow into a luxurious\r\n      lump and exploring the cold sheets cautiously. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      CARNIVAL\r\n\r\n      Amory, by way of the Princetonian, had arrived. The minor snobs,\r\n      finely balanced thermometers of success, warmed to him as the\r\n      club elections grew nigh, and he and Tom were visited by groups\r\n      of upper classmen who arrived awkwardly, balanced on the edge of\r\n      the furniture and talked of all subjects except the one of\r\n      absorbing interest. Amory was amused at the intent eyes upon him,\r\n      and, in case the visitors represented some club in which he was\r\n      not interested, took great pleasure in shocking them with\r\n      unorthodox remarks.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, let me see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he said one night to a flabbergasted\r\n      delegation, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat club do you represent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      With visitors from Ivy and Cottage and Tiger Inn he played the\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cnice, unspoilt, ingenuous boy\xe2\x80\x9d very much at ease and quite\r\n      unaware of the object of the call.\r\n\r\n      When the fatal morning arrived, early in March, and the campus\r\n      became a document in hysteria, he slid smoothly into Cottage with\r\n      Alec Connage and watched his suddenly neurotic class with much\r\n      wonder.\r\n\r\n      There were fickle groups that jumped from club to club; there\r\n      were friends of two or three days who announced tearfully and\r\n      wildly that they must join the same club, nothing should separate\r\n      them; there were snarling disclosures of long-hidden grudges as\r\n      the Suddenly Prominent remembered snubs of freshman year. Unknown\r\n      men were elevated into importance when they received certain\r\n      coveted bids; others who were considered \xe2\x80\x9call set\xe2\x80\x9d found that\r\n      they had made unexpected enemies, felt themselves stranded and\r\n      deserted, talked wildly of leaving college.\r\n\r\n      In his own crowd Amory saw men kept out for wearing green hats,\r\n      for being \xe2\x80\x9ca damn tailor\xe2\x80\x99s dummy,\xe2\x80\x9d for having \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much pull in\r\n      heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d for getting drunk one night \xe2\x80\x9cnot like a gentleman, by\r\n      God,\xe2\x80\x9d or for unfathomable secret reasons known to no one but the\r\n      wielders of the black balls.\r\n\r\n      This orgy of sociability culminated in a gigantic party at the\r\n      Nassau Inn, where punch was dispensed from immense bowls, and the\r\n      whole down-stairs became a delirious, circulating, shouting\r\n      pattern of faces and voices.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHi, Dibby\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99gratulations!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGoo\xe2\x80\x99 boy, Tom, you got a good bunch in Cap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Kerry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Kerry\xe2\x80\x94I hear you went Tiger with all the weight-lifters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go Cottage\xe2\x80\x94the parlor-snakes\xe2\x80\x99 delight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThey say Overton fainted when he got his Ivy bid\xe2\x80\x94Did he sign up\r\n      the first day?\xe2\x80\x94oh, _no_. Tore over to Murray-Dodge on a\r\n      bicycle\xe2\x80\x94afraid it was a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d you get into Cap\xe2\x80\x94you old roue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Gratulations!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Gratulations yourself. Hear you got a good crowd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      When the bar closed, the party broke up into groups and streamed,\r\n      singing, over the snow-clad campus, in a weird delusion that\r\n      snobbishness and strain were over at last, and that they could do\r\n      what they pleased for the next two years.\r\n\r\n      Long afterward Amory thought of sophomore spring as the happiest\r\n      time of his life. His ideas were in tune with life as he found\r\n      it; he wanted no more than to drift and dream and enjoy a dozen\r\n      new-found friendships through the April afternoons.\r\n\r\n      Alec Connage came into his room one morning and woke him up into\r\n      the sunshine and peculiar glory of Campbell Hall shining in the\r\n      window.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWake up, Original Sin, and scrape yourself together. Be in front\r\n      of Renwick\xe2\x80\x99s in half an hour. Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s got a car.\xe2\x80\x9d He took the\r\n      bureau cover and carefully deposited it, with its load of small\r\n      articles, upon the bed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99d you get the car?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Amory cynically.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSacred trust, but don\xe2\x80\x99t be a critical goopher or you can\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory said calmly, resettling himself and\r\n      reaching beside the bed for a cigarette.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSleep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a class at eleven-thirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou damned gloom! Of course, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to the\r\n      coast\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      With a bound Amory was out of bed, scattering the bureau cover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      burden on the floor. The coast... he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen it for years,\r\n      since he and his mother were on their pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s going?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded as he wriggled into his B. V. D.\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dick Humbird and Kerry Holiday and Jesse Ferrenby and\xe2\x80\x94oh\r\n      about five or six. Speed it up, kid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      In ten minutes Amory was devouring cornflakes in Renwick\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\n      at nine-thirty they bowled happily out of town, headed for the\r\n      sands of Deal Beach.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kerry, \xe2\x80\x9cthe car belongs down there. In fact, it\r\n      was stolen from Asbury Park by persons unknown, who deserted it\r\n      in Princeton and left for the West. Heartless Humbird here got\r\n      permission from the city council to deliver it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody got any money?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Ferrenby, turning around from\r\n      the front seat.\r\n\r\n      There was an emphatic negative chorus.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat makes it interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMoney\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s money? We can sell the car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCharge him salvage or something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99re we going to get food?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Kerry, eying him reprovingly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you doubt\r\n      Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s ability for three short days? Some people have lived on\r\n      nothing for years at a time. Read the Boy Scout Monthly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThree days,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory mused, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ve got classes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the days is the Sabbath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cJust the same, I can only cut six more classes, with over a\r\n      month and a half to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThrow him out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long walk back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory, you\xe2\x80\x99re running it out, if I may coin a new phrase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better get some dope on yourself, Amory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory subsided resignedly and drooped into a contemplation of the\r\n      scenery. Swinburne seemed to fit in somehow.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cOh, winter\xe2\x80\x99s rains and ruins are over, And all the seasons of snows\r\n   and sins; The days dividing lover and lover, The light that loses,\r\n   the night that wins; And time remembered is grief forgotten, And\r\n   frosts are slain and flowers begotten, And in green underwood and\r\n   cover, Blossom by blossom the spring begins.\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cThe full streams feed on flower of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Amory? Amory\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about poetry, about\r\n      the pretty birds and flowers. I can see it in his eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x9d he lied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about the Princetonian. I\r\n      ought to make up to-night; but I can telephone back, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kerry respectfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthese important men\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory flushed and it seemed to him that Ferrenby, a defeated\r\n      competitor, winced a little. Of course, Kerry was only kidding,\r\n      but he really mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the Princetonian.\r\n\r\n      It was a halcyon day, and as they neared the shore and the salt\r\n      breezes scurried by, he began to picture the ocean and long,\r\n      level stretches of sand and red roofs over blue sea. Then they\r\n      hurried through the little town and it all flashed upon his\r\n      consciousness to a mighty paean of emotion....\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, good Lord! _Look_ at it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet me out, quick\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it for eight years! Oh,\r\n      gentlefolk, stop the car!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an odd child!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Alec.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe he\xe2\x80\x99s a bit eccentric.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The car was obligingly drawn up at a curb, and Amory ran for the\r\n      boardwalk. First, he realized that the sea was blue and that\r\n      there was an enormous quantity of it, and that it roared and\r\n      roared\xe2\x80\x94really all the banalities about the ocean that one could\r\n      realize, but if any one had told him then that these things were\r\n      banalities, he would have gaped in wonder.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll get lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d ordered Kerry, wandering up with the\r\n      crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Amory, tear yourself away and get practical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll try the best hotel first,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand thence and so\r\n      forth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They strolled along the boardwalk to the most imposing hostelry\r\n      in sight, and, entering the dining-room, scattered about a table.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEight Bronxes,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded Alec, \xe2\x80\x9cand a club sandwich and\r\n      Juliennes. The food for one. Hand the rest around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory ate little, having seized a chair where he could watch the\r\n      sea and feel the rock of it. When luncheon was over they sat and\r\n      smoked quietly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Some one scanned it.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEight twenty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRotten overcharge. We\xe2\x80\x99ll give them two dollars and one for the\r\n      waiter. Kerry, collect the small change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The waiter approached, and Kerry gravely handed him a dollar,\r\n      tossed two dollars on the check, and turned away. They sauntered\r\n      leisurely toward the door, pursued in a moment by the suspicious\r\n      Ganymede.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSome mistake, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Kerry took the bill and examined it critically.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo mistake!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shaking his head gravely, and, tearing it\r\n      into four pieces, he handed the scraps to the waiter, who was so\r\n      dumfounded that he stood motionless and expressionless while they\r\n      walked out.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t he send after us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kerry; \xe2\x80\x9cfor a minute he\xe2\x80\x99ll think we\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\n      proprietor\xe2\x80\x99s sons or something; then he\xe2\x80\x99ll look at the check\r\n      again and call the manager, and in the meantime\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They left the car at Asbury and street-car\xe2\x80\x99d to Allenhurst, where\r\n      they investigated the crowded pavilions for beauty. At four there\r\n      were refreshments in a lunch-room, and this time they paid an\r\n      even smaller per cent on the total cost; something about the\r\n      appearance and savoir-faire of the crowd made the thing go, and\r\n      they were not pursued.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Amory, we\xe2\x80\x99re Marxian Socialists,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Kerry. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\n      don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in property and we\xe2\x80\x99re putting it to the great\r\n      test.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNight will descend,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory suggested.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWatch, and put your trust in Holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They became jovial about five-thirty and, linking arms, strolled\r\n      up and down the boardwalk in a row, chanting a monotonous ditty\r\n      about the sad sea waves. Then Kerry saw a face in the crowd that\r\n      attracted him and, rushing off, reappeared in a moment with one\r\n      of the homeliest girls Amory had ever set eyes on. Her pale mouth\r\n      extended from ear to ear, her teeth projected in a solid wedge,\r\n      and she had little, squinty eyes that peeped ingratiatingly over\r\n      the side sweep of her nose. Kerry presented them formally.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cName of Kaluka, Hawaiian queen! Let me present Messrs. Connage,\r\n      Sloane, Humbird, Ferrenby, and Blaine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The girl bobbed courtesies all around. Poor creature; Amory\r\n      supposed she had never before been noticed in her life\xe2\x80\x94possibly\r\n      she was half-witted. While she accompanied them (Kerry had\r\n      invited her to supper) she said nothing which could\r\n      discountenance such a belief.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cShe prefers her native dishes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alec gravely to the waiter,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cbut any coarse food will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      All through supper he addressed her in the most respectful\r\n      language, while Kerry made idiotic love to her on the other side,\r\n      and she giggled and grinned. Amory was content to sit and watch\r\n      the by-play, thinking what a light touch Kerry had, and how he\r\n      could transform the barest incident into a thing of curve and\r\n      contour. They all seemed to have the spirit of it more or less,\r\n      and it was a relaxation to be with them. Amory usually liked men\r\n      individually, yet feared them in crowds unless the crowd was\r\n      around him. He wondered how much each one contributed to the\r\n      party, for there was somewhat of a spiritual tax levied. Alec and\r\n      Kerry were the life of it, but not quite the centre. Somehow the\r\n      quiet Humbird, and Sloane, with his impatient superciliousness,\r\n      were the centre.\r\n\r\n      Dick Humbird had, ever since freshman year, seemed to Amory a\r\n      perfect type of aristocrat. He was slender but well-built\xe2\x80\x94black\r\n      curly hair, straight features, and rather a dark skin. Everything\r\n      he said sounded intangibly appropriate. He possessed infinite\r\n      courage, an averagely good mind, and a sense of honor with a\r\n      clear charm and _noblesse oblige_ that varied it from\r\n      righteousness. He could dissipate without going to pieces, and\r\n      even his most bohemian adventures never seemed \xe2\x80\x9crunning it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      People dressed like him, tried to talk as he did.... Amory\r\n      decided that he probably held the world back, but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      have changed him. ...\r\n\r\n      He differed from the healthy type that was essentially middle\r\n      class\xe2\x80\x94he never seemed to perspire. Some people couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\n      familiar with a chauffeur without having it returned; Humbird\r\n      could have lunched at Sherry\xe2\x80\x99s with a colored man, yet people\r\n      would have somehow known that it was all right. He was not a\r\n      snob, though he knew only half his class. His friends ranged from\r\n      the highest to the lowest, but it was impossible to \xe2\x80\x9ccultivate\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      him. Servants worshipped him, and treated him like a god. He\r\n      seemed the eternal example of what the upper class tries to be.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s like those pictures in the Illustrated London News of the\r\n      English officers who have been killed,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory had said to Alec.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Alec had answered, \xe2\x80\x9cif you want to know the shocking\r\n      truth, his father was a grocery clerk who made a fortune in\r\n      Tacoma real estate and came to New York ten years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory had felt a curious sinking sensation.\r\n\r\n      This present type of party was made possible by the surging\r\n      together of the class after club elections\xe2\x80\x94as if to make a last\r\n      desperate attempt to know itself, to keep together, to fight off\r\n      the tightening spirit of the clubs. It was a let-down from the\r\n      conventional heights they had all walked so rigidly.\r\n\r\n      After supper they saw Kaluka to the boardwalk, and then strolled\r\n      back along the beach to Asbury. The evening sea was a new\r\n      sensation, for all its color and mellow age was gone, and it\r\n      seemed the bleak waste that made the Norse sagas sad; Amory\r\n      thought of Kipling\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cBeaches of Lukanon before the sealers came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It was still a music, though, infinitely sorrowful.\r\n\r\n      Ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock found them penniless. They had suppered greatly on\r\n      their last eleven cents and, singing, strolled up through the\r\n      casinos and lighted arches on the boardwalk, stopping to listen\r\n      approvingly to all band concerts. In one place Kerry took up a\r\n      collection for the French War Orphans which netted a dollar and\r\n      twenty cents, and with this they bought some brandy in case they\r\n      caught cold in the night. They finished the day in a\r\n      moving-picture show and went into solemn systematic roars of\r\n      laughter at an ancient comedy, to the startled annoyance of the\r\n      rest of the audience. Their entrance was distinctly strategic,\r\n      for each man as he entered pointed reproachfully at the one just\r\n      behind him. Sloane, bringing up the rear, disclaimed all\r\n      knowledge and responsibility as soon as the others were scattered\r\n      inside; then as the irate ticket-taker rushed in he followed\r\n      nonchalantly.\r\n\r\n      They reassembled later by the Casino and made arrangements for\r\n      the night. Kerry wormed permission from the watchman to sleep on\r\n      the platform and, having collected a huge pile of rugs from the\r\n      booths to serve as mattresses and blankets, they talked until\r\n      midnight, and then fell into a dreamless sleep, though Amory\r\n      tried hard to stay awake and watch that marvellous moon settle on\r\n      the sea.\r\n\r\n      So they progressed for two happy days, up and down the shore by\r\n      street-car or machine, or by shoe-leather on the crowded\r\n      boardwalk; sometimes eating with the wealthy, more frequently\r\n      dining frugally at the expense of an unsuspecting restaurateur.\r\n      They had their photos taken, eight poses, in a quick-development\r\n      store. Kerry insisted on grouping them as a \xe2\x80\x9cvarsity\xe2\x80\x9d football\r\n      team, and then as a tough gang from the East Side, with their\r\n      coats inside out, and himself sitting in the middle on a\r\n      cardboard moon. The photographer probably has them yet\xe2\x80\x94at least,\r\n      they never called for them. The weather was perfect, and again\r\n      they slept outside, and again Amory fell unwillingly asleep.\r\n\r\n      Sunday broke stolid and respectable, and even the sea seemed to\r\n      mumble and complain, so they returned to Princeton via the Fords\r\n      of transient farmers, and broke up with colds in their heads, but\r\n      otherwise none the worse for wandering.\r\n\r\n      Even more than in the year before, Amory neglected his work, not\r\n      deliberately but lazily and through a multitude of other\r\n      interests. Co-ordinate geometry and the melancholy hexameters of\r\n      Corneille and Racine held forth small allurements, and even\r\n      psychology, which he had eagerly awaited, proved to be a dull\r\n      subject full of muscular reactions and biological phrases rather\r\n      than the study of personality and influence. That was a noon\r\n      class, and it always sent him dozing. Having found that\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9csubjective and objective, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered most of the questions,\r\n      he used the phrase on all occasions, and it became the class joke\r\n      when, on a query being levelled at him, he was nudged awake by\r\n      Ferrenby or Sloane to gasp it out.\r\n\r\n      Mostly there were parties\xe2\x80\x94to Orange or the Shore, more rarely to\r\n      New York and Philadelphia, though one night they marshalled\r\n      fourteen waitresses out of Childs\xe2\x80\x99 and took them to ride down\r\n      Fifth Avenue on top of an auto bus. They all cut more classes\r\n      than were allowed, which meant an additional course the following\r\n      year, but spring was too rare to let anything interfere with\r\n      their colorful ramblings. In May Amory was elected to the\r\n      Sophomore Prom Committee, and when after a long evening\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      discussion with Alec they made out a tentative list of class\r\n      probabilities for the senior council, they placed themselves\r\n      among the surest. The senior council was composed presumably of\r\n      the eighteen most representative seniors, and in view of Alec\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      football managership and Amory\xe2\x80\x99s chance of nosing out Burne\r\n      Holiday as Princetonian chairman, they seemed fairly justified in\r\n      this presumption. Oddly enough, they both placed D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers as\r\n      among the possibilities, a guess that a year before the class\r\n      would have gaped at.\r\n\r\n      All through the spring Amory had kept up an intermittent\r\n      correspondence with Isabelle Borge, punctuated by violent\r\n      squabbles and chiefly enlivened by his attempts to find new words\r\n      for love. He discovered Isabelle to be discreetly and\r\n      aggravatingly unsentimental in letters, but he hoped against hope\r\n      that she would prove not too exotic a bloom to fit the large\r\n      spaces of spring as she had fitted the den in the Minnehaha Club.\r\n      During May he wrote thirty-page documents almost nightly, and\r\n      sent them to her in bulky envelopes exteriorly labelled \xe2\x80\x9cPart I\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      and \xe2\x80\x9cPart II.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Alec, I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of college,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly, as\r\n      they walked the dusk together.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI think I am, too, in a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll I\xe2\x80\x99d like would be a little home in the country, some warm\r\n      country, and a wife, and just enough to do to keep from rotting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMe, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to quit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does your girl say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Amory gasped in horror. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _think_ of\r\n      marrying... that is, not now. I mean the future, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy girl would. I\xe2\x80\x99m engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAre you really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word to anybody, please, but I am. I may not\r\n      come back next year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re only twenty! Give up college?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Amory, you were saying a minute ago\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was just wishing. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      think of leaving college. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that I feel so sad these\r\n      wonderful nights. I sort of feel they\xe2\x80\x99re never coming again, and\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99m not really getting all I could out of them. I wish my girl\r\n      lived here. But marry\xe2\x80\x94not a chance. Especially as father says the\r\n      money isn\xe2\x80\x99t forthcoming as it used to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a waste these nights are!\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Alec.\r\n\r\n      But Amory sighed and made use of the nights. He had a snap-shot\r\n      of Isabelle, enshrined in an old watch, and at eight almost every\r\n      night he would turn off all the lights except the desk lamp and,\r\n      sitting by the open windows with the picture before him, write\r\n      her rapturous letters.\r\n\r\n ... Oh it\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to write you what I really _feel_ when I think\r\n about you so much; you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to mean to me a _dream_ that I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n put on paper any more.  Your last letter came and it was wonderful!  I\r\n read it over about six times, especially the last part, but I do wish,\r\n sometimes, you\xe2\x80\x99d be more _frank_ and tell me what you really do think\r\n of me, yet your last letter was too good to be true, and I can hardly\r\n wait until June!  Be sure and be able to come to the prom.  It\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\n fine, I think, and I want to bring _you_ just at the end of a\r\n wonderful year.  I often think over what you said on that night and\r\n wonder how much you meant.  If it were anyone but you\xe2\x80\x94but you see I\r\n _thought_ you were fickle the first time I saw you and you are so\r\n popular and everthing that I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine you really liking me\r\n _best_.\r\n  Oh, Isabelle, dear\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful night.  Somebody is playing \xe2\x80\x9cLove\r\n  Moon\xe2\x80\x9d on a mandolin far across the campus, and the music seems to\r\n  bring you into the window.  Now he\xe2\x80\x99s playing \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Boys, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n  Through,\xe2\x80\x9d and how well it suits me.  For I am through with\r\n  everything.  I have decided never to take a cocktail again, and I\r\n  know I\xe2\x80\x99ll never again fall in love\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve been too much a\r\n  part of my days and nights to ever let me think of another girl.  I\r\n  meet them all the time and they don\xe2\x80\x99t interest me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not pretending\r\n  to be blas\xc3\xa9, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not that.  It\xe2\x80\x99s just that I\xe2\x80\x99m in love.  Oh,\r\n  _dearest_ Isabelle (somehow I can\xe2\x80\x99t call you just Isabelle, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n  afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll come out with the \xe2\x80\x9cdearest\xe2\x80\x9d before your family this\r\n  June), you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to come to the prom, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come up to your\r\n  house for a day and everything\xe2\x80\x99ll be perfect....\r\n\r\n      And so on in an eternal monotone that seemed to both of them\r\n      infinitely charming, infinitely new.\r\n\r\n\r\n      June came and the days grew so hot and lazy that they could not\r\n      worry even about exams, but spent dreamy evenings on the court of\r\n      Cottage, talking of long subjects until the sweep of country\r\n      toward Stony Brook became a blue haze and the lilacs were white\r\n      around tennis-courts, and words gave way to silent cigarettes....\r\n      Then down deserted Prospect and along McCosh with song everywhere\r\n      around them, up to the hot joviality of Nassau Street.\r\n\r\n      Tom D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers and Amory walked late in those days. A gambling\r\n      fever swept through the sophomore class and they bent over the\r\n      bones till three o\xe2\x80\x99clock many a sultry night. After one session\r\n      they came out of Sloane\xe2\x80\x99s room to find the dew fallen and the\r\n      stars old in the sky.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s borrow bicycles and take a ride,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory suggested.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit tired and this is almost the last night\r\n      of the year, really, because the prom stuff starts Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They found two unlocked bicycles in Holder Court and rode out\r\n      about half-past three along the Lawrenceville Road.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do this summer, Amory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me\xe2\x80\x94same old things, I suppose. A month or two in Lake\r\n      Geneva\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m counting on you to be there in July, you know\xe2\x80\x94then\r\n      there\xe2\x80\x99ll be Minneapolis, and that means hundreds of summer hops,\r\n      parlor-snaking, getting bored\xe2\x80\x94But oh, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d he added suddenly,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9chasn\xe2\x80\x99t this year been slick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Tom emphatically, a new Tom, clothed by Brooks,\r\n      shod by Franks, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve won this game, but I feel as if I never\r\n      want to play another. You\xe2\x80\x99re all right\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re a rubber ball, and\r\n      somehow it suits you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of adapting myself to the\r\n      local snobbishness of this corner of the world. I want to go\r\n      where people aren\xe2\x80\x99t barred because of the color of their neckties\r\n      and the roll of their coats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d argued Amory, as they rolled along through the\r\n      scattering night; \xe2\x80\x9cwherever you go now you\xe2\x80\x99ll always\r\n      unconsciously apply these standards of \xe2\x80\x98having it\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98lacking\r\n      it.\xe2\x80\x99 For better or worse we\xe2\x80\x99ve stamped you; you\xe2\x80\x99re a Princeton\r\n      type!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Tom, his cracked voice rising\r\n      plaintively, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do I have to come back at all? I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned all\r\n      that Princeton has to offer. Two years more of mere pedantry and\r\n      lying around a club aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to help. They\xe2\x80\x99re just going to\r\n      disorganize me, conventionalize me completely. Even now I\xe2\x80\x99m so\r\n      spineless that I wonder how I get away with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, but you\xe2\x80\x99re missing the real point, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory interrupted.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve just had your eyes opened to the snobbishness of the\r\n      world in a rather abrupt manner. Princeton invariably gives the\r\n      thoughtful man a social sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou consider you taught me that, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\n      quizzically, eying Amory in the half dark.\r\n\r\n      Amory laughed quietly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re my bad angel. I\r\n      might have been a pretty fair poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, that\xe2\x80\x99s rather hard. You chose to come to an Eastern\r\n      college. Either your eyes were opened to the mean scrambling\r\n      quality of people, or you\xe2\x80\x99d have gone through blind, and you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n      hate to have done that\xe2\x80\x94been like Marty Kaye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re right. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have liked it. Still,\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be made a cynic at twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI was born one,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a cynical idealist.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\n      paused and wondered if that meant anything.\r\n\r\n      They reached the sleeping school of Lawrenceville, and turned to\r\n      ride back.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good, this ride, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said presently.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes; it\xe2\x80\x99s a good finish, it\xe2\x80\x99s knock-out; everything\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\n      to-night. Oh, for a hot, languorous summer and Isabelle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you and your Isabelle! I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet she\xe2\x80\x99s a simple one... let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      say some poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      So Amory declaimed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ode to a Nightingale\xe2\x80\x9d to the bushes they\r\n      passed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never be a poet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory as he finished. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\n      enough of a sensualist really; there are only a few obvious\r\n      things that I notice as primarily beautiful: women, spring\r\n      evenings, music at night, the sea; I don\xe2\x80\x99t catch the subtle\r\n      things like \xe2\x80\x98silver-snarling trumpets.\xe2\x80\x99 I may turn out an\r\n      intellectual, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll never write anything but mediocre poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They rode into Princeton as the sun was making colored maps of\r\n      the sky behind the graduate school, and hurried to the\r\n      refreshment of a shower that would have to serve in place of\r\n      sleep. By noon the bright-costumed alumni crowded the streets\r\n      with their bands and choruses, and in the tents there was great\r\n      reunion under the orange-and-black banners that curled and\r\n      strained in the wind. Amory looked long at one house which bore\r\n      the legend \xe2\x80\x9cSixty-nine.\xe2\x80\x9d There a few gray-haired men sat and\r\n      talked quietly while the classes swept by in panorama of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n      UNDER THE ARC-LIGHT\r\n\r\n      Then tragedy\xe2\x80\x99s emerald eyes glared suddenly at Amory over the\r\n      edge of June. On the night after his ride to Lawrenceville a\r\n      crowd sallied to New York in quest of adventure, and started back\r\n      to Princeton about twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock in two machines. It had been a\r\n      gay party and different stages of sobriety were represented.\r\n      Amory was in the car behind; they had taken the wrong road and\r\n      lost the way, and so were hurrying to catch up.\r\n\r\n      It was a clear night and the exhilaration of the road went to\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s head. He had the ghost of two stanzas of a poem forming\r\n      in his mind. ...\r\n\r\n  So the gray car crept nightward in the dark and there was no life\r\n  stirred as it went by....  As the still ocean paths before the shark\r\n  in starred and glittering waterways, beauty-high, the moon-swathed\r\n  trees divided, pair on pair, while flapping nightbirds cried across\r\n  the air....\r\n  A moment by an inn of lamps and shades, a yellow inn under a yellow\r\n  moon\xe2\x80\x94then silence, where crescendo laughter fades... the car swung\r\n  out again to the winds of June, mellowed the shadows where the\r\n  distance grew, then crushed the yellow shadows into blue....\r\n\r\n      They jolted to a stop, and Amory peered up, startled. A woman was\r\n      standing beside the road, talking to Alec at the wheel. Afterward\r\n      he remembered the harpy effect that her old kimono gave her, and\r\n      the cracked hollowness of her voice as she spoke:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou Princeton boys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s one of you killed here, and two others about\r\n      dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c_My God!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d She pointed and they gazed in horror. Under the full\r\n      light of a roadside arc-light lay a form, face downward in a\r\n      widening circle of blood.\r\n\r\n      They sprang from the car. Amory thought of the back of that\r\n      head\xe2\x80\x94that hair\xe2\x80\x94that hair... and then they turned the form over.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Dick\xe2\x80\x94Dick Humbird!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Christ!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFeel his heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Then the insistent voice of the old crone in a sort of croaking\r\n      triumph:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s quite dead, all right. The car turned over. Two of the men\r\n      that weren\xe2\x80\x99t hurt just carried the others in, but this one\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\n      use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory rushed into the house and the rest followed with a limp\r\n      mass that they laid on the sofa in the shoddy little front\r\n      parlor. Sloane, with his shoulder punctured, was on another\r\n      lounge. He was half delirious, and kept calling something about a\r\n      chemistry lecture at 8:10.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ferrenby in a strained voice.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDick was driving and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give up the wheel; we told him\r\n      he\xe2\x80\x99d been drinking too much\xe2\x80\x94then there was this damn curve\xe2\x80\x94oh, my\r\n      _God!_...\xe2\x80\x9d He threw himself face downward on the floor and broke\r\n      into dry sobs.\r\n\r\n      The doctor had arrived, and Amory went over to the couch, where\r\n      some one handed him a sheet to put over the body. With a sudden\r\n      hardness, he raised one of the hands and let it fall back\r\n      inertly. The brow was cold but the face not expressionless. He\r\n      looked at the shoe-laces\xe2\x80\x94Dick had tied them that morning. _He_\r\n      had tied them\xe2\x80\x94and now he was this heavy white mass. All that\r\n      remained of the charm and personality of the Dick Humbird he had\r\n      known\xe2\x80\x94oh, it was all so horrible and unaristocratic and close to\r\n      the earth. All tragedy has that strain of the grotesque and\r\n      squalid\xe2\x80\x94so useless, futile... the way animals die.... Amory was\r\n      reminded of a cat that had lain horribly mangled in some alley of\r\n      his childhood.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSome one go to Princeton with Ferrenby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory stepped outside the door and shivered slightly at the late\r\n      night wind\xe2\x80\x94a wind that stirred a broken fender on the mass of\r\n      bent metal to a plaintive, tinny sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n      CRESCENDO!\r\n\r\n      Next day, by a merciful chance, passed in a whirl. When Amory was\r\n      by himself his thoughts zigzagged inevitably to the picture of\r\n      that red mouth yawning incongruously in the white face, but with\r\n      a determined effort he piled present excitement upon the memory\r\n      of it and shut it coldly away from his mind.\r\n\r\n      Isabelle and her mother drove into town at four, and they rode up\r\n      smiling Prospect Avenue, through the gay crowd, to have tea at\r\n      Cottage. The clubs had their annual dinners that night, so at\r\n      seven he loaned her to a freshman and arranged to meet her in the\r\n      gymnasium at eleven, when the upper classmen were admitted to the\r\n      freshman dance. She was all he had expected, and he was happy and\r\n      eager to make that night the centre of every dream. At nine the\r\n      upper classes stood in front of the clubs as the freshman\r\n      torchlight parade rioted past, and Amory wondered if the\r\n      dress-suited groups against the dark, stately backgrounds and\r\n      under the flare of the torches made the night as brilliant to the\r\n      staring, cheering freshmen as it had been to him the year before.\r\n\r\n      The next day was another whirl. They lunched in a gay party of\r\n      six in a private dining-room at the club, while Isabelle and\r\n      Amory looked at each other tenderly over the fried chicken and\r\n      knew that their love was to be eternal. They danced away the prom\r\n      until five, and the stags cut in on Isabelle with joyous abandon,\r\n      which grew more and more enthusiastic as the hour grew late, and\r\n      their wines, stored in overcoat pockets in the coat room, made\r\n      old weariness wait until another day. The stag line is a most\r\n      homogeneous mass of men. It fairly sways with a single soul. A\r\n      dark-haired beauty dances by and there is a half-gasping sound as\r\n      the ripple surges forward and some one sleeker than the rest\r\n      darts out and cuts in. Then when the six-foot girl (brought by\r\n      Kaye in your class, and to whom he has been trying to introduce\r\n      you all evening) gallops by, the line surges back and the groups\r\n      face about and become intent on far corners of the hall, for\r\n      Kaye, anxious and perspiring, appears elbowing through the crowd\r\n      in search of familiar faces.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI say, old man, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an awfully nice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, Kaye, but I\xe2\x80\x99m set for this one. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to cut in on a\r\n      fella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, the next one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94I swear I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go cut in\xe2\x80\x94look me up when she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      got a dance free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It delighted Amory when Isabelle suggested that they leave for a\r\n      while and drive around in her car. For a delicious hour that\r\n      passed too soon they glided the silent roads about Princeton and\r\n      talked from the surface of their hearts in shy excitement. Amory\r\n      felt strangely ingenuous and made no attempt to kiss her.\r\n\r\n      Next day they rode up through the Jersey country, had luncheon in\r\n      New York, and in the afternoon went to see a problem play at\r\n      which Isabelle wept all through the second act, rather to Amory\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      embarrassment\xe2\x80\x94though it filled him with tenderness to watch her.\r\n      He was tempted to lean over and kiss away her tears, and she\r\n      slipped her hand into his under cover of darkness to be pressed\r\n      softly.\r\n\r\n      Then at six they arrived at the Borges\xe2\x80\x99 summer place on Long\r\n      Island, and Amory rushed up-stairs to change into a dinner coat.\r\n      As he put in his studs he realized that he was enjoying life as\r\n      he would probably never enjoy it again. Everything was hallowed\r\n      by the haze of his own youth. He had arrived, abreast of the best\r\n      in his generation at Princeton. He was in love and his love was\r\n      returned. Turning on all the lights, he looked at himself in the\r\n      mirror, trying to find in his own face the qualities that made\r\n      him see clearer than the great crowd of people, that made him\r\n      decide firmly, and able to influence and follow his own will.\r\n      There was little in his life now that he would have changed. ...\r\n      Oxford might have been a bigger field.\r\n\r\n      Silently he admired himself. How conveniently well he looked, and\r\n      how well a dinner coat became him. He stepped into the hall and\r\n      then waited at the top of the stairs, for he heard footsteps\r\n      coming. It was Isabelle, and from the top of her shining hair to\r\n      her little golden slippers she had never seemed so beautiful.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsabelle!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, half involuntarily, and held out his arms.\r\n      As in the story-books, she ran into them, and on that\r\n      half-minute, as their lips first touched, rested the high point\r\n      of vanity, the crest of his young egotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER 3. The Egotist Considers\r\n\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOuch! Let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He dropped his arms to his sides.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYour shirt stud\xe2\x80\x94it hurt me\xe2\x80\x94look!\xe2\x80\x9d She was looking down at her\r\n      neck, where a little blue spot about the size of a pea marred its\r\n      pallor.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Isabelle,\xe2\x80\x9d he reproached himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a goopher. Really,\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x94I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have held you so close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She looked up impatiently.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Amory, of course you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt\r\n      much; but what _are_ we going to do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ about it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94that spot; it\xe2\x80\x99ll disappear in a\r\n      second.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a moment of concentrated gazing,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s still there\xe2\x80\x94and it looks like Old Nick\xe2\x80\x94oh, Amory, what\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n      we do! It\xe2\x80\x99s _just_ the height of your shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMassage it,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested, repressing the faintest inclination\r\n      to laugh.\r\n\r\n      She rubbed it delicately with the tips of her fingers, and then a\r\n      tear gathered in the corner of her eye, and slid down her cheek.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Amory,\xe2\x80\x9d she said despairingly, lifting up a most pathetic\r\n      face, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just make my whole neck _flame_ if I rub it. What\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n      I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      A quotation sailed into his head and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist repeating\r\n      it aloud.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAll the perfumes of Arabia will not whiten this little hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She looked up and the sparkle of the tear in her eye was like\r\n      ice.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not very sympathetic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory mistook her meaning.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsabelle, darling, I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I enough on my mind and you\r\n      stand there and _laugh!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Then he slipped again.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it _is_ funny, Isabelle, and we were talking the other day\r\n      about a sense of humor being\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She was looking at him with something that was not a smile,\r\n      rather the faint, mirthless echo of a smile, in the corners of\r\n      her mouth.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, shut up!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried suddenly, and fled down the hallway\r\n      toward her room. Amory stood there, covered with remorseful\r\n      confusion.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      When Isabelle reappeared she had thrown a light wrap about her\r\n      shoulders, and they descended the stairs in a silence that\r\n      endured through dinner.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsabelle,\xe2\x80\x9d he began rather testily, as they arranged themselves\r\n      in the car, bound for a dance at the Greenwich Country Club,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re angry, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be, too, in a minute. Let\xe2\x80\x99s kiss and make\r\n      up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Isabelle considered glumly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI hate to be laughed at,\xe2\x80\x9d she said finally.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t laugh any more. I\xe2\x80\x99m not laughing now, am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be so darned feminine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Her lips curled slightly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be anything I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory kept his temper with difficulty. He became aware that he\r\n      had not an ounce of real affection for Isabelle, but her coldness\r\n      piqued him. He wanted to kiss her, kiss her a lot, because then\r\n      he knew he could leave in the morning and not care. On the\r\n      contrary, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss her, it would worry him.... It would\r\n      interfere vaguely with his idea of himself as a conqueror. It\r\n      wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dignified to come off second best, _pleading_, with a\r\n      doughty warrior like Isabelle.\r\n\r\n      Perhaps she suspected this. At any rate, Amory watched the night\r\n      that should have been the consummation of romance glide by with\r\n      great moths overhead and the heavy fragrance of roadside gardens,\r\n      but without those broken words, those little sighs....\r\n\r\n      Afterward they suppered on ginger ale and devil\xe2\x80\x99s food in the\r\n      pantry, and Amory announced a decision.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m leaving early in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d he countered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\xe2\x80\x99m going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you insist on being ridiculous\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t put it that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he objected.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94just because I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you kiss me. Do you think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Isabelle,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know it\xe2\x80\x99s not that\xe2\x80\x94even\r\n      suppose it is. We\xe2\x80\x99ve reached the stage where we either ought to\r\n      kiss\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94nothing. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if you were refusing on moral\r\n      grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She hesitated.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think about you,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, in a\r\n      feeble, perverse attempt at conciliation. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so funny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I thought you had a lot of self-confidence and all that;\r\n      remember you told me the other day that you could do anything you\r\n      wanted, or get anything you wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory flushed. He _had_ told her a lot of things.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to feel so self-confident to-night. Maybe\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x99re just plain conceited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x9d he hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cAt Princeton\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you and Princeton! You\xe2\x80\x99d think that was the world, the way\r\n      you talk! Perhaps you _can_ write better than anybody else on\r\n      your old Princetonian; maybe the freshmen _do_ think you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\n      important\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cI _do_, because you\xe2\x80\x99re always\r\n      talking about yourself and I used to like it; now I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHave I to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the point,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Isabelle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou got all upset\r\n      to-night. You just sat and watched my eyes. Besides, I have to\r\n      think all the time I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re so critical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI make you think, do I?\xe2\x80\x9d Amory repeated with a touch of vanity.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a nervous strain\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this emphatically\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand when you analyze\r\n      every little emotion and instinct I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI know.\xe2\x80\x9d Amory admitted her point and shook his head helplessly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d She stood up.\r\n\r\n      He rose abstractedly and they walked to the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat train can I get?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one about 9:11 if you really must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go, really. Good night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They were at the head of the stairs, and as Amory turned into his\r\n      room he thought he caught just the faintest cloud of discontent\r\n      in her face. He lay awake in the darkness and wondered how much\r\n      he cared\xe2\x80\x94how much of his sudden unhappiness was hurt\r\n      vanity\xe2\x80\x94whether he was, after all, temperamentally unfitted for\r\n      romance.\r\n\r\n      When he awoke, it was with a glad flood of consciousness. The\r\n      early wind stirred the chintz curtains at the windows and he was\r\n      idly puzzled not to be in his room at Princeton with his school\r\n      football picture over the bureau and the Triangle Club on the\r\n      wall opposite. Then the grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s clock in the hall outside\r\n      struck eight, and the memory of the night before came to him. He\r\n      was out of bed, dressing, like the wind; he must get out of the\r\n      house before he saw Isabelle. What had seemed a melancholy\r\n      happening, now seemed a tiresome anticlimax. He was dressed at\r\n      half past, so he sat down by the window; felt that the sinews of\r\n      his heart were twisted somewhat more than he had thought. What an\r\n      ironic mockery the morning seemed!\xe2\x80\x94bright and sunny, and full of\r\n      the smell of the garden; hearing Mrs. Borge\xe2\x80\x99s voice in the\r\n      sun-parlor below, he wondered where was Isabelle.\r\n\r\n      There was a knock at the door.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe car will be around at ten minutes of nine, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He returned to his contemplation of the outdoors, and began\r\n      repeating over and over, mechanically, a verse from Browning,\r\n      which he had once quoted to Isabelle in a letter:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cEach life unfulfilled, you see, It hangs still, patchy and scrappy;\r\n   We have not sighed deep, laughed free, Starved, feasted,\r\n   despaired\xe2\x80\x94been happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      But his life would not be unfulfilled. He took a sombre\r\n      satisfaction in thinking that perhaps all along she had been\r\n      nothing except what he had read into her; that this was her high\r\n      point, that no one else would ever make her think. Yet that was\r\n      what she had objected to in him; and Amory was suddenly tired of\r\n      thinking, thinking!\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDamn her!\xe2\x80\x9d he said bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s spoiled my year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE SUPERMAN GROWS CARELESS\r\n\r\n      On a dusty day in September Amory arrived in Princeton and joined\r\n      the sweltering crowd of conditioned men who thronged the streets.\r\n      It seemed a stupid way to commence his upper-class years, to\r\n      spend four hours a morning in the stuffy room of a tutoring\r\n      school, imbibing the infinite boredom of conic sections. Mr.\r\n      Rooney, pander to the dull, conducted the class and smoked\r\n      innumerable Pall Malls as he drew diagrams and worked equations\r\n      from six in the morning until midnight.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Langueduc, if I used that formula, where would my A point\r\n      be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Langueduc lazily shifts his six-foot-three of football material\r\n      and tries to concentrate.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m damned if I know, Mr. Rooney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, why of course, of course you can\xe2\x80\x99t _use_ that formula.\r\n      _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ what I wanted you to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sure, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou bet\xe2\x80\x94I suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t see, tell me. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Rooney, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d go over that\r\n      again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGladly. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98A\xe2\x80\x99...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The room was a study in stupidity\xe2\x80\x94two huge stands for paper, Mr.\r\n      Rooney in his shirt-sleeves in front of them, and slouched around\r\n      on chairs, a dozen men: Fred Sloane, the pitcher, who absolutely\r\n      _had_ to get eligible; \xe2\x80\x9cSlim\xe2\x80\x9d Langueduc, who would beat Yale this\r\n      fall, if only he could master a poor fifty per cent; McDowell,\r\n      gay young sophomore, who thought it was quite a sporting thing to\r\n      be tutoring here with all these prominent athletes.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThose poor birds who haven\xe2\x80\x99t a cent to tutor, and have to study\r\n      during the term are the ones I pity,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced to Amory one\r\n      day, with a flaccid camaraderie in the droop of the cigarette\r\n      from his pale lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI should think it would be such a bore,\r\n      there\xe2\x80\x99s so much else to do in New York during the term. I suppose\r\n      they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they miss, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d There was such an air of\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cyou and I\xe2\x80\x9d about Mr. McDowell that Amory very nearly pushed him\r\n      out of the open window when he said this. ... Next February his\r\n      mother would wonder why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a club and increase his\r\n      allowance... simple little nut....\r\n\r\n      Through the smoke and the air of solemn, dense earnestness that\r\n      filled the room would come the inevitable helpless cry:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t get it! Repeat that, Mr. Rooney!\xe2\x80\x9d Most of them were so\r\n      stupid or careless that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit when they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      understand, and Amory was of the latter. He found it impossible\r\n      to study conic sections; something in their calm and tantalizing\r\n      respectability breathing defiantly through Mr. Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s fetid\r\n      parlors distorted their equations into insoluble anagrams. He\r\n      made a last night\xe2\x80\x99s effort with the proverbial wet towel, and\r\n      then blissfully took the exam, wondering unhappily why all the\r\n      color and ambition of the spring before had faded out. Somehow,\r\n      with the defection of Isabelle the idea of undergraduate success\r\n      had loosed its grasp on his imagination, and he contemplated a\r\n      possible failure to pass off his condition with equanimity, even\r\n      though it would arbitrarily mean his removal from the\r\n      Princetonian board and the slaughter of his chances for the\r\n      Senior Council.\r\n\r\n      There was always his luck.\r\n\r\n      He yawned, scribbled his honor pledge on the cover, and sauntered\r\n      from the room.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t pass it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the newly arrived Alec as they sat\r\n      on the window-seat of Amory\xe2\x80\x99s room and mused upon a scheme of\r\n      wall decoration, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re the world\xe2\x80\x99s worst goopher. Your stock\r\n      will go down like an elevator at the club and on the campus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, hell, I know it. Why rub it in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Cause you deserve it. Anybody that\xe2\x80\x99d risk what you were in line\r\n      for _ought_ to be ineligible for Princetonian chairman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, drop the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory protested. \xe2\x80\x9cWatch and wait and shut\r\n      up. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want every one at the club asking me about it, as if\r\n      I were a prize potato being fattened for a vegetable show.\xe2\x80\x9d One\r\n      evening a week later Amory stopped below his own window on the\r\n      way to Renwick\xe2\x80\x99s, and, seeing a light, called up:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, any mail?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Alec\xe2\x80\x99s head appeared against the yellow square of light.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, your result\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      His heart clamored violently.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, blue or pink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know. Better come up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He walked into the room and straight over to the table, and then\r\n      suddenly noticed that there were other people in the room.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Lo, Kerry.\xe2\x80\x9d He was most polite. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, men of Princeton.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\n      seemed to be mostly friends, so he picked up the envelope marked\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRegistrar\xe2\x80\x99s Office,\xe2\x80\x9d and weighed it nervously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe have here quite a slip of paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOpen it, Amory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cJust to be dramatic, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know that if it\xe2\x80\x99s blue, my\r\n      name is withdrawn from the editorial board of the Prince, and my\r\n      short career is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He paused, and then saw for the first time Ferrenby\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\n      wearing a hungry look and watching him eagerly. Amory returned\r\n      the gaze pointedly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWatch my face, gentlemen, for the primitive emotions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He tore it open and held the slip up to the light.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPink or blue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSay what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all ears, Amory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSmile or swear\xe2\x80\x94or something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      There was a pause... a small crowd of seconds swept by... then he\r\n      looked again and another crowd went on into time.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBlue as the sky, gentlemen....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      AFTERMATH\r\n\r\n      What Amory did that year from early September to late in the\r\n      spring was so purposeless and inconsecutive that it seems\r\n      scarcely worth recording. He was, of course, immediately sorry\r\n      for what he had lost. His philosophy of success had tumbled down\r\n      upon him, and he looked for the reasons.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYour own laziness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alec later.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94something deeper than that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to feel that I was\r\n      meant to lose this chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re rather off you at the club, you know; every man that\r\n      doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come through makes our crowd just so much weaker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI hate that point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, with a little effort you could still stage a\r\n      comeback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m through\xe2\x80\x94as far as ever being a power in college is\r\n      concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Amory, honestly, what makes me the angriest isn\xe2\x80\x99t the fact\r\n      that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be chairman of the Prince and on the Senior\r\n      Council, but just that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get down and pass that exam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory slowly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m mad at the concrete thing. My\r\n      own idleness was quite in accord with my system, but the luck\r\n      broke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYour system broke, you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what are you going to do? Get a better one quick, or just\r\n      bum around for two more years as a has-been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Amory, buck up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, though dangerous, was not far from the\r\n      true one. If his reactions to his environment could be tabulated,\r\n      the chart would have appeared like this, beginning with his\r\n      earliest years:\r\n\r\n 1. The fundamental Amory.\r\n 2. Amory plus Beatrice.\r\n 3. Amory plus Beatrice plus Minneapolis.\r\n\r\n      Then St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99 had pulled him to pieces and started him over\r\n      again:\r\n\r\n 4. Amory plus St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n 5. Amory plus St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99 plus Princeton.\r\n\r\n      That had been his nearest approach to success through conformity.\r\n      The fundamental Amory, idle, imaginative, rebellious, had been\r\n      nearly snowed under. He had conformed, he had succeeded, but as\r\n      his imagination was neither satisfied nor grasped by his own\r\n      success, he had listlessly, half-accidentally chucked the whole\r\n      thing and become again:\r\n\r\n 6. The fundamental Amory.\r\n\r\n\r\n      FINANCIAL\r\n\r\n      His father died quietly and inconspicuously at Thanksgiving. The\r\n      incongruity of death with either the beauties of Lake Geneva or\r\n      with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s dignified, reticent attitude diverted him, and\r\n      he looked at the funeral with an amused tolerance. He decided\r\n      that burial was after all preferable to cremation, and he smiled\r\n      at his old boyhood choice, slow oxidation in the top of a tree.\r\n      The day after the ceremony he was amusing himself in the great\r\n      library by sinking back on a couch in graceful mortuary\r\n      attitudes, trying to determine whether he would, when his day\r\n      came, be found with his arms crossed piously over his chest\r\n      (Monsignor Darcy had once advocated this posture as being the\r\n      most distinguished), or with his hands clasped behind his head, a\r\n      more pagan and Byronic attitude.\r\n\r\n      What interested him much more than the final departure of his\r\n      father from things mundane was a tri-cornered conversation\r\n      between Beatrice, Mr. Barton, of Barton and Krogman, their\r\n      lawyers, and himself, that took place several days after the\r\n      funeral. For the first time he came into actual cognizance of the\r\n      family finances, and realized what a tidy fortune had once been\r\n      under his father\xe2\x80\x99s management. He took a ledger labelled \xe2\x80\x9c1906\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      and ran through it rather carefully. The total expenditure that\r\n      year had come to something over one hundred and ten thousand\r\n      dollars. Forty thousand of this had been Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s own income,\r\n      and there had been no attempt to account for it: it was all under\r\n      the heading, \xe2\x80\x9cDrafts, checks, and letters of credit forwarded to\r\n      Beatrice Blaine.\xe2\x80\x9d The dispersal of the rest was rather minutely\r\n      itemized: the taxes and improvements on the Lake Geneva estate\r\n      had come to almost nine thousand dollars; the general up-keep,\r\n      including Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s electric and a French car, bought that year,\r\n      was over thirty-five thousand dollars. The rest was fully taken\r\n      care of, and there were invariably items which failed to balance\r\n      on the right side of the ledger.\r\n\r\n      In the volume for 1912 Amory was shocked to discover the decrease\r\n      in the number of bond holdings and the great drop in the income.\r\n      In the case of Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s money this was not so pronounced, but\r\n      it was obvious that his father had devoted the previous year to\r\n      several unfortunate gambles in oil. Very little of the oil had\r\n      been burned, but Stephen Blaine had been rather badly singed. The\r\n      next year and the next and the next showed similar decreases, and\r\n      Beatrice had for the first time begun using her own money for\r\n      keeping up the house. Yet her doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bill for 1913 had been\r\n      over nine thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n      About the exact state of things Mr. Barton was quite vague and\r\n      confused. There had been recent investments, the outcome of which\r\n      was for the present problematical, and he had an idea there were\r\n      further speculations and exchanges concerning which he had not\r\n      been consulted.\r\n\r\n      It was not for several months that Beatrice wrote Amory the full\r\n      situation. The entire residue of the Blaine and O\xe2\x80\x99Hara fortunes\r\n      consisted of the place at Lake Geneva and approximately a half\r\n      million dollars, invested now in fairly conservative six-per-cent\r\n      holdings. In fact, Beatrice wrote that she was putting the money\r\n      into railroad and street-car bonds as fast as she could\r\n      conveniently transfer it.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cI am quite sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote to Amory, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if there is one thing we\r\n  can be positive of, it is that people will not stay in one place. \r\n  This Ford person has certainly made the most of that idea.  So I am\r\n  instructing Mr. Barton to specialize on such things as Northern\r\n  Pacific and these Rapid Transit Companies, as they call the\r\n  street-cars.  I shall never forgive myself for not buying Bethlehem\r\n  Steel.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the most fascinating stories.  You must go into\r\n  finance, Amory.  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you would revel in it. You start as a\r\n  messenger or a teller, I believe, and from that you go up\xe2\x80\x94almost\r\n  indefinitely.  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure if I were a man I\xe2\x80\x99d love the handling of\r\n  money; it has become quite a senile passion with me. Before I get any\r\n  farther I want to discuss something.  A Mrs. Bispam, an overcordial\r\n  little lady whom I met at a tea the other day, told me that her son,\r\n  he is at Yale, wrote her that all the boys there wore their summer\r\n  underwear all during the winter, and also went about with their heads\r\n  wet and in low shoes on the coldest days.  Now, Amory, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\n  whether that is a fad at Princeton too, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be so\r\n  foolish.  It not only inclines a young man to pneumonia and infantile\r\n  paralysis, but to all forms of lung trouble, to which you are\r\n  particularly inclined.  You cannot experiment with your health.  I\r\n  have found that out.  I will not make myself ridiculous as some\r\n  mothers no doubt do, by insisting that you wear overshoes, though I\r\n  remember one Christmas you wore them around constantly without a\r\n  single buckle latched, making such a curious swishing sound, and you\r\n  refused to buckle them because it was not the thing to do.  The very\r\n  next Christmas you would not wear even rubbers, though I begged you. \r\n  You are nearly twenty years old now, dear, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t be with you\r\n  constantly to find whether you are doing the sensible thing.\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThis has been a very _practical_ letter.  I warned you in my last\r\n  that the lack of money to do the things one wants to makes one quite\r\n  prosy and domestic, but there is still plenty for everything if we\r\n  are not too extravagant.  Take care of yourself, my dear boy, and do\r\n  try to write at least _once_ a week, because I imagine all sorts of\r\n  horrible things if I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear from you. Affectionately,           \r\n  MOTHER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE TERM \xe2\x80\x9cPERSONAGE\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Monsignor Darcy invited Amory up to the Stuart palace on the\r\n      Hudson for a week at Christmas, and they had enormous\r\n      conversations around the open fire. Monsignor was growing a\r\n      trifle stouter and his personality had expanded even with that,\r\n      and Amory felt both rest and security in sinking into a squat,\r\n      cushioned chair and joining him in the middle-aged sanity of a\r\n      cigar.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve felt like leaving college, Monsignor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll my career\xe2\x80\x99s gone up in smoke; you think it\xe2\x80\x99s petty and all\r\n      that, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all petty. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s most important. I want to hear\r\n      the whole thing. Everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing since I saw you\r\n      last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory talked; he went thoroughly into the destruction of his\r\n      egotistic highways, and in a half-hour the listless quality had\r\n      left his voice.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you do if you left college?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monsignor.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to travel, but of course this tiresome war\r\n      prevents that. Anyways, mother would hate not having me graduate.\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99m just at sea. Kerry Holiday wants me to go over with him and\r\n      join the Lafayette Esquadrille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I would\xe2\x80\x94to-night I\xe2\x80\x99d go in a second.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to be very much more tired of life than I think\r\n      you are. I know you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you do,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Amory reluctantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just seemed an\r\n      easy way out of everything\xe2\x80\x94when I think of another useless,\r\n      draggy year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know; but to tell you the truth, I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about\r\n      you; you seem to me to be progressing perfectly naturally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory objected. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost half my personality in a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it!\xe2\x80\x9d scoffed Monsignor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a great amount\r\n      of vanity and that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLordy! I feel, anyway, as if I\xe2\x80\x99d gone through another fifth form\r\n      at St. Regis\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d Monsignor shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a misfortune; this has\r\n      been a good thing. Whatever worth while comes to you, won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\n      through the channels you were searching last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could be more unprofitable than my present lack of pep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps in itself... but you\xe2\x80\x99re developing. This has given you\r\n      time to think and you\xe2\x80\x99re casting off a lot of your old luggage\r\n      about success and the superman and all. People like us can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      adopt whole theories, as you did. If we can do the next thing,\r\n      and have an hour a day to think in, we can accomplish marvels,\r\n      but as far as any high-handed scheme of blind dominance is\r\n      concerned\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99d just make asses of ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Monsignor, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do the next thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory, between you and me, I have only just learned to do it\r\n      myself. I can do the one hundred things beyond the next thing,\r\n      but I stub my toe on that, just as you stubbed your toe on\r\n      mathematics this fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do we have to do the next thing? It never seems the sort of\r\n      thing I should do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to do it because we\xe2\x80\x99re not personalities, but\r\n      personages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good line\xe2\x80\x94what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cA personality is what you thought you were, what this Kerry and\r\n      Sloane you tell me of evidently are. Personality is a physical\r\n      matter almost entirely; it lowers the people it acts on\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\n      it vanish in a long sickness. But while a personality is active,\r\n      it overrides \xe2\x80\x98the next thing.\xe2\x80\x99 Now a personage, on the other\r\n      hand, gathers. He is never thought of apart from what he\xe2\x80\x99s done.\r\n      He\xe2\x80\x99s a bar on which a thousand things have been hung\xe2\x80\x94glittering\r\n      things sometimes, as ours are; but he uses those things with a\r\n      cold mentality back of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd several of my most glittering possessions had fallen off\r\n      when I needed them.\xe2\x80\x9d Amory continued the simile eagerly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it; when you feel that your garnered prestige and\r\n      talents and all that are hung out, you need never bother about\r\n      anybody; you can cope with them without difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut, on the other hand, if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t my possessions, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      helpless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve a clean start\xe2\x80\x94a start Kerry or Sloane can\r\n      constitutionally never have. You brushed three or four ornaments\r\n      down, and, in a fit of pique, knocked off the rest of them. The\r\n      thing now is to collect some new ones, and the farther you look\r\n      ahead in the collecting the better. But remember, do the next\r\n      thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow clear you can make things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      So they talked, often about themselves, sometimes of philosophy\r\n      and religion, and life as respectively a game or a mystery. The\r\n      priest seemed to guess Amory\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts before they were clear in\r\n      his own head, so closely related were their minds in form and\r\n      groove.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I make lists?\xe2\x80\x9d Amory asked him one night. \xe2\x80\x9cLists of all\r\n      sorts of things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99re a mediaevalist,\xe2\x80\x9d Monsignor answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe both\r\n      are. It\xe2\x80\x99s the passion for classifying and finding a type.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a desire to get something definite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the nucleus of scholastic philosophy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI was beginning to think I was growing eccentric till I came up\r\n      here. It was a pose, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that; for you not posing may be the biggest\r\n      pose of all. Pose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut do the next thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      After Amory returned to college he received several letters from\r\n      Monsignor which gave him more egotistic food for consumption.\r\n\r\n  I am afraid that I gave you too much assurance of your inevitable\r\n  safety, and you must remember that I did that through faith in your\r\n  springs of effort; not in the silly conviction that you will arrive\r\n  without struggle.  Some nuances of character you will have to take\r\n  for granted in yourself, though you must be careful in confessing\r\n  them to others.  You are unsentimental, almost incapable of\r\n  affection, astute without being cunning and vain without being proud.\r\n  Don\xe2\x80\x99t let yourself feel worthless; often through life you will really\r\n  be at your worst when you seem to think best of yourself; and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n  worry about losing your \xe2\x80\x9cpersonality,\xe2\x80\x9d as you persist in calling it;\r\n  at fifteen you had the radiance of early morning, at twenty you will\r\n  begin to have the melancholy brilliance of the moon, and when you are\r\n  my age you will give out, as I do, the genial golden warmth of 4 P.M.\r\n  If you write me letters, please let them be natural ones.  Your last,\r\n  that dissertation on architecture, was perfectly awful\xe2\x80\x94 so \xe2\x80\x9chighbrow\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  that I picture you living in an intellectual and emotional vacuum;\r\n  and beware of trying to classify people too definitely into types;\r\n  you will find that all through their youth they will persist\r\n  annoyingly in jumping from class to class, and by pasting a\r\n  supercilious label on every one you meet you are merely packing a\r\n  Jack-in-the-box that will spring up and leer at you when you begin to\r\n  come into really antagonistic contact with the world.  An\r\n  idealization of some such a man as Leonardo da Vinci would be a more\r\n  valuable beacon to you at present.\r\n  You are bound to go up and down, just as I did in my youth, but do\r\n  keep your clarity of mind, and if fools or sages dare to criticise\r\n  don\xe2\x80\x99t blame yourself too much.\r\n  You say that convention is all that really keeps you straight in this\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cwoman proposition\xe2\x80\x9d; but it\xe2\x80\x99s more than that, Amory; it\xe2\x80\x99s the fear\r\n  that what you begin you can\xe2\x80\x99t stop; you would run amuck, and I know\r\n  whereof I speak; it\xe2\x80\x99s that half-miraculous sixth sense by which you\r\n  detect evil, it\xe2\x80\x99s the half-realized fear of God in your heart.\r\n  Whatever your metier proves to be\xe2\x80\x94religion, architecture,\r\n  literature\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you would be much safer anchored to the Church,\r\n  but I won\xe2\x80\x99t risk my influence by arguing with you even though I am\r\n  secretly sure that the \xe2\x80\x9cblack chasm of Romanism\xe2\x80\x9d yawns beneath you. \r\n  Do write me soon.\r\n    With affectionate regards,          THAYER DARCY.\r\n\r\n      Even Amory\xe2\x80\x99s reading paled during this period; he delved further\r\n      into the misty side streets of literature: Huysmans, Walter\r\n      Pater, Theophile Gautier, and the racier sections of Rabelais,\r\n      Boccaccio, Petronius, and Suetonius. One week, through general\r\n      curiosity, he inspected the private libraries of his classmates\r\n      and found Sloane\xe2\x80\x99s as typical as any: sets of Kipling, O. Henry,\r\n      John Fox, Jr., and Richard Harding Davis; \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Every Middle-Aged\r\n      Woman Ought to Know,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spell of the Yukon\xe2\x80\x9d; a \xe2\x80\x9cgift\xe2\x80\x9d copy of\r\n      James Whitcomb Riley, an assortment of battered, annotated\r\n      schoolbooks, and, finally, to his surprise, one of his own late\r\n      discoveries, the collected poems of Rupert Brooke.\r\n\r\n      Together with Tom D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers, he sought among the lights of\r\n      Princeton for some one who might found the Great American Poetic\r\n      Tradition.\r\n\r\n      The undergraduate body itself was rather more interesting that\r\n      year than had been the entirely Philistine Princeton of two years\r\n      before. Things had livened surprisingly, though at the sacrifice\r\n      of much of the spontaneous charm of freshman year. In the old\r\n      Princeton they would never have discovered Tanaduke Wylie.\r\n      Tanaduke was a sophomore, with tremendous ears and a way of\r\n      saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe earth swirls down through the ominous moons of\r\n      preconsidered generations!\xe2\x80\x9d that made them vaguely wonder why it\r\n      did not sound quite clear, but never question that it was the\r\n      utterance of a supersoul. At least so Tom and Amory took him.\r\n      They told him in all earnestness that he had a mind like\r\n      Shelley\xe2\x80\x99s, and featured his ultrafree free verse and prose poetry\r\n      in the Nassau Literary Magazine. But Tanaduke\xe2\x80\x99s genius absorbed\r\n      the many colors of the age, and he took to the Bohemian life, to\r\n      their great disappointment. He talked of Greenwich Village now\r\n      instead of \xe2\x80\x9cnoon-swirled moons,\xe2\x80\x9d and met winter muses,\r\n      unacademic, and cloistered by Forty-second Street and Broadway,\r\n      instead of the Shelleyan dream-children with whom he had regaled\r\n      their expectant appreciation. So they surrendered Tanaduke to the\r\n      futurists, deciding that he and his flaming ties would do better\r\n      there. Tom gave him the final advice that he should stop writing\r\n      for two years and read the complete works of Alexander Pope four\r\n      times, but on Amory\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Pope for Tanaduke was like\r\n      foot-ease for stomach trouble, they withdrew in laughter, and\r\n      called it a coin\xe2\x80\x99s toss whether this genius was too big or too\r\n      petty for them.\r\n\r\n      Amory rather scornfully avoided the popular professors who\r\n      dispensed easy epigrams and thimblefuls of Chartreuse to groups\r\n      of admirers every night. He was disappointed, too, at the air of\r\n      general uncertainty on every subject that seemed linked with the\r\n      pedantic temperament; his opinions took shape in a miniature\r\n      satire called \xe2\x80\x9cIn a Lecture-Room,\xe2\x80\x9d which he persuaded Tom to\r\n      print in the Nassau Lit.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Fool... Three times a week You hold us helpless while\r\n   you speak, Teasing our thirsty souls with the Sleek \xe2\x80\x98yeas\xe2\x80\x99 of your\r\n   philosophy... Well, here we are, your hundred sheep, Tune up, play\r\n   on, pour forth... we sleep... You are a student, so they say; You\r\n   hammered out the other day A syllabus, from what we know Of some\r\n   forgotten folio; You\xe2\x80\x99d sniffled through an era\xe2\x80\x99s must, Filling your\r\n   nostrils up with dust, And then, arising from your knees, Published,\r\n   in one gigantic sneeze... But here\xe2\x80\x99s a neighbor on my right, An\r\n   Eager Ass, considered bright; Asker of questions....  How he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n   stand, With earnest air and fidgy hand, After this hour, telling you\r\n   He sat all night and burrowed through Your book....  Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\n   coy and he Will simulate precosity, And pedants both, you\xe2\x80\x99ll smile\r\n   and smirk, And leer, and hasten back to work....\r\n    \xe2\x80\x99Twas this day week, sir, you returned A theme of mine, from which\r\n    I learned (Through various comment on the side Which you had\r\n    scrawled) that I defied The _highest rules of criticism_ For\r\n    _cheap_ and _careless_ witticism.... \xe2\x80\x98Are you quite sure that this\r\n    could be?\xe2\x80\x99 And \xe2\x80\x98Shaw is no authority!\xe2\x80\x99 But Eager Ass, with what\r\n    he\xe2\x80\x99s sent, Plays havoc with your best per cent.\r\n    Still\xe2\x80\x94still I meet you here and there... When Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s played\r\n    you hold a chair, And some defunct, moth-eaten star Enchants the\r\n    mental prig you are... A radical comes down and shocks The\r\n    atheistic orthodox? You\xe2\x80\x99re representing Common Sense, Mouth open,\r\n    in the audience. And, sometimes, even chapel lures That conscious\r\n    tolerance of yours, That broad and beaming view of truth (Including\r\n    Kant and General Booth...) And so from shock to shock you live, A\r\n    hollow, pale affirmative...\r\n    The hour\xe2\x80\x99s up... and roused from rest One hundred children of the\r\n    blest Cheat you a word or two with feet That down the noisy\r\n    aisle-ways beat... Forget on _narrow-minded earth_ The Mighty Yawn\r\n    that gave you birth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      In April, Kerry Holiday left college and sailed for France to\r\n      enroll in the Lafayette Esquadrille. Amory\xe2\x80\x99s envy and admiration\r\n      of this step was drowned in an experience of his own to which he\r\n      never succeeded in giving an appropriate value, but which,\r\n      nevertheless, haunted him for three years afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE DEVIL\r\n\r\n      Healy\xe2\x80\x99s they left at twelve and taxied to Bistolary\xe2\x80\x99s. There were\r\n      Axia Marlowe and Phoebe Column, from the Summer Garden show, Fred\r\n      Sloane and Amory. The evening was so very young that they felt\r\n      ridiculous with surplus energy, and burst into the cafe like\r\n      Dionysian revellers.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTable for four in the middle of the floor,\xe2\x80\x9d yelled Phoebe.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHurry, old dear, tell \xe2\x80\x99em we\xe2\x80\x99re here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTell \xe2\x80\x99em to play \xe2\x80\x98Admiration\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Sloane. \xe2\x80\x9cYou two order;\r\n      Phoebe and I are going to shake a wicked calf,\xe2\x80\x9d and they sailed\r\n      off in the muddled crowd. Axia and Amory, acquaintances of an\r\n      hour, jostled behind a waiter to a table at a point of vantage;\r\n      there they took seats and watched.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Findle Margotson, from New Haven!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried above the\r\n      uproar. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Lo, Findle! Whoo-ee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Axia!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in salutation. \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon over to our table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d Amory whispered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t do it, Findle; I\xe2\x80\x99m with somebody else! Call me up\r\n      to-morrow about one o\xe2\x80\x99clock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Findle, a nondescript man-about-Bisty\xe2\x80\x99s, answered incoherently\r\n      and turned back to the brilliant blonde whom he was endeavoring\r\n      to steer around the room.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a natural damn fool,\xe2\x80\x9d commented Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the old jitney waiter. If you ask me,\r\n      I want a double Daiquiri.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMake it four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The crowd whirled and changed and shifted. They were mostly from\r\n      the colleges, with a scattering of the male refuse of Broadway,\r\n      and women of two types, the higher of which was the chorus girl.\r\n      On the whole it was a typical crowd, and their party as typical\r\n      as any. About three-fourths of the whole business was for effect\r\n      and therefore harmless, ended at the door of the cafe, soon\r\n      enough for the five-o\xe2\x80\x99clock train back to Yale or Princeton;\r\n      about one-fourth continued on into the dimmer hours and gathered\r\n      strange dust from strange places. Their party was scheduled to be\r\n      one of the harmless kind. Fred Sloane and Phoebe Column were old\r\n      friends; Axia and Amory new ones. But strange things are prepared\r\n      even in the dead of night, and the unusual, which lurks least in\r\n      the cafe, home of the prosaic and inevitable, was preparing to\r\n      spoil for him the waning romance of Broadway. The way it took was\r\n      so inexpressibly terrible, so unbelievable, that afterward he\r\n      never thought of it as experience; but it was a scene from a\r\n      misty tragedy, played far behind the veil, and that it meant\r\n      something definite he knew.\r\n\r\n      About one o\xe2\x80\x99clock they moved to Maxim\xe2\x80\x99s, and two found them in\r\n      Deviniere\xe2\x80\x99s. Sloane had been drinking consecutively and was in a\r\n      state of unsteady exhilaration, but Amory was quite tiresomely\r\n      sober; they had run across none of those ancient, corrupt buyers\r\n      of champagne who usually assisted their New York parties. They\r\n      were just through dancing and were making their way back to their\r\n      chairs when Amory became aware that some one at a near-by table\r\n      was looking at him. He turned and glanced casually... a\r\n      middle-aged man dressed in a brown sack suit, it was, sitting a\r\n      little apart at a table by himself and watching their party\r\n      intently. At Amory\xe2\x80\x99s glance he smiled faintly. Amory turned to\r\n      Fred, who was just sitting down.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that pale fool watching us?\xe2\x80\x9d he complained indignantly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sloane. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have him thrown out!\xe2\x80\x9d He rose to\r\n      his feet and swayed back and forth, clinging to his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\n      is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Axia and Phoebe suddenly leaned and whispered to each other\r\n      across the table, and before Amory realized it they found\r\n      themselves on their way to the door.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhere now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cUp to the flat,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Phoebe. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got brandy and\r\n      fizz\xe2\x80\x94and everything\xe2\x80\x99s slow down here to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory considered quickly. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been drinking, and decided\r\n      that if he took no more, it would be reasonably discreet for him\r\n      to trot along in the party. In fact, it would be, perhaps, the\r\n      thing to do in order to keep an eye on Sloane, who was not in a\r\n      state to do his own thinking. So he took Axia\xe2\x80\x99s arm and, piling\r\n      intimately into a taxicab, they drove out over the hundreds and\r\n      drew up at a tall, white-stone apartment-house. ... Never would\r\n      he forget that street.... It was a broad street, lined on both\r\n      sides with just such tall, white-stone buildings, dotted with\r\n      dark windows; they stretched along as far as the eye could see,\r\n      flooded with a bright moonlight that gave them a calcium pallor.\r\n      He imagined each one to have an elevator and a colored hall-boy\r\n      and a key-rack; each one to be eight stories high and full of\r\n      three and four room suites. He was rather glad to walk into the\r\n      cheeriness of Phoebe\xe2\x80\x99s living-room and sink onto a sofa, while\r\n      the girls went rummaging for food.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPhoebe\xe2\x80\x99s great stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d confided Sloane, sotto voce.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only going to stay half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory said sternly. He\r\n      wondered if it sounded priggish.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHell y\xe2\x80\x99 say,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Sloane. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re here now\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t le\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      rush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like this place,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory said sulkily, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\n      any food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Phoebe reappeared with sandwiches, brandy bottle, siphon, and\r\n      four glasses.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory, pour \xe2\x80\x99em out,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\xe2\x80\x99ll drink to Fred Sloane,\r\n      who has a rare, distinguished edge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Axia, coming in, \xe2\x80\x9cand Amory. I like Amory.\xe2\x80\x9d She sat\r\n      down beside him and laid her yellow head on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sloane; \xe2\x80\x9cyou use siphon, Phoebe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They filled the tray with glasses.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cReady, here she goes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory hesitated, glass in hand.\r\n\r\n      There was a minute while temptation crept over him like a warm\r\n      wind, and his imagination turned to fire, and he took the glass\r\n      from Phoebe\xe2\x80\x99s hand. That was all; for at the second that his\r\n      decision came, he looked up and saw, ten yards from him, the man\r\n      who had been in the cafe, and with his jump of astonishment the\r\n      glass fell from his uplifted hand. There the man half sat, half\r\n      leaned against a pile of pillows on the corner divan. His face\r\n      was cast in the same yellow wax as in the cafe, neither the dull,\r\n      pasty color of a dead man\xe2\x80\x94rather a sort of virile pallor\xe2\x80\x94nor\r\n      unhealthy, you\xe2\x80\x99d have called it; but like a strong man who\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n      worked in a mine or done night shifts in a damp climate. Amory\r\n      looked him over carefully and later he could have drawn him after\r\n      a fashion, down to the merest details. His mouth was the kind\r\n      that is called frank, and he had steady gray eyes that moved\r\n      slowly from one to the other of their group, with just the shade\r\n      of a questioning expression. Amory noticed his hands; they\r\n      weren\xe2\x80\x99t fine at all, but they had versatility and a tenuous\r\n      strength... they were nervous hands that sat lightly along the\r\n      cushions and moved constantly with little jerky openings and\r\n      closings. Then, suddenly, Amory perceived the feet, and with a\r\n      rush of blood to the head he realized he was afraid. The feet\r\n      were all wrong ... with a sort of wrongness that he felt rather\r\n      than knew.... It was like weakness in a good woman, or blood on\r\n      satin; one of those terrible incongruities that shake little\r\n      things in the back of the brain. He wore no shoes, but, instead,\r\n      a sort of half moccasin, pointed, though, like the shoes they\r\n      wore in the fourteenth century, and with the little ends curling\r\n      up. They were a darkish brown and his toes seemed to fill them to\r\n      the end.... They were unutterably terrible....\r\n\r\n      He must have said something, or looked something, for Axia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      voice came out of the void with a strange goodness.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, look at Amory! Poor old Amory\xe2\x80\x99s sick\xe2\x80\x94old head going\r\n      \xe2\x80\x99round?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLook at that man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Amory, pointing toward the corner\r\n      divan.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that purple zebra!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Axia facetiously. \xe2\x80\x9cOoo-ee!\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s got a purple zebra watching him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Sloane laughed vacantly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOle zebra gotcha, Amory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      There was a silence.... The man regarded Amory quizzically....\r\n      Then the human voices fell faintly on his ear:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThought you weren\xe2\x80\x99t drinking,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Axia sardonically, but\r\n      her voice was good to hear; the whole divan that held the man was\r\n      alive; alive like heat waves over asphalt, like wriggling\r\n      worms....\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome back! Come back!\xe2\x80\x9d Axia\xe2\x80\x99s arm fell on his. \xe2\x80\x9cAmory, dear, you\r\n      aren\xe2\x80\x99t going, Amory!\xe2\x80\x9d He was half-way to the door.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Amory, stick \xe2\x80\x99th us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSick, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSit down a second!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTake some water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTake a little brandy....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The elevator was close, and the colored boy was half asleep,\r\n      paled to a livid bronze... Axia\xe2\x80\x99s beseeching voice floated down\r\n      the shaft. Those feet... those feet...\r\n\r\n      As they settled to the lower floor the feet came into view in the\r\n      sickly electric light of the paved hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n      IN THE ALLEY\r\n\r\n      Down the long street came the moon, and Amory turned his back on\r\n      it and walked. Ten, fifteen steps away sounded the footsteps.\r\n      They were like a slow dripping, with just the slightest\r\n      insistence in their fall. Amory\xe2\x80\x99s shadow lay, perhaps, ten feet\r\n      ahead of him, and soft shoes was presumably that far behind. With\r\n      the instinct of a child Amory edged in under the blue darkness of\r\n      the white buildings, cleaving the moonlight for haggard seconds,\r\n      once bursting into a slow run with clumsy stumblings. After that\r\n      he stopped suddenly; he must keep hold, he thought. His lips were\r\n      dry and he licked them.\r\n\r\n      If he met any one good\xe2\x80\x94were there any good people left in the\r\n      world or did they all live in white apartment-houses now? Was\r\n      every one followed in the moonlight? But if he met some one good\r\n      who\xe2\x80\x99d know what he meant and hear this damned scuffle... then the\r\n      scuffling grew suddenly nearer, and a black cloud settled over\r\n      the moon. When again the pale sheen skimmed the cornices, it was\r\n      almost beside him, and Amory thought he heard a quiet breathing.\r\n      Suddenly he realized that the footsteps were not behind, had\r\n      never been behind, they were ahead and he was not eluding but\r\n      following... following. He began to run, blindly, his heart\r\n      knocking heavily, his hands clinched. Far ahead a black dot\r\n      showed itself, resolved slowly into a human shape. But Amory was\r\n      beyond that now; he turned off the street and darted into an\r\n      alley, narrow and dark and smelling of old rottenness. He twisted\r\n      down a long, sinuous blackness, where the moonlight was shut away\r\n      except for tiny glints and patches... then suddenly sank panting\r\n      into a corner by a fence, exhausted. The steps ahead stopped, and\r\n      he could hear them shift slightly with a continuous motion, like\r\n      waves around a dock.\r\n\r\n      He put his face in his hands and covered eyes and ears as well as\r\n      he could. During all this time it never occurred to him that he\r\n      was delirious or drunk. He had a sense of reality such as\r\n      material things could never give him. His intellectual content\r\n      seemed to submit passively to it, and it fitted like a glove\r\n      everything that had ever preceded it in his life. It did not\r\n      muddle him. It was like a problem whose answer he knew on paper,\r\n      yet whose solution he was unable to grasp. He was far beyond\r\n      horror. He had sunk through the thin surface of that, now moved\r\n      in a region where the feet and the fear of white walls were real,\r\n      living things, things he must accept. Only far inside his soul a\r\n      little fire leaped and cried that something was pulling him down,\r\n      trying to get him inside a door and slam it behind him. After\r\n      that door was slammed there would be only footfalls and white\r\n      buildings in the moonlight, and perhaps he would be one of the\r\n      footfalls.\r\n\r\n      During the five or ten minutes he waited in the shadow of the\r\n      fence, there was somehow this fire... that was as near as he\r\n      could name it afterward. He remembered calling aloud:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI want some one stupid. Oh, send some one stupid!\xe2\x80\x9d This to the\r\n      black fence opposite him, in whose shadows the footsteps shuffled\r\n      ... shuffled. He supposed \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d had become somehow\r\n      intermingled through previous association. When he called thus it\r\n      was not an act of will at all\xe2\x80\x94will had turned him away from the\r\n      moving figure in the street; it was almost instinct that called,\r\n      just the pile on pile of inherent tradition or some wild prayer\r\n      from way over the night. Then something clanged like a low gong\r\n      struck at a distance, and before his eyes a face flashed over the\r\n      two feet, a face pale and distorted with a sort of infinite evil\r\n      that twisted it like flame in the wind; _but he knew, for the\r\n      half instant that the gong tanged and hummed, that it was the\r\n      face of Dick Humbird._\r\n\r\n      Minutes later he sprang to his feet, realizing dimly that there\r\n      was no more sound, and that he was alone in the graying alley. It\r\n      was cold, and he started on a steady run for the light that\r\n      showed the street at the other end.\r\n\r\n\r\n      AT THE WINDOW\r\n\r\n      It was late morning when he woke and found the telephone beside\r\n      his bed in the hotel tolling frantically, and remembered that he\r\n      had left word to be called at eleven. Sloane was snoring heavily,\r\n      his clothes in a pile by his bed. They dressed and ate breakfast\r\n      in silence, and then sauntered out to get some air. Amory\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\n      was working slowly, trying to assimilate what had happened and\r\n      separate from the chaotic imagery that stacked his memory the\r\n      bare shreds of truth. If the morning had been cold and gray he\r\n      could have grasped the reins of the past in an instant, but it\r\n      was one of those days that New York gets sometimes in May, when\r\n      the air on Fifth Avenue is a soft, light wine. How much or how\r\n      little Sloane remembered Amory did not care to know; he\r\n      apparently had none of the nervous tension that was gripping\r\n      Amory and forcing his mind back and forth like a shrieking saw.\r\n\r\n      Then Broadway broke upon them, and with the babel of noise and\r\n      the painted faces a sudden sickness rushed over Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back! Let\xe2\x80\x99s get off of this\xe2\x80\x94this\r\n      place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Sloane looked at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThis street, it\xe2\x80\x99s ghastly! Come on! let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to the\r\n      Avenue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sloane stolidly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat \xe2\x80\x99cause you had\r\n      some sort of indigestion that made you act like a maniac last\r\n      night, you\xe2\x80\x99re never coming on Broadway again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Simultaneously Amory classed him with the crowd, and he seemed no\r\n      longer Sloane of the debonair humor and the happy personality,\r\n      but only one of the evil faces that whirled along the turbid\r\n      stream.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMan!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted so loud that the people on the corner turned\r\n      and followed them with their eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s filthy, and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      see it, you\xe2\x80\x99re filthy, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sloane doggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with\r\n      you? Old remorse getting you? You\xe2\x80\x99d be in a fine state if you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n      gone through with our little party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going, Fred,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory slowly. His knees were shaking\r\n      under him, and he knew that if he stayed another minute on this\r\n      street he would keel over where he stood. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be at the\r\n      Vanderbilt for lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d And he strode rapidly off and turned over\r\n      to Fifth Avenue. Back at the hotel he felt better, but as he\r\n      walked into the barber-shop, intending to get a head massage, the\r\n      smell of the powders and tonics brought back Axia\xe2\x80\x99s sidelong,\r\n      suggestive smile, and he left hurriedly. In the doorway of his\r\n      room a sudden blackness flowed around him like a divided river.\r\n\r\n      When he came to himself he knew that several hours had passed. He\r\n      pitched onto the bed and rolled over on his face with a deadly\r\n      fear that he was going mad. He wanted people, people, some one\r\n      sane and stupid and good. He lay for he knew not how long without\r\n      moving. He could feel the little hot veins on his forehead\r\n      standing out, and his terror had hardened on him like plaster. He\r\n      felt he was passing up again through the thin crust of horror,\r\n      and now only could he distinguish the shadowy twilight he was\r\n      leaving. He must have fallen asleep again, for when he next\r\n      recollected himself he had paid the hotel bill and was stepping\r\n      into a taxi at the door. It was raining torrents.\r\n\r\n      On the train for Princeton he saw no one he knew, only a crowd of\r\n      fagged-looking Philadelphians. The presence of a painted woman\r\n      across the aisle filled him with a fresh burst of sickness and he\r\n      changed to another car, tried to concentrate on an article in a\r\n      popular magazine. He found himself reading the same paragraphs\r\n      over and over, so he abandoned this attempt and leaning over\r\n      wearily pressed his hot forehead against the damp window-pane.\r\n      The car, a smoker, was hot and stuffy with most of the smells of\r\n      the state\xe2\x80\x99s alien population; he opened a window and shivered\r\n      against the cloud of fog that drifted in over him. The two hours\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      ride were like days, and he nearly cried aloud with joy when the\r\n      towers of Princeton loomed up beside him and the yellow squares\r\n      of light filtered through the blue rain.\r\n\r\n      Tom was standing in the centre of the room, pensively relighting\r\n      a cigar-stub. Amory fancied he looked rather relieved on seeing\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHad a hell of a dream about you last night,\xe2\x80\x9d came in the cracked\r\n      voice through the cigar smoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI had an idea you were in some\r\n      trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me about it!\xe2\x80\x9d Amory almost shrieked. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say a\r\n      word; I\xe2\x80\x99m tired and pepped out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom looked at him queerly and then sank into a chair and opened\r\n      his Italian note-book. Amory threw his coat and hat on the floor,\r\n      loosened his collar, and took a Wells novel at random from the\r\n      shelf. \xe2\x80\x9cWells is sane,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand if he won\xe2\x80\x99t do I\xe2\x80\x99ll read\r\n      Rupert Brooke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Half an hour passed. Outside the wind came up, and Amory started\r\n      as the wet branches moved and clawed with their finger-nails at\r\n      the window-pane. Tom was deep in his work, and inside the room\r\n      only the occasional scratch of a match or the rustle of leather\r\n      as they shifted in their chairs broke the stillness. Then like a\r\n      zigzag of lightning came the change. Amory sat bolt upright,\r\n      frozen cold in his chair. Tom was looking at him with his mouth\r\n      drooping, eyes fixed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGod help us!\xe2\x80\x9d Amory cried.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Tom, \xe2\x80\x9clook behind!\xe2\x80\x9d Quick as a flash\r\n      Amory whirled around. He saw nothing but the dark window-pane.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gone now,\xe2\x80\x9d came Tom\xe2\x80\x99s voice after a second in a still\r\n      terror. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething was looking at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Trembling violently, Amory dropped into his chair again.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had one hell of an\r\n      experience. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the devil or\xe2\x80\x94something like\r\n      him. What face did you just see?\xe2\x80\x94or no,\xe2\x80\x9d he added quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      And he gave Tom the story. It was midnight when he finished, and\r\n      after that, with all lights burning, two sleepy, shivering boys\r\n      read to each other from \xe2\x80\x9cThe New Machiavelli,\xe2\x80\x9d until dawn came up\r\n      out of Witherspoon Hall, and the Princetonian fell against the\r\n      door, and the May birds hailed the sun on last night\xe2\x80\x99s rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER 4. Narcissus Off Duty\r\n\r\n\r\n      During Princeton\xe2\x80\x99s transition period, that is, during Amory\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      last two years there, while he saw it change and broaden and live\r\n      up to its Gothic beauty by better means than night parades,\r\n      certain individuals arrived who stirred it to its plethoric\r\n      depths. Some of them had been freshmen, and wild freshmen, with\r\n      Amory; some were in the class below; and it was in the beginning\r\n      of his last year and around small tables at the Nassau Inn that\r\n      they began questioning aloud the institutions that Amory and\r\n      countless others before him had questioned so long in secret.\r\n      First, and partly by accident, they struck on certain books, a\r\n      definite type of biographical novel that Amory christened \xe2\x80\x9cquest\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      books. In the \xe2\x80\x9cquest\xe2\x80\x9d book the hero set off in life armed with\r\n      the best weapons and avowedly intending to use them as such\r\n      weapons are usually used, to push their possessors ahead as\r\n      selfishly and blindly as possible, but the heroes of the \xe2\x80\x9cquest\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      books discovered that there might be a more magnificent use for\r\n      them. \xe2\x80\x9cNone Other Gods,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSinister Street,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Research\r\n      Magnificent\xe2\x80\x9d were examples of such books; it was the latter of\r\n      these three that gripped Burne Holiday and made him wonder in the\r\n      beginning of senior year how much it was worth while being a\r\n      diplomatic autocrat around his club on Prospect Avenue and\r\n      basking in the high lights of class office. It was distinctly\r\n      through the channels of aristocracy that Burne found his way.\r\n      Amory, through Kerry, had had a vague drifting acquaintance with\r\n      him, but not until January of senior year did their friendship\r\n      commence.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHeard the latest?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, coming in late one drizzly evening\r\n      with that triumphant air he always wore after a successful\r\n      conversational bout.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Somebody flunked out? Or another ship sunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWorse than that. About one-third of the junior class are going\r\n      to resign from their clubs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cActual fact!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSpirit of reform and all that. Burne Holiday is behind it. The\r\n      club presidents are holding a meeting to-night to see if they can\r\n      find a joint means of combating it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the idea of the thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, clubs injurious to Princeton democracy; cost a lot; draw\r\n      social lines, take time; the regular line you get sometimes from\r\n      disappointed sophomores. Woodrow thought they should be abolished\r\n      and all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut this is the real thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely. I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll go through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFor Pete\xe2\x80\x99s sake, tell me more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d began Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems that the idea developed\r\n      simultaneously in several heads. I was talking to Burne awhile\r\n      ago, and he claims that it\xe2\x80\x99s a logical result if an intelligent\r\n      person thinks long enough about the social system. They had a\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98discussion crowd\xe2\x80\x99 and the point of abolishing the clubs was\r\n      brought up by some one\xe2\x80\x94everybody there leaped at it\xe2\x80\x94it had been\r\n      in each one\xe2\x80\x99s mind, more or less, and it just needed a spark to\r\n      bring it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFine! I swear I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be most entertaining. How do they\r\n      feel up at Cap and Gown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWild, of course. Every one\xe2\x80\x99s been sitting and arguing and\r\n      swearing and getting mad and getting sentimental and getting\r\n      brutal. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same at all the clubs; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been the rounds.\r\n      They get one of the radicals in the corner and fire questions at\r\n      him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow do the radicals stand up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, moderately well. Burne\xe2\x80\x99s a damn good talker, and so\r\n      obviously sincere that you can\xe2\x80\x99t get anywhere with him. It\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\n      evident that resigning from his club means so much more to him\r\n      than preventing it does to us that I felt futile when I argued;\r\n      finally took a position that was brilliantly neutral. In fact, I\r\n      believe Burne thought for a while that he\xe2\x80\x99d converted me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you say almost a third of the junior class are going to\r\n      resign?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCall it a fourth and be safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLord\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x99d have thought it possible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      There was a brisk knock at the door, and Burne himself came in.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Amory\xe2\x80\x94hello, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory rose.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Evening, Burne. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I seem to rush; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\n      Renwick\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Burne turned to him quickly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou probably know what I want to talk to Tom about, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      a bit private. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to.\xe2\x80\x9d Amory sat down again, and as Burne perched on a\r\n      table and launched into argument with Tom, he looked at this\r\n      revolutionary more carefully than he ever had before.\r\n      Broad-browed and strong-chinned, with a fineness in the honest\r\n      gray eyes that were like Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s, Burne was a man who gave an\r\n      immediate impression of bigness and security\xe2\x80\x94stubborn, that was\r\n      evident, but his stubbornness wore no stolidity, and when he had\r\n      talked for five minutes Amory knew that this keen enthusiasm had\r\n      in it no quality of dilettantism.\r\n\r\n      The intense power Amory felt later in Burne Holiday differed from\r\n      the admiration he had had for Humbird. This time it began as\r\n      purely a mental interest. With other men of whom he had thought\r\n      as primarily first-class, he had been attracted first by their\r\n      personalities, and in Burne he missed that immediate magnetism to\r\n      which he usually swore allegiance. But that night Amory was\r\n      struck by Burne\xe2\x80\x99s intense earnestness, a quality he was\r\n      accustomed to associate only with the dread stupidity, and by the\r\n      great enthusiasm that struck dead chords in his heart. Burne\r\n      stood vaguely for a land Amory hoped he was drifting toward\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      it was almost time that land was in sight. Tom and Amory and Alec\r\n      had reached an impasse; never did they seem to have new\r\n      experiences in common, for Tom and Alec had been as blindly busy\r\n      with their committees and boards as Amory had been blindly\r\n      idling, and the things they had for dissection\xe2\x80\x94college,\r\n      contemporary personality and the like\xe2\x80\x94they had hashed and\r\n      rehashed for many a frugal conversational meal.\r\n\r\n      That night they discussed the clubs until twelve, and, in the\r\n      main, they agreed with Burne. To the roommates it did not seem\r\n      such a vital subject as it had in the two years before, but the\r\n      logic of Burne\xe2\x80\x99s objections to the social system dovetailed so\r\n      completely with everything they had thought, that they questioned\r\n      rather than argued, and envied the sanity that enabled this man\r\n      to stand out so against all traditions.\r\n\r\n      Then Amory branched off and found that Burne was deep in other\r\n      things as well. Economics had interested him and he was turning\r\n      socialist. Pacifism played in the back of his mind, and he read\r\n      The Masses and Lyoff Tolstoi faithfully.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow about religion?\xe2\x80\x9d Amory asked him.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a muddle about a lot of things\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve just\r\n      discovered that I\xe2\x80\x99ve a mind, and I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRead what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEverything. I have to pick and choose, of course, but mostly\r\n      things to make me think. I\xe2\x80\x99m reading the four gospels now, and\r\n      the \xe2\x80\x98Varieties of Religious Experience.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat chiefly started you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWells, I guess, and Tolstoi, and a man named Edward Carpenter.\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading for over a year now\xe2\x80\x94on a few lines, on what I\r\n      consider the essential lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPoetry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, frankly, not what you call poetry, or for your reasons\xe2\x80\x94you\r\n      two write, of course, and look at things differently. Whitman is\r\n      the man that attracts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhitman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes; he\xe2\x80\x99s a definite ethical force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed to say that I\xe2\x80\x99m a blank on the subject of\r\n      Whitman. How about you, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom nodded sheepishly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Burne, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may strike a few poems that are\r\n      tiresome, but I mean the mass of his work. He\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous\xe2\x80\x94like\r\n      Tolstoi. They both look things in the face, and, somehow,\r\n      different as they are, stand for somewhat the same things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou have me stumped, Burne,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve read \xe2\x80\x98Anna\r\n      Karenina\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Kreutzer Sonata\xe2\x80\x99 of course, but Tolstoi is\r\n      mostly in the original Russian as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest man in hundreds of years,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Burne\r\n      enthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see a picture of that shaggy old\r\n      head of his?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They talked until three, from biology to organized religion, and\r\n      when Amory crept shivering into bed it was with his mind aglow\r\n      with ideas and a sense of shock that some one else had discovered\r\n      the path he might have followed. Burne Holiday was so evidently\r\n      developing\xe2\x80\x94and Amory had considered that he was doing the same.\r\n      He had fallen into a deep cynicism over what had crossed his\r\n      path, plotted the imperfectability of man and read Shaw and\r\n      Chesterton enough to keep his mind from the edges of\r\n      decadence\xe2\x80\x94now suddenly all his mental processes of the last year\r\n      and a half seemed stale and futile\xe2\x80\x94a petty consummation of\r\n      himself... and like a sombre background lay that incident of the\r\n      spring before, that filled half his nights with a dreary terror\r\n      and made him unable to pray. He was not even a Catholic, yet that\r\n      was the only ghost of a code that he had, the gaudy, ritualistic,\r\n      paradoxical Catholicism whose prophet was Chesterton, whose\r\n      claqueurs were such reformed rakes of literature as Huysmans and\r\n      Bourget, whose American sponsor was Ralph Adams Cram, with his\r\n      adulation of thirteenth-century cathedrals\xe2\x80\x94a Catholicism which\r\n      Amory found convenient and ready-made, without priest or\r\n      sacraments or sacrifice.\r\n\r\n      He could not sleep, so he turned on his reading-lamp and, taking\r\n      down the \xe2\x80\x9cKreutzer Sonata,\xe2\x80\x9d searched it carefully for the germs\r\n      of Burne\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm. Being Burne was suddenly so much realler\r\n      than being clever. Yet he sighed... here were other possible clay\r\n      feet.\r\n\r\n      He thought back through two years, of Burne as a hurried, nervous\r\n      freshman, quite submerged in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s personality. Then he\r\n      remembered an incident of sophomore year, in which Burne had been\r\n      suspected of the leading role.\r\n\r\n      Dean Hollister had been heard by a large group arguing with a\r\n      taxi-driver, who had driven him from the junction. In the course\r\n      of the altercation the dean remarked that he \xe2\x80\x9cmight as well buy\r\n      the taxicab.\xe2\x80\x9d He paid and walked off, but next morning he entered\r\n      his private office to find the taxicab itself in the space\r\n      usually occupied by his desk, bearing a sign which read \xe2\x80\x9cProperty\r\n      of Dean Hollister. Bought and Paid for.\xe2\x80\x9d... It took two expert\r\n      mechanics half a day to dissemble it into its minutest parts and\r\n      remove it, which only goes to prove the rare energy of sophomore\r\n      humor under efficient leadership.\r\n\r\n      Then again, that very fall, Burne had caused a sensation. A\r\n      certain Phyllis Styles, an intercollegiate prom-trotter, had\r\n      failed to get her yearly invitation to the Harvard-Princeton\r\n      game.\r\n\r\n      Jesse Ferrenby had brought her to a smaller game a few weeks\r\n      before, and had pressed Burne into service\xe2\x80\x94to the ruination of\r\n      the latter\xe2\x80\x99s misogyny.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAre you coming to the Harvard game?\xe2\x80\x9d Burne had asked\r\n      indiscreetly, merely to make conversation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Phyllis quickly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Burne feebly. He was unversed in the arts\r\n      of Phyllis, and was sure that this was merely a vapid form of\r\n      kidding. Before an hour had passed he knew that he was indeed\r\n      involved. Phyllis had pinned him down and served him up, informed\r\n      him the train she was arriving by, and depressed him thoroughly.\r\n      Aside from loathing Phyllis, he had particularly wanted to stag\r\n      that game and entertain some Harvard friends.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d he informed a delegation who arrived in his room to\r\n      josh him. \xe2\x80\x9cThis will be the last game she ever persuades any\r\n      young innocent to take her to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Burne\xe2\x80\x94why did you _invite_ her if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBurne, you _know_ you\xe2\x80\x99re secretly mad about her\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\n      _real_ trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can _you_ do, Burne? What can _you_ do against Phyllis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      But Burne only shook his head and muttered threats which\r\n      consisted largely of the phrase: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll see, she\xe2\x80\x99ll see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The blithesome Phyllis bore her twenty-five summers gayly from\r\n      the train, but on the platform a ghastly sight met her eyes.\r\n      There were Burne and Fred Sloane arrayed to the last dot like the\r\n      lurid figures on college posters. They had bought flaring suits\r\n      with huge peg-top trousers and gigantic padded shoulders. On\r\n      their heads were rakish college hats, pinned up in front and\r\n      sporting bright orange-and-black bands, while from their\r\n      celluloid collars blossomed flaming orange ties. They wore black\r\n      arm-bands with orange \xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d and carried canes flying Princeton\r\n      pennants, the effect completed by socks and peeping handkerchiefs\r\n      in the same color motifs. On a clanking chain they led a large,\r\n      angry tom-cat, painted to represent a tiger.\r\n\r\n      A good half of the station crowd was already staring at them,\r\n      torn between horrified pity and riotous mirth, and as Phyllis,\r\n      with her svelte jaw dropping, approached, the pair bent over and\r\n      emitted a college cheer in loud, far-carrying voices,\r\n      thoughtfully adding the name \xe2\x80\x9cPhyllis\xe2\x80\x9d to the end. She was\r\n      vociferously greeted and escorted enthusiastically across the\r\n      campus, followed by half a hundred village urchins\xe2\x80\x94to the stifled\r\n      laughter of hundreds of alumni and visitors, half of whom had no\r\n      idea that this was a practical joke, but thought that Burne and\r\n      Fred were two varsity sports showing their girl a collegiate\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n      Phyllis\xe2\x80\x99s feelings as she was paraded by the Harvard and\r\n      Princeton stands, where sat dozens of her former devotees, can be\r\n      imagined. She tried to walk a little ahead, she tried to walk a\r\n      little behind\xe2\x80\x94but they stayed close, that there should be no\r\n      doubt whom she was with, talking in loud voices of their friends\r\n      on the football team, until she could almost hear her\r\n      acquaintances whispering:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPhyllis Styles must be _awfully hard up_ to have to come with\r\n      _those two_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      That had been Burne, dynamically humorous, fundamentally serious.\r\n      From that root had blossomed the energy that he was now trying to\r\n      orient with progress....\r\n\r\n      So the weeks passed and March came and the clay feet that Amory\r\n      looked for failed to appear. About a hundred juniors and seniors\r\n      resigned from their clubs in a final fury of righteousness, and\r\n      the clubs in helplessness turned upon Burne their finest weapon:\r\n      ridicule. Every one who knew him liked him\xe2\x80\x94but what he stood for\r\n      (and he began to stand for more all the time) came under the lash\r\n      of many tongues, until a frailer man than he would have been\r\n      snowed under.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you mind losing prestige?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Amory one night. They had\r\n      taken to exchanging calls several times a week.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I don\xe2\x80\x99t. What\xe2\x80\x99s prestige, at best?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSome people say that you\xe2\x80\x99re just a rather original politician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Fred Sloane told me to-day. I suppose I have it\r\n      coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      One afternoon they dipped into a subject that had interested\r\n      Amory for a long time\xe2\x80\x94the matter of the bearing of physical\r\n      attributes on a man\xe2\x80\x99s make-up. Burne had gone into the biology of\r\n      this, and then:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course health counts\xe2\x80\x94a healthy man has twice the chance of\r\n      being good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in \xe2\x80\x98muscular\r\n      Christianity.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI do\xe2\x80\x94I believe Christ had great physical vigor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory protested. \xe2\x80\x9cHe worked too hard for that. I\r\n      imagine that when he died he was a broken-down man\xe2\x80\x94and the great\r\n      saints haven\xe2\x80\x99t been strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHalf of them have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, even granting that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think health has anything to\r\n      do with goodness; of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s valuable to a great saint to be\r\n      able to stand enormous strains, but this fad of popular preachers\r\n      rising on their toes in simulated virility, bellowing that\r\n      calisthenics will save the world\xe2\x80\x94no, Burne, I can\xe2\x80\x99t go that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s waive it\xe2\x80\x94we won\xe2\x80\x99t get anywhere, and besides I\r\n      haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite made up my mind about it myself. Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      something I _do_ know\xe2\x80\x94personal appearance has a lot to do with\r\n      it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cColoring?\xe2\x80\x9d Amory asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Tom and I figured,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe took the\r\n      year-books for the last ten years and looked at the pictures of\r\n      the senior council. I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of that august\r\n      body, but it does represent success here in a general way. Well,\r\n      I suppose only about thirty-five per cent of every class here are\r\n      blonds, are really light\xe2\x80\x94yet _two-thirds_ of every senior council\r\n      are light. We looked at pictures of ten years of them, mind you;\r\n      that means that out of every _fifteen_ light-haired men in the\r\n      senior class _one_ is on the senior council, and of the\r\n      dark-haired men it\xe2\x80\x99s only one in _fifty_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d Burne agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe light-haired man _is_ a higher\r\n      type, generally speaking. I worked the thing out with the\r\n      Presidents of the United States once, and found that way over\r\n      half of them were light-haired\xe2\x80\x94yet think of the preponderant\r\n      number of brunettes in the race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPeople unconsciously admit it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll notice a\r\n      blond person is _expected_ to talk. If a blond girl doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk\r\n      we call her a \xe2\x80\x98doll\xe2\x80\x99; if a light-haired man is silent he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      considered stupid. Yet the world is full of \xe2\x80\x98dark silent men\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98languorous brunettes\xe2\x80\x99 who haven\xe2\x80\x99t a brain in their heads, but\r\n      somehow are never accused of the dearth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the large mouth and broad chin and rather big nose\r\n      undoubtedly make the superior face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure.\xe2\x80\x9d Amory was all for classical features.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you,\xe2\x80\x9d and Burne pulled out of his desk a\r\n      photographic collection of heavily bearded, shaggy\r\n      celebrities\xe2\x80\x94Tolstoi, Whitman, Carpenter, and others.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t they wonderful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory tried politely to appreciate them, and gave up laughingly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBurne, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re the ugliest-looking crowd I ever came\r\n      across. They look like an old man\xe2\x80\x99s home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Amory, look at that forehead on Emerson; look at Tolstoi\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d His tone was reproachful.\r\n\r\n      Amory shook his head.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Call them remarkable-looking or anything you want\xe2\x80\x94but ugly\r\n      they certainly are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Unabashed, Burne ran his hand lovingly across the spacious\r\n      foreheads, and piling up the pictures put them back in his desk.\r\n\r\n      Walking at night was one of his favorite pursuits, and one night\r\n      he persuaded Amory to accompany him.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI hate the dark,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory objected. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t use to\xe2\x80\x94except when I\r\n      was particularly imaginative, but now, I really do\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m a regular\r\n      fool about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s useless, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cQuite possibly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go east,\xe2\x80\x9d Burne suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cand down that string of roads\r\n      through the woods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound very appealing to me,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Amory reluctantly,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cbut let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They set off at a good gait, and for an hour swung along in a\r\n      brisk argument until the lights of Princeton were luminous white\r\n      blots behind them.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAny person with any imagination is bound to be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\n      Burne earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this very walking at night is one of the\r\n      things I was afraid about. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you why I can walk\r\n      anywhere now and not be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory urged eagerly. They were striding toward the\r\n      woods, Burne\xe2\x80\x99s nervous, enthusiastic voice warming to his\r\n      subject.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI used to come out here alone at night, oh, three months ago,\r\n      and I always stopped at that cross-road we just passed. There\r\n      were the woods looming up ahead, just as they do now, there were\r\n      dogs howling and the shadows and no human sound. Of course, I\r\n      peopled the woods with everything ghastly, just like you do;\r\n      don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory admitted.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I began analyzing it\xe2\x80\x94my imagination persisted in sticking\r\n      horrors into the dark\xe2\x80\x94so I stuck my imagination into the dark\r\n      instead, and let it look out at me\xe2\x80\x94I let it play stray dog or\r\n      escaped convict or ghost, and then saw myself coming along the\r\n      road. That made it all right\xe2\x80\x94as it always makes everything all\r\n      right to project yourself completely into another\xe2\x80\x99s place. I knew\r\n      that if I were the dog or the convict or the ghost I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\n      a menace to Burne Holiday any more than he was a menace to me.\r\n      Then I thought of my watch. I\xe2\x80\x99d better go back and leave it and\r\n      then essay the woods. No; I decided, it\xe2\x80\x99s better on the whole\r\n      that I should lose a watch than that I should turn back\xe2\x80\x94and I did\r\n      go into them\xe2\x80\x94not only followed the road through them, but walked\r\n      into them until I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t frightened any more\xe2\x80\x94did it until one\r\n      night I sat down and dozed off in there; then I knew I was\r\n      through being afraid of the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLordy,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory breathed. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done that. I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\n      come out half-way, and the first time an automobile passed and\r\n      made the dark thicker when its lamps disappeared, I\xe2\x80\x99d have come\r\n      in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Burne said suddenly, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 silence, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re\r\n      half-way through, let\xe2\x80\x99s turn back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      On the return he launched into a discussion of will.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the whole thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he asserted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the one dividing line\r\n      between good and evil. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met a man who led a rotten life\r\n      and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a weak will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow about great criminals?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re usually insane. If not, they\xe2\x80\x99re weak. There is no such\r\n      thing as a strong, sane criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBurne, I disagree with you altogether; how about the superman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s evil, I think, yet he\xe2\x80\x99s strong and sane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never met him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet, though, that he\xe2\x80\x99s stupid or\r\n      insane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve met him over and over and he\xe2\x80\x99s neither. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I think\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m not\xe2\x80\x94and so I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in imprisonment except\r\n      for the insane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      On this point Amory could not agree. It seemed to him that life\r\n      and history were rife with the strong criminal, keen, but often\r\n      self-deluding; in politics and business one found him and among\r\n      the old statesmen and kings and generals; but Burne never agreed\r\n      and their courses began to split on that point.\r\n\r\n      Burne was drawing farther and farther away from the world about\r\n      him. He resigned the vice-presidency of the senior class and took\r\n      to reading and walking as almost his only pursuits. He\r\n      voluntarily attended graduate lectures in philosophy and biology,\r\n      and sat in all of them with a rather pathetically intent look in\r\n      his eyes, as if waiting for something the lecturer would never\r\n      quite come to. Sometimes Amory would see him squirm in his seat;\r\n      and his face would light up; he was on fire to debate a point.\r\n\r\n      He grew more abstracted on the street and was even accused of\r\n      becoming a snob, but Amory knew it was nothing of the sort, and\r\n      once when Burne passed him four feet off, absolutely unseeingly,\r\n      his mind a thousand miles away, Amory almost choked with the\r\n      romantic joy of watching him. Burne seemed to be climbing heights\r\n      where others would be forever unable to get a foothold.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory declared to Tom, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s the first contemporary\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met whom I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit is my superior in mental capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bad time to admit it\xe2\x80\x94people are beginning to think he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      odd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s way over their heads\xe2\x80\x94you know you think so yourself when\r\n      you talk to him\xe2\x80\x94Good Lord, Tom, you _used_ to stand out against\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98people.\xe2\x80\x99 Success has completely conventionalized you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom grew rather annoyed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he trying to do\xe2\x80\x94be excessively holy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo! not like anybody you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. Never enters the\r\n      Philadelphian Society. He has no faith in that rot. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      believe that public swimming-pools and a kind word in time will\r\n      right the wrongs of the world; moreover, he takes a drink\r\n      whenever he feels like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe certainly is getting in wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHave you talked to him lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThen you haven\xe2\x80\x99t any conception of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The argument ended nowhere, but Amory noticed more than ever how\r\n      the sentiment toward Burne had changed on the campus.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s odd,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory said to Tom one night when they had grown more\r\n      amicable on the subject, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the people who violently\r\n      disapprove of Burne\xe2\x80\x99s radicalism are distinctly the Pharisee\r\n      class\xe2\x80\x94I mean they\xe2\x80\x99re the best-educated men in college\xe2\x80\x94the editors\r\n      of the papers, like yourself and Ferrenby, the younger\r\n      professors.... The illiterate athletes like Langueduc think he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      getting eccentric, but they just say, \xe2\x80\x98Good old Burne has got\r\n      some queer ideas in his head,\xe2\x80\x99 and pass on\xe2\x80\x94the Pharisee\r\n      class\xe2\x80\x94Gee! they ridicule him unmercifully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The next morning he met Burne hurrying along McCosh walk after a\r\n      recitation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhither bound, Tsar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOver to the Prince office to see Ferrenby,\xe2\x80\x9d he waved a copy of\r\n      the morning\xe2\x80\x99s Princetonian at Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wrote this editorial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGoing to flay him alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94but he\xe2\x80\x99s got me all balled up. Either I\xe2\x80\x99ve misjudged him or\r\n      he\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly become the world\xe2\x80\x99s worst radical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Burne hurried on, and it was several days before Amory heard an\r\n      account of the ensuing conversation. Burne had come into the\r\n      editor\xe2\x80\x99s sanctum displaying the paper cheerfully.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Jesse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello there, Savonarola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI just read your editorial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood boy\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you stooped that low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cJesse, you startled me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid the faculty\xe2\x80\x99ll get after you if you pull this\r\n      irreligious stuff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLike this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil\xe2\x80\x94that editorial was on the coaching system.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that quotation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Jesse sat up.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat quotation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou know: \xe2\x80\x98He who is not with me is against me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94what about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Jesse was puzzled but not alarmed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you say here\xe2\x80\x94let me see.\xe2\x80\x9d Burne opened the paper and read:\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_He who is not with me is against me_, as that gentleman said\r\n      who was notoriously capable of only coarse distinctions and\r\n      puerile generalities.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it?\xe2\x80\x9d Ferrenby began to look alarmed. \xe2\x80\x9cOliver Cromwell\r\n      said it, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he? or was it Washington, or one of the saints?\r\n      Good Lord, I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Burne roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jesse, oh, good, kind Jesse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWho said it, for Pete\xe2\x80\x99s sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Burne, recovering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Matthew attributes\r\n      it to Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jesse, and collapsed backward into the\r\n      waste-basket.\r\n\r\n\r\n      AMORY WRITES A POEM\r\n\r\n      The weeks tore by. Amory wandered occasionally to New York on the\r\n      chance of finding a new shining green auto-bus, that its\r\n      stick-of-candy glamour might penetrate his disposition. One day\r\n      he ventured into a stock-company revival of a play whose name was\r\n      faintly familiar. The curtain rose\xe2\x80\x94he watched casually as a girl\r\n      entered. A few phrases rang in his ear and touched a faint chord\r\n      of memory. Where\xe2\x80\x94? When\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\n      Then he seemed to hear a voice whispering beside him, a very\r\n      soft, vibrant voice: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m such a poor little fool; _do_ tell\r\n      me when I do wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The solution came in a flash and he had a quick, glad memory of\r\n      Isabelle.\r\n\r\n      He found a blank space on his programme, and began to scribble\r\n      rapidly:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cHere in the figured dark I watch once more, There, with the\r\n   curtain, roll the years away; Two years of years\xe2\x80\x94there was an idle\r\n   day Of ours, when happy endings didn\xe2\x80\x99t bore Our unfermented souls; I\r\n   could adore Your eager face beside me, wide-eyed, gay, Smiling a\r\n   repertoire while the poor play Reached me as a faint ripple reaches\r\n   shore.\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cYawning and wondering an evening through, I watch alone... and\r\n   chatterings, of course, Spoil the one scene which, somehow, _did_\r\n   have charms; You wept a bit, and I grew sad for you Right here! \r\n   Where Mr. X defends divorce And What\xe2\x80\x99s-Her-Name falls fainting in\r\n   his arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      STILL CALM\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGhosts are such dumb things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alec, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re slow-witted. I\r\n      can always outguess a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tom.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it depends where. Take a bedroom, for example. If you use\r\n      _any_ discretion a ghost can never get you in a bedroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, s\xe2\x80\x99pose you think there\xe2\x80\x99s maybe a ghost in your\r\n      bedroom\xe2\x80\x94what measures do you take on getting home at night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      demanded Amory, interested.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTake a stick\xe2\x80\x9d answered Alec, with ponderous reverence, \xe2\x80\x9cone\r\n      about the length of a broom-handle. Now, the first thing to do is\r\n      to get the room _cleared_\xe2\x80\x94to do this you rush with your eyes\r\n      closed into your study and turn on the lights\xe2\x80\x94next, approaching\r\n      the closet, carefully run the stick in the door three or four\r\n      times. Then, if nothing happens, you can look in. _Always,\r\n      always_ run the stick in viciously first\xe2\x80\x94_never_ look first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, that\xe2\x80\x99s the ancient Celtic school,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom gravely.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94but they usually pray first. Anyway, you use this method to\r\n      clear the closets and also for behind all doors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the bed,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory suggested.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Amory, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Alec in horror. \xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      bed requires different tactics\xe2\x80\x94let the bed alone, as you value\r\n      your reason\xe2\x80\x94if there is a ghost in the room and that\xe2\x80\x99s only about\r\n      a third of the time, it is _almost always_ under the bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x9d Amory began.\r\n\r\n      Alec waved him into silence.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf _course_ you never look. You stand in the middle of the floor\r\n      and before he knows what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do make a sudden leap\r\n      for the bed\xe2\x80\x94never walk near the bed; to a ghost your ankle is\r\n      your most vulnerable part\xe2\x80\x94once in bed, you\xe2\x80\x99re safe; he may lie\r\n      around under the bed all night, but you\xe2\x80\x99re safe as daylight. If\r\n      you still have doubts pull the blanket over your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll that\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Alec beamed proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll my own, too\xe2\x80\x94the Sir Oliver\r\n      Lodge of the new world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory was enjoying college immensely again. The sense of going\r\n      forward in a direct, determined line had come back; youth was\r\n      stirring and shaking out a few new feathers. He had even stored\r\n      enough surplus energy to sally into a new pose.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the idea of all this \xe2\x80\x98distracted\xe2\x80\x99 stuff, Amory?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\n      Alec one day, and then as Amory pretended to be cramped over his\r\n      book in a daze: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to act Burne, the mystic, to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory looked up innocently.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d mimicked Alec. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you trying to read yourself into a\r\n      rhapsody with\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s see the book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He snatched it; regarded it derisively.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory a little stiffly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Life of St. Teresa,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d read Alec aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my gosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Alec.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it bother you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDoes what bother me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy acting dazed and all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no\xe2\x80\x94of course it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t _bother_ me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, don\xe2\x80\x99t spoil it. If I enjoy going around telling\r\n      people guilelessly that I think I\xe2\x80\x99m a genius, let me do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting a reputation for being eccentric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alec,\r\n      laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cif that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory finally prevailed, and Alec agreed to accept his face value\r\n      in the presence of others if he was allowed rest periods when\r\n      they were alone; so Amory \xe2\x80\x9cran it out\xe2\x80\x9d at a great rate, bringing\r\n      the most eccentric characters to dinner, wild-eyed grad students,\r\n      preceptors with strange theories of God and government, to the\r\n      cynical amazement of the supercilious Cottage Club.\r\n\r\n      As February became slashed by sun and moved cheerfully into\r\n      March, Amory went several times to spend week-ends with\r\n      Monsignor; once he took Burne, with great success, for he took\r\n      equal pride and delight in displaying them to each other.\r\n      Monsignor took him several times to see Thornton Hancock, and\r\n      once or twice to the house of a Mrs. Lawrence, a type of\r\n      Rome-haunting American whom Amory liked immediately.\r\n\r\n      Then one day came a letter from Monsignor, which appended an\r\n      interesting P. S.:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d it ran, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your third cousin, Clara Page, widowed\r\n  six months and very poor, is living in Philadelphia? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\n  you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met her, but I wish, as a favor to me, you\xe2\x80\x99d go to see\r\n  her.  To my mind, she\xe2\x80\x99s rather a remarkable woman, and just about\r\n  your age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory sighed and decided to go, as a favor....\r\n\r\n\r\n      CLARA\r\n\r\n      She was immemorial.... Amory wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for Clara, Clara\r\n      of ripply golden hair, but then no man was. Her goodness was\r\n      above the prosy morals of the husband-seeker, apart from the dull\r\n      literature of female virtue.\r\n\r\n      Sorrow lay lightly around her, and when Amory found her in\r\n      Philadelphia he thought her steely blue eyes held only happiness;\r\n      a latent strength, a realism, was brought to its fullest\r\n      development by the facts that she was compelled to face. She was\r\n      alone in the world, with two small children, little money, and,\r\n      worst of all, a host of friends. He saw her that winter in\r\n      Philadelphia entertaining a houseful of men for an evening, when\r\n      he knew she had not a servant in the house except the little\r\n      colored girl guarding the babies overhead. He saw one of the\r\n      greatest libertines in that city, a man who was habitually drunk\r\n      and notorious at home and abroad, sitting opposite her for an\r\n      evening, discussing _girls\xe2\x80\x99 boarding-schools_ with a sort of\r\n      innocent excitement. What a twist Clara had to her mind! She\r\n      could make fascinating and almost brilliant conversation out of\r\n      the thinnest air that ever floated through a drawing-room.\r\n\r\n      The idea that the girl was poverty-stricken had appealed to\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s sense of situation. He arrived in Philadelphia expecting\r\n      to be told that 921 Ark Street was in a miserable lane of hovels.\r\n      He was even disappointed when it proved to be nothing of the\r\n      sort. It was an old house that had been in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\n      for years. An elderly aunt, who objected to having it sold, had\r\n      put ten years\xe2\x80\x99 taxes with a lawyer and pranced off to Honolulu,\r\n      leaving Clara to struggle with the heating-problem as best she\r\n      could. So no wild-haired woman with a hungry baby at her breast\r\n      and a sad Amelia-like look greeted him. Instead, Amory would have\r\n      thought from his reception that she had not a care in the world.\r\n\r\n      A calm virility and a dreamy humor, marked contrasts to her\r\n      level-headedness\xe2\x80\x94into these moods she slipped sometimes as a\r\n      refuge. She could do the most prosy things (though she was wise\r\n      enough never to stultify herself with such \xe2\x80\x9chousehold arts\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\n      _knitting_ and _embroidery_), yet immediately afterward pick up a\r\n      book and let her imagination rove as a formless cloud with the\r\n      wind. Deepest of all in her personality was the golden radiance\r\n      that she diffused around her. As an open fire in a dark room\r\n      throws romance and pathos into the quiet faces at its edge, so\r\n      she cast her lights and shadows around the rooms that held her,\r\n      until she made of her prosy old uncle a man of quaint and\r\n      meditative charm, metamorphosed the stray telegraph boy into a\r\n      Puck-like creature of delightful originality. At first this\r\n      quality of hers somehow irritated Amory. He considered his own\r\n      uniqueness sufficient, and it rather embarrassed him when she\r\n      tried to read new interests into him for the benefit of what\r\n      other adorers were present. He felt as if a polite but insistent\r\n      stage-manager were attempting to make him give a new\r\n      interpretation of a part he had conned for years.\r\n\r\n      But Clara talking, Clara telling a slender tale of a hatpin and\r\n      an inebriated man and herself.... People tried afterward to\r\n      repeat her anecdotes but for the life of them they could make\r\n      them sound like nothing whatever. They gave her a sort of\r\n      innocent attention and the best smiles many of them had smiled\r\n      for long; there were few tears in Clara, but people smiled\r\n      misty-eyed at her.\r\n\r\n      Very occasionally Amory stayed for little half-hours after the\r\n      rest of the court had gone, and they would have bread and jam and\r\n      tea late in the afternoon or \xe2\x80\x9cmaple-sugar lunches,\xe2\x80\x9d as she called\r\n      them, at night.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ remarkable, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you!\xe2\x80\x9d Amory was becoming trite from\r\n      where he perched in the centre of the dining-room table one six\r\n      o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. She was searching out napkins in the\r\n      sideboard. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really most humdrum and commonplace. One of those\r\n      people who have no interest in anything but their children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTell that to somebody else,\xe2\x80\x9d scoffed Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\n      perfectly effulgent.\xe2\x80\x9d He asked her the one thing that he knew\r\n      might embarrass her. It was the remark that the first bore made\r\n      to Adam.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d And she gave the answer that Adam must\r\n      have given.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      But eventually Adam probably told the bore all the things he\r\n      thought about at night when the locusts sang in the sandy grass,\r\n      and he must have remarked patronizingly how _different_ he was\r\n      from Eve, forgetting how different she was from him... at any\r\n      rate, Clara told Amory much about herself that evening. She had\r\n      had a harried life from sixteen on, and her education had stopped\r\n      sharply with her leisure. Browsing in her library, Amory found a\r\n      tattered gray book out of which fell a yellow sheet that he\r\n      impudently opened. It was a poem that she had written at school\r\n      about a gray convent wall on a gray day, and a girl with her\r\n      cloak blown by the wind sitting atop of it and thinking about the\r\n      many-colored world. As a rule such sentiment bored him, but this\r\n      was done with so much simplicity and atmosphere, that it brought\r\n      a picture of Clara to his mind, of Clara on such a cool, gray day\r\n      with her keen blue eyes staring out, trying to see her tragedies\r\n      come marching over the gardens outside. He envied that poem. How\r\n      he would have loved to have come along and seen her on the wall\r\n      and talked nonsense or romance to her, perched above him in the\r\n      air. He began to be frightfully jealous of everything about\r\n      Clara: of her past, of her babies, of the men and women who\r\n      flocked to drink deep of her cool kindness and rest their tired\r\n      minds as at an absorbing play.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c_Nobody_ seems to bore you,\xe2\x80\x9d he objected.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAbout half the world do,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\n      pretty good average, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d and she turned to find something\r\n      in Browning that bore on the subject. She was the only person he\r\n      ever met who could look up passages and quotations to show him in\r\n      the middle of the conversation, and yet not be irritating to\r\n      distraction. She did it constantly, with such a serious\r\n      enthusiasm that he grew fond of watching her golden hair bent\r\n      over a book, brow wrinkled ever so little at hunting her\r\n      sentence.\r\n\r\n      Through early March he took to going to Philadelphia for\r\n      week-ends. Almost always there was some one else there and she\r\n      seemed not anxious to see him alone, for many occasions presented\r\n      themselves when a word from her would have given him another\r\n      delicious half-hour of adoration. But he fell gradually in love\r\n      and began to speculate wildly on marriage. Though this design\r\n      flowed through his brain even to his lips, still he knew\r\n      afterward that the desire had not been deeply rooted. Once he\r\n      dreamt that it had come true and woke up in a cold panic, for in\r\n      his dream she had been a silly, flaxen Clara, with the gold gone\r\n      out of her hair and platitudes falling insipidly from her\r\n      changeling tongue. But she was the first fine woman he ever knew\r\n      and one of the few good people who ever interested him. She made\r\n      her goodness such an asset. Amory had decided that most good\r\n      people either dragged theirs after them as a liability, or else\r\n      distorted it to artificial geniality, and of course there were\r\n      the ever-present prig and Pharisee\xe2\x80\x94(but Amory never included\r\n      _them_ as being among the saved).\r\n\r\n\r\n      ST. CECILIA\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cOver her gray and velvet dress, Under her molten, beaten hair,\r\n   Color of rose in mock distress Flushes and fades and makes her fair;\r\n   Fills the air from her to him With light and languor and little\r\n   sighs, Just so subtly he scarcely knows... Laughing lightning, color\r\n   of rose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo you like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clara seriously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we have some qualities in common. Things that are\r\n      spontaneous in each of us\xe2\x80\x94or were originally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re implying that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t used myself very well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Clara hesitated.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t judge. A man, of course, has to go through a lot\r\n      more, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sheltered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t stall, please, Clara,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory interrupted; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do talk\r\n      about me a little, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSurely, I\xe2\x80\x99d adore to.\xe2\x80\x9d She didn\xe2\x80\x99t smile.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s sweet of you. First answer some questions. Am I painfully\r\n      conceited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94no, you have tremendous vanity, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll amuse the people\r\n      who notice its preponderance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re really humble at heart. You sink to the third hell of\r\n      depression when you think you\xe2\x80\x99ve been slighted. In fact, you\r\n      haven\xe2\x80\x99t much self-respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCentre of target twice, Clara. How do you do it? You never let\r\n      me say a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not\xe2\x80\x94I can never judge a man while he\xe2\x80\x99s talking. But\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99m not through; the reason you have so little real\r\n      self-confidence, even though you gravely announce to the\r\n      occasional philistine that you think you\xe2\x80\x99re a genius, is that\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x99ve attributed all sorts of atrocious faults to yourself and\r\n      are trying to live up to them. For instance, you\xe2\x80\x99re always saying\r\n      that you are a slave to high-balls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am, potentially.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you say you\xe2\x80\x99re a weak character, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve no will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of will\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m a slave to my emotions, to my likes, to my\r\n      hatred of boredom, to most of my desires\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not!\xe2\x80\x9d She brought one little fist down onto the other.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a slave, a bound helpless slave to one thing in the\r\n      world, your imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly interest me. If this isn\xe2\x80\x99t boring you, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI notice that when you want to stay over an extra day from\r\n      college you go about it in a sure way. You never decide at first\r\n      while the merits of going or staying are fairly clear in your\r\n      mind. You let your imagination shinny on the side of your desires\r\n      for a few hours, and then you decide. Naturally your imagination,\r\n      after a little freedom, thinks up a million reasons why you\r\n      should stay, so your decision when it comes isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      biassed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Amory, \xe2\x80\x9cbut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it lack of will-power to let my\r\n      imagination shinny on the wrong side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, there\xe2\x80\x99s your big mistake. This has nothing to do\r\n      with will-power; that\xe2\x80\x99s a crazy, useless word, anyway; you lack\r\n      judgment\xe2\x80\x94the judgment to decide at once when you know your\r\n      imagination will play you false, given half a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be darned!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Amory in surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\n      last thing I expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Clara didn\xe2\x80\x99t gloat. She changed the subject immediately. But she\r\n      had started him thinking and he believed she was partly right. He\r\n      felt like a factory-owner who after accusing a clerk of\r\n      dishonesty finds that his own son, in the office, is changing the\r\n      books once a week. His poor, mistreated will that he had been\r\n      holding up to the scorn of himself and his friends, stood before\r\n      him innocent, and his judgment walked off to prison with the\r\n      unconfinable imp, imagination, dancing in mocking glee beside\r\n      him. Clara\xe2\x80\x99s was the only advice he ever asked without dictating\r\n      the answer himself\xe2\x80\x94except, perhaps, in his talks with Monsignor\r\n      Darcy.\r\n\r\n      How he loved to do any sort of thing with Clara! Shopping with\r\n      her was a rare, epicurean dream. In every store where she had\r\n      ever traded she was whispered about as the beautiful Mrs. Page.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet she won\xe2\x80\x99t stay single long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t scream it out. She ain\xe2\x80\x99t lookin\xe2\x80\x99 for no advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c_Ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ she beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n   (Enter a floor-walker\xe2\x80\x94silence till he moves forward, smirking.)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSociety person, ain\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, but poor now, I guess; so they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGee! girls, _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ she some kid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      And Clara beamed on all alike. Amory believed that tradespeople\r\n      gave her discounts, sometimes to her knowledge and sometimes\r\n      without it. He knew she dressed very well, had always the best of\r\n      everything in the house, and was inevitably waited upon by the\r\n      head floor-walker at the very least.\r\n\r\n      Sometimes they would go to church together on Sunday and he would\r\n      walk beside her and revel in her cheeks moist from the soft water\r\n      in the new air. She was very devout, always had been, and God\r\n      knows what heights she attained and what strength she drew down\r\n      to herself when she knelt and bent her golden hair into the\r\n      stained-glass light.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Cecelia,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried aloud one day, quite involuntarily, and\r\n      the people turned and peered, and the priest paused in his sermon\r\n      and Clara and Amory turned to fiery red.\r\n\r\n      That was the last Sunday they had, for he spoiled it all that\r\n      night. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\r\n\r\n      They were walking through the March twilight where it was as warm\r\n      as June, and the joy of youth filled his soul so that he felt he\r\n      must speak.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and his voice trembled, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if I lost faith\r\n      in you I\xe2\x80\x99d lose faith in God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She looked at him with such a startled face that he asked her the\r\n      matter.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly, \xe2\x80\x9conly this: five men have said that\r\n      to me before, and it frightens me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Clara, is that your fate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She did not answer.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose love to you is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n      She turned like a flash.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI have never been in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They walked along, and he realized slowly how much she had told\r\n      him... never in love.... She seemed suddenly a daughter of light\r\n      alone. His entity dropped out of her plane and he longed only to\r\n      touch her dress with almost the realization that Joseph must have\r\n      had of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s eternal significance. But quite mechanically he\r\n      heard himself saying:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I love you\xe2\x80\x94any latent greatness that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got is... oh, I\r\n      can\xe2\x80\x99t talk, but Clara, if I come back in two years in a position\r\n      to marry you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She shook her head.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d never marry again. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my two children\r\n      and I want myself for them. I like you\xe2\x80\x94I like all clever men, you\r\n      more than any\xe2\x80\x94but you know me well enough to know that I\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\n      marry a clever man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off suddenly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not in love with me. You never wanted to marry me, did\r\n      you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel as\r\n      though I were speaking aloud. But I love you\xe2\x80\x94or adore you\xe2\x80\x94or\r\n      worship you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere you go\xe2\x80\x94running through your catalogue of emotions in five\r\n      seconds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He smiled unwillingly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make me out such a light-weight, Clara; you _are_\r\n      depressing sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a light-weight, of all things,\xe2\x80\x9d she said intently,\r\n      taking his arm and opening wide her eyes\xe2\x80\x94he could see their\r\n      kindliness in the fading dusk. \xe2\x80\x9cA light-weight is an eternal\r\n      nay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s so much spring in the air\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s so much lazy sweetness\r\n      in your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She dropped his arm.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re all fine now, and I feel glorious. Give me a cigarette.\r\n      You\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen me smoke, have you? Well, I do, about once a\r\n      month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      And then that wonderful girl and Amory raced to the corner like\r\n      two mad children gone wild with pale-blue twilight.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to the country for to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced, as she\r\n      stood panting, safe beyond the flare of the corner lamp-post.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThese days are too magnificent to miss, though perhaps I feel\r\n      them more in the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Clara!\xe2\x80\x9d Amory said; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a devil you could have been if the\r\n      Lord had just bent your soul a little the other way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think not. I\xe2\x80\x99m never really wild\r\n      and never have been. That little outburst was pure spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n      They were walking along now.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong again, how can a person of your own self-reputed\r\n      brains be so constantly wrong about me? I\xe2\x80\x99m the opposite of\r\n      everything spring ever stood for. It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, if I happen\r\n      to look like what pleased some soppy old Greek sculptor, but I\r\n      assure you that if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for my face I\xe2\x80\x99d be a quiet nun in\r\n      the convent without\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then she broke into a run and her raised\r\n      voice floated back to him as he followed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy precious babies,\r\n      which I must go back and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She was the only girl he ever knew with whom he could understand\r\n      how another man might be preferred. Often Amory met wives whom he\r\n      had known as debutantes, and looking intently at them imagined\r\n      that he found something in their faces which said:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I could only have gotten _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, the enormous conceit\r\n      of the man!\r\n\r\n      But that night seemed a night of stars and singing and Clara\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      bright soul still gleamed on the ways they had trod.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGolden, golden is the air\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he chanted to the little pools of\r\n      water. ... \xe2\x80\x9cGolden is the air, golden notes from golden\r\n      mandolins, golden frets of golden violins, fair, oh, wearily\r\n      fair.... Skeins from braided basket, mortals may not hold; oh,\r\n      what young extravagant God, who would know or ask it?... who\r\n      could give such gold...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      AMORY IS RESENTFUL\r\n\r\n      Slowly and inevitably, yet with a sudden surge at the last, while\r\n      Amory talked and dreamed, war rolled swiftly up the beach and\r\n      washed the sands where Princeton played. Every night the\r\n      gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor\r\n      and shuffled out the basket-ball markings. When Amory went to\r\n      Washington the next week-end he caught some of the spirit of\r\n      crisis which changed to repulsion in the Pullman car coming back,\r\n      for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking\r\n      aliens\xe2\x80\x94Greeks, he guessed, or Russians. He thought how much\r\n      easier patriotism had been to a homogeneous race, how much easier\r\n      it would have been to fight as the Colonies fought, or as the\r\n      Confederacy fought. And he did no sleeping that night, but\r\n      listened to the aliens guffaw and snore while they filled the car\r\n      with the heavy scent of latest America.\r\n\r\n      In Princeton every one bantered in public and told themselves\r\n      privately that their deaths at least would be heroic. The\r\n      literary students read Rupert Brooke passionately; the\r\n      lounge-lizards worried over whether the government would permit\r\n      the English-cut uniform for officers; a few of the hopelessly\r\n      lazy wrote to the obscure branches of the War Department, seeking\r\n      an easy commission and a soft berth.\r\n\r\n      Then, after a week, Amory saw Burne and knew at once that\r\n      argument would be futile\xe2\x80\x94Burne had come out as a pacifist. The\r\n      socialist magazines, a great smattering of Tolstoi, and his own\r\n      intense longing for a cause that would bring out whatever\r\n      strength lay in him, had finally decided him to preach peace as a\r\n      subjective ideal.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the German army entered Belgium,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cif the\r\n      inhabitants had gone peaceably about their business, the German\r\n      army would have been disorganized in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it all. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\n      going to talk propaganda with you. There\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\n      right\xe2\x80\x94but even so we\xe2\x80\x99re hundreds of years before the time when\r\n      non-resistance can touch us as a reality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Amory, listen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBurne, we\xe2\x80\x99d just argue\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cJust one thing\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to think of your family or\r\n      friends, because I know they don\xe2\x80\x99t count a picayune with you\r\n      beside your sense of duty\xe2\x80\x94but, Burne, how do you know that the\r\n      magazines you read and the societies you join and these idealists\r\n      you meet aren\xe2\x80\x99t just plain _German?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSome of them are, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know they aren\xe2\x80\x99t _all_ pro-German\xe2\x80\x94just a lot of weak\r\n      ones\xe2\x80\x94with German-Jewish names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the chance, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much or how\r\n      little I\xe2\x80\x99m taking this stand because of propaganda I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, I\r\n      don\xe2\x80\x99t know; naturally I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s my most innermost\r\n      conviction\xe2\x80\x94it seems a path spread before me just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut think of the cheapness of it\xe2\x80\x94no one\xe2\x80\x99s really going to martyr\r\n      you for being a pacifist\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s just going to throw you in with the\r\n      worst\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it all smells of Bohemian New York to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI know what you mean, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll agitate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re one man, Burne\xe2\x80\x94going to talk to people who won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      listen\xe2\x80\x94with all God\xe2\x80\x99s given you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Stephen must have thought many years ago. But he\r\n      preached his sermon and they killed him. He probably thought as\r\n      he was dying what a waste it all was. But you see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always\r\n      felt that Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s death was the thing that occurred to Paul on\r\n      the road to Damascus, and sent him to preach the word of Christ\r\n      all over the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94this is my particular duty. Even if right now I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      just a pawn\xe2\x80\x94just sacrificed. God! Amory\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I like\r\n      the Germans!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything else\xe2\x80\x94I get to the end of all the\r\n      logic about non-resistance, and there, like an excluded middle,\r\n      stands the huge spectre of man as he is and always will be. And\r\n      this spectre stands right beside the one logical necessity of\r\n      Tolstoi\xe2\x80\x99s, and the other logical necessity of Nietzsche\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Amory\r\n      broke off suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going next week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      As he walked away it seemed to Amory that the look in his face\r\n      bore a great resemblance to that in Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s when he had said\r\n      good-by under Blair Arch two years before. Amory wondered\r\n      unhappily why he could never go into anything with the primal\r\n      honesty of those two.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBurne\xe2\x80\x99s a fanatic,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99s dead wrong and,\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to think, just an unconscious pawn in the hands of\r\n      anarchistic publishers and German-paid rag wavers\xe2\x80\x94but he haunts\r\n      me\xe2\x80\x94just leaving everything worth while\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Burne left in a quietly dramatic manner a week later. He sold all\r\n      his possessions and came down to the room to say good-by, with a\r\n      battered old bicycle, on which he intended to ride to his home in\r\n      Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPeter the Hermit bidding farewell to Cardinal Richelieu,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      suggested Alec, who was lounging in the window-seat as Burne and\r\n      Amory shook hands.\r\n\r\n      But Amory was not in a mood for that, and as he saw Burne\xe2\x80\x99s long\r\n      legs propel his ridiculous bicycle out of sight beyond Alexander\r\n      Hall, he knew he was going to have a bad week. Not that he\r\n      doubted the war\xe2\x80\x94Germany stood for everything repugnant to him;\r\n      for materialism and the direction of tremendous licentious force;\r\n      it was just that Burne\xe2\x80\x99s face stayed in his memory and he was\r\n      sick of the hysteria he was beginning to hear.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth is the use of suddenly running down Goethe,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n      declared to Alec and Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy write books to prove he started\r\n      the war\xe2\x80\x94or that that stupid, overestimated Schiller is a demon in\r\n      disguise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever read anything of theirs?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tom shrewdly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory admitted.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNeither have I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said laughing.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPeople will shout,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alec quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s on his same\r\n      old shelf in the library\xe2\x80\x94to bore any one that wants to read him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory subsided, and the subject dropped.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do, Amory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cInfantry or aviation, I can\xe2\x80\x99t make up my mind\xe2\x80\x94I hate mechanics,\r\n      but then of course aviation\xe2\x80\x99s the thing for me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI feel as Amory does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cInfantry or aviation\xe2\x80\x94aviation\r\n      sounds like the romantic side of the war, of course\xe2\x80\x94like cavalry\r\n      used to be, you know; but like Amory I don\xe2\x80\x99t know a horse-power\r\n      from a piston-rod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Somehow Amory\xe2\x80\x99s dissatisfaction with his lack of enthusiasm\r\n      culminated in an attempt to put the blame for the whole war on\r\n      the ancestors of his generation... all the people who cheered for\r\n      Germany in 1870.... All the materialists rampant, all the\r\n      idolizers of German science and efficiency. So he sat one day in\r\n      an English lecture and heard \xe2\x80\x9cLocksley Hall\xe2\x80\x9d quoted and fell into\r\n      a brown study with contempt for Tennyson and all he stood for\xe2\x80\x94for\r\n      he took him as a representative of the Victorians.\r\n\r\n  Victorians, Victorians, who never learned to weep Who sowed the\r\n  bitter harvest that your children go to reap\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      scribbled Amory in his note-book. The lecturer was saying\r\n      something about Tennyson\xe2\x80\x99s solidity and fifty heads were bent to\r\n      take notes. Amory turned over to a fresh page and began scrawling\r\n      again.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cThey shuddered when they found what Mr. Darwin was about, They\r\n shuddered when the waltz came in and Newman hurried out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      But the waltz came in much earlier; he crossed that out.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd entitled A Song in the Time of Order,\xe2\x80\x9d came the professor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      voice, droning far away. \xe2\x80\x9cTime of Order\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Good Lord! Everything\r\n      crammed in the box and the Victorians sitting on the lid smiling\r\n      serenely.... With Browning in his Italian villa crying bravely:\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x99s for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d Amory scribbled again.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou knelt up in the temple and he bent to hear you pray, You thanked\r\n him for your \xe2\x80\x98glorious gains\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94reproached him for \xe2\x80\x98Cathay.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Why could he never get more than a couplet at a time? Now he\r\n      needed something to rhyme with:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou would keep Him straight with science, tho He had gone wrong\r\n before...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Well, anyway....\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou met your children in your home\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve fixed it up!\xe2\x80\x99 you cried,\r\n Took your fifty years of Europe, and then virtuously\xe2\x80\x94died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat was to a great extent Tennyson\xe2\x80\x99s idea,\xe2\x80\x9d came the lecturer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      voice. \xe2\x80\x9cSwinburne\xe2\x80\x99s Song in the Time of Order might well have\r\n      been Tennyson\xe2\x80\x99s title. He idealized order against chaos, against\r\n      waste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      At last Amory had it. He turned over another page and scrawled\r\n      vigorously for the twenty minutes that was left of the hour. Then\r\n      he walked up to the desk and deposited a page torn out of his\r\n      note-book.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a poem to the Victorians, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said coldly.\r\n\r\n      The professor picked it up curiously while Amory backed rapidly\r\n      through the door.\r\n\r\n      Here is what he had written:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cSongs in the time of order You left for us to sing, Proofs with\r\n   excluded middles, Answers to life in rhyme, Keys of the prison\r\n   warder And ancient bells to ring, Time was the end of riddles, We\r\n   were the end of time...\r\n    Here were domestic oceans And a sky that we might reach, Guns and a\r\n    guarded border, Gantlets\xe2\x80\x94but not to fling, Thousands of old\r\n    emotions And a platitude for each, Songs in the time of order\xe2\x80\x94 And\r\n    tongues, that we might sing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE END OF MANY THINGS\r\n\r\n      Early April slipped by in a haze\xe2\x80\x94a haze of long evenings on the\r\n      club veranda with the graphophone playing \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Butterfly\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      inside... for \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Butterfly\xe2\x80\x9d had been the song of that last\r\n      year. The war seemed scarcely to touch them and it might have\r\n      been one of the senior springs of the past, except for the\r\n      drilling every other afternoon, yet Amory realized poignantly\r\n      that this was the last spring under the old regime.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the great protest against the superman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d Alec agreed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely irreconcilable with any Utopia. As long as he\r\n      occurs, there\xe2\x80\x99s trouble and all the latent evil that makes a\r\n      crowd list and sway when he talks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course all that he is is a gifted man without a moral\r\n      sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all. I think the worst thing to contemplate is this\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      all happened before, how soon will it happen again? Fifty years\r\n      after Waterloo Napoleon was as much a hero to English school\r\n      children as Wellington. How do we know our grandchildren won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      idolize Von Hindenburg the same way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat brings it about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTime, damn it, and the historian. If we could only learn to look\r\n      on evil as evil, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s clothed in filth or monotony or\r\n      magnificence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGod! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t we raked the universe over the coals for four\r\n      years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Then the night came that was to be the last. Tom and Amory, bound\r\n      in the morning for different training-camps, paced the shadowy\r\n      walks as usual and seemed still to see around them the faces of\r\n      the men they knew.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe grass is full of ghosts to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole campus is alive with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They paused by Little and watched the moon rise, to make silver\r\n      of the slate roof of Dodd and blue the rustling trees.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat we feel now is the sense of all\r\n      the gorgeous youth that has rioted through here in two hundred\r\n      years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      A last burst of singing flooded up from Blair Arch\xe2\x80\x94broken voices\r\n      for some long parting.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what we leave here is more than this class; it\xe2\x80\x99s the whole\r\n      heritage of youth. We\xe2\x80\x99re just one generation\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re breaking all\r\n      the links that seemed to bind us here to top-booted and\r\n      high-stocked generations. We\xe2\x80\x99ve walked arm and arm with Burr and\r\n      Light-Horse Harry Lee through half these deep-blue nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what they are,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom tangented off, \xe2\x80\x9cdeep blue\xe2\x80\x94a bit of\r\n      color would spoil them, make them exotic. Spires, against a sky\r\n      that\xe2\x80\x99s a promise of dawn, and blue light on the slate roofs\xe2\x80\x94it\r\n      hurts... rather\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Aaron Burr,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory called toward deserted Nassau Hall,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cyou and I knew strange corners of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      His voice echoed in the stillness.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe torches are out,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Messalina, the long\r\n      shadows are building minarets on the stadium\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      For an instant the voices of freshman year surged around them and\r\n      then they looked at each other with faint tears in their eyes.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The last light fades and drifts across the land\xe2\x80\x94the low, long\r\n      land, the sunny land of spires; the ghosts of evening tune again\r\n      their lyres and wander singing in a plaintive band down the long\r\n      corridors of trees; pale fires echo the night from tower top to\r\n      tower: Oh, sleep that dreams, and dream that never tires, press\r\n      from the petals of the lotus flower something of this to keep,\r\n      the essence of an hour.\r\n\r\n      No more to wait the twilight of the moon in this sequestered vale\r\n      of star and spire, for one eternal morning of desire passes to\r\n      time and earthy afternoon. Here, Heraclitus, did you find in fire\r\n      and shifting things the prophecy you hurled down the dead years;\r\n      this midnight my desire will see, shadowed among the embers,\r\n      furled in flame, the splendor and the sadness of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      INTERLUDE\r\n\r\n      May, 1917-February, 1919\r\n\r\n      A letter dated January, 1918, written by Monsignor Darcy to\r\n      Amory, who is a second lieutenant in the 171st Infantry, Port of\r\n      Embarkation, Camp Mills, Long Island.\r\n\r\n      MY DEAR BOY:\r\n\r\n      All you need tell me of yourself is that you still are; for the\r\n      rest I merely search back in a restive memory, a thermometer that\r\n      records only fevers, and match you with what I was at your age.\r\n      But men will chatter and you and I will still shout our\r\n      futilities to each other across the stage until the last silly\r\n      curtain falls _plump!_ upon our bobbing heads. But you are\r\n      starting the spluttering magic-lantern show of life with much the\r\n      same array of slides as I had, so I need to write you if only to\r\n      shriek the colossal stupidity of people....\r\n\r\n      This is the end of one thing: for better or worse you will never\r\n      again be quite the Amory Blaine that I knew, never again will we\r\n      meet as we have met, because your generation is growing hard,\r\n      much harder than mine ever grew, nourished as they were on the\r\n      stuff of the nineties.\r\n\r\n      Amory, lately I reread Aeschylus and there in the divine irony of\r\n      the \xe2\x80\x9cAgamemnon\xe2\x80\x9d I find the only answer to this bitter age\xe2\x80\x94all the\r\n      world tumbled about our ears, and the closest parallel ages back\r\n      in that hopeless resignation. There are times when I think of the\r\n      men out there as Roman legionaries, miles from their corrupt\r\n      city, stemming back the hordes... hordes a little more menacing,\r\n      after all, than the corrupt city... another blind blow at the\r\n      race, furies that we passed with ovations years ago, over whose\r\n      corpses we bleated triumphantly all through the Victorian era....\r\n\r\n      And afterward an out-and-out materialistic world\xe2\x80\x94and the Catholic\r\n      Church. I wonder where you\xe2\x80\x99ll fit in. Of one thing I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      sure\xe2\x80\x94Celtic you\xe2\x80\x99ll live and Celtic you\xe2\x80\x99ll die; so if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      use heaven as a continual referendum for your ideas you\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\n      earth a continual recall to your ambitions.\r\n\r\n      Amory, I\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered suddenly that I\xe2\x80\x99m an old man. Like all old\r\n      men, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had dreams sometimes and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you of them.\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed imagining that you were my son, that perhaps when I\r\n      was young I went into a state of coma and begat you, and when I\r\n      came to, had no recollection of it... it\xe2\x80\x99s the paternal instinct,\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x94celibacy goes deeper than the flesh....\r\n\r\n      Sometimes I think that the explanation of our deep resemblance is\r\n      some common ancestor, and I find that the only blood that the\r\n      Darcys and the O\xe2\x80\x99Haras have in common is that of the\r\n      O\xe2\x80\x99Donahues... Stephen was his name, I think....\r\n\r\n      When the lightning strikes one of us it strikes both: you had\r\n      hardly arrived at the port of embarkation when I got my papers to\r\n      start for Rome, and I am waiting every moment to be told where to\r\n      take ship. Even before you get this letter I shall be on the\r\n      ocean; then will come your turn. You went to war as a gentleman\r\n      should, just as you went to school and college, because it was\r\n      the thing to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to leave the blustering and\r\n      tremulo-heroism to the middle classes; they do it so much better.\r\n\r\n      Do you remember that week-end last March when you brought Burne\r\n      Holiday from Princeton to see me? What a magnificent boy he is!\r\n      It gave me a frightful shock afterward when you wrote that he\r\n      thought me splendid; how could he be so deceived? Splendid is the\r\n      one thing that neither you nor I are. We are many other\r\n      things\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re extraordinary, we\xe2\x80\x99re clever, we could be said, I\r\n      suppose, to be brilliant. We can attract people, we can make\r\n      atmosphere, we can almost lose our Celtic souls in Celtic\r\n      subtleties, we can almost always have our own way; but\r\n      splendid\xe2\x80\x94rather not!\r\n\r\n      I am going to Rome with a wonderful dossier and letters of\r\n      introduction that cover every capital in Europe, and there will\r\n      be \xe2\x80\x9cno small stir\xe2\x80\x9d when I get there. How I wish you were with me!\r\n      This sounds like a rather cynical paragraph, not at all the sort\r\n      of thing that a middle-aged clergyman should write to a youth\r\n      about to depart for the war; the only excuse is that the\r\n      middle-aged clergyman is talking to himself. There are deep\r\n      things in us and you know what they are as well as I do. We have\r\n      great faith, though yours at present is uncrystallized; we have a\r\n      terrible honesty that all our sophistry cannot destroy and, above\r\n      all, a childlike simplicity that keeps us from ever being really\r\n      malicious.\r\n\r\n      I have written a keen for you which follows. I am sorry your\r\n      cheeks are not up to the description I have written of them, but\r\n      you _will_ smoke and read all night\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      At any rate here it is:\r\n\r\n      A Lament for a Foster Son, and He going to the War Against the\r\n      King of Foreign.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cOchone He is gone from me the son of my mind And he in his golden\r\n youth like Angus Oge Angus of the bright birds And his mind strong and\r\n subtle like the mind of Cuchulin on Muirtheme.\r\n  Awirra sthrue His brow is as white as the milk of the cows of Maeve\r\n  And his cheeks like the cherries of the tree And it bending down to\r\n  Mary and she feeding the Son of God.\r\n  Aveelia Vrone His hair is like the golden collar of the Kings at Tara\r\n  And his eyes like the four gray seas of Erin. And they swept with the\r\n  mists of rain.\r\n  Mavrone go Gudyo He to be in the joyful and red battle Amongst the\r\n  chieftains and they doing great deeds of valor His life to go from\r\n  him It is the chords of my own soul would be loosed.\r\n  A Vich Deelish My heart is in the heart of my son And my life is in\r\n  his life surely A man can be twice young In the life of his sons\r\n  only.\r\n  Jia du Vaha Alanav May the Son of God be above him and beneath him,\r\n  before him and behind him May the King of the elements cast a mist\r\n  over the eyes of the King of Foreign, May the Queen of the Graces\r\n  lead him by the hand the way he can go through the midst of his\r\n  enemies and they not seeing him\r\n  May Patrick of the Gael and Collumb of the Churches and the five\r\n  thousand Saints of Erin be better than a shield to him And he got\r\n  into the fight. Och Ochone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x94Amory\xe2\x80\x94I feel, somehow, that this is all; one or both of us\r\n      is not going to last out this war.... I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to tell\r\n      you how much this reincarnation of myself in you has meant in the\r\n      last few years... curiously alike we are... curiously unlike.\r\n      Good-by, dear boy, and God be with you. THAYER DARCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n      EMBARKING AT NIGHT\r\n\r\n      Amory moved forward on the deck until he found a stool under an\r\n      electric light. He searched in his pocket for note-book and\r\n      pencil and then began to write, slowly, laboriously:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe leave to-night... Silent, we filled the still, deserted street, A\r\n column of dim gray, And ghosts rose startled at the muffled beat Along\r\n the moonless way; The shadowy shipyards echoed to the feet That turned\r\n from night and day.\r\n    And so we linger on the windless decks, See on the spectre shore\r\n    Shades of a thousand days, poor gray-ribbed wrecks... Oh, shall we\r\n    then deplore Those futile years! See how the sea is white! The\r\n    clouds have broken and the heavens burn To hollow highways, paved\r\n    with gravelled light The churning of the waves about the stern\r\n    Rises to one voluminous nocturne, ... We leave to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      A letter from Amory, headed \xe2\x80\x9cBrest, March 11th, 1919,\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\n      Lieutenant T. P. D\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers, Camp Gordon, Ga.\r\n\r\n      DEAR BAUDELAIRE:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      We meet in Manhattan on the 30th of this very mo.; we then\r\n      proceed to take a very sporty apartment, you and I and Alec, who\r\n      is at me elbow as I write. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do but\r\n      I have a vague dream of going into politics. Why is it that the\r\n      pick of the young Englishmen from Oxford and Cambridge go into\r\n      politics and in the U. S. A. we leave it to the muckers?\xe2\x80\x94raised\r\n      in the ward, educated in the assembly and sent to Congress,\r\n      fat-paunched bundles of corruption, devoid of \xe2\x80\x9cboth ideas and\r\n      ideals\xe2\x80\x9d as the debaters used to say. Even forty years ago we had\r\n      good men in politics, but we, we are brought up to pile up a\r\n      million and \xe2\x80\x9cshow what we are made of.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\n      an Englishman; American life is so damned dumb and stupid and\r\n      healthy.\r\n\r\n      Since poor Beatrice died I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have a little money, but\r\n      very darn little. I can forgive mother almost everything except\r\n      the fact that in a sudden burst of religiosity toward the end,\r\n      she left half of what remained to be spent in stained-glass\r\n      windows and seminary endowments. Mr. Barton, my lawyer, writes me\r\n      that my thousands are mostly in street railways and that the said\r\n      Street R.R. s are losing money because of the five-cent fares.\r\n      Imagine a salary list that gives $350 a month to a man that can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      read and write!\xe2\x80\x94yet I believe in it, even though I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what\r\n      was once a sizable fortune melt away between speculation,\r\n      extravagance, the democratic administration, and the income\r\n      tax\xe2\x80\x94modern, that\xe2\x80\x99s me all over, Mabel.\r\n\r\n      At any rate we\xe2\x80\x99ll have really knock-out rooms\xe2\x80\x94you can get a job\r\n      on some fashion magazine, and Alec can go into the Zinc Company\r\n      or whatever it is that his people own\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s looking over my\r\n      shoulder and he says it\xe2\x80\x99s a brass company, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\r\n      matters much, do you? There\xe2\x80\x99s probably as much corruption in\r\n      zinc-made money as brass-made money. As for the well-known Amory,\r\n      he would write immortal literature if he were sure enough about\r\n      anything to risk telling any one else about it. There is no more\r\n      dangerous gift to posterity than a few cleverly turned\r\n      platitudes.\r\n\r\n      Tom, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you become a Catholic? Of course to be a good one\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x99d have to give up those violent intrigues you used to tell me\r\n      about, but you\xe2\x80\x99d write better poetry if you were linked up to\r\n      tall golden candlesticks and long, even chants, and even if the\r\n      American priests are rather burgeois, as Beatrice used to say,\r\n      still you need only go to the sporty churches, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce\r\n      you to Monsignor Darcy who really is a wonder.\r\n\r\n      Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s death was a blow, so was Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s to a certain extent. And\r\n      I have a great curiosity to know what queer corner of the world\r\n      has swallowed Burne. Do you suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s in prison under some\r\n      false name? I confess that the war instead of making me orthodox,\r\n      which is the correct reaction, has made me a passionate agnostic.\r\n      The Catholic Church has had its wings clipped so often lately\r\n      that its part was timidly negligible, and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t any good\r\n      writers any more. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of Chesterton.\r\n\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ve only discovered one soldier who passed through the\r\n      much-advertised spiritual crisis, like this fellow, Donald\r\n      Hankey, and the one I knew was already studying for the ministry,\r\n      so he was ripe for it. I honestly think that\xe2\x80\x99s all pretty much\r\n      rot, though it seemed to give sentimental comfort to those at\r\n      home; and may make fathers and mothers appreciate their children.\r\n      This crisis-inspired religion is rather valueless and fleeting at\r\n      best. I think four men have discovered Paris to one that\r\n      discovered God.\r\n\r\n      But us\xe2\x80\x94you and me and Alec\xe2\x80\x94oh, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a Jap butler and dress\r\n      for dinner and have wine on the table and lead a contemplative,\r\n      emotionless life until we decide to use machine-guns with the\r\n      property owners\xe2\x80\x94or throw bombs with the Bolshevik God! Tom, I\r\n      hope something happens. I\xe2\x80\x99m restless as the devil and have a\r\n      horror of getting fat or falling in love and growing domestic.\r\n\r\n      The place at Lake Geneva is now for rent but when I land I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      going West to see Mr. Barton and get some details. Write me care\r\n      of the Blackstone, Chicago.\r\n\r\n              S\xe2\x80\x99ever, dear Boswell,\r\n                                  SAMUEL JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK TWO\xe2\x80\x94The Education of a Personage\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER 1. The Debutante\r\n\r\n\r\n      The time is February. The place is a large, dainty bedroom in the\r\n      Connage house on Sixty-eighth Street, New York. A girl\xe2\x80\x99s room:\r\n      pink walls and curtains and a pink bedspread on a cream-colored\r\n      bed. Pink and cream are the motifs of the room, but the only\r\n      article of furniture in full view is a luxurious dressing-table\r\n      with a glass top and a three-sided mirror. On the walls there is\r\n      an expensive print of \xe2\x80\x9cCherry Ripe,\xe2\x80\x9d a few polite dogs by\r\n      Landseer, and the \xe2\x80\x9cKing of the Black Isles,\xe2\x80\x9d by Maxfield Parrish.\r\n\r\n      Great disorder consisting of the following items: (1) seven or\r\n      eight empty cardboard boxes, with tissue-paper tongues hanging\r\n      panting from their mouths; (2) an assortment of street dresses\r\n      mingled with their sisters of the evening, all upon the table,\r\n      all evidently new; (3) a roll of tulle, which has lost its\r\n      dignity and wound itself tortuously around everything in sight,\r\n      and (4) upon the two small chairs, a collection of lingerie that\r\n      beggars description. One would enjoy seeing the bill called forth\r\n      by the finery displayed and one is possessed by a desire to see\r\n      the princess for whose benefit\xe2\x80\x94Look! There\xe2\x80\x99s some one!\r\n      Disappointment! This is only a maid hunting for something\xe2\x80\x94she\r\n      lifts a heap from a chair\xe2\x80\x94Not there; another heap, the\r\n      dressing-table, the chiffonier drawers. She brings to light\r\n      several beautiful chemises and an amazing pajama but this does\r\n      not satisfy her\xe2\x80\x94she goes out.\r\n\r\n      An indistinguishable mumble from the next room.\r\n\r\n      Now, we are getting warm. This is Alec\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Mrs. Connage,\r\n      ample, dignified, rouged to the dowager point and quite worn out.\r\n      Her lips move significantly as she looks for IT. Her search is\r\n      less thorough than the maid\xe2\x80\x99s but there is a touch of fury in it,\r\n      that quite makes up for its sketchiness. She stumbles on the\r\n      tulle and her \xe2\x80\x9cdamn\xe2\x80\x9d is quite audible. She retires, empty-handed.\r\n\r\n      More chatter outside and a girl\xe2\x80\x99s voice, a very spoiled voice,\r\n      says: \xe2\x80\x9cOf all the stupid people\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      After a pause a third seeker enters, not she of the spoiled\r\n      voice, but a younger edition. This is Cecelia Connage, sixteen,\r\n      pretty, shrewd, and constitutionally good-humored. She is dressed\r\n      for the evening in a gown the obvious simplicity of which\r\n      probably bores her. She goes to the nearest pile, selects a small\r\n      pink garment and holds it up appraisingly.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Pink?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Outside) Yes!\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: _Very_ snappy?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Yes!\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it!\r\n\r\n      (She sees herself in the mirror of the dressing-table and\r\n      commences to shimmy enthusiastically.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Outside) What are you doing\xe2\x80\x94trying it on?\r\n\r\n      (CECELIA ceases and goes out carrying the garment at the right\r\n      shoulder.\r\n\r\n      From the other door, enters ALEC CONNAGE. He looks around quickly\r\n      and in a huge voice shouts: Mama! There is a chorus of protest\r\n      from next door and encouraged he starts toward it, but is\r\n      repelled by another chorus.)\r\n\r\n      ALEC: So _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ where you all are! Amory Blaine is here.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: (Quickly) Take him down-stairs.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Oh, he _is_ down-stairs.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Well, you can show him where his room is. Tell him\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that I can\xe2\x80\x99t meet him now.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: He\xe2\x80\x99s heard a lot about you all. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d hurry.\r\n      Father\xe2\x80\x99s telling him all about the war and he\xe2\x80\x99s restless. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      sort of temperamental.\r\n\r\n      (This last suffices to draw CECELIA into the room.)\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: (Seating herself high upon lingerie) How do you\r\n      mean\xe2\x80\x94temperamental? You used to say that about him in letters.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Oh, he writes stuff.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Does he play the piano?\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: (Speculatively) Drink?\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Yes\xe2\x80\x94nothing queer about him.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Money?\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Good Lord\xe2\x80\x94ask him, he used to have a lot, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got some\r\n      income now.\r\n\r\n      (MRS. CONNAGE appears.)\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Alec, of course we\xe2\x80\x99re glad to have any friend of\r\n      yours\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      ALEC: You certainly ought to meet Amory.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Of course, I want to. But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s so childish\r\n      of you to leave a perfectly good home to go and live with two\r\n      other boys in some impossible apartment. I hope it isn\xe2\x80\x99t in order\r\n      that you can all drink as much as you want. (She pauses.) He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n      be a little neglected to-night. This is Rosalind\xe2\x80\x99s week, you see.\r\n      When a girl comes out, she needs _all_ the attention.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Outside) Well, then, prove it by coming here and\r\n      hooking me.\r\n\r\n      (MRS. CONNAGE goes.)\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Rosalind hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed a bit.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: (In a lower tone) She\xe2\x80\x99s awfully spoiled.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: She\xe2\x80\x99ll meet her match to-night.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Who\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Amory Blaine?\r\n\r\n      (ALEC nods.)\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Well, Rosalind has still to meet the man she can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      outdistance. Honestly, Alec, she treats men terribly. She abuses\r\n      them and cuts them and breaks dates with them and yawns in their\r\n      faces\xe2\x80\x94and they come back for more.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: They love it.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: They hate it. She\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of vampire, I\r\n      think\xe2\x80\x94and she can make girls do what she wants usually\xe2\x80\x94only she\r\n      hates girls.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Personality runs in our family.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: (Resignedly) I guess it ran out before it got to me.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Does Rosalind behave herself?\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Not particularly well. Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s average\xe2\x80\x94smokes\r\n      sometimes, drinks punch, frequently kissed\xe2\x80\x94Oh, yes\xe2\x80\x94common\r\n      knowledge\xe2\x80\x94one of the effects of the war, you know.\r\n\r\n      (Emerges MRS. CONNAGE.)\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Rosalind\xe2\x80\x99s almost finished so I can go down and\r\n      meet your friend.\r\n\r\n      (ALEC and his mother go out.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Outside) Oh, mother\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Mother\xe2\x80\x99s gone down.\r\n\r\n      (And now ROSALIND enters. ROSALIND is\xe2\x80\x94utterly ROSALIND. She is\r\n      one of those girls who need never make the slightest effort to\r\n      have men fall in love with them. Two types of men seldom do: dull\r\n      men are usually afraid of her cleverness and intellectual men are\r\n      usually afraid of her beauty. All others are hers by natural\r\n      prerogative.\r\n\r\n      If ROSALIND could be spoiled the process would have been complete\r\n      by this time, and as a matter of fact, her disposition is not all\r\n      it should be; she wants what she wants when she wants it and she\r\n      is prone to make every one around her pretty miserable when she\r\n      doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get it\xe2\x80\x94but in the true sense she is not spoiled. Her\r\n      fresh enthusiasm, her will to grow and learn, her endless faith\r\n      in the inexhaustibility of romance, her courage and fundamental\r\n      honesty\xe2\x80\x94these things are not spoiled.\r\n\r\n      There are long periods when she cordially loathes her whole\r\n      family. She is quite unprincipled; her philosophy is carpe diem\r\n      for herself and laissez faire for others. She loves shocking\r\n      stories: she has that coarse streak that usually goes with\r\n      natures that are both fine and big. She wants people to like her,\r\n      but if they do not it never worries her or changes her. She is by\r\n      no means a model character.\r\n\r\n      The education of all beautiful women is the knowledge of men.\r\n      ROSALIND had been disappointed in man after man as individuals,\r\n      but she had great faith in man as a sex. Women she detested. They\r\n      represented qualities that she felt and despised in\r\n      herself\xe2\x80\x94incipient meanness, conceit, cowardice, and petty\r\n      dishonesty. She once told a roomful of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s friends that\r\n      the only excuse for women was the necessity for a disturbing\r\n      element among men. She danced exceptionally well, drew cleverly\r\n      but hastily, and had a startling facility with words, which she\r\n      used only in love-letters.\r\n\r\n      But all criticism of ROSALIND ends in her beauty. There was that\r\n      shade of glorious yellow hair, the desire to imitate which\r\n      supports the dye industry. There was the eternal kissable mouth,\r\n      small, slightly sensual, and utterly disturbing. There were gray\r\n      eyes and an unimpeachable skin with two spots of vanishing color.\r\n      She was slender and athletic, without underdevelopment, and it\r\n      was a delight to watch her move about a room, walk along a\r\n      street, swing a golf club, or turn a \xe2\x80\x9ccartwheel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      A last qualification\xe2\x80\x94her vivid, instant personality escaped that\r\n      conscious, theatrical quality that AMORY had found in ISABELLE.\r\n      MONSIGNOR DARCY would have been quite up a tree whether to call\r\n      her a personality or a personage. She was perhaps the delicious,\r\n      inexpressible, once-in-a-century blend.\r\n\r\n      On the night of her debut she is, for all her strange, stray\r\n      wisdom, quite like a happy little girl. Her mother\xe2\x80\x99s maid has\r\n      just done her hair, but she has decided impatiently that she can\r\n      do a better job herself. She is too nervous just now to stay in\r\n      one place. To that we owe her presence in this littered room. She\r\n      is going to speak. ISABELLE\xe2\x80\x99S alto tones had been like a violin,\r\n      but if you could hear ROSALIND, you would say her voice was\r\n      musical as a waterfall.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Honestly, there are only two costumes in the world that\r\n      I really enjoy being in\xe2\x80\x94(Combing her hair at the dressing-table.)\r\n      One\xe2\x80\x99s a hoop skirt with pantaloons; the other\xe2\x80\x99s a one-piece\r\n      bathing-suit. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite charming in both of them.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Glad you\xe2\x80\x99re coming out?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Yes; aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: (Cynically) You\xe2\x80\x99re glad so you can get married and live\r\n      on Long Island with the _fast younger married set_. You want life\r\n      to be a chain of flirtation with a man for every link.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: _Want_ it to be one! You mean I\xe2\x80\x99ve _found_ it one.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Ha!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Cecelia, darling, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a trial it is to\r\n      be\xe2\x80\x94like me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep my face like steel in the street to\r\n      keep men from winking at me. If I laugh hard from a front row in\r\n      the theatre, the comedian plays to me for the rest of the\r\n      evening. If I drop my voice, my eyes, my handkerchief at a dance,\r\n      my partner calls me up on the \xe2\x80\x99phone every day for a week.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: It must be an awful strain.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: The unfortunate part is that the only men who interest\r\n      me at all are the totally ineligible ones. Now\xe2\x80\x94if I were poor I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n      go on the stage.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Yes, you might as well get paid for the amount of acting\r\n      you do.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Sometimes when I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt particularly radiant I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\n      thought, why should this be wasted on one man?\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Often when you\xe2\x80\x99re particularly sulky, I\xe2\x80\x99ve wondered why\r\n      it should all be wasted on just one family. (Getting up.) I think\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down and meet Mr. Amory Blaine. I like temperamental men.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: There aren\xe2\x80\x99t any. Men don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to be really angry\r\n      or really happy\xe2\x80\x94and the ones that do, go to pieces.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I don\xe2\x80\x99t have all your worries. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      engaged.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (With a scornful smile) Engaged? Why, you little\r\n      lunatic! If mother heard you talking like that she\xe2\x80\x99d send you off\r\n      to boarding-school, where you belong.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: You won\xe2\x80\x99t tell her, though, because I know things I\r\n      could tell\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99re too selfish!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (A little annoyed) Run along, little girl! Who are you\r\n      engaged to, the iceman? the man that keeps the candy-store?\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Cheap wit\xe2\x80\x94good-by, darling, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, be _sure_ and do that\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re such a help.\r\n\r\n      (Exit CECELIA. ROSALIND finished her hair and rises, humming. She\r\n      goes up to the mirror and starts to dance in front of it on the\r\n      soft carpet. She watches not her feet, but her eyes\xe2\x80\x94never\r\n      casually but always intently, even when she smiles. The door\r\n      suddenly opens and then slams behind AMORY, very cool and\r\n      handsome as usual. He melts into instant confusion.)\r\n\r\n      HE: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I thought\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Smiling radiantly) Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re Amory Blaine, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n      HE: (Regarding her closely) And you\xe2\x80\x99re Rosalind?\r\n\r\n      SHE: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call you Amory\xe2\x80\x94oh, come in\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\n      right\xe2\x80\x94mother\xe2\x80\x99ll be right in\xe2\x80\x94(under her breath) unfortunately.\r\n\r\n      HE: (Gazing around) This is sort of a new wrinkle for me.\r\n\r\n      SHE: This is No Man\xe2\x80\x99s Land.\r\n\r\n      HE: This is where you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94(pause)\r\n\r\n      SHE: Yes\xe2\x80\x94all those things. (She crosses to the bureau.) See,\r\n      here\xe2\x80\x99s my rouge\xe2\x80\x94eye pencils.\r\n\r\n      HE: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were that way.\r\n\r\n      SHE: What did you expect?\r\n\r\n      HE: I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be sort of\xe2\x80\x94sort of\xe2\x80\x94sexless, you know, swim\r\n      and play golf.\r\n\r\n      SHE: Oh, I do\xe2\x80\x94but not in business hours.\r\n\r\n      HE: Business?\r\n\r\n      SHE: Six to two\xe2\x80\x94strictly.\r\n\r\n      HE: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have some stock in the corporation.\r\n\r\n      SHE: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a corporation\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s just \xe2\x80\x9cRosalind, Unlimited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      Fifty-one shares, name, good-will, and everything goes at $25,000\r\n      a year.\r\n\r\n      HE: (Disapprovingly) Sort of a chilly proposition.\r\n\r\n      SHE: Well, Amory, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x94do you? When I meet a man that\r\n      doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bore me to death after two weeks, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\n      different.\r\n\r\n      HE: Odd, you have the same point of view on men that I have on\r\n      women.\r\n\r\n      SHE: I\xe2\x80\x99m not really feminine, you know\xe2\x80\x94in my mind.\r\n\r\n      HE: (Interested) Go on.\r\n\r\n      SHE: No, you\xe2\x80\x94you go on\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve made me talk about myself. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      against the rules.\r\n\r\n      HE: Rules?\r\n\r\n      SHE: My own rules\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x94Oh, Amory, I hear you\xe2\x80\x99re brilliant. The\r\n      family expects _so_ much of you.\r\n\r\n      HE: How encouraging!\r\n\r\n      SHE: Alec said you\xe2\x80\x99d taught him to think. Did you? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      believe any one could.\r\n\r\n      HE: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m really quite dull.\r\n\r\n      (He evidently doesn\xe2\x80\x99t intend this to be taken seriously.)\r\n\r\n      SHE: Liar.\r\n\r\n      HE: I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m religious\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m literary. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve even written poems.\r\n\r\n      SHE: Vers libre\xe2\x80\x94splendid! (She declaims.)\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cThe trees are green, The birds are singing in the trees, The girl\r\n   sips her poison The bird flies away the girl dies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      HE: (Laughing) No, not that kind.\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Suddenly) I like you.\r\n\r\n      HE: Don\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n      SHE: Modest too\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      HE: I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of you. I\xe2\x80\x99m always afraid of a girl\xe2\x80\x94until I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\n      kissed her.\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Emphatically) My dear boy, the war is over.\r\n\r\n      HE: So I\xe2\x80\x99ll always be afraid of you.\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Rather sadly) I suppose you will.\r\n\r\n      (A slight hesitation on both their parts.)\r\n\r\n      HE: (After due consideration) Listen. This is a frightful thing\r\n      to ask.\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Knowing what\xe2\x80\x99s coming) After five minutes.\r\n\r\n      HE: But will you\xe2\x80\x94kiss me? Or are you afraid?\r\n\r\n      SHE: I\xe2\x80\x99m never afraid\xe2\x80\x94but your reasons are so poor.\r\n\r\n      HE: Rosalind, I really _want_ to kiss you.\r\n\r\n      SHE: So do I.\r\n\r\n      (They kiss\xe2\x80\x94definitely and thoroughly.)\r\n\r\n      HE: (After a breathless second) Well, is your curiosity\r\n      satisfied?\r\n\r\n      SHE: Is yours?\r\n\r\n      HE: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s only aroused.\r\n\r\n      (He looks it.)\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Dreamily) I\xe2\x80\x99ve kissed dozens of men. I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss\r\n      dozens more.\r\n\r\n      HE: (Abstractedly) Yes, I suppose you could\xe2\x80\x94like that.\r\n\r\n      SHE: Most people like the way I kiss.\r\n\r\n      HE: (Remembering himself) Good Lord, yes. Kiss me once more,\r\n      Rosalind.\r\n\r\n      SHE: No\xe2\x80\x94my curiosity is generally satisfied at one.\r\n\r\n      HE: (Discouraged) Is that a rule?\r\n\r\n      SHE: I make rules to fit the cases.\r\n\r\n      HE: You and I are somewhat alike\xe2\x80\x94except that I\xe2\x80\x99m years older in\r\n      experience.\r\n\r\n      SHE: How old are you?\r\n\r\n      HE: Almost twenty-three. You?\r\n\r\n      SHE: Nineteen\xe2\x80\x94just.\r\n\r\n      HE: I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re the product of a fashionable school.\r\n\r\n      SHE: No\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m fairly raw material. I was expelled from Spence\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\n      forgotten why.\r\n\r\n      HE: What\xe2\x80\x99s your general trend?\r\n\r\n      SHE: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m bright, quite selfish, emotional when aroused, fond\r\n      of admiration\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      HE: (Suddenly) I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fall in love with you\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Raising her eyebrows) Nobody asked you to.\r\n\r\n      HE: (Continuing coldly) But I probably will. I love your mouth.\r\n\r\n      SHE: Hush! Please don\xe2\x80\x99t fall in love with my mouth\xe2\x80\x94hair, eyes,\r\n      shoulders, slippers\xe2\x80\x94but _not_ my mouth. Everybody falls in love\r\n      with my mouth.\r\n\r\n      HE: It\xe2\x80\x99s quite beautiful.\r\n\r\n      SHE: It\xe2\x80\x99s too small.\r\n\r\n      HE: No it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s see.\r\n\r\n      (He kisses her again with the same thoroughness.)\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Rather moved) Say something sweet.\r\n\r\n      HE: (Frightened) Lord help me.\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Drawing away) Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94if it\xe2\x80\x99s so hard.\r\n\r\n      HE: Shall we pretend? So soon?\r\n\r\n      SHE: We haven\xe2\x80\x99t the same standards of time as other people.\r\n\r\n      HE: Already it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94other people.\r\n\r\n      SHE: Let\xe2\x80\x99s pretend.\r\n\r\n      HE: No\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s sentiment.\r\n\r\n      SHE: You\xe2\x80\x99re not sentimental?\r\n\r\n      HE: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m romantic\xe2\x80\x94a sentimental person thinks things will\r\n      last\xe2\x80\x94a romantic person hopes against hope that they won\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n      Sentiment is emotional.\r\n\r\n      SHE: And you\xe2\x80\x99re not? (With her eyes half-closed.) You probably\r\n      flatter yourself that that\xe2\x80\x99s a superior attitude.\r\n\r\n      HE: Well\xe2\x80\x94Rosalind, Rosalind, don\xe2\x80\x99t argue\xe2\x80\x94kiss me again.\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Quite chilly now) No\xe2\x80\x94I have no desire to kiss you.\r\n\r\n      HE: (Openly taken aback) You wanted to kiss me a minute ago.\r\n\r\n      SHE: This is now.\r\n\r\n      HE: I\xe2\x80\x99d better go.\r\n\r\n      SHE: I suppose so.\r\n\r\n      (He goes toward the door.)\r\n\r\n      SHE: Oh!\r\n\r\n      (He turns.)\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Laughing) Score\xe2\x80\x94Home Team: One hundred\xe2\x80\x94Opponents: Zero.\r\n\r\n      (He starts back.)\r\n\r\n      SHE: (Quickly) Rain\xe2\x80\x94no game.\r\n\r\n      (He goes out.)\r\n\r\n      (She goes quietly to the chiffonier, takes out a cigarette-case\r\n      and hides it in the side drawer of a desk. Her mother enters,\r\n      note-book in hand.)\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Good\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to speak to you alone before\r\n      we go down-stairs.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Heavens! you frighten me!\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Rosalind, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a very expensive proposition.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Resignedly) Yes.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: And you know your father hasn\xe2\x80\x99t what he once had.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Making a wry face) Oh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about money.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: You can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything without it. This is our last\r\n      year in this house\xe2\x80\x94and unless things change Cecelia won\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\n      the advantages you\xe2\x80\x99ve had.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Impatiently) Well\xe2\x80\x94what is it?\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: So I ask you to please mind me in several things\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ve put down in my note-book. The first one is: don\xe2\x80\x99t disappear\r\n      with young men. There may be a time when it\xe2\x80\x99s valuable, but at\r\n      present I want you on the dance-floor where I can find you. There\r\n      are certain men I want to have you meet and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like finding\r\n      you in some corner of the conservatory exchanging silliness with\r\n      any one\xe2\x80\x94or listening to it.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Sarcastically) Yes, listening to it _is_ better.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: And don\xe2\x80\x99t waste a lot of time with the college\r\n      set\xe2\x80\x94little boys nineteen and twenty years old. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a\r\n      prom or a football game, but staying away from advantageous\r\n      parties to eat in little cafes down-town with Tom, Dick, and\r\n      Harry\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Offering her code, which is, in its way, quite as high\r\n      as her mother\xe2\x80\x99s) Mother, it\xe2\x80\x99s done\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t run everything now\r\n      the way you did in the early nineties.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: (Paying no attention) There are several bachelor\r\n      friends of your father\xe2\x80\x99s that I want you to meet\r\n      to-night\xe2\x80\x94youngish men.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Nodding wisely) About forty-five?\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: (Sharply) Why not?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, _quite_ all right\xe2\x80\x94they know life and are so\r\n      adorably tired looking (shakes her head)\xe2\x80\x94but they _will_ dance.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t met Mr. Blaine\xe2\x80\x94but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n      care for him. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like a money-maker.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Mother, I never _think_ about money.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: You never keep it long enough to think about it.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Sighs) Yes, I suppose some day I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry a ton of\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x94out of sheer boredom.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: (Referring to note-book) I had a wire from\r\n      Hartford. Dawson Ryder is coming up. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s a young man I\r\n      like, and he\xe2\x80\x99s floating in money. It seems to me that since you\r\n      seem tired of Howard Gillespie you might give Mr. Ryder some\r\n      encouragement. This is the third time he\xe2\x80\x99s been up in a month.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: How did you know I was tired of Howard Gillespie?\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: The poor boy looks so miserable every time he\r\n      comes.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: That was one of those romantic, pre-battle affairs.\r\n      They\xe2\x80\x99re all wrong.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: (Her say said) At any rate, make us proud of you\r\n      to-night.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I\xe2\x80\x99m beautiful?\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: You know you are.\r\n\r\n      (From down-stairs is heard the moan of a violin being tuned, the\r\n      roll of a drum. MRS. CONNAGE turns quickly to her daughter.)\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Come!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: One minute!\r\n\r\n      (Her mother leaves. ROSALIND goes to the glass where she gazes at\r\n      herself with great satisfaction. She kisses her hand and touches\r\n      her mirrored mouth with it. Then she turns out the lights and\r\n      leaves the room. Silence for a moment. A few chords from the\r\n      piano, the discreet patter of faint drums, the rustle of new\r\n      silk, all blend on the staircase outside and drift in through the\r\n      partly opened door. Bundled figures pass in the lighted hall. The\r\n      laughter heard below becomes doubled and multiplied. Then some\r\n      one comes in, closes the door, and switches on the lights. It is\r\n      CECELIA. She goes to the chiffonier, looks in the drawers,\r\n      hesitates\xe2\x80\x94then to the desk whence she takes the cigarette-case\r\n      and extracts one. She lights it and then, puffing and blowing,\r\n      walks toward the mirror.)\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: (In tremendously sophisticated accents) Oh, yes, coming\r\n      out is _such_ a farce nowadays, you know. One really plays around\r\n      so much before one is seventeen, that it\xe2\x80\x99s positively anticlimax.\r\n      (Shaking hands with a visionary middle-aged nobleman.) Yes, your\r\n      grace\xe2\x80\x94I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard my sister speak of you. Have a\r\n      puff\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re very good. They\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re Coronas. You don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke?\r\n      What a pity! The king doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it, I suppose. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n      dance.\r\n\r\n      (So she dances around the room to a tune from down-stairs, her\r\n      arms outstretched to an imaginary partner, the cigarette waving\r\n      in her hand.)\r\n\r\n\r\n      SEVERAL HOURS LATER\r\n\r\n      The corner of a den down-stairs, filled by a very comfortable\r\n      leather lounge. A small light is on each side above, and in the\r\n      middle, over the couch hangs a painting of a very old, very\r\n      dignified gentleman, period 1860. Outside the music is heard in a\r\n      fox-trot.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND is seated on the lounge and on her left is HOWARD\r\n      GILLESPIE, a vapid youth of about twenty-four. He is obviously\r\n      very unhappy, and she is quite bored.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: (Feebly) What do you mean I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed. I feel the\r\n      same toward you.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: But you don\xe2\x80\x99t look the same to me.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: Three weeks ago you used to say that you liked me\r\n      because I was so blas\xc3\xa9, so indifferent\xe2\x80\x94I still am.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: But not about me. I used to like you because you had\r\n      brown eyes and thin legs.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: (Helplessly) They\xe2\x80\x99re still thin and brown. You\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\n      vampire, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: The only thing I know about vamping is what\xe2\x80\x99s on the\r\n      piano score. What confuses men is that I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly natural. I\r\n      used to think you were never jealous. Now you follow me with your\r\n      eyes wherever I go.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: I love you.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Coldly) I know it.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: And you haven\xe2\x80\x99t kissed me for two weeks. I had an idea\r\n      that after a girl was kissed she was\xe2\x80\x94was\xe2\x80\x94won.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Those days are over. I have to be won all over again\r\n      every time you see me.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: Are you serious?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: About as usual. There used to be two kinds of kisses:\r\n      First when girls were kissed and deserted; second, when they were\r\n      engaged. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s a third kind, where the man is kissed and\r\n      deserted. If Mr. Jones of the nineties bragged he\xe2\x80\x99d kissed a\r\n      girl, every one knew he was through with her. If Mr. Jones of\r\n      1919 brags the same every one knows it\xe2\x80\x99s because he can\xe2\x80\x99t kiss\r\n      her any more. Given a decent start any girl can beat a man\r\n      nowadays.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: Then why do you play with men?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Leaning forward confidentially) For that first moment,\r\n      when he\xe2\x80\x99s interested. There is a moment\xe2\x80\x94Oh, just before the first\r\n      kiss, a whispered word\xe2\x80\x94something that makes it worth while.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: And then?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Then after that you make him talk about himself. Pretty\r\n      soon he thinks of nothing but being alone with you\xe2\x80\x94he sulks, he\r\n      won\xe2\x80\x99t fight, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to play\xe2\x80\x94Victory!\r\n\r\n      (Enter DAWSON RYDER, twenty-six, handsome, wealthy, faithful to\r\n      his own, a bore perhaps, but steady and sure of success.)\r\n\r\n      RYDER: I believe this is my dance, Rosalind.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Well, Dawson, so you recognize me. Now I know I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      got too much paint on. Mr. Ryder, this is Mr. Gillespie.\r\n\r\n      (They shake hands and GILLESPIE leaves, tremendously downcast.)\r\n\r\n      RYDER: Your party is certainly a success.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Is it\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it lately. I\xe2\x80\x99m weary\xe2\x80\x94Do you mind\r\n      sitting out a minute?\r\n\r\n      RYDER: Mind\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted. You know I loathe this \xe2\x80\x9crushing" idea.\r\n      See a girl yesterday, to-day, to-morrow.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Dawson!\r\n\r\n      RYDER: What?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I wonder if you know you love me.\r\n\r\n      RYDER: (Startled) What\xe2\x80\x94Oh\xe2\x80\x94you know you\xe2\x80\x99re remarkable!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Because you know I\xe2\x80\x99m an awful proposition. Any one who\r\n      marries me will have his hands full. I\xe2\x80\x99m mean\xe2\x80\x94mighty mean.\r\n\r\n      RYDER: Oh, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, yes, I am\xe2\x80\x94especially to the people nearest to me.\r\n      (She rises.) Come, let\xe2\x80\x99s go. I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my mind and I want to\r\n      dance. Mother is probably having a fit.\r\n\r\n      (Exeunt. Enter ALEC and CECELIA.)\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Just my luck to get my own brother for an intermission.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: (Gloomily) I\xe2\x80\x99ll go if you want me to.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Good heavens, no\xe2\x80\x94with whom would I begin the next dance?\r\n      (Sighs.) There\xe2\x80\x99s no color in a dance since the French officers\r\n      went back.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: (Thoughtfully) I don\xe2\x80\x99t want Amory to fall in love with\r\n      Rosalind.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: Why, I had an idea that that was just what you did want.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: I did, but since seeing these girls\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      awfully attached to Amory. He\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to\r\n      break his heart over somebody who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about him.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: He\xe2\x80\x99s very good looking.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: (Still thoughtfully) She won\xe2\x80\x99t marry him, but a girl\r\n      doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to marry a man to break his heart.\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: What does it? I wish I knew the secret.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Why, you cold-blooded little kitty. It\xe2\x80\x99s lucky for some\r\n      that the Lord gave you a pug nose.\r\n\r\n      (Enter MRS. CONNAGE.)\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Where on earth is Rosalind?\r\n\r\n      ALEC: (Brilliantly) Of course you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the best people to\r\n      find out. She\xe2\x80\x99d naturally be with us.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Her father has marshalled eight bachelor\r\n      millionaires to meet her.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: You might form a squad and march through the halls.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly serious\xe2\x80\x94for all I know she may be at\r\n      the Cocoanut Grove with some football player on the night of her\r\n      debut. You look left and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      ALEC: (Flippantly) Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better send the butler through the\r\n      cellar?\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: (Perfectly serious) Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\n      there?\r\n\r\n      CECELIA: He\xe2\x80\x99s only joking, mother.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Mother had a picture of her tapping a keg of beer with some\r\n      high hurdler.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Let\xe2\x80\x99s look right away.\r\n\r\n      (They go out. ROSALIND comes in with GILLESPIE.)\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: Rosalind\xe2\x80\x94Once more I ask you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you care a blessed\r\n      thing about me?\r\n\r\n      (AMORY walks in briskly.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: My dance.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Mr. Gillespie, this is Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: I\xe2\x80\x99ve met Mr. Blaine. From Lake Geneva, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Yes.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: (Desperately) I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the\xe2\x80\x94the Middle\r\n      West, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (Spicily) Approximately. But I always felt that I\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\n      be provincial hot-tamale than soup without seasoning.\r\n\r\n      GILLESPIE: What!\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Oh, no offense.\r\n\r\n      (GILLESPIE bows and leaves.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: He\xe2\x80\x99s too much _people_.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: I was in love with a _people_ once.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: So?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Oh, yes\xe2\x80\x94her name was Isabelle\xe2\x80\x94nothing at all to her except\r\n      what I read into her.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: What happened?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Finally I convinced her that she was smarter than I\r\n      was\xe2\x80\x94then she threw me over. Said I was critical and impractical,\r\n      you know.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: What do you mean impractical?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Oh\xe2\x80\x94drive a car, but can\xe2\x80\x99t change a tire.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: What are you going to do?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Can\xe2\x80\x99t say\xe2\x80\x94run for President, write\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Greenwich Village?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Good heavens, no\xe2\x80\x94I said write\xe2\x80\x94not drink.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I like business men. Clever men are usually so homely.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: I feel as if I\xe2\x80\x99d known you for ages.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, are you going to commence the \xe2\x80\x9cpyramid\xe2\x80\x9d story?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: No\xe2\x80\x94I was going to make it French. I was Louis XIV and you\r\n      were one of my\xe2\x80\x94my\xe2\x80\x94(Changing his tone.) Suppose\xe2\x80\x94we fell in love.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested pretending.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: If we did it would be very big.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Why?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Because selfish people are in a way terribly capable of\r\n      great loves.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Turning her lips up) Pretend.\r\n\r\n      (Very deliberately they kiss.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: I can\xe2\x80\x99t say sweet things. But you _are_ beautiful.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Not that.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: What then?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Sadly) Oh, nothing\xe2\x80\x94only I want sentiment, real\r\n      sentiment\xe2\x80\x94and I never find it.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: I never find anything else in the world\xe2\x80\x94and I loathe it.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: It\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to find a male to gratify one\xe2\x80\x99s artistic\r\n      taste.\r\n\r\n      (Some one has opened a door and the music of a waltz surges into\r\n      the room. ROSALIND rises.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Listen! they\xe2\x80\x99re playing \xe2\x80\x9cKiss Me Again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      (He looks at her.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Well?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Well?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (Softly\xe2\x80\x94the battle lost) I love you.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I love you\xe2\x80\x94now.\r\n\r\n      (They kiss.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Oh, God, what have I done?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Nothing. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk. Kiss me again.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why or how, but I love you\xe2\x80\x94from the moment I\r\n      saw you.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Me too\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94oh, to-night\xe2\x80\x99s to-night.\r\n\r\n      (Her brother strolls in, starts and then in a loud voice says:\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d and goes.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Her lips scarcely stirring) Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me go\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      care who knows what I do.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Say it!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I love you\xe2\x80\x94now. (They part.) Oh\xe2\x80\x94I am very youthful,\r\n      thank God\xe2\x80\x94and rather beautiful, thank God\xe2\x80\x94and happy, thank God,\r\n      thank God\xe2\x80\x94(She pauses and then, in an odd burst of prophecy,\r\n      adds) Poor Amory!\r\n\r\n      (He kisses her again.)\r\n\r\n\r\n      KISMET\r\n\r\n      Within two weeks Amory and Rosalind were deeply and passionately\r\n      in love. The critical qualities which had spoiled for each of\r\n      them a dozen romances were dulled by the great wave of emotion\r\n      that washed over them.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be an insane love-affair,\xe2\x80\x9d she told her anxious mother,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s not inane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The wave swept Amory into an advertising agency early in March,\r\n      where he alternated between astonishing bursts of rather\r\n      exceptional work and wild dreams of becoming suddenly rich and\r\n      touring Italy with Rosalind.\r\n\r\n      They were together constantly, for lunch, for dinner, and nearly\r\n      every evening\xe2\x80\x94always in a sort of breathless hush, as if they\r\n      feared that any minute the spell would break and drop them out of\r\n      this paradise of rose and flame. But the spell became a trance,\r\n      seemed to increase from day to day; they began to talk of\r\n      marrying in July\xe2\x80\x94in June. All life was transmitted into terms of\r\n      their love, all experience, all desires, all ambitions, were\r\n      nullified\xe2\x80\x94their senses of humor crawled into corners to sleep;\r\n      their former love-affairs seemed faintly laughable and scarcely\r\n      regretted juvenalia.\r\n\r\n      For the second time in his life Amory had had a complete\r\n      bouleversement and was hurrying into line with his generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n      A LITTLE INTERLUDE\r\n\r\n      Amory wandered slowly up the avenue and thought of the night as\r\n      inevitably his\xe2\x80\x94the pageantry and carnival of rich dusk and dim\r\n      streets ... it seemed that he had closed the book of fading\r\n      harmonies at last and stepped into the sensuous vibrant walks of\r\n      life. Everywhere these countless lights, this promise of a night\r\n      of streets and singing\xe2\x80\x94he moved in a half-dream through the crowd\r\n      as if expecting to meet Rosalind hurrying toward him with eager\r\n      feet from every corner.... How the unforgettable faces of dusk\r\n      would blend to her, the myriad footsteps, a thousand overtures,\r\n      would blend to her footsteps; and there would be more drunkenness\r\n      than wine in the softness of her eyes on his. Even his dreams now\r\n      were faint violins drifting like summer sounds upon the summer\r\n      air.\r\n\r\n      The room was in darkness except for the faint glow of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      cigarette where he lounged by the open window. As the door shut\r\n      behind him, Amory stood a moment with his back against it.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Benvenuto Blaine. How went the advertising business\r\n      to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory sprawled on a couch.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI loathed it as usual!\xe2\x80\x9d The momentary vision of the bustling\r\n      agency was displaced quickly by another picture.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! She\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom sighed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Amory, \xe2\x80\x9cjust how wonderful she is. I\r\n      don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any one to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Another sigh came from the window\xe2\x80\x94quite a resigned sigh.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s life and hope and happiness, my whole world now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He felt the quiver of a tear on his eyelid.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _Golly_, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      BITTER SWEET\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSit like we do,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n      He sat in the big chair and held out his arms so that she could\r\n      nestle inside them.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you\xe2\x80\x99d come to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly, \xe2\x80\x9clike summer, just\r\n      when I needed you most... darling... darling...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      His lips moved lazily over her face.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou _taste_ so good,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean, lover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, just sweet, just sweet...\xe2\x80\x9d he held her closer.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for me I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry\r\n      you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t have much at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts when you reproach yourself for what\r\n      you can\xe2\x80\x99t give me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got your precious self\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough\r\n      for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTell me...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Oh, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I want to hear you say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, Amory, with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAlways, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll my life\xe2\x80\x94Oh, Amory\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI want to belong to you. I want your people to be my people. I\r\n      want to have your babies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me, Amory. Just kiss me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do what you want,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do what _you_ want. We\xe2\x80\x99re _you_\xe2\x80\x94not me. Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\n      much a part, so much all of me...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so happy that I\xe2\x80\x99m frightened. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be awful if this\r\n      was\xe2\x80\x94was the high point?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She looked at him dreamily.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBeauty and love pass, I know.... Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s sadness, too. I\r\n      suppose all great happiness is a little sad. Beauty means the\r\n      scent of roses and then the death of roses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBeauty means the agony of sacrifice and the end of agony....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Amory, we\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful, I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure God loves us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe loves you. You\xe2\x80\x99re his most precious possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not his, I\xe2\x80\x99m yours. Amory, I belong to you. For the first\r\n      time I regret all the other kisses; now I know how much a kiss\r\n      can mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Then they would smoke and he would tell her about his day at the\r\n      office\xe2\x80\x94and where they might live. Sometimes, when he was\r\n      particularly loquacious, she went to sleep in his arms, but he\r\n      loved that Rosalind\xe2\x80\x94all Rosalinds\xe2\x80\x94as he had never in the world\r\n      loved any one else. Intangibly fleeting, unrememberable hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n      AQUATIC INCIDENT\r\n\r\n      One day Amory and Howard Gillespie meeting by accident down-town\r\n      took lunch together, and Amory heard a story that delighted him.\r\n      Gillespie after several cocktails was in a talkative mood; he\r\n      began by telling Amory that he was sure Rosalind was slightly\r\n      eccentric.\r\n\r\n      He had gone with her on a swimming party up in Westchester\r\n      County, and some one mentioned that Annette Kellerman had been\r\n      there one day on a visit and had dived from the top of a rickety,\r\n      thirty-foot summer-house. Immediately Rosalind insisted that\r\n      Howard should climb up with her to see what it looked like.\r\n\r\n      A minute later, as he sat and dangled his feet on the edge, a\r\n      form shot by him; Rosalind, her arms spread in a beautiful swan\r\n      dive, had sailed through the air into the clear water.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course _I_ had to go, after that\xe2\x80\x94and I nearly killed myself.\r\n      I thought I was pretty good to even try it. Nobody else in the\r\n      party tried it. Well, afterward Rosalind had the nerve to ask me\r\n      why I stooped over when I dove. \xe2\x80\x98It didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it any easier,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      she said, \xe2\x80\x98it just took all the courage out of it.\xe2\x80\x99 I ask you,\r\n      what can a man do with a girl like that? Unnecessary, I call it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Gillespie failed to understand why Amory was smiling delightedly\r\n      all through lunch. He thought perhaps he was one of these hollow\r\n      optimists.\r\n\r\n\r\n      FIVE WEEKS LATER\r\n\r\n      Again the library of the Connage house. ROSALIND is alone,\r\n      sitting on the lounge staring very moodily and unhappily at\r\n      nothing. She has changed perceptibly\xe2\x80\x94she is a trifle thinner for\r\n      one thing; the light in her eyes is not so bright; she looks\r\n      easily a year older.\r\n\r\n      Her mother comes in, muffled in an opera-cloak. She takes in\r\n      ROSALIND with a nervous glance.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Who is coming to-night?\r\n\r\n      (ROSALIND fails to hear her, at least takes no notice.)\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Alec is coming up to take me to this Barrie play,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEt tu, Brutus.\xe2\x80\x9d (She perceives that she is talking to herself.)\r\n      Rosalind! I asked you who is coming to-night?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Starting) Oh\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x94oh\xe2\x80\x94Amory\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: (Sarcastically) You have so _many_ admirers lately\r\n      that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine _which_ one. (ROSALIND doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer.)\r\n      Dawson Ryder is more patient than I thought he\xe2\x80\x99d be. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      given him an evening this week.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (With a very weary expression that is quite new to her\r\n      face.) Mother\xe2\x80\x94please\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Oh, _I_ won\xe2\x80\x99t interfere. You\xe2\x80\x99ve already wasted over\r\n      two months on a theoretical genius who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a penny to his\r\n      name, but _go_ ahead, waste your life on him. _I_ won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      interfere.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (As if repeating a tiresome lesson) You know he has a\r\n      little income\xe2\x80\x94and you know he\xe2\x80\x99s earning thirty-five dollars a\r\n      week in advertising\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: And it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy your clothes. (She pauses but\r\n      ROSALIND makes no reply.) I have your best interests at heart\r\n      when I tell you not to take a step you\xe2\x80\x99ll spend your days\r\n      regretting. It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if your father could help you. Things\r\n      have been hard for him lately and he\xe2\x80\x99s an old man. You\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\n      dependent absolutely on a dreamer, a nice, well-born boy, but a\r\n      dreamer\xe2\x80\x94merely _clever_. (She implies that this quality in itself\r\n      is rather vicious.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: For heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, mother\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      (A maid appears, announces Mr. Blaine who follows immediately.\r\n      AMORY\xe2\x80\x99S friends have been telling him for ten days that he \xe2\x80\x9clooks\r\n      like the wrath of God,\xe2\x80\x9d and he does. As a matter of fact he has\r\n      not been able to eat a mouthful in the last thirty-six hours.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Good evening, Mrs. Connage.\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: (Not unkindly) Good evening, Amory.\r\n\r\n      (AMORY and ROSALIND exchange glances\xe2\x80\x94and ALEC comes in. ALEC\xe2\x80\x99S\r\n      attitude throughout has been neutral. He believes in his heart\r\n      that the marriage would make AMORY mediocre and ROSALIND\r\n      miserable, but he feels a great sympathy for both of them.)\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Hi, Amory!\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Hi, Alec! Tom said he\xe2\x80\x99d meet you at the theatre.\r\n\r\n      ALEC: Yeah, just saw him. How\xe2\x80\x99s the advertising to-day? Write\r\n      some brilliant copy?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the same. I got a raise\xe2\x80\x94(Every one looks at\r\n      him rather eagerly)\xe2\x80\x94of two dollars a week. (General collapse.)\r\n\r\n      MRS. CONNAGE: Come, Alec, I hear the car.\r\n\r\n      (A good night, rather chilly in sections. After MRS. CONNAGE and\r\n      ALEC go out there is a pause. ROSALIND still stares moodily at\r\n      the fireplace. AMORY goes to her and puts his arm around her.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Darling girl.\r\n\r\n      (They kiss. Another pause and then she seizes his hand, covers it\r\n      with kisses and holds it to her breast.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Sadly) I love your hands, more than anything. I see\r\n      them often when you\xe2\x80\x99re away from me\xe2\x80\x94so tired; I know every line\r\n      of them. Dear hands!\r\n\r\n      (Their eyes meet for a second and then she begins to cry\xe2\x80\x94a\r\n      tearless sobbing.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Rosalind!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re so darned pitiful!\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Rosalind!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, I want to die!\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Rosalind, another night of this and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to pieces.\r\n      You\xe2\x80\x99ve been this way four days now. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be more\r\n      encouraging or I can\xe2\x80\x99t work or eat or sleep. (He looks around\r\n      helplessly as if searching for new words to clothe an old,\r\n      shopworn phrase.) We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make a start. I like having to\r\n      make a start together. (His forced hopefulness fades as he sees\r\n      her unresponsive.) What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? (He gets up suddenly and\r\n      starts to pace the floor.) It\xe2\x80\x99s Dawson Ryder, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.\r\n      He\xe2\x80\x99s been working on your nerves. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been with him every\r\n      afternoon for a week. People come and tell me they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you\r\n      together, and I have to smile and nod and pretend it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\n      slightest significance for me. And you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me anything as\r\n      it develops.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Amory, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t sit down I\xe2\x80\x99ll scream.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (Sitting down suddenly beside her) Oh, Lord.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Taking his hand gently) You know I love you, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      you?\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Yes.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: You know I\xe2\x80\x99ll always love you\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk that way; you frighten me. It sounds as if we\r\n      weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to have each other. (She cries a little and rising\r\n      from the couch goes to the armchair.) I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt all afternoon\r\n      that things were worse. I nearly went wild down at the\r\n      office\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write a line. Tell me everything.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to tell, I say. I\xe2\x80\x99m just nervous.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Rosalind, you\xe2\x80\x99re playing with the idea of marrying Dawson\r\n      Ryder.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (After a pause) He\xe2\x80\x99s been asking me to all day.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s got his nerve!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (After another pause) I like him.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. It hurts me.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be a silly idiot. You know you\xe2\x80\x99re the only man\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever loved, ever will love.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (Quickly) Rosalind, let\xe2\x80\x99s get married\xe2\x80\x94next week.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: We can\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Why not?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, we can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99d be your squaw\xe2\x80\x94in some horrible place.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: We\xe2\x80\x99ll have two hundred and seventy-five dollars a month\r\n      all told.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Darling, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even do my own hair, usually.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it for you.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Between a laugh and a sob) Thanks.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Rosalind, you _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ be thinking of marrying some one\r\n      else. Tell me! You leave me in the dark. I can help you fight it\r\n      out if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only tell me.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: It\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\x94us. We\xe2\x80\x99re pitiful, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. The very\r\n      qualities I love you for are the ones that will always make you a\r\n      failure.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (Grimly) Go on.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh\xe2\x80\x94it _is_ Dawson Ryder. He\xe2\x80\x99s so reliable, I almost\r\n      feel that he\xe2\x80\x99d be a\xe2\x80\x94a background.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: You don\xe2\x80\x99t love him.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I know, but I respect him, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a good man and a\r\n      strong one.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (Grudgingly) Yes\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s that.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Well\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s one little thing. There was a little poor\r\n      boy we met in Rye Tuesday afternoon\xe2\x80\x94and, oh, Dawson took him on\r\n      his lap and talked to him and promised him an Indian suit\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      next day he remembered and bought it\xe2\x80\x94and, oh, it was so sweet and\r\n      I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking he\xe2\x80\x99d be so nice to\xe2\x80\x94to our children\xe2\x80\x94take\r\n      care of them\xe2\x80\x94and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (In despair) Rosalind! Rosalind!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (With a faint roguishness) Don\xe2\x80\x99t look so consciously\r\n      suffering.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: What power we have of hurting each other!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Commencing to sob again) It\xe2\x80\x99s been so perfect\xe2\x80\x94you and\r\n      I. So like a dream that I\xe2\x80\x99d longed for and never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n      find. The first real unselfishness I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever felt in my life. And\r\n      I can\xe2\x80\x99t see it fade out in a colorless atmosphere!\r\n\r\n      AMORY: It won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94it won\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I\xe2\x80\x99d rather keep it as a beautiful memory\xe2\x80\x94tucked away in\r\n      my heart.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Yes, women can do that\xe2\x80\x94but not men. I\xe2\x80\x99d remember always,\r\n      not the beauty of it while it lasted, but just the bitterness,\r\n      the long bitterness.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Don\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\n\r\n      AMORY: All the years never to see you, never to kiss you, just a\r\n      gate shut and barred\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t dare be my wife.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: No\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the hardest course, the strongest\r\n      course. Marrying you would be a failure and I never fail\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\n      don\xe2\x80\x99t stop walking up and down I\xe2\x80\x99ll scream!\r\n\r\n      (Again he sinks despairingly onto the lounge.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Come over here and kiss me.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: No.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you _want_ to kiss me?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: To-night I want you to love me calmly and coolly.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: The beginning of the end.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (With a burst of insight) Amory, you\xe2\x80\x99re young. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      young. People excuse us now for our poses and vanities, for\r\n      treating people like Sancho and yet getting away with it. They\r\n      excuse us now. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of knocks coming to you\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      AMORY: And you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid to take them with me.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: No, not that. There was a poem I read somewhere\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n      say Ella Wheeler Wilcox and laugh\xe2\x80\x94but listen:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cFor this is wisdom\xe2\x80\x94to love and live, To take what fate or the gods\r\n   may give, To ask no question, to make no prayer, To kiss the lips\r\n   and caress the hair, Speed passion\xe2\x80\x99s ebb as we greet its flow, To\r\n   have and to hold, and, in time\xe2\x80\x94let go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      AMORY: But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Amory, I\xe2\x80\x99m yours\xe2\x80\x94you know it. There have been times in\r\n      the last month I\xe2\x80\x99d have been completely yours if you\xe2\x80\x99d said so.\r\n      But I can\xe2\x80\x99t marry you and ruin both our lives.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take our chance for happiness.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Dawson says I\xe2\x80\x99d learn to love him.\r\n\r\n      (AMORY with his head sunk in his hands does not move. The life\r\n      seems suddenly gone out of him.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Lover! Lover! I can\xe2\x80\x99t do with you, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine\r\n      life without you.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Rosalind, we\xe2\x80\x99re on each other\xe2\x80\x99s nerves. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that\r\n      we\xe2\x80\x99re both high-strung, and this week\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      (His voice is curiously old. She crosses to him and taking his\r\n      face in her hands, kisses him.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I can\xe2\x80\x99t, Amory. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be shut away from the trees and\r\n      flowers, cooped up in a little flat, waiting for you. You\xe2\x80\x99d hate\r\n      me in a narrow atmosphere. I\xe2\x80\x99d make you hate me.\r\n\r\n      (Again she is blinded by sudden uncontrolled tears.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Rosalind\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, darling, go\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t make it harder! I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (His face drawn, his voice strained) Do you know what\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x99re saying? Do you mean forever?\r\n\r\n      (There is a difference somehow in the quality of their\r\n      suffering.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      AMORY: I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t if you love me. You\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of taking\r\n      two years\xe2\x80\x99 knocks with me.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the Rosalind you love.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (A little hysterically) I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you up! I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\n      that\xe2\x80\x99s all! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have you!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (A hard note in her voice) You\xe2\x80\x99re being a baby now.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (Wildly) I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! You\xe2\x80\x99re spoiling our lives!\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: I\xe2\x80\x99m doing the wise thing, the only thing.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Are you going to marry Dawson Ryder?\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me. You know I\xe2\x80\x99m old in some ways\xe2\x80\x94in\r\n      others\xe2\x80\x94well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a little girl. I like sunshine and pretty\r\n      things and cheerfulness\xe2\x80\x94and I dread responsibility. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\n      to think about pots and kitchens and brooms. I want to worry\r\n      whether my legs will get slick and brown when I swim in the\r\n      summer.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: And you love me.\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: That\xe2\x80\x99s just why it has to end. Drifting hurts too much.\r\n      We can\xe2\x80\x99t have any more scenes like this.\r\n\r\n      (She draws his ring from her finger and hands it to him. Their\r\n      eyes blind again with tears.)\r\n\r\n      AMORY: (His lips against her wet cheek) Don\xe2\x80\x99t! Keep it,\r\n      please\xe2\x80\x94oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t break my heart!\r\n\r\n      (She presses the ring softly into his hand.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: (Brokenly) You\xe2\x80\x99d better go.\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Good-by\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      (She looks at him once more, with infinite longing, infinite\r\n      sadness.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Don\xe2\x80\x99t ever forget me, Amory\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      AMORY: Good-by\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      (He goes to the door, fumbles for the knob, finds it\xe2\x80\x94she sees him\r\n      throw back his head\xe2\x80\x94and he is gone. Gone\xe2\x80\x94she half starts from the\r\n      lounge and then sinks forward on her face into the pillows.)\r\n\r\n      ROSALIND: Oh, God, I want to die! (After a moment she rises and\r\n      with her eyes closed feels her way to the door. Then she turns\r\n      and looks once more at the room. Here they had sat and dreamed:\r\n      that tray she had so often filled with matches for him; that\r\n      shade that they had discreetly lowered one long Sunday afternoon.\r\n      Misty-eyed she stands and remembers; she speaks aloud.) Oh,\r\n      Amory, what have I done to you?\r\n\r\n      (And deep under the aching sadness that will pass in time,\r\n      Rosalind feels that she has lost something, she knows not what,\r\n      she knows not why.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER 2. Experiments in Convalescence\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Knickerbocker Bar, beamed upon by Maxfield Parrish\xe2\x80\x99s jovial,\r\n      colorful \xe2\x80\x9cOld King Cole,\xe2\x80\x9d was well crowded. Amory stopped in the\r\n      entrance and looked at his wrist-watch; he wanted particularly to\r\n      know the time, for something in his mind that catalogued and\r\n      classified liked to chip things off cleanly. Later it would\r\n      satisfy him in a vague way to be able to think \xe2\x80\x9cthat thing ended\r\n      at exactly twenty minutes after eight on Thursday, June 10,\r\n      1919.\xe2\x80\x9d This was allowing for the walk from her house\xe2\x80\x94a walk\r\n      concerning which he had afterward not the faintest recollection.\r\n\r\n      He was in rather grotesque condition: two days of worry and\r\n      nervousness, of sleepless nights, of untouched meals, culminating\r\n      in the emotional crisis and Rosalind\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt decision\xe2\x80\x94the strain\r\n      of it had drugged the foreground of his mind into a merciful\r\n      coma. As he fumbled clumsily with the olives at the free-lunch\r\n      table, a man approached and spoke to him, and the olives dropped\r\n      from his nervous hands.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Amory...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It was some one he had known at Princeton; he had no idea of the\r\n      name.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello, old boy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he heard himself saying.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cName\xe2\x80\x99s Jim Wilson\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSure, you bet, Jim. I remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGoing to reunion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou know!\xe2\x80\x9d Simultaneously he realized that he was not going to\r\n      reunion.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGet overseas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory nodded, his eyes staring oddly. Stepping back to let some\r\n      one pass, he knocked the dish of olives to a crash on the floor.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cToo bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cHave a drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Wilson, ponderously diplomatic, reached over and slapped him on\r\n      the back.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had plenty, old boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory eyed him dumbly until Wilson grew embarrassed under the\r\n      scrutiny.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPlenty, hell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory finally. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a drink\r\n      to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Wilson looked incredulous.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHave a drink or not?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Amory rudely.\r\n\r\n      Together they sought the bar.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRye high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just take a Bronx.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Wilson had another; Amory had several more. They decided to sit\r\n      down. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Wilson was displaced by Carling, class of\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9915. Amory, his head spinning gorgeously, layer upon layer of\r\n      soft satisfaction setting over the bruised spots of his spirit,\r\n      was discoursing volubly on the war.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99S a mental was\xe2\x80\x99e,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted with owl-like wisdom. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo years\r\n      my life spent inalleshual vacuity. Los\xe2\x80\x99 idealism, got be physcal\r\n      anmal,\xe2\x80\x9d he shook his fist expressively at Old King Cole, \xe2\x80\x9cgot be\r\n      Prussian \xe2\x80\x99bout ev\xe2\x80\x99thing, women \xe2\x80\x99specially.

Now don\xe2\x80\x99givadam.\xe2\x80\x9d He expressed his lack of\r\n      principle by sweeping a seltzer bottle with a broad gesture to\r\n      noisy extinction on the floor, but this did not interrupt his\r\n      speech. \xe2\x80\x9cSeek pleasure where find it for to-morrow die. \xe2\x80\x99At\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      philos\xe2\x80\x99phy for me now on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Carling yawned, but Amory, waxing brilliant, continued:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cUse\xe2\x80\x99 wonder \xe2\x80\x99bout things\xe2\x80\x94people satisfied compromise,\r\n      fif\xe2\x80\x99y-fif\xe2\x80\x99y att\xe2\x80\x99tude on life. Now don\xe2\x80\x99 wonder, don\xe2\x80\x99 wonder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\n      became so emphatic in impressing on Carling the fact that he\r\n      didn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder that he lost the thread of his discourse and\r\n      concluded by announcing to the bar at large that he was a\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cphyscal anmal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you celebrating, Amory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory leaned forward confidentially.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCel\xe2\x80\x99brating blowmylife. Great moment blow my life. Can\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\n      you \xe2\x80\x99bout it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He heard Carling addressing a remark to the bartender:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGive him a bromo-seltzer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory shook his head indignantly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNone that stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut listen, Amory, you\xe2\x80\x99re making yourself sick. You\xe2\x80\x99re white as\r\n      a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory considered the question. He tried to look at himself in the\r\n      mirror but even by squinting up one eye could only see as far as\r\n      the row of bottles behind the bar.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLike som\xe2\x80\x99n solid. We go get some\xe2\x80\x94some salad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He settled his coat with an attempt at nonchalance, but letting\r\n      go of the bar was too much for him, and he slumped against a\r\n      chair.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go over to Shanley\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Carling, offering an\r\n      elbow.\r\n\r\n      With this assistance Amory managed to get his legs in motion\r\n      enough to propel him across Forty-second Street.\r\n\r\n      Shanley\xe2\x80\x99s was very dim. He was conscious that he was talking in a\r\n      loud voice, very succinctly and convincingly, he thought, about a\r\n      desire to crush people under his heel. He consumed three club\r\n      sandwiches, devouring each as though it were no larger than a\r\n      chocolate-drop. Then Rosalind began popping into his mind again,\r\n      and he found his lips forming her name over and over. Next he was\r\n      sleepy, and he had a hazy, listless sense of people in dress\r\n      suits, probably waiters, gathering around the table....\r\n\r\n      ... He was in a room and Carling was saying something about a\r\n      knot in his shoe-lace.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNemmine,\xe2\x80\x9d he managed to articulate drowsily. \xe2\x80\x9cSleep in \xe2\x80\x99em....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      STILL ALCOHOLIC\r\n\r\n      He awoke laughing and his eyes lazily roamed his surroundings,\r\n      evidently a bedroom and bath in a good hotel. His head was\r\n      whirring and picture after picture was forming and blurring and\r\n      melting before his eyes, but beyond the desire to laugh he had no\r\n      entirely conscious reaction. He reached for the \xe2\x80\x99phone beside his\r\n      bed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello\xe2\x80\x94what hotel is this\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cKnickerbocker? All right, send up two rye high-balls\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He lay for a moment and wondered idly whether they\xe2\x80\x99d send up a\r\n      bottle or just two of those little glass containers. Then, with\r\n      an effort, he struggled out of bed and ambled into the bathroom.\r\n\r\n      When he emerged, rubbing himself lazily with a towel, he found\r\n      the bar boy with the drinks and had a sudden desire to kid him.\r\n      On reflection he decided that this would be undignified, so he\r\n      waved him away.\r\n\r\n      As the new alcohol tumbled into his stomach and warmed him, the\r\n      isolated pictures began slowly to form a cinema reel of the day\r\n      before. Again he saw Rosalind curled weeping among the pillows,\r\n      again he felt her tears against his cheek. Her words began\r\n      ringing in his ears: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ever forget me, Amory\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\n      forget me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHell!\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered aloud, and then he choked and collapsed on\r\n      the bed in a shaken spasm of grief. After a minute he opened his\r\n      eyes and regarded the ceiling.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDamned fool!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in disgust, and with a voluminous\r\n      sigh rose and approached the bottle. After another glass he gave\r\n      way loosely to the luxury of tears. Purposely he called up into\r\n      his mind little incidents of the vanished spring, phrased to\r\n      himself emotions that would make him react even more strongly to\r\n      sorrow.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe were so happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he intoned dramatically, \xe2\x80\x9cso very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      Then he gave way again and knelt beside the bed, his head\r\n      half-buried in the pillow.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy own girl\xe2\x80\x94my own\xe2\x80\x94Oh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He clinched his teeth so that the tears streamed in a flood from\r\n      his eyes.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh... my baby girl, all I had, all I wanted!... Oh, my girl,\r\n      come back, come back! I need you... need you... we\xe2\x80\x99re so pitiful\r\n      ... just misery we brought each other.... She\xe2\x80\x99ll be shut away\r\n      from me.... I can\xe2\x80\x99t see her; I can\xe2\x80\x99t be her friend. It\xe2\x80\x99s got to\r\n      be that way\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      And then again:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been so happy, so very happy....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He rose to his feet and threw himself on the bed in an ecstasy of\r\n      sentiment, and then lay exhausted while he realized slowly that\r\n      he had been very drunk the night before, and that his head was\r\n      spinning again wildly. He laughed, rose, and crossed again to\r\n      Lethe....\r\n\r\n      At noon he ran into a crowd in the Biltmore bar, and the riot\r\n      began again. He had a vague recollection afterward of discussing\r\n      French poetry with a British officer who was introduced to him as\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Corn, of his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Foot,\xe2\x80\x9d and he remembered\r\n      attempting to recite \xe2\x80\x9cClair de Lune\xe2\x80\x9d at luncheon; then he slept\r\n      in a big, soft chair until almost five o\xe2\x80\x99clock when another crowd\r\n      found and woke him; there followed an alcoholic dressing of\r\n      several temperaments for the ordeal of dinner. They selected\r\n      theatre tickets at Tyson\xe2\x80\x99s for a play that had a four-drink\r\n      programme\xe2\x80\x94a play with two monotonous voices, with turbid, gloomy\r\n      scenes, and lighting effects that were hard to follow when his\r\n      eyes behaved so amazingly. He imagined afterward that it must\r\n      have been \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jest.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n      ... Then the Cocoanut Grove, where Amory slept again on a little\r\n      balcony outside. Out in Shanley\xe2\x80\x99s, Yonkers, he became almost\r\n      logical, and by a careful control of the number of high-balls he\r\n      drank, grew quite lucid and garrulous. He found that the party\r\n      consisted of five men, two of whom he knew slightly; he became\r\n      righteous about paying his share of the expense and insisted in a\r\n      loud voice on arranging everything then and there to the\r\n      amusement of the tables around him....\r\n\r\n      Some one mentioned that a famous cabaret star was at the next\r\n      table, so Amory rose and, approaching gallantly, introduced\r\n      himself... this involved him in an argument, first with her\r\n      escort and then with the headwaiter\xe2\x80\x94Amory\xe2\x80\x99s attitude being a\r\n      lofty and exaggerated courtesy... he consented, after being\r\n      confronted with irrefutable logic, to being led back to his own\r\n      table.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDecided to commit suicide,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced suddenly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhen? Next year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNow. To-morrow morning. Going to take a room at the Commodore,\r\n      get into a hot bath and open a vein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s getting morbid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou need another rye, old boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll all talk it over to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      But Amory was not to be dissuaded, from argument at least.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever get that way?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded confidentially\r\n      fortaccio.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOften?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy chronic state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      This provoked discussion. One man said that he got so depressed\r\n      sometimes that he seriously considered it. Another agreed that\r\n      there was nothing to live for. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Corn,\xe2\x80\x9d who had somehow\r\n      rejoined the party, said that in his opinion it was when one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      health was bad that one felt that way most. Amory\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion\r\n      was that they should each order a Bronx, mix broken glass in it,\r\n      and drink it off. To his relief no one applauded the idea, so\r\n      having finished his high-ball, he balanced his chin in his hand\r\n      and his elbow on the table\xe2\x80\x94a most delicate, scarcely noticeable\r\n      sleeping position, he assured himself\xe2\x80\x94and went into a deep\r\n      stupor....\r\n\r\n      He was awakened by a woman clinging to him, a pretty woman, with\r\n      brown, disarranged hair and dark blue eyes.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTake me home!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory, blinking.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI like you,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced tenderly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI like you too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He noticed that there was a noisy man in the background and that\r\n      one of his party was arguing with him.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFella I was with\xe2\x80\x99s a damn fool,\xe2\x80\x9d confided the blue-eyed woman.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI hate him. I want to go home with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Amory with intense wisdom.\r\n\r\n      She nodded coyly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGo home with him,\xe2\x80\x9d he advised gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe brought you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      At this point the noisy man in the background broke away from his\r\n      detainers and approached.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSay!\xe2\x80\x9d he said fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought this girl out here and you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\n      butting in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory regarded him coldly, while the girl clung to him closer.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou let go that girl!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the noisy man.\r\n\r\n      Amory tried to make his eyes threatening.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou go to hell!\xe2\x80\x9d he directed finally, and turned his attention\r\n      to the girl.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLove first sight,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI love you,\xe2\x80\x9d she breathed and nestled close to him. She _did_\r\n      have beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\n      Some one leaned over and spoke in Amory\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just Margaret Diamond. She\xe2\x80\x99s drunk and this fellow here\r\n      brought her. Better let her go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet him take care of her, then!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Amory furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      no W. Y. C. A. worker, am I?\xe2\x80\x94am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet her go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _her_ hanging on, damn it! Let her hang!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The crowd around the table thickened. For an instant a brawl\r\n      threatened, but a sleek waiter bent back Margaret Diamond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      fingers until she released her hold on Amory, whereupon she\r\n      slapped the waiter furiously in the face and flung her arms about\r\n      her raging original escort.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, the taxis are getting scarce!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCheck, waiter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon, Amory. Your romance is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory laughed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how true you spoke. No idea. \xe2\x80\x99At\xe2\x80\x99s the whole\r\n      trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      AMORY ON THE LABOR QUESTION\r\n\r\n      Two mornings later he knocked at the president\xe2\x80\x99s door at Bascome\r\n      and Barlow\xe2\x80\x99s advertising agency.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory entered unsteadily.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Morning, Mr. Barlow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Mr. Barlow brought his glasses to the inspection and set his\r\n      mouth slightly ajar that he might better listen.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Blaine. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you for several days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quitting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94this is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I thought our relations had been quite\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94pleasant.\r\n      You seemed to be a hard worker\xe2\x80\x94a little inclined perhaps to write\r\n      fancy copy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI just got tired of it,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Amory rudely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      matter a damn to me whether Harebell\xe2\x80\x99s flour was any better than\r\n      any one else\xe2\x80\x99s. In fact, I never ate any of it. So I got tired of\r\n      telling people about it\xe2\x80\x94oh, I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been drinking\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Mr. Barlow\xe2\x80\x99s face steeled by several ingots of expression.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou asked for a position\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory waved him to silence.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think I was rottenly underpaid. Thirty-five dollars a\r\n      week\xe2\x80\x94less than a good carpenter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou had just started. You\xe2\x80\x99d never worked before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\n      Barlow coolly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut it took about ten thousand dollars to educate me where I\r\n      could write your darned stuff for you. Anyway, as far as length\r\n      of service goes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got stenographers here you\xe2\x80\x99ve paid\r\n      fifteen a week for five years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to argue with you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Barlow rising.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNeither am I. I just wanted to tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m quitting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They stood for a moment looking at each other impassively and\r\n      then Amory turned and left the office.\r\n\r\n\r\n      A LITTLE LULL\r\n\r\n      Four days after that he returned at last to the apartment. Tom\r\n      was engaged on a book review for The New Democracy on the staff\r\n      of which he was employed. They regarded each other for a moment\r\n      in silence.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, Amory, where\xe2\x80\x99d you get the black eye\xe2\x80\x94and the jaw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory laughed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a mere nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He peeled off his coat and bared his shoulders.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLook here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom emitted a low whistle.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat hit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory laughed again.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, a lot of people. I got beaten up. Fact.\xe2\x80\x9d He slowly replaced\r\n      his shirt. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was bound to come sooner or later and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      have missed it for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWho was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, there were some waiters and a couple of sailors and a few\r\n      stray pedestrians, I guess. It\xe2\x80\x99s the strangest feeling. You ought\r\n      to get beaten up just for the experience of it. You fall down\r\n      after a while and everybody sort of slashes in at you before you\r\n      hit the ground\xe2\x80\x94then they kick you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom lighted a cigarette.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI spent a day chasing you all over town, Amory. But you always\r\n      kept a little ahead of me. I\xe2\x80\x99d say you\xe2\x80\x99ve been on some party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory tumbled into a chair and asked for a cigarette.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou sober now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tom quizzically.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPretty sober. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Alec has left. His family had been after him to go home\r\n      and live, so he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      A spasm of pain shook Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cToo bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is too bad. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get some one else if we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\n      going to stay here. The rent\xe2\x80\x99s going up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSure. Get anybody. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to you, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory walked into his bedroom. The first thing that met his\r\n      glance was a photograph of Rosalind that he had intended to have\r\n      framed, propped up against a mirror on his dresser. He looked at\r\n      it unmoved. After the vivid mental pictures of her that were his\r\n      portion at present, the portrait was curiously unreal. He went\r\n      back into the study.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGot a cardboard box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Tom, puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I have? Oh, yes\xe2\x80\x94there\r\n      may be one in Alec\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Eventually Amory found what he was looking for and, returning to\r\n      his dresser, opened a drawer full of letters, notes, part of a\r\n      chain, two little handkerchiefs, and some snap-shots. As he\r\n      transferred them carefully to the box his mind wandered to some\r\n      place in a book where the hero, after preserving for a year a\r\n      cake of his lost love\xe2\x80\x99s soap, finally washed his hands with it.\r\n      He laughed and began to hum \xe2\x80\x9cAfter you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone\xe2\x80\x9d ... ceased\r\n      abruptly...\r\n\r\n      The string broke twice, and then he managed to secure it, dropped\r\n      the package into the bottom of his trunk, and having slammed the\r\n      lid returned to the study.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGoing out?\xe2\x80\x9d Tom\xe2\x80\x99s voice held an undertone of anxiety.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cUh-huh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say, old keed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have dinner together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSorry. I told Sukey Brett I\xe2\x80\x99d eat with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBy-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory crossed the street and had a high-ball; then he walked to\r\n      Washington Square and found a top seat on a bus. He disembarked\r\n      at Forty-third Street and strolled to the Biltmore bar.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHi, Amory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYo-ho! Waiter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      TEMPERATURE NORMAL\r\n\r\n      The advent of prohibition with the \xe2\x80\x9cthirsty-first\xe2\x80\x9d put a sudden\r\n      stop to the submerging of Amory\xe2\x80\x99s sorrows, and when he awoke one\r\n      morning to find that the old bar-to-bar days were over, he had\r\n      neither remorse for the past three weeks nor regret that their\r\n      repetition was impossible. He had taken the most violent, if the\r\n      weakest, method to shield himself from the stabs of memory, and\r\n      while it was not a course he would have prescribed for others, he\r\n      found in the end that it had done its business: he was over the\r\n      first flush of pain.\r\n\r\n      Don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand! Amory had loved Rosalind as he would never\r\n      love another living person. She had taken the first flush of his\r\n      youth and brought from his unplumbed depths tenderness that had\r\n      surprised him, gentleness and unselfishness that he had never\r\n      given to another creature. He had later love-affairs, but of a\r\n      different sort: in those he went back to that, perhaps, more\r\n      typical frame of mind, in which the girl became the mirror of a\r\n      mood in him. Rosalind had drawn out what was more than passionate\r\n      admiration; he had a deep, undying affection for Rosalind.\r\n\r\n      But there had been, near the end, so much dramatic tragedy,\r\n      culminating in the arabesque nightmare of his three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 spree,\r\n      that he was emotionally worn out. The people and surroundings\r\n      that he remembered as being cool or delicately artificial, seemed\r\n      to promise him a refuge. He wrote a cynical story which featured\r\n      his father\xe2\x80\x99s funeral and despatched it to a magazine, receiving\r\n      in return a check for sixty dollars and a request for more of the\r\n      same tone. This tickled his vanity, but inspired him to no\r\n      further effort.\r\n\r\n      He read enormously. He was puzzled and depressed by \xe2\x80\x9cA Portrait\r\n      of the Artist as a Young Man\xe2\x80\x9d; intensely interested by \xe2\x80\x9cJoan and\r\n      Peter\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Undying Fire,\xe2\x80\x9d and rather surprised by his\r\n      discovery through a critic named Mencken of several excellent\r\n      American novels: \xe2\x80\x9cVandover and the Brute,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Damnation of\r\n      Theron Ware,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cJennie Gerhardt.\xe2\x80\x9d Mackenzie, Chesterton,\r\n      Galsworthy, Bennett, had sunk in his appreciation from sagacious,\r\n      life-saturated geniuses to merely diverting contemporaries.\r\n      Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s aloof clarity and brilliant consistency and the gloriously\r\n      intoxicated efforts of H. G. Wells to fit the key of romantic\r\n      symmetry into the elusive lock of truth, alone won his rapt\r\n      attention.\r\n\r\n      He wanted to see Monsignor Darcy, to whom he had written when he\r\n      landed, but he had not heard from him; besides he knew that a\r\n      visit to Monsignor would entail the story of Rosalind, and the\r\n      thought of repeating it turned him cold with horror.\r\n\r\n      In his search for cool people he remembered Mrs. Lawrence, a very\r\n      intelligent, very dignified lady, a convert to the church, and a\r\n      great devotee of Monsignor\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n      He called her on the \xe2\x80\x99phone one day. Yes, she remembered him\r\n      perfectly; no, Monsignor wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in town, was in Boston she\r\n      thought; he\xe2\x80\x99d promised to come to dinner when he returned.\r\n      Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t Amory take luncheon with her?\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d better catch up, Mrs. Lawrence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said rather\r\n      ambiguously when he arrived.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMonsignor was here just last week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lawrence\r\n      regretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was very anxious to see you, but he\xe2\x80\x99d left your\r\n      address at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDid he think I\xe2\x80\x99d plunged into Bolshevism?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Amory,\r\n      interested.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s having a frightful time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAbout the Irish Republic. He thinks it lacks dignity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe went to Boston when the Irish President arrived and he was\r\n      greatly distressed because the receiving committee, when they\r\n      rode in an automobile, _would_ put their arms around the\r\n      President.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what impressed you more than anything while you were in\r\n      the army? You look a great deal older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s from another, more disastrous battle,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered,\r\n      smiling in spite of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the army\xe2\x80\x94let me see\xe2\x80\x94well, I\r\n      discovered that physical courage depends to a great extent on the\r\n      physical shape a man is in. I found that I was as brave as the\r\n      next man\xe2\x80\x94it used to worry me before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, the idea that men can stand anything if they get used to\r\n      it, and the fact that I got a high mark in the psychological\r\n      examination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Lawrence laughed. Amory was finding it a great relief to be\r\n      in this cool house on Riverside Drive, away from more condensed\r\n      New York and the sense of people expelling great quantities of\r\n      breath into a little space. Mrs. Lawrence reminded him vaguely of\r\n      Beatrice, not in temperament, but in her perfect grace and\r\n      dignity. The house, its furnishings, the manner in which dinner\r\n      was served, were in immense contrast to what he had met in the\r\n      great places on Long Island, where the servants were so obtrusive\r\n      that they had positively to be bumped out of the way, or even in\r\n      the houses of more conservative \xe2\x80\x9cUnion Club\xe2\x80\x9d families. He\r\n      wondered if this air of symmetrical restraint, this grace, which\r\n      he felt was continental, was distilled through Mrs. Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      New England ancestry or acquired in long residence in Italy and\r\n      Spain.\r\n\r\n      Two glasses of sauterne at luncheon loosened his tongue, and he\r\n      talked, with what he felt was something of his old charm, of\r\n      religion and literature and the menacing phenomena of the social\r\n      order. Mrs. Lawrence was ostensibly pleased with him, and her\r\n      interest was especially in his mind; he wanted people to like his\r\n      mind again\xe2\x80\x94after a while it might be such a nice place in which\r\n      to live.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMonsignor Darcy still thinks that you\xe2\x80\x99re his reincarnation, that\r\n      your faith will eventually clarify.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he assented. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rather pagan at present. It\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\n      that religion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have the slightest bearing on life\r\n      at my age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      When he left her house he walked down Riverside Drive with a\r\n      feeling of satisfaction. It was amusing to discuss again such\r\n      subjects as this young poet, Stephen Vincent Benet, or the Irish\r\n      Republic. Between the rancid accusations of Edward Carson and\r\n      Justice Cohalan he had completely tired of the Irish question;\r\n      yet there had been a time when his own Celtic traits were pillars\r\n      of his personal philosophy.\r\n\r\n      There seemed suddenly to be much left in life, if only this\r\n      revival of old interests did not mean that he was backing away\r\n      from it again\xe2\x80\x94backing away from life itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n      RESTLESSNESS\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m tres old and tres bored, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory one day,\r\n      stretching himself at ease in the comfortable window-seat. He\r\n      always felt most natural in a recumbent position.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou used to be entertaining before you started to write,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n      continued. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you save any idea that you think would do to\r\n      print.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Existence had settled back to an ambitionless normality. They had\r\n      decided that with economy they could still afford the apartment,\r\n      which Tom, with the domesticity of an elderly cat, had grown fond\r\n      of. The old English hunting prints on the wall were Tom\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\n      the large tapestry by courtesy, a relic of decadent days in\r\n      college, and the great profusion of orphaned candlesticks and the\r\n      carved Louis XV chair in which no one could sit more than a\r\n      minute without acute spinal disorders\xe2\x80\x94Tom claimed that this was\r\n      because one was sitting in the lap of Montespan\xe2\x80\x99s wraith\xe2\x80\x94at any\r\n      rate, it was Tom\xe2\x80\x99s furniture that decided them to stay.\r\n\r\n      They went out very little: to an occasional play, or to dinner at\r\n      the Ritz or the Princeton Club. With prohibition the great\r\n      rendezvous had received their death wounds; no longer could one\r\n      wander to the Biltmore bar at twelve or five and find congenial\r\n      spirits, and both Tom and Amory had outgrown the passion for\r\n      dancing with mid-Western or New Jersey debbies at the\r\n      Club-de-Vingt (surnamed the \xe2\x80\x9cClub de Gink\xe2\x80\x9d) or the Plaza Rose\r\n      Room\xe2\x80\x94besides even that required several cocktails \xe2\x80\x9cto come down\r\n      to the intellectual level of the women present,\xe2\x80\x9d as Amory had\r\n      once put it to a horrified matron.\r\n\r\n      Amory had lately received several alarming letters from Mr.\r\n      Barton\xe2\x80\x94the Lake Geneva house was too large to be easily rented;\r\n      the best rent obtainable at present would serve this year to\r\n      little more than pay for the taxes and necessary improvements; in\r\n      fact, the lawyer suggested that the whole property was simply a\r\n      white elephant on Amory\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Nevertheless, even though it\r\n      might not yield a cent for the next three years, Amory decided\r\n      with a vague sentimentality that for the present, at any rate, he\r\n      would not sell the house.\r\n\r\n      This particular day on which he announced his ennui to Tom had\r\n      been quite typical. He had risen at noon, lunched with Mrs.\r\n      Lawrence, and then ridden abstractedly homeward atop one of his\r\n      beloved buses.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you be bored,\xe2\x80\x9d yawned Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that the\r\n      conventional frame of mind for the young man of your age and\r\n      condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory speculatively, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m more than bored; I am\r\n      restless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLove and war did for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory considered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that the war itself had\r\n      any great effect on either you or me\xe2\x80\x94but it certainly ruined the\r\n      old backgrounds, sort of killed individualism out of our\r\n      generation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes it did,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill it out\r\n      of the whole world. Oh, Lord, what a pleasure it used to be to\r\n      dream I might be a really great dictator or writer or religious\r\n      or political leader\xe2\x80\x94and now even a Leonardo da Vinci or Lorenzo\r\n      de Medici couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a real old-fashioned bolt in the world.\r\n      Life is too huge and complex. The world is so overgrown that it\r\n      can\xe2\x80\x99t lift its own fingers, and I was planning to be such an\r\n      important finger\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThere never were men\r\n      placed in such egotistic positions since\xe2\x80\x94oh, since the French\r\n      Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory disagreed violently.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re mistaking this period when every nut is an individualist\r\n      for a period of individualism. Wilson has only been powerful when\r\n      he has represented; he\xe2\x80\x99s had to compromise over and over again.\r\n      Just as soon as Trotsky and Lenin take a definite, consistent\r\n      stand they\xe2\x80\x99ll become merely two-minute figures like Kerensky.\r\n      Even Foch hasn\xe2\x80\x99t half the significance of Stonewall Jackson. War\r\n      used to be the most individualistic pursuit of man, and yet the\r\n      popular heroes of the war had neither authority nor\r\n      responsibility: Guynemer and Sergeant York. How could a schoolboy\r\n      make a hero of Pershing? A big man has no time really to do\r\n      anything but just sit and be big.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t think there will be any more permanent world\r\n      heroes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94in history\xe2\x80\x94not in life. Carlyle would have difficulty\r\n      getting material for a new chapter on \xe2\x80\x98The Hero as a Big Man.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGo on. I\xe2\x80\x99m a good listener to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPeople try so hard to believe in leaders now, pitifully hard.\r\n      But we no sooner get a popular reformer or politician or soldier\r\n      or writer or philosopher\xe2\x80\x94a Roosevelt, a Tolstoi, a Wood, a Shaw,\r\n      a Nietzsche, than the cross-currents of criticism wash him away.\r\n      My Lord, no man can stand prominence these days. It\xe2\x80\x99s the surest\r\n      path to obscurity. People get sick of hearing the same name over\r\n      and over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThen you blame it on the press?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely. Look at you; you\xe2\x80\x99re on The New Democracy, considered\r\n      the most brilliant weekly in the country, read by the men who do\r\n      things and all that. What\xe2\x80\x99s your business? Why, to be as clever,\r\n      as interesting, and as brilliantly cynical as possible about\r\n      every man, doctrine, book, or policy that is assigned you to deal\r\n      with. The more strong lights, the more spiritual scandal you can\r\n      throw on the matter, the more money they pay you, the more the\r\n      people buy the issue. You, Tom d\xe2\x80\x99Invilliers, a blighted Shelley,\r\n      changing, shifting, clever, unscrupulous, represent the critical\r\n      consciousness of the race\xe2\x80\x94Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t protest, I know the stuff. I\r\n      used to write book reviews in college; I considered it rare sport\r\n      to refer to the latest honest, conscientious effort to propound a\r\n      theory or a remedy as a \xe2\x80\x98welcome addition to our light summer\r\n      reading.\xe2\x80\x99 Come on now, admit it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom laughed, and Amory continued triumphantly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe _want_ to believe. Young students try to believe in older\r\n      authors, constituents try to believe in their Congressmen,\r\n      countries try to believe in their statesmen, but they _can\xe2\x80\x99t_.\r\n      Too many voices, too much scattered, illogical, ill-considered\r\n      criticism. It\xe2\x80\x99s worse in the case of newspapers. Any rich,\r\n      unprogressive old party with that particularly grasping,\r\n      acquisitive form of mentality known as financial genius can own a\r\n      paper that is the intellectual meat and drink of thousands of\r\n      tired, hurried men, men too involved in the business of modern\r\n      living to swallow anything but predigested food. For two cents\r\n      the voter buys his politics, prejudices, and philosophy. A year\r\n      later there is a new political ring or a change in the paper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      ownership, consequence: more confusion, more contradiction, a\r\n      sudden inrush of new ideas, their tempering, their distillation,\r\n      the reaction against them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He paused only to get his breath.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is why I have sworn not to put pen to paper until my\r\n      ideas either clarify or depart entirely; I have quite enough sins\r\n      on my soul without putting dangerous, shallow epigrams into\r\n      people\xe2\x80\x99s heads; I might cause a poor, inoffensive capitalist to\r\n      have a vulgar liaison with a bomb, or get some innocent little\r\n      Bolshevik tangled up with a machine-gun bullet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom was growing restless under this lampooning of his connection\r\n      with The New Democracy.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this got to do with your being bored?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory considered that it had much to do with it.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99ll I fit in?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I for? To propagate the\r\n      race? According to the American novels we are led to believe that\r\n      the \xe2\x80\x98healthy American boy\xe2\x80\x99 from nineteen to twenty-five is an\r\n      entirely sexless animal. As a matter of fact, the healthier he is\r\n      the less that\xe2\x80\x99s true. The only alternative to letting it get you\r\n      is some violent interest. Well, the war is over; I believe too\r\n      much in the responsibilities of authorship to write just now; and\r\n      business, well, business speaks for itself. It has no connection\r\n      with anything in the world that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been interested in,\r\n      except a slim, utilitarian connection with economics. What I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n      see of it, lost in a clerkship, for the next and best ten years\r\n      of my life would have the intellectual content of an industrial\r\n      movie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTry fiction,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Tom.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTrouble is I get distracted when I start to write stories\xe2\x80\x94get\r\n      afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it instead of living\xe2\x80\x94get thinking maybe life is\r\n      waiting for me in the Japanese gardens at the Ritz or at Atlantic\r\n      City or on the lower East Side.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnyway,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the vital urge. I wanted to be\r\n      a regular human being but the girl couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see it that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGod! Banish the thought. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that \xe2\x80\x98if the girl\r\n      had been worth having she\xe2\x80\x99d have waited for you\xe2\x80\x99? No, sir, the\r\n      girl really worth having won\xe2\x80\x99t wait for anybody. If I thought\r\n      there\xe2\x80\x99d be another I\xe2\x80\x99d lose my remaining faith in human nature.\r\n      Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll play\xe2\x80\x94but Rosalind was the only girl in the wide world\r\n      that could have held me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d yawned Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve played confidant a good hour by the\r\n      clock. Still, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to have violent\r\n      views again on something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Amory reluctantly. \xe2\x80\x9cYet when I see a happy family\r\n      it makes me sick at my stomach\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHappy families try to make people feel that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom\r\n      cynically.\r\n\r\n\r\n      TOM THE CENSOR\r\n\r\n      There were days when Amory listened. These were when Tom,\r\n      wreathed in smoke, indulged in the slaughter of American\r\n      literature. Words failed him.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFifty thousand dollars a year,\xe2\x80\x9d he would cry. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! Look at\r\n      them, look at them\xe2\x80\x94Edna Ferber, Gouverneur Morris, Fanny Hurst,\r\n      Mary Roberts Rinehart\xe2\x80\x94not producing among \xe2\x80\x99em one story or novel\r\n      that will last ten years. This man Cobb\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t tink he\xe2\x80\x99s either\r\n      clever or amusing\xe2\x80\x94and what\xe2\x80\x99s more, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think very many people\r\n      do, except the editors. He\xe2\x80\x99s just groggy with advertising. And\xe2\x80\x94oh\r\n      Harold Bell Wright oh Zane Grey\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThey try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, they don\xe2\x80\x99t even try. Some of them _can_ write, but they\r\n      won\xe2\x80\x99t sit down and do one honest novel. Most of them _can\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\n      write, I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit. I believe Rupert Hughes tries to give a real,\r\n      comprehensive picture of American life, but his style and\r\n      perspective are barbarous. Ernest Poole and Dorothy Canfield try\r\n      but they\xe2\x80\x99re hindered by their absolute lack of any sense of\r\n      humor; but at least they crowd their work instead of spreading it\r\n      thin. Every author ought to write every book as if he were going\r\n      to be beheaded the day he finished it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIs that double entente?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t slow me up! Now there\xe2\x80\x99s a few of \xe2\x80\x99em that seem to have\r\n      some cultural background, some intelligence and a good deal of\r\n      literary felicity but they just simply won\xe2\x80\x99t write honestly;\r\n      they\xe2\x80\x99d all claim there was no public for good stuff. Then why the\r\n      devil is it that Wells, Conrad, Galsworthy, Shaw, Bennett, and\r\n      the rest depend on America for over half their sales?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow does little Tommy like the poets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom was overcome. He dropped his arms until they swung loosely\r\n      beside the chair and emitted faint grunts.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m writing a satire on \xe2\x80\x99em now, calling it \xe2\x80\x98Boston Bards and\r\n      Hearst Reviewers.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory eagerly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only got the last few lines done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very modern. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear \xe2\x80\x99em, if they\xe2\x80\x99re funny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Tom produced a folded paper from his pocket and read aloud,\r\n      pausing at intervals so that Amory could see that it was free\r\n      verse:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cSo Walter Arensberg, Alfred Kreymborg, Carl Sandburg, Louis\r\n   Untermeyer, Eunice Tietjens, Clara Shanafelt, James Oppenheim,\r\n   Maxwell Bodenheim, Richard Glaenzer, Scharmel Iris, Conrad Aiken, I\r\n   place your names here So that you may live If only as names,\r\n   Sinuous, mauve-colored names, In the Juvenalia Of my collected\r\n   editions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory roared.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou win the iron pansy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy you a meal on the arrogance of\r\n      the last two lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory did not entirely agree with Tom\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping damnation of\r\n      American novelists and poets. He enjoyed both Vachel Lindsay and\r\n      Booth Tarkington, and admired the conscientious, if slender,\r\n      artistry of Edgar Lee Masters.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I hate is this idiotic drivel about \xe2\x80\x98I am God\xe2\x80\x94I am man\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      ride the winds\xe2\x80\x94I look through the smoke\xe2\x80\x94I am the life sense.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ghastly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wish American novelists would give up trying to make\r\n      business romantically interesting. Nobody wants to read about it,\r\n      unless it\xe2\x80\x99s crooked business. If it was an entertaining subject\r\n      they\xe2\x80\x99d buy the life of James J. Hill and not one of these long\r\n      office tragedies that harp along on the significance of smoke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd gloom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another favorite, though I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n      admit the Russians have the monopoly. Our specialty is stories\r\n      about little girls who break their spines and get adopted by\r\n      grouchy old men because they smile so much. You\xe2\x80\x99d think we were a\r\n      race of cheerful cripples and that the common end of the Russian\r\n      peasant was suicide\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSix o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory, glancing at his wrist-watch. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll buy\r\n      you a grea\xe2\x80\x99 big dinner on the strength of the Juvenalia of your\r\n      collected editions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      LOOKING BACKWARD\r\n\r\n      July sweltered out with a last hot week, and Amory in another\r\n      surge of unrest realized that it was just five months since he\r\n      and Rosalind had met. Yet it was already hard for him to\r\n      visualize the heart-whole boy who had stepped off the transport,\r\n      passionately desiring the adventure of life. One night while the\r\n      heat, overpowering and enervating, poured into the windows of his\r\n      room he struggled for several hours in a vague effort to\r\n      immortalize the poignancy of that time.\r\n\r\n  The February streets, wind-washed by night, blow full of strange\r\n  half-intermittent damps, bearing on wasted walks in shining sight wet\r\n  snow plashed into gleams under the lamps, like golden oil from some\r\n  divine machine, in an hour of thaw and stars.\r\n  Strange damps\xe2\x80\x94full of the eyes of many men, crowded with life borne\r\n  in upon a lull....  Oh, I was young, for I could turn again to you,\r\n  most finite and most beautiful, and taste the stuff of\r\n  half-remembered dreams, sweet and new on your mouth.\r\n ... There was a tanging in the midnight air\xe2\x80\x94silence was dead and sound\r\n not yet awoken\xe2\x80\x94Life cracked like ice!\xe2\x80\x94one brilliant note and there,\r\n radiant and pale, you stood... and spring had broken. (The icicles\r\n were short upon the roofs and the changeling city swooned.)\r\n  Our thoughts were frosty mist along the eaves; our two ghosts kissed,\r\n  high on the long, mazed wires\xe2\x80\x94eerie half-laughter echoes here and\r\n  leaves only a fatuous sigh for young desires; regret has followed\r\n  after things she loved, leaving the great husk.\r\n\r\n\r\n      ANOTHER ENDING\r\n\r\n      In mid-August came a letter from Monsignor Darcy, who had\r\n      evidently just stumbled on his address:\r\n\r\n      MY DEAR BOY:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      Your last letter was quite enough to make me worry about you. It\r\n      was not a bit like yourself. Reading between the lines I should\r\n      imagine that your engagement to this girl is making you rather\r\n      unhappy, and I see you have lost all the feeling of romance that\r\n      you had before the war. You make a great mistake if you think you\r\n      can be romantic without religion. Sometimes I think that with\r\n      both of us the secret of success, when we find it, is the\r\n      mystical element in us: something flows into us that enlarges our\r\n      personalities, and when it ebbs out our personalities shrink; I\r\n      should call your last two letters rather shrivelled. Beware of\r\n      losing yourself in the personality of another being, man or\r\n      woman.\r\n\r\n      His Eminence Cardinal O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and the Bishop of Boston are\r\n      staying with me at present, so it is hard for me to get a moment\r\n      to write, but I wish you would come up here later if only for a\r\n      week-end. I go to Washington this week.\r\n\r\n      What I shall do in the future is hanging in the balance.\r\n      Absolutely between ourselves I should not be surprised to see the\r\n      red hat of a cardinal descend upon my unworthy head within the\r\n      next eight months. In any event, I should like to have a house in\r\n      New York or Washington where you could drop in for week-ends.\r\n\r\n      Amory, I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad we\xe2\x80\x99re both alive; this war could easily have\r\n      been the end of a brilliant family. But in regard to matrimony,\r\n      you are now at the most dangerous period of your life. You might\r\n      marry in haste and repent at leisure, but I think you won\xe2\x80\x99t. From\r\n      what you write me about the present calamitous state of your\r\n      finances, what you want is naturally impossible. However, if I\r\n      judge you by the means I usually choose, I should say that there\r\n      will be something of an emotional crisis within the next year.\r\n\r\n      Do write me. I feel annoyingly out of date on you.\r\n\r\n          With greatest affection,\r\n                              THAYER DARCY.\r\n\r\n      Within a week after the receipt of this letter their little\r\n      household fell precipitously to pieces. The immediate cause was\r\n      the serious and probably chronic illness of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mother. So they\r\n      stored the furniture, gave instructions to sublet and shook hands\r\n      gloomily in the Pennsylvania Station. Amory and Tom seemed always\r\n      to be saying good-by.\r\n\r\n      Feeling very much alone, Amory yielded to an impulse and set off\r\n      southward, intending to join Monsignor in Washington. They missed\r\n      connections by two hours, and, deciding to spend a few days with\r\n      an ancient, remembered uncle, Amory journeyed up through the\r\n      luxuriant fields of Maryland into Ramilly County. But instead of\r\n      two days his stay lasted from mid-August nearly through\r\n      September, for in Maryland he met Eleanor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER 3. Young Irony\r\n\r\n\r\n      For years afterward when Amory thought of Eleanor he seemed still\r\n      to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills\r\n      into the places beside his heart. The night when they rode up the\r\n      slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds, he lost\r\n      a further part of him that nothing could restore; and when he\r\n      lost it he lost also the power of regretting it. Eleanor was,\r\n      say, the last time that evil crept close to Amory under the mask\r\n      of beauty, the last weird mystery that held him with wild\r\n      fascination and pounded his soul to flakes.\r\n\r\n      With her his imagination ran riot and that is why they rode to\r\n      the highest hill and watched an evil moon ride high, for they\r\n      knew then that they could see the devil in each other. But\r\n      Eleanor\xe2\x80\x94did Amory dream her? Afterward their ghosts played, yet\r\n      both of them hoped from their souls never to meet. Was it the\r\n      infinite sadness of her eyes that drew him or the mirror of\r\n      himself that he found in the gorgeous clarity of her mind? She\r\n      will have no other adventure like Amory, and if she reads this\r\n      she will say:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Amory will have no other adventure like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Nor will she sigh, any more than he would sigh.\r\n\r\n      Eleanor tried to put it on paper once:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cThe fading things we only know We\xe2\x80\x99ll have forgotten... Put away...\r\n   Desires that melted with the snow, And dreams begotten This to-day:\r\n   The sudden dawns we laughed to greet, That all could see, that none\r\n   could share, Will be but dawns... and if we meet We shall not care.\r\n    Dear... not one tear will rise for this... A little while hence No\r\n    regret Will stir for a remembered kiss\xe2\x80\x94 Not even silence, When\r\n    we\xe2\x80\x99ve met, Will give old ghosts a waste to roam, Or stir the\r\n    surface of the sea... If gray shapes drift beneath the foam We\r\n    shall not see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They quarrelled dangerously because Amory maintained that _sea_\r\n      and _see_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be used as a rhyme. And then Eleanor\r\n      had part of another verse that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a beginning for:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9c... But wisdom passes... still the years Will feed us wisdom.... \r\n   Age will go Back to the old\xe2\x80\x94 For all our tears We shall not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Eleanor hated Maryland passionately. She belonged to the oldest\r\n      of the old families of Ramilly County and lived in a big, gloomy\r\n      house with her grandfather. She had been born and brought up in\r\n      France.... I see I am starting wrong. Let me begin again.\r\n\r\n      Amory was bored, as he usually was in the country. He used to go\r\n      for far walks by himself\xe2\x80\x94and wander along reciting \xe2\x80\x9cUlalume\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\n      the corn-fields, and congratulating Poe for drinking himself to\r\n      death in that atmosphere of smiling complacency. One afternoon he\r\n      had strolled for several miles along a road that was new to him,\r\n      and then through a wood on bad advice from a colored woman...\r\n      losing himself entirely. A passing storm decided to break out,\r\n      and to his great impatience the sky grew black as pitch and the\r\n      rain began to splatter down through the trees, become suddenly\r\n      furtive and ghostly. Thunder rolled with menacing crashes up the\r\n      valley and scattered through the woods in intermittent batteries.\r\n      He stumbled blindly on, hunting for a way out, and finally,\r\n      through webs of twisted branches, caught sight of a rift in the\r\n      trees where the unbroken lightning showed open country. He rushed\r\n      to the edge of the woods and then hesitated whether or not to\r\n      cross the fields and try to reach the shelter of the little house\r\n      marked by a light far down the valley. It was only half past\r\n      five, but he could see scarcely ten steps before him, except when\r\n      the lightning made everything vivid and grotesque for great\r\n      sweeps around.\r\n\r\n      Suddenly a strange sound fell on his ears. It was a song, in a\r\n      low, husky voice, a girl\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and whoever was singing was\r\n      very close to him. A year before he might have laughed, or\r\n      trembled; but in his restless mood he only stood and listened\r\n      while the words sank into his consciousness:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cLes sanglots longs Des violons De l\xe2\x80\x99automne Blessent mon coeur\r\n   D\xe2\x80\x99une langueur Monotone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The lightning split the sky, but the song went on without a\r\n      quaver. The girl was evidently in the field and the voice seemed\r\n      to come vaguely from a haystack about twenty feet in front of\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n      Then it ceased: ceased and began again in a weird chant that\r\n      soared and hung and fell and blended with the rain:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cTout suffocant Et bleme quand Sonne l\xe2\x80\x99heure Je me souviens Des\r\n   jours anciens Et je pleure....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil is there in Ramilly County,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Amory aloud,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cwho would deliver Verlaine in an extemporaneous tune to a\r\n      soaking haystack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody\xe2\x80\x99s there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the voice unalarmed. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are\r\n      you?\xe2\x80\x94Manfred, St. Christopher, or Queen Victoria?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Don Juan!\xe2\x80\x9d Amory shouted on impulse, raising his voice above\r\n      the noise of the rain and the wind.\r\n\r\n      A delighted shriek came from the haystack.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI know who you are\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re the blond boy that likes \xe2\x80\x98Ulalume\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      recognize your voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I get up?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried from the foot of the haystack,\r\n      whither he had arrived, dripping wet. A head appeared over the\r\n      edge\xe2\x80\x94it was so dark that Amory could just make out a patch of\r\n      damp hair and two eyes that gleamed like a cat\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRun back!\xe2\x80\x9d came the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cand jump and I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch your\r\n      hand\xe2\x80\x94no, not there\xe2\x80\x94on the other side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He followed directions and as he sprawled up the side, knee-deep\r\n      in hay, a small, white hand reached out, gripped his, and helped\r\n      him onto the top.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHere you are, Juan,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she of the damp hair. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind if\r\n      I drop the Don?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a thumb like mine!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re holding my hand, which is dangerous without seeing my\r\n      face.\xe2\x80\x9d He dropped it quickly.\r\n\r\n      As if in answer to his prayers came a flash of lightning and he\r\n      looked eagerly at her who stood beside him on the soggy haystack,\r\n      ten feet above the ground. But she had covered her face and he\r\n      saw nothing but a slender figure, dark, damp, bobbed hair, and\r\n      the small white hands with the thumbs that bent back like his.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested politely, as the dark closed in on\r\n      them. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll sit opposite me in this hollow you can have half\r\n      of the raincoat, which I was using as a water-proof tent until\r\n      you so rudely interrupted me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI was asked,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory said joyfully; \xe2\x80\x9cyou asked me\xe2\x80\x94you know you\r\n      did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon Juan always manages that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      call you that any more, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got reddish hair. Instead\r\n      you can recite \xe2\x80\x98Ulalume\xe2\x80\x99 and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be Psyche, your soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory flushed, happily invisible under the curtain of wind and\r\n      rain. They were sitting opposite each other in a slight hollow in\r\n      the hay with the raincoat spread over most of them, and the rain\r\n      doing for the rest. Amory was trying desperately to see Psyche,\r\n      but the lightning refused to flash again, and he waited\r\n      impatiently. Good Lord! supposing she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t beautiful\xe2\x80\x94supposing\r\n      she was forty and pedantic\xe2\x80\x94heavens! Suppose, only suppose, she\r\n      was mad. But he knew the last was unworthy. Here had Providence\r\n      sent a girl to amuse him just as it sent Benvenuto Cellini men to\r\n      murder, and he was wondering if she was mad, just because she\r\n      exactly filled his mood.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot mad. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you were mad when I first saw you, so it\r\n      isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair that you should think so of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow on earth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      As long as they knew each other Eleanor and Amory could be \xe2\x80\x9con a\r\n      subject\xe2\x80\x9d and stop talking with the definite thought of it in\r\n      their heads, yet ten minutes later speak aloud and find that\r\n      their minds had followed the same channels and led them each to a\r\n      parallel idea, an idea that others would have found absolutely\r\n      unconnected with the first.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, leaning forward eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you know\r\n      about \xe2\x80\x98Ulalume\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94how did you know the color of my hair? What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      your name? What were you doing here? Tell me all at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Suddenly the lightning flashed in with a leap of overreaching\r\n      light and he saw Eleanor, and looked for the first time into\r\n      those eyes of hers. Oh, she was magnificent\xe2\x80\x94pale skin, the color\r\n      of marble in starlight, slender brows, and eyes that glittered\r\n      green as emeralds in the blinding glare. She was a witch, of\r\n      perhaps nineteen, he judged, alert and dreamy and with the\r\n      tell-tale white line over her upper lip that was a weakness and a\r\n      delight. He sank back with a gasp against the wall of hay.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\n      about to say that my green eyes are burning into your brain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat color is your hair?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked intently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s bobbed, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s bobbed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what color it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered,\r\n      musing, \xe2\x80\x9cso many men have asked me. It\xe2\x80\x99s medium, I suppose\xe2\x80\x94No one\r\n      ever looks long at my hair. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got beautiful eyes, though,\r\n      haven\xe2\x80\x99t I. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you say, I have beautiful eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer my question, Madeline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t remember them all\xe2\x80\x94besides my name isn\xe2\x80\x99t Madeline, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      Eleanor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI might have guessed it. You _look_ like Eleanor\xe2\x80\x94you have that\r\n      Eleanor look. You know what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      There was a silence as they listened to the rain.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going down my neck, fellow lunatic,\xe2\x80\x9d she offered finally.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer my questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94name of Savage, Eleanor; live in big old house mile down\r\n      road; nearest living relation to be notified, grandfather\xe2\x80\x94Ramilly\r\n      Savage; height, five feet four inches; number on watch-case, 3077\r\n      W; nose, delicate aquiline; temperament, uncanny\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd me,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere did you see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re one of _those_ men,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cmust\r\n      lug old self into conversation. Well, my boy, I was behind a\r\n      hedge sunning myself one day last week, and along comes a man\r\n      saying in a pleasant, conceited way of talking:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And now when the night was senescent\xe2\x80\x99 (says he) \xe2\x80\x98And the star\r\n    dials pointed to morn At the end of the path a liquescent\xe2\x80\x99 (says\r\n    he) \xe2\x80\x98And nebulous lustre was born.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSo I poked my eyes up over the hedge, but you had started to\r\n      run, for some unknown reason, and so I saw but the back of your\r\n      beautiful head. \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s a man for whom many of us\r\n      might sigh,\xe2\x80\x99 and I continued in my best Irish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cNow go back to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will. I\xe2\x80\x99m one of those people who go through the world\r\n      giving other people thrills, but getting few myself except those\r\n      I read into men on such nights as these. I have the social\r\n      courage to go on the stage, but not the energy; I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\n      patience to write books; and I never met a man I\xe2\x80\x99d marry.\r\n      However, I\xe2\x80\x99m only eighteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The storm was dying down softly and only the wind kept up its\r\n      ghostly surge and made the stack lean and gravely settle from\r\n      side to side. Amory was in a trance. He felt that every moment\r\n      was precious. He had never met a girl like this before\xe2\x80\x94she would\r\n      never seem quite the same again. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t at all feel like a\r\n      character in a play, the appropriate feeling in an unconventional\r\n      situation\xe2\x80\x94instead, he had a sense of coming home.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI have just made a great decision,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eleanor after another\r\n      pause, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is why I\xe2\x80\x99m here, to answer another of your\r\n      questions. I have just decided that I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in\r\n      immortality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cReally! how banal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFrightfully so,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut depressing with a stale,\r\n      sickly depression, nevertheless. I came out here to get wet\xe2\x80\x94like\r\n      a wet hen; wet hens always have great clarity of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\n      concluded.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory said politely.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of the dark, so I put on my slicker and\r\n      rubber boots and came out. You see I was always afraid, before,\r\n      to say I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in God\xe2\x80\x94because the lightning might strike\r\n      me\xe2\x80\x94but here I am and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, of course, but the main point is\r\n      that this time I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any more afraid of it than I had been\r\n      when I was a Christian Scientist, like I was last year. So now I\r\n      know I\xe2\x80\x99m a materialist and I was fraternizing with the hay when\r\n      you came out and stood by the woods, scared to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you little wretch\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d cried Amory indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cScared of\r\n      what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c_Yourself!_\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted, and he jumped. She clapped her hands\r\n      and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cSee\xe2\x80\x94see! Conscience\xe2\x80\x94kill it like me! Eleanor\r\n      Savage, materiologist\xe2\x80\x94no jumping, no starting, come early\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut I _have_ to have a soul,\xe2\x80\x9d he objected. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\n      rational\xe2\x80\x94and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be molecular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She leaned toward him, her burning eyes never leaving his own and\r\n      whispered with a sort of romantic finality:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI thought so, Juan, I feared so\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re sentimental. You\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\n      like me. I\xe2\x80\x99m a romantic little materialist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sentimental\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m as romantic as you are. The idea, you\r\n      know, is that the sentimental person thinks things will last\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      romantic person has a desperate confidence that they won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      (This was an ancient distinction of Amory\xe2\x80\x99s.)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEpigrams. I\xe2\x80\x99m going home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get off the\r\n      haystack and walk to the cross-roads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They slowly descended from their perch. She would not let him\r\n      help her down and motioning him away arrived in a graceful lump\r\n      in the soft mud where she sat for an instant, laughing at\r\n      herself. Then she jumped to her feet and slipped her hand into\r\n      his, and they tiptoed across the fields, jumping and swinging\r\n      from dry spot to dry spot. A transcendent delight seemed to\r\n      sparkle in every pool of water, for the moon had risen and the\r\n      storm had scurried away into western Maryland. When Eleanor\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\n      touched his he felt his hands grow cold with deadly fear lest he\r\n      should lose the shadow brush with which his imagination was\r\n      painting wonders of her. He watched her from the corners of his\r\n      eyes as ever he did when he walked with her\xe2\x80\x94she was a feast and a\r\n      folly and he wished it had been his destiny to sit forever on a\r\n      haystack and see life through her green eyes. His paganism soared\r\n      that night and when she faded out like a gray ghost down the\r\n      road, a deep singing came out of the fields and filled his way\r\n      homeward. All night the summer moths flitted in and out of\r\n      Amory\xe2\x80\x99s window; all night large looming sounds swayed in mystic\r\n      revery through the silver grain\xe2\x80\x94and he lay awake in the clear\r\n      darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n      SEPTEMBER\r\n\r\n      Amory selected a blade of grass and nibbled at it scientifically.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI never fall in love in August or September,\xe2\x80\x9d he proffered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhen then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cChristmas or Easter. I\xe2\x80\x99m a liturgist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEaster!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned up her nose. \xe2\x80\x9cHuh! Spring in corsets!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEaster _would_ bore spring, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she? Easter has her hair\r\n      braided, wears a tailored suit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cBind on thy sandals, oh, thou most fleet. Over the splendor and\r\n  speed of thy feet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      quoted Eleanor softly, and then added: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose Hallowe\xe2\x80\x99en is a\r\n      better day for autumn than Thanksgiving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMuch better\xe2\x80\x94and Christmas eve does very well for winter, but\r\n      summer...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSummer has no day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have a summer\r\n      love. So many people have tried that the name\xe2\x80\x99s become\r\n      proverbial. Summer is only the unfulfilled promise of spring, a\r\n      charlatan in place of the warm balmy nights I dream of in April.\r\n      It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad season of life without growth.... It has no day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFourth of July,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory suggested facetiously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be funny!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, raking him with her eyes.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what could fulfil the promise of spring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She thought a moment.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I suppose heaven would, if there was one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said finally,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9ca sort of pagan heaven\xe2\x80\x94you ought to be a materialist,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\n      continued irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you look a good deal like the pictures of Rupert\r\n      Brooke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      To some extent Amory tried to play Rupert Brooke as long as he\r\n      knew Eleanor. What he said, his attitude toward life, toward her,\r\n      toward himself, were all reflexes of the dead Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      literary moods. Often she sat in the grass, a lazy wind playing\r\n      with her short hair, her voice husky as she ran up and down the\r\n      scale from Grantchester to Waikiki. There was something most\r\n      passionate in Eleanor\xe2\x80\x99s reading aloud. They seemed nearer, not\r\n      only mentally, but physically, when they read, than when she was\r\n      in his arms, and this was often, for they fell half into love\r\n      almost from the first. Yet was Amory capable of love now? He\r\n      could, as always, run through the emotions in a half hour, but\r\n      even while they revelled in their imaginations, he knew that\r\n      neither of them could care as he had cared once before\xe2\x80\x94I suppose\r\n      that was why they turned to Brooke, and Swinburne, and Shelley.\r\n      Their chance was to make everything fine and finished and rich\r\n      and imaginative; they must bend tiny golden tentacles from his\r\n      imagination to hers, that would take the place of the great, deep\r\n      love that was never so near, yet never so much of a dream.\r\n\r\n      One poem they read over and over; Swinburne\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cTriumph of Time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      and four lines of it rang in his memory afterward on warm nights\r\n      when he saw the fireflies among dusky tree trunks and heard the\r\n      low drone of many frogs. Then Eleanor seemed to come out of the\r\n      night and stand by him, and he heard her throaty voice, with its\r\n      tone of a fleecy-headed drum, repeating:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cIs it worth a tear, is it worth an hour, To think of things that\r\n   are well outworn; Of fruitless husk and fugitive flower, The dream\r\n   foregone and the deed foreborne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They were formally introduced two days later, and his aunt told\r\n      him her history. The Ramillys were two: old Mr. Ramilly and his\r\n      granddaughter, Eleanor. She had lived in France with a restless\r\n      mother whom Amory imagined to have been very like his own, on\r\n      whose death she had come to America, to live in Maryland. She had\r\n      gone to Baltimore first to stay with a bachelor uncle, and there\r\n      she insisted on being a debutante at the age of seventeen. She\r\n      had a wild winter and arrived in the country in March, having\r\n      quarrelled frantically with all her Baltimore relatives, and\r\n      shocked them into fiery protest. A rather fast crowd had come\r\n      out, who drank cocktails in limousines and were promiscuously\r\n      condescending and patronizing toward older people, and Eleanor\r\n      with an esprit that hinted strongly of the boulevards, led many\r\n      innocents still redolent of St. Timothy\xe2\x80\x99s and Farmington, into\r\n      paths of Bohemian naughtiness. When the story came to her uncle,\r\n      a forgetful cavalier of a more hypocritical era, there was a\r\n      scene, from which Eleanor emerged, subdued but rebellious and\r\n      indignant, to seek haven with her grandfather who hovered in the\r\n      country on the near side of senility. That\xe2\x80\x99s as far as her story\r\n      went; she told him the rest herself, but that was later.\r\n\r\n      Often they swam and as Amory floated lazily in the water he shut\r\n      his mind to all thoughts except those of hazy soap-bubble lands\r\n      where the sun splattered through wind-drunk trees. How could any\r\n      one possibly think or worry, or do anything except splash and\r\n      dive and loll there on the edge of time while the flower months\r\n      failed. Let the days move over\xe2\x80\x94sadness and memory and pain\r\n      recurred outside, and here, once more, before he went on to meet\r\n      them he wanted to drift and be young.\r\n\r\n      There were days when Amory resented that life had changed from an\r\n      even progress along a road stretching ever in sight, with the\r\n      scenery merging and blending, into a succession of quick,\r\n      unrelated scenes\xe2\x80\x94two years of sweat and blood, that sudden absurd\r\n      instinct for paternity that Rosalind had stirred; the\r\n      half-sensual, half-neurotic quality of this autumn with Eleanor.\r\n      He felt that it would take all time, more than he could ever\r\n      spare, to glue these strange cumbersome pictures into the\r\n      scrap-book of his life. It was all like a banquet where he sat\r\n      for this half-hour of his youth and tried to enjoy brilliant\r\n      epicurean courses.\r\n\r\n      Dimly he promised himself a time where all should be welded\r\n      together. For months it seemed that he had alternated between\r\n      being borne along a stream of love or fascination, or left in an\r\n      eddy, and in the eddies he had not desired to think, rather to be\r\n      picked up on a wave\xe2\x80\x99s top and swept along again.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe despairing, dying autumn and our love\xe2\x80\x94how well they\r\n      harmonize!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eleanor sadly one day as they lay dripping by\r\n      the water.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe Indian summer of our hearts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he ceased.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said finally, \xe2\x80\x9cwas she light or dark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWas she more beautiful than I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory shortly.\r\n\r\n      One night they walked while the moon rose and poured a great\r\n      burden of glory over the garden until it seemed fairyland with\r\n      Amory and Eleanor, dim phantasmal shapes, expressing eternal\r\n      beauty in curious elfin love moods. Then they turned out of the\r\n      moonlight into the trellised darkness of a vine-hung pagoda,\r\n      where there were scents so plaintive as to be nearly musical.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLight a match,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Scratch! Flare!\r\n\r\n      The night and the scarred trees were like scenery in a play, and\r\n      to be there with Eleanor, shadowy and unreal, seemed somehow\r\n      oddly familiar. Amory thought how it was only the past that ever\r\n      seemed strange and unbelievable. The match went out.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s black as pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just voices now,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Eleanor, \xe2\x80\x9clittle lonesome\r\n      voices. Light another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat was my last match.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Suddenly he caught her in his arms.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ mine\xe2\x80\x94you know you\xe2\x80\x99re mine!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried wildly... the\r\n      moonlight twisted in through the vines and listened... the\r\n      fireflies hung upon their whispers as if to win his glance from\r\n      the glory of their eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE END OF SUMMER\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo wind is stirring in the grass; not one wind stirs... the\r\n      water in the hidden pools, as glass, fronts the full moon and so\r\n      inters the golden token in its icy mass,\xe2\x80\x9d chanted Eleanor to the\r\n      trees that skeletoned the body of the night. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it ghostly\r\n      here? If you can hold your horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet up, let\xe2\x80\x99s cut through the\r\n      woods and find the hidden pools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s after one, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d he objected, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\n      don\xe2\x80\x99t know enough about horses to put one away in the pitch\r\n      dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you old fool,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered irrelevantly, and, leaning\r\n      over, she patted him lazily with her riding-crop. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can leave\r\n      your old plug in our stable and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send him over to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut my uncle has got to drive me to the station with this old\r\n      plug at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a spoil-sport\xe2\x80\x94remember, you have a tendency toward\r\n      wavering that prevents you from being the entire light of my\r\n      life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory drew his horse up close beside, and, leaning toward her,\r\n      grasped her hand.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSay I am\xe2\x80\x94_quick_, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll pull you over and make you ride behind\r\n      me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She looked up and smiled and shook her head excitedly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, do!\xe2\x80\x94or rather, don\xe2\x80\x99t! Why are all the exciting things so\r\n      uncomfortable, like fighting and exploring and ski-ing in Canada?\r\n      By the way, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to ride up Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Hill. I think that\r\n      comes in our programme about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou little devil,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory growled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to make me stay\r\n      up all night and sleep in the train like an immigrant all day\r\n      to-morrow, going back to New York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHush! some one\xe2\x80\x99s coming along the road\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s go! Whoo-ee-oop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      And with a shout that probably gave the belated traveller a\r\n      series of shivers, she turned her horse into the woods and Amory\r\n      followed slowly, as he had followed her all day for three weeks.\r\n\r\n      The summer was over, but he had spent the days in watching\r\n      Eleanor, a graceful, facile Manfred, build herself intellectual\r\n      and imaginative pyramids while she revelled in the\r\n      artificialities of the temperamental teens and they wrote poetry\r\n      at the dinner-table.\r\n\r\n  When Vanity kissed Vanity, a hundred happy Junes ago, he pondered\r\n  o\xe2\x80\x99er her breathlessly, and, that all men might ever know, he rhymed\r\n  her eyes with life and death:\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThru Time I\xe2\x80\x99ll save my love!\xe2\x80\x9d he said... yet Beauty vanished with\r\n  his breath, and, with her lovers, she was dead...\r\n  \xe2\x80\x94Ever his wit and not her eyes, ever his art and not her hair:\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99d learn a trick in rhyme, be wise and pause before his sonnet\r\n  there\xe2\x80\x9d...  So all my words, however true, might sing you to a\r\n  thousandth June, and no one ever _know_ that you were Beauty for an\r\n  afternoon.\r\n\r\n      So he wrote one day, when he pondered how coldly we thought of\r\n      the \xe2\x80\x9cDark Lady of the Sonnets,\xe2\x80\x9d and how little we remembered her\r\n      as the great man wanted her remembered. For what Shakespeare\r\n      _must_ have desired, to have been able to write with such divine\r\n      despair, was that the lady should live... and now we have no real\r\n      interest in her.... The irony of it is that if he had cared\r\n      _more_ for the poem than for the lady the sonnet would be only\r\n      obvious, imitative rhetoric and no one would ever have read it\r\n      after twenty years....\r\n\r\n      This was the last night Amory ever saw Eleanor. He was leaving in\r\n      the morning and they had agreed to take a long farewell trot by\r\n      the cold moonlight. She wanted to talk, she said\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the last\r\n      time in her life that she could be rational (she meant pose with\r\n      comfort). So they had turned into the woods and rode for half an\r\n      hour with scarcely a word, except when she whispered \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d at a\r\n      bothersome branch\xe2\x80\x94whispered it as no other girl was ever able to\r\n      whisper it. Then they started up Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Hill, walking their\r\n      tired horses.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! It\xe2\x80\x99s quiet here!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Eleanor; \xe2\x80\x9cmuch more\r\n      lonesome than the woods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI hate woods,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory said, shuddering. \xe2\x80\x9cAny kind of foliage or\r\n      underbrush at night. Out here it\xe2\x80\x99s so broad and easy on the\r\n      spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe long slope of a long hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the cold moon rolling moonlight down it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd thee and me, last and most important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It was quiet that night\xe2\x80\x94the straight road they followed up to the\r\n      edge of the cliff knew few footsteps at any time. Only an\r\n      occasional negro cabin, silver-gray in the rock-ribbed moonlight,\r\n      broke the long line of bare ground; behind lay the black edge of\r\n      the woods like a dark frosting on white cake, and ahead the\r\n      sharp, high horizon. It was much colder\xe2\x80\x94so cold that it settled\r\n      on them and drove all the warm nights from their minds.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe end of summer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eleanor softly. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to the beat of\r\n      our horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98tump-tump-tump-a-tump.\xe2\x80\x99 Have you ever been\r\n      feverish and had all noises divide into \xe2\x80\x98tump-tump-tump\xe2\x80\x99 until\r\n      you could swear eternity was divisible into so many tumps? That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      the way I feel\xe2\x80\x94old horses go tump-tump.... I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\n      only thing that separates horses and clocks from us. Human beings\r\n      can\xe2\x80\x99t go \xe2\x80\x98tump-tump-tump\xe2\x80\x99 without going crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The breeze freshened and Eleanor pulled her cape around her and\r\n      shivered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAre you very cold?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about myself\xe2\x80\x94my black old inside self, the real\r\n      one, with the fundamental honesty that keeps me from being\r\n      absolutely wicked by making me realize my own sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They were riding up close by the cliff and Amory gazed over.\r\n      Where the fall met the ground a hundred feet below, a black\r\n      stream made a sharp line, broken by tiny glints in the swift\r\n      water.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRotten, rotten old world,\xe2\x80\x9d broke out Eleanor suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\n      wretchedest thing of all is me\xe2\x80\x94oh, _why_ am I a girl? Why am I\r\n      not a stupid\xe2\x80\x94? Look at you; you\xe2\x80\x99re stupider than I am, not much,\r\n      but some, and you can lope about and get bored and then lope\r\n      somewhere else, and you can play around with girls without being\r\n      involved in meshes of sentiment, and you can do anything and be\r\n      justified\xe2\x80\x94and here am I with the brains to do everything, yet\r\n      tied to the sinking ship of future matrimony. If I were born a\r\n      hundred years from now, well and good, but now what\xe2\x80\x99s in store\r\n      for me\xe2\x80\x94I have to marry, that goes without saying. Who? I\xe2\x80\x99m too\r\n      bright for most men, and yet I have to descend to their level and\r\n      let them patronize my intellect in order to get their attention.\r\n      Every year that I don\xe2\x80\x99t marry I\xe2\x80\x99ve got less chance for a\r\n      first-class man. At the best I can have my choice from one or two\r\n      cities and, of course, I have to marry into a dinner-coat.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d she leaned close again, \xe2\x80\x9cI like clever men and\r\n      good-looking men, and, of course, no one cares more for\r\n      personality than I do. Oh, just one person in fifty has any\r\n      glimmer of what sex is. I\xe2\x80\x99m hipped on Freud and all that, but\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x99s rotten that every bit of _real_ love in the world is\r\n      ninety-nine per cent passion and one little soupcon of jealousy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      She finished as suddenly as she began.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a rather\r\n      unpleasant overpowering force that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the machinery under\r\n      everything. It\xe2\x80\x99s like an actor that lets you see his mechanics!\r\n      Wait a minute till I think this out....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He paused and tried to get a metaphor. They had turned the cliff\r\n      and were riding along the road about fifty feet to the left.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou see every one\xe2\x80\x99s got to have some cloak to throw around it.\r\n      The mediocre intellects, Plato\xe2\x80\x99s second class, use the remnants\r\n      of romantic chivalry diluted with Victorian sentiment\xe2\x80\x94and we who\r\n      consider ourselves the intellectuals cover it up by pretending\r\n      that it\xe2\x80\x99s another side of us, has nothing to do with our shining\r\n      brains; we pretend that the fact that we realize it is really\r\n      absolving us from being a prey to it. But the truth is that sex\r\n      is right in the middle of our purest abstractions, so close that\r\n      it obscures vision.... I can kiss you now and will. ...\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\n      leaned toward her in his saddle, but she drew away.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t kiss you now\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m more sensitive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re more stupid then,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared rather impatiently.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIntellect is no protection from sex any more than convention\r\n      is...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is?\xe2\x80\x9d she fired up. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Catholic Church or the maxims of\r\n      Confucius?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory looked up, rather taken aback.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s your panacea, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re just an\r\n      old hypocrite, too. Thousands of scowling priests keeping the\r\n      degenerate Italians and illiterate Irish repentant with\r\n      gabble-gabble about the sixth and ninth commandments. It\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\n      all cloaks, sentiment and spiritual rouge and panaceas. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\n      you there is no God, not even a definite abstract goodness; so\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x99s all got to be worked out for the individual by the\r\n      individual here in high white foreheads like mine, and you\xe2\x80\x99re too\r\n      much the prig to admit it.\xe2\x80\x9d She let go her reins and shook her\r\n      little fists at the stars.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s a God let him strike me\xe2\x80\x94strike me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTalking about God again after the manner of atheists,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory\r\n      said sharply. His materialism, always a thin cloak, was torn to\r\n      shreds by Eleanor\xe2\x80\x99s blasphemy.... She knew it and it angered him\r\n      that she knew it.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd like most intellectuals who don\xe2\x80\x99t find faith convenient,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n      continued coldly, \xe2\x80\x9clike Napoleon and Oscar Wilde and the rest of\r\n      your type, you\xe2\x80\x99ll yell loudly for a priest on your death-bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Eleanor drew her horse up sharply and he reined in beside her.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWill I?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a queer voice that scared him. \xe2\x80\x9cWill I?\r\n      Watch! _I\xe2\x80\x99m going over the cliff!_\xe2\x80\x9d And before he could interfere\r\n      she had turned and was riding breakneck for the end of the\r\n      plateau.\r\n\r\n      He wheeled and started after her, his body like ice, his nerves\r\n      in a vast clangor. There was no chance of stopping her. The moon\r\n      was under a cloud and her horse would step blindly over. Then\r\n      some ten feet from the edge of the cliff she gave a sudden shriek\r\n      and flung herself sideways\xe2\x80\x94plunged from her horse and, rolling\r\n      over twice, landed in a pile of brush five feet from the edge.\r\n      The horse went over with a frantic whinny. In a minute he was by\r\n      Eleanor\xe2\x80\x99s side and saw that her eyes were open.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEleanor!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n      She did not answer, but her lips moved and her eyes filled with\r\n      sudden tears.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEleanor, are you hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said faintly, and then began weeping.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy horse dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood God\xe2\x80\x94Yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was going over. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He helped her gently to her feet and boosted her onto his saddle.\r\n      So they started homeward; Amory walking and she bent forward on\r\n      the pommel, sobbing bitterly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a crazy streak,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, \xe2\x80\x9ctwice before I\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\n      things like that. When I was eleven mother went\xe2\x80\x94went mad\xe2\x80\x94stark\r\n      raving crazy. We were in Vienna\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      All the way back she talked haltingly about herself, and Amory\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      love waned slowly with the moon. At her door they started from\r\n      habit to kiss good night, but she could not run into his arms,\r\n      nor were they stretched to meet her as in the week before. For a\r\n      minute they stood there, hating each other with a bitter sadness.\r\n      But as Amory had loved himself in Eleanor, so now what he hated\r\n      was only a mirror. Their poses were strewn about the pale dawn\r\n      like broken glass. The stars were long gone and there were left\r\n      only the little sighing gusts of wind and the silences between...\r\n      but naked souls are poor things ever, and soon he turned homeward\r\n      and let new lights come in with the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n      A POEM THAT ELEANOR SENT AMORY SEVERAL YEARS LATER\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Earth-born, over the lilt of the water, Lisping its music and\r\n bearing a burden of light, Bosoming day as a laughing and radiant\r\n daughter... Here we may whisper unheard, unafraid of the night.\r\n Walking alone... was it splendor, or what, we were bound with, Deep in\r\n the time when summer lets down her hair? Shadows we loved and the\r\n patterns they covered the ground with Tapestries, mystical, faint in\r\n the breathless air.\r\n  That was the day... and the night for another story, Pale as a dream\r\n  and shadowed with pencilled trees\xe2\x80\x94 Ghosts of the stars came by who\r\n  had sought for glory, Whispered to us of peace in the plaintive\r\n  breeze, Whispered of old dead faiths that the day had shattered,\r\n  Youth the penny that bought delight of the moon; That was the urge\r\n  that we knew and the language that mattered That was the debt that we\r\n  paid to the usurer June.\r\n  Here, deepest of dreams, by the waters that bring not Anything back\r\n  of the past that we need not know, What if the light is but sun and\r\n  the little streams sing not, We are together, it seems... I have\r\n  loved you so... What did the last night hold, with the summer over,\r\n  Drawing us back to the home in the changing glade? _What leered out\r\n  of the dark in the ghostly clover?_ God!... till you stirred in your\r\n  sleep... and were wild afraid...\r\n  Well... we have passed... we are chronicle now to the eerie. Curious\r\n  metal from meteors that failed in the sky; Earth-born the tireless is\r\n  stretched by the water, quite weary, Close to this ununderstandable\r\n  changeling that\xe2\x80\x99s I... Fear is an echo we traced to Security\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n  daughter; Now we are faces and voices... and less, too soon,\r\n  Whispering half-love over the lilt of the water... Youth the penny\r\n  that bought delight of the moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      A POEM AMORY SENT TO ELEANOR AND WHICH HE CALLED \xe2\x80\x9cSUMMER STORM\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cFaint winds, and a song fading and leaves falling, Faint winds, and\r\n   far away a fading laughter... And the rain and over the fields a\r\n   voice calling...\r\n    Our gray blown cloud scurries and lifts above, Slides on the sun\r\n    and flutters there to waft her Sisters on.  The shadow of a dove\r\n    Falls on the cote, the trees are filled with wings; And down the\r\n    valley through the crying trees The body of the darker storm flies;\r\n    brings With its new air the breath of sunken seas And slender\r\n    tenuous thunder... But I wait... Wait for the mists and for the\r\n    blacker rain\xe2\x80\x94 Heavier winds that stir the veil of fate, Happier\r\n    winds that pile her hair; Again They tear me, teach me, strew the\r\n    heavy air Upon me, winds that I know, and storm.\r\n    There was a summer every rain was rare; There was a season every\r\n    wind was warm.... And now you pass me in the mist... your hair\r\n    Rain-blown about you, damp lips curved once more In that wild\r\n    irony, that gay despair That made you old when we have met before;\r\n    Wraith-like you drift on out before the rain, Across the fields,\r\n    blown with the stemless flowers, With your old hopes, dead leaves\r\n    and loves again\xe2\x80\x94 Dim as a dream and wan with all old hours\r\n    (Whispers will creep into the growing dark... Tumult will die over\r\n    the trees) Now night Tears from her wetted breast the splattered\r\n    blouse Of day, glides down the dreaming hills, tear-bright, To\r\n    cover with her hair the eerie green... Love for the dusk... Love\r\n    for the glistening after; Quiet the trees to their last tops...\r\n    serene...\r\n    Faint winds, and far away a fading laughter...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER 4. The Supercilious Sacrifice\r\n\r\n\r\n      Atlantic City. Amory paced the board walk at day\xe2\x80\x99s end, lulled by\r\n      the everlasting surge of changing waves, smelling the\r\n      half-mournful odor of the salt breeze. The sea, he thought, had\r\n      treasured its memories deeper than the faithless land. It seemed\r\n      still to whisper of Norse galleys ploughing the water world under\r\n      raven-figured flags, of the British dreadnoughts, gray bulwarks\r\n      of civilization steaming up through the fog of one dark July into\r\n      the North Sea.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94Amory Blaine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory looked down into the street below. A low racing car had\r\n      drawn to a stop and a familiar cheerful face protruded from the\r\n      driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome on down, goopher!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Alec.\r\n\r\n      Amory called a greeting and descending a flight of wooden steps\r\n      approached the car. He and Alec had been meeting intermittently,\r\n      but the barrier of Rosalind lay always between them. He was sorry\r\n      for this; he hated to lose Alec.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Blaine, this is Miss Waterson, Miss Wayne, and Mr. Tully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99y do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alec exuberantly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll jump in we\xe2\x80\x99ll take you\r\n      to some secluded nook and give you a wee jolt of Bourbon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory considered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cStep in\xe2\x80\x94move over, Jill, and Amory will smile very handsomely at\r\n      you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory squeezed into the back seat beside a gaudy,\r\n      vermilion-lipped blonde.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Doug Fairbanks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said flippantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWalking for\r\n      exercise or hunting for company?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI was counting the waves,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Amory gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going in\r\n      for statistics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t kid me, Doug.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      When they reached an unfrequented side street Alec stopped the\r\n      car among deep shadows.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you doing down here these cold days, Amory?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded,\r\n      as he produced a quart of Bourbon from under the fur rug.\r\n\r\n      Amory avoided the question. Indeed, he had had no definite reason\r\n      for coming to the coast.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that party of ours, sophomore year?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\n      instead.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo I? When we slept in the pavilions up in Asbury Park\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLord, Alec! It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think that Jesse and Dick and Kerry are\r\n      all three dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Alec shivered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it. These dreary fall days depress me enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Jill seemed to agree.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDoug here is sorta gloomy anyways,\xe2\x80\x9d she commented. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him to\r\n      drink deep\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s good and scarce these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I really want to ask you, Amory, is where you are\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, New York, I suppose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to-night, because if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a room yet you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n      better help me out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGlad to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Tully and I have two rooms with bath between at the\r\n      Ranier, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got to go back to New York. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have\r\n      to move. Question is, will you occupy one of the rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory was willing, if he could get in right away.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find the key in the office; the rooms are in my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Declining further locomotion or further stimulation, Amory left\r\n      the car and sauntered back along the board walk to the hotel.\r\n\r\n      He was in an eddy again, a deep, lethargic gulf, without desire\r\n      to work or write, love or dissipate. For the first time in his\r\n      life he rather longed for death to roll over his generation,\r\n      obliterating their petty fevers and struggles and exultations.\r\n      His youth seemed never so vanished as now in the contrast between\r\n      the utter loneliness of this visit and that riotous, joyful party\r\n      of four years before. Things that had been the merest\r\n      commonplaces of his life then, deep sleep, the sense of beauty\r\n      around him, all desire, had flown away and the gaps they left\r\n      were filled only with the great listlessness of his disillusion.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo hold a man a woman has to appeal to the worst in him.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\n      sentence was the thesis of most of his bad nights, of which he\r\n      felt this was to be one. His mind had already started to play\r\n      variations on the subject. Tireless passion, fierce jealousy,\r\n      longing to possess and crush\xe2\x80\x94these alone were left of all his\r\n      love for Rosalind; these remained to him as payment for the loss\r\n      of his youth\xe2\x80\x94bitter calomel under the thin sugar of love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      exaltation.\r\n\r\n      In his room he undressed and wrapping himself in blankets to keep\r\n      out the chill October air drowsed in an armchair by the open\r\n      window.\r\n\r\n      He remembered a poem he had read months before:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cOh staunch old heart who toiled so long for me, I waste my years\r\n   sailing along the sea\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Yet he had no sense of waste, no sense of the present hope that\r\n      waste implied. He felt that life had rejected him.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRosalind! Rosalind!\xe2\x80\x9d He poured the words softly into the\r\n      half-darkness until she seemed to permeate the room; the wet salt\r\n      breeze filled his hair with moisture, the rim of a moon seared\r\n      the sky and made the curtains dim and ghostly. He fell asleep.\r\n\r\n      When he awoke it was very late and quiet. The blanket had slipped\r\n      partly off his shoulders and he touched his skin to find it damp\r\n      and cold.\r\n\r\n      Then he became aware of a tense whispering not ten feet away.\r\n\r\n      He became rigid.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make a sound!\xe2\x80\x9d It was Alec\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cJill\xe2\x80\x94do you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d breathed very low, very frightened. They were in the\r\n      bathroom.\r\n\r\n      Then his ears caught a louder sound from somewhere along the\r\n      corridor outside. It was a mumbling of men\xe2\x80\x99s voices and a\r\n      repeated muffled rapping. Amory threw off the blankets and moved\r\n      close to the bathroom door.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d came the girl\xe2\x80\x99s voice again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to let them\r\n      in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Suddenly a steady, insistent knocking began at Amory\xe2\x80\x99s hall door\r\n      and simultaneously out of the bathroom came Alec, followed by the\r\n      vermilion-lipped girl. They were both clad in pajamas.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmory!\xe2\x80\x9d an anxious whisper.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s house detectives. My God, Amory\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re just looking for a\r\n      test-case\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, better let them in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. They can get me under the Mann Act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The girl followed him slowly, a rather miserable, pathetic figure\r\n      in the darkness.\r\n\r\n      Amory tried to plan quickly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou make a racket and let them in your room,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested\r\n      anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll get her out by this door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re here too, though. They\xe2\x80\x99ll watch this door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you give a wrong name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo chance. I registered under my own name; besides, they\xe2\x80\x99d trail\r\n      the auto license number.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSay you\xe2\x80\x99re married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cJill says one of the house detectives knows her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The girl had stolen to the bed and tumbled upon it; lay there\r\n      listening wretchedly to the knocking which had grown gradually to\r\n      a pounding. Then came a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, angry and imperative:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOpen up or we\xe2\x80\x99ll break the door in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      In the silence when this voice ceased Amory realized that there\r\n      were other things in the room besides people... over and around\r\n      the figure crouched on the bed there hung an aura, gossamer as a\r\n      moonbeam, tainted as stale, weak wine, yet a horror, diffusively\r\n      brooding already over the three of them... and over by the window\r\n      among the stirring curtains stood something else, featureless and\r\n      indistinguishable, yet strangely familiar.... Simultaneously two\r\n      great cases presented themselves side by side to Amory; all that\r\n      took place in his mind, then, occupied in actual time less than\r\n      ten seconds.\r\n\r\n      The first fact that flashed radiantly on his comprehension was\r\n      the great impersonality of sacrifice\xe2\x80\x94he perceived that what we\r\n      call love and hate, reward and punishment, had no more to do with\r\n      it than the date of the month. He quickly recapitulated the story\r\n      of a sacrifice he had heard of in college: a man had cheated in\r\n      an examination; his roommate in a gust of sentiment had taken the\r\n      entire blame\xe2\x80\x94due to the shame of it the innocent one\xe2\x80\x99s entire\r\n      future seemed shrouded in regret and failure, capped by the\r\n      ingratitude of the real culprit. He had finally taken his own\r\n      life\xe2\x80\x94years afterward the facts had come out. At the time the\r\n      story had both puzzled and worried Amory. Now he realized the\r\n      truth; that sacrifice was no purchase of freedom. It was like a\r\n      great elective office, it was like an inheritance of power\xe2\x80\x94to\r\n      certain people at certain times an essential luxury, carrying\r\n      with it not a guarantee but a responsibility, not a security but\r\n      an infinite risk. Its very momentum might drag him down to\r\n      ruin\xe2\x80\x94the passing of the emotional wave that made it possible\r\n      might leave the one who made it high and dry forever on an island\r\n      of despair.\r\n\r\n      ... Amory knew that afterward Alec would secretly hate him for\r\n      having done so much for him....\r\n\r\n      ... All this was flung before Amory like an opened scroll, while\r\n      ulterior to him and speculating upon him were those two\r\n      breathless, listening forces: the gossamer aura that hung over\r\n      and about the girl and that familiar thing by the window.\r\n\r\n      Sacrifice by its very nature was arrogant and impersonal;\r\n      sacrifice should be eternally supercilious.\r\n\r\n      _Weep not for me but for thy children._\r\n\r\n      That\xe2\x80\x94thought Amory\xe2\x80\x94would be somehow the way God would talk to me.\r\n\r\n      Amory felt a sudden surge of joy and then like a face in a\r\n      motion-picture the aura over the bed faded out; the dynamic\r\n      shadow by the window, that was as near as he could name it,\r\n      remained for the fraction of a moment and then the breeze seemed\r\n      to lift it swiftly out of the room. He clinched his hands in\r\n      quick ecstatic excitement... the ten seconds were up....\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo what I say, Alec\xe2\x80\x94do what I say. Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Alec looked at him dumbly\xe2\x80\x94his face a tableau of anguish.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a family,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Amory slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a family\r\n      and it\xe2\x80\x99s important that you should get out of this. Do you hear\r\n      me?\xe2\x80\x9d He repeated clearly what he had said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was curiously strained, the eyes never\r\n      for a second left Amory\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAlec, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to lie down here. If any one comes in you act\r\n      drunk. You do what I say\xe2\x80\x94if you don\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      There was another moment while they stared at each other. Then\r\n      Amory went briskly to the bureau and, taking his pocket-book,\r\n      beckoned peremptorily to the girl. He heard one word from Alec\r\n      that sounded like \xe2\x80\x9cpenitentiary,\xe2\x80\x9d then he and Jill were in the\r\n      bathroom with the door bolted behind them.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re here with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been with me all\r\n      evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      She nodded, gave a little half cry.\r\n\r\n      In a second he had the door of the other room open and three men\r\n      entered. There was an immediate flood of electric light and he\r\n      stood there blinking.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing a little too dangerous a game, young man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory laughed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The leader of the trio nodded authoritatively at a burly man in a\r\n      check suit.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Olson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI got you, Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99May,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olson, nodding. The other two took a\r\n      curious glance at their quarry and then withdrew, closing the\r\n      door angrily behind them.\r\n\r\n      The burly man regarded Amory contemptuously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever hear of the Mann Act? Coming down here with\r\n      her,\xe2\x80\x9d he indicated the girl with his thumb, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a New York\r\n      license on your car\xe2\x80\x94to a hotel like _this_.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his head\r\n      implying that he had struggled over Amory but now gave him up.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory rather impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you want us to\r\n      do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGet dressed, quick\xe2\x80\x94and tell your friend not to make such a\r\n      racket.\xe2\x80\x9d Jill was sobbing noisily on the bed, but at these words\r\n      she subsided sulkily and, gathering up her clothes, retired to\r\n      the bathroom. As Amory slipped into Alec\xe2\x80\x99s B. V. D.\xe2\x80\x99s he found\r\n      that his attitude toward the situation was agreeably humorous.\r\n      The aggrieved virtue of the burly man made him want to laugh.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody else here?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Olson, trying to look keen and\r\n      ferret-like.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFellow who had the rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s drunk as\r\n      an owl, though. Been in there asleep since six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at him presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you find out?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Amory curiously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNight clerk saw you go up-stairs with this woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory nodded; Jill reappeared from the bathroom, completely if\r\n      rather untidily arrayed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\xe2\x80\x9d began Olson, producing a note-book, \xe2\x80\x9cI want your real\r\n      names\xe2\x80\x94no damn John Smith or Mary Brown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cJust drop that big-bully\r\n      stuff. We merely got caught, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Olson glared at him.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cName?\xe2\x80\x9d he snapped.\r\n\r\n      Amory gave his name and New York address.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSay,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Olson indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cjust ease up on the nursery\r\n      rhymes. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name? Sarah Murphy? Minnie Jackson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl cupping her tear-stained face in her\r\n      hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want my mother to know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my mother to\r\n      know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome on now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cShut up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Amory at Olson.\r\n\r\n      An instant\xe2\x80\x99s pause.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cStella Robbins,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered finally. \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Delivery,\r\n      Rugway, New Hampshire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Olson snapped his note-book shut and looked at them very\r\n      ponderously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBy rights the hotel could turn the evidence over to the police\r\n      and you\xe2\x80\x99d go to penitentiary, you would, for bringin\xe2\x80\x99 a girl from\r\n      one State to \xe2\x80\x99nother f\xe2\x80\x99r immoral purp\xe2\x80\x99ses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He paused to let the\r\n      majesty of his words sink in. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94the hotel is going to let you\r\n      off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get in the papers,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jill fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\n      us off! Huh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      A great lightness surrounded Amory. He realized that he was safe\r\n      and only then did he appreciate the full enormity of what he\r\n      might have incurred.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Olson, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a protective association\r\n      among the hotels. There\xe2\x80\x99s been too much of this stuff, and we got\r\n      a \xe2\x80\x99rangement with the newspapers so that you get a little free\r\n      publicity. Not the name of the hotel, but just a line sayin\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\n      you had a little trouble in \xe2\x80\x99lantic City. See?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re gettin\xe2\x80\x99 off light\xe2\x80\x94damn light\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory briskly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get out of here. We don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      need a valedictory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Olson walked through the bathroom and took a cursory glance at\r\n      Alec\xe2\x80\x99s still form. Then he extinguished the lights and motioned\r\n      them to follow him. As they walked into the elevator Amory\r\n      considered a piece of bravado\xe2\x80\x94yielded finally. He reached out and\r\n      tapped Olson on the arm.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind taking off your hat? There\xe2\x80\x99s a lady in the\r\n      elevator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Olson\xe2\x80\x99s hat came off slowly. There was a rather embarrassing two\r\n      minutes under the lights of the lobby while the night clerk and a\r\n      few belated guests stared at them curiously; the loudly dressed\r\n      girl with bent head, the handsome young man with his chin several\r\n      points aloft; the inference was quite obvious. Then the chill\r\n      outdoors\xe2\x80\x94where the salt air was fresher and keener still with the\r\n      first hints of morning.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou can get one of those taxis and beat it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olson,\r\n      pointing to the blurred outline of two machines whose drivers\r\n      were presumably asleep inside.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olson. He reached in his pocket suggestively, but\r\n      Amory snorted, and, taking the girl\xe2\x80\x99s arm, turned away.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you tell the driver to go?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked as they whirled\r\n      along the dim street.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf that guy writes my mother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99ll ever know about this\xe2\x80\x94except our friends and\r\n      enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Dawn was breaking over the sea.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s getting blue,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt does very well,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Amory critically, and then as an\r\n      after-thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost breakfast-time\xe2\x80\x94do you want something\r\n      to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a cheerful laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cFood is what queered the\r\n      party. We ordered a big supper to be sent up to the room about\r\n      two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Alec didn\xe2\x80\x99t give the waiter a tip, so I guess the\r\n      little bastard snitched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Jill\xe2\x80\x99s low spirits seemed to have gone faster than the scattering\r\n      night. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you want\r\n      to stage that sorta party stay away from liquor, and when you\r\n      want to get tight stay away from bedrooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He tapped suddenly at the glass and they drew up at the door of\r\n      an all-night restaurant.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIs Alec a great friend of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jill as they perched\r\n      themselves on high stools inside, and set their elbows on the\r\n      dingy counter.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe used to be. He probably won\xe2\x80\x99t want to be any more\xe2\x80\x94and never\r\n      understand why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt was sorta crazy you takin\xe2\x80\x99 all that blame. Is he pretty\r\n      important? Kinda more important than you are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory laughed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat remains to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE COLLAPSE OF SEVERAL PILLARS\r\n\r\n      Two days later back in New York Amory found in a newspaper what\r\n      he had been searching for\xe2\x80\x94a dozen lines which announced to whom\r\n      it might concern that Mr. Amory Blaine, who \xe2\x80\x9cgave his address\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      as, etc., had been requested to leave his hotel in Atlantic City\r\n      because of entertaining in his room a lady _not_ his wife.\r\n\r\n      Then he started, and his fingers trembled, for directly above was\r\n      a longer paragraph of which the first words were:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. Leland R. Connage are announcing the engagement of\r\n      their daughter, Rosalind, to Mr. J. Dawson Ryder, of Hartford,\r\n      Connecticut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He dropped the paper and lay down on his bed with a frightened,\r\n      sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach. She was gone,\r\n      definitely, finally gone. Until now he had half unconsciously\r\n      cherished the hope deep in his heart that some day she would need\r\n      him and send for him, cry that it had been a mistake, that her\r\n      heart ached only for the pain she had caused him. Never again\r\n      could he find even the sombre luxury of wanting her\xe2\x80\x94not this\r\n      Rosalind, harder, older\xe2\x80\x94nor any beaten, broken woman that his\r\n      imagination brought to the door of his forties\xe2\x80\x94Amory had wanted\r\n      her youth, the fresh radiance of her mind and body, the stuff\r\n      that she was selling now once and for all. So far as he was\r\n      concerned, young Rosalind was dead.\r\n\r\n      A day later came a crisp, terse letter from Mr. Barton in\r\n      Chicago, which informed him that as three more street-car\r\n      companies had gone into the hands of receivers he could expect\r\n      for the present no further remittances. Last of all, on a dazed\r\n      Sunday night, a telegram told him of Monsignor Darcy\xe2\x80\x99s sudden\r\n      death in Philadelphia five days before.\r\n\r\n      He knew then what it was that he had perceived among the curtains\r\n      of the room in Atlantic City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER 5. The Egotist Becomes a Personage\r\n\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cA fathom deep in sleep I lie With old desires, restrained before,\r\n   To clamor lifeward with a cry, As dark flies out the greying door;\r\n   And so in quest of creeds to share I seek assertive day again... But\r\n   old monotony is there: Endless avenues of rain.\r\n    Oh, might I rise again!  Might I Throw off the heat of that old\r\n    wine, See the new morning mass the sky With fairy towers, line on\r\n    line; Find each mirage in the high air A symbol, not a dream\r\n    again... But old monotony is there: Endless avenues of rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Under the glass portcullis of a theatre Amory stood, watching the\r\n      first great drops of rain splatter down and flatten to dark\r\n      stains on the sidewalk. The air became gray and opalescent; a\r\n      solitary light suddenly outlined a window over the way; then\r\n      another light; then a hundred more danced and glimmered into\r\n      vision. Under his feet a thick, iron-studded skylight turned\r\n      yellow; in the street the lamps of the taxi-cabs sent out\r\n      glistening sheens along the already black pavement. The unwelcome\r\n      November rain had perversely stolen the day\xe2\x80\x99s last hour and\r\n      pawned it with that ancient fence, the night.\r\n\r\n      The silence of the theatre behind him ended with a curious\r\n      snapping sound, followed by the heavy roaring of a rising crowd\r\n      and the interlaced clatter of many voices. The matinee was over.\r\n\r\n      He stood aside, edged a little into the rain to let the throng\r\n      pass. A small boy rushed out, sniffed in the damp, fresh air and\r\n      turned up the collar of his coat; came three or four couples in a\r\n      great hurry; came a further scattering of people whose eyes as\r\n      they emerged glanced invariably, first at the wet street, then at\r\n      the rain-filled air, finally at the dismal sky; last a dense,\r\n      strolling mass that depressed him with its heavy odor compounded\r\n      of the tobacco smell of the men and the fetid sensuousness of\r\n      stale powder on women. After the thick crowd came another\r\n      scattering; a stray half-dozen; a man on crutches; finally the\r\n      rattling bang of folding seats inside announced that the ushers\r\n      were at work.\r\n\r\n      New York seemed not so much awakening as turning over in its bed.\r\n      Pallid men rushed by, pinching together their coat-collars; a\r\n      great swarm of tired, magpie girls from a department-store\r\n      crowded along with shrieks of strident laughter, three to an\r\n      umbrella; a squad of marching policemen passed, already\r\n      miraculously protected by oilskin capes.\r\n\r\n      The rain gave Amory a feeling of detachment, and the numerous\r\n      unpleasant aspects of city life without money occurred to him in\r\n      threatening procession. There was the ghastly, stinking crush of\r\n      the subway\xe2\x80\x94the car cards thrusting themselves at one, leering out\r\n      like dull bores who grab your arm with another story; the\r\n      querulous worry as to whether some one isn\xe2\x80\x99t leaning on you; a\r\n      man deciding not to give his seat to a woman, hating her for it;\r\n      the woman hating him for not doing it; at worst a squalid\r\n      phantasmagoria of breath, and old cloth on human bodies and the\r\n      smells of the food men ate\xe2\x80\x94at best just people\xe2\x80\x94too hot or too\r\n      cold, tired, worried.\r\n\r\n      He pictured the rooms where these people lived\xe2\x80\x94where the patterns\r\n      of the blistered wall-papers were heavy reiterated sunflowers on\r\n      green and yellow backgrounds, where there were tin bathtubs and\r\n      gloomy hallways and verdureless, unnamable spaces in back of the\r\n      buildings; where even love dressed as seduction\xe2\x80\x94a sordid murder\r\n      around the corner, illicit motherhood in the flat above. And\r\n      always there was the economical stuffiness of indoor winter, and\r\n      the long summers, nightmares of perspiration between sticky\r\n      enveloping walls... dirty restaurants where careless, tired\r\n      people helped themselves to sugar with their own used\r\n      coffee-spoons, leaving hard brown deposits in the bowl.\r\n\r\n      It was not so bad where there were only men or else only women;\r\n      it was when they were vilely herded that it all seemed so rotten.\r\n      It was some shame that women gave off at having men see them\r\n      tired and poor\xe2\x80\x94it was some disgust that men had for women who\r\n      were tired and poor. It was dirtier than any battle-field he had\r\n      seen, harder to contemplate than any actual hardship moulded of\r\n      mire and sweat and danger, it was an atmosphere wherein birth and\r\n      marriage and death were loathsome, secret things.\r\n\r\n      He remembered one day in the subway when a delivery boy had\r\n      brought in a great funeral wreath of fresh flowers, how the smell\r\n      of it had suddenly cleared the air and given every one in the car\r\n      a momentary glow.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI detest poor people,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Amory suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate them for\r\n      being poor. Poverty may have been beautiful once, but it\xe2\x80\x99s rotten\r\n      now. It\xe2\x80\x99s the ugliest thing in the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s essentially\r\n      cleaner to be corrupt and rich than it is to be innocent and\r\n      poor.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed to see again a figure whose significance had\r\n      once impressed him\xe2\x80\x94a well-dressed young man gazing from a club\r\n      window on Fifth Avenue and saying something to his companion with\r\n      a look of utter disgust. Probably, thought Amory, what he said\r\n      was: \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t people horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Never before in his life had Amory considered poor people. He\r\n      thought cynically how completely he was lacking in all human\r\n      sympathy. O. Henry had found in these people romance, pathos,\r\n      love, hate\xe2\x80\x94Amory saw only coarseness, physical filth, and\r\n      stupidity. He made no self-accusations: never any more did he\r\n      reproach himself for feelings that were natural and sincere. He\r\n      accepted all his reactions as a part of him, unchangeable,\r\n      unmoral. This problem of poverty transformed, magnified, attached\r\n      to some grander, more dignified attitude might some day even be\r\n      his problem; at present it roused only his profound distaste.\r\n\r\n      He walked over to Fifth Avenue, dodging the blind, black menace\r\n      of umbrellas, and standing in front of Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s hailed an\r\n      auto-bus. Buttoning his coat closely around him he climbed to the\r\n      roof, where he rode in solitary state through the thin,\r\n      persistent rain, stung into alertness by the cool moisture\r\n      perpetually reborn on his cheek. Somewhere in his mind a\r\n      conversation began, rather resumed its place in his attention. It\r\n      was composed not of two voices, but of one, which acted alike as\r\n      questioner and answerer:\r\n\r\n      Question.\xe2\x80\x94Well\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the situation?\r\n\r\n      Answer.\xe2\x80\x94That I have about twenty-four dollars to my name.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94You have the Lake Geneva estate.\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94But I intend to keep it.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Can you live?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine not being able to. People make money in books\r\n      and I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that I can always do the things that people do in\r\n      books. Really they are the only things I can do.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Be definite.\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\xe2\x80\x94nor have I much curiosity. To-morrow\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave New York for good. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad town unless\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x99re on top of it.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Do you want a lot of money?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94No. I am merely afraid of being poor.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Very afraid?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94Just passively afraid.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Where are you drifting?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask _me!_\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t you care?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94Rather. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to commit moral suicide.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Have you no interests left?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94None. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more virtue to lose. Just as a cooling pot gives\r\n      off heat, so all through youth and adolescence we give off\r\n      calories of virtue. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s called ingenuousness.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94An interesting idea.\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s why a \xe2\x80\x9cgood man going wrong\xe2\x80\x9d attracts people. They\r\n      stand around and literally _warm themselves_ at the calories of\r\n      virtue he gives off. Sarah makes an unsophisticated remark and\r\n      the faces simper in delight\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow _innocent_ the poor child is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      They\xe2\x80\x99re warming themselves at her virtue. But Sarah sees the\r\n      simper and never makes that remark again. Only she feels a little\r\n      colder after that.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94All your calories gone?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94All of them. I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to warm myself at other people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      virtue.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Are you corrupt?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94I think so. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about good and evil at\r\n      all any more.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Is that a bad sign in itself?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94Not necessarily.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94What would be the test of corruption?\r\n\r\n      A.\xe2\x80\x94Becoming really insincere\xe2\x80\x94calling myself \xe2\x80\x9cnot such a bad\r\n      fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d thinking I regretted my lost youth when I only envy the\r\n      delights of losing it. Youth is like having a big plate of candy.\r\n      Sentimentalists think they want to be in the pure, simple state\r\n      they were in before they ate the candy. They don\xe2\x80\x99t. They just\r\n      want the fun of eating it all over again. The matron doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\n      to repeat her girlhood\xe2\x80\x94she wants to repeat her honeymoon. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      want to repeat my innocence. I want the pleasure of losing it\r\n      again.\r\n\r\n      Q.\xe2\x80\x94Where are you drifting?\r\n\r\n      This dialogue merged grotesquely into his mind\xe2\x80\x99s most familiar\r\n      state\xe2\x80\x94a grotesque blending of desires, worries, exterior\r\n      impressions and physical reactions.\r\n\r\n      One Hundred and Twenty-seventh Street\xe2\x80\x94or One Hundred and\r\n      Thirty-seventh Street.... Two and three look alike\xe2\x80\x94no, not much.\r\n      Seat damp... are clothes absorbing wetness from seat, or seat\r\n      absorbing dryness from clothes?... Sitting on wet substance gave\r\n      appendicitis, so Froggy Parker\xe2\x80\x99s mother said. Well, he\xe2\x80\x99d had\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll sue the steamboat company, Beatrice said, and my uncle\r\n      has a quarter interest\xe2\x80\x94did Beatrice go to heaven?... probably\r\n      not\xe2\x80\x94He represented Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s immortality, also love-affairs of\r\n      numerous dead men who surely had never thought of him... if it\r\n      wasn\xe2\x80\x99t appendicitis, influenza maybe. What? One Hundred and\r\n      Twentieth Street? That must have been One Hundred and Twelfth\r\n      back there. One O Two instead of One Two Seven. Rosalind not like\r\n      Beatrice, Eleanor like Beatrice, only wilder and brainier.\r\n      Apartments along here expensive\xe2\x80\x94probably hundred and fifty a\r\n      month\xe2\x80\x94maybe two hundred. Uncle had only paid hundred a month for\r\n      whole great big house in Minneapolis. Question\xe2\x80\x94were the stairs on\r\n      the left or right as you came in? Anyway, in 12 Univee they were\r\n      straight back and to the left. What a dirty river\xe2\x80\x94want to go down\r\n      there and see if it\xe2\x80\x99s dirty\xe2\x80\x94French rivers all brown or black, so\r\n      were Southern rivers. Twenty-four dollars meant four hundred and\r\n      eighty doughnuts. He could live on it three months and sleep in\r\n      the park. Wonder where Jill was\xe2\x80\x94Jill Bayne, Fayne, Sayne\xe2\x80\x94what the\r\n      devil\xe2\x80\x94neck hurts, darned uncomfortable seat. No desire to sleep\r\n      with Jill, what could Alec see in her? Alec had a coarse taste in\r\n      women. Own taste the best; Isabelle, Clara, Rosalind, Eleanor,\r\n      were all-American. Eleanor would pitch, probably southpaw.\r\n      Rosalind was outfield, wonderful hitter, Clara first base, maybe.\r\n      Wonder what Humbird\xe2\x80\x99s body looked like now. If he himself hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      been bayonet instructor he\xe2\x80\x99d have gone up to line three months\r\n      sooner, probably been killed. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the darned bell\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      The street numbers of Riverside Drive were obscured by the mist\r\n      and dripping trees from anything but the swiftest scrutiny, but\r\n      Amory had finally caught sight of one\xe2\x80\x94One Hundred and\r\n      Twenty-seventh Street. He got off and with no distinct\r\n      destination followed a winding, descending sidewalk and came out\r\n      facing the river, in particular a long pier and a partitioned\r\n      litter of shipyards for miniature craft: small launches, canoes,\r\n      rowboats, and catboats. He turned northward and followed the\r\n      shore, jumped a small wire fence and found himself in a great\r\n      disorderly yard adjoining a dock. The hulls of many boats in\r\n      various stages of repair were around him; he smelled sawdust and\r\n      paint and the scarcely distinguishable fiat odor of the Hudson. A\r\n      man approached through the heavy gloom.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGot a pass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Is this private?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the Hudson River Sporting and Yacht Club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m just resting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began the man dubiously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go if you want me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The man made non-committal noises in his throat and passed on.\r\n      Amory seated himself on an overturned boat and leaned forward\r\n      thoughtfully until his chin rested in his hand.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMisfortune is liable to make me a damn bad man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n      IN THE DROOPING HOURS\r\n\r\n      While the rain drizzled on Amory looked futilely back at the\r\n      stream of his life, all its glitterings and dirty shallows. To\r\n      begin with, he was still afraid\xe2\x80\x94not physically afraid any more,\r\n      but afraid of people and prejudice and misery and monotony. Yet,\r\n      deep in his bitter heart, he wondered if he was after all worse\r\n      than this man or the next. He knew that he could sophisticate\r\n      himself finally into saying that his own weakness was just the\r\n      result of circumstances and environment; that often when he raged\r\n      at himself as an egotist something would whisper ingratiatingly:\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Genius!\xe2\x80\x9d That was one manifestation of fear, that voice\r\n      which whispered that he could not be both great and good, that\r\n      genius was the exact combination of those inexplicable grooves\r\n      and twists in his mind, that any discipline would curb it to\r\n      mediocrity. Probably more than any concrete vice or failing Amory\r\n      despised his own personality\xe2\x80\x94he loathed knowing that to-morrow\r\n      and the thousand days after he would swell pompously at a\r\n      compliment and sulk at an ill word like a third-rate musician or\r\n      a first-class actor. He was ashamed of the fact that very simple\r\n      and honest people usually distrusted him; that he had been cruel,\r\n      often, to those who had sunk their personalities in him\xe2\x80\x94several\r\n      girls, and a man here and there through college, that he had been\r\n      an evil influence on; people who had followed him here and there\r\n      into mental adventures from which he alone rebounded unscathed.\r\n\r\n      Usually, on nights like this, for there had been many lately, he\r\n      could escape from this consuming introspection by thinking of\r\n      children and the infinite possibilities of children\xe2\x80\x94he leaned and\r\n      listened and he heard a startled baby awake in a house across the\r\n      street and lend a tiny whimper to the still night. Quick as a\r\n      flash he turned away, wondering with a touch of panic whether\r\n      something in the brooding despair of his mood had made a darkness\r\n      in its tiny soul. He shivered. What if some day the balance was\r\n      overturned, and he became a thing that frightened children and\r\n      crept into rooms in the dark, approached dim communion with those\r\n      phantoms who whispered shadowy secrets to the mad of that dark\r\n      continent upon the moon....\r\n\r\n\r\n      Amory smiled a bit.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too much wrapped up in yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard some one say.\r\n      And again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGet out and do some real work\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cStop worrying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He fancied a possible future comment of his own.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I was perhaps an egotist in youth, but I soon found it made\r\n      me morbid to think too much about myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly he felt an overwhelming desire to let himself go to the\r\n      devil\xe2\x80\x94not to go violently as a gentleman should, but to sink\r\n      safely and sensuously out of sight. He pictured himself in an\r\n      adobe house in Mexico, half-reclining on a rug-covered couch, his\r\n      slender, artistic fingers closed on a cigarette while he listened\r\n      to guitars strumming melancholy undertones to an age-old dirge of\r\n      Castile and an olive-skinned, carmine-lipped girl caressed his\r\n      hair. Here he might live a strange litany, delivered from right\r\n      and wrong and from the hound of heaven and from every God (except\r\n      the exotic Mexican one who was pretty slack himself and rather\r\n      addicted to Oriental scents)\xe2\x80\x94delivered from success and hope and\r\n      poverty into that long chute of indulgence which led, after all,\r\n      only to the artificial lake of death.\r\n\r\n      There were so many places where one might deteriorate pleasantly:\r\n      Port Said, Shanghai, parts of Turkestan, Constantinople, the\r\n      South Seas\xe2\x80\x94all lands of sad, haunting music and many odors, where\r\n      lust could be a mode and expression of life, where the shades of\r\n      night skies and sunsets would seem to reflect only moods of\r\n      passion: the colors of lips and poppies.\r\n\r\n\r\n      STILL WEEDING\r\n\r\n      Once he had been miraculously able to scent evil as a horse\r\n      detects a broken bridge at night, but the man with the queer feet\r\n      in Phoebe\xe2\x80\x99s room had diminished to the aura over Jill. His\r\n      instinct perceived the fetidness of poverty, but no longer\r\n      ferreted out the deeper evils in pride and sensuality.\r\n\r\n      There were no more wise men; there were no more heroes; Burne\r\n      Holiday was sunk from sight as though he had never lived;\r\n      Monsignor was dead. Amory had grown up to a thousand books, a\r\n      thousand lies; he had listened eagerly to people who pretended to\r\n      know, who knew nothing. The mystical reveries of saints that had\r\n      once filled him with awe in the still hours of night, now vaguely\r\n      repelled him. The Byrons and Brookes who had defied life from\r\n      mountain tops were in the end but flaneurs and poseurs, at best\r\n      mistaking the shadow of courage for the substance of wisdom. The\r\n      pageantry of his disillusion took shape in a world-old procession\r\n      of Prophets, Athenians, Martyrs, Saints, Scientists, Don Juans,\r\n      Jesuits, Puritans, Fausts, Poets, Pacifists; like costumed alumni\r\n      at a college reunion they streamed before him as their dreams,\r\n      personalities, and creeds had in turn thrown colored lights on\r\n      his soul; each had tried to express the glory of life and the\r\n      tremendous significance of man; each had boasted of synchronizing\r\n      what had gone before into his own rickety generalities; each had\r\n      depended after all on the set stage and the convention of the\r\n      theatre, which is that man in his hunger for faith will feed his\r\n      mind with the nearest and most convenient food.\r\n\r\n      Women\xe2\x80\x94of whom he had expected so much; whose beauty he had hoped\r\n      to transmute into modes of art; whose unfathomable instincts,\r\n      marvellously incoherent and inarticulate, he had thought to\r\n      perpetuate in terms of experience\xe2\x80\x94had become merely consecrations\r\n      to their own posterity. Isabelle, Clara, Rosalind, Eleanor, were\r\n      all removed by their very beauty, around which men had swarmed,\r\n      from the possibility of contributing anything but a sick heart\r\n      and a page of puzzled words to write.\r\n\r\n      Amory based his loss of faith in help from others on several\r\n      sweeping syllogisms. Granted that his generation, however bruised\r\n      and decimated from this Victorian war, were the heirs of\r\n      progress. Waving aside petty differences of conclusions which,\r\n      although they might occasionally cause the deaths of several\r\n      millions of young men, might be explained away\xe2\x80\x94supposing that\r\n      after all Bernard Shaw and Bernhardi, Bonar Law and\r\n      Bethmann-Hollweg were mutual heirs of progress if only in\r\n      agreeing against the ducking of witches\xe2\x80\x94waiving the antitheses\r\n      and approaching individually these men who seemed to be the\r\n      leaders, he was repelled by the discrepancies and contradictions\r\n      in the men themselves.\r\n\r\n      There was, for example, Thornton Hancock, respected by half the\r\n      intellectual world as an authority on life, a man who had\r\n      verified and believed the code he lived by, an educator of\r\n      educators, an adviser to Presidents\xe2\x80\x94yet Amory knew that this man\r\n      had, in his heart, leaned on the priest of another religion.\r\n\r\n      And Monsignor, upon whom a cardinal rested, had moments of\r\n      strange and horrible insecurity\xe2\x80\x94inexplicable in a religion that\r\n      explained even disbelief in terms of its own faith: if you\r\n      doubted the devil it was the devil that made you doubt him. Amory\r\n      had seen Monsignor go to the houses of stolid philistines, read\r\n      popular novels furiously, saturate himself in routine, to escape\r\n      from that horror.\r\n\r\n      And this priest, a little wiser, somewhat purer, had been, Amory\r\n      knew, not essentially older than he.\r\n\r\n      Amory was alone\xe2\x80\x94he had escaped from a small enclosure into a\r\n      great labyrinth. He was where Goethe was when he began \xe2\x80\x9cFaust\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\n      he was where Conrad was when he wrote \xe2\x80\x9cAlmayer\xe2\x80\x99s Folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory said to himself that there were essentially two sorts of\r\n      people who through natural clarity or disillusion left the\r\n      enclosure and sought the labyrinth. There were men like Wells and\r\n      Plato, who had, half unconsciously, a strange, hidden orthodoxy,\r\n      who would accept for themselves only what could be accepted for\r\n      all men\xe2\x80\x94incurable romanticists who never, for all their efforts,\r\n      could enter the labyrinth as stark souls; there were on the other\r\n      hand sword-like pioneering personalities, Samuel Butler, Renan,\r\n      Voltaire, who progressed much slower, yet eventually much\r\n      further, not in the direct pessimistic line of speculative\r\n      philosophy but concerned in the eternal attempt to attach a\r\n      positive value to life....\r\n\r\n      Amory stopped. He began for the first time in his life to have a\r\n      strong distrust of all generalities and epigrams. They were too\r\n      easy, too dangerous to the public mind. Yet all thought usually\r\n      reached the public after thirty years in some such form: Benson\r\n      and Chesterton had popularized Huysmans and Newman; Shaw had\r\n      sugar-coated Nietzsche and Ibsen and Schopenhauer. The man in the\r\n      street heard the conclusions of dead genius through some one\r\n      else\xe2\x80\x99s clever paradoxes and didactic epigrams.\r\n\r\n      Life was a damned muddle... a football game with every one\r\n      off-side and the referee gotten rid of\xe2\x80\x94every one claiming the\r\n      referee would have been on his side....\r\n\r\n      Progress was a labyrinth... people plunging blindly in and then\r\n      rushing wildly back, shouting that they had found it... the\r\n      invisible king\xe2\x80\x94the elan vital\xe2\x80\x94the principle of evolution...\r\n      writing a book, starting a war, founding a school....\r\n\r\n      Amory, even had he not been a selfish man, would have started all\r\n      inquiries with himself. He was his own best example\xe2\x80\x94sitting in\r\n      the rain, a human creature of sex and pride, foiled by chance and\r\n      his own temperament of the balm of love and children, preserved\r\n      to help in building up the living consciousness of the race.\r\n\r\n      In self-reproach and loneliness and disillusion he came to the\r\n      entrance of the labyrinth.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Another dawn flung itself across the river, a belated taxi\r\n      hurried along the street, its lamps still shining like burning\r\n      eyes in a face white from a night\xe2\x80\x99s carouse. A melancholy siren\r\n      sounded far down the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n      MONSIGNOR\r\n\r\n      Amory kept thinking how Monsignor would have enjoyed his own\r\n      funeral. It was magnificently Catholic and liturgical. Bishop\r\n      O\xe2\x80\x99Neill sang solemn high mass and the cardinal gave the final\r\n      absolutions. Thornton Hancock, Mrs. Lawrence, the British and\r\n      Italian ambassadors, the papal delegate, and a host of friends\r\n      and priests were there\xe2\x80\x94yet the inexorable shears had cut through\r\n      all these threads that Monsignor had gathered into his hands. To\r\n      Amory it was a haunting grief to see him lying in his coffin,\r\n      with closed hands upon his purple vestments. His face had not\r\n      changed, and, as he never knew he was dying, it showed no pain or\r\n      fear. It was Amory\xe2\x80\x99s dear old friend, his and the others\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\n      church was full of people with daft, staring faces, the most\r\n      exalted seeming the most stricken.\r\n\r\n      The cardinal, like an archangel in cope and mitre, sprinkled the\r\n      holy water; the organ broke into sound; the choir began to sing\r\n      the Requiem Eternam.\r\n\r\n      All these people grieved because they had to some extent depended\r\n      upon Monsignor. Their grief was more than sentiment for the\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9ccrack in his voice or a certain break in his walk,\xe2\x80\x9d as Wells put\r\n      it. These people had leaned on Monsignor\xe2\x80\x99s faith, his way of\r\n      finding cheer, of making religion a thing of lights and shadows,\r\n      making all light and shadow merely aspects of God. People felt\r\n      safe when he was near.\r\n\r\n      Of Amory\xe2\x80\x99s attempted sacrifice had been born merely the full\r\n      realization of his disillusion, but of Monsignor\xe2\x80\x99s funeral was\r\n      born the romantic elf who was to enter the labyrinth with him. He\r\n      found something that he wanted, had always wanted and always\r\n      would want\xe2\x80\x94not to be admired, as he had feared; not to be loved,\r\n      as he had made himself believe; but to be necessary to people, to\r\n      be indispensable; he remembered the sense of security he had\r\n      found in Burne.\r\n\r\n      Life opened up in one of its amazing bursts of radiance and Amory\r\n      suddenly and permanently rejected an old epigram that had been\r\n      playing listlessly in his mind: \xe2\x80\x9cVery few things matter and\r\n      nothing matters very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      On the contrary, Amory felt an immense desire to give people a\r\n      sense of security.\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE BIG MAN WITH GOGGLES\r\n\r\n      On the day that Amory started on his walk to Princeton the sky\r\n      was a colorless vault, cool, high and barren of the threat of\r\n      rain. It was a gray day, that least fleshly of all weathers; a\r\n      day of dreams and far hopes and clear visions. It was a day\r\n      easily associated with those abstract truths and purities that\r\n      dissolve in the sunshine or fade out in mocking laughter by the\r\n      light of the moon. The trees and clouds were carved in classical\r\n      severity; the sounds of the countryside had harmonized to a\r\n      monotone, metallic as a trumpet, breathless as the Grecian urn.\r\n\r\n      The day had put Amory in such a contemplative mood that he caused\r\n      much annoyance to several motorists who were forced to slow up\r\n      considerably or else run him down. So engrossed in his thoughts\r\n      was he that he was scarcely surprised at that strange\r\n      phenomenon\xe2\x80\x94cordiality manifested within fifty miles of\r\n      Manhattan\xe2\x80\x94when a passing car slowed down beside him and a voice\r\n      hailed him. He looked up and saw a magnificent Locomobile in\r\n      which sat two middle-aged men, one of them small and anxious\r\n      looking, apparently an artificial growth on the other who was\r\n      large and begoggled and imposing.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want a lift?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the apparently artificial growth,\r\n      glancing from the corner of his eye at the imposing man as if for\r\n      some habitual, silent corroboration.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou bet I do. Thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The chauffeur swung open the door, and, climbing in, Amory\r\n      settled himself in the middle of the back seat. He took in his\r\n      companions curiously. The chief characteristic of the big man\r\n      seemed to be a great confidence in himself set off against a\r\n      tremendous boredom with everything around him. That part of his\r\n      face which protruded under the goggles was what is generally\r\n      termed \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d; rolls of not undignified fat had collected near\r\n      his chin; somewhere above was a wide thin mouth and the rough\r\n      model for a Roman nose, and, below, his shoulders collapsed\r\n      without a struggle into the powerful bulk of his chest and belly.\r\n      He was excellently and quietly dressed. Amory noticed that he was\r\n      inclined to stare straight at the back of the chauffeur\xe2\x80\x99s head as\r\n      if speculating steadily but hopelessly some baffling hirsute\r\n      problem.\r\n\r\n      The smaller man was remarkable only for his complete submersion\r\n      in the personality of the other. He was of that lower secretarial\r\n      type who at forty have engraved upon their business cards:\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAssistant to the President,\xe2\x80\x9d and without a sigh consecrate the\r\n      rest of their lives to second-hand mannerisms.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGoing far?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the smaller man in a pleasant disinterested\r\n      way.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cQuite a stretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHiking for exercise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Amory succinctly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m walking because I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      afford to ride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Then again:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAre you looking for work? Because there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of work,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n      continued rather testily. \xe2\x80\x9cAll this talk of lack of work. The\r\n      West is especially short of labor.\xe2\x80\x9d He expressed the West with a\r\n      sweeping, lateral gesture. Amory nodded politely.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHave you a trade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      No\xe2\x80\x94Amory had no trade.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cClerk, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      No\xe2\x80\x94Amory was not a clerk.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever your line is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little man, seeming to agree\r\n      wisely with something Amory had said, \xe2\x80\x9cnow is the time of\r\n      opportunity and business openings.\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced again toward the\r\n      big man, as a lawyer grilling a witness glances involuntarily at\r\n      the jury.\r\n\r\n      Amory decided that he must say something and for the life of him\r\n      could think of only one thing to say.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I want a great lot of money\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The little man laughed mirthlessly but conscientiously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what every one wants nowadays, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\n      work for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cA very natural, healthy desire. Almost all normal people want to\r\n      be rich without great effort\xe2\x80\x94except the financiers in problem\r\n      plays, who want to \xe2\x80\x98crash their way through.\xe2\x80\x99 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want easy\r\n      money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the secretary indignantly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Amory disregarding him, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing very poor at\r\n      present I am contemplating socialism as possibly my forte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Both men glanced at him curiously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThese bomb throwers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The little man ceased as words lurched\r\n      ponderously from the big man\xe2\x80\x99s chest.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf I thought you were a bomb thrower I\xe2\x80\x99d run you over to the\r\n      Newark jail. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I think of Socialists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory laughed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the big man, \xe2\x80\x9cone of these parlor\r\n      Bolsheviks, one of these idealists? I must say I fail to see the\r\n      difference. The idealists loaf around and write the stuff that\r\n      stirs up the poor immigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory, \xe2\x80\x9cif being an idealist is both safe and\r\n      lucrative, I might try it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your difficulty? Lost your job?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly, but\xe2\x80\x94well, call it that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWriting copy for an advertising agency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLots of money in advertising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory smiled discreetly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit there\xe2\x80\x99s money in it eventually. Talent doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      starve any more. Even art gets enough to eat these days. Artists\r\n      draw your magazine covers, write your advertisements, hash out\r\n      rag-time for your theatres. By the great commercializing of\r\n      printing you\xe2\x80\x99ve found a harmless, polite occupation for every\r\n      genius who might have carved his own niche. But beware the artist\r\n      who\xe2\x80\x99s an intellectual also. The artist who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      Rousseau, the Tolstoi, the Samuel Butler, the Amory Blaine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the little man suspiciously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s an intellectual personage not\r\n      very well known at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The little man laughed his conscientious laugh, and stopped\r\n      rather suddenly as Amory\xe2\x80\x99s burning eyes turned on him.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThese _intellectual_ people\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what it means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The little man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes twitched nervously.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it _usually_ means\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt _always_ means brainy and well-educated,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Amory.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt means having an active knowledge of the race\xe2\x80\x99s experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      Amory decided to be very rude. He turned to the big man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\n      young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he indicated the secretary with his thumb, and said\r\n      young man as one says bell-boy, with no implication of youth,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9chas the usual muddled connotation of all popular words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou object to the fact that capital controls printing?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\n      big man, fixing him with his goggles.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94and I object to doing their mental work for them. It seemed\r\n      to me that the root of all the business I saw around me consisted\r\n      in overworking and underpaying a bunch of dubs who submitted to\r\n      it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHere now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the big man, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to admit that the\r\n      laboring man is certainly highly paid\xe2\x80\x94five and six hour days\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      ridiculous. You can\xe2\x80\x99t buy an honest day\xe2\x80\x99s work from a man in the\r\n      trades-unions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve brought it on yourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cYou people\r\n      never make concessions until they\xe2\x80\x99re wrung out of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYour class; the class I belonged to until recently; those who by\r\n      inheritance or industry or brains or dishonesty have become the\r\n      moneyed class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo you imagine that if that road-mender over there had the money\r\n      he\xe2\x80\x99d be any more willing to give it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, but what\xe2\x80\x99s that got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The older man considered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. It rather sounds as if it had though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Amory, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99d be worse. The lower classes are\r\n      narrower, less pleasant and personally more selfish\xe2\x80\x94certainly\r\n      more stupid. But all that has nothing to do with the question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cJust exactly what is the question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Here Amory had to pause to consider exactly what the question\r\n      was.\r\n\r\n\r\n      AMORY COINS A PHRASE\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhen life gets hold of a brainy man of fair education,\xe2\x80\x9d began\r\n      Amory slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is, when he marries he becomes, nine times\r\n      out of ten, a conservative as far as existing social conditions\r\n      are concerned. He may be unselfish, kind-hearted, even just in\r\n      his own way, but his first job is to provide and to hold fast.\r\n      His wife shoos him on, from ten thousand a year to twenty\r\n      thousand a year, on and on, in an enclosed treadmill that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      any windows. He\xe2\x80\x99s done! Life\xe2\x80\x99s got him! He\xe2\x80\x99s no help! He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\n      spiritually married man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory paused and decided that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a bad phrase.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSome men,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cescape the grip. Maybe their wives\r\n      have no social ambitions; maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ve hit a sentence or two in\r\n      a \xe2\x80\x98dangerous book\xe2\x80\x99 that pleased them; maybe they started on the\r\n      treadmill as I did and were knocked off. Anyway, they\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\n      congressmen you can\xe2\x80\x99t bribe, the Presidents who aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      politicians, the writers, speakers, scientists, statesmen who\r\n      aren\xe2\x80\x99t just popular grab-bags for a half-dozen women and\r\n      children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the natural radical?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cHe may vary from the disillusioned critic\r\n      like old Thornton Hancock, all the way to Trotsky. Now this\r\n      spiritually unmarried man hasn\xe2\x80\x99t direct power, for unfortunately\r\n      the spiritually married man, as a by-product of his money chase,\r\n      has garnered in the great newspaper, the popular magazine, the\r\n      influential weekly\xe2\x80\x94so that Mrs. Newspaper, Mrs. Magazine, Mrs.\r\n      Weekly can have a better limousine than those oil people across\r\n      the street or those cement people \xe2\x80\x99round the corner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes wealthy men the keepers of the world\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual\r\n      conscience and, of course, a man who has money under one set of\r\n      social institutions quite naturally can\xe2\x80\x99t risk his family\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      happiness by letting the clamor for another appear in his\r\n      newspaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut it appears,\xe2\x80\x9d said the big man.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x94in the discredited mediums. Rotten cheap-papered\r\n      weeklies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll right\xe2\x80\x94go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my first point is that through a mixture of conditions of\r\n      which the family is the first, there are these two sorts of\r\n      brains. One sort takes human nature as it finds it, uses its\r\n      timidity, its weakness, and its strength for its own ends.\r\n      Opposed is the man who, being spiritually unmarried, continually\r\n      seeks for new systems that will control or counteract human\r\n      nature. His problem is harder. It is not life that\xe2\x80\x99s complicated,\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x99s the struggle to guide and control life. That is his\r\n      struggle. He is a part of progress\xe2\x80\x94the spiritually married man is\r\n      not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The big man produced three big cigars, and proffered them on his\r\n      huge palm. The little man took one, Amory shook his head and\r\n      reached for a cigarette.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGo on talking,\xe2\x80\x9d said the big man. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to hear one\r\n      of you fellows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      GOING FASTER\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cModern life,\xe2\x80\x9d began Amory again, \xe2\x80\x9cchanges no longer century by\r\n      century, but year by year, ten times faster than it ever has\r\n      before\xe2\x80\x94populations doubling, civilizations unified more closely\r\n      with other civilizations, economic interdependence, racial\r\n      questions, and\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re _dawdling_ along. My idea is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\n      to go very much faster.\xe2\x80\x9d He slightly emphasized the last words\r\n      and the chauffeur unconsciously increased the speed of the car.\r\n      Amory and the big man laughed; the little man laughed, too, after\r\n      a pause.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEvery child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory, \xe2\x80\x9cshould have an equal start. If his\r\n      father can endow him with a good physique and his mother with\r\n      some common sense in his early education, that should be his\r\n      heritage. If the father can\xe2\x80\x99t give him a good physique, if the\r\n      mother has spent in chasing men the years in which she should\r\n      have been preparing herself to educate her children, so much the\r\n      worse for the child. He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be artificially bolstered up\r\n      with money, sent to these horrible tutoring schools, dragged\r\n      through college... Every boy ought to have an equal start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the big man, his goggles indicating neither\r\n      approval nor objection.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNext I\xe2\x80\x99d have a fair trial of government ownership of all\r\n      industries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s been proven a failure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it merely failed. If we had government ownership we\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\n      the best analytical business minds in the government working for\r\n      something besides themselves. We\xe2\x80\x99d have Mackays instead of\r\n      Burlesons; we\xe2\x80\x99d have Morgans in the Treasury Department; we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n      have Hills running interstate commerce. We\xe2\x80\x99d have the best\r\n      lawyers in the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give their best efforts for nothing. McAdoo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only\r\n      stimulus that brings out the best that\xe2\x80\x99s in a man, even in\r\n      America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou said a while ago that it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is, right now. But if it were made illegal to have more than\r\n      a certain amount the best men would all flock for the one other\r\n      reward which attracts humanity\xe2\x80\x94honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The big man made a sound that was very like _boo_.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the silliest thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve said yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t silly. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite plausible. If you\xe2\x80\x99d gone to\r\n      college you\xe2\x80\x99d have been struck by the fact that the men there\r\n      would work twice as hard for any one of a hundred petty honors as\r\n      those other men did who were earning their way through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cKids\xe2\x80\x94child\xe2\x80\x99s play!\xe2\x80\x9d scoffed his antagonist.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot by a darned sight\xe2\x80\x94unless we\xe2\x80\x99re all children. Did you ever\r\n      see a grown man when he\xe2\x80\x99s trying for a secret society\xe2\x80\x94or a rising\r\n      family whose name is up at some club? They\xe2\x80\x99ll jump when they hear\r\n      the sound of the word. The idea that to make a man work you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\n      got to hold gold in front of his eyes is a growth, not an axiom.\r\n      We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that for so long that we\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten there\xe2\x80\x99s any\r\n      other way. We\xe2\x80\x99ve made a world where that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary. Let me tell\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Amory became emphatic\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif there were ten men insured against\r\n      either wealth or starvation, and offered a green ribbon for five\r\n      hours\xe2\x80\x99 work a day and a blue ribbon for ten hours\xe2\x80\x99 work a day,\r\n      nine out of ten of them would be trying for the blue ribbon. That\r\n      competitive instinct only wants a badge. If the size of their\r\n      house is the badge they\xe2\x80\x99ll sweat their heads off for that. If\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x99s only a blue ribbon, I damn near believe they\xe2\x80\x99ll work just as\r\n      hard. They have in other ages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory nodding sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter any\r\n      more though. I think these people are going to come and take what\r\n      they want pretty soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      A fierce hiss came from the little man.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c_Machine-guns!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve taught them their use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The big man shook his head.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIn this country there are enough property owners not to permit\r\n      that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory wished he knew the statistics of property owners and\r\n      non-property owners; he decided to change the subject.\r\n\r\n      But the big man was aroused.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you talk of \xe2\x80\x98taking things away,\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99re on dangerous\r\n      ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow can they get it without taking it? For years people have\r\n      been stalled off with promises. Socialism may not be progress,\r\n      but the threat of the red flag is certainly the inspiring force\r\n      of all reform. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be sensational to get attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRussia is your example of a beneficent violence, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cQuite possibly,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, it\xe2\x80\x99s overflowing\r\n      just as the French Revolution did, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      really a great experiment and well worth while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you believe in moderation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to the moderates, and it\xe2\x80\x99s almost too late. The\r\n      truth is that the public has done one of those startling and\r\n      amazing things that they do about once in a hundred years.\r\n      They\xe2\x80\x99ve seized an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat however the brains and abilities of men may differ, their\r\n      stomachs are essentially the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE LITTLE MAN GETS HIS\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf you took all the money in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little man\r\n      with much profundity, \xe2\x80\x9cand divided it up in equ\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, shut up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory briskly and, paying no attention to the\r\n      little man\xe2\x80\x99s enraged stare, he went on with his argument.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe human stomach\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began; but the big man interrupted rather\r\n      impatiently.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m letting you talk, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut please avoid\r\n      stomachs. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling mine all day. Anyway, I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree\r\n      with one-half you\xe2\x80\x99ve said. Government ownership is the basis of\r\n      your whole argument, and it\xe2\x80\x99s invariably a beehive of corruption.\r\n      Men won\xe2\x80\x99t work for blue ribbons, that\xe2\x80\x99s all rot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      When he ceased the little man spoke up with a determined nod, as\r\n      if resolved this time to have his say out.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere are certain things which are human nature,\xe2\x80\x9d he asserted\r\n      with an owl-like look, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich always have been and always will\r\n      be, which can\xe2\x80\x99t be changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory looked from the small man to the big man helplessly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cListen to that! _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ what makes me discouraged with\r\n      progress. _Listen_ to that! I can name offhand over one hundred\r\n      natural phenomena that have been changed by the will of man\xe2\x80\x94a\r\n      hundred instincts in man that have been wiped out or are now held\r\n      in check by civilization. What this man here just said has been\r\n      for thousands of years the last refuge of the associated\r\n      mutton-heads of the world. It negates the efforts of every\r\n      scientist, statesman, moralist, reformer, doctor, and philosopher\r\n      that ever gave his life to humanity\xe2\x80\x99s service. It\xe2\x80\x99s a flat\r\n      impeachment of all that\xe2\x80\x99s worth while in human nature. Every\r\n      person over twenty-five years old who makes that statement in\r\n      cold blood ought to be deprived of the franchise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The little man leaned back against the seat, his face purple with\r\n      rage. Amory continued, addressing his remarks to the big man.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThese quarter-educated, stale-minded men such as your friend\r\n      here, who _think_ they think, every question that comes up,\r\n      you\xe2\x80\x99ll find his type in the usual ghastly muddle. One minute it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98the brutality and inhumanity of these Prussians\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the next it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98we ought to exterminate the whole German people.\xe2\x80\x99 They always\r\n      believe that \xe2\x80\x98things are in a bad way now,\xe2\x80\x99 but they \xe2\x80\x98haven\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\n      faith in these idealists.\xe2\x80\x99 One minute they call Wilson \xe2\x80\x98just a\r\n      dreamer, not practical\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94a year later they rail at him for making\r\n      his dreams realities. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t clear logical ideas on one\r\n      single subject except a sturdy, stolid opposition to all change.\r\n      They don\xe2\x80\x99t think uneducated people should be highly paid, but\r\n      they won\xe2\x80\x99t see that if they don\xe2\x80\x99t pay the uneducated people their\r\n      children are going to be uneducated too, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going round\r\n      and round in a circle. That\xe2\x80\x94is the great middle class!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The big man with a broad grin on his face leaned over and smiled\r\n      at the little man.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re catching it pretty heavy, Garvin; how do you feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The little man made an attempt to smile and act as if the whole\r\n      matter were so ridiculous as to be beneath notice. But Amory was\r\n      not through.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe theory that people are fit to govern themselves rests on\r\n      this man. If he can be educated to think clearly, concisely, and\r\n      logically, freed of his habit of taking refuge in platitudes and\r\n      prejudices and sentimentalisms, then I\xe2\x80\x99m a militant Socialist. If\r\n      he can\xe2\x80\x99t, then I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it matters much what happens to man\r\n      or his systems, now or hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI am both interested and amused,\xe2\x80\x9d said the big man. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\n      very young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhich may only mean that I have neither been corrupted nor made\r\n      timid by contemporary experience. I possess the most valuable\r\n      experience, the experience of the race, for in spite of going to\r\n      college I\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to pick up a good education.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk glibly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not all rubbish,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Amory passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the\r\n      first time in my life I\xe2\x80\x99ve argued Socialism. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only\r\n      panacea I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m restless. My whole generation is restless.\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of a system where the richest man gets the most\r\n      beautiful girl if he wants her, where the artist without an\r\n      income has to sell his talents to a button manufacturer. Even if\r\n      I had no talents I\xe2\x80\x99d not be content to work ten years, condemned\r\n      either to celibacy or a furtive indulgence, to give some man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      son an automobile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Amory. \xe2\x80\x9cMy position couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\n      worse. A social revolution might land me on top. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n      selfish. It seems to me I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a fish out of water in too many\r\n      outworn systems. I was probably one of the two dozen men in my\r\n      class at college who got a decent education; still they\xe2\x80\x99d let any\r\n      well-tutored flathead play football and _I_ was ineligible,\r\n      because some silly old men thought we should _all_ profit by\r\n      conic sections. I loathed the army. I loathed business. I\xe2\x80\x99m in\r\n      love with change and I\xe2\x80\x99ve killed my conscience\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ll go along crying that we must go faster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat, at least, is true,\xe2\x80\x9d Amory insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cReform won\xe2\x80\x99t catch up\r\n      to the needs of civilization unless it\xe2\x80\x99s made to. A laissez-faire\r\n      policy is like spoiling a child by saying he\xe2\x80\x99ll turn out all\r\n      right in the end. He will\xe2\x80\x94if he\xe2\x80\x99s made to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe all this Socialist patter you talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Until I talked to you I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought seriously\r\n      about it. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure of half of what I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou puzzle me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the big man, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\xe2\x80\x99re all alike. They\r\n      say Bernard Shaw, in spite of his doctrines, is the most exacting\r\n      of all dramatists about his royalties. To the last farthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amory, \xe2\x80\x9cI simply state that I\xe2\x80\x99m a product of a\r\n      versatile mind in a restless generation\xe2\x80\x94with every reason to\r\n      throw my mind and pen in with the radicals. Even if, deep in my\r\n      heart, I thought we were all blind atoms in a world as limited as\r\n      a stroke of a pendulum, I and my sort would struggle against\r\n      tradition; try, at least, to displace old cants with new ones.\r\n      I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought I was right about life at various times, but faith\r\n      is difficult. One thing I know. If living isn\xe2\x80\x99t a seeking for the\r\n      grail it may be a damned amusing game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      For a minute neither spoke and then the big man asked:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was your university?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPrinceton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The big man became suddenly interested; the expression of his\r\n      goggles altered slightly.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI sent my son to Princeton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDid you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you knew him. His name was Jesse Ferrenby. He was killed\r\n      last year in France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI knew him very well. In fact, he was one of my particular\r\n      friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe was\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94quite a fine boy. We were very close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory began to perceive a resemblance between the father and the\r\n      dead son and he told himself that there had been all along a\r\n      sense of familiarity. Jesse Ferrenby, the man who in college had\r\n      borne off the crown that he had aspired to. It was all so far\r\n      away. What little boys they had been, working for blue ribbons\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      The car slowed up at the entrance to a great estate, ringed\r\n      around by a huge hedge and a tall iron fence.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come in for lunch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Amory shook his head.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mr. Ferrenby, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The big man held out his hand. Amory saw that the fact that he\r\n      had known Jesse more than outweighed any disfavor he had created\r\n      by his opinions. What ghosts were people with which to work! Even\r\n      the little man insisted on shaking hands.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mr. Ferrenby, as the car turned the corner and\r\n      started up the drive. \xe2\x80\x9cGood luck to you and bad luck to your\r\n      theories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSame to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Amory, smiling and waving his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOUT OF THE FIRE, OUT OF THE LITTLE ROOM\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Eight hours from Princeton Amory sat down by the Jersey roadside\r\n      and looked at the frost-bitten country. Nature as a rather coarse\r\n      phenomenon composed largely of flowers that, when closely\r\n      inspected, appeared moth-eaten, and of ants that endlessly\r\n      traversed blades of grass, was always disillusioning; nature\r\n      represented by skies and waters and far horizons was more\r\n      likable. Frost and the promise of winter thrilled him now, made\r\n      him think of a wild battle between St. Regis and Groton, ages\r\n      ago, seven years ago\xe2\x80\x94and of an autumn day in France twelve months\r\n      before when he had lain in tall grass, his platoon flattened down\r\n      close around him, waiting to tap the shoulders of a Lewis gunner.\r\n      He saw the two pictures together with somewhat the same primitive\r\n      exaltation\xe2\x80\x94two games he had played, differing in quality of\r\n      acerbity, linked in a way that differed them from Rosalind or the\r\n      subject of labyrinths which were, after all, the business of\r\n      life.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI am selfish,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a quality that will change when I \xe2\x80\x98see human\r\n      suffering\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98lose my parents\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98help others.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThis selfishness is not only part of me. It is the most living\r\n      part.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is by somehow transcending rather than by avoiding that\r\n      selfishness that I can bring poise and balance into my life.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no virtue of unselfishness that I cannot use. I can\r\n      make sacrifices, be charitable, give to a friend, endure for a\r\n      friend, lay down my life for a friend\xe2\x80\x94all because these things\r\n      may be the best possible expression of myself; yet I have not one\r\n      drop of the milk of human kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The problem of evil had solidified for Amory into the problem of\r\n      sex. He was beginning to identify evil with the strong phallic\r\n      worship in Brooke and the early Wells. Inseparably linked with\r\n      evil was beauty\xe2\x80\x94beauty, still a constant rising tumult; soft in\r\n      Eleanor\xe2\x80\x99s voice, in an old song at night, rioting deliriously\r\n      through life like superimposed waterfalls, half rhythm, half\r\n      darkness. Amory knew that every time he had reached toward it\r\n      longingly it had leered out at him with the grotesque face of\r\n      evil. Beauty of great art, beauty of all joy, most of all the\r\n      beauty of women.\r\n\r\n      After all, it had too many associations with license and\r\n      indulgence. Weak things were often beautiful, weak things were\r\n      never good. And in this new loneness of his that had been\r\n      selected for what greatness he might achieve, beauty must be\r\n      relative or, itself a harmony, it would make only a discord.\r\n\r\n      In a sense this gradual renunciation of beauty was the second\r\n      step after his disillusion had been made complete. He felt that\r\n      he was leaving behind him his chance of being a certain type of\r\n      artist. It seemed so much more important to be a certain sort of\r\n      man.\r\n\r\n      His mind turned a corner suddenly and he found himself thinking\r\n      of the Catholic Church. The idea was strong in him that there was\r\n      a certain intrinsic lack in those to whom orthodox religion was\r\n      necessary, and religion to Amory meant the Church of Rome. Quite\r\n      conceivably it was an empty ritual but it was seemingly the only\r\n      assimilative, traditionary bulwark against the decay of morals.\r\n      Until the great mobs could be educated into a moral sense some\r\n      one must cry: \xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt not!\xe2\x80\x9d Yet any acceptance was, for the\r\n      present, impossible. He wanted time and the absence of ulterior\r\n      pressure. He wanted to keep the tree without ornaments, realize\r\n      fully the direction and momentum of this new start.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The afternoon waned from the purging good of three o\xe2\x80\x99clock to the\r\n      golden beauty of four. Afterward he walked through the dull ache\r\n      of a setting sun when even the clouds seemed bleeding and at\r\n      twilight he came to a graveyard. There was a dusky, dreamy smell\r\n      of flowers and the ghost of a new moon in the sky and shadows\r\n      everywhere. On an impulse he considered trying to open the door\r\n      of a rusty iron vault built into the side of a hill; a vault\r\n      washed clean and covered with late-blooming, weepy watery-blue\r\n      flowers that might have grown from dead eyes, sticky to the touch\r\n      with a sickening odor.\r\n\r\n      Amory wanted to feel \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam Dayfield, 1864.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He wondered that graves ever made people consider life in vain.\r\n      Somehow he could find nothing hopeless in having lived. All the\r\n      broken columns and clasped hands and doves and angels meant\r\n      romances. He fancied that in a hundred years he would like having\r\n      young people speculate as to whether his eyes were brown or blue,\r\n      and he hoped quite passionately that his grave would have about\r\n      it an air of many, many years ago. It seemed strange that out of\r\n      a row of Union soldiers two or three made him think of dead loves\r\n      and dead lovers, when they were exactly like the rest, even to\r\n      the yellowish moss.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Long after midnight the towers and spires of Princeton were\r\n      visible, with here and there a late-burning light\xe2\x80\x94and suddenly\r\n      out of the clear darkness the sound of bells. As an endless dream\r\n      it went on; the spirit of the past brooding over a new\r\n      generation, the chosen youth from the muddled, unchastened world,\r\n      still fed romantically on the mistakes and half-forgotten dreams\r\n      of dead statesmen and poets. Here was a new generation, shouting\r\n      the old cries, learning the old creeds, through a revery of long\r\n      days and nights; destined finally to go out into that dirty gray\r\n      turmoil to follow love and pride; a new generation dedicated more\r\n      than the last to the fear of poverty and the worship of success;\r\n      grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in\r\n      man shaken....\r\n\r\n      Amory, sorry for them, was still not sorry for himself\xe2\x80\x94art,\r\n      politics, religion, whatever his medium should be, he knew he was\r\n      safe now, free from all hysteria\xe2\x80\x94he could accept what was\r\n      acceptable, roam, grow, rebel, sleep deep through many nights....\r\n\r\n      There was no God in his heart, he knew; his ideas were still in\r\n      riot; there was ever the pain of memory; the regret for his lost\r\n      youth\xe2\x80\x94yet the waters of disillusion had left a deposit on his\r\n      soul, responsibility and a love of life, the faint stirring of\r\n      old ambitions and unrealized dreams. But\xe2\x80\x94oh, Rosalind!\r\n      Rosalind!...\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all a poor substitute at best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly.\r\n\r\n      And he could not tell why the struggle was worth while, why he\r\n      had determined to use to the utmost himself and his heritage from\r\n      the personalities he had passed....\r\n\r\n      He stretched out his arms to the crystalline, radiant sky.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI know myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Appendix: Production notes for eBook edition 11\r\n\r\n        The primary feature of edition 11 is restoration of em-dashes\r\n        which are missing from edition 10. (My favorite instance is \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n        won\xe2\x80\x99t belong\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be\xe2\x80\x94long\xe2\x80\x9d.)\r\n\r\n        Characters which are 8-bit in the printed text were\r\n        misrepresented in edition 10. Edition 10 had some\r\n        end-of-paragraph problems. A handful of other minor errors are\r\n        corrected.\r\n\r\n        Two volumes served as reference for edition 11: a 1960 reprint,\r\n        and an undated reprint produced sometime after 1948. There are\r\n        a number of differences between the volumes. Evidence suggests\r\n        that the 1960 reprint has been somewhat \xe2\x80\x9cmodernized\xe2\x80\x9d, and that\r\n        the undated reprint is a better match for the original 1920\r\n        printing. Therefore, when the volumes differ, edition 11 more\r\n        closely follows the undated reprint.\r\n\r\n        In edition 11, underscores are used to denote words and phrases\r\n        italicized for emphasis.\r\n\r\n        There is a section of text in book 2, chapter 3, beginning with\r\n        \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Vanity kissed Vanity,\xe2\x80\x9d which is referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cpoetry\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n        but is formatted as prose.\r\n\r\n        I considered, but decided against introducing an 8-bit version\r\n        of edition 11, in large part because the bulk of the 8-bit\r\n        usage (as found in the 1960 reprint) consists of words commonly\r\n        used in their 7-bit form:\r\n\r\n  Aeschylus  blase  cafe  debut  debutante  elan  elite  Encyclopaedia\r\n  matinee  minutiae  paean  regime  soupcon  unaesthetic\r\n\r\n        Less-commonly-used 8-bit word forms in this book include:\r\n\r\n  anaemic  bleme  coeur  manoeuvered  mediaevalist  tete-a-tete and the\r\n  name \xe2\x80\x9cBorge\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s This Side of Paradise, by F.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
