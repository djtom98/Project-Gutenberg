Irony was the final polish of the shoe, the\r\nultimate dab of the clothes-brush, a sort of intellectual "There!"--yet\r\nat the brink of this story he has as yet gone no further than the\r\nconscious stage. As you first see him he wonders frequently whether he\r\nis not without honor and slightly mad, a shameful and obscene thinness\r\nglistening on the surface of the world like oil on a clean pond, these\r\noccasions being varied, of course, with those in which he thinks himself\r\nrather an exceptional young man, thoroughly sophisticated, well adjusted\r\nto his environment, and somewhat more significant than any one else\r\nhe knows.\r\n\r\nThis was his healthy state and it made him cheerful, pleasant, and very\r\nattractive to intelligent men and to all women. In this state he\r\nconsidered that he would one day accomplish some quiet subtle thing that\r\nthe elect would deem worthy and, passing on, would join the dimmer stars\r\nin a nebulous, indeterminate heaven half-way between death and\r\nimmortality. Until the time came for this effort he would be Anthony\r\nPatch--not a portrait of a man but a distinct and dynamic personality,\r\nopinionated, contemptuous, functioning from within outward--a man who\r\nwas aware that there could be no honor and yet had honor, who knew the\r\nsophistry of courage and yet was brave.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORTHY MAN AND HIS GIFTED SON\r\n\r\nAnthony drew as much consciousness of social security from being the\r\ngrandson of Adam J. Patch as he would have had from tracing his line\r\nover the sea to the crusaders. This is inevitable; Virginians and\r\nBostonians to the contrary notwithstanding, an aristocracy founded\r\nsheerly on money postulates wealth in the particular.\r\n\r\nNow Adam J. Patch, more familiarly known as "Cross Patch," left his\r\nfather\'s farm in Tarrytown early in sixty-one to join a New York cavalry\r\nregiment. He came home from the war a major, charged into Wall Street,\r\nand amid much fuss, fume, applause, and ill will he gathered to himself\r\nsome seventy-five million dollars.\r\n\r\nThis occupied his energies until he was fifty-seven years old. It was\r\nthen that he determined, after a severe attack of sclerosis, to\r\nconsecrate the remainder of his life to the moral regeneration of the\r\nworld. He became a reformer among reformers. Emulating the magnificent\r\nefforts of Anthony Comstock, after whom his grandson was named, he\r\nlevelled a varied assortment of uppercuts and body-blows at liquor,\r\nliterature, vice, art, patent medicines, and Sunday theatres. His mind,\r\nunder the influence of that insidious mildew which eventually forms on\r\nall but the few, gave itself up furiously to every indignation of the\r\nage. From an armchair in the office of his Tarrytown estate he directed\r\nagainst the enormous hypothetical enemy, unrighteousness, a campaign\r\nwhich went on through fifteen years, during which he displayed himself a\r\nrabid monomaniac, an unqualified nuisance, and an intolerable bore. The\r\nyear in which this story opens found him wearying; his campaign had\r\ngrown desultory; 1861 was creeping up slowly on 1895; his thoughts ran a\r\ngreat deal on the Civil War, somewhat on his dead wife and son, almost\r\ninfinitesimally on his grandson Anthony.\r\n\r\nEarly in his career Adam Patch had married an anemic lady of thirty,\r\nAlicia Withers, who brought him one hundred thousand dollars and an\r\nimpeccable entre into the banking circles of New York. Immediately and\r\nrather spunkily she had borne him a son and, as if completely\r\ndevitalized by the magnificence of this performance, she had thenceforth\r\neffaced herself within the shadowy dimensions of the nursery. The boy,\r\nAdam Ulysses Patch, became an inveterate joiner of clubs, connoisseur of\r\ngood form, and driver of tandems--at the astonishing age of twenty-six\r\nhe began his memoirs under the title "New York Society as I Have Seen\r\nIt." On the rumor of its conception this work was eagerly bid for among\r\npublishers, but as it proved after his death to be immoderately verbose\r\nand overpoweringly dull, it never obtained even a private printing.\r\n\r\nThis Fifth Avenue Chesterfield married at twenty-two. His wife was\r\nHenrietta Lebrune, the Boston "Society Contralto," and the single child\r\nof the union was, at the request of his grandfather, christened Anthony\r\nComstock Patch. When he went to Harvard, the Comstock dropped out of his\r\nname to a nether hell of oblivion and was never heard of thereafter.\r\n\r\nYoung Anthony had one picture of his father and mother together--so\r\noften had it faced his eyes in childhood that it had acquired the\r\nimpersonality of furniture, but every one who came into his bedroom\r\nregarded it with interest. It showed a dandy of the nineties, spare and\r\nhandsome, standing beside a tall dark lady with a muff and the\r\nsuggestion of a bustle. Between them was a little boy with long brown\r\ncurls, dressed in a velvet Lord Fauntleroy suit. This was Anthony at\r\nfive, the year of his mother\'s death.\r\n\r\nHis memories of the Boston Society Contralto were nebulous and musical.\r\nShe was a lady who sang, sang, sang, in the music room of their house on\r\nWashington Square--sometimes with guests scattered all about her, the\r\nmen with their arms folded, balanced breathlessly on the edges of sofas,\r\nthe women with their hands in their laps, occasionally making little\r\nwhispers to the men and always clapping very briskly and uttering cooing\r\ncries after each song--and often she sang to Anthony alone, in Italian\r\nor French or in a strange and terrible dialect which she imagined to be\r\nthe speech of the Southern negro.\r\n\r\nHis recollections of the gallant Ulysses, the first man in America to\r\nroll the lapels of his coat, were much more vivid. After Henrietta\r\nLebrune Patch had "joined another choir," as her widower huskily\r\nremarked from time to time, father and son lived up at grampa\'s in\r\nTarrytown, and Ulysses came daily to Anthony\'s nursery and expelled\r\npleasant, thick-smelling words for sometimes as much as an hour. He was\r\ncontinually promising Anthony hunting trips and fishing trips and\r\nexcursions to Atlantic City, "oh, some time soon now"; but none of them\r\never materialized. One trip they did take; when Anthony was eleven they\r\nwent abroad, to England and Switzerland, and there in the best hotel in\r\nLucerne his father died with much sweating and grunting and crying aloud\r\nfor air. In a panic of despair and terror Anthony was brought back to\r\nAmerica, wedded to a vague melancholy that was to stay beside him\r\nthrough the rest of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAST AND PERSON OF THE HERO\r\n\r\nAt eleven he had a horror of death. Within six impressionable years his\r\nparents had died and his grandmother had faded off almost imperceptibly,\r\nuntil, for the first time since her marriage, her person held for one\r\nday an unquestioned supremacy over her own drawing room. So to Anthony\r\nlife was a struggle against death, that waited at every corner. It was\r\nas a concession to his hypochondriacal imagination that he formed the\r\nhabit of reading in bed--it soothed him. He read until he was tired and\r\noften fell asleep with the lights still on.\r\n\r\nHis favorite diversion until he was fourteen was his stamp collection;\r\nenormous, as nearly exhaustive as a boy\'s could be--his grandfather\r\nconsidered fatuously that it was teaching him geography. So Anthony kept\r\nup a correspondence with a half dozen "Stamp and Coin" companies and it\r\nwas rare that the mail failed to bring him new stamp-books or packages\r\nof glittering approval sheets--there was a mysterious fascination in\r\ntransferring his acquisitions interminably from one book to another. His\r\nstamps were his greatest happiness and he bestowed impatient frowns on\r\nany one who interrupted him at play with them; they devoured his\r\nallowance every month, and he lay awake at night musing untiringly on\r\ntheir variety and many-colored splendor.\r\n\r\nAt sixteen he had lived almost entirely within himself, an inarticulate\r\nboy, thoroughly un-American, and politely bewildered by his\r\ncontemporaries. The two preceding years had been spent in Europe with a\r\nprivate tutor, who persuaded him that Harvard was the thing; it would\r\n"open doors," it would be a tremendous tonic, it would give him\r\ninnumerable self-sacrificing and devoted friends. So he went to\r\nHarvard--there was no other logical thing to be done with him.\r\n\r\nOblivious to the social system, he lived for a while alone and unsought\r\nin a high room in Beck Hall--a slim dark boy of medium height with a shy\r\nsensitive mouth. His allowance was more than liberal. He laid the\r\nfoundations for a library by purchasing from a wandering bibliophile\r\nfirst editions of Swinburne, Meredith, and Hardy, and a yellowed\r\nillegible autograph letter of Keats\'s, finding later that he had been\r\namazingly overcharged. He became an exquisite dandy, amassed a rather\r\npathetic collection of silk pajamas, brocaded dressing-gowns, and\r\nneckties too flamboyant to wear; in this secret finery he would parade\r\nbefore a mirror in his room or lie stretched in satin along his\r\nwindow-seat looking down on the yard and realizing dimly this clamor,\r\nbreathless and immediate, in which it seemed he was never to have\r\na part.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough he found in senior year that he had acquired a position\r\nin his class. He learned that he was looked upon as a rather romantic\r\nfigure, a scholar, a recluse, a tower of erudition. This amused him but\r\nsecretly pleased him--he began going out, at first a little and then a\r\ngreat deal. He made the Pudding. He drank--quietly and in the proper\r\ntradition. It was said of him that had he not come to college so young\r\nhe might have "done extremely well." In 1909, when he graduated, he was\r\nonly twenty years old.\r\n\r\nThen abroad again--to Rome this time, where he dallied with architecture\r\nand painting in turn, took up the violin, and wrote some ghastly Italian\r\nsonnets, supposedly the ruminations of a thirteenth-century monk on the\r\njoys of the contemplative life. It became established among his Harvard\r\nintimates that he was in Rome, and those of them who were abroad that\r\nyear looked him up and discovered with him, on many moonlight\r\nexcursions, much in the city that was older than the Renaissance or\r\nindeed than the republic. Maury Noble, from Philadelphia, for instance,\r\nremained two months, and together they realized the peculiar charm of\r\nLatin women and had a delightful sense of being very young and free in a\r\ncivilization that was very old and free. Not a few acquaintances of his\r\ngrandfather\'s called on him, and had he so desired he might have been\r\n_persona grata_ with the diplomatic set--indeed, he found that his\r\ninclinations tended more and more toward conviviality, but that long\r\nadolescent aloofness and consequent shyness still dictated to\r\nhis conduct.\r\n\r\nHe returned to America in 1912 because of one of his grandfather\'s\r\nsudden illnesses, and after an excessively tiresome talk with the\r\nperpetually convalescent old man he decided to put off until his\r\ngrandfather\'s death the idea of living permanently abroad. After a\r\nprolonged search he took an apartment on Fifty-second Street and to all\r\nappearances settled down.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 Anthony Patch\'s adjustment of himself to the universe was in\r\nprocess of consummation. Physically, he had improved since his\r\nundergraduate days--he was still too thin but his shoulders had widened\r\nand his brunette face had lost the frightened look of his freshman year.\r\nHe was secretly orderly and in person spick and span--his friends\r\ndeclared that they had never seen his hair rumpled. His nose was too\r\nsharp; his mouth was one of those unfortunate mirrors of mood inclined\r\nto droop perceptibly in moments of unhappiness, but his blue eyes were\r\ncharming, whether alert with intelligence or half closed in an\r\nexpression of melancholy humor.\r\n\r\nOne of those men devoid of the symmetry of feature essential to the\r\nAryan ideal, he was yet, here and there, considered handsome--moreover,\r\nhe was very clean, in appearance and in reality, with that especial\r\ncleanness borrowed from beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPROACHLESS APARTMENT\r\n\r\nFifth and Sixth Avenues, it seemed to Anthony, were the uprights of a\r\ngigantic ladder stretching from Washington Square to Central Park.\r\nComing up-town on top of a bus toward Fifty-second Street invariably\r\ngave him the sensation of hoisting himself hand by hand on a series of\r\ntreacherous rungs, and when the bus jolted to a stop at his own rung he\r\nfound something akin to relief as he descended the reckless metal steps\r\nto the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nAfter that, he had but to walk down Fifty-second Street half a block,\r\npass a stodgy family of brownstone houses--and then in a jiffy he was\r\nunder the high ceilings of his great front room. This was entirely\r\nsatisfactory. Here, after all, life began. Here he slept, breakfasted,\r\nread, and entertained.\r\n\r\nThe house itself was of murky material, built in the late nineties; in\r\nresponse to the steadily growing need of small apartments each floor had\r\nbeen thoroughly remodelled and rented individually. Of the four\r\napartments Anthony\'s, on the second floor, was the most desirable.\r\n\r\nThe front room had fine high ceilings and three large windows that\r\nloomed down pleasantly upon Fifty-second Street. In its appointments it\r\nescaped by a safe margin being of any particular period; it escaped\r\nstiffness, stuffiness, bareness, and decadence. It smelt neither of\r\nsmoke nor of incense--it was tall and faintly blue. There was a deep\r\nlounge of the softest brown leather with somnolence drifting about it\r\nlike a haze. There was a high screen of Chinese lacquer chiefly\r\nconcerned with geometrical fishermen and huntsmen in black and gold;\r\nthis made a corner alcove for a voluminous chair guarded by an\r\norange-colored standing lamp. Deep in the fireplace a quartered shield\r\nwas burned to a murky black.\r\n\r\nPassing through the dining-room, which, as Anthony took only breakfast\r\nat home, was merely a magnificent potentiality, and down a comparatively\r\nlong hall, one came to the heart and core of the apartment--Anthony\'s\r\nbedroom and bath.\r\n\r\nBoth of them were immense. Under the ceilings of the former even the\r\ngreat canopied bed seemed of only average size. On the floor an exotic\r\nrug of crimson velvet was soft as fleece on his bare feet. His bathroom,\r\nin contrast to the rather portentous character of his bedroom, was gay,\r\nbright, extremely habitable and even faintly facetious. Framed around\r\nthe walls were photographs of four celebrated thespian beauties of the\r\nday: Julia Sanderson as "The Sunshine Girl," Ina Claire as "The Quaker\r\nGirl," Billie Burke as "The Mind-the-Paint Girl," and Hazel Dawn as "The\r\nPink Lady." Between Billie Burke and Hazel Dawn hung a print\r\nrepresenting a great stretch of snow presided over by a cold and\r\nformidable sun--this, claimed Anthony, symbolized the cold shower.\r\n\r\nThe bathtub, equipped with an ingenious bookholder, was low and large.\r\nBeside it a wall wardrobe bulged with sufficient linen for three men and\r\nwith a generation of neckties. There was no skimpy glorified towel of a\r\ncarpet--instead, a rich rug, like the one in his bedroom a miracle of\r\nsoftness, that seemed almost to massage the wet foot emerging from\r\nthe tub....\r\n\r\nAll in all a room to conjure with--it was easy to see that Anthony\r\ndressed there, arranged his immaculate hair there, in fact did\r\neverything but sleep and eat there. It was his pride, this bathroom. He\r\nfelt that if he had a love he would have hung her picture just facing\r\nthe tub so that, lost in the soothing steamings of the hot water, he\r\nmight lie and look up at her and muse warmly and sensuously on\r\nher beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOR DOES HE SPIN\r\n\r\nThe apartment was kept clean by an English servant with the singularly,\r\nalmost theatrically, appropriate name of Bounds, whose technic was\r\nmarred only by the fact that he wore a soft collar. Had he been entirely\r\nAnthony\'s Bounds this defect would have been summarily remedied, but he\r\nwas also the Bounds of two other gentlemen in the neighborhood. From\r\neight until eleven in the morning he was entirely Anthony\'s. He arrived\r\nwith the mail and cooked breakfast. At nine-thirty he pulled the edge of\r\nAnthony\'s blanket and spoke a few terse words--Anthony never remembered\r\nclearly what they were and rather suspected they were deprecative; then\r\nhe served breakfast on a card-table in the front room, made the bed and,\r\nafter asking with some hostility if there was anything else, withdrew.\r\n\r\nIn the mornings, at least once a week, Anthony went to see his broker.\r\nHis income was slightly under seven thousand a year, the interest on\r\nmoney inherited from his mother. His grandfather, who had never allowed\r\nhis own son to graduate from a very liberal allowance, judged that this\r\nsum was sufficient for young Anthony\'s needs. Every Christmas he sent\r\nhim a five-hundred-dollar bond, which Anthony usually sold, if possible,\r\nas he was always a little, not very, hard up.\r\n\r\nThe visits to his broker varied from semi-social chats to discussions of\r\nthe safety of eight per cent investments, and Anthony always enjoyed\r\nthem. The big trust company building seemed to link him definitely to\r\nthe great fortunes whose solidarity he respected and to assure him that\r\nhe was adequately chaperoned by the hierarchy of finance. From these\r\nhurried men he derived the same sense of safety that he had in\r\ncontemplating his grandfather\'s money--even more, for the latter\r\nappeared, vaguely, a demand loan made by the world to Adam Patch\'s own\r\nmoral righteousness, while this money down-town seemed rather to have\r\nbeen grasped and held by sheer indomitable strengths and tremendous\r\nfeats of will; in addition, it seemed more definitely and\r\nexplicitly--money.\r\n\r\nClosely as Anthony trod on the heels of his income, he considered it to\r\nbe enough. Some golden day, of course, he would have many millions;\r\nmeanwhile he possessed a _raison d\'etre_ in the theoretical creation of\r\nessays on the popes of the Renaissance. This flashes back to the\r\nconversation with his grandfather immediately upon his return from Rome.\r\n\r\nHe had hoped to find his grandfather dead, but had learned by\r\ntelephoning from the pier that Adam Patch was comparatively well\r\nagain--the next day he had concealed his disappointment and gone out to\r\nTarrytown. Five miles from the station his taxicab entered an\r\nelaborately groomed drive that threaded a veritable maze of walls and\r\nwire fences guarding the estate--this, said the public, was because it\r\nwas definitely known that if the Socialists had their way, one of the\r\nfirst men they\'d assassinate would be old Cross Patch.\r\n\r\nAnthony was late and the venerable philanthropist was awaiting him in a\r\nglass-walled sun parlor, where he was glancing through the morning\r\npapers for the second time. His secretary, Edward Shuttleworth--who\r\nbefore his regeneration had been gambler, saloon-keeper, and general\r\nreprobate--ushered Anthony into the room, exhibiting his redeemer and\r\nbenefactor as though he were displaying a treasure of immense value.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands gravely. "I\'m awfully glad to hear you\'re better,"\r\nAnthony said.\r\n\r\nThe senior Patch, with an air of having seen his grandson only last\r\nweek, pulled out his watch.\r\n\r\n"Train late?" he asked mildly.\r\n\r\nIt had irritated him to wait for Anthony. He was under the delusion not\r\nonly that in his youth he had handled his practical affairs with the\r\nutmost scrupulousness, even to keeping every engagement on the dot, but\r\nalso that this was the direct and primary cause of his success.\r\n\r\n"It\'s been late a good deal this month," he remarked with a shade of\r\nmeek accusation in his voice--and then after a long sigh, "Sit down."\r\n\r\nAnthony surveyed his grandfather with that tacit amazement which always\r\nattended the sight. That this feeble, unintelligent old man was\r\npossessed of such power that, yellow journals to the contrary, the men\r\nin the republic whose souls he could not have bought directly or\r\nindirectly would scarcely have populated White Plains, seemed as\r\nimpossible to believe as that he had once been a pink-and-white baby.\r\n\r\nThe span of his seventy-five years had acted as a magic bellows--the\r\nfirst quarter-century had blown him full with life, and the last had\r\nsucked it all back. It had sucked in the cheeks and the chest and the\r\ngirth of arm and leg. It had tyrannously demanded his teeth, one by one,\r\nsuspended his small eyes in dark-bluish sacks, tweeked out his hairs,\r\nchanged him from gray to white in some places, from pink to yellow in\r\nothers--callously transposing his colors like a child trying over a\r\npaintbox. Then through his body and his soul it had attacked his brain.\r\nIt had sent him night-sweats and tears and unfounded dreads. It had\r\nsplit his intense normality into credulity and suspicion. Out of the\r\ncoarse material of his enthusiasm it had cut dozens of meek but petulant\r\nobsessions; his energy was shrunk to the bad temper of a spoiled child,\r\nand for his will to power was substituted a fatuous puerile desire for a\r\nland of harps and canticles on earth.\r\n\r\nThe amenities having been gingerly touched upon, Anthony felt that he\r\nwas expected to outline his intentions--and simultaneously a glimmer in\r\nthe old man\'s eye warned him against broaching, for the present, his\r\ndesire to live abroad. He wished that Shuttleworth would have tact\r\nenough to leave the room--he detested Shuttleworth--but the secretary\r\nhad settled blandly in a rocker and was dividing between the two Patches\r\nthe glances of his faded eyes.\r\n\r\n"Now that you\'re here you ought to _do_ something," said his grandfather\r\nsoftly, "accomplish something."\r\n\r\nAnthony waited for him to speak of "leaving something done when you pass\r\non." Then he made a suggestion:\r\n\r\n"I thought--it seemed to me that perhaps I\'m best qualified to write--"\r\n\r\nAdam Patch winced, visualizing a family poet with a long hair and three\r\nmistresses.\r\n\r\n"--history," finished Anthony.\r\n\r\n"History? History of what? The Civil War? The Revolution?"\r\n\r\n"Why--no, sir. A history of the Middle Ages." Simultaneously an idea was\r\nborn for a history of the Renaissance popes, written from some novel\r\nangle. Still, he was glad he had said "Middle Ages."\r\n\r\n"Middle Ages? Why not your own country? Something you know about?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you see I\'ve lived so much abroad--"\r\n\r\n"Why you should write about the Middle Ages, I don\'t know. Dark Ages, we\r\nused to call \'em. Nobody knows what happened, and nobody cares, except\r\nthat they\'re over now." He continued for some minutes on the uselessness\r\nof such information, touching, naturally, on the Spanish Inquisition and\r\nthe "corruption of the monasteries." Then:\r\n\r\n"Do you think you\'ll be able to do any work in New York--or do you\r\nreally intend to work at all?" This last with soft, almost\r\nimperceptible, cynicism.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, I do, sir."\r\n\r\n"When\'ll you be done?"\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'ll be an outline, you see--and a lot of preliminary\r\nreading."\r\n\r\n"I should think you\'d have done enough of that already."\r\n\r\nThe conversation worked itself jerkily toward a rather abrupt\r\nconclusion, when Anthony rose, looked at his watch, and remarked that he\r\nhad an engagement with his broker that afternoon. He had intended to\r\nstay a few days with his grandfather, but he was tired and irritated\r\nfrom a rough crossing, and quite unwilling to stand a subtle and\r\nsanctimonious browbeating. He would come out again in a few days,\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was due to this encounter that work had come into his\r\nlife as a permanent idea. During the year that had passed since then, he\r\nhad made several lists of authorities, he had even experimented with\r\nchapter titles and the division of his work into periods, but not one\r\nline of actual writing existed at present, or seemed likely ever to\r\nexist. He did nothing--and contrary to the most accredited copy-book\r\nlogic, he managed to divert himself with more than average content.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTERNOON\r\n\r\nIt was October in 1913, midway in a week of pleasant days, with the\r\nsunshine loitering in the cross-streets and the atmosphere so languid as\r\nto seem weighted with ghostly falling leaves. It was pleasant to sit\r\nlazily by the open window finishing a chapter of "Erewhon." It was\r\npleasant to yawn about five, toss the book on a table, and saunter\r\nhumming along the hall to his bath.\r\n\r\n"To ... you ... beaut-if-ul lady,"\r\n\r\nhe was singing as he turned on the tap.\r\n\r\n"I raise ... my ... eyes;\r\nTo ... you ... beaut-if-ul la-a-dy\r\nMy ... heart ... cries--"\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice to compete with the flood of water pouring into the\r\ntub, and as he looked at the picture of Hazel Dawn upon the wall he put\r\nan imaginary violin to his shoulder and softly caressed it with a\r\nphantom bow. Through his closed lips he made a humming noise, which he\r\nvaguely imagined resembled the sound of a violin. After a moment his\r\nhands ceased their gyrations and wandered to his shirt, which he began\r\nto unfasten. Stripped, and adopting an athletic posture like the\r\ntiger-skin man in the advertisement, he regarded himself with some\r\nsatisfaction in the mirror, breaking off to dabble a tentative foot in\r\nthe tub. Readjusting a faucet and indulging in a few preliminary grunts,\r\nhe slid in.\r\n\r\nOnce accustomed to the temperature of the water he relaxed into a state\r\nof drowsy content. When he finished his bath he would dress leisurely\r\nand walk down Fifth Avenue to the Ritz, where he had an appointment for\r\ndinner with his two most frequent companions, Dick Caramel and Maury\r\nNoble. Afterward he and Maury were going to the theatre--Caramel would\r\nprobably trot home and work on his book, which ought to be finished\r\npretty soon.\r\n\r\nAnthony was glad _he_ wasn\'t going to work on _his_ book. The notion of\r\nsitting down and conjuring up, not only words in which to clothe\r\nthoughts but thoughts worthy of being clothed--the whole thing was\r\nabsurdly beyond his desires.\r\n\r\nEmerging from his bath he polished himself with the meticulous attention\r\nof a bootblack. Then he wandered into the bedroom, and whistling the\r\nwhile a weird, uncertain melody, strolled here and there buttoning,\r\nadjusting, and enjoying the warmth of the thick carpet on his feet.\r\n\r\nHe lit a cigarette, tossed the match out the open top of the window,\r\nthen paused in his tracks with the cigarette two inches from his\r\nmouth--which fell faintly ajar. His eyes were focussed upon a spot of\r\nbrilliant color on the roof of a house farther down the alley.\r\n\r\nIt was a girl in a red neglige, silk surely, drying her hair by the\r\nstill hot sun of late afternoon. His whistle died upon the stiff air of\r\nthe room; he walked cautiously another step nearer the window with a\r\nsudden impression that she was beautiful. Sitting on the stone parapet\r\nbeside her was a cushion the same color as her garment and she was\r\nleaning both arms upon it as she looked down into the sunny areaway,\r\nwhere Anthony could hear children playing.\r\n\r\nHe watched her for several minutes. Something was stirred in him,\r\nsomething not accounted for by the warm smell of the afternoon or the\r\ntriumphant vividness of red. He felt persistently that the girl was\r\nbeautiful--then of a sudden he understood: it was her distance, not a\r\nrare and precious distance of soul but still distance, if only in\r\nterrestrial yards. The autumn air was between them, and the roofs and\r\nthe blurred voices. Yet for a not altogether explained second, posing\r\nperversely in time, his emotion had been nearer to adoration than in the\r\ndeepest kiss he had ever known.\r\n\r\nHe finished his dressing, found a black bow tie and adjusted it\r\ncarefully by the three-sided mirror in the bathroom. Then yielding to an\r\nimpulse he walked quickly into the bedroom and again looked out the\r\nwindow. The woman was standing up now; she had tossed her hair back and\r\nhe had a full view of her. She was fat, full thirty-five, utterly\r\nundistinguished. Making a clicking noise with his mouth he returned to\r\nthe bathroom and reparted his hair.\r\n\r\n"To ... you ... beaut-if-ul lady,"\r\n\r\nhe sang lightly,\r\n\r\n"I raise ... my ... eyes--"\r\n\r\nThen with a last soothing brush that left an iridescent surface of sheer\r\ngloss he left his bathroom and his apartment and walked down Fifth\r\nAvenue to the Ritz-Carlton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE MEN\r\n\r\nAt seven Anthony and his friend Maury Noble are sitting at a corner\r\ntable on the cool roof. Maury Noble is like nothing so much as a large\r\nslender and imposing cat. His eyes are narrow and full of incessant,\r\nprotracted blinks. His hair is smooth and flat, as though it has been\r\nlicked by a possible--and, if so, Herculean--mother-cat. During\r\nAnthony\'s time at Harvard he had been considered the most unique figure\r\nin his class, the most brilliant, the most original--smart, quiet and\r\namong the saved.\r\n\r\nThis is the man whom Anthony considers his best friend. This is the only\r\nman of all his acquaintance whom he admires and, to a bigger extent than\r\nhe likes to admit to himself, envies.\r\n\r\nThey are glad to see each other now--their eyes are full of kindness as\r\neach feels the full effect of novelty after a short separation. They are\r\ndrawing a relaxation from each other\'s presence, a new serenity; Maury\r\nNoble behind that fine and absurdly catlike face is all but purring. And\r\nAnthony, nervous as a will-o\'-the-wisp, restless--he is at rest now.\r\n\r\nThey are engaged in one of those easy short-speech conversations that\r\nonly men under thirty or men under great stress indulge in.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Seven o\'clock. Where\'s the Caramel? _(Impatiently.)_ I wish\r\nhe\'d finish that interminable novel. I\'ve spent more time hungry----\r\n\r\nMAURY: He\'s got a new name for it. "The Demon Lover "--not bad, eh?\r\n\r\nANTHONY: _(interested)_ "The Demon Lover"? Oh "woman wailing"--No--not a\r\nbit bad! Not bad at all--d\'you think?\r\n\r\nMAURY: Rather good. What time did you say?\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Seven.\r\n\r\nMAURY:_(His eyes narrowing--not unpleasantly, but to express a faint\r\ndisapproval)_ Drove me crazy the other day.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: How?\r\n\r\nMAURY: That habit of taking notes.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Me, too. Seems I\'d said something night before that he\r\nconsidered material but he\'d forgotten it--so he had at me. He\'d say\r\n"Can\'t you try to concentrate?" And I\'d say "You bore me to tears. How\r\ndo I remember?"\r\n\r\n_(MAURY laughs noiselessly, by a sort of bland and appreciative widening\r\nof his features.)_\r\n\r\nMAURY: Dick doesn\'t necessarily see more than any one else. He merely\r\ncan put down a larger proportion of what he sees.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: That rather impressive talent----\r\n\r\nMAURY: Oh, yes. Impressive!\r\n\r\nANTHONY: And energy--ambitious, well-directed energy. He\'s so\r\nentertaining--he\'s so tremendously stimulating and exciting. Often\r\nthere\'s something breathless in being with him.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Oh, yes. _(Silence, and then:)_\r\n\r\nANTHONY: _(With his thin, somewhat uncertain face at its most convinced)\r\n_But not indomitable energy. Some day, bit by bit, it\'ll blow away, and\r\nhis rather impressive talent with it, and leave only a wisp of a man,\r\nfretful and egotistic and garrulous.\r\n\r\nMAURY: _(With laughter)_ Here we sit vowing to each other that little\r\nDick sees less deeply into things than we do. And I\'ll bet he feels a\r\nmeasure of superiority on his side--creative mind over merely critical\r\nmind and all that.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Oh, yes. But he\'s wrong. He\'s inclined to fall for a million\r\nsilly enthusiasms. If it wasn\'t that he\'s absorbed in realism and\r\ntherefore has to adopt the garments of the cynic he\'d be--he\'d be\r\ncredulous as a college religious leader. He\'s an idealist. Oh, yes. He\r\nthinks he\'s not, because he\'s rejected Christianity. Remember him in\r\ncollege? just swallow every writer whole, one after another, ideas,\r\ntechnic, and characters, Chesterton, Shaw, Wells, each one as easily\r\nas the last.\r\n\r\nMAURY:_(Still considering his own last observation)_ I remember.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: It\'s true. Natural born fetich-worshipper. Take art--\r\n\r\nMAURY: Let\'s order. He\'ll be--\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Sure. Let\'s order. I told him--\r\n\r\nMAURY: Here he comes. Look--he\'s going to bump that waiter. _(He lifts\r\nhis finger as a signal--lifts it as though it were a soft and friendly\r\nclaw.)_ Here y\'are, Caramel.\r\n\r\nA NEW VOICE: _(Fiercely)_ Hello, Maury. Hello, Anthony Comstock Patch.\r\nHow is old Adam\'s grandson? Debutantes still after you, eh?\r\n\r\n_In person_ RICHARD CARAMEL _is short and fair--he is to be bald at\r\nthirty-five. He has yellowish eyes--one of them startlingly clear, the\r\nother opaque as a muddy pool--and a bulging brow like a funny-paper\r\nbaby. He bulges in other places--his paunch bulges, prophetically, his\r\nwords have an air of bulging from his mouth, even his dinner coat\r\npockets bulge, as though from contamination, with a dog-eared collection\r\nof time-tables, programmes, and miscellaneous scraps--on these he takes\r\nhis notes with great screwings up of his unmatched yellow eyes and\r\nmotions of silence with his disengaged left hand._\r\n\r\n_When he reaches the table he shakes hands with ANTHONY and MAURY. He is\r\none of those men who invariably shake hands, even with people whom they\r\nhave seen an hour before._\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Hello, Caramel. Glad you\'re here. We needed a comic relief.\r\n\r\nMAURY: You\'re late. Been racing the postman down the block? We\'ve been\r\nclawing over your character.\r\n\r\nDICK: (_Fixing_ ANTHONY _eagerly with the bright eye_) What\'d you say?\r\nTell me and I\'ll write it down. Cut three thousand words out of Part One\r\nthis afternoon.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Noble aesthete. And I poured alcohol into my stomach.\r\n\r\nDICK: I don\'t doubt it. I bet you two have been sitting here for an hour\r\ntalking about liquor.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: We never pass out, my beardless boy.\r\n\r\nMAURY: We never go home with ladies we meet when we\'re lit.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: All in our parties are characterized by a certain haughty\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nDICK: The particularly silly sort who boast about being "tanks"! Trouble\r\nis you\'re both in the eighteenth century. School of the Old English\r\nSquire. Drink quietly until you roll under the table. Never have a good\r\ntime. Oh, no, that isn\'t done at all.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: This from Chapter Six, I\'ll bet.\r\n\r\nDICK: Going to the theatre?\r\n\r\nMAURY: Yes. We intend to spend the evening doing some deep thinking over\r\nof life\'s problems. The thing is tersely called "The Woman." I presume\r\nthat she will "pay."\r\n\r\nANTHONY: My God! Is that what it is? Let\'s go to the Follies again.\r\n\r\nMAURY: I\'m tired of it. I\'ve seen it three times. (_To DICK:_) The first\r\ntime, we went out after Act One and found a most amazing bar. When we\r\ncame back we entered the wrong theatre.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Had a protracted dispute with a scared young couple we thought\r\nwere in our seats.\r\n\r\nDICK: (_As though talking to himself_) I think--that when I\'ve done\r\nanother novel and a play, and maybe a book of short stories, I\'ll do a\r\nmusical comedy.\r\n\r\nMAURY: I know--with intellectual lyrics that no one will listen to. And\r\nall the critics will groan and grunt about "Dear old Pinafore." And I\r\nshall go on shining as a brilliantly meaningless figure in a\r\nmeaningless world.\r\n\r\nDICK: (_Pompously_) Art isn\'t meaningless.\r\n\r\nMAURY: It is in itself. It isn\'t in that it tries to make life less so.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: In other words, Dick, you\'re playing before a grand stand\r\npeopled with ghosts.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Give a good show anyhow.\r\n\r\nANTHONY:(To MAURY) On the contrary, I\'d feel that it being a meaningless\r\nworld, why write? The very attempt to give it purpose is purposeless.\r\n\r\nDICK: Well, even admitting all that, be a decent pragmatist and grant a\r\npoor man the instinct to live. Would you want every one to accept that\r\nsophistic rot?\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Yeah, I suppose so.\r\n\r\nMAURY: No, sir! I believe that every one in America but a selected\r\nthousand should be compelled to accept a very rigid system of\r\nmorals--Roman Catholicism, for instance. I don\'t complain of\r\nconventional morality. I complain rather of the mediocre heretics who\r\nseize upon the findings of sophistication and adopt the pose of a moral\r\nfreedom to which they are by no means entitled by their intelligences.\r\n\r\n(_Here the soup arrives and what MAURY might have gone on to say is lost\r\nfor all time._)\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT\r\n\r\nAfterward they visited a ticket speculator and, at a price, obtained\r\nseats for a new musical comedy called "High Jinks." In the foyer of the\r\ntheatre they waited a few moments to see the first-night crowd come in.\r\nThere were opera cloaks stitched of myriad, many-colored silks and furs;\r\nthere were jewels dripping from arms and throats and ear-tips of white\r\nand rose; there were innumerable broad shimmers down the middles of\r\ninnumerable silk hats; there were shoes of gold and bronze and red and\r\nshining black; there were the high-piled, tight-packed coiffures of many\r\nwomen and the slick, watered hair of well-kept men--most of all there\r\nwas the ebbing, flowing, chattering, chuckling, foaming, slow-rolling\r\nwave effect of this cheerful sea of people as to-night it poured its\r\nglittering torrent into the artificial lake of laughter....\r\n\r\nAfter the play they parted--Maury was going to a dance at Sherry\'s,\r\nAnthony homeward and to bed.\r\n\r\nHe found his way slowly over the jostled evening mass of Times Square,\r\nwhich the chariot race and its thousand satellites made rarely beautiful\r\nand bright and intimate with carnival. Faces swirled about him, a\r\nkaleidoscope of girls, ugly, ugly as sin--too fat, too lean, yet\r\nfloating upon this autumn air as upon their own warm and passionate\r\nbreaths poured out into the night. Here, for all their vulgarity, he\r\nthought, they were faintly and subtly mysterious. He inhaled carefully,\r\nswallowing into his lungs perfume and the not unpleasant scent of many\r\ncigarettes. He caught the glance of a dark young beauty sitting alone in\r\na closed taxicab. Her eyes in the half-light suggested night and\r\nviolets, and for a moment he stirred again to that half-forgotten\r\nremoteness of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nTwo young Jewish men passed him, talking in loud voices and craning\r\ntheir necks here and there in fatuous supercilious glances. They were\r\ndressed in suits of the exaggerated tightness then semi-fashionable;\r\ntheir turned over collars were notched at the Adam\'s apple; they wore\r\ngray spats and carried gray gloves on their cane handles.\r\n\r\nPassed a bewildered old lady borne along like a basket of eggs between\r\ntwo men who exclaimed to her of the wonders of Times Square--explained\r\nthem so quickly that the old lady, trying to be impartially interested,\r\nwaved her head here and there like a piece of wind-worried old\r\norange-peel. Anthony heard a snatch of their conversation:\r\n\r\n"There\'s the Astor, mama!"\r\n\r\n"Look! See the chariot race sign----"\r\n\r\n"There\'s where we were to-day. No, _there!_"\r\n\r\n"Good gracious! ..."\r\n\r\n"You should worry and grow thin like a dime." He recognized the current\r\nwitticism of the year as it issued stridently from one of the pairs at\r\nhis elbow.\r\n\r\n"And I says to him, I says----"\r\n\r\nThe soft rush of taxis by him, and laughter, laughter hoarse as a\r\ncrow\'s, incessant and loud, with the rumble of the subways\r\nunderneath--and over all, the revolutions of light, the growings and\r\nrecedings of light--light dividing like pearls--forming and reforming in\r\nglittering bars and circles and monstrous grotesque figures cut\r\namazingly on the sky.\r\n\r\nHe turned thankfully down the hush that blew like a dark wind out of a\r\ncross-street, passed a bakery-restaurant in whose windows a dozen roast\r\nchickens turned over and over on an automatic spit. From the door came a\r\nsmell that was hot, doughy, and pink. A drug-store next, exhaling\r\nmedicines, spilt soda water and a pleasant undertone from the cosmetic\r\ncounter; then a Chinese laundry, still open, steamy and stifling,\r\nsmelling folded and vaguely yellow. All these depressed him; reaching\r\nSixth Avenue he stopped at a corner cigar store and emerged feeling\r\nbetter--the cigar store was cheerful, humanity in a navy blue mist,\r\nbuying a luxury ....\r\n\r\nOnce in his apartment he smoked a last cigarette, sitting in the dark by\r\nhis open front window. For the first time in over a year he found\r\nhimself thoroughly enjoying New York. There was a rare pungency in it\r\ncertainly, a quality almost Southern. A lonesome town, though. He who\r\nhad grown up alone had lately learned to avoid solitude. During the past\r\nseveral months he had been careful, when he had no engagement for the\r\nevening, to hurry to one of his clubs and find some one. Oh, there was a\r\nloneliness here----\r\n\r\nHis cigarette, its smoke bordering the thin folds of curtain with rims\r\nof faint white spray, glowed on until the clock in St. Anne\'s down the\r\nstreet struck one with a querulous fashionable beauty. The elevated,\r\nhalf a quiet block away, sounded a rumble of drums--and should he lean\r\nfrom his window he would see the train, like an angry eagle, breasting\r\nthe dark curve at the corner. He was reminded of a fantastic romance he\r\nhad lately read in which cities had been bombed from aerial trains, and\r\nfor a moment he fancied that Washington Square had declared war on\r\nCentral Park and that this was a north-bound menace loaded with battle\r\nand sudden death. But as it passed the illusion faded; it diminished to\r\nthe faintest of drums--then to a far-away droning eagle.\r\n\r\nThere were the bells and the continued low blur of auto horns from Fifth\r\nAvenue, but his own street was silent and he was safe in here from all\r\nthe threat of life, for there was his door and the long hall and his\r\nguardian bedroom--safe, safe! The arc-light shining into his window\r\nseemed for this hour like the moon, only brighter and more beautiful\r\nthan the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FLASH-BACK IN PARADISE\r\n\r\n_Beauty, who was born anew every hundred years, sat in a sort of outdoor\r\nwaiting room through which blew gusts of white wind and occasionally a\r\nbreathless hurried star. The stars winked at her intimately as they went\r\nby and the winds made a soft incessant flurry in her hair. She was\r\nincomprehensible, for, in her, soul and spirit were one--the beauty of\r\nher body was the essence of her soul. She was that unity sought for by\r\nphilosophers through many centuries. In this outdoor waiting room of\r\nwinds and stars she had been sitting for a hundred years, at peace in\r\nthe contemplation of herself._\r\n\r\n_It became known to her, at length, that she was to be born again.\r\nSighing, she began a long conversation with a voice that was in the\r\nwhite wind, a conversation that took many hours and of which I can give\r\nonly a fragment here._\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: (_Her lips scarcely stirring, her eyes turned, as always, inward\r\nupon herself_) Whither shall I journey now?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: To a new country--a land you have never seen before.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: (_Petulantly_) I loathe breaking into these new civilizations.\r\nHow long a stay this time?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: Fifteen years.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: And what\'s the name of the place?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: It is the most opulent, most gorgeous land on earth--a land\r\nwhose wisest are but little wiser than its dullest; a land where the\r\nrulers have minds like little children and the law-givers believe in\r\nSanta Claus; where ugly women control strong men----\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: (_In astonishment_) What?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: (_Very much depressed_) Yes, it is truly a melancholy\r\nspectacle. Women with receding chins and shapeless noses go about in\r\nbroad daylight saying "Do this!" and "Do that!" and all the men, even\r\nthose of great wealth, obey implicitly their women to whom they refer\r\nsonorously either as "Mrs. So-and-so" or as "the wife."\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: But this can\'t be true! I can understand, of course, their\r\nobedience to women of charm--but to fat women? to bony women? to women\r\nwith scrawny cheeks?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: Even so.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: What of me? What chance shall I have?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: It will be "harder going," if I may borrow a phrase.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: (_After a dissatisfied pause_) Why not the old lands, the land\r\nof grapes and soft-tongued men or the land of ships and seas?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: It\'s expected that they\'ll be very busy shortly.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: Oh!\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: Your life on earth will be, as always, the interval between\r\ntwo significant glances in a mundane mirror.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: What will I be? Tell me?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: At first it was thought that you would go this time as an\r\nactress in the motion pictures but, after all, it\'s not advisable. You\r\nwill be disguised during your fifteen years as what is called a\r\n"susciety gurl."\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: What\'s that?\r\n\r\n(_There is a new sound in the wind which must for our purposes be\r\ninterpreted as_ THE VOICE _scratching its head._)\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: (_At length_) It\'s a sort of bogus aristocrat.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: Bogus? What is bogus?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: That, too, you will discover in this land. You will find much\r\nthat is bogus. Also, you will do much that is bogus.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: (_Placidly_) It all sounds so vulgar.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: Not half as vulgar as it is. You will be known during your\r\nfifteen years as a ragtime kid, a flapper, a jazz-baby, and a baby vamp.\r\nYou will dance new dances neither more nor less gracefully than you\r\ndanced the old ones.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: (_In a whisper_) Will I be paid?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: Yes, as usual--in love.\r\n\r\nBEAUTY: (_With a faint laugh which disturbs only momentarily the\r\nimmobility of her lips_) And will I like being called a jazz-baby?\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE: (_Soberly_) You will love it....\r\n\r\n(_The dialogue ends here, with_ BEAUTY _still sitting quietly, the stars\r\npausing in an ecstasy of appreciation, the wind, white and gusty,\r\nblowing through her hair._\r\n\r\n_All this took place seven years before_ ANTHONY _sat by the front\r\nwindows of his apartment and listened to the chimes of St. Anne\'s_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF A SIREN\r\n\r\nCrispness folded down upon New York a month later, bringing November and\r\nthe three big football games and a great fluttering of furs along Fifth\r\nAvenue. It brought, also, a sense of tension to the city, and suppressed\r\nexcitement. Every morning now there were invitations in Anthony\'s mail.\r\nThree dozen virtuous females of the first layer were proclaiming their\r\nfitness, if not their specific willingness, to bear children unto three\r\ndozen millionaires. Five dozen virtuous females of the second layer were\r\nproclaiming not only this fitness, but in addition a tremendous\r\nundaunted ambition toward the first three dozen young men, who were of\r\ncourse invited to each of the ninety-six parties--as were the young\r\nlady\'s group of family friends, acquaintances, college boys, and eager\r\nyoung outsiders. To continue, there was a third layer from the skirts of\r\nthe city, from Newark and the Jersey suburbs up to bitter Connecticut\r\nand the ineligible sections of Long Island--and doubtless contiguous\r\nlayers down to the city\'s shoes: Jewesses were coming out into a society\r\nof Jewish men and women, from Riverside to the Bronx, and looking\r\nforward to a rising young broker or jeweller and a kosher wedding; Irish\r\ngirls were casting their eyes, with license at last to do so, upon a\r\nsociety of young Tammany politicians, pious undertakers, and grown-up\r\nchoirboys.\r\n\r\nAnd, naturally, the city caught the contagious air of entre--the working\r\ngirls, poor ugly souls, wrapping soap in the factories and showing\r\nfinery in the big stores, dreamed that perhaps in the spectacular\r\nexcitement of this winter they might obtain for themselves the coveted\r\nmale--as in a muddled carnival crowd an inefficient pickpocket may\r\nconsider his chances increased. And the chimneys commenced to smoke and\r\nthe subway\'s foulness was freshened. And the actresses came out in new\r\nplays and the publishers came out with new books and the Castles came\r\nout with new dances. And the railroads came out with new schedules\r\ncontaining new mistakes instead of the old ones that the commuters had\r\ngrown used to....\r\n\r\nThe City was coming out!\r\n\r\nAnthony, walking along Forty-second Street one afternoon under a\r\nsteel-gray sky, ran unexpectedly into Richard Caramel emerging from the\r\nManhattan Hotel barber shop. It was a cold day, the first definitely\r\ncold day, and Caramel had on one of those knee-length, sheep-lined coats\r\nlong worn by the working men of the Middle West, that were just coming\r\ninto fashionable approval. His soft hat was of a discreet dark brown,\r\nand from under it his clear eye flamed like a topaz. He stopped Anthony\r\nenthusiastically, slapping him on the arms more from a desire to keep\r\nhimself warm than from playfulness, and, after his inevitable hand\r\nshake, exploded into sound.\r\n\r\n"Cold as the devil--Good Lord, I\'ve been working like the deuce all day\r\ntill my room got so cold I thought I\'d get pneumonia. Darn landlady\r\neconomizing on coal came up when I yelled over the stairs for her for\r\nhalf an hour. Began explaining why and all. God! First she drove me\r\ncrazy, then I began to think she was sort of a character, and took notes\r\nwhile she talked--so she couldn\'t see me, you know, just as though I\r\nwere writing casually--"\r\n\r\nHe had seized Anthony\'s arm and walking him briskly up Madison Avenue.\r\n\r\n"Where to?"\r\n\r\n"Nowhere in particular."\r\n\r\n"Well, then what\'s the use?" demanded Anthony.\r\n\r\nThey stopped and stared at each other, and Anthony wondered if the cold\r\nmade his own face as repellent as Dick Caramel\'s, whose nose was\r\ncrimson, whose bulging brow was blue, whose yellow unmatched eyes were\r\nred and watery at the rims. After a moment they began walking again.\r\n\r\n"Done some good work on my novel." Dick was looking and talking\r\nemphatically at the sidewalk. "But I have to get out once in a while."\r\nHe glanced at Anthony apologetically, as though craving encouragement.\r\n\r\n"I have to talk. I guess very few people ever really _think_, I mean sit\r\ndown and ponder and have ideas in sequence. I do my thinking in writing\r\nor conversation. You\'ve got to have a start, sort of--something to\r\ndefend or contradict--don\'t you think?"\r\n\r\nAnthony grunted and withdrew his arm gently.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind carrying you, Dick, but with that coat--"\r\n\r\n"I mean," continued Richard Caramel gravely, "that on paper your first\r\nparagraph contains the idea you\'re going to damn or enlarge on. In\r\nconversation you\'ve got your vis-a-vis\'s last statement--but when you\r\nsimply _ponder_, why, your ideas just succeed each other like\r\nmagic-lantern pictures and each one forces out the last."\r\n\r\nThey passed Forty-fifth Street and slowed down slightly. Both of them\r\nlit cigarettes and blew tremendous clouds of smoke and frosted breath\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s walk up to the Plaza and have an egg-nog," suggested Anthony. "Do\r\nyou good. Air\'ll get the rotten nicotine out of your lungs. Come\r\non--I\'ll let you talk about your book all the way."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to if it bores you. I mean you needn\'t do it as a favor."\r\nThe words tumbled out in haste, and though he tried to keep his face\r\ncasual it screwed up uncertainly. Anthony was compelled to protest:\r\n"Bore me? I should say not!"\r\n\r\n"Got a cousin--" began Dick, but Anthony interrupted by stretching out\r\nhis arms and breathing forth a low cry of exultation.\r\n\r\n"Good weather!" he exclaimed, "isn\'t it? Makes me feel about ten. I mean\r\nit makes me feel as I should have felt when I was ten. Murderous! Oh,\r\nGod! one minute it\'s my world, and the next I\'m the world\'s fool. To-day\r\nit\'s my world and everything\'s easy, easy. Even Nothing is easy!"\r\n\r\n"Got a cousin up at the Plaza. Famous girl. We can go up and meet her.\r\nShe lives there in the winter--has lately anyway--with her mother\r\nand father."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t know you had cousins in New York."\r\n\r\n"Her name\'s Gloria. She\'s from home--Kansas City. Her mother\'s a\r\npractising Bilphist, and her father\'s quite dull but a perfect\r\ngentleman."\r\n\r\n"What are they? Literary material?"\r\n\r\n"They try to be. All the old man does is tell me he just met the most\r\nwonderful character for a novel. Then he tells me about some idiotic\r\nfriend of his and then he says: \'_There_\'s a character for you! Why\r\ndon\'t you write him up? Everybody\'d be interested in _him_.\' Or else he\r\ntells me about Japan or Paris, or some other very obvious place, and\r\nsays: \'Why don\'t you write a story about that place? That\'d be a\r\nwonderful setting for a story!\'"\r\n\r\n"How about the girl?" inquired Anthony casually, "Gloria--Gloria what?"\r\n\r\n"Gilbert. Oh, you\'ve heard of her--Gloria Gilbert. Goes to dances at\r\ncolleges--all that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard her name."\r\n\r\n"Good-looking--in fact damned attractive."\r\n\r\nThey reached Fiftieth Street and turned over toward the Avenue.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for young girls as a rule," said Anthony, frowning.\r\n\r\nThis was not strictly true. While it seemed to him that the average\r\ndebutante spent every hour of her day thinking and talking about what\r\nthe great world had mapped out for her to do during the next hour, any\r\ngirl who made a living directly on her prettiness interested him\r\nenormously.\r\n\r\n"Gloria\'s darn nice--not a brain in her head."\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed in a one-syllabled snort.\r\n\r\n"By that you mean that she hasn\'t a line of literary patter."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Dick, you know what passes as brains in a girl for you. Earnest young\r\nwomen who sit with you in a corner and talk earnestly about life. The\r\nkind who when they were sixteen argued with grave faces as to whether\r\nkissing was right or wrong--and whether it was immoral for freshmen to\r\ndrink beer."\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel was offended. His scowl crinkled like crushed paper.\r\n\r\n"No--" he began, but Anthony interrupted ruthlessly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; kind who just at present sit in corners and confer on the\r\nlatest Scandinavian Dante available in English translation."\r\n\r\nDick turned to him, a curious falling in his whole countenance. His\r\nquestion was almost an appeal.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with you and Maury? You talk sometimes as though I\r\nwere a sort of inferior."\r\n\r\nAnthony was confused, but he was also cold and a little uncomfortable,\r\nso he took refuge in attack.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think your brains matter, Dick."\r\n\r\n"Of course they matter!" exclaimed Dick angrily. "What do you mean? Why\r\ndon\'t they matter?"\r\n\r\n"You might know too much for your pen."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t possibly."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine," insisted Anthony, "a man knowing too much for his\r\ntalent to express. Like me. Suppose, for instance, I have more wisdom\r\nthan you, and less talent. It would tend to make me inarticulate. You,\r\non the contrary, have enough water to fill the pail and a big enough\r\npail to hold the water."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t follow you at all," complained Dick in a crestfallen tone.\r\nInfinitely dismayed, he seemed to bulge in protest. He was staring\r\nintently at Anthony and caroming off a succession of passers-by, who\r\nreproached him with fierce, resentful glances.\r\n\r\n"I simply mean that a talent like Wells\'s could carry the intelligence\r\nof a Spencer. But an inferior talent can only be graceful when it\'s\r\ncarrying inferior ideas. And the more narrowly you can look at a thing\r\nthe more entertaining you can be about it."\r\n\r\nDick considered, unable to decide the exact degree of criticism intended\r\nby Anthony\'s remarks. But Anthony, with that facility which seemed so\r\nfrequently to flow from him, continued, his dark eyes gleaming in his\r\nthin face, his chin raised, his voice raised, his whole physical\r\nbeing raised:\r\n\r\n"Say I am proud and sane and wise--an Athenian among Greeks. Well, I\r\nmight fail where a lesser man would succeed. He could imitate, he could\r\nadorn, he could be enthusiastic, he could be hopefully constructive. But\r\nthis hypothetical me would be too proud to imitate, too sane to be\r\nenthusiastic, too sophisticated to be Utopian, too Grecian to adorn."\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t think the artist works from his intelligence?"\r\n\r\n"No. He goes on improving, if he can, what he imitates in the way of\r\nstyle, and choosing from his own interpretation of the things around him\r\nwhat constitutes material. But after all every writer writes because\r\nit\'s his mode of living. Don\'t tell me you like this \'Divine Function of\r\nthe Artist\' business?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not accustomed even to refer to myself as an artist."\r\n\r\n"Dick," said Anthony, changing his tone, "I want to beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"For that outburst. I\'m honestly sorry. I was talking for effect."\r\n\r\nSomewhat mollified, Dick rejoined:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve often said you were a Philistine at heart."\r\n\r\nIt was a crackling dusk when they turned in under the white facade of\r\nthe Plaza and tasted slowly the foam and yellow thickness of an egg-nog.\r\nAnthony looked at his companion. Richard Caramel\'s nose and brow were\r\nslowly approaching a like pigmentation; the red was leaving the one, the\r\nblue deserting the other. Glancing in a mirror, Anthony was glad to find\r\nthat his own skin had not discolored. On the contrary, a faint glow had\r\nkindled in his cheeks--he fancied that he had never looked so well.\r\n\r\n"Enough for me," said Dick, his tone that of an athlete in training. "I\r\nwant to go up and see the Gilberts. Won\'t you come?"\r\n\r\n"Why--yes. If you don\'t dedicate me to the parents and dash off in the\r\ncorner with Dora."\r\n\r\n"Not Dora--Gloria."\r\n\r\nA clerk announced them over the phone, and ascending to the tenth floor\r\nthey followed a winding corridor and knocked at 1088. The door was\r\nanswered by a middle-aged lady--Mrs. Gilbert herself.\r\n\r\n"How do you do?" She spoke in the conventional American lady-lady\r\nlanguage. "Well, I\'m _aw_fully glad to see you--"\r\n\r\nHasty interjections by Dick, and then:\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pats? Well, do come in, and leave your coat there." She pointed to\r\na chair and changed her inflection to a deprecatory laugh full of minute\r\ngasps. "This is really lovely--lovely. Why, Richard, you haven\'t been\r\nhere for _so_ long--no!--no!" The latter monosyllables served half as\r\nresponses, half as periods, to some vague starts from Dick. "Well, do\r\nsit down and tell me what you\'ve been doing."\r\n\r\nOne crossed and recrossed; one stood and bowed ever so gently; one\r\nsmiled again and again with helpless stupidity; one wondered if she\r\nwould ever sit down at length one slid thankfully into a chair and\r\nsettled for a pleasant call.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s because you\'ve been busy--as much as anything else,"\r\nsmiled Mrs. Gilbert somewhat ambiguously. The "as much as anything else"\r\nshe used to balance all her more rickety sentences. She had two other\r\nones: "at least that\'s the way I look at it" and "pure and\r\nsimple"--these three, alternated, gave each of her remarks an air of\r\nbeing a general reflection on life, as though she had calculated all\r\ncauses and, at length, put her finger on the ultimate one.\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel\'s face, Anthony saw, was now quite normal. The brow and\r\ncheeks were of a flesh color, the nose politely inconspicuous. He had\r\nfixed his aunt with the bright-yellow eye, giving her that acute and\r\nexaggerated attention that young males are accustomed to render to all\r\nfemales who are of no further value.\r\n\r\n"Are you a writer too, Mr. Pats? ... Well, perhaps we can all bask in\r\nRichard\'s fame."--Gentle laughter led by Mrs. Gilbert.\r\n\r\n"Gloria\'s out," she said, with an air of laying down an axiom from which\r\nshe would proceed to derive results. "She\'s dancing somewhere. Gloria\r\ngoes, goes, goes. I tell her I don\'t see how she stands it. She dances\r\nall afternoon and all night, until I think she\'s going to wear herself\r\nto a shadow. Her father is very worried about her."\r\n\r\nShe smiled from one to the other. They both smiled.\r\n\r\nShe was composed, Anthony perceived, of a succession of semicircles and\r\nparabolas, like those figures that gifted folk make on the typewriter:\r\nhead, arms, bust, hips, thighs, and ankles were in a bewildering tier of\r\nroundnesses. Well ordered and clean she was, with hair of an\r\nartificially rich gray; her large face sheltered weather-beaten blue\r\neyes and was adorned with just the faintest white mustache.\r\n\r\n"I always say," she remarked to Anthony, "that Richard is an ancient\r\nsoul."\r\n\r\nIn the tense pause that followed, Anthony considered a pun--something\r\nabout Dick having been much walked upon.\r\n\r\n"We all have souls of different ages," continued Mrs. Gilbert radiantly;\r\n"at least that\'s what I say."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so," agreed Anthony with an air of quickening to a hopeful\r\nidea. The voice bubbled on:\r\n\r\n"Gloria has a very young soul--irresponsible, as much as anything else.\r\nShe has no sense of responsibility."\r\n\r\n"She\'s sparkling, Aunt Catherine," said Richard pleasantly. "A sense of\r\nresponsibility would spoil her. She\'s too pretty."\r\n\r\n"Well," confessed Mrs. Gilbert, "all I know is that she goes and goes\r\nand goes--"\r\n\r\nThe number of goings to Gloria\'s discredit was lost in the rattle of the\r\ndoor-knob as it turned to admit Mr. Gilbert.\r\n\r\nHe was a short man with a mustache resting like a small white cloud\r\nbeneath his undistinguished nose. He had reached the stage where his\r\nvalue as a social creature was a black and imponderable negative. His\r\nideas were the popular delusions of twenty years before; his mind\r\nsteered a wabbly and anaemic course in the wake of the daily newspaper\r\neditorials. After graduating from a small but terrifying Western\r\nuniversity, he had entered the celluloid business, and as this required\r\nonly the minute measure of intelligence he brought to it, he did well\r\nfor several years--in fact until about 1911, when he began exchanging\r\ncontracts for vague agreements with the moving picture industry. The\r\nmoving picture industry had decided about 1912 to gobble him up, and at\r\nthis time he was, so to speak, delicately balanced on its tongue.\r\nMeanwhile he was supervising manager of the Associated Mid-western Film\r\nMaterials Company, spending six months of each year in New York and the\r\nremainder in Kansas City and St. Louis. He felt credulously that there\r\nwas a good thing coming to him--and his wife thought so, and his\r\ndaughter thought so too.\r\n\r\nHe disapproved of Gloria: she stayed out late, she never ate her meals,\r\nshe was always in a mix-up--he had irritated her once and she had used\r\ntoward him words that he had not thought were part of her vocabulary.\r\nHis wife was easier. After fifteen years of incessant guerilla warfare\r\nhe had conquered her--it was a war of muddled optimism against organized\r\ndulness, and something in the number of "yes\'s" with which he could\r\npoison a conversation had won him the victory.\r\n\r\n"Yes-yes-yes-yes," he would say, "yes-yes-yes-yes. Let me see. That was\r\nthe summer of--let me see--ninety-one or ninety-two--Yes-yes-yes-yes----"\r\n\r\nFifteen years of yes\'s had beaten Mrs. Gilbert. Fifteen further years of\r\nthat incessant unaffirmative affirmative, accompanied by the perpetual\r\nflicking of ash-mushrooms from thirty-two thousand cigars, had broken\r\nher. To this husband of hers she made the last concession of married\r\nlife, which is more complete, more irrevocable, than the first--she\r\nlistened to him. She told herself that the years had brought her\r\ntolerance--actually they had slain what measure she had ever possessed\r\nof moral courage.\r\n\r\nShe introduced him to Anthony.\r\n\r\n"This is Mr. Pats," she said.\r\n\r\nThe young man and the old touched flesh; Mr. Gilbert\'s hand was soft,\r\nworn away to the pulpy semblance of a squeezed grapefruit. Then husband\r\nand wife exchanged greetings--he told her it had grown colder out; he\r\nsaid he had walked down to a news-stand on Forty-fourth Street for a\r\nKansas City paper. He had intended to ride back in the bus but he had\r\nfound it too cold, yes, yes, yes, yes, too cold.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilbert added flavor to his adventure by being impressed with his\r\ncourage in braving the harsh air.\r\n\r\n"Well, you _are_ spunky!" she exclaimed admiringly. "You _are_ spunky. I\r\nwouldn\'t have gone out for anything."\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert with true masculine impassivity disregarded the awe he had\r\nexcited in his wife. He turned to the two young men and triumphantly\r\nrouted them on the subject of the weather. Richard Caramel was called on\r\nto remember the month of November in Kansas. No sooner had the theme\r\nbeen pushed toward him, however, than it was violently fished back to be\r\nlingered over, pawed over, elongated, and generally devitalized by\r\nits sponsor.\r\n\r\nThe immemorial thesis that the days somewhere were warm but the nights\r\nvery pleasant was successfully propounded and they decided the exact\r\ndistance on an obscure railroad between two points that Dick had\r\ninadvertently mentioned. Anthony fixed Mr. Gilbert with a steady stare\r\nand went into a trance through which, after a moment, Mrs. Gilbert\'s\r\nsmiling voice penetrated:\r\n\r\n"It seems as though the cold were damper here--it seems to eat into my\r\nbones."\r\n\r\nAs this remark, adequately yessed, had been on the tip of Mr. Gilbert\'s\r\ntongue, he could not be blamed for rather abruptly changing the subject.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Gloria?"\r\n\r\n"She ought to be here any minute."\r\n\r\n"Have you met my daughter, Mr.----?"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t had the pleasure. I\'ve heard Dick speak of her often."\r\n\r\n"She and Richard are cousins."\r\n\r\n"Yes?" Anthony smiled with some effort. He was not used to the society\r\nof his seniors, and his mouth was stiff from superfluous cheerfulness.\r\nIt was such a pleasant thought about Gloria and Dick being cousins. He\r\nmanaged within the next minute to throw an agonized glance at\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel was afraid they\'d have to toddle off.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilbert was tremendously sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert thought it was too bad.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilbert had a further idea--something about being glad they\'d come,\r\nanyhow, even if they\'d only seen an old lady \'way too old to flirt with\r\nthem. Anthony and Dick evidently considered this a sly sally, for they\r\nlaughed one bar in three-four time.\r\n\r\nWould they come again soon?\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\nGloria would be _aw_fully sorry!\r\n\r\n"Good-by----"\r\n\r\n"Good-by----"\r\n\r\nSmiles!\r\n\r\nSmiles!\r\n\r\nBang!\r\n\r\nTwo disconsolate young men walking down the tenth-floor corridor of the\r\nPlaza in the direction of the elevator.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LADY\'S LEGS\r\n\r\nBehind Maury Noble\'s attractive indolence, his irrelevance and his easy\r\nmockery, lay a surprising and relentless maturity of purpose. His\r\nintention, as he stated it in college, had been to use three years in\r\ntravel, three years in utter leisure--and then to become immensely rich\r\nas quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nHis three years of travel were over. He had accomplished the globe with\r\nan intensity and curiosity that in any one else would have seemed\r\npedantic, without redeeming spontaneity, almost the self-editing of a\r\nhuman Baedeker; but, in this case, it assumed an air of mysterious\r\npurpose and significant design--as though Maury Noble were some\r\npredestined anti-Christ, urged by a preordination to go everywhere there\r\nwas to go along the earth and to see all the billions of humans who bred\r\nand wept and slew each other here and there upon it.\r\n\r\nBack in America, he was sallying into the search for amusement with the\r\nsame consistent absorption. He who had never taken more than a few\r\ncocktails or a pint of wine at a sitting, taught himself to drink as he\r\nwould have taught himself Greek--like Greek it would be the gateway to a\r\nwealth of new sensations, new psychic states, new reactions in joy\r\nor misery.\r\n\r\nHis habits were a matter for esoteric speculation. He had three rooms in\r\na bachelor apartment on Forty-forth street, but he was seldom to be\r\nfound there. The telephone girl had received the most positive\r\ninstructions that no one should even have his ear without first giving a\r\nname to be passed upon. She had a list of half a dozen people to whom he\r\nwas never at home, and of the same number to whom he was always at home.\r\nForemost on the latter list were Anthony Patch and Richard Caramel.\r\n\r\nMaury\'s mother lived with her married son in Philadelphia, and there\r\nMaury went usually for the week-ends, so one Saturday night when\r\nAnthony, prowling the chilly streets in a fit of utter boredom, dropped\r\nin at the Molton Arms he was overjoyed to find that Mr. Noble was\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nHis spirits soared faster than the flying elevator. This was so good, so\r\nextremely good, to be about to talk to Maury--who would be equally happy\r\nat seeing him. They would look at each other with a deep affection just\r\nbehind their eyes which both would conceal beneath some attenuated\r\nraillery. Had it been summer they would have gone out together and\r\nindolently sipped two long Tom Collinses, as they wilted their collars\r\nand watched the faintly diverting round of some lazy August cabaret. But\r\nit was cold outside, with wind around the edges of the tall buildings\r\nand December just up the street, so better far an evening together under\r\nthe soft lamplight and a drink or two of Bushmill\'s, or a thimbleful of\r\nMaury\'s Grand Marnier, with the books gleaming like ornaments against\r\nthe walls, and Maury radiating a divine inertia as he rested, large and\r\ncatlike, in his favorite chair.\r\n\r\nThere he was! The room closed about Anthony, warmed him. The glow of\r\nthat strong persuasive mind, that temperament almost Oriental in its\r\noutward impassivity, warmed Anthony\'s restless soul and brought him a\r\npeace that could be likened only to the peace a stupid woman gives. One\r\nmust understand all--else one must take all for granted. Maury filled\r\nthe room, tigerlike, godlike. The winds outside were stilled; the brass\r\ncandlesticks on the mantel glowed like tapers before an altar.\r\n\r\n"What keeps you here to-day?" Anthony spread himself over a yielding\r\nsofa and made an elbow-rest among the pillows.\r\n\r\n"Just been here an hour. Tea dance--and I stayed so late I missed my\r\ntrain to Philadelphia."\r\n\r\n"Strange to stay so long," commented Anthony curiously.\r\n\r\n"Rather. What\'d you do?"\r\n\r\n"Geraldine. Little usher at Keith\'s. I told you about her."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"Paid me a call about three and stayed till five. Peculiar little\r\nsoul--she gets me. She\'s so utterly stupid."\r\n\r\nMaury was silent.\r\n\r\n"Strange as it may seem," continued Anthony, "so far as I\'m concerned,\r\nand even so far as I know, Geraldine is a paragon of virtue."\r\n\r\nHe had known her a month, a girl of nondescript and nomadic habits.\r\nSomeone had casually passed her on to Anthony, who considered her\r\namusing and rather liked the chaste and fairylike kisses she had given\r\nhim on the third night of their acquaintance, when they had driven in a\r\ntaxi through the Park. She had a vague family--a shadowy aunt and uncle\r\nwho shared with her an apartment in the labyrinthine hundreds. She was\r\ncompany, familiar and faintly intimate and restful. Further than that he\r\ndid not care to experiment--not from any moral compunction, but from a\r\ndread of allowing any entanglement to disturb what he felt was the\r\ngrowing serenity of his life.\r\n\r\n"She has two stunts," he informed Maury; "one of them is to get her hair\r\nover her eyes some way and then blow it out, and the other is to say\r\n\'You cra-a-azy!\' when some one makes a remark that\'s over her head. It\r\nfascinates me. I sit there hour after hour, completely intrigued by the\r\nmaniacal symptoms she finds in my imagination."\r\n\r\nMaury stirred in his chair and spoke.\r\n\r\n"Remarkable that a person can comprehend so little and yet live in such\r\na complex civilization. A woman like that actually takes the whole\r\nuniverse in the most matter-of-fact way. From the influence of Rousseau\r\nto the bearing of the tariff rates on her dinner, the whole phenomenon\r\nis utterly strange to her. She\'s just been carried along from an age of\r\nspearheads and plunked down here with the equipment of an archer for\r\ngoing into a pistol duel. You could sweep away the entire crust of\r\nhistory and she\'d never know the difference."\r\n\r\n"I wish our Richard would write about her."\r\n\r\n"Anthony, surely you don\'t think she\'s worth writing about."\r\n\r\n"As much as anybody," he answered, yawning. "You know I was thinking\r\nto-day that I have a great confidence in Dick. So long as he sticks to\r\npeople and not to ideas, and as long as his inspirations come from life\r\nand not from art, and always granting a normal growth, I believe he\'ll\r\nbe a big man."\r\n\r\n"I should think the appearance of the black note-book would prove that\r\nhe\'s going to life."\r\n\r\nAnthony raised himself on his elbow and answered eagerly:\r\n\r\n"He tries to go to life. So does every author except the very worst, but\r\nafter all most of them live on predigested food. The incident or\r\ncharacter may be from life, but the writer usually interprets it in\r\nterms of the last book he read. For instance, suppose he meets a sea\r\ncaptain and thinks he\'s an original character. The truth is that he sees\r\nthe resemblance between the sea captain and the last sea captain Dana\r\ncreated, or who-ever creates sea captains, and therefore he knows how\r\nto set this sea captain on paper. Dick, of course, can set down any\r\nconsciously picturesque, character-like character, but could he\r\naccurately transcribe his own sister?"\r\n\r\nThen they were off for half an hour on literature.\r\n\r\n"A classic," suggested Anthony, "is a successful book that has survived\r\nthe reaction of the next period or generation. Then it\'s safe, like a\r\nstyle in architecture or furniture. It\'s acquired a picturesque dignity\r\nto take the place of its fashion...."\r\n\r\nAfter a time the subject temporarily lost its tang. The interest of the\r\ntwo young men was not particularly technical. They were in love with\r\ngeneralities. Anthony had recently discovered Samuel Butler and the\r\nbrisk aphorisms in the note-book seemed to him the quintessence of\r\ncriticism. Maury, his whole mind so thoroughly mellowed by the very\r\nhardness of his scheme of life, seemed inevitably the wiser of the two,\r\nyet in the actual stuff of their intelligences they were not, it seemed,\r\nfundamentally different.\r\n\r\nThey drifted from letters to the curiosities of each other\'s day.\r\n\r\n"Whose tea was it?"\r\n\r\n"People named Abercrombie."\r\n\r\n"Why\'d you stay late? Meet a luscious debutante?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Did you really?" Anthony\'s voice lifted in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Not a debutante exactly. Said she came out two winters ago in Kansas\r\nCity."\r\n\r\n"Sort of left-over?"\r\n\r\n"No," answered Maury with some amusement, "I think that\'s the last thing\r\nI\'d say about her. She seemed--well, somehow the youngest person there."\r\n\r\n"Not too young to make you miss a train."\r\n\r\n"Young enough. Beautiful child."\r\n\r\nAnthony chuckled in his one-syllable snort.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Maury, you\'re in your second childhood. What do you mean by\r\nbeautiful?"\r\n\r\nMaury gazed helplessly into space.\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t describe her exactly--except to say that she was\r\nbeautiful. She was--tremendously alive. She was eating gum-drops."\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\n"It was a sort of attenuated vice. She\'s a nervous kind--said she always\r\nate gum-drops at teas because she had to stand around so long in\r\none place."\r\n\r\n"What\'d you talk about--Bergson? Bilphism? Whether the one-step is\r\nimmoral?"\r\n\r\nMaury was unruffled; his fur seemed to run all ways.\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact we did talk on Bilphism. Seems her mother\'s a\r\nBilphist. Mostly, though, we talked about legs."\r\n\r\nAnthony rocked in glee.\r\n\r\n"My God! Whose legs?"\r\n\r\n"Hers. She talked a lot about hers. As though they were a sort of choice\r\nbric-a-brac. She aroused a great desire to see them."\r\n\r\n"What is she--a dancer?"\r\n\r\n"No, I found she was a cousin of Dick\'s."\r\n\r\nAnthony sat upright so suddenly that the pillow he released stood on end\r\nlike a live thing and dove to the floor.\r\n\r\n"Name\'s Gloria Gilbert?" he cried.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Isn\'t she remarkable?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know--but for sheer dulness her father--"\r\n\r\n"Well," interrupted Maury with implacable conviction, "her family may be\r\nas sad as professional mourners but I\'m inclined to think that she\'s a\r\nquite authentic and original character. The outer signs of the\r\ncut-and-dried Yale prom girl and all that--but different, very\r\nemphatically different."\r\n\r\n"Go on, go on!" urged Anthony. "Soon as Dick told me she didn\'t have a\r\nbrain in her head I knew she must be pretty good."\r\n\r\n"Did he say that?"\r\n\r\n"Swore to it," said Anthony with another snorting laugh.\r\n\r\n"Well, what he means by brains in a woman is--"\r\n\r\n"I know," interrupted Anthony eagerly, "he means a smattering of\r\nliterary misinformation."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it. The kind who believes that the annual moral let-down of the\r\ncountry is a very good thing or the kind who believes it\'s a very\r\nominous thing. Either pince-nez or postures. Well, this girl talked\r\nabout legs. She talked about skin too--her own skin. Always her own. She\r\ntold me the sort of tan she\'d like to get in the summer and how closely\r\nshe usually approximated it."\r\n\r\n"You sat enraptured by her low alto?"\r\n\r\n"By her low alto! No, by tan! I began thinking about tan. I began to\r\nthink what color I turned when I made my last exposure about two years\r\nago. I did use to get a pretty good tan. I used to get a sort of bronze,\r\nif I remember rightly."\r\n\r\nAnthony retired into the cushions, shaken with laughter.\r\n\r\n"She\'s got you going--oh, Maury! Maury the Connecticut life-saver. The\r\nhuman nutmeg. Extra! Heiress elopes with coast-guard because of his\r\nluscious pigmentation! Afterward found to be Tasmanian strain in\r\nhis family!"\r\n\r\nMaury sighed; rising he walked to the window and raised the shade.\r\n\r\n"Snowing hard."\r\n\r\nAnthony, still laughing quietly to himself, made no answer.\r\n\r\n"Another winter." Maury\'s voice from the window was almost a whisper.\r\n"We\'re growing old, Anthony. I\'m twenty-seven, by God! Three years to\r\nthirty, and then I\'m what an undergraduate calls a middle-aged man."\r\n\r\nAnthony was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n"You _are_ old, Maury," he agreed at length. "The first signs of a very\r\ndissolute and wabbly senescence--you have spent the afternoon talking\r\nabout tan and a lady\'s legs."\r\n\r\nMaury pulled down the shade with a sudden harsh snap.\r\n\r\n"Idiot!" he cried, "that from you! Here I sit, young Anthony, as I\'ll\r\nsit for a generation or more and watch such gay souls as you and Dick\r\nand Gloria Gilbert go past me, dancing and singing and loving and hating\r\none another and being moved, being eternally moved. And I am moved only\r\nby my lack of emotion. I shall sit and the snow will come--oh, for a\r\nCaramel to take notes--and another winter and I shall be thirty and you\r\nand Dick and Gloria will go on being eternally moved and dancing by me\r\nand singing. But after you\'ve all gone I\'ll be saying things for new\r\nDicks to write down, and listening to the disillusions and cynicisms and\r\nemotions of new Anthonys--yes, and talking to new Glorias about the tans\r\nof summers yet to come."\r\n\r\nThe firelight flurried up on the hearth. Maury left the window, stirred\r\nthe blaze with a poker, and dropped a log upon the andirons. Then he sat\r\nback in his chair and the remnants of his voice faded in the new fire\r\nthat spit red and yellow along the bark.\r\n\r\n"After all, Anthony, it\'s you who are very romantic and young. It\'s you\r\nwho are infinitely more susceptible and afraid of your calm being\r\nbroken. It\'s me who tries again and again to be moved--let myself go a\r\nthousand times and I\'m always me. Nothing--quite--stirs me.\r\n\r\n"Yet," he murmured after another long pause, "there was something about\r\nthat little girl with her absurd tan that was eternally old--like me."\r\n\r\n\r\nTURBULENCE\r\n\r\nAnthony turned over sleepily in his bed, greeting a patch of cold sun on\r\nhis counterpane, crisscrossed with the shadows of the leaded window. The\r\nroom was full of morning. The carved chest in the corner, the ancient\r\nand inscrutable wardrobe, stood about the room like dark symbols of the\r\nobliviousness of matter; only the rug was beckoning and perishable to\r\nhis perishable feet, and Bounds, horribly inappropriate in his soft\r\ncollar, was of stuff as fading as the gauze of frozen breath he uttered.\r\nHe was close to the bed, his hand still lowered where he had been\r\njerking at the upper blanket, his dark-brown eyes fixed imperturbably\r\nupon his master.\r\n\r\n"Bows!" muttered the drowsy god. "Thachew, Bows?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s I, sir."\r\n\r\nAnthony moved his head, forced his eyes wide, and blinked triumphantly.\r\n\r\n"Bounds."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Can you get off--yeow-ow-oh-oh-oh God!--" Anthony yawned insufferably\r\nand the contents of his brain seemed to fall together in a dense hash.\r\nHe made a fresh start.\r\n\r\n"Can you come around about four and serve some tea and sandwiches or\r\nsomething?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nAnthony considered with chilling lack of inspiration. "Some sandwiches,"\r\nhe repeated helplessly, "oh, some cheese sandwiches and jelly ones and\r\nchicken and olive, I guess. Never mind breakfast."\r\n\r\nThe strain of invention was too much. He shut his eyes wearily, let his\r\nhead roll to rest inertly, and quickly relaxed what he had regained of\r\nmuscular control. Out of a crevice of his mind crept the vague but\r\ninevitable spectre of the night before--but it proved in this case to be\r\nnothing but a seemingly interminable conversation with Richard Caramel,\r\nwho had called on him at midnight; they had drunk four bottles of beer\r\nand munched dry crusts of bread while Anthony listened to a reading of\r\nthe first part of "The Demon Lover."\r\n\r\n--Came a voice now after many hours. Anthony disregarded it, as sleep\r\nclosed over him, folded down upon him, crept up into the byways of\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he was awake, saying: "What?"\r\n\r\n"For how many, sir?" It was still Bounds, standing patient and\r\nmotionless at the foot of the bed--Bounds who divided his manner among\r\nthree gentlemen.\r\n\r\n"How many what?"\r\n\r\n"I think, sir, I\'d better know how many are coming. I\'ll have to plan\r\nfor the sandwiches, sir."\r\n\r\n"Two," muttered Anthony huskily; "lady and a gentleman."\r\n\r\nBounds said, "Thank you, sir," and moved away, bearing with him his\r\nhumiliating reproachful soft collar, reproachful to each of the three\r\ngentlemen, who only demanded of him a third.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time Anthony arose and drew an opalescent dressing grown of\r\nbrown and blue over his slim pleasant figure. With a last yawn he went\r\ninto the bathroom, and turning on the dresser light (the bathroom had no\r\noutside exposure) he contemplated himself in the mirror with some\r\ninterest. A wretched apparition, he thought; he usually thought so in\r\nthe morning--sleep made his face unnaturally pale. He lit a cigarette\r\nand glanced through several letters and the morning Tribune.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, shaven and dressed, he was sitting at his desk looking at\r\na small piece of paper he had taken out of his wallet. It was scrawled\r\nwith semi-legible memoranda: "See Mr. Howland at five. Get hair-cut. See\r\nabout Rivers\' bill. Go book-store."\r\n\r\n--And under the last: "Cash in bank, $690 (crossed out), $612 (crossed\r\nout), $607."\r\n\r\nFinally, down at the bottom and in a hurried scrawl: "Dick and Gloria\r\nGilbert for tea."\r\n\r\nThis last item brought him obvious satisfaction. His day, usually a\r\njelly-like creature, a shapeless, spineless thing, had attained Mesozoic\r\nstructure. It was marching along surely, even jauntily, toward a climax,\r\nas a play should, as a day should. He dreaded the moment when the\r\nbackbone of the day should be broken, when he should have met the girl\r\nat last, talked to her, and then bowed her laughter out the door,\r\nreturning only to the melancholy dregs in the teacups and the gathering\r\nstaleness of the uneaten sandwiches.\r\n\r\nThere was a growing lack of color in Anthony\'s days. He felt it\r\nconstantly and sometimes traced it to a talk he had had with Maury Noble\r\na month before. That anything so ingenuous, so priggish, as a sense of\r\nwaste should oppress him was absurd, but there was no denying the fact\r\nthat some unwelcome survival of a fetish had drawn him three weeks\r\nbefore down to the public library, where, by the token of Richard\r\nCaramel\'s card, he had drawn out half a dozen books on the Italian\r\nRenaissance. That these books were still piled on his desk in the\r\noriginal order of carriage, that they were daily increasing his\r\nliabilities by twelve cents, was no mitigation of their testimony. They\r\nwere cloth and morocco witnesses to the fact of his defection. Anthony\r\nhad had several hours of acute and startling panic.\r\n\r\nIn justification of his manner of living there was first, of course, The\r\nMeaninglessness of Life. As aides and ministers, pages and squires,\r\nbutlers and lackeys to this great Khan there were a thousand books\r\nglowing on his shelves, there was his apartment and all the money that\r\nwas to be his when the old man up the river should choke on his last\r\nmorality. From a world fraught with the menace of debutantes and the\r\nstupidity of many Geraldines he was thankfully delivered--rather should\r\nhe emulate the feline immobility of Maury and wear proudly the\r\nculminative wisdom of the numbered generations.\r\n\r\nOver and against these things was something which his brain persistently\r\nanalyzed and dealt with as a tiresome complex but which, though\r\nlogically disposed of and bravely trampled under foot, had sent him out\r\nthrough the soft slush of late November to a library which had none of\r\nthe books he most wanted. It is fair to analyze Anthony as far as he\r\ncould analyze himself; further than that it is, of course, presumption.\r\nHe found in himself a growing horror and loneliness. The idea of eating\r\nalone frightened him; in preference he dined often with men he detested.\r\nTravel, which had once charmed him, seemed at length, unendurable, a\r\nbusiness of color without substance, a phantom chase after his own\r\ndream\'s shadow.\r\n\r\n--If I am essentially weak, he thought, I need work to do, work to do.\r\nIt worried him to think that he was, after all, a facile mediocrity,\r\nwith neither the poise of Maury nor the enthusiasm of Dick. It seemed a\r\ntragedy to want nothing--and yet he wanted something, something. He knew\r\nin flashes what it was--some path of hope to lead him toward what he\r\nthought was an imminent and ominous old age.\r\n\r\nAfter cocktails and luncheon at the University Club Anthony felt better.\r\nHe had run into two men from his class at Harvard, and in contrast to\r\nthe gray heaviness of their conversation his life assumed color. Both of\r\nthem were married: one spent his coffee time in sketching an\r\nextra-nuptial adventure to the bland and appreciative smiles of the\r\nother. Both of them, he thought, were Mr. Gilberts in embryo; the number\r\nof their "yes\'s" would have to be quadrupled, their natures crabbed by\r\ntwenty years--then they would be no more than obsolete and broken\r\nmachines, pseudo-wise and valueless, nursed to an utter senility by the\r\nwomen they had broken.\r\n\r\nAh, he was more than that, as he paced the long carpet in the lounge\r\nafter dinner, pausing at the window to look into the harried street. He\r\nwas Anthony Patch, brilliant, magnetic, the heir of many years and many\r\nmen. This was his world now--and that last strong irony he craved lay in\r\nthe offing.\r\n\r\nWith a stray boyishness he saw himself a power upon the earth; with his\r\ngrandfather\'s money he might build his own pedestal and be a Talleyrand,\r\na Lord Verulam. The clarity of his mind, its sophistication, its\r\nversatile intelligence, all at their maturity and dominated by some\r\npurpose yet to be born would find him work to do. On this minor his\r\ndream faded--work to do: he tried to imagine himself in Congress rooting\r\naround in the litter of that incredible pigsty with the narrow and\r\nporcine brows he saw pictured sometimes in the rotogravure sections of\r\nthe Sunday newspapers, those glorified proletarians babbling blandly to\r\nthe nation the ideas of high school seniors! Little men with copy-book\r\nambitions who by mediocrity had thought to emerge from mediocrity into\r\nthe lustreless and unromantic heaven of a government by the people--and\r\nthe best, the dozen shrewd men at the top, egotistic and cynical, were\r\ncontent to lead this choir of white ties and wire collar-buttons in a\r\ndiscordant and amazing hymn, compounded of a vague confusion between\r\nwealth as a reward of virtue and wealth as a proof of vice, and\r\ncontinued cheers for God, the Constitution, and the Rocky Mountains!\r\n\r\nLord Verulam! Talleyrand!\r\n\r\nBack in his apartment the grayness returned. His cocktails had died,\r\nmaking him sleepy, somewhat befogged and inclined to be surly. Lord\r\nVerulam--he? The very thought was bitter. Anthony Patch with no record\r\nof achievement, without courage, without strength to be satisfied with\r\ntruth when it was given him. Oh, he was a pretentious fool, making\r\ncareers out of cocktails and meanwhile regretting, weakly and secretly,\r\nthe collapse of an insufficient and wretched idealism. He had garnished\r\nhis soul in the subtlest taste and now he longed for the old rubbish. He\r\nwas empty, it seemed, empty as an old bottle--\r\n\r\nThe buzzer rang at the door. Anthony sprang up and lifted the tube to\r\nhis ear. It was Richard Caramel\'s voice, stilted and facetious:\r\n\r\n"Announcing Miss Gloria Gilbert."\r\n\r\n"How do you do?" he said, smiling and holding the door ajar.\r\n\r\nDick bowed.\r\n\r\n"Gloria, this is Anthony."\r\n\r\n"Well!" she cried, holding out a little gloved hand. Under her fur coat\r\nher dress was Alice-blue, with white lace crinkled stiffly about\r\nher throat.\r\n\r\n"Let me take your things."\r\n\r\nAnthony stretched out his arms and the brown mass of fur tumbled into\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Thanks."\r\n\r\n"What do you think of her, Anthony?" Richard Caramel demanded\r\nbarbarously. "Isn\'t she beautiful?"\r\n\r\n"Well!" cried the girl defiantly--withal unmoved.\r\n\r\nShe was dazzling--alight; it was agony to comprehend her beauty in a\r\nglance. Her hair, full of a heavenly glamour, was gay against the winter\r\ncolor of the room.\r\n\r\nAnthony moved about, magician-like, turning the mushroom lamp into an\r\norange glory. The stirred fire burnished the copper andirons on\r\nthe hearth--\r\n\r\n"I\'m a solid block of ice," murmured Gloria casually, glancing around\r\nwith eyes whose irises were of the most delicate and transparent bluish\r\nwhite. "What a slick fire! We found a place where you could stand on an\r\niron-bar grating, sort of, and it blew warm air up at you--but Dick\r\nwouldn\'t wait there with me. I told him to go on alone and let me\r\nbe happy."\r\n\r\nConventional enough this. She seemed talking for her own pleasure,\r\nwithout effort. Anthony, sitting at one end of the sofa, examined her\r\nprofile against the foreground of the lamp: the exquisite regularity of\r\nnose and upper lip, the chin, faintly decided, balanced beautifully on a\r\nrather short neck. On a photograph she must have been completely\r\nclassical, almost cold--but the glow of her hair and cheeks, at once\r\nflushed and fragile, made her the most living person he had ever seen.\r\n\r\n"... Think you\'ve got the best name I\'ve heard," she was saying, still\r\napparently to herself; her glance rested on him a moment and then\r\nflitted past him--to the Italian bracket-lamps clinging like luminous\r\nyellow turtles at intervals along the walls, to the books row upon row,\r\nthen to her cousin on the other side. "Anthony Patch. Only you ought to\r\nlook sort of like a horse, with a long narrow face--and you ought to be\r\nin tatters."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all the Patch part, though. How should Anthony look?"\r\n\r\n"You look like Anthony," she assured him seriously--he thought she had\r\nscarcely seen him--"rather majestic," she continued, "and solemn."\r\n\r\nAnthony indulged in a disconcerted smile.\r\n\r\n"Only I like alliterative names," she went on, "all except mine. Mine\'s\r\ntoo flamboyant. I used to know two girls named Jinks, though, and just\r\nthink if they\'d been named anything except what they were named--Judy\r\nJinks and Jerry Jinks. Cute, what? Don\'t you think?" Her childish mouth\r\nwas parted, awaiting a rejoinder.\r\n\r\n"Everybody in the next generation," suggested Dick, "will be named Peter\r\nor Barbara--because at present all the piquant literary characters are\r\nnamed Peter or Barbara."\r\n\r\nAnthony continued the prophecy:\r\n\r\n"Of course Gladys and Eleanor, having graced the last generation of\r\nheroines and being at present in their social prime, will be passed on\r\nto the next generation of shop-girls--"\r\n\r\n"Displacing Ella and Stella," interrupted Dick.\r\n\r\n"And Pearl and Jewel," Gloria added cordially, "and Earl and Elmer and\r\nMinnie."\r\n\r\n"And then I\'ll come along," remarked Dick, "and picking up the obsolete\r\nname, Jewel, I\'ll attach it to some quaint and attractive character and\r\nit\'ll start its career all over again."\r\n\r\nHer voice took up the thread of subject and wove along with faintly\r\nupturning, half-humorous intonations for sentence ends--as though\r\ndefying interruption--and intervals of shadowy laughter. Dick had told\r\nher that Anthony\'s man was named Bounds--she thought that was wonderful!\r\nDick had made some sad pun about Bounds doing patchwork, but if there\r\nwas one thing worse than a pun, she said, it was a person who, as the\r\ninevitable come-back to a pun, gave the perpetrator a mock-reproachful\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n"Where are you from?" inquired Anthony. He knew, but beauty had rendered\r\nhim thoughtless.\r\n\r\n"Kansas City, Missouri."\r\n\r\n"They put her out the same time they barred cigarettes."\r\n\r\n"Did they bar cigarettes? I see the hand of my holy grandfather."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a reformer or something, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"I blush for him."\r\n\r\n"So do I," she confessed. "I detest reformers, especially the sort who\r\ntry to reform me."\r\n\r\n"Are there many of those?"\r\n\r\n"Dozens. It\'s \'Oh, Gloria, if you smoke so many cigarettes you\'ll lose\r\nyour pretty complexion!\' and \'Oh, Gloria, why don\'t you marry and\r\nsettle down?\'"\r\n\r\nAnthony agreed emphatically while he wondered who had had the temerity\r\nto speak thus to such a personage.\r\n\r\n"And then," she continued, "there are all the subtle reformers who tell\r\nyou the wild stories they\'ve heard about you and how they\'ve been\r\nsticking up for you."\r\n\r\nHe saw, at length, that her eyes were gray, very level and cool, and\r\nwhen they rested on him he understood what Maury had meant by saying she\r\nwas very young and very old. She talked always about herself as a very\r\ncharming child might talk, and her comments on her tastes and distastes\r\nwere unaffected and spontaneous.\r\n\r\n"I must confess," said Anthony gravely, "that even _I_\'ve heard one\r\nthing about you."\r\n\r\nAlert at once, she sat up straight. Those eyes, with the grayness and\r\neternity of a cliff of soft granite, caught his.\r\n\r\n"Tell me. I\'ll believe it. I always believe anything any one tells me\r\nabout myself--don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Invariably!" agreed the two men in unison.\r\n\r\n"Well, tell me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure that I ought to," teased Anthony, smiling unwillingly. She\r\nwas so obviously interested, in a state of almost laughable\r\nself-absorption.\r\n\r\n"He means your nickname," said her cousin.\r\n\r\n"What name?" inquired Anthony, politely puzzled.\r\n\r\nInstantly she was shy--then she laughed, rolled back against the\r\ncushions, and turned her eyes up as she spoke:\r\n\r\n"Coast-to-Coast Gloria." Her voice was full of laughter, laughter\r\nundefined as the varying shadows playing between fire and lamp upon her\r\nhair. "O Lord!"\r\n\r\nStill Anthony was puzzled.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"_Me_, I mean. That\'s what some silly boys coined for _me_."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see, Anthony," explained Dick, "traveller of a nation-wide\r\nnotoriety and all that. Isn\'t that what you\'ve heard? She\'s been called\r\nthat for years--since she was seventeen."\r\n\r\nAnthony\'s eyes became sad and humorous.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s this female Methuselah you\'ve brought in here, Caramel?"\r\n\r\nShe disregarded this, possibly rather resented it, for she switched back\r\nto the main topic.\r\n\r\n"What _have_ you heard of me?"\r\n\r\n"Something about your physique."\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said, coolly disappointed, "that all?"\r\n\r\n"Your tan."\r\n\r\n"My tan?" She was puzzled. Her hand rose to her throat, rested there an\r\ninstant as though the fingers were feeling variants of color.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember Maury Noble? Man you met about a month ago. You made a\r\ngreat impression."\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment.\r\n\r\n"I remember--but he didn\'t call me up."\r\n\r\n"He was afraid to, I don\'t doubt."\r\n\r\nIt was black dark without now and Anthony wondered that his apartment\r\nhad ever seemed gray--so warm and friendly were the books and pictures\r\non the walls and the good Bounds offering tea from a respectful shadow\r\nand the three nice people giving out waves of interest and laughter back\r\nand forth across the happy fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISSATISFACTION\r\n\r\nOn Thursday afternoon Gloria and Anthony had tea together in the grill\r\nroom at the Plaza. Her fur-trimmed suit was gray--"because with gray you\r\n_have_ to wear a lot of paint," she explained--and a small toque sat\r\nrakishly on her head, allowing yellow ripples of hair to wave out in\r\njaunty glory. In the higher light it seemed to Anthony that her\r\npersonality was infinitely softer--she seemed so young, scarcely\r\neighteen; her form under the tight sheath, known then as a hobble-skirt,\r\nwas amazingly supple and slender, and her hands, neither "artistic" nor\r\nstubby, were small as a child\'s hands should be.\r\n\r\nAs they entered, the orchestra were sounding the preliminary whimpers to\r\na maxixe, a tune full of castanets and facile faintly languorous violin\r\nharmonies, appropriate to the crowded winter grill teeming with an\r\nexcited college crowd, high-spirited at the approach of the holidays.\r\nCarefully, Gloria considered several locations, and rather to Anthony\'s\r\nannoyance paraded him circuitously to a table for two at the far side of\r\nthe room. Reaching it she again considered. Would she sit on the right\r\nor on the left? Her beautiful eyes and lips were very grave as she made\r\nher choice, and Anthony thought again how naive was her every gesture;\r\nshe took all the things of life for hers to choose from and apportion,\r\nas though she were continually picking out presents for herself from an\r\ninexhaustible counter.\r\n\r\nAbstractedly she watched the dancers for a few moments, commenting\r\nmurmurously as a couple eddied near.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a pretty girl in blue"--and as Anthony looked obediently--"\r\nthere! No. behind you--there!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he agreed helplessly.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t see her."\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather look at you."\r\n\r\n"I know, but she was pretty. Except that she had big ankles."\r\n\r\n"Was she?--I mean, did she?" he said indifferently.\r\n\r\nA girl\'s salutation came from a couple dancing close to them.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Gloria! O Gloria!"\r\n\r\n"Hello there."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Somebody." She caught sight of another face. "Hello,\r\nMuriel!" Then to Anthony: "There\'s Muriel Kane. Now I think she\'s\r\nattractive, \'cept not very."\r\n\r\nAnthony chuckled appreciatively.\r\n\r\n"Attractive, \'cept not very," he repeated.\r\n\r\nShe smiled--was interested immediately.\r\n\r\n"Why is that funny?" Her tone was pathetically intent.\r\n\r\n"It just was."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to dance?"\r\n\r\n"Do you?"\r\n\r\n"Sort of. But let\'s sit," she decided.\r\n\r\n"And talk about you? You love to talk about you, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." Caught in a vanity, she laughed.\r\n\r\n"I imagine your autobiography would be a classic."\r\n\r\n"Dick says I haven\'t got one."\r\n\r\n"Dick!" he exclaimed. "What does he know about you?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. But he says the biography of every woman begins with the first\r\nkiss that counts, and ends when her last child is laid in her arms."\r\n\r\n"He\'s talking from his book."\r\n\r\n"He says unloved women have no biographies--they have histories."\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed again.\r\n\r\n"Surely you don\'t claim to be unloved!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose not."\r\n\r\n"Then why haven\'t you a biography? Haven\'t you ever had a kiss that\r\ncounted?" As the words left his lips he drew in his breath sharply as\r\nthough to suck them back. This _baby_!\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean \'counts,\'" she objected.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d tell me how old you are."\r\n\r\n"Twenty-two," she said, meeting his eyes gravely. "How old did you\r\nthink?"\r\n\r\n"About eighteen."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to start being that. I don\'t like being twenty-two. I hate it\r\nmore than anything in the world."\r\n\r\n"Being twenty-two?"\r\n\r\n"No. Getting old and everything. Getting married."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you ever want to marry?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to have responsibility and a lot of children to take care\r\nof."\r\n\r\nEvidently she did not doubt that on her lips all things were good. He\r\nwaited rather breathlessly for her next remark, expecting it to follow\r\nup her last. She was smiling, without amusement but pleasantly, and\r\nafter an interval half a dozen words fell into the space between them:\r\n\r\n"I wish I had some gum-drops."\r\n\r\n"You shall!" He beckoned to a waiter and sent him to the cigar counter.\r\n\r\n"D\'you mind? I love gum-drops. Everybody kids me about it because I\'m\r\nalways whacking away at one--whenever my daddy\'s not around."\r\n\r\n"Not at all.--Who are all these children?" he asked suddenly. "Do you\r\nknow them all?"\r\n\r\n"Why--no, but they\'re from--oh, from everywhere, I suppose. Don\'t you\r\never come here?"\r\n\r\n"Very seldom. I don\'t care particularly for \'nice girls.\'"\r\n\r\nImmediately he had her attention. She turned a definite shoulder to the\r\ndancers, relaxed in her chair, and demanded:\r\n\r\n"What _do_ you do with yourself?"\r\n\r\nThanks to a cocktail Anthony welcomed the question. In a mood to talk,\r\nhe wanted, moreover, to impress this girl whose interest seemed so\r\ntantalizingly elusive--she stopped to browse in unexpected pastures,\r\nhurried quickly over the inobviously obvious. He wanted to pose. He\r\nwanted to appear suddenly to her in novel and heroic colors. He wanted\r\nto stir her from that casualness she showed toward everything\r\nexcept herself.\r\n\r\n"I do nothing," he began, realizing simultaneously that his words were\r\nto lack the debonair grace he craved for them. "I do nothing, for\r\nthere\'s nothing I can do that\'s worth doing."\r\n\r\n"Well?" He had neither surprised her nor even held her, yet she had\r\ncertainly understood him, if indeed he had said aught worth\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you approve of lazy men?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so, if they\'re gracefully lazy. Is that possible for an\r\nAmerican?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" he demanded, discomfited.\r\n\r\nBut her mind had left the subject and wandered up ten floors.\r\n\r\n"My daddy\'s mad at me," she observed dispassionately.\r\n\r\n"Why? But I want to know just why it\'s impossible for an American to be\r\ngracefully idle"--his words gathered conviction--"it astonishes me.\r\nIt--it--I don\'t understand why people think that every young man ought\r\nto go down-town and work ten hours a day for the best twenty years of\r\nhis life at dull, unimaginative work, certainly not altruistic work."\r\n\r\nHe broke off. She watched him inscrutably. He waited for her to agree or\r\ndisagree, but she did neither.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you ever form judgments on things?" he asked with some\r\nexasperation.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and her eyes wandered back to the dancers as she\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I don\'t know anything about--what you should do, or what\r\nanybody should do."\r\n\r\nShe confused him and hindered the flow of his ideas. Self-expression had\r\nnever seemed at once so desirable and so impossible.\r\n\r\n"Well," he admitted apologetically, "neither do I, of course, but--"\r\n\r\n"I just think of people," she continued, "whether they seem right where\r\nthey are and fit into the picture. I don\'t mind if they don\'t do\r\nanything. I don\'t see why they should; in fact it always astonishes me\r\nwhen anybody does anything."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want to do anything?"\r\n\r\n"I want to sleep."\r\n\r\nFor a second he was startled, almost as though she had meant this\r\nliterally.\r\n\r\n"Sleep?"\r\n\r\n"Sort of. I want to just be lazy and I want some of the people around me\r\nto be doing things, because that makes me feel comfortable and safe--and\r\nI want some of them to be doing nothing at all, because they can be\r\ngraceful and companionable for me. But I never want to change people or\r\nget excited over them."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a quaint little determinist," laughed Anthony. "It\'s your world,\r\nisn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Well--" she said with a quick upward glance, "isn\'t it? As long as\r\nI\'m--young."\r\n\r\nShe had paused slightly before the last word and Anthony suspected that\r\nshe had started to say "beautiful." It was undeniably what she\r\nhad intended.\r\n\r\nHer eyes brightened and he waited for her to enlarge on the theme. He\r\nhad drawn her out, at any rate--he bent forward slightly to catch\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\nBut "Let\'s dance!" was all she said.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRATION\r\n\r\nThat winter afternoon at the Plaza was the first of a succession of\r\n"dates" Anthony made with her in the blurred and stimulating days before\r\nChristmas. Invariably she was busy. What particular strata of the city\'s\r\nsocial life claimed her he was a long time finding out. It seemed to\r\nmatter very little. She attended the semi-public charity dances at the\r\nbig hotels; he saw her several times at dinner parties in Sherry\'s, and\r\nonce as he waited for her to dress, Mrs. Gilbert, apropos of her\r\ndaughter\'s habit of "going," rattled off an amazing holiday programme\r\nthat included half a dozen dances to which Anthony had received cards.\r\n\r\nHe made engagements with her several times for lunch and tea--the former\r\nwere hurried and, to him at least, rather unsatisfactory occasions, for\r\nshe was sleepy-eyed and casual, incapable of concentrating upon anything\r\nor of giving consecutive attention to his remarks. When after two of\r\nthese sallow meals he accused her of tendering him the skin and bones of\r\nthe day she laughed and gave him a tea-time three days off. This was\r\ninfinitely more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon just before Christmas he called up and found her in\r\nthe lull directly after some important but mysterious quarrel: she\r\ninformed him in a tone of mingled wrath and amusement that she had sent\r\na man out of her apartment--here Anthony speculated violently--and that\r\nthe man had been giving a little dinner for her that very night and that\r\nof course she wasn\'t going. So Anthony took her to supper.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go to something!" she proposed as they went down in the elevator.\r\n"I want to see a show, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nInquiry at the hotel ticket desk disclosed only two Sunday night\r\n"concerts."\r\n\r\n"They\'re always the same," she complained unhappily, "same old Yiddish\r\ncomedians. Oh, let\'s go somewhere!"\r\n\r\nTo conceal a guilty suspicion that he should have arranged a performance\r\nof some kind for her approval Anthony affected a knowing cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go to a good cabaret."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen every one in town."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ll find a new one."\r\n\r\nShe was in wretched humor; that was evident. Her gray eyes were granite\r\nnow indeed. When she wasn\'t speaking she stared straight in front of her\r\nas if at some distasteful abstraction in the lobby.\r\n\r\n"Well, come on, then."\r\n\r\nHe followed her, a graceful girl even in her enveloping fur, out to a\r\ntaxicab, and, with an air of having a definite place in mind, instructed\r\nthe driver to go over to Broadway and then turn south. He made several\r\ncasual attempts at conversation but as she adopted an impenetrable armor\r\nof silence and answered him in sentences as morose as the cold darkness\r\nof the taxicab he gave up, and assuming a like mood fell into a\r\ndim gloom.\r\n\r\nA dozen blocks down Broadway Anthony\'s eyes were caught by a large and\r\nunfamiliar electric sign spelling "Marathon" in glorious yellow script,\r\nadorned with electrical leaves and flowers that alternately vanished and\r\nbeamed upon the wet and glistening street. He leaned and rapped on the\r\ntaxi-window and in a moment was receiving information from a colored\r\ndoorman: Yes, this was a cabaret. Fine cabaret. Bes\' showina city!\r\n\r\n"Shall we try it?"\r\n\r\nWith a sigh Gloria tossed her cigarette out the open door and prepared\r\nto follow it; then they had passed under the screaming sign, under the\r\nwide portal, and up by a stuffy elevator into this unsung palace\r\nof pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe gay habitats of the very rich and the very poor, the very dashing\r\nand the very criminal, not to mention the lately exploited very\r\nBohemian, are made known to the awed high school girls of Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, and Redwing, Minnesota, not only through the bepictured and\r\nentrancing spreads of the Sunday theatrical supplements but through the\r\nshocked and alarmful eyes of Mr. Rupert Hughes and other chroniclers of\r\nthe mad pace of America. But the excursions of Harlem onto Broadway, the\r\ndeviltries of the dull and the revelries of the respectable are a matter\r\nof esoteric knowledge only to the participants themselves.\r\n\r\nA tip circulates--and in the place knowingly mentioned, gather the lower\r\nmoral-classes on Saturday and Sunday nights--the little troubled men who\r\nare pictured in the comics as "the Consumer" or "the Public." They have\r\nmade sure that the place has three qualifications: it is cheap; it\r\nimitates with a sort of shoddy and mechanical wistfulness the glittering\r\nantics of the great cafes in the theatre district; and--this, above all,\r\nimportant--it is a place where they can "take a nice girl," which means,\r\nof course, that every one has become equally harmless, timid, and\r\nuninteresting through lack of money and imagination.\r\n\r\nThere on Sunday nights gather the credulous, sentimental, underpaid,\r\noverworked people with hyphenated occupations: book-keepers,\r\nticket-sellers, office-managers, salesmen, and, most of all,\r\nclerks--clerks of the express, of the mail, of the grocery, of the\r\nbrokerage, of the bank. With them are their giggling, over-gestured,\r\npathetically pretentious women, who grow fat with them, bear them too\r\nmany babies, and float helpless and uncontent in a colorless sea of\r\ndrudgery and broken hopes.\r\n\r\nThey name these brummagem cabarets after Pullman cars. The "Marathon"!\r\nNot for them the salacious similes borrowed from the cafes of Paris!\r\nThis is where their docile patrons bring their "nice women," whose\r\nstarved fancies are only too willing to believe that the scene is\r\ncomparatively gay and joyous, and even faintly immoral. This is life!\r\nWho cares for the morrow?\r\n\r\nAbandoned people!\r\n\r\nAnthony and Gloria, seated, looked about them. At the next table a party\r\nof four were in process of being joined by a party of three, two men and\r\na girl, who were evidently late--and the manner of the girl was a study\r\nin national sociology. She was meeting some new men--and she was\r\npretending desperately. By gesture she was pretending and by words and\r\nby the scarcely perceptible motionings of her eyelids that she belonged\r\nto a class a little superior to the class with which she now had to do,\r\nthat a while ago she had been, and presently would again be, in a\r\nhigher, rarer air. She was almost painfully refined--she wore a last\r\nyear\'s hat covered with violets no more yearningly pretentious and\r\npalpably artificial than herself.\r\n\r\nFascinated, Anthony and Gloria watched the girl sit down and radiate the\r\nimpression that she was only condescendingly present. For _me_, her eyes\r\nsaid, this is practically a slumming expedition, to be cloaked with\r\nbelittling laughter and semi-apologetics.\r\n\r\n--And the other women passionately poured out the impression that though\r\nthey were in the crowd they were not of it. This was not the sort of\r\nplace to which they were accustomed; they had dropped in because it was\r\nnear by and convenient--every party in the restaurant poured out that\r\nimpression ... who knew? They were forever changing class, all of\r\nthem--the women often marrying above their opportunities, the men\r\nstriking suddenly a magnificent opulence: a sufficiently preposterous\r\nadvertising scheme, a celestialized ice cream cone. Meanwhile, they met\r\nhere to eat, closing their eyes to the economy displayed in infrequent\r\nchangings of table-cloths, in the casualness of the cabaret performers,\r\nmost of all in the colloquial carelessness and familiarity of the\r\nwaiters. One was sure that these waiters were not impressed by their\r\npatrons. One expected that presently they would sit at the tables ...\r\n\r\n"Do you object to this?" inquired Anthony.\r\n\r\nGloria\'s face warmed and for the first time that evening she smiled.\r\n\r\n"I love it," she said frankly. It was impossible to doubt her. Her gray\r\neyes roved here and there, drowsing, idle or alert, on each group,\r\npassing to the next with unconcealed enjoyment, and to Anthony were made\r\nplain the different values of her profile, the wonderfully alive\r\nexpressions of her mouth, and the authentic distinction of face and form\r\nand manner that made her like a single flower amidst a collection of\r\ncheap bric-a-brac. At her happiness, a gorgeous sentiment welled into\r\nhis eyes, choked him up, set his nerves a-tingle, and filled his throat\r\nwith husky and vibrant emotion. There was a hush upon the room. The\r\ncareless violins and saxophones, the shrill rasping complaint of a child\r\nnear by, the voice of the violet-hatted girl at the next table, all\r\nmoved slowly out, receded, and fell away like shadowy reflections on the\r\nshining floor--and they two, it seemed to him, were alone and infinitely\r\nremote, quiet. Surely the freshness of her cheeks was a gossamer\r\nprojection from a land of delicate and undiscovered shades; her hand\r\ngleaming on the stained table-cloth was a shell from some far and wildly\r\nvirginal sea....\r\n\r\nThen the illusion snapped like a nest of threads; the room grouped\r\nitself around him, voices, faces, movement; the garish shimmer of the\r\nlights overhead became real, became portentous; breath began, the slow\r\nrespiration that she and he took in time with this docile hundred, the\r\nrise and fall of bosoms, the eternal meaningless play and interplay and\r\ntossing and reiterating of word and phrase--all these wrenched his\r\nsenses open to the suffocating pressure of life--and then her voice came\r\nat him, cool as the suspended dream he had left behind.\r\n\r\n"I belong here," she murmured, "I\'m like these people."\r\n\r\nFor an instant this seemed a sardonic and unnecessary paradox hurled at\r\nhim across the impassable distances she created about herself. Her\r\nentrancement had increased--her eyes rested upon a Semitic violinist who\r\nswayed his shoulders to the rhythm of the year\'s mellowest fox-trot:\r\n\r\n"Something--goes\r\nRing-a-ting-a-ling-a-ling\r\nRight in-your ear--"\r\n\r\nAgain she spoke, from the centre of this pervasive illusion of her own.\r\nIt amazed him. It was like blasphemy from the mouth of a child.\r\n\r\n"I\'m like they are--like Japanese lanterns and crape paper, and the\r\nmusic of that orchestra."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a young idiot!" he insisted wildly. She shook her blond head.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not. I _am_ like them.... You ought to see.... You don\'t know\r\nme." She hesitated and her eyes came back to him, rested abruptly on\r\nhis, as though surprised at the last to see him there. "I\'ve got a\r\nstreak of what you\'d call cheapness. I don\'t know where I get it but\r\nit\'s--oh, things like this and bright colors and gaudy vulgarity. I seem\r\nto belong here. These people could appreciate me and take me for\r\ngranted, and these men would fall in love with me and admire me, whereas\r\nthe clever men I meet would just analyze me and tell me I\'m this because\r\nof this or that because of that."\r\n\r\n--Anthony for the moment wanted fiercely to paint her, to set her down\r\n_now_, as she was, as, as with each relentless second she could never\r\nbe again.\r\n\r\n"What were you thinking?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Just that I\'m not a realist," he said, and then: "No, only the\r\nromanticist preserves the things worth preserving."\r\n\r\nOut of the deep sophistication of Anthony an understanding formed,\r\nnothing atavistic or obscure, indeed scarcely physical at all, an\r\nunderstanding remembered from the romancings of many generations of\r\nminds that as she talked and caught his eyes and turned her lovely head,\r\nshe moved him as he had never been moved before. The sheath that held\r\nher soul had assumed significance--that was all. She was a sun, radiant,\r\ngrowing, gathering light and storing it--then after an eternity pouring\r\nit forth in a glance, the fragment of a sentence, to that part of him\r\nthat cherished all beauty and all illusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONNOISSEUR OF KISSES\r\n\r\nFrom his undergraduate days as editor of The Harvard Crimson Richard\r\nCaramel had desired to write. But as a senior he had picked up the\r\nglorified illusion that certain men were set aside for "service" and,\r\ngoing into the world, were to accomplish a vague yearnful something\r\nwhich would react either in eternal reward or, at the least, in the\r\npersonal satisfaction of having striven for the greatest good of the\r\ngreatest number.\r\n\r\nThis spirit has long rocked the colleges in America. It begins, as a\r\nrule, during the immaturities and facile impressions of freshman\r\nyear--sometimes back in preparatory school. Prosperous apostles known\r\nfor their emotional acting go the rounds of the universities and, by\r\nfrightening the amiable sheep and dulling the quickening of interest and\r\nintellectual curiosity which is the purpose of all education, distil a\r\nmysterious conviction of sin, harking back to childhood crimes and to\r\nthe ever-present menace of "women." To these lectures go the wicked\r\nyouths to cheer and joke and the timid to swallow the tasty pills, which\r\nwould be harmless if administered to farmers\' wives and pious\r\ndrug-clerks but are rather dangerous medicine for these "future\r\nleaders of men."\r\n\r\nThis octopus was strong enough to wind a sinuous tentacle about Richard\r\nCaramel. The year after his graduation it called him into the slums of\r\nNew York to muck about with bewildered Italians as secretary to an\r\n"Alien Young Men\'s Rescue Association." He labored at it over a year\r\nbefore the monotony began to weary him. The aliens kept coming\r\ninexhaustibly--Italians, Poles, Scandinavians, Czechs, Armenians--with\r\nthe same wrongs, the same exceptionally ugly faces and very much the\r\nsame smells, though he fancied that these grew more profuse and diverse\r\nas the months passed. His eventual conclusions about the expediency of\r\nservice were vague, but concerning his own relation to it they were\r\nabrupt and decisive. Any amiable young man, his head ringing with the\r\nlatest crusade, could accomplish as much as he could with the debris of\r\nEurope--and it was time for him to write.\r\n\r\nHe had been living in a down-town Y.M.C.A., but when he quit the task of\r\nmaking sow-ear purses out of sows\' ears, he moved up-town and went to\r\nwork immediately as a reporter for The Sun. He kept at this for a year,\r\ndoing desultory writing on the side, with little success, and then one\r\nday an infelicitous incident peremptorily closed his newspaper career.\r\nOn a February afternoon he was assigned to report a parade of Squadron\r\nA. Snow threatening, he went to sleep instead before a hot fire, and\r\nwhen he woke up did a smooth column about the muffled beats of the\r\nhorses\' hoofs in the snow... This he handed in. Next morning a marked\r\ncopy of the paper was sent down to the City Editor with a scrawled note:\r\n"Fire the man who wrote this." It seemed that Squadron A had also seen\r\nthe snow threatening--had postponed the parade until another day.\r\n\r\nA week later he had begun "The Demon Lover."...\r\n\r\nIn January, the Monday of the months, Richard Caramel\'s nose was blue\r\nconstantly, a sardonic blue, vaguely suggestive of the flames licking\r\naround a sinner. His book was nearly ready, and as it grew in\r\ncompleteness it seemed to grow also in its demands, sapping him,\r\noverpowering him, until he walked haggard and conquered in its shadow.\r\nNot only to Anthony and Maury did he pour out his hopes and boasts and\r\nindecisions, but to any one who could be prevailed upon to listen. He\r\ncalled on polite but bewildered publishers, he discussed it with his\r\ncasual vis-a-vis at the Harvard Club; it was even claimed by Anthony\r\nthat he had been discovered, one Sunday night, debating the\r\ntransposition of Chapter Two with a literary ticket-collector in the\r\nchill and dismal recesses of a Harlem subway station. And latest among\r\nhis confidantes was Mrs. Gilbert, who sat with him by the hour and\r\nalternated between Bilphism and literature in an intense cross-fire.\r\n\r\n"Shakespeare was a Bilphist," she assured him through a fixed smile.\r\n"Oh, yes! He was a Bilphist. It\'s been proved."\r\n\r\nAt this Dick would look a bit blank.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve read \'Hamlet\' you can\'t help but see."\r\n\r\n"Well, he--he lived in a more credulous age--a more religious age."\r\n\r\nBut she demanded the whole loaf:\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, but you see Bilphism isn\'t a religion. It\'s the science of all\r\nreligions." She smiled defiantly at him. This was the _bon mot_ of her\r\nbelief. There was something in the arrangement of words which grasped\r\nher mind so definitely that the statement became superior to any\r\nobligation to define itself. It is not unlikely that she would have\r\naccepted any idea encased in this radiant formula--which was perhaps not\r\na formula; it was the _reductio ad absurdum_ of all formulas.\r\n\r\nThen eventually, but gorgeously, would come Dick\'s turn.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve heard of the new poetry movement. You haven\'t? Well, it\'s a lot\r\nof young poets that are breaking away from the old forms and doing a lot\r\nof good. Well, what I was going to say was that my book is going to\r\nstart a new prose movement, a sort of renaissance."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it will," beamed Mrs. Gilbert. "I\'m _sure_ it will. I went to\r\nJenny Martin last Tuesday, the palmist, you know, that every one\'s _mad_\r\nabout. I told her my nephew was engaged upon a work and she said she\r\nknew I\'d be glad to hear that his success would be _extraordinary_. But\r\nshe\'d never seen you or known anything about you--not even your _name_."\r\n\r\nHaving made the proper noises to express his amazement at this\r\nastounding phenomenon, Dick waved her theme by him as though he were an\r\narbitrary traffic policeman, and, so to speak, beckoned forward his\r\nown traffic.\r\n\r\n"I\'m absorbed, Aunt Catherine," he assured her, "I really am. All my\r\nfriends are joshing me--oh, I see the humor in it and I don\'t care. I\r\nthink a person ought to be able to take joshing. But I\'ve got a sort of\r\nconviction," he concluded gloomily.\r\n\r\n"You\'re an ancient soul, I always say."\r\n\r\n"Maybe I am." Dick had reached the stage where he no longer fought, but\r\nsubmitted. He _must_ be an ancient soul, he fancied grotesquely; so old\r\nas to be absolutely rotten. However, the reiteration of the phrase still\r\nsomewhat embarrassed him and sent uncomfortable shivers up his back. He\r\nchanged the subject.\r\n\r\n"Where is my distinguished cousin Gloria?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s on the go somewhere, with some one."\r\n\r\nDick paused, considered, and then, screwing up his face into what was\r\nevidently begun as a smile but ended as a terrifying frown, delivered\r\na comment.\r\n\r\n"I think my friend Anthony Patch is in love with her."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilbert started, beamed half a second too late, and breathed her\r\n"Really?" in the tone of a detective play-whisper.\r\n\r\n"I _think_ so," corrected Dick gravely. "She\'s the first girl I\'ve ever\r\nseen him with, so much."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course," said Mrs. Gilbert with meticulous carelessness,\r\n"Gloria never makes me her confidante. She\'s very secretive. Between you\r\nand me"--she bent forward cautiously, obviously determined that only\r\nHeaven and her nephew should share her confession--"between you and me,\r\nI\'d like to see her settle down."\r\n\r\nDick arose and paced the floor earnestly, a small, active, already\r\nrotund young man, his hands thrust unnaturally into his bulging pockets.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not claiming I\'m right, mind you," he assured the\r\ninfinitely-of-the-hotel steel-engraving which smirked respectably back\r\nat him. "I\'m saying nothing that I\'d want Gloria to know. But I think\r\nMad Anthony is interested--tremendously so. He talks about her\r\nconstantly. In any one else that\'d be a bad sign."\r\n\r\n"Gloria is a very young soul--" began Mrs. Gilbert eagerly, but her\r\nnephew interrupted with a hurried sentence:\r\n\r\n"Gloria\'d be a very young nut not to marry him." He stopped and faced\r\nher, his expression a battle map of lines and dimples, squeezed and\r\nstrained to its ultimate show of intensity--this as if to make up by his\r\nsincerity for any indiscretion in his words. "Gloria\'s a wild one, Aunt\r\nCatherine. She\'s uncontrollable. How she\'s done it I don\'t know, but\r\nlately she\'s picked up a lot of the funniest friends. She doesn\'t seem\r\nto care. And the men she used to go with around New York were--" He\r\npaused for breath.\r\n\r\n"Yes-yes-yes," interjected Mrs. Gilbert, with an anaemic attempt to hide\r\nthe immense interest with which she listened.\r\n\r\n"Well," continued Richard Caramel gravely, "there it is. I mean that the\r\nmen she went with and the people she went with used to be first rate.\r\nNow they aren\'t."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilbert blinked very fast--her bosom trembled, inflated, remained\r\nso for an instant, and with the exhalation her words flowed out in\r\na torrent.\r\n\r\nShe knew, she cried in a whisper; oh, yes, mothers see these things. But\r\nwhat could she do? He knew Gloria. He\'d seen enough of Gloria to know\r\nhow hopeless it was to try to deal with her. Gloria had been so\r\nspoiled--in a rather complete and unusual way. She had been suckled\r\nuntil she was three, for instance, when she could probably have chewed\r\nsticks. Perhaps--one never knew--it was this that had given that health\r\nand _hardiness_ to her whole personality. And then ever since she was\r\ntwelve years old she\'d had boys about her so thick--oh, so thick one\r\ncouldn\'t _move_. At sixteen she began going to dances at preparatory\r\nschools, and then came the colleges; and everywhere she went, boys,\r\nboys, boys. At first, oh, until she was eighteen there had been so many\r\nthat it never seemed one any more than the others, but then she began to\r\nsingle them out.\r\n\r\nShe knew there had been a string of affairs spread over about three\r\nyears, perhaps a dozen of them altogether. Sometimes the men were\r\nundergraduates, sometimes just out of college--they lasted on an average\r\nof several months each, with short attractions in between. Once or twice\r\nthey had endured longer and her mother had hoped she would be engaged,\r\nbut always a new one came--a new one--\r\n\r\nThe men? Oh, she made them miserable, literally! There was only one who\r\nhad kept any sort of dignity, and he had been a mere child, young Carter\r\nKirby, of Kansas City, who was so conceited anyway that he just sailed\r\nout on his vanity one afternoon and left for Europe next day with his\r\nfather. The others had been--wretched. They never seemed to know when\r\nshe was tired of them, and Gloria had seldom been deliberately unkind.\r\nThey would keep phoning, writing letters to her, trying to see her,\r\nmaking long trips after her around the country. Some of them had\r\nconfided in Mrs. Gilbert, told her with tears in their eyes that they\r\nwould never get over Gloria ... at least two of them had since married,\r\nthough.... But Gloria, it seemed, struck to kill--to this day Mr.\r\nCarstairs called up once a week, and sent her flowers which she no\r\nlonger bothered to refuse.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, twice, at least, Mrs. Gilbert knew it had gone as far as\r\na private engagement--with Tudor Baird and that Holcome boy at Pasadena.\r\nShe was sure it had, because--this must go no further--she had come in\r\nunexpectedly and found Gloria acting, well, very much engaged indeed.\r\nShe had not spoken to her daughter, of course. She had had a certain\r\nsense of delicacy and, besides, each time she had expected an\r\nannouncement in a few weeks. But the announcement never came; instead, a\r\nnew man came.\r\n\r\nScenes! Young men walking up and down the library like caged tigers!\r\nYoung men glaring at each other in the hall as one came and the other\r\nleft! Young men calling up on the telephone and being hung up upon in\r\ndesperation! Young men threatening South America! ... Young men writing\r\nthe most pathetic letters! (She said nothing to this effect, but Dick\r\nfancied that Mrs. Gilbert\'s eyes had seen some of these letters.)\r\n\r\n... And Gloria, between tears and laughter, sorry, glad, out of love and\r\nin love, miserable, nervous, cool, amidst a great returning of presents,\r\nsubstitution of pictures in immemorial frames, and taking of hot baths\r\nand beginning again--with the next.\r\n\r\nThat state of things continued, assumed an air of permanency. Nothing\r\nharmed Gloria or changed her or moved her. And then out of a clear sky\r\none day she informed her mother that undergraduates wearied her. She was\r\nabsolutely going to no more college dances.\r\n\r\nThis had begun the change--not so much in her actual habits, for she\r\ndanced, and had as many "dates" as ever--but they were dates in a\r\ndifferent spirit. Previously it had been a sort of pride, a matter of\r\nher own vainglory. She had been, probably, the most celebrated and\r\nsought-after young beauty in the country. Gloria Gilbert of Kansas City!\r\nShe had fed on it ruthlessly--enjoying the crowds around her, the manner\r\nin which the most desirable men singled her out; enjoying the fierce\r\njealousy of other girls; enjoying the fabulous, not to say scandalous,\r\nand, her mother was glad to say, entirely unfounded rumors about\r\nher--for instance, that she had gone in the Yale swimming-pool one night\r\nin a chiffon evening dress.\r\n\r\nAnd from loving it with a vanity that was almost masculine--it had been\r\nin the nature of a triumphant and dazzling career--she became suddenly\r\nanaesthetic to it. She retired. She who had dominated countless parties,\r\nwho had blown fragrantly through many ballrooms to the tender tribute of\r\nmany eyes, seemed to care no longer. He who fell in love with her now\r\nwas dismissed utterly, almost angrily. She went listlessly with the most\r\nindifferent men. She continually broke engagements, not as in the past\r\nfrom a cool assurance that she was irreproachable, that the man she\r\ninsulted would return like a domestic animal--but indifferently, without\r\ncontempt or pride. She rarely stormed at men any more--she yawned at\r\nthem. She seemed--and it was so strange--she seemed to her mother to be\r\ngrowing cold.\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel listened. At first he had remained standing, but as his\r\naunt\'s discourse waxed in content--it stands here pruned by half, of all\r\nside references to the youth of Gloria\'s soul and to Mrs. Gilbert\'s own\r\nmental distresses--he drew a chair up and attended rigorously as she\r\nfloated, between tears and plaintive helplessness, down the long story\r\nof Gloria\'s life. When she came to the tale of this last year, a tale of\r\nthe ends of cigarettes left all over New York in little trays marked\r\n"Midnight Frolic" and "Justine Johnson\'s Little Club," he began nodding\r\nhis head slowly, then faster and faster, until, as she finished on a\r\nstaccato note, it was bobbing briskly up and down, absurdly like a\r\ndoll\'s wired head, expressing--almost anything.\r\n\r\nIn a sense Gloria\'s past was an old story to him. He had followed it\r\nwith the eyes of a journalist, for he was going to write a book about\r\nher some day. But his interests, just at present, were family interests.\r\nHe wanted to know, in particular, who was this Joseph Bloeckman that he\r\nhad seen her with several times; and those two girls she was with\r\nconstantly, "this" Rachael Jerryl and "this" Miss Kane--surely Miss Kane\r\nwasn\'t exactly the sort one would associate with Gloria!\r\n\r\nBut the moment had passed. Mrs. Gilbert having climbed the hill of\r\nexposition was about to glide swiftly down the ski-jump of collapse. Her\r\neyes were like a blue sky seen through two round, red window-casements.\r\nThe flesh about her mouth was trembling.\r\n\r\nAnd at the moment the door opened, admitting into the room Gloria and\r\nthe two young ladies lately mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO YOUNG WOMEN\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Mrs. Gilbert!"\r\n\r\nMiss Kane and Miss Jerryl are presented to Mr. Richard Caramel. "This is\r\nDick" (laughter).\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard so much about you," says Miss Kane between a giggle and a\r\nshout.\r\n\r\n"How do you do," says Miss Jerryl shyly.\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel tries to move about as if his figure were better. He is\r\ntorn between his innate cordiality and the fact that he considers these\r\ngirls rather common--not at all the Farmover type.\r\n\r\nGloria has disappeared into the bedroom.\r\n\r\n"Do sit down," beams Mrs. Gilbert, who is by now quite herself. "Take\r\noff your things." Dick is afraid she will make some remark about the age\r\nof his soul, but he forgets his qualms in completing a conscientious,\r\nnovelist\'s examination of the two young women.\r\n\r\nMuriel Kane had originated in a rising family of East Orange. She was\r\nshort rather than small, and hovered audaciously between plumpness and\r\nwidth. Her hair was black and elaborately arranged. This, in conjunction\r\nwith her handsome, rather bovine eyes, and her over-red lips, combined\r\nto make her resemble Theda Bara, the prominent motion picture actress.\r\nPeople told her constantly that she was a "vampire," and she believed\r\nthem. She suspected hopefully that they were afraid of her, and she did\r\nher utmost under all circumstances to give the impression of danger. An\r\nimaginative man could see the red flag that she constantly carried,\r\nwaving it wildly, beseechingly--and, alas, to little spectacular avail.\r\nShe was also tremendously timely: she knew the latest songs, all the\r\nlatest songs--when one of them was played on the phonograph she would\r\nrise to her feet and rock her shoulders back and forth and snap her\r\nfingers, and if there was no music she would accompany herself\r\nby humming.\r\n\r\nHer conversation was also timely: "I don\'t care," she would say, "I\r\nshould worry and lose my figure"--and again: "I can\'t make my feet\r\nbehave when I hear that tune. Oh, baby!"\r\n\r\nHer finger-nails were too long and ornate, polished to a pink and\r\nunnatural fever. Her clothes were too tight, too stylish, too vivid, her\r\neyes too roguish, her smile too coy. She was almost pitifully\r\noveremphasized from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThe other girl was obviously a more subtle personality. She was an\r\nexquisitely dressed Jewess with dark hair and a lovely milky pallor. She\r\nseemed shy and vague, and these two qualities accentuated a rather\r\ndelicate charm that floated about her. Her family were "Episcopalians,"\r\nowned three smart women\'s shops along Fifth Avenue, and lived in a\r\nmagnificent apartment on Riverside Drive. It seemed to Dick, after a few\r\nmoments, that she was attempting to imitate Gloria--he wondered that\r\npeople invariably chose inimitable people to imitate.\r\n\r\n"We had the most _hectic_ time!" Muriel was exclaiming enthusiastically.\r\n"There was a crazy woman behind us on the bus. She was absitively,\r\nposolutely _nutty_! She kept talking to herself about something she\'d\r\nlike to do to somebody or something. I was _pet_rified, but Gloria\r\nsimply _wouldn\'t_ get off."\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilbert opened her mouth, properly awed.\r\n\r\n"Really?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she was crazy. But we should worry, she didn\'t hurt us. Ugly!\r\nGracious! The man across from us said her face ought to be on a\r\nnight-nurse in a home for the blind, and we all _howled_, naturally, so\r\nthe man tried to pick us up."\r\n\r\nPresently Gloria emerged from her bedroom and in unison every eye turned\r\non her. The two girls receded into a shadowy background,\r\nunperceived, unmissed.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been talking about you," said Dick quickly, "--your mother and\r\nI."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Gloria.\r\n\r\nA pause--Muriel turned to Dick.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a great writer, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a writer," he confessed sheepishly.\r\n\r\n"I always say," said Muriel earnestly, "that if I ever had time to write\r\ndown all my experiences it\'d make a wonderful book."\r\n\r\nRachael giggled sympathetically; Richard Caramel\'s bow was almost\r\nstately. Muriel continued:\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t see how you can sit down and do it. And poetry! Lordy, I\r\ncan\'t make two lines rhyme. Well, I should worry!"\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel with difficulty restrained a shout of laughter. Gloria\r\nwas chewing an amazing gum-drop and staring moodily out the window. Mrs.\r\nGilbert cleared her throat and beamed.\r\n\r\n"But you see," she said in a sort of universal exposition, "you\'re not\r\nan ancient soul--like Richard."\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Soul breathed a gasp of relief--it was out at last.\r\n\r\nThen as if she had been considering it for five minutes, Gloria made a\r\nsudden announcement:\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to give a party."\r\n\r\n"Oh, can I come?" cried Muriel with facetious daring.\r\n\r\n"A dinner. Seven people: Muriel and Rachael and I, and you, Dick, and\r\nAnthony, and that man named Noble--I liked him--and Bloeckman."\r\n\r\nMuriel and Rachael went into soft and purring ecstasies of enthusiasm.\r\nMrs. Gilbert blinked and beamed. With an air of casualness Dick broke in\r\nwith a question:\r\n\r\n"Who is this fellow Bloeckman, Gloria?"\r\n\r\nScenting a faint hostility, Gloria turned to him.\r\n\r\n"Joseph Bloeckman? He\'s the moving picture man. Vice-president of \'Films\r\nPar Excellence.\' He and father do a lot of business."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"Well, will you all come?"\r\n\r\nThey would all come. A date was arranged within the week. Dick rose,\r\nadjusted hat, coat, and muffler, and gave out a general smile.\r\n\r\n"By-by," said Muriel, waving her hand gaily, "call me up some time."\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel blushed for her.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPLORABLE END OF THE CHEVALIER O\'KEEFE\r\n\r\nIt was Monday and Anthony took Geraldine Burke to luncheon at the Beaux\r\nArts--afterward they went up to his apartment and he wheeled out the\r\nlittle rolling-table that held his supply of liquor, selecting vermouth,\r\ngin, and absinthe for a proper stimulant.\r\n\r\nGeraldine Burke, usher at Keith\'s, had been an amusement of several\r\nmonths. She demanded so little that he liked her, for since a lamentable\r\naffair with a debutante the preceding summer, when he had discovered\r\nthat after half a dozen kisses a proposal was expected, he had been wary\r\nof girls of his own class. It was only too easy to turn a critical eye\r\non their imperfections: some physical harshness or a general lack of\r\npersonal delicacy--but a girl who was usher at Keith\'s was approached\r\nwith a different attitude. One could tolerate qualities in an intimate\r\nvalet that would be unforgivable in a mere acquaintance on one\'s\r\nsocial level.\r\n\r\nGeraldine, curled up at the foot of the lounge, considered him with\r\nnarrow slanting eyes.\r\n\r\n"You drink all the time, don\'t you?" she said suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Why, I suppose so," replied Anthony in some surprise. "Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Nope. I go on parties sometimes--you know, about once a week, but I\r\nonly take two or three drinks. You and your friends keep on drinking all\r\nthe time. I should think you\'d ruin your health."\r\n\r\nAnthony was somewhat touched.\r\n\r\n"Why, aren\'t you sweet to worry about me!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I do."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t drink so very much," he declared. "Last month I didn\'t touch a\r\ndrop for three weeks. And I only get really tight about once a week."\r\n\r\n"But you have something to drink every day and you\'re only twenty-five.\r\nHaven\'t you any ambition? Think what you\'ll be at forty?"\r\n\r\n"I sincerely trust that I won\'t live that long."\r\n\r\nShe clicked her tongue with her teeth.\r\n\r\n"You cra-azy!" she said as he mixed another cocktail--and then: "Are you\r\nany relation to Adam Patch?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he\'s my grandfather."\r\n\r\n"Really?" She was obviously thrilled.\r\n\r\n"Absolutely."\r\n\r\n"That\'s funny. My daddy used to work for him."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a queer old man."\r\n\r\n"Is he nice?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"Well, in private life he\'s seldom unnecessarily disagreeable."\r\n\r\n"Tell us about him."\r\n\r\n"Why," Anthony considered "--he\'s all shrunken up and he\'s got the\r\nremains of some gray hair that always looks as though the wind were in\r\nit. He\'s very moral."\r\n\r\n"He\'s done a lot of good," said Geraldine with intense gravity.\r\n\r\n"Rot!" scoffed Anthony. "He\'s a pious ass--a chickenbrain."\r\n\r\nHer mind left the subject and flitted on.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you live with him?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t I board in a Methodist parsonage?"\r\n\r\n"You cra-azy!"\r\n\r\nAgain she made a little clicking sound to express disapproval. Anthony\r\nthought how moral was this little waif at heart--how completely moral\r\nshe would still be after the inevitable wave came that would wash her\r\noff the sands of respectability.\r\n\r\n"Do you hate him?"\r\n\r\n"I wonder. I never liked him. You never like people who do things for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Does he hate you?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Geraldine," protested Anthony, frowning humorously, "do have\r\nanother cocktail. I annoy him. If I smoke a cigarette he comes into the\r\nroom sniffing. He\'s a prig, a bore, and something of a hypocrite. I\r\nprobably wouldn\'t be telling you this if I hadn\'t had a few drinks, but\r\nI don\'t suppose it matters."\r\n\r\nGeraldine was persistently interested. She held her glass, untasted,\r\nbetween finger and thumb and regarded him with eyes in which there was a\r\ntouch of awe.\r\n\r\n"How do you mean a hypocrite?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Anthony impatiently, "maybe he\'s not. But he doesn\'t like\r\nthe things that I like, and so, as far as I\'m concerned, he\'s\r\nuninteresting."\r\n\r\n"Hm." Her curiosity seemed, at length, satisfied. She sank back into the\r\nsofa and sipped her cocktail.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a funny one," she commented thoughtfully. "Does everybody want\r\nto marry you because your grandfather is rich?"\r\n\r\n"They don\'t--but I shouldn\'t blame them if they did. Still, you see, I\r\nnever intend to marry."\r\n\r\nShe scorned this.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll fall in love someday. Oh, you will--I know." She nodded wisely.\r\n\r\n"It\'d be idiotic to be overconfident. That\'s what ruined the Chevalier\r\nO\'Keefe."\r\n\r\n"Who was he?"\r\n\r\n"A creature of my splendid mind. He\'s my one creation, the Chevalier."\r\n\r\n"Cra-a-azy!" she murmured pleasantly, using the clumsy rope ladder with\r\nwhich she bridged all gaps and climbed after her mental superiors.\r\nSubconsciously she felt that it eliminated distances and brought the\r\nperson whose imagination had eluded her back within range.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" objected Anthony, "oh, no, Geraldine. You mustn\'t play the\r\nalienist upon the Chevalier. If you feel yourself unable to understand\r\nhim I won\'t bring him in. Besides, I should feel a certain uneasiness\r\nbecause of his regrettable reputation."\r\n\r\n"I guess I can understand anything that\'s got any sense to it," answered\r\nGeraldine a bit testily.\r\n\r\n"In that case there are various episodes in the life of the Chevalier\r\nwhich might prove diverting."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"It was his untimely end that caused me to think of him and made him\r\napropos in the conversation. I hate to introduce him end foremost, but\r\nit seems inevitable that the Chevalier must back into your life."\r\n\r\n"Well, what about him? Did he die?"\r\n\r\n"He did! In this manner. He was an Irishman, Geraldine, a semi-fictional\r\nIrishman--the wild sort with a genteel brogue and \'reddish hair.\' He was\r\nexiled from Erin in the late days of chivalry and, of course, crossed\r\nover to France. Now the Chevalier O\'Keefe, Geraldine, had, like me, one\r\nweakness. He was enormously susceptible to all sorts and conditions of\r\nwomen. Besides being a sentimentalist he was a romantic, a vain fellow,\r\na man of wild passions, a little blind in one eye and almost stone-blind\r\nin the other. Now a male roaming the world in this condition is as\r\nhelpless as a lion without teeth, and in consequence the Chevalier was\r\nmade utterly miserable for twenty years by a series of women who hated\r\nhim, used him, bored him, aggravated him, sickened him, spent his money,\r\nmade a fool of him--in brief, as the world has it, loved him.\r\n\r\n"This was bad, Geraldine, and as the Chevalier, save for this one\r\nweakness, this exceeding susceptibility, was a man of penetration, he\r\ndecided that he would rescue himself once and for all from these drains\r\nupon him. With this purpose he went to a very famous monastery in\r\nChampagne called--well, anachronistically known as St. Voltaire\'s. It\r\nwas the rule at St. Voltaire\'s that no monk could descend to the ground\r\nstory of the monastery so long as he lived, but should exist engaged in\r\nprayer and contemplation in one of the four towers, which were called\r\nafter the four commandments of the monastery rule: Poverty, Chastity,\r\nObedience, and Silence.\r\n\r\n"When the day came that was to witness the Chevalier\'s farewell to the\r\nworld he was utterly happy. He gave all his Greek books to his landlady,\r\nand his sword he sent in a golden sheath to the King of France, and all\r\nhis mementos of Ireland he gave to the young Huguenot who sold fish in\r\nthe street where he lived.\r\n\r\n"Then he rode out to St. Voltaire\'s, slew his horse at the door, and\r\npresented the carcass to the monastery cook.\r\n\r\n"At five o\'clock that night he felt, for the first time, free--forever\r\nfree from sex. No woman could enter the monastery; no monk could descend\r\nbelow the second story. So as he climbed the winding stair that led to\r\nhis cell at the very top of the Tower of Chastity he paused for a moment\r\nby an open window which looked down fifty feet on to a road below. It\r\nwas all so beautiful, he thought, this world that he was leaving, the\r\ngolden shower of sun beating down upon the long fields, the spray of\r\ntrees in the distance, the vineyards, quiet and green, freshening wide\r\nmiles before him. He leaned his elbows on the window casement and gazed\r\nat the winding road.\r\n\r\n"Now, as it happened, Therese, a peasant girl of sixteen from a\r\nneighboring village, was at that moment passing along this same road\r\nthat ran in front of the monastery. Five minutes before, the little\r\npiece of ribbon which held up the stocking on her pretty left leg had\r\nworn through and broken. Being a girl of rare modesty she had thought to\r\nwait until she arrived home before repairing it, but it had bothered her\r\nto such an extent that she felt she could endure it no longer. So, as\r\nshe passed the Tower of Chastity, she stopped and with a pretty gesture\r\nlifted her skirt--as little as possible, be it said to her credit--to\r\nadjust her garter.\r\n\r\n"Up in the tower the newest arrival in the ancient monastery of St.\r\nVoltaire, as though pulled forward by a gigantic and irresistible hand,\r\nleaned from the window. Further he leaned and further until suddenly one\r\nof the stones loosened under his weight, broke from its cement with a\r\nsoft powdery sound--and, first headlong, then head over heels, finally\r\nin a vast and impressive revolution tumbled the Chevalier O\'Keefe, bound\r\nfor the hard earth and eternal damnation.\r\n\r\n"Therese was so much upset by the occurrence that she ran all the way\r\nhome and for ten years spent an hour a day in secret prayer for the soul\r\nof the monk whose neck and vows were simultaneously broken on that\r\nunfortunate Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\n"And the Chevalier O\'Keefe, being suspected of suicide, was not buried\r\nin consecrated ground, but tumbled into a field near by, where he\r\ndoubtless improved the quality of the soil for many years afterward.\r\nSuch was the untimely end of a very brave and gallant gentleman. What do\r\nyou think, Geraldine?"\r\n\r\nBut Geraldine, lost long before, could only smile roguishly, wave her\r\nfirst finger at him, and repeat her bridge-all, her explain-all:\r\n\r\n"Crazy!" she said, "you cra-a-azy!"\r\n\r\nHis thin face was kindly, she thought, and his eyes quite gentle. She\r\nliked him because he was arrogant without being conceited, and because,\r\nunlike the men she met about the theatre, he had a horror of being\r\nconspicuous. What an odd, pointless story! But she had enjoyed the part\r\nabout the stocking!\r\n\r\nAfter the fifth cocktail he kissed her, and between laughter and\r\nbantering caresses and a half-stifled flare of passion they passed an\r\nhour. At four-thirty she claimed an engagement, and going into the\r\nbathroom she rearranged her hair. Refusing to let him order her a taxi\r\nshe stood for a moment in the doorway.\r\n\r\n"You _will_ get married," she was insisting, "you wait and see."\r\n\r\nAnthony was playing with an ancient tennis ball, and he bounced it\r\ncarefully on the floor several times before he answered with a soupcon\r\nof acidity:\r\n\r\n"You\'re a little idiot, Geraldine."\r\n\r\nShe smiled provokingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am, am I? Want to bet?"\r\n\r\n"That\'d be silly too."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it would, would it? Well, I\'ll just bet you\'ll marry somebody\r\ninside of a year."\r\n\r\nAnthony bounced the tennis ball very hard. This was one of his handsome\r\ndays, she thought; a sort of intensity had displaced the melancholy in\r\nhis dark eyes.\r\n\r\n"Geraldine," he said, at length, "in the first place I have no one I\r\nwant to marry; in the second place I haven\'t enough money to support two\r\npeople; in the third place I am entirely opposed to marriage for people\r\nof my type; in the fourth place I have a strong distaste for even the\r\nabstract consideration of it."\r\n\r\nBut Geraldine only narrowed her eyes knowingly, made her clicking sound,\r\nand said she must be going. It was late.\r\n\r\n"Call me up soon," she reminded him as he kissed her goodbye, "you\r\nhaven\'t for three weeks, you know."\r\n\r\n"I will," he promised fervently.\r\n\r\nHe shut the door and coming back into the room stood for a moment lost\r\nin thought with the tennis ball still clasped in his hand. There was one\r\nof his lonelinesses coming, one of those times when he walked the\r\nstreets or sat, aimless and depressed, biting a pencil at his desk. It\r\nwas a self-absorption with no comfort, a demand for expression with no\r\noutlet, a sense of time rushing by, ceaselessly and wastefully--assuaged\r\nonly by that conviction that there was nothing to waste, because all\r\nefforts and attainments were equally valueless.\r\n\r\nHe thought with emotion--aloud, ejaculative, for he was hurt and\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\n"No _idea_ of getting married, by _God_!"\r\n\r\nOf a sudden he hurled the tennis ball violently across the room, where\r\nit barely missed the lamp, and, rebounding here and there for a moment,\r\nlay still upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT\r\n\r\nFor her dinner Gloria had taken a table in the Cascades at the Biltmore,\r\nand when the men met in the hall outside a little after eight, "that\r\nperson Bloeckman" was the target of six masculine eyes. He was a\r\nstoutening, ruddy Jew of about thirty-five, with an expressive face\r\nunder smooth sandy hair--and, no doubt, in most business gatherings his\r\npersonality would have been considered ingratiating. He sauntered up to\r\nthe three younger men, who stood in a group smoking as they waited for\r\ntheir hostess, and introduced himself with a little too evident\r\nassurance--nevertheless it is to be doubted whether he received the\r\nintended impression of faint and ironic chill: there was no hint of\r\nunderstanding in his manner.\r\n\r\n"You related to Adam J. Patch?" he inquired of Anthony, emitting two\r\nslender strings of smoke from nostrils overwide.\r\n\r\nAnthony admitted it with the ghost of a smile.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a fine man," pronounced Bloeckman profoundly. "He\'s a fine example\r\nof an American."\r\n\r\n"Yes," agreed Anthony, "he certainly is."\r\n\r\n--I detest these underdone men, he thought coldly. Boiled looking! Ought\r\nto be shoved back in the oven; just one more minute would do it.\r\n\r\nBloeckman squinted at his watch.\r\n\r\n"Time these girls were showing up ..."\r\n\r\n--Anthony waited breathlessly; it came--\r\n\r\n"... but then," with a widening smile, "you know how women are."\r\n\r\nThe three young men nodded; Bloeckman looked casually about him, his\r\neyes resting critically on the ceiling and then passing lower. His\r\nexpression combined that of a Middle Western farmer appraising his wheat\r\ncrop and that of an actor wondering whether he is observed--the public\r\nmanner of all good Americans. As he finished his survey he turned back\r\nquickly to the reticent trio, determined to strike to their very\r\nheart and core.\r\n\r\n"You college men? ... Harvard, eh. I see the Princeton boys beat you\r\nfellows in hockey."\r\n\r\nUnfortunate man. He had drawn another blank. They had been three years\r\nout and heeded only the big football games. Whether, after the failure\r\nof this sally, Mr. Bloeckman would have perceived himself to be in a\r\ncynical atmosphere is problematical, for--\r\n\r\nGloria arrived. Muriel arrived. Rachael arrived. After a hurried "Hello,\r\npeople!" uttered by Gloria and echoed by the other two, the three swept\r\nby into the dressing room.\r\n\r\nA moment later Muriel appeared in a state of elaborate undress and\r\n_crept_ toward them. She was in her element: her ebony hair was slicked\r\nstraight back on her head; her eyes were artificially darkened; she\r\nreeked of insistent perfume. She was got up to the best of her ability\r\nas a siren, more popularly a "vamp"--a picker up and thrower away of\r\nmen, an unscrupulous and fundamentally unmoved toyer with affections.\r\nSomething in the exhaustiveness of her attempt fascinated Maury at first\r\nsight--a woman with wide hips affecting a panther-like litheness! As\r\nthey waited the extra three minutes for Gloria, and, by polite\r\nassumption, for Rachael, he was unable to take his eyes from her. She\r\nwould turn her head away, lowering her eyelashes and biting her nether\r\nlip in an amazing exhibition of coyness. She would rest her hands on her\r\nhips and sway from side to side in tune to the music, saying:\r\n\r\n"Did you ever hear such perfect ragtime? I just can\'t make my shoulders\r\nbehave when I hear that."\r\n\r\nMr. Bloeckman clapped his hands gallantly.\r\n\r\n"You ought to be on the stage."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to be!" cried Muriel; "will you back me?"\r\n\r\n"I sure will."\r\n\r\nWith becoming modesty Muriel ceased her motions and turned to Maury,\r\nasking what he had "seen" this year. He interpreted this as referring to\r\nthe dramatic world, and they had a gay and exhilarating exchange of\r\ntitles, after this manner:\r\n\r\nMURIEL: Have you seen "Peg o\' My Heart"?\r\n\r\nMAURY: No, I haven\'t.\r\n\r\nMURIEL: (_Eagerly_) It\'s wonderful! You want to see it.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Have you seen "Omar, the Tentmaker"?\r\n\r\nMURIEL: No, but I hear it\'s wonderful. I\'m very anxious to see it. Have\r\nyou seen "Fair and Warmer"?\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_Hopefully_) Yes.\r\n\r\nMURIEL: I don\'t think it\'s very good. It\'s trashy.\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_Faintly_) Yes, that\'s true.\r\n\r\nMURIEL: But I went to "Within the Law" last night and I thought it was\r\nfine. Have you seen "The Little Cafe"?...\r\n\r\nThis continued until they ran out of plays. Dick, meanwhile, turned to\r\nMr. Bloeckman, determined to extract what gold he could from this\r\nunpromising load.\r\n\r\n"I hear all the new novels are sold to the moving pictures as soon as\r\nthey come out."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. Of course the main thing in a moving picture is a strong\r\nstory."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"So many novels are all full of talk and psychology. Of course those\r\naren\'t as valuable to us. It\'s impossible to make much of that\r\ninteresting on the screen."\r\n\r\n"You want plots first," said Richard brilliantly.\r\n\r\n"Of course. Plots first--" He paused, shifted his gaze. His pause\r\nspread, included the others with all the authority of a warning finger.\r\nGloria followed by Rachael was coming out of the dressing room.\r\n\r\nAmong other things it developed during dinner that Joseph Bloeckman\r\nnever danced, but spent the music time watching the others with the\r\nbored tolerance of an elder among children. He was a dignified man and a\r\nproud one. Born in Munich he had begun his American career as a peanut\r\nvender with a travelling circus. At eighteen he was a side show\r\nballyhoo; later, the manager of the side show, and, soon after, the\r\nproprietor of a second-class vaudeville house. Just when the moving\r\npicture had passed out of the stage of a curiosity and become a\r\npromising industry he was an ambitious young man of twenty-six with some\r\nmoney to invest, nagging financial ambitions and a good working\r\nknowledge of the popular show business. That had been nine years before.\r\nThe moving picture industry had borne him up with it where it threw off\r\ndozens of men with more financial ability, more imagination, and more\r\npractical ideas...and now he sat here and contemplated the immortal\r\nGloria for whom young Stuart Holcome had gone from New York to\r\nPasadena--watched her, and knew that presently she would cease dancing\r\nand come back to sit on his left hand.\r\n\r\nHe hoped she would hurry. The oysters had been standing some minutes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Anthony, who had been placed on Gloria\'s left hand, was\r\ndancing with her, always in a certain fourth of the floor. This, had\r\nthere been stags, would have been a delicate tribute to the girl,\r\nmeaning "Damn you, don\'t cut in!" It was very consciously intimate.\r\n\r\n"Well," he began, looking down at her, "you look mighty sweet to-night."\r\n\r\nShe met his eyes over the horizontal half foot that separated them.\r\n\r\n"Thank you--Anthony."\r\n\r\n"In fact you\'re uncomfortably beautiful," he added. There was no smile\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n"And you\'re very charming."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t this nice?" he laughed. "We actually approve of each other."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you, usually?" She had caught quickly at his remark, as she\r\nalways did at any unexplained allusion to herself, however faint.\r\n\r\nHe lowered his voice, and when he spoke there was in it no more than a\r\nwisp of badinage.\r\n\r\n"Does a priest approve the Pope?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--but that\'s probably the vaguest compliment I ever\r\nreceived."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I can muster a few bromides."\r\n\r\n"Well, I wouldn\'t have you strain yourself. Look at Muriel! Right here\r\nnext to us."\r\n\r\nHe glanced over his shoulder. Muriel was resting her brilliant cheek\r\nagainst the lapel of Maury Noble\'s dinner coat and her powdered left arm\r\nwas apparently twisted around his head. One was impelled to wonder why\r\nshe failed to seize the nape of his neck with her hand. Her eyes, turned\r\nceiling-ward, rolled largely back and forth; her hips swayed, and as she\r\ndanced she kept up a constant low singing. This at first seemed to be a\r\ntranslation of the song into some foreign tongue but became eventually\r\napparent as an attempt to fill out the metre of the song with the only\r\nwords she knew--the words of the title--\r\n\r\n"He\'s a rag-picker,\r\nA rag-picker;\r\nA rag-time picking man,\r\nRag-picking, picking, pick, pick,\r\nRag-pick, pick, pick."\r\n\r\n--and so on, into phrases still more strange and barbaric. When she\r\ncaught the amused glances of Anthony and Gloria she acknowledged them\r\nonly with a faint smile and a half-closing of her eyes, to indicate that\r\nthe music entering into her soul had put her into an ecstatic and\r\nexceedingly seductive trance.\r\n\r\nThe music ended and they returned to their table, whose solitary but\r\ndignified occupant arose and tendered each of them a smile so\r\ningratiating that it was as if he were shaking their hands and\r\ncongratulating them on a brilliant performance.\r\n\r\n"Blockhead never will dance! I think he has a wooden leg," remarked\r\nGloria to the table at large. The three young men started and the\r\ngentleman referred to winced perceptibly.\r\n\r\nThis was the one rough spot in the course of Bloeckman\'s acquaintance\r\nwith Gloria. She relentlessly punned on his name. First it had been\r\n"Block-house." lately, the more invidious "Blockhead." He had requested\r\nwith a strong undertone of irony that she use his first name, and this\r\nshe had done obediently several times--then slipping, helpless,\r\nrepentant but dissolved in laughter, back into "Blockhead."\r\n\r\nIt was a very sad and thoughtless thing.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid Mr. Bloeckman thinks we\'re a frivolous crowd," sighed\r\nMuriel, waving a balanced oyster in his direction.\r\n\r\n"He has that air," murmured Rachael. Anthony tried to remember whether\r\nshe had said anything before. He thought not. It was her initial remark.\r\n\r\nMr. Bloeckman suddenly cleared his throat and said in a loud, distinct\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n"On the contrary. When a man speaks he\'s merely tradition. He has at\r\nbest a few thousand years back of him. But woman, why, she is the\r\nmiraculous mouthpiece of posterity."\r\n\r\nIn the stunned pause that followed this astounding remark, Anthony\r\nchoked suddenly on an oyster and hurried his napkin to his face. Rachael\r\nand Muriel raised a mild if somewhat surprised laugh, in which Dick and\r\nMaury joined, both of them red in the face and restraining\r\nuproariousness with the most apparent difficulty.\r\n\r\n"--My God!" thought Anthony. "It\'s a subtitle from one of his movies.\r\nThe man\'s memorized it!"\r\n\r\nGloria alone made no sound. She fixed Mr. Bloeckman with a glance of\r\nsilent reproach.\r\n\r\n"Well, for the love of Heaven! Where on earth did you dig that up?"\r\n\r\nBloeckman looked at her uncertainly, not sure of her intention. But in a\r\nmoment he recovered his poise and assumed the bland and consciously\r\ntolerant smile of an intellectual among spoiled and callow youth.\r\n\r\nThe soup came up from the kitchen--but simultaneously the orchestra\r\nleader came up from the bar, where he had absorbed the tone color\r\ninherent in a seidel of beer. So the soup was left to cool during the\r\ndelivery of a ballad entitled "Everything\'s at Home Except Your Wife."\r\n\r\nThen the champagne--and the party assumed more amusing proportions. The\r\nmen, except Richard Caramel, drank freely; Gloria and Muriel sipped a\r\nglass apiece; Rachael Jerryl took none. They sat out the waltzes but\r\ndanced to everything else--all except Gloria, who seemed to tire after a\r\nwhile and preferred to sit smoking at the table, her eyes now lazy, now\r\neager, according to whether she listened to Bloeckman or watched a\r\npretty woman among the dancers. Several times Anthony wondered what\r\nBloeckman was telling her. He was chewing a cigar back and forth in his\r\nmouth, and had expanded after dinner to the extent of violent gestures.\r\n\r\nTen o\'clock found Gloria and Anthony beginning a dance. Just as they\r\nwere out of ear-shot of the table she said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n"Dance over by the door. I want to go down to the drug-store."\r\n\r\nObediently Anthony guided her through the crowd in the designated\r\ndirection; in the hall she left him for a moment, to reappear with a\r\ncloak over her arm.\r\n\r\n"I want some gum-drops," she said, humorously apologetic; "you can\'t\r\nguess what for this time. It\'s just that I want to bite my finger-nails,\r\nand I will if I don\'t get some gum-drops." She sighed, and resumed as\r\nthey stepped into the empty elevator: "I\'ve been biting \'em all day. A\r\nbit nervous, you see. Excuse the pun. It was unintentional--the words\r\njust arranged themselves. Gloria Gilbert, the female wag."\r\n\r\nReaching the ground floor they naively avoided the hotel candy counter,\r\ndescended the wide front staircase, and walking through several\r\ncorridors found a drug-store in the Grand Central Station. After an\r\nintense examination of the perfume counter she made her purchase. Then\r\non some mutual unmentioned impulse they strolled, arm in arm, not in the\r\ndirection from which they had come, but out into Forty-third Street.\r\n\r\nThe night was alive with thaw; it was so nearly warm that a breeze\r\ndrifting low along the sidewalk brought to Anthony a vision of an\r\nunhoped-for hyacinthine spring. Above in the blue oblong of sky, around\r\nthem in the caress of the drifting air, the illusion of a new season\r\ncarried relief from the stiff and breathed-over atmosphere they had\r\nleft, and for a hushed moment the traffic sounds and the murmur of water\r\nflowing in the gutters seemed an illusive and rarefied prolongation of\r\nthat music to which they had lately danced. When Anthony spoke it was\r\nwith surety that his words came from something breathless and desirous\r\nthat the night had conceived in their two hearts.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s take a taxi and ride around a bit!" he suggested, without looking\r\nat her.\r\n\r\nOh, Gloria, Gloria!\r\n\r\nA cab yawned at the curb. As it moved off like a boat on a labyrinthine\r\nocean and lost itself among the inchoate night masses of the great\r\nbuildings, among the now stilled, now strident, cries and clangings,\r\nAnthony put his arm around the girl, drew her over to him and kissed her\r\ndamp, childish mouth.\r\n\r\nShe was silent. She turned her face up to him, pale under the wisps and\r\npatches of light that trailed in like moonshine through a foliage. Her\r\neyes were gleaming ripples in the white lake of her face; the shadows of\r\nher hair bordered the brow with a persuasive unintimate dusk. No love\r\nwas there, surely; nor the imprint of any love. Her beauty was cool as\r\nthis damp breeze, as the moist softness of her own lips.\r\n\r\n"You\'re such a swan in this light," he whispered after a moment. There\r\nwere silences as murmurous as sound. There were pauses that seemed about\r\nto shatter and were only to be snatched back to oblivion by the\r\ntightening of his arms about her and the sense that she was resting\r\nthere as a caught, gossamer feather, drifted in out of the dark. Anthony\r\nlaughed, noiselessly and exultantly, turning his face up and away from\r\nher, half in an overpowering rush of triumph, half lest her sight of him\r\nshould spoil the splendid immobility of her expression. Such a kiss--it\r\nwas a flower held against the face, never to be described, scarcely to\r\nbe remembered; as though her beauty were giving off emanations of itself\r\nwhich settled transiently and already dissolving upon his heart.\r\n\r\n... The buildings fell away in melted shadows; this was the Park now,\r\nand after a long while the great white ghost of the Metropolitan Museum\r\nmoved majestically past, echoing sonorously to the rush of the cab.\r\n\r\n"Why, Gloria! Why, Gloria!"\r\n\r\nHer eyes appeared to regard him out of many thousand years: all emotion\r\nshe might have felt, all words she might have uttered, would have seemed\r\ninadequate beside the adequacy of her silence, ineloquent against the\r\neloquence of her beauty--and of her body, close to him, slender\r\nand cool.\r\n\r\n"Tell him to turn around," she murmured, "and drive pretty fast going\r\nback...."\r\n\r\nUp in the supper room the air was hot. The table, littered with napkins\r\nand ash-trays, was old and stale. It was between dances as they entered,\r\nand Muriel Kane looked up with roguishness extraordinary.\r\n\r\n"Well, where have _you_ been?"\r\n\r\n"To call up mother," answered Gloria coolly. "I promised her I would.\r\nDid we miss a dance?"\r\n\r\nThen followed an incident that though slight in itself Anthony had cause\r\nto reflect on many years afterward. Joseph Bloeckman, leaning well back\r\nin his chair, fixed him with a peculiar glance, in which several\r\nemotions were curiously and inextricably mingled. He did not greet\r\nGloria except by rising, and he immediately resumed a conversation with\r\nRichard Caramel about the influence of literature on the\r\nmoving pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGIC\r\n\r\nThe stark and unexpected miracle of a night fades out with the lingering\r\ndeath of the last stars and the premature birth of the first newsboys.\r\nThe flame retreats to some remote and platonic fire; the white heat has\r\ngone from the iron and the glow from the coal.\r\n\r\nAlong the shelves of Anthony\'s library, filling a wall amply, crept a\r\nchill and insolent pencil of sunlight touching with frigid disapproval\r\nTherese of France and Ann the Superwoman, Jenny of the Orient Ballet and\r\nZuleika the Conjurer--and Hoosier Cora--then down a shelf and into the\r\nyears, resting pityingly on the over-invoked shades of Helen, Thais,\r\nSalome, and Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nAnthony, shaved and bathed, sat in his most deeply cushioned chair and\r\nwatched it until at the steady rising of the sun it lay glinting for a\r\nmoment on the silk ends of the rug--and went out.\r\n\r\nIt was ten o\'clock. The Sunday Times, scattered about his feet,\r\nproclaimed by rotogravure and editorial, by social revelation and\r\nsporting sheet, that the world had been tremendously engrossed during\r\nthe past week in the business of moving toward some splendid if somewhat\r\nindeterminate goal. For his part Anthony had been once to his\r\ngrandfather\'s, twice to his broker\'s, and three times to his\r\ntailor\'s--and in the last hour of the week\'s last day he had kissed a\r\nvery beautiful and charming girl.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home his imagination had been teeming with high pitched,\r\nunfamiliar dreams. There was suddenly no question on his mind, no\r\neternal problem for a solution and resolution. He had experienced an\r\nemotion that was neither mental nor physical, nor merely a mixture of\r\nthe two, and the love of life absorbed him for the present to the\r\nexclusion of all else. He was content to let the experiment remain\r\nisolated and unique. Almost impersonally he was convinced that no woman\r\nhe had ever met compared in any way with Gloria. She was deeply herself;\r\nshe was immeasurably sincere--of these things he was certain. Beside her\r\nthe two dozen schoolgirls and debutantes, young married women and waifs\r\nand strays whom he had known were so many females, in the word\'s most\r\ncontemptuous sense, breeders and bearers, exuding still that faintly\r\nodorous atmosphere of the cave and the nursery.\r\n\r\nSo far as he could see, she had neither submitted to any will of his nor\r\ncaressed his vanity--except as her pleasure in his company was a caress.\r\nIndeed he had no reason for thinking she had given him aught that she\r\ndid not give to others. This was as it should be. The idea of an\r\nentanglement growing out of the evening was as remote as it would have\r\nbeen repugnant. And she had disclaimed and buried the incident with a\r\ndecisive untruth. Here were two young people with fancy enough to\r\ndistinguish a game from its reality--who by the very casualness with\r\nwhich they met and passed on would proclaim themselves unharmed.\r\n\r\nHaving decided this he went to the phone and called up the Plaza Hotel.\r\n\r\nGloria was out. Her mother knew neither where she had gone nor when she\r\nwould return.\r\n\r\nIt was somehow at this point that the first wrongness in the case\r\nasserted itself. There was an element of callousness, almost of\r\nindecency, in Gloria\'s absence from home. He suspected that by going out\r\nshe had intrigued him into a disadvantage. Returning she would find his\r\nname, and smile. Most discreetly! He should have waited a few hours in\r\norder to drive home the utter inconsequence with which he regarded the\r\nincident. What an asinine blunder! She would think he considered himself\r\nparticularly favored. She would think he was reacting with the most\r\ninept intimacy to a quite trivial episode.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that during the previous month his janitor, to whom he had\r\ndelivered a rather muddled lecture on the "brother-hoove man," had come\r\nup next day and, on the basis of what had happened the night before,\r\nseated himself in the window seat for a cordial and chatty half-hour.\r\nAnthony wondered in horror if Gloria would regard him as he had regarded\r\nthat man. Him--Anthony Patch! Horror!\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to him that he was a passive thing, acted upon by an\r\ninfluence above and beyond Gloria, that he was merely the sensitive\r\nplate on which the photograph was made. Some gargantuan photographer had\r\nfocussed the camera on Gloria and _snap_!--the poor plate could but\r\ndevelop, confined like all things to its nature.\r\n\r\nBut Anthony, lying upon his couch and staring at the orange lamp, passed\r\nhis thin fingers incessantly through his dark hair and made new symbols\r\nfor the hours. She was in a shop now, it seemed, moving lithely among\r\nthe velvets and the furs, her own dress making, as she walked, a\r\ndebonair rustle in that world of silken rustles and cool soprano\r\nlaughter and scents of many slain but living flowers. The Minnies and\r\nPearls and jewels and jennies would gather round her like courtiers,\r\nbearing wispy frailties of Georgette crepe, delicate chiffon to echo her\r\ncheeks in faint pastel, milky lace to rest in pale disarray against her\r\nneck--damask was used but to cover priests and divans in these days, and\r\ncloth of Samarand was remembered only by the romantic poets.\r\n\r\nShe would go elsewhere after a while, tilting her head a hundred ways\r\nunder a hundred bonnets, seeking in vain for mock cherries to match her\r\nlips or plumes that were graceful as her own supple body.\r\n\r\nNoon would come--she would hurry along Fifth Avenue, a Nordic Ganymede,\r\nher fur coat swinging fashionably with her steps, her cheeks redder by a\r\nstroke of the wind\'s brush, her breath a delightful mist upon the\r\nbracing air--and the doors of the Ritz would revolve, the crowd would\r\ndivide, fifty masculine eyes would start, stare, as she gave back\r\nforgotten dreams to the husbands of many obese and comic women.\r\n\r\nOne o\'clock. With her fork she would tantalize the heart of an adoring\r\nartichoke, while her escort served himself up in the thick, dripping\r\nsentences of an enraptured man.\r\n\r\nFour o\'clock: her little feet moving to melody, her face distinct in the\r\ncrowd, her partner happy as a petted puppy and mad as the immemorial\r\nhatter.... Then--then night would come drifting down and perhaps another\r\ndamp. The signs would spill their light into the street. Who knew? No\r\nwiser than he, they haply sought to recapture that picture done in cream\r\nand shadow they had seen on the hushed Avenue the night before. And they\r\nmight, ah, they might! A thousand taxis would yawn at a thousand\r\ncorners, and only to him was that kiss forever lost and done. In a\r\nthousand guises Thais would hail a cab and turn up her face for loving.\r\nAnd her pallor would be virginal and lovely, and her kiss chaste as\r\nthe moon....\r\n\r\nHe sprang excitedly to his feet. How inappropriate that she should be\r\nout! He had realized at last what he wanted--to kiss her again, to find\r\nrest in her great immobility. She was the end of all restlessness, all\r\nmalcontent.\r\n\r\nAnthony dressed and went out, as he should have done long before, and\r\ndown to Richard Caramel\'s room to hear the last revision of the last\r\nchapter of "The Demon Lover." He did not call Gloria again until six. He\r\ndid not find her in until eight and--oh, climax of anticlimaxes!--she\r\ncould give him no engagement until Tuesday afternoon. A broken piece of\r\ngutta-percha clattered to the floor as he banged up the phone.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK MAGIC\r\n\r\nTuesday was freezing cold. He called at a bleak two o\'clock and as they\r\nshook hands he wondered confusedly whether he had ever kissed her; it\r\nwas almost unbelievable--he seriously doubted if she remembered it.\r\n\r\n"I called you four times on Sunday," he told her.\r\n\r\n"Did you?"\r\n\r\nThere was surprise in her voice and interest in her expression. Silently\r\nhe cursed himself for having told her. He might have known her pride did\r\nnot deal in such petty triumphs. Even then he had not guessed at the\r\ntruth--that never having had to worry about men she had seldom used the\r\nwary subterfuges, the playings out and haulings in, that were the stock\r\nin trade of her sisterhood. When she liked a man, that was trick enough.\r\nDid she think she loved him--there was an ultimate and fatal thrust. Her\r\ncharm endlessly preserved itself.\r\n\r\n"I was anxious to see you," he said simply. "I want to talk to you--I\r\nmean really talk, somewhere where we can be alone. May I?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\nHe swallowed a sudden lump of panic. He felt that she knew what he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n"I mean, not at a tea table," he said.\r\n\r\n"Well, all right, but not to-day. I want to get some exercise. Let\'s\r\nwalk!"\r\n\r\nIt was bitter and raw. All the evil hate in the mad heart of February\r\nwas wrought into the forlorn and icy wind that cut its way cruelly\r\nacross Central Park and down along Fifth Avenue. It was almost\r\nimpossible to talk, and discomfort made him distracted, so much so that\r\nhe turned at Sixty-first Street to find that she was no longer beside\r\nhim. He looked around. She was forty feet in the rear standing\r\nmotionless, her face half hidden in her fur coat collar, moved either by\r\nanger or laughter--he could not determine which. He started back.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let me interrupt your walk!" she called.\r\n\r\n"I\'m mighty sorry," he answered in confusion. "Did I go too fast?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m cold," she announced. "I want to go home. And you walk too fast."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry."\r\n\r\nSide by side they started for the Plaza. He wished he could see her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Men don\'t usually get so absorbed in themselves when they\'re with me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very interesting."\r\n\r\n"It _is_ rather too cold to walk," he said, briskly, to hide his\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer and he wondered if she would dismiss him at the hotel\r\nentrance. She walked in without speaking, however, and to the elevator,\r\nthrowing him a single remark as she entered it:\r\n\r\n"You\'d better come up."\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for the fraction of a moment.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I\'d better call some other time."\r\n\r\n"Just as you say." Her words were murmured as an aside. The main concern\r\nof life was the adjusting of some stray wisps of hair in the elevator\r\nmirror. Her cheeks were brilliant, her eyes sparkled--she had never\r\nseemed so lovely, so exquisitely to be desired.\r\n\r\nDespising himself, he found that he was walking down the tenth-floor\r\ncorridor a subservient foot behind her; was in the sitting room while\r\nshe disappeared to shed her furs. Something had gone wrong--in his own\r\neyes he had lost a shred of dignity; in an unpremeditated yet\r\nsignificant encounter he had been completely defeated.\r\n\r\nHowever, by the time she reappeared in the sitting-room he had explained\r\nhimself to himself with sophistic satisfaction. After all he had done\r\nthe strongest thing, he thought. He had wanted to come up, he had come.\r\nYet what happened later on that afternoon must be traced to the\r\nindignity he had experienced in the elevator; the girl was worrying him\r\nintolerably, so much so that when she came out he involuntarily drifted\r\ninto criticism.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s this Bloeckman, Gloria?"\r\n\r\n"A business friend of father\'s."\r\n\r\n"Odd sort of fellow!"\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t like you either," she said with a sudden smile.\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m flattered at his notice. He evidently considers me a--" He broke\r\noff with "Is he in love with you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"The deuce you don\'t," he insisted. "Of course he is. I remember the\r\nlook he gave me when we got back to the table. He\'d probably have had me\r\nquietly assaulted by a delegation of movie supes if you hadn\'t invented\r\nthat phone call."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t mind. I told him afterward what really happened."\r\n\r\n"You told him!"\r\n\r\n"He asked me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like that very well," he remonstrated.\r\n\r\nShe laughed again.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you don\'t?"\r\n\r\n"What business is it of his?"\r\n\r\n"None. That\'s why I told him."\r\n\r\nAnthony in a turmoil bit savagely at his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Why should I lie?" she demanded directly. "I\'m not ashamed of anything\r\nI do. It happened to interest him to know that I kissed you, and I\r\nhappened to be in a good humor, so I satisfied his curiosity by a simple\r\nand precise \'yes.\' Being rather a sensible man, after his fashion, he\r\ndropped the subject."\r\n\r\n"Except to say that he hated me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it worries you? Well, if you must probe this stupendous matter to\r\nits depths he didn\'t say he hated you. I simply know he does."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t wor----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, let\'s drop it!" she cried spiritedly. "It\'s a most uninteresting\r\nmatter to me."\r\n\r\nWith a tremendous effort Anthony made his acquiescence a twist of\r\nsubject, and they drifted into an ancient question-and-answer game\r\nconcerned with each other\'s pasts, gradually warming as they discovered\r\nthe age-old, immemorial resemblances in tastes and ideas. They said\r\nthings that were more revealing than they intended--but each pretended\r\nto accept the other at face, or rather word, value.\r\n\r\nThe growth of intimacy is like that. First one gives off his best\r\npicture, the bright and finished product mended with bluff and falsehood\r\nand humor. Then more details are required and one paints a second\r\nportrait, and a third--before long the best lines cancel out--and the\r\nsecret is exposed at last; the planes of the pictures have intermingled\r\nand given us away, and though we paint and paint we can no longer sell a\r\npicture. We must be satisfied with hoping that such fatuous accounts of\r\nourselves as we make to our wives and children and business associates\r\nare accepted as true.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," Anthony was saying earnestly, "that the position of a\r\nman with neither necessity nor ambition is unfortunate. Heaven knows\r\nit\'d be pathetic of me to be sorry for myself--yet, sometimes I\r\nenvy Dick."\r\n\r\nHer silence was encouragement. It was as near as she ever came to an\r\nintentional lure.\r\n\r\n"--And there used to be dignified occupations for a gentleman who had\r\nleisure, things a little more constructive than filling up the landscape\r\nwith smoke or juggling some one else\'s money. There\'s science, of\r\ncourse: sometimes I wish I\'d taken a good foundation, say at Boston\r\nTech. But now, by golly, I\'d have to sit down for two years and struggle\r\nthrough the fundamentals of physics and chemistry."\r\n\r\nShe yawned.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve told you I don\'t know what anybody ought to do," she said\r\nungraciously, and at her indifference his rancor was born again.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you interested in anything except yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Not much."\r\n\r\nHe glared; his growing enjoyment in the conversation was ripped to\r\nshreds. She had been irritable and vindictive all day, and it seemed to\r\nhim that for this moment he hated her hard selfishness. He stared\r\nmorosely at the fire.\r\n\r\nThen a strange thing happened. She turned to him and smiled, and as he\r\nsaw her smile every rag of anger and hurt vanity dropped from him--as\r\nthough his very moods were but the outer ripples of her own, as though\r\nemotion rose no longer in his breast unless she saw fit to pull an\r\nomnipotent controlling thread.\r\n\r\nHe moved closer and taking her hand pulled her ever so gently toward him\r\nuntil she half lay against his shoulder. She smiled up at him as he\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\n"Gloria," he whispered very softly. Again she had made a magic, subtle\r\nand pervading as a spilt perfume, irresistible and sweet.\r\n\r\nAfterward, neither the next day nor after many years, could he remember\r\nthe important things of that afternoon. Had she been moved? In his arms\r\nhad she spoken a little--or at all? What measure of enjoyment had she\r\ntaken in his kisses? And had she at any time lost herself ever\r\nso little?\r\n\r\nOh, for him there was no doubt. He had risen and paced the floor in\r\nsheer ecstasy. That such a girl should be; should poise curled in a\r\ncorner of the couch like a swallow newly landed from a clean swift\r\nflight, watching him with inscrutable eyes. He would stop his pacing\r\nand, half shy each time at first, drop his arm around her and find\r\nher kiss.\r\n\r\nShe was fascinating, he told her. He had never met any one like her\r\nbefore. He besought her jauntily but earnestly to send him away; he\r\ndidn\'t want to fall in love. He wasn\'t coming to see her any\r\nmore--already she had haunted too many of his ways.\r\n\r\nWhat delicious romance! His true reaction was neither fear nor\r\nsorrow--only this deep delight in being with her that colored the\r\nbanality of his words and made the mawkish seem sad and the posturing\r\nseem wise. He _would_ come back--eternally. He should have known!\r\n\r\n"This is all. It\'s been very rare to have known you, very strange and\r\nwonderful. But this wouldn\'t do--and wouldn\'t last." As he spoke there\r\nwas in his heart that tremulousness that we take for sincerity in\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nAfterward he remembered one reply of hers to something he had asked her.\r\nHe remembered it in this form--perhaps he had unconsciously arranged and\r\npolished it:\r\n\r\n"A woman should be able to kiss a man beautifully and romantically\r\nwithout any desire to be either his wife or his mistress."\r\n\r\nAs always when he was with her she seemed to grow gradually older until\r\nat the end ruminations too deep for words would be wintering in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, and the fire leaped up in little ecstasies as though its\r\nfading life was sweet. It was five now, and the clock over the mantel\r\nbecame articulate in sound. Then as if a brutish sensibility in him was\r\nreminded by those thin, tinny beats that the petals were falling from\r\nthe flowered afternoon, Anthony pulled her quickly to her feet and held\r\nher helpless, without breath, in a kiss that was neither a game nor\r\na tribute.\r\n\r\nHer arms fell to her side. In an instant she was free.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t!" she said quietly. "I don\'t want that."\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the far side of the lounge and gazed straight before\r\nher. A frown had gathered between her eyes. Anthony sank down beside her\r\nand closed his hand over hers. It was lifeless and unresponsive.\r\n\r\n"Why, Gloria!" He made a motion as if to put his arm about her but she\r\ndrew away.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want that," she repeated.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry," he said, a little impatiently. "I--I didn\'t know you\r\nmade such fine distinctions."\r\n\r\nShe did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you kiss me, Gloria?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to." It seemed to him she had not moved for hours.\r\n\r\n"A sudden change, isn\'t it?" Annoyance was growing in his voice.\r\n\r\n"Is it?" She appeared uninterested. It was almost as though she were\r\nlooking at some one else.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I\'d better go."\r\n\r\nNo reply. He rose and regarded her angrily, uncertainly. Again he sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"Gloria, Gloria, won\'t you kiss me?"\r\n\r\n"No." Her lips, parting for the word, had just faintly stirred.\r\n\r\nAgain he got to his feet, this time with less decision, less confidence.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll go."\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n"All right--I\'ll go."\r\n\r\nHe was aware of a certain irremediable lack of originality in his\r\nremarks. Indeed he felt that the whole atmosphere had grown oppressive.\r\nHe wished she would speak, rail at him, cry out upon him, anything but\r\nthis pervasive and chilling silence. He cursed himself for a weak fool;\r\nhis clearest desire was to move her, to hurt her, to see her wince.\r\nHelplessly, involuntarily, he erred again.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re tired of kissing me I\'d better go."\r\n\r\nHe saw her lips curl slightly and his last dignity left him. She spoke,\r\nat length:\r\n\r\n"I believe you\'ve made that remark several times before."\r\n\r\nHe looked about him immediately, saw his hat and coat on a\r\nchair--blundered into them, during an intolerable moment. Looking again\r\nat the couch he perceived that she had not turned, not even moved. With\r\na shaken, immediately regretted "good-by" he went quickly but without\r\ndignity from the room.\r\n\r\nFor over a moment Gloria made no sound. Her lips were still curled; her\r\nglance was straight, proud, remote. Then her eyes blurred a little, and\r\nshe murmured three words half aloud to the death-bound fire:\r\n\r\n"Good-by, you ass!" she said.\r\n\r\n\r\nPANIC\r\n\r\nThe man had had the hardest blow of his life. He knew at last what he\r\nwanted, but in finding it out it seemed that he had put it forever\r\nbeyond his grasp. He reached home in misery, dropped into an armchair\r\nwithout even removing his overcoat, and sat there for over an hour, his\r\nmind racing the paths of fruitless and wretched self-absorption. She had\r\nsent him away! That was the reiterated burden of his despair. Instead of\r\nseizing the girl and holding her by sheer strength until she became\r\npassive to his desire, instead of beating down her will by the force of\r\nhis own, he had walked, defeated and powerless, from her door, with the\r\ncorners of his mouth drooping and what force there might have been in\r\nhis grief and rage hidden behind the manner of a whipped schoolboy. At\r\none minute she had liked him tremendously--ah, she had nearly loved him.\r\nIn the next he had become a thing of indifference to her, an insolent\r\nand efficiently humiliated man.\r\n\r\nHe had no great self-reproach--some, of course, but there were other\r\nthings dominant in him now, far more urgent. He was not so much in love\r\nwith Gloria as mad for her. Unless he could have her near him again,\r\nkiss her, hold her close and acquiescent, he wanted nothing more from\r\nlife. By her three minutes of utter unwavering indifference the girl had\r\nlifted herself from a high but somehow casual position in his mind, to\r\nbe instead his complete preoccupation. However much his wild thoughts\r\nvaried between a passionate desire for her kisses and an equally\r\npassionate craving to hurt and mar her, the residue of his mind craved\r\nin finer fashion to possess the triumphant soul that had shone through\r\nthose three minutes. She was beautiful--but especially she was without\r\nmercy. He must own that strength that could send him away.\r\n\r\nAt present no such analysis was possible to Anthony. His clarity of\r\nmind, all those endless resources which he thought his irony had brought\r\nhim were swept aside. Not only for that night but for the days and weeks\r\nthat followed his books were to be but furniture and his friends only\r\npeople who lived and walked in a nebulous outer world from which he was\r\ntrying to escape--that world was cold and full of bleak wind, and for a\r\nlittle while he had seen into a warm house where fires shone.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight he began to realize that he was hungry. He went down into\r\nFifty-second Street, where it was so cold that he could scarcely see;\r\nthe moisture froze on his lashes and in the corners of his lips.\r\nEverywhere dreariness had come down from the north, settling upon the\r\nthin and cheerless street, where black bundled figures blacker still\r\nagainst the night, moved stumbling along the sidewalk through the\r\nshrieking wind, sliding their feet cautiously ahead as though they were\r\non skis. Anthony turned over toward Sixth Avenue, so absorbed in his\r\nthoughts as not to notice that several passers-by had stared at him. His\r\novercoat was wide open, and the wind was biting in, hard and full of\r\nmerciless death.\r\n\r\n... After a while a waitress spoke to him, a fat waitress with\r\nblack-rimmed eye-glasses from which dangled a long black cord.\r\n\r\n"Order, please!"\r\n\r\nHer voice, he considered, was unnecessarily loud. He looked up\r\nresentfully.\r\n\r\n"You wanna order or doncha?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," he protested.\r\n\r\n"Well, I ast you three times. This ain\'t no rest-room."\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the big clock and discovered with a start that it was\r\nafter two. He was down around Thirtieth Street somewhere, and after a\r\nmoment he found and translated the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S\'DLIHC]\r\n[Transcribers note: The illustration shows the word "CHILD\'s" in mirror\r\nimage.]\r\n\r\nin a white semicircle of letters upon the glass front. The place was\r\ninhabited sparsely by three or four bleak and half-frozen night-hawks.\r\n\r\n"Give me some bacon and eggs and coffee, please."\r\n\r\nThe waitress bent upon him a last disgusted glance and, looking\r\nludicrously intellectual in her corded glasses, hurried away.\r\n\r\nGod! Gloria\'s kisses had been such flowers. He remembered as though it\r\nhad been years ago the low freshness of her voice, the beautiful lines\r\nof her body shining through her clothes, her face lily-colored under the\r\nlamps of the street--under the lamps.\r\n\r\nMisery struck at him again, piling a sort of terror upon the ache and\r\nyearning. He had lost her. It was true--no denying it, no softening it.\r\nBut a new idea had seared his sky--what of Bloeckman! What would happen\r\nnow? There was a wealthy man, middle-aged enough to be tolerant with a\r\nbeautiful wife, to baby her whims and indulge her unreason, to wear her\r\nas she perhaps wished to be worn--a bright flower in his button-hole,\r\nsafe and secure from the things she feared. He felt that she had been\r\nplaying with the idea of marrying Bloeckman, and it was well possible\r\nthat this disappointment in Anthony might throw her on sudden impulse\r\ninto Bloeckman\'s arms.\r\n\r\nThe idea drove him childishly frantic. He wanted to kill Bloeckman and\r\nmake him suffer for his hideous presumption. He was saying this over and\r\nover to himself with his teeth tight shut, and a perfect orgy of hate\r\nand fright in his eyes.\r\n\r\nBut, behind this obscene jealousy, Anthony was in love at last,\r\nprofoundly and truly in love, as the word goes between man and woman.\r\n\r\nHis coffee appeared at his elbow and gave off for a certain time a\r\ngradually diminishing wisp of steam. The night manager, seated at his\r\ndesk, glanced at the motionless figure alone at the last table, and then\r\nwith a sigh moved down upon him just as the hour hand crossed the figure\r\nthree on the big clock.\r\n\r\n\r\nWISDOM\r\n\r\nAfter another day the turmoil subsided and Anthony began to exercise a\r\nmeasure of reason. He was in love--he cried it passionately to himself.\r\nThe things that a week before would have seemed insuperable obstacles,\r\nhis limited income, his desire to be irresponsible and independent, had\r\nin this forty hours become the merest chaff before the wind of his\r\ninfatuation. If he did not marry her his life would be a feeble parody\r\non his own adolescence. To be able to face people and to endure the\r\nconstant reminder of Gloria that all existence had become, it was\r\nnecessary for him to have hope. So he built hope desperately and\r\ntenaciously out of the stuff of his dream, a hope flimsy enough, to be\r\nsure, a hope that was cracked and dissipated a dozen times a day, a hope\r\nmothered by mockery, but, nevertheless, a hope that would be brawn and\r\nsinew to his self-respect.\r\n\r\nOut of this developed a spark of wisdom, a true perception of his own\r\nfrom out the effortless past.\r\n\r\n"Memory is short," he thought.\r\n\r\nSo very short. At the crucial point the Trust President is on the stand,\r\na potential criminal needing but one push to be a jailbird, scorned by\r\nthe upright for leagues around. Let him be acquitted--and in a year all\r\nis forgotten. "Yes, he did have some trouble once, just a technicality,\r\nI believe." Oh, memory is very short!\r\n\r\nAnthony had seen Gloria altogether about a dozen times, say two dozen\r\nhours. Supposing he left her alone for a month, made no attempt to see\r\nher or speak to her, and avoided every place where she might possibly\r\nbe. Wasn\'t it possible, the more possible because she had never loved\r\nhim, that at the end of that time the rush of events would efface his\r\npersonality from her conscious mind, and with his personality his\r\noffense and humiliation? She would forget, for there would be other men.\r\nHe winced. The implication struck out at him--other men. Two\r\nmonths--God! Better three weeks, two weeks----\r\n\r\nHe thought this the second evening after the catastrophe when he was\r\nundressing, and at this point he threw himself down on the bed and lay\r\nthere, trembling very slightly and looking at the top of the canopy.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks--that was worse than no time at all. In two weeks he would\r\napproach her much as he would have to now, without personality or\r\nconfidence--remaining still the man who had gone too far and then for a\r\nperiod that in time was but a moment but in fact an eternity, whined.\r\nNo, two weeks was too short a time. Whatever poignancy there had been\r\nfor her in that afternoon must have time to dull. He must give her a\r\nperiod when the incident should fade, and then a new period when she\r\nshould gradually begin to think of him, no matter how dimly, with a true\r\nperspective that would remember his pleasantness as well as his\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nHe fixed, finally, on six weeks as approximately the interval best\r\nsuited to his purpose, and on a desk calendar he marked the days off,\r\nfinding that it would fall on the ninth of April. Very well, on that day\r\nhe would phone and ask her if he might call. Until then--silence.\r\n\r\nAfter his decision a gradual improvement was manifest. He had taken at\r\nleast a step in the direction to which hope pointed, and he realized\r\nthat the less he brooded upon her the better he would be able to give\r\nthe desired impression when they met.\r\n\r\nIn another hour he fell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERVAL\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though, as the days passed, the glory of her hair dimmed\r\nperceptibly for him and in a year of separation might have departed\r\ncompletely, the six weeks held many abominable days. He dreaded the\r\nsight of Dick and Maury, imagining wildly that they knew all--but when\r\nthe three met it was Richard Caramel and not Anthony who was the centre\r\nof attention; "The Demon Lover" had been accepted for immediate\r\npublication. Anthony felt that from now on he moved apart. He no longer\r\ncraved the warmth and security of Maury\'s society which had cheered him\r\nno further back than November. Only Gloria could give that now and no\r\none else ever again. So Dick\'s success rejoiced him only casually and\r\nworried him not a little. It meant that the world was going\r\nahead--writing and reading and publishing--and living. And he wanted the\r\nworld to wait motionless and breathless for six weeks--while\r\nGloria forgot.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO ENCOUNTERS\r\n\r\nHis greatest satisfaction was in Geraldine\'s company. He took her once\r\nto dinner and the theatre and entertained her several times in his\r\napartment. When he was with her she absorbed him, not as Gloria had, but\r\nquieting those erotic sensibilities in him that worried over Gloria. It\r\ndidn\'t matter how he kissed Geraldine. A kiss was a kiss--to be enjoyed\r\nto the utmost for its short moment. To Geraldine things belonged in\r\ndefinite pigeonholes: a kiss was one thing, anything further was quite\r\nanother; a kiss was all right; the other things were "bad."\r\n\r\nWhen half the interval was up two incidents occurred on successive days\r\nthat upset his increasing calm and caused a temporary relapse.\r\n\r\nThe first was--he saw Gloria. It was a short meeting. Both bowed. Both\r\nspoke, yet neither heard the other. But when it was over Anthony read\r\ndown a column of The Sun three times in succession without understanding\r\na single sentence.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought Sixth Avenue a safe street! Having forsworn his\r\nbarber at the Plaza he went around the corner one morning to be shaved,\r\nand while waiting his turn he took off coat and vest, and with his soft\r\ncollar open at the neck stood near the front of the shop. The day was an\r\noasis in the cold desert of March and the sidewalk was cheerful with a\r\npopulation of strolling sun-worshippers. A stout woman upholstered in\r\nvelvet, her flabby cheeks too much massaged, swirled by with her poodle\r\nstraining at its leash--the effect being given of a tug bringing in an\r\nocean liner. Just behind them a man in a striped blue suit, walking\r\nslue-footed in white-spatted feet, grinned at the sight and catching\r\nAnthony\'s eye, winked through the glass. Anthony laughed, thrown\r\nimmediately into that humor in which men and women were graceless and\r\nabsurd phantasms, grotesquely curved and rounded in a rectangular world\r\nof their own building. They inspired the same sensations in him as did\r\nthose strange and monstrous fish who inhabit the esoteric world of green\r\nin the aquarium.\r\n\r\nTwo more strollers caught his eye casually, a man and a girl--then in a\r\nhorrified instant the girl resolved herself into Gloria. He stood here\r\npowerless; they came nearer and Gloria, glancing in, saw him. Her eyes\r\nwidened and she smiled politely. Her lips moved. She was less than five\r\nfeet away.\r\n\r\n"How do you do?" he muttered inanely.\r\n\r\nGloria, happy, beautiful, and young--with a man he had never seen\r\nbefore!\r\n\r\nIt was then that the barber\'s chair was vacated and he read down the\r\nnewspaper column three times in succession.\r\n\r\nThe second incident took place the next day. Going into the Manhattan\r\nbar about seven he was confronted with Bloeckman. As it happened, the\r\nroom was nearly deserted, and before the mutual recognition he had\r\nstationed himself within a foot of the older man and ordered his drink,\r\nso it was inevitable that they should converse.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Mr. Patch," said Bloeckman amiably enough.\r\n\r\nAnthony took the proffered hand and exchanged a few aphorisms on the\r\nfluctuations of the mercury.\r\n\r\n"Do you come in here much?" inquired Bloeckman.\r\n\r\n"No, very seldom." He omitted to add that the Plaza bar had, until\r\nlately, been his favorite.\r\n\r\n"Nice bar. One of the best bars in town."\r\n\r\nAnthony nodded. Bloeckman emptied his glass and picked up his cane. He\r\nwas in evening dress.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll be hurrying on. I\'m going to dinner with Miss Gilbert."\r\n\r\nDeath looked suddenly out at him from two blue eyes. Had he announced\r\nhimself as his vis-a-vis\'s prospective murderer he could not have struck\r\na more vital blow at Anthony. The younger man must have reddened\r\nvisibly, for his every nerve was in instant clamor. With tremendous\r\neffort he mustered a rigid--oh, so rigid--smile, and said a conventional\r\ngood-by. But that night he lay awake until after four, half wild with\r\ngrief and fear and abominable imaginings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS\r\n\r\nAnd one day in the fifth week he called her up. He had been sitting in\r\nhis apartment trying to read "L\'Education Sentimental," and something in\r\nthe book had sent his thoughts racing in the direction that, set free,\r\nthey always took, like horses racing for a home stable. With suddenly\r\nquickened breath he walked to the telephone. When he gave the number it\r\nseemed to him that his voice faltered and broke like a schoolboy\'s. The\r\nCentral must have heard the pounding of his heart. The sound of the\r\nreceiver being taken up at the other end was a crack of doom, and Mrs.\r\nGilbert\'s voice, soft as maple syrup running into a glass container, had\r\nfor him a quality of horror in its single "Hello-o-ah?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Gloria\'s not feeling well. She\'s lying down, asleep. Who shall I\r\nsay called?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody!" he shouted.\r\n\r\nIn a wild panic he slammed down the receiver; collapsed into his\r\narmchair in the cold sweat of breathless relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERENADE\r\n\r\nThe first thing he said to her was: "Why, you\'ve bobbed your hair!" and\r\nshe answered: "Yes, isn\'t it gorgeous?"\r\n\r\nIt was not fashionable then. It was to be fashionable in five or six\r\nyears. At that time it was considered extremely daring.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all sunshine outdoors," he said gravely. "Don\'t you want to take a\r\nwalk?"\r\n\r\nShe put on a light coat and a quaintly piquant Napoleon hat of Alice\r\nBlue, and they walked along the Avenue and into the Zoo, where they\r\nproperly admired the grandeur of the elephant and the collar-height of\r\nthe giraffe, but did not visit the monkey house because Gloria said that\r\nmonkeys smelt so bad.\r\n\r\nThen they returned toward the Plaza, talking about nothing, but glad for\r\nthe spring singing in the air and for the warm balm that lay upon the\r\nsuddenly golden city. To their right was the Park, while at the left a\r\ngreat bulk of granite and marble muttered dully a millionaire\'s chaotic\r\nmessage to whosoever would listen: something about "I worked and I saved\r\nand I was sharper than all Adam and here I sit, by golly, by golly!"\r\n\r\nAll the newest and most beautiful designs in automobiles were out on\r\nFifth Avenue, and ahead of them the Plaza loomed up rather unusually\r\nwhite and attractive. The supple, indolent Gloria walked a short\r\nshadow\'s length ahead of him, pouring out lazy casual comments that\r\nfloated a moment on the dazzling air before they reached his ear.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she cried, "I want to go south to Hot Springs! I want to get out\r\nin the air and just roll around on the new grass and forget there\'s ever\r\nbeen any winter."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you, though!"\r\n\r\n"I want to hear a million robins making a frightful racket. I sort of\r\nlike birds."\r\n\r\n"All women _are_ birds," he ventured.\r\n\r\n"What kind am I?"--quick and eager.\r\n\r\n"A swallow, I think, and sometimes a bird of paradise. Most girls are\r\nsparrows, of course--see that row of nurse-maids over there? They\'re\r\nsparrows--or are they magpies? And of course you\'ve met canary\r\ngirls--and robin girls."\r\n\r\n"And swan girls and parrot girls. All grown women are hawks, I think, or\r\nowls."\r\n\r\n"What am I--a buzzard?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed and shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, you\'re not a bird at all, do you think? You\'re a Russian\r\nwolfhound."\r\n\r\nAnthony remembered that they were white and always looked unnaturally\r\nhungry. But then they were usually photographed with dukes and\r\nprincesses, so he was properly flattered.\r\n\r\n"Dick\'s a fox terrier, a trick fox terrier," she continued.\r\n\r\n"And Maury\'s a cat." Simultaneously it occurred to him how like\r\nBloeckman was to a robust and offensive hog. But he preserved a\r\ndiscreet silence.\r\n\r\nLater, as they parted, Anthony asked when he might see her again.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you ever make long engagements?" he pleaded, "even if it\'s a week\r\nahead, I think it\'d be fun to spend a whole day together, morning and\r\nafternoon both."\r\n\r\n"It would be, wouldn\'t it?" She thought for a moment. "Let\'s do it next\r\nSunday."\r\n\r\n"All right. I\'ll map out a programme that\'ll take up every minute."\r\n\r\nHe did. He even figured to a nicety what would happen in the two hours\r\nwhen she would come to his apartment for tea: how the good Bounds would\r\nhave the windows wide to let in the fresh breeze--but a fire going also\r\nlest there be chill in the air--and how there would be clusters of\r\nflowers about in big cool bowls that he would buy for the occasion. They\r\nwould sit on the lounge.\r\n\r\nAnd when the day came they did sit upon the lounge. After a while\r\nAnthony kissed her because it came about quite naturally; he found\r\nsweetness sleeping still upon her lips, and felt that he had never been\r\naway. The fire was bright and the breeze sighing in through the curtains\r\nbrought a mellow damp, promising May and world of summer. His soul\r\nthrilled to remote harmonies; he heard the strum of far guitars and\r\nwaters lapping on a warm Mediterranean shore--for he was young now as he\r\nwould never be again, and more triumphant than death.\r\n\r\nSix o\'clock stole down too soon and rang the querulous melody of St.\r\nAnne\'s chimes on the corner. Through the gathering dusk they strolled to\r\nthe Avenue, where the crowds, like prisoners released, were walking with\r\nelastic step at last after the long winter, and the tops of the busses\r\nwere thronged with congenial kings and the shops full of fine soft\r\nthings for the summer, the rare summer, the gay promising summer that\r\nseemed for love what the winter was for money. Life was singing for his\r\nsupper on the corner! Life was handing round cocktails in the street! Old\r\nwomen there were in that crowd who felt that they could have run and won\r\na hundred-yard dash!\r\n\r\nIn bed that night with the lights out and the cool room swimming with\r\nmoonlight, Anthony lay awake and played with every minute of the day\r\nlike a child playing in turn with each one of a pile of long-wanted\r\nChristmas toys. He had told her gently, almost in the middle of a kiss,\r\nthat he loved her, and she had smiled and held him closer and murmured,\r\n"I\'m glad," looking into his eyes. There had been a new quality in her\r\nattitude, a new growth of sheer physical attraction toward him and a\r\nstrange emotional tenseness, that was enough to make him clinch his\r\nhands and draw in his breath at the recollection. He had felt nearer to\r\nher than ever before. In a rare delight he cried aloud to the room that\r\nhe loved her.\r\n\r\nHe phoned next morning--no hesitation now, no uncertainty--instead a\r\ndelirious excitement that doubled and trebled when he heard her voice:\r\n\r\n"Good morning--Gloria."\r\n\r\n"Good morning."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all I called you up to say-dear."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you did."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could see you."\r\n\r\n"You will, to-morrow night."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a long time, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--" Her voice was reluctant. His hand tightened on the receiver.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t I come to-night?" He dared anything in the glory and\r\nrevelation of that almost whispered "yes."\r\n\r\n"I have a date."\r\n\r\n"Oh--"\r\n\r\n"But I might--I might be able to break it."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"--a sheer cry, a rhapsody. "Gloria?"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I love you."\r\n\r\nAnother pause and then:\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m glad."\r\n\r\nHappiness, remarked Maury Noble one day, is only the first hour after\r\nthe alleviation of some especially intense misery. But oh, Anthony\'s\r\nface as he walked down the tenth-floor corridor of the Plaza that night!\r\nHis dark eyes were gleaming--around his mouth were lines it was a\r\nkindness to see. He was handsome then if never before, bound for one of\r\nthose immortal moments which come so radiantly that their remembered\r\nlight is enough to see by for years.\r\n\r\nHe knocked and, at a word, entered. Gloria, dressed in simple pink,\r\nstarched and fresh as a flower, was across the room, standing very\r\nstill, and looking at him wide-eyed.\r\n\r\nAs he closed the door behind him she gave a little cry and moved swiftly\r\nover the intervening space, her arms rising in a premature caress as she\r\ncame near. Together they crushed out the stiff folds of her dress in one\r\ntriumphant and enduring embrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RADIANT HOUR\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight Anthony and Gloria began to indulge in "practical\r\ndiscussions," as they called those sessions when under the guise of\r\nsevere realism they walked in an eternal moonlight.\r\n\r\n"Not as much as I do you," the critic of belles-lettres would insist.\r\n"If you really loved me you\'d want every one to know it."\r\n\r\n"I do," she protested; "I want to stand on the street corner like a\r\nsandwich man, informing all the passers-by."\r\n\r\n"Then tell me all the reasons why you\'re going to marry me in June."\r\n\r\n"Well, because you\'re so clean. You\'re sort of blowy clean, like I am.\r\nThere\'s two sorts, you know. One\'s like Dick: he\'s clean like polished\r\npans. You and I are clean like streams and winds. I can tell whenever I\r\nsee a person whether he is clean, and if so, which kind of clean he is."\r\n\r\n"We\'re twins."\r\n\r\nEcstatic thought!\r\n\r\n"Mother says"--she hesitated uncertainly--"mother says that two souls\r\nare sometimes created together and--and in love before they\'re born."\r\n\r\nBilphism gained its easiest convert.... After a while he lifted up his\r\nhead and laughed soundlessly toward the ceiling. When his eyes came back\r\nto her he saw that she was angry.\r\n\r\n"Why did you laugh?" she cried, "you\'ve done that twice before. There\'s\r\nnothing funny about our relation to each other. I don\'t mind playing the\r\nfool, and I don\'t mind having you do it, but I can\'t stand it when we\'re\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t say you\'re sorry! If you can\'t think of anything better than\r\nthat, just keep quiet!"\r\n\r\n"I love you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Anthony was depressed.... At length Gloria murmured:\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I was mean."\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t. I was the one."\r\n\r\nPeace was restored--the ensuing moments were so much more sweet and\r\nsharp and poignant. They were stars on this stage, each playing to an\r\naudience of two: the passion of their pretense created the actuality.\r\nHere, finally, was the quintessence of self-expression--yet it was\r\nprobable that for the most part their love expressed Gloria rather than\r\nAnthony. He felt often like a scarcely tolerated guest at a party she\r\nwas giving.\r\n\r\nTelling Mrs. Gilbert had been an embarrassed matter. She sat stuffed\r\ninto a small chair and listened with an intense and very blinky sort of\r\nconcentration. She must have known it--for three weeks Gloria had seen\r\nno one else--and she must have noticed that this time there was an\r\nauthentic difference in her daughter\'s attitude. She had been given\r\nspecial deliveries to post; she had heeded, as all mothers seem to heed,\r\nthe hither end of telephone conversations, disguised but still\r\nrather warm--\r\n\r\n--Yet she had delicately professed surprise and declared herself\r\nimmensely pleased; she doubtless was; so were the geranium plants\r\nblossoming in the window-boxes, and so were the cabbies when the lovers\r\nsought the romantic privacy of hansom cabs--quaint device--and the staid\r\nbill of fares on which they scribbled "you know I do," pushing it over\r\nfor the other to see.\r\n\r\nBut between kisses Anthony and this golden girl quarrelled incessantly.\r\n\r\n"Now, Gloria," he would cry, "please let me explain!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t explain. Kiss me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that\'s right. If I hurt your feelings we ought to discuss\r\nit. I don\'t like this kiss-and-forget."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want to argue. I think it\'s wonderful that we _can_ kiss\r\nand forget, and when we can\'t it\'ll be time to argue."\r\n\r\nAt one time some gossamer difference attained such bulk that Anthony\r\narose and punched himself into his overcoat--for a moment it appeared\r\nthat the scene of the preceding February was to be repeated, but knowing\r\nhow deeply she was moved he retained his dignity with his pride, and in\r\na moment Gloria was sobbing in his arms, her lovely face miserable as a\r\nfrightened little girl\'s.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they kept unfolding to each other, unwillingly, by curious\r\nreactions and evasions, by distastes and prejudices and unintended hints\r\nof the past. The girl was proudly incapable of jealousy and, because he\r\nwas extremely jealous, this virtue piqued him. He told her recondite\r\nincidents of his own life on purpose to arouse some spark of it, but to\r\nno avail. She possessed him now--nor did she desire the dead years.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Anthony," she would say, "always when I\'m mean to you I\'m sorry\r\nafterward. I\'d give my right hand to save you one little moment\'s pain."\r\n\r\nAnd in that instant her eyes were brimming and she was not aware that\r\nshe was voicing an illusion. Yet Anthony knew that there were days when\r\nthey hurt each other purposely--taking almost a delight in the thrust.\r\nIncessantly she puzzled him: one hour so intimate and charming, striving\r\ndesperately toward an unguessed, transcendent union; the next, silent\r\nand cold, apparently unmoved by any consideration of their love or\r\nanything he could say. Often he would eventually trace these portentous\r\nreticences to some physical discomfort--of these she never complained\r\nuntil they were over--or to some carelessness or presumption in him, or\r\nto an unsatisfactory dish at dinner, but even then the means by which\r\nshe created the infinite distances she spread about herself were a\r\nmystery, buried somewhere back in those twenty-two years of\r\nunwavering pride.\r\n\r\n"Why do you like Muriel?" he demanded one day.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t very much."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you go with her?"\r\n\r\n"Just for some one to go with. They\'re no exertion, those girls. They\r\nsort of believe everything I tell them--but I rather like Rachael. I\r\nthink she\'s cute--and so clean and slick, don\'t you? I used to have\r\nother friends--in Kansas City and at school--casual, all of them, girls\r\nwho just flitted into my range and out of it for no more reason than\r\nthat boys took us places together. They didn\'t interest me after\r\nenvironment stopped throwing us together. Now they\'re mostly married.\r\nWhat does it matter--they were all just people."\r\n\r\n"You like men better, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, much better. I\'ve got a man\'s mind."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got a mind like mine. Not strongly gendered either way."\r\n\r\nLater she told him about the beginnings of her friendship with\r\nBloeckman. One day in Delmonico\'s, Gloria and Rachael had come upon\r\nBloeckman and Mr. Gilbert having luncheon and curiosity had impelled her\r\nto make it a party of four. She had liked him--rather. He was a relief\r\nfrom younger men, satisfied as he was with so little. He humored her and\r\nhe laughed, whether he understood her or not. She met him several times,\r\ndespite the open disapproval of her parents, and within a month he had\r\nasked her to marry him, tendering her everything from a villa in Italy\r\nto a brilliant career on the screen. She had laughed in his face--and he\r\nhad laughed too.\r\n\r\nBut he had not given up. To the time of Anthony\'s arrival in the arena\r\nhe had been making steady progress. She treated him rather well--except\r\nthat she had called him always by an invidious nickname--perceiving,\r\nmeanwhile, that he was figuratively following along beside her as she\r\nwalked the fence, ready to catch her if she should fall.\r\n\r\nThe night before the engagement was announced she told Bloeckman. It was\r\na heavy blow. She did not enlighten Anthony as to the details, but she\r\nimplied that he had not hesitated to argue with her. Anthony gathered\r\nthat the interview had terminated on a stormy note, with Gloria very\r\ncool and unmoved lying in her corner of the sofa and Joseph Bloeckman of\r\n"Films Par Excellence" pacing the carpet with eyes narrowed and head\r\nbowed. Gloria had been sorry for him but she had judged it best not to\r\nshow it. In a final burst of kindness she had tried to make him hate\r\nher, there at the last. But Anthony, understanding that Gloria\'s\r\nindifference was her strongest appeal, judged how futile this must have\r\nbeen. He wondered, often but quite casually, about Bloeckman--finally he\r\nforgot him entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEYDAY\r\n\r\nOne afternoon they found front seats on the sunny roof of a bus and rode\r\nfor hours from the fading Square up along the sullied river, and then,\r\nas the stray beams fled the westward streets, sailed down the turgid\r\nAvenue, darkening with ominous bees from the department stores. The\r\ntraffic was clotted and gripped in a patternless jam; the busses were\r\npacked four deep like platforms above the crowd as they waited for the\r\nmoan of the traffic whistle.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it good!" cried Gloria. "Look!"\r\n\r\nA miller\'s wagon, stark white with flour, driven by a powdery clown,\r\npassed in front of them behind a white horse and his black team-mate.\r\n\r\n"What a pity!" she complained; "they\'d look so beautiful in the dusk, if\r\nonly both horses were white. I\'m mighty happy just this minute, in\r\nthis city."\r\n\r\nAnthony shook his head in disagreement.\r\n\r\n"I think the city\'s a mountebank. Always struggling to approach the\r\ntremendous and impressive urbanity ascribed to it. Trying to be\r\nromantically metropolitan."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t. I think it is impressive."\r\n\r\n"Momentarily. But it\'s really a transparent, artificial sort of\r\nspectacle. It\'s got its press-agented stars and its flimsy, unenduring\r\nstage settings and, I\'ll admit, the greatest army of supers ever\r\nassembled--" He paused, laughed shortly, and added: "Technically\r\nexcellent, perhaps, but not convincing."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet policemen think people are fools," said Gloria thoughtfully,\r\nas she watched a large but cowardly lady being helped across the street.\r\n"He always sees them frightened and inefficient and old--they are," she\r\nadded. And then: "We\'d better get off. I told mother I\'d have an early\r\nsupper and go to bed. She says I look tired, damn it."\r\n\r\n"I wish we were married," he muttered soberly; "there\'ll be no good\r\nnight then and we can do just as we want."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t it be good! I think we ought to travel a lot. I want to go to the\r\nMediterranean and Italy. And I\'d like to go on the stage some time--say\r\nfor about a year."\r\n\r\n"You bet. I\'ll write a play for you."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t that be good! And I\'ll act in it. And then some time when we have\r\nmore money"--old Adam\'s death was always thus tactfully alluded\r\nto--"we\'ll build a magnificent estate, won\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, with private swimming pools."\r\n\r\n"Dozens of them. And private rivers. Oh, I wish it were now."\r\n\r\nOdd coincidence--he had just been wishing that very thing. They plunged\r\nlike divers into the dark eddying crowd and emerging in the cool fifties\r\nsauntered indolently homeward, infinitely romantic to each other ...\r\nboth were walking alone in a dispassionate garden with a ghost found\r\nin a dream.\r\n\r\nHalcyon days like boats drifting along slow-moving rivers; spring\r\nevenings full of a plaintive melancholy that made the past beautiful and\r\nbitter, bidding them look back and see that the loves of other summers\r\nlong gone were dead with the forgotten waltzes of their years. Always\r\nthe most poignant moments were when some artificial barrier kept them\r\napart: in the theatre their hands would steal together, join, give and\r\nreturn gentle pressures through the long dark; in crowded rooms they\r\nwould form words with their lips for each other\'s eyes--not knowing that\r\nthey were but following in the footsteps of dusty generations but\r\ncomprehending dimly that if truth is the end of life happiness is a mode\r\nof it, to be cherished in its brief and tremulous moment. And then, one\r\nfairy night, May became June. Sixteen days now--fifteen--fourteen----\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE DIGRESSIONS\r\n\r\nJust before the engagement was announced Anthony had gone up to\r\nTarrytown to see his grandfather, who, a little more wizened and grizzly\r\nas time played its ultimate chuckling tricks, greeted the news with\r\nprofound cynicism.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re going to get married, are you?" He said this with such a\r\ndubious mildness and shook his head up and down so many times that\r\nAnthony was not a little depressed. While he was unaware of his\r\ngrandfather\'s intentions he presumed that a large part of the money\r\nwould come to him. A good deal would go in charities, of course; a good\r\ndeal to carry on the business of reform.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to work?"\r\n\r\n"Why--" temporized Anthony, somewhat disconcerted. "I _am_ working. You\r\nknow--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, I mean work," said Adam Patch dispassionately.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not quite sure yet what I\'ll do. I\'m not exactly a beggar, grampa,"\r\nhe asserted with some spirit.\r\n\r\nThe old man considered this with eyes half closed. Then almost\r\napologetically he asked:\r\n\r\n"How much do you save a year?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing so far--"\r\n\r\n"And so after just managing to get along on your money you\'ve decided\r\nthat by some miracle two of you can get along on it."\r\n\r\n"Gloria has some money of her own. Enough to buy clothes."\r\n\r\n"How much?"\r\n\r\nWithout considering this question impertinent, Anthony answered it.\r\n\r\n"About a hundred a month."\r\n\r\n"That\'s altogether about seventy-five hundred a year." Then he added\r\nsoftly: "It ought to be plenty. If you have any sense it ought to be\r\nplenty. But the question is whether you have any or not."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is." It was shameful to be compelled to endure this pious\r\nbrowbeating from the old man, and his next words were stiffened with\r\nvanity. "I can manage very well. You seem convinced that I\'m utterly\r\nworthless. At any rate I came up here simply to tell you that I\'m\r\ngetting married in June. Good-by, sir." With this he turned away and\r\nheaded for the door, unaware that in that instant his grandfather, for\r\nthe first time, rather liked him.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" called Adam Patch, "I want to talk to you."\r\n\r\nAnthony faced about.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Sit down. Stay all night."\r\n\r\nSomewhat mollified, Anthony resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, sir, but I\'m going to see Gloria to-night."\r\n\r\n"What\'s her name?"\r\n\r\n"Gloria Gilbert."\r\n\r\n"New York girl? Someone you know?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s from the Middle West."\r\n\r\n"What business her father in?"\r\n\r\n"In a celluloid corporation or trust or something. They\'re from Kansas\r\nCity."\r\n\r\n"You going to be married out there?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no, sir. We thought we\'d be married in New York--rather quietly."\r\n\r\n"Like to have the wedding out here?"\r\n\r\nAnthony hesitated. The suggestion made no appeal to him, but it was\r\ncertainly the part of wisdom to give the old man, if possible, a\r\nproprietary interest in his married life. In addition Anthony was a\r\nlittle touched.\r\n\r\n"That\'s very kind of you, grampa, but wouldn\'t it be a lot of trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Everything\'s a lot of trouble. Your father was married here--but in the\r\nold house."\r\n\r\n"Why--I thought he was married in Boston."\r\n\r\nAdam Patch considered.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. He _was_ married in Boston."\r\n\r\nAnthony felt a moment\'s embarrassment at having made the correction, and\r\nhe covered it up with words.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll speak to Gloria about it. Personally I\'d like to, but of\r\ncourse it\'s up to the Gilberts, you see."\r\n\r\nHis grandfather drew a long sigh, half closed his eyes, and sank back in\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\n"In a hurry?" he asked in a different tone.\r\n\r\n"Not especially."\r\n\r\n"I wonder," began Adam Patch, looking out with a mild, kindly glance at\r\nthe lilac bushes that rustled against the windows, "I wonder if you ever\r\nthink about the after-life."\r\n\r\n"Why--sometimes."\r\n\r\n"I think a great deal about the after-life." His eyes were dim but his\r\nvoice was confident and clear. "I was sitting here to-day thinking about\r\nwhat\'s lying in wait for us, and somehow I began to remember an\r\nafternoon nearly sixty-five years ago, when I was playing with my little\r\nsister Annie, down where that summer-house is now." He pointed out into\r\nthe long flower-garden, his eyes trembling of tears, his voice shaking.\r\n\r\n"I began thinking--and it seemed to me that _you_ ought to think a\r\nlittle more about the after-life. You ought to be--steadier"--he paused\r\nand seemed to grope about for the right word--"more industrious--why--"\r\n\r\nThen his expression altered, his entire personality seemed to snap\r\ntogether like a trap, and when he continued the softness had gone from\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n"--Why, when I was just two years older than you," he rasped with a\r\ncunning chuckle, "I sent three members of the firm of Wrenn and Hunt to\r\nthe poorhouse."\r\n\r\nAnthony started with embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-by," added his grandfather suddenly, "you\'ll miss your\r\ntrain."\r\n\r\nAnthony left the house unusually elated, and strangely sorry for the old\r\nman; not because his wealth could buy him "neither youth nor digestion"\r\nbut because he had asked Anthony to be married there, and because he had\r\nforgotten something about his son\'s wedding that he should have\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel, who was one of the ushers, caused Anthony and Gloria\r\nmuch distress in the last few weeks by continually stealing the rays of\r\ntheir spot-light. "The Demon Lover" had been published in April, and it\r\ninterrupted the love affair as it may be said to have interrupted\r\neverything its author came in contact with. It was a highly original,\r\nrather overwritten piece of sustained description concerned with a Don\r\nJuan of the New York slums. As Maury and Anthony had said before, as the\r\nmore hospitable critics were saying then, there was no writer in America\r\nwith such power to describe the atavistic and unsubtle reactions of that\r\nsection of society.\r\n\r\nThe book hesitated and then suddenly "went." Editions, small at first,\r\nthen larger, crowded each other week by week. A spokesman of the\r\nSalvation Army denounced it as a cynical misrepresentation of all the\r\nuplift taking place in the underworld. Clever press-agenting spread the\r\nunfounded rumor that "Gypsy" Smith was beginning a libel suit because\r\none of the principal characters was a burlesque of himself. It was\r\nbarred from the public library of Burlington, Iowa, and a Mid-Western\r\ncolumnist announced by innuendo that Richard Caramel was in a sanitarium\r\nwith delirium tremens.\r\n\r\nThe author, indeed, spent his days in a state of pleasant madness. The\r\nbook was in his conversation three-fourths of the time--he wanted to\r\nknow if one had heard "the latest"; he would go into a store and in a\r\nloud voice order books to be charged to him, in order to catch a chance\r\nmorsel of recognition from clerk or customer. He knew to a town in what\r\nsections of the country it was selling best; he knew exactly what he\r\ncleared on each edition, and when he met any one who had not read it,\r\nor, as it happened only too often, had not heard of it, he succumbed to\r\nmoody depression.\r\n\r\nSo it was natural for Anthony and Gloria to decide, in their jealousy,\r\nthat he was so swollen with conceit as to be a bore. To Dick\'s great\r\nannoyance Gloria publicly boasted that she had never read "The Demon\r\nLover," and didn\'t intend to until every one stopped talking about it.\r\nAs a matter of fact, she had no time to read now, for the presents were\r\npouring in--first a scattering, then an avalanche, varying from the\r\nbric-a-brac of forgotten family friends to the photographs of forgotten\r\npoor relations.\r\n\r\nMaury gave them an elaborate "drinking set," which included silver\r\ngoblets, cocktail shaker, and bottle-openers. The extortion from Dick\r\nwas more conventional--a tea set from Tiffany\'s. From Joseph Bloeckman\r\ncame a simple and exquisite travelling clock, with his card. There was\r\neven a cigarette-holder from Bounds; this touched Anthony and made him\r\nwant to weep--indeed, any emotion short of hysteria seemed natural in\r\nthe half-dozen people who were swept up by this tremendous sacrifice to\r\nconvention. The room set aside in the Plaza bulged with offerings sent\r\nby Harvard friends and by associates of his grandfather, with\r\nremembrances of Gloria\'s Farmover days, and with rather pathetic\r\ntrophies from her former beaux, which last arrived with esoteric,\r\nmelancholy messages, written on cards tucked carefully inside, beginning\r\n"I little thought when--" or "I\'m sure I wish you all the happiness--"\r\nor even "When you get this I shall be on my way to--"\r\n\r\nThe most munificent gift was simultaneously the most disappointing. It\r\nwas a concession of Adam Patch\'s--a check for five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nTo most of the presents Anthony was cold. It seemed to him that they\r\nwould necessitate keeping a chart of the marital status of all their\r\nacquaintances during the next half-century. But Gloria exulted in each\r\none, tearing at the tissue-paper and excelsior with the rapaciousness of\r\na dog digging for a bone, breathlessly seizing a ribbon or an edge of\r\nmetal and finally bringing to light the whole article and holding it up\r\ncritically, no emotion except rapt interest in her unsmiling face.\r\n\r\n"Look, Anthony!"\r\n\r\n"Darn nice, isn\'t it!"\r\n\r\nNo answer until an hour later when she would give him a careful account\r\nof her precise reaction to the gift, whether it would have been improved\r\nby being smaller or larger, whether she was surprised at getting it,\r\nand, if so, just how much surprised.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilbert arranged and rearranged a hypothetical house, distributing\r\nthe gifts among the different rooms, tabulating articles as "second-best\r\nclock" or "silver to use _every_ day," and embarrassing Anthony and\r\nGloria by semi-facetious references to a room she called the nursery.\r\nShe was pleased by old Adam\'s gift and thereafter had it that he was a\r\nvery ancient soul, "as much as anything else." As Adam Patch never quite\r\ndecided whether she referred to the advancing senility of his mind or to\r\nsome private and psychic schema of her own, it cannot be said to have\r\npleased him. Indeed he always spoke of her to Anthony as "that old\r\nwoman, the mother," as though she were a character in a comedy he had\r\nseen staged many times before. Concerning Gloria he was unable to make\r\nup his mind. She attracted him but, as she herself told Anthony, he had\r\ndecided that she was frivolous and was afraid to approve of her.\r\n\r\nFive days!--A dancing platform was being erected on the lawn at\r\nTarrytown. Four days!--A special train was chartered to convey the\r\nguests to and from New York. Three days!----\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIARY\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in blue silk pajamas and standing by her bed with her\r\nhand on the light to put the room in darkness, when she changed her mind\r\nand opening a table drawer brought out a little black book--a\r\n"Line-a-day" diary. This she had kept for seven years. Many of the\r\npencil entries were almost illegible and there were notes and references\r\nto nights and afternoons long since forgotten, for it was not an\r\nintimate diary, even though it began with the immemorial "I am going to\r\nkeep a diary for my children." Yet as she thumbed over the pages the\r\neyes of many men seemed to look out at her from their half-obliterated\r\nnames. With one she had gone to New Haven for the first time--in 1908,\r\nwhen she was sixteen and padded shoulders were fashionable at Yale--she\r\nhad been flattered because "Touch down" Michaud had "rushed" her all\r\nevening. She sighed, remembering the grown-up satin dress she had been\r\nso proud of and the orchestra playing "Yama-yama, My Yama Man" and\r\n"Jungle-Town." So long ago!--the names: Eltynge Reardon, Jim Parsons,\r\n"Curly" McGregor, Kenneth Cowan, "Fish-eye" Fry (whom she had liked for\r\nbeing so ugly), Carter Kirby--he had sent her a present; so had Tudor\r\nBaird;--Marty Reffer, the first man she had been in love with for more\r\nthan a day, and Stuart Holcome, who had run away with her in his\r\nautomobile and tried to make her marry him by force. And Larry Fenwick,\r\nwhom she had always admired because he had told her one night that if\r\nshe wouldn\'t kiss him she could get out of his car and walk home. What\r\na list!\r\n\r\n... And, after all, an obsolete list. She was in love now, set for the\r\neternal romance that was to be the synthesis of all romance, yet sad for\r\nthese men and these moonlights and for the "thrills" she had had--and\r\nthe kisses. The past--her past, oh, what a joy! She had been\r\nexuberantly happy.\r\n\r\nTurning over the pages her eyes rested idly on the scattered entries of\r\nthe past four months. She read the last few carefully.\r\n\r\n"_April 1st_.--I know Bill Carstairs hates me because I was so\r\ndisagreeable, but I hate to be sentimentalized over sometimes. We drove\r\nout to the Rockyear Country Club and the most wonderful moon kept\r\nshining through the trees. My silver dress is getting tarnished. Funny\r\nhow one forgets the other nights at Rockyear--with Kenneth Cowan when I\r\nloved him so!\r\n\r\n"_April 3rd_.--After two hours of Schroeder who, they inform me, has\r\nmillions, I\'ve decided that this matter of sticking to things wears one\r\nout, particularly when the things concerned are men. There\'s nothing so\r\noften overdone and from to-day I swear to be amused. We talked about\r\n\'love\'--how banal! With how many men have I talked about love?\r\n\r\n"_April 11th_.--Patch actually called up to-day! and when he forswore me\r\nabout a month ago he fairly raged out the door. I\'m gradually losing\r\nfaith in any man being susceptible to fatal injuries.\r\n\r\n"_April 20th_.--Spent the day with Anthony. Maybe I\'ll marry him some\r\ntime. I kind of like his ideas--he stimulates all the originality in me.\r\nBlockhead came around about ten in his new car and took me out Riverside\r\nDrive. I liked him to-night: he\'s so considerate. He knew I didn\'t want\r\nto talk so he was quiet all during the ride.\r\n\r\n"_April 21st_.--Woke up thinking of Anthony and sure enough he called\r\nand sounded sweet on the phone--so I broke a date for him. To-day I feel\r\nI\'d break anything for him, including the ten commandments and my neck.\r\nHe\'s coming at eight and I shall wear pink and look very fresh and\r\nstarched----"\r\n\r\nShe paused here, remembering that after he had gone that night she had\r\nundressed with the shivering April air streaming in the windows. Yet it\r\nseemed she had not felt the cold, warmed by the profound banalities\r\nburning in her heart.\r\n\r\nThe next entry occurred a few days later:\r\n\r\n"_April 24th_.--I want to marry Anthony, because husbands are so often\r\n\'husbands\' and I must marry a lover.\r\n\r\n"There are four general types of husbands.\r\n\r\n"(1) The husband who always wants to stay in in the evening, has no vices\r\nand works for a salary. Totally undesirable!\r\n\r\n"(2) The atavistic master whose mistress one is, to wait on his pleasure.\r\nThis sort always considers every pretty woman \'shallow,\' a sort of\r\npeacock with arrested development.\r\n\r\n"(3) Next comes the worshipper, the idolater of his wife and all that is\r\nhis, to the utter oblivion of everything else. This sort demands an\r\nemotional actress for a wife. God! it must be an exertion to be thought\r\nrighteous.\r\n\r\n"(4) And Anthony--a temporarily passionate lover with wisdom enough to\r\nrealize when it has flown and that it must fly. And I want to get\r\nmarried to Anthony.\r\n\r\n"What grubworms women are to crawl on their bellies through colorless\r\nmarriages! Marriage was created not to be a background but to need one.\r\nMine is going to be outstanding. It can\'t, shan\'t be the setting--it\'s\r\ngoing to be the performance, the live, lovely, glamourous performance,\r\nand the world shall be the scenery. I refuse to dedicate my life to\r\nposterity. Surely one owes as much to the current generation as to one\'s\r\nunwanted children. What a fate--to grow rotund and unseemly, to lose my\r\nself-love, to think in terms of milk, oatmeal, nurse, diapers.... Dear\r\ndream children, how much more beautiful you are, dazzling little\r\ncreatures who flutter (all dream children must flutter) on golden,\r\ngolden wings----\r\n\r\n"Such children, however, poor dear babies, have little in common with the\r\nwedded state.\r\n\r\n"_June 7th_.--Moral question: Was it wrong to make Bloeckman love me?\r\nBecause I did really make him. He was almost sweetly sad to-night. How\r\nopportune it was that my throat is swollen plunk together and tears were\r\neasy to muster. But he\'s just the past--buried already in my\r\nplentiful lavender.\r\n\r\n"_June 8th_.--And to-day I\'ve promised not to chew my mouth. Well, I\r\nwon\'t, I suppose--but if he\'d only asked me not to eat!\r\n\r\n"Blowing bubbles--that\'s what we\'re doing, Anthony and me. And we blew\r\nsuch beautiful ones to-day, and they\'ll explode and then we\'ll blow more\r\nand more, I guess--bubbles just as big and just as beautiful, until all\r\nthe soap and water is used up."\r\n\r\nOn this note the diary ended. Her eyes wandered up the page, over the\r\nJune 8th\'s of 1912, 1910, 1907. The earliest entry was scrawled in the\r\nplump, bulbous hand of a sixteen-year-old girl--it was the name, Bob\r\nLamar, and a word she could not decipher. Then she knew what it\r\nwas--and, knowing, she found her eyes misty with tears. There in a\r\ngraying blur was the record of her first kiss, faded as its intimate\r\nafternoon, on a rainy veranda seven years before. She seemed to remember\r\nsomething one of them had said that day and yet she could not remember.\r\nHer tears came faster, until she could scarcely see the page. She was\r\ncrying, she told herself, because she could remember only the rain and\r\nthe wet flowers in the yard and the smell of the damp grass.\r\n\r\n... After a moment she found a pencil and holding it unsteadily drew\r\nthree parallel lines beneath the last entry. Then she printed FINIS in\r\nlarge capitals, put the book back in the drawer, and crept into bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREATH OF THE CAVE\r\n\r\nBack in his apartment after the bridal dinner, Anthony snapped out his\r\nlights and, feeling impersonal and fragile as a piece of china waiting\r\non a serving table, got into bed. It was a warm night--a sheet was\r\nenough for comfort--and through his wide-open windows came sound,\r\nevanescent and summery, alive with remote anticipation. He was thinking\r\nthat the young years behind him, hollow and colorful, had been lived in\r\nfacile and vacillating cynicism upon the recorded emotions of men long\r\ndust. And there was something beyond that; he knew now. There was the\r\nunion of his soul with Gloria\'s, whose radiant fire and freshness was\r\nthe living material of which the dead beauty of books was made.\r\n\r\nFrom the night into his high-walled room there came, persistently, that\r\nevanescent and dissolving sound--something the city was tossing up and\r\ncalling back again, like a child playing with a ball. In Harlem, the\r\nBronx, Gramercy Park, and along the water-fronts, in little parlors or\r\non pebble-strewn, moon-flooded roofs, a thousand lovers were making this\r\nsound, crying little fragments of it into the air. All the city was\r\nplaying with this sound out there in the blue summer dark, throwing it\r\nup and calling it back, promising that, in a little while, life would be\r\nbeautiful as a story, promising happiness--and by that promise giving\r\nit. It gave love hope in its own survival. It could do no more.\r\n\r\nIt was then that a new note separated itself jarringly from the soft\r\ncrying of the night. It was a noise from an areaway within a hundred\r\nfeet from his rear window, the noise of a woman\'s laughter. It began\r\nlow, incessant and whining--some servant-maid with her fellow, he\r\nthought--and then it grew in volume and became hysterical, until it\r\nreminded him of a girl he had seen overcome with nervous laughter at a\r\nvaudeville performance. Then it sank, receded, only to rise again and\r\ninclude words--a coarse joke, some bit of obscure horseplay he could not\r\ndistinguish. It would break off for a moment and he would just catch the\r\nlow rumble of a man\'s voice, then begin again--interminably; at first\r\nannoying, then strangely terrible. He shivered, and getting up out of\r\nbed went to the window. It had reached a high point, tensed and stifled,\r\nalmost the quality of a scream--then it ceased and left behind it a\r\nsilence empty and menacing as the greater silence overhead. Anthony\r\nstood by the window a moment longer before he returned to his bed. He\r\nfound himself upset and shaken. Try as he might to strangle his\r\nreaction, some animal quality in that unrestrained laughter had grasped\r\nat his imagination, and for the first time in four months aroused his\r\nold aversion and horror toward all the business of life. The room had\r\ngrown smothery. He wanted to be out in some cool and bitter breeze,\r\nmiles above the cities, and to live serene and detached back in the\r\ncorners of his mind. Life was that sound out there, that ghastly\r\nreiterated female sound.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my _God_!" he cried, drawing in his breath sharply.\r\n\r\nBurying his face in the pillows he tried in vain to concentrate upon the\r\ndetails of the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORNING\r\n\r\nIn the gray light he found that it was only five o\'clock. He regretted\r\nnervously that he had awakened so early--he would appear fagged at the\r\nwedding. He envied Gloria who could hide her fatigue with careful\r\npigmentation.\r\n\r\nIn his bathroom he contemplated himself in the mirror and saw that he\r\nwas unusually white--half a dozen small imperfections stood out against\r\nthe morning pallor of his complexion, and overnight he had grown the\r\nfaint stubble of a beard--the general effect, he fancied, was\r\nunprepossessing, haggard, half unwell.\r\n\r\nOn his dressing table were spread a number of articles which he told\r\nover carefully with suddenly fumbling fingers--their tickets to\r\nCalifornia, the book of traveller\'s checks, his watch, set to the half\r\nminute, the key to his apartment, which he must not forget to give to\r\nMaury, and, most important of all, the ring. It was of platinum set\r\naround with small emeralds; Gloria had insisted on this; she had always\r\nwanted an emerald wedding ring, she said.\r\n\r\nIt was the third present he had given her; first had come the engagement\r\nring, and then a little gold cigarette-case. He would be giving her many\r\nthings now--clothes and jewels and friends and excitement. It seemed\r\nabsurd that from now on he would pay for all her meals. It was going to\r\ncost: he wondered if he had not underestimated for this trip, and if he\r\nhad not better cash a larger check. The question worried him.\r\n\r\nThen the breathless impendency of the event swept his mind clear of\r\ndetails. This was the day--unsought, unsuspected six months before, but\r\nnow breaking in yellow light through his east window, dancing along the\r\ncarpet as though the sun were smiling at some ancient and reiterated gag\r\nof his own.\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed in a nervous one-syllable snort.\r\n\r\n"By God!" he muttered to himself, "I\'m as good as married!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USHERS\r\n\r\n_Six young men in_ CROSS PATCH\'S _library growing more and more cheery\r\nunder the influence of Mumm\'s Extra Dry, set surreptitiously in cold\r\npails by the bookcases._\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST YOUNG MAN: By golly! Believe me, in my next book I\'m going to\r\ndo a wedding scene that\'ll knock \'em cold!\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND YOUNG MAN: Met a debutante th\'other day said she thought your\r\nbook was powerful. As a rule young girls cry for this primitive business.\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD YOUNG MAN: Where\'s Anthony?\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH YOUNG MAN: Walking up and down outside talking to himself.\r\n\r\nSECOND YOUNG MAN: Lord! Did you see the minister? Most peculiar looking\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nFIFTH YOUNG MAN: Think they\'re natural. Funny thing people having gold\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nSIXTH YOUNG MAN: They say they love \'em. My dentist told me once a woman\r\ncame to him and insisted on having two of her teeth covered with gold.\r\nNo reason at all. All right the way they were.\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: Hear you got out a book, Dicky. \'Gratulations!\r\n\r\nDICK: (_Stiffly_) Thanks.\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: (_Innocently_) What is it? College stories?\r\n\r\nDICK: (_More stiffly_) No. Not college stories.\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: Pity! Hasn\'t been a good book about Harvard for years.\r\n\r\nDICK: (_Touchily_) Why don\'t you supply the lack?\r\n\r\nTHIRD YOUNG MAN: I think I saw a squad of guests turn the drive in a\r\nPackard just now.\r\n\r\nSIXTH YOUNG MAN: Might open a couple more bottles on the strength of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nTHIRD YOUNG MAN: It was the shock of my life when I heard the old man\r\nwas going to have a wet wedding. Rabid prohibitionist, you know.\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: (_Snapping his fingers excitedly_) By gad! I knew I\'d\r\nforgotten something. Kept thinking it was my vest.\r\n\r\nDICK: What was it?\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: By gad! By gad!\r\n\r\nSIXTH YOUNG MAN: Here! Here! Why the tragedy?\r\n\r\nSECOND YOUNG MAN: What\'d you forget? The way home?\r\n\r\nDICK: (_Maliciously_) He forgot the plot for his book of Harvard\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: No, sir, I forgot the present, by George! I forgot to\r\nbuy old Anthony a present. I kept putting it off and putting it off, and\r\nby gad I\'ve forgotten it! What\'ll they think?\r\n\r\nSIXTH YOUNG MAN: (_Facetiously_) That\'s probably what\'s been holding up\r\nthe wedding.\r\n\r\n(THE FOURTH YOUNG MAN _looks nervously at his watch. Laughter._)\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: By gad! What an ass I am!\r\n\r\nSECOND YOUNG MAN: What d\'you make of the bridesmaid who thinks she\'s\r\nNora Bayes? Kept telling me she wished this was a ragtime wedding.\r\nName\'s Haines or Hampton.\r\n\r\nDICK: (_Hurriedly spurring his imagination_) Kane, you mean, Muriel\r\nKane. She\'s a sort of debt of honor, I believe. Once saved Gloria from\r\ndrowning, or something of the sort.\r\n\r\nSECOND YOUNG MAN: I didn\'t think she could stop that perpetual swaying\r\nlong enough to swim. Fill up my glass, will you? Old man and I had a\r\nlong talk about the weather just now.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Who? Old Adam?\r\n\r\nSECOND YOUNG MAN: No, the bride\'s father. He must be with a weather\r\nbureau.\r\n\r\nDICK: He\'s my uncle, Otis.\r\n\r\nOTIS: Well, it\'s an honorable profession. (_Laughter._)\r\n\r\nSIXTH YOUNG MAN: Bride your cousin, isn\'t she?\r\n\r\nDICK: Yes, Cable, she is.\r\n\r\nCABLE: She certainly is a beauty. Not like you, Dicky. Bet she brings\r\nold Anthony to terms.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Why are all grooms given the title of "old"? I think marriage is\r\nan error of youth.\r\n\r\nDICK: Maury, the professional cynic.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Why, you intellectual faker!\r\n\r\nFIFTH YOUNG MAN: Battle of the highbrows here, Otis. Pick up what crumbs\r\nyou can.\r\n\r\nDICK: Faker yourself! What do _you_ know?\r\n\r\nMAURY: What do _you_ know?\r\n\r\nLICK: Ask me anything. Any branch of knowledge.\r\n\r\nMAURY: All right. What\'s the fundamental principle of biology?\r\n\r\nDICK: You don\'t know yourself.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Don\'t hedge!\r\n\r\nDICK: Well, natural selection?\r\n\r\nMAURY: Wrong.\r\n\r\nDICK: I give it up.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Ontogony recapitulates phyllogony.\r\n\r\nFIFTH YOUNG MAN: Take your base!\r\n\r\nMAURY: Ask you another. What\'s the influence of mice on the clover crop?\r\n(_Laughter._)\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: What\'s the influence of rats on the Decalogue?\r\n\r\nMAURY: Shut up, you saphead. There _is_ a connection.\r\n\r\nDICK: What is it then?\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_Pausing a moment in growing disconcertion_) Why, let\'s see. I\r\nseem to have forgotten exactly. Something about the bees eating\r\nthe clover.\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: And the clover eating the mice! Haw! Haw!\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_Frowning_) Let me just think a minute.\r\n\r\nDICK: (_Sitting up suddenly_) Listen!\r\n\r\n(_A volley of chatter explodes in the adjoining room. The six young men\r\narise, feeling at their neckties._)\r\n\r\nDICK: (_Weightily_) We\'d better join the firing squad. They\'re going to\r\ntake the picture, I guess. No, that\'s afterward.\r\n\r\nOTIS: Cable, you take the ragtime bridesmaid.\r\n\r\nFOURTH YOUNG MAN: I wish to God I\'d sent that present.\r\n\r\nMAURY: If you\'ll give me another minute I\'ll think of that about the\r\nmice.\r\n\r\nOTIS: I was usher last month for old Charlie McIntyre and----\r\n\r\n(_They move slowly toward the door as the chatter becomes a babel and\r\nthe practising preliminary to the overture issues in long pious groans\r\nfrom ADAM PATCH\'S organ_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHONY\r\n\r\nThere were five hundred eyes boring through the back of his cutaway and\r\nthe sun glinting on the clergyman\'s inappropriately bourgeois teeth.\r\nWith difficulty he restrained a laugh. Gloria was saying something in a\r\nclear proud voice and he tried to think that the affair was irrevocable,\r\nthat every second was significant, that his life was being slashed into\r\ntwo periods and that the face of the world was changing before him. He\r\ntried to recapture that ecstatic sensation of ten weeks before. All\r\nthese emotions eluded him, he did not even feel the physical nervousness\r\nof that very morning--it was all one gigantic aftermath. And those gold\r\nteeth! He wondered if the clergyman were married; he wondered perversely\r\nif a clergyman could perform his own marriage service....\r\n\r\nBut as he took Gloria into his arms he was conscious of a strong\r\nreaction. The blood was moving in his veins now. A languorous and\r\npleasant content settled like a weight upon him, bringing responsibility\r\nand possession. He was married.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLORIA\r\n\r\nSo many, such mingled emotions, that no one of them was separable from\r\nthe others! She could have wept for her mother, who was crying quietly\r\nback there ten feet and for the loveliness of the June sunlight flooding\r\nin at the windows. She was beyond all conscious perceptions. Only a\r\nsense, colored with delirious wild excitement, that the ultimately\r\nimportant was happening--and a trust, fierce and passionate, burning in\r\nher like a prayer, that in a moment she would be forever and\r\nsecurely safe.\r\n\r\nLate one night they arrived in Santa Barbara, where the night clerk at\r\nthe Hotel Lafcadio refused to admit them, on the grounds that they were\r\nnot married.\r\n\r\nThe clerk thought that Gloria was beautiful. He did not think that\r\nanything so beautiful as Gloria could be moral.\r\n\r\n\r\n"CON AMORE"\r\n\r\nThat first half-year--the trip West, the long months\' loiter along the\r\nCalifornia coast, and the gray house near Greenwich where they lived\r\nuntil late autumn made the country dreary--those days, those places, saw\r\nthe enraptured hours. The breathless idyl of their engagement gave way,\r\nfirst, to the intense romance of the more passionate relationship. The\r\nbreathless idyl left them, fled on to other lovers; they looked around\r\none day and it was gone, how they scarcely knew. Had either of them lost\r\nthe other in the days of the idyl, the love lost would have been ever to\r\nthe loser that dim desire without fulfilment which stands back of all\r\nlife. But magic must hurry on, and the lovers remain....\r\n\r\nThe idyl passed, bearing with it its extortion of youth. Came a day when\r\nGloria found that other men no longer bored her; came a day when Anthony\r\ndiscovered that he could sit again late into the evening, talking with\r\nDick of those tremendous abstractions that had once occupied his world.\r\nBut, knowing they had had the best of love, they clung to what remained.\r\nLove lingered--by way of long conversations at night into those stark\r\nhours when the mind thins and sharpens and the borrowings from dreams\r\nbecome the stuff of all life, by way of deep and intimate kindnesses\r\nthey developed toward each other, by way of their laughing at the same\r\nabsurdities and thinking the same things noble and the same things sad.\r\n\r\nIt was, first of all, a time of discovery. The things they found in each\r\nother were so diverse, so intermixed and, moreover, so sugared with love\r\nas to seem at the time not so much discoveries as isolated phenomena--to\r\nbe allowed for, and to be forgotten. Anthony found that he was living\r\nwith a girl of tremendous nervous tension and of the most high-handed\r\nselfishness. Gloria knew within a month that her husband was an utter\r\ncoward toward any one of a million phantasms created by his imagination.\r\nHer perception was intermittent, for this cowardice sprang out, became\r\nalmost obscenely evident, then faded and vanished as though it had been\r\nonly a creation of her own mind. Her reactions to it were not those\r\nattributed to her sex--it roused her neither to disgust nor to a\r\npremature feeling of motherhood. Herself almost completely without\r\nphysical fear, she was unable to understand, and so she made the most of\r\nwhat she felt to be his fear\'s redeeming feature, which was that though\r\nhe was a coward under a shock and a coward under a strain--when his\r\nimagination was given play--he had yet a sort of dashing recklessness\r\nthat moved her on its brief occasions almost to admiration, and a pride\r\nthat usually steadied him when he thought he was observed.\r\n\r\nThe trait first showed itself in a dozen incidents of little more than\r\nnervousness--his warning to a taxi-driver against fast driving, in\r\nChicago; his refusal to take her to a certain tough cafe she had always\r\nwished to visit; these of course admitted the conventional\r\ninterpretation--that it was of her he had been thinking; nevertheless,\r\ntheir culminative weight disturbed her. But something that occurred in a\r\nSan Francisco hotel, when they had been married a week, gave the matter\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nIt was after midnight and pitch dark in their room. Gloria was dozing\r\noff and Anthony\'s even breathing beside her made her suppose that he was\r\nasleep, when suddenly she saw him raise himself on his elbow and stare\r\nat the window.\r\n\r\n"What is it, dearest?" she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Nothing"--he had relaxed to his pillow and turned toward her--"nothing,\r\nmy darling wife."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say \'wife.\' I\'m your mistress. Wife\'s such an ugly word. Your\r\n\'permanent mistress\' is so much more tangible and desirable.... Come\r\ninto my arms," she added in a rush of tenderness; "I can sleep so well,\r\nso well with you in my arms."\r\n\r\nComing into Gloria\'s arms had a quite definite meaning. It required that\r\nhe should slide one arm under her shoulder, lock both arms about her,\r\nand arrange himself as nearly as possible as a sort of three-sided crib\r\nfor her luxurious ease. Anthony, who tossed, whose arms went tinglingly\r\nto sleep after half an hour of that position, would wait until she was\r\nasleep and roll her gently over to her side of the bed--then, left to\r\nhis own devices, he would curl himself into his usual knots.\r\n\r\nGloria, having attained sentimental comfort, retired into her doze. Five\r\nminutes ticked away on Bloeckman\'s travelling clock; silence lay all\r\nabout the room, over the unfamiliar, impersonal furniture and the\r\nhalf-oppressive ceiling that melted imperceptibly into invisible walls\r\non both sides. Then there was suddenly a rattling flutter at the window,\r\nstaccato and loud upon the hushed, pent air.\r\n\r\nWith a leap Anthony was out of the bed and standing tense beside it.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?" he cried in an awful voice.\r\n\r\nGloria lay very still, wide awake now and engrossed not so much in the\r\nrattling as in the rigid breathless figure whose voice had reached from\r\nthe bedside into that ominous dark.\r\n\r\nThe sound stopped; the room was quiet as before--then Anthony pouring\r\nwords in at the telephone.\r\n\r\n"Some one just tried to get into the room! ...\r\n\r\n"There\'s some one at the window!" His voice was emphatic now, faintly\r\nterrified.\r\n\r\n"All right! Hurry!" He hung up the receiver; stood motionless.\r\n\r\n... There was a rush and commotion at the door, a knocking--Anthony went\r\nto open it upon an excited night clerk with three bell-boys grouped\r\nstaring behind him. Between thumb and finger the night clerk held a wet\r\npen with the threat of a weapon; one of the bell-boys had seized a\r\ntelephone directory and was looking at it sheepishly. Simultaneously the\r\ngroup was joined by the hastily summoned house-detective, and as one man\r\nthey surged into the room.\r\n\r\nLights sprang on with a click. Gathering a piece of sheet about her\r\nGloria dove away from sight, shutting her eyes to keep out the horror of\r\nthis unpremeditated visitation. There was no vestige of an idea in her\r\nstricken sensibilities save that her Anthony was at grievous fault.\r\n\r\n... The night clerk was speaking from the window, his tone half of the\r\nservant, half of the teacher reproving a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n"Nobody out there," he declared conclusively; "my golly, nobody _could_\r\nbe out there. This here\'s a sheer fall to the street of fifty feet. It\r\nwas the wind you heard, tugging at the blind."\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\nThen she was sorry for him. She wanted only to comfort him and draw him\r\nback tenderly into her arms, to tell them to go away because the thing\r\ntheir presence connotated was odious. Yet she could not raise her head\r\nfor shame. She heard a broken sentence, apologies, conventions of the\r\nemployee and one unrestrained snicker from a bell-boy.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been nervous as the devil all evening," Anthony was saying;\r\n"somehow that noise just shook me--I was only about half awake."\r\n\r\n"Sure, I understand," said the night clerk with comfortable tact; "been\r\nthat way myself."\r\n\r\nThe door closed; the lights snapped out; Anthony crossed the floor\r\nquietly and crept into bed. Gloria, feigning to be heavy with sleep,\r\ngave a quiet little sigh and slipped into his arms.\r\n\r\n"What was it, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," he answered, his voice still shaken; "I thought there was\r\nsomebody at the window, so I looked out, but I couldn\'t see any one and\r\nthe noise kept up, so I phoned down-stairs. Sorry if I disturbed you,\r\nbut I\'m awfully darn nervous to-night."\r\n\r\nCatching the lie, she gave an interior start--he had not gone to the\r\nwindow, nor near the window. He had stood by the bed and then sent in\r\nhis call of fear.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said--and then: "I\'m so sleepy."\r\n\r\nFor an hour they lay awake side by side, Gloria with her eyes shut so\r\ntight that blue moons formed and revolved against backgrounds of deepest\r\nmauve, Anthony staring blindly into the darkness overhead.\r\n\r\nAfter many weeks it came gradually out into the light, to be laughed and\r\njoked at. They made a tradition to fit over it--whenever that\r\noverpowering terror of the night attacked Anthony, she would put her\r\narms about him and croon, soft as a song:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll protect my Anthony. Oh, nobody\'s ever going to harm my Anthony!"\r\n\r\nHe would laugh as though it were a jest they played for their mutual\r\namusement, but to Gloria it was never quite a jest. It was, at first, a\r\nkeen disappointment; later, it was one of the times when she controlled\r\nher temper.\r\n\r\nThe management of Gloria\'s temper, whether it was aroused by a lack of\r\nhot water for her bath or by a skirmish with her husband, became almost\r\nthe primary duty of Anthony\'s day. It must be done just so--by this much\r\nsilence, by that much pressure, by this much yielding, by that much\r\nforce. It was in her angers with their attendant cruelties that her\r\ninordinate egotism chiefly displayed itself. Because she was brave,\r\nbecause she was "spoiled," because of her outrageous and commendable\r\nindependence of judgment, and finally because of her arrogant\r\nconsciousness that she had never seen a girl as beautiful as herself,\r\nGloria had developed into a consistent, practising Nietzschean. This, of\r\ncourse, with overtones of profound sentiment.\r\n\r\nThere was, for example, her stomach. She was used to certain dishes, and\r\nshe had a strong conviction that she could not possibly eat anything\r\nelse. There must be a lemonade and a tomato sandwich late in the\r\nmorning, then a light lunch with a stuffed tomato. Not only did she\r\nrequire food from a selection of a dozen dishes, but in addition this\r\nfood must be prepared in just a certain way. One of the most annoying\r\nhalf hours of the first fortnight occurred in Los Angeles, when an\r\nunhappy waiter brought her a tomato stuffed with chicken salad instead\r\nof celery.\r\n\r\n"We always serve it that way, madame," he quavered to the gray eyes that\r\nregarded him wrathfully.\r\n\r\nGloria made no answer, but when the waiter had turned discreetly away\r\nshe banged both fists upon the table until the china and silver rattled.\r\n\r\n"Poor Gloria!" laughed Anthony unwittingly, "you can\'t get what you want\r\never, can you?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t eat _stuff_!" she flared up.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll call back the waiter."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to! He doesn\'t know anything, the darn _fool_!"\r\n\r\n"Well, it isn\'t the hotel\'s fault. Either send it back, forget it, or be\r\na sport and eat it."\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" she said succinctly.\r\n\r\n"Why take it out on me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m _not_," she wailed, "but I simply _can\'t_ eat it."\r\n\r\nAnthony subsided helplessly.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go somewhere else," he suggested.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t _want_ to go anywhere else. I\'m tired of being trotted around\r\nto a dozen cafes and not getting _one thing_ fit to eat."\r\n\r\n"When did we go around to a dozen cafes?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d _have_ to in _this_ town," insisted Gloria with ready sophistry.\r\n\r\nAnthony, bewildered, tried another tack.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you try to eat it? It can\'t be as bad as you think."\r\n\r\n"Just--because--I--don\'t--like--chicken!"\r\n\r\nShe picked up her fork and began poking contemptuously at the tomato,\r\nand Anthony expected her to begin flinging the stuffings in all\r\ndirections. He was sure that she was approximately as angry as she had\r\never been--for an instant he had detected a spark of hate directed as\r\nmuch toward him as toward any one else--and Gloria angry was, for the\r\npresent, unapproachable.\r\n\r\nThen, surprisingly, he saw that she had tentatively raised the fork to\r\nher lips and tasted the chicken salad. Her frown had not abated and he\r\nstared at her anxiously, making no comment and daring scarcely to\r\nbreathe. She tasted another forkful--in another moment she was eating.\r\nWith difficulty Anthony restrained a chuckle; when at length he spoke\r\nhis words had no possible connection with chicken salad.\r\n\r\nThis incident, with variations, ran like a lugubrious fugue through the\r\nfirst year of marriage; always it left Anthony baffled, irritated, and\r\ndepressed. But another rough brushing of temperaments, a question of\r\nlaundry-bags, he found even more annoying as it ended inevitably in a\r\ndecisive defeat for him.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in Coronado, where they made the longest stay of their\r\ntrip, more than three weeks, Gloria was arraying herself brilliantly for\r\ntea. Anthony, who had been down-stairs listening to the latest rumor\r\nbulletins of war in Europe, entered the room, kissed the back of her\r\npowdered neck, and went to his dresser. After a great pulling out and\r\npushing in of drawers, evidently unsatisfactory, he turned around to the\r\nUnfinished Masterpiece.\r\n\r\n"Got any handkerchiefs, Gloria?" he asked. Gloria shook her golden head.\r\n\r\n"Not a one. I\'m using one of yours."\r\n\r\n"The last one, I deduce." He laughed dryly.\r\n\r\n"Is it?" She applied an emphatic though very delicate contour to her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t the laundry back?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nAnthony hesitated--then, with sudden discernment, opened the closet\r\ndoor. His suspicions were verified. On the hook provided hung the blue\r\nbag furnished by the hotel. This was full of his clothes--he had put\r\nthem there himself. The floor beneath it was littered with an\r\nastonishing mass of finery--lingerie, stockings, dresses, nightgowns,\r\nand pajamas--most of it scarcely worn but all of it coming indubitably\r\nunder the general heading of Gloria\'s laundry.\r\n\r\nHe stood holding the closet door open.\r\n\r\n"Why, Gloria!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\nThe lip line was being erased and corrected according to some mysterious\r\nperspective; not a finger trembled as she manipulated the lip-stick, not\r\na glance wavered in his direction. It was a triumph of concentration.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you ever sent out the laundry?"\r\n\r\n"Is it there?"\r\n\r\n"It most certainly is."\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess I haven\'t, then."\r\n\r\n"Gloria," began Anthony, sitting down on the bed and trying to catch her\r\nmirrored eyes, "you\'re a nice fellow, you are! I\'ve sent it out every\r\ntime it\'s been sent since we left New York, and over a week ago you\r\npromised you\'d do it for a change. All you\'d have to do would be to cram\r\nyour own junk into that bag and ring for the chambermaid."\r\n\r\n"Oh, why fuss about the laundry?" exclaimed Gloria petulantly, "I\'ll\r\ntake care of it."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t fussed about it. I\'d just as soon divide the bother with you,\r\nbut when we run out of handkerchiefs it\'s darn near time\r\nsomething\'s done."\r\n\r\nAnthony considered that he was being extraordinarily logical. But\r\nGloria, unimpressed, put away her cosmetics and casually offered him\r\nher back.\r\n\r\n"Hook me up," she suggested; "Anthony, dearest, I forgot all about it. I\r\nmeant to, honestly, and I will to-day. Don\'t be cross with your\r\nsweetheart."\r\n\r\nWhat could Anthony do then but draw her down upon his knee and kiss a\r\nshade of color from her lips.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t mind," she murmured with a smile, radiant and magnanimous.\r\n"You can kiss all the paint off my lips any time you want."\r\n\r\nThey went down to tea. They bought some handkerchiefs in a notion store\r\nnear by. All was forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut two days later Anthony looked in the closet and saw the bag still\r\nhung limp upon its hook and that the gay and vivid pile on the floor had\r\nincreased surprisingly in height.\r\n\r\n"Gloria!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"Oh--" Her voice was full of real distress. Despairingly Anthony went to\r\nthe phone and called the chambermaid.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," he said impatiently, "that you expect me to be some\r\nsort of French valet to you."\r\n\r\nGloria laughed, so infectiously that Anthony was unwise enough to smile.\r\nUnfortunate man! In some intangible manner his smile made her mistress\r\nof the situation--with an air of injured righteousness she went\r\nemphatically to the closet and began pushing her laundry violently into\r\nthe bag. Anthony watched her--ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n"There!" she said, implying that her fingers had been worked to the bone\r\nby a brutal taskmaster.\r\n\r\nHe considered, nevertheless, that he had given her an object-lesson and\r\nthat the matter was closed, but on the contrary it was merely beginning.\r\nLaundry pile followed laundry pile--at long intervals; dearth of\r\nhandkerchief followed dearth of handkerchief--at short ones; not to\r\nmention dearth of sock, of shirt, of everything. And Anthony found at\r\nlength that either he must send it out himself or go through the\r\nincreasingly unpleasant ordeal of a verbal battle with Gloria.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLORIA AND GENERAL LEE\r\n\r\nOn their way East they stopped two days in Washington, strolling about\r\nwith some hostility in its atmosphere of harsh repellent light, of\r\ndistance without freedom, of pomp without splendor--it seemed a\r\npasty-pale and self-conscious city. The second day they made an\r\nill-advised trip to General Lee\'s old home at Arlington.\r\n\r\nThe bus which bore them was crowded with hot, unprosperous people, and\r\nAnthony, intimate to Gloria, felt a storm brewing. It broke at the Zoo,\r\nwhere the party stopped for ten minutes. The Zoo, it seemed, smelt of\r\nmonkeys. Anthony laughed; Gloria called down the curse of Heaven upon\r\nmonkeys, including in her malevolence all the passengers of the bus and\r\ntheir perspiring offspring who had hied themselves monkey-ward.\r\n\r\nEventually the bus moved on to Arlington. There it met other busses and\r\nimmediately a swarm of women and children were leaving a trail of\r\npeanut-shells through the halls of General Lee and crowding at length\r\ninto the room where he was married. On the wall of this room a pleasing\r\nsign announced in large red letters "Ladies\' Toilet." At this final blow\r\nGloria broke down.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s perfectly terrible!" she said furiously, "the idea of\r\nletting these people come here! And of encouraging them by making these\r\nhouses show-places."\r\n\r\n"Well," objected Anthony, "if they weren\'t kept up they\'d go to pieces."\r\n\r\n"What if they did!" she exclaimed as they sought the wide pillared\r\nporch. "Do you think they\'ve left a breath of 1860 here? This has become\r\na thing of 1914."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want to preserve old things?"\r\n\r\n"But you _can\'t_, Anthony. Beautiful things grow to a certain height and\r\nthen they fail and fade off, breathing out memories as they decay. And\r\njust as any period decays in our minds, the things of that period should\r\ndecay too, and in that way they\'re preserved for a while in the few\r\nhearts like mine that react to them. That graveyard at Tarrytown, for\r\ninstance. The asses who give money to preserve things have spoiled that\r\ntoo. Sleepy Hollow\'s gone; Washington Irving\'s dead and his books are\r\nrotting in our estimation year by year--then let the graveyard rot too,\r\nas it should, as all things should. Trying to preserve a century by\r\nkeeping its relics up to date is like keeping a dying man alive by\r\nstimulants."\r\n\r\n"So you think that just as a time goes to pieces its houses ought to go\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\n"Of course! Would you value your Keats letter if the signature was\r\ntraced over to make it last longer? It\'s just because I love the past\r\nthat I want this house to look back on its glamourous moment of youth\r\nand beauty, and I want its stairs to creak as if to the footsteps of\r\nwomen with hoop skirts and men in boots and spurs. But they\'ve made it\r\ninto a blondined, rouged-up old woman of sixty. It hasn\'t any right to\r\nlook so prosperous. It might care enough for Lee to drop a brick now and\r\nthen. How many of these--these _animals_"--she waved her hand\r\naround--"get anything from this, for all the histories and guide-books\r\nand restorations in existence? How many of them who think that, at best,\r\nappreciation is talking in undertones and walking on tiptoes would even\r\ncome here if it was any trouble? I want it to smell of magnolias instead\r\nof peanuts and I want my shoes to crunch on the same gravel that Lee\'s\r\nboots crunched on. There\'s no beauty without poignancy and there\'s no\r\npoignancy without the feeling that it\'s going, men, names, books,\r\nhouses--bound for dust--mortal--"\r\n\r\nA small boy appeared beside them and, swinging a handful of\r\nbanana-peels, flung them valiantly in the direction of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n\r\nSENTIMENT\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the fall of Liege, Anthony and Gloria arrived in New\r\nYork. In retrospect the six weeks seemed miraculously happy. They had\r\nfound to a great extent, as most young couples find in some measure,\r\nthat they possessed in common many fixed ideas and curiosities and odd\r\nquirks of mind; they were essentially companionable.\r\n\r\nBut it had been a struggle to keep many of their conversations on the\r\nlevel of discussions. Arguments were fatal to Gloria\'s disposition. She\r\nhad all her life been associated either with her mental inferiors or\r\nwith men who, under the almost hostile intimidation of her beauty, had\r\nnot dared to contradict her; naturally, then, it irritated her when\r\nAnthony emerged from the state in which her pronouncements were an\r\ninfallible and ultimate decision.\r\n\r\nHe failed to realize, at first, that this was the result partly of her\r\n"female" education and partly of her beauty, and he was inclined to\r\ninclude her with her entire sex as curiously and definitely limited. It\r\nmaddened him to find she had no sense of justice. But he discovered\r\nthat, when a subject did interest her, her brain tired less quickly than\r\nhis. What he chiefly missed in her mind was the pedantic teleology--the\r\nsense of order and accuracy, the sense of life as a mysteriously\r\ncorrelated piece of patchwork, but he understood after a while that such\r\na quality in her would have been incongruous.\r\n\r\nOf the things they possessed in common, greatest of all was their almost\r\nuncanny pull at each other\'s hearts. The day they left the hotel in\r\nCoronado she sat down on one of the beds while they were packing, and\r\nbegan to weep bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Dearest--" His arms were around her; he pulled her head down upon his\r\nshoulder. "What is it, my own Gloria? Tell me."\r\n\r\n"We\'re going away," she sobbed. "Oh, Anthony, it\'s sort of the first\r\nplace we\'ve lived together. Our two little beds here--side by\r\nside--they\'ll be always waiting for us, and we\'re never coming back to\r\n\'em any more."\r\n\r\nShe was tearing at his heart as she always could. Sentiment came over\r\nhim, rushed into his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Gloria, why, we\'re going on to another room. And two other little beds.\r\nWe\'re going to be together all our lives."\r\n\r\nWords flooded from her in a low husky voice.\r\n\r\n"But it won\'t be--like our two beds--ever again. Everywhere we go and\r\nmove on and change, something\'s lost--something\'s left behind. You can\'t\r\never quite repeat anything, and I\'ve been so yours, here--"\r\n\r\nHe held her passionately near, discerning far beyond any criticism of\r\nher sentiment, a wise grasping of the minute, if only an indulgence of\r\nher desire to cry--Gloria the idler, caresser of her own dreams,\r\nextracting poignancy from the memorable things of life and youth.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon when he returned from the station with the\r\ntickets he found her asleep on one of the beds, her arm curled about a\r\nblack object which he could not at first identify. Coming closer he\r\nfound it was one of his shoes, not a particularly new one, nor clean\r\none, but her face, tear-stained, was pressed against it, and he\r\nunderstood her ancient and most honorable message. There was almost\r\necstasy in waking her and seeing her smile at him, shy but well aware of\r\nher own nicety of imagination.\r\n\r\nWith no appraisal of the worth or dross of these two things, it seemed\r\nto Anthony that they lay somewhere near the heart of love.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAY HOUSE\r\n\r\nIt is in the twenties that the actual momentum of life begins to\r\nslacken, and it is a simple soul indeed to whom as many things are\r\nsignificant and meaningful at thirty as at ten years before. At thirty\r\nan organ-grinder is a more or less moth-eaten man who grinds an\r\norgan--and once he was an organ-grinder! The unmistakable stigma of\r\nhumanity touches all those impersonal and beautiful things that only\r\nyouth ever grasps in their impersonal glory. A brilliant ball, gay with\r\nlight romantic laughter, wears through its own silks and satins to show\r\nthe bare framework of a man-made thing--oh, that eternal hand!--a play,\r\nmost tragic and most divine, becomes merely a succession of speeches,\r\nsweated over by the eternal plagiarist in the clammy hours and acted by\r\nmen subject to cramps, cowardice, and manly sentiment.\r\n\r\nAnd this time with Gloria and Anthony, this first year of marriage, and\r\nthe gray house caught them in that stage when the organ-grinder was\r\nslowly undergoing his inevitable metamorphosis. She was twenty-three; he\r\nwas twenty-six.\r\n\r\nThe gray house was, at first, of sheerly pastoral intent. They lived\r\nimpatiently in Anthony\'s apartment for the first fortnight after the\r\nreturn from California, in a stifled atmosphere of open trunks, too many\r\ncallers, and the eternal laundry-bags. They discussed with their friends\r\nthe stupendous problem of their future. Dick and Maury would sit with\r\nthem agreeing solemnly, almost thoughtfully, as Anthony ran through his\r\nlist of what they "ought" to do, and where they "ought" to live.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to take Gloria abroad," he complained, "except for this damn\r\nwar--and next to that I\'d sort of like to have a place in the country,\r\nsomewhere near New York, of course, where I could write--or whatever I\r\ndecide to do."\r\n\r\nGloria laughed.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he cute?" she required of Maury. "\'Whatever he decides to do!\'\r\nBut what am _I_ going to do if he works? Maury, will you take me around\r\nif Anthony works?"\r\n\r\n"Anyway, I\'m not going to work yet," said Anthony quickly.\r\n\r\nIt was vaguely understood between them that on some misty day he would\r\nenter a sort of glorified diplomatic service and be envied by princes\r\nand prime ministers for his beautiful wife.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Gloria helplessly, "I\'m sure I don\'t know. We talk and talk\r\nand never get anywhere, and we ask all our friends and they just answer\r\nthe way we want \'em to. I wish somebody\'d take care of us."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you go out to--out to Greenwich or something?" suggested\r\nRichard Caramel.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like that," said Gloria, brightening. "Do you think we could get a\r\nhouse there?"\r\n\r\nDick shrugged his shoulders and Maury laughed.\r\n\r\n"You two amuse me," he said. "Of all the unpractical people! As soon as\r\na place is mentioned you expect us to pull great piles of photographs\r\nout of our pockets showing the different styles of architecture\r\navailable in bungalows."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I don\'t want," wailed Gloria, "a hot stuffy bungalow,\r\nwith a lot of babies next door and their father cutting the grass in his\r\nshirt sleeves--"\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake, Gloria," interrupted Maury, "nobody wants to lock\r\nyou up in a bungalow. Who in God\'s name brought bungalows into the\r\nconversation? But you\'ll never get a place anywhere unless you go out\r\nand hunt for it."\r\n\r\n"Go where? You say \'go out and hunt for it,\' but where?"\r\n\r\nWith dignity Maury waved his hand paw-like about the room.\r\n\r\n"Out anywhere. Out in the country. There\'re lots of places."\r\n\r\n"Thanks."\r\n\r\n"Look here!" Richard Caramel brought his yellow eye rakishly into play.\r\n"The trouble with you two is that you\'re all disorganized. Do you know\r\nanything about New York State? Shut up, Anthony, I\'m talking to Gloria."\r\n\r\n"Well," she admitted finally, "I\'ve been to two or three house parties\r\nin Portchester and around in Connecticut--but, of course, that isn\'t in\r\nNew York State, is it? And neither is Morristown," she finished with\r\ndrowsy irrelevance.\r\n\r\nThere was a shout of laughter.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord!" cried Dick, "neither is Morristown!\' No, and neither is\r\nSanta Barbara, Gloria. Now listen. To begin with, unless you have a\r\nfortune there\'s no use considering any place like Newport or\r\nSouthhampton or Tuxedo. They\'re out of the question."\r\n\r\nThey all agreed to this solemnly.\r\n\r\n"And personally I hate New Jersey. Then, of course, there\'s upper New\r\nYork, above Tuxedo."\r\n\r\n"Too cold," said Gloria briefly. "I was there once in an automobile."\r\n\r\n"Well, it seems to me there\'re a lot of towns like Rye between New York\r\nand Greenwich where you could buy a little gray house of some--"\r\n\r\nGloria leaped at the phrase triumphantly. For the first time since their\r\nreturn East she knew what she wanted.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _yes_!" she cried. "Oh, _yes_! that\'s it: a little gray house with\r\nsort of white around and a whole lot of swamp maples just as brown and\r\ngold as an October picture in a gallery. Where can we find one?"\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, I\'ve mislaid my list of little gray houses with swamp\r\nmaples around them--but I\'ll try to find it. Meanwhile you take a piece\r\nof paper and write down the names of seven possible towns. And every day\r\nthis week you take a trip to one of those towns."\r\n\r\n"Oh, gosh!" protested Gloria, collapsing mentally, "why won\'t you do it\r\nfor us? I hate trains."\r\n\r\n"Well, hire a car, and--"\r\n\r\nGloria yawned.\r\n\r\n"I\'m tired of discussing it. Seems to me all we do is talk about where\r\nto live."\r\n\r\n"My exquisite wife wearies of thought," remarked Anthony ironically.\r\n"She must have a tomato sandwich to stimulate her jaded nerves. Let\'s go\r\nout to tea."\r\n\r\nAs the unfortunate upshot of this conversation, they took Dick\'s advice\r\nliterally, and two days later went out to Rye, where they wandered\r\naround with an irritated real estate agent, like bewildered babes in the\r\nwood. They were shown houses at a hundred a month which closely adjoined\r\nother houses at a hundred a month; they were shown isolated houses to\r\nwhich they invariably took violent dislikes, though they submitted\r\nweakly to the agent\'s desire that they "look at that stove--some stove!"\r\nand to a great shaking of doorposts and tapping of walls, intended\r\nevidently to show that the house would not immediately collapse, no\r\nmatter how convincingly it gave that impression. They gazed through\r\nwindows into interiors furnished either "commercially" with slab-like\r\nchairs and unyielding settees, or "home-like" with the melancholy\r\nbric-a-brac of other summers--crossed tennis rackets, fit-form couches,\r\nand depressing Gibson girls. With a feeling of guilt they looked at a\r\nfew really nice houses, aloof, dignified, and cool--at three hundred a\r\nmonth. They went away from Rye thanking the real estate agent very\r\nmuch indeed.\r\n\r\nOn the crowded train back to New York the seat behind was occupied by a\r\nsuper-respirating Latin whose last few meals had obviously been composed\r\nentirely of garlic. They reached the apartment gratefully, almost\r\nhysterically, and Gloria rushed for a hot bath in the reproachless\r\nbathroom. So far as the question of a future abode was concerned both of\r\nthem were incapacitated for a week.\r\n\r\nThe matter eventually worked itself out with unhoped-for romance.\r\nAnthony ran into the living room one afternoon fairly radiating\r\n"the idea."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got it," he was exclaiming as though he had just caught a mouse.\r\n"We\'ll get a car."\r\n\r\n"Gee whiz! Haven\'t we got troubles enough taking care of ourselves?"\r\n\r\n"Give me a second to explain, can\'t you? just let\'s leave our stuff with\r\nDick and just pile a couple of suitcases in our car, the one we\'re going\r\nto buy--we\'ll have to have one in the country anyway--and just start out\r\nin the direction of New Haven. You see, as we get out of commuting\r\ndistance from New York, the rents\'ll get cheaper, and as soon as we find\r\na house we want we\'ll just settle down."\r\n\r\nBy his frequent and soothing interpolation of the word "just" he aroused\r\nher lethargic enthusiasm. Strutting violently about the room, he\r\nsimulated a dynamic and irresistible efficiency. "We\'ll buy a car\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\nLife, limping after imagination\'s ten-league boots, saw them out of town\r\na week later in a cheap but sparkling new roadster, saw them through the\r\nchaotic unintelligible Bronx, then over a wide murky district which\r\nalternated cheerless blue-green wastes with suburbs of tremendous and\r\nsordid activity. They left New York at eleven and it was well past a hot\r\nand beatific noon when they moved rakishly through Pelham.\r\n\r\n"These aren\'t towns," said Gloria scornfully, "these are just city\r\nblocks plumped down coldly into waste acres. I imagine all the men here\r\nhave their mustaches stained from drinking their coffee too quickly in\r\nthe morning."\r\n\r\n"And play pinochle on the commuting trains."\r\n\r\n"What\'s pinochle?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so literal. How should I know? But it sounds as though they\r\nought to play it."\r\n\r\n"I like it. It sounds as if it were something where you sort of cracked\r\nyour knuckles or something.... Let me drive."\r\n\r\nAnthony looked at her suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"You swear you\'re a good driver?"\r\n\r\n"Since I was fourteen."\r\n\r\nHe stopped the car cautiously at the side of the road and they changed\r\nseats. Then with a horrible grinding noise the car was put in gear,\r\nGloria adding an accompaniment of laughter which seemed to Anthony\r\ndisquieting and in the worst possible taste.\r\n\r\n"Here we go!" she yelled. "Whoo-oop!"\r\n\r\nTheir heads snapped back like marionettes on a single wire as the car\r\nleaped ahead and curved retchingly about a standing milk-wagon, whose\r\ndriver stood up on his seat and bellowed after them. In the immemorial\r\ntradition of the road Anthony retorted with a few brief epigrams as to\r\nthe grossness of the milk-delivering profession. He cut his remarks\r\nshort, however, and turned to Gloria with the growing conviction that he\r\nhad made a grave mistake in relinquishing control and that Gloria was a\r\ndriver of many eccentricities and of infinite carelessness.\r\n\r\n"Remember now!" he warned her nervously, "the man said we oughtn\'t to go\r\nover twenty miles an hour for the first five thousand miles."\r\n\r\nShe nodded briefly, but evidently intending to accomplish the\r\nprohibitive distance as quickly as possible, slightly increased her\r\nspeed. A moment later he made another attempt.\r\n\r\n"See that sign? Do you want to get us pinched?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, for Heaven\'s sake," cried Gloria in exasperation, "you _always_\r\nexaggerate things so!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t want to get arrested."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s arresting you? You\'re so persistent--just like you were about my\r\ncough medicine last night."\r\n\r\n"It was for your own good."\r\n\r\n"Ha! I might as well be living with mama."\r\n\r\n"What a thing to say to me!"\r\n\r\nA standing policeman swerved into view, was hastily passed.\r\n\r\n"See him?" demanded Anthony.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you drive me crazy! He didn\'t arrest us, did he?"\r\n\r\n"When he does it\'ll be too late," countered Anthony brilliantly.\r\n\r\nHer reply was scornful, almost injured.\r\n\r\n"Why, this old thing won\'t _go_ over thirty-five."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t old."\r\n\r\n"It is in spirit."\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the car joined the laundry-bags and Gloria\'s appetite as\r\none of the trinity of contention. He warned her of railroad tracks; he\r\npointed out approaching automobiles; finally he insisted on taking the\r\nwheel and a furious, insulted Gloria sat silently beside him between the\r\ntowns of Larchmont and Rye.\r\n\r\nBut it was due to this furious silence of hers that the gray house\r\nmaterialized from its abstraction, for just beyond Rye he surrendered\r\ngloomily to it and re-relinquished the wheel. Mutely he beseeched her\r\nand Gloria, instantly cheered, vowed to be more careful. But because a\r\ndiscourteous street-car persisted callously in remaining upon its track\r\nGloria ducked down a side-street--and thereafter that afternoon was\r\nnever able to find her way back to the Post Road. The street they\r\nfinally mistook for it lost its Post-Road aspect when it had gone five\r\nmiles from Cos Cob. Its macadam became gravel, then dirt--moreover, it\r\nnarrowed and developed a border of maple trees, through which filtered\r\nthe weltering sun, making its endless experiments with shadow designs\r\nupon the long grass.\r\n\r\n"We\'re lost now," complained Anthony.\r\n\r\n"Read that sign!"\r\n\r\n"Marietta--Five Miles. What\'s Marietta?"\r\n\r\n"Never heard of it, but let\'s go on. We can\'t turn here and there\'s\r\nprobably a detour back to the Post Road."\r\n\r\nThe way became scarred with deepening ruts and insidious shoulders of\r\nstone. Three farmhouses faced them momentarily, slid by. A town sprang\r\nup in a cluster of dull roofs around a white tall steeple.\r\n\r\nThen Gloria, hesitating between two approaches, and making her choice\r\ntoo late, drove over a fire-hydrant and ripped the transmission\r\nviolently from the car.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when the real-estate agent of Marietta showed them the gray\r\nhouse. They came upon it just west of the village, where it rested\r\nagainst a sky that was a warm blue cloak buttoned with tiny stars. The\r\ngray house had been there when women who kept cats were probably\r\nwitches, when Paul Revere made false teeth in Boston preparatory to\r\narousing the great commercial people, when our ancestors were gloriously\r\ndeserting Washington in droves. Since those days the house had been\r\nbolstered up in a feeble corner, considerably repartitioned and newly\r\nplastered inside, amplified by a kitchen and added to by a\r\nside-porch--but, save for where some jovial oaf had roofed the new\r\nkitchen with red tin, Colonial it defiantly remained.\r\n\r\n"How did you happen to come to Marietta?" demanded the real-estate agent\r\nin a tone that was first cousin to suspicion. He was showing them\r\nthrough four spacious and airy bedrooms.\r\n\r\n"We broke down," explained Gloria. "I drove over a fire-hydrant and we\r\nhad ourselves towed to the garage and then we saw your sign."\r\n\r\nThe man nodded, unable to follow such a sally of spontaneity. There was\r\nsomething subtly immoral in doing anything without several months\'\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThey signed a lease that night and, in the agent\'s car, returned\r\njubilantly to the somnolent and dilapidated Marietta Inn, which was too\r\nbroken for even the chance immoralities and consequent gaieties of a\r\ncountry road-house. Half the night they lay awake planning the things\r\nthey were to do there. Anthony was going to work at an astounding pace\r\non his history and thus ingratiate himself with his cynical\r\ngrandfather.... When the car was repaired they would explore the country\r\nand join the nearest "really nice" club, where Gloria would play golf\r\n"or something" while Anthony wrote. This, of course, was Anthony\'s\r\nidea--Gloria was sure she wanted but to read and dream and be fed tomato\r\nsandwiches and lemonades by some angelic servant still in a shadowy\r\nhinterland. Between paragraphs Anthony would come and kiss her as she\r\nlay indolently in the hammock.... The hammock! a host of new dreams in\r\ntune to its imagined rhythm, while the wind stirred it and waves of sun\r\nundulated over the shadows of blown wheat, or the dusty road freckled\r\nand darkened with quiet summer rain....\r\n\r\nAnd guests--here they had a long argument, both of them trying to be\r\nextraordinarily mature and far-sighted. Anthony claimed that they would\r\nneed people at least every other week-end "as a sort of change." This\r\nprovoked an involved and extremely sentimental conversation as to\r\nwhether Anthony did not consider Gloria change enough. Though he assured\r\nher that he did, she insisted upon doubting him.... Eventually the\r\nconversation assumed its eternal monotone: "What then? Oh, what\'ll we\r\ndo then?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ll have a dog," suggested Anthony.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want one. I want a kitty." She went thoroughly and with great\r\nenthusiasm into the history, habits, and tastes of a cat she had once\r\npossessed. Anthony considered that it must have been a horrible\r\ncharacter with neither personal magnetism nor a loyal heart.\r\n\r\nLater they slept, to wake an hour before dawn with the gray house\r\ndancing in phantom glory before their dazzled eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUL OF GLORIA\r\n\r\nFor that autumn the gray house welcomed them with a rush of sentiment\r\nthat falsified its cynical old age. True, there were the laundry-bags,\r\nthere was Gloria\'s appetite, there was Anthony\'s tendency to brood and\r\nhis imaginative "nervousness," but there were intervals also of an\r\nunhoped-for serenity. Close together on the porch they would wait for\r\nthe moon to stream across the silver acres of farmland, jump a thick\r\nwood and tumble waves of radiance at their feet. In such a moonlight\r\nGloria\'s face was of a pervading, reminiscent white, and with a modicum\r\nof effort they would slip off the blinders of custom and each would find\r\nin the other almost the quintessential romance of the vanished June.\r\n\r\nOne night while her head lay upon his heart and their cigarettes glowed\r\nin swerving buttons of light through the dome of darkness over the bed,\r\nshe spoke for the first time and fragmentarily of the men who had hung\r\nfor brief moments on her beauty.\r\n\r\n"Do you ever think of them?" he asked her.\r\n\r\n"Only occasionally--when something happens that recalls a particular\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"What do you remember--their kisses?"\r\n\r\n"All sorts of things.... Men are different with women."\r\n\r\n"Different in what way?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, entirely--and quite inexpressibly. Men who had the most firmly\r\nrooted reputation for being this way or that would sometimes be\r\nsurprisingly inconsistent with me. Brutal men were tender, negligible\r\nmen were astonishingly loyal and lovable, and, often, honorable men took\r\nattitudes that were anything but honorable."\r\n\r\n"For instance?"\r\n\r\n"Well, there was a boy named Percy Wolcott from Cornell who was quite a\r\nhero in college, a great athlete, and saved a lot of people from a fire\r\nor something like that. But I soon found he was stupid in a rather\r\ndangerous way."\r\n\r\n"What way?"\r\n\r\n"It seems he had some naive conception of a woman \'fit to be his wife,\'\r\na particular conception that I used to run into a lot and that always\r\ndrove me wild. He demanded a girl who\'d never been kissed and who liked\r\nto sew and sit home and pay tribute to his self-esteem. And I\'ll bet a\r\nhat if he\'s gotten an idiot to sit and be stupid with him he\'s tearing\r\nout on the side with some much speedier lady."\r\n\r\n"I\'d be sorry for his wife."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t. Think what an ass she\'d be not to realize it before she\r\nmarried him. He\'s the sort whose idea of honoring and respecting a woman\r\nwould be never to give her any excitement. With the best intentions, he\r\nwas deep in the dark ages."\r\n\r\n"What was his attitude toward you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming to that. As I told you--or did I tell you?--he was mighty\r\ngood-looking: big brown honest eyes and one of those smiles that\r\nguarantee the heart behind it is twenty-karat gold. Being young and\r\ncredulous, I thought he had some discretion, so I kissed him fervently\r\none night when we were riding around after a dance at the Homestead at\r\nHot Springs. It had been a wonderful week, I remember--with the most\r\nluscious trees spread like green lather, sort of, all over the valley\r\nand a mist rising out of them on October mornings like bonfires lit to\r\nturn them brown--"\r\n\r\n"How about your friend with the ideals?" interrupted Anthony.\r\n\r\n"It seems that when he kissed me he began to think that perhaps he could\r\nget away with a little more, that I needn\'t be \'respected\' like this\r\nBeatrice Fairfax glad-girl of his imagination."\r\n\r\n"What\'d he do?"\r\n\r\n"Not much. I pushed him off a sixteen-foot embankment before he was well\r\nstarted."\r\n\r\n"Hurt him?" inquired Anthony with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Broke his arm and sprained his ankle. He told the story all over Hot\r\nSprings, and when his arm healed a man named Barley who liked me fought\r\nhim and broke it over again. Oh, it was all an awful mess. He threatened\r\nto sue Barley, and Barley--he was from Georgia--was seen buying a gun in\r\ntown. But before that mama had dragged me North again, much against my\r\nwill, so I never did find out all that happened--though I saw Barley\r\nonce in the Vanderbilt lobby."\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed long and loud.\r\n\r\n"What a career! I suppose I ought to be furious because you\'ve kissed so\r\nmany men. I\'m not, though."\r\n\r\nAt this she sat up in bed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s funny, but I\'m so sure that those kisses left no mark on me--no\r\ntaint of promiscuity, I mean--even though a man once told me in all\r\nseriousness that he hated to think I\'d been a public drinking glass."\r\n\r\n"He had his nerve."\r\n\r\n"I just laughed and told him to think of me rather as a loving-cup that\r\ngoes from hand to hand but should be valued none the less."\r\n\r\n"Somehow it doesn\'t bother me--on the other hand it would, of course, if\r\nyou\'d done any more than kiss them. But I believe _you\'re_ absolutely\r\nincapable of jealousy except as hurt vanity. Why don\'t you care what\r\nI\'ve done? Wouldn\'t you prefer it if I\'d been absolutely innocent?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all in the impression it might have made on you. _My_ kisses were\r\nbecause the man was good-looking, or because there was a slick moon, or\r\neven because I\'ve felt vaguely sentimental and a little stirred. But\r\nthat\'s all--it\'s had utterly no effect on me. But you\'d remember and let\r\nmemories haunt you and worry you."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you ever kissed any one like you\'ve kissed me?"\r\n\r\n"No," she answered simply. "As I\'ve told you, men have tried--oh, lots\r\nof things. Any pretty girl has that experience.... You see," she\r\nresumed, "it doesn\'t matter to me how many women you\'ve stayed with in\r\nthe past, so long as it was merely a physical satisfaction, but I don\'t\r\nbelieve I could endure the idea of your ever having lived with another\r\nwoman for a protracted period or even having wanted to marry some\r\npossible girl. It\'s different somehow. There\'d be all the little\r\nintimacies remembered--and they\'d dull that freshness that after all is\r\nthe most precious part of love."\r\n\r\nRapturously he pulled her down beside him on the pillow.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling," he whispered, "as if I remembered anything but your\r\ndear kisses."\r\n\r\nThen Gloria, in a very mild voice:\r\n\r\n"Anthony, did I hear anybody say they were thirsty?"\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed abruptly and with a sheepish and amused grin got out of\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n"With just a _little_ piece of ice in the water," she added. "Do you\r\nsuppose I could have that?"\r\n\r\nGloria used the adjective "little" whenever she asked a favor--it made\r\nthe favor sound less arduous. But Anthony laughed again--whether she\r\nwanted a cake of ice or a marble of it, he must go down-stairs to the\r\nkitchen.... Her voice followed him through the hall: "And just a\r\n_little_ cracker with just a _little_ marmalade on it...."\r\n\r\n"Oh, gosh!" sighed Anthony in rapturous slang, "she\'s wonderful, that\r\ngirl! She _has_ it!"\r\n\r\n"When we have a baby," she began one day--this, it had already been\r\ndecided, was to be after three years--"I want it to look like you."\r\n\r\n"Except its legs," he insinuated slyly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, except his legs. He\'s got to have my legs. But the rest of him\r\ncan be you."\r\n\r\n"My nose?"\r\n\r\nGloria hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps my nose. But certainly your eyes--and my mouth, and I\r\nguess my shape of the face. I wonder; I think he\'d be sort of cute if he\r\nhad my hair."\r\n\r\n"My dear Gloria, you\'ve appropriated the whole baby."\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t mean to," she apologized cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Let him have my neck at least," he urged, regarding himself gravely in\r\nthe glass. "You\'ve often said you liked my neck because the Adam\'s apple\r\ndoesn\'t show, and, besides, your neck\'s too short."\r\n\r\n"Why, it is _not_!" she cried indignantly, turning to the mirror, "it\'s\r\njust right. I don\'t believe I\'ve ever seen a better neck."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too short," he repeated teasingly.\r\n\r\n"Short?" Her tone expressed exasperated wonder.\r\n\r\n"Short? You\'re crazy!" She elongated and contracted it to convince\r\nherself of its reptilian sinuousness. "Do you call _that_ a short neck?"\r\n\r\n"One of the shortest I\'ve ever seen."\r\n\r\nFor the first time in weeks tears started from Gloria\'s eyes and the\r\nlook she gave him had a quality of real pain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Anthony--"\r\n\r\n"My Lord, Gloria!" He approached her in bewilderment and took her elbows\r\nin his hands. "Don\'t cry, _please_! Didn\'t you know I was only kidding?\r\nGloria, look at me! Why, dearest, you\'ve got the longest neck I\'ve ever\r\nseen. Honestly."\r\n\r\nHer tears dissolved in a twisted smile.\r\n\r\n"Well--you shouldn\'t have said that, then. Let\'s talk about the b-baby."\r\n\r\nAnthony paced the floor and spoke as though rehearsing for a debate.\r\n\r\n"To put it briefly, there are two babies we could have, two distinct and\r\nlogical babies, utterly differentiated. There\'s the baby that\'s the\r\ncombination of the best of both of us. Your body, my eyes, my mind, your\r\nintelligence--and then there is the baby which is our worst--my body,\r\nyour disposition, and my irresolution."\r\n\r\n"I like that second baby," she said.\r\n\r\n"What I\'d really like," continued Anthony, "would be to have two sets of\r\ntriplets one year apart and then experiment with the six boys--"\r\n\r\n"Poor me," she interjected.\r\n\r\n"--I\'d educate them each in a different country and by a different\r\nsystem and when they were twenty-three I\'d call them together and see\r\nwhat they were like."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s have \'em all with my neck," suggested Gloria.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF A CHAPTER\r\n\r\nThe car was at length repaired and with a deliberate vengeance took up\r\nwhere it left off the business of causing infinite dissension. Who\r\nshould drive? How fast should Gloria go? These two questions and the\r\neternal recriminations involved ran through the days. They motored to\r\nthe Post-Road towns, Rye, Portchester, and Greenwich, and called on a\r\ndozen friends, mostly Gloria\'s, who all seemed to be in different stages\r\nof having babies and in this respect as well as in others bored her to a\r\npoint of nervous distraction. For an hour after each visit she would\r\nbite her fingers furiously and be inclined to take out her rancor\r\non Anthony.\r\n\r\n"I loathe women," she cried in a mild temper. "What on earth can you say\r\nto them--except talk \'lady-lady\'? I\'ve enthused over a dozen babies that\r\nI\'ve wanted only to choke. And every one of those girls is either\r\nincipiently jealous and suspicious of her husband if he\'s charming or\r\nbeginning to be bored with him if he isn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you ever intend to see any women?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. They never seem clean to me--never--never. Except just a\r\nfew. Constance Shaw--you know, the Mrs. Merriam who came over to see us\r\nlast Tuesday--is almost the only one. She\'s so tall and fresh-looking\r\nand stately."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like them so tall."\r\n\r\nThough they went to several dinner dances at various country clubs, they\r\ndecided that the autumn was too nearly over for them to "go out" on any\r\nscale, even had they been so inclined. He hated golf; Gloria liked it\r\nonly mildly, and though she enjoyed a violent rush that some\r\nundergraduates gave her one night and was glad that Anthony should be\r\nproud of her beauty, she also perceived that their hostess for the\r\nevening, a Mrs. Granby, was somewhat disquieted by the fact that\r\nAnthony\'s classmate, Alec Granby, joined with enthusiasm in the rush.\r\nThe Granbys never phoned again, and though Gloria laughed, it piqued her\r\nnot a little.\r\n\r\n"You see," she explained to Anthony, "if I wasn\'t married it wouldn\'t\r\nworry her--but she\'s been to the movies in her day and she thinks I may\r\nbe a vampire. But the point is that placating such people requires an\r\neffort that I\'m simply unwilling to make.... And those cute little\r\nfreshmen making eyes at me and paying me idiotic compliments! I\'ve grown\r\nup, Anthony."\r\n\r\nMarietta itself offered little social life. Half a dozen farm-estates\r\nformed a hectagon around it, but these belonged to ancient men who\r\ndisplayed themselves only as inert, gray-thatched lumps in the back of\r\nlimousines on their way to the station, whither they were sometimes\r\naccompanied by equally ancient and doubly massive wives. The townspeople\r\nwere a particularly uninteresting type--unmarried females were\r\npredominant for the most part--with school-festival horizons and souls\r\nbleak as the forbidding white architecture of the three churches. The\r\nonly native with whom they came into close contact was the broad-hipped,\r\nbroad-shouldered Swedish girl who came every day to do their work. She\r\nwas silent and efficient, and Gloria, after finding her weeping\r\nviolently into her bowed arms upon the kitchen table, developed an\r\nuncanny fear of her and stopped complaining about the food. Because of\r\nher untold and esoteric grief the girl stayed on.\r\n\r\nGloria\'s penchant for premonitions and her bursts of vague\r\nsupernaturalism were a surprise to Anthony. Either some complex,\r\nproperly and scientifically inhibited in the early years with her\r\nBilphistic mother, or some inherited hypersensitiveness, made her\r\nsusceptible to any suggestion of the psychic, and, far from gullible\r\nabout the motives of people, she was inclined to credit any\r\nextraordinary happening attributed to the whimsical perambulations of\r\nthe buried. The desperate squeakings about the old house on windy nights\r\nthat to Anthony were burglars with revolvers ready in hand represented\r\nto Gloria the auras, evil and restive, of dead generations, expiating\r\nthe inexpiable upon the ancient and romantic hearth. One night, because\r\nof two swift bangs down-stairs, which Anthony fearfully but unavailingly\r\ninvestigated, they lay awake nearly until dawn asking each other\r\nexamination-paper questions about the history of the world.\r\n\r\nIn October Muriel came out for a two weeks\' visit. Gloria had\r\ncalled her on long-distance, and Miss Kane ended the conversation\r\ncharacteristically by saying "All-ll-ll righty. I\'ll be there with\r\nbells!" She arrived with a dozen popular songs under her arm.\r\n\r\n"You ought to have a phonograph out here in the country," she said,\r\n"just a little Vic--they don\'t cost much. Then whenever you\'re lonesome\r\nyou can have Caruso or Al Jolson right at your door."\r\n\r\nShe worried Anthony to distraction by telling him that "he was the first\r\nclever man she had ever known and she got so tired of shallow people."\r\nHe wondered that people fell in love with such women. Yet he supposed\r\nthat under a certain impassioned glance even she might take on a\r\nsoftness and promise.\r\n\r\nBut Gloria, violently showing off her love for Anthony, was diverted\r\ninto a state of purring content.\r\n\r\nFinally Richard Caramel arrived for a garrulous and to Gloria painfully\r\nliterary week-end, during which he discussed himself with Anthony long\r\nafter she lay in childlike sleep up-stairs.\r\n\r\n"It\'s been mighty funny, this success and all," said Dick. "Just before\r\nthe novel appeared I\'d been trying, without success, to sell some short\r\nstories. Then, after my book came out, I polished up three and had them\r\naccepted by one of the magazines that had rejected them before. I\'ve\r\ndone a lot of them since; publishers don\'t pay me for my book till\r\nthis winter."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let the victor belong to the spoils."\r\n\r\n"You mean write trash?" He considered. "If you mean deliberately\r\ninjecting a slushy fade-out into each one, I\'m not. But I don\'t suppose\r\nI\'m being so careful. I\'m certainly writing faster and I don\'t seem to\r\nbe thinking as much as I used to. Perhaps it\'s because I don\'t get any\r\nconversation, now that you\'re married and Maury\'s gone to Philadelphia.\r\nHaven\'t the old urge and ambition. Early success and all that."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t it worry you?"\r\n\r\n"Frantically. I get a thing I call sentence-fever that must be like\r\nbuck-fever--it\'s a sort of intense literary self-consciousness that\r\ncomes when I try to force myself. But the really awful days aren\'t when\r\nI think I can\'t write. They\'re when I wonder whether any writing is\r\nworth while at all--I mean whether I\'m not a sort of glorified buffoon."\r\n\r\n"I like to hear you talk that way," said Anthony with a touch of his old\r\npatronizing insolence. "I was afraid you\'d gotten a bit idiotic over\r\nyour work. Read the damnedest interview you gave out----"\r\n\r\nDick interrupted with an agonized expression.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord! Don\'t mention it. Young lady wrote it--most admiring young\r\nlady. Kept telling me my work was \'strong,\' and I sort of lost my head\r\nand made a lot of strange pronouncements. Some of it was good, though,\r\ndon\'t you think?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; that part about the wise writer writing for the youth of his\r\ngeneration, the critic of the next, and the schoolmaster of ever\r\nafterward."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I believe a lot of it," admitted Richard Caramel with a faint beam.\r\n"It simply was a mistake to give it out."\r\n\r\nIn November they moved into Anthony\'s apartment, from which they sallied\r\ntriumphantly to the Yale-Harvard and Harvard-Princeton football games,\r\nto the St. Nicholas ice-skating rink, to a thorough round of the\r\ntheatres and to a miscellany of entertainments--from small, staid dances\r\nto the great affairs that Gloria loved, held in those few houses where\r\nlackeys with powdered wigs scurried around in magnificent Anglomania\r\nunder the direction of gigantic majordomos. Their intention was to go\r\nabroad the first of the year or, at any rate, when the war was over.\r\nAnthony had actually completed a Chestertonian essay on the twelfth\r\ncentury by way of introduction to his proposed book and Gloria had done\r\nsome extensive research work on the question of Russian sable coats--in\r\nfact the winter was approaching quite comfortably, when the Bilphistic\r\ndemiurge decided suddenly in mid-December that Mrs. Gilbert\'s soul had\r\naged sufficiently in its present incarnation. In consequence Anthony\r\ntook a miserable and hysterical Gloria out to Kansas City, where, in the\r\nfashion of mankind, they paid the terrible and mind-shaking deference\r\nto the dead.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert became, for the first and last time in his life, a truly\r\npathetic figure. That woman he had broken to wait upon his body and play\r\ncongregation to his mind had ironically deserted him--just when he could\r\nnot much longer have supported her. Never again would he be able so\r\nsatisfactorily to bore and bully a human soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPOSIUM\r\n\r\nGloria had lulled Anthony\'s mind to sleep. She, who seemed of all women\r\nthe wisest and the finest, hung like a brilliant curtain across his\r\ndoorways, shutting out the light of the sun. In those first years what\r\nhe believed bore invariably the stamp of Gloria; he saw the sun always\r\nthrough the pattern of the curtain.\r\n\r\nIt was a sort of lassitude that brought them back to Marietta for\r\nanother summer. Through a golden enervating spring they had loitered,\r\nrestive and lazily extravagant, along the California coast, joining\r\nother parties intermittently and drifting from Pasadena to Coronado,\r\nfrom Coronado to Santa Barbara, with no purpose more apparent than\r\nGloria\'s desire to dance by different music or catch some infinitesimal\r\nvariant among the changing colors of the sea. Out of the Pacific there\r\nrose to greet them savage rocklands and equally barbaric hostelries\r\nbuilt that at tea-time one might drowse into a languid wicker bazaar\r\nglorified by the polo costumes of Southhampton and Lake Forest and\r\nNewport and Palm Beach. And, as the waves met and splashed and glittered\r\nin the most placid of the bays, so they joined this group and that, and\r\nwith them shifted stations, murmuring ever of those strange\r\nunsubstantial gaieties in wait just over the next green and\r\nfruitful valley.\r\n\r\nA simple healthy leisure class it was--the best of the men not\r\nunpleasantly undergraduate--they seemed to be on a perpetual candidates\r\nlist for some etherealized "Porcellian" or "Skull and Bones" extended\r\nout indefinitely into the world; the women, of more than average beauty,\r\nfragilely athletic, somewhat idiotic as hostesses but charming and\r\ninfinitely decorative as guests. Sedately and gracefully they danced the\r\nsteps of their selection in the balmy tea hours, accomplishing with a\r\ncertain dignity the movements so horribly burlesqued by clerk and chorus\r\ngirl the country over. It seemed ironic that in this lone and\r\ndiscredited offspring of the arts Americans should excel,\r\nunquestionably.\r\n\r\nHaving danced and splashed through a lavish spring, Anthony and Gloria\r\nfound that they had spent too much money and for this must go into\r\nretirement for a certain period. There was Anthony\'s "work," they said.\r\nAlmost before they knew it they were back in the gray house, more aware\r\nnow that other lovers had slept there, other names had been called over\r\nthe banisters, other couples had sat upon the porch steps watching the\r\ngray-green fields and the black bulk of woods beyond.\r\n\r\nIt was the same Anthony, more restless, inclined to quicken only under\r\nthe stimulus of several high-balls, faintly, almost imperceptibly,\r\napathetic toward Gloria. But Gloria--she would be twenty-four in August\r\nand was in an attractive but sincere panic about it. Six years to\r\nthirty! Had she been less in love with Anthony her sense of the flight\r\nof time would have expressed itself in a reawakened interest in other\r\nmen, in a deliberate intention of extracting a transient gleam of\r\nromance from every potential lover who glanced at her with lowered brows\r\nover a shining dinner table. She said to Anthony one day:\r\n\r\n"How I feel is that if I wanted anything I\'d take it. That\'s what I\'ve\r\nalways thought all my life. But it happens that I want you, and so I\r\njust haven\'t room for any other desires."\r\n\r\nThey were bound eastward through a parched and lifeless Indiana, and she\r\nhad looked up from one of her beloved moving picture magazines to find a\r\ncasual conversation suddenly turned grave.\r\n\r\nAnthony frowned out the car window. As the track crossed a country road\r\na farmer appeared momentarily in his wagon; he was chewing on a straw\r\nand was apparently the same farmer they had passed a dozen times before,\r\nsitting in silent and malignant symbolism. As Anthony turned to Gloria\r\nhis frown intensified.\r\n\r\n"You worry me," he objected; "I can imagine _wanting_ another woman\r\nunder certain transitory circumstances, but I can\'t imagine taking her."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t feel that way, Anthony. I can\'t be bothered resisting\r\nthings I want. My way is not to want them--to want nobody but you."\r\n\r\n"Yet when I think that if you just happened to take a fancy to some\r\none--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be an idiot!" she exclaimed. "There\'d be nothing casual about\r\nit. And I can\'t even imagine the possibility."\r\n\r\nThis emphatically closed the conversation. Anthony\'s unfailing\r\nappreciation made her happier in his company than in any one\'s else. She\r\ndefinitely enjoyed him--she loved him. So the summer began very much as\r\nhad the one before.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one radical change in menage. The icy-hearted\r\nScandinavian, whose austere cooking and sardonic manner of waiting on\r\ntable had so depressed Gloria, gave way to an exceedingly efficient\r\nJapanese whose name was Tanalahaka, but who confessed that he heeded any\r\nsummons which included the dissyllable "Tana."\r\n\r\nTana was unusually small even for a Japanese, and displayed a somewhat\r\nnaive conception of himself as a man of the world. On the day of his\r\narrival from "R. Gugimoniki, Japanese Reliable Employment Agency," he\r\ncalled Anthony into his room to see the treasures of his trunk. These\r\nincluded a large collection of Japanese post cards, which he was all for\r\nexplaining to his employer at once, individually and at great length.\r\nAmong them were half a dozen of pornographic intent and plainly of\r\nAmerican origin, though the makers had modestly omitted both their names\r\nand the form for mailing. He next brought out some of his own\r\nhandiwork--a pair of American pants, which he had made himself, and two\r\nsuits of solid silk underwear. He informed Anthony confidentially as to\r\nthe purpose for which these latter were reserved. The next exhibit was a\r\nrather good copy of an etching of Abraham Lincoln, to whose face he had\r\ngiven an unmistakable Japanese cast. Last came a flute; he had made it\r\nhimself but it was broken: he was going to fix it soon.\r\n\r\nAfter these polite formalities, which Anthony conjectured must be native\r\nto Japan, Tana delivered a long harangue in splintered English on the\r\nrelation of master and servant from which Anthony gathered that he had\r\nworked on large estates but had always quarrelled with the other\r\nservants because they were not honest. They had a great time over the\r\nword "honest," and in fact became rather irritated with each other,\r\nbecause Anthony persisted stubbornly that Tana was trying to say\r\n"hornets," and even went to the extent of buzzing in the manner of a bee\r\nand flapping his arms to imitate wings.\r\n\r\nAfter three-quarters of an hour Anthony was released with the warm\r\nassurance that they would have other nice chats in which Tana would tell\r\n"how we do in my countree."\r\n\r\nSuch was Tana\'s garrulous premiere in the gray house--and he fulfilled\r\nits promise. Though he was conscientious and honorable, he was\r\nunquestionably a terrific bore. He seemed unable to control his tongue,\r\nsometimes continuing from paragraph to paragraph with a look akin to\r\npain in his small brown eyes.\r\n\r\nSunday and Monday afternoons he read the comic sections of the\r\nnewspapers. One cartoon which contained a facetious Japanese butler\r\ndiverted him enormously, though he claimed that the protagonist, who to\r\nAnthony appeared clearly Oriental, had really an American face. The\r\ndifficulty with the funny paper was that when, aided by Anthony, he had\r\nspelled out the last three pictures and assimilated their context with a\r\nconcentration surely adequate for Kant\'s "Critique," he had entirely\r\nforgotten what the first pictures were about.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of June Anthony and Gloria celebrated their first\r\nanniversary by having a "date." Anthony knocked at the door and she ran\r\nto let him in. Then they sat together on the couch calling over those\r\nnames they had made for each other, new combinations of endearments ages\r\nold. Yet to this "date" was appended no attenuated good-night with its\r\necstasy of regret.\r\n\r\nLater in June horror leered out at Gloria, struck at her and frightened\r\nher bright soul back half a generation. Then slowly it faded out, faded\r\nback into that impenetrable darkness whence it had come--taking\r\nrelentlessly its modicum of youth.\r\n\r\nWith an infallible sense of the dramatic it chose a little railroad\r\nstation in a wretched village near Portchester. The station platform lay\r\nall day bare as a prairie, exposed to the dusty yellow sun and to the\r\nglance of that most obnoxious type of countryman who lives near a\r\nmetropolis and has attained its cheap smartness without its urbanity. A\r\ndozen of these yokels, red-eyed, cheerless as scarecrows, saw the\r\nincident. Dimly it passed across their confused and uncomprehending\r\nminds, taken at its broadest for a coarse joke, at its subtlest for a\r\n"shame." Meanwhile there upon the platform a measure of brightness faded\r\nfrom the world.\r\n\r\nWith Eric Merriam, Anthony had been sitting over a decanter of Scotch\r\nall the hot summer afternoon, while Gloria and Constance Merriam swam\r\nand sunned themselves at the Beach Club, the latter under a striped\r\nparasol-awning, Gloria stretched sensuously upon the soft hot sand,\r\ntanning her inevitable legs. Later they had all four played with\r\ninconsequential sandwiches; then Gloria had risen, tapping Anthony\'s\r\nknee with her parasol to get his attention.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to go, dear."\r\n\r\n"Now?" He looked at her unwillingly. At that moment nothing seemed of\r\nmore importance than to idle on that shady porch drinking mellowed\r\nScotch, while his host reminisced interminably on the byplay of some\r\nforgotten political campaign.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve really got to go," repeated Gloria. "We can get a taxi to the\r\nstation.... Come on, Anthony!" she commanded a bit more imperiously.\r\n\r\n"Now see here--" Merriam, his yarn cut off, made conventional\r\nobjections, meanwhile provocatively filling his guest\'s glass with a\r\nhigh-ball that should have been sipped through ten minutes. But at\r\nGloria\'s annoyed "We really _must!_" Anthony drank it off, got to his\r\nfeet and made an elaborate bow to his hostess.\r\n\r\n"It seems we \'must,\'" he said, with little grace.\r\n\r\nIn a minute he was following Gloria down a garden-walk between tall\r\nrose-bushes, her parasol brushing gently the June-blooming leaves. Most\r\ninconsiderate, he thought, as they reached the road. He felt with\r\ninjured naivete that Gloria should not have interrupted such innocent\r\nand harmless enjoyment. The whiskey had both soothed and clarified the\r\nrestless things in his mind. It occurred to him that she had taken this\r\nsame attitude several times before. Was he always to retreat from\r\npleasant episodes at a touch of her parasol or a flicker of her eye? His\r\nunwillingness blurred to ill will, which rose within him like a\r\nresistless bubble. He kept silent, perversely inhibiting a desire to\r\nreproach her. They found a taxi in front of the Inn; rode silently to\r\nthe little station....\r\n\r\nThen Anthony knew what he wanted--to assert his will against this cool\r\nand impervious girl, to obtain with one magnificent effort a mastery\r\nthat seemed infinitely desirable.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go over to see the Barneses," he said without looking at her. "I\r\ndon\'t feel like going home."\r\n\r\n--Mrs. Barnes, nee Rachael Jerryl, had a summer place several miles from\r\nRedgate.\r\n\r\n"We went there day before yesterday," she answered shortly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure they\'d be glad to see us." He felt that that was not a strong\r\nenough note, braced himself stubbornly, and added: "I want to see the\r\nBarneses. I haven\'t any desire to go home."\r\n\r\n"Well, I haven\'t any desire to go to the Barneses."\r\n\r\nSuddenly they stared at each other.\r\n\r\n"Why, Anthony," she said with annoyance, "this is Sunday night and they\r\nprobably have guests for supper. Why we should go in at this hour--"\r\n\r\n"Then why couldn\'t we have stayed at the Merriams\'?" he burst out. "Why\r\ngo home when we were having a perfectly decent time? They asked us\r\nto supper."\r\n\r\n"They had to. Give me the money and I\'ll get the railroad tickets."\r\n\r\n"I certainly will not! I\'m in no humour for a ride in that damn hot\r\ntrain."\r\n\r\nGloria stamped her foot on the platform.\r\n\r\n"Anthony, you act as if you\'re tight!"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I\'m perfectly sober."\r\n\r\nBut his voice had slipped into a husky key and she knew with certainty\r\nthat this was untrue.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re sober you\'ll give me the money for the tickets."\r\n\r\nBut it was too late to talk to him that way. In his mind was but one\r\nidea--that Gloria was being selfish, that she was always being selfish\r\nand would continue to be unless here and now he asserted himself as her\r\nmaster. This was the occasion of all occasions, since for a whim she had\r\ndeprived him of a pleasure. His determination solidified, approached\r\nmomentarily a dull and sullen hate.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go in the train," he said, his voice trembling a little with\r\nanger. "We\'re going to the Barneses."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not!" she cried. "If you go I\'m going home alone."\r\n\r\n"Go on, then."\r\n\r\nWithout a word she turned toward the ticket office; simultaneously he\r\nremembered that she had some money with her and that this was not the\r\nsort of victory he wanted, the sort he must have. He took a step after\r\nher and seized her arm.\r\n\r\n"See here!" he muttered, "you\'re _not_ going alone!"\r\n\r\n"I certainly am--why, Anthony!" This exclamation as she tried to pull\r\naway from him and he only tightened his grasp.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with narrowed and malicious eyes.\r\n\r\n"Let go!" Her cry had a quality of fierceness. "If you have _any_\r\ndecency you\'ll let go."\r\n\r\n"Why?" He knew why. But he took a confused and not quite confident pride\r\nin holding her there.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going home, do you understand? And you\'re going to let me go!"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not."\r\n\r\nHer eyes were burning now.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to make a scene here?"\r\n\r\n"I say you\'re not going! I\'m tired of your eternal selfishness!"\r\n\r\n"I only want to go home." Two wrathful tears started from her eyes.\r\n\r\n"This time you\'re going to do what _I_ say."\r\n\r\nSlowly her body straightened: her head went back in a gesture of\r\ninfinite scorn.\r\n\r\n"I hate you!" Her low words were expelled like venom through her\r\nclenched teeth. "Oh, _let_ me go! Oh, I _hate_ you!" She tried to jerk\r\nherself away but he only grasped the other arm. "I hate you! I\r\nhate you!"\r\n\r\nAt Gloria\'s fury his uncertainty returned, but he felt that now he had\r\ngone too far to give in. It seemed that he had always given in and that\r\nin her heart she had despised him for it. Ah, she might hate him now,\r\nbut afterward she would admire him for his dominance.\r\n\r\nThe approaching train gave out a premonitory siren that tumbled\r\nmelodramatically toward them down the glistening blue tracks. Gloria\r\ntugged and strained to free herself, and words older than the Book of\r\nGenesis came to her lips.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you brute!" she sobbed. "Oh, you brute! Oh, I hate you! Oh, you\r\nbrute! Oh--"\r\n\r\nOn the station platform other prospective passengers were beginning to\r\nturn and stare; the drone of the train was audible, it increased to a\r\nclamor. Gloria\'s efforts redoubled, then ceased altogether, and she\r\nstood there trembling and hot-eyed at this helpless humiliation, as the\r\nengine roared and thundered into the station.\r\n\r\nLow, below the flood of steam and the grinding of the brakes came her\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n"Oh, if there was one _man_ here you couldn\'t do this! You couldn\'t do\r\nthis! You coward! You coward, oh, you coward!"\r\n\r\nAnthony, silent, trembling himself, gripped her rigidly, aware that\r\nfaces, dozens of them, curiously unmoved, shadows of a dream, were\r\nregarding him. Then the bells distilled metallic crashes that were like\r\nphysical pain, the smoke-stacks volleyed in slow acceleration at the\r\nsky, and in a moment of noise and gray gaseous turbulence the line of\r\nfaces ran by, moved off, became indistinct--until suddenly there was\r\nonly the sun slanting east across the tracks and a volume of sound\r\ndecreasing far off like a train made out of tin thunder. He dropped her\r\narms. He had won.\r\n\r\nNow, if he wished, he might laugh. The test was done and he had\r\nsustained his will with violence. Let leniency walk in the wake\r\nof victory.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll hire a car here and drive back to Marietta," he said with fine\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nFor answer Gloria seized his hand with both of hers and raising it to\r\nher mouth bit deeply into his thumb. He scarcely noticed the pain;\r\nseeing the blood spurt he absent-mindedly drew out his handkerchief and\r\nwrapped the wound. That too was part of the triumph he supposed--it was\r\ninevitable that defeat should thus be resented--and as such was\r\nbeneath notice.\r\n\r\nShe was sobbing, almost without tears, profoundly and bitterly.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go! I won\'t go! You--can\'t--make--me--go! You\'ve--you\'ve killed\r\nany love I ever had for you, and any respect. But all that\'s left in me\r\nwould die before I\'d move from this place. Oh, if I\'d thought _you\'d_\r\nlay your hands on me--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re going with me," he said brutally, "if I have to carry you."\r\n\r\nHe turned, beckoned to a taxicab, told the driver to go to Marietta. The\r\nman dismounted and swung the door open. Anthony faced his wife and said\r\nbetween his clenched teeth:\r\n\r\n"Will you get in?--or will I _put_ you in?"\r\n\r\nWith a subdued cry of infinite pain and despair she yielded herself up\r\nand got into the car.\r\n\r\nAll the long ride, through the increasing dark of twilight, she sat\r\nhuddled in her side of the car, her silence broken by an occasional dry\r\nand solitary sob. Anthony stared out the window, his mind working dully\r\non the slowly changing significance of what had occurred. Something was\r\nwrong--that last cry of Gloria\'s had struck a chord which echoed\r\nposthumously and with incongruous disquiet in his heart. He must be\r\nright--yet, she seemed such a pathetic little thing now, broken and\r\ndispirited, humiliated beyond the measure of her lot to bear. The\r\nsleeves of her dress were torn; her parasol was gone, forgotten on the\r\nplatform. It was a new costume, he remembered, and she had been so proud\r\nof it that very morning when they had left the house.... He began\r\nwondering if any one they knew had seen the incident. And persistently\r\nthere recurred to him her cry:\r\n\r\n"All that\'s left in me would die--"\r\n\r\nThis gave him a confused and increasing worry. It fitted so well with\r\nthe Gloria who lay in the corner--no longer a proud Gloria, nor any\r\nGloria he had known. He asked himself if it were possible. While he did\r\nnot believe she would cease to love him--this, of course, was\r\nunthinkable--it was yet problematical whether Gloria without her\r\narrogance, her independence, her virginal confidence and courage, would\r\nbe the girl of his glory, the radiant woman who was precious and\r\ncharming because she was ineffably, triumphantly herself.\r\n\r\nHe was very drunk even then, so drunk as not to realize his own\r\ndrunkenness. When they reached the gray house he went to his own room\r\nand, his mind still wrestling helplessly and sombrely with what he had\r\ndone, fell into a deep stupor on his bed.\r\n\r\nIt was after one o\'clock and the hall seemed extraordinarily quiet when\r\nGloria, wide-eyed and sleepless, traversed it and pushed open the door\r\nof his room. He had been too befuddled to open the windows and the air\r\nwas stale and thick with whiskey. She stood for a moment by his bed, a\r\nslender, exquisitely graceful figure in her boyish silk pajamas--then\r\nwith abandon she flung herself upon him, half waking him in the frantic\r\nemotion of her embrace, dropping her warm tears upon his throat.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Anthony!" she cried passionately, "oh, my darling, you don\'t know\r\nwhat you did!"\r\n\r\nYet in the morning, coming early into her room, he knelt down by her bed\r\nand cried like a little boy, as though it was his heart that had\r\nbeen broken.\r\n\r\n"It seemed, last night," she said gravely, her fingers playing in his\r\nhair, "that all the part of me you loved, the part that was worth\r\nknowing, all the pride and fire, was gone. I knew that what was left of\r\nme would always love you, but never in quite the same way."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she was aware even then that she would forget in time and\r\nthat it is the manner of life seldom to strike but always to wear away.\r\nAfter that morning the incident was never mentioned and its deep wound\r\nhealed with Anthony\'s hand--and if there was triumph some darker force\r\nthan theirs possessed it, possessed the knowledge and the victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIETZSCHEAN INCIDENT\r\n\r\nGloria\'s independence, like all sincere and profound qualities, had\r\nbegun unconsciously, but, once brought to her attention by Anthony\'s\r\nfascinated discovery of it, it assumed more nearly the proportions of a\r\nformal code. From her conversation it might be assumed that all her\r\nenergy and vitality went into a violent affirmation of the negative\r\nprinciple "Never give a damn."\r\n\r\n"Not for anything or anybody," she said, "except myself and, by\r\nimplication, for Anthony. That\'s the rule of all life and if it weren\'t\r\nI\'d be that way anyhow. Nobody\'d do anything for me if it didn\'t gratify\r\nthem to, and I\'d do as little for them."\r\n\r\nShe was on the front porch of the nicest lady in Marietta when she said\r\nthis, and as she finished she gave a curious little cry and sank in a\r\ndead faint to the porch floor.\r\n\r\nThe lady brought her to and drove her home in her car. It had occurred\r\nto the estimable Gloria that she was probably with child.\r\n\r\nShe lay upon the long lounge down-stairs. Day was slipping warmly out\r\nthe window, touching the late roses on the porch pillars.\r\n\r\n"All I think of ever is that I love you," she wailed. "I value my body\r\nbecause you think it\'s beautiful. And this body of mine--of yours--to\r\nhave it grow ugly and shapeless? It\'s simply intolerable. Oh, Anthony,\r\nI\'m not afraid of the pain."\r\n\r\nHe consoled her desperately--but in vain. She continued:\r\n\r\n"And then afterward I might have wide hips and be pale, with all my\r\nfreshness gone and no radiance in my hair."\r\n\r\nHe paced the floor with his hands in his pockets, asking:\r\n\r\n"Is it certain?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything. I\'ve always hated obstrics, or whatever you call\r\nthem. I thought I\'d have a child some time. But not now."\r\n\r\n"Well, for God\'s sake don\'t lie there and go to pieces."\r\n\r\nHer sobs lapsed. She drew down a merciful silence from the twilight\r\nwhich filled the room. "Turn on the lights," she pleaded. "These days\r\nseem so short--June seemed--to--have--longer days when I was a\r\nlittle girl."\r\n\r\nThe lights snapped on and it was as though blue drapes of softest silk\r\nhad been dropped behind the windows and the door. Her pallor, her\r\nimmobility, without grief now, or joy, awoke his sympathy.\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to have it?" she asked listlessly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m indifferent. That is, I\'m neutral. If you have it I\'ll probably be\r\nglad. If you don\'t--well, that\'s all right too."\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d make up your mind one way or the other!"\r\n\r\n"Suppose you make up _your_ mind."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him contemptuously, scorning to answer.\r\n\r\n"You\'d think you\'d been singled out of all the women in the world for\r\nthis crowning indignity."\r\n\r\n"What if I do!" she cried angrily. "It isn\'t an indignity for them. It\'s\r\ntheir one excuse for living. It\'s the one thing they\'re good for. It\r\n_is_ an indignity for _me._\r\n\r\n"See here, Gloria, I\'m with you whatever you do, but for God\'s sake be a\r\nsport about it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t _fuss_ at me!" she wailed.\r\n\r\nThey exchanged a mute look of no particular significance but of much\r\nstress. Then Anthony took a book from the shelf and dropped into\r\na chair.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later her voice came out of the intense stillness that\r\npervaded the room and hung like incense on the air.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll drive over and see Constance Merriam to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"All right. And I\'ll go to Tarrytown and see Grampa."\r\n\r\n"--You see," she added, "it isn\'t that I\'m afraid--of this or anything\r\nelse. I\'m being true to me, you know."\r\n\r\n"I know," he agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICAL MEN\r\n\r\nAdam Patch, in a pious rage against the Germans, subsisted on the war\r\nnews. Pin maps plastered his walls; atlases were piled deep on tables\r\nconvenient to his hand together with "Photographic Histories of the\r\nWorld War," official Explain-alls, and the "Personal Impressions" of war\r\ncorrespondents and of Privates X, Y, and Z. Several times during\r\nAnthony\'s visit his grandfather\'s secretary, Edward Shuttleworth, the\r\none-time "Accomplished Gin-physician" of "Pat\'s Place" in Hoboken, now\r\nshod with righteous indignation, would appear with an extra. The old man\r\nattacked each paper with untiring fury, tearing out those columns which\r\nappeared to him of sufficient pregnancy for preservation and thrusting\r\nthem into one of his already bulging files.\r\n\r\n"Well, what have you been doing?" he asked Anthony blandly. "Nothing?\r\nWell, I thought so. I\'ve been intending to drive over and see you,\r\nall summer."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been writing. Don\'t you remember the essay I sent you--the one I\r\nsold to The Florentine last winter?"\r\n\r\n"Essay? You never sent _me_ any essay."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I did. We talked about it."\r\n\r\nAdam Patch shook his head mildly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. You never sent _me_ any essay. You may have thought you sent it\r\nbut it never reached me."\r\n\r\n"Why, you read it, Grampa," insisted Anthony, somewhat exasperated, "you\r\nread it and disagreed with it."\r\n\r\nThe old man suddenly remembered, but this was made apparent only by a\r\npartial falling open of his mouth, displaying rows of gray gums. Eying\r\nAnthony with a green and ancient stare he hesitated between confessing\r\nhis error and covering it up.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re writing," he said quickly. "Well, why don\'t you go over and\r\nwrite about these Germans? Write something real, something about what\'s\r\ngoing on, something people can read."\r\n\r\n"Anybody can\'t be a war correspondent," objected Anthony. "You have to\r\nhave some newspaper willing to buy your stuff. And I can\'t spare the\r\nmoney to go over as a free-lance."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll send you over," suggested his grandfather surprisingly. "I\'ll get\r\nyou over as an authorized correspondent of any newspaper you pick out."\r\n\r\nAnthony recoiled from the idea--almost simultaneously he bounded toward\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"I--don\'t--know--"\r\n\r\nHe would have to leave Gloria, whose whole life yearned toward him and\r\nenfolded him. Gloria was in trouble. Oh, the thing wasn\'t\r\nfeasible--yet--he saw himself in khaki, leaning, as all war\r\ncorrespondents lean, upon a heavy stick, portfolio at shoulder--trying\r\nto look like an Englishman. "I\'d like to think it over," he, confessed.\r\n"It\'s certainly very kind of you. I\'ll think it over and I\'ll let\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\nThinking it over absorbed him on the journey to New York. He had had one\r\nof those sudden flashes of illumination vouchsafed to all men who are\r\ndominated by a strong and beloved woman, which show them a world of\r\nharder men, more fiercely trained and grappling with the abstractions of\r\nthought and war. In that world the arms of Gloria would exist only as\r\nthe hot embrace of a chance mistress, coolly sought and quickly\r\nforgotten....\r\n\r\nThese unfamiliar phantoms were crowding closely about him when he\r\nboarded his train for Marietta, in the Grand Central Station. The car\r\nwas crowded; he secured the last vacant seat and it was only after\r\nseveral minutes that he gave even a casual glance to the man beside him.\r\nWhen he did he saw a heavy lay of jaw and nose, a curved chin and small,\r\npuffed-under eyes. In a moment he recognized Joseph Bloeckman.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously they both half rose, were half embarrassed, and exchanged\r\nwhat amounted to a half handshake. Then, as though to complete the\r\nmatter, they both half laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well," remarked Anthony without inspiration, "I haven\'t seen you for a\r\nlong time." Immediately he regretted his words and started to add: "I\r\ndidn\'t know you lived out this way." But Bloeckman anticipated him by\r\nasking pleasantly:\r\n\r\n"How\'s your wife? ..."\r\n\r\n"She\'s very well. How\'ve you been?"\r\n\r\n"Excellent." His tone amplified the grandeur of the word.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Anthony that during the last year Bloeckman had grown\r\ntremendously in dignity. The boiled look was gone, he seemed "done" at\r\nlast. In addition he was no longer overdressed. The inappropriate\r\nfacetiousness he had affected in ties had given way to a sturdy dark\r\npattern, and his right hand, which had formerly displayed two heavy\r\nrings, was now innocent of ornament and even without the raw glow of\r\na manicure.\r\n\r\nThis dignity appeared also in his personality. The last aura of the\r\nsuccessful travelling-man had faded from him, that deliberate\r\ningratiation of which the lowest form is the bawdy joke in the Pullman\r\nsmoker. One imagined that, having been fawned upon financially, he had\r\nattained aloofness; having been snubbed socially, he had acquired\r\nreticence. But whatever had given him weight instead of bulk, Anthony no\r\nlonger felt a correct superiority in his presence.\r\n\r\n"D\'you remember Caramel, Richard Caramel? I believe you met him one\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"I remember. He was writing a book."\r\n\r\n"Well, he sold it to the movies. Then they had some scenario man named\r\nJordan work on it. Well, Dick subscribes to a clipping bureau and he\'s\r\nfurious because about half the movie reviewers speak of the \'power and\r\nstrength of William Jordan\'s "Demon Lover."\' Didn\'t mention old Dick at\r\nall. You\'d think this fellow Jordan had actually conceived and developed\r\nthe thing."\r\n\r\nBloeckman nodded comprehensively.\r\n\r\n"Most of the contracts state that the original writer\'s name goes into\r\nall the paid publicity. Is Caramel still writing?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Writing hard. Short stories."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s fine, that\'s fine.... You on this train often?"\r\n\r\n"About once a week. We live in Marietta."\r\n\r\n"Is that so? Well, well! I live near Cos Cob myself. Bought a place\r\nthere only recently. We\'re only five miles apart."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to come and see us." Anthony was surprised at his own\r\ncourtesy. "I\'m sure Gloria\'d be delighted to see an old friend.\r\nAnybody\'ll tell you where the house is--it\'s our second season there."\r\n\r\n"Thank you." Then, as though returning a complementary politeness: "How\r\nis your grandfather?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s been well. I had lunch with him to-day."\r\n\r\n"A great character," said Bloeckman severely. "A fine example of an\r\nAmerican."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF LETHARGY\r\n\r\nAnthony found his wife deep in the porch hammock voluptuously engaged\r\nwith a lemonade and a tomato sandwich and carrying on an apparently\r\ncheery conversation with Tana upon one of Tana\'s complicated themes.\r\n\r\n"In my countree," Anthony recognized his invariable preface, "all\r\ntime--peoples--eat rice--because haven\'t got. Cannot eat what no have\r\ngot." Had his nationality not been desperately apparent one would have\r\nthought he had acquired his knowledge of his native land from American\r\nprimary-school geographies.\r\n\r\nWhen the Oriental had been squelched and dismissed to the kitchen,\r\nAnthony turned questioningly to Gloria:\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right," she announced, smiling broadly. "And it surprised me\r\nmore than it does you."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt?"\r\n\r\n"None! Couldn\'t be!"\r\n\r\nThey rejoiced happily, gay again with reborn irresponsibility. Then he\r\ntold her of his opportunity to go abroad, and that he was almost ashamed\r\nto reject it.\r\n\r\n"What do _you_ think? Just tell me frankly."\r\n\r\n"Why, Anthony!" Her eyes were startled. "Do you want to go? Without me?"\r\n\r\nHis face fell--yet he knew, with his wife\'s question, that it was too\r\nlate. Her arms, sweet and strangling, were around him, for he had made\r\nall such choices back in that room in the Plaza the year before. This\r\nwas an anachronism from an age of such dreams.\r\n\r\n"Gloria," he lied, in a great burst of comprehension, "of course I\r\ndon\'t. I was thinking you might go as a nurse or something." He wondered\r\ndully if his grandfather would consider this.\r\n\r\nAs she smiled he realized again how beautiful she was, a gorgeous girl\r\nof miraculous freshness and sheerly honorable eyes. She embraced his\r\nsuggestion with luxurious intensity, holding it aloft like a sun of her\r\nown making and basking in its beams. She strung together an amazing\r\nsynopsis for an extravaganza of martial adventure.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, surfeited with the subject, she yawned. She wanted not to\r\ntalk but only to read "Penrod," stretched upon the lounge until at\r\nmidnight she fell asleep. But Anthony, after he had carried her\r\nromantically up the stairs, stayed awake to brood upon the day, vaguely\r\nangry with her, vaguely dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n"What am I going to do?" he began at breakfast. "Here we\'ve been married\r\na year and we\'ve just worried around without even being efficient people\r\nof leisure."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you ought to do something," she admitted, being in an agreeable\r\nand loquacious humor. This was not the first of these discussions, but\r\nas they usually developed Anthony in the role of protagonist, she had\r\ncome to avoid them.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that I have any moral compunctions about work," he continued,\r\n"but grampa may die to-morrow and he may live for ten years. Meanwhile\r\nwe\'re living above our income and all we\'ve got to show for it is a\r\nfarmer\'s car and a few clothes. We keep an apartment that we\'ve only\r\nlived in three months and a little old house way off in nowhere. We\'re\r\nfrequently bored and yet we won\'t make any effort to know any one except\r\nthe same crowd who drift around California all summer wearing sport\r\nclothes and waiting for their families to die."\r\n\r\n"How you\'ve changed!" remarked Gloria. "Once you told me you didn\'t see\r\nwhy an American couldn\'t loaf gracefully."\r\n\r\n"Well, damn it, I wasn\'t married. And the old mind was working at top\r\nspeed and now it\'s going round and round like a cog-wheel with nothing\r\nto catch it. As a matter of fact I think that if I hadn\'t met you I\r\n_would_ have done something. But you make leisure so subtly\r\nattractive--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s all my fault--"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean that, and you know I didn\'t. But here I\'m almost\r\ntwenty-seven and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh," she interrupted in vexation, "you make me tired! Talking as though\r\nI were objecting or hindering you!"\r\n\r\n"I was just discussing it, Gloria. Can\'t I discuss--"\r\n\r\n"I should think you\'d be strong enough to settle--"\r\n\r\n"--something with you without--"\r\n\r\n"--your own problems without coming to me. You _talk_ a lot about going\r\nto work. I could use more money very easily, but _I\'m_ not complaining.\r\nWhether you work or not I love you." Her last words were gentle as fine\r\nsnow upon hard ground. But for the moment neither was attending to the\r\nother--they were each engaged in polishing and perfecting his\r\nown attitude.\r\n\r\n"I have worked--some." This by Anthony was an imprudent bringing up of\r\nraw reserves. Gloria laughed, torn between delight and derision; she\r\nresented his sophistry as at the same time she admired his nonchalance.\r\nShe would never blame him for being the ineffectual idler so long as he\r\ndid it sincerely, from the attitude that nothing much was worth doing.\r\n\r\n"Work!" she scoffed. "Oh, you sad bird! You bluffer! Work--that means a\r\ngreat arranging of the desk and the lights, a great sharpening of\r\npencils, and \'Gloria, don\'t sing!\' and \'Please keep that damn Tana away\r\nfrom me,\' and \'Let me read you my opening sentence,\' and \'I won\'t be\r\nthrough for a long time, Gloria, so don\'t stay up for me,\' and a\r\ntremendous consumption of tea or coffee. And that\'s all. In just about\r\nan hour I hear the old pencil stop scratching and look over. You\'ve got\r\nout a book and you\'re \'looking up\' something. Then you\'re reading. Then\r\nyawns--then bed and a great tossing about because you\'re all full of\r\ncaffeine and can\'t sleep. Two weeks later the whole performance\r\nover again."\r\n\r\nWith much difficulty Anthony retained a scanty breech-clout of dignity.\r\n\r\n"Now that\'s a _slight_ exaggeration. You know _darn well_ I sold an\r\nessay to The Florentine--and it attracted a lot of attention considering\r\nthe circulation of The Florentine. And what\'s more, Gloria, you know I\r\nsat up till five o\'clock in the morning finishing it."\r\n\r\nShe lapsed into silence, giving him rope. And if he had not hanged\r\nhimself he had certainly come to the end of it.\r\n\r\n"At least," he concluded feebly, "I\'m perfectly willing to be a war\r\ncorrespondent."\r\n\r\nBut so was Gloria. They were both willing--anxious; they assured each\r\nother of it. The evening ended on a note of tremendous sentiment, the\r\nmajesty of leisure, the ill health of Adam Patch, love at any cost.\r\n\r\n"Anthony!" she called over the banister one afternoon a week later,\r\n"there\'s some one at the door." Anthony, who had been lolling in the\r\nhammock on the sun-speckled south porch, strolled around to the front of\r\nthe house. A foreign car, large and impressive, crouched like an immense\r\nand saturnine bug at the foot of the path. A man in a soft pongee suit,\r\nwith cap to match, hailed him.\r\n\r\n"Hello there, Patch. Ran over to call on you."\r\n\r\nIt was Bloeckman; as always, infinitesimally improved, of subtler\r\nintonation, of more convincing ease.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully glad you did." Anthony raised his voice to a vine-covered\r\nwindow: "Glor-i-_a_! We\'ve got a visitor!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m in the tub," wailed Gloria politely.\r\n\r\nWith a smile the two men acknowledged the triumph of her alibi.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll be down. Come round here on the side-porch. Like a drink?\r\nGloria\'s always in the tub--good third of every day."\r\n\r\n"Pity she doesn\'t live on the Sound."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t afford it."\r\n\r\nAs coming from Adam Patch\'s grandson, Bloeckman took this as a form of\r\npleasantry. After fifteen minutes filled with estimable brilliancies,\r\nGloria appeared, fresh in starched yellow, bringing atmosphere and an\r\nincrease of vitality.\r\n\r\n"I want to be a successful sensation in the movies," she announced. "I\r\nhear that Mary Pickford makes a million dollars annually."\r\n\r\n"You could, you know," said Bloeckman. "I think you\'d film very well."\r\n\r\n"Would you let me, Anthony? If I only play unsophisticated roles?"\r\n\r\nAs the conversation continued in stilted commas, Anthony wondered that\r\nto him and Bloeckman both this girl had once been the most stimulating,\r\nthe most tonic personality they had ever known--and now the three sat\r\nlike overoiled machines, without conflict, without fear, without\r\nelation, heavily enamelled little figures secure beyond enjoyment in a\r\nworld where death and war, dull emotion and noble savagery were covering\r\na continent with the smoke of terror.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he would call Tana and they would pour into themselves a gay\r\nand delicate poison which would restore them momentarily to the\r\npleasurable excitement of childhood, when every face in a crowd had\r\ncarried its suggestion of splendid and significant transactions taking\r\nplace somewhere to some magnificent and illimitable purpose.... Life was\r\nno more than this summer afternoon; a faint wind stirring the lace\r\ncollar of Gloria\'s dress; the slow baking drowsiness of the veranda....\r\nIntolerably unmoved they all seemed, removed from any romantic imminency\r\nof action. Even Gloria\'s beauty needed wild emotions, needed poignancy,\r\nneeded death....\r\n\r\n"... Any day next week," Bloeckman was saying to Gloria. "Here--take\r\nthis card. What they do is to give you a test of about three hundred\r\nfeet of film, and they can tell pretty accurately from that."\r\n\r\n"How about Wednesday?"\r\n\r\n"Wednesday\'s fine. Just phone me and I\'ll go around with you--"\r\n\r\nHe was on his feet, shaking hands briskly--then his car was a wraith of\r\ndust down the road. Anthony turned to his wife in bewilderment.\r\n\r\n"Why, Gloria!"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mind if I have a trial, Anthony. Just a trial? I\'ve got to go\r\nto town Wednesday, _any_how."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s so silly! You don\'t want to go into the movies--moon around a\r\nstudio all day with a lot of cheap chorus people."\r\n\r\n"Lot of mooning around Mary Pickford does!"\r\n\r\n"Everybody isn\'t a Mary Pickford."\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t see how you\'d object to my _try_ing."\r\n\r\n"I do, though. I hate actors."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you make me tired. Do you imagine I have a very thrilling time\r\ndozing on this damn porch?"\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t mind if you loved me."\r\n\r\n"Of course I love you," she said impatiently, making out a quick case\r\nfor herself. "It\'s just because I do that I hate to see you go to pieces\r\nby just lying around and saying you ought to work. Perhaps if I _did_ go\r\ninto this for a while it\'d stir you up so you\'d do something."\r\n\r\n"It\'s just your craving for excitement, that\'s all it is."\r\n\r\n"Maybe it is! It\'s a perfectly natural craving, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll tell you one thing. If you go to the movies I\'m going to\r\nEurope."\r\n\r\n"Well, go on then! _I\'m_ not stopping you!"\r\n\r\nTo show she was not stopping him she melted into melancholy tears.\r\nTogether they marshalled the armies of sentiment--words, kisses,\r\nendearments, self-reproaches. They attained nothing. Inevitably they\r\nattained nothing. Finally, in a burst of gargantuan emotion each of them\r\nsat down and wrote a letter. Anthony\'s was to his grandfather; Gloria\'s\r\nwas to Joseph Bloeckman. It was a triumph of lethargy.\r\n\r\nOne day early in July Anthony, returned from an afternoon in New York,\r\ncalled up-stairs to Gloria. Receiving no answer he guessed she was\r\nasleep and so went into the pantry for one of the little sandwiches that\r\nwere always prepared for them. He found Tana seated at the kitchen table\r\nbefore a miscellaneous assortment of odds and ends--cigar-boxes, knives,\r\npencils, the tops of cans, and some scraps of paper covered with\r\nelaborate figures and diagrams.\r\n\r\n"What the devil you doing?" demanded Anthony curiously.\r\n\r\nTana politely grinned.\r\n\r\n"I show you," he exclaimed enthusiastically. "I tell--"\r\n\r\n"You making a dog-house?"\r\n\r\n"No, sa." Tana grinned again. "Make typewutta."\r\n\r\n"Typewriter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sa. I think, oh all time I think, lie in bed think \'bout\r\ntypewutta."\r\n\r\n"So you thought you\'d make one, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Wait. I tell."\r\n\r\nAnthony, munching a sandwich, leaned leisurely against the sink. Tana\r\nopened and closed his mouth several times as though testing its capacity\r\nfor action. Then with a rush he began:\r\n\r\n"I been think--typewutta--has, oh, many many many many _thing_. Oh many\r\nmany many many." "Many keys. I see."\r\n\r\n"No-o? _Yes_-key! Many many many many lettah. Like so a-b-c."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'re right."\r\n\r\n"Wait. I tell." He screwed his face up in a tremendous effort to express\r\nhimself: "I been think--many words--end same. Like i-n-g."\r\n\r\n"You bet. A whole raft of them."\r\n\r\n"So--I make--typewutta--quick. Not so many lettah--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a great idea, Tana. Save time. You\'ll make a fortune. Press one\r\nkey and there\'s \'ing.\' Hope you work it out."\r\n\r\nTana laughed disparagingly. "Wait. I tell--" "Where\'s Mrs. Patch?"\r\n\r\n"She out. Wait, I tell--" Again he screwed up his face for action. "_My_\r\ntypewutta----"\r\n\r\n"Where is she?"\r\n\r\n"Here--I make." He pointed to the miscellany of junk on the table.\r\n\r\n"I mean Mrs. Patch."\r\n\r\n"She out." Tana reassured him. "She be back five o\'clock, she say."\r\n\r\n"Down in the village?"\r\n\r\n"No. Went off before lunch. She go Mr. Bloeckman."\r\n\r\nAnthony started.\r\n\r\n"Went out with Mr. Bloeckman?"\r\n\r\n"She be back five."\r\n\r\nWithout a word Anthony left the kitchen with Tana\'s disconsolate "I\r\ntell" trailing after him. So this was Gloria\'s idea of excitement, by\r\nGod! His fists were clenched; within a moment he had worked himself up\r\nto a tremendous pitch of indignation. He went to the door and looked\r\nout; there was no car in sight and his watch stood at four minutes of\r\nfive. With furious energy he dashed down to the end of the path--as far\r\nas the bend of the road a mile off he could see no car--except--but it\r\nwas a farmer\'s flivver. Then, in an undignified pursuit of dignity, he\r\nrushed back to the shelter of the house as quickly as he had rushed out.\r\n\r\nPacing up and down the living room he began an angry rehearsal of the\r\nspeech he would make to her when she came in--\r\n\r\n"So this is love!" he would begin--or no, it sounded too much like the\r\npopular phrase "So this is Paris!" He must be dignified, hurt, grieved.\r\nAnyhow--"So this is what _you_ do when I have to go up and trot all day\r\naround the hot city on business. No wonder I can\'t write! No wonder I\r\ndon\'t dare let you out of my sight!" He was expanding now, warming to\r\nhis subject. "I\'ll tell you," he continued, "I\'ll tell you--" He paused,\r\ncatching a familiar ring in the words--then he realized--it was\r\nTana\'s "I tell."\r\n\r\nYet Anthony neither laughed nor seemed absurd to himself. To his frantic\r\nimagination it was already six--seven--eight, and she was never coming!\r\nBloeckman finding her bored and unhappy had persuaded her to go to\r\nCalifornia with him....\r\n\r\n--There was a great to-do out in front, a joyous "Yoho, Anthony!" and he\r\nrose trembling, weakly happy to see her fluttering up the path.\r\nBloeckman was following, cap in hand.\r\n\r\n"Dearest!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been for the best jaunt--all over New York State."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to be starting home," said Bloeckman, almost immediately.\r\n"Wish you\'d both been here when I came."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I wasn\'t," answered Anthony dryly. When he had departed\r\nAnthony hesitated. The fear was gone from his heart, yet he felt that\r\nsome protest was ethically apropos. Gloria resolved his uncertainty.\r\n\r\n"I knew you wouldn\'t mind. He came just before lunch and said he had to\r\ngo to Garrison on business and wouldn\'t I go with him. He looked so\r\nlonesome, Anthony. And I drove his car all the way."\r\n\r\nListlessly Anthony dropped into a chair, his mind tired--tired with\r\nnothing, tired with everything, with the world\'s weight he had never\r\nchosen to bear. He was ineffectual and vaguely helpless here as he had\r\nalways been. One of those personalities who, in spite of all their\r\nwords, are inarticulate, he seemed to have inherited only the vast\r\ntradition of human failure--that, and the sense of death.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I don\'t care," he answered.\r\n\r\nOne must be broad about these things, and Gloria being young, being\r\nbeautiful, must have reasonable privileges. Yet it wearied him that he\r\nfailed to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER\r\n\r\nShe rolled over on her back and lay still for a moment in the great bed\r\nwatching the February sun suffer one last attenuated refinement in its\r\npassage through the leaded panes into the room. For a time she had no\r\naccurate sense of her whereabouts or of the events of the day before, or\r\nthe day before that; then, like a suspended pendulum, memory began to\r\nbeat out its story, releasing with each swing a burdened quota of time\r\nuntil her life was given back to her.\r\n\r\nShe could hear, now, Anthony\'s troubled breathing beside her; she could\r\nsmell whiskey and cigarette smoke. She noticed that she lacked complete\r\nmuscular control; when she moved it was not a sinuous motion with the\r\nresultant strain distributed easily over her body--it was a tremendous\r\neffort of her nervous system as though each time she were hypnotizing\r\nherself into performing an impossible action....\r\n\r\nShe was in the bathroom, brushing her teeth to get rid of that\r\nintolerable taste; then back by the bedside listening to the rattle of\r\nBounds\'s key in the outer door.\r\n\r\n"Wake up, Anthony!" she said sharply.\r\n\r\nShe climbed into bed beside him and closed her eyes. Almost the last\r\nthing she remembered was a conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Lacy. Mrs.\r\nLacy had said, "Sure you don\'t want us to get you a taxi?" and Anthony\r\nhad replied that he guessed they could walk over to Fifth all right.\r\nThen they had both attempted, imprudently, to bow--and collapsed\r\nabsurdly into a battalion of empty milk bottles just outside the door.\r\nThere must have been two dozen milk bottles standing open-mouthed in the\r\ndark. She could conceive of no plausible explanation of those milk\r\nbottles. Perhaps they had been attracted by the singing in the Lacy\r\nhouse and had hurried over agape with wonder to see the fun. Well,\r\nthey\'d had the worst of it--though it seemed that she and Anthony never\r\nwould get up, the perverse things rolled so....\r\n\r\nStill, they had found a taxi. "My meter\'s broken and it\'ll cost you a\r\ndollar and a half to get home," said the taxi driver. "Well," said\r\nAnthony, "I\'m young Packy McFarland and if you\'ll come down here I\'ll\r\nbeat you till you can\'t stand up." ...At that point the man had driven\r\noff without them. They must have found another taxi, for they were in\r\nthe apartment....\r\n\r\n"What time is it?" Anthony was sitting up in bed, staring at her with\r\nowlish precision.\r\n\r\nThis was obviously a rhetorical question. Gloria could think of no\r\nreason why she should be expected to know the time.\r\n\r\n"Golly, I feel like the devil!" muttered Anthony dispassionately.\r\nRelaxing, he tumbled back upon his pillow. "Bring on your grim reaper!"\r\n\r\n"Anthony, how\'d we finally get home last night?"\r\n\r\n"Taxi."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Then, after a pause: "Did you put me to bed?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Seems to me you put _me_ to bed. What day is it?"\r\n\r\n"Tuesday."\r\n\r\n"Tuesday? I hope so. If it\'s Wednesday, I\'ve got to start work at that\r\nidiotic place. Supposed to be down at nine or some such ungodly hour."\r\n\r\n"Ask Bounds," suggested Gloria feebly.\r\n\r\n"Bounds!" he called.\r\n\r\nSprightly, sober--a voice from a world that it seemed in the past two\r\ndays they had left forever, Bounds sprang in short steps down the hall\r\nand appeared in the half darkness of the door.\r\n\r\n"What day, Bounds?"\r\n\r\n"February the twenty-second, I think, sir."\r\n\r\n"I mean day of the week."\r\n\r\n"Tuesday, sir." "Thanks." After a pause: "Are you ready for breakfast,\r\nsir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and Bounds, before you get it, will you make a pitcher of water,\r\nand set it here beside the bed? I\'m a little thirsty."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nBounds retreated in sober dignity down the hallway.\r\n\r\n"Lincoln\'s birthday," affirmed Anthony without enthusiasm, "or St.\r\nValentine\'s or somebody\'s. When did we start on this insane party?"\r\n\r\n"Sunday night."\r\n\r\n"After prayers?" he suggested sardonically.\r\n\r\n"We raced all over town in those hansoms and Maury sat up with his\r\ndriver, don\'t you remember? Then we came home and he tried to cook some\r\nbacon--came out of the pantry with a few blackened remains, insisting it\r\nwas \'fried to the proverbial crisp.\'"\r\n\r\nBoth of them laughed, spontaneously but with some difficulty, and lying\r\nthere side by side reviewed the chain of events that had ended in this\r\nrusty and chaotic dawn.\r\n\r\nThey had been in New York for almost four months, since the country had\r\ngrown too cool in late October. They had given up California this year,\r\npartly because of lack of funds, partly with the idea of going abroad\r\nshould this interminable war, persisting now into its second year, end\r\nduring the winter. Of late their income had lost elasticity; no longer\r\ndid it stretch to cover gay whims and pleasant extravagances, and\r\nAnthony had spent many puzzled and unsatisfactory hours over a densely\r\nfigured pad, making remarkable budgets that left huge margins for\r\n"amusements, trips, etc.," and trying to apportion, even approximately,\r\ntheir past expenditures.\r\n\r\nHe remembered a time when in going on a "party" with his two best\r\nfriends, he and Maury had invariably paid more than their share of the\r\nexpenses. They would buy the tickets for the theatre or squabble between\r\nthemselves for the dinner check. It had seemed fitting; Dick, with his\r\nnaivete and his astonishing fund of information about himself, had been\r\na diverting, almost juvenile, figure--court jester to their royalty. But\r\nthis was no longer true. It was Dick who always had money; it was\r\nAnthony who entertained within limitations--always excepting occasional\r\nwild, wine-inspired, check-cashing parties--and it was Anthony who was\r\nsolemn about it next morning and told the scornful and disgusted Gloria\r\nthat they\'d have to be "more careful next time."\r\n\r\nIn the two years since the publication of "The Demon Lover," Dick had\r\nmade over twenty-five thousand dollars, most of it lately, when the\r\nreward of the author of fiction had begun to swell unprecedentedly as a\r\nresult of the voracious hunger of the motion pictures for plots. He\r\nreceived seven hundred dollars for every story, at that time a large\r\nemolument for such a young man--he was not quite thirty--and for every\r\none that contained enough "action" (kissing, shooting, and sacrificing)\r\nfor the movies, he obtained an additional thousand. His stories varied;\r\nthere was a measure of vitality and a sort of instinctive in all of\r\nthem, but none attained the personality of "The Demon Lover," and there\r\nwere several that Anthony considered downright cheap. These, Dick\r\nexplained severely, were to widen his audience. Wasn\'t it true that men\r\nwho had attained real permanence from Shakespeare to Mark Twain had\r\nappealed to the many as well as to the elect?\r\n\r\nThough Anthony and Maury disagreed, Gloria told him to go ahead and make\r\nas much money as he could--that was the only thing that counted\r\nanyhow....\r\n\r\nMaury, a little stouter, faintly mellower, and more complaisant, had\r\ngone to work in Philadelphia. He came to New York once or twice a month\r\nand on such occasions the four of them travelled the popular routes from\r\ndinner to the theatre, thence to the Frolic or, perhaps, at the urging\r\nof the ever-curious Gloria, to one of the cellars of Greenwich Village,\r\nnotorious through the furious but short-lived vogue of the "new poetry\r\nmovement."\r\n\r\nIn January, after many monologues directed at his reticent wife, Anthony\r\ndetermined to "get something to do," for the winter at any rate. He\r\nwanted to please his grandfather and even, in a measure, to see how he\r\nliked it himself. He discovered during several tentative semi-social\r\ncalls that employers were not interested in a young man who was only\r\ngoing to "try it for a few months or so." As the grandson of Adam Patch\r\nhe was received everywhere with marked courtesy, but the old man was a\r\nback number now--the heyday of his fame as first an "oppressor" and then\r\nan uplifter of the people had been during the twenty years preceding his\r\nretirement. Anthony even found several of the younger men who were under\r\nthe impression that Adam Patch had been dead for some years.\r\n\r\nEventually Anthony went to his grandfather and asked his advice, which\r\nturned out to be that he should enter the bond business as a salesman, a\r\ntedious suggestion to Anthony, but one that in the end he determined to\r\nfollow. Sheer money in deft manipulation had fascinations under all\r\ncircumstances, while almost any side of manufacturing would be\r\ninsufferably dull. He considered newspaper work but decided that the\r\nhours were not ordered for a married man. And he lingered over pleasant\r\nfancies of himself either as editor of a brilliant weekly of opinion, an\r\nAmerican Mercure de France, or as scintillant producer of satiric comedy\r\nand Parisian musical revue. However, the approaches to these latter\r\nguilds seemed to be guarded by professional secrets. Men drifted into\r\nthem by the devious highways of writing and acting. It was palpably\r\nimpossible to get on a magazine unless you had been on one before.\r\n\r\nSo in the end he entered, by way of his grandfather\'s letter, that\r\nSanctum Americanum where sat the president of Wilson, Hiemer and Hardy\r\nat his "cleared desk," and issued therefrom employed. He was to begin\r\nwork on the twenty-third of February.\r\n\r\nIn tribute to the momentous occasion this two-day revel had been\r\nplanned, since, he said, after he began working he\'d have to get to bed\r\nearly during the week. Maury Noble had arrived from Philadelphia on a\r\ntrip that had to do with seeing some man in Wall Street (whom,\r\nincidentally, he failed to see), and Richard Caramel had been half\r\npersuaded, half tricked into joining them. They had condescended to a\r\nwet and fashionable wedding on Monday afternoon, and in the evening had\r\noccurred the denouement: Gloria, going beyond her accustomed limit of\r\nfour precisely timed cocktails, led them on as gay and joyous a\r\nbacchanal as they had ever known, disclosing an astonishing knowledge of\r\nballet steps, and singing songs which she confessed had been taught her\r\nby her cook when she was innocent and seventeen. She repeated these by\r\nrequest at intervals throughout the evening with such frank conviviality\r\nthat Anthony, far from being annoyed, was gratified at this fresh source\r\nof entertainment. The occasion was memorable in other ways--a long\r\nconversation between Maury and a defunct crab, which he was dragging\r\naround on the end of a string, as to whether the crab was fully\r\nconversant with the applications of the binomial theorem, and the\r\naforementioned race in two hansom cabs with the sedate and impressive\r\nshadows of Fifth Avenue for audience, ending in a labyrinthine escape\r\ninto the darkness of Central Park. Finally Anthony and Gloria had paid a\r\ncall on some wild young married people--the Lacys--and collapsed in the\r\nempty milk bottles.\r\n\r\nMorning now--theirs to add up the checks cashed here and there in clubs,\r\nstores, restaurants. Theirs to air the dank staleness of wine and\r\ncigarettes out of the tall blue front room, to pick up the broken glass\r\nand brush at the stained fabric of chairs and sofas; to give Bounds\r\nsuits and dresses for the cleaners; finally, to take their smothery\r\nhalf-feverish bodies and faded depressed spirits out into the chill air\r\nof February, that life might go on and Wilson, Hiemer and Hardy obtain\r\nthe services of a vigorous man at nine next morning.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember," called Anthony from the bathroom, "when Maury got out\r\nat the corner of One Hundred and Tenth Street and acted as a traffic\r\ncop, beckoning cars forward and motioning them back? They must have\r\nthought he was a private detective."\r\n\r\nAfter each reminiscence they both laughed inordinately, their\r\noverwrought nerves responding as acutely and janglingly to mirth as to\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\nGloria at the mirror was wondering at the splendid color and freshness\r\nof her face--it seemed that she had never looked so well, though her\r\nstomach hurt her and her head was aching furiously.\r\n\r\nThe day passed slowly. Anthony, riding in a taxi to his broker\'s to\r\nborrow money on a bond, found that he had only two dollars in his\r\npocket. The fare would cost all of that, but he felt that on this\r\nparticular afternoon he could not have endured the subway. When the\r\ntaximetre reached his limit he must get out and walk.\r\n\r\nWith this his mind drifted off into one of its characteristic\r\nday-dreams.... In this dream he discovered that the metre was going too\r\nfast--the driver had dishonestly adjusted it. Calmly he reached his\r\ndestination and then nonchalantly handed the man what he justly owed\r\nhim. The man showed fight, but almost before his hands were up Anthony\r\nhad knocked him down with one terrific blow. And when he rose Anthony\r\nquickly sidestepped and floored him definitely with a crack in\r\nthe temple.\r\n\r\n... He was in court now. The judge had fined him five dollars and he had\r\nno money. Would the court take his check? Ah, but the court did not know\r\nhim. Well, he could identify himself by having them call his apartment.\r\n\r\n... They did so. Yes, it was Mrs. Anthony Patch speaking--but how did\r\nshe know that this man was her husband? How could she know? Let the\r\npolice sergeant ask her if she remembered the milk bottles ...\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward hurriedly and tapped at the glass. The taxi was only\r\nat Brooklyn Bridge, but the metre showed a dollar and eighty cents, and\r\nAnthony would never have omitted the ten per cent tip.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon he returned to the apartment. Gloria had also\r\nbeen out--shopping--and was asleep, curled in a corner of the sofa with\r\nher purchase locked securely in her arms. Her face was as untroubled as\r\na little girl\'s, and the bundle that she pressed tightly to her bosom\r\nwas a child\'s doll, a profound and infinitely healing balm to her\r\ndisturbed and childish heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTINY\r\n\r\nIt was with this party, more especially with Gloria\'s part in it, that a\r\ndecided change began to come over their way of living. The magnificent\r\nattitude of not giving a damn altered overnight; from being a mere tenet\r\nof Gloria\'s it became the entire solace and justification for what they\r\nchose to do and what consequence it brought. Not to be sorry, not to\r\nloose one cry of regret, to live according to a clear code of honor\r\ntoward each other, and to seek the moment\'s happiness as fervently and\r\npersistently as possible.\r\n\r\n"No one cares about us but ourselves, Anthony," she said one day. "It\'d\r\nbe ridiculous for me to go about pretending I felt any obligations\r\ntoward the world, and as for worrying what people think about me, I\r\nsimply _don\'t_, that\'s all. Since I was a little girl in dancing-school\r\nI\'ve been criticised by the mothers of all the little girls who weren\'t\r\nas popular as I was, and I\'ve always looked on criticism as a sort of\r\nenvious tribute."\r\n\r\nThis was because of a party in the "Boul\' Mich\'" one night, where\r\nConstance Merriam had seen her as one of a highly stimulated party of\r\nfour. Constance Merriam, "as an old school friend," had gone to the\r\ntrouble of inviting her to lunch next day in order to inform her how\r\nterrible it was.\r\n\r\n"I told her I couldn\'t see it," Gloria told Anthony. "Eric Merriam is a\r\nsort of sublimated Percy Wolcott--you remember that man in Hot Springs I\r\ntold you about--his idea of respecting Constance is to leave her at home\r\nwith her sewing and her baby and her book, and such innocuous\r\namusements, whenever he\'s going on a party that promises to be anything\r\nbut deathly dull."\r\n\r\n"Did you tell her that?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly did. And I told her that what she really objected to was\r\nthat I was having a better time than she was."\r\n\r\nAnthony applauded her. He was tremendously proud of Gloria, proud that\r\nshe never failed to eclipse whatever other women might be in the party,\r\nproud that men were always glad to revel with her in great rowdy groups,\r\nwithout any attempt to do more than enjoy her beauty and the warmth of\r\nher vitality.\r\n\r\nThese "parties" gradually became their chief source of entertainment.\r\nStill in love, still enormously interested in each other, they yet found\r\nas spring drew near that staying at home in the evening palled on them;\r\nbooks were unreal; the old magic of being alone had long since\r\nvanished--instead they preferred to be bored by a stupid musical comedy,\r\nor to go to dinner with the most uninteresting of their acquaintances,\r\nso long as there would be enough cocktails to keep the conversation from\r\nbecoming utterly intolerable. A scattering of younger married people who\r\nhad been their friends in school or college, as well as a varied\r\nassortment of single men, began to think instinctively of them whenever\r\ncolor and excitement were needed, so there was scarcely a day without\r\nits phone call, its "Wondered what you were doing this evening." Wives,\r\nas a rule, were afraid of Gloria--her facile attainment of the centre of\r\nthe stage, her innocent but nevertheless disturbing way of becoming a\r\nfavorite with husbands--these things drove them instinctively into an\r\nattitude of profound distrust, heightened by the fact that Gloria was\r\nlargely unresponsive to any intimacy shown her by a woman.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed Wednesday in February Anthony had gone to the imposing\r\noffices of Wilson, Hiemer and Hardy and listened to many vague\r\ninstructions delivered by an energetic young man of about his own age,\r\nnamed Kahler, who wore a defiant yellow pompadour, and in announcing\r\nhimself as an assistant secretary gave the impression that it was a\r\ntribute to exceptional ability.\r\n\r\n"There\'s two kinds of men here, you\'ll find," he said. "There\'s the man\r\nwho gets to be an assistant secretary or treasurer, gets his name on our\r\nfolder here, before he\'s thirty, and there\'s the man who gets his name\r\nthere at forty-five. The man who gets his name there at forty-five stays\r\nthere the rest of his life."\r\n\r\n"How about the man who gets it there at thirty?" inquired Anthony\r\npolitely.\r\n\r\n"Why, he gets up here, you see." He pointed to a list of assistant\r\nvice-presidents upon the folder. "Or maybe he gets to be president or\r\nsecretary or treasurer."\r\n\r\n"And what about these over here?"\r\n\r\n"Those? Oh, those are the trustees--the men with capital."\r\n\r\n"I see."\r\n\r\n"Now some people," continued Kahler, "think that whether a man gets\r\nstarted early or late depends on whether he\'s got a college education.\r\nBut they\'re wrong."\r\n\r\n"I see."\r\n\r\n"I had one; I was Buckleigh, class of nineteen-eleven, but when I came\r\ndown to the Street I soon found that the things that would help me here\r\nweren\'t the fancy things I learned in college. In fact, I had to get a\r\nlot of fancy stuff out of my head."\r\n\r\nAnthony could not help wondering what possible "fancy stuff" he had\r\nlearned at Buckleigh in nineteen-eleven. An irrepressible idea that it\r\nwas some sort of needlework recurred to him throughout the rest of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"See that fellow over there?" Kahler pointed to a youngish-looking man\r\nwith handsome gray hair, sitting at a desk inside a mahogany railing.\r\n"That\'s Mr. Ellinger, the first vice-president. Been everywhere, seen\r\neverything; got a fine education."\r\n\r\nIn vain did Anthony try to open his mind to the romance of finance; he\r\ncould think of Mr. Ellinger only as one of the buyers of the handsome\r\nleather sets of Thackeray, Balzac, Hugo, and Gibbon that lined the walls\r\nof the big bookstores.\r\n\r\nThrough the damp and uninspiring month of March he was prepared for\r\nsalesmanship. Lacking enthusiasm he was capable of viewing the turmoil\r\nand bustle that surrounded him only as a fruitless circumambient\r\nstriving toward an incomprehensible goal, tangibly evidenced only by the\r\nrival mansions of Mr. Frick and Mr. Carnegie on Fifth Avenue. That these\r\nportentous vice-presidents and trustees should be actually the fathers\r\nof the "best men" he had known at Harvard seemed to him incongruous.\r\n\r\nHe ate in an employees\' lunch-room up-stairs with an uneasy suspicion\r\nthat he was being uplifted, wondering through that first week if the\r\ndozens of young clerks, some of them alert and immaculate, and just out\r\nof college, lived in flamboyant hope of crowding onto that narrow slip\r\nof cardboard before the catastrophic thirties. The conversation that\r\ninterwove with the pattern of the day\'s work was all much of a piece.\r\nOne discussed how Mr. Wilson had made his money, what method Mr. Hiemer\r\nhad employed, and the means resorted to by Mr. Hardy. One related\r\nage-old but eternally breathless anecdotes of the fortunes stumbled on\r\nprecipitously in the Street by a "butcher" or a "bartender," or "a darn\r\n_mess_enger boy, by golly!" and then one talked of the current gambles,\r\nand whether it was best to go out for a hundred thousand a year or be\r\ncontent with twenty. During the preceding year one of the assistant\r\nsecretaries had invested all his savings in Bethlehem Steel. The story\r\nof his spectacular magnificence, of his haughty resignation in January,\r\nand of the triumphal palace he was now building in California, was the\r\nfavorite office subject. The man\'s very name had acquired a magic\r\nsignificance, symbolizing as he did the aspirations of all good\r\nAmericans. Anecdotes were told about him--how one of the vice-presidents\r\nhad advised him to sell, by golly, but he had hung on, even bought on\r\nmargin, "and _now_ look where he is!"\r\n\r\nSuch, obviously, was the stuff of life--a dizzy triumph dazzling the\r\neyes of all of them, a gypsy siren to content them with meagre wage and\r\nwith the arithmetical improbability of their eventual success.\r\n\r\nTo Anthony the notion became appalling. He felt that to succeed here the\r\nidea of success must grasp and limit his mind. It seemed to him that the\r\nessential element in these men at the top was their faith that their\r\naffairs were the very core of life. All other things being equal,\r\nself-assurance and opportunism won out over technical knowledge; it was\r\nobvious that the more expert work went on near the bottom--so, with\r\nappropriate efficiency, the technical experts were kept there.\r\n\r\nHis determination to stay in at night during the week did not survive,\r\nand a good half of the time he came to work with a splitting, sickish\r\nheadache and the crowded horror of the morning subway ringing in his\r\nears like an echo of hell.\r\n\r\nThen, abruptly, he quit. He had remained in bed all one Monday, and late\r\nin the evening, overcome by one of those attacks of moody despair to\r\nwhich he periodically succumbed, he wrote and mailed a letter to Mr.\r\nWilson, confessing that he considered himself ill adapted to the work.\r\nGloria, coming in from the theatre with Richard Caramel, found him on\r\nthe lounge, silently staring at the high ceiling, more depressed and\r\ndiscouraged than he had been at any time since their marriage.\r\n\r\nShe wanted him to whine. If he had she would have reproached him\r\nbitterly, for she was not a little annoyed, but he only lay there so\r\nutterly miserable that she felt sorry for him, and kneeling down she\r\nstroked his head, saying how little it mattered, how little anything\r\nmattered so long as they loved each other. It was like their first year,\r\nand Anthony, reacting to her cool hand, to her voice that was soft as\r\nbreath itself upon his ear, became almost cheerful, and talked with her\r\nof his future plans. He even regretted, silently, before he went to bed\r\nthat he had so hastily mailed his resignation.\r\n\r\n"Even when everything seems rotten you can\'t trust that judgment,"\r\nGloria had said. "It\'s the sum of all your judgments that counts."\r\n\r\nIn mid-April came a letter from the real-estate agent in Marietta,\r\nencouraging them to take the gray house for another year at a slightly\r\nincreased rental, and enclosing a lease made out for their signatures.\r\nFor a week lease and letter lay carelessly neglected on Anthony\'s desk.\r\nThey had no intention of returning to Marietta. They were weary of the\r\nplace, and had been bored most of the preceding summer. Besides, their\r\ncar had deteriorated to a rattling mass of hypochondriacal metal, and a\r\nnew one was financially inadvisable.\r\n\r\nBut because of another wild revel, enduring through four days and\r\nparticipated in, at one time or another, by more than a dozen people,\r\nthey did sign the lease; to their utter horror they signed it and sent\r\nit, and immediately it seemed as though they heard the gray house,\r\ndrably malevolent at last, licking its white chops and waiting to\r\ndevour them.\r\n\r\n"Anthony, where\'s that lease?" she called in high alarm one Sunday\r\nmorning, sick and sober to reality. "Where did you leave it? It\r\nwas here!"\r\n\r\nThen she knew where it was. She remembered the house party they had\r\nplanned on the crest of their exuberance; she remembered a room full of\r\nmen to whose less exhilarated moments she and Anthony were of no\r\nimportance, and Anthony\'s boast of the transcendent merit and seclusion\r\nof the gray house, that it was so isolated that it didn\'t matter how\r\nmuch noise went on there. Then Dick, who had visited them, cried\r\nenthusiastically that it was the best little house imaginable, and that\r\nthey were idiotic not to take it for another summer. It had been easy to\r\nwork themselves up to a sense of how hot and deserted the city was\r\ngetting, of how cool and ambrosial were the charms of Marietta. Anthony\r\nhad picked up the lease and waved it wildly, found Gloria happily\r\nacquiescent, and with one last burst of garrulous decision during which\r\nall the men agreed with solemn handshakes that they would come out for\r\na visit ...\r\n\r\n"Anthony," she cried, "we\'ve signed and sent it!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"The lease!"\r\n\r\n"What the devil!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, _An_thony!" There was utter misery in her voice. For the summer,\r\nfor eternity, they had built themselves a prison. It seemed to strike at\r\nthe last roots of their stability. Anthony thought they might arrange it\r\nwith the real-estate agent. They could no longer afford the double rent,\r\nand going to Marietta meant giving up his apartment, his reproachless\r\napartment with the exquisite bath and the rooms for which he had bought\r\nhis furniture and hangings--it was the closest to a home that he had\r\never had--familiar with memories of four colorful years.\r\n\r\nBut it was not arranged with the real-estate agent, nor was it arranged\r\nat all. Dispiritedly, without even any talk of making the best of it,\r\nwithout even Gloria\'s all-sufficing "I don\'t care," they went back to\r\nthe house that they now knew heeded neither youth nor love--only those\r\naustere and incommunicable memories that they could never share.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SINISTER SUMMER\r\n\r\nThere was a horror in the house that summer. It came with them and\r\nsettled itself over the place like a sombre pall, pervasive through the\r\nlower rooms, gradually spreading and climbing up the narrow stairs until\r\nit oppressed their very sleep. Anthony and Gloria grew to hate being\r\nthere alone. Her bedroom, which had seemed so pink and young and\r\ndelicate, appropriate to her pastel-shaded lingerie tossed here and\r\nthere on chair and bed, seemed now to whisper with its rustling curtains:\r\n\r\n"Ah, my beautiful young lady, yours is not the first daintiness and\r\ndelicacy that has faded here under the summer suns ... generations of\r\nunloved women have adorned themselves by that glass for rustic lovers\r\nwho paid no heed.... Youth has come into this room in palest blue and\r\nleft it in the gray cerements of despair, and through long nights many\r\ngirls have lain awake where that bed stands pouring out waves of misery\r\ninto the darkness."\r\n\r\nGloria finally tumbled all her clothes and unguents ingloriously out of\r\nit, declaring that she had come to live with Anthony, and making the\r\nexcuse that one of her screens was rotten and admitted bugs. So her room\r\nwas abandoned to insensitive guests, and they dressed and slept in her\r\nhusband\'s chamber, which Gloria considered somehow "good," as though\r\nAnthony\'s presence there had acted as exterminator of any uneasy shadows\r\nof the past that might have hovered about its walls.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between "good" and "bad," ordered early and summarily\r\nout of both their lives, had been reinstated in another form. Gloria\r\ninsisted that any one invited to the gray house must be "good," which,\r\nin the case of a girl, meant that she must be either simple and\r\nreproachless or, if otherwise, must possess a certain solidity and\r\nstrength. Always intensely sceptical of her sex, her judgments were now\r\nconcerned with the question of whether women were or were not clean. By\r\nuncleanliness she meant a variety of things, a lack of pride, a\r\nslackness in fibre and, most of all, the unmistakable aura of\r\npromiscuity.\r\n\r\n"Women soil easily," she said, "far more easily than men. Unless a\r\ngirl\'s very young and brave it\'s almost impossible for her to go\r\ndown-hill without a certain hysterical animality, the cunning, dirty\r\nsort of animality. A man\'s different--and I suppose that\'s why one of\r\nthe commonest characters of romance is a man going gallantly to\r\nthe devil."\r\n\r\nShe was disposed to like many men, preferably those who gave her frank\r\nhomage and unfailing entertainment--but often with a flash of insight\r\nshe told Anthony that some one of his friends was merely using him, and\r\nconsequently had best be left alone. Anthony customarily demurred,\r\ninsisting that the accused was a "good one," but he found that his\r\njudgment was more fallible than hers, memorably when, as it happened on\r\nseveral occasions, he was left with a succession of restaurant checks\r\nfor which to render a solitary account.\r\n\r\nMore from their fear of solitude than from any desire to go through the\r\nfuss and bother of entertaining, they filled the house with guests every\r\nweek-end, and often on through the week. The week-end parties were much\r\nthe same. When the three or four men invited had arrived, drinking was\r\nmore or less in order, followed by a hilarious dinner and a ride to the\r\nCradle Beach Country Club, which they had joined because it was\r\ninexpensive, lively if not fashionable, and almost a necessity for just\r\nsuch occasions as these. Moreover, it was of no great moment what one\r\ndid there, and so long as the Patch party were reasonably inaudible, it\r\nmattered little whether or not the social dictators of Cradle Beach saw\r\nthe gay Gloria imbibing cocktails in the supper room at frequent\r\nintervals during the evening.\r\n\r\nSaturday ended, generally, in a glamourous confusion--it proving often\r\nnecessary to assist a muddled guest to bed. Sunday brought the New York\r\npapers and a quiet morning of recuperating on the porch--and Sunday\r\nafternoon meant good-by to the one or two guests who must return to the\r\ncity, and a great revival of drinking among the one or two who remained\r\nuntil next day, concluding in a convivial if not hilarious evening.\r\n\r\nThe faithful Tana, pedagogue by nature and man of all work by\r\nprofession, had returned with them. Among their more frequent guests a\r\ntradition had sprung up about him. Maury Noble remarked one afternoon\r\nthat his real name was Tannenbaum, and that he was a German agent kept\r\nin this country to disseminate Teutonic propaganda through Westchester\r\nCounty, and, after that, mysterious letters began to arrive from\r\nPhiladelphia addressed to the bewildered Oriental as "Lt. Emile\r\nTannenbaum," containing a few cryptic messages signed "General Staff,"\r\nand adorned with an atmospheric double column of facetious Japanese.\r\nAnthony always handed them to Tana without a smile; hours afterward the\r\nrecipient could be found puzzling over them in the kitchen and declaring\r\nearnestly that the perpendicular symbols were not Japanese, nor anything\r\nresembling Japanese.\r\n\r\nGloria had taken a strong dislike to the man ever since the day when,\r\nreturning unexpectedly from the village, she had discovered him\r\nreclining on Anthony\'s bed, puzzling out a newspaper. It was the\r\ninstinct of all servants to be fond of Anthony and to detest Gloria, and\r\nTana was no exception to the rule. But he was thoroughly afraid of her\r\nand made plain his aversion only in his moodier moments by subtly\r\naddressing Anthony with remarks intended for her ear:\r\n\r\n"What Miz Pats want dinner?" he would say, looking at his master. Or\r\nelse he would comment about the bitter selfishness of "\'Merican peoples"\r\nin such manner that there was no doubt who were the "peoples"\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nBut they dared not dismiss him. Such a step would have been abhorrent to\r\ntheir inertia. They endured Tana as they endured ill weather and\r\nsickness of the body and the estimable Will of God--as they endured all\r\nthings, even themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN DARKNESS\r\n\r\nOne sultry afternoon late in July Richard Caramel telephoned from New\r\nYork that he and Maury were coming out, bringing a friend with them.\r\nThey arrived about five, a little drunk, accompanied by a small, stocky\r\nman of thirty-five, whom they introduced as Mr. Joe Hull, one of the\r\nbest fellows that Anthony and Gloria had ever met.\r\n\r\nJoe Hull had a yellow beard continually fighting through his skin and a\r\nlow voice which varied between basso profundo and a husky whisper.\r\nAnthony, carrying Maury\'s suitcase up-stairs, followed into the room and\r\ncarefully closed the door.\r\n\r\n"Who is this fellow?" he demanded.\r\n\r\nMaury chuckled enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n"Who, Hull? Oh, _he\'s_ all right. He\'s a good one."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but who is he?"\r\n\r\n"Hull? He\'s just a good fellow. He\'s a prince." His laughter redoubled,\r\nculminating in a succession of pleasant catlike grins. Anthony hesitated\r\nbetween a smile and a frown.\r\n\r\n"He looks sort of funny to me. Weird-looking clothes"--he paused--"I\'ve\r\ngot a sneaking suspicion you two picked him up somewhere last night."\r\n\r\n"Ridiculous," declared Maury. "Why, I\'ve known him all my life."\r\nHowever, as he capped this statement with another series of chuckles,\r\nAnthony was impelled to remark: "The devil you have!"\r\n\r\nLater, just before dinner, while Maury and Dick were conversing\r\nuproariously, with Joe Hull listening in silence as he sipped his drink,\r\nGloria drew Anthony into the dining room:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like this man Hull," she said. "I wish he\'d use Tana\'s\r\nbathtub."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t very well ask him to."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t want him in ours."\r\n\r\n"He seems to be a simple soul."\r\n\r\n"He\'s got on white shoes that look like gloves. I can see his toes right\r\nthrough them. Uh! Who is he, anyway?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got me."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think they\'ve got their nerve to bring him out here. This isn\'t\r\na Sailor\'s Rescue Home!"\r\n\r\n"They were tight when they phoned. Maury said they\'ve been on a party\r\nsince yesterday afternoon."\r\n\r\nGloria shook her head angrily, and saying no more returned to the porch.\r\nAnthony saw that she was trying to forget her uncertainty and devote\r\nherself to enjoying the evening.\r\n\r\nIt had been a tropical day, and even into late twilight the heat-waves\r\nemanating from the dry road were quivering faintly like undulating panes\r\nof isinglass. The sky was cloudless, but far beyond the woods in the\r\ndirection of the Sound a faint and persistent rolling had commenced.\r\nWhen Tana announced dinner the men, at a word from Gloria, remained\r\ncoatless and went inside.\r\n\r\nMaury began a song, which they accomplished in harmony during the first\r\ncourse. It had two lines and was sung to a popular air called Daisy\r\nDear. The lines were:\r\n\r\n"The--pan-ic--has--come--over us, So _ha-a-as_--the moral de_cline_!"\r\n\r\nEach rendition was greeted with bursts of enthusiasm and prolonged\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n"Cheer up, Gloria!" suggested Maury. "You seem the least bit depressed."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not," she lied.\r\n\r\n"Here, Tannenbaum!" he called over his shoulder. "I\'ve filled you a\r\ndrink. Come on!"\r\n\r\nGloria tried to stay his arm.\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t, Maury!"\r\n\r\n"Why not? Maybe he\'ll play the flute for us after dinner. Here, Tana."\r\n\r\nTana, grinning, bore the glass away to the kitchen. In a few moments\r\nMaury gave him another.\r\n\r\n"Cheer up, Gloria!" he cried. "For Heaven\'s sakes everybody, cheer up\r\nGloria."\r\n\r\n"Dearest, have another drink," counselled Anthony.\r\n\r\n"Do, please!"\r\n\r\n"Cheer up, Gloria," said Joe Hull easily.\r\n\r\nGloria winced at this uncalled-for use of her first name, and glanced\r\naround to see if any one else had noticed it. The word coming so glibly\r\nfrom the lips of a man to whom she had taken an inordinate dislike\r\nrepelled her. A moment later she noticed that Joe Hull had given Tana\r\nanother drink, and her anger increased, heightened somewhat from the\r\neffects of the alcohol.\r\n\r\n"--and once," Maury was saying, "Peter Granby and I went into a Turkish\r\nbath in Boston, about two o\'clock at night. There was no one there but\r\nthe proprietor, and we jammed him into a closet and locked the door.\r\nThen a fella came in and wanted a Turkish bath. Thought we were the\r\nrubbers, by golly! Well, we just picked him up and tossed him into the\r\npool with all his clothes on. Then we dragged him out and laid him on a\r\nslab and slapped him until he was black and blue. \'Not so rough,\r\nfellows!\' he\'d say in a little squeaky voice, \'please! ...\'"\r\n\r\n--Was this Maury? thought Gloria. From any one else the story would have\r\namused her, but from Maury, the infinitely appreciative, the apotheosis\r\nof tact and consideration....\r\n\r\n"The--pan-ic--has--come--over us, So _ha-a-as_--"\r\n\r\nA drum of thunder from outside drowned out the rest of the song; Gloria\r\nshivered and tried to empty her glass, but the first taste nauseated\r\nher, and she set it down. Dinner was over and they all marched into the\r\nbig room, bearing several bottles and decanters. Some one had closed the\r\nporch door to keep out the wind, and in consequence circular tentacles\r\nof cigar smoke were twisting already upon the heavy air.\r\n\r\n"Paging Lieutenant Tannenbaum!" Again it was the changeling Maury.\r\n"Bring us the flute!"\r\n\r\nAnthony and Maury rushed into the kitchen; Richard Caramel started the\r\nphonograph and approached Gloria.\r\n\r\n"Dance with your well-known cousin."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to dance."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m going to carry you around."\r\n\r\nAs though he were doing something of overpowering importance, he picked\r\nher up in his fat little arms and started trotting gravely about\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"Set me down, Dick! I\'m dizzy!" she insisted.\r\n\r\nHe dumped her in a bouncing bundle on the couch, and rushed off to the\r\nkitchen, shouting "Tana! Tana!"\r\n\r\nThen, without warning, she felt other arms around her, felt herself\r\nlifted from the lounge. Joe Hull had picked her up and was trying,\r\ndrunkenly, to imitate Dick.\r\n\r\n"Put me down!" she said sharply.\r\n\r\nHis maudlin laugh, and the sight of that prickly yellow jaw close to her\r\nface stirred her to intolerable disgust.\r\n\r\n"At once!"\r\n\r\n"The--pan-ic--" he began, but got no further, for Gloria\'s hand swung\r\naround swiftly and caught him in the cheek. At this he all at once let\r\ngo of her, and she fell to the floor, her shoulder hitting the table a\r\nglancing blow in transit....\r\n\r\nThen the room seemed full of men and smoke. There was Tana in his white\r\ncoat reeling about supported by Maury. Into his flute he was blowing a\r\nweird blend of sound that was known, cried Anthony, as the Japanese\r\ntrain-song. Joe Hull had found a box of candles and was juggling them,\r\nyelling "One down!" every time he missed, and Dick was dancing by\r\nhimself in a fascinated whirl around and about the room. It appeared to\r\nher that everything in the room was staggering in grotesque\r\nfourth-dimensional gyrations through intersecting planes of hazy blue.\r\n\r\nOutside, the storm had come up amazingly--the lulls within were filled\r\nwith the scrape of the tall bushes against the house and the roaring of\r\nthe rain on the tin roof of the kitchen. The lightning was interminable,\r\nletting down thick drips of thunder like pig iron from the heart of a\r\nwhite-hot furnace. Gloria could see that the rain was spitting in at\r\nthree of the windows--but she could not move to shut them....\r\n\r\n... She was in the hall. She had said good night but no one had heard or\r\nheeded her. It seemed for an instant as though something had looked down\r\nover the head of the banister, but she could not have gone back into the\r\nliving room--better madness than the madness of that clamor....\r\nUp-stairs she fumbled for the electric switch and missed it in the\r\ndarkness; a roomful of lightning showed her the button plainly on the\r\nwall. But when the impenetrable black shut down, it again eluded her\r\nfumbling fingers, so she slipped off her dress and petticoat and threw\r\nherself weakly on the dry side of the half-drenched bed.\r\n\r\nShe shut her eyes. From down-stairs arose the babel of the drinkers,\r\npunctured suddenly by a tinkling shiver of broken glass, and then\r\nanother, and by a soaring fragment of unsteady, irregular song....\r\n\r\nShe lay there for something over two hours--so she calculated afterward,\r\nsheerly by piecing together the bits of time. She was conscious, even\r\naware, after a long while that the noise down-stairs had lessened, and\r\nthat the storm was moving off westward, throwing back lingering showers\r\nof sound that fell, heavy and lifeless as her soul, into the soggy\r\nfields. This was succeeded by a slow, reluctant scattering of the rain\r\nand wind, until there was nothing outside her windows but a gentle\r\ndripping and the swishing play of a cluster of wet vine against the\r\nsill. She was in a state half-way between sleeping and waking, with\r\nneither condition predominant ... and she was harassed by a desire to\r\nrid herself of a weight pressing down upon her breast. She felt that if\r\nshe could cry the weight would be lifted, and forcing the lids of her\r\neyes together she tried to raise a lump in her throat ... to\r\nno avail....\r\n\r\nDrip! Drip! Drip! The sound was not unpleasant--like spring, like a cool\r\nrain of her childhood, that made cheerful mud in her back yard and\r\nwatered the tiny garden she had dug with miniature rake and spade and\r\nhoe. Drip--dri-ip! It was like days when the rain came out of yellow\r\nskies that melted just before twilight and shot one radiant shaft of\r\nsunlight diagonally down the heavens into the damp green trees. So cool,\r\nso clear and clean--and her mother there at the centre of the world, at\r\nthe centre of the rain, safe and dry and strong. She wanted her mother\r\nnow, and her mother was dead, beyond sight and touch forever. And this\r\nweight was pressing on her, pressing on her--oh, it pressed on her so!\r\n\r\nShe became rigid. Some one had come to the door and was standing\r\nregarding her, very quiet except for a slight swaying motion. She could\r\nsee the outline of his figure distinct against some indistinguishable\r\nlight. There was no sound anywhere, only a great persuasive\r\nsilence--even the dripping had ceased ... only this figure, swaying,\r\nswaying in the doorway, an indiscernible and subtly menacing terror, a\r\npersonality filthy under its varnish, like smallpox spots under a layer\r\nof powder. Yet her tired heart, beating until it shook her breasts, made\r\nher sure that there was still life in her, desperately shaken,\r\nthreatened....\r\n\r\nThe minute or succession of minutes prolonged itself interminably, and a\r\nswimming blur began to form before her eyes, which tried with childish\r\npersistence to pierce the gloom in the direction of the door. In another\r\ninstant it seemed that some unimaginable force would shatter her out of\r\nexistence ... and then the figure in the doorway--it was Hull, she saw,\r\nHull--turned deliberately and, still slightly swaying, moved back and\r\noff, as if absorbed into that incomprehensible light that had given him\r\ndimension.\r\n\r\nBlood rushed back into her limbs, blood and life together. With a start\r\nof energy she sat upright, shifting her body until her feet touched the\r\nfloor over the side of the bed. She knew what she must do--now, now,\r\nbefore it was too late. She must go out into this cool damp, out, away,\r\nto feel the wet swish of the grass around her feet and the fresh\r\nmoisture on her forehead. Mechanically she struggled into her clothes,\r\ngroping in the dark of the closet for a hat. She must go from this house\r\nwhere the thing hovered that pressed upon her bosom, or else made itself\r\ninto stray, swaying figures in the gloom.\r\n\r\nIn a panic she fumbled clumsily at her coat, found the sleeve just as\r\nshe heard Anthony\'s footsteps on the lower stair. She dared not wait; he\r\nmight not let her go, and even Anthony was part of this weight, part of\r\nthis evil house and the sombre darkness that was growing up about it....\r\n\r\nThrough the hall then ... and down the back stairs, hearing Anthony\'s\r\nvoice in the bedroom she had just left--\r\n\r\n"Gloria! Gloria!"\r\n\r\nBut she had reached the kitchen now, passed out through the doorway into\r\nthe night. A hundred drops, startled by a flare of wind from a dripping\r\ntree, scattered on her and she pressed them gladly to her face with\r\nhot hands.\r\n\r\n"Gloria! Gloria!"\r\n\r\nThe voice was infinitely remote, muffed and made plaintive by the walls\r\nshe had just left. She rounded the house and started down the front path\r\ntoward the road, almost exultant as she turned into it, and followed the\r\ncarpet of short grass alongside, moving with caution in the\r\nintense darkness.\r\n\r\n"Gloria!"\r\n\r\nShe broke into a run, stumbled over the segment of a branch twisted off\r\nby the wind. The voice was outside the house now. Anthony, finding the\r\nbedroom deserted, had come onto the porch. But this thing was driving\r\nher forward; it was back there with Anthony, and she must go on in her\r\nflight under this dim and oppressive heaven, forcing herself through the\r\nsilence ahead as though it were a tangible barrier before her.\r\n\r\nShe had gone some distance along the barely discernible road, probably\r\nhalf a mile, passed a single deserted barn that loomed up, black and\r\nforeboding, the only building of any sort between the gray house and\r\nMarietta; then she turned the fork, where the road entered the wood and\r\nran between two high walls of leaves and branches that nearly touched\r\noverhead. She noticed suddenly a thin, longitudinal gleam of silver upon\r\nthe road before her, like a bright sword half embedded in the mud. As\r\nshe came closer she gave a little cry of satisfaction--it was a\r\nwagon-rut full of water, and glancing heavenward she saw a light rift of\r\nsky and knew that the moon was out.\r\n\r\n"Gloria!"\r\n\r\nShe started violently. Anthony was not two hundred feet behind her.\r\n\r\n"Gloria, wait for me!"\r\n\r\nShe shut her lips tightly to keep from screaming, and increased her\r\ngait. Before she had gone another hundred yards the woods disappeared,\r\nrolling back like a dark stocking from the leg of the road. Three\r\nminutes\' walk ahead of her, suspended in the now high and limitless air,\r\nshe saw a thin interlacing of attenuated gleams and glitters, centred in\r\na regular undulation on some one invisible point. Abruptly she knew\r\nwhere she would go. That was the great cascade of wires that rose high\r\nover the river, like the legs of a gigantic spider whose eye was the\r\nlittle green light in the switch-house, and ran with the railroad bridge\r\nin the direction of the station. The station! There would be the train\r\nto take her away.\r\n\r\n"Gloria, it\'s me! It\'s Anthony! Gloria, I won\'t try to stop you! For\r\nGod\'s sake, where are you?"\r\n\r\nShe made no answer but began to run, keeping on the high side of the\r\nroad and leaping the gleaming puddles--dimensionless pools of thin,\r\nunsubstantial gold. Turning sharply to the left, she followed a narrow\r\nwagon road, serving to avoid a dark body on the ground. She looked up as\r\nan owl hooted mournfully from a solitary tree. Just ahead of her she\r\ncould see the trestle that led to the railroad bridge and the steps\r\nmounting up to it. The station lay across the river.\r\n\r\nAnother sounds startled her, the melancholy siren of an approaching\r\ntrain, and almost simultaneously, a repeated call, thin now and\r\nfar away.\r\n\r\n"Gloria! Gloria!"\r\n\r\nAnthony must have followed the main road. She laughed with a sort of\r\nmalicious cunning at having eluded him; she could spare the time to wait\r\nuntil the train went by.\r\n\r\nThe siren soared again, closer at hand, and then, with no anticipatory\r\nroar and clamor, a dark and sinuous body curved into view against the\r\nshadows far down the high-banked track, and with no sound but the rush\r\nof the cleft wind and the clocklike tick of the rails, moved toward the\r\nbridge--it was an electric train. Above the engine two vivid blurs of\r\nblue light formed incessantly a radiant crackling bar between them,\r\nwhich, like a spluttering flame in a lamp beside a corpse, lit for an\r\ninstant the successive rows of trees and caused Gloria to draw back\r\ninstinctively to the far side of the road. The light was tepid, the\r\ntemperature of warm blood.... The clicking blended suddenly with itself\r\nin a rush of even sound, and then, elongating in sombre elasticity, the\r\nthing roared blindly by her and thundered onto the bridge, racing the\r\nlurid shaft of fire it cast into the solemn river alongside. Then it\r\ncontracted swiftly, sucking in its sound until it left only a\r\nreverberant echo, which died upon the farther bank.\r\n\r\nSilence crept down again over the wet country; the faint dripping\r\nresumed, and suddenly a great shower of drops tumbled upon Gloria\r\nstirring her out of the trance-like torpor which the passage of the\r\ntrain had wrought. She ran swiftly down a descending level to the bank\r\nand began climbing the iron stairway to the bridge, remembering that it\r\nwas something she had always wanted to do, and that she would have the\r\nadded excitement of traversing the yard-wide plank that ran beside the\r\ntracks over the river.\r\n\r\nThere! This was better. She was at the top now and could see the lands\r\nabout her as successive sweeps of open country, cold under the moon,\r\ncoarsely patched and seamed with thin rows and heavy clumps of trees. To\r\nher right, half a mile down the river, which trailed away behind the\r\nlight like the shiny, slimy path of a snail, winked the scattered lights\r\nof Marietta. Not two hundred yards away at the end of the bridge\r\nsquatted the station, marked by a sullen lantern. The oppression was\r\nlifted now--the tree-tops below her were rocking the young starlight to\r\na haunted doze. She stretched out her arms with a gesture of freedom.\r\nThis was what she had wanted, to stand alone where it was high and cool.\r\n\r\n"Gloria!"\r\n\r\nLike a startled child she scurried along the plank, hopping, skipping,\r\njumping, with an ecstatic sense of her own physical lightness. Let him\r\ncome now--she no longer feared that, only she must first reach the\r\nstation, because that was part of the game. She was happy. Her hat,\r\nsnatched off, was clutched tightly in her hand, and her short curled\r\nhair bobbed up and down about her ears. She had thought she would never\r\nfeel so young again, but this was her night, her world. Triumphantly she\r\nlaughed as she left the plank, and reaching the wooden platform flung\r\nherself down happily beside an iron roof-post.\r\n\r\n"Here I am!" she called, gay as the dawn in her elation. "Here I am,\r\nAnthony, dear--old, worried Anthony."\r\n\r\n"Gloria!" He reached the platform, ran toward her. "Are you all right?"\r\nComing up he knelt and took her in his arms.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What was the matter? Why did you leave?" he queried anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I had to--there was something"--she paused and a flicker of uneasiness\r\nlashed at her mind--"there was something sitting on me--here." She put\r\nher hand on her breast. "I had to go out and get away from it."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by \'something\'?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--that man Hull--"\r\n\r\n"Did he bother you?"\r\n\r\n"He came to my door, drunk. I think I\'d gotten sort of crazy by that\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Gloria, dearest--"\r\n\r\nWearily she laid her head upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go back," he suggested.\r\n\r\nShe shivered.\r\n\r\n"Uh! No, I couldn\'t. It\'d come and sit on me again." Her voice rose to a\r\ncry that hung plaintive on the darkness. "That thing--"\r\n\r\n"There--there," he soothed her, pulling her close to him. "We won\'t do\r\nanything you don\'t want to do. What do you want to do? Just sit here?"\r\n\r\n"I want--I want to go away."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"Oh--anywhere."\r\n\r\n"By golly, Gloria," he cried, "you\'re still tight!"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not. I haven\'t been, all evening. I went up-stairs about, oh, I\r\ndon\'t know, about half an hour after dinner ...Ouch!"\r\n\r\nHe had inadvertently touched her right shoulder.\r\n\r\n"It hurts me. I hurt it some way. I don\'t know--somebody picked me up\r\nand dropped me."\r\n\r\n"Gloria, come home. It\'s late and damp."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," she wailed. "Oh, Anthony, don\'t ask me to! I will to-morrow.\r\nYou go home and I\'ll wait here for a train. I\'ll go to a hotel--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go with you."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t want you with me. I want to be alone. I want to sleep--oh,\r\nI want to sleep. And then to-morrow, when you\'ve got all the smell of\r\nwhiskey and cigarettes out of the house, and everything straight, and\r\nHull is gone, then I\'ll come home. If I went now, that thing--oh--!" She\r\ncovered her eyes with her hand; Anthony saw the futility of trying to\r\npersuade her.\r\n\r\n"I was all sober when you left," he said. "Dick was asleep on the lounge\r\nand Maury and I were having a discussion. That fellow Hull had wandered\r\noff somewhere. Then I began to realize I hadn\'t seen you for several\r\nhours, so I went up-stairs--"\r\n\r\nHe broke off as a salutatory "Hello, there!" boomed suddenly out of the\r\ndarkness. Gloria sprang to her feet and he did likewise.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Maury\'s voice," she cried excitedly. "If it\'s Hull with him, keep\r\nthem away, keep them away!"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?" Anthony called.\r\n\r\n"Just Dick and Maury," returned two voices reassuringly.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Hull?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s in bed. Passed out."\r\n\r\nTheir figures appeared dimly on the platform.\r\n\r\n"What the devil are you and Gloria doing here?" inquired Richard Caramel\r\nwith sleepy bewilderment.\r\n\r\n"What are _you_ two doing here?"\r\n\r\nMaury laughed.\r\n\r\n"Damned if I know. We followed you, and had the deuce of a time doing\r\nit. I heard you out on the porch yelling for Gloria, so I woke up the\r\nCaramel here and got it through his head, with some difficulty, that if\r\nthere was a search-party we\'d better be on it. He slowed me up by\r\nsitting down in the road at intervals and asking me what it was all\r\nabout. We tracked you by the pleasant scent of Canadian Club."\r\n\r\nThere was a rattle of nervous laughter under the low train-shed.\r\n\r\n"How did you track us, really?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we followed along down the road and then we suddenly lost you.\r\nSeems you turned off at a wagontrail. After a while somebody hailed us\r\nand asked us if we were looking for a young girl. Well, we came up and\r\nfound it was a little shivering old man, sitting on a fallen tree like\r\nsomebody in a fairy tale. \'She turned down here,\' he said, \'and most\r\nsteppud on me, goin\' somewhere in an awful hustle, and then a fella in\r\nshort golfin\' pants come runnin\' along and went after her. He throwed me\r\nthis.\' The old fellow had a dollar bill he was waving around--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the poor old man!" ejaculated Gloria, moved.\r\n\r\n"I threw him another and we went on, though he asked us to stay and tell\r\nhim what it was all about."\r\n\r\n"Poor old man," repeated Gloria dismally.\r\n\r\nDick sat down sleepily on a box.\r\n\r\n"And now what?" he inquired in the tone of stoic resignation.\r\n\r\n"Gloria\'s upset," explained Anthony. "She and I are going to the city by\r\nthe next train."\r\n\r\nMaury in the darkness had pulled a time-table from his pocket.\r\n\r\n"Strike a match."\r\n\r\nA tiny flare leaped out of the opaque background illuminating the four\r\nfaces, grotesque and unfamiliar here in the open night.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see. Two, two-thirty--no, that\'s evening. By gad, you won\'t get a\r\ntrain till five-thirty."\r\n\r\nAnthony hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Well," he muttered uncertainly, "we\'ve decided to stay here and wait\r\nfor it. You two might as well go back and sleep."\r\n\r\n"You go, too, Anthony," urged Gloria; "I want you to have some sleep,\r\ndear. You\'ve been as pale as a ghost all day."\r\n\r\n"Why, you little idiot!"\r\n\r\nDick yawned.\r\n\r\n"Very well. You stay, we stay."\r\n\r\nHe walked out from under the shed and surveyed the heavens.\r\n\r\n"Rather a nice night, after all. Stars are out and everything.\r\nExceptionally tasty assortment of them."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see." Gloria moved after him and the other two followed her.\r\n"Let\'s sit out here," she suggested. "I like it much better."\r\n\r\nAnthony and Dick converted a long box into a backrest and found a board\r\ndry enough for Gloria to sit on. Anthony dropped down beside her and\r\nwith some effort Dick hoisted himself onto an apple-barrel near them.\r\n\r\n"Tana went to sleep in the porch hammock," he remarked. "We carried him\r\nin and left him next to the kitchen stove to dry. He was drenched to\r\nthe skin."\r\n\r\n"That awful little man!" sighed Gloria.\r\n\r\n"How do you do!" The voice, sonorous and funereal, had come from above,\r\nand they looked up startled to find that in some manner Maury had\r\nclimbed to the roof of the shed, where he sat dangling his feet over the\r\nedge, outlined as a shadowy and fantastic gargoyle against the now\r\nbrilliant sky.\r\n\r\n"It must be for such occasions as this," he began softly, his words\r\nhaving the effect of floating down from an immense height and settling\r\nsoftly upon his auditors, "that the righteous of the land decorate the\r\nrailroads with bill-boards asserting in red and yellow that \'Jesus\r\nChrist is God,\' placing them, appropriately enough, next to\r\nannouncements that \'Gunter\'s Whiskey is Good.\'"\r\n\r\nThere was gentle laughter and the three below kept their heads tilted\r\nupward.\r\n\r\n"I think I shall tell you the story of my education," continued Maury,\r\n"under these sardonic constellations."\r\n\r\n"Do! Please!"\r\n\r\n"Shall I, really?"\r\n\r\nThey waited expectantly while he directed a ruminative yawn toward the\r\nwhite smiling moon.\r\n\r\n"Well," he began, "as an infant I prayed. I stored up prayers against\r\nfuture wickedness. One year I stored up nineteen hundred \'Now I\r\nlay me\'s.\'"\r\n\r\n"Throw down a cigarette," murmured some one.\r\n\r\nA small package reached the platform simultaneously with the stentorian\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n"Silence! I am about to unburden myself of many memorable remarks\r\nreserved for the darkness of such earths and the brilliance of\r\nsuch skies."\r\n\r\nBelow, a lighted match was passed from cigarette to cigarette. The voice\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n"I was adept at fooling the deity. I prayed immediately after all crimes\r\nuntil eventually prayer and crime became indistinguishable to me. I\r\nbelieved that because a man cried out \'My God!\' when a safe fell on him,\r\nit proved that belief was rooted deep in the human breast. Then I went\r\nto school. For fourteen years half a hundred earnest men pointed to\r\nancient flint-locks and cried to me: \'There\'s the real thing. These new\r\nrifles are only shallow, superficial imitations.\' They damned the books\r\nI read and the things I thought by calling them immoral; later the\r\nfashion changed, and they damned things by calling them \'clever\'.\r\n\r\n"And so I turned, canny for my years, from the professors to the poets,\r\nlistening--to the lyric tenor of Swinburne and the tenor robusto of\r\nShelley, to Shakespeare with his first bass and his fine range, to\r\nTennyson with his second bass and his occasional falsetto, to Milton and\r\nMarlow, bassos profundo. I gave ear to Browning chatting, Byron\r\ndeclaiming, and Wordsworth droning. This, at least, did me no harm. I\r\nlearned a little of beauty--enough to know that it had nothing to do\r\nwith truth--and I found, moreover, that there was no great literary\r\ntradition; there was only the tradition of the eventful death of every\r\nliterary tradition....\r\n\r\n"Then I grew up, and the beauty of succulent illusions fell away from\r\nme. The fibre of my mind coarsened and my eyes grew miserably keen. Life\r\nrose around my island like a sea, and presently I was swimming.\r\n\r\n"The transition was subtle--the thing had lain in wait for me for some\r\ntime. It has its insidious, seemingly innocuous trap for every one. With\r\nme? No--I didn\'t try to seduce the janitor\'s wife--nor did I run through\r\nthe streets unclothed, proclaiming my virility. It is never quite\r\npassion that does the business--it is the dress that passion wears. I\r\nbecame bored--that was all. Boredom, which is another name and a\r\nfrequent disguise for vitality, became the unconscious motive of all my\r\nacts. Beauty was behind me, do you understand?--I was grown." He paused.\r\n"End of school and college period. Opening of Part Two."\r\n\r\nThree quietly active points of light showed the location of his\r\nlisteners. Gloria was now half sitting, half lying, in Anthony\'s lap.\r\nHis arm was around her so tightly that she could hear the beating of his\r\nheart. Richard Caramel, perched on the apple-barrel, from time to time\r\nstirred and gave off a faint grunt.\r\n\r\n"I grew up then, into this land of jazz, and fell immediately into a\r\nstate of almost audible confusion. Life stood over me like an immoral\r\nschoolmistress, editing my ordered thoughts. But, with a mistaken faith\r\nin intelligence, I plodded on. I read Smith, who laughed at charity and\r\ninsisted that the sneer was the highest form of self-expression--but\r\nSmith himself replaced charity as an obscurer of the light. I read\r\nJones, who neatly disposed of individualism--and behold! Jones was still\r\nin my way. I did not think--I was a battle-ground for the thoughts of\r\nmany men; rather was I one of those desirable but impotent countries\r\nover which the great powers surge back and forth.\r\n\r\n"I reached maturity under the impression that I was gathering the\r\nexperience to order my life for happiness. Indeed, I accomplished the\r\nnot unusual feat of solving each question in my mind long before it\r\npresented itself to me in life--and of being beaten and bewildered\r\njust the same.\r\n\r\n"But after a few tastes of this latter dish I had had enough. Here! I\r\nsaid, Experience is not worth the getting. It\'s not a thing that happens\r\npleasantly to a passive you--it\'s a wall that an active you runs up\r\nagainst. So I wrapped myself in what I thought was my invulnerable\r\nscepticism and decided that my education was complete. But it was too\r\nlate. Protect myself as I might by making no new ties with tragic and\r\npredestined humanity, I was lost with the rest. I had traded the fight\r\nagainst love for the fight against loneliness, the fight against life\r\nfor the fight against death."\r\n\r\nHe broke off to give emphasis to his last observation--after a moment he\r\nyawned and resumed.\r\n\r\n"I suppose that the beginning of the second phase of my education was a\r\nghastly dissatisfaction at being used in spite of myself for some\r\ninscrutable purpose of whose ultimate goal I was unaware--if, indeed,\r\nthere _was_ an ultimate goal. It was a difficult choice. The\r\nschoolmistress seemed to be saying, \'We\'re going to play football and\r\nnothing but football. If you don\'t want to play football you can\'t\r\nplay at all--\'\r\n\r\n"What was I to do--the playtime was so short!\r\n\r\n"You see, I felt that we were even denied what consolation there might\r\nhave been in being a figment of a corporate man rising from his knees.\r\nDo you think that I leaped at this pessimism, grasped it as a sweetly\r\nsmug superior thing, no more depressing really than, say, a gray autumn\r\nday before a fire?--I don\'t think I did that. I was a great deal too\r\nwarm for that, and too alive.\r\n\r\n"For it seemed to me that there was no ultimate goal for man. Man was\r\nbeginning a grotesque and bewildered fight with nature--nature, that by\r\nthe divine and magnificent accident had brought us to where we could fly\r\nin her face. She had invented ways to rid the race of the inferior and\r\nthus give the remainder strength to fill her higher--or, let us say, her\r\nmore amusing--though still unconscious and accidental intentions. And,\r\nactuated by the highest gifts of the enlightenment, we were seeking to\r\ncircumvent her. In this republic I saw the black beginning to mingle\r\nwith the white--in Europe there was taking place an economic catastrophe\r\nto save three or four diseased and wretchedly governed races from the\r\none mastery that might organize them for material prosperity.\r\n\r\n"We produce a Christ who can raise up the leper--and presently the breed\r\nof the leper is the salt of the earth. If any one can find any lesson in\r\nthat, let him stand forth."\r\n\r\n"There\'s only one lesson to be learned from life, anyway," interrupted\r\nGloria, not in contradiction but in a sort of melancholy agreement.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" demanded Maury sharply.\r\n\r\n"That there\'s no lesson to be learned from life."\r\n\r\nAfter a short silence Maury said:\r\n\r\n"Young Gloria, the beautiful and merciless lady, first looked at the\r\nworld with the fundamental sophistication I have struggled to attain,\r\nthat Anthony never will attain, that Dick will never fully understand."\r\n\r\nThere was a disgusted groan from the apple-barrel. Anthony, grown\r\naccustomed to the dark, could see plainly the flash of Richard Caramel\'s\r\nyellow eye and the look of resentment on his face as he cried:\r\n\r\n"You\'re crazy! By your own statement I should have attained some\r\nexperience by trying."\r\n\r\n"Trying what?" cried Maury fiercely. "Trying to pierce the darkness of\r\npolitical idealism with some wild, despairing urge toward truth? Sitting\r\nday after day supine in a rigid chair and infinitely removed from life\r\nstaring at the tip of a steeple through the trees, trying to separate,\r\ndefinitely and for all time, the knowable from the unknowable? Trying to\r\ntake a piece of actuality and give it glamour from your own soul to make\r\nfor that inexpressible quality it possessed in life and lost in transit\r\nto paper or canvas? Struggling in a laboratory through weary years for\r\none iota of relative truth in a mass of wheels or a test tube--"\r\n\r\n"Have you?"\r\n\r\nMaury paused, and in his answer, when it came, there was a measure of\r\nweariness, a bitter overnote that lingered for a moment in those three\r\nminds before it floated up and off like a bubble bound for the moon.\r\n\r\n"Not I," he said softly. "I was born tired--but with the quality of\r\nmother wit, the gift of women like Gloria--to that, for all my talking\r\nand listening, my waiting in vain for the eternal generality that seems\r\nto lie just beyond every argument and every speculation, to that I have\r\nadded not one jot."\r\n\r\nIn the distance a deep sound that had been audible for some moments\r\nidentified itself by a plaintive mooing like that of a gigantic cow and\r\nby the pearly spot of a headlight apparent half a mile away. It was a\r\nsteam-driven train this time, rumbling and groaning, and as it tumbled\r\nby with a monstrous complaint it sent a shower of sparks and cinders\r\nover the platform.\r\n\r\n"Not one jot!" Again Maury\'s voice dropped down to them as from a great\r\nheight. "What a feeble thing intelligence is, with its short steps, its\r\nwaverings, its pacings back and forth, its disastrous retreats!\r\nIntelligence is a mere instrument of circumstances. There are people who\r\nsay that intelligence must have built the universe--why, intelligence\r\nnever built a steam engine! Circumstances built a steam engine.\r\nIntelligence is little more than a short foot-rule by which we measure\r\nthe infinite achievements of Circumstances.\r\n\r\n"I could quote you the philosophy of the hour--but, for all we know,\r\nfifty years may see a complete reversal of this abnegation that\'s\r\nabsorbing the intellectuals to-day, the triumph of Christ over Anatole\r\nFrance--" He hesitated, and then added: "But all I know--the tremendous\r\nimportance of myself to me, and the necessity of acknowledging that\r\nimportance to myself--these things the wise and lovely Gloria was born\r\nknowing these things and the painful futility of trying to know\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n"Well, I started to tell you of my education, didn\'t I? But I learned\r\nnothing, you see, very little even about myself. And if I had I should\r\ndie with my lips shut and the guard on my fountain pen--as the wisest\r\nmen have done since--oh, since the failure of a certain matter--a\r\nstrange matter, by the way. It concerned some sceptics who thought they\r\nwere far-sighted, just as you and I. Let me tell you about them by way\r\nof an evening prayer before you all drop off to sleep.\r\n\r\n"Once upon a time all the men of mind and genius in the world became of\r\none belief--that is to say, of no belief. But it wearied them to think\r\nthat within a few years after their death many cults and systems and\r\nprognostications would be ascribed to them which they had never\r\nmeditated nor intended. So they said to one another:\r\n\r\n"\'Let\'s join together and make a great book that will last forever to\r\nmock the credulity of man. Let\'s persuade our more erotic poets to write\r\nabout the delights of the flesh, and induce some of our robust\r\njournalists to contribute stories of famous amours. We\'ll include all\r\nthe most preposterous old wives\' tales now current. We\'ll choose the\r\nkeenest satirist alive to compile a deity from all the deities\r\nworshipped by mankind, a deity who will be more magnificent than any of\r\nthem, and yet so weakly human that he\'ll become a byword for laughter\r\nthe world over--and we\'ll ascribe to him all sorts of jokes and vanities\r\nand rages, in which he\'ll be supposed to indulge for his own diversion,\r\nso that the people will read our book and ponder it, and there\'ll be no\r\nmore nonsense in the world.\r\n\r\n"\'Finally, let us take care that the book possesses all the virtues of\r\nstyle, so that it may last forever as a witness to our profound\r\nscepticism and our universal irony.\'\r\n\r\n"So the men did, and they died.\r\n\r\n"But the book lived always, so beautifully had it been written, and so\r\nastounding the quality of imagination with which these men of mind and\r\ngenius had endowed it. They had neglected to give it a name, but after\r\nthey were dead it became known as the Bible."\r\n\r\nWhen he concluded there was no comment. Some damp languor sleeping on\r\nthe air of night seemed to have bewitched them all.\r\n\r\n"As I said, I started on the story of my education. But my high-balls\r\nare dead and the night\'s almost over, and soon there\'ll be an awful\r\njabbering going on everywhere, in the trees and the houses, and the two\r\nlittle stores over there behind the station, and there\'ll be a great\r\nrunning up and down upon the earth for a few hours--Well," he concluded\r\nwith a laugh, "thank God we four can all pass to our eternal rest\r\nknowing we\'ve left the world a little better for having lived in it."\r\n\r\nA breeze sprang up, blowing with it faint wisps of life which flattened\r\nagainst the sky.\r\n\r\n"Your remarks grow rambling and inconclusive," said Anthony sleepily.\r\n"You expected one of those miracles of illumination by which you say\r\nyour most brilliant and pregnant things in exactly the setting that\r\nshould provoke the ideal symposium. Meanwhile Gloria has shown her\r\nfar-sighted detachment by falling asleep--I can tell that by the fact\r\nthat she has managed to concentrate her entire weight upon my\r\nbroken body."\r\n\r\n"Have I bored you?" inquired Maury, looking down with some concern.\r\n\r\n"No, you have disappointed us. You\'ve shot a lot of arrows but did you\r\nshoot any birds?"\r\n\r\n"I leave the birds to Dick," said Maury hurriedly. "I speak erratically,\r\nin disassociated fragments."\r\n\r\n"You can get no rise from me," muttered Dick. "My mind is full of any\r\nnumber of material things. I want a warm bath too much to worry about\r\nthe importance of my work or what proportion of us are pathetic figures."\r\n\r\nDawn made itself felt in a gathering whiteness eastward over the river\r\nand an intermittent cheeping in the near-by trees.\r\n\r\n"Quarter to five," sighed Dick; "almost another hour to wait. Look! Two\r\ngone." He was pointing to Anthony, whose lids had sagged over his eyes.\r\n"Sleep of the Patch family--"\r\n\r\nBut in another five minutes, despite the amplifying cheeps and chirrups,\r\nhis own head had fallen forward, nodded down twice, thrice....\r\n\r\nOnly Maury Noble remained awake, seated upon the station roof, his eyes\r\nwide open and fixed with fatigued intensity upon the distant nucleus of\r\nmorning. He was wondering at the unreality of ideas, at the fading\r\nradiance of existence, and at the little absorptions that were creeping\r\navidly into his life, like rats into a ruined house. He was sorry for no\r\none now--on Monday morning there would be his business, and later there\r\nwould be a girl of another class whose whole life he was; these were the\r\nthings nearest his heart. In the strangeness of the brightening day it\r\nseemed presumptuous that with this feeble, broken instrument of his mind\r\nhe had ever tried to think.\r\n\r\nThere was the sun, letting down great glowing masses of heat; there was\r\nlife, active and snarling, moving about them like a fly swarm--the dark\r\npants of smoke from the engine, a crisp "all aboard!" and a bell\r\nringing. Confusedly Maury saw eyes in the milk train staring curiously\r\nup at him, heard Gloria and Anthony in quick controversy as to whether\r\nhe should go to the city with her, then another clamor and she was gone\r\nand the three men, pale as ghosts, were standing alone upon the platform\r\nwhile a grimy coal-heaver went down the road on top of a motor truck,\r\ncarolling hoarsely at the summer morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROKEN LUTE\r\n\r\n_It is seven-thirty of an August evening. The windows in the living room\r\nof the gray house are wide open, patiently exchanging the tainted inner\r\natmosphere of liquor and smoke for the fresh drowsiness of the late hot\r\ndusk. There are dying flower scents upon the air, so thin, so fragile,\r\nas to hint already of a summer laid away in time. But August is still\r\nproclaimed relentlessly by a thousand crickets around the side-porch,\r\nand by one who has broken into the house and concealed himself\r\nconfidently behind a bookcase, from time to time shrieking of his\r\ncleverness and his indomitable will._\r\n\r\n_The room itself is in messy disorder. On the table is a dish of fruit,\r\nwhich is real but appears artificial. Around it are grouped an ominous\r\nassortment of decanters, glasses, and heaped ash-trays, the latter still\r\nraising wavy smoke-ladders into the stale air, the effect on the whole\r\nneeding but a skull to resemble that venerable chromo, once a fixture in\r\nevery "den," which presents the appendages to the life of pleasure with\r\ndelightful and awe-inspiring sentiment._\r\n\r\n_After a while the sprightly solo of the supercricket is interrupted\r\nrather than joined by a new sound--the melancholy wail of an erratically\r\nfingered flute. It is obvious that the musician is practising rather\r\nthan performing, for from time to time the gnarled strain breaks off\r\nand, after an interval of indistinct mutterings, recommences._\r\n\r\n_Just prior to the seventh false start a third sound contributes to the\r\nsubdued discord. It is a taxi outside. A minute\'s silence, then the taxi\r\nagain, its boisterous retreat almost obliterating the scrape of\r\nfootsteps on the cinder walk. The door-bell shrieks alarmingly through\r\nthe house._\r\n\r\n_From the kitchen enters a small, fatigued Japanese, hastily buttoning a\r\nservant\'s coat of white duck. He opens the front screen-door and admits\r\na handsome young man of thirty, clad in the sort of well-intentioned\r\nclothes peculiar to those who serve mankind. To his whole personality\r\nclings a well-intentioned air: his glance about the room is compounded\r\nof curiosity and a determined optimism; when he looks at Tana the entire\r\nburden of uplifting the godless Oriental is in his eyes. His name is_\r\nFREDERICK E. PARAMORE. _He was at Harvard with_ ANTHONY, _where because\r\nof the initials of their surnames they were constantly placed next to\r\neach other in classes. A fragmentary acquaintance developed--but since\r\nthat time they have never met._\r\n\r\n_Nevertheless,_ PARAMORE _enters the room with a certain air of arriving\r\nfor the evening._\r\n\r\n_Tana is answering a question._\r\n\r\nTANA: (_Grinning with ingratiation_) Gone to Inn for dinnah. Be back\r\nhalf-hour. Gone since ha\' past six.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Regarding the glasses on the table_) Have they company?\r\n\r\nTANA: Yes. Company. Mistah Caramel, Mistah and Missays Barnes, Miss\r\nKane, all stay here.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: I see. (_Kindly_) They\'ve been having a spree, I see.\r\n\r\nTANA: I no un\'stan\'.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: They\'ve been having a fling.\r\n\r\nTANA: Yes, they have drink. Oh, many, many, many drink.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Receding delicately from the subject_) "Didn\'t I hear the\r\nsounds of music as I approached the house"?\r\n\r\nTANA:(_With a spasmodic giggle_)Yes, I play.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: One of the Japanese instruments.\r\n\r\n(_He is quite obviously a subscriber to the "National Geographic\r\nMagazine_.")\r\n\r\nTANA: I play flu-u-ute, Japanese flu-u-ute.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: What song were you playing? One of your Japanese melodies?\r\n\r\nTANA:(_His brow undergoing preposterous contraction_) I play train song.\r\nHow you call?--railroad song. So call in my countree. Like train. It go\r\nso-o-o; that mean whistle; train start. Then go so-o-o; that mean train\r\ngo. Go like that. Vera nice song in my countree. Children song.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: It sounded very nice. (_It is apparent at this point that only\r\na gigantic effort at control restrains Tana from rushing up-stairs for\r\nhis post cards, including the six made in America_.)\r\n\r\nTANA: I fix high-ball for gentleman?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: "No, thanks. I don\'t use it". (_He smiles_.)\r\n\r\n(TANA _withdraws into the kitchen, leaving the intervening door slightly\r\najar. From the crevice there suddenly issues again the melody of the\r\nJapanese train song--this time not a practice, surely, but a\r\nperformance, a lusty, spirited performance._\r\n\r\n_The phone rings._ TANA, _absorbed in his harmonics, gives no heed, so_\r\nPARAMORE _takes up the receiver_.)\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: Hello.... Yes.... No, he\'s not here now, but he\'ll be back any\r\nmoment.... Butterworth? Hello, I didn\'t quite catch the name.... Hello,\r\nhello, hello. Hello! ... Huh!\r\n\r\n(_The phone obstinately refuses to yield up any more sound. Paramore\r\nreplaces the receiver._\r\n\r\n_At this point the taxi motif re-enters, wafting with it a second young\r\nman; he carries a suitcase and opens the front door without ringing\r\nthe bell._)\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_In the hall_) "Oh, Anthony! Yoho"! (_He comes into the large\r\nroom and sees_ PARAMORE) How do?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Gazing at him with gathering intensity_) Is this--is this\r\nMaury Noble?\r\n\r\nMAURY: "That\'s it". (_He advances, smiling, and holding out his hand_)\r\nHow are you, old boy? Haven\'t seen you for years.\r\n\r\n(_He has vaguely associated the face with Harvard, but is not even\r\npositive about that. The name, if he ever knew it, he has long since\r\nforgotten. However, with a fine sensitiveness and an equally commendable\r\ncharity_ PARAMORE _recognizes the fact and tactfully relieves the\r\nsituation_.)\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: You\'ve forgotten Fred Paramore? We were both in old Unc\r\nRobert\'s history class.\r\n\r\nMAURY: No, I haven\'t, Unc--I mean Fred. Fred was--I mean Unc was a great\r\nold fellow, wasn\'t he?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Nodding his head humorously several times_) Great old\r\ncharacter. Great old character.\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_After a short pause_) Yes--he was. Where\'s Anthony?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: The Japanese servant told me he was at some inn. Having\r\ndinner, I suppose.\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_Looking at his watch_) Gone long?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: I guess so. The Japanese told me they\'d be back shortly.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Suppose we have a drink.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: No, thanks. I don\'t use it. (_He smiles_.)\r\n\r\nMAURY: Mind if I do? (_Yawning as he helps himself from a bottle_) What\r\nhave you been doing since you left college?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: Oh, many things. I\'ve led a very active life. Knocked about\r\nhere and there. (_His tone implies anything front lion-stalking to\r\norganized crime._)\r\n\r\nMAURY: Oh, been over to Europe?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: No, I haven\'t--unfortunately.\r\n\r\nMAURY: I guess we\'ll all go over before long.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: Do you really think so?\r\n\r\nMAURY: Sure! Country\'s been fed on sensationalism for more than two\r\nyears. Everybody getting restless. Want to have some fun.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: Then you don\'t believe any ideals are at stake?\r\n\r\nMAURY: Nothing of much importance. People want excitement every so\r\noften.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Intently_) It\'s very interesting to hear you say that. Now I\r\nwas talking to a man who\'d been over there----\r\n\r\n(_During the ensuing testament, left to be filled in by the reader with\r\nsuch phrases as "Saw with his own eyes," "Splendid spirit of France,"\r\nand "Salvation of civilization,"_ MAURY _sits with lowered eyelids,\r\ndispassionately bored._)\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_At the first available opportunity_) By the way, do you happen\r\nto know that there\'s a German agent in this very house?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Smiling cautiously_) Are you serious?\r\n\r\nMAURY: Absolutely. Feel it my duty to warn you.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Convinced_) A governess?\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_In a whisper, indicating the kitchen with his thumb_) _Tana!_\r\nThat\'s not his real name. I understand he constantly gets mail addressed\r\nto Lieutenant Emile Tannenbaum.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Laughing with hearty tolerance_) You were kidding me.\r\n\r\nMAURY: I may be accusing him falsely. But, you haven\'t told me what\r\nyou\'ve been doing.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: For one thing--writing.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Fiction?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: No. Non-fiction.\r\n\r\nMAURY: What\'s that? A sort of literature that\'s half fiction and half\r\nfact?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: Oh, I\'ve confined myself to fact. I\'ve been doing a good deal\r\nof social-service work.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Oh!\r\n\r\n(_An immediate glow of suspicion leaps into his eyes. It is as though_\r\nPARAMORE _had announced himself as an amateur pickpocket._)\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: At present I\'m doing service work in Stamford. Only last week\r\nsome one told me that Anthony Patch lived so near.\r\n\r\n(_They are interrupted by a clamor outside, unmistakable as that of two\r\nsexes in conversation and laughter. Then there enter the room in a body_\r\nANTHONY, GLORIA, RICHARD CARAMEL, MURIEL KANE, RACHAEL BARNES _and_\r\nRODMAN BARNES, _her husband. They surge about_ MAURY, _illogically\r\nreplying_ "Fine!" _to his general_ "Hello." ... ANTHONY, _meanwhile,\r\napproaches his other guest._)\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Well, I\'ll be darned. How are you? Mighty glad to see you.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: It\'s good to see you, Anthony. I\'m stationed in Stamford, so I\r\nthought I\'d run over. (_Roguishly_) We have to work to beat the devil\r\nmost of the time, so we\'re entitled to a few hours\' vacation.\r\n\r\n(_In an agony of concentration_ ANTHONY _tries to recall the name. After\r\na struggle of parturition his memory gives up the fragment "Fred,"\r\naround which he hastily builds the sentence "Glad you did, Fred!"\r\nMeanwhile the slight hush prefatory to an introduction has fallen upon\r\nthe company._ MAURY, _who could help, prefers to look on in malicious\r\nenjoyment._)\r\n\r\nANTHONY: (_In desperation_) Ladies and gentlemen, this is--this is Fred.\r\n\r\nMURIEL: (_With obliging levity_) Hello, Fred!\r\n\r\n(RICHARD CARAMEL _and_ PARAMORE _greet each other intimately by their\r\nfirst names, the latter recollecting that_ DICK _was one of the men in\r\nhis class who had never before troubled to speak to him._ DICK\r\n_fatuously imagines that_ PARAMORE _is some one he has previously met\r\nin_ ANTHONY\'S _house._\r\n\r\n_The three young women go up-stairs._)\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_In an undertone to_ DICK) Haven\'t seen Muriel since Anthony\'s\r\nwedding.\r\n\r\nDICK: She\'s now in her prime. Her latest is "I\'ll say so!"\r\n\r\n(ANTHONY _struggles for a while with_ PARAMORE _and at length attempts\r\nto make the conversation general by asking every one to have a drink._)\r\n\r\nMAURY: I\'ve done pretty well on this bottle. I\'ve gone from "Proof" down\r\nto "Distillery." (_He indicates the words on the label._)\r\n\r\nANTHONY: (_To_ PARAMORE) Never can tell when these two will turn up.\r\nSaid good-by to them one afternoon at five and darned if they didn\'t\r\nappear about two in the morning. A big hired touring-car from New York\r\ndrove up to the door and out they stepped, drunk as lords, of course.\r\n\r\n(_In an ecstasy of consideration_ PARAMORE _regards the cover of a book\r\nwhich he holds in his hand._ MAURY _and_ DICK _exchange a glance._)\r\n\r\nDICK: (_Innocently, to_ PARAMORE) You work here in town?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: No, I\'m in the Laird Street Settlement in Stamford. (_To_\r\nANTHONY) You have no idea of the amount of poverty in these small\r\nConnecticut towns. Italians and other immigrants. Catholics mostly, you\r\nknow, so it\'s very hard to reach them.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: (_Politely_) Lot of crime?\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: Not so much crime as ignorance and dirt.\r\n\r\nMAURY: That\'s my theory: immediate electrocution of all ignorant and\r\ndirty people. I\'m all for the criminals--give color to life. Trouble is\r\nif you started to punish ignorance you\'d have to begin in the first\r\nfamilies, then you could take up the moving picture people, and finally\r\nCongress and the clergy.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Smiling uneasily_) I was speaking of the more fundamental\r\nignorance--of even our language.\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_Thoughtfully_) I suppose it is rather hard. Can\'t even keep up\r\nwith the new poetry.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: It\'s only when the settlement work has gone on for months that\r\none realizes how bad things are. As our secretary said to me, your\r\nfinger-nails never seem dirty until you wash your hands. Of course we\'re\r\nalready attracting much attention.\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_Rudely_) As your secretary might say, if you stuff paper into a\r\ngrate it\'ll burn brightly for a moment.\r\n\r\n(_At this point_ GLORIA, _freshly tinted and lustful of admiration and\r\nentertainment, rejoins the party, followed by her two friends. For\r\nseveral moments the conversation becomes entirely fragmentary._ GLORIA\r\n_calls_ ANTHONY _aside._)\r\n\r\nGLORIA: Please don\'t drink much, Anthony.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Why?\r\n\r\nGLORIA: Because you\'re so simple when you\'re drunk.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Good Lord! What\'s the matter now?\r\n\r\nGLORIA: (_After a pause during which her eyes gaze coolly into his_)\r\nSeveral things. In the first place, why do you insist on paying for\r\neverything? Both those men have more money than you!\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Why, Gloria! They\'re my guests!\r\n\r\nGLORIA: That\'s no reason why you should pay for a bottle of champagne\r\nRachael Barnes smashed. Dick tried to fix that second taxi bill, and you\r\nwouldn\'t let him.\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Why, Gloria--\r\n\r\nGLORIA: When we have to keep selling bonds to even pay our bills, it\'s\r\ntime to cut down on excess generosities. Moreover, I wouldn\'t be quite\r\nso attentive to Rachael Barnes. Her husband doesn\'t like it any more\r\nthan I do!\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Why, Gloria--\r\n\r\nGLORIA: (_Mimicking him sharply_) "Why, Gloria!" But that\'s happened a\r\nlittle too often this summer--with every pretty woman you meet. It\'s\r\ngrown to be a sort of habit, and I\'m _not_ going to stand it! If you can\r\nplay around, I can, too. (_Then, as an afterthought_) By the way, this\r\nFred person isn\'t a second Joe Hull, is he?\r\n\r\nANTHONY: Heavens, no! He probably came up to get me to wheedle some\r\nmoney out of grandfather for his flock.\r\n\r\n(GLORIA _turns away from a very depressed_ ANTHONY _and returns to her\r\nguests._\r\n\r\n_By nine o\'clock these can be divided into two classes--those who have\r\nbeen drinking consistently and those who have taken little or nothing.\r\nIn the second group are the_ BARNESES, MURIEL, _and_ FREDERICK E.\r\nPARAMORE.)\r\n\r\nMURIEL: I wish I could write. I get these ideas but I never seem to be\r\nable to put them in words.\r\n\r\nDICK: As Goliath said, he understood how David felt, but he couldn\'t\r\nexpress himself. The remark was immediately adopted for a motto by the\r\nPhilistines.\r\n\r\nMURIEL: I don\'t get you. I must be getting stupid in my old age.\r\n\r\nGLORIA: (_Weaving unsteadily among the company like an exhilarated\r\nangel_) If any one\'s hungry there\'s some French pastry on the dining\r\nroom table.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Can\'t tolerate those Victorian designs it comes in.\r\n\r\nMURIEL: (_Violently amused_) _I\'ll_ say you\'re tight, Maury.\r\n\r\n(_Her bosom is still a pavement that she offers to the hoofs of many\r\npassing stallions, hoping that their iron shoes may strike even a spark\r\nof romance in the darkness ..._\r\n\r\n_Messrs._ BARNES _and_ PARAMORE _have been engaged in conversation upon\r\nsome wholesome subject, a subject so wholesome that_ MR.

I believe one religion\'s as good as another and\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: There\'s some good in all religions.\r\n\r\nMURIEL: I\'m a Catholic but, as I always say, I\'m not working at it.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_With a tremendous burst of tolerance_) The Catholic religion\r\nis a very--a very powerful religion.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Well, such a broad-minded man should consider the raised plane of\r\nsensation and the stimulated optimism contained in this cocktail.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: (_Taking the drink, rather defiantly_) Thanks, I\'ll try--one.\r\n\r\nMAURY: One? Outrageous! Here we have a class of \'nineteen ten reunion,\r\nand you refuse to be even a little pickled. Come on!\r\n\r\n"_Here\'s a health to King Charles, Here\'s a health to King Charles,\r\nBring the bowl that you boast_----"\r\n\r\n(PARAMORE _joins in with a hearty voice_.)\r\n\r\nMAURY: Fill the cup, Frederick. You know everything\'s subordinated to\r\nnature\'s purposes with us, and her purpose with you is to make you a\r\nrip-roaring tippler.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: If a fellow can drink like a gentleman--\r\n\r\nMAURY: What is a gentleman, anyway?\r\n\r\nANTHONY: A man who never has pins under his coat lapel.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Nonsense! A man\'s social rank is determined by the amount of\r\nbread he eats in a sandwich.\r\n\r\nDICK: He\'s a man who prefers the first edition of a book to the last\r\nedition of a newspaper.\r\n\r\nRACHAEL: A man who never gives an impersonation of a dope-fiend.\r\n\r\nMAURY: An American who can fool an English butler into thinking he\'s\r\none.\r\n\r\nMURIEL: A man who comes from a good family and went to Yale or Harvard\r\nor Princeton, and has money and dances well, and all that.\r\n\r\nMAURY: At last--the perfect definition! Cardinal Newman\'s is now a back\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: I think we ought to look on the question more broad-mindedly.\r\nWas it Abraham Lincoln who said that a gentleman is one who never\r\ninflicts pain?\r\n\r\nMAURY: It\'s attributed, I believe, to General Ludendorff.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: Surely you\'re joking.\r\n\r\nMAURY: Have another drink.\r\n\r\nPARAMORE: I oughtn\'t to. (_Lowering his voice for_ MAURY\'S _ear alone_)\r\nWhat if I were to tell you this is the third drink I\'ve ever taken in\r\nmy life?\r\n\r\n(DICK _starts the phonograph, which provokes_ MURIEL _to rise and sway\r\nfrom side to side, her elbows against her ribs, her forearms\r\nperpendicular to her body and out like fins._)\r\n\r\nMURIEL: Oh, let\'s take up the rugs and dance!\r\n\r\n(_This suggestion is received by_ ANTHONY _and_ GLORIA _with interior\r\ngroans and sickly smiles of acquiescence._)\r\n\r\nMURIEL: Come on, you lazy-bones.

Of course not.\r\n\r\n(RACHAEL _smiles at him inscrutably. Two years have given her a sort of\r\nhard, well-groomed beauty._)\r\n\r\nMAURY: (_Holding up his glass_) Here\'s to the defeat of democracy and\r\nthe fall of Christianity.\r\n\r\nMURIEL: Now really!\r\n\r\n(_She flashes a mock-reproachful glance at_ MAURY _and then drinks._\r\n\r\n_They all drink, with varying degrees of difficulty._)\r\n\r\nMURIEL: Clear the floor!\r\n\r\n(_It seems inevitable that this process is to be gone through, so_\r\nANTHONY _and_ GLORIA _join in the great moving of tables, piling of\r\nchairs, rolling of carpets, and breaking of lamps.

He speaks--five mild and simple words._)\r\n\r\nADAM PATCH: We\'ll go back now, Shuttleworth--(_And that is all. He\r\nturns, and assisted by his cane goes out through the hall, through the\r\nfront door, and with hellish portentousness his uncertain footsteps\r\ncrunch on the gravel path under the August moon._)\r\n\r\n\r\nRETROSPECT\r\n\r\nIn this extremity they were like two goldfish in a bowl from which all\r\nthe water had been drawn; they could not even swim across to each other.\r\n\r\nGloria would be twenty-six in May. There was nothing, she had said, that\r\nshe wanted, except to be young and beautiful for a long time, to be gay\r\nand happy, and to have money and love. She wanted what most women want,\r\nbut she wanted it much more fiercely and passionately. She had been\r\nmarried over two years. At first there had been days of serene\r\nunderstanding, rising to ecstasies of proprietorship and pride.\r\nAlternating with these periods had occurred sporadic hates, enduring a\r\nshort hour, and forgetfulnesses lasting no longer than an afternoon.\r\nThat had been for half a year.\r\n\r\nThen the serenity, the content, had become less jubilant, had become,\r\ngray--very rarely, with the spur of jealousy or forced separation, the\r\nancient ecstasies returned, the apparent communion of soul and soul, the\r\nemotional excitement. It was possible for her to hate Anthony for as\r\nmuch as a full day, to be carelessly incensed at him for as long as a\r\nweek. Recrimination had displaced affection as an indulgence, almost as\r\nan entertainment, and there were nights when they would go to sleep\r\ntrying to remember who was angry and who should be reserved next\r\nmorning. And as the second year waned there had entered two new\r\nelements. Gloria realized that Anthony had become capable of utter\r\nindifference toward her, a temporary indifference, more than half\r\nlethargic, but one from which she could no longer stir him by a\r\nwhispered word, or a certain intimate smile. There were days when her\r\ncaresses affected him as a sort of suffocation. She was conscious of\r\nthese things; she never entirely admitted them to herself.\r\n\r\nIt was only recently that she perceived that in spite of her adoration\r\nof him, her jealousy, her servitude, her pride, she fundamentally\r\ndespised him--and her contempt blended indistinguishably with her other\r\nemotions.... All this was her love--the vital and feminine illusion that\r\nhad directed itself toward him one April night, many months before.\r\n\r\nOn Anthony\'s part she was, in spite of these qualifications, his sole\r\npreoccupation. Had he lost her he would have been a broken man,\r\nwretchedly and sentimentally absorbed in her memory for the remainder of\r\nlife. He seldom took pleasure in an entire day spent alone with\r\nher--except on occasions he preferred to have a third person with them.\r\nThere were times when he felt that if he were not left absolutely alone\r\nhe would go mad--there were a few times when he definitely hated her. In\r\nhis cups he was capable of short attractions toward other women, the\r\nhitherto-suppressed outcroppings of an experimental temperament.\r\n\r\nThat spring, that summer, they had speculated upon future happiness--how\r\nthey were to travel from summer land to summer land, returning\r\neventually to a gorgeous estate and possible idyllic children, then\r\nentering diplomacy or politics, to accomplish, for a while, beautiful\r\nand important things, until finally as a white-haired (beautifully,\r\nsilkily, white-haired) couple they were to loll about in serene glory,\r\nworshipped by the bourgeoisie of the land.... These times were to begin\r\n"when we get our money"; it was on such dreams rather than on any\r\nsatisfaction with their increasingly irregular, increasingly dissipated\r\nlife that their hope rested. On gray mornings when the jests of the\r\nnight before had shrunk to ribaldries without wit or dignity, they\r\ncould, after a fashion, bring out this batch of common hopes and count\r\nthem over, then smile at each other and repeat, by way of clinching the\r\nmatter, the terse yet sincere Nietzscheanism of Gloria\'s defiant "I\r\ndon\'t care!"\r\n\r\nThings had been slipping perceptibly. There was the money question,\r\nincreasingly annoying, increasingly ominous; there was the realization\r\nthat liquor had become a practical necessity to their amusement--not an\r\nuncommon phenomenon in the British aristocracy of a hundred years ago,\r\nbut a somewhat alarming one in a civilization steadily becoming more\r\ntemperate and more circumspect. Moreover, both of them seemed vaguely\r\nweaker in fibre, not so much in what they did as in their subtle\r\nreactions to the civilization about them. In Gloria had been born\r\nsomething that she had hitherto never needed--the skeleton, incomplete\r\nbut nevertheless unmistakable, of her ancient abhorrence, a conscience.\r\nThis admission to herself was coincidental with the slow decline of her\r\nphysical courage.\r\n\r\nThen, on the August morning after Adam Patch\'s unexpected call, they\r\nawoke, nauseated and tired, dispirited with life, capable only of one\r\npervasive emotion--fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nPANIC\r\n\r\n"Well?" Anthony sat up in bed and looked down at her. The corners of his\r\nlips were drooping with depression, his voice was strained and hollow.\r\n\r\nHer reply was to raise her hand to her mouth and begin a slow, precise\r\nnibbling at her finger.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve done it," he said after a pause; then, as she was still silent,\r\nhe became exasperated. "Why don\'t you say something?"\r\n\r\n"What on earth do you want me to say?"\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\n"Then stop biting your finger!"\r\n\r\nEnsued a short confused discussion of whether or not she had been\r\nthinking. It seemed essential to Anthony that she should muse aloud upon\r\nlast night\'s disaster. Her silence was a method of settling the\r\nresponsibility on him. For her part she saw no necessity for speech--the\r\nmoment required that she should gnaw at her finger like a nervous child.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to fix up this damn mess with my grandfather," he said with\r\nuneasy conviction. A faint newborn respect was indicated by his use of\r\n"my grandfather" instead of "grampa."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t," she affirmed abruptly. "You can\'t--_ever_. He\'ll never\r\nforgive you as long as he lives."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," agreed Anthony miserably. "Still--I might possibly square\r\nmyself by some sort of reformation and all that sort of thing--"\r\n\r\n"He looked sick," she interrupted, "pale as flour."\r\n\r\n"He _is_ sick. I told you that three months ago."\r\n\r\n"I wish he\'d died last week!" she said petulantly. "Inconsiderate old\r\nfool!"\r\n\r\nNeither of them laughed.\r\n\r\n"But just let me say," she added quietly, "the next time I see you\r\nacting with any woman like you did with Rachael Barnes last night, I\'ll\r\nleave you--_just--like--that!_ I\'m simply _not_ going to stand it!"\r\n\r\nAnthony quailed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be absurd," he protested. "You know there\'s no woman in the\r\nworld for me except you--none, dearest."\r\n\r\nHis attempt at a tender note failed miserably--the more imminent danger\r\nstalked back into the foreground.\r\n\r\n"If I went to him," suggested Anthony, "and said with appropriate\r\nbiblical quotations that I\'d walked too long in the way of\r\nunrighteousness and at last seen the light--" He broke off and glanced\r\nwith a whimsical expression at his wife. "I wonder what he\'d do?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nShe was speculating as to whether or not their guests would have the\r\nacumen to leave directly after breakfast.\r\n\r\nNot for a week did Anthony muster the courage to go to Tarrytown. The\r\nprospect was revolting and left alone he would have been incapable of\r\nmaking the trip--but if his will had deteriorated in these past three\r\nyears, so had his power to resist urging. Gloria compelled him to go. It\r\nwas all very well to wait a week, she said, for that would give his\r\ngrandfather\'s violent animosity time to cool--but to wait longer would\r\nbe an error--it would give it a chance to harden.\r\n\r\nHe went, in trepidation ... and vainly. Adam Patch was not well, said\r\nShuttleworth indignantly. Positive instructions had been given that no\r\none was to see him. Before the ex-"gin-physician\'s" vindictive eye\r\nAnthony\'s front wilted. He walked out to his taxicab with what was\r\nalmost a slink--recovering only a little of his self-respect as he\r\nboarded the train; glad to escape, boylike, to the wonder palaces of\r\nconsolation that still rose and glittered in his own mind.\r\n\r\nGloria was scornful when he returned to Marietta. Why had he not forced\r\nhis way in? That was what she would have done!\r\n\r\nBetween them they drafted a letter to the old man, and after\r\nconsiderable revision sent it off. It was half an apology, half a\r\nmanufactured explanation. The letter was not answered.\r\n\r\nCame a day in September, a day slashed with alternate sun and rain, sun\r\nwithout warmth, rain without freshness. On that day they left the gray\r\nhouse, which had seen the flower of their love. Four trunks and three\r\nmonstrous crates were piled in the dismantled room where, two years\r\nbefore, they had sprawled lazily, thinking in terms of dreams, remote,\r\nlanguorous, content. The room echoed with emptiness. Gloria, in a new\r\nbrown dress edged with fur, sat upon a trunk in silence, and Anthony\r\nwalked nervously to and fro smoking, as they waited for the truck that\r\nwould take their things to the city.\r\n\r\n"What are those?" she demanded, pointing to some books piled upon one of\r\nthe crates.\r\n\r\n"That\'s my old stamp collection," he confessed sheepishly. "I forgot to\r\npack it."\r\n\r\n"Anthony, it\'s so silly to carry it around."\r\n\r\n"Well, I was looking through it the day we left the apartment last\r\nspring, and I decided not to store it."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you sell it? Haven\'t we enough junk?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," he said humbly.\r\n\r\nWith a thunderous rattling the truck rolled up to the door. Gloria shook\r\nher fist defiantly at the four walls.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad to go!" she cried, "so glad. Oh, my God, how I hate this\r\nhouse!"\r\n\r\nSo the brilliant and beautiful lady went up with her husband to New\r\nYork. On the very train that bore them away they quarrelled--her bitter\r\nwords had the frequency, the regularity, the inevitability of the\r\nstations they passed.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be cross," begged Anthony piteously. "We\'ve got nothing but each\r\nother, after all."\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t even that, most of the time," cried Gloria.\r\n\r\n"When haven\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"A lot of times--beginning with one occasion on the station platform at\r\nRedgate."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that--"\r\n\r\n"No," she interrupted coolly, "I don\'t brood over it. It came and\r\nwent--and when it went it took something with it."\r\n\r\nShe finished abruptly. Anthony sat in silence, confused, depressed. The\r\ndrab visions of train-side Mamaroneck, Larchmont, Rye, Pelham Manor,\r\nsucceeded each other with intervals of bleak and shoddy wastes posing\r\nineffectually as country. He found himself remembering how on one summer\r\nmorning they two had started from New York in search of happiness. They\r\nhad never expected to find it, perhaps, yet in itself that quest had\r\nbeen happier than anything he expected forevermore. Life, it seemed,\r\nmust be a setting up of props around one--otherwise it was disaster.\r\nThere was no rest, no quiet. He had been futile in longing to drift and\r\ndream; no one drifted except to maelstroms, no one dreamed, without his\r\ndreams becoming fantastic nightmares of indecision and regret.\r\n\r\nPelham! They had quarrelled in Pelham because Gloria must drive. And\r\nwhen she set her little foot on the accelerator the car had jumped off\r\nspunkily, and their two heads had jerked back like marionettes worked by\r\na single string.\r\n\r\nThe Bronx--the houses gathering and gleaming in the sun, which was\r\nfalling now through wide refulgent skies and tumbling caravans of light\r\ndown into the streets. New York, he supposed, was home--the city of\r\nluxury and mystery, of preposterous hopes and exotic dreams. Here on the\r\noutskirts absurd stucco palaces reared themselves in the cool sunset,\r\npoised for an instant in cool unreality, glided off far away, succeeded\r\nby the mazed confusion of the Harlem River. The train moved in through\r\nthe deepening twilight, above and past half a hundred cheerful sweating\r\nstreets of the upper East Side, each one passing the car window like the\r\nspace between the spokes of a gigantic wheel, each one with its vigorous\r\ncolorful revelation of poor children swarming in feverish activity like\r\nvivid ants in alleys of red sand. From the tenement windows leaned\r\nrotund, moon-shaped mothers, as constellations of this sordid heaven;\r\nwomen like dark imperfect jewels, women like vegetables, women like\r\ngreat bags of abominably dirty laundry.\r\n\r\n"I like these streets," observed Anthony aloud. "I always feel as though\r\nit\'s a performance being staged for me; as though the second I\'ve passed\r\nthey\'ll all stop leaping and laughing and, instead, grow very sad,\r\nremembering how poor they are, and retreat with bowed heads into their\r\nhouses. You often get that effect abroad, but seldom in this country."\r\n\r\nDown in a tall busy street he read a dozen Jewish names on a line of\r\nstores; in the door of each stood a dark little man watching the passers\r\nfrom intent eyes--eyes gleaming with suspicion, with pride, with\r\nclarity, with cupidity, with comprehension. New York--he could not\r\ndissociate it now from the slow, upward creep of this people--the little\r\nstores, growing, expanding, consolidating, moving, watched over with\r\nhawk\'s eyes and a bee\'s attention to detail--they slathered out on all\r\nsides. It was impressive--in perspective it was tremendous.\r\n\r\nGloria\'s voice broke in with strange appropriateness upon his thoughts.\r\n\r\n"I wonder where Bloeckman\'s been this summer."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APARTMENT\r\n\r\nAfter the sureties of youth there sets in a period of intense and\r\nintolerable complexity. With the soda-jerker this period is so short as\r\nto be almost negligible. Men higher in the scale hold out longer in the\r\nattempt to preserve the ultimate niceties of relationship, to retain\r\n"impractical" ideas of integrity. But by the late twenties the business\r\nhas grown too intricate, and what has hitherto been imminent and\r\nconfusing has become gradually remote and dim. Routine comes down like\r\ntwilight on a harsh landscape, softening it until it is tolerable. The\r\ncomplexity is too subtle, too varied; the values are changing utterly\r\nwith each lesion of vitality; it has begun to appear that we can learn\r\nnothing from the past with which to face the future--so we cease to be\r\nimpulsive, convincible men, interested in what is ethically true by fine\r\nmargins, we substitute rules of conduct for ideas of integrity, we value\r\nsafety above romance, we become, quite unconsciously, pragmatic. It is\r\nleft to the few to be persistently concerned with the nuances of\r\nrelationships--and even this few only in certain hours especially set\r\naside for the task.\r\n\r\nAnthony Patch had ceased to be an individual of mental adventure, of\r\ncuriosity, and had become an individual of bias and prejudice, with a\r\nlonging to be emotionally undisturbed. This gradual change had taken\r\nplace through the past several years, accelerated by a succession of\r\nanxieties preying on his mind. There was, first of all, the sense of\r\nwaste, always dormant in his heart, now awakened by the circumstances of\r\nhis position. In his moments of insecurity he was haunted by the\r\nsuggestion that life might be, after all, significant. In his early\r\ntwenties the conviction of the futility of effort, of the wisdom of\r\nabnegation, had been confirmed by the philosophies he had admired as\r\nwell as by his association with Maury Noble, and later with his wife.\r\nYet there had been occasions--just before his first meeting with Gloria,\r\nfor example, and when his grandfather had suggested that he should go\r\nabroad as a war correspondent--upon which his dissatisfaction had driven\r\nhim almost to a positive step.\r\n\r\nOne day just before they left Marietta for the last time, in carelessly\r\nturning over the pages of a Harvard Alumni Bulletin, he had found a\r\ncolumn which told him what his contemporaries had been about in this six\r\nyears since graduation. Most of them were in business, it was true, and\r\nseveral were converting the heathen of China or America to a nebulous\r\nprotestantism; but a few, he found, were working constructively at jobs\r\nthat were neither sinecures nor routines. There was Calvin Boyd, for\r\ninstance, who, though barely out of medical school, had discovered a new\r\ntreatment for typhus, had shipped abroad and was mitigating some of the\r\ncivilization that the Great Powers had brought to Servia; there was\r\nEugene Bronson, whose articles in The New Democracy were stamping him as\r\na man with ideas transcending both vulgar timeliness and popular\r\nhysteria; there was a man named Daly who had been suspended from the\r\nfaculty of a righteous university for preaching Marxian doctrines in the\r\nclassroom: in art, science, politics, he saw the authentic personalities\r\nof his time emerging--there was even Severance, the quarter-back, who\r\nhad given up his life rather neatly and gracefully with the Foreign\r\nLegion on the Aisne.\r\n\r\nHe laid down the magazine and thought for a while about these diverse\r\nmen. In the days of his integrity he would have defended his attitude to\r\nthe last--an Epicurus in Nirvana, he would have cried that to struggle\r\nwas to believe, to believe was to limit. He would as soon have become a\r\nchurchgoer because the prospect of immortality gratified him as he would\r\nhave considered entering the leather business because the intensity of\r\nthe competition would have kept him from unhappiness. But at present he\r\nhad no such delicate scruples. This autumn, as his twenty-ninth year\r\nbegan, he was inclined to close his mind to many things, to avoid prying\r\ndeeply into motive and first causes, and mostly to long passionately for\r\nsecurity from the world and from himself. He hated to be alone, as has\r\nbeen said he often dreaded being alone with Gloria.\r\n\r\nBecause of the chasm which his grandfather\'s visit had opened before\r\nhim, and the consequent revulsion from his late mode of life, it was\r\ninevitable that he should look around in this suddenly hostile city for\r\nthe friends and environments that had once seemed the warmest and most\r\nsecure. His first step was a desperate attempt to get back his old\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1912 he had signed a four-year lease at seventeen\r\nhundred a year, with an option of renewal. This lease had expired the\r\nprevious May. When he had first rented the rooms they had been mere\r\npotentialities, scarcely to be discerned as that, but Anthony had seen\r\ninto these potentialities and arranged in the lease that he and the\r\nlandlord should each spend a certain amount in improvements. Rents had\r\ngone up in the past four years, and last spring when Anthony had waived\r\nhis option the landlord, a Mr. Sohenberg, had realized that he could get\r\na much bigger price for what was now a prepossessing apartment.\r\nAccordingly, when Anthony approached him on the subject in September he\r\nwas met with Sohenberg\'s offer of a three-year lease at twenty-five\r\nhundred a year. This, it seemed to Anthony, was outrageous. It meant\r\nthat well over a third of their income would be consumed in rent. In\r\nvain he argued that his own money, his own ideas on the repartitioning,\r\nhad made the rooms attractive.\r\n\r\nIn vain he offered two thousand dollars--twenty-two hundred, though they\r\ncould ill afford it: Mr. Sohenberg was obdurate. It seemed that two\r\nother gentlemen were considering it; just that sort of an apartment was\r\nin demand for the moment, and it would scarcely be business to _give_ it\r\nto Mr. Patch. Besides, though he had never mentioned it before, several\r\nof the other tenants had complained of noise during the previous\r\nwinter--singing and dancing late at night, that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nInternally raging Anthony hurried back to the Ritz to report his\r\ndiscomfiture to Gloria.\r\n\r\n"I can just see you," she stormed, "letting him back you down!"\r\n\r\n"What could I say?"\r\n\r\n"You could have told him what he _was_. I wouldn\'t have _stood_ it. No\r\nother man in the world would have stood it! You just let people order\r\nyou around and cheat you and bully you and take advantage of you as if\r\nyou were a silly little boy. It\'s absurd!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, for Heaven\'s sake, don\'t lose your temper."\r\n\r\n"I know, Anthony, but you _are_ such an ass!"\r\n\r\n"Well, possibly. Anyway, we can\'t afford that apartment. But we can\r\nafford it better than living here at the Ritz."\r\n\r\n"You were the one who insisted on coming here."\r\n\r\n"Yes, because I knew you\'d be miserable in a cheap hotel."\r\n\r\n"Of course I would!"\r\n\r\n"At any rate we\'ve got to find a place to live."\r\n\r\n"How much can we pay?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"Well, we can pay even his price if we sell more bonds, but we agreed\r\nlast night that until I had gotten something definite to do we-"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know all that. I asked you how much we can pay out of just our\r\nincome."\r\n\r\n"They say you ought not to pay more than a fourth."\r\n\r\n"How much is a fourth?"\r\n\r\n"One hundred and fifty a month."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say we\'ve got only six hundred dollars coming in every\r\nmonth?" A subdued note crept into her voice.\r\n\r\n"Of course!" he answered angrily. "Do you think we\'ve gone on spending\r\nmore than twelve thousand a year without cutting way into our capital?"\r\n\r\n"I knew we\'d sold bonds, but--have we spent that much a year? How did\r\nwe?" Her awe increased.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll look in those careful account-books we kept," he remarked\r\nironically, and then added: "Two rents a good part of the time, clothes,\r\ntravel--why, each of those springs in California cost about four\r\nthousand dollars. That darn car was an expense from start to finish. And\r\nparties and amusements and--oh, one thing or another."\r\n\r\nThey were both excited now and inordinately depressed. The situation\r\nseemed worse in the actual telling Gloria than it had when he had first\r\nmade the discovery himself.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to make some money," she said suddenly.\r\n\r\n"I know it."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve got to make another attempt to see your grandfather."\r\n\r\n"I will."\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"When we get settled."\r\n\r\nThis eventuality occurred a week later. They rented a small apartment on\r\nFifty-seventh Street at one hundred and fifty a month. It included\r\nbedroom, living-room, kitchenette, and bath, in a thin, white-stone\r\napartment house, and though the rooms were too small to display\r\nAnthony\'s best furniture, they were clean, new, and, in a blonde and\r\nsanitary way, not unattractive. Bounds had gone abroad to enlist in the\r\nBritish army, and in his place they tolerated rather than enjoyed the\r\nservices of a gaunt, big-boned Irishwoman, whom Gloria loathed because\r\nshe discussed the glories of Sinn Fein as she served breakfast. But they\r\nvowed they would have no more Japanese, and English servants were for\r\nthe present hard to obtain. Like Bounds, the woman prepared only\r\nbreakfast. Their other meals they took at restaurants and hotels.\r\n\r\nWhat finally drove Anthony post-haste up to Tarrytown was an\r\nannouncement in several New York papers that Adam Patch, the\r\nmultimillionaire, the philanthropist, the venerable uplifter, was\r\nseriously ill and not expected to recover.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KITTEN\r\n\r\nAnthony could not see him. The doctors\' instructions were that he was to\r\ntalk to no one, said Mr. Shuttleworth--who offered kindly to take any\r\nmessage that Anthony might care to intrust with him, and deliver it to\r\nAdam Patch when his condition permitted. But by obvious innuendo he\r\nconfirmed Anthony\'s melancholy inference that the prodigal grandson\r\nwould be particularly unwelcome at the bedside. At one point in the\r\nconversation Anthony, with Gloria\'s positive instructions in mind, made\r\na move as though to brush by the secretary, but Shuttleworth with a\r\nsmile squared his brawny shoulders, and Anthony saw how futile such an\r\nattempt would be.\r\n\r\nMiserably intimidated, he returned to New York, where husband and wife\r\npassed a restless week. A little incident that occurred one evening\r\nindicated to what tension their nerves were drawn.\r\n\r\nWalking home along a cross-street after dinner, Anthony noticed a\r\nnight-bound cat prowling near a railing.\r\n\r\n"I always have an instinct to kick a cat," he said idly.\r\n\r\n"I like them."\r\n\r\n"I yielded to it once."\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, years ago; before I met you. One night between the acts of a show.\r\nCold night, like this, and I was a little tight--one of the first times\r\nI was ever tight," he added. "The poor little beggar was looking for a\r\nplace to sleep, I guess, and I was in a mean mood, so it took my fancy\r\nto kick it--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the poor kitty!" cried Gloria, sincerely moved. Inspired with the\r\nnarrative instinct, Anthony enlarged on the theme.\r\n\r\n"It was pretty bad," he admitted. "The poor little beast turned around\r\nand looked at me rather plaintively as though hoping I\'d pick him up and\r\nbe kind to him--he was really just a kitten--and before he knew it a big\r\nfoot launched out at him and caught his little back"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Gloria\'s cry was full of anguish.\r\n\r\n"It was such a cold night," he continued, perversely, keeping his voice\r\nupon a melancholy note. "I guess it expected kindness from somebody, and\r\nit got only pain--"\r\n\r\nHe broke off suddenly--Gloria was sobbing. They had reached home, and\r\nwhen they entered the apartment she threw herself upon the lounge,\r\ncrying as though he had struck at her very soul.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the poor little kitty!" she repeated piteously, "the poor little\r\nkitty. So cold--"\r\n\r\n"Gloria"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t come near me! Please, don\'t come near me. You killed the soft\r\nlittle kitty."\r\n\r\nTouched, Anthony knelt beside her.\r\n\r\n"Dear," he said. "Oh, Gloria, darling. It isn\'t true. I invented\r\nit--every word of it."\r\n\r\nBut she would not believe him. There had been something in the details\r\nhe had chosen to describe that made her cry herself asleep that night,\r\nfor the kitten, for Anthony for herself, for the pain and bitterness and\r\ncruelty of all the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING OF AN AMERICAN MORALIST\r\n\r\nOld Adam died on a midnight of late November with a pious compliment to\r\nhis God on his thin lips. He, who had been flattered so much, faded out\r\nflattering the Omnipotent Abstraction which he fancied he might have\r\nangered in the more lascivious moments of his youth. It was announced\r\nthat he had arranged some sort of an armistice with the deity, the terms\r\nof which were not made public, though they were thought to have included\r\na large cash payment. All the newspapers printed his biography, and two\r\nof them ran short editorials on his sterling worth, and his part in the\r\ndrama of industrialism, with which he had grown up. They referred\r\nguardedly to the reforms he had sponsored and financed. The memories of\r\nComstock and Cato the Censor were resuscitated and paraded like gaunt\r\nghosts through the columns.\r\n\r\nEvery newspaper remarked that he was survived by a single grandson,\r\nAnthony Comstock Patch, of New York.\r\n\r\nThe burial took place in the family plot at Tarrytown. Anthony and\r\nGloria rode in the first carriage, too worried to feel grotesque, both\r\ntrying desperately to glean presage of fortune from the faces of\r\nretainers who had been with him at the end.\r\n\r\nThey waited a frantic week for decency, and then, having received no\r\nnotification of any kind, Anthony called up his grandfather\'s lawyer.\r\nMr. Brett was not he was expected back in an hour. Anthony left his\r\ntelephone number.\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of November, cool and crackling outside, with a\r\nlustreless sun peering bleakly in at the windows. While they waited for\r\nthe call, ostensibly engaged in reading, the atmosphere, within and\r\nwithout, seemed pervaded with a deliberate rendition of the pathetic\r\nfallacy. After an interminable while, the bell jingled, and Anthony,\r\nstarting violently, took up the receiver.\r\n\r\n"Hello ..." His voice was strained and hollow. "Yes--I did leave word.\r\nWho is this, please? ... Yes.... Why, it was about the estate. Naturally\r\nI\'m interested, and I\'ve received no word about the reading of the\r\nwill--I thought you might not have my address.... What? ... Yes ..."\r\n\r\nGloria fell on her knees. The intervals between Anthony\'s speeches were\r\nlike tourniquets winding on her heart. She found herself helplessly\r\ntwisting the large buttons from a velvet cushion. Then:\r\n\r\n"That\'s--that\'s very, very odd--that\'s very odd--that\'s very odd. Not\r\neven any--ah--mention or any--ah--reason?"\r\n\r\nHis voice sounded faint and far away. She uttered a little sound, half\r\ngasp, half cry.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll see.... All right, thanks ... thanks...."\r\n\r\nThe phone clicked. Her eyes looking along the floor saw his feet cut the\r\npattern of a patch of sunlight on the carpet. She arose and faced him\r\nwith a gray, level glance just as his arms folded about her.\r\n\r\n"My dearest," he whispered huskily. "He did it, God damn him!"\r\n\r\nNEXT DAY\r\n\r\n"Who are the heirs?" asked Mr. Haight. "You see when you can tell me so\r\nlittle about it--"\r\n\r\nMr. Haight was tall and bent and beetle-browed. He had been recommended\r\nto Anthony as an astute and tenacious lawyer.\r\n\r\n"I only know vaguely," answered Anthony. "A man named Shuttleworth, who\r\nwas a sort of pet of his, has the whole thing in charge as administrator\r\nor trustee or something--all except the direct bequests to charity and\r\nthe provisions for servants and for those two cousins in Idaho."\r\n\r\n"How distant are the cousins?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, third or fourth, anyway. I never even heard of them."\r\n\r\nMr. Haight nodded comprehensively.\r\n\r\n"And you want to contest a provision of the will?"\r\n\r\n"I guess so," admitted Anthony helplessly. "I want to do what sounds\r\nmost hopeful--that\'s what I want you to tell me."\r\n\r\n"You want them to refuse probate to the will?"\r\n\r\nAnthony shook his head.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got me. I haven\'t any idea what \'probate\' is. I want a share of\r\nthe estate."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you tell me some more details. For instance, do you know why\r\nthe testator disinherited you?"\r\n\r\n"Why--yes," began Anthony. "You see he was always a sucker for moral\r\nreform, and all that--"\r\n\r\n"I know," interjected Mr. Haight humorlessly.\r\n\r\n"--and I don\'t suppose he ever thought I was much good. I didn\'t go into\r\nbusiness, you see. But I feel certain that up to last summer I was one\r\nof the beneficiaries. We had a house out in Marietta, and one night\r\ngrandfather got the notion he\'d come over and see us. It just happened\r\nthat there was a rather gay party going on and he arrived without any\r\nwarning. Well, he took one look, he and this fellow Shuttleworth, and\r\nthen turned around and tore right back to Tarrytown. After that he never\r\nanswered my letters or even let me see him."\r\n\r\n"He was a prohibitionist, wasn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"He was everything--regular religious maniac."\r\n\r\n"How long before his death was the will made that disinherited you?"\r\n\r\n"Recently--I mean since August."\r\n\r\n"And you think that the direct reason for his not leaving you the\r\nmajority of the estate was his displeasure with your recent actions?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nMr. Haight considered. Upon what grounds was Anthony thinking of\r\ncontesting the will?\r\n\r\n"Why, isn\'t there something about evil influence?"\r\n\r\n"Undue influence is one ground--but it\'s the most difficult. You would\r\nhave to show that such pressure was brought to bear so that the deceased\r\nwas in a condition where he disposed of his property contrary to his\r\nintentions--"\r\n\r\n"Well, suppose this fellow Shuttleworth dragged him over to Marietta\r\njust when he thought some sort of a celebration was probably going on?"\r\n\r\n"That wouldn\'t have any bearing on the case. There\'s a strong division\r\nbetween advice and influence. You\'d have to prove that the secretary had\r\na sinister intention. I\'d suggest some other grounds. A will is\r\nautomatically refused probate in case of insanity, drunkenness"--here\r\nAnthony smiled--"or feeble-mindedness through premature old age."\r\n\r\n"But," objected Anthony, "his private physician, being one of the\r\nbeneficiaries, would testify that he wasn\'t feeble-minded. And he\r\nwasn\'t. As a matter of fact he probably did just what he intended to\r\nwith his money--it was perfectly consistent with everything he\'d ever\r\ndone in his life--"\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, feeble-mindedness is a great deal like undue\r\ninfluence--it implies that the property wasn\'t disposed of as originally\r\nintended. The most common ground is duress--physical pressure."\r\n\r\nAnthony shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Not much chance on that, I\'m afraid. Undue influence sounds best to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nAfter more discussion, so technical as to be largely unintelligible to\r\nAnthony, he retained Mr. Haight as counsel. The lawyer proposed an\r\ninterview with Shuttleworth, who, jointly with Wilson, Hiemer and Hardy,\r\nwas executor of the will. Anthony was to come back later in the week.\r\n\r\nIt transpired that the estate consisted of approximately forty million\r\ndollars. The largest bequest to an individual was of one million, to\r\nEdward Shuttleworth, who received in addition thirty thousand a year\r\nsalary as administrator of the thirty-million-dollar trust fund, left to\r\nbe doled out to various charities and reform societies practically at\r\nhis own discretion. The remaining nine millions were proportioned among\r\nthe two cousins in Idaho and about twenty-five other beneficiaries:\r\nfriends, secretaries, servants, and employees, who had, at one time or\r\nanother, earned the seal of Adam Patch\'s approval.\r\n\r\nAt the end of another fortnight Mr. Haight, on a retainer\'s fee of\r\nfifteen thousand dollars, had begun preparations for contesting\r\nthe will.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER OF DISCONTENT\r\n\r\nBefore they had been two months in the little apartment on Fifty-seventh\r\nStreet, it had assumed for both of them the same indefinable but almost\r\nmaterial taint that had impregnated the gray house in Marietta. There\r\nwas the odor of tobacco always--both of them smoked incessantly; it was\r\nin their clothes, their blankets, the curtains, and the ash-littered\r\ncarpets. Added to this was the wretched aura of stale wine, with its\r\ninevitable suggestion of beauty gone foul and revelry remembered in\r\ndisgust. About a particular set of glass goblets on the sideboard the\r\nodor was particularly noticeable, and in the main room the mahogany\r\ntable was ringed with white circles where glasses had been set down upon\r\nit. There had been many parties--people broke things; people became sick\r\nin Gloria\'s bathroom; people spilled wine; people made unbelievable\r\nmesses of the kitchenette.\r\n\r\nThese things were a regular part of their existence. Despite the\r\nresolutions of many Mondays it was tacitly understood as the week end\r\napproached that it should be observed with some sort of unholy\r\nexcitement. When Saturday came they would not discuss the matter, but\r\nwould call up this person or that from among their circle of\r\nsufficiently irresponsible friends, and suggest a rendezvous. Only after\r\nthe friends had gathered and Anthony had set out decanters, would he\r\nmurmur casually "I guess I\'ll have just one high-ball myself--"\r\n\r\nThen they were off for two days--realizing on a wintry dawn that they\r\nhad been the noisiest and most conspicuous members of the noisiest and\r\nmost conspicuous party at the Boul\' Mich\', or the Club Ramee, or at\r\nother resorts much less particular about the hilarity of their\r\nclientele. They would find that they had, somehow, squandered eighty or\r\nninety dollars, how, they never knew; they customarily attributed it to\r\nthe general penury of the "friends" who had accompanied them.\r\n\r\nIt began to be not unusual for the more sincere of their friends to\r\nremonstrate with them, in the very course of a party, and to predict a\r\nsombre end for them in the loss of Gloria\'s "looks" and Anthony\'s\r\n"constitution."\r\n\r\nThe story of the summarily interrupted revel in Marietta had, of course,\r\nleaked out in detail--"Muriel doesn\'t mean to tell every one she knows,"\r\nsaid Gloria to Anthony, "but she thinks every one she tells is the only\r\none she\'s going to tell"--and, diaphanously veiled, the tale had been\r\ngiven a conspicuous place in Town Tattle. When the terms of Adam Patch\'s\r\nwill were made public and the newspapers printed items concerning\r\nAnthony\'s suit, the story was beautifully rounded out--to Anthony\'s\r\ninfinite disparagement. They began to hear rumors about themselves from\r\nall quarters, rumors founded usually on a soupcon of truth, but overlaid\r\nwith preposterous and sinister detail.\r\n\r\nOutwardly they showed no signs of deterioration. Gloria at twenty-six\r\nwas still the Gloria of twenty; her complexion a fresh damp setting for\r\nher candid eyes; her hair still a childish glory, darkening slowly from\r\ncorn color to a deep russet gold; her slender body suggesting ever a\r\nnymph running and dancing through Orphic groves. Masculine eyes, dozens\r\nof them, followed her with a fascinated stare when she walked through a\r\nhotel lobby or down the aisle of a theatre. Men asked to be introduced\r\nto her, fell into prolonged states of sincere admiration, made definite\r\nlove to her--for she was still a thing of exquisite and unbelievable\r\nbeauty. And for his part Anthony had rather gained than lost in\r\nappearance; his face had taken on a certain intangible air of tragedy,\r\nromantically contrasted with his trim and immaculate person.\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter, when all conversation turned on the probability of\r\nAmerica\'s going into the war, when Anthony was making a desperate and\r\nsincere attempt to write, Muriel Kane arrived in New York and came\r\nimmediately to see them. Like Gloria, she seemed never to change. She\r\nknew the latest slang, danced the latest dances, and talked of the\r\nlatest songs and plays with all the fervor of her first season as a New\r\nYork drifter. Her coyness was eternally new, eternally ineffectual; her\r\nclothes were extreme; her black hair was bobbed, now, like Gloria\'s.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come up for the midwinter prom at New Haven," she announced,\r\nimparting her delightful secret. Though she must have been older then\r\nthan any of the boys in college, she managed always to secure some sort\r\nof invitation, imagining vaguely that at the next party would occur the\r\nflirtation which was to end at the romantic altar.\r\n\r\n"Where\'ve you been?" inquired Anthony, unfailingly amused.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been at Hot Springs. It\'s been slick and peppy this fall--more\r\n_men!_"\r\n\r\n"Are you in love, Muriel?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean \'love\'?" This was the rhetorical question of the year.\r\n"I\'m going to tell you something," she said, switching the subject\r\nabruptly. "I suppose it\'s none of my business, but I think it\'s time for\r\nyou two to settle down."\r\n\r\n"Why, we are settled down."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are!" she scoffed archly. "Everywhere I go I hear stories of\r\nyour escapades. Let me tell you, I have an awful time sticking up\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t bother," said Gloria coldly.\r\n\r\n"Now, Gloria," she protested, "you know I\'m one of your best friends."\r\n\r\nGloria was silent. Muriel continued:\r\n\r\n"It\'s not so much the idea of a woman drinking, but Gloria\'s so pretty,\r\nand so many people know her by sight all around, that it\'s naturally\r\nconspicuous--"\r\n\r\n"What have you heard recently?" demanded Gloria, her dignity going down\r\nbefore her curiosity.\r\n\r\n"Well, for instance, that that party in Marietta _killed_ Anthony\'s\r\ngrandfather."\r\n\r\nInstantly husband and wife were tense with annoyance.\r\n\r\n"Why, I think that\'s outrageous."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what they say," persisted Muriel stubbornly.\r\n\r\nAnthony paced the room. "It\'s preposterous!" he declared. "The very\r\npeople we take on parties shout the story around as a great joke--and\r\neventually it gets back to us in some such form as this."\r\n\r\nGloria began running her finger through a stray red-dish curl. Muriel\r\nlicked her veil as she considered her next remark.\r\n\r\n"You ought to have a baby."\r\n\r\nGloria looked up wearily.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t afford it."\r\n\r\n"All the people in the slums have them," said Muriel triumphantly.\r\n\r\nAnthony and Gloria exchanged a smile. They had reached the stage of\r\nviolent quarrels that were never made up, quarrels that smouldered and\r\nbroke out again at intervals or died away from sheer indifference--but\r\nthis visit of Muriel\'s drew them temporarily together. When the\r\ndiscomfort under which they were living was remarked upon by a third\r\nparty, it gave them the impetus to face this hostile world together. It\r\nwas very seldom, now, that the impulse toward reunion sprang\r\nfrom within.\r\n\r\nAnthony found himself associating his own existence with that of the\r\napartment\'s night elevator man, a pale, scraggly bearded person of about\r\nsixty, with an air of being somewhat above his station. It was probably\r\nbecause of this quality that he had secured the position; it made him a\r\npathetic and memorable figure of failure. Anthony recollected, without\r\nhumor, a hoary jest about the elevator man\'s career being a matter of\r\nups and downs--it was, at any rate, an enclosed life of infinite\r\ndreariness. Each time Anthony stepped into the car he waited\r\nbreathlessly for the old man\'s "Well, I guess we\'re going to have some\r\nsunshine to-day." Anthony thought how little rain or sunshine he would\r\nenjoy shut into that close little cage in the smoke-colored,\r\nwindowless hall.\r\n\r\nA darkling figure, he attained tragedy in leaving the life that had used\r\nhim so shabbily. Three young gunmen came in one night, tied him up and\r\nleft him on a pile of coal in the cellar while they went through the\r\ntrunk room. When the janitor found him next morning he had collapsed\r\nfrom chill. He died of pneumonia four days later.\r\n\r\nHe was replaced by a glib Martinique negro, with an incongruous British\r\naccent and a tendency to be surly, whom Anthony detested. The passing of\r\nthe old man had approximately the same effect on him that the kitten\r\nstory had had on Gloria. He was reminded of the cruelty of all life and,\r\nin consequence, of the increasing bitterness of his own.\r\n\r\nHe was writing--and in earnest at last. He had gone to Dick and listened\r\nfor a tense hour to an elucidation of those minutiae of procedure which\r\nhitherto he had rather scornfully looked down upon. He needed money\r\nimmediately--he was selling bonds every month to pay their bills. Dick\r\nwas frank and explicit:\r\n\r\n"So far as articles on literary subjects in these obscure magazines go,\r\nyou couldn\'t make enough to pay your rent. Of course if a man has the\r\ngift of humor, or a chance at a big biography, or some specialized\r\nknowledge, he may strike it rich. But for you, fiction\'s the only thing.\r\nYou say you need money right away?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly do."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'d be a year and a half before you\'d make any money out of a\r\nnovel. Try some popular short stories. And, by the way, unless they\'re\r\nexceptionally brilliant they have to be cheerful and on the side of the\r\nheaviest artillery to make you any money."\r\n\r\nAnthony thought of Dick\'s recent output, which had been appearing in a\r\nwell-known monthly. It was concerned chiefly with the preposterous\r\nactions of a class of sawdust effigies who, one was assured, were New\r\nYork society people, and it turned, as a rule, upon questions of the\r\nheroine\'s technical purity, with mock-sociological overtones about the\r\n"mad antics of the four hundred."\r\n\r\n"But your stories--" exclaimed Anthony aloud, almost involuntarily.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s different," Dick asserted astoundingly. "I have a\r\nreputation, you see, so I\'m expected to deal with strong themes."\r\n\r\nAnthony gave an interior start, realizing with this remark how much\r\nRichard Caramel had fallen off. Did he actually think that these amazing\r\nlatter productions were as good as his first novel?\r\n\r\nAnthony went back to the apartment and set to work. He found that the\r\nbusiness of optimism was no mean task. After half a dozen futile starts\r\nhe went to the public library and for a week investigated the files of a\r\npopular magazine. Then, better equipped, he accomplished his first\r\nstory, "The Dictaphone of Fate." It was founded upon one of his few\r\nremaining impressions of that six weeks in Wall Street the year before.\r\nIt purported to be the sunny tale of an office boy who, quite by\r\naccident, hummed a wonderful melody into the dictaphone. The cylinder\r\nwas discovered by the boss\'s brother, a well-known producer of musical\r\ncomedy--and then immediately lost. The body of the story was concerned\r\nwith the pursuit of the missing cylinder and the eventual marriage of\r\nthe noble office boy (now a successful composer) to Miss Rooney, the\r\nvirtuous stenographer, who was half Joan of Arc and half Florence\r\nNightingale.\r\n\r\nHe had gathered that this was what the magazines wanted. He offered, in\r\nhis protagonists, the customary denizens of the pink-and-blue literary\r\nworld, immersing them in a saccharine plot that would offend not a\r\nsingle stomach in Marietta. He had it typed in double space--this last\r\nas advised by a booklet, "Success as a Writer Made Easy," by R. Meggs\r\nWiddlestien, which assured the ambitious plumber of the futility of\r\nperspiration, since after a six-lesson course he could make at least a\r\nthousand dollars a month.\r\n\r\nAfter reading it to a bored Gloria and coaxing from her the immemorial\r\nremark that it was "better than a lot of stuff that gets published," he\r\nsatirically affixed the nom de plume of "Gilles de Sade," enclosed the\r\nproper return envelope, and sent it off.\r\n\r\nFollowing the gigantic labor of conception he decided to wait until he\r\nheard from the first story before beginning another. Dick had told him\r\nthat he might get as much as two hundred dollars. If by any chance it\r\ndid happen to be unsuited, the editor\'s letter would, no doubt, give him\r\nan idea of what changes should be made.\r\n\r\n"It is, without question, the most abominable piece of writing in\r\nexistence," said Anthony.\r\n\r\nThe editor quite conceivably agreed with him. He returned the manuscript\r\nwith a rejection slip. Anthony sent it off elsewhere and began another\r\nstory. The second one was called "The Little Open Doors"; it was written\r\nin three days. It concerned the occult: an estranged couple were brought\r\ntogether by a medium in a vaudeville show.\r\n\r\nThere were six altogether, six wretched and pitiable efforts to "write\r\ndown" by a man who had never before made a consistent effort to write at\r\nall. Not one of them contained a spark of vitality, and their total\r\nyield of grace and felicity was less than that of an average newspaper\r\ncolumn. During their circulation they collected, all told, thirty-one\r\nrejection slips, headstones for the packages that he would find lying\r\nlike dead bodies at his door.\r\n\r\nIn mid-January Gloria\'s father died, and they went again to Kansas\r\nCity--a miserable trip, for Gloria brooded interminably, not upon her\r\nfather\'s death, but on her mother\'s. Russel Gilbert\'s affairs having\r\nbeen cleared up they came into possession of about three thousand\r\ndollars, and a great amount of furniture. This was in storage, for he\r\nhad spent his last days in a small hotel. It was due to his death that\r\nAnthony made a new discovery concerning Gloria. On the journey East she\r\ndisclosed herself, astonishingly, as a Bilphist.\r\n\r\n"Why, Gloria," he cried, "you don\'t mean to tell me you believe that\r\nstuff."\r\n\r\n"Well," she said defiantly, "why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because it\'s--it\'s fantastic. You know that in every sense of the word\r\nyou\'re an agnostic. You\'d laugh at any orthodox form of\r\nChristianity--and then you come out with the statement that you believe\r\nin some silly rule of reincarnation."\r\n\r\n"What if I do? I\'ve heard you and Maury, and every one else for whose\r\nintellect I have the slightest respect, agree that life as it appears is\r\nutterly meaningless. But it\'s always seemed to me that if I were\r\nunconsciously learning something here it might not be so meaningless."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not learning anything--you\'re just getting tired. And if you\r\nmust have a faith to soften things, take up one that appeals to the\r\nreason of some one beside a lot of hysterical women. A person like you\r\noughtn\'t to accept anything unless it\'s decently demonstrable."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care about truth. I want some happiness."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'ve got a decent mind the second has got to be qualified by\r\nthe first. Any simple soul can delude himself with mental garbage."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," she held out stoutly, "and, what\'s more, I\'m not\r\npropounding any doctrine."\r\n\r\nThe argument faded off, but reoccurred to Anthony several times\r\nthereafter. It was disturbing to find this old belief, evidently\r\nassimilated from her mother, inserting itself again under its immemorial\r\ndisguise as an innate idea.\r\n\r\nThey reached New York in March after an expensive and ill-advised week\r\nspent in Hot Springs, and Anthony resumed his abortive attempts at\r\nfiction. As it became plainer to both of them that escape did not lie in\r\nthe way of popular literature, there was a further slipping of their\r\nmutual confidence and courage. A complicated struggle went on\r\nincessantly between them. All efforts to keep down expenses died away\r\nfrom sheer inertia, and by March they were again using any pretext as an\r\nexcuse for a "party." With an assumption of recklessness Gloria tossed\r\nout the suggestion that they should take all their money and go on a\r\nreal spree while it lasted--anything seemed better than to see it go in\r\nunsatisfactory driblets.\r\n\r\n"Gloria, you want parties as much as I do."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter about me. Everything I do is in accordance with my\r\nideas: to use every minute of these years, when I\'m young, in having the\r\nbest time I possibly can."\r\n\r\n"How about after that?"\r\n\r\n"After that I won\'t care."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you will."\r\n\r\n"Well, I may--but I won\'t be able to do anything about it. And I\'ll have\r\nhad my good time."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be the same then. After a fashion, we _have_ had our good time,\r\nraised the devil, and we\'re in the state of paying for it."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the money kept going. There would be two days of gaiety,\r\ntwo days of moroseness--an endless, almost invariable round. The sharp\r\npull-ups, when they occurred, resulted usually in a spurt of work for\r\nAnthony, while Gloria, nervous and bored, remained in bed or else chewed\r\nabstractedly at her fingers. After a day or so of this, they would make\r\nan engagement, and then--Oh, what did it matter? This night, this glow,\r\nthe cessation of anxiety and the sense that if living was not purposeful\r\nit was, at any rate, essentially romantic! Wine gave a sort of gallantry\r\nto their own failure.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the suit progressed slowly, with interminable examinations of\r\nwitnesses and marshallings of evidence. The preliminary proceedings of\r\nsettling the estate were finished. Mr. Haight saw no reason why the case\r\nshould not come up for trial before summer.\r\n\r\nBloeckman appeared in New York late in March; he had been in England for\r\nnearly a year on matters concerned with "Films Par Excellence." The\r\nprocess of general refinement was still in progress--always he dressed a\r\nlittle better, his intonation was mellower, and in his manner there was\r\nperceptibly more assurance that the fine things of the world were his by\r\na natural and inalienable right. He called at the apartment, remained\r\nonly an hour, during which he talked chiefly of the war, and left\r\ntelling them he was coming again. On his second visit Anthony was not at\r\nhome, but an absorbed and excited Gloria greeted her husband later in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\n"Anthony," she began, "would you still object if I went in the movies?"\r\n\r\nHis whole heart hardened against the idea. As she seemed to recede from\r\nhim, if only in threat, her presence became again not so much precious\r\nas desperately necessary.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Gloria--!"\r\n\r\n"Blockhead said he\'d put me in--only if I\'m ever going to do anything\r\nI\'ll have to start now. They only want young women. Think of the\r\nmoney, Anthony!"\r\n\r\n"For you--yes. But how about me?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know that anything I have is yours too?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s such a hell of a career!" he burst out, the moral, the infinitely\r\ncircumspect Anthony, "and such a hell of a bunch. And I\'m so utterly\r\ntired of that fellow Bloeckman coming here and interfering. I hate\r\ntheatrical things."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t theatrical! It\'s utterly different."\r\n\r\n"What am I supposed to do? Chase you all over the country? Live on your\r\nmoney?"\r\n\r\n"Then make some yourself."\r\n\r\nThe conversation developed into one of the most violent quarrels they\r\nhad ever had. After the ensuing reconciliation and the inevitable period\r\nof moral inertia, she realized that he had taken the life out of the\r\nproject. Neither of them ever mentioned the probability that Bloeckman\r\nwas by no means disinterested, but they both knew that it lay back of\r\nAnthony\'s objection.\r\n\r\nIn April war was declared with Germany. Wilson and his cabinet--a\r\ncabinet that in its lack of distinction was strangely reminiscent of the\r\ntwelve apostles--let loose the carefully starved dogs of war, and the\r\npress began to whoop hysterically against the sinister morals, sinister\r\nphilosophy, and sinister music produced by the Teutonic temperament.\r\nThose who fancied themselves particularly broad-minded made the\r\nexquisite distinction that it was only the German Government which\r\naroused them to hysteria; the rest were worked up to a condition of\r\nretching indecency. Any song which contained the word "mother" and the\r\nword "kaiser" was assured of a tremendous success. At last every one had\r\nsomething to talk about--and almost every one fully enjoyed it, as\r\nthough they had been cast for parts in a sombre and romantic play.\r\n\r\nAnthony, Maury, and Dick sent in their applications for officers\'\r\ntraining-camps and the two latter went about feeling strangely exalted\r\nand reproachless; they chattered to each other, like college boys, of\r\nwar\'s being the one excuse for, and justification of, the aristocrat,\r\nand conjured up an impossible caste of officers, to be composed, it\r\nappeared, chiefly of the more attractive alumni of three or four Eastern\r\ncolleges. It seemed to Gloria that in this huge red light streaming\r\nacross the nation even Anthony took on a new glamour.\r\n\r\nThe Tenth Infantry, arriving in New York from Panama, were escorted from\r\nsaloon to saloon by patriotic citizens, to their great bewilderment.\r\nWest Pointers began to be noticed for the first time in years, and the\r\ngeneral impression was that everything was glorious, but not half so\r\nglorious as it was going to be pretty soon, and that everybody was a\r\nfine fellow, and every race a great race--always excepting the\r\nGermans--and in every strata of society outcasts and scapegoats had but\r\nto appear in uniform to be forgiven, cheered, and wept over by\r\nrelatives, ex-friends, and utter strangers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a small and precise doctor decided that there was\r\nsomething the matter with Anthony\'s blood-pressure. He could not\r\nconscientiously pass him for an officers\' training-camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROKEN LUTE\r\n\r\nTheir third anniversary passed, uncelebrated, unnoticed. The season\r\nwarmed in thaw, melted into hotter summer, simmered and boiled away. In\r\nJuly the will was offered for probate, and upon the contestation was\r\nassigned by the surrogate to trial term for trial. The matter was\r\nprolonged into September--there was difficulty in empanelling an\r\nunbiassed jury because of the moral sentiments involved. To Anthony\'s\r\ndisappointment a verdict was finally returned in favor of the testator,\r\nwhereupon Mr. Haight caused a notice of appeal to be served upon Edward\r\nShuttleworth.\r\n\r\nAs the summer waned Anthony and Gloria talked of the things they were to\r\ndo when the money was theirs, and of the places they were to go to after\r\nthe war, when they would "agree on things again," for both of them\r\nlooked forward to a time when love, springing like the phoenix from its\r\nown ashes, should be born again in its mysterious and unfathomable haunts.\r\n\r\nHe was drafted early in the fall, and the examining doctor made no\r\nmention of low blood-pressure. It was all very purposeless and sad when\r\nAnthony told Gloria one night that he wanted, above all things, to be\r\nkilled. But, as always, they were sorry for each other for the wrong\r\nthings at the wrong times....\r\n\r\nThey decided that for the present she was not to go with him to the\r\nSouthern camp where his contingent was ordered. She would remain in New\r\nYork to "use the apartment," to save money, and to watch the progress of\r\nthe case--which was pending now in the Appellate Division, of which the\r\ncalendar, Mr. Haight told them, was far behind.\r\n\r\nAlmost their last conversation was a senseless quarrel about the proper\r\ndivision of the income--at a word either would have given it all to the\r\nother. It was typical of the muddle and confusion of their lives that on\r\nthe October night when Anthony reported at the Grand Central Station for\r\nthe journey to camp, she arrived only in time to catch his eye over the\r\nanxious heads of a gathered crowd. Through the dark light of the\r\nenclosed train-sheds their glances stretched across a hysterical area,\r\nfoul with yellow sobbing and the smells of poor women. They must have\r\npondered upon what they had done to one another, and each must have\r\naccused himself of drawing this sombre pattern through which they were\r\ntracing tragically and obscurely. At the last they were too far away for\r\neither to see the other\'s tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THREE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nA MATTER OF CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nAt a frantic command from some invisible source, Anthony groped his way\r\ninside. He was thinking that for the first time in more than three years\r\nhe was to remain longer than a night away from Gloria. The finality of\r\nit appealed to him drearily. It was his clean and lovely girl that he\r\nwas leaving.\r\n\r\nThey had arrived, he thought, at the most practical financial\r\nsettlement: she was to have three hundred and seventy-five dollars a\r\nmonth--not too much considering that over half of that would go in\r\nrent--and he was taking fifty to supplement his pay. He saw no need for\r\nmore: food, clothes, and quarters would be provided--there were no\r\nsocial obligations for a private.\r\n\r\nThe car was crowded and already thick with breath. It was one of the\r\ntype known as "tourist" cars, a sort of brummagem Pullman, with a bare\r\nfloor, and straw seats that needed cleaning. Nevertheless, Anthony\r\ngreeted it with relief. He had vaguely expected that the trip South\r\nwould be made in a freight-car, in one end of which would stand eight\r\nhorses and in the other forty men. He had heard the "hommes 40, chevaux\r\n8" story so often that it had become confused and ominous.\r\n\r\nAs he rocked down the aisle with his barrack-bag slung at his shoulder\r\nlike a monstrous blue sausage, he saw no vacant seats, but after a\r\nmoment his eye fell on a single space at present occupied by the feet of\r\na short swarthy Sicilian, who, with his hat drawn over his eyes, hunched\r\ndefiantly in the corner. As Anthony stopped beside him he stared up with\r\na scowl, evidently intended to be intimidating; he must have adopted it\r\nas a defense against this entire gigantic equation. At Anthony\'s sharp\r\n"That seat taken?" he very slowly lifted the feet as though they were a\r\nbreakable package, and placed them with some care upon the floor. His\r\neyes remained on Anthony, who meanwhile sat down and unbuttoned the\r\nuniform coat issued him at Camp Upton the day before. It chafed him\r\nunder the arms.\r\n\r\nBefore Anthony could scrutinize the other occupants of the section a\r\nyoung second lieutenant blew in at the upper end of the car and wafted\r\nairily down the aisle, announcing in a voice of appalling acerbity:\r\n\r\n"There will be no smoking in this car! No smoking! Don\'t smoke, men, in\r\nthis car!"\r\n\r\nAs he sailed out at the other end a dozen little clouds of expostulation\r\narose on all sides.\r\n\r\n"Oh, cripe!"\r\n\r\n"Jeese!"\r\n\r\n"No _smokin\'_?"\r\n\r\n"Hey, come back here, fella!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s \'ee idea?"\r\n\r\nTwo or three cigarettes were shot out through the open windows. Others\r\nwere retained inside, though kept sketchily away from view. From here\r\nand there in accents of bravado, of mockery, of submissive humor, a few\r\nremarks were dropped that soon melted into the listless and\r\npervasive silence.\r\n\r\nThe fourth occupant of Anthony\'s section spoke up suddenly.\r\n\r\n"G\'by, liberty," he said sullenly. "G\'by, everything except bein\' an\r\nofficer\'s dog."\r\n\r\nAnthony looked at him. He was a tall Irishman with an expression moulded\r\nof indifference and utter disdain. His eyes fell on Anthony, as though\r\nhe expected an answer, and then upon the others. Receiving only a\r\ndefiant stare from the Italian he groaned and spat noisily on the floor\r\nby way of a dignified transition back into taciturnity.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the door opened again and the second lieutenant was\r\nborne in upon his customary official zephyr, this time singing out a\r\ndifferent tiding:\r\n\r\n"All right, men, smoke if you want to! My mistake, men! It\'s all right,\r\nmen! Go on and smoke--my mistake!"\r\n\r\nThis time Anthony had a good look at him. He was young, thin, already\r\nfaded; he was like his own mustache; he was like a great piece of shiny\r\nstraw. His chin receded, faintly; this was offset by a magnificent and\r\nunconvincing scowl, a scowl that Anthony was to connect with the faces\r\nof many young officers during the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nImmediately every one smoked--whether they had previously desired to or\r\nnot. Anthony\'s cigarette contributed to the hazy oxidation which seemed\r\nto roll back and forth in opalescent clouds with every motion of the\r\ntrain. The conversation, which had lapsed between the two impressive\r\nvisits of the young officer, now revived tepidly; the men across the\r\naisle began making clumsy experiments with their straw seats\' capacity\r\nfor comparative comfort; two card games, half-heartedly begun, soon drew\r\nseveral spectators to sitting positions on the arms of seats. In a few\r\nminutes Anthony became aware of a persistently obnoxious sound--the\r\nsmall, defiant Sicilian had fallen audibly asleep. It was wearisome to\r\ncontemplate that animate protoplasm, reasonable by courtesy only, shut\r\nup in a car by an incomprehensible civilization, taken somewhere, to do\r\na vague something without aim or significance or consequence. Anthony\r\nsighed, opened a newspaper which he had no recollection of buying, and\r\nbegan to read by the dim yellow light.\r\n\r\nTen o\'clock bumped stuffily into eleven; the hours clogged and caught\r\nand slowed down. Amazingly the train halted along the dark countryside,\r\nfrom time to time indulging in short, deceitful movements backward or\r\nforward, and whistling harsh paeans into the high October night. Having\r\nread his newspaper through, editorials, cartoons, and war-poems, his eye\r\nfell on a half-column headed _Shakespeareville, Kansas_. It seemed that\r\nthe Shakespeareville Chamber of Commerce had recently held an\r\nenthusiastic debate as to whether the American soldiers should be known\r\nas "Sammies" or "Battling Christians." The thought gagged him. He\r\ndropped the newspaper, yawned, and let his mind drift off at a tangent.\r\nHe wondered why Gloria had been late. It seemed so long ago already--he\r\nhad a pang of illusive loneliness. He tried to imagine from what angle\r\nshe would regard her new position, what place in her considerations he\r\nwould continue to hold. The thought acted as a further depressant--he\r\nopened his paper and began to read again.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Chamber of Commerce in Shakespeareville had decided\r\nupon "Liberty Lads."\r\n\r\nFor two nights and two days they rattled southward, making mysterious\r\ninexplicable stops in what were apparently arid wastes, and then rushing\r\nthrough large cities with a pompous air of hurry. The whimsicalities of\r\nthis train foreshadowed for Anthony the whimsicalities of all army\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn the arid wastes they were served from the baggage-car with beans and\r\nbacon that at first he was unable to eat--he dined scantily on some milk\r\nchocolate distributed by a village canteen. But on the second day the\r\nbaggage-car\'s output began to appear surprisingly palatable. On the\r\nthird morning the rumor was passed along that within the hour they would\r\narrive at their destination, Camp Hooker.\r\n\r\nIt had become intolerably hot in the car, and the men were all in shirt\r\nsleeves. The sun came in through the windows, a tired and ancient sun,\r\nyellow as parchment and stretched out of shape in transit. It tried to\r\nenter in triumphant squares and produced only warped splotches--but it\r\nwas appallingly steady; so much so that it disturbed Anthony not to be\r\nthe pivot of all the inconsequential sawmills and trees and telegraph\r\npoles that were turning around him so fast. Outside it played its heavy\r\ntremolo over olive roads and fallow cotton-fields, back of which ran a\r\nragged line of woods broken with eminences of gray rock. The foreground\r\nwas dotted sparsely with wretched, ill-patched shanties, among which\r\nthere would flash by, now and then, a specimen of the languid yokelry of\r\nSouth Carolina, or else a strolling darky with sullen and\r\nbewildered eyes.\r\n\r\nThen the woods moved off and they rolled into a broad space like the\r\nbaked top of a gigantic cake, sugared with an infinity of tents arranged\r\nin geometric figures over its surface. The train came to an uncertain\r\nstop, and the sun and the poles and the trees faded, and his universe\r\nrocked itself slowly back to its old usualness, with Anthony Patch in\r\nthe centre. As the men, weary and perspiring, crowded out of the car, he\r\nsmelt that unforgetable aroma that impregnates all permanent camps--the\r\nodor of garbage.\r\n\r\nCamp Hooker was an astonishing and spectacular growth, suggesting "A\r\nMining Town in 1870--The Second Week." It was a thing of wooden shacks\r\nand whitish-gray tents, connected by a pattern of roads, with hard tan\r\ndrill-grounds fringed with trees. Here and there stood green Y.M.C.A.\r\nhouses, unpromising oases, with their muggy odor of wet flannels and\r\nclosed telephone-booths--and across from each of them there was usually\r\na canteen, swarming with life, presided over indolently by an officer\r\nwho, with the aid of a side-car, usually managed to make his detail a\r\npleasant and chatty sinecure.\r\n\r\nUp and down the dusty roads sped the soldiers of the quartermaster\r\ncorps, also in side-cars. Up and down drove the generals in their\r\ngovernment automobiles, stopping now and then to bring unalert details\r\nto attention, to frown heavily upon captains marching at the heads of\r\ncompanies, to set the pompous pace in that gorgeous game of showing off\r\nwhich was taking place triumphantly over the entire area.\r\n\r\nThe first week after the arrival of Anthony\'s draft was filled with a\r\nseries of interminable inoculations and physical examinations, and with\r\nthe preliminary drilling. The days left him desperately tired. He had\r\nbeen issued the wrong size shoes by a popular, easy-going\r\nsupply-sergeant, and in consequence his feet were so swollen that the\r\nlast hours of the afternoon were an acute torture. For the first time in\r\nhis life he could throw himself down on his cot between dinner and\r\nafternoon drill-call, and seeming to sink with each moment deeper into a\r\nbottomless bed, drop off immediately to sleep, while the noise and\r\nlaughter around him faded to a pleasant drone of drowsy summer sound. In\r\nthe morning he awoke stiff and aching, hollow as a ghost, and hurried\r\nforth to meet the other ghostly figures who swarmed in the wan company\r\nstreets, while a harsh bugle shrieked and spluttered at the\r\ngray heavens.\r\n\r\nHe was in a skeleton infantry company of about a hundred men. After the\r\ninvariable breakfast of fatty bacon, cold toast, and cereal, the entire\r\nhundred would rush for the latrines, which, however well-policed, seemed\r\nalways intolerable, like the lavatories in cheap hotels. Out on the\r\nfield, then, in ragged order--the lame man on his left grotesquely\r\nmarring Anthony\'s listless efforts to keep in step, the platoon\r\nsergeants either showing off violently to impress the officers and\r\nrecruits, or else quietly lurking in close to the line of march,\r\navoiding both labor and unnecessary visibility.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the field, work began immediately--they peeled off\r\ntheir shirts for calisthenics. This was the only part of the day that\r\nAnthony enjoyed. Lieutenant Kretching, who presided at the antics, was\r\nsinewy and muscular, and Anthony, followed his movements faithfully,\r\nwith a feeling that he was doing something of positive value to himself.\r\nThe other officers and sergeants walked about among the men with the\r\nmalice of schoolboys, grouping here and there around some unfortunate\r\nwho lacked muscular control, giving him confused instructions and\r\ncommands. When they discovered a particularly forlorn, ill-nourished\r\nspecimen, they would linger the full half-hour making cutting remarks\r\nand snickering among themselves.\r\n\r\nOne little officer named Hopkins, who had been a sergeant in the regular\r\narmy, was particularly annoying. He took the war as a gift of revenge\r\nfrom the high gods to himself, and the constant burden of his harangues\r\nwas that these rookies did not appreciate the full gravity and\r\nresponsibility of "the service." He considered that by a combination of\r\nforesight and dauntless efficiency he had raised himself to his current\r\nmagnificence. He aped the particular tyrannies of every officer under\r\nwhom he had served in times gone by. His frown was frozen on his\r\nbrow--before giving a private a pass to go to town he would ponderously\r\nweigh the effect of such an absence upon the company, the army, and the\r\nwelfare of the military profession the world over.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Kretching, blond, dull and phlegmatic, introduced Anthony\r\nponderously to the problems of attention, right face, about face, and at\r\nease. His principal defect was his forgetfulness. He often kept the\r\ncompany straining and aching at attention for five minutes while he\r\nstood out in front and explained a new movement--as a result only the men\r\nin the centre knew what it was all about--those on both flanks had been\r\ntoo emphatically impressed with the necessity of staring straight ahead.\r\n\r\nThe drill continued until noon. It consisted of stressing a succession\r\nof infinitely remote details, and though Anthony perceived that this was\r\nconsistent with the logic of war, it none the less irritated him. That\r\nthe same faulty blood-pressure which would have been indecent in an\r\nofficer did not interfere with the duties of a private was a\r\npreposterous incongruity. Sometimes, after listening to a sustained\r\ninvective concerned with a dull and, on the face of it, absurd subject\r\nknown as military "courtesy," he suspected that the dim purpose of the\r\nwar was to let the regular army officers--men with the mentality and\r\naspirations of schoolboys--have their fling with some real slaughter. He\r\nwas being grotesquely sacrificed to the twenty-year patience of\r\na Hopkins!\r\n\r\nOf his three tent-mates--a flat-faced, conscientious objector from\r\nTennessee, a big, scared Pole, and the disdainful Celt whom he had sat\r\nbeside on the train--the two former spent the evenings in writing\r\neternal letters home, while the Irishman sat in the tent door whistling\r\nover and over to himself half a dozen shrill and monotonous bird-calls.\r\nIt was rather to avoid an hour of their company than with any hope of\r\ndiversion that, when the quarantine was lifted at the end of the week,\r\nhe went into town. He caught one of the swarm of jitneys that overran\r\nthe camp each evening, and in half an hour was set down in front of the\r\nStonewall Hotel on the hot and drowsy main street.\r\n\r\nUnder the gathering twilight the town was unexpectedly attractive. The\r\nsidewalks were peopled by vividly dressed, overpainted girls, who\r\nchattered volubly in low, lazy voices, by dozens of taxi-drivers who\r\nassailed passing officers with "Take y\' anywheh, _Lieu_tenant," and by\r\nan intermittent procession of ragged, shuffling, subservient negroes.\r\nAnthony, loitering along through the warm dusk, felt for the first time\r\nin years the slow, erotic breath of the South, imminent in the hot\r\nsoftness of the air, in the pervasive lull, of thought and time.\r\n\r\nHe had gone about a block when he was arrested suddenly by a harsh\r\ncommand at his elbow.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you been taught to salute officers?"\r\n\r\nHe looked dumbly at the man who addressed him, a stout, black-haired\r\ncaptain, who fixed him menacingly with brown pop-eyes.\r\n\r\n"_Come to attention!_" The words were literally thundered. A few\r\npedestrians near by stopped and stared. A soft-eyed girl in a lilac\r\ndress tittered to her companion.\r\n\r\nAnthony came to attention.\r\n\r\n"What\'s your regiment and company?"\r\n\r\nAnthony told him.\r\n\r\n"After this when you pass an officer on the street you straighten up and\r\nsalute!"\r\n\r\n"All right!"\r\n\r\n"Say \'Yes, sir!\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nThe stout officer grunted, turned sharply, and marched down the street.\r\nAfter a moment Anthony moved on; the town was no longer indolent and\r\nexotic; the magic was suddenly gone out of the dusk. His eyes were\r\nturned precipitately inward upon the indignity of his position. He hated\r\nthat officer, every officer--life was unendurable.\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone half a block he realized that the girl in the lilac\r\ndress who had giggled at his discomfiture was walking with her friend\r\nabout ten paces ahead of him. Several times she had turned and stared at\r\nAnthony, with cheerful laughter in the large eyes that seemed the same\r\ncolor as her gown.\r\n\r\nAt the corner she and her companion visibly slackened their pace--he\r\nmust make his choice between joining them and passing obliviously by. He\r\npassed, hesitated, then slowed down. In a moment the pair were abreast\r\nof him again, dissolved in laughter now--not such strident mirth as he\r\nwould have expected in the North from actresses in this familiar comedy,\r\nbut a soft, low rippling, like the overflow from some subtle joke, into\r\nwhich he had inadvertently blundered.\r\n\r\n"How do you do?" he said.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were soft as shadows. Were they violet, or was it their blue\r\ndarkness mingling with the gray hues of dusk?\r\n\r\n"Pleasant evening," ventured Anthony uncertainly.\r\n\r\n"Sure is," said the second girl.\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t been a very pleasant evening for you," sighed the girl in lilac.\r\nHer voice seemed as much a part of the night as the drowsy breeze\r\nstirring the wide brim of her hat.\r\n\r\n"He had to have a chance to show off," said Anthony with a scornful\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Reckon so," she agreed.\r\n\r\nThey turned the corner and moved lackadaisically up a side street, as if\r\nfollowing a drifting cable to which they were attached. In this town it\r\nseemed entirely natural to turn corners like that, it seemed natural to\r\nbe bound nowhere in particular, to be thinking nothing.... The side\r\nstreet was dark, a sudden offshoot into a district of wild rose hedges\r\nand little quiet houses set far back from the street.\r\n\r\n"Where\'re you going?" he inquired politely.\r\n\r\n"Just goin\'." The answer was an apology, a question, an explanation.\r\n\r\n"Can I stroll along with you?"\r\n\r\n"Reckon so."\r\n\r\nIt was an advantage that her accent was different. He could not have\r\ndetermined the social status of a Southerner from her talk--in New York\r\na girl of a lower class would have been raucous, unendurable--except\r\nthrough the rosy spectacles of intoxication.\r\n\r\nDark was creeping down. Talking little--Anthony in careless, casual\r\nquestions, the other two with provincial economy of phrase and\r\nburden--they sauntered past another corner, and another. In the middle\r\nof a block they stopped beneath a lamp-post.\r\n\r\n"I live near here," explained the other girl.\r\n\r\n"I live around the block," said the girl in lilac.\r\n\r\n"Can I see you home?"\r\n\r\n"To the corner, if you want to."\r\n\r\nThe other girl took a few steps backward. Anthony removed his hat.\r\n\r\n"You\'re supposed to salute," said the girl in lilac with a laugh. "All\r\nthe soldiers salute."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll learn," he responded soberly.\r\n\r\nThe other girl said, "Well--" hesitated, then added, "call me up\r\nto-morrow, Dot," and retreated from the yellow circle of the\r\nstreet-lamp. Then, in silence, Anthony and the girl in lilac walked the\r\nthree blocks to the small rickety house which was her home. Outside the\r\nwooden gate she hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Well--thanks."\r\n\r\n"Must you go in so soon?"\r\n\r\n"I ought to."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you stroll around a little longer?" She regarded him\r\ndispassionately.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t even know you."\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not too late."\r\n\r\n"I reckon I better go in."\r\n\r\n"I thought we might walk down and see a movie."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to."\r\n\r\n"Then I could bring you home. I\'d have just enough time. I\'ve got to be\r\nin camp by eleven."\r\n\r\nIt was so dark that he could scarcely see her now. She was a dress\r\nswayed infinitesimally by the wind, two limpid, reckless eyes ...\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come--Dot? Don\'t you like movies? Better come."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n"I oughtn\'t to."\r\n\r\nHe liked her, realizing that she was temporizing for the effect on him.\r\nHe came closer and took her hand.\r\n\r\n"If we get back by ten, can\'t you? just to the movies?"\r\n\r\n"Well--I reckon so--"\r\n\r\nHand in hand they walked back toward down-town, along a hazy, dusky\r\nstreet where a negro newsboy was calling an extra in the cadence of the\r\nlocal venders\' tradition, a cadence that was as musical as song.\r\n\r\n\r\nDot\r\n\r\nAnthony\'s affair with Dorothy Raycroft was an inevitable result of his\r\nincreasing carelessness about himself. He did not go to her desiring to\r\npossess the desirable, nor did he fall before a personality more vital,\r\nmore compelling than his own, as he had done with Gloria four years\r\nbefore. He merely slid into the matter through his inability to make\r\ndefinite judgments. He could say "No!" neither to man nor woman;\r\nborrower and temptress alike found him tender-minded and pliable. Indeed\r\nhe seldom made decisions at all, and when he did they were but\r\nhalf-hysterical resolves formed in the panic of some aghast and\r\nirreparable awakening.\r\n\r\nThe particular weakness he indulged on this occasion was his need of\r\nexcitement and stimulus from without. He felt that for the first time in\r\nfour years he could express and interpret himself anew. The girl\r\npromised rest; the hours in her company each evening alleviated the\r\nmorbid and inevitably futile poundings of his imagination. He had become\r\na coward in earnest--completely the slave of a hundred disordered and\r\nprowling thoughts which were released by the collapse of the authentic\r\ndevotion to Gloria that had been the chief jailer of his insufficiency.\r\n\r\nOn that first night, as they stood by the gate, he kissed Dorothy and\r\nmade an engagement to meet her the following Saturday. Then he went out\r\nto camp, and with the light burning lawlessly in his tent, he wrote a\r\nlong letter to Gloria, a glowing letter, full of the sentimental dark,\r\nfull of the remembered breath of flowers, full of a true and exceeding\r\ntenderness--these things he had learned again for a moment in a kiss\r\ngiven and taken under a rich warm moonlight just an hour before.\r\n\r\nWhen Saturday night came he found Dot waiting at the entrance of the\r\nBijou Moving Picture Theatre. She was dressed as on the preceding\r\nWednesday in her lilac gown of frailest organdy, but it had evidently\r\nbeen washed and starched since then, for it was fresh and unrumpled.\r\nDaylight confirmed the impression he had received that in a sketchy,\r\nfaulty way she was lovely. She was clean, her features were small,\r\nirregular, but eloquent and appropriate to each other. She was a dark,\r\nunenduring little flower--yet he thought he detected in her some quality\r\nof spiritual reticence, of strength drawn from her passive acceptance of\r\nall things. In this he was mistaken.\r\n\r\nDorothy Raycroft was nineteen. Her father had kept a small, unprosperous\r\ncorner store, and she had graduated from high school in the lowest\r\nfourth of her class two days before he died. At high school she had\r\nenjoyed a rather unsavory reputation. As a matter of fact her behavior\r\nat the class picnic, where the rumors started, had been merely\r\nindiscreet--she had retained her technical purity until over a year\r\nlater. The boy had been a clerk in a store on Jackson Street, and on the\r\nday after the incident he departed unexpectedly to New York. He had been\r\nintending to leave for some time, but had tarried for the consummation\r\nof his amorous enterprise.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she confided the adventure to a girl friend, and later, as\r\nshe watched her friend disappear down the sleepy street of dusty\r\nsunshine she knew in a flash of intuition that her story was going out\r\ninto the world. Yet after telling it she felt much better, and a little\r\nbitter, and made as near an approach to character as she was capable of\r\nby walking in another direction and meeting another man with the honest\r\nintention of gratifying herself again. As a rule things happened to Dot.\r\nShe was not weak, because there was nothing in her to tell her she was\r\nbeing weak. She was not strong, because she never knew that some of the\r\nthings she did were brave. She neither defied nor conformed nor\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\nShe had no sense of humor, but, to take its place, a happy disposition\r\nthat made her laugh at the proper times when she was with men. She had\r\nno definite intentions--sometimes she regretted vaguely that her\r\nreputation precluded what chance she had ever had for security. There\r\nhad been no open discovery: her mother was interested only in starting\r\nher off on time each morning for the jewelry store where she earned\r\nfourteen dollars a week. But some of the boys she had known in high\r\nschool now looked the other way when they were walking with "nice\r\ngirls," and these incidents hurt her feelings. When they occurred she\r\nwent home and cried.\r\n\r\nBesides the Jackson Street clerk there had been two other men, of whom\r\nthe first was a naval officer, who passed through town during the early\r\ndays of the war. He had stayed over a night to make a connection, and\r\nwas leaning idly against one of the pillars of the Stonewall Hotel when\r\nshe passed by. He remained in town four days. She thought she loved\r\nhim--lavished on him that first hysteria of passion that would have gone\r\nto the pusillanimous clerk. The naval officer\'s uniform--there were few\r\nof them in those days--had made the magic. He left with vague promises\r\non his lips, and, once on the train, rejoiced that he had not told her\r\nhis real name.\r\n\r\nHer resultant depression had thrown her into the arms of Cyrus Fielding,\r\nthe son of a local clothier, who had hailed her from his roadster one\r\nday as she passed along the sidewalk. She had always known him by name.\r\nHad she been born to a higher stratum he would have known her before.\r\nShe had descended a little lower--so he met her after all. After a month\r\nhe had gone away to training-camp, a little afraid of the intimacy, a\r\nlittle relieved in perceiving that she had not cared deeply for him, and\r\nthat she was not the sort who would ever make trouble. Dot romanticized\r\nthis affair and conceded to her vanity that the war had taken these men\r\naway from her. She told herself that she could have married the naval\r\nofficer. Nevertheless, it worried her that within eight months there had\r\nbeen three men in her life. She thought with more fear than wonder in\r\nher heart that she would soon be like those "bad girls" on Jackson\r\nStreet at whom she and her gum-chewing, giggling friends had stared with\r\nfascinated glances three years before.\r\n\r\nFor a while she attempted to be more careful. She let men "pick her up";\r\nshe let them kiss her, and even allowed certain other liberties to be\r\nforced upon her, but she did not add to her trio. After several months\r\nthe strength of her resolution--or rather the poignant expediency of her\r\nfears--was worn away. She grew restless drowsing there out of life and\r\ntime while the summer months faded. The soldiers she met were either\r\nobviously below her or, less obviously, above her--in which case they\r\ndesired only to use her; they were Yankees, harsh and ungracious; they\r\nswarmed in large crowds.... And then she met Anthony.\r\n\r\nOn that first evening he had been little more than a pleasantly unhappy\r\nface, a voice, the means with which to pass an hour, but when she kept\r\nher engagement with him on Saturday she regarded him with consideration.\r\nShe liked him. Unknowingly she saw her own tragedies mirrored in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nAgain they went to the movies, again they wandered along the shadowy,\r\nscented streets, hand in hand this time, speaking a little in hushed\r\nvoices. They passed through the gate--up toward the little porch--\r\n\r\n"I can stay a while, can\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Sh!" she whispered, "we\'ve got to be very quiet. Mother sits up reading\r\nSnappy Stories." In confirmation he heard the faint crackling inside as\r\na page was turned. The open-shutter slits emitted horizontal rods of\r\nlight that fell in thin parallels across Dorothy\'s skirt. The street was\r\nsilent save for a group on the steps of a house across the way, who,\r\nfrom time to time, raised their voices in a soft, bantering song.\r\n\r\n"--_When you wa-ake\r\nYou shall ha-ave\r\nAll the pretty little hawsiz_--"\r\n\r\nThen, as though it had been waiting on a near-by roof for their arrival,\r\nthe moon came slanting suddenly through the vines and turned the girl\'s\r\nface to the color of white roses.\r\n\r\nAnthony had a start of memory, so vivid that before his closed eyes\r\nthere formed a picture, distinct as a flashback on a screen--a spring\r\nnight of thaw set out of time in a half-forgotten winter five years\r\nbefore--another face, radiant, flower-like, upturned to lights as\r\ntransforming as the stars--\r\n\r\nAh, _la belle dame sans merci_ who lived in his heart, made known to him\r\nin transitory fading splendor by dark eyes in the Ritz-Carlton, by a\r\nshadowy glance from a passing carriage in the Bois de Boulogne! But\r\nthose nights were only part of a song, a remembered glory--here again\r\nwere the faint winds, the illusions, the eternal present with its\r\npromise of romance.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she whispered, "do you love me? Do you love me?"\r\n\r\nThe spell was broken--the drifted fragments of the stars became only\r\nlight, the singing down the street diminished to a monotone, to the\r\nwhimper of locusts in the grass. With almost a sigh he kissed her\r\nfervent mouth, while her arms crept up about his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN-AT-ARMS\r\n\r\nAs the weeks dried up and blew away, the range of Anthony\'s travels\r\nextended until he grew to comprehend the camp and its environment. For\r\nthe first time in his life he was in constant personal contact with the\r\nwaiters to whom he had given tips, the chauffeurs who had touched their\r\nhats to him, the carpenters, plumbers, barbers, and farmers who had\r\npreviously been remarkable only in the subservience of their\r\nprofessional genuflections. During his first two months in camp he did\r\nnot hold ten minutes\' consecutive conversation with a single man.\r\n\r\nOn the service record his occupation stood as "student"; on the original\r\nquestionnaire he had prematurely written "author"; but when men in his\r\ncompany asked his business he commonly gave it as bank clerk--had he\r\ntold the truth, that he did no work, they would have been suspicious of\r\nhim as a member of the leisure class.\r\n\r\nHis platoon sergeant, Pop Donnelly, was a scraggly "old soldier," worn\r\nthin with drink. In the past he had spent unnumbered weeks in the\r\nguard-house, but recently, thanks to the drill-master famine, he had\r\nbeen elevated to his present pinnacle. His complexion was full of\r\nshell-holes--it bore an unmistakable resemblance to those aerial\r\nphotographs of "the battle-field at Blank." Once a week he got drunk\r\ndown-town on white liquor, returned quietly to camp and collapsed upon\r\nhis bunk, joining the company at reveille looking more than ever like a\r\nwhite mask of death.\r\n\r\nHe nursed the astounding delusion that he was astutely "slipping it\r\nover" on the government--he had spent eighteen years in its service at a\r\nminute wage, and he was soon to retire (here he usually winked) on the\r\nimpressive income of fifty-five dollars a month. He looked upon it as a\r\ngorgeous joke that he had played upon the dozens who had bullied and\r\nscorned him since he was a Georgia country boy of nineteen.\r\n\r\nAt present there were but two lieutenants--Hopkins and the popular\r\nKretching. The latter was considered a good fellow and a fine leader,\r\nuntil a year later, when he disappeared with a mess fund of eleven\r\nhundred dollars and, like so many leaders, proved exceedingly difficult\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\nEventually there was Captain Dunning, god of this brief but\r\nself-sufficing microcosm. He was a reserve officer, nervous, energetic,\r\nand enthusiastic. This latter quality, indeed, often took material form\r\nand was visible as fine froth in the corners of his mouth. Like most\r\nexecutives he saw his charges strictly from the front, and to his\r\nhopeful eyes his command seemed just such an excellent unit as such an\r\nexcellent war deserved. For all his anxiety and absorption he was having\r\nthe time of his life.\r\n\r\nBaptiste, the little Sicilian of the train, fell foul of him the second\r\nweek of drill. The captain had several times ordered the men to be\r\nclean-shaven when they fell in each morning. One day there was disclosed\r\nan alarming breech of this rule, surely a case of Teutonic\r\nconnivance--during the night four men had grown hair upon their faces.\r\nThe fact that three of the four understood a minimum of English made a\r\npractical object-lesson only the more necessary, so Captain Dunning\r\nresolutely sent a volunteer barber back to the company street for a\r\nrazor. Whereupon for the safety of democracy a half-ounce of hair was\r\nscraped dry from the cheeks of three Italians and one Pole.\r\n\r\nOutside the world of the company there appeared, from time to time, the\r\ncolonel, a heavy man with snarling teeth, who circumnavigated the\r\nbattalion drill-field upon a handsome black horse. He was a West\r\nPointer, and, mimetically, a gentleman. He had a dowdy wife and a dowdy\r\nmind, and spent much of his time in town taking advantage of the army\'s\r\nlately exalted social position. Last of all was the general, who\r\ntraversed the roads of the camp preceded by his flag--a figure so\r\naustere, so removed, so magnificent, as to be scarcely comprehensible.\r\n\r\nDecember. Cool winds at night now, and damp, chilly mornings on the\r\ndrill-grounds. As the heat faded, Anthony found himself increasingly\r\nglad to be alive. Renewed strangely through his body, he worried little\r\nand existed in the present with a sort of animal content. It was not\r\nthat Gloria or the life that Gloria represented was less often in his\r\nthoughts--it was simply that she became, day by day, less real, less\r\nvivid. For a week they had corresponded passionately, almost\r\nhysterically--then by an unwritten agreement they had ceased to write\r\nmore than twice, and then once, a week. She was bored, she said; if his\r\nbrigade was to be there a long time she was coming down to join him. Mr.\r\nHaight was going to be able to submit a stronger brief than he had\r\nexpected, but doubted that the appealed case would come up until late\r\nspring. Muriel was in the city doing Red Cross work, and they went out\r\ntogether rather often. What would Anthony think if _she_ went into the\r\nRed Cross? Trouble was she had heard that she might have to bathe\r\nnegroes in alcohol, and after that she hadn\'t felt so patriotic. The\r\ncity was full of soldiers and she\'d seen a lot of boys she hadn\'t laid\r\neyes on for years....\r\n\r\nAnthony did not want her to come South. He told himself that this was\r\nfor many reasons--he needed a rest from her and she from him. She would\r\nbe bored beyond measure in town, and she would be able to see Anthony\r\nfor only a few hours each day. But in his heart he feared that it was\r\nbecause he was attracted to Dorothy. As a matter of fact he lived in\r\nterror that Gloria should learn by some chance or intention of the\r\nrelation he had formed. By the end of a fortnight the entanglement began\r\nto give him moments of misery at his own faithlessness. Nevertheless, as\r\neach day ended he was unable to withstand the lure that would draw him\r\nirresistibly out of his tent and over to the telephone at the Y.M.C.A.\r\n\r\n"Dot."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"I may be able to get in to-night."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to listen to my splendid eloquence for a few starry hours?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you funny--" For an instant he had a memory of five years\r\nbefore--of Geraldine. Then--\r\n\r\n"I\'ll arrive about eight."\r\n\r\nAt seven he would be in a jitney bound for the city, where hundreds of\r\nlittle Southern girls were waiting on moonlit porches for their lovers.\r\nHe would be excited already for her warm retarded kisses, for the amazed\r\nquietude of the glances she gave him--glances nearer to worship than any\r\nhe had ever inspired. Gloria and he had been equals, giving without\r\nthought of thanks or obligation. To this girl his very caresses were an\r\ninestimable boon. Crying quietly she had confessed to him that he was\r\nnot the first man in her life; there had been one other--he gathered\r\nthat the affair had no sooner commenced than it had been over.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so far as she was concerned, she spoke the truth. She had\r\nforgotten the clerk, the naval officer, the clothier\'s son, forgotten\r\nher vividness of emotion, which is true forgetting. She knew that in\r\nsome opaque and shadowy existence some one had taken her--it was as\r\nthough it had occurred in sleep.\r\n\r\nAlmost every night Anthony came to town. It was too cool now for the\r\nporch, so her mother surrendered to them the tiny sitting room, with its\r\ndozens of cheaply framed chromos, its yard upon yard of decorative\r\nfringe, and its thick atmosphere of several decades in the proximity of\r\nthe kitchen. They would build a fire--then, happily, inexhaustibly, she\r\nwould go about the business of love. Each evening at ten she would walk\r\nwith him to the door, her black hair in disarray, her face pale without\r\ncosmetics, paler still under the whiteness of the moon. As a rule it\r\nwould be bright and silver outside; now and then there was a slow warm\r\nrain, too indolent, almost, to reach the ground.\r\n\r\n"Say you love me," she would whisper.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course, you sweet baby."\r\n\r\n"Am I a baby?" This almost wistfully.\r\n\r\n"Just a little baby."\r\n\r\nShe knew vaguely of Gloria. It gave her pain to think of it, so she\r\nimagined her to be haughty and proud and cold. She had decided that\r\nGloria must be older than Anthony, and that there was no love between\r\nhusband and wife. Sometimes she let herself dream that after the war\r\nAnthony would get a divorce and they would be married--but she never\r\nmentioned this to Anthony, she scarcely knew why. She shared his\r\ncompany\'s idea that he was a sort of bank clerk--she thought that he was\r\nrespectable and poor. She would say:\r\n\r\n"If I had some money, darlin\', I\'d give ev\'y bit of it to you.... I\'d\r\nlike to have about fifty thousand dollars."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that\'d be plenty," agreed Anthony.\r\n\r\n--In her letter that day Gloria had written: "I suppose if we _could_\r\nsettle for a million it would be better to tell Mr. Haight to go ahead\r\nand settle. But it\'d seem a pity...."\r\n\r\n... "We could have an automobile," exclaimed Dot, in a final burst of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPRESSIVE OCCASION\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning prided himself on being a great reader of character.\r\nHalf an hour after meeting a man he was accustomed to place him in one\r\nof a number of astonishing categories--fine man, good man, smart fellow,\r\ntheorizer, poet, and "worthless." One day early in February he caused\r\nAnthony to be summoned to his presence in the orderly tent.\r\n\r\n"Patch," he said sententiously, "I\'ve had my eye on you for several\r\nweeks."\r\n\r\nAnthony stood erect and motionless.\r\n\r\n"And I think you\'ve got the makings of a good soldier."\r\n\r\nHe waited for the warm glow, which this would naturally arouse, to\r\ncool--and then continued:\r\n\r\n"This is no child\'s play," he said, narrowing his brows.\r\n\r\nAnthony agreed with a melancholy "No, sir."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a man\'s game--and we need leaders." Then the climax, swift, sure,\r\nand electric: "Patch, I\'m going to make you a corporal."\r\n\r\nAt this point Anthony should have staggered slightly backward,\r\noverwhelmed. He was to be one of the quarter million selected for that\r\nconsummate trust. He was going to be able to shout the technical phrase,\r\n"Follow me!" to seven other frightened men.\r\n\r\n"You seem to be a man of some education," said Captain Dunning.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good, that\'s good. Education\'s a great thing, but don\'t let it\r\ngo to your head. Keep on the way you\'re doing and you\'ll be a\r\ngood soldier."\r\n\r\nWith these parting words lingering in his ears, Corporal Patch saluted,\r\nexecuted a right about face, and left the tent.\r\n\r\nThough the conversation amused Anthony, it did generate the idea that\r\nlife would be more amusing as a sergeant or, should he find a less\r\nexacting medical examiner, as an officer. He was little interested in\r\nthe work, which seemed to belie the army\'s boasted gallantry. At the\r\ninspections one did not dress up to look well, one dressed up to keep\r\nfrom looking badly.\r\n\r\nBut as winter wore away--the short, snowless winter marked by damp\r\nnights and cool, rainy days--he marvelled at how quickly the system had\r\ngrasped him. He was a soldier--all who were not soldiers were civilians.\r\nThe world was divided primarily into those two classifications.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that all strongly accentuated classes, such as the\r\nmilitary, divided men into two kinds: their own kind--and those without.\r\nTo the clergyman there were clergy and laity, to the Catholic there were\r\nCatholics and non-Catholics, to the negro there were blacks and whites,\r\nto the prisoner there were the imprisoned and the free, and to the sick\r\nman there were the sick and the well.... So, without thinking of it once\r\nin his lifetime, he had been a civilian, a layman, a non-Catholic, a\r\nGentile, white, free, and well....\r\n\r\nAs the American troops were poured into the French and British trenches\r\nhe began to find the names of many Harvard men among the casualties\r\nrecorded in the Army and Navy Journal. But for all the sweat and blood\r\nthe situation appeared unchanged, and he saw no prospect of the war\'s\r\nending in the perceptible future. In the old chronicles the right wing\r\nof one army always defeated the left wing of the other, the left wing\r\nbeing, meanwhile, vanquished by the enemy\'s right. After that the\r\nmercenaries fled. It had been so simple, in those days, almost as if\r\nprearranged....\r\n\r\nGloria wrote that she was reading a great deal. What a mess they had\r\nmade of their affairs, she said. She had so little to do now that she\r\nspent her time imagining how differently things might have turned out.\r\nHer whole environment appeared insecure--and a few years back she had\r\nseemed to hold all the strings in her own little hand....\r\n\r\nIn June her letters grew hurried and less frequent. She suddenly ceased\r\nto write about coming South.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFEAT\r\n\r\nMarch in the country around was rare with jasmine and jonquils and\r\npatches of violets in the warming grass. Afterward he remembered\r\nespecially one afternoon of such a fresh and magic glamour that as he\r\nstood in the rifle-pit marking targets he recited "Atalanta in Calydon"\r\nto an uncomprehending Pole, his voice mingling with the rip, sing, and\r\nsplatter of the bullets overhead.\r\n\r\n"When the hounds of spring ..."\r\n\r\n_Spang!_\r\n\r\n"Are on winter\'s traces ..."\r\n\r\n_Whirr-r-r-r!_ ...\r\n\r\n"The mother of months ..."\r\n\r\n_"Hey!_ Come to! Mark three-e-e! ..."\r\n\r\nIn town the streets were in a sleepy dream again, and together Anthony\r\nand Dot idled in their own tracks of the previous autumn until he began\r\nto feel a drowsy attachment for this South--a South, it seemed, more of\r\nAlgiers than of Italy, with faded aspirations pointing back over\r\ninnumerable generations to some warm, primitive Nirvana, without hope or\r\ncare. Here there was an inflection of cordiality, of comprehension, in\r\nevery voice. "Life plays the same lovely and agonizing joke on all of\r\nus," they seemed to say in their plaintive pleasant cadence, in the\r\nrising inflection terminating on an unresolved minor.\r\n\r\nHe liked his barber shop where he was "Hi, corporal!" to a pale,\r\nemaciated young man, who shaved him and pushed a cool vibrating machine\r\nendlessly over his insatiable head. He liked "Johnston\'s Gardens" where\r\nthey danced, where a tragic negro made yearning, aching music on a\r\nsaxophone until the garish hall became an enchanted jungle of barbaric\r\nrhythms and smoky laughter, where to forget the uneventful passage of\r\ntime upon Dorothy\'s soft sighs and tender whisperings was the\r\nconsummation of all aspiration, of all content.\r\n\r\nThere was an undertone of sadness in her character, a conscious evasion\r\nof all except the pleasurable minutiae of life. Her violet eyes would\r\nremain for hours apparently insensate as, thoughtless and reckless, she\r\nbasked like a cat in the sun. He wondered what the tired, spiritless\r\nmother thought of them, and whether in her moments of uttermost cynicism\r\nshe ever guessed at their relationship.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoons they walked along the countryside, resting at\r\nintervals on the dry moss in the outskirts of a wood. Here the birds had\r\ngathered and the clusters of violets and white dogwood; here the hoar\r\ntrees shone crystalline and cool, oblivious to the intoxicating heat\r\nthat waited outside; here he would talk, intermittently, in a sleepy\r\nmonologue, in a conversation of no significance, of no replies.\r\n\r\nJuly came scorching down. Captain Dunning was ordered to detail one of\r\nhis men to learn blacksmithing. The regiment was filling up to war\r\nstrength, and he needed most of his veterans for drill-masters, so he\r\nselected the little Italian, Baptiste, whom he could most easily spare.\r\nLittle Baptiste had never had anything to do with horses. His fear made\r\nmatters worse. He reappeared in the orderly room one day and told\r\nCaptain Dunning that he wanted to die if he couldn\'t be relieved. The\r\nhorses kicked at him, he said; he was no good at the work. Finally he\r\nfell on his knees and besought Captain Dunning, in a mixture of broken\r\nEnglish and scriptural Italian, to get him out of it. He had not slept\r\nfor three days; monstrous stallions reared and cavorted through\r\nhis dreams.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning reproved the company clerk (who had burst out laughing),\r\nand told Baptiste he would do what he could. But when he thought it over\r\nhe decided that he couldn\'t spare a better man. Little Baptiste went\r\nfrom bad to worse. The horses seemed to divine his fear and take every\r\nadvantage of it. Two weeks later a great black mare crushed his skull in\r\nwith her hoofs while he was trying to lead her from her stall.\r\n\r\nIn mid-July came rumors, and then orders, that concerned a change of\r\ncamp. The brigade was to move to an empty cantonment, a hundred miles\r\nfarther south, there to be expanded into a division. At first the men\r\nthought they were departing for the trenches, and all evening little\r\ngroups jabbered in the company street, shouting to each other in\r\nswaggering exclamations: "Su-u-ure we are!" When the truth leaked out,\r\nit was rejected indignantly as a blind to conceal their real\r\ndestination. They revelled in their own importance. That night they told\r\ntheir girls in town that they were "going to get the Germans." Anthony\r\ncirculated for a while among the groups--then, stopping a jitney, rode\r\ndown to tell Dot that he was going away.\r\n\r\nShe was waiting on the dark veranda in a cheap white dress that\r\naccentuated the youth and softness of her face.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she whispered, "I\'ve wanted you so, honey. All this day."\r\n\r\n"I have something to tell you."\r\n\r\nShe drew him down beside her on the swinging seat, not noticing his\r\nominous tone.\r\n\r\n"Tell me."\r\n\r\n"We\'re leaving next week."\r\n\r\nHer arms seeking his shoulders remained poised upon the dark air, her\r\nchin tipped up. When she spoke the softness was gone from her voice.\r\n\r\n"Leaving for France?"\r\n\r\n"No. Less luck than that. Leaving for some darn camp in Mississippi."\r\n\r\nShe shut her eyes and he could see that the lids were trembling.\r\n\r\n"Dear little Dot, life is so damned hard."\r\n\r\nShe was crying upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"So damned hard, so damned hard," he repeated aimlessly; "it just hurts\r\npeople and hurts people, until finally it hurts them so that they can\'t\r\nbe hurt ever any more. That\'s the last and worst thing it does."\r\n\r\nFrantic, wild with anguish, she strained him to her breast.\r\n\r\n"Oh, God!" she whispered brokenly, "you can\'t go way from me. I\'d die."\r\n\r\nHe was finding it impossible to pass off his departure as a common,\r\nimpersonal blow. He was too near to her to do more than repeat "Poor\r\nlittle Dot. Poor little Dot."\r\n\r\n"And then what?" she demanded wearily.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re my whole life, that\'s all. I\'d die for you right now if you said\r\nso. I\'d get a knife and kill myself. You can\'t leave me here."\r\n\r\nHer tone frightened him.\r\n\r\n"These things happen," he said evenly.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m going with you." Tears were streaming down her checks. Her\r\nmouth was trembling in an ecstasy of grief and fear.\r\n\r\n"Sweet," he muttered sentimentally, "sweet little girl. Don\'t you see\r\nwe\'d just be putting off what\'s bound to happen? I\'ll be going to France\r\nin a few months--"\r\n\r\nShe leaned away from him and clinching her fists lifted her face toward\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n"I want to die," she said, as if moulding each word carefully in her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"Dot," he whispered uncomfortably, "you\'ll forget. Things are sweeter\r\nwhen they\'re lost. I know--because once I wanted something and got it.\r\nIt was the only thing I ever wanted badly, Dot. And when I got it it\r\nturned to dust in my hands."\r\n\r\n"All right."\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in himself, he continued:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve often thought that if I hadn\'t got what I wanted things might have\r\nbeen different with me. I might have found something in my mind and\r\nenjoyed putting it in circulation. I might have been content with the\r\nwork of it, and had some sweet vanity out of the success. I suppose that\r\nat one time I could have had anything I wanted, within reason, but that\r\nwas the only thing I ever wanted with any fervor. God! And that taught\r\nme you can\'t have _any_thing, you can\'t have anything at _all_. Because\r\ndesire just cheats you. It\'s like a sunbeam skipping here and there\r\nabout a room. It stops and gilds some inconsequential object, and we\r\npoor fools try to grasp it--but when we do the sunbeam moves on to\r\nsomething else, and you\'ve got the inconsequential part, but the glitter\r\nthat made you want it is gone--" He broke off uneasily. She had risen\r\nand was standing, dry-eyed, picking little leaves from a dark vine.\r\n\r\n"Dot--"\r\n\r\n"Go way," she said coldly. "What? Why?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want just words. If that\'s all you have for me you\'d better\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"Why, Dot--"\r\n\r\n"What\'s death to me is just a lot of words to you. You put \'em together\r\nso pretty."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry. I was talking about you, Dot."\r\n\r\n"Go way from here."\r\n\r\nHe approached her with arms outstretched, but she held him away.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want me to go with you," she said evenly; "maybe you\'re going\r\nto meet that--that girl--" She could not bring herself to say wife. "How\r\ndo I know? Well, then, I reckon you\'re not my fellow any more. So\r\ngo way."\r\n\r\nFor a moment, while conflicting warnings and desires prompted Anthony,\r\nit seemed one of those rare times when he would take a step prompted\r\nfrom within. He hesitated. Then a wave of weariness broke against him.\r\nIt was too late--everything was too late. For years now he had dreamed\r\nthe world away, basing his decisions upon emotions unstable as water.\r\nThe little girl in the white dress dominated him, as she approached\r\nbeauty in the hard symmetry of her desire. The fire blazing in her dark\r\nand injured heart seemed to glow around her like a flame. With some\r\nprofound and uncharted pride she had made herself remote and so achieved\r\nher purpose.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t--mean to seem so callous, Dot."\r\n\r\n"It don\'t matter."\r\n\r\nThe fire rolled over Anthony. Something wrenched at his bowels, and he\r\nstood there helpless and beaten.\r\n\r\n"Come with me, Dot--little loving Dot. Oh, come with me. I couldn\'t\r\nleave you now--"\r\n\r\nWith a sob she wound her arms around him and let him support her weight\r\nwhile the moon, at its perennial labor of covering the bad complexion of\r\nthe world, showered its illicit honey over the drowsy street.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATASTROPHE\r\n\r\nEarly September in Camp Boone, Mississippi. The darkness, alive with\r\ninsects, beat in upon the mosquito-netting, beneath the shelter of which\r\nAnthony was trying to write a letter. An intermittent chatter over a\r\npoker game was going on in the next tent, and outside a man was\r\nstrolling up the company street singing a current bit of doggerel about\r\n"K-K-K-Katy."\r\n\r\nWith an effort Anthony hoisted himself to his elbow and, pencil in hand,\r\nlooked down at his blank sheet of paper. Then, omitting any heading,\r\nhe began:\r\n\r\n_I can\'t imagine what the matter is, Gloria. I haven\'t had a line from\r\nyou for two weeks and it\'s only natural to be worried--_\r\n\r\nHe threw this away with a disturbed grunt and began again:\r\n\r\n_I don\'t know what to think, Gloria. Your last letter, short, cold,\r\nwithout a word of affection or even a decent account of what you\'ve been\r\ndoing, came two weeks ago. It\'s only natural that I should wonder. If\r\nyour love for me isn\'t absolutely dead it seems that you\'d at least keep\r\nme from worry--_\r\n\r\nAgain he crumpled the page and tossed it angrily through a tear in the\r\ntent wall, realizing simultaneously that he would have to pick it up in\r\nthe morning. He felt disinclined to try again. He could get no warmth\r\ninto the lines--only a persistent jealousy and suspicion. Since\r\nmidsummer these discrepancies in Gloria\'s correspondence had grown more\r\nand more noticeable. At first he had scarcely perceived them. He was so\r\ninured to the perfunctory "dearest" and "darlings" scattered through her\r\nletters that he was oblivious to their presence or absence. But in this\r\nlast fortnight he had become increasingly aware that there was\r\nsomething amiss.\r\n\r\nHe had sent her a night-letter saying that he had passed his\r\nexaminations for an officers\' training-camp, and expected to leave for\r\nGeorgia shortly. She had not answered. He had wired again--when he\r\nreceived no word he imagined that she might be out of town. But it\r\noccurred and recurred to him that she was not out of town, and a series\r\nof distraught imaginings began to plague him. Supposing Gloria, bored\r\nand restless, had found some one, even as he had. The thought terrified\r\nhim with its possibility--it was chiefly because he had been so sure of\r\nher personal integrity that he had considered her so sparingly during\r\nthe year. And now, as a doubt was born, the old angers, the rages of\r\npossession, swarmed back a thousandfold. What more natural than that she\r\nshould be in love again?\r\n\r\nHe remembered the Gloria who promised that should she ever want\r\nanything, she would take it, insisting that since she would act entirely\r\nfor her own satisfaction she could go through such an affair\r\nunsmirched--it was only the effect on a person\'s mind that counted,\r\nanyhow, she said, and her reaction would be the masculine one, of\r\nsatiation and faint dislike.\r\n\r\nBut that had been when they were first married. Later, with the\r\ndiscovery that she could be jealous of Anthony, she had, outwardly at\r\nleast, changed her mind. There were no other men in the world for her.\r\nThis he had known only too surely. Perceiving that a certain\r\nfastidiousness would restrain her, he had grown lax in preserving the\r\ncompleteness of her love--which, after all, was the keystone of the\r\nentire structure.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all through the summer he had been maintaining Dot in a\r\nboarding-house down-town. To do this it had been necessary to write to\r\nhis broker for money. Dot had covered her journey south by leaving her\r\nhouse a day before the brigade broke camp, informing her mother in a\r\nnote that she had gone to New York. On the evening following Anthony had\r\ncalled as though to see her. Mrs. Raycroft was in a state of collapse\r\nand there was a policeman in the parlor. A questionnaire had ensued,\r\nfrom which Anthony had extricated himself with some difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn September, with his suspicions of Gloria, the company of Dot had\r\nbecome tedious, then almost intolerable. He was nervous and irritable\r\nfrom lack of sleep; his heart was sick and afraid. Three days ago he had\r\ngone to Captain Dunning and asked for a furlough, only to be met with\r\nbenignant procrastination. The division was starting overseas, while\r\nAnthony was going to an officers\' training-camp; what furloughs could be\r\ngiven must go to the men who were leaving the country.\r\n\r\nUpon this refusal Anthony had started to the telegraph office intending\r\nto wire Gloria to come South--he reached the door and receded\r\ndespairingly, seeing the utter impracticability of such a move. Then he\r\nhad spent the evening quarrelling irritably with Dot, and returned to\r\ncamp morose and angry with the world. There had been a disagreeable\r\nscene, in the midst of which he had precipitately departed. What was to\r\nbe done with her did not seem to concern him vitally at present--he was\r\ncompletely absorbed in the disheartening silence of his wife....\r\n\r\nThe flap of the tent made a sudden triangle back upon itself, and a dark\r\nhead appeared against the night.\r\n\r\n"Sergeant Patch?" The accent was Italian, and Anthony saw by the belt\r\nthat the man was a headquarters orderly.\r\n\r\n"Want me?"\r\n\r\n"Lady call up headquarters ten minutes ago. Say she have speak with you.\r\nVer\' important."\r\n\r\nAnthony swept aside the mosquito-netting and stood up. It might be a\r\nwire from Gloria telephoned over.\r\n\r\n"She say to get you. She call again ten o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"All right, thanks." He picked up his hat and in a moment was striding\r\nbeside the orderly through the hot, almost suffocating, darkness. Over\r\nin the headquarters shack he saluted a dozing night-service officer.\r\n\r\n"Sit down and wait," suggested the lieutenant nonchalantly. "Girl seemed\r\nawful anxious to speak to you."\r\n\r\nAnthony\'s hopes fell away.\r\n\r\n"Thank you very much, sir." And as the phone squeaked on the side-wall\r\nhe knew who was calling.\r\n\r\n"This is Dot," came an unsteady voice, "I\'ve got to see you."\r\n\r\n"Dot, I told you I couldn\'t get down for several days."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to see you to-night. It\'s important."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late," he said coldly; "it\'s ten o\'clock, and I have to be in\r\ncamp at eleven."\r\n\r\n"All right." There was so much wretchedness compressed into the two\r\nwords that Anthony felt a measure of compunction.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I want to tell you good-by.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be a little idiot!" he exclaimed. But his spirits rose. What\r\nluck if she should leave town this very night! What a burden from his\r\nsoul. But he said: "You can\'t possibly leave before to-morrow."\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of his eye he saw the night-service officer regarding\r\nhim quizzically. Then, startlingly, came Dot\'s next words:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean \'leave\' that way."\r\n\r\nAnthony\'s hand clutched the receiver fiercely. He felt his nerves\r\nturning cold as if the heat was leaving his body.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\nThen quickly in a wild broken voice he heard:\r\n\r\n"Good-by--oh, good-by!"\r\n\r\nCul-_lup!_ She had hung up the receiver. With a sound that was half a\r\ngasp, half a cry, Anthony hurried from the headquarters building.\r\nOutside, under the stars that dripped like silver tassels through the\r\ntrees of the little grove, he stood motionless, hesitating. Had she\r\nmeant to kill herself?--oh, the little fool! He was filled with bitter\r\nhate toward her. In this denouement he found it impossible to realize\r\nthat he had ever begun such an entanglement, such a mess, a sordid\r\nmelange of worry and pain.\r\n\r\nHe found himself walking slowly away, repeating over and over that it\r\nwas futile to worry. He had best go back to his tent and sleep. He\r\nneeded sleep. God! Would he ever sleep again? His mind was in a vast\r\nclamor and confusion; as he reached the road he turned around in a panic\r\nand began running, not toward his company but away from it. Men were\r\nreturning now--he could find a taxicab. After a minute two yellow eyes\r\nappeared around a bend. Desperately he ran toward them.\r\n\r\n"Jitney! Jitney!" ... It was an empty Ford.... "I want to go to town."\r\n\r\n"Cost you a dollar."\r\n\r\n"All right. If you\'ll just hurry--"\r\n\r\nAfter an interminable time he ran up the steps of a dark ramshackle\r\nlittle house, and through the door, almost knocking over an immense\r\nnegress who was walking, candle in hand, along the hall.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s my wife?" he cried wildly.\r\n\r\n"She gone to bed."\r\n\r\nUp the stairs three at a time, down the creaking passage. The room was\r\ndark and silent, and with trembling fingers he struck a match. Two wide\r\neyes looked up at him from a wretched ball of clothes on the bed.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I knew you\'d come," she murmured brokenly.\r\n\r\nAnthony grew cold with anger.\r\n\r\n"So it was just a plan to get me down here, get me in trouble!" he said.\r\n"God damn it, you\'ve shouted \'wolf\' once too often!"\r\n\r\nShe regarded him pitifully.\r\n\r\n"I had to see you. I couldn\'t have lived. Oh, I had to see you--"\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the side of the bed and slowly shook his head.\r\n\r\n"You\'re no good," he said decisively, talking unconsciously as Gloria\r\nmight have talked to him. "This sort of thing isn\'t fair to me,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Come closer." Whatever he might say Dot was happy now. He cared for\r\nher. She had brought him to her side.\r\n\r\n"Oh, God," said Anthony hopelessly. As weariness rolled along its\r\ninevitable wave his anger subsided, receded, vanished. He collapsed\r\nsuddenly, fell sobbing beside her on the bed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling," she begged him, "don\'t cry! Oh, don\'t cry!"\r\n\r\nShe took his head upon her breast and soothed him, mingled her happy\r\ntears with the bitterness of his. Her hand played gently with his\r\ndark hair.\r\n\r\n"I\'m such a little fool," she murmured brokenly, "but I love you, and\r\nwhen you\'re cold to me it seems as if it isn\'t worth while to go\r\non livin\'."\r\n\r\nAfter all, this was peace--the quiet room with the mingled scent of\r\nwomen\'s powder and perfume, Dot\'s hand soft as a warm wind upon his\r\nhair, the rise and fall of her bosom as she took breath--for a moment it\r\nwas as though it were Gloria there, as though he were at rest in some\r\nsweeter and safer home than he had ever known.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. A clock began to chime in the hall. He jumped to his\r\nfeet and looked at the phosphorescent hands of his wrist watch. It was\r\ntwelve o\'clock.\r\n\r\nHe had trouble in finding a taxi that would take him out at that hour.\r\nAs he urged the driver faster along the road he speculated on the best\r\nmethod of entering camp. He had been late several times recently, and he\r\nknew that were he caught again his name would probably be stricken from\r\nthe list of officer candidates. He wondered if he had not better dismiss\r\nthe taxi and take a chance on passing the sentry in the dark. Still,\r\nofficers often rode past the sentries after midnight....\r\n\r\n"Halt!" The monosyllable came from the yellow glare that the headlights\r\ndropped upon the changing road. The taxi-driver threw out his clutch and\r\na sentry walked up, carrying his rifle at the port. With him, by an ill\r\nchance, was the officer of the guard.\r\n\r\n"Out late, sergeant."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Got delayed."\r\n\r\n"Too bad. Have to take your name."\r\n\r\nAs the officer waited, note-book and pencil in hand, something not fully\r\nintended crowded to Anthony\'s lips, something born of panic, of muddle,\r\nof despair.\r\n\r\n"Sergeant R.A. Foley," he answered breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"And the outfit?"\r\n\r\n"Company Q, Eighty-third Infantry."\r\n\r\n"All right. You\'ll have to walk from here, sergeant."\r\n\r\nAnthony saluted, quickly paid his taxi-driver, and set off for a run\r\ntoward the regiment he had named. When he was out of sight he changed\r\nhis course, and with his heart beating wildly, hurried to his company,\r\nfeeling that he had made a fatal error of judgment.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the officer who had been in command of the guard\r\nrecognized him in a barber shop down-town. In charge of a military\r\npoliceman he was taken back to the camp, where he was reduced to the\r\nranks without trial, and confined for a month to the limits of his\r\ncompany street.\r\n\r\nWith this blow a spell of utter depression overtook him, and within a\r\nweek he was again caught down-town, wandering around in a drunken daze,\r\nwith a pint of bootleg whiskey in his hip pocket. It was because of a\r\nsort of craziness in his behavior at the trial that his sentence to the\r\nguard-house was for only three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHTMARE\r\n\r\nEarly in his confinement the conviction took root in him that he was\r\ngoing mad. It was as though there were a quantity of dark yet vivid\r\npersonalities in his mind, some of them familiar, some of them strange\r\nand terrible, held in check by a little monitor, who sat aloft somewhere\r\nand looked on. The thing that worried him was that the monitor was sick,\r\nand holding out with difficulty. Should he give up, should he falter for\r\na moment, out would rush these intolerable things--only Anthony could\r\nknow what a state of blackness there would be if the worst of him could\r\nroam his consciousness unchecked.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the day had changed, somehow, until it was a burnished\r\ndarkness crushing down upon a devastated land. Over his head the blue\r\ncircles of ominous uncharted suns, of unnumbered centres of fire,\r\nrevolved interminably before his eyes as though he were lying constantly\r\nexposed to the hot light and in a state of feverish coma. At seven in\r\nthe morning something phantasmal, something almost absurdly unreal that\r\nhe knew was his mortal body, went out with seven other prisoners and two\r\nguards to work on the camp roads. One day they loaded and unloaded\r\nquantities of gravel, spread it, raked it--the next day they worked with\r\nhuge barrels of red-hot tar, flooding the gravel with black, shining\r\npools of molten heat. At night, locked up in the guard-house, he would\r\nlie without thought, without courage to compass thought, staring at the\r\nirregular beams of the ceiling overhead until about three o\'clock, when\r\nhe would slip into a broken, troubled sleep.\r\n\r\nDuring the work hours he labored with uneasy haste, attempting, as the\r\nday bore toward the sultry Mississippi sunset, to tire himself\r\nphysically so that in the evening he might sleep deeply from utter\r\nexhaustion.... Then one afternoon in the second week he had a feeling\r\nthat two eyes were watching him from a place a few feet beyond one of\r\nthe guards. This aroused him to a sort of terror. He turned his back on\r\nthe eyes and shovelled feverishly, until it became necessary for him to\r\nface about and go for more gravel. Then they entered his vision again,\r\nand his already taut nerves tightened up to the breaking-point. The eyes\r\nwere leering at him. Out of a hot silence he heard his name called in a\r\ntragic voice, and the earth tipped absurdly back and forth to a babel of\r\nshouting and confusion.\r\n\r\nWhen next he became conscious he was back in the guard-house, and the\r\nother prisoners were throwing him curious glances. The eyes returned no\r\nmore. It was many days before he realized that the voice must have been\r\nDot\'s, that she had called out to him and made some sort of disturbance.\r\nHe decided this just previous to the expiration of his sentence, when\r\nthe cloud that oppressed him had lifted, leaving him in a deep,\r\ndispirited lethargy. As the conscious mediator, the monitor who kept\r\nthat fearsome menage of horror, grew stronger, Anthony became physically\r\nweaker. He was scarcely able to get through the two days of toil, and\r\nwhen he was released, one rainy afternoon, and returned to his company,\r\nhe reached his tent only to fall into a heavy doze, from which he awoke\r\nbefore dawn, aching and unrefreshed. Beside his cot were two letters\r\nthat had been awaiting him in the orderly tent for some time. The first\r\nwas from Gloria; it was short and cool:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The case is coming to trial late in November. Can you possibly get\r\nleave?_\r\n\r\n_I\'ve tried to write you again and again but it just seems to make\r\nthings worse. I want to see you about several matters, but you know that\r\nyou have once prevented me from coming and I am disinclined to try\r\nagain. In view of a number of things it seems necessary that we have a\r\nconference. I\'m very glad about your appointment._\r\n\r\nGLORIA.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was too tired to try to understand--or to care. Her phrases, her\r\nintentions, were all very far away in an incomprehensible past. At the\r\nsecond letter he scarcely glanced; it was from Dot--an incoherent,\r\ntear-swollen scrawl, a flood of protest, endearment, and grief. After a\r\npage he let it slip from his inert hand and drowsed back into a nebulous\r\nhinterland of his own. At drill-call he awoke with a high fever and\r\nfainted when he tried to leave his tent--at noon he was sent to the base\r\nhospital with influenza.\r\n\r\nHe was aware that this sickness was providential. It saved him from a\r\nhysterical relapse--and he recovered in time to entrain on a damp\r\nNovember day for New York, and for the interminable massacre beyond.\r\n\r\nWhen the regiment reached Camp Mills, Long Island, Anthony\'s single idea\r\nwas to get into the city and see Gloria as soon as possible. It was now\r\nevident that an armistice would be signed within the week, but rumor had\r\nit that in any case troops would continue to be shipped to France until\r\nthe last moment. Anthony was appalled at the notion of the long voyage,\r\nof a tedious debarkation at a French port, and of being kept abroad for\r\na year, possibly, to replace the troops who had seen actual fighting.\r\n\r\nHis intention had been to obtain a two-day furlough, but Camp Mills\r\nproved to be under a strict influenza quarantine--it was impossible for\r\neven an officer to leave except on official business. For a private it\r\nwas out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe camp itself was a dreary muddle, cold, wind-swept, and filthy, with\r\nthe accumulated dirt incident to the passage through of many divisions.\r\nTheir train came in at seven one night, and they waited in line until\r\none while a military tangle was straightened out somewhere ahead.\r\nOfficers ran up and down ceaselessly, calling orders and making a great\r\nuproar. It turned out that the trouble was due to the colonel, who was\r\nin a righteous temper because he was a West Pointer, and the war was\r\ngoing to stop before he could get overseas. Had the militant governments\r\nrealized the number of broken hearts among the older West Pointers\r\nduring that week, they would indubitably have prolonged the slaughter\r\nanother month. The thing was pitiable!\r\n\r\nGazing out at the bleak expanse of tents extending for miles over a\r\ntrodden welter of slush and snow, Anthony saw the impracticability of\r\ntrudging to a telephone that night. He would call her at the first\r\nopportunity in the morning.\r\n\r\nAroused in the chill and bitter dawn he stood at reveille and listened\r\nto a passionate harangue from Captain Dunning:\r\n\r\n"You men may think the war is over. Well, let me tell you, it isn\'t!\r\nThose fellows aren\'t going to sign the armistice. It\'s another trick,\r\nand we\'d be crazy to let anything slacken up here in the company,\r\nbecause, let me tell you, we\'re going to sail from here within a week,\r\nand when we do we\'re going to see some real fighting." He paused that\r\nthey might get the full effect of his pronouncement. And then: "If you\r\nthink the war\'s over, just talk to any one who\'s been in it and see if\r\n_they_ think the Germans are all in. They don\'t. Nobody does. I\'ve\r\ntalked to the people that _know_, and they say there\'ll be, anyways, a\r\nyear longer of war. _They_ don\'t think it\'s over. So you men better not\r\nget any foolish ideas that it is."\r\n\r\nDoubly stressing this final admonition, he ordered the company\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nAt noon Anthony set off at a run for the nearest canteen telephone. As\r\nhe approached what corresponded to the down-town of the camp, he noticed\r\nthat many other soldiers were running also, that a man near him had\r\nsuddenly leaped into the air and clicked his heels together. The\r\ntendency to run became general, and from little excited groups here and\r\nthere came the sounds of cheering. He stopped and listened--over the\r\ncold country whistles were blowing and the chimes of the Garden City\r\nchurches broke suddenly into reverberatory sound.\r\n\r\nAnthony began to run again. The cries were clear and distinct now as\r\nthey rose with clouds of frosted breath into the chilly air:\r\n\r\n_"Germany\'s surrendered! Germany\'s surrendered!"_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALSE ARMISTICE\r\n\r\nThat evening in the opaque gloom of six o\'clock Anthony slipped between\r\ntwo freight-cars, and once over the railroad, followed the track along\r\nto Garden City, where he caught an electric train for New York. He stood\r\nsome chance of apprehension--he knew that the military police were often\r\nsent through the cars to ask for passes, but he imagined that to-night\r\nthe vigilance would be relaxed. But, in any event, he would have tried\r\nto slip through, for he had been unable to locate Gloria by telephone,\r\nand another day of suspense would have been intolerable.\r\n\r\nAfter inexplicable stops and waits that reminded him of the night he had\r\nleft New York, over a year before, they drew into the Pennsylvania\r\nStation, and he followed the familiar way to the taxi-stand, finding it\r\ngrotesque and oddly stimulating to give his own address.\r\n\r\nBroadway was a riot of light, thronged as he had never seen it with a\r\ncarnival crowd which swept its glittering way through scraps of paper,\r\npiled ankle-deep on the sidewalks. Here and there, elevated upon benches\r\nand boxes, soldiers addressed the heedless mass, each face in which was\r\nclear cut and distinct under the white glare overhead. Anthony picked\r\nout half a dozen figures--a drunken sailor, tipped backward and\r\nsupported by two other gobs, was waving his hat and emitting a wild\r\nseries of roars; a wounded soldier, crutch in hand, was borne along in\r\nan eddy on the shoulders of some shrieking civilians; a dark-haired girl\r\nsat cross-legged and meditative on top of a parked taxicab. Here surely\r\nthe victory had come in time, the climax had been scheduled with the\r\nuttermost celestial foresight. The great rich nation had made triumphant\r\nwar, suffered enough for poignancy but not enough for bitterness--hence\r\nthe carnival, the feasting, the triumph. Under these bright lights\r\nglittered the faces of peoples whose glory had long since passed away,\r\nwhose very civilizations were dead-men whose ancestors had heard the\r\nnews of victory in Babylon, in Nineveh, in Bagdad, in Tyre, a hundred\r\ngenerations before; men whose ancestors had seen a flower-decked,\r\nslave-adorned cortege drift with its wake of captives down the avenues\r\nof Imperial Rome....\r\n\r\nPast the Rialto, the glittering front of the Astor, the jewelled\r\nmagnificence of Times Square ... a gorgeous alley of incandescence\r\nahead.... Then--was it years later?--he was paying the taxi-driver in\r\nfront of a white building on Fifty-seventh Street. He was in the\r\nhall--ah, there was the negro boy from Martinique, lazy, indolent,\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\n"Is Mrs. Patch in?"\r\n\r\n"I have just came on, sah," the man announced with his incongruous\r\nBritish accent.\r\n\r\n"Take me up--"\r\n\r\nThen the slow drone of the elevator, the three steps to the door, which\r\nswung open at the impetus of his knock.\r\n\r\n"Gloria!" His voice was trembling. No answer. A faint string of smoke\r\nwas rising from a cigarette-tray--a number of Vanity Fair sat astraddle\r\non the table.\r\n\r\n"Gloria!"\r\n\r\nHe ran into the bedroom, the bath. She was not there. A negligee of\r\nrobin\'s-egg blue laid out upon the bed diffused a faint perfume,\r\nillusive and familiar. On a chair were a pair of stockings and a street\r\ndress; an open powder box yawned upon the bureau. She must just\r\nhave gone out.\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang abruptly and he started--answered it with all the\r\nsensations of an impostor.\r\n\r\n"Hello. Is Mrs. Patch there?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m looking for her myself. Who is this?"\r\n\r\n"This is Mr. Crawford."\r\n\r\n"This is Mr. Patch speaking. I\'ve just arrived unexpectedly, and I don\'t\r\nknow where to find her."\r\n\r\n"Oh." Mr. Crawford sounded a bit taken aback. "Why, I imagine she\'s at\r\nthe Armistice Ball. I know she intended going, but I didn\'t think she\'d\r\nleave so early."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the Armistice Ball?"\r\n\r\n"At the Astor."\r\n\r\n"Thanks."\r\n\r\nAnthony hung up sharply and rose. Who was Mr. Crawford? And who was it\r\nthat was taking her to the ball? How long had this been going on? All\r\nthese questions asked and answered themselves a dozen times, a dozen\r\nways. His very proximity to her drove him half frantic.\r\n\r\nIn a frenzy of suspicion he rushed here and there about the apartment,\r\nhunting for some sign of masculine occupation, opening the bathroom\r\ncupboard, searching feverishly through the bureau drawers. Then he found\r\nsomething that made him stop suddenly and sit down on one of the twin\r\nbeds, the corners of his mouth drooping as though he were about to weep.\r\nThere in a corner of her drawer, tied with a frail blue ribbon, were all\r\nthe letters and telegrams he had written her during the year past. He\r\nwas suffused with happy and sentimental shame.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not fit to touch her," he cried aloud to the four walls. "I\'m not\r\nfit to touch her little hand."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he went out to look for her.\r\n\r\nIn the Astor lobby he was engulfed immediately in a crowd so thick as to\r\nmake progress almost impossible. He asked the direction of the ballroom\r\nfrom half a dozen people before he could get a sober and intelligible\r\nanswer. Eventually, after a last long wait, he checked his military\r\novercoat in the hall.\r\n\r\nIt was only nine but the dance was in full blast. The panorama was\r\nincredible. Women, women everywhere--girls gay with wine singing shrilly\r\nabove the clamor of the dazzling confetti-covered throng; girls set off\r\nby the uniforms of a dozen nations; fat females collapsing without\r\ndignity upon the floor and retaining self-respect by shouting "Hurraw\r\nfor the Allies!"; three women with white hair dancing hand in hand\r\naround a sailor, who revolved in a dizzying spin upon the floor,\r\nclasping to his heart an empty bottle of champagne.\r\n\r\nBreathlessly Anthony scanned the dancers, scanned the muddled lines\r\ntrailing in single file in and out among the tables, scanned the\r\nhorn-blowing, kissing, coughing, laughing, drinking parties under the\r\ngreat full-bosomed flags which leaned in glowing color over the\r\npageantry and the sound.\r\n\r\nThen he saw Gloria. She was sitting at a table for two directly across\r\nthe room. Her dress was black, and above it her animated face, tinted\r\nwith the most glamourous rose, made, he thought, a spot of poignant\r\nbeauty on the room. His heart leaped as though to a new music. He\r\njostled his way toward her and called her name just as the gray eyes\r\nlooked up and found him. For that instant as their bodies met and\r\nmelted, the world, the revel, the tumbling whimper of the music faded to\r\nan ecstatic monotone hushed as a song of bees.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Gloria!" he cried.\r\n\r\nHer kiss was a cool rill flowing from her heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nA MATTER OF AESTHETICS\r\n\r\nOn the night when Anthony had left for Camp Hooker one year before, all\r\nthat was left of the beautiful Gloria Gilbert--her shell, her young and\r\nlovely body--moved up the broad marble steps of the Grand Central\r\nStation with the rhythm of the engine beating in her ears like a dream,\r\nand out onto Vanderbilt Avenue, where the huge bulk of the Biltmore\r\noverhung, the street and, down at its low, gleaming entrance, sucked in\r\nthe many-colored opera-cloaks of gorgeously dressed girls. For a moment\r\nshe paused by the taxi-stand and watched them--wondering that but a few\r\nyears before she had been of their number, ever setting out for a\r\nradiant Somewhere, always just about to have that ultimate passionate\r\nadventure for which the girls\' cloaks were delicate and beautifully\r\nfurred, for which their cheeks were painted and their hearts higher than\r\nthe transitory dome of pleasure that would engulf them, coiffure,\r\ncloak, and all.\r\n\r\nIt was growing colder and the men passing had flipped up the collars of\r\ntheir overcoats. This change was kind to her. It would have been kinder\r\nstill had everything changed, weather, streets, and people, and had she\r\nbeen whisked away, to wake in some high, fresh-scented room, alone, and\r\nstatuesque within and without, as in her virginal and colorful past.\r\n\r\nInside the taxicab she wept impotent tears. That she had not been happy\r\nwith Anthony for over a year mattered little. Recently his presence had\r\nbeen no more than what it would awake in her of that memorable June. The\r\nAnthony of late, irritable, weak, and poor, could do no less than make\r\nher irritable in turn--and bored with everything except the fact that in\r\na highly imaginative and eloquent youth they had come together in an\r\necstatic revel of emotion. Because of this mutually vivid memory she\r\nwould have done more for Anthony than for any other human--so when she\r\ngot into the taxicab she wept passionately, and wanted to call his\r\nname aloud.\r\n\r\nMiserable, lonesome as a forgotten child, she sat in the quiet apartment\r\nand wrote him a letter full of confused sentiment:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... _I can almost look down the tracks and see you going but without\r\nyou, dearest, dearest, I can\'t see or hear or feel or think. Being\r\napart--whatever has happened or will happen to us--is like begging for\r\nmercy from a storm, Anthony; it\'s like growing old. I want to kiss you\r\nso--in the back of your neck where your old black hair starts. Because I\r\nlove you and whatever we do or say to each other, or have done, or have\r\nsaid, you\'ve got to feel how much I do, how inanimate I am when you\'re\r\ngone. I can\'t even hate the damnable presence of PEOPLE, those people in\r\nthe station who haven\'t any right to live--I can\'t resent them even\r\nthough they\'re dirtying up our world, because I\'m engrossed in\r\nwanting you so._\r\n\r\n_If you hated me, if you were covered with sores like a leper, if you\r\nran away with another woman or starved me or beat me--how absurd this\r\nsounds--I\'d still want you, I\'d still love you. I_ KNOW, _my darling._\r\n\r\n_It\'s late--I have all the windows open and the air outside, is just as\r\nsoft as spring, yet, somehow, much more young and frail than spring. Why\r\ndo they make spring a young girl, why does that illusion dance and yodel\r\nits way for three months through the world\'s preposterous barrenness.\r\nSpring is a lean old plough horse with its ribs showing--it\'s a pile of\r\nrefuse in a field, parched by the sun and the rain to an ominous\r\ncleanliness._\r\n\r\n_In a few hours you\'ll wake up, my darling--and you\'ll be miserable, and\r\ndisgusted with life. You\'ll be in Delaware or Carolina or somewhere and\r\nso unimportant. I don\'t believe there\'s any one alive who can\r\ncontemplate themselves as an impermanent institution, as a luxury or an\r\nunnecessary evil. Very few of the people who accentuate the futility of\r\nlife remark the futility of themselves. Perhaps they think that in\r\nproclaiming the evil of living they somehow salvage their own worth from\r\nthe ruin--but they don\'t, even you and I...._\r\n\r\n_ ... Still I can see you. There\'s blue haze about the trees where\r\nyou\'ll be passing, too beautiful to be predominant. No, the fallow\r\nsquares of earth will be most frequent--they\'ll be along beside the\r\ntrack like dirty coarse brown sheets drying in the sun, alive,\r\nmechanical, abominable. Nature, slovenly old hag, has been sleeping in\r\nthem with every old farmer or negro or immigrant who happened to\r\ncovet her...._\r\n\r\n_So you see that now you\'re gone I\'ve written a letter all full of\r\ncontempt and despair. And that just means that I love you, Anthony, with\r\nall there is to love with in your_\r\n\r\nGLORIA.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen she had addressed the letter she went to her twin bed and lay down\r\nupon it, clasping Anthony\'s pillow in her arms as though by sheer force\r\nof emotion she could metamorphize it into his warm and living body. Two\r\no\'clock saw her dry-eyed, staring with steady persistent grief into the\r\ndarkness, remembering, remembering unmercifully, blaming herself for a\r\nhundred fancied unkindnesses, making a likeness of Anthony akin to some\r\nmartyred and transfigured Christ. For a time she thought of him as he,\r\nin his more sentimental moments, probably thought of himself.\r\n\r\nAt five she was still awake. A mysterious grinding noise that went on\r\nevery morning across the areaway told her the hour. She heard an alarm\r\nclock ring, and saw a light make a yellow square on an illusory blank\r\nwall opposite. With the half-formed resolution of following him South\r\nimmediately, her sorrow grew remote and unreal, and moved off from her\r\nas the dark moved westward. She fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke the sight of the empty bed beside her brought a renewal\r\nof misery, dispelled shortly, however, by the inevitable callousness of\r\nthe bright morning. Though she was not conscious of it, there was relief\r\nin eating breakfast without Anthony\'s tired and worried face opposite\r\nher. Now that she was alone she lost all desire to complain about the\r\nfood. She would change her breakfasts, she thought--have a lemonade and\r\na tomato sandwich instead of the sempiternal bacon and eggs and toast.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, at noon when she had called up several of her\r\nacquaintances, including the martial Muriel, and found each one engaged\r\nfor lunch, she gave way to a quiet pity for herself and her loneliness.\r\nCurled on the bed with pencil and paper she wrote Anthony\r\nanother letter.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon arrived a special delivery, mailed from some small\r\nNew Jersey town, and the familiarity of the phrasing, the almost audible\r\nundertone of worry and discontent, were so familiar that they comforted\r\nher. Who knew? Perhaps army discipline would harden Anthony and accustom\r\nhim to the idea of work. She had immutable faith that the war would be\r\nover before he was called upon to fight, and meanwhile the suit would be\r\nwon, and they could begin again, this time on a different basis. The\r\nfirst thing different would be that she would have a child. It was\r\nunbearable that she should be so utterly alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a week before she could stay in the apartment with the\r\nprobability of remaining dry-eyed. There seemed little in the city that\r\nwas amusing. Muriel had been shifted to a hospital in New Jersey, from\r\nwhich she took a metropolitan holiday only every other week, and with\r\nthis defection Gloria grew to realize how few were the friends she had\r\nmade in all these years of New York. The men she knew were in the army.\r\n"Men she knew"?--she had conceded vaguely to herself that all the men\r\nwho had ever been in love with her were her friends. Each one of them\r\nhad at a certain considerable time professed to value her favor above\r\nanything in life. But now--where were they? At least two were dead, half\r\na dozen or more were married, the rest scattered from France to the\r\nPhilippines. She wondered whether any of them thought of her, and how\r\noften, and in what respect. Most of them must still picture the little\r\ngirl of seventeen or so, the adolescent siren of nine years before.\r\n\r\nThe girls, too, were gone far afield. She had never been popular in\r\nschool. She had been too beautiful, too lazy, not sufficiently conscious\r\nof being a Farmover girl and a "Future Wife and Mother" in perpetual\r\ncapital letters. And girls who had never been kissed hinted, with\r\nshocked expressions on their plain but not particularly wholesome faces,\r\nthat Gloria had. Then these girls had gone east or west or south,\r\nmarried and become "people," prophesying, if they prophesied about\r\nGloria, that she would come to a bad end--not knowing that no endings\r\nwere bad, and that they, like her, were by no means the mistresses of\r\ntheir destinies.\r\n\r\nGloria told over to herself the people who had visited them in the gray\r\nhouse at Marietta. It had seemed at the time that they were always\r\nhaving company--she had indulged in an unspoken conviction that each\r\nguest was ever afterward slightly indebted to her. They owed her a sort\r\nof moral ten dollars apiece, and should she ever be in need she might,\r\nso to speak, borrow from them this visionary currency. But they were\r\ngone, scattered like chaff, mysteriously and subtly vanished in essence\r\nor in fact.\r\n\r\nBy Christmas, Gloria\'s conviction that she should join Anthony had\r\nreturned, no longer as a sudden emotion, but as a recurrent need. She\r\ndecided to write him word of her coming, but postponed the announcement\r\nupon the advice of Mr. Haight, who expected almost weekly that the case\r\nwas coming up for trial.\r\n\r\nOne day, early in January, as she was walking on Fifth Avenue, bright\r\nnow with uniforms and hung with the flags of the virtuous nations, she\r\nmet Rachael Barnes, whom she had not seen for nearly a year. Even\r\nRachael, whom she had grown to dislike, was a relief from ennui, and\r\ntogether they went to the Ritz for tea.\r\n\r\nAfter a second cocktail they became enthusiastic. They liked each other.\r\nThey talked about their husbands, Rachael in that tone of public\r\nvainglory, with private reservations, in which wives are wont to speak.\r\n\r\n"Rodman\'s abroad in the Quartermaster Corps. He\'s a captain. He was\r\nbound he would go, and he didn\'t think he could get into anything else."\r\n\r\n"Anthony\'s in the Infantry." The words in their relation to the cocktail\r\ngave Gloria a sort of glow. With each sip she approached a warm and\r\ncomforting patriotism.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Rachael half an hour later, as they were leaving,\r\n"can\'t you come up to dinner to-morrow night? I\'m having two awfully\r\nsweet officers who are just going overseas. I think we ought to do all\r\nwe can to make it attractive for them."\r\n\r\nGloria accepted gladly. She took down the address--recognizing by its\r\nnumber a fashionable apartment building on Park Avenue.\r\n\r\n"It\'s been awfully good to have seen you, Rachael."\r\n\r\n"It\'s been wonderful. I\'ve wanted to."\r\n\r\nWith these three sentences a certain night in Marietta two summers\r\nbefore, when Anthony and Rachael had been unnecessarily attentive to\r\neach other, was forgiven--Gloria forgave Rachael, Rachael forgave\r\nGloria. Also it was forgiven that Rachael had been witness to the\r\ngreatest disaster in the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Patch--\r\n\r\nCompromising with events time moves along.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILES OF CAPTAIN COLLINS\r\n\r\nThe two officers were captains of the popular craft, machine gunnery. At\r\ndinner they referred to themselves with conscious boredom as members of\r\nthe "Suicide Club"--in those days every recondite branch of the service\r\nreferred to itself as the Suicide Club. One of the captains--Rachael\'s\r\ncaptain, Gloria observed--was a tall horsy man of thirty with a pleasant\r\nmustache and ugly teeth. The other, Captain Collins, was chubby,\r\npink-faced, and inclined to laugh with abandon every time he caught\r\nGloria\'s eye. He took an immediate fancy to her, and throughout dinner\r\nshowered her with inane compliments. With her second glass of champagne\r\nGloria decided that for the first time in months she was thoroughly\r\nenjoying herself.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner it was suggested that they all go somewhere and dance. The\r\ntwo officers supplied themselves with bottles of liquor from Rachael\'s\r\nsideboard--a law forbade service to the military--and so equipped they\r\nwent through innumerable fox trots in several glittering caravanseries\r\nalong Broadway, faithfully alternating partners--while Gloria became\r\nmore and more uproarious and more and more amusing to the pink-faced\r\ncaptain, who seldom bothered to remove his genial smile at all.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\'clock to her great surprise she was in the minority for\r\nstaying out. The others wanted to return to Rachael\'s apartment--to get\r\nsome more liquor, they said. Gloria argued persistently that Captain\r\nCollins\'s flask was half full--she had just seen it--then catching\r\nRachael\'s eye she received an unmistakable wink. She deduced,\r\nconfusedly, that her hostess wanted to get rid of the officers and\r\nassented to being bundled into a taxicab outside.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wolf sat on the left with Rachael on his knees. Captain Collins\r\nsat in the middle, and as he settled himself he slipped his arm about\r\nGloria\'s shoulder. It rested there lifelessly for a moment and then\r\ntightened like a vise. He leaned over her.\r\n\r\n"You\'re awfully pretty," he whispered.\r\n\r\n"Thank you kindly, sir." She was neither pleased nor annoyed. Before\r\nAnthony came so many arms had done likewise that it had become little\r\nmore than a gesture, sentimental but without significance.\r\n\r\nUp in Rachael\'s long front room a low fire and two lamps shaded with\r\norange silk gave all the light, so that the corners were full of deep and\r\nsomnolent shadows. The hostess, moving about in a dark-figured gown of\r\nloose chiffon, seemed to accentuate the already sensuous atmosphere. For\r\na while they were all four together, tasting the sandwiches that waited\r\non the tea table--then Gloria found herself alone with Captain Collins\r\non the fireside lounge; Rachael and Captain Wolf had withdrawn to the\r\nother side of the room, where they were conversing in subdued voices.\r\n\r\n"I wish you weren\'t married," said Collins, his face a ludicrous\r\ntravesty of "in all seriousness."\r\n\r\n"Why?" She held out her glass to be filled with a high-ball.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t drink any more," he urged her, frowning.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d be nicer--if you didn\'t."\r\n\r\nGloria caught suddenly the intended suggestion of the remark, the\r\natmosphere he was attempting to create. She wanted to laugh--yet she\r\nrealized that there was nothing to laugh at. She had been enjoying the\r\nevening, and she had no desire to go home--at the same time it hurt her\r\npride to be flirted with on just that level.\r\n\r\n"Pour me another drink," she insisted.\r\n\r\n"Please--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be ridiculous!" she cried in exasperation.\r\n\r\n"Very well." He yielded with ill grace.\r\n\r\nThen his arm was about her again, and again she made no protest. But\r\nwhen his pink cheek came close she leaned away.\r\n\r\n"You\'re awfully sweet," he said with an aimless air.\r\n\r\nShe began to sing softly, wishing now that he would take down his arm.\r\nSuddenly her eye fell on an intimate scene across the room--Rachael and\r\nCaptain Wolf were engrossed in a long kiss. Gloria shivered\r\nslightly--she knew not why.... Pink face approached again.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t look at them," he whispered. Almost immediately his other\r\narm was around her ... his breath was on her cheek. Again absurdity\r\ntriumphed over disgust, and her laugh was a weapon that needed no\r\nedge of words.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thought you were a sport," he was saying.\r\n\r\n"What\'s a sport?"\r\n\r\n"Why, a person that likes to--to enjoy life."\r\n\r\n"Is kissing you generally considered a joyful affair?"\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted as Rachael and Captain Wolf appeared suddenly\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n"It\'s late, Gloria," said Rachael--she was flushed and her hair was\r\ndishevelled. "You\'d better stay here all night."\r\n\r\nFor an instant Gloria thought the officers were being dismissed. Then\r\nshe understood, and, understanding, got to her feet as casually as\r\nshe was able.\r\n\r\nUncomprehendingly Rachael continued:\r\n\r\n"You can have the room just off this one. I can lend you everything you\r\nneed."\r\n\r\nCollins\'s eyes implored her like a dog\'s; Captain Wolf\'s arm had settled\r\nfamiliarly around Rachael\'s waist; they were waiting.\r\n\r\nBut the lure of promiscuity, colorful, various, labyrinthine, and ever a\r\nlittle odorous and stale, had no call or promise for Gloria. Had she so\r\ndesired she would have remained, without hesitation, without regret; as\r\nit was she could face coolly the six hostile and offended eyes that\r\nfollowed her out into the hall with forced politeness and hollow words.\r\n\r\n"_He_ wasn\'t even sport, enough to try to take me home," she thought in\r\nthe taxi, and then with a quick surge of resentment: "How\r\n_utterly_ common!"\r\n\r\n\r\nGALLANTRY\r\n\r\nIn February she had an experience of quite a different sort. Tudor\r\nBaird, an ancient flame, a young man whom at one time she had fully\r\nintended to marry, came to New York by way of the Aviation Corps, and\r\ncalled upon her. They went several times to the theatre, and within a\r\nweek, to her great enjoyment, he was as much in love with her as ever.\r\nQuite deliberately she brought it about, realizing too late that she had\r\ndone a mischief. He reached the point of sitting with her in miserable\r\nsilence whenever they went out together.\r\n\r\nA Scroll and Keys man at Yale, he possessed the correct reticences of a\r\n"good egg," the correct notions of chivalry and _noblesse oblige_--and,\r\nof course but unfortunately, the correct biases and the correct lack of\r\nideas--all those traits which Anthony had taught her to despise, but\r\nwhich, nevertheless, she rather admired. Unlike the majority of his\r\ntype, she found that he was not a bore. He was handsome, witty in a\r\nlight way, and when she was with him she felt that because of some\r\nquality he possessed--call it stupidity, loyalty, sentimentality, or\r\nsomething not quite as definite as any of the three--he would have done\r\nanything in his power to please her.\r\n\r\nHe told her this among other things, very correctly and with a ponderous\r\nmanliness that masked a real suffering. Loving him not at all she grew\r\nsorry for him and kissed him sentimentally one night because he was so\r\ncharming, a relic of a vanishing generation which lived a priggish and\r\ngraceful illusion and was being replaced by less gallant fools.\r\nAfterward she was glad she had kissed him, for next day when his plane\r\nfell fifteen hundred feet at Mineola a piece of a gasolene engine\r\nsmashed through his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLORIA ALONE\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Haight told her that the trial would not take place until\r\nautumn she decided that without telling Anthony she would go into the\r\nmovies. When he saw her successful, both histrionically and financially,\r\nwhen he saw that she could have her will of Joseph Bloeckman, yielding\r\nnothing in return, he would lose his silly prejudices. She lay awake\r\nhalf one night planning her career and enjoying her successes in\r\nanticipation, and the next morning she called up "Films Par Excellence."\r\nMr. Bloeckman was in Europe.\r\n\r\nBut the idea had gripped her so strongly this time that she decided to\r\ngo the rounds of the moving picture employment agencies. As so often had\r\nbeen the case, her sense of smell worked against her good intentions.\r\nThe employment agency smelt as though it had been dead a very long time.\r\nShe waited five minutes inspecting her unprepossessing competitors--then\r\nshe walked briskly out into the farthest recesses of Central Park and\r\nremained so long that she caught a cold. She was trying to air the\r\nemployment agency out of her walking suit.\r\n\r\nIn the spring she began to gather from Anthony\'s letters--not from any\r\none in particular but from their culminative effect--that he did not\r\nwant her to come South. Curiously repeated excuses that seemed to haunt\r\nhim by their very insufficiency occurred with Freudian regularity. He\r\nset them down in each letter as though he feared he had forgotten them\r\nthe last time, as though it were desperately necessary to impress her\r\nwith them. And the dilutions of his letters with affectionate\r\ndiminutives began to be mechanical and unspontaneous--almost as though,\r\nhaving completed the letter, he had looked it over and literally stuck\r\nthem in, like epigrams in an Oscar Wilde play. She jumped to the\r\nsolution, rejected it, was angry and depressed by turns--finally she\r\nshut her mind to it proudly, and allowed an increasing coolness to creep\r\ninto her end of the correspondence.\r\n\r\nOf late she had found a good deal to occupy her attention. Several\r\naviators whom she had met through Tudor Baird came into New York to see\r\nher and two other ancient beaux turned up, stationed at Camp Dix. As\r\nthese men were ordered overseas they, so to speak, handed her down to\r\ntheir friends. But after another rather disagreeable experience with a\r\npotential Captain Collins she made it plain that when any one was\r\nintroduced to her he should be under no misapprehensions as to her\r\nstatus and personal intentions.\r\n\r\nWhen summer came she learned, like Anthony, to watch the officers\'\r\ncasualty list, taking a sort of melancholy pleasure in hearing of the\r\ndeath of some one with whom she had once danced a german and in\r\nidentifying by name the younger brothers of former suitors--thinking, as\r\nthe drive toward Paris progressed, that here at length went the world to\r\ninevitable and well-merited destruction.\r\n\r\nShe was twenty-seven. Her birthday fled by scarcely noticed. Years\r\nbefore it had frightened her when she became twenty, to some extent when\r\nshe reached twenty-six--but now she looked in the glass with calm\r\nself-approval seeing the British freshness of her complexion and her\r\nfigure boyish and slim as of old.\r\n\r\nShe tried not to think of Anthony. It was as though she were writing to\r\na stranger. She told her friends that he had been made a corporal and\r\nwas annoyed when they were politely unimpressed. One night she wept\r\nbecause she was sorry for him--had he been even slightly responsive she\r\nwould have gone to him without hesitation on the first train--whatever he\r\nwas doing he needed to be taken care of spiritually, and she felt that\r\nnow she would be able to do even that. Recently, without his continual\r\ndrain upon her moral strength she found herself wonderfully revived.\r\nBefore he left she had been inclined through sheer association to brood\r\non her wasted opportunities--now she returned to her normal state of\r\nmind, strong, disdainful, existing each day for each day\'s worth. She\r\nbought a doll and dressed it; one week she wept over "Ethan Frome"; the\r\nnext she revelled in some novels of Galsworthy\'s, whom she liked for his\r\npower of recreating, by spring in darkness, that illusion of young\r\nromantic love to which women look forever forward and forever back.\r\n\r\nIn October Anthony\'s letters multiplied, became almost frantic--then\r\nsuddenly ceased. For a worried month it needed all her powers of control\r\nto refrain from leaving immediately for Mississippi. Then a telegram\r\ntold her that he had been in the hospital and that she could expect him\r\nin New York within ten days. Like a figure in a dream he came back into\r\nher life across the ballroom on that November evening--and all through\r\nlong hours that held familiar gladness she took him close to her breast,\r\nnursing an illusion of happiness and security she had not thought that\r\nshe would know again.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOMFITURE OF THE GENERALS\r\n\r\nAfter a week Anthony\'s regiment went back to the Mississippi camp to be\r\ndischarged. The officers shut themselves up in the compartments on the\r\nPullman cars and drank the whiskey they had bought in New York, and in\r\nthe coaches the soldiers got as drunk as possible also--and pretended\r\nwhenever the train stopped at a village that they were just returned\r\nfrom France, where they had practically put an end to the German army.\r\nAs they all wore overseas caps and claimed that they had not had time to\r\nhave their gold service stripes sewed on, the yokelry of the seaboard\r\nwere much impressed and asked them how they liked the trenches--to which\r\nthey replied "Oh, _boy!_" with great smacking of tongues and shaking of\r\nheads. Some one took a piece of chalk and scrawled on the side of the\r\ntrain, "We won the war--now we\'re going home," and the officers laughed\r\nand let it stay. They were all getting what swagger they could out of\r\nthis ignominious return.\r\n\r\nAs they rumbled on toward camp, Anthony was uneasy lest he should find\r\nDot awaiting him patiently at the station. To his relief he neither saw\r\nnor heard anything of her and thinking that were she still in town she\r\nwould certainly attempt to communicate with him, he concluded that she\r\nhad gone--whither he neither knew nor cared. He wanted only to return to\r\nGloria--Gloria reborn and wonderfully alive. When eventually he was\r\ndischarged he left his company on the rear of a great truck with a crowd\r\nwho had given tolerant, almost sentimental, cheers for their officers,\r\nespecially for Captain Dunning. The captain, on his part, had addressed\r\nthem with tears in his eyes as to the pleasure, etc., and the work,\r\netc., and time not wasted, etc., and duty, etc. It was very dull and\r\nhuman; having given ear to it Anthony, whose mind was freshened by his\r\nweek in New York, renewed his deep loathing for the military profession\r\nand all it connoted. In their childish hearts two out of every three\r\nprofessional officers considered that wars were made for armies and not\r\narmies for wars. He rejoiced to see general and field-officers riding\r\ndesolately about the barren camp deprived of their commands. He rejoiced\r\nto hear the men in his company laugh scornfully at the inducements\r\ntendered them to remain in the army. They were to attend "schools." He\r\nknew what these "schools" were.\r\n\r\nTwo days later he was with Gloria in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER WINTER\r\n\r\nLate one February afternoon Anthony came into the apartment and groping\r\nthrough the little hall, pitch-dark in the winter dusk, found Gloria\r\nsitting by the window. She turned as he came in.\r\n\r\n"What did Mr. Haight have to say?" she asked listlessly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," he answered, "usual thing. Next month, perhaps."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him closely; her ear attuned to his voice caught the\r\nslightest thickness in the dissyllable.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been drinking," she remarked dispassionately.\r\n\r\n"Couple glasses."\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\nHe yawned in the armchair and there was a moment\'s silence between them.\r\nThen she demanded suddenly:\r\n\r\n"Did you go to Mr. Haight? Tell me the truth."\r\n\r\n"No." He smiled weakly. "As a matter of fact I didn\'t have time."\r\n\r\n"I thought you didn\'t go.... He sent for you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t give a damn. I\'m sick of waiting around his office. You\'d think\r\nhe was doing _me_ a favor." He glanced at Gloria as though expecting\r\nmoral support, but she had turned back to her contemplation of the\r\ndubious and unprepossessing out-of-doors.\r\n\r\n"I feel rather weary of life to-day," he offered tentatively. Still she\r\nwas silent. "I met a fellow and we talked in the Biltmore bar."\r\n\r\nThe dusk had suddenly deepened but neither of them made any move to turn\r\non the lights. Lost in heaven knew what contemplation, they sat there\r\nuntil a flurry of snow drew a languid sigh from Gloria.\r\n\r\n"What\'ve you been doing?" he asked, finding the silence oppressive.\r\n\r\n"Reading a magazine--all full of idiotic articles by prosperous authors\r\nabout how terrible it is for poor people to buy silk shirts. And while I\r\nwas reading it I could think of nothing except how I wanted a gray\r\nsquirrel coat--and how we can\'t afford one."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we can."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! If you want a fur coat you can have one."\r\n\r\nHer voice coming through the dark held an implication of scorn.\r\n\r\n"You mean we can sell another bond?"\r\n\r\n"If necessary. I don\'t want to go without things. We have spent a lot,\r\nthough, since I\'ve been back."\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up!" she said in irritation.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'m sick and tired of hearing you talk about what we\'ve spent\r\nor what we\'ve done. You came back two months ago and we\'ve been on some\r\nsort of a party practically every night since. We\'ve both wanted to go\r\nout, and we\'ve gone. Well, you haven\'t heard me complain, have you? But\r\nall you do is whine, whine, whine. I don\'t care any more what we do or\r\nwhat becomes of us and at least I\'m consistent. But I will _not_\r\ntolerate your complaining and calamity-howling----"\r\n\r\n"You\'re not very pleasant yourself sometimes, you know."\r\n\r\n"I\'m under no obligations to be. You\'re not making any attempt to make\r\nthings different."\r\n\r\n"But I am--"\r\n\r\n"Huh! Seems to me I\'ve heard that before. This morning you weren\'t going\r\nto touch another thing to drink until you\'d gotten a position. And you\r\ndidn\'t even have the spunk to go to Mr. Haight when he sent for you\r\nabout the suit."\r\n\r\nAnthony got to his feet and switched on the lights.\r\n\r\n"See here!" he cried, blinking, "I\'m getting sick of that sharp tongue\r\nof yours."\r\n\r\n"Well, what are you going to do about it?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think _I\'m_ particularly happy?" he continued, ignoring her\r\nquestion. "Do you think I don\'t know we\'re not living as we ought to?"\r\n\r\nIn an instant Gloria stood trembling beside him.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t _stand_ it!" she burst out. "I won\'t be lectured to. You and\r\nyour suffering! You\'re just a pitiful weakling and you always\r\nhave been!"\r\n\r\nThey faced one another idiotically, each of them unable to impress the\r\nother, each of them tremendously, achingly, bored. Then she went into\r\nthe bedroom and shut the door behind her.\r\n\r\nHis return had brought into the foreground all their pre-bellum\r\nexasperations. Prices had risen alarmingly and in perverse ratio their\r\nincome had shrunk to a little over half of its original size. There had\r\nbeen the large retainer\'s fee to Mr. Haight; there were stocks bought at\r\none hundred, now down to thirty and forty and other investments that\r\nwere not paying at all. During the previous spring Gloria had been given\r\nthe alternative of leaving the apartment or of signing a year\'s lease at\r\ntwo hundred and twenty-five a month. She had signed it. Inevitably as\r\nthe necessity for economy had increased they found themselves as a pair\r\nquite unable to save. The old policy of prevarication was resorted to.\r\nWeary of their incapabilities they chattered of what they would\r\ndo--oh--to-morrow, of how they would "stop going on parties" and of how\r\nAnthony would go to work. But when dark came down Gloria, accustomed to\r\nan engagement every night, would feel the ancient restlessness creeping\r\nover her. She would stand in the doorway of the bedroom, chewing\r\nfuriously at her fingers and sometimes meeting Anthony\'s eyes as he\r\nglanced up from his book. Then the telephone, and her nerves would\r\nrelax, she would answer it with ill-concealed eagerness. Some one was\r\ncoming up "for just a few minutes"--and oh, the weariness of pretense,\r\nthe appearance of the wine table, the revival of their jaded\r\nspirits--and the awakening, like the mid-point of a sleepless night in\r\nwhich they moved.\r\n\r\nAs the winter passed with the march of the returning troops along Fifth\r\nAvenue they became more and more aware that since Anthony\'s return their\r\nrelations had entirely changed. After that reflowering of tenderness and\r\npassion each of them had returned into some solitary dream unshared by\r\nthe other and what endearments passed between them passed, it seemed,\r\nfrom empty heart to empty heart, echoing hollowly the departure of what\r\nthey knew at last was gone.\r\n\r\nAnthony had again made the rounds of the metropolitan newspapers and had\r\nagain been refused encouragement by a motley of office boys, telephone\r\ngirls, and city editors. The word was: "We\'re keeping any vacancies open\r\nfor our own men who are still in France." Then, late in March, his eye\r\nfell on an advertisement in the morning paper and in consequence he\r\nfound at last the semblance of an occupation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYOU CAN SELL!!!\r\n\r\n_Why not earn while you learn?_\r\n\r\n_Our salesmen make $50-$200 weekly_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere followed an address on Madison Avenue, and instructions to appear\r\nat one o\'clock that afternoon. Gloria, glancing over his shoulder after\r\none of their usual late breakfasts, saw him regarding it idly.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you try it?" she suggested.\r\n\r\n"Oh--it\'s one of these crazy schemes."\r\n\r\n"It might not be. At least it\'d be experience."\r\n\r\nAt her urging he went at one o\'clock to the appointed address, where he\r\nfound himself one of a dense miscellany of men waiting in front of the\r\ndoor. They ranged from a messenger-boy evidently misusing his company\'s\r\ntime to an immemorial individual with a gnarled body and a gnarled cane.\r\nSome of the men were seedy, with sunken cheeks and puffy pink\r\neyes--others were young; possibly still in high school. After a jostled\r\nfifteen minutes during which they all eyed one another with apathetic\r\nsuspicion there appeared a smart young shepherd clad in a "waist-line"\r\nsuit and wearing the manner of an assistant rector who herded them\r\nup-stairs into a large room, which resembled a school-room and contained\r\ninnumerable desks. Here the prospective salesmen sat down--and again\r\nwaited. After an interval a platform at the end of the hall was clouded\r\nwith half a dozen sober but sprightly men who, with one exception, took\r\nseats in a semicircle facing the audience.\r\n\r\nThe exception was the man who seemed the soberest, the most sprightly\r\nand the youngest of the lot, and who advanced to the front of the\r\nplatform. The audience scrutinized him hopefully. He was rather small\r\nand rather pretty, with the commercial rather than the thespian sort of\r\nprettiness. He had straight blond bushy brows and eyes that were almost\r\npreposterously honest, and as he reached the edge of his rostrum he\r\nseemed to throw these eyes out into the audience, simultaneously\r\nextending his arm with two fingers outstretched. Then while he rocked\r\nhimself to a state of balance an expectant silence settled over the\r\nhall. With perfect assurance the young man had taken his listeners in\r\nhand and his words when they came were steady and confident and of the\r\nschool of "straight from the shoulder."\r\n\r\n"Men!"--he began, and paused. The word died with a prolonged echo at the\r\nend of the hall, the faces regarding him, hopefully, cynically, wearily,\r\nwere alike arrested, engrossed. Six hundred eyes were turned slightly\r\nupward. With an even graceless flow that reminded Anthony of the rolling\r\nof bowling balls he launched himself into the sea of exposition.\r\n\r\n"This bright and sunny morning you picked up your favorite newspaper and\r\nyou found an advertisement which made the plain, unadorned statement\r\nthat _you_ could sell. That was all it said--it didn\'t say \'what,\' it\r\ndidn\'t say \'how,\' it didn\'t say \'why.\' It just made one single solitary\r\nassertion that _you_ and _you_ and _you_"--business of pointing--"could\r\nsell. Now my job isn\'t to make a success of you, because every man is\r\nborn a success, he makes himself a failure; it\'s not to teach you how to\r\ntalk, because each man is a natural orator and only makes himself a\r\nclam; my business is to tell you one thing in a way that will make you\r\n_know_ it--it\'s to tell you that _you_ and _you_ and _you_ have the\r\nheritage of money and prosperity waiting for you to come and claim it."\r\n\r\nAt this point an Irishman of saturnine appearance rose from his desk\r\nnear the rear of the hall and went out.\r\n\r\n"That man thinks he\'ll go look for it in the beer parlor around the\r\ncorner. (Laughter.) He won\'t find it there. Once upon a time I looked\r\nfor it there myself (laughter), but that was before I did what every one\r\nof you men no matter how young or how old, how poor or how rich (a faint\r\nripple of satirical laughter), can do. It was before I found--_myself_!\r\n\r\n"Now I wonder if any of you men know what a \'Heart Talk\' is. A \'Heart\r\nTalk\' is a little book in which I started, about five years ago, to\r\nwrite down what I had discovered were the principal reasons for a man\'s\r\nfailure and the principal reasons for a man\'s success--from John D.\r\nRockerfeller back to John D. Napoleon (laughter), and before that, back\r\nin the days when Abel sold his birthright for a mess of pottage. There\r\nare now one hundred of these \'Heart Talks.\' Those of you who are\r\nsincere, who are interested in our proposition, above all who are\r\ndissatisfied with the way things are breaking for you at present will be\r\nhanded one to take home with you as you go out yonder door this\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n"Now in my own pocket I have four letters just received concerning\r\n\'Heart Talks.\' These letters have names signed to them that are familiar\r\nin every house-hold in the U.S.A. Listen to this one from Detroit:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"DEAR MR. CARLETON:\r\n\r\n"I want to order three thousand more copies of \'Heart Talks\' for\r\ndistribution among my salesmen. They have done more for getting work out\r\nof the men than any bonus proposition ever considered. I read them\r\nmyself constantly, and I desire to heartily congratulate you on getting\r\nat the roots of the biggest problem that faces our generation\r\nto-day--the problem of salesmanship. The rock bottom on which the\r\ncountry is founded is the problem of salesmanship. With many\r\nfelicitations I am\r\n\r\n"Yours very cordially,\r\n\r\n"HENRY W. TERRAL."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe brought the name out in three long booming triumphancies--pausing for\r\nit to produce its magical effect. Then he read two more letters, one\r\nfrom a manufacturer of vacuum cleaners and one from the president of the\r\nGreat Northern Doily Company.\r\n\r\n"And now," he continued, "I\'m going to tell you in a few words what the\r\nproposition is that\'s going to _make_ those of you who go into it in the\r\nright spirit. Simply put, it\'s this: \'Heart Talks\' have been\r\nincorporated as a company. We\'re going to put these little pamphlets\r\ninto the hands of every big business organization, every salesman, and\r\nevery man who _knows_--I don\'t say \'thinks,\' I say _\'knows\'_--that he\r\ncan sell! We are offering some of the stock of the \'Heart Talks\' concern\r\nupon the market, and in order that the distribution may be as wide as\r\npossible, and in order also that we can furnish a living, concrete,\r\nflesh-and-blood example of what salesmanship is, or rather what it may\r\nbe, we\'re going to give those of you who are the real thing a chance to\r\nsell that stock. Now, I don\'t care what you\'ve tried to sell before or\r\nhow you\'ve tried to sell it. It don\'t matter how old you are or how\r\nyoung you are. I only want to know two things--first, do you _want_\r\nsuccess, and, second, will you work for it?\r\n\r\n"My name is Sammy Carleton. Not \'Mr.\' Carleton, but just plain Sammy.\r\nI\'m a regular no-nonsense man with no fancy frills about me. I want you\r\nto call me Sammy.\r\n\r\n"Now this is all I\'m going to say to you to-day. To-morrow I want those\r\nof you who have thought it over and have read the copy of \'Heart Talks\'\r\nwhich will be given to you at the door, to come back to this same room\r\nat this same time, then we\'ll go into the proposition further and I\'ll\r\nexplain to you what I\'ve found the principles of success to be. I\'m\r\ngoing to make you _feel_ that _you_ and _you_ and _you_ can sell!"\r\n\r\nMr. Carleton\'s voice echoed for a moment through the hall and then died\r\naway. To the stamping of many feet Anthony was pushed and jostled with\r\nthe crowd out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER ADVENTURES WITH "HEART TALKS"\r\n\r\nWith an accompaniment of ironic laughter Anthony told Gloria the story\r\nof his commercial adventure. But she listened without amusement.\r\n\r\n"You\'re going to give up again?" she demanded coldly.\r\n\r\n"Why--you don\'t expect me to--"\r\n\r\n"I never expected anything of you."\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Well--I can\'t see the slightest benefit in laughing myself sick over\r\nthis sort of affair. If there\'s anything older than the old story, it\'s\r\nthe new twist."\r\n\r\nIt required an astonishing amount of moral energy on Gloria\'s part to\r\nintimidate him into returning, and when he reported next day, somewhat\r\ndepressed from his perusal of the senile bromides skittishly set forth\r\nin "Heart Talks on Ambition," he found only fifty of the original three\r\nhundred awaiting the appearance of the vital and compelling Sammy\r\nCarleton. Mr. Carleton\'s powers of vitality and compulsion were this\r\ntime exercised in elucidating that magnificent piece of speculation--how\r\nto sell. It seemed that the approved method was to state one\'s\r\nproposition and then to say not "And now, will you buy?"--this was not\r\nthe way--oh, no!--the way was to state one\'s proposition and then,\r\nhaving reduced one\'s adversary to a state of exhaustion, to deliver\r\noneself of the categorical imperative: "Now see here! You\'ve taken up my\r\ntime explaining this matter to you. You\'ve admitted my points--all I\r\nwant to ask is how many do you want?"\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Carleton piled assertion upon assertion Anthony began to feel a\r\nsort of disgusted confidence in him. The man appeared to know what he\r\nwas talking about. Obviously prosperous, he had risen to the position of\r\ninstructing others. It did not occur to Anthony that the type of man who\r\nattains commercial success seldom knows how or why, and, as in his\r\ngrandfather\'s case, when he ascribes reasons, the reasons are generally\r\ninaccurate and absurd.\r\n\r\nAnthony noted that of the numerous old men who had answered the original\r\nadvertisement, only two had returned, and that among the thirty odd who\r\nassembled on the third day to get actual selling instructions from Mr.\r\nCarleton, only one gray head was in evidence. These thirty were eager\r\nconverts; with their mouths they followed the working of Mr. Carleton\'s\r\nmouth; they swayed in their seats with enthusiasm, and in the intervals\r\nof his talk they spoke to each other in tense approving whispers. Yet of\r\nthe chosen few who, in the words of Mr. Carleton, "were determined to\r\nget those deserts that rightly and truly belonged to them," less than\r\nhalf a dozen combined even a modicum of personal appearance with that\r\ngreat gift of being a "pusher." But they were told that they were all\r\nnatural pushers--it was merely necessary that they should believe with a\r\nsort of savage passion in what they were selling. He even urged each one\r\nto buy some stock himself, if possible, in order to increase his own\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day then, Anthony sallied into the street with all the\r\nsensations of a man wanted by the police. Acting according to\r\ninstructions he selected a tall office building in order that he might\r\nride to the top story and work downward, stopping in every office that\r\nhad a name on the door. But at the last minute he hesitated. Perhaps it\r\nwould be more practicable to acclimate himself to the chilly atmosphere\r\nwhich he felt was awaiting him by trying a few offices on, say, Madison\r\nAvenue. He went into an arcade that seemed only semi-prosperous, and\r\nseeing a sign which read Percy B. Weatherbee, Architect, he opened the\r\ndoor heroically and entered. A starchy young woman looked up\r\nquestioningly.\r\n\r\n"Can I see Mr. Weatherbee?" He wondered if his voice sounded tremulous.\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand tentatively on the telephone-receiver.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the name, please?"\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t--ah--know me. He wouldn\'t know my name."\r\n\r\n"What\'s your business with him? You an insurance agent?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, nothing like that!" denied Anthony hurriedly. "Oh, no. It\'s\r\na--it\'s a personal matter." He wondered if he should have said this. It\r\nhad all sounded so simple when Mr. Carleton had enjoined his flock:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t allow yourself to be kept out! Show them you\'ve made up your mind\r\nto talk to them, and they\'ll listen."\r\n\r\nThe girl succumbed to Anthony\'s pleasant, melancholy face, and in a\r\nmoment the door to the inner room opened and admitted a tall,\r\nsplay-footed man with slicked hair. He approached Anthony with\r\nill-concealed impatience.\r\n\r\n"You wanted to see me on a personal matter?"\r\n\r\nAnthony quailed.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to talk to you," he said defiantly.\r\n\r\n"About what?"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll take some time to explain."\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s it about?" Mr. Weatherbee\'s voice indicated rising\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nThen Anthony, straining at each word, each syllable, began:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether or not you\'ve ever heard of a series of pamphlets\r\ncalled \'Heart Talks\'--"\r\n\r\n"Good grief!" cried Percy B. Weatherbee, Architect, "are you trying to\r\ntouch my heart?"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s business. \'Heart Talks\' have been incorporated and we\'re\r\nputting some shares on the market--"\r\n\r\nHis voice faded slowly off, harassed by a fixed and contemptuous stare\r\nfrom his unwilling prey. For another minute he struggled on,\r\nincreasingly sensitive, entangled in his own words. His confidence oozed\r\nfrom him in great retching emanations that seemed to be sections of his\r\nown body. Almost mercifully Percy B. Weatherbee, Architect, terminated\r\nthe interview:\r\n\r\n"Good grief!" he exploded in disgust, "and you call that a _personal_\r\nmatter!" He whipped about and strode into his private office, banging\r\nthe door behind him. Not daring to look at the stenographer, Anthony in\r\nsome shameful and mysterious way got himself from the room. Perspiring\r\nprofusely he stood in the hall wondering why they didn\'t come and arrest\r\nhim; in every hurried look he discerned infallibly a glance of scorn.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour and with the help of two strong whiskies he brought\r\nhimself up to another attempt. He walked into a plumber\'s shop, but when\r\nhe mentioned his business the plumber began pulling on his coat in a\r\ngreat hurry, gruffly announcing that he had to go to lunch. Anthony\r\nremarked politely that it was futile to try to sell a man anything when\r\nhe was hungry, and the plumber heartily agreed.\r\n\r\nThis episode encouraged Anthony; he tried to think that had the plumber\r\nnot been bound for lunch he would at least have listened.\r\n\r\nPassing by a few glittering and formidable bazaars he entered a grocery\r\nstore. A talkative proprietor told him that before buying any stocks he\r\nwas going to see how the armistice affected the market. To Anthony this\r\nseemed almost unfair. In Mr. Carleton\'s salesman\'s Utopia the only\r\nreason prospective buyers ever gave for not purchasing stock was that\r\nthey doubted it to be a promising investment. Obviously a man in that\r\nstate was almost ludicrously easy game, to be brought down merely by the\r\njudicious application of the correct selling points. But these men--why,\r\nactually they weren\'t considering buying anything at all.\r\n\r\nAnthony took several more drinks before he approached his fourth man, a\r\nreal-estate agent; nevertheless, he was floored with a coup as decisive\r\nas a syllogism. The real-estate agent said that he had three brothers in\r\nthe investment business. Viewing himself as a breaker-up of homes\r\nAnthony apologized and went out.\r\n\r\nAfter another drink he conceived the brilliant plan of selling the stock\r\nto the bartenders along Lexington Avenue. This occupied several hours,\r\nfor it was necessary to take a few drinks in each place in order to get\r\nthe proprietor in the proper frame of mind to talk business. But the\r\nbartenders one and all contended that if they had any money to buy bonds\r\nthey would not be bartenders. It was as though they had all convened and\r\ndecided upon that rejoinder. As he approached a dark and soggy five\r\no\'clock he found that they were developing a still more annoying\r\ntendency to turn him off with a jest.\r\n\r\nAt five, then, with a tremendous effort at concentration he decided that\r\nhe must put more variety into his canvassing. He selected a medium-sized\r\ndelicatessen store, and went in. He felt, illuminatingly, that the thing\r\nto do was to cast a spell not only over the storekeeper but over all the\r\ncustomers as well--and perhaps through the psychology of the herd\r\ninstinct they would buy as an astounded and immediately convinced whole.\r\n\r\n"Af\'ernoon," he began in a loud thick voice. "Ga l\'il prop\'sition."\r\n\r\nIf he had wanted silence he obtained it. A sort of awe descended upon\r\nthe half-dozen women marketing and upon the gray-haired ancient who in\r\ncap and apron was slicing chicken.\r\n\r\nAnthony pulled a batch of papers from his flapping briefcase and waved\r\nthem cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Buy a bon\'," he suggested, "good as liberty bon\'!" The phrase pleased\r\nhim and he elaborated upon it. "Better\'n liberty bon\'. Every one these\r\nbon\'s worth _two_ liberty bon\'s." His mind made a hiatus and skipped to\r\nhis peroration, which he delivered with appropriate gestures, these\r\nbeing somewhat marred by the necessity of clinging to the counter with\r\none or both hands.\r\n\r\n"Now see here. You taken up my time. I don\'t want know _why_ you won\'t\r\nbuy. I just want you say _why_. Want you say _how many!_"\r\n\r\nAt this point they should have approached him with check-books and\r\nfountain pens in hand. Realizing that they must have missed a cue\r\nAnthony, with the instincts of an actor, went back and repeated\r\nhis finale.\r\n\r\n"Now see here! You taken up my time. You followed prop\'sition. You\r\nagreed \'th reasonin\'? Now, all I want from _you_ is, how many\r\nlib\'ty bon\'s?"\r\n\r\n"See here!" broke in a new voice. A portly man whose face was adorned\r\nwith symmetrical scrolls of yellow hair had come out of a glass cage in\r\nthe rear of the store and was bearing down upon Anthony. "See\r\nhere, you!"\r\n\r\n"How many?" repeated the salesman sternly. "You taken up my time--"\r\n\r\n"Hey, you!" cried the proprietor, "I\'ll have you taken up by the\r\npolice."\r\n\r\n"You mos\' cert\'nly won\'t!" returned Anthony with fine defiance. "All I\r\nwant know is how many."\r\n\r\nFrom here and there in the store went up little clouds of comment and\r\nexpostulation.\r\n\r\n"How terrible!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a raving maniac."\r\n\r\n"He\'s disgracefully drunk."\r\n\r\nThe proprietor grasped Anthony\'s arm sharply.\r\n\r\n"Get out, or I\'ll call a policeman."\r\n\r\nSome relics of rationality moved Anthony to nod and replace his bonds\r\nclumsily in the case.\r\n\r\n"How many?" he reiterated doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"The whole force if necessary!" thundered his adversary, his yellow\r\nmustache trembling fiercely.\r\n\r\n"Sell \'em all a bon\'."\r\n\r\nWith this Anthony turned, bowed gravely to his late auditors, and\r\nwabbled from the store. He found a taxicab at the corner and rode home\r\nto the apartment. There he fell sound asleep on the sofa, and so Gloria\r\nfound him, his breath filling the air with an unpleasant pungency, his\r\nhand still clutching his open brief case.\r\n\r\nExcept when Anthony was drinking, his range of sensation had become less\r\nthan that of a healthy old man and when prohibition came in July he\r\nfound that, among those who could afford it, there was more drinking\r\nthan ever before. One\'s host now brought out a bottle upon the slightest\r\npretext. The tendency to display liquor was a manifestation of the same\r\ninstinct that led a man to deck his wife with jewels. To have liquor was\r\na boast, almost a badge of respectability.\r\n\r\nIn the mornings Anthony awoke tired, nervous, and worried. Halcyon\r\nsummer twilights and the purple chill of morning alike left him\r\nunresponsive. Only for a brief moment every day in the warmth and\r\nrenewed life of a first high-ball did his mind turn to those opalescent\r\ndreams of future pleasure--the mutual heritage of the happy and the\r\ndamned. But this was only for a little while. As he grew drunker the\r\ndreams faded and he became a confused spectre, moving in odd crannies of\r\nhis own mind, full of unexpected devices, harshly contemptuous at best\r\nand reaching sodden and dispirited depths. One night in June he had\r\nquarrelled violently with Maury over a matter of the utmost triviality.\r\nHe remembered dimly next morning that it had been about a broken pint\r\nbottle of champagne. Maury had told him to sober up and Anthony\'s\r\nfeelings had been hurt, so with an attempted gesture of dignity he had\r\nrisen from the table and seizing Gloria\'s arm half led, half shamed her\r\ninto a taxicab outside, leaving Maury with three dinners ordered and\r\ntickets for the opera.\r\n\r\nThis sort of semi-tragic fiasco had become so usual that when they\r\noccurred he was no longer stirred into making amends. If Gloria\r\nprotested--and of late she was more likely to sink into contemptuous\r\nsilence--he would either engage in a bitter defense of himself or else\r\nstalk dismally from the apartment. Never since the incident on the\r\nstation platform at Redgate had he laid his hands on her in anger--though\r\nhe was withheld often only by some instinct that itself made him tremble\r\nwith rage. Just as he still cared more for her than for any other\r\ncreature, so did he more intensely and frequently hate her.\r\n\r\nSo far, the judges of the Appellate Division had failed to hand down a\r\ndecision, but after another postponement they finally affirmed the\r\ndecree of the lower court--two justices dissenting. A notice of appeal\r\nwas served upon Edward Shuttleworth. The case was going to the court of\r\nlast resort, and they were in for another interminable wait. Six months,\r\nperhaps a year. It had grown enormously unreal to them, remote and\r\nuncertain as heaven.\r\n\r\nThroughout the previous winter one small matter had been a subtle and\r\nomnipresent irritant--the question of Gloria\'s gray fur coat. At that\r\ntime women enveloped in long squirrel wraps could be seen every few\r\nyards along Fifth Avenue. The women were converted to the shape of tops.\r\nThey seemed porcine and obscene; they resembled kept women in the\r\nconcealing richness, the feminine animality of the garment. Yet--Gloria\r\nwanted a gray squirrel coat.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the matter--or, rather, arguing it, for even more than in the\r\nfirst year of their marriage did every discussion take the form of\r\nbitter debate full of such phrases as "most certainly," "utterly\r\noutrageous," "it\'s so, nevertheless," and the ultra-emphatic\r\n"regardless"--they concluded that they could not afford it. And so\r\ngradually it began to stand as a symbol of their growing\r\nfinancial anxiety.\r\n\r\nTo Gloria the shrinkage of their income was a remarkable phenomenon,\r\nwithout explanation or precedent--that it could happen at all within the\r\nspace of five years seemed almost an intended cruelty, conceived and\r\nexecuted by a sardonic God. When they were married seventy-five hundred\r\na year had seemed ample for a young couple, especially when augmented by\r\nthe expectation of many millions. Gloria had failed to realize that it\r\nwas decreasing not only in amount but in purchasing power until the\r\npayment of Mr. Haight\'s retaining fee of fifteen thousand dollars made\r\nthe fact suddenly and startlingly obvious. When Anthony was drafted they\r\nhad calculated their income at over four hundred a month, with the\r\ndollar even then decreasing in value, but on his return to New York they\r\ndiscovered an even more alarming condition of affairs. They were\r\nreceiving only forty-five hundred a year from their investments. And\r\nthough the suit over the will moved ahead of them like a persistent\r\nmirage and the financial danger-mark loomed up in the near distance they\r\nfound, nevertheless, that living within their income was impossible.\r\n\r\nSo Gloria went without the squirrel coat and every day upon Fifth Avenue\r\nshe was a little conscious of her well-worn, half-length leopard skin,\r\nnow hopelessly old-fashioned. Every other month they sold a bond, yet\r\nwhen the bills were paid it left only enough to be gulped down hungrily\r\nby their current expenses. Anthony\'s calculations showed that their\r\ncapital would last about seven years longer. So Gloria\'s heart was very\r\nbitter, for in one week, on a prolonged hysterical party during which\r\nAnthony whimsically divested himself of coat, vest, and shirt in a\r\ntheatre and was assisted out by a posse of ushers, they spent twice what\r\nthe gray squirrel coat would have cost.\r\n\r\nIt was November, Indian summer rather, and a warm, warm night--which was\r\nunnecessary, for the work of the summer was done. Babe Ruth had smashed\r\nthe home-run record for the first time and Jack Dempsey had broken Jess\r\nWillard\'s cheek-bone out in Ohio. Over in Europe the usual number of\r\nchildren had swollen stomachs from starvation, and the diplomats were at\r\ntheir customary business of making the world safe for new wars. In New\r\nYork City the proletariat were being "disciplined," and the odds on\r\nHarvard were generally quoted at five to three. Peace had come down in\r\nearnest, the beginning of new days.\r\n\r\nUp in the bedroom of the apartment on Fifty-seventh Street Gloria lay\r\nupon her bed and tossed from side to side, sitting up at intervals to\r\nthrow off a superfluous cover and once asking Anthony, who was lying\r\nawake beside her, to bring her a glass of ice-water. "Be sure and put\r\nice in it," she said with insistence; "it isn\'t cold enough the way it\r\ncomes from the faucet."\r\n\r\nLooking through the frail curtains she could see the rounded moon over\r\nthe roofs and beyond it on the sky the yellow glow from Times\r\nSquare--and watching the two incongruous lights, her mind worked over an\r\nemotion, or rather an interwoven complex of emotions, that had occupied\r\nit through the day, and the day before that and back to the last time\r\nwhen she could remember having thought clearly and consecutively about\r\nanything--which must have been while Anthony was in the army.\r\n\r\nShe would be twenty-nine in February. The month assumed an ominous and\r\ninescapable significance--making her wonder, through these nebulous\r\nhalf-fevered hours whether after all she had not wasted her faintly\r\ntired beauty, whether there was such a thing as use for any quality\r\nbounded by a harsh and inevitable mortality.\r\n\r\nYears before, when she was twenty-one, she had written in her diary:\r\n"Beauty is only to be admired, only to be loved--to be harvested\r\ncarefully and then flung at a chosen lover like a gift of roses. It\r\nseems to me, so far as I can judge clearly at all, that my beauty should\r\nbe used like that...."\r\n\r\nAnd now, all this November day, all this desolate day, under a sky dirty\r\nand white, Gloria had been thinking that perhaps she had been wrong. To\r\npreserve the integrity of her first gift she had looked no more for\r\nlove. When the first flame and ecstasy had grown dim, sunk down,\r\ndeparted, she had begun preserving--what? It puzzled her that she no\r\nlonger knew just what she was preserving--a sentimental memory or some\r\nprofound and fundamental concept of honor. She was doubting now whether\r\nthere had been any moral issue involved in her way of life--to walk\r\nunworried and unregretful along the gayest of all possible lanes and to\r\nkeep her pride by being always herself and doing what it seemed\r\nbeautiful that she should do. From the first little boy in an Eton\r\ncollar whose "girl" she had been, down to the latest casual man whose\r\neyes had grown alert and appreciative as they rested upon her, there was\r\nneeded only that matchless candor she could throw into a look or clothe\r\nwith an inconsequent clause--for she had talked always in broken\r\nclauses--to weave about her immeasurable illusions, immeasurable\r\ndistances, immeasurable light. To create souls in men, to create fine\r\nhappiness and fine despair she must remain deeply proud--proud to be\r\ninviolate, proud also to be melting, to be passionate and possessed.\r\n\r\nShe knew that in her breast she had never wanted children. The reality,\r\nthe earthiness, the intolerable sentiment of child-bearing, the menace\r\nto her beauty--had appalled her. She wanted to exist only as a conscious\r\nflower, prolonging and preserving itself. Her sentimentality could cling\r\nfiercely to her own illusions, but her ironic soul whispered that\r\nmotherhood was also the privilege of the female baboon. So her dreams\r\nwere of ghostly children only--the early, the perfect symbols of her\r\nearly and perfect love for Anthony.\r\n\r\nIn the end then, her beauty was all that never failed her. She had never\r\nseen beauty like her own. What it meant ethically or aesthetically faded\r\nbefore the gorgeous concreteness of her pink-and-white feet, the clean\r\nperfectness of her body, and the baby mouth that was like the material\r\nsymbol of a kiss.\r\n\r\nShe would be twenty-nine in February. As the long night waned she grew\r\nsupremely conscious that she and beauty were going to make use of these\r\nnext three months. At first she was not sure for what, but the problem\r\nresolved itself gradually into the old lure of the screen. She was in\r\nearnest now. No material want could have moved her as this fear moved\r\nher. No matter for Anthony, Anthony the poor in spirit, the weak and\r\nbroken man with bloodshot eyes, for whom she still had moments of\r\ntenderness. No matter. She would be twenty-nine in February--a hundred\r\ndays, so many days; she would go to Bloeckman to-morrow.\r\n\r\nWith the decision came relief. It cheered her that in some manner the\r\nillusion of beauty could be sustained, or preserved perhaps in celluloid\r\nafter the reality had vanished. Well--to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe next day she felt weak and ill. She tried to go out, and saved\r\nherself from collapse only by clinging to a mail box near the front\r\ndoor. The Martinique elevator boy helped her up-stairs, and she waited\r\non the bed for Anthony\'s return without energy to unhook her brassiere.\r\n\r\nFor five days she was down with influenza, which, just as the month\r\nturned the corner into winter, ripened into double pneumonia. In the\r\nfeverish perambulations of her mind she prowled through a house of bleak\r\nunlighted rooms hunting for her mother. All she wanted was to be a\r\nlittle girl, to be efficiently taken care of by some yielding yet\r\nsuperior power, stupider and steadier than herself. It seemed that the\r\nonly lover she had ever wanted was a lover in a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n"ODI PROFANUM VULGUS"\r\n\r\nOne day in the midst of Gloria\'s illness there occurred a curious\r\nincident that puzzled Miss McGovern, the trained nurse, for some time\r\nafterward. It was noon, but the room in which the patient lay was dark\r\nand quiet. Miss McGovern was standing near the bed mixing some medicine,\r\nwhen Mrs. Patch, who had apparently been sound asleep, sat up and began\r\nto speak vehemently:\r\n\r\n"Millions of people," she said, "swarming like rats, chattering like\r\napes, smelling like all hell ... monkeys! Or lice, I suppose. For one\r\nreally exquisite palace ... on Long Island, say--or even in Greenwich ...\r\nfor one palace full of pictures from the Old World and exquisite\r\nthings--with avenues of trees and green lawns and a view of the blue\r\nsea, and lovely people about in slick dresses ... I\'d sacrifice a\r\nhundred thousand of them, a million of them." She raised her hand feebly\r\nand snapped her fingers. "I care nothing for them--understand me?"\r\n\r\nThe look she bent upon Miss McGovern at the conclusion of this speech\r\nwas curiously elfin, curiously intent. Then she gave a short little\r\nlaugh polished with scorn, and tumbling backward fell off again\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\nMiss McGovern was bewildered. She wondered what were the hundred\r\nthousand things that Mrs. Patch would sacrifice for her palace. Dollars,\r\nshe supposed--yet it had not sounded exactly like dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIES\r\n\r\nIt was February, seven days before her birthday, and the great snow that\r\nhad filled up the cross-streets as dirt fills the cracks in a floor had\r\nturned to slush and was being escorted to the gutters by the hoses of\r\nthe street-cleaning department. The wind, none the less bitter for being\r\ncasual, whipped in through the open windows of the living room bearing\r\nwith it the dismal secrets of the areaway and clearing the Patch\r\napartment of stale smoke in its cheerless circulation.\r\n\r\nGloria, wrapped in a warm kimona, came into the chilly room and taking\r\nup the telephone receiver called Joseph Bloeckman.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean Mr. Joseph _Black_?" demanded the telephone girl at "Films\r\nPar Excellence."\r\n\r\n"Bloeckman, Joseph Bloeckman. B-l-o--"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Joseph Bloeckman has changed his name to Black. Do you want him?"\r\n\r\n"Why--yes." She remembered nervously that she had once called him\r\n"Blockhead" to his face.\r\n\r\nHis office was reached by courtesy of two additional female voices; the\r\nlast was a secretary who took her name. Only with the flow through the\r\ntransmitter of his own familiar but faintly impersonal tone did she\r\nrealize that it had been three years since they had met. And he had\r\nchanged his name to Black.\r\n\r\n"Can you see me?" she suggested lightly. "It\'s on a business matter,\r\nreally. I\'m going into the movies at last--if I can."\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully glad. I\'ve always thought you\'d like it."\r\n\r\n"Do you think you can get me a trial?" she demanded with the arrogance\r\npeculiar to all beautiful women, to all women who have ever at any time\r\nconsidered themselves beautiful.\r\n\r\nHe assured her that it was merely a question of when she wanted the\r\ntrial. Any time? Well, he\'d phone later in the day and let her know a\r\nconvenient hour. The conversation closed with conventional padding on\r\nboth sides. Then from three o\'clock to five she sat close to the\r\ntelephone--with no result.\r\n\r\nBut next morning came a note that contented and excited her:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_My dear Gloria:_\r\n\r\n_Just by luck a matter came to my attention that I think will be just\r\nsuited to you. I would like to see you start with something that would\r\nbring you notice. At the same time if a very beautiful girl of your sort\r\nis put directly into a picture next to one of the rather shop-worn stars\r\nwith which every company is afflicted, tongues would very likely wag.\r\nBut there is a "flapper" part in a Percy B. Debris production that I\r\nthink would be just suited to you and would bring you notice. Willa\r\nSable plays opposite Gaston Mears in a sort of character part and your\r\npart I believe would be her younger sister._\r\n\r\n_Anyway Percy B. Debris who is directing the picture says if you\'ll come\r\nto the studios day after to-morrow (Thursday) he will run off a test. If\r\nten o\'clock is suited to you I will meet you there at that time._\r\n\r\n_With all good wishes_\r\n\r\n_Ever Faithfully_\r\n\r\nJOSEPH BLACK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGloria had decided that Anthony was to know nothing of this until she\r\nhad obtained a definite position, and accordingly she was dressed and\r\nout of the apartment next morning before he awoke. Her mirror had given\r\nher, she thought, much the same account as ever. She wondered if there\r\nwere any lingering traces of her sickness. She was still slightly under\r\nweight, and she had fancied, a few days before, that her cheeks were a\r\ntrifle thinner--but she felt that those were merely transitory\r\nconditions and that on this particular day she looked as fresh as ever.\r\nShe had bought and charged a new hat, and as the day was warm she had\r\nleft the leopard skin coat at home.\r\n\r\nAt the "Films Par Excellence" studios she was announced over the\r\ntelephone and told that Mr. Black would be down directly. She looked\r\naround her. Two girls were being shown about by a little fat man in a\r\nslash-pocket coat, and one of them had indicated a stack of thin\r\nparcels, piled breast-high against the wall, and extending along for\r\ntwenty feet.\r\n\r\n"That\'s studio mail," explained the fat man. "Pictures of the stars who\r\nare with \'Films Par Excellence.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\n"Each one\'s autographed by Florence Kelley or Gaston Mears or Mack\r\nDodge--" He winked confidentially. "At least when Minnie McGlook out in\r\nSauk Center gets the picture she wrote for, she _thinks_ it\'s\r\nautographed."\r\n\r\n"Just a stamp?"\r\n\r\n"Sure. It\'d take \'em a good eight-hour day to autograph half of \'em.\r\nThey say Mary Pickford\'s studio mail costs her fifty thousand a year."\r\n\r\n"Say!"\r\n\r\n"Sure. Fifty thousand. But it\'s the best kinda advertising there is--"\r\n\r\nThey drifted out of earshot and almost immediately Bloeckman\r\nappeared--Bloeckman, a dark suave gentleman, gracefully engaged in the\r\nmiddle forties, who greeted her with courteous warmth and told her she\r\nhad not changed a bit in three years. He led the way into a great hall,\r\nas large as an armory and broken intermittently with busy sets and\r\nblinding rows of unfamiliar light. Each piece of scenery was marked in\r\nlarge white letters "Gaston Mears Company," "Mack Dodge Company," or\r\nsimply "Films Par Excellence."\r\n\r\n"Ever been in a studio before?"\r\n\r\n"Never have."\r\n\r\nShe liked it. There was no heavy closeness of greasepaint, no scent of\r\nsoiled and tawdry costumes which years before had revolted her behind\r\nthe scenes of a musical comedy. This work was done in the clean\r\nmornings; the appurtenances seemed rich and gorgeous and new. On a set\r\nthat was joyous with Manchu hangings a perfect Chinaman was going\r\nthrough a scene according to megaphone directions as the great\r\nglittering machine ground out its ancient moral tale for the edification\r\nof the national mind.\r\n\r\nA red-headed man approached them and spoke with familiar deference to\r\nBloeckman, who answered:\r\n\r\n"Hello, Debris. Want you to meet Mrs. Patch.... Mrs. Patch wants to go\r\ninto pictures, as I explained to you.... All right, now, where do\r\nwe go?"\r\n\r\nMr. Debris--the great Percy B. Debris, thought Gloria--showed them to a\r\nset which represented the interior of an office. Some chairs were drawn\r\nup around the camera, which stood in front of it, and the three of\r\nthem sat down.\r\n\r\n"Ever been in a studio before?" asked Mr. Debris, giving her a glance\r\nthat was surely the quintessence of keenness. "No? Well, I\'ll explain\r\nexactly what\'s going to happen. We\'re going to take what we call a test\r\nin order to see how your features photograph and whether you\'ve got\r\nnatural stage presence and how you respond to coaching. There\'s no need\r\nto be nervous over it. I\'ll just have the camera-man take a few hundred\r\nfeet in an episode I\'ve got marked here in the scenario. We can tell\r\npretty much what we want to from that."\r\n\r\nHe produced a typewritten continuity and explained to her the episode\r\nshe was to enact. It developed that one Barbara Wainwright had been\r\nsecretly married to the junior partner of the firm whose office was\r\nthere represented. Entering the deserted office one day by accident she\r\nwas naturally interested in seeing where her husband worked. The\r\ntelephone rang and after some hesitation she answered it. She learned\r\nthat her husband had been struck by an automobile and instantly killed.\r\nShe was overcome. At first she was unable to realize the truth, but\r\nfinally she succeeded in comprehending it, and went into a dead faint on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n"Now that\'s all we want," concluded Mr. Debris. "I\'m going to stand here\r\nand tell you approximately what to do, and you\'re to act as though I\r\nwasn\'t here, and just go on do it your own way. You needn\'t be afraid\r\nwe\'re going to judge this too severely. We simply want to get a general\r\nidea of your screen personality."\r\n\r\n"I see."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find make-up in the room in back of the set. Go light on it.\r\nVery little red."\r\n\r\n"I see," repeated Gloria, nodding. She touched her lips nervously with\r\nthe tip of her tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEST\r\n\r\nAs she came into the set through the real wooden door and closed it\r\ncarefully behind her, she found herself inconveniently dissatisfied with\r\nher clothes. She should have bought a "misses\'" dress for the\r\noccasion--she could still wear them, and it might have been a good\r\ninvestment if it had accentuated her airy youth.\r\n\r\nHer mind snapped sharply into the momentous present as Mr. Debris\'s\r\nvoice came from the glare of the white lights in front.\r\n\r\n"You look around for your husband.... Now--you don\'t see him ... you\'re\r\ncurious about the office...."\r\n\r\nShe became conscious of the regular sound of the camera. It worried her.\r\nShe glanced toward it involuntarily and wondered if she had made up her\r\nface correctly. Then, with a definite effort she forced herself to\r\nact--and she had never felt that the gestures of her body were so banal,\r\nso awkward, so bereft of grace or distinction. She strolled around the\r\noffice, picking up articles here and there and looking at them inanely.\r\nThen she scrutinized the ceiling, the floor, and thoroughly inspected an\r\ninconsequential lead pencil on the desk. Finally, because she could\r\nthink of nothing else to do, and less than nothing to express, she\r\nforced a smile.\r\n\r\n"All right. Now the phone rings. Ting-a-ling-a-ling! Hesitate, and then\r\nanswer it."\r\n\r\nShe hesitated--and then, too quickly, she thought, picked up the\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\n"Hello."\r\n\r\nHer voice was hollow and unreal. The words rang in the empty set like\r\nthe ineffectualities of a ghost. The absurdities of their requirements\r\nappalled her--Did they expect that on an instant\'s notice she could put\r\nherself in the place of this preposterous and unexplained character?\r\n\r\n"... No ... no.... Not yet! Now listen: \'John Sumner has just been\r\nknocked over by an automobile and instantly killed!\'"\r\n\r\nGloria let her baby mouth drop slowly open. Then:\r\n\r\n"Now hang up! With a bang!"\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, clung to the table with her eyes wide and staring. At length\r\nshe was feeling slightly encouraged and her confidence increased.\r\n\r\n"My God!" she cried. Her voice was good, she thought. "Oh, my God!"\r\n\r\n"Now faint."\r\n\r\nShe collapsed forward to her knees and throwing her body outward on the\r\nground lay without breathing.\r\n\r\n"All right!" called Mr. Debris. "That\'s enough, thank you. That\'s\r\nplenty. Get up--that\'s enough."\r\n\r\nGloria arose, mustering her dignity and brushing off her skirt.\r\n\r\n"Awful!" she remarked with a cool laugh, though her heart was bumping\r\ntumultuously. "Terrible, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Did you mind it?" said Mr. Debris, smiling blandly. "Did it seem hard?\r\nI can\'t tell anything about it until I have it run off."\r\n\r\n"Of course not," she agreed, trying to attach some sort of meaning to\r\nhis remark--and failing. It was just the sort of thing he would have\r\nsaid had he been trying not to encourage her.\r\n\r\nA few moments later she left the studio. Bloeckman had promised that she\r\nshould hear the result of the test within the next few days. Too proud\r\nto force any definite comment she felt a baffling uncertainty and only\r\nnow when the step had at last been taken did she realize how the\r\npossibility of a successful screen career had played in the back of her\r\nmind for the past three years. That night she tried to tell over to\r\nherself the elements that might decide for or against her. Whether or\r\nnot she had used enough make-up worried her, and as the part was that of\r\na girl of twenty, she wondered if she had not been just a little too\r\ngrave. About her acting she was least of all satisfied. Her entrance had\r\nbeen abominable--in fact not until she reached the phone had she\r\ndisplayed a shred of poise--and then the test had been over. If they had\r\nonly realized! She wished that she could try it again. A mad plan to\r\ncall up in the morning and ask for a new trial took possession of her,\r\nand as suddenly faded. It seemed neither politic nor polite to ask\r\nanother favor of Bloeckman.\r\n\r\nThe third day of waiting found her in a highly nervous condition. She\r\nhad bitten the insides of her mouth until they were raw and smarting,\r\nand burnt unbearably when she washed them with listerine. She had\r\nquarrelled so persistently with Anthony that he had left the apartment\r\nin a cold fury. But because he was intimidated by her exceptional\r\nfrigidity, he called up an hour afterward, apologized and said he was\r\nhaving dinner at the Amsterdam Club, the only one in which he still\r\nretained membership.\r\n\r\nIt was after one o\'clock and she had breakfasted at eleven, so, deciding\r\nto forego luncheon, she started for a walk in the Park. At three there\r\nwould be a mail. She would be back by three.\r\n\r\nIt was an afternoon of premature spring. Water was drying on the walks\r\nand in the Park little girls were gravely wheeling white doll-buggies up\r\nand down under the thin trees while behind them followed bored\r\nnursery-maids in two\'s, discussing with each other those tremendous\r\nsecrets that are peculiar to nursery-maids.\r\n\r\nTwo o\'clock by her little gold watch. She should have a new watch, one\r\nmade in a platinum oblong and incrusted with diamonds--but those cost\r\neven more than squirrel coats and of course they were out of her reach\r\nnow, like everything else--unless perhaps the right letter was awaiting\r\nher ... in about an hour ... fifty-eight minutes exactly. Ten to get\r\nthere left forty-eight ... forty-seven now ...\r\n\r\nLittle girls soberly wheeling their buggies along the damp sunny walks.\r\nThe nursery-maids chattering in pairs about their inscrutable secrets.\r\nHere and there a raggedy man seated upon newspapers spread on a drying\r\nbench, related not to the radiant and delightful afternoon but to the\r\ndirty snow that slept exhausted in obscure corners, waiting for\r\nextermination....\r\n\r\nAges later, coming into the dim hall she saw the Martinique elevator boy\r\nstanding incongruously in the light of the stained-glass window.\r\n\r\n"Is there any mail for us?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Up-stays, madame."\r\n\r\nThe switchboard squawked abominably and Gloria waited while he\r\nministered to the telephone. She sickened as the elevator groaned its\r\nway up--the floors passed like the slow lapse of centuries, each one\r\nominous, accusing, significant. The letter, a white leprous spot, lay\r\nupon the dirty tiles of the hall....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_My dear Gloria:_\r\n\r\n_We had the test run off yesterday afternoon, and Mr. Debris seemed to\r\nthink that for the part he had in mind he needed a younger woman. He\r\nsaid that the acting was not bad, and that there was a small character\r\npart supposed to be a very haughty rich widow that he thought\r\nyou might----_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDesolately Gloria raised her glance until it fell out across the\r\nareaway. But she found she could not see the opposite wall, for her gray\r\neyes were full of tears. She walked into the bedroom, the letter\r\ncrinkled tightly in her hand, and sank down upon her knees before the\r\nlong mirror on the wardrobe floor. This was her twenty-ninth birthday,\r\nand the world was melting away before her eyes. She tried to think that\r\nit had been the make-up, but her emotions were too profound, too\r\noverwhelming for any consolation that the thought conveyed.\r\n\r\nShe strained to see until she could feel the flesh on her temples pull\r\nforward. Yes--the cheeks were ever so faintly thin, the corners of the\r\neyes were lined with tiny wrinkles. The eyes were different. Why, they\r\nwere different! ... And then suddenly she knew how tired her eyes were.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my pretty face," she whispered, passionately grieving. "Oh, my\r\npretty face! Oh, I don\'t want to live without my pretty face! Oh, what\'s\r\n_happened?_"\r\n\r\nThen she slid toward the mirror and, as in the test, sprawled face\r\ndownward upon the floor--and lay there sobbing. It was the first awkward\r\nmovement she had ever made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nNO MATTER!\r\n\r\nWithin another year Anthony and Gloria had become like players who had\r\nlost their costumes, lacking the pride to continue on the note of\r\ntragedy--so that when Mrs. and Miss Hulme of Kansas City cut them dead\r\nin the Plaza one evening, it was only that Mrs. and Miss Hulme, like\r\nmost people, abominated mirrors of their atavistic selves.\r\n\r\nTheir new apartment, for which they paid eighty-five dollars a month,\r\nwas situated on Claremont Avenue, which is two blocks from the Hudson in\r\nthe dim hundreds. They had lived there a month when Muriel Kane came to\r\nsee them late one afternoon.\r\n\r\nIt was a reproachless twilight on the summer side of spring. Anthony lay\r\nupon the lounge looking up One Hundred and Twenty-seventh Street toward\r\nthe river, near which he could just see a single patch of vivid green\r\ntrees that guaranteed the brummagem umbrageousness of Riverside Drive.\r\nAcross the water were the Palisades, crowned by the ugly framework of\r\nthe amusement park--yet soon it would be dusk and those same iron\r\ncobwebs would be a glory against the heavens, an enchanted palace set\r\nover the smooth radiance of a tropical canal.\r\n\r\nThe streets near the apartment, Anthony had found, were streets where\r\nchildren played--streets a little nicer than those he had been used to\r\npass on his way to Marietta, but of the same general sort, with an\r\noccasional hand organ or hurdy-gurdy, and in the cool of the evening\r\nmany pairs of young girls walking down to the corner drug-store for ice\r\ncream soda and dreaming unlimited dreams under the low heavens.\r\n\r\nDusk in the streets now, and children playing, shouting up incoherent\r\necstatic words that faded out close to the open window--and Muriel, who\r\nhad come to find Gloria, chattering to him from an opaque gloom over\r\nacross the room.\r\n\r\n"Light the lamp, why don\'t we?" she suggested. "It\'s getting _ghostly_\r\nin here."\r\n\r\nWith a tired movement he arose and obeyed; the gray window-panes\r\nvanished. He stretched himself. He was heavier now, his stomach was a\r\nlimp weight against his belt; his flesh had softened and expanded. He\r\nwas thirty-two and his mind was a bleak and disordered wreck.\r\n\r\n"Have a little drink, Muriel?"\r\n\r\n"Not me, thanks. I don\'t use it anymore. What\'re you doing these days,\r\nAnthony?" she asked curiously.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve been pretty busy with this lawsuit," he answered\r\nindifferently. "It\'s gone to the Court of Appeals--ought to be settled\r\nup one way or another by autumn. There\'s been some objection as to\r\nwhether the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over the matter."\r\n\r\nMuriel made a clicking sound with her tongue and cocked her head on one\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"Well, you tell\'em! I never heard of anything taking so long."\r\n\r\n"Oh, they all do," he replied listlessly; "all will cases. They say it\'s\r\nexceptional to have one settled under four or five years."\r\n\r\n"Oh ..." Muriel daringly changed her tack, "why don\'t you go to work,\r\nyou la-azy!"\r\n\r\n"At what?" he demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Why, at anything, I suppose. You\'re still a young man."\r\n\r\n"If that\'s encouragement, I\'m much obliged," he answered dryly--and then\r\nwith sudden weariness: "Does it bother you particularly that I don\'t\r\nwant to work?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t bother me--but, it does bother a lot of people who claim--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, God!" he said brokenly, "it seems to me that for three years I\'ve\r\nheard nothing about myself but wild stories and virtuous admonitions.\r\nI\'m tired of it. If you don\'t want to see us, let us alone. I don\'t\r\nbother my former friends. But I need no charity calls, and no criticism\r\ndisguised as good advice--" Then he added apologetically: "I\'m\r\nsorry--but really, Muriel, you mustn\'t talk like a lady slum-worker even\r\nif you are visiting the lower middle classes." He turned his bloodshot\r\neyes on her reproachfully--eyes that had once been a deep, clear blue,\r\nthat were weak now, strained, and half-ruined from reading when he\r\nwas drunk.\r\n\r\n"Why do you say such awful things?" she protested. You talk as if you\r\nand Gloria were in the middle classes."\r\n\r\n"Why pretend we\'re not? I hate people who claim to be great aristocrats\r\nwhen they can\'t even keep up the appearances of it."\r\n\r\n"Do you think a person has to have money to be aristocratic?"\r\n\r\nMuriel ... the horrified democrat ...!\r\n\r\n"Why, of course. Aristocracy\'s only an admission that certain traits\r\nwhich we call fine--courage and honor and beauty and all that sort of\r\nthing--can best be developed in a favorable environment, where you don\'t\r\nhave the warpings of ignorance and necessity."\r\n\r\nMuriel bit her lower lip and waved her head from side to side.\r\n\r\n"Well, all _I_ say is that if a person comes from a good family they\'re\r\nalways nice people. That\'s the trouble with you and Gloria. You think\r\nthat just because things aren\'t going your way right now all your old\r\nfriends are trying to avoid you. You\'re too sensitive--"\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact," said Anthony, "you know nothing at all about it.\r\nWith me it\'s simply a matter of pride, and for once Gloria\'s reasonable\r\nenough to agree that we oughtn\'t go where we\'re not wanted. And people\r\ndon\'t want us. We\'re too much the ideal bad examples."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! You can\'t park your pessimism in my little sun parlor. I\r\nthink you ought to forget all those morbid speculations and go to work."\r\n\r\n"Here I am, thirty-two. Suppose I did start in at some idiotic business.\r\nPerhaps in two years I might rise to fifty dollars a week--with luck.\r\nThat\'s _if_ I could get a job at all; there\'s an awful lot of\r\nunemployment. Well, suppose I made fifty a week. Do you think I\'d be any\r\nhappier? Do you think that if I don\'t get this money of my grandfather\'s\r\nlife will be _endurable?_"\r\n\r\nMuriel smiled complacently.\r\n\r\n"Well," she said, "that may be clever but it isn\'t common sense."\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Gloria came in seeming to bring with her into the\r\nroom some dark color, indeterminate and rare. In a taciturn way she was\r\nhappy to see Muriel. She greeted Anthony with a casual "Hi!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been talking philosophy with your husband," cried the\r\nirrepressible Miss Kane.\r\n\r\n"We took up some fundamental concepts," said Anthony, a faint smile\r\ndisturbing his pale cheeks, paler still under two days\' growth of beard.\r\n\r\nOblivious to his irony Muriel rehashed her contention. When she had\r\ndone, Gloria said quietly:\r\n\r\n"Anthony\'s right. It\'s no fun to go around when you have the sense that\r\npeople are looking at you in a certain way."\r\n\r\nHe broke in plaintively:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think that when even Maury Noble, who was my best friend,\r\nwon\'t come to see us it\'s high time to stop calling people up?" Tears\r\nwere standing in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"That was your fault about Maury Noble," said Gloria coolly.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"It most certainly was."\r\n\r\nMuriel intervened quickly:\r\n\r\n"I met a girl who knew Maury, the other day, and she says he doesn\'t\r\ndrink any more. He\'s getting pretty cagey."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Practically not at all. He\'s making _piles_ of money. He\'s sort of\r\nchanged since the war. He\'s going to marry a girl in Philadelphia who\r\nhas millions, Ceci Larrabee--anyhow, that\'s what Town Tattle said."\r\n\r\n"He\'s thirty-three," said Anthony, thinking aloud. But it\'s odd to\r\nimagine his getting married. I used to think he was so brilliant."\r\n\r\n"He was," murmured Gloria, "in a way."\r\n\r\n"But brilliant people don\'t settle down in business--or do they? Or what\r\ndo they do? Or what becomes of everybody you used to know and have so\r\nmuch in common with?"\r\n\r\n"You drift apart," suggested Muriel with the appropriate dreamy look.\r\n\r\n"They change," said Gloria. "All the qualities that they don\'t use in\r\ntheir daily lives get cobwebbed up."\r\n\r\n"The last thing he said to me," recollected Anthony, "was that he was\r\ngoing to work so as to forget that there was nothing worth working for."\r\n\r\nMuriel caught at this quickly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what _you_ ought to do," she exclaimed triumphantly. "Of course\r\nI shouldn\'t think anybody would want to work for nothing. But it\'d give\r\nyou something to do. What do you do with yourselves, anyway? Nobody ever\r\nsees you at Montmartre or--or anywhere. Are you economizing?"\r\n\r\nGloria laughed scornfully, glancing at Anthony from the corners of her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Well," he demanded, "what are you laughing at?"\r\n\r\n"You know what I\'m laughing at," she answered coldly.\r\n\r\n"At that case of whiskey?"\r\n\r\n"Yes"--she turned to Muriel--"he paid seventy-five dollars for a case of\r\nwhiskey yesterday."\r\n\r\n"What if I did? It\'s cheaper that way than if you get it by the bottle.\r\nYou needn\'t pretend that you won\'t drink any of it."\r\n\r\n"At least I don\'t drink in the daytime."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a fine distinction!" he cried, springing to his feet in a weak\r\nrage. "What\'s more, I\'ll be damned if you can hurl that at me every\r\nfew minutes!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s true."\r\n\r\n"It is _not!_ And I\'m getting sick of this eternal business of\r\ncriticising me before visitors!" He had worked himself up to such a\r\nstate that his arms and shoulders were visibly trembling. "You\'d think\r\neverything was my fault. You\'d think you hadn\'t encouraged me to spend\r\nmoney--and spent a lot more on yourself than I ever did by a long shot."\r\n\r\nNow Gloria rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n"I _won\'t_ let you talk to me that way!"\r\n\r\n"All right, then; by Heaven, you don\'t have to!"\r\n\r\nIn a sort of rush he left the room. The two women heard his steps in the\r\nhall and then the front door banged. Gloria sank back into her chair.\r\nHer face was lovely in the lamplight, composed, inscrutable.\r\n\r\n"Oh--!" cried Muriel in distress. "Oh, what _is_ the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing particularly. He\'s just drunk."\r\n\r\n"Drunk? Why, he\'s perfectly sober. He talked----"\r\n\r\nGloria shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, he doesn\'t show it any more unless he can hardly stand up, and\r\nhe talks all right until he gets excited. He talks much better than he\r\ndoes when he\'s sober. But he\'s been sitting here all day\r\ndrinking--except for the time it took him to walk to the corner for a\r\nnewspaper."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how terrible!" Muriel was sincerely moved. Her eyes filled with\r\ntears. "Has this happened much?"\r\n\r\n"Drinking, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"No, this--leaving you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Frequently. He\'ll come in about midnight--and weep and ask me\r\nto forgive him."\r\n\r\n"And do you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. We just go on."\r\n\r\nThe two women sat there in the lamplight and looked at each other, each\r\nin a different way helpless before this thing. Gloria was still pretty,\r\nas pretty as she would ever be again--her cheeks were flushed and she\r\nwas wearing a new dress that she had bought--imprudently--for fifty\r\ndollars. She had hoped she could persuade Anthony to take her out\r\nto-night, to a restaurant or even to one of the great, gorgeous moving\r\npicture palaces where there would be a few people to look at her, at\r\nwhom she could bear to look in turn. She wanted this because she knew\r\nher cheeks were flushed and because her dress was new and becomingly\r\nfragile. Only very occasionally, now, did they receive any invitations.\r\nBut she did not tell these things to Muriel.\r\n\r\n"Gloria, dear, I wish we could have dinner together, but I promised a\r\nman and it\'s seven-thirty already. I\'ve got to _tear_."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I couldn\'t, anyway. In the first place I\'ve been ill all day. I\r\ncouldn\'t eat a thing."\r\n\r\nAfter she had walked with Muriel to the door, Gloria came back into the\r\nroom, turned out the lamp, and leaning her elbows on the window sill\r\nlooked out at Palisades Park, where the brilliant revolving circle of\r\nthe Ferris wheel was like a trembling mirror catching the yellow\r\nreflection of the moon. The street was quiet now; the children had gone\r\nin--over the way she could see a family at dinner. Pointlessly,\r\nridiculously, they rose and walked about the table; seen thus, all that\r\nthey did appeared incongruous--it was as though they were being jiggled\r\ncarelessly and to no purpose by invisible overhead wires.\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch--it was eight o\'clock. She had been pleased for\r\na part of the day--the early afternoon--in walking along that Broadway\r\nof Harlem, One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, with her nostrils alert\r\nto many odors, and her mind excited by the extraordinary beauty of some\r\nItalian children. It affected her curiously--as Fifth Avenue had\r\naffected her once, in the days when, with the placid confidence of\r\nbeauty, she had known that it was all hers, every shop and all it held,\r\nevery adult toy glittering in a window, all hers for the asking. Here on\r\nOne Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street there were Salvation Army bands and\r\nspectrum-shawled old ladies on door-steps and sugary, sticky candy in\r\nthe grimy hands of shiny-haired children--and the late sun striking down\r\non the sides of the tall tenements. All very rich and racy and savory,\r\nlike a dish by a provident French chef that one could not help enjoying,\r\neven though one knew that the ingredients were probably left-overs....\r\n\r\nGloria shuddered suddenly as a river siren came moaning over the dusky\r\nroofs, and leaning back in till the ghostly curtains fell from her\r\nshoulder, she turned on the electric lamp. It was growing late. She knew\r\nthere was some change in her purse, and she considered whether she would\r\ngo down and have some coffee and rolls where the liberated subway made a\r\nroaring cave of Manhattan Street or eat the devilled ham and bread in\r\nthe kitchen. Her purse decided for her. It contained a nickel and\r\ntwo pennies.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour the silence of the room had grown unbearable, and she\r\nfound that her eyes were wandering from her magazine to the ceiling,\r\ntoward which she stared without thought. Suddenly she stood up,\r\nhesitated for a moment, biting at her finger--then she went to the\r\npantry, took down a bottle of whiskey from the shelf and poured herself\r\na drink. She filled up the glass with ginger ale, and returning to her\r\nchair finished an article in the magazine. It concerned the last\r\nrevolutionary widow, who, when a young girl, had married an ancient\r\nveteran of the Continental Army and who had died in 1906. It seemed\r\nstrange and oddly romantic to Gloria that she and this woman had been\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nShe turned a page and learned that a candidate for Congress was being\r\naccused of atheism by an opponent. Gloria\'s surprise vanished when she\r\nfound that the charges were false. The candidate had merely denied the\r\nmiracle of the loaves and fishes. He admitted, under pressure, that he\r\ngave full credence to the stroll upon the water.\r\n\r\nFinishing her first drink, Gloria got herself a second. After slipping\r\non a negligee and making herself comfortable on the lounge, she became\r\nconscious that she was miserable and that the tears were rolling down\r\nher cheeks. She wondered if they were tears of self-pity, and tried\r\nresolutely not to cry, but this existence without hope, without\r\nhappiness, oppressed her, and she kept shaking her head from side to\r\nside, her mouth drawn down tremulously in the corners, as though she\r\nwere denying an assertion made by some one, somewhere. She did not know\r\nthat this gesture of hers was years older than history, that, for a\r\nhundred generations of men, intolerable and persistent grief has offered\r\nthat gesture, of denial, of protest, of bewilderment, to something more\r\nprofound, more powerful than the God made in the image of man, and\r\nbefore which that God, did he exist, would be equally impotent. It is a\r\ntruth set at the heart of tragedy that this force never explains, never\r\nanswers--this force intangible as air, more definite than death.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD CARAMEL\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer Anthony resigned from his last club, the Amsterdam.\r\nHe had come to visit it hardly twice a year, and the dues were a\r\nrecurrent burden. He had joined it on his return from Italy because it\r\nhad been his grandfather\'s club and his father\'s, and because it was a\r\nclub that, given the opportunity, one indisputably joined--but as a\r\nmatter of fact he had preferred the Harvard Club, largely because of\r\nDick and Maury. However, with the decline of his fortunes, it had seemed\r\nan increasingly desirable bauble to cling to.... It was relinquished at\r\nthe last, with some regret....\r\n\r\nHis companions numbered now a curious dozen. Several of them he had met\r\nin a place called "Sammy\'s," on Forty-third Street, where, if one\r\nknocked on the door and were favorably passed on from behind a grating,\r\none could sit around a great round table drinking fairly good whiskey.\r\nIt was here that he encountered a man named Parker Allison, who had been\r\nexactly the wrong sort of rounder at Harvard, and who was running\r\nthrough a large "yeast" fortune as rapidly as possible. Parker Allison\'s\r\nnotion of distinction consisted in driving a noisy red-and-yellow\r\nracing-car up Broadway with two glittering, hard-eyed girls beside him.\r\nHe was the sort who dined with two girls rather than with one--his\r\nimagination was almost incapable of sustaining a dialogue.\r\n\r\nBesides Allison there was Pete Lytell, who wore a gray derby on the side\r\nof his head. He always had money and he was customarily cheerful, so\r\nAnthony held aimless, long-winded conversation with him through many\r\nafternoons of the summer and fall. Lytell, he found, not only talked but\r\nreasoned in phrases. His philosophy was a series of them, assimilated\r\nhere and there through an active, thoughtless life. He had phrases about\r\nSocialism--the immemorial ones; he had phrases pertaining to the\r\nexistence of a personal deity--something about one time when he had been\r\nin a railroad accident; and he had phrases about the Irish problem, the\r\nsort of woman he respected, and the futility of prohibition. The only\r\ntime his conversation ever rose superior to these muddled clauses, with\r\nwhich he interpreted the most rococo happenings in a life that had been\r\nmore than usually eventful, was when he got down to the detailed\r\ndiscussion of his most animal existence: he knew, to a subtlety, the\r\nfoods, the liquor, and the women that he preferred.\r\n\r\nHe was at once the commonest and the most remarkable product of\r\ncivilization. He was nine out of ten people that one passes on a city\r\nstreet--and he was a hairless ape with two dozen tricks. He was the hero\r\nof a thousand romances of life and art--and he was a virtual moron,\r\nperforming staidly yet absurdly a series of complicated and infinitely\r\nastounding epics over a span of threescore years.\r\n\r\nWith such men as these two Anthony Patch drank and discussed and drank\r\nand argued. He liked them because they knew nothing about him, because\r\nthey lived in the obvious and had not the faintest conception of the\r\ninevitable continuity of life. They sat not before a motion picture with\r\nconsecutive reels, but at a musty old-fashioned travelogue with all\r\nvalues stark and hence all implications confused. Yet they themselves\r\nwere not confused, because there was nothing in them to be\r\nconfused--they changed phrases from month to month as they\r\nchanged neckties.\r\n\r\nAnthony, the courteous, the subtle, the perspicacious, was drunk each\r\nday--in Sammy\'s with these men, in the apartment over a book, some book\r\nhe knew, and, very rarely, with Gloria, who, in his eyes, had begun to\r\ndevelop the unmistakable outlines of a quarrelsome and unreasonable\r\nwoman. She was not the Gloria of old, certainly--the Gloria who, had she\r\nbeen sick, would have preferred to inflict misery upon every one around\r\nher, rather than confess that she needed sympathy or assistance. She was\r\nnot above whining now; she was not above being sorry for herself. Each\r\nnight when she prepared for bed she smeared her face with some new\r\nunguent which she hoped illogically would give back the glow and\r\nfreshness to her vanishing beauty. When Anthony was drunk he taunted her\r\nabout this. When he was sober he was polite to her, on occasions even\r\ntender; he seemed to show for short hours a trace of that old quality of\r\nunderstanding too well to blame--that quality which was the best of him\r\nand had worked swiftly and ceaselessly toward his ruin.\r\n\r\nBut he hated to be sober. It made him conscious of the people around\r\nhim, of that air of struggle, of greedy ambition, of hope more sordid\r\nthan despair, of incessant passage up or down, which in every metropolis\r\nis most in evidence through the unstable middle class. Unable to live\r\nwith the rich he thought that his next choice would have been to live\r\nwith the very poor. Anything was better than this cup of perspiration\r\nand tears.\r\n\r\nThe sense of the enormous panorama of life, never strong in Anthony, had\r\nbecome dim almost to extinction. At long intervals now some incident,\r\nsome gesture of Gloria\'s, would take his fancy--but the gray veils had\r\ncome down in earnest upon him. As he grew older those things\r\nfaded--after that there was wine.\r\n\r\nThere was a kindliness about intoxication--there was that indescribable\r\ngloss and glamour it gave, like the memories of ephemeral and faded\r\nevenings. After a few high-balls there was magic in the tall glowing\r\nArabian night of the Bush Terminal Building--its summit a peak of sheer\r\ngrandeur, gold and dreaming against the inaccessible sky. And Wall\r\nStreet, the crass, the banal--again it was the triumph of gold, a\r\ngorgeous sentient spectacle; it was where the great kings kept the money\r\nfor their wars....\r\n\r\n... The fruit of youth or of the grape, the transitory magic of the\r\nbrief passage from darkness to darkness--the old illusion that truth and\r\nbeauty were in some way entwined.\r\n\r\nAs he stood in front of Delmonico\'s lighting a cigarette one night he\r\nsaw two hansoms drawn up close to the curb, waiting for a chance drunken\r\nfare. The outmoded cabs were worn and dirty--the cracked patent leather\r\nwrinkled like an old man\'s face, the cushions faded to a brownish\r\nlavender; the very horses were ancient and weary, and so were the\r\nwhite-haired men who sat aloft, cracking their whips with a grotesque\r\naffectation of gallantry. A relic of vanished gaiety!\r\n\r\nAnthony Patch walked away in a sudden fit of depression, pondering the\r\nbitterness of such survivals. There was nothing, it seemed, that grew\r\nstale so soon as pleasure.\r\n\r\nOn Forty-second Street one afternoon he met Richard Caramel for the\r\nfirst time in many months, a prosperous, fattening Richard Caramel,\r\nwhose face was filling out to match the Bostonian brow.\r\n\r\n"Just got in this week from the coast. Was going to call you up, but I\r\ndidn\'t know your new address."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve moved."\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel noticed that Anthony was wearing a soiled shirt, that\r\nhis cuffs were slightly but perceptibly frayed, that his eyes were set\r\nin half-moons the color of cigar smoke.\r\n\r\n"So I gathered," he said, fixing his friend with his bright-yellow eye.\r\n"But where and how is Gloria? My God, Anthony, I\'ve been hearing the\r\ndog-gonedest stories about you two even out in California--and when I\r\nget back to New York I find you\'ve sunk absolutely out of sight. Why\r\ndon\'t you pull yourself together?"\r\n\r\n"Now, listen," chattered Anthony unsteadily, "I can\'t stand a long\r\nlecture. We\'ve lost money in a dozen ways, and naturally people have\r\ntalked--on account of the lawsuit, but the thing\'s coming to a final\r\ndecision this winter, surely--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re talking so fast that I can\'t understand you," interrupted Dick\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve said all I\'m going to say," snapped Anthony. "Come and see\r\nus if you like--or don\'t!"\r\n\r\nWith this he turned and started to walk off in the crowd, but Dick\r\novertook him immediately and grasped his arm.\r\n\r\n"Say, Anthony, don\'t fly off the handle so easily! You know Gloria\'s my\r\ncousin, and you\'re one of my oldest friends, so it\'s natural for me to\r\nbe interested when I hear that you\'re going to the dogs--and taking her\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to be preached to."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, all right--How about coming up to my apartment and having a\r\ndrink? I\'ve just got settled. I\'ve bought three cases of Gordon gin from\r\na revenue officer."\r\n\r\nAs they walked along he continued in a burst of exasperation:\r\n\r\n"And how about your grandfather\'s money--you going to get it?"\r\n\r\n"Well," answered Anthony resentfully, "that old fool Haight seems\r\nhopeful, especially because people are tired of reformers right now--you\r\nknow it might make a slight difference, for instance, if some judge\r\nthought that Adam Patch made it harder for him to get liquor."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do without money," said Dick sententiously. "Have you tried\r\nto write any--lately?"\r\n\r\nAnthony shook his head silently.\r\n\r\n"That\'s funny," said Dick. "I always thought that you and Maury would\r\nwrite some day, and now he\'s grown to be a sort of tight-fisted\r\naristocrat, and you\'re--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m the bad example."\r\n\r\n"I wonder why?"\r\n\r\n"You probably think you know," suggested Anthony, with an effort at\r\nconcentration. "The failure and the success both believe in their hearts\r\nthat they have accurately balanced points of view, the success because\r\nhe\'s succeeded, and the failure because he\'s failed. The successful man\r\ntells his son to profit by his father\'s good fortune, and the failure\r\ntells _his_ son to profit by his father\'s mistakes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t agree with you," said the author of "A Shave-tail in France."\r\n"I used to listen to you and Maury when we were young, and I used to be\r\nimpressed because you were so consistently cynical, but now--well, after\r\nall, by God, which of us three has taken to the--to the intellectual\r\nlife? I don\'t want to sound vainglorious, but--it\'s me, and I\'ve always\r\nbelieved that moral values existed, and I always will."\r\n\r\n"Well," objected Anthony, who was rather enjoying himself, "even\r\ngranting that, you know that in practice life never presents problems as\r\nclear cut, does it?"\r\n\r\n"It does to me. There\'s nothing I\'d violate certain principles for."\r\n\r\n"But how do you know when you\'re violating them? You have to guess at\r\nthings just like most people do. You have to apportion the values when\r\nyou look back. You finish up the portrait then--paint in the details\r\nand shadows."\r\n\r\nDick shook his head with a lofty stubbornness. "Same old futile cynic,"\r\nhe said. "It\'s just a mode of being sorry for yourself. You don\'t do\r\nanything--so nothing matters."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m quite capable of self-pity," admitted Anthony, "nor am I\r\nclaiming that I\'m getting as much fun out of life as you are."\r\n\r\n"You say--at least you used to--that happiness is the only thing worth\r\nwhile in life. Do you think you\'re any happier for being a pessimist?"\r\n\r\nAnthony grunted savagely. His pleasure in the conversation began to\r\nwane. He was nervous and craving for a drink.\r\n\r\n"My golly!" he cried, "where do you live? I can\'t keep walking forever."\r\n\r\n"Your endurance is all mental, eh?" returned Dick sharply. "Well, I live\r\nright here."\r\n\r\nHe turned in at the apartment house on Forty-ninth Street, and a few\r\nminutes later they were in a large new room with an open fireplace and\r\nfour walls lined with books. A colored butler served them gin rickeys,\r\nand an hour vanished politely with the mellow shortening of their drinks\r\nand the glow of a light mid-autumn fire.\r\n\r\n"The arts are very old," said Anthony after a while. With a few glasses\r\nthe tension of his nerves relaxed and he found that he could\r\nthink again.\r\n\r\n"Which art?"\r\n\r\n"All of them. Poetry is dying first. It\'ll be absorbed into prose sooner\r\nor later. For instance, the beautiful word, the colored and glittering\r\nword, and the beautiful simile belong in prose now. To get attention\r\npoetry has got to strain for the unusual word, the harsh, earthy word\r\nthat\'s never been beautiful before. Beauty, as the sum of several\r\nbeautiful parts, reached its apotheosis in Swinburne. It can\'t go any\r\nfurther--except in the novel, perhaps."\r\n\r\nDick interrupted him impatiently:\r\n\r\n"You know these new novels make me tired. My God! Everywhere I go some\r\nsilly girl asks me if I\'ve read \'This Side of Paradise.\' Are our girls\r\nreally like that? If it\'s true to life, which I don\'t believe, the next\r\ngeneration is going to the dogs. I\'m sick of all this shoddy realism. I\r\nthink there\'s a place for the romanticist in literature."\r\n\r\nAnthony tried to remember what he had read lately of Richard Caramel\'s.\r\nThere was "A Shave-tail in France," a novel called "The Land of Strong\r\nMen," and several dozen short stories, which were even worse. It had\r\nbecome the custom among young and clever reviewers to mention Richard\r\nCaramel with a smile of scorn. "Mr." Richard Caramel, they called him.\r\nHis corpse was dragged obscenely through every literary supplement. He\r\nwas accused of making a great fortune by writing trash for the movies.\r\nAs the fashion in books shifted he was becoming almost a byword\r\nof contempt.\r\n\r\nWhile Anthony was thinking this, Dick had got to his feet and seemed to\r\nbe hesitating at an avowal.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve gathered quite a few books," he said suddenly.\r\n\r\n"So I see."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve made an exhaustive collection of good American stuff, old and new.\r\nI don\'t mean the usual Longfellow-Whittier thing--in fact, most of\r\nit\'s modern."\r\n\r\nHe stepped to one of the walls and, seeing that it was expected of him,\r\nAnthony arose and followed.\r\n\r\n"Look!"\r\n\r\nUnder a printed tag _Americana_ he displayed six long rows of books,\r\nbeautifully bound and, obviously, carefully chosen.\r\n\r\n"And here are the contemporary novelists."\r\n\r\nThen Anthony saw the joker. Wedged in between Mark Twain and Dreiser\r\nwere eight strange and inappropriate volumes, the works of Richard\r\nCaramel--"The Demon Lover," true enough ... but also seven others that\r\nwere execrably awful, without sincerity or grace.\r\n\r\nUnwillingly Anthony glanced at Dick\'s face and caught a slight\r\nuncertainty there.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve put my own books in, of course," said Richard Caramel hastily,\r\n"though one or two of them are uneven--I\'m afraid I wrote a little too\r\nfast when I had that magazine contract. But I don\'t believe in false\r\nmodesty. Of course some of the critics haven\'t paid so much attention to\r\nme since I\'ve been established--but, after all, it\'s not the critics\r\nthat count. They\'re just sheep."\r\n\r\nFor the first time in so long that he could scarcely remember, Anthony\r\nfelt a touch of the old pleasant contempt for his friend. Richard\r\nCaramel continued:\r\n\r\n"My publishers, you know, have been advertising me as the Thackeray of\r\nAmerica--because of my New York novel."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Anthony managed to muster, "I suppose there\'s a good deal in what\r\nyou say."\r\n\r\nHe knew that his contempt was unreasonable. He, knew that he would have\r\nchanged places with Dick unhesitatingly. He himself had tried his best\r\nto write with his tongue in his cheek. Ah, well, then--can a man\r\ndisparage his life-work so readily? ...\r\n\r\n--And that night while Richard Caramel was hard at toil, with great\r\nhittings of the wrong keys and screwings up of his weary, unmatched\r\neyes, laboring over his trash far into those cheerless hours when the\r\nfire dies down, and the head is swimming from the effect of prolonged\r\nconcentration--Anthony, abominably drunk, was sprawled across the back\r\nseat of a taxi on his way to the flat on Claremont Avenue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEATING\r\n\r\nAs winter approached it seemed that a sort of madness seized upon\r\nAnthony. He awoke in the morning so nervous that Gloria could feel him\r\ntrembling in the bed before he could muster enough vitality to stumble\r\ninto the pantry for a drink. He was intolerable now except under the\r\ninfluence of liquor, and as he seemed to decay and coarsen under her\r\neyes, Gloria\'s soul and body shrank away from him; when he stayed out\r\nall night, as he did several times, she not only failed to be sorry but\r\neven felt a measure of relief. Next day he would be faintly repentant,\r\nand would remark in a gruff, hang-dog fashion that he guessed he was\r\ndrinking a little too much.\r\n\r\nFor hours at a time he would sit in the great armchair that had been in\r\nhis apartment, lost in a sort of stupor--even his interest in reading\r\nhis favorite books seemed to have departed, and though an incessant\r\nbickering went on between husband and wife, the one subject upon which\r\nthey ever really conversed was the progress of the will case. What\r\nGloria hoped in the tenebrous depths of her soul, what she expected that\r\ngreat gift of money to bring about, is difficult to imagine. She was\r\nbeing bent by her environment into a grotesque similitude of a\r\nhousewife. She who until three years before had never made coffee,\r\nprepared sometimes three meals a day. She walked a great deal in the\r\nafternoons, and in the evenings she read--books, magazines, anything she\r\nfound at hand. If now she wished for a child, even a child of the\r\nAnthony who sought her bed blind drunk, she neither said so nor gave any\r\nshow or sign of interest in children. It is doubtful if she could have\r\nmade it clear to any one what it was she wanted, or indeed what there\r\nwas to want--a lonely, lovely woman, thirty now, retrenched behind some\r\nimpregnable inhibition born and coexistent with her beauty.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon when the snow was dirty again along Riverside Drive,\r\nGloria, who had been to the grocer\'s, entered the apartment to find\r\nAnthony pacing the floor in a state of aggravated nervousness. The\r\nfeverish eyes he turned on her were traced with tiny pink lines that\r\nreminded her of rivers on a map. For a moment she received the\r\nimpression that he was suddenly and definitely old.\r\n\r\n"Have you any money?" he inquired of her precipitately.\r\n\r\n"What? What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Just what I said. Money! Money! Can\'t you speak English?"\r\n\r\nShe paid no attention but brushed by him and into the pantry to put the\r\nbacon and eggs in the ice-box. When his drinking had been unusually\r\nexcessive he was invariably in a whining mood. This time he followed her\r\nand, standing in the pantry door, persisted in his question.\r\n\r\n"You heard what I said. Have you any money?"\r\n\r\nShe turned about from the ice-box and faced him.\r\n\r\n"Why, Anthony, you must be crazy! You know I haven\'t any money--except a\r\ndollar in change."\r\n\r\nHe executed an abrupt about-face and returned to the living room, where\r\nhe renewed his pacing. It was evident that he had something portentous\r\non his mind--he quite obviously wanted to be asked what was the matter.\r\nJoining him a moment later she sat upon the long lounge and began taking\r\ndown her hair. It was no longer bobbed, and it had changed in the last\r\nyear from a rich gold dusted with red to an unresplendent light brown.\r\nShe had bought some shampoo soap and meant to wash it now; she had\r\nconsidered putting a bottle of peroxide into the rinsing water.\r\n\r\n"--Well?" she implied silently.\r\n\r\n"That darn bank!" he quavered. "They\'ve had my account for over ten\r\nyears--ten _years_. Well, it seems they\'ve got some autocratic rule that\r\nyou have to keep over five hundred dollars there or they won\'t carry\r\nyou. They wrote me a letter a few months ago and told me I\'d been\r\nrunning too low. Once I gave out two bum checks--remember? that night in\r\nReisenweber\'s?--but I made them good the very next day. Well, I promised\r\nold Halloran--he\'s the manager, the greedy Mick--that I\'d watch out. And\r\nI thought I was going all right; I kept up the stubs in my check-book\r\npretty regular. Well, I went in there to-day to cash a check, and\r\nHalloran came up and told me they\'d have to close my account. Too many\r\nbad checks, he said, and I never had more than five hundred to my\r\ncredit--and that only for a day or so at a time. And by God! What do you\r\nthink he said then?"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"He said this was a good time to do it because I didn\'t have a damn\r\npenny in there!"\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what he told me. Seems I\'d given these Bedros people a check for\r\nsixty for that last case of liquor--and I only had forty-five dollars in\r\nthe bank. Well, the Bedros people deposited fifteen dollars to my\r\naccount and drew the whole thing out."\r\n\r\nIn her ignorance Gloria conjured up a spectre of imprisonment and\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they won\'t do anything," he assured her. "Bootlegging\'s too risky a\r\nbusiness. They\'ll send me a bill for fifteen dollars and I\'ll pay it."\r\n\r\n"Oh." She considered a moment. "--Well, we can sell another bond."\r\n\r\nHe laughed sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, that\'s always easy. When the few bonds we have that are paying\r\nany interest at all are only worth between fifty and eighty cents on the\r\ndollar. We lose about half the bond every time we sell."\r\n\r\n"What else can we do?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ll sell something--as usual. We\'ve got paper worth eighty\r\nthousand dollars at par." Again he laughed unpleasantly. "Bring about\r\nthirty thousand on the open market."\r\n\r\n"I distrusted those ten per cent investments."\r\n\r\n"The deuce you did!" he said. "You pretended you did, so you could claw\r\nat me if they went to pieces, but you wanted to take a chance as much\r\nas I did."\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment as if considering, then:\r\n\r\n"Anthony," she cried suddenly, "two hundred a month is worse than\r\nnothing. Let\'s sell all the bonds and put the thirty thousand dollars in\r\nthe bank--and if we lose the case we can live in Italy for three years,\r\nand then just die." In her excitement as she talked she was aware of a\r\nfaint flush of sentiment, the first she had felt in many days.\r\n\r\n"Three years," he said nervously, "three years! You\'re crazy. Mr.\r\nHaight\'ll take more than that if we lose. Do you think he\'s working\r\nfor charity?"\r\n\r\n"I forgot that."\r\n\r\n"--And here it is Saturday," he continued, "and I\'ve only got a dollar\r\nand some change, and we\'ve got to live till Monday, when I can get to my\r\nbroker\'s.... And not a drink in the house," he added as a significant\r\nafterthought.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you call up Dick?"\r\n\r\n"I did. His man says he\'s gone down to Princeton to address a literary\r\nclub or some such thing. Won\'t be back till Monday."\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s see--Don\'t you know some friend you might go to?"\r\n\r\n"I tried a couple of fellows. Couldn\'t find anybody in. I wish I\'d sold\r\nthat Keats letter like I started to last week."\r\n\r\n"How about those men you play cards with in that Sammy place?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think I\'d ask _them?_" His voice rang with righteous horror.\r\nGloria winced. He would rather contemplate her active discomfort than\r\nfeel his own skin crawl at asking an inappropriate favor. "I thought of\r\nMuriel," he suggested.\r\n\r\n"She\'s in California."\r\n\r\n"Well, how about some of those men who gave you such a good time while I\r\nwas in the army? You\'d think they might be glad to do a little favor\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him contemptuously, but he took no notice.\r\n\r\n"Or how about your old friend Rachael--or Constance Merriam?"\r\n\r\n"Constance Merriam\'s been dead a year, and I wouldn\'t ask Rachael."\r\n\r\n"Well, how about that gentleman who was so anxious to help you once that\r\nhe could hardly restrain himself, Bloeckman?"\r\n\r\n"Oh--!" He had hurt her at last, and he was not too obtuse or too\r\ncareless to perceive it.\r\n\r\n"Why not him?" he insisted callously.\r\n\r\n"Because--he doesn\'t like me any more," she said with difficulty, and\r\nthen as he did not answer but only regarded her cynically: "If you want\r\nto know why, I\'ll tell you. A year ago I went to Bloeckman--he\'s changed\r\nhis name to Black--and asked him to put me into pictures."\r\n\r\n"You went to Bloeckman?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell me?" he demanded incredulously, the smile fading\r\nfrom his face.\r\n\r\n"Because you were probably off drinking somewhere. He had them give me a\r\ntest, and they decided that I wasn\'t young enough for anything except a\r\ncharacter part."\r\n\r\n"A character part?"\r\n\r\n"The \'woman of thirty\' sort of thing. I wasn\'t thirty, and I didn\'t\r\nthink I--looked thirty."\r\n\r\n"Why, damn him!" cried Anthony, championing her violently with a curious\r\nperverseness of emotion, "why--"\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s why I can\'t go to him."\r\n\r\n"Why, the insolence!" insisted Anthony nervously, "the insolence!"\r\n\r\n"Anthony, that doesn\'t matter now; the thing is we\'ve got to live over\r\nSunday and there\'s nothing in the house but a loaf of bread and a\r\nhalf-pound of bacon and two eggs for breakfast." She handed him the\r\ncontents of her purse. "There\'s seventy, eighty, a dollar fifteen. With\r\nwhat you have that makes about two and a half altogether, doesn\'t it?\r\nAnthony, we can get along on that. We can buy lots of food with\r\nthat--more than we can possibly eat."\r\n\r\nJingling the change in his hand he shook his head. "No. I\'ve got to have\r\na drink. I\'m so darn nervous that I\'m shivering." A thought struck him.\r\n"Perhaps Sammy\'d cash a check. And then Monday I could rush down to the\r\nbank with the money." "But they\'ve closed your account."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, that\'s right--I\'d forgotten. I\'ll tell you what: I\'ll go\r\ndown to Sammy\'s and I\'ll find somebody there who\'ll lend me something. I\r\nhate like the devil to ask them, though...." He snapped his fingers\r\nsuddenly. "I know what I\'ll do. I\'ll hock my watch. I can get twenty\r\ndollars on it, and get it back Monday for sixty cents extra. It\'s been\r\nhocked before--when I was at Cambridge."\r\n\r\nHe had put on his overcoat, and with a brief good-by he started down the\r\nhall toward the outer door.\r\n\r\nGloria got to her feet. It had suddenly occurred to her where he would\r\nprobably go first.\r\n\r\n"Anthony!" she called after him, "hadn\'t you better leave two dollars\r\nwith me? You\'ll only need car-fare."\r\n\r\nThe outer door slammed--he had pretended not to hear her. She stood for\r\na moment looking after him; then she went into the bathroom among her\r\ntragic unguents and began preparations for washing her hair.\r\n\r\nDown at Sammy\'s he found Parker Allison and Pete Lytell sitting alone at\r\na table, drinking whiskey sours. It was just after six o\'clock, and\r\nSammy, or Samuele Bendiri, as he had been christened, was sweeping an\r\naccumulation of cigarette butts and broken glass into a corner.\r\n\r\n"Hi, Tony!" called Parker Allison to Anthony. Sometimes he addressed him\r\nas Tony, at other times it was Dan. To him all Anthonys must sail under\r\none of these diminutives.\r\n\r\n"Sit down. What\'ll you have?"\r\n\r\nOn the subway Anthony had counted his money and found that he had almost\r\nfour dollars. He could pay for two rounds at fifty cents a drink--which\r\nmeant that he would have six drinks. Then he would go over to Sixth\r\nAvenue and get twenty dollars and a pawn ticket in exchange for\r\nhis watch.\r\n\r\n"Well, roughnecks," he said jovially, "how\'s the life of crime?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty good," said Allison. He winked at Pete Lytell. "Too bad you\'re a\r\nmarried man. We\'ve got some pretty good stuff lined up for about eleven\r\no\'clock, when the shows let out. Oh, boy! Yes, sir--too bad he\'s\r\nmarried--isn\'t it, Pete?"\r\n\r\n"\'Sa shame."\r\n\r\nAt half past seven, when they had completed the six rounds, Anthony\r\nfound that his intentions were giving audience to his desires. He was\r\nhappy and cheerful now--thoroughly enjoying himself. It seemed to him\r\nthat the story which Pete had just finished telling was unusually and\r\nprofoundly humorous--and he decided, as he did every day at about this\r\npoint, that they were "damn good fellows, by golly!" who would do a lot\r\nmore for him than any one else he knew. The pawnshops would remain open\r\nuntil late Saturday nights, and he felt that if he took just one more\r\ndrink he would attain a gorgeous rose-colored exhilaration.\r\n\r\nArtfully, he fished in his vest pockets, brought up his two quarters,\r\nand stared at them as though in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll be darned," he protested in an aggrieved tone, "here I\'ve\r\ncome out without my pocketbook."\r\n\r\n"Need some cash?" asked Lytell easily.\r\n\r\n"I left my money on the dresser at home. And I wanted to buy you another\r\ndrink."\r\n\r\n"Oh--knock it." Lytell waved the suggestion away disparagingly. "I guess\r\nwe can blow a good fella to all the drinks he wants. What\'ll you\r\nhave--same?"\r\n\r\n"I tell you," suggested Parker Allison, "suppose we send Sammy across\r\nthe street for some sandwiches and eat dinner here."\r\n\r\nThe other two agreed.\r\n\r\n"Good idea."\r\n\r\n"Hey, Sammy, wantcha do somep\'m for us...."\r\n\r\nJust after nine o\'clock Anthony staggered to his feet and, bidding them\r\na thick good night, walked unsteadily to the door, handing Sammy one of\r\nhis two quarters as he passed out. Once in the street he hesitated\r\nuncertainly and then started in the direction of Sixth Avenue, where he\r\nremembered to have frequently passed several loan offices. He went by a\r\nnews-stand and two drug-stores--and then he realized that he was\r\nstanding in front of the place which he sought, and that it was shut and\r\nbarred. Unperturbed he continued; another one, half a block down, was\r\nalso closed--so were two more across the street, and a fifth in the\r\nsquare below. Seeing a faint light in the last one, he began to knock on\r\nthe glass door; he desisted only when a watchman appeared in the back of\r\nthe shop and motioned him angrily to move on. With growing\r\ndiscouragement, with growing befuddlement, he crossed the street and\r\nwalked back toward Forty-third. On the corner near Sammy\'s he paused\r\nundecided--if he went back to the apartment, as he felt his body\r\nrequired, he would lay himself open to bitter reproach; yet, now that\r\nthe pawnshops were closed, he had no notion where to get the money. He\r\ndecided finally that he might ask Parker Allison, after all--but he\r\napproached Sammy\'s only to find the door locked and the lights out. He\r\nlooked at his watch; nine-thirty. He began walking.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later he stopped aimlessly at the corner of Forty-third\r\nStreet and Madison Avenue, diagonally across from the bright but nearly\r\ndeserted entrance to the Biltmore Hotel. Here he stood for a moment, and\r\nthen sat down heavily on a damp board amid some debris of construction\r\nwork. He rested there for almost half an hour, his mind a shifting\r\npattern of surface thoughts, chiefest among which were that he must\r\nobtain some money and get home before he became too sodden to find\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\nThen, glancing over toward the Biltmore, he saw a man standing directly\r\nunder the overhead glow of the porte-cochere lamps beside a woman in an\r\nermine coat. As Anthony watched, the couple moved forward and signalled\r\nto a taxi. Anthony perceived by the infallible identification that lurks\r\nin the walk of a friend that it was Maury Noble.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Maury!" he shouted.\r\n\r\nMaury looked in his direction, then turned back to the girl just as the\r\ntaxi came up into place. With the chaotic idea of borrowing ten dollars,\r\nAnthony began to run as fast as he could across Madison Avenue and along\r\nForty-third Street.\r\n\r\nAs he came up Maury was standing beside the yawning door of the taxicab.\r\nHis companion turned and looked curiously at Anthony.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Maury!" he said, holding out his hand. "How are you?"\r\n\r\n"Fine, thank you."\r\n\r\nTheir hands dropped and Anthony hesitated. Maury made no move to\r\nintroduce him, but only stood there regarding him with an inscrutable\r\nfeline silence.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to see you--" began Anthony uncertainly. He did not feel that\r\nhe could ask for a loan with the girl not four feet away, so he broke\r\noff and made a perceptible motion of his head as if to beckon Maury\r\nto one side.\r\n\r\n"I\'m in rather a big hurry, Anthony."\r\n\r\n"I know--but can you, can you--" Again he hesitated.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see you some other time," said Maury. "It\'s important."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Anthony."\r\n\r\nBefore Anthony could make up his mind to blurt out his request, Maury\r\nhad turned coolly to the girl, helped her into the car and, with a\r\npolite "good evening," stepped in after her. As he nodded from the\r\nwindow it seemed to Anthony that his expression had not changed by a\r\nshade or a hair. Then with a fretful clatter the taxi moved off, and\r\nAnthony was left standing there alone under the lights.\r\n\r\nAnthony went on into the Biltmore, for no reason in particular except\r\nthat the entrance was at hand, and ascending the wide stair found a seat\r\nin an alcove. He was furiously aware that he had been snubbed; he was as\r\nhurt and angry as it was possible for him to be when in that condition.\r\nNevertheless, he was stubbornly preoccupied with the necessity of\r\nobtaining some money before he went home, and once again he told over on\r\nhis fingers the acquaintances he might conceivably call on in this\r\nemergency. He thought, eventually, that he might approach Mr. Howland,\r\nhis broker, at his home.\r\n\r\nAfter a long wait he found that Mr. Howland was out. He returned to the\r\noperator, leaning over her desk and fingering his quarter as though\r\nloath to leave unsatisfied.\r\n\r\n"Call Mr. Bloeckman," he said suddenly. His own words surprised him. The\r\nname had come from some crossing of two suggestions in his mind.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the number, please?"\r\n\r\nScarcely conscious of what he did, Anthony looked up Joseph Bloeckman in\r\nthe telephone directory. He could find no such person, and was about to\r\nclose the book when it flashed into his mind that Gloria had mentioned a\r\nchange of name. It was the matter of a minute to find Joseph Black--then\r\nhe waited in the booth while central called the number.\r\n\r\n"Hello-o. Mr. Bloeckman--I mean Mr. Black in?"\r\n\r\n"No, he\'s out this evening. Is there any message?" The intonation was\r\ncockney; it reminded him of the rich vocal deferences of Bounds.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"Why, ah, who is this, please, sir?"\r\n\r\n"This Mr. Patch. Matter of vi\'al importance." "Why, he\'s with a party at\r\nthe Boul\' Mich\', sir."\r\n\r\n"Thanks."\r\n\r\nAnthony got his five cents change and started for the Boul\' Mich\', a\r\npopular dancing resort on Forty-fifth Street. It was nearly ten but the\r\nstreets were dark and sparsely peopled until the theatres should eject\r\ntheir spawn an hour later. Anthony knew the Boul\' Mich\', for he had been\r\nthere with Gloria during the year before, and he remembered the\r\nexistence of a rule that patrons must be in evening dress. Well, he\r\nwould not go up-stairs--he would send a boy up for Bloeckman and wait for\r\nhim in the lower hall. For a moment he did not doubt that the whole\r\nproject was entirely natural and graceful. To his distorted imagination\r\nBloeckman had become simply one of his old friends.\r\n\r\nThe entrance hall of the Boul\' Mich\' was warm. There were high yellow\r\nlights over a thick green carpet, from the centre of which a white\r\nstairway rose to the dancing floor.\r\n\r\nAnthony spoke to the hallboy:\r\n\r\n"I want to see Mr. Bloeckman--Mr. Black," he said. "He\'s up-stairs--have\r\nhim paged."\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head.\r\n\r\n"\'Sagainsa rules to have him paged. You know what table he\'s at?"\r\n\r\n"No. But I\'ve got see him."\r\n\r\n"Wait an\' I\'ll getcha waiter."\r\n\r\nAfter a short interval a head waiter appeared, bearing a card on which\r\nwere charted the table reservations. He darted a cynical look at\r\nAnthony--which, however, failed of its target. Together they bent over\r\nthe cardboard and found the table without difficulty--a party of eight,\r\nMr. Black\'s own.\r\n\r\n"Tell him Mr. Patch. Very, very important."\r\n\r\nAgain he waited, leaning against the banister and listening to the\r\nconfused harmonies of "Jazz-mad" which came floating down the stairs. A\r\ncheck-girl near him was singing:\r\n\r\n_"Out in--the shimmee sanitarium\r\nThe jazz-mad nuts reside.\r\nOut in--the shimmee sanitarium\r\nI left my blushing bride.\r\nShe went and shook herself insane,\r\nSo let her shiver back again--"_\r\n\r\nThen he saw Bloeckman descending the staircase, and took a step forward\r\nto meet him and shake hands.\r\n\r\n"You wanted to see me?" said the older man coolly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Anthony, nodding, "personal matter. Can you jus\' step\r\nover here?"\r\n\r\nRegarding him narrowly Bloeckman followed Anthony to a half bend made by\r\nthe staircase where they were beyond observation or earshot of any one\r\nentering or leaving the restaurant.\r\n\r\n"Well?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Wanted talk to you."\r\n\r\n"What about?"\r\n\r\nAnthony only laughed--a silly laugh; he intended it to sound casual.\r\n\r\n"What do you want to talk to me about?" repeated Bloeckman.\r\n\r\n"Wha\'s hurry, old man?" He tried to lay his hand in a friendly gesture\r\nupon Bloeckman\'s shoulder, but the latter drew away slightly.\r\n"How\'ve been?"\r\n\r\n"Very well, thanks.... See here, Mr. Patch, I\'ve got a party up-stairs.\r\nThey\'ll think it\'s rude if I stay away too long. What was it you wanted\r\nto see me about?"\r\n\r\nFor the second time that evening Anthony\'s mind made an abrupt jump, and\r\nwhat he said was not at all what he had intended to say.\r\n\r\n"Un\'erstand you kep\' my wife out of the movies."\r\n\r\n"What?" Bloeckman\'s ruddy face darkened in parallel planes of shadows.\r\n\r\n"You heard me."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Mr. Patch," said Bloeckman, evenly and without changing his\r\nexpression, "you\'re drunk. You\'re disgustingly and insultingly drunk."\r\n\r\n"Not too drunk talk to you," insisted Anthony with a leer. "Firs\' place,\r\nmy wife wants nothin\' whatever do with you. Never did. Un\'erstand me?"\r\n\r\n"Be quiet!" said the older man angrily. "I should think you\'d respect\r\nyour wife enough not to bring her into the conversation under these\r\ncircumstances."\r\n\r\n"Never you min\' how I expect my wife. One thing--you leave her alone.\r\nYou go to hell!"\r\n\r\n"See here--I think you\'re a little crazy!" exclaimed Bloeckman. He took\r\ntwo paces forward as though to pass by, but Anthony stepped in his way.\r\n\r\n"Not so fas\', you Goddam Jew."\r\n\r\nFor a moment they stood regarding each other, Anthony swaying gently\r\nfrom side to side, Bloeckman almost trembling with fury.\r\n\r\n"Be careful!" he cried in a strained voice.\r\n\r\nAnthony might have remembered then a certain look Bloeckman had given\r\nhim in the Biltmore Hotel years before. But he remembered nothing,\r\nnothing----\r\n\r\n"I\'ll say it again, you God----"\r\n\r\nThen Bloeckman struck out, with all the strength in the arm of a\r\nwell-conditioned man of forty-five, struck out and caught Anthony\r\nsquarely in the mouth. Anthony cracked up against the staircase,\r\nrecovered himself and made a wild drunken swing at his opponent, but\r\nBloeckman, who took exercise every day and knew something of sparring,\r\nblocked it with ease and struck him twice in the face with two swift\r\nsmashing jabs. Anthony gave a little grunt and toppled over onto the\r\ngreen plush carpet, finding, as he fell, that his mouth was full of\r\nblood and seemed oddly loose in front. He struggled to his feet, panting\r\nand spitting, and then as he started toward Bloeckman, who stood a few\r\nfeet away, his fists clenched but not up, two waiters who had appeared\r\nfrom nowhere seized his arms and held him, helpless. In back of them a\r\ndozen people had miraculously gathered.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll kill him," cried Anthony, pitching and straining from side to\r\nside. "Let me kill----"\r\n\r\n"Throw him out!" ordered Bloeckman excitedly, just as a small man with a\r\npockmarked face pushed his way hurriedly through the spectators.\r\n\r\n"Any trouble, Mr. Black?"\r\n\r\n"This bum tried to blackmail me!" said Bloeckman, and then, his voice\r\nrising to a faintly shrill note of pride: "He got what was coming\r\nto him!"\r\n\r\nThe little man turned to a waiter.\r\n\r\n"Call a policeman!" he commanded.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Bloeckman quickly. "I can\'t be bothered. Just throw him\r\nout in the street.... Ugh! What an outrage!" He turned and with\r\nconscious dignity walked toward the wash-room just as six brawny hands\r\nseized upon Anthony and dragged him toward the door. The "bum" was\r\npropelled violently to the sidewalk, where he landed on his hands and\r\nknees with a grotesque slapping sound and rolled over slowly onto\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\nThe shock stunned him. He lay there for a moment in acute distributed\r\npain. Then his discomfort became centralized in his stomach, and he\r\nregained consciousness to discover that a large foot was prodding him.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to move on, y\' bum! Move on!"\r\n\r\nIt was the bulky doorman speaking. A town car had stopped at the curb\r\nand its occupants had disembarked--that is, two of the women were\r\nstanding on the dashboard, waiting in offended delicacy until this\r\nobscene obstacle should be removed from their path.\r\n\r\n"Move on! Or else I\'ll _throw_ y\'on!"\r\n\r\n"Here--I\'ll get him."\r\n\r\nThis was a new voice; Anthony imagined that it was somehow more\r\ntolerant, better disposed than the first. Again arms were about him,\r\nhalf lifting, half dragging him into a welcome shadow four doors up the\r\nstreet and propping him against the stone front of a millinery shop.\r\n\r\n"Much obliged," muttered Anthony feebly. Some one pushed his soft hat\r\ndown upon his head and he winced.\r\n\r\n"Just sit still, buddy, and you\'ll feel better. Those guys sure give you\r\na bump."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going back and kill that dirty--" He tried to get to his feet but\r\ncollapsed backward against the wall.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do nothin\' now," came the voice. "Get \'em some other time.\r\nI\'m tellin\' you straight, ain\'t I? I\'m helpin\' you."\r\n\r\nAnthony nodded.\r\n\r\n"An\' you better go home. You dropped a tooth to-night, buddy. You know\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\nAnthony explored his mouth with his tongue, verifying the statement.\r\nThen with an effort he raised his hand and located the gap.\r\n\r\n"I\'m agoin\' to get you home, friend. Whereabouts do you live--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, by God! By God!" interrupted Anthony, clenching his fists\r\npassionately. "I\'ll show the dirty bunch. You help me show \'em and I\'ll\r\nfix it with you. My grandfather\'s Adam Patch, of Tarrytown"--\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"Adam Patch, by God!"\r\n\r\n"You wanna go all the way to Tarrytown?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, you tell me where to go, friend, and I\'ll get a cab."\r\n\r\nAnthony made out that his Samaritan was a short, broad-shouldered\r\nindividual, somewhat the worse for wear.\r\n\r\n"Where d\'you live, hey?"\r\n\r\nSodden and shaken as he was, Anthony felt that his address would be poor\r\ncollateral for his wild boast about his grandfather.\r\n\r\n"Get me a cab," he commanded, feeling in his pockets.\r\n\r\nA taxi drove up. Again Anthony essayed to rise, but his ankle swung\r\nloose, as though it were in two sections. The Samaritan must needs help\r\nhim in--and climb in after him.\r\n\r\n"See here, fella," said he, "you\'re soused and you\'re bunged up, and you\r\nwon\'t be able to get in your house \'less somebody carries you in, so I\'m\r\ngoing with you, and I know you\'ll make it all right with me. Where\r\nd\'you live?"\r\n\r\nWith some reluctance Anthony gave his address. Then, as the cab moved\r\noff, he leaned his head against the man\'s shoulder and went into a\r\nshadowy, painful torpor. When he awoke, the man had lifted him from the\r\ncab in front of the apartment on Claremont Avenue and was trying to set\r\nhim on his feet.\r\n\r\n"Can y\' walk?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--sort of. You better not come in with me." Again he felt helplessly\r\nin his pockets. "Say," he continued, apologetically, swaying dangerously\r\non his feet, "I\'m afraid I haven\'t got a cent."\r\n\r\n"Huh?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m cleaned out."\r\n\r\n"Sa-a-ay! Didn\'t I hear you promise you\'d fix it with me? Who\'s goin\' to\r\npay the taxi bill?" He turned to the driver for confirmation. "Didn\'t\r\nyou hear him say he\'d fix it? All that about his grandfather?"\r\n\r\n"Matter of fact," muttered Anthony imprudently, "it was you did all the\r\ntalking; however, if you come round, to-morrow--"\r\n\r\nAt this point the taxi-driver leaned from his cab and said ferociously:\r\n\r\n"Ah, poke him one, the dirty cheap skate. If he wasn\'t a bum they\r\nwouldn\'ta throwed him out."\r\n\r\nIn answer to this suggestion the fist of the Samaritan shot out like a\r\nbattering-ram and sent Anthony crashing down against the stone steps of\r\nthe apartment-house, where he lay without movement, while the tall\r\nbuildings rocked to and fro above him....\r\n\r\nAfter a long while he awoke and was conscious that it had grown much\r\ncolder. He tried to move himself but his muscles refused to function. He\r\nwas curiously anxious to know the time, but he reached for his watch,\r\nonly to find the pocket empty. Involuntarily his lips formed an\r\nimmemorial phrase:\r\n\r\n"What a night!"\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, he was almost sober. Without moving his head he looked\r\nup to where the moon was anchored in mid-sky, shedding light down into\r\nClaremont Avenue as into the bottom of a deep and uncharted abyss. There\r\nwas no sign or sound of life save for the continuous buzzing in his own\r\nears, but after a moment Anthony himself broke the silence with a\r\ndistinct and peculiar murmur. It was the sound that he had consistently\r\nattempted to make back there in the Boul\' Mich\', when he had been face\r\nto face with Bloeckman--the unmistakable sound of ironic laughter. And\r\non his torn and bleeding lips it was like a pitiful retching of\r\nthe soul.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later the trial came to an end. The seemingly endless spool\r\nof legal red tape having unrolled over a period of four and a half\r\nyears, suddenly snapped off. Anthony and Gloria and, on the other side,\r\nEdward Shuttleworth and a platoon of beneficiaries testified and lied\r\nand ill-behaved generally in varying degrees of greed and desperation.\r\nAnthony awoke one morning in March realizing that the verdict was to be\r\ngiven at four that afternoon, and at the thought he got up out of his\r\nbed and began to dress. With his extreme nervousness there was mingled\r\nan unjustified optimism as to the outcome. He believed that the decision\r\nof the lower court would be reversed, if only because of the reaction,\r\ndue to excessive prohibition, that had recently set in against reforms\r\nand reformers. He counted more on the personal attacks that they had\r\nlevelled at Shuttleworth than on the more sheerly legal aspects of the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nDressed, he poured himself a drink of whiskey and then went into\r\nGloria\'s room, where he found her already wide awake. She had been in\r\nbed for a week, humoring herself, Anthony fancied, though the doctor had\r\nsaid that she had best not be disturbed.\r\n\r\n"Good morning," she murmured, without smiling. Her eyes seemed unusually\r\nlarge and dark.\r\n\r\n"How do you feel?" he asked grudgingly. "Better?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Much?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Do you feel well enough to go down to court with me this afternoon?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I want to. Dick said yesterday that if the weather was nice he was\r\ncoming up in his car and take me for a ride in Central Park--and look,\r\nthe room\'s all full of sunshine."\r\n\r\nAnthony glanced mechanically out the window and then sat down upon the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n"God, I\'m nervous!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t sit there," she said quickly.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"You smell of whiskey. I can\'t stand it."\r\n\r\nHe got up absent-mindedly and left the room. A little later she called\r\nto him and he went out and brought her some potato salad and cold\r\nchicken from the delicatessen.\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock Richard Caramel\'s car arrived at the door and, when he\r\nphoned up, Anthony took Gloria down in the elevator and walked with her\r\nto the curb.\r\n\r\nShe told her cousin that it was sweet of him to take her riding. "Don\'t\r\nbe simple," Dick replied disparagingly. "It\'s nothing."\r\n\r\nBut he did not mean that it was nothing and this was a curious thing.\r\nRichard Caramel had forgiven many people for many offenses. But he had\r\nnever forgiven his cousin, Gloria Gilbert, for a statement she had made\r\njust prior to her wedding, seven years before. She had said that she did\r\nnot intend to read his book.\r\n\r\nRichard Caramel remembered this--he had remembered it well for seven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n"What time will I expect you back?" asked Anthony.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t come back," she answered, "we\'ll meet you down there at four."\r\n\r\n"All right," he muttered, "I\'ll meet you."\r\n\r\nUp-stairs he found a letter waiting for him. It was a mimeographed\r\nnotice urging "the boys" in condescendingly colloquial language to pay\r\nthe dues of the American Legion. He threw it impatiently into the\r\nwaste-basket and sat down with his elbows on the window sill, looking\r\ndown blindly into the sunny street.\r\n\r\nItaly--if the verdict was in their favor it meant Italy. The word had\r\nbecome a sort of talisman to him, a land where the intolerable anxieties\r\nof life would fall away like an old garment. They would go to the\r\nwatering-places first and among the bright and colorful crowds forget\r\nthe gray appendages of despair. Marvellously renewed, he would walk\r\nagain in the Piazza di Spanga at twilight, moving in that drifting\r\nflotsam of dark women and ragged beggars, of austere, barefooted friars.\r\nThe thought of Italian women stirred him faintly--when his purse hung\r\nheavy again even romance might fly back to perch upon it--the romance of\r\nblue canals in Venice, of the golden green hills of Fiesole after rain,\r\nand of women, women who changed, dissolved, melted into other women and\r\nreceded from his life, but who were always beautiful and always young.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed to him that there should be a difference in his attitude.\r\nAll the distress that he had ever known, the sorrow and the pain, had\r\nbeen because of women. It was something that in different ways they did\r\nto him, unconsciously, almost casually--perhaps finding him\r\ntender-minded and afraid, they killed the things in him that menaced\r\ntheir absolute sway.\r\n\r\nTurning about from the window he faced his reflection in the mirror,\r\ncontemplating dejectedly the wan, pasty face, the eyes with their\r\ncrisscross of lines like shreds of dried blood, the stooped and flabby\r\nfigure whose very sag was a document in lethargy. He was thirty\r\nthree--he looked forty. Well, things would be different.\r\n\r\nThe door-bell rang abruptly and he started as though he had been dealt a\r\nblow. Recovering himself, he went into the hall and opened the outer\r\ndoor. It was Dot.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENCOUNTER\r\n\r\nHe retreated before her into the living room, comprehending only a word\r\nhere and there in the slow flood of sentences that poured from her\r\nsteadily, one after the other, in a persistent monotone. She was\r\ndecently and shabbily dressed--a somehow pitiable little hat adorned\r\nwith pink and blue flowers covered and hid her dark hair. He gathered\r\nfrom her words that several days before she had seen an item in the\r\npaper concerning the lawsuit, and had obtained his address from the\r\nclerk of the Appellate Division. She had called up the apartment and had\r\nbeen told that Anthony was out by a woman to whom she had refused to\r\ngive her name.\r\n\r\nIn a living room he stood by the door regarding her with a sort of\r\nstupefied horror as she rattled on.... His predominant sensation was\r\nthat all the civilization and convention around him was curiously\r\nunreal.... She was in a milliner\'s shop on Sixth Avenue, she said. It\r\nwas a lonesome life. She had been sick for a long while after he left\r\nfor Camp Mills; her mother had come down and taken her home again to\r\nCarolina.... She had come to New York with the idea of finding Anthony.\r\n\r\nShe was appallingly in earnest. Her violet eyes were red with tears; her\r\nsoft intonation was ragged with little gasping sobs.\r\n\r\nThat was all. She had never changed. She wanted him now, and if she\r\ncouldn\'t have him she must die....\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to get out," he said at length, speaking with tortuous\r\nintensity. "Haven\'t I enough to worry me now without you coming here? My\r\n_God_! You\'ll have to get _out!"_\r\n\r\nSobbing, she sat down in a chair.\r\n\r\n"I love you," she cried; "I don\'t care what you say to me! I love you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care!" he almost shrieked; "get out--oh, get out! Haven\'t you\r\ndone me harm enough? Haven\'t--you--done--_enough_?"\r\n\r\n"Hit me!" she implored him--wildly, stupidly. "Oh, hit me, and I\'ll kiss\r\nthe hand you hit me with!"\r\n\r\nHis voice rose until it was pitched almost at a scream. "I\'ll kill you!"\r\nhe cried. "If you don\'t get out I\'ll kill you, I\'ll kill you!"\r\n\r\nThere was madness in his eyes now, but, unintimidated, Dot rose and took\r\na step toward him.\r\n\r\n"Anthony! Anthony!--"\r\n\r\nHe made a little clicking sound with his teeth and drew back as though\r\nto spring at her--then, changing his purpose, he looked wildly about him\r\non the floor and wall.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll kill you!" he was muttering in short, broken gasps. "I\'ll _kill_\r\nyou!" He seemed to bite at the word as though to force it into\r\nmaterialization. Alarmed at last she made no further movement forward,\r\nbut meeting his frantic eyes took a step back toward the door. Anthony\r\nbegan to race here and there on his side of the room, still giving out\r\nhis single cursing cry. Then he found what he had been seeking--a stiff\r\noaken chair that stood beside the table. Uttering a harsh, broken shout,\r\nhe seized it, swung it above his head and let it go with all his raging\r\nstrength straight at the white, frightened face across the room ... then\r\na thick, impenetrable darkness came down upon him and blotted out\r\nthought, rage, and madness together--with almost a tangible snapping\r\nsound the face of the world changed before his eyes....\r\n\r\nGloria and Dick came in at five and called his name. There was no\r\nanswer--they went into the living room and found a chair with its back\r\nsmashed lying in the doorway, and they noticed that all about the room\r\nthere was a sort of disorder--the rugs had slid, the pictures and\r\nbric-a-brac were upset upon the centre table. The air was sickly sweet\r\nwith cheap perfume.\r\n\r\nThey found Anthony sitting in a patch of sunshine on the floor of his\r\nbedroom. Before him, open, were spread his three big stamp-books, and\r\nwhen they entered he was running his hands through a great pile of\r\nstamps that he had dumped from the back of one of them. Looking up and\r\nseeing Dick and Gloria he put his head critically on one side and\r\nmotioned them back.\r\n\r\n"Anthony!" cried Gloria tensely, "we\'ve won! They reversed the\r\ndecision!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t come in," he murmured wanly, "you\'ll muss them. I\'m sorting, and\r\nI know you\'ll step in them. Everything always gets mussed."\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" demanded Dick in astonishment. "Going back to\r\nchildhood? Don\'t you realize you\'ve won the suit? They\'ve reversed the\r\ndecision of the lower courts. You\'re worth thirty millions!"\r\n\r\nAnthony only looked at him reproachfully.\r\n\r\n"Shut the door when you go out." He spoke like a pert child.\r\n\r\nWith a faint horror dawning in her eyes, Gloria gazed at him--\r\n\r\n"Anthony!" she cried, "what is it? What\'s the matter? Why didn\'t you\r\ncome--why, what _is_ it?"\r\n\r\n"See here," said Anthony softly, "you two get out--now, both of you. Or\r\nelse I\'ll tell my grandfather."\r\n\r\nHe held up a handful of stamps and let them come drifting down about him\r\nlike leaves, varicolored and bright, turning and fluttering gaudily upon\r\nthe sunny air: stamps of England and Ecuador, Venezuela and\r\nSpain--Italy....\r\n\r\n\r\nTOGETHER WITH THE SPARROWS\r\n\r\nThat exquisite heavenly irony which has tabulated the demise of so many\r\ngenerations of sparrows doubtless records the subtlest verbal\r\ninflections of the passengers of such ships as _The Berengaria_. And\r\ndoubtless it was listening when the young man in the plaid cap crossed\r\nthe deck quickly and spoke to the pretty girl in yellow.\r\n\r\n"That\'s him," he said, pointing to a bundled figure seated in a wheel\r\nchair near the rail. "That\'s Anthony Patch. First time he\'s been\r\non deck."\r\n\r\n"Oh--that\'s him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He\'s been a little crazy, they say, ever since he got his money,\r\nfour or five months ago. You see, the other fellow, Shuttleworth, the\r\nreligious fellow, the one that didn\'t get the money, he locked himself\r\nup in a room in a hotel and shot himself--\r\n\r\n"Oh, he did--"\r\n\r\n"But I guess Anthony Patch don\'t care much. He got his thirty million.\r\nAnd he\'s got his private physician along in case he doesn\'t feel just\r\nright about it. Has _she_ been on deck?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe pretty girl in yellow looked around cautiously.\r\n\r\n"She was here a minute ago. She had on a Russian-sable coat that must\r\nhave cost a small fortune." She frowned and then added decisively: "I\r\ncan\'t stand her, you know. She seems sort of--sort of dyed and\r\n_unclean_, if you know what I mean. Some people just have that look\r\nabout them whether they are or not."\r\n\r\n"Sure, I know," agreed the man with the plaid cap. "She\'s not\r\nbad-looking, though." He paused. "Wonder what he\'s thinking about--his\r\nmoney, I guess, or maybe he\'s got remorse about that fellow\r\nShuttleworth."\r\n\r\n"Probably...."\r\n\r\nBut the man in the plaid cap was quite wrong. Anthony Patch, sitting\r\nnear the rail and looking out at the sea, was not thinking of his money,\r\nfor he had seldom in his life been really preoccupied with material\r\nvainglory, nor of Edward Shuttleworth, for it is best to look on the\r\nsunny side of these things. No--he was concerned with a series of\r\nreminiscences, much as a general might look back upon a successful\r\ncampaign and analyze his victories. He was thinking of the hardships,\r\nthe insufferable tribulations he had gone through. They had tried to\r\npenalize him for the mistakes of his youth. He had been exposed to\r\nruthless misery, his very craving for romance had been punished, his\r\nfriends had deserted him--even Gloria had turned against him. He had\r\nbeen alone, alone--facing it all.\r\n\r\nOnly a few months before people had been urging him to give in, to\r\nsubmit to mediocrity, to go to work. But he had known that he was\r\njustified in his way of life--and he had stuck it out stanchly. Why, the\r\nvery friends who had been most unkind had come to respect him, to know\r\nhe had been right all along. Had not the Lacys and the Merediths and the\r\nCartwright-Smiths called on Gloria and him at the Ritz-Carlton just a\r\nweek before they sailed?\r\n\r\nGreat tears stood in his eyes, and his voice was tremulous as he\r\nwhispered to himself.\r\n\r\n"I showed them," he was saying. "It was a hard fight, but I didn\'t give\r\nup and I came through!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Beautiful and the Damned, by\r\nF.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
