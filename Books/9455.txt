She prided\r\nherself upon having established half a dozen nieces most happily, that\r\nis to say, upon having married them to men of fortunes far superior to\r\ntheir own. One niece still remained unmarried--Belinda Portman, of whom\r\nshe was determined to get rid with all convenient expedition. Belinda\r\nwas handsome, graceful, sprightly, and highly accomplished; her aunt had\r\nendeavoured to teach her that a young lady\'s chief business is to please\r\nin society, that all her charms and accomplishments should be invariably\r\nsubservient to one grand object--the establishing herself in the world:\r\n\r\n    "For this, hands, lips, and eyes were put to school,\r\n    And each instructed feature had its rule."\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanhope did not find Belinda such a docile pupil as her other\r\nnieces, for she had been educated chiefly in the country; she had early\r\nbeen inspired with a taste for domestic pleasures; she was fond of\r\nreading, and disposed to conduct herself with prudence and integrity.\r\nHer character, however, was yet to be developed by circumstances.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanhope lived at Bath, where she had opportunities of showing\r\nher niece off, as she thought, to advantage; but as her health began\r\nto decline, she could not go out with her as much as she wished. After\r\nmanoeuvring with more than her usual art, she succeeded in fastening\r\nBelinda upon the fashionable Lady Delacour for the season. Her ladyship\r\nwas so much pleased by Miss Portman\'s accomplishments and vivacity, as\r\nto invite her to spend the winter with her in London. Soon after her\r\narrival in town, Belinda received the following letter from her aunt\r\nStanhope.\r\n\r\n"Crescent, Bath.\r\n\r\n"After searching every place I could think of, Anne found your bracelet\r\nin your dressing-table, amongst a heap of odd things, which you\r\nleft behind you to be thrown away: I have sent it to you by a young\r\ngentleman, who came to Bath (unluckily) the very day you left me--Mr.\r\nClarence Hervey--an acquaintance, and great admirer of my Lady Delacour.\r\nHe is really an uncommonly pleasant young man, is highly connected,\r\nand has a fine independent fortune. Besides, he is a man of wit and\r\ngallantry, quite a connoisseur in female grace and beauty--just the\r\nman to bring a new face into fashion: so, my dear Belinda, I make it a\r\npoint--look well when he is introduced to you, and remember, what I have\r\nso often told you, that nobody _can_ look well without taking some pains\r\nto please.\r\n\r\n"I see--or at least when I went out more than my health will at present\r\npermit--I used to see multitudes of silly girls, seemingly all cut out\r\nupon the same pattern, who frequented public places day after day,\r\nand year after year, without any idea farther than that of diverting\r\nthemselves, or of obtaining transient admiration. How I have pitied and\r\ndespised the giddy creatures, whilst I have observed them playing off\r\ntheir unmeaning airs, vying with one another in the most _obvious_,\r\nand consequently the most ridiculous manner, so as to expose themselves\r\nbefore the very men they would attract: chattering, tittering, and\r\nflirting; full of the present moment, never reflecting upon the future;\r\nquite satisfied if they got a partner at a ball, without ever thinking\r\nof a partner for life! I have often asked myself, what is to become\r\nof such girls when they grow old or ugly, or when the public eye grows\r\ntired of them? If they have large fortunes, it is all very well; they\r\ncan afford to divert themselves for a season or two, without doubt; they\r\nare sure to be sought after and followed, not by mere danglers, but by\r\nmen of suitable views and pretensions: but nothing to my mind can be\r\nmore miserable than the situation of a poor girl, who, after spending\r\nnot only the interest, but the solid capital of her small fortune in\r\ndress, and frivolous extravagance, fails in her matrimonial expectations\r\n(as many do merely from not beginning to speculate in time). She finds\r\nherself at five or six-and-thirty a burden to her friends, destitute\r\nof the means of rendering herself independent (for the girls I speak\r\nof never think of _learning_ to play cards), _de trop_ in society,\r\nyet obliged to hang upon all her acquaintance, who wish her in heaven,\r\nbecause she is unqualified to make the _expected_ return for civilities,\r\nhaving no home, I mean no establishment, no house, &c. fit for the\r\nreception of company of a certain rank.--My dearest Belinda, may this\r\nnever be your case!--You have every possible advantage, my love: no\r\npains have been spared in your education, and (which is the essential\r\npoint) I have taken care that this should be known--so that you have\r\n_the name_ of being perfectly accomplished. You will also have the name\r\nof being very fashionable, if you go much into public, as doubtless you\r\nwill with Lady Delacour.--Your own good sense must make you aware, my\r\ndear, that from her ladyship\'s situation and knowledge of the world,\r\nit will always be proper, upon all subjects of conversation, for her to\r\nlead and you to follow: it would be very unfit for a young girl like\r\nyou to suffer yourself to stand in competition with Lady Delacour, whose\r\nhigh pretensions to wit and beauty are _indisputable_. I need say\r\nno more to you upon this subject, my dear. Even with your limited\r\nexperience, you must have observed how foolish young people offend\r\nthose who are the most necessary to their interests, by an imprudent\r\nindulgence of their vanity.\r\n\r\n"Lady Delacour has an incomparable taste in dress: consult her, my dear,\r\nand do not, by an ill-judged economy, counteract my views--apropos, I\r\nhave no objection to your being presented at court. You will, of\r\ncourse, have credit with all her ladyship\'s tradespeople, if you manage\r\nproperly. To know how and when to lay out money is highly commendable,\r\nfor in some situations, people judge of what one can afford by what one\r\nactually spends.--I know of no law which compels a young lady to tell\r\nwhat her age or her fortune may be. You have no occasion for caution yet\r\non one of these points.\r\n\r\n"I have covered my old carpet with a handsome green baize, and every\r\nstranger who comes to see me, I observe, takes it for granted that I\r\nhave a rich carpet under it. Say every thing that is proper, in your\r\nbest manner, for me to Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Adieu, my dear Belinda,\r\n\r\n"Yours, very sincerely,\r\n\r\n"SELINA STANHOPE."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes fortunate, that the means which are taken to produce\r\ncertain effects upon the mind have a tendency directly opposite to\r\nwhat is expected. Mrs. Stanhope\'s perpetual anxiety about her niece\'s\r\nappearance, manners, and establishment, had completely worn out\r\nBelinda\'s patience; she had become more insensible to the praises of her\r\npersonal charms and accomplishments than young women of her age usually\r\nare, because she had been so much flattered and _shown off_, as it is\r\ncalled, by her match-making aunt.--Yet Belinda was fond of amusement,\r\nand had imbibed some of Mrs. Stanhope\'s prejudices in favour of rank\r\nand fashion. Her taste for literature declined in proportion to her\r\nintercourse with the fashionable world, as she did not in this society\r\nperceive the least use in the knowledge that she had acquired. Her mind\r\nhad never been roused to much reflection; she had in general acted\r\nbut as a puppet in the hands of others. To her aunt Stanhope she had\r\nhitherto paid unlimited, habitual, blind obedience; but she was more\r\nundesigning, and more free from affectation and coquetry, than could\r\nhave been expected, after the course of documenting which she had gone\r\nthrough. She was charmed with the idea of a visit to Lady Delacour,\r\nwhom she thought the most agreeable--no, that is too feeble an\r\nexpression--the most fascinating person she had ever beheld. Such was\r\nthe light in which her ladyship appeared, not only to Belinda, but to\r\nall the world--that is to say, all the world of fashion, and she knew of\r\nno other.--The newspapers were full of Lady Delacour\'s parties, and Lady\r\nDelacour\'s dresses, and Lady Delacour\'s _bon mots_: every thing that her\r\nladyship said was repeated as witty; every thing that her ladyship wore\r\nwas imitated as fashionable. Female wit sometimes depends on the\r\nbeauty of its possessor for its reputation; and the reign of beauty\r\nis proverbially short, and fashion often capriciously deserts her\r\nfavourites, even before nature withers their charms. Lady Delacour\r\nseemed to be a fortunate exception to these general rules: long after\r\nshe had lost the bloom of youth, she continued to be admired as a\r\nfashionable _bel esprit_; and long after she had ceased to be a novelty\r\nin society, her company was courted by all the gay, the witty, and the\r\ngallant. To be seen in public with Lady Delacour, to be a visitor at her\r\nhouse, were privileges of which numbers were vehemently ambitious; and\r\nBelinda Portman was congratulated and envied by all her acquaintance,\r\nfor being admitted as an inmate. How could she avoid thinking herself\r\nsingularly fortunate?\r\n\r\nA short time after her arrival at Lady Delacour\'s, Belinda began to\r\nsee through the thin veil with which politeness covers domestic\r\nmisery.--Abroad, and at home, Lady Delacour was two different persons.\r\nAbroad she appeared all life, spirit, and good humour--at home,\r\nlistless, fretful, and melancholy; she seemed like a spoiled actress off\r\nthe stage, over-stimulated by applause, and exhausted by the exertions\r\nof supporting a fictitious character.--When her house was filled with\r\nwell-dressed crowds, when it blazed with lights, and resounded with\r\nmusic and dancing, Lady Delacour, in the character of Mistress of the\r\nRevels, shone the soul and spirit of pleasure and frolic: but the\r\nmoment the company retired, when the music ceased, and the lights were\r\nextinguishing, the spell was dissolved.\r\n\r\nShe would sometimes walk up and down the empty magnificent saloon,\r\nabsorbed in thoughts seemingly of the most painful nature.\r\n\r\nFor some days after Belinda\'s arrival in town she heard nothing of Lord\r\nDelacour; his lady never mentioned his name, except once accidentally,\r\nas she was showing Miss Portman the house, she said, "Don\'t open that\r\ndoor--those are only Lord Delacour\'s apartments."--The first time\r\nBelinda ever saw his lordship, he was dead drunk in the arms of two\r\nfootmen, who were carrying him up stairs to his bedchamber: his lady,\r\nwho was just returned from Ranelagh, passed by him on the landing-place\r\nwith a look of sovereign contempt.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?--Who is this?" said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Only the body of my Lord Delacour," said her ladyship: "his bearers\r\nhave brought it up the wrong staircase. Take it down again, my good\r\nfriends: let his lordship go his _own way_. Don\'t look so shocked and\r\namazed, Belinda--don\'t look so _new_, child: this funeral of my lord\'s\r\nintellects is to me a nightly, or," added her ladyship, looking at\r\nher watch and yawning, "I believe I should say a _daily_ ceremony--six\r\no\'clock, I protest!"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as her ladyship and Miss Portman were sitting at the\r\nbreakfast-table, after a very late breakfast, Lord Delacour entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Lord Delacour, sober, my dear,"--said her ladyship to Miss Portman, by\r\nway of introducing him. Prejudiced by her ladyship, Belinda was inclined\r\nto think that Lord Delacour sober would not be more agreeable or more\r\nrational than Lord Delacour drunk. "How old do you take my lord to\r\nbe?" whispered her ladyship, as she saw Belinda\'s eye fixed upon the\r\ntrembling hand which carried his teacup to his lips: "I\'ll lay you a\r\nwager," continued she aloud--"I\'ll lay your birth-night dress, gold\r\nfringe, and laurel wreaths into the bargain, that you don\'t guess\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t think of going to this birth-night, lady Delacour?"\r\nsaid his lordship.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you six guesses, and I\'ll bet you don\'t come within sixteen\r\nyears," pursued her ladyship, still looking at Belinda.\r\n\r\n"You cannot have the new carriage you have bespoken," said his lordship.\r\n"Will you do me the honour to attend to me, Lady Delacour?"\r\n\r\n"Then you won\'t venture to guess, Belinda," said her ladyship (without\r\nhonouring her lord with the smallest portion of her attention)--"Well,\r\nI believe you are right--for certainly you would guess him to be\r\nsix-and-sixty, instead of six-and-thirty; but then he can drink more\r\nthan any two-legged animal in his majesty\'s dominions, and you know that\r\nis an advantage which is well worth twenty or thirty years of a man\'s\r\nlife--especially to persons who have no other chance of distinguishing\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"If some people had distinguished themselves a little less in the\r\nworld," retorted his lordship, "it would have been as well!"\r\n\r\n"As well!--how flat!"\r\n\r\n"Flatly then I have to inform you, Lady Delacour, that I will neither\r\nbe contradicted nor laughed at--you understand me,--it would be as well,\r\nflat or not flat, my Lady Delacour, if your ladyship would attend more\r\nto your own conduct, and less to others!"\r\n\r\n"To _that_ of others--his lordship means, if he means any thing.\r\nApropos, Belinda, did not you tell me Clarence Hervey is coming to\r\ntown?--You have never seen him.--Well, I\'ll describe him to you by\r\nnegatives. He is _not_ a man who ever says any thing flat--he is _not_\r\na man who must be wound up with half a dozen bottles of champaign before\r\nhe can _go_--he is _not_ a man who, when he does go, goes wrong, and\r\nwon\'t be set right--he is _not_ a man, whose whole consequence, if he\r\nwere married, would depend on his wife--he is _not_ a man, who, if he\r\nwere married, would be so desperately afraid of being governed by his\r\nwife, that he would turn gambler, jockey, or sot, merely to show that he\r\ncould govern himself."\r\n\r\n"Go on, Lady Delacour," said his lordship, who had been in vain\r\nattempting to balance a spoon on the edge of his teacup during the whole\r\nof this speech, which was delivered with the most animated desire to\r\nprovoke--"Go on, Lady Delacour--all I desire is, that you should go on;\r\nClarence Hervey will be much obliged to you, and I am sure so shall I.\r\nGo on, my Lady Delacour--go on, and you\'ll oblige me."\r\n\r\n"I never will oblige you, my lord, that you may depend upon," cried her\r\nladyship, with a look of indignant contempt.\r\n\r\nHis lordship whistled, rang for his horses, and looked at his nails with\r\na smile. Belinda, shocked and in a great confusion, rose to leave the\r\nroom, dreading the gross continuance of this matrimonial dialogue.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hervey, my lady," said a footman, opening the door; and he was\r\nscarcely announced, when her ladyship went forward to receive him with\r\nan air of easy familiarity.--"Where have you buried yourself, Hervey,\r\nthis age past?" cried she, shaking hands with him: "there\'s absolutely\r\nno living in this most stupid of all worlds without you.--Mr.\r\nHervey--Miss Portman--but don\'t look as if you were half asleep,\r\nman--What are you dreaming of, Clarence? Why looks your grace so heavily\r\nto-day?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I have passed a miserable night," replied Clarence, throwing\r\nhimself into an actor\'s attitude, and speaking in a fine tone of stage\r\ndeclamation.\r\n\r\n    "What was your dream, my lord? I pray you, tell me,"\r\n\r\nsaid her ladyship in a similar tone.--Clarence went on--\r\n\r\n    "O Lord, methought what pain it was to dance!\r\n    What dreadful noise of fiddles in my ears!\r\n    What sights of ugly _belles_ within my eyes!\r\n    ----Then came wandering by,\r\n    A shadow like a devil, with red hair,\r\n    \'Dizen\'d with flowers; and she bawl\'d out aloud,\r\n    Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence!"\r\n\r\n"O, Mrs. Luttridge to the life!" cried Lady Delacour: "I know where you\r\nhave been now, and I pity you--but sit down," said she, making room for\r\nhim between Belinda and herself upon the sofa, "sit down here, and tell\r\nme what could take you to that odious Mrs. Luttridge\'s."\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey threw himself on the sofa; Lord Delacour whistled as before,\r\nand left the room without uttering a syllable.\r\n\r\n"But my dream has made me forget myself strangely," said Mr. Hervey,\r\nturning to Belinda, and producing her bracelet: "Mrs. Stanhope promised\r\nme that if I delivered it safely, I should be rewarded with the honour\r\nof putting it on the owner\'s fair arm." A conversation now took place on\r\nthe nature of ladies\' promises--on fashionable bracelets--on the size\r\nof the arm of the Venus de Medici--on Lady Delacour\'s and Miss\r\nPortman\'s--on the thick legs of ancient statues--and on the various\r\ndefects and absurdities of Mrs. Luttridge and her wig. On all these\r\ntopics Mr. Hervey displayed much wit, gallantry, and satire, with so\r\nhappy an effect, that Belinda, when he took leave, was precisely of her\r\naunt\'s opinion, that he was a most uncommonly pleasant young man.\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey might have been more than a pleasant young man, if he\r\nhad not been smitten with the desire of being thought superior in every\r\nthing, and of being the most admired person in all companies. He had\r\nbeen early flattered with the idea that he was a man of genius; and\r\nhe imagined that, as such, he was entitled to be imprudent, wild, and\r\neccentric. He affected singularity, in order to establish his claims\r\nto genius. He had considerable literary talents, by which he was\r\ndistinguished at Oxford; but he was so dreadfully afraid of passing\r\nfor a pedant, that when he came into the company of the idle and the\r\nignorant, he pretended to disdain every species of knowledge. His\r\nchameleon character seemed to vary in different lights, and according to\r\nthe different situations in which he happened to be placed. He could\r\nbe all things to all men--and to all women. He was supposed to be a\r\nfavourite with the fair sex; and of all his various excellencies and\r\ndefects, there was none on which he valued himself so much as on his\r\ngallantry. He was not profligate; he had a strong sense of honour,\r\nand quick feelings of humanity; but he was so easily led, or rather so\r\neasily excited by his companions, and his companions were now of such\r\na sort, that it was probable he would soon become vicious. As to his\r\nconnexion with Lady Delacour, he would have started with horror at the\r\nidea of disturbing the peace of a family; but in her family, he said,\r\nthere was no peace to disturb; he was vain of having it seen by the\r\nworld that he was distinguished by a lady of her wit and fashion, and\r\nhe did not think it incumbent on him to be more scrupulous or more\r\nattentive to appearances than her ladyship. By Lord Delacour\'s jealousy\r\nhe was sometimes provoked, sometimes amused, and sometimes flattered.\r\nHe was constantly of all her ladyship\'s parties in public and private;\r\nconsequently he saw Belinda almost every day, and every day he saw her\r\nwith increasing admiration of her beauty, and with increasing dread of\r\nbeing taken in to marry a niece of "the _catch-match-maker_," the name\r\nby which Mrs. Stanhope was known amongst the men of his acquaintance.\r\nYoung ladies who have the misfortune to be _conducted_ by these artful\r\ndames, are always supposed to be partners in all the speculations,\r\nthough their names may not appear in the firm. If he had not been\r\nprejudiced by the character of her aunt, Mr. Hervey would have thought\r\nBelinda an undesigning, unaffected girl; but now he suspected her of\r\nartifice in every word, look, and motion; and even when he felt himself\r\nmost charmed by her powers of pleasing, he was most inclined to despise\r\nher, for what he thought such premature proficiency in scientific\r\ncoquetry. He had not sufficient resolution to keep beyond the sphere\r\nof her attraction; but, frequently, when he found himself within it, he\r\ncursed his folly, and drew back with sudden terror. His manner towards\r\nher was so variable and inconsistent, that she knew not how to interpret\r\nits language. Sometimes she fancied, that with all the eloquence of eyes\r\nhe said, "_I adore you_, Belinda;" at other times she imagined that\r\nhis guarded silence meant to warn her that he was so entangled by Lady\r\nDelacour, that he could not extricate himself from her snares. Whenever\r\nthis last idea struck her, it excited, in the most edifying manner, her\r\nindignation against coquetry in general, and against her ladyship\'s\r\nin particular: she became wonderfully clear-sighted to all the\r\nimproprieties of her ladyship\'s conduct. Belinda\'s newly acquired moral\r\nsense was so much shocked, that she actually wrote a full statement of\r\nher observations and her scruples to her aunt Stanhope; concluding by\r\na request, that she might not remain under the protection of a lady, of\r\nwhose character she could not approve, and whose intimacy might perhaps\r\nbe injurious to her reputation, if not to her principles.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanhope answered Belinda\'s letter in a very guarded style; she\r\nrebuked her niece severely for her imprudence in mentioning _names_ in\r\nsuch a manner, in a letter sent by the common post; assured her that her\r\nreputation was in no danger; that she hoped no niece of hers would set\r\nup for a prude--a character more suspected by men of the world than\r\neven that of a coquette; that the person alluded to was a perfectly fit\r\nchaperon for any young lady to appear with in public, as long as she\r\nwas visited by the first people in town; that as to any thing in the\r\n_private_ conduct of that person, and as to any _private brouillieries_\r\nbetween her and her lord, Belinda should observe on these dangerous\r\ntopics a profound silence, both in her letters and her conversation;\r\nthat as long as the lady continued under the protection of her husband,\r\nthe world might whisper, but would not speak out; that as to Belinda\'s\r\nown principles, she would be utterly inexcusable if, after the education\r\nshe had received, they could be hurt by any bad examples; that she could\r\nnot be too cautious in her management of a man of ----\'s character;\r\nthat she could have no _serious_ cause for jealousy in the quarter she\r\napprehended, as marriage there could not be the object; and there was\r\nsuch a difference of age, that no permanent influence could probably be\r\nobtained by the lady; that the most certain method for Miss Portman to\r\nexpose herself to the ridicule of one of the parties, and to the total\r\nneglect of the other, would be to betray anxiety or jealousy; that, in\r\nshort, if she were fool enough to lose her own heart, there would be\r\nlittle chance of her being wise enough to win that of ----, who was\r\nevidently a man of gallantry rather than of sentiment, and who was known\r\nto play his cards well, and to have good luck whenever _hearts_ were\r\ntrumps.\r\n\r\nBelinda\'s fears of Lady Delacour, as a dangerous rival, were much\r\nquieted by the artful insinuations of Mrs. Stanhope, with respect to her\r\nage, &c.; and in proportion as her fears subsided, she blamed herself\r\nfor having written too harshly of her ladyship\'s conduct. The idea that\r\nwhilst she appeared as Lady Delacour\'s friend she ought not to propagate\r\nany stories to her disadvantage, operated powerfully upon Belinda\'s\r\nmind, and she reproached herself for having told even her aunt what she\r\nhad seen in private. She thought that she had been guilty of treachery,\r\nand she wrote again immediately to Mrs. Stanhope, to conjure her to burn\r\nher last letter; to forget, if possible, its contents; and to believe\r\nthat not a syllable of a similar nature should ever more be heard from\r\nher: she was just concluding with the words--"I hope my dear aunt will\r\nconsider all this as an error of my judgment, and not of my heart,"\r\nwhen Lady Delacour burst into the room, exclaiming, in a tone of gaiety,\r\n"Tragedy or comedy, Belinda? The masquerade dresses are come. But how\'s\r\nthis?" added she, looking full in Belinda\'s face--"tears in the eyes!\r\nblushes in the cheeks! tremors in the joints! and letters shuffling\r\naway! But, you novice of novices, how awkwardly shuffled!--A niece of\r\nMrs. Stanhope\'s, and so unpractised a shuffler!--And is it credible she\r\nshould tremble in this ridiculous way about a love-letter or two?"\r\n\r\n"No love-letters, indeed, Lady Delacour," said Belinda, holding the\r\npaper fast, as her ladyship, half in play, half in earnest, attempted to\r\nsnatch it from her.\r\n\r\n"No love-letters! then it must be treason; and see it I must, by all\r\nthat\'s good, or by all that\'s bad--I see the name of Delacour!"--and\r\nher ladyship absolutely seized the letters by force, in spite of all\r\nBelinda\'s struggles and entreaties.\r\n\r\n"I beg, I request, I conjure you not to read it!" cried Miss Portman,\r\nclasping her hands. "Read mine, read mine, if you _must_, but don\'t read\r\nmy aunt Stanhope\'s--Oh! I beg, I entreat, I conjure you!" and she threw\r\nherself upon her knees.\r\n\r\n"You beg! you entreat! you conjure! Why, this is like the Duchess de\r\nBrinvilliers, who wrote on her paper of poisons, \'Whoever finds this, I\r\nentreat, I conjure them, in the name of more saints than I can remember,\r\nnot to open the paper any farther.\'--What a simpleton, to know so little\r\nof the nature of curiosity!"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Lady Delacour opened Mrs. Stanhope\'s letter, read it from\r\nbeginning to end, folded it up coolly when she had finished it, and\r\nsimply said, "The _person alluded to_ is almost as bad as her name at\r\nfull length: does Mrs. Stanhope think no one can make out an inuendo\r\nin a libel, or fill up a blank, but an attorney-general?" pointing to a\r\nblank in Mrs. Stanhope\'s letter, left for the name of Clarence Hervey.\r\n\r\nBelinda was in too much confusion either to speak or think.\r\n\r\n"You were right to swear they were not love-letters," pursued her\r\nladyship, laying down the papers. "I protest I snatched them by way of\r\nfrolic--I beg pardon. All I can do now is not to read the rest."\r\n\r\n"Nay--I beg--I wish--I insist upon your reading mine," said Belinda.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Delacour had read it, her countenance suddenly changed--"Worth\r\na hundred of your aunt\'s, I declare," said she, patting Belinda\'s cheek.\r\n"What a treasure to meet with any thing like a _new_ heart!--all hearts,\r\nnow-a-days, are second-hand, at best."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour spoke with a tone of feeling which Belinda had never heard\r\nfrom her before, and which at this moment touched her so much, that she\r\ntook her ladyship\'s hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMASKS\r\n\r\n\r\n"Where were we when all this began?" cried Lady Delacour, forcing\r\nherself to resume an air of gaiety--"O, masquerade was the order of the\r\nday---tragedy or comedy? which suits your genius best, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Whichever suits your ladyship\'s taste least."\r\n\r\n"Why, my woman, Marriott, says I ought to be tragedy; and, upon the\r\nnotion that people always succeed best when they take characters\r\ndiametrically opposite to their own--Clarence Hervey\'s\r\nprinciple--perhaps you don\'t think that he has any principles; but there\r\nyou are wrong; I do assure you, he has sound principles--of taste."\r\n\r\n"Of that," said Belinda, with a constrained smile, "he gives the most\r\nconvincing proof, by his admiring your ladyship so much."\r\n\r\n"And by his admiring Miss Portman so much more. But whilst we are making\r\nspeeches to one another, poor Marriott is standing in distress, like\r\nGarrick, between tragedy and comedy."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour opened her dressing-room door, and pointed to her as she\r\nstood with the dress of the comic muse on one arm, and the tragic muse\r\non the other.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I have not spirits enough to undertake the comic muse,"\r\nsaid Miss Portman.\r\n\r\nMarriott, who was a personage of prodigious consequence, and the judge\r\nin the last resort at her mistress\'s toilette, looked extremely out of\r\nhumour at having been kept waiting so long; and yet more so at the idea\r\nthat her appellant jurisdiction could be disputed.\r\n\r\n"Your ladyship\'s taller than Miss Portman by half ahead," said Marriott,\r\n"and to be sure will best become tragedy with this long train; besides,\r\nI had settled all the rest of your ladyship\'s dress. Tragedy, they\r\nsay, is always tall; and, no offence, your ladyship\'s taller than Miss\r\nPortman by half a head."\r\n\r\n"For head read inch," said Lady Delacour, "if you please."\r\n\r\n"When things are settled, one can\'t bear to have them unsettled--but\r\nyour ladyship must have your own way, to be sure--I\'ll say no more,"\r\ncried she, throwing down the dresses.\r\n\r\n"Stay, Marriott," said Lady Delacour, and she placed herself between the\r\nangry waiting-maid and the door.\r\n\r\n"Why will you, who are the best creature in the world, put yourself into\r\nthese _furies_ about nothing? Have patience with us, and you shall be\r\nsatisfied."\r\n\r\n"That\'s another affair," said Marriott.\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman," continued her ladyship, "don\'t talk of not having\r\nspirits, you that are all life!--What say you, Belinda?--O yes, you must\r\nbe the comic muse; and I, it seems, must be tragedy, because Marriott\r\nhas a passion for seeing me \'come sweeping by.\' And because Marriott\r\nmust have her own way in every thing--she rules me with a rod of iron,\r\nmy dear, so tragedy I needs must be.--_Marriott knows her power_."\r\n\r\nThere was an air of extreme vexation in Lady Delacour\'s countenance as\r\nshe pronounced these last words, in which evidently more was meant\r\nthan met the ear. Upon many occasions Miss Portman had observed, that\r\nMarriott exercised despotic authority over her mistress; and she had\r\nseen, with surprise, that a lady, who would not yield an iota of power\r\nto her husband, submitted herself to every caprice of the most insolent\r\nof waiting-women. For some time, Belinda imagined that this submission\r\nwas merely an air, as she had seen some other fine ladies proud of\r\nappearing to be governed by a favourite maid; but she was soon convinced\r\nthat Marriott was no favourite with Lady Delacour; that her ladyship\'s\r\nwas not _proud humility_, but fear. It seemed certain that a woman,\r\nextravagantly fond of her own _will_, would never have given it up\r\nwithout some very substantial reason. It seemed as if Marriott was in\r\npossession of some secret, which should for ever remain unknown. This\r\nidea had occurred to Miss Portman more than once, but never so forcibly\r\nas upon the present occasion. There had always been some mystery about\r\nher ladyship\'s toilette: at certain hours doors were bolted, and it was\r\nimpossible for any body but Marriott to obtain admission. Miss Portman\r\nat first imagined that Lady Delacour dreaded the discovery of her\r\ncosmetic secrets, but her ladyship\'s rouge was so glaring, and her pearl\r\npowder was so obvious, that Belinda was convinced there must be some\r\nother cause for this toilette secrecy. There was a little cabinet beyond\r\nher bedchamber, which Lady Delacour called her boudoir, to which there\r\nwas an entrance by a back staircase; but no one ever entered there but\r\nMarriott. One night, Lady Delacour, after dancing with great spirit at\r\na ball, at her own house, fainted suddenly: Miss Portman attended her\r\nto her bedchamber, but Marriott begged that her lady might be left alone\r\nwith _her_, and she would by no means suffer Belinda to follow her into\r\nthe boudoir. All these things Belinda recollected in the space of a few\r\nseconds, as she stood contemplating Marriott and the dresses. The hurry\r\nof getting ready for the masquerade, however, dispelled these thoughts,\r\nand by the time she was dressed, the idea of what Clarence Hervey would\r\nthink of her appearance was uppermost in her mind. She was anxious to\r\nknow whether he would discover her in the character of the comic muse.\r\nLady Delacour was discontented with her tragic attire, and she grew\r\nstill more out of humour with herself, when she saw Belinda.\r\n\r\n"I protest Marriott has made a perfect fright of me," said her ladyship,\r\nas she got into her carriage, "and I\'m positive my dress would become\r\nyou a million of times better than your own."\r\n\r\nMiss Portman regretted that it was too late to change.\r\n\r\n"Not at all too late, my dear," said Lady Delacour; "never too late for\r\nwomen to change their minds, their dress, or their lovers. Seriously,\r\nyou know, we are to call at my friend Lady Singleton\'s--she sees masks\r\nto-night: I\'m quite intimate there; I\'ll make her let me step up to her\r\nown room, where no soul can interrupt us, and there we can change our\r\ndresses, and Marriott will know nothing of the matter. Marriott\'s a\r\nfaithful creature, and very fond of me; fond of power too--but who is\r\nnot?--we must all have our faults: one would not quarrel with such a\r\ngood creature as Marriott for a trifle." Then suddenly changing her\r\ntone, she said, "Not a human being will find us out at the masquerade;\r\nfor no one but Mrs. Freke knows that we are the two muses. Clarence\r\nHervey swears he should know me in any disguise--but I defy him--I shall\r\ntake special delight in puzzling him. Harriot Freke has told him, in\r\nconfidence, that I\'m to be the widow Brady, in man\'s clothes: now that\'s\r\nto be Harriot\'s own character; so Hervey will make fine confusion."\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got to Lady Singleton\'s, Lady Delacour and Miss Portman\r\nimmediately went up stairs to exchange dresses. Poor Belinda, now that\r\nshe felt herself in spirits to undertake the comic muse, was rather\r\nvexed to be obliged to give up her becoming character; but there was no\r\nresisting the polite energy of Lady Delacour\'s vanity. Her ladyship ran\r\nas quick as lightning into a closet within the dressing-room, saying\r\nto Lady Singleton\'s woman, who attempted to follow with--"Can I do any\r\nthing for your ladyship?"--"No, no, no--nothing, nothing--thank ye,\r\nthank ye,--I want no assistance--I never let any body do any thing for\r\nme but Marriott;" and she bolted herself in the closet. In a few minutes\r\nshe half opened the door, threw out her tragic robes, and cried, "Here,\r\nMiss Portman, give me yours--quick--and let\'s see whether comedy or\r\ntragedy will be ready first."\r\n\r\n"Lord bless and forgive me," said Lady Singleton\'s woman, when\r\nLady Delacour at last threw open the door, when she was completely\r\ndressed--"but if your la\'ship has not been dressing all this time in\r\nthat den, without any thing in the shape of a looking-glass, and not to\r\nlet me help! I that should have been so proud."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour put half a guinea into the waiting-maid\'s hand, laughed\r\naffectedly at her own _whimsicalities_, and declared that she could\r\nalways dress herself better without a glass than with one. All this went\r\noff admirably well with every body but Miss Portman; she could not help\r\nthinking it extraordinary that a person who was obviously fond of being\r\nwaited upon would never suffer any person to assist her at her toilet\r\nexcept Marriott, a woman of whom she was evidently afraid. Lady\r\nDelacour\'s quick eye saw curiosity painted in Belinda\'s countenance, and\r\nfor a moment she was embarrassed; but she soon recovered herself, and\r\nendeavoured to turn the course of Miss Portman\'s thoughts by whispering\r\nto her some nonsense about Clarence Hervey--a cabalistical name, which\r\nshe knew had the power, when pronounced in a certain tone, of throwing\r\nBelinda into confusion.\r\n\r\nThe first person they saw, when they went into the drawing-room at Lady\r\nSingleton\'s, was this very Clarence Hervey, who was not in a masquerade\r\ndress. He had laid a wager with one of his acquaintance, that he\r\ncould perform the part of the serpent, such as he is seen in Fuseli\'s\r\nwell-known picture. For this purpose he had exerted much ingenuity\r\nin the invention and execution of a length of coiled skin, which he\r\nmanoeuvred with great dexterity, by means of internal wires; his grand\r\ndifficulty had been to manufacture the rays that were to come from his\r\neyes. He had contrived a set of phosphoric rays, which he was certain\r\nwould charm all the fair daughters of Eve. He forgot, it seems, that\r\nphosphorus could not well be seen by candlelight. When he was just\r\nequipped as a serpent, his rays set fire to part of his _envelope_, and\r\nit was with the greatest difficulty that he was extricated. He escaped\r\nunhurt, but his serpent\'s skin was utterly consumed; nothing remained\r\nbut the melancholy spectacle of its skeleton. He was obliged to give up\r\nthe hopes of shining at the masquerade, but he resolved to be at Lady\r\nSingleton\'s that he might meet Lady Delacour and Miss Portman. The\r\nmoment that the tragic and comic muse appeared, he invoked them with\r\nmuch humour and mock pathos, declaring that he knew not which of them\r\ncould best sing his adventure. After a recital of his misfortune had\r\nentertained the company, and after the muses had performed their parts\r\nto the satisfaction of the audience and their own, the conversation\r\nceased to be supported in masquerade character; muses and harlequins,\r\ngipsies and Cleopatras, began to talk of their private affairs, and of\r\nthe news and the scandal of the day.\r\n\r\nA group of gentlemen, amongst whom was Clarence Hervey, gathered round\r\nthe tragic muse; as Mr. Hervey had hinted that he knew she was a\r\nperson of distinction, though he would not tell her name. After he had\r\nexercised his wit for some time, without obtaining from the tragic muse\r\none single syllable, he whispered, "Lady Delacour, why this unnatural\r\nreserve? Do you imagine that, through this tragical disguise, I have not\r\nfound you out?"\r\n\r\nThe tragic muse, apparently absorbed in meditation, vouchsafed no reply.\r\n\r\n"The devil a word can you get for your pains, Hervey," said a gentleman\r\nof his acquaintance, who joined the party at this instant. "Why didn\'t\r\nyou stick to t\'other muse, who, to do her justice, is as arrant a flirt\r\nas your heart could wish for?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s danger in flirting," said Clarence, "with an arrant flirt of\r\nMrs. Stanhope\'s training. There\'s a kind of electricity about that girl.\r\nI have a sort of cobweb feeling, an imaginary net coming all over me."\r\n\r\n"Fore-warned is fore-armed," replied his companion: "a man must be a\r\nnovice indeed that could be taken in at this time of day by a niece of\r\nMrs. Stanhope\'s."\r\n\r\n"That Mrs. Stanhope must be a good clever dame, faith," said a third\r\ngentleman: "there\'s no less than six of her nieces whom she has got\r\noff within these four winters--not one of \'em now that has not made a\r\ncatch-match.--There\'s the eldest of the set, Mrs. Tollemache, what had\r\nshe, in the devil\'s name, to set up with in the world but a pair of good\r\neyes?--her aunt, to be sure, taught her the use of them early enough:\r\nthey might have rolled to all eternity before they would have rolled me\r\nout of my senses; but you see they did Tollemache\'s business. However,\r\nthey are going to part now, I hear: Tollemache was tired of her before\r\nthe honey-moon was over, as I foretold. Then there\'s the musical girl.\r\nJoddrell, who has no more ear than a post, went and married her, because\r\nhe had a mind to set up for a connoisseur in music; and Mrs. Stanhope\r\nflattered him that he was one."\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen joined in the general laugh: the tragic muse sighed.\r\n\r\n"Even were she at the School for Scandal, the tragic muse dare not\r\nlaugh, except behind her mask," said Clarence Hervey.\r\n\r\n"Far be it from her to laugh at those follies which she must for ever\r\ndeplore!" said Belinda, in a feigned voice.--"What miseries spring from\r\nthese ill-suited marriages! The victims are sacrificed before they have\r\nsense enough to avoid their fate."\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey imagined that this speech alluded to Lady Delacour\'s own\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n"Damn me if I know any woman, young or old, that would _avoid_ being\r\nmarried, if she could, though," cried Sir Philip Baddely, a gentleman\r\nwho always supplied "each vacuity of sense" with an oath: "but,\r\nRochfort, didn\'t Valleton marry one of these nieces?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: she was a mighty fine dancer, and had good legs enough: Mrs.\r\nStanhope got poor Valleton to fight a duel about her place in a country\r\ndance, and then he was so pleased with himself for his prowess, that he\r\nmarried the girl."\r\n\r\nBelinda made an effort to change her seat, but she was encompassed so\r\nthat she could not retreat.\r\n\r\n"As to Jenny Mason, the fifth of the _nieces_," continued the witty\r\ngentleman, "she was as brown as mahogany, and had neither eyes, nose,\r\nmouth, nor legs: what Mrs. Stanhope could do with her I often wondered;\r\nbut she took courage, _rouged_ her up, set her a going as a _dasher_,\r\nand she dashed herself into Tom Levit\'s curricle, and Tom couldn\'t get\r\nher out again till she was the honourable Mrs. Levit: she then took the\r\nreins into her own hands, and I hear she\'s driving him and herself _the\r\nroad to ruin_ as fast as they can gallop. As for this Belinda Portman,\r\n\'twas a good hit to send her to Lady Delacour\'s; but, I take it she\r\nhangs upon hand; for last winter, when I was at Bath, she was hawked\r\nabout every where, and the aunt was puffing her with might and main. You\r\nheard of nothing, wherever you went, but of Belinda Portman, and Belinda\r\nPortman\'s accomplishments: Belinda Portman, and her accomplishments,\r\nI\'ll swear, were as well advertised as Packwood\'s razor strops."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Stanhope overdid the business, I think," resumed the gentleman who\r\nbegan the conversation: "girls brought to the hammer this way don\'t go\r\noff well. It\'s true, Christie himself is no match for dame Stanhope.\r\nMany of my acquaintance were tempted to go and look at the premises, but\r\nnot one, you may be sure, had a thought of becoming a tenant for life."\r\n\r\n"That\'s an honour reserved for you, Clarence Hervey," said another,\r\ntapping him upon the shoulder.--"Give ye joy, Hervey; give ye joy!"\r\n\r\n"Me!" said Clarence, starting.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be hanged if he didn\'t change colour," said his facetious\r\ncompanion; and all the young men again joined in a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Laugh on, my merry men all!" cried Clarence; "but the devil\'s in it if\r\nI don\'t know my own mind better than any of you. You don\'t imagine I\r\ngo to Lady Delacour\'s to look for a _wife?_--Belinda Portman\'s a good\r\npretty girl, but what then? Do you think I\'m an idiot?--do you think I\r\ncould be taken in by one of the Stanhope school? Do you think I don\'t\r\nsee as plainly as any of you that Belinda Portman\'s a composition of art\r\nand affectation?"\r\n\r\n"Hush--not so loud, Clarence; here she comes," said his companion. "The\r\ncomic muse, is not she--?"\r\n\r\nLady Delacour, at this moment, came lightly tripping towards them,\r\nand addressing herself, in the character of the comic muse, to Hervey,\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n"Hervey! _my_ Hervey! most favoured of my votaries, why do you forsake\r\nme?\r\n\r\n    \'Why mourns my friend, why weeps his downcast eye?\r\n     That eye where mirth and fancy used to shine.\'\r\n\r\nThough you have lost your serpent\'s form, yet you may please any of the\r\nfair daughters of Eve in your own."\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey bowed; all the gentlemen who stood near him smiled; the\r\ntragic muse gave an involuntary sigh.\r\n\r\n"Could I borrow a sigh, or a tear, from my tragic sister," pursued Lady\r\nDelacour, "however unbecoming to my character, I would, if only sighs or\r\ntears can win the heart of Clarence Hervey:--let me practise"--and her\r\nladyship practised sighing with much comic effect.\r\n\r\n    "Persuasive words and more persuasive sighs,"\r\n\r\nsaid Clarence Hervey.\r\n\r\n"A good bold Stanhope cast of the net, faith," whispered one of his\r\ncompanions. "Melpomene, hast thou forgot thyself to marble?" pursued\r\nLady Delacour. "I am not very well," whispered Miss Portman to her\r\nladyship: "could we get away?"\r\n\r\n"Get away from Clarence Hervey, do you mean?" replied her ladyship, in\r\na whisper: "\'tis not easy, but we\'ll try what can be done, if it is\r\nnecessary."\r\n\r\nBelinda had no power to reply to this raillery; indeed, she scarcely\r\nheard the words that were said to her; but she put her arm within Lady\r\nDelacour\'s, who, to her great relief, had the good nature to leave the\r\nroom with her immediately. Her ladyship, though she would sacrifice the\r\nfeelings of others, without compunction, to her vanity, whenever\r\nthe power of her wit was disputed, yet towards those by whom it was\r\nacknowledged she showed some mercy.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with the child?" said she, as she went down the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, if I could have air," said Belinda. There was a crowd of\r\nservants in the hall.\r\n\r\n"Why does Lady Delacour avoid me so pertinaciously? What crime have I\r\ncommitted, that I was not favoured with one word?" said Clarence Hervey,\r\nwho had followed them down stairs, and overtook them in the hall.\r\n\r\n"Do see if you can find any of my people," cried Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Lady Delacour, the comic muse!" exclaimed Mr. Hervey. "I thought--"\r\n\r\n"No matter what you thought," interrupted her ladyship. "Let my\r\ncarriage draw up, for here\'s a young friend of yours trembling so about\r\n_nothing_, that I am half afraid she will faint; and you know it would\r\nnot be so pleasant to faint here amongst footmen. Stay! this room is\r\nempty. O, I did not mean to tell _you_ to stay," said she to Hervey, who\r\ninvoluntarily followed her in the utmost consternation.\r\n\r\n"I\'m perfectly well, now--perfectly well," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Perfectly a simpleton, I think," said Lady Delacour. "Nay, my dear, you\r\nmust be ruled; your mask must come off: didn\'t you tell me you wanted\r\nair?--What now! This is not the first time Clarence Hervey has ever\r\nseen your face without a mask, is it? It\'s the first time indeed he, or\r\nanybody else, ever saw it of such a colour, I believe."\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Delacour pulled off Belinda\'s mask, her face was, during the\r\nfirst instant, pale; the next moment, crimsoned over with a burning\r\nblush.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with ye both? How he stands!" said Lady Delacour,\r\nturning to Mr. Hervey. "Did you never see a woman blush before?--or did\r\nyou never say or do any thing to make a woman blush before? Will you\r\ngive Miss Portman a glass of water?--there\'s some behind you on that\r\nsideboard, man!--but he has neither eyes, ears, nor understanding.--Do\r\ngo about your business," said her ladyship, pushing him towards the\r\ndoor--"Do go about your business, for I haven\'t common patience with\r\nyou: on my conscience I believe the man\'s in love--and not with me!\r\nThat\'s sal-volatile for you, child, I perceive," continued she to\r\nBelinda. "O, you can walk now--but remember you are on slippery ground:\r\nremember Clarence Hervey is not a marrying man, and you are not a\r\nmarried woman."\r\n\r\n"It is perfectly indifferent to me, madam," Belinda said, with a voice\r\nand look of proud indignation.\r\n\r\n"Lady Delacour, your carriage has drawn up," said Clarence Hervey,\r\nreturning to the door, but without entering.\r\n\r\n"Then put this \'perfectly well\' and \'perfectly indifferent\' lady into\r\nit," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed without uttering a syllable.\r\n\r\n"Dumb! absolutely dumb! I protest," said her ladyship, as he handed her\r\nin afterwards. "Why, Clarence, the casting of your serpent\'s skin seems\r\nto have quite changed your nature--nothing but the simplicity of the\r\ndove left; and I expect to hear, you cooing presently--don\'t you, Miss\r\nPortman?" She ordered the coachman to drive to the Pantheon.\r\n\r\n"To the Pantheon! I was in hopes your ladyship would have the goodness\r\nto set me down at home; for indeed I shall be a burden to you and\r\neverybody else at the masquerade."\r\n\r\n"If you have made any appointment for the rest of the evening in\r\nBerkley-square, I\'ll set you down, certainly, if you insist upon it, my\r\ndear--for punctuality is a virtue; but prudence is a virtue too, in a\r\nyoung lady; who, as your aunt Stanhope would say, has to _establish_\r\nherself in the world. Why these tears, Belinda?--or are they tears? for\r\nby the light of the lamps I can scarcely tell; though I\'ll swear I saw\r\nthe handkerchief at the eyes. What is the meaning of all this? You\'d\r\nbest trust me--for I know as much of men and manners as your aunt\r\nStanhope at least; and in one word, you have nothing to fear from me,\r\nand every thing to hope from yourself, if you will only dry up your\r\ntears, _keep on your mask_, and take my advice; you\'ll find it as good\r\nas your aunt Stanhope\'s."\r\n\r\n"My aunt Stanhope\'s! O," cried Belinda, "never, never more will I take\r\nsuch advice; never more will I expose myself to be insulted as a female\r\nadventurer.--Little did I know in what a light I appeared; little did\r\nI know what _gentlemen_ thought of my aunt Stanhope, of my cousins, of\r\nmyself!"\r\n\r\n"_Gentlemen_! I presume Clarence Hervey stands at this instant, in your\r\nimagination, as the representative of all the gentlemen in England; and\r\nhe, instead of Anacharsis Cloots, is now, to be sure, l\'orateur du genre\r\nhumain. Pray let me have a specimen of the eloquence, which, to judge by\r\nits effects, must be powerful indeed."\r\n\r\nMiss Portman, not without some reluctance, repeated the conversation\r\nwhich she had heard.--"And is this all?" cried Lady Delacour. "Lord,\r\nmy dear, you must either give up living in the world, or expect to\r\nhear yourself, and your aunts, and your cousins, and your friends, from\r\ngeneration to generation, abused every hour in the day by their friends\r\nand your friends; \'tis the common course of things. Now you know what a\r\nmultitude of obedient humble servants, dear creatures, and very sincere\r\nand most affectionate friends, I have in my writing-desk, and on my\r\nmantel-piece, not to mention the cards which crowd the common rack from\r\nintimate acquaintance, who cannot live without the honour, or favour,\r\nor pleasure of seeing Lady Delacour twice a week;--do you think I\'m fool\r\nenough to imagine that they would care the hundredth part of a straw if\r\nI were this minute thrown into the Red or the Black Sea?--No, I have not\r\none _real_ friend in the world except Harriot Freke; yet, you see I\r\nam the comic muse, and mean to keep it up--keep it up to the last--on\r\npurpose to provoke those who would give their eyes to be able to pity\r\nme;--I humbly thank them, no pity for Lady Delacour. Follow my example,\r\nBelinda; elbow your way through the crowd: if you stop to be civil and\r\nbeg pardon, and \'_hope I didn\'t hurt ye_,\' you will be trod under foot.\r\nNow you\'ll meet those young men continually who took the liberty of\r\nlaughing at your aunt, and your cousins, and yourself; they are men of\r\nfashion. Show them you\'ve no feeling, and they\'ll acknowledge you for\r\na woman of fashion. You\'ll marry better than any of your\r\ncousins,--Clarence Hervey if you can; and then it will be your turn to\r\nlaugh about nets and cages. As to love and all that--"\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped at the Pantheon just as her ladyship came to the\r\nwords "love and all that." Her thoughts took a different turn, and\r\nduring the remainder of the night she exhibited, in such a manner as to\r\nattract universal admiration, all the ease, and grace, and gaiety, of\r\nEuphrosyne.\r\n\r\nTo Belinda the night appeared long and dull: the commonplace wit of\r\nchimney-sweepers and gipsies, the antics of harlequins, the graces\r\nof flower-girls and Cleopatras, had not power to amuse her; for her\r\nthoughts still recurred to that conversation which had given her so much\r\npain--a pain which Lady Delacour\'s raillery had failed to obliterate.\r\n\r\n"How happy you are, Lady Delacour," said she, when they got into the\r\ncarriage to go home; "how happy you are to have such an amazing flow of\r\nspirits!"\r\n\r\n"Amazing you might well say, if you knew all," said Lady Delacour; and\r\nshe heaved a deep sigh, threw herself back in the carriage, let fall her\r\nmask, and was silent. It was broad daylight, and Belinda had a full view\r\nof her countenance, which was the picture of despair. She uttered not\r\none syllable more, nor had Miss Portman the courage to interrupt her\r\nmeditations till they came within sight, of Lady Singleton\'s, when\r\nBelinda ventured to remind her that she had resolved to stop there and\r\nchange dresses before Marriott saw them.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s no matter," said Lady Delacour; "Marriott will leave me at the\r\nlast, like all the rest--\'tis no matter." Her ladyship sunk back into\r\nher former attitude; but after she had remained silent for some minutes,\r\nshe started up and exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"If I had served myself with half the zeal that I have served the\r\nworld, I should not now be thus forsaken! I have sacrificed reputation,\r\nhappiness, every thing to the love of frolic:--all frolic will soon be\r\nat an end with me--I am dying--and I shall die unlamented by any human\r\nbeing. If I were to live my life over again, what a different life it\r\nshould be!--What a different person _I would be!_[1]--But it is all over\r\nnow--I am dying."\r\n\r\nBelinda\'s astonishment at these words, and at the solemn manner in which\r\nthey were pronounced, was inexpressible; she gazed at Lady Delacour, and\r\nthen repeated the word,--\'dying!\'--"Yes, dying!" said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"But you seem to me, and to all the world, in perfect health; and but\r\nhalf an hour ago in perfect spirits," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"I seem to you and to all the world, what I am not--I tell you I am\r\ndying," said her ladyship in an emphatic tone.\r\n\r\nNot a word more passed till they got home. Lady Delacour hurried up\r\nstairs, bidding Belinda follow her to her dressing-room. Marriott was\r\nlighting the six wax candles on the dressing-table.--"As I live, they\r\nhave changed dresses after all," said Marriott to herself, as she fixed\r\nher eyes upon Lady Delacour and Miss Portman. "I\'ll be burnt, if I don\'t\r\nmake my lady remember this."\r\n\r\n"Marriott, you need not wait; I\'ll ring when I want you," said Lady\r\nDelacour; and taking one of the candles from the table, she passed\r\non hastily with Miss Portman through her dressing-room, through her\r\nbedchamber, and to the door of the mysterious cabinet.\r\n\r\n"Marriott, the key of this door," cried she impatiently, after she had\r\nin vain attempted to open it.\r\n\r\n"Heavenly graciousness!" cried Marriott; "is my lady out of her senses?"\r\n\r\n"The key--the key--quick, the key," repeated Lady Delacour, in a\r\nperemptory tone. She seized it as soon as Marriott drew it from her\r\npocket, and unlocked the door.\r\n\r\n"Had not I best put _the things_ to rights, my lady?" said Marriott,\r\ncatching fast hold of the opening door.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll ring when you are wanted, Marriott," said Lady Delacour; and\r\npushing open the door with violence she rushed forward to the middle of\r\nthe room, and turning back, she beckoned to Belinda to follow her--"Come\r\nin; what is it you are afraid of?" said she. Belinda went on, and the\r\nmoment she was in the room, Lady Delacour shut and locked the door. The\r\nroom was rather dark, as there was no light in it except what came from\r\nthe candle which Lady Delacour held in her hand, and which burned but\r\ndimly. Belinda, as she looked round, saw nothing but a confusion of\r\nlinen rags; vials, some empty, some full, and she perceived that there\r\nwas a strong smell of medicines.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour, whose motions were all precipitate, like those of a\r\nperson whose mind is in great agitation, looked from side to side of the\r\nroom, without seeming to know what she was in search of. She then,\r\nwith a species of fury, wiped the paint from her face, and returning to\r\nBelinda, held the candle so as to throw the light full upon her livid\r\nfeatures. Her eyes were sunk, her cheeks hollow; no trace of youth or\r\nbeauty remained on her death-like countenance, which formed a horrid\r\ncontrast with her gay fantastic dress.\r\n\r\n"You are shocked, Belinda," said she; "but as yet you have seen\r\nnothing--look here,"--and baring one half of her bosom, she revealed a\r\nhideous spectacle.\r\n\r\nBelinda sunk back into a chair; Lady Delacour flung herself on her knees\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n"Am I humbled, am I wretched enough?" cried she, her voice trembling\r\nwith agony. "Yes, pity me for what you have seen, and a thousand times\r\nmore for that which you cannot see:--my mind is eaten away like my\r\nbody by incurable disease--inveterate remorse--remorse for a life of\r\nfolly--of folly which has brought on me all the punishments of guilt."\r\n\r\n"My husband," continued she, and her voice suddenly altered from the\r\ntone of grief to that of anger--"my husband hates me--no matter--I\r\ndespise him. His relations hate me--no matter--I despise them. My own\r\nrelations hate me--no matter, I never wish to see them more--never shall\r\nthey see my sorrow--never shall they hear a complaint, a sigh from me.\r\nThere is no torture which I could not more easily endure than their\r\ninsulting pity. I will die, as I have lived, the envy and admiration\r\nof the world. When I am gone, let them find out their mistake; and\r\nmoralize, if they will, over my grave." She paused. Belinda had no power\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n"Promise, swear to me," resumed Lady Delacour vehemently, seizing\r\nBelinda\'s hand, "that you will never reveal to any mortal what you\r\nhave seen and heard this night. No living creature suspects that Lady\r\nDelacour is dying by inches, except Marriott and that woman whom but a\r\nfew hours ago I thought my _real friend_, to whom I trusted every secret\r\nof my life, every thought of my heart. Fool! idiot! dupe that I was to\r\ntrust to the friendship of a woman whom I knew to be without principle:\r\nbut I thought she had honour; I thought she could never betray _me_,--O\r\nHarriot! Harriot! you to desert me!--Any thing else I could have\r\nborne--but you, who I thought would have supported me in the tortures of\r\nmind and body which I am to go through--you that I thought would receive\r\nmy last breath--you to desert me!--Now I am alone in the world--left to\r\nthe mercy of an insolent waiting-woman."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour hid her face in Belinda\'s lap, and almost stifled by the\r\nviolence of contending emotions, she at last gave vent to them, and\r\nsobbed aloud.\r\n\r\n"Trust to one," said Belinda, pressing her hand, with all the tenderness\r\nwhich humanity could dictate, "who will never leave you at the mercy of\r\nan insolent waiting-woman--trust to me."\r\n\r\n"Trust to you!" said Lady Delacour, looking up eagerly in Belinda\'s\r\nface; "yes--I think--I may trust to you; for though a niece of Mrs.\r\nStanhope\'s, I have seen this day, and have seen with surprise, symptoms\r\nof artless feeling about you. This was what tempted me to open my mind\r\nto you when I found that I had lost the only friend--but I will think\r\nno more of that--if you have a heart, you must feel for me.--Leave\r\nme now--tomorrow you shall hear my whole history--now I am quite\r\nexhausted--ring for Marriott." Marriott appeared with a face of\r\nconstrained civility and latent rage. "Put me to bed, Marriott," said\r\nLady Delacour, with a subdued voice; "but first light Miss Portman to\r\nher room--she need not--yet--see the horrid business of my toilette."\r\n\r\nBelinda, when she was left alone, immediately opened her shutters, and\r\nthrew up the sash, to refresh herself with the morning air. She felt\r\nexcessively fatigued, and in the hurry of her mind she could not think\r\nof any thing distinctly. She took off her masquerade dress, and went\r\nto bed in hopes of forgetting, for a few hours, what she felt indelibly\r\nimpressed upon her imagination. But it was in vain that she endeavoured\r\nto compose herself to sleep; her ideas were in too great and painful\r\nconfusion. For some time, whenever she closed her eyes, the face and\r\nform of Lady Delacour, such as she had just beheld them, seemed to\r\nhaunt her; afterwards, the idea of Clarence Hervey, and the painful\r\nrecollection of the conversation she had overheard, recurred to her: the\r\nwords, "Do you think I don\'t know that Belinda Portman is a composition\r\nof art and affectation?" fixed in her memory. She recollected with the\r\nutmost minuteness every look of contempt which she had seen in the faces\r\nof the young men whilst they spoke of Mrs. Stanhope, the match-maker.\r\nBelinda\'s mind, however, was not yet sufficiently calm to reflect; she\r\nseemed only to live over again the preceding night. At last, the strange\r\nmotley figures which she had seen at the masquerade flitted before her\r\neyes, and she sunk into an uneasy slumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLADY DELACOUR\'S HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Portman was awakened by the ringing of Lady Delacour\'s bedchamber\r\nbell. She opened her eyes with the confused idea that something\r\ndisagreeable had happened; and before she had distinctly recollected\r\nherself, Marriott came to her bedside, with a note from Lady Delacour:\r\nit was written with a pencil.\r\n\r\n"DELACOUR--_my_ lord!!!! is to have to-day what Garrick used to call\r\na _gander feast_--will you dine with me tete-a-tete, and I\'ll write\r\nan _excuse_, alias a lie, to Lady Singleton, in the form of a charming\r\nnote--I pique myself _sur l\'eloquence du billet_--then we shall have the\r\nevening to ourselves. I have much to say, as people usually have when\r\nthey begin to talk of themselves.\r\n\r\n"I have taken a double dose of opium, and am not so horribly out of\r\nspirits as I was last night; so you need not be afraid of another\r\n_scene_.\r\n\r\n"Let me see you in my dressing-room, dear Belinda, as soon as you have\r\nadored\r\n\r\n    \'With head uncover\'d the cosmetic powers.\'\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t paint--no matter--you will--you must--every body must,\r\nsooner or later. In the mean time, whenever you want to send a note that\r\nshall not be opened by _the bearer_, put your trust neither in wafer\r\nnor wax, but twist it as I twist mine. You see I wish to put you in\r\npossession of some valuable secrets before I leave this world--this,\r\nby-the-bye, I don\'t, upon second thoughts, which are always best, mean\r\nto do yet. There certainly were such people as Amazons--I hope you\r\nadmire them--for who could live without the admiration of Belinda\r\nPortman?--not Clarence Hervey assuredly--nor yet\r\n\r\n"T. C. H. DELACOUR."\r\n\r\nBelinda obeyed the summons to her ladyship\'s dressing-room: she found\r\nLady Delacour with her face completely repaired with paint, and her\r\nspirits with opium. She was in high consultation with Marriott and Mrs.\r\nFranks, the milliner, about the crape petticoat of her birthnight\r\ndress, which was extended over a large hoop in full state. Mrs. Franks\r\ndescanted long and learnedly upon festoons and loops, knots and fringes,\r\nsubmitting all the time every thing to her ladyship\'s better judgment.\r\n\r\nMarriott was sulky and silent. She opened her lips but once upon the\r\nquestion of laburnum or no laburnum flowers.\r\n\r\nAgainst them she quoted the memoirs and authority of the celebrated Mrs.\r\nBellamy, who has a case in point to prove that "straw colour must ever\r\nlook like dirty white by candlelight." Mrs. Franks, to compromise the\r\nmatter, proposed gold laburnums, "because nothing can look better by\r\ncandlelight, or any light, than gold;" and Lady Delacour, who was afraid\r\nthat the milliner\'s imagination, now that it had once touched upon gold,\r\nmight be led to the vulgar idea of _ready money_, suddenly broke up the\r\nconference, by exclaiming,\r\n\r\n"We shall be late at Phillips\'s exhibition of French china. Mrs. Franks\r\nmust let us see her again to-morrow, to take into consideration\r\nyour court dress, my dear Belinda--\'Miss Portman presented by Lady\r\nDelacour\'--Mrs. Franks, let her dress, for heaven\'s sake, be something\r\nthat will make a fine paragraph:--I give you four-and-twenty hours to\r\nthink of it. I have done a horrid act this day," continued she, after\r\nMrs. Franks had left the room--"absolutely written a _twisted_ note to\r\nClarence Hervey, my dear--but why did I tell you that? Now your head\r\nwill run upon the twisted note all day, instead of upon \'The Life and\r\nOpinions of a Lady of Quality, related by herself.\'"\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Lady Delacour having made Belinda protest and blush, and\r\nblush and protest, that her head was not running upon the twisted note,\r\nbegan the history of her life and opinions in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n"I do nothing by halves, my dear. I shall not tell you my adventures as\r\nGil Blas told his to the Count d\'Olivarez--skipping over the _useful_\r\npassages. I am no hypocrite, and have nothing worse than folly to\r\nconceal: that\'s bad enough--for a woman who is known to play the fool\r\nis always suspected of playing the devil. But I begin where I ought\r\nto end--with my moral, which I dare say you are not impatient to\r\nanticipate. I never read or listened to a moral at the end of a story in\r\nmy life:--manners for me, and morals for those that like them. My dear,\r\nyou will be woefully disappointed if in my story you expect any thing\r\nlike a novel. I once heard a general say, that nothing was less like a\r\nreview than a battle; and I can tell you that nothing is more unlike a\r\nnovel than real life. Of all lives, mine has been the least romantic.\r\nNo love in it, but a great deal of hate. I was a rich heiress--I had, I\r\nbelieve, a hundred thousand pounds, or more, and twice as many caprices:\r\nI was handsome and witty--or, to speak with that kind of circumlocution\r\nwhich is called humility, the world, the partial world, thought me a\r\nbeauty and a bel-esprit. Having told you my fortune, need I add, that I,\r\nor it, had lovers in abundance--of all sorts and degrees--not to reckon\r\nthose, it may be presumed, who died of concealed passions for me? I had\r\nsixteen declarations and proposals in form; then what in the name\r\nof wonder, or of common sense--which by-the-bye is the greatest of\r\nwonders--what, in the name of common sense, made me marry Lord Delacour?\r\nWhy, my dear, you--no, not _you_, but any girl who is not used to have\r\na parcel of admirers, would think it the easiest thing in the world to\r\nmake her choice; but let her judge by what she feels when a dexterous\r\nmercer or linen-draper produces pretty thing after pretty thing--and\r\nthis is so becoming, and this will wear for ever, as he swears; but then\r\nthat\'s so fashionable;--the novice stands in a charming perplexity, and\r\nafter examining, and doubting, and tossing over half the goods in the\r\nshop, it\'s ten to one, when it begins to get late, the young lady, in a\r\nhurry, pitches upon the very ugliest and worst thing that she has seen.\r\nJust so it was with me and my lovers, and just so--\r\n\r\n   \'Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,\'\r\n\r\nI pitched upon Viscount Delacour for my lord and judge. He had just at\r\nthat time lost at Newmarket more than he was worth in every sense of the\r\nword; and my fortune was the most convenient thing in the world to a man\r\nin his condition. Lozenges are of sovereign use in some complaints. The\r\nheiress lozenge is a specific in some consumptions. You are surprised\r\nthat I can laugh and jest about such a melancholy thing as my marriage\r\nwith Lord Delacour; and so am I, especially when I recollect all\r\nthe circumstances; for though I bragged of there being no love in\r\nmy history, there was when I was a goose or a gosling of about\r\neighteen--just your age, Belinda, I think--something very like love\r\nplaying about my heart, or my head. There was a certain Henry Percival,\r\na Clarence Hervey of a man--no, he had ten times the sense, begging your\r\npardon, of Clarence Hervey--his misfortune, or mine, was, that he had\r\ntoo much sense--he was in love with me, but not with my faults; now I,\r\nwisely considering that my faults were the greatest part of me, insisted\r\nupon his being in love with my faults. He wouldn\'t, or couldn\'t--I said\r\nwouldn\'t, he said couldn\'t. I had been used to see the men about me lick\r\nthe dust at my feet, for it was gold dust. Percival made wry faces--Lord\r\nDelacour made none. I pointed him out to Percival as an example--it was\r\nan example he would not follow. I was provoked, and I married in hopes\r\nof provoking the man I loved. The worst of it was, I did not provoke\r\nhim as much as I expected. Six months afterwards I heard of his marriage\r\nwith a very amiable woman. I hate those _very amiable women_. Poor\r\nPercival! I should have been a very happy woman, I fancy, if I had\r\nmarried you--for I believe you were the only man who ever really loved\r\nme; but all that is over now!--Where were we? O, I married my Lord\r\nDelacour, knowing him to be a fool, and believing that, for this reason,\r\nI should find no trouble in governing him. But what a fatal mistake!-a\r\nfool, of all animals in the creation, is the most difficult to govern.\r\nWe set out in the fashionable world with a mutual desire to be as\r\nextravagant as possible. Strange, that with this similarity of taste we\r\ncould never agree!--strange, that this similarity of taste was the cause\r\nof our perpetual quarrels! During the first year of our marriage, I had\r\nalways the upper hand in these disputes, and the last word; and I was\r\ncontent. Stubborn as the brute was, I thought I should in time break him\r\nin. From the specimens you have seen, you may guess that I was even then\r\na tolerable proficient in the dear art of _tormenting_. I had almost\r\ngained my point, just broken my lord\'s heart, when one fair morning I\r\nunluckily told his man Champfort that he knew no more how to cut hair\r\nthan a sheep-shearer. Champfort, who is conceit personified, took mortal\r\noffence at this; and the devil, who is always at hand to turn anger into\r\nmalice, put it into Champfort\'s head to put it into my lord\'s head, that\r\nthe world thought--\'_My lady governed him_.\' My lord took fire. They\r\nsay the torpedo, the coldest of cold creatures, sometimes gives out\r\na spark--I suppose when electrified with anger. The next time that\r\ninnocent I insisted upon my Lord Delacour\'s doing or not doing--I forget\r\nwhich--the most reasonable thing in the world, my lord turns short\r\nround, and answers--\'My Lady Delacour, I am not a man to be governed by\r\na wife.\'--And from that time to this the words, \'I am not a man to be\r\ngoverned by a wife,\' have been written in his obstinate face, as all the\r\nworld who can read the human countenance may see. My dear, I laugh; but\r\neven in the midst of laughter there is sadness. But you don\'t know\r\nwhat it is--I hope you never may--to have an obstinate fool for a bosom\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"I at first flattered myself that my lord\'s was not an inveterate,\r\nincurable malady: but from his obvious weakness, I might have seen\r\nthat there was no hope; for cases of obstinacy are always dangerous in\r\nproportion to the weakness of the patient. My lord\'s case was desperate.\r\nKill or cure was my humane or prudent maxim. I determined to try the\r\npoison of jealousy, by way of an alterative. I had long kept it in petto\r\nas my ultimate remedy. I fixed upon a proper subject--a man with whom\r\nI thought that I could coquette to all eternity, without any danger to\r\nmyself--a certain Colonel Lawless, as empty a coxcomb as you would\r\nwish to see. The world, said I to myself, can never be so absurd as to\r\nsuspect Lady Delacour with such a man as this, though her lord may,\r\nand will; for nothing is too absurd for him to believe. Half my theory\r\nproved just; that is saying a great deal for any theory. My lord\r\nswallowed the remedy that I had prepared for him with an avidity and a\r\nbonhommie which it did me good to behold; my remedy operated beyond my\r\nmost sanguine expectations. The poor man was cured of his obstinacy, and\r\nbecame stark mad with jealousy. Then indeed I had some hopes of him;\r\nfor a madman can be managed, a fool cannot. In a month\'s time I made him\r\nquite docile. With a face longer than the weeping philosopher\'s, he came\r\nto me one morning, and assured me, \'he would do every thing I pleased,\r\nprovided I would consult my own honour and his, and give up Colonel\r\nLawless.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Give up!\'--I could hardly forbear laughing at the expression. I\r\nreplied, \'that as long as my lord treated me with becoming respect, I\r\nhad never in thought or deed given him just cause of complaint; but that\r\nI was not a woman to be insulted, or to be kept, as I had hitherto\r\nbeen, in leading-strings by a husband.\' My lord, flattered as I meant he\r\nshould be with the idea that it was possible he should be suspected of\r\nkeeping a wife in leading-strings, fell to making protestations--\'He\r\nhoped his future conduct would prove,\' &c. Upon this hint, I gave the\r\nreins to my imagination, and full drive I went into a fresh career\r\nof extravagance: if I were checked, it was _an insult_, and I began\r\ndirectly to talk of _leading-strings_. This ridiculous game I played\r\nsuccessfully enough for some time, till at length, though naturally\r\nrather slow at calculation, he actually discovered, that if we lived at\r\nthe rate of twenty thousand a-year, and had only ten thousand a-year to\r\nspend, we should in due time have nothing left. This notable discovery\r\nhe communicated to me one morning, after a long preamble. When he had\r\nfinished prosing, I agreed that it was demonstrably just that he should\r\nretrench _his_ expenses; but that it was equally unjust and impossible\r\nthat I could make any reformation in _my_ civil list: that economy was a\r\nword which I had never heard of in my life till I married his lordship;\r\nthat, upon second recollection, it was true I had heard of such a thing\r\nas national economy, and that it would be a very pretty, though rather\r\nhackneyed topic of declamation for a maiden speech in the House of\r\nLords. I therefore advised him to reserve all he had to say upon the\r\nsubject for the noble lord upon the woolsack; nay, I very graciously\r\nadded, that upon this condition I would go to the house myself to give\r\nhis arguments and eloquence a fair hearing, and that I would do my best\r\nto keep myself awake. This was all mighty playful and witty; but it\r\nhappened that my Lord Delacour, who never had any great taste for wit,\r\ncould not this unlucky morning at all relish it. Of course I grew\r\nangry, and reminded him, with an indelicacy which his want of generosity\r\njustified, that an heiress, who had brought a hundred thousand pounds\r\ninto his family, had some right to amuse herself, and that it was not my\r\nfault if elegant amusements were more expensive than others.\r\n\r\n"Then came a long criminating and recriminating chapter. It was,\r\n\'My lord, your Newmarket blunders\'--\'My lady, your cursed\r\n_theatricals_\'--\'My lord, I have surely a right\'--and, \'My lady, I have\r\nsurely as good a right.\'\r\n\r\n"But, my dear Belinda, however we might pay one another, we could not\r\npay all the world with words. In short, after running through thousands\r\nand tens of thousands, we were actually in distress for money. Then\r\ncame selling of lands, and I don\'t know what devices for raising\r\nmoney, according to the modes of lawyers and attorneys. It was quite\r\nindifferent to me how they got money, provided they did get it. By what\r\nart these gentlemen raised money, I never troubled myself to inquire; it\r\nmight have been the black art, for any thing I know to the contrary. I\r\nknow nothing of business. So I signed all the papers they brought to me;\r\nand I was mighty well pleased to find, that by so easy an expedient as\r\nwriting \'T. C. H. Delacour,\' I could command money at will. I signed,\r\nand signed, till at last I was with all due civility informed that my\r\nsignature was no longer worth a farthing; and when I came to inquire\r\ninto the cause of this phenomenon, I could nowise understand what my\r\nLord Delacour\'s lawyer said to me: he was a prig, and I had not patience\r\neither to listen to him or to look at him. I sent for an old uncle of\r\nmine, who used to manage all my money matters before I was married:\r\nI put the uncle and the lawyer into a room, together with their\r\nparchments, to fight the matter out, or to come to a right understanding\r\nif they could. The last, it seems, was quite impossible. In the course\r\nof half an hour, out comes my uncle in such a rage! I never shall forget\r\nhis face--all the bile in his body had gotten into it; he had literally\r\nno whites to his eyes. \'My dear uncle,\' said I, \'what is the matter?\r\nWhy, you are absolutely gold stick in waiting.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No matter what I am, child,\' said the uncle; \'I\'ll tell you what you\r\nare, with all your wit--a dupe: \'tis a shame for a woman of your sense\r\nto be such a fool, and to know nothing of business; and if you knew\r\nnothing yourself, could not you send for me?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I was too ignorant to know that I know nothing,\' said I. But I will\r\nnot trouble you with all the said I\'s and said he\'s. I was made to\r\nunderstand, that if Lord Delacour were to die the next day, I should\r\nlive a beggar. Upon this I grew serious, as you may imagine. My uncle\r\nassured me that I had been grossly imposed upon by my lord and his\r\nlawyer; and that I had been swindled out of my senses, and out of my\r\ndower. I repeated all that my uncle said, very faithfully, to Lord\r\nDelacour; and all that either he or his lawyer could furnish out by\r\nway of answer was, that \'Necessity had no law.\' Necessity, it must be\r\nallowed, though it might be the mother of law, was never with my lord\r\nthe mother of invention. Having now found out that I had a good right to\r\ncomplain, I indulged myself in it most gloriously; in short, my dear, we\r\nhad a comfortable family quarrel. Love quarrels are easily made up, but\r\nof money quarrels there is no end. From the moment these money quarrels\r\ncommenced, I began to hate Lord Delacour; before, I had only despised\r\nhim. You can have no notion to what meanness extravagance reduces men.\r\nI have known Lord Delacour shirk, and look so shabby, and tell so many\r\nlies to people about a hundred guineas--a hundred guineas!--what do I\r\nsay?--about twenty, ten, five! O, my dear, I cannot bear the thoughts of\r\nit!\r\n\r\n"But I was going on to tell you, that my good uncle and all my relations\r\nquarrelled with me for having ruined myself, as they said; but I said\r\nthey quarrelled with me for fear I should ask them for some of their\r\n\'_vile trash_.\' Accordingly, I abused and ridiculed them, one and all;\r\nand for my pains, all my acquaintance said, that \'Lady Delacour was a\r\nwoman of a vast deal of spirit.\'\r\n\r\n"We were relieved from our money embarrassments by the timely death of a\r\nrich nobleman, to whose large estate my Lord Delacour was heir-at-law. I\r\nwas intoxicated with the idle compliments of all my acquaintance, and\r\nI endeavoured to console myself for misery at home by gaiety abroad.\r\nAmbitious of pleasing universally, I became the worst of slaves---a\r\nslave to the world. Not a moment of my time was at my own disposal--not\r\none of my actions; I may say, not one of my thoughts was my own; I was\r\nobliged to find things \'charming\' every hour, which tired me to death;\r\nand every day it was the same dull round of hypocrisy and dissipation.\r\nYou wonder to hear me speak in this manner, Belinda--but one must speak\r\nthe truth sometimes; and this is what I have been saying to Harriot\r\nFreke continually, for these ten years past. Then why persist in the\r\nsame kind of life? you say. Why, my dear, because I could not stop: I\r\nwas fit for this kind of life and for no other: I could not be happy at\r\n_home_; for what sort of a companion could I have made of Lord Delacour?\r\nBy this time he was tired of his horse Potatoe, and his horse Highflyer,\r\nand his horse Eclipse, and Goliah, and Jenny Grey, &c.; and he had taken\r\nto hard drinking, which soon turned him, as you see, quite into a beast.\r\n\r\n"I forgot to tell you that I had three children during the first five\r\nyears of my marriage. The first was a boy: he was born dead; and my\r\nlord, and all his odious relations, laid the blame upon me, because I\r\nwould not be kept prisoner half a year by an old mother of his, a vile\r\nCassandra, who was always prophesying that my child would not be born\r\nalive. My second child was a girl; but a poor diminutive, sickly thing.\r\nIt was the fashion at this time for fine mothers to suckle their own\r\nchildren: so much the worse for the poor brats. Fine nurses never made\r\nfine children. There was a prodigious rout made about the matter; a vast\r\ndeal of sentiment and sympathy, and compliments and inquiries; but after\r\nthe novelty was over, I became heartily sick of the business; and at the\r\nend of about three months my poor child was sick too--I don\'t much like\r\nto think of it--it died. If I had put it out to nurse, I should have\r\nbeen thought by my friends an unnatural mother; but I should have saved\r\nits life. I should have bewailed the loss of the infant more, if Lord\r\nDelacour\'s relations and my own had not made such lamentations upon the\r\noccasion that I was stunned. I couldn\'t or wouldn\'t shed a tear; and I\r\nleft it to the old dowager to perform in public, as she wished, the part\r\nof chief mourner, and to comfort herself in private by lifting up her\r\nhands and eyes, and railing at me as the most insensible of mothers. All\r\nthis time I suffered more than she did; but that is what she shall\r\nnever have the satisfaction of knowing. I determined, that if ever I\r\nhad another child, I would not have the barbarity to nurse it myself.\r\nAccordingly when my third child, a girl, was born, I sent it off\r\nimmediately to the country, to a stout, healthy, broad-faced nurse,\r\nunder whose care it grew and flourished; so that at three years old,\r\nwhen it was brought back to me, I could scarcely believe the chubby\r\nlittle thing was my own child. The same reasons which convinced me I\r\nought not to nurse my own child, determined me, _a plus forte raison_,\r\nnot to undertake its education. Lord Delacour could not bear the\r\nchild, because it was not a boy. The girl was put under the care of a\r\ngoverness, who plagued my heart out with her airs and tracasseries for\r\nthree or four years; at the end of which time, as she turned out to be\r\nLord Delacour\'s mistress in form, I was obliged--in form--to beg she\r\nwould leave my house: and I put her pupil into better hands, I hope, at\r\na celebrated academy for young ladies. There she will, at any rate, be\r\nbetter instructed than she could be at home. I beg your pardon, my\r\ndear, for this digression on nursing and schooling; but I wanted only\r\nto explain to you why it was that, when I was weary of the business, I\r\nstill went on in a course of dissipation. You see I had nothing at home,\r\neither in the shape of husband or children, to engage my affections.\r\nI believe it was this \'aching void\' in my heart which made me, after\r\nlooking abroad some time for a bosom friend, take such a prodigious\r\nfancy to Mrs. Freke. She was just then coming into fashion; she struck\r\nme, the first time I met her, as being downright ugly; but there was a\r\nwild oddity in her countenance which made one stare at her, and she\r\nwas delighted to be stared at, especially by me; so we were mutually\r\nagreeable to each other--I as starer, and she as staree. Harriot Freke\r\nhad, without comparison, more assurance than any man or woman I ever\r\nsaw; she was downright brass, but of the finest kind--Corinthian brass.\r\nShe was one of the first who brought what I call _harum scarum_ manners\r\ninto fashion. I told you that she had assurance--_impudence_ I should\r\nhave called it, for no other word is strong enough. Such things as\r\nI have heard Harriot Freke say!---You will not believe it--but her\r\nconversation at first absolutely made me, like an old-fashioned fool,\r\nwish I had a fan to play with. But, to my astonishment, all this _took_\r\nsurprisingly with a set of fashionable young men. I found it necessary\r\nto _reform_ my manners. If I had not taken heart of grace, and\r\npublicly abjured the heresies of _false delicacy_, I should have been\r\nexcommunicated. Lady Delacour\'s sprightly elegance--allow me to speak\r\nof myself in the style in which the newspaper writers talk of me--Lady\r\nDelacour\'s sprightly elegance was but pale, not to say _faded_ pink,\r\ncompared with the scarlet of Mrs. Freke\'s dashing audacity. As my rival,\r\nshe would on certain ground have beat me hollow; it was therefore good\r\npolicy to make her my friend: we joined forces, and nothing could stand\r\nagainst us. But I have no right to give myself credit for good policy in\r\nforming this intimacy; I really followed the dictates of my heart or my\r\nimagination. There was a frankness in Harriot\'s manner which I mistook\r\nfor artlessness of character: she spoke with such unbounded freedom on\r\ncertain subjects, that I gave her credit for unbounded sincerity on all\r\nsubjects: she had the talent of making the world believe _that_ virtue\r\nto be invulnerable by nature which disdained the common outworks of art\r\nfor its defence. I, amongst others, took it for granted, that the woman\r\nwho could make it her sport to \'touch the brink of all we hate,\' must\r\nhave a stronger head than other people. I have since been convinced,\r\nhowever, of my mistake. I am persuaded that few can touch the brink\r\nwithout tumbling headlong down the precipice. Don\'t apply this, my\r\ndear, _literally_, to the person of whom we were speaking; I am not base\r\nenough to betray her secrets, however I may have been provoked by her\r\ntreachery. Of her character and history you shall hear nothing but what\r\nis necessary for my own justification. The league of amity between\r\nus was scarcely ratified before my Lord Delacour came, with his wise\r\nremonstrating face, to beg me \'to consider what was due to my own honour\r\nand his.\' Like the cosmogony-man in the Vicar of Wakefield, he came out\r\nover and over with this cant phrase, which had once stood him in stead.\r\n\'Do you think, my lord,\' said I, \'that because I gave up poor Lawless\r\nto oblige you, I shall give up all common sense to suit myself to your\r\ntaste? Harriot Freke is visited by every body but old dowagers and old\r\nmaids: I am neither an old dowager nor an old maid--the consequence is\r\nobvious, my lord.\' Pertness in dialogue, my dear, often succeeds better\r\nwith my lord than wit: I therefore saved the sterling gold, and bestowed\r\nupon him nothing but counters. I tell you this to save the credit of my\r\ntaste and judgment.\r\n\r\n"But to return to my friendship for Harriot Freke. I, of course,\r\nrepeated to her every word which had passed between my husband and me.\r\nShe out-heroded Herod upon the occasion; and laughed so much at what she\r\ncalled my folly in _pleading guilty_ in the Lawless cause, that I\r\nwas downright ashamed of myself, and, purely to prove my innocence, I\r\ndetermined, upon the first convenient opportunity, to renew my intimacy\r\nwith the colonel. The opportunity which I so ardently desired of\r\nredeeming my independence was not long wanting. Lawless, as my stars\r\n(which you know are always more in fault than ourselves) would have it,\r\nreturned just at this time from the continent, where he had been with\r\nhis regiment; he returned with a wound across his forehead and a black\r\nfillet, which made him look something more like a hero, and ten times\r\nmore like a coxcomb, than ever. He was in fashion, at all events; and\r\namongst other ladies, Mrs. Luttridge, odious Mrs. Luttridge! smiled\r\nupon him. The colonel, however, had taste enough to know the difference\r\nbetween smile and smile: he laid himself and his laurels at my feet, and\r\nI carried him and them about in triumph. Wherever I went, especially\r\nto Mrs. Luttridge\'s, envy and scandal joined hands to attack me, and I\r\nheard wondering and whispering wherever I went. I had no object in view\r\nbut to provoke my husband; therefore, conscious of the purity of my\r\nintentions, it was my delight to brave the opinion of the wondering\r\nworld. I gave myself no concern about the effect my coquetry might have\r\nupon the object of this flirtation. Poor Lawless! Heart, I took it for\r\ngranted, he had none; how should a coxcomb come by a heart? Vanity I\r\nknew he had in abundance, but this gave me no alarm, as I thought that\r\nif it should ever make him forget him self, I mean forget what was due\r\nto me, I could, by one flash of my wit, strike him to the earth,\r\nor blast him for ever. One night we had been together at Mrs.\r\nLuttridge\'s;--she, amongst other good things, kept a faro bank, and, I\r\nam convinced, cheated. Be that as it may, I lost an immensity of money,\r\nand it was my pride to lose with as much gaiety as any body else could\r\nwin; so I was, or appeared to be, in uncommonly high spirits, and\r\nLawless had his share of my good humour. We left Mrs. Luttridge\'s\r\ntogether early, about half-past one. As the colonel was going to hand me\r\nto my carriage, a smart-looking young man, as I thought, came up close\r\nto the coach door, and stared me full in the face: I was not a woman to\r\nbe disconcerted at such a thing as this, but I really was startled when\r\nthe young fellow jumped into the carriage after me: I thought he was\r\nmad: I had only courage enough to scream. Lawless seized hold of the\r\nintruder to drag him out, and out he dragged the youth, exclaiming, in a\r\nhigh tone, \'What is the meaning of all this, sir? Who the devil are\r\nyou? My name\'s Lawless: who the devil are you?\' The answer to this was a\r\nconvulsion of laughter. By the laugh I knew it to be Harriot Freke. \'Who\r\nam I? only a Freke!\' cried she: \'shake hands.\' I gave her my hand, into\r\nthe carriage she sprang, and desired the colonel to follow her: Lawless\r\nlaughed, we all laughed, and drove away. \'Where do you think I\'ve been?\'\r\nsaid Harriot; \'in the gallery of the House of Commons; almost squeezed\r\nto death these four hours; but I swore I\'d hear Sheridan\'s speech\r\nto-night, and I did; betted fifty guineas I would with Mrs. Luttridge,\r\nand have won. Fun and Freke for ever, huzza!\' Harriot was mad with\r\nspirits, and so noisy and unmanageable, that, as I told her, I was sure\r\nshe was drunk. Lawless, in his silly way, laughed incessantly, and I was\r\nso taken up with her oddities, that, for some time, I did not perceive\r\nwe were going the Lord knows where; till, at last, when the \'larum of\r\nHarriot\'s voice ceased for an instant, I was struck with the strange\r\nsound of the carriage. \'Where are we? not upon the stones, I\'m sure,\'\r\nsaid I; and putting my head out of the window, I saw we were beyond the\r\nturnpike. \'The coachman\'s drunk as well as you, Harriot,\' said I; and\r\nI was going to pull the string to stop him, but Harriot had hold of it.\r\n\'The man is going very right,\' said she; \'I\'ve told him where to go. Now\r\ndon\'t fancy that Lawless and I are going to run away with you. All this\r\nis unnecessary now-a-days, thank God!\' To this I agreed, and laughed for\r\nfear of being ridiculous. \'Guess where you are going,\' said Harriot, I\r\nguessed and guessed, but could not guess right; and my merry companions\r\nwere infinitely diverted with my perplexity and impatience, more\r\nespecially as, I believe, in spite of all my efforts, I grew rather\r\ngraver than usual. We went on to the end of Sloane-street, and quite\r\nout of town; at last we stopped. It was dark; the footman\'s flambeau was\r\nout; I could only just see by the lamps that we were at the door of\r\na lone, odd-looking house. The house door opened, and an old woman\r\nappeared with a lantern in her hand.\r\n\r\n"\'Where is this farce, or freak, or whatever you call it, to end?\' said\r\nI, as Harriot pulled me into the dark passage along with her.\r\n\r\n"Alas! my dear Belinda," said Lady Delacour, pausing, "I little foresaw\r\nwhere or how it was to end. But I am not come yet to the tragical part\r\nof my story, and as long as I can laugh I will. As the old woman and her\r\nmiserable light went on before us, I could almost have thought of Sir\r\nBertrand, or of some German _horrifications_; but I heard Lawless, who\r\nnever could help laughing at the wrong time, bursting behind me, with a\r\nsense of his own superiority.\r\n\r\n"\'Now you will learn your destiny, Lady Delacour!\' said Harriot, in a\r\nsolemn tone.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes! from the celebrated Mrs. W----, the modern dealer in art magic,\'\r\nsaid I, laughing, \'for, now I guess whereabouts I am. Colonel Lawless\'s\r\nlaugh broke the spell. Harriot Freke, never whilst you live expect to\r\nsucceed in _the sublime_.\' Harriot swore at the colonel for the veriest\r\n_spoil-sport_ she had ever seen, and she whispered to me--\'The reason he\r\nlaughs is because he is afraid of our suspecting the truth of him, that\r\nhe believes _tout de bon_ in conjuration, and the devil, and all that.\'\r\nThe old woman, whose cue I found was to be dumb, opened a door at the\r\ntop of a narrow staircase, and pointing to a tall figure, completely\r\nenveloped in fur, left us to our fate. I will not trouble you with\r\na pompous description of all the mummery of the scene, my dear, as I\r\ndespair of being able to frighten you out of your wits. I should have\r\nbeen downright angry with Harriot Freke for bringing me to such a place,\r\nbut that I knew women of the first fashion had been with Mrs. W----\r\nbefore us--some in sober sadness, some by way of frolic. So as there\r\nwas no fear of being ridiculous, there was no shame, you know, and my\r\nconscience was quite at ease. Harriot had no conscience, so she was\r\nalways at ease; and never more so than in male attire, which she had\r\nbeen told became her particularly. She supported the character of\r\na young rake with such spirit and _truth_, that I am sure no common\r\nconjuror could have discovered any thing feminine about her. She rattled\r\non with a set of nonsensical questions; and among other things she\r\nasked, \'How soon will Lady Delacour marry again after her lord\'s death?\'\r\n\r\n"\'She will never marry after her lord\'s death,\' answered the oracle.\r\n\'Then she will marry during his lifetime,\' said Harriot. \'True,\'\r\nanswered the oracle. Colonel Lawless laughed; I was angry; and the\r\ncolonel would have been quiet, for he was a gentleman, but there was no\r\nsuch thing as managing Mrs. Freke, who, though she had laid aside the\r\nmodesty of her own sex, had not acquired the decency of the other. \'Who\r\nis to be Lady Delacour\'s second husband?\' cried she; \'you\'ll not offend\r\nany of the present company by naming the man.\' \'Her second husband\r\nI cannot name,\' replied the oracle, \'but let her beware of a Lawless\r\nlover.\' Mrs. Freke and Colonel Lawless, encouraged by her, triumphed\r\nover me without mercy--I may say, without shame! Well, my dear, I am in\r\na hurry to have done with all this: though I \'_doted upon folly_,\' yet I\r\nwas terrified at the thoughts of any thing worse. The idea of a divorce,\r\nthe public brand of a shameful life, shocked me in spite of all my real\r\nand all my assumed levity. O that I had, at this instant, dared to\r\n_be myself_! But my fear of ridicule was greater than my fear of vice.\r\n\'Bless me, my dear Lady Delacour,\' whispered Harriot, as we left this\r\nhouse, \'what can make you in such a desperate hurry to get home? You\r\ngape and fidget: one would think you had never sat up a night before in\r\nyour life. I verily believe you are afraid to trust yourself with us.\r\nWhich of us are you afraid of, Lawless, or me, or _yourself_?\' There was\r\na tone of contempt in the last words which piqued me to the quick; and\r\nhowever strange it may seem, I was now anxious only to convince Harriot\r\nthat I was not afraid of myself. False shame made me act as if I had no\r\nshame. You would not suspect me of knowing any thing of false shame, but\r\ndepend upon it, my dear, many, who appear to have as much assurance as\r\nI have, are secretly its slaves. I moralize, because I am come to a part\r\nof my story which I should almost be glad to omit; but I promised you\r\nthat there should be no sins of omission. It was light, but not broad\r\ndaylight, when we got to Knightsbridge. Lawless, encouraged (for I\r\ncannot deny it) by the levity of my manner, as well as of Harriot\'s,\r\nwas in higher and more familiar spirits than I ever saw him. Mrs.\r\nFreke desired me to set her down at her sister\'s, who lived in\r\nGrosvenor-place: I did so, and I beg you to believe that I was in an\r\nagony, to get rid of my colonel at the same time; but you know I could\r\nnot, before Harriot Freke, absolutely say to him, \'Get out!\' Indeed, to\r\ntell things as they were, it was scarcely possible to guess by my manner\r\nthat I was under any anxiety, I acted my part so well, or so ill. As\r\nHarriot Freke jumped out of the coach, a cock crowed in the area of her\r\nsister\'s house: \'There!\' cried Harriot, \'do you hear the cock crow,\r\nLady Delacour? Now it\'s to be hoped your fear of goblins is over, else\r\nI would not be so cruel as to leave the pretty dear all alone.\' \'All\r\nalone!\' answered I: \'your friend the colonel is much obliged to you\r\nfor making nobody of him.\' \'My friend the colonel,\' whispered Harriot,\r\nleaning with her bold masculine arms on the coach door--\'my friend\r\nthe colonel is much obliged to me, I\'m sure, for remembering what the\r\ncunning or the knowing woman told us just now: so when I said I left\r\nyou alone, I was not guilty of a bull, was I?\' I had the grace to be\r\nheartily ashamed of this speech, and called out, in utter confusion, \'To\r\nBerkley-square. But where shall I set you down, colonel? Harriot, good\r\nmorning: don\'t forget you are in man\'s clothes.\' I did not dare to\r\nrepeat the question of \'where shall I set you down, colonel?\' at this\r\ninstant, because Harriot gave me such an arch, sneering look, as much as\r\nto say, \'Still afraid of yourself!\' We drove on: I\'m persuaded that the\r\nconfusion which, in spite of all my efforts, broke through my affected\r\nlevity, encouraged Lawless, who was naturally a coxcomb and a fool,\r\nto believe that I was actually his, else he never could have been so\r\ninsolent. In short, my dear, before we had got through the turnpike\r\ngate, I was downright obliged to say to him, \'Get out!\' which I did with\r\na degree of indignation that quite astonished him. He muttered something\r\nabout ladies knowing their minds; and I own, though I went off with\r\nflying colours, I secretly blamed myself as much as I did him, and I\r\nblamed Harriot more than I did either. I sent for her the next day, as\r\nsoon as I could, to consult her. She expressed such astonishment, and\r\nso much concern at this catastrophe of our night\'s frolic, and blamed\r\nherself with so many oaths, and execrated Lawless for a coxcomb, so much\r\nto the ease and satisfaction of my conscience, that I was confirmed\r\nin my good opinion of her, and indeed felt for her the most lively\r\naffection and esteem; for observe, with me esteem ever followed\r\naffection, instead of affection following esteem. Woe be to all who in\r\nmorals preposterously put the cart before the horse! But to proceed\r\nwith my history: all fashionable historians stop to make reflections,\r\nsupposing that no one else can have the sense to make any. My _esteemed_\r\nfriend agreed with me that it would be best for all parties concerned\r\nto hush up this business; that as Lawless was going out of town in a few\r\ndays, to be elected for a borough, we should get rid of him in the\r\nbest way possible, without \'more last words;\' that he had been punished\r\nsufficiently on the spot, and that to punish twice for the same offence,\r\nonce in private and once in public, would be contrary to the laws of\r\nEnglishmen and Englishwomen, and in my case would be contrary to the\r\nevident dictates of prudence, because I could not complain without\r\ncalling upon Lord Delacour to call Lawless out; this I could not do\r\nwithout acknowledging that his lordship had been in the right, in\r\nwarning me about his _honour and my own_, which old phrase I dreaded to\r\nhear for the ninety-ninth time: besides, Lord Delacour was the last man\r\nin the world I should have chosen for my knight, though unluckily he was\r\nmy lord; besides, all things considered, I thought the whole story might\r\nnot tell so well in the world for me, tell it which way I would: we\r\ntherefore agreed that it would be most expedient to hold our tongues. We\r\ntook it for granted that Lawless would hold his, and as for my people,\r\nthey knew nothing, I thought, or if they did, I was sure of them. How\r\nthe thing got abroad I could not at the time conceive, though now I am\r\nwell acquainted with the baseness and treachery of the woman I called my\r\nfriend. The affair was known and talked of every where the next day,\r\nand the story was told especially at odious Mrs. Luttridge\'s, with\r\nsuch exaggerations as drove me almost mad. I was enraged, inconceivably\r\nenraged with Lawless, from whom I imagined the reports originated.\r\n\r\n"I was venting my indignation against him in a room full of company,\r\nwhere I had just made my story good, when a gentleman, to whom I was\r\na stranger, came in breathless, with the news that Colonel Lawless was\r\nkilled in a duel by Lord Delacour; that they were carrying him home to\r\nhis mother\'s, and that the body was just going by the door. The company\r\nall crowded to the windows immediately, and I was left standing alone\r\ntill I could stand no longer. What was said or done after this I do\r\nnot remember; I only know that when I came to myself, the most dreadful\r\nsensation I ever experienced was the certainty that I had the blood of a\r\nfellow-creature to answer for.--I wonder," said Lady Delacour, breaking\r\noff at this part of her history, and rising suddenly, "I wonder what\r\nis become of Marriott!--surely it is time for me to have my drops.\r\nMiss Portman, have the goodness to ring, for I _must_ have something\r\nimmediately." Belinda was terrified at the wildness of her manner. Lady\r\nDelacour became more composed, or put more constraint upon herself, at\r\nthe sight of Marriott. Marriott brought from the closet in her lady\'s\r\nroom the drops, which Lady Delacour swallowed with precipitation. Then\r\nshe ordered coffee, and afterward chasse-cafe, and at last, turning to\r\nBelinda, with a forced smile, she said--\r\n\r\n"Now shall the Princess Scheherazade go on with her story?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nLADY DELACOUR\'S HISTORY CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I left off with the true skill of a good story-teller, at the most\r\ninteresting part--a duel; and yet duels are so common now that they are\r\nreally vulgar incidents.\r\n\r\n"But we think that a duel concerning ourselves must be more\r\nextraordinary than any other. We hear of men being shot in duels about\r\nnothing every day, so it is really a weakness in me to think so much\r\nabout poor Lawless\'s death, as Harriot Freke said to me at the time. She\r\nexpected to see me show sorrow in _public_; but very fortunately for\r\nme, she roused my pride, which was always stronger than my reason; and I\r\nbehaved myself upon the occasion as became a fine lady. There were some\r\nthings, however, I could hardly stand. You must know that Lawless, fool\r\nand coxcomb as he was, had some magnanimity, and showed it--as some\r\npeople do from whom it is least expected--on his death-bed. The last\r\nwords he said were, \'Lady Delacour is innocent--I charge you, don\'t\r\nprosecute Lord Delacour.\' This he said to his mother, who, to complete\r\nmy misery, is one of the most respectable women in England, and was\r\nmost desperately fond of Lawless, who was an only son. She never has\r\nrecovered his loss. Do you remember asking me who a tall elderly lady in\r\nmourning was, that you saw getting into her carriage one day, at South\r\nAudley-street chapel, as we passed by in our way to the park? That was\r\nLady Lawless: I believe I didn\'t answer you at the time. I meet her\r\nevery now and then--to me a spectre of dismay. But, as Harriot Freke\r\nsaid, certainly such a man as poor Lawless was a useless being in\r\nsociety, however he may be regretted by a doting mother. We should see\r\nthings in a philosophical light, if we can. I should not have suffered\r\nhalf as much as I did if he had been a man of a stronger understanding;\r\nbut he was a poor, vain, weak creature, that I actually drew on and\r\nduped with my own coquetry, whilst all the time I was endeavouring only\r\nto plague Lord Delacour. I was punished enough by the airs his\r\nlordship doubly gave himself, upon the strength of his valour and his\r\njudgment--they roused me completely; and I blamed him with all my might,\r\nand got an enormous party of my friends, I mean my acquaintance, to\r\nrun him down full cry, for having fought for me. It was absurd--it was\r\nrash--it was want of proper confidence in his wife; _thus we_ said. Lord\r\nDelacour had his partisans, it is true; amongst whom the loudest was\r\nodious Mrs. Luttridge. I embraced the first opportunity I met with of\r\nretaliation. You must know that Mrs. Luttridge, besides being a great\r\nfaro-player, was a great dabbler in politics; for she was almost as fond\r\nof power as of money: she talked loud and fluently, and had, somehow or\r\nother, partly by intriguing, partly by relationship, connected herself\r\nwith some of the leading men in parliament. There was to be a contested\r\nelection in our country: Mr. Luttridge had a good estate there next\r\nto Lord Delacour\'s, and being of an ancient family, and keeping a good\r\ntable, the Luttridges were popular enough. At the first news of an\r\nelection, out comes a flaming advertisement from Mr. Luttridge; away\r\nposted Mrs. Luttridge to begin her canvass, and away posted Lady\r\nDelacour after her, to canvass for a cousin of Harriot Freke. This was a\r\nnew scene for me; but I piqued myself on the versatility of my talents,\r\nand I laid myself out in please all the squires, and, what was more\r\ndifficult, all the squires\' ladies, in ----shire. I was ambitious to\r\nhave it said of me, \'that I was the finest figure that ever appeared\r\nupon a canvass.\' O, ye ----shireians, how hard did I work to obtain your\r\npraise! All that the combined force of vanity and hatred could inspire\r\nI performed, and with success. You have but little curiosity, I presume,\r\nto know how many hogsheads of port went down the throat of John Bull, or\r\nhow many hecatombs were offered up to the genius of English liberty. My\r\nhatred to Mrs. Luttridge was, of course, called love of my country. Lady\r\nDelacour was deified by all _true_ patriots; and, luckily, a handsome\r\nlegacy left me for my spirit, by an uncle who died six weeks before the\r\nelection, enabled us to sustain the expense of my apotheosis. The day of\r\nelection came; Harriot Freke and I made our appearance on the hustings,\r\ndressed in splendid party uniforms; and before us our knights and\r\nsquires held two enormous panniers full of ribands and cockades, which\r\nwe distributed with a grace that won all hearts, if not all votes. Mrs.\r\nLuttridge thought the panniers would carry the election; and forthwith\r\nshe sent off an express for a pair of panniers twice as large as ours. I\r\ntook out my pencil, and drew a caricature of _the ass and her panniers_;\r\nwrote an epigram at the bottom of it; and the epigram and the caricature\r\nwere soon in the hands of half ----shire. The verses were as bad as\r\nimpromptus usually are, and the drawing was not much better than\r\nthe writing; but the _good-will_ of the critics supplied all my\r\ndeficiencies; and never was more praise bestowed upon the pen of Burke,\r\nor the pencil of Reynolds, than was lavished upon me by my honest\r\nfriends. My dear Belinda, if you will not quarrel with the quality, you\r\nmay have what quantity of praise you please. Mrs. Luttridge, as I hoped\r\nand expected, was beyond measure enraged at the sight of the caricature\r\nand epigram. She was, besides being a gamester and a politician--what do\r\nyou think?--an excellent shot! She wished, she said, to be a man, that\r\nshe might be qualified to take proper notice of my conduct. The same\r\nkind friends who showed her my epigram repeated to me her observation\r\nupon it. Harriot Freke was at my elbow, and offered to take any\r\n_message_ I might think proper to Mrs. Luttridge. I scarcely thought her\r\nin earnest till she added, that the only way left now-a-days for a woman\r\nto distinguish herself was by spirit; as every thing else was grown\r\n\'cheap and vulgar in the eyes of men;\' that she knew one of the\r\ncleverest young men in England, and a man of fashion into the bargain,\r\nwho was just going to publish a treatise \'upon the Propriety and\r\nNecessity of Female Duelling;\' and that he had demonstrated, beyond\r\na possibility of doubt, that civilized society could not exist half\r\na century longer without this necessary improvement. I had prodigious\r\ndeference for the masculine superiority, as I thought it, of Harriot\'s\r\nunderstanding. She was a philosopher, and a fine lady--I was only a fine\r\nlady; I had never fired a pistol in my life, and I was a little inclined\r\nto cowardice; but Harriot offered to bet any wager upon the steadiness\r\nof my hand, and assured me that I should charm all beholders in male\r\nattire. In short, as my second, if I would furnish her with proper\r\ncredentials, she swore she would undertake to furnish me with clothes,\r\nand pistols, and courage, and every thing I wanted. I sat down to pen\r\nmy challenge. When I was writing it, my hand did not tremble _much_--not\r\nmore than my Lord Delacour\'s always does. The challenge was very\r\nprettily worded: I believe I can repeat it.\r\n\r\n"\'Lady Delacour presents her compliments to Mrs. Luttridge--she is\r\ninformed that Mrs. L---- wishes she were a man, that she might be\r\nqualified to take _proper_ notice of Lady D----\'s conduct. Lady Delacour\r\nbegs leave to assure Mrs. Luttridge, that though she has the misfortune\r\nto be a woman, she is willing to account for her conduct in any manner\r\nMrs. L---- may think proper, and at any hour and place she may appoint.\r\nLady D---- leaves the choice of the weapons to Mrs. L----. Mrs. H.\r\nFreke, who has the honour of presenting this note, is Lady Delacour\'s\r\n_friend_ upon this occasion.\'\r\n\r\n"I cannot repeat Mrs. Luttridge\'s answer; all I know is, it was not half\r\nas neatly worded as my note; but the essential part of it was, that she\r\naccepted my challenge _with pleasure_, and should do herself the honour\r\nof meeting me at six o\'clock the next morning; that Miss Honour O\'Grady\r\nwould be her _friend_ upon the occasion; and that pistols were the\r\nweapons she preferred. The place of appointment was behind an old barn,\r\nabout two miles from the town of ----. The hour was fixed to be early in\r\nthe morning, to prevent all probability of interruption. In the evening,\r\nHarriot and I rode to the ground. There were several bullets sticking in\r\nthe posts of the barn: this was the place where Mrs. Luttridge had been\r\naccustomed to exercise herself in firing at a mark. I own my courage\r\n\'oozed out\' a little at this sight. The Duke de la Rochefoucault, I\r\nbelieve, said truly, that \'many would be cowards if they dared.\' There\r\nseemed to me to be no physical and less moral necessity for my fighting\r\nthis duel; but I did not venture to reason on a point of honour with\r\nmy spirited second. I bravadoed to Harriot most magnanimously; but at\r\nnight, when Marriott was undressing me, I could not forbear giving her\r\na hint, which I thought might tend to preserve the king\'s peace, and\r\nthe peace of the county. I went to the ground in the morning in good\r\nspirits, and with a safe conscience. Harriot was in admiration of my\r\n\'lion-port;\' and, to do her justice, she conducted herself with great\r\ncoolness upon the occasion; but then it may be observed, that it was I\r\nwho was to stand fire, and not she. I thought of poor Lawless a billion\r\nof times, at least, as we were going to the ground; and I had my\r\npresentiments, and my confused notions of poetic justice: but poetic\r\njustice, and all other sorts of justice, went clear out of my head, when\r\nI saw my antagonist and her friend, actually pistol in hand, waiting for\r\nus; they were both in men\'s clothes. I secretly called upon the name of\r\nMarriott with fervency, and I looked round with more anxiety than ever\r\nBluebeard\'s wife, or \'Anne, sister Anne!\' looked to see if any body\r\nwas coming: nothing was to be seen but the grass blown by the wind--no\r\nMarriott to throw herself _toute eploree_ between the combatants--no\r\npeace-officers to bind us over to our good behaviour--no deliverance at\r\nhand; and Mrs. Luttridge, by all the laws of honour, as challenged, was\r\nto have the first shot. Oh, those laws of honour! I was upon the point\r\nof making an apology, in spite of them all, when, to my inexpressible\r\njoy, I was relieved from the dreadful alternative of being shot through\r\nthe head, or of becoming a laughing-stock for life, by an incident, less\r\nheroic, I\'ll grant you, than opportune. But you shall have the whole\r\nscene, as well as I can recollect it; _as well_--for those who for the\r\nfirst time go into a field of battle do not, as I am credibly informed\r\nand internally persuaded, always find the clearness of their memories\r\nimproved by the novelty of their situation. Mrs. Luttridge, when we came\r\nup, was leaning, with a truly martial negligence, against the wall of\r\nthe barn, with her pistol, as I told you, in her hand. She spoke not\r\na word; but her second, Miss Honour O\'Grady, advanced towards us\r\nimmediately, and, taking off her hat very manfully, addressed herself\r\nto my second--\'Mistress Harriot Freke, I presume, if I mistake not.\'\r\nHarriot bowed slightly, and answered, \'Miss Honour O\'Grady, I presume,\r\nif I mistake not.\' \'The same, at your service,\' replied Miss Honour.\r\n\'I have a few words to suggest that may save a great deal of noise, and\r\nbloodshed, and ill-will.\' \'As to noise,\' said Harriot, \'it is a thing in\r\nwhich I delight, therefore I beg that mayn\'t be spared on my account; as\r\nto bloodshed, I beg that may not be spared on Lady Delacour\'s account,\r\nfor her honour, I am sure, is dearer to her than her blood; and, as to\r\nill-will, I should be concerned to have that saved on Mrs. Luttridge\'s\r\naccount, as we all know it is a thing in which she delights, even more\r\nthan I do in noise, or Lady Delacour in blood: but pray proceed,\r\nMiss Honour O\'Grady; you have a few words to suggest.\' \'Yes, I would\r\nwillingly observe, as it is my duty to my _principal_,\' said Honour,\r\n\'that one who is compelled to fire her pistol with her left hand, though\r\never so good a shot _naturally_, is by no means on a footing with one\r\nwho has the advantage of her right hand.\' Harriot rubbed my pistol with\r\nthe sleeve of her coat, and I, recovering my wit with my hopes of being\r\nwitty with impunity, answered, \'Unquestionably, left-handed wisdom and\r\nleft-handed courage are neither of them the very best of their kinds;\r\nbut we must content ourselves with them _if_ we can have no other.\'\r\n\'That _if_,\' cried Honour O\'Grady, \'is not, like most of the family of\r\nthe _ifs_, a peace-maker. My Lady Delacour, I was going to observe that\r\nmy principal has met with an unfortunate accident, in the shape of a\r\nwhitlow on the fore-finger of her right hand, which incapacitates her\r\nfrom drawing a trigger; but I am at your service, ladies, either of\r\nyou, that can\'t put up with a disappointment with good humour.\' I never,\r\nduring the whole course of my existence, was more disposed to bear\r\na disappointment with good humour, to prove that I was incapable of\r\nbearing malice; and to oblige the seconds, for form\'s sake, I agreed\r\nthat we should take our ground, and fire our pistols into the air. Mrs.\r\nLuttridge, with her left-handed wisdom, fired first; and I, with great\r\nmagnanimity, followed her example. I must do my adversary\'s second, Miss\r\nHonour O\'Grady, the justice to observe, that in this whole affair she\r\nconducted herself not only with the spirit, but with the good-nature\r\nand generosity characteristic of her nation. We met enemies, and parted\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n"Life is a tragicomedy! Though the critics will allow of no such thing\r\nin their books, it is a true representation of what passes in the\r\nworld; and of all lives mine has been the most grotesque mixture, or\r\nalternation, I should say, of tragedy and comedy. All this is apropos to\r\nsomething I have not told you yet. This comic duel ended tragically\r\nfor me. \'How?\' you say. Why, \'tis clear that I was not shot through the\r\nhead; but it would have been better, a hundred times better for me, if\r\nI had; I should have been spared, in this life at least, the torments\r\nof the damned. I was not used to priming and loading: my pistol was\r\novercharged: when I fired, it recoiled, and I received a blow on my\r\nbreast, the consequences of which you have seen.\r\n\r\n"The pain was nothing at the moment compared with what I have since\r\nexperienced: but I will not complain till I cannot avoid it. I had not,\r\nat the time I received the blow, much leisure for lamentation; for I had\r\nscarcely discharged my pistol when we heard a loud shout on the other\r\nside of the barn, and a crowd of town\'s people, country people, and\r\nhaymakers, came pouring down the lane towards us, with rakes and\r\npitchforks in their hands. An English mob is really a formidable thing.\r\nMarriott had mismanaged her business most strangely: she had, indeed,\r\nspread a report of a duel--a female duel; but the untutored sense of\r\npropriety amongst these rustics was so shocked at the idea of a duel\r\nfought by women in _men\'s clothes_, that I verily believe they would\r\nhave thrown us into the river with all their hearts. Stupid blockheads!\r\nI am convinced that they would not have been half so much scandalized\r\nif we had boxed in petticoats. The want of these petticoats had nearly\r\nproved our destruction, or at least our disgrace: a peeress after being\r\nducked, could never have held her head above water again with any grace.\r\nThe mob had just closed round us, crying, \'Shame! shame! shame!--duck\r\n\'em--duck \'em--gentle or simple--duck \'em--duck \'em\'--when their\r\nattention was suddenly turned towards a person who was driving up the\r\nlane a large herd of squeaking, grunting pigs. The person was clad in\r\nsplendid regimentals, and he was armed with a long pole, to the end\r\nof which hung a bladder, and his pigs were frightened, and they ran\r\nsqueaking from one side of the road to the other; and the pig-driver\r\nin regimentals, in the midst of the noise, could not without difficulty\r\nmake his voice heard; but at last he was understood to say, that a bet\r\nof a hundred guineas depended upon his being able to keep these pigs\r\nahead of a flock of turkeys that were following them; and he begged the\r\nmob to give him and his pigs fair play. At the news of this wager,\r\nand at the sight of the gentleman turned pig-driver, the mob were in\r\nraptures; and at the sound of his voice, Harriot Freke immediately\r\nexclaimed, \'Clarence Hervey! by all that\'s lucky!\'"\r\n\r\n"Clarence Hervey!" interrupted Belinda. "Clarence Hervey, my dear,"\r\nsaid Lady Delacour, coolly: "he can do every thing, you know, even drive\r\npigs, better than any body else!--but let me go on.\r\n\r\n"Harriot Freke shouted in a stentorian voice, which actually made your\r\npig-driver start: she explained to him in French our distress, and the\r\ncause of it, Clarence was, as I suppose you have discovered long ago,\r\n\'that cleverest young man in England who had written on the propriety\r\nand necessity of female duelling.\' He answered Harriot in French--\'To\r\nattempt your rescue by force would be vain; but I will do better, I\r\nwill make a diversion in your favour.\' Immediately our hero, addressing\r\nhimself to the sturdy fellow who held me in custody, exclaimed, \'Huzza,\r\nmy boys! Old England for ever! Yonder comes a Frenchman with a flock of\r\nturkeys. My pigs will beat them, for a hundred guineas. Old England for\r\never, huzza!\'\r\n\r\n"As he spoke, the French officer, with whom Clarence Hervey had laid the\r\nwager, appeared at the turn of the lane--his turkeys half flying--half\r\nhobbling up the road before him. The Frenchman waved a red streamer over\r\nthe heads of his flock--Clarence shook a pole, from the top of which\r\nhung a bladder full of beans. The pigs grunted, the turkeys gobbled,\r\nand the mob shouted: eager for the fame of Old England, the crowd\r\nfollowed Clarence with loud acclamations. The French officer was\r\nfollowed with groans and hisses. So great was the confusion, and so\r\ngreat the zeal of the patriots, that even the pleasure of ducking the\r\nfemale duellists was forgotten in the general enthusiasm. All eyes and\r\nall hearts were intent upon the race; and now the turkeys got foremost,\r\nand now the pigs. But when we came within sight of the horsepond, I\r\nheard one man cry, \'Don\'t forget the ducking.\' How I trembled! but our\r\nknight shouted to his followers--\'For the love of Old England, my brave\r\nboys, keep between my pigs and the pond:--if our pigs see the water,\r\nthey\'ll run to it, and England\'s undone.\'\r\n\r\n"The whole fury of the mob was by this speech conducted away from us.\r\n\'On, on, my boys, into town, to the market-place: whoever gains the\r\nmarket-place first wins the day.\' Our general shook the rattling bladder\r\nin triumph over the heads of \'the swinish multitude,\' and we followed in\r\nperfect security in his train into the town.\r\n\r\n"Men, women, and children, crowded to the windows and doors. \'Retreat\r\ninto the first place you can,\' whispered Clarence to us: we were close\r\nto him. Harriot Freke pushed her way into a milliner\'s shop: I could not\r\nget in after her, for a frightened pig turned back suddenly, and almost\r\nthrew me down. Clarence Hervey caught me, and favoured my retreat into\r\nthe shop. But poor Clarence lost his bet by his gallantry. Whilst he\r\nwas manoeuvring in my favour, the turkeys got several yards ahead of the\r\npigs, and reaching the market-place first, won the race.\r\n\r\n"The French officer found great difficulty in getting safe out of the\r\ntown; but Clarence represented to the mob that he was a prisoner on his\r\nparole, and that it would be unlike Englishmen to insult a prisoner. So\r\nhe got off without being pelted, and they both returned in safety to\r\nthe house of General Y----, where they were to dine, and where\r\nthey entertained a large party of officers with the account of this\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Freke and I rejoiced in our escape, and we thought that the whole\r\nbusiness was now over; but in this we were mistaken. The news of our\r\nduel, which had spread in the town, raised such an uproar as had never\r\nbeen heard, even at the noisiest election. Would you believe it?--The\r\nfate of the election turned upon this duel. The common people, one and\r\nall, declared that they would not vote either for Mr. Luttridge or Mr.\r\nFreke, because _as how_--but I need not repeat all the _platitudes_\r\nthat they said. In short, neither ribands nor brandy could bring them\r\nto reason. With true English pig-headedness, they went every man of them\r\nand polled for an independent candidate of their own choosing, whose\r\nwife, forsooth, was a proper behaved woman.\r\n\r\n"The only thing I had to console me for all this was Clarence Hervey\'s\r\nopinion that I looked better in man\'s clothes than my friend Harriot\r\nFreke. Clarence was charmed with my spirit and grace; but he had not\r\nleisure at that time to attach himself seriously to me, or to any thing.\r\nHe was then about nineteen or twenty: he was all vivacity, presumption,\r\nand paradox; he was enthusiastic in support of his opinions; but he was\r\nat the same time the most candid man in the world, for there was no set\r\nof tenets which could be called exclusively his: he adopted in liberal\r\nrotation every possible absurdity; and, to do him justice, defended each\r\nin its turn with the most ingenious arguments that could be devised, and\r\nwith a flow of words which charmed the ear, if not the sense. His essay\r\non female duelling was a most extraordinary performance; it was handed\r\nabout in manuscript till it was worn out; he talked of publishing it,\r\nand dedicating it to me. However, this scheme, amongst a million of\r\nothers, he _talked of_, but never put into execution. Luckily for him,\r\nmany of his follies evaporated in words. I saw but little either of him\r\nor his follies at this time. All I know about him is, that after he\r\nhad lost his bet of a hundred guineas, as a pig-driver, by his\r\nknight-errantry in rescuing the female duellists from a mob, he wrote a\r\nvery charming copy of verses upon the occasion; and that he was so much\r\nprovoked by the stupidity of some of his brother officers who could not\r\nunderstand the verses, that he took a disgust to the army, and sold his\r\ncommission. He set out upon a tour to the continent, and I returned with\r\nHarriot Freke to London, and forgot the existence of such a person as\r\nClarence Hervey for three or four years. Unless people can be of some\r\nuse, or unless they are actually present, let them be ever so agreeable\r\nor meritorious, we are very apt to forget them. One grows strangely\r\nselfish by living in the world: \'tis a perfect cure for romantic notions\r\nof gratitude, and love, and so forth. If I had lived in the country\r\nin an old manor-house, Clarence Hervey would have doubtless reigned\r\nparamount in my imagination as the deliverer of my life, &c. But in\r\nLondon one has no time for thinking of deliverers. And yet what I did\r\nwith my time I cannot tell you: \'tis gone, and no trace left. One day\r\nafter another went I know not how. Had I wept for every day I lost, I\'m\r\nsure I should have cried my eyes out before this time. If I had enjoyed\r\nany amusement in the midst of this dissipation, it would all have been\r\nvery well; but I declare to you in confidence I have been tired to\r\ndeath. Nothing can be more monotonous than the life of a hackneyed fine\r\nlady;--I question whether a dray-horse, or--a horse in a mill, would\r\nwillingly exchange places with one, if they could know as much of the\r\nmatter as I do. You are surprised at hearing all this from me. My dear\r\nBelinda, how I envy you! You are not yet tired of every thing. _The\r\nworld_ has still the gloss of novelty for you; but don\'t expect that can\r\nlast above a season. My first winter was certainly entertaining enough.\r\nOne begins with being charmed with the bustle and glare, and what the\r\nFrench call _spectacle_; this is over, I think, in six months. I can but\r\njust recollect having been amused at the Theatres, and the Opera, and\r\nthe Pantheon, and Ranelagh, and all those places, for their own sakes.\r\nSoon, very soon, we go out to see people, not things: then we grow tired\r\nof seeing people; then we grow tired of being seen by people; and then\r\nwe go out merely because we can\'t stay at home. A dismal story, and\r\na true one. Excuse me for showing you the simple truth; well-dressed\r\nfalsehood is a personage much more _presentable_. I am now come to an\r\nepoch in my history in which there is a dearth of extraordinary events.\r\nWhat shall I do? Shall I invent? I would if I could; but I cannot. Then\r\nI must confess to you that during these last four years I should\r\nhave died of ennui if I had not been kept alive by my hatred of Mrs.\r\nLuttridge and of my husband. I don\'t know which I hate most--O, yes,\r\nI do--I certainly hate Mrs. Luttridge the most; for a woman can always\r\nhate a woman more than she can hate a man, unless she has been in love\r\nwith him, which I never was with poor Lord Delacour. Yes! I certainly\r\nhate Mrs. Luttridge the most; I cannot count the number of extravagant\r\nthings I have done on purpose to eclipse her. We have had rival routs,\r\nrival concerts, rival galas, rival theatres: she has cost me more than\r\n_she\'s_ worth; but then I certainly have mortified her once a month at\r\nleast. My hatred to Mrs. Luttridge, my dear, is the remote cause of\r\nmy love for you; for it was the cause of my intimacy with your aunt\r\nStanhope.--Mrs. Stanhope is really a clever woman--she knows how to turn\r\nthe hatred of all her friends and acquaintance to her own advantage.--To\r\nserve lovers is a thankless office compared with that of serving\r\n_haters_--polite haters I mean. It may be dangerous, for aught I know,\r\nto interpose in the quarrels of those who hate their neighbours, not\r\nonly with all their souls, but with all their strength--the barbarians\r\nfight it out, kiss, and are friends. The quarrels which never come to\r\nblows are safer for a go-between; but even these are not to be compared\r\nto such as never come to words: your true silent hatred is that which\r\nlasts for ever. The moment it was known that Mrs. Luttridge and I had\r\ncome to the resolution never to speak to one another, your aunt\r\nStanhope began to minister to my hatred so, that she made herself quite\r\nagreeable. She one winter gave me notice that my adversary had set her\r\nheart upon having a magnificent entertainment on a particular day. On\r\nthat day I determined, of course, to have a rival gala. Mrs. Stanhope\'s\r\nmaid had a lover, a gardener, who lived at Chelsea; and the gardener\r\nhad an aloe, which was expected soon to blow. Now a plant that blows but\r\nonce in a hundred years is worth having. The gardener intended to make\r\na public exhibition of it, by which he expected to gain about a hundred\r\nguineas. Your aunt Stanhope\'s maid got it from him for me for fifty; and\r\nI had it whispered about that an aloe in full blow would stand in the\r\nmiddle of one of Lady Delacour\'s supper tables. The difficulty was to\r\nmake Mrs. Luttridge fix upon the very day we wanted; for you know we\r\ncould not possibly put off the blowing of our aloe. Your aunt Stanhope\r\nmanaged the thing admirably by means of a _common friend_, who was not\r\na suspected person with the Luttridges; in short, my dear, I gained my\r\npoint--every body came from Mrs. Luttridge\'s to me, or to my aloe. She\r\nhad a prodigiously fine supper, but scarcely a soul stayed with her;\r\nthey all came to see what could be seen but once in a hundred years. Now\r\nthe aloe, you know, is of a cumbersome height for a supper ornament. My\r\nsaloon luckily has a dome, and under the dome we placed it. Round the\r\nhuge china vase in which it was planted we placed the most beautiful, or\r\nrather the most expensive hothouse plants we could procure. After all,\r\nthe aloe was an ugly thing; but it answered my purpose--it made Mrs.\r\nLuttridge, as I am credibly informed, absolutely weep with vexation. I\r\nwas excessively obliged to your aunt Stanhope; and I assured her that if\r\never it were in my power, she might depend upon my gratitude. Pray, when\r\nyou write, repeat the same thing to her, and tell her that since she has\r\nintroduced Belinda Portman to me, I am a hundred times more obliged to\r\nher than ever I was before.\r\n\r\n"But to proceed with my important history.--I will not tire you with\r\nfighting over again all my battles in my seven years\' war with Mrs.\r\nLuttridge. I believe love is more to your taste than hatred; therefore\r\nI will go on as fast as possible to Clarence Hervey\'s return from his\r\ntravels. He was much improved by them, or at least I thought so; for he\r\nwas heard to declare, that after all he had seen in France and Italy,\r\nLady Delacour appeared to him the most charming woman, _of her age_,\r\nin Europe. The words, _of her age_, piqued me; and I spared no pains to\r\nmake him forget them. A stupid man cannot readily be persuaded out of\r\nhis senses--what he sees he sees, and neither more nor less; but \'tis\r\nthe easiest thing in the world to catch hold of a man of genius: you\r\nhave nothing to do but to appeal from his senses to his imagination, and\r\nthen he sees with the eyes of his imagination, and hears with the ears\r\nof his imagination; and then no matter what the age, beauty, or wit of\r\nthe charmer may be--no matter whether it be Lady Delacour or Belinda\r\nPortman. I think I know Clarence Hervey\'s character _au fin fond_, and I\r\ncould lead him where I pleased: but don\'t be alarmed, my dear; you know\r\nI can\'t lead him into matrimony. You look at me, and from me, and you\r\ndon\'t well know which way to look. You are surprised, perhaps, after\r\nall that passed, all that I felt, and all that I still feel about poor\r\nLawless, I should not be cured of coquetry. So am I surprised; but\r\nhabit, fashion, the devil, I believe, lead us on: and then, Lord\r\nDelacour is so obstinate and jealous--you can\'t have forgotten the\r\n_polite conversation_ that passed one morning at breakfast between his\r\nlordship and me about Clarence Hervey; but neither does his lordship\r\nknow, nor does Clarence Hervey suspect, that my object with him is to\r\nconceal from the world what I cannot conceal from myself--that I am a\r\ndying woman. I am, and I see you think me, a strange, weak, inconsistent\r\ncreature. I was intended for something better, but now it is too late;\r\na coquette I have lived, and a coquette I shall die: I speak frankly to\r\nyou. Let me have the glory of leading Clarence Hervey about with me in\r\npublic for a few months longer, then I must quit the stage. As to love,\r\nyou know with me that is out of the question; all I ask or wish for is\r\nadmiration."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour paused, and leaned back on the sofa; she appeared in great\r\npain.\r\n\r\n"Oh!--I am sometimes," resumed she, "as you see, in terrible pain. For\r\ntwo years after I gave myself that blow with the pistol, I neglected the\r\nwarning twinges that I felt from time to time; at last I was terrified.\r\nMarriott was the only person to whom I mentioned my fears, and she was\r\nprofoundly ignorant: she flattered me with false hopes, till, alas! it\r\nwas in vain to doubt of the nature of my complaint: then she urged me\r\nto consult a physician; that I would not do--I could not--I never will\r\nconsult a physician,--I would not for the universe have my situation\r\nknown. You stare--you cannot enter into my feelings. Why, my dear, if\r\nI lose admiration, what have I left? Would you have me live upon pity?\r\nConsider what a dreadful thing it must be to me, who have no friends, no\r\nfamily, to be confined to a sick room--a sick bed; \'tis what I must come\r\nto at last, but not yet--not yet. I have fortitude; I should despise\r\nmyself if I had no species of merit: besides, it is still some\r\noccupation to me to act my part in public; and bustle, noise, nonsense,\r\nif they do not amuse or interest me, yet they stifle reflection. May\r\nyou never know what it is to feel remorse! The idea of that poor wretch,\r\nLawless, whom I actually murdered as much as if I had shot him, haunts\r\nme whenever I am alone. It is now between eight and nine years since he\r\ndied, and I have lived ever since in a constant course of dissipation;\r\nbut it won\'t do--conscience, conscience will be heard! Since my health\r\nhas been weakened, I believe I have acquired more conscience. I really\r\nthink that my stupid lord, who has neither ideas nor sensations, except\r\nwhen he is intoxicated, is a hundred times happier than I am. But I will\r\nspare you, Belinda; I promised that you should not have a _scene_, and I\r\nwill keep my word. It is, however, a great relief to open my mind to one\r\nwho has some feeling: Harriot Freke has none; I am convinced that she\r\nhas no more feeling than this table. I have not yet told you how she has\r\nused me. You know that it was she who led or rather dragged me into that\r\nscrape with Lawless; for that I never reproached her. You know it was\r\nshe who frightened me into fighting that duel with Mrs. Luttridge;\r\nfor this I never reproached her. She has cost me my peace of mind, my\r\nhealth, my life; she knows it, and she forsakes, betrays, insults, and\r\nleaves me to die. I cannot command my temper sufficiently to be coherent\r\nwhen I speak of her; I cannot express in words what I feel. How could\r\nthat most treacherous of beings, for ten years, make me believe that she\r\nwas my friend? Whilst I thought she really loved me, I pardoned her all\r\nher faults--_all_--what a comprehensive word!--All, all I forgave; and\r\ncontinually said--\'_but_ she has a good heart.\' A good heart!--she has\r\nno heart!--she has no feeling for any living creature but herself. I\r\nalways thought that she cared for no one but for me; but now I find\r\nshe can throw me off as easily as she would her glove. And this, too, I\r\nsuppose she calls a frolic; or, in her own vulgar language, fun. Can you\r\nbelieve it?--What do you think she has done, my dear? She has gone over\r\nat last to odious Mrs. Luttridge-actually she has gone down with the\r\nLuttridges to----shire. The independent member having taken the Chiltern\r\nHundreds, vacates his seat: a new election comes on directly: the\r\nLuttridges are to bring in Freke--not Harriot\'s cousin--they have cut\r\nhim,--but her husband, who is now to commence senator: he is to come\r\nin for the county, upon condition that Luttridge shall have Freke\'s\r\nborough. Lord Delacour, without saying one syllable, has promised his\r\ninterest to this precious junto, and Lady Delacour is left a miserable\r\ncipher. My lord\'s motives I can clearly understand: he lost a thousand\r\nguineas to Mrs. Luttridge this winter, and this is a convenient way of\r\npaying her. Why Harriot should be so anxious to serve a husband whom\r\nshe hates, bitterly hates, might surprise any body who did not know\r\n_les dessous des cartes_ as well as I do. You are but just come into the\r\nworld, Belinda--the world of wickedness, I mean, my dear, or you would\r\nhave heard what a piece of work there was a few years ago about Harriot\r\nFreke and this cousin of hers. Without betraying her confidence, I may\r\njust tell you what is known to every body, that she went so far, that if\r\nit had not been for me, not a soul would have visited her: she swam in\r\nthe sea of folly out of her depth--the tide of fashion ebbed, and there\r\nwas she left sticking knee deep in the mud--a ridiculous, scandalous\r\nfigure. I had the courage and foolish good-nature to hazard myself for\r\nher, and actually dragged her to terra firma:--how she has gone on\r\nsince I _cannot_ tell you precisely, because I am in the secret; but the\r\ncatastrophe is public: to make her peace with her husband, she gives\r\nup her friend. Well, that I could have pardoned, if she had not been so\r\nbase as to go over to Mrs. Luttridge. Mrs. Luttridge offered (I\'ve seen\r\nthe letter, and Harriot\'s answer) to bring in Freke, the husband, and\r\nto make both a county and a _family_ peace, on condition that Harriot\r\nshould give up all connexion with Lady Delacour. Mrs. Luttridge knew\r\nthis would provoke me beyond measure, and there is nothing she would not\r\ndo to gratify her mean, malevolent passions. She has succeeded for once\r\nin her life. The blame of the duel, of course, is all thrown upon me.\r\nAnd (would you believe it?) Harriot Freke, I am credibly informed,\r\nthrows all the blame of Lawless\'s business on me; nay, hints that\r\nLawless\'s deathbed declaration of my innocence was _very generous_. Oh,\r\nthe treachery, the baseness of this woman! And it was my fate to hear\r\nall this last night at the masquerade. I waited, and waited, and looked\r\nevery where for Harriot--she was to be the widow Brady, I knew: at last\r\nthe widow Brady made her appearance, and I accosted her with all my\r\nusual familiarity. The widow was dumb. I insisted upon knowing the cause\r\nof this sudden loss of speech. The widow took me into another\r\napartment, unmasked, and there I beheld Mr. Freke, the husband. I was\r\nastonished--had no idea of the truth. \'Where is Harriot?\' I believe,\r\nwere the first words I said. \'Gone to the country.\' \'To the country!\'\r\n\'Yes; to----shire, with Mrs. Luttridge.\'--Mrs. Luttridge--odious Mrs.\r\nLuttridge! I could scarcely believe my senses. But Freke, who always\r\nhated me, believing that I led his wife, instead of her leading me into\r\nmischief, would have enjoyed my astonishment and my rage; so I concealed\r\nboth, with all possible presence of mind. He went on over-whelming me\r\nwith explanations and copies of letters; and declared it was at Mrs.\r\nFreke\'s request he did and said all this, and that he was to follow her\r\nearly the next morning to ----shire. I broke from him, simply wishing\r\nhim a good journey, and as much family peace as his patience merited. He\r\nknows that I know his wife\'s history, and though _she_ has no shame, he\r\nhas some. I had the _satisfaction_ to leave him blushing with anger, and\r\nI supported the character of the comic muse a full hour afterwards,\r\nto convince him that all their combined malice would fail to break\r\nmy spirit in public: what I suffer in private is known only to my own\r\nheart."\r\n\r\nAs she finished these words, Lady Delacour rose abruptly, and hummed a\r\nnew opera air. Then she retired to her boudoir, saying, with an air of\r\nlevity, to Belinda as she left the room,\r\n\r\n"Good bye, my dear Belinda; I leave you to ruminate sweet and bitter\r\nthoughts; to think of the last speech and confession of Lady Delacour,\r\nor what will interest you much more, the first speech and confession\r\nof--Clarence Hervey."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBIRTHDAY DRESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Delacour\'s history, and the manner in which it was related,\r\nexcited in Belinda\'s mind astonishment, pity, admiration, and contempt:\r\nastonishment at her inconsistency, pity for her misfortunes, admiration\r\nof her talents, and contempt for her conduct. To these emotions\r\nsucceeded the recollection of the promise which she had made, not to\r\nleave her in her last illness at the mercy of an insolent attendant.\r\nThis promise Belinda thought of with terror: she dreaded the sight of\r\nsufferings which she knew must end in death: she dreaded the sight of\r\nthat affected gaiety and of that real levity which so ill became the\r\ncondition of a dying woman. She trembled at the idea of being under the\r\nguidance of one who was so little able to conduct herself: and she could\r\nnot help blaming her aunt Stanhope severely for placing her in such a\r\nperilous situation. It was obvious that some of Lady Delacour\'s history\r\nmust have been known to Mrs. Stanhope; and Belinda, the more she\r\nreflected, was the more surprised at her aunt\'s having chosen such\r\na chaperon for a young woman just entering into the world. When the\r\nunderstanding is suddenly roused and forced to exert itself, what a\r\nmultitude of deductions it makes in a short time! Belinda saw things in\r\na new light; and for the first time in her life she reasoned for herself\r\nupon what she saw and felt. It is sometimes safer for young people to\r\nsee than to hear of certain characters. At a distance, Lady Delacour had\r\nappeared to Miss Portman the happiest person in the world; upon a nearer\r\nview, she discovered that her ladyship was one of the most miserable of\r\nhuman beings. To have married her niece to such a man as Lord Delacour,\r\nMrs. Stanhope would have thought the most fortunate thing imaginable;\r\nbut it was now obvious to Belinda, that neither the title of\r\nviscountess, nor the pleasure of spending three fortunes, could ensure\r\nfelicity. Lady Delacour confessed, that in the midst of the utmost\r\nluxury and dissipation she had been a constant prey to ennui; that\r\nthe want of domestic happiness could never be supplied by that public\r\nadmiration of which she was so ambitious; and that the immoderate\r\nindulgence of her vanity had led her, by inevitable steps, into follies\r\nand imprudences which had ruined her health, and destroyed her peace of\r\nmind. "If Lady Delacour, with all the advantages of wealth, rank, wit,\r\nand beauty, has not been able to make herself happy in this life of\r\nfashionable dissipation," said Belinda to herself, "why should I follow\r\nthe same course, and expect to be more fortunate?"\r\n\r\nIt is singular, that the very means which Mrs. Stanhope had taken to\r\nmake a fine lady of her niece tended to produce an effect diametrically\r\nopposite to what might have been expected. The result of Belinda\'s\r\nreflections upon Lady Delacour\'s history was a resolution to benefit by\r\nher bad example; but this resolution it was more easy to form than\r\nto keep. Her ladyship, where she wished to please or to govern, had\r\nfascinating manners, and could alternately use the sarcastic powers of\r\nwit, and the fond tone of persuasion, to accomplish her purposes. It was\r\nBelinda\'s intention, in pursuance of her new plans of life, to spend,\r\nwhilst she remained in London, as little money as possible upon\r\nsuperfluities and dress. She had, at her own disposal, only 100l. per\r\nannum, the interest of her fortune; but besides this, her aunt, who was\r\ndesirous that she should go to court, and make a splendid figure there,\r\nhad sent her a draught on her banker for two hundred guineas. "You will,\r\nI trust," said her aunt, at the conclusion of the letter, "repay me when\r\nyou are established in the world; as I hope and believe, from what I\r\nhear from Lady Delacour of the power of your charms, you will soon be,\r\nto the entire satisfaction of all your friends. Pray do not neglect to\r\nmention my friend Clarence Hervey particularly when you write next.\r\nI understand from one who is well acquainted with him, and who has\r\nactually seen his rent-roll, that he has a clear 10,000l. a year."\r\n\r\nBelinda resolved neither to go to court, nor to touch her aunt\'s two\r\nhundred guineas; and she wrote a long letter to her, in which she\r\nexplained her feelings and views at large. In this letter she meant\r\nto have returned Mrs. Stanhope\'s draught, but her feelings and views\r\nchanged between the writing of this epistle and the going out of the\r\npost. Mrs. Franks, the milliner, came in the interim, and brought home\r\nLady Delacour\'s beautiful dress: it was not the sight of this, however,\r\nwhich changed Belinda\'s mind; but she could not resist Lady Delacour\'s\r\nraillery.\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear," said her ladyship, after having listened to all Miss\r\nPortman could say about her love of independence, and the necessity\r\nof economy to preserve that independence, "all this is prodigiously\r\nfine--but shall I translate it into plain English? You were mortally\r\nwounded the other night by some random reflections of a set of foolish\r\nyoung men--Clarence Hervey amongst the number; and instead of punishing\r\nthem, you sagely and generously determined to punish yourself. Then, to\r\nconvince this youth that you have not a thought of those odious nets and\r\ncages, that you have no design whatever upon his heart, and that he has\r\nno manner of influence on yours, you very judiciously determine, at\r\nthe first hint from him, to change your dress, your manners, and your\r\ncharacter, and thus to say to him, in as plain terms as possible--\'You\r\nsee, sir, a word to the wise is enough; I understand you disapprove of\r\nshowy dress and coquetry, and therefore, as I dressed and coquetted only\r\nto please you, now I shall lay aside dress and coquetry, since I\r\nfind that they are not to your taste--and I hope, sir, you like my\r\nsimplicity!\' Depend upon it, my dear, Clarence Hervey understands\r\nsimplicity as well as you or I do. All this would be vastly well, if he\r\ndid not know that you overheard that conversation; but as he does know\r\nit, trust me, he will attribute any sudden change in your manners and\r\nappearance, right or wrong, to the motives I have mentioned. So don\'t,\r\nnovice as you are! set about to manoeuvre for yourself. Leave all that\r\nto your aunt Stanhope, or to me, and then you know your conscience will\r\nbe all the time as white as your hands,--which, by-the-bye, Clarence\r\nHervey, the other day, said were the whitest hands he had ever seen.\r\nPerhaps all this time you have taken it into your head that full dress\r\nwill not become you; but I assure you that it will--you look well in any\r\nthing--\r\n\r\n   \'But from the hoop\'s bewitching round,\r\n   The very shoe has power to wound.\'\r\n\r\nSo come down to Mrs. Franks, and order your birthnight dress like a\r\nreasonable creature."\r\n\r\nLike a reasonable creature, Miss Portman followed Lady Delacour, and\r\nbespoke, or rather let her ladyship bespeak for her, fifty guineas\'\r\nworth of elegance and fashion. "You must go to the drawing-room with me\r\nnext week, and be presented," said Lady Delacour, "and then, as it is\r\nthe first time, you must be elegantly dressed, and you must not wear\r\nthe same dress on the birthnight. So, Mrs. Franks, let this be finished\r\nfirst, as fast as you can, and by that time, perhaps, we shall think of\r\nsomething superlatively charming for the night of nights."\r\n\r\nMrs. Franks departed, and Belinda sighed. "A silver penny for your\r\nthoughts!" cried Lady Delacour. "You are thinking that you are like\r\nCamilla, and I like Mrs. Mitten. Novel reading.--as I dare say you have\r\nbeen told by your governess, as I was told by mine, and she by hers, I\r\nsuppose--novel reading for young ladies is the most dangerous----\r\n\r\n"Oh, Clarence Hervey, I protest!" cried Lady Delacour, as he at this\r\ninstant entered the room. "Do, pray, Clarence, help me out, for the sake\r\nof this young lady, with a moral sentence against novel reading: but\r\nthat might go against your conscience, or your interest; so we\'ll spare\r\nyou. How I regret that we had not the charming serpent at the masquerade\r\nthe other night!"\r\n\r\nThe moment her ladyship mentioned the masquerade, the conversation\r\nwhich had passed at Lady Singleton\'s came full into Clarence Hervey\'s\r\nrecollection, and his embarrassment was evident--not indeed to Belinda,\r\nwho had turned away to look over some new music that lay upon a stand\r\nat the farthest end of the room; and she found this such a wonderfully\r\ninteresting occupation, that she did not for some minutes hear, or\r\nappear to hear, one word of the conversation which was going on between\r\nMr. Hervey and Lady Delacour. At last, her ladyship tapped her upon\r\nthe shoulder, saying, in a playful tone, "Miss Portman, I arrest your\r\nattention at the suit of Clarence Hervey: this gentleman is passionately\r\nfond of music--to my curse--for he never sees my harp but he worries\r\nme with reproaches for having left off playing upon it. Now he has just\r\ngiven me his word that he will not reproach me again for a month to come\r\nif you will favour us with one air. I assure you, Clarence, that Belinda\r\ntouches a harp divinely--she would absolutely charm----" "Your ladyship\r\nshould not waste such valuable praise," interrupted Belinda. "Do you\r\nforget that Belinda Portman and her accomplishments have already been as\r\nwell advertised as Packwood\'s razor-strops?"\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these words were pronounced made a great impression\r\nupon Clarence Hervey, and he began to believe it was possible that a\r\nniece of the match-making Mrs. Stanhope might not be "a compound of\r\nart and affectation." "Though her aunt has advertised her," said he to\r\nhimself, "she seems to have too much dignity to advertise herself, and\r\nit would be very unjust to blame her for the faults of another person. I\r\nwill see more of her."\r\n\r\nSome morning visitors were announced, who for the time suspended\r\nClarence Hervey\'s reflections: the effect of them, however, immediately\r\nappeared; for as his good opinion of Belinda increased, his ambition to\r\nplease her was strongly excited. He displayed all his powers of wit\r\nand humour; and not only Lady Delacour but every body present observed,\r\n"that Mr. Hervey, who was always the most entertaining man in the world,\r\nthis morning surpassed himself, and was absolutely the most entertaining\r\nman in the universe." He was mortified, notwithstanding; for he\r\ndistinctly perceived, that whilst Belinda joined with ease and dignity\r\nin the general conversation, her manner towards him was grave and\r\nreserved. The next morning he called earlier than usual; but though Lady\r\nDelacour was always at home to him, she was then unluckily dressing\r\nto go to court: he inquired whether Miss Portman would accompany her\r\nladyship, and he learnt from his friend Marriott that she was not to be\r\npresented this day, because Mrs. Franks had not brought home her dress.\r\nMr. Hervey called again two hours afterwards.--Lady Delacour was gone\r\nto court. He asked for Miss Portman. "Not at home," was the mortifying\r\nanswer; though, as he had passed by the windows, he had heard the\r\ndelightful sound of her harp. He walked up and down in the square\r\nimpatiently, till he saw Lady Delacour\'s carriage appear.\r\n\r\n"The drawing-room has lasted an unconscionable time this morning,"\r\nsaid he, as he handed her ladyship out of her coach, "Am not I the most\r\nvirtuous of virtuous women," said Lady Delacour, "to go to court such a\r\nday as this? But," whispered she, as she went up stairs, "like all other\r\namazingly good people, I have amazingly good reasons for being good. The\r\nqueen is soon to give a charming breakfast at Frogmore, and I am paying\r\nmy court with all my might, in hopes of being asked; for Belinda must\r\nsee one of their galas before we leave town, _that_ I\'m determined\r\nupon.--But where is she?" "Not at home," said Clarence, smiling. "Oh,\r\nnot at home is nonsense, you know. Shine out, appear, be found, my\r\nlovely Zara!" cried Lady Delacour, opening the library door. "Here she\r\nis--what doing I know not--studying Hervey\'s Meditations on the Tombs, I\r\nshould guess, by the sanctification of her looks. If you be not totally\r\nabove all sublunary considerations, admire my lilies of the valley, and\r\nlet me give you a lecture, not upon heads, or upon hearts, but on what\r\nis of much more consequence, upon hoops. Every body wears hoops, but\r\nhow few--\'tis a melancholy consideration--how very few can manage them!\r\nThere\'s my friend Lady C----; in an elegant undress she passes for very\r\ngenteel, but put her into a hoop and she looks as pitiable a figure, as\r\nmuch a prisoner, and as little able to walk, as a child in a go-cart.\r\nShe gets on, I grant you, and so does the poor child; but, getting on,\r\nyou know, is not walking. Oh, Clarence, I wish you had seen the two\r\nLady R.\'s sticking close to one another, their father pushing them on\r\ntogether, like two decanters in a bottle-coaster, with such magnificent\r\ndiamond labels round their necks!"\r\n\r\nEncouraged by Clarence Hervey\'s laughter, Lady Delacour went on to mimic\r\nwhat she called the hoop awkwardness of all her acquaintance; and if\r\nthese could have failed to divert Belinda, it was impossible for her to\r\nbe serious when she heard Clarence Hervey declare that he was convinced\r\nhe could manage a hoop as well as any woman in England, except Lady\r\nDelacour.\r\n\r\n"Now here," said he, "is the purblind dowager, Lady Boucher, just at the\r\ndoor, Lady Delacour; she would not know my face, she would not see my\r\nbeard, and I will bet fifty guineas that I come into a room in a hoop,\r\nand that she does not find me out by my air--that I do not betray\r\nmyself, in short, by my masculine awkwardness."\r\n\r\n"I hold you to your word, Clarence," cried Lady Delacour. "They have let\r\nthe purblind dowager in; I hear her on the stairs. Here--through this\r\nway you can go: as you do every thing quicker than any body else in the\r\nworld, you will certainly be full dressed in a quarter of an hour; I\'ll\r\nengage to keep the dowager in scandal for that time. Go! Marriott has\r\nold hoops and old finery of mine, and you have all-powerful influence,\r\nI know, with Marriott: so go and use it, and let us see you in all your\r\nglory--though I vow I tremble for my fifty guineas."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour kept the dowager in scandal, according to her engagement,\r\nfor a good quarter of an hour; then the dresses at the drawing-room took\r\nup another quarter; and, at last, the dowager began to give an account\r\nof sundry wonderful cures that had been performed, to her certain\r\nknowledge, by her favourite concentrated extract or anima of quassia.\r\nShe entered into the history of the negro slave named Quassi, who\r\ndiscovered this medical wood, which he kept a close secret till Mr.\r\nDaghlberg, a magistrate of Surinam, wormed it out of him, brought\r\na branch of the tree to Europe, and communicated it to the great\r\nLinnaeus--when Clarence Hervey was announced by the title of "The\r\nCountess de Pomenars."\r\n\r\n"An emigree--a charming woman!" whispered Lady Delacour "she was to have\r\nbeen at the drawing-room to-day but for a blunder of mine: ready dressed\r\nshe was, and I didn\'t call for her! Ah, Mad. de Pomenars, I am actually\r\nashamed to see you," continued her ladyship; and she went forward to\r\nmeet Clarence Hervey, who really made his entree with very composed\r\nassurance and grace. He managed his hoop with such skill and dexterity,\r\nthat he well deserved the praise of being a universal genius. The\r\nCountess de Pomenars spoke French and broken English incomparably well,\r\nand she made out that she was descended from the Pomenars of the time\r\nof Mad. de Sevigne: she said that she had in her possession several\r\noriginal letters of Mad. de Sevigne, and a lock of Mad. de Grignan\'s\r\nfine hair.\r\n\r\n"I have sometimes fancied, but I believe it is only my fancy," said Lady\r\nDelacour, "that this young lady," turning to Belinda, "is not unlike\r\nyour Mad. de Grignan. I have seen a picture of her at Strawberry-hill."\r\n\r\nMad. de Pomenars acknowledged that there was a resemblance, but added,\r\nthat it was flattery in the extreme to Mad. de Grignan to say so.\r\n\r\n"It would be a sin, undoubtedly, to waste flattery upon the dead, my\r\ndear countess," said Lady Delacour; "but here, without flattery to the\r\nliving, as you have a lock of Mad. de Grignan\'s hair, you can tell us\r\nwhether _la belle chevelure_, of which Mad. de Sevigne talked so much,\r\nwas any thing to be compared to my Belinda\'s." As she spoke, Lady\r\nDelacour, before Belinda was aware of her intentions, dexterously let\r\ndown her beautiful tresses; and the Countess de Pomenars was so much\r\nstruck at the sight, that she was incapable of paying the necessary\r\ncompliments. "Nay, touch it," said Lady Delacour--"it is so fine and so\r\nsoft."\r\n\r\nAt this dangerous moment her ladyship artfully let drop the comb.\r\nClarence Hervey suddenly stooped to pick it up, totally forgetting his\r\nhoop and his character. He threw down the music-stand with his hoop.\r\nLady Delacour exclaimed "Bravissima!" and burst out a-laughing. Lady\r\nBoucher, in amazement, looked from one to another for an explanation,\r\nand was a considerable time before, as she said, she could believe her\r\nown eyes. Clarence Hervey acknowledged he had lost his bet, joined in\r\nthe laugh, and declared that fifty guineas was too little to pay for the\r\nsight of the finest hair that he had ever beheld. "I declare he deserves\r\na lock of _la belle chevelure_ for that speech, Miss Portman," cried\r\nLady Delacour; "I\'ll appeal to all the world--Mad. de Pomenars must have\r\na lock to measure with Mad. de Grignan\'s? Come, a second rape of the\r\nlock, Belinda."\r\n\r\nFortunately for Belinda, "the glittering forfex" was not immediately\r\nproduced, as fine ladies do not now, as in former times, carry any such\r\nuseless implements about with them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the modest, graceful dignity of Miss Portman\'s manners, that\r\nshe escaped without even the charge of prudery. She retired to her own\r\napartment as soon as she could.\r\n\r\n"She passes on in unblenched majesty," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"She is really a charming woman," said Clarence Hervey, in a low voice,\r\nto Lady Delacour, drawing her into a recessed window: he in the same\r\nlow voice continued, "Could I obtain a private audience of a few minutes\r\nwhen your ladyship is at leisure?--I have--" "I am never at leisure,"\r\ninterrupted Lady Delacour; "but if you have any thing particular to say\r\nto me--as I guess you have, by my skill in human nature--come here to my\r\nconcert to-night, before the rest of the world. Wait patiently in the\r\nmusic-room, and perhaps I may grant you a private audience, as you had\r\nthe grace not to call it a _tete-a-tete_. In the mean time, my dear\r\nCountess de Pomenars, had we not better take off our hoops?" In the\r\nevening, Clarence Hervey was in the music-room a considerable time\r\nbefore Lady Delacour appeared: how patiently he waited is not known to\r\nany one but himself.\r\n\r\n"Have not I given you time to compose a charming speech?" said Lady\r\nDelacour as she entered the room; "but make it as short as you can,\r\nunless you wish that Miss Portman should hear it, for she will be down\r\nstairs in three minutes."\r\n\r\n"In one word, then, my dear Lady Delacour, can you, and will you, make\r\nmy peace with Miss Portman?--I am much concerned about that foolish\r\nrazor-strop dialogue which she overheard at Lady Singleton\'s."\r\n\r\n"You are concerned that she overheard it, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"No," said Clarence Hervey, "I am rejoiced that she overheard it, since\r\nit has been the means of convincing me of my mistake; but I am concerned\r\nthat I had the presumption and injustice to judge of Miss Portman so\r\nhastily. I am convinced that, though she is a niece of Mrs. Stanhope\'s,\r\nshe has dignity of mind and simplicity of character. Will you, my dear\r\nLady Delacour, tell her so?"\r\n\r\n"Stay," interrupted Lady Delacour; "let me get it by heart. I should\r\nhave made a terrible bad messenger of the gods and goddesses, for I\r\nnever in my life could, like Iris, repeat a message in the same words\r\nin which it was delivered to me. Let me see--\'Dignity of mind and\r\nsimplicity of character,\' was not it? May not I say at once, \'My dear\r\nBelinda, Clarence Hervey desires me to tell you that he is convinced\r\nyou are an angel?\' That single word _angel_ is so expressive, so\r\ncomprehensive, so comprehensible, it contains, believe me, all that can\r\nbe said or imagined on these occasions, _de part et d\'autre_."\r\n\r\n"But," said Mr. Hervey, "perhaps Miss Portman has heard the song of--\r\n\r\n    \'What know we of angels?--    I spake it in jest.\'"\r\n\r\n"Then you are not in jest, but in downright sober earnest?--Ha!" said\r\nLady Delacour, with an arch look, "I did not know it was already come to\r\n_this_ with you."\r\n\r\nAnd her ladyship, turning to her piano-forte, played--\r\n\r\n    "There was a young man in Ballinacrasy,\r\n    Who wanted a wife to make him un_asy_,\r\n    And thus in gentle strains he spoke her,\r\n    Arrah, will you marry me, my dear Ally Croker?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," exclaimed Clarence, laughing, "it is not come to _that_ with\r\nme yet, Lady Delacour, I promise you; but is not it possible to say that\r\na young lady has dignity of mind and simplicity of character without\r\nhaving or suggesting any thoughts of marriage?"\r\n\r\n"You make a most proper, but not sufficiently emphatic difference\r\nbetween having or suggesting such thoughts," said Lady Delacour. "A\r\ngentleman sometimes finds it for his interest, his honour, or his\r\npleasure, to suggest what he would not for the world promise,--I mean\r\nperform."\r\n\r\n"A scoundrel," cried Clarence Hervey, "not a gentleman, may find it for\r\nhis honour, or his interest, or his pleasure, to promise what he would\r\nnot perform; but I am not a scoundrel. I never made any promise to man\r\nor woman that I did not keep faithfully. I am not a swindler in love."\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Lady Delacour, "you would have no scruple to trifle or\r\nflatter a woman out of her heart."\r\n\r\n_"Cela est selon!"_ said Clarence smiling; "a fair exchange, you know,\r\nis no robbery. When a fine woman robs me of my heart, surely Lady\r\nDelacour could not expect that I should make no attempt upon hers."--"Is\r\nthis part of my message to Miss Portman?" said Lady Delacour. "As your\r\nladyship pleases," said Clarence; "I trust entirely to your discretion."\r\n\r\n"Why I really have a great deal of discretion," said Lady Delacour; "but\r\nyou trust too much to it when you expect that I should execute, both\r\nwith propriety and success, the delicate commission of telling a young\r\nlady, who is under my protection, that a young gentleman, who is a\r\nprofessed admirer of mine, is in love with her, but has no thoughts, and\r\nwishes to suggest no thoughts, of marriage."\r\n\r\n"In love!" exclaimed Clarence Hervey; "but when did I ever use the\r\nexpression? In speaking of Miss Portman, I simply expressed esteem and\r\nad--------"\r\n\r\n"No additions," said Lady Delacour; "content yourself with\r\nesteem--simply,--and Miss Portman is safe, and you too, I presume.\r\nApropos; pray, Clarence, how do your esteem and _admiration_ (I may go\r\nas far as that, may not I?) of Miss Portman agree with your admiration\r\nof Lady Delacour?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly well," replied Clarence; "for all the world must be sensible\r\nthat Clarence Hervey is a man of too much taste to compare a country\r\nnovice in wit and accomplishments to Lady Delacour. He might, as men\r\nof genius sometimes do, look forward to the idea of forming a country\r\nnovice for a wife. A man must marry some time or other--but my hour,\r\nthank Heaven, is not come yet."\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven!" said Lady Delacour; "for you know a married man is lost\r\nto the world of fashion and gallantry."\r\n\r\n"Not more so, I should hope, than a married woman," said Clarence\r\nHarvey. Here a loud knocking at the door announced the arrival of\r\ncompany to the concert. "You will make my peace, you promise me, with\r\nMiss Portman," cried Clarence eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will make your peace, and you shall see Belinda smile upon\r\nyou once more, upon condition," continued Lady Delacour, speaking\r\nvery quickly, as if she was hurried by the sound of people coming up\r\nstairs--"but we\'ll talk of that another time."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay, my dear Lady Delacour, now, now," said Clarence, seizing her\r\nhand.--"Upon condition! upon what condition?"\r\n\r\n"Upon condition that you do a little job for me--indeed for Belinda. She\r\nis to go with me to the birth-night, and she has often hinted to me that\r\nour horses are shockingly shabby for people of our condition. I know she\r\nwishes that upon such an occasion--her first appearance at court, you\r\nknow--we should go in style. Now my dear positive lord has _said_ he\r\nwill not let us have a pair of the handsomest horses I ever saw, which\r\nare at Tattersal\'s, and on which Belinda, I know, has secretly set her\r\nheart, as I have openly, in vain."\r\n\r\n"Your ladyship and Miss Portman cannot possibly set your hearts on\r\nany thing in vain--especially on any thing that it is in the power of\r\nClarence Hervey to procure. Then," added he, gallantly kissing her hand,\r\n"may I thus seal my treaty of peace?"\r\n\r\n"What audacity!--don\'t you see these people coming in?" cried Lady\r\nDelacour; and she withdrew her hand, but with no great precipitation.\r\nShe was evidently, "at this moment, as in all the past," neither afraid\r\nnor ashamed that Mr. Hervey\'s devotions to her should be paid in public.\r\nWith much address she had satisfied herself as to his views with respect\r\nto Belinda. She was convinced that he had no immediate thoughts of\r\nmatrimony; but that if he were condemned to marry, Miss Portman would\r\nbe his wife. As this did not interfere with her plans, Lady Delacour was\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWAYS AND MEANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Delacour repeated to Miss Portman the message about\r\n"simplicity of mind and dignity of character," she frankly said--\r\n\r\n"Belinda, notwithstanding all this, observe, I\'m determined to retain\r\nClarence Hervey among the number of my public worshippers during my\r\nlife--which you know cannot last long. After I am gone, my dear, he\'ll\r\nbe all your own, and of that I give you joy. Posthumous fame is a silly\r\nthing, but posthumous jealousy detestable."\r\n\r\nThere was one part of the conversation between Mr. Hervey and her\r\nladyship which she, in her great discretion, did not immediately\r\nrepeat to Miss Portman--that part which related to the horses. In this\r\ntransaction Belinda had no farther share than having once, when her\r\nladyship had the handsome horses brought for her to look at, assented\r\nto the opinion that they were the handsomest horses she ever beheld. Mr.\r\nHervey, however gallantly he replied to her ladyship, was secretly vexed\r\nto find that Belinda had so little delicacy as to permit her name to\r\nbe employed in such a manner. He repented having used the improper\r\nexpression of _dignity of mind_, and he relapsed into his former opinion\r\nof Mrs. Stanhope\'s niece. A relapse is always more dangerous than the\r\nfirst disease. He sent home the horses to Lady Delacour the next\r\nday, and addressed Belinda, when he met her, with the air of a man of\r\ngallantry, who thought that his peace had been cheaply made. But in\r\nproportion as his manners became more familiar, hers grew more reserved.\r\nLady Delacour rallied her upon _her prudery_, but in vain. Clarence\r\nHervey seemed to think that her ladyship had not fulfilled her part of\r\nthe bargain.--"Is not _smiling_," said he, "the epithet always applied\r\nto peace? yet I have not been able to obtain one smile from Miss\r\nPortman since I have been promised peace." Embarrassed by Mr. Hervey\'s\r\nreproaches, and provoked to find that Belinda was proof against all her\r\nraillery, Lady Delacour grew quite ill-humoured towards her. Belinda,\r\nunconscious of having given any just cause of offence, was unmoved; and\r\nher ladyship\'s embarrassment increased. At last, resuming all her former\r\nappearance of friendship and confidence, she suddenly exclaimed one\r\nnight after she had flattered Belinda into high spirits--\r\n\r\n"Do you know, my dear, that I have been so ashamed of myself\r\nfor this week past, that I have hardly dared to look you in the face.\r\nI am sensible I was downright rude and cross to you one day, and ever\r\nsince I have been penitent; and, as all penitents are, very stupid and\r\ndisagreeable, I am sure: but tell me you forgive my caprice, and Lady\r\nDelacour will be herself again."\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to obtain Belinda\'s forgiveness.\r\n\r\n"Indeed," continued Lady Delacour, "you are too good; but then in my\r\nown justification I must say, that I have more things to make me\r\nill-humoured than most people have. Now, my dear, that most obstinate\r\nof human beings, Lord Delacour, has reduced me to the most terrible\r\nsituation--I have made Clarence Hervey buy a pair of horses for me, and\r\nI cannot make my Lord Delacour pay for them; but I forgot to tell you\r\nthat I took your name--not in vain indeed--in this business. I told\r\nClarence, that upon condition he would do this _job_ for me, you would\r\nforgive him for all his sins, and--nay, my dear, why do you look as if\r\nI had stabbed you to the heart?--after all, I only drew upon your\r\npretty mouth for a few smiles. Pray let me see whether it has actually\r\nforgotten _how_ to smile."\r\n\r\nBelinda was too much vexed at this instant to understand raillery. She\r\nwas inspired by anger with unwonted courage, and, losing all fear of\r\nLady Delacour\'s wit, she very seriously expostulated with her ladyship\r\nupon having thus used her name without her consent or knowledge. Belinda\r\nfelt she was now in danger of being led into a situation which might\r\nbe fatal to her reputation and her happiness; and she was the more\r\nsurprised at her ladyship, when she recollected the history she had so\r\nlately heard of Harriot Freke and Colonel Lawless.\r\n\r\n"You cannot but be sensible, Lady Delacour," said Belinda, "that after\r\nthe contempt I have heard Mr. Hervey express for match-making with Mrs.\r\nStanhope\'s nieces, I should degrade myself by any attempts to attract\r\nhis attention. No wit, no eloquence, can change my opinion upon this\r\nsubject--I cannot endure contempt."\r\n\r\n"Very likely--no doubt"--interrupted Lady Delacour; "but if you would\r\nonly open your eyes, which heroines make it a principle never to do--or\r\nelse there would be an end of the novel--if you would only open your\r\neyes, you would see that this man is in love with you; and whilst you\r\nare afraid of his contempt, he is a hundred times more afraid of yours;\r\nand as long as you are each of you in such fear of you know not\r\nwhat, you must excuse me if I indulge myself in a little wholesome\r\nraillery."--Belinda smiled.--"There now; one such smile as that for\r\nClarence Hervey, and I\'m out of debt and danger," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"O Lady Delacour, why, why will you try your power over me in this\r\nmanner?" said Belinda. "You know that I ought not to be persuaded to do\r\nwhat I am conscious is wrong. But a few days ago you told me yourself\r\nthat Mr. Hervey is--is not a marrying man; and a woman of your\r\npenetration must see that--that he only means to flirt with me. I am\r\nnot a match for Mr. Hervey in any respect. He is a man of wit and\r\ngallantry--I am unpractised in the ways of the world. I was not educated\r\nby my aunt Stanhope--I have only been with her a few years--I wish I had\r\nnever been with her in my life."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take care Mr. Hervey shall know that," said Lady Delacour; "but in\r\nthe mean time I do think any fair appraiser of delicate distresses would\r\ndecide that I am, all the circumstances considered, more to be pitied\r\nat this present moment than you are: for the catastrophe of the business\r\nevidently is, that I must pay two hundred guineas for the horses somehow\r\nor other."\r\n\r\n"I can pay for them," exclaimed Belinda, "and will with the greatest\r\npleasure. I will not go to the birthnight--my dress is not bespoke.\r\nWill two hundred guineas pay for the horses? Oh, take the money--pay Mr.\r\nHervey, dear Lady Delacour, and it will all be right."\r\n\r\n"You are a charming girl," said Lady Delacour, embracing her; "but how\r\ncan I answer for it to my conscience, or to your aunt Stanhope, if you\r\ndon\'t appear on the birthnight? That cannot be, my dear; besides, you\r\nknow Mrs. Franks will send home your drawing-room dress to-day, and\r\nit would be so foolish to be presented for nothing--not to go to the\r\nbirthnight afterwards. If you say _a_ you must say _b."_\r\n\r\n"Then," said Belinda, "I will not go to the drawing-room."--"Not go, my\r\ndear! What! throw away fifty guineas for nothing! Really I never saw any\r\none so lavish of her money, and so economic of her smiles."\r\n\r\n"Surely," said Miss Portman, "it is better for me to throw away fifty\r\nguineas, poor as I am, than to hazard the happiness of my life. Your\r\nladyship knows that if I say _a_ to Mr. Hervey, I must say _b_. No, no,\r\nmy dear Lady Delacour; here is the draught for two hundred guineas: pay\r\nMr. Hervey, for Heaven\'s sake, and there is an end of the business."\r\n\r\n"What a positive child it is! Well, then, it shall not be forced to say\r\nthe a, b, c, of Cupid\'s alphabet, to that terrible pedagogue, Clarence\r\nHervey, till it pleases: but seriously, Miss Portman, I am concerned\r\nthat you will make me take this draught: it is absolutely robbing you.\r\nBut Lord Delacour\'s the person you must blame--it is all his obstinacy:\r\nhaving once said he would not pay for the horses, he would see them\r\nand me and the whole human race expire before he would change his silly\r\nmind.--Next month I shall have it in my power, my dear, to repay you\r\nwith a thousand thanks; and in a few months more we shall have another\r\nbirthday, and a new star shall appear in the firmament of fashion,\r\nand it shall be called Belinda. In the mean time, my dear, upon second\r\nthoughts, perhaps we can get Mrs. Franks to dispose of your drawing-room\r\ndress to some person of taste, and you may keep your fifty guineas for\r\nthe next occasion. I\'ll see what can be done.--Adieu! a thousand thanks,\r\nsilly child as you are."\r\n\r\nMrs. Franks at first declared that it would be an impossibility to\r\ndispose of Miss Portman\'s dress, though she would do any thing upon\r\nearth to oblige Lady Delacour; however, ten guineas made every thing\r\npossible. Belinda rejoiced at having, as she thought, extricated herself\r\nat so cheap a rate; and well pleased with her own conduct, she wrote to\r\nher aunt Stanhope, to inform her of as much of the transaction as she\r\ncould disclose, without betraying Lady Delacour. "Her ladyship,"\r\nshe said, "had immediate occasion for two hundred guineas, and to\r\naccommodate her with this sum she had given up the idea of going to\r\ncourt."\r\n\r\nThe tenor of Miss Portman\'s letter will be sufficiently apparent from\r\nMrs. Stanhope\'s answer.\r\n\r\nMRS. STANHOPE TO MISS PORTMAN.\r\n\r\n"Bath, June 2nd.\r\n\r\n"I cannot but feel some astonishment, Belinda, at your very\r\nextraordinary conduct, and more extraordinary letter. What you can mean\r\nby principles and delicacy I own I don\'t pretend to understand, when\r\nI see you not only forget the respect that is due to the opinions\r\nand advice of the aunt to whom you owe every thing; but you take upon\r\nyourself to lavish her money, without common honesty. I send you two\r\nhundred guineas, and desire you to go to court--you lend my two hundred\r\nguineas to Lady Delacour, and inform me that as you think yourself bound\r\nin honour to her ladyship, you cannot explain all the particulars to\r\nme, otherwise you are sure I should approve of the reasons which have\r\ninfluenced you. Mighty satisfactory, truly! And then, to mend the\r\nmatter, you tell me that you do not think that in your situation in life\r\nit is necessary that you should go to court. Your opinions and mine, you\r\nadd, differ in many points. Then I must say that you are as ungrateful\r\nas you are presumptuous; for I am not such a novice in the affairs of\r\nthe world as to be ignorant that when a young lady professes to be of\r\na different opinion from her friends, it is only a prelude to something\r\nworse. She begins by saying that she is determined to think for herself,\r\nand she is determined to act for herself--and then it is all over with\r\nher: and all the money, &c. that has been spent upon her education is so\r\nmuch dead loss to her friends.\r\n\r\n"Now I look upon it that a young girl who has been brought up, and\r\nbrought forward in the world as you have been by connexions, is bound to\r\nbe guided implicitly by them in all her conduct. What should you think\r\nof a man who, after he had been brought into parliament by a friend,\r\nwould go and vote against that friend\'s opinions? You do not want sense,\r\nBelinda--you perfectly understand me; and consequently your errors I\r\nmust impute to the defect of your heart, and not of your judgment. I see\r\nthat, on account of the illness of the princess, the king\'s birthday is\r\nput off for a fortnight. If you manage properly, and if (unknown to Lady\r\n----, who certainly has not used you well in this business, and to whom\r\ntherefore you owe no peculiar delicacy) you make Lord ---- sensible how\r\nmuch your aunt Stanhope is disappointed and displeased (as I most truly\r\nam) at your intention of missing this opportunity of appearing at court;\r\nit is ten to one but his lordship--who has not made it a point to refuse\r\nyour request, I suppose--will pay you your two hundred guineas. You of\r\ncourse will make proper acknowledgments; but at the same time entreat\r\nthat his lordship will not _commit_ you with his lady, as she might\r\nbe offended at your application to him. I understand from an intimate\r\nacquaintance of his, that you are a great favourite of his lordship; and\r\nthough an obstinate, he is a good-natured man, and can have no fear of\r\nbeing governed by you; consequently he will do just as you would have\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Then you have an opportunity of representing the thing in the\r\nprettiest manner imaginable to Lady ----, as an instance of her lord\'s\r\nconsideration for her: so you will oblige all parties (a very desirable\r\nthing) without costing yourself one penny, and go to the birthnight\r\nafter all: and this only by using a little address, without which\r\nnothing is to be done in this world.\r\n\r\n"Yours affectionately (if you follow my advice),\r\n\r\n"SELINA STANHOPE."\r\n\r\nBelinda, though she could not, consistently with what she thought right,\r\nfollow the advice so artfully given to her in this epistle, was yet\r\nextremely concerned to find that she had incurred the displeasure of an\r\naunt to whom she thought herself under obligations. She resolved to lay\r\nby as much as she possibly could, from the interest of her fortune, and\r\nto repay the two hundred guineas to Mrs. Stanhope. She was conscious\r\nthat she had no right to lend this money to Lady Delacour, if her aunt\r\nhad expressly desired that she should spend it only on her court-dress;\r\nbut this had not distinctly been expressed when Mrs. Stanhope sent her\r\nniece the draft. That lady was in the habit of speaking and writing\r\nambiguously, so that even those who knew her best were frequently in\r\ndoubt how to interpret her words. Yet she was extremely displeased when\r\nher hints and her half-expressed wishes were not understood. Beside\r\nthe concern she felt from the thoughts of having displeased her aunt,\r\nBelinda was both vexed and mortified to perceive that in Clarence\r\nHervey\'s manner towards her there was not the change which she had\r\nexpected that her conduct would naturally produce.\r\n\r\nOne day she was surprised at his reproaching her for caprice in having\r\ngiven up her intentions of going to court. Lady Delacour\'s embarrassment\r\nwhilst Mr. Hervey spoke, Belinda attributed to her ladyship\'s desire\r\nthat Clarence should not know that she had been obliged to borrow the\r\nmoney to pay him for the horses. Belinda thought that this was a\r\nspecies of mean pride; but she made it a point to keep her ladyship\'s\r\nsecret--she therefore slightly answered Mr. Hervey, "that she wondered\r\nthat a man who was so well acquainted with the female sex should be\r\nsurprised at any instance of caprice from a woman." The conversation\r\nthen took another turn, and whilst they were talking of indifferent\r\nsubjects, in came Lord Delacour\'s man, Champfort, with Mrs. Stanhope\'s\r\ndraft for two hundred guineas, which the coachmaker\'s man had just\r\nbrought back because Miss Portman had forgotten to endorse it. Belinda\'s\r\nastonishment was almost as great at this instant as Lady Delacour\'s\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n"Come this way, my dear, and we\'ll find you a pen and ink. You need not\r\nwait, Champfort; but tell the man to wait for the draft--Miss Portman\r\nwill endorse it immediately."--And she took Belinda into another room.\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens! Has not this money been paid to Mr. Hervey?" exclaimed\r\nBelinda.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear; but I will take all the blame upon myself, or, which\r\nwill do just as well for you, throw it all upon my better half. My Lord\r\nDelacour would not pay for my new carriage. The coachmaker, insolent\r\nanimal, would not let it out of his yard without two hundred guineas in\r\nready money. Now you know I had the horses, and what could I do with the\r\nhorses without the carriage? Clarence Hervey, I knew, could wait for\r\nhis money better than a poor devil of a coachmaker; so I paid the\r\ncoachmaker, and a few months sooner or later can make no difference to\r\nClarence, who rolls in gold, my dear--if that will be any comfort to\r\nyou, as I hope it will."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what will he think of me!" said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Nay, what will he think of _me_, child!"\r\n\r\n"Lady Delacour," said Belinda, in a firmer tone than she had ever before\r\nspoken, "I must insist upon this draft being given to Mr. Hervey."\r\n\r\n"Absolutely impossible, my dear.--I cannot take it from the coachmaker;\r\nhe has sent home the carriage: the thing\'s done, and cannot be undone.\r\nBut come, since I know nothing else will make you easy, I will take\r\nthis mighty favour from Mr. Hervey entirely upon my own conscience: you\r\ncannot object to that, for you are not the keeper of my conscience. I\r\nwill tell Clarence the whole business, and do you honour due, my dear:\r\nso endorse the check, whilst I go and sound both the praises of your\r\ndignity of mind, and simplicity of character, &c. &c. &c. &c."\r\n\r\nHer ladyship broke away from Belinda, returned to Clarence Hervey, and\r\ntold the whole affair with that peculiar grace with which she knew how\r\nto make a good story of a bad one. Clarence was as favourable an auditor\r\nat this time as she could possibly have found; for no human being could\r\nvalue money less than he did, and all sense of her ladyship\'s meanness\r\nwas lost in his joy at discovering that Belinda was worthy of his\r\nesteem. Now he felt in its fullest extent all the power she had over\r\nhis heart, and he was upon the point of declaring his attachment to her,\r\nwhen _malheureusement_ Sir Philip Baddely and Mr. Rochfort announced\r\nthemselves by the noise they made on the staircase. These were the young\r\nmen who had spoken in such a contemptuous manner at Lady Singleton\'s of\r\nthe match-making Mrs. Stanhope and her nieces. Mr. Hervey was anxious\r\nthat they should not penetrate into the state of his heart, and he\r\nconcealed his emotion by instantly assuming that kind of rattling gaiety\r\nwhich always delighted his companions, who were ever in want of some\r\none to set their stagnant ideas in motion. At last they insisted upon\r\ncarrying Clarence away with them to taste some wines for Sir Philip\r\nBaddely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SERPENTINE RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his way to St. James\'s street, where the wine-merchant lived, Sir\r\nPhilip Baddely picked up several young men of his acquaintance, who were\r\nall eager to witness a trial of _taste_, of epicurean taste, between the\r\nbaronet and Clarence Hervey. Amongst his other accomplishments our hero\r\npiqued himself upon the exquisite accuracy of his organs of taste. He\r\nneither loved wine, nor was he fond of eating; but at fine dinners,\r\nwith young men who were real epicures, Hervey gave himself the airs of\r\na connoisseur, and asserted superiority even in judging of wine and\r\nsauces. Having gained immortal honour at an entertainment by gravely\r\nprotesting that some turtle would have been excellent if it had not\r\nbeen done _a bubble too much_, he presumed, elate as he was with the\r\napplauses of the company, to assert, that no man in England had a more\r\ncorrect taste than himself.--Sir Philip Baddely could not passively\r\nsubmit to this arrogance; he loudly proclaimed, that though he would\r\nnot dispute Mr. Hervey\'s judgment as far as eating was concerned, yet he\r\nwould defy him as a connoisseur in wines, and he offered to submit the\r\ncompetition to any eminent wine-merchant in London, and to some common\r\nfriend of acknowledged taste and experience.--Mr. Rochfort was chosen\r\nas the common friend of acknowledged taste and experience; and a\r\nfashionable wine-merchant was pitched upon to decide with him the merits\r\nof these candidates for bacchanalian fame. Sir Philip, who was just\r\ngoing to furnish his cellars, was a person of importance to the\r\nwine-merchant, who produced accordingly his choicest treasures. Sir\r\nPhilip and Clarence tasted of all in their turns; Sir Philip with real,\r\nand Clarence with affected gravity; and they delivered their opinions\r\nof the positive and comparative merits of each. The wine-merchant\r\nevidently, as Mr. Hervey thought, leaned towards Sir Philip. "Upon\r\nmy word, Sir Philip, you are right--that wine is the best I have--you\r\ncertainly have a most discriminating taste," said the complaisant\r\nwine-merchant.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what," cried Sir Philip, "the thing is this: by Jove!\r\nnow, there\'s no possibility now--no possibility now, by Jove! of\r\nimposing upon me."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Clarence Hervey, "would you engage to tell the differences\r\nbetween these two wines ten times running, blind-fold?"\r\n\r\n"Ten times! that\'s nothing," replied Sir Philip: "yes, fifty times, I\r\nwould, by Jove!"\r\n\r\nBut when it came to the trial, Sir Philip had nothing left but oaths\r\nin his own favour. Clarence Hervey was victorious; and his sense of the\r\nimportance of this victory was much increased by the fumes of the wine,\r\nwhich began to operate upon his brain. His triumph was, as he said it\r\nought to be, bacchanalian: he laughed and sang with anacreontic\r\nspirit, and finished by declaring that he deserved to be crowned with\r\nvine-leaves.\r\n\r\n"Dine with me, Clarence," said Rochfort, "and we\'ll crown you with three\r\ntimes three; and," whispered he to Sir Philip, "we\'ll have another trial\r\nafter dinner."\r\n\r\n"But as it\'s not near dinner-time yet--what shall we do with ourselves\r\ntill dinner-time?" said Sir Philip, yawning pathetically.\r\n\r\nClarence not being used to drink in a morning, though all his companions\r\nwere, was much affected by the wine, and Rochfort proposed that they\r\nshould take a turn in the park to cool Hervey\'s head. To Hyde-park they\r\nrepaired; Sir Philip boasting, all the way they walked, of the superior\r\nstrength of his head.\r\n\r\nClarence protested that his own was stronger than any man\'s in England,\r\nand observed, that at this instant he walked better than any person in\r\ncompany, Sir Philip Baddely not excepted. Now Sir Philip Baddely was a\r\nnoted pedestrian, and he immediately challenged our hero to walk\r\nwith him for any money he pleased. "Done," said Clarence, "for ten\r\nguineas--for any money you please:" and instantly they set out to\r\nwalk, as Rochfort cried "one, two, three, and away; keep the path, and\r\nwhichever reaches that elm tree first has it."\r\n\r\nThey were exactly even for some yards, then Clarence got ahead of Sir\r\nPhilip, and he reached the elm tree first; but as he waved his hat,\r\nexclaiming, "Clarence has won the day," Sir Philip came up with his\r\ncompanions, and coolly informed him that he had lost his wager--"Lost!\r\nlost! lost! Clarence--fairly lost."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I reach the tree first?" said Clarence.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered his companions; "but you didn\'t keep the path. You\r\nturned out of the way when you met that crowd of children yonder."\r\n\r\n"Now _I_," said Sir Philip, "dashed fairly through them--kept the path,\r\nand won my bet."\r\n\r\n"But," said Hervey, "would you have had me run over that little child,\r\nwho was stooping down just in my way?"\r\n\r\n"_I_!\' not I," said Sir Philip; "but I would have you go through with\r\nyour civility: if a man will be polite, he must pay for his politeness\r\nsometimes.--You said you\'d lay me _any money_ I pleased, recollect--now\r\nI\'m very moderate--and as you are a particular friend, Clarence, I\'ll\r\nonly take your ten guineas."\r\n\r\nA loud laugh from his companions provoked Clarence; they were glad "to\r\nhave a laugh against him," because he excited universal envy by the real\r\nsuperiority of his talents, and by his perpetually taking the lead in\r\nthose trifles which were beneath his ambition, and exactly suited to\r\nengage the attention of his associates.\r\n\r\n"Be it so, and welcome; I\'ll pay ten guineas for having better manners\r\nthan any of you," cried Hervey, laughing; "but remember, though I\'ve lost\r\nthis bet, I don\'t give up my pedestrian fame.--Sir Philip, there are no\r\nwomen to throw golden apples in my way now, and no children for me to\r\nstumble over: I dare you to another trial--double or quit."\r\n\r\n"I\'m off, by Jove!" said Sir Philip. "I\'m too hot, damme, to walk with\r\nyou any more--but I\'m your man if you\'ve a mind for a swim--here\'s the\r\nSerpentine river, Clarence--hey? damn it!--hey?"\r\n\r\nSir Philip and all his companions knew that Clarence had never learned\r\nto swim.\r\n\r\n"You may wink at one another, as wisely as you please," said Clarence,\r\n"but come on, my boys--I am your man for a swim--hundred guineas upon\r\nit!\r\n\r\n    ----\'Darest thou, Rochfort, now\r\n    Leap in with me into this weedy flood,\r\n    And swim to yonder point?\'"\r\n\r\nand instantly Hervey, who had in his confused head some recollection of\r\nan essay of Dr. Franklin on swimming, by which he fancied that he could\r\nensure at once his safety and his fame, threw off his coat and jumped\r\ninto the river--luckily he was not in boots. Rochfort, and all the other\r\nyoung men stood laughing by the river side.\r\n\r\n"Who the devil are these two that seem to be making up to us?" said\r\nSir Philip, looking at two gentlemen who were coming towards them; "St.\r\nGeorge, hey? you know every body."\r\n\r\n"The foremost is Percival, of Oakly-park, I think, \'pon my honour,"\r\nreplied Mr. St. George, and he then began to settle how many thousands\r\na year Mr. Percival was worth. This point was not decided when the\r\ngentlemen came up to the spot where Sir Philip was standing.\r\n\r\nThe child for whose sake Clarence Hervey had lost his bet was Mr.\r\nPercival\'s, and he came to thank him for his civility.--The gentleman\r\nwho accompanied Mr. Percival was an old friend of Clarence Hervey\'s; he\r\nhad met him abroad, but had not seen him for some years.\r\n\r\n"Pray, gentlemen," said he to Sir Philip and his party, "is Mr. Clarence\r\nHervey amongst you? I think I saw him pass by me just now."\r\n\r\n"Damn it, yes--where is Clary, though?" exclaimed Sir Philip, suddenly\r\nrecollecting himself.--Clarence Hervey at this instant was drowning: he\r\nhad got out of his depth, and had struggled in vain to recover himself.\r\n\r\n"Curse me, if it\'s not all over with Clary," continued Sir Philip. "Do\r\nany of you see his head any where? Damn you, Rochfort, yonder it is."\r\n\r\n"Damme, so it is," said Rochfort; "but he\'s so heavy in his clothes,\r\nhe\'d pull me down along with him to Davy\'s locker:--damme, if I\'ll go\r\nafter him."\r\n\r\n"Damn it, though, can\'t some of ye swim? Can\'t some of ye jump in?"\r\ncried Sir Philip, turning to his companions: "damn it, Clarence will go\r\nto the bottom."\r\n\r\nAnd so he inevitably would have done, had not Mr. Percival at this\r\ninstant leaped into the river, and seized hold of the drowning Clarence.\r\nIt was with great difficulty that he dragged him to the shore.--Sir\r\nPhilip\'s party, as soon as the danger was over, officiously offered\r\ntheir assistance. Clarence Hervey was absolutely senseless. "Damn it,\r\nwhat shall we do with him now?" said Sir Philip: "Damn it, we must call\r\nsome of the people from the boat-house--he\'s as heavy as lead: damn me,\r\nif I know what to do with him." [2]\r\n\r\nWhilst Sir Philip was damning himself, Mr. Percival ran to the\r\nboat-house for assistance, and they carried the body into the house.\r\nThe elderly gentleman who had accompanied Mr. Percival now made his way\r\nthrough the midst of the noisy crowd, and directed what should be done\r\nto restore Mr. Hervey\'s suspended animation. Whilst he was employed in\r\nthis benevolent manner, Clarence\'s worthy friends were sneering at him,\r\nand whispering to one another; "Ecod, he talks as if he was a doctor,"\r\nsaid Rochfort.\r\n\r\n"\'Pon honour, I do believe," said St. George, "he is the famous Dr.\r\nX----; I met him at a circulating library t\'other day."\r\n\r\n"Dr. X---- the writer, do you mean?" said Sir Philip; "then, damn me,\r\nwe\'d better get out of his way as fast as we can, or he\'ll have some\r\nof us down in black and white; and curse me, if I should choose to meet\r\nwith myself in a book."\r\n\r\n"No danger of that," said Rochfort; "for how can one meet with oneself\r\nin a book, Sir Philip, if one never opens one?--By Jove, that\'s the true\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"But, \'pon my honour," said St. George, "I should like of all things to\r\nsee myself in print; \'twould make one famously famous."\r\n\r\n"Damn me, if I don\'t flatter myself, though, one can make oneself famous\r\nenough to all intents and purposes without having any thing to say to\r\nthese author geniuses. You\'re a famous fellow, faith! to want to see\r\nyourself in print--I\'ll publish this in Bond-street: damn it, in point\r\nof famousness, I\'d sport my Random against all the books that ever were\r\nread or written, damn me! But what are we doing here?"\r\n\r\n"Hervey\'s in good hands," said Rochfort, "and this here\'s a cursed\r\nstupid lounge for us--besides, it\'s getting towards dinner-time; so\r\nmy voice is, let\'s be off, and we can leave St. George (who has such a\r\nfamous mind to be in the doctor\'s book) to bring Clary after us, when\r\nhe\'s ready for dinner and good company again, you know--ha! ha! ha!"\r\n\r\nAway the faithful friends went to the important business of their day.\r\n\r\nWhen Clarence Hervey came to his senses he started up, rubbed his eyes,\r\nand looked about, exclaiming--"What\'s all this?--Where am I?--Where\'s\r\nBaddely?--Where\'s Rochfort?--Where are they all?"\r\n\r\n"Gone home to dinner," answered Mr. St. George, who was a hanger-on of\r\nSir Philip\'s; "but they left me to bring you after them. Faith, Clary,\r\nyou\'ve had a squeak for your life! \'Pon my honour, we thought at one\r\ntime it was all over with you--but you\'re a rough one: we shan\'t have to\r\n\'pour over your grave a full bottle of red\' as yet, my boy--you\'ll do as\r\nwell as ever. So I\'ll step and call a coach for you, Clary, and we shall\r\nbe at dinner as soon as the best of \'em after all, by jingo! I leave you\r\nin good hands with the doctor here, that brought you to life, and the\r\ngentleman that dragged you out of the water. Here\'s a note for you,"\r\nwhispered Mr. St. George, as he leaned over Clarence Hervey--"here\'s\r\na note for you from Sir Philip and Rochfort: read it, do you mind, to\r\n_yourself_."\r\n\r\n"If I can," said Clarence; "but Sir Philip writes a _bloody bad hand_."\r\n[3]\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s a _baronet_," said St. George, "ha! ha! ha!" and, charmed with\r\nhis own wit, he left the boat-house.\r\n\r\nClarence with some difficulty deciphered the note, which contained these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n"Quiz the doctor, Clary, as soon as you are up to it--he\'s an author--so\r\nfair game--quiz the doctor, and we\'ll drink your health with three times\r\nthree in Rochfort\'s burgundy.\r\n\r\n"Yours, &c.\r\n\r\n"PHIL. BADDELY.\r\n\r\n"P.S. Burn this when read."\r\n\r\nWith the request contained in the postscript Clarence immediately\r\ncomplied; he threw the note into the fire with indignation the moment\r\nthat he had read it, and turning towards the gentleman to whom it\r\nalluded, he began to express, in the strongest terms, his gratitude\r\nfor their benevolence. But he stopped short in the midst of his\r\nacknowledgments, when he discovered to whom he was speaking.\r\n\r\n"Dr. X----!" cried he. "Is it possible? How rejoiced I am to see you,\r\nand how rejoiced I am to be obliged to you! There is not a man in\r\nEngland to whom I would rather be obliged."\r\n\r\n"You are not acquainted with Mr. Percival, I believe," said Dr. X----:\r\n"give me leave, Mr. Percival, to introduce to you the young gentleman\r\nwhose life you have saved, and whose life--though, by the company in\r\nwhich you found him, you might not think so--is worth saving. This, sir,\r\nis no less a man than Mr. Clarence Hervey, of whose universal genius you\r\nhave just had a specimen; for which he was crowned with sedges, as he\r\nwell deserved, by the god of the Serpentine river. Do not be so unjust\r\nas to imagine that he has any of the presumption which is sometimes the\r\nchief characteristic of a man of universal genius. Mr. Clarence Hervey\r\nis, without exception, the most humble man of my acquaintance; for\r\nwhilst all good judges would think him fit company for Mr. Percival, he\r\nhas the humility to think himself upon a level with Mr. Rochfort and Sir\r\nPhilip Baddely."\r\n\r\n"You have lost as little of your satirical wit, Dr. X----, as of your\r\nactive benevolence, I perceive," said Clarence Hervey, "since I met you\r\nabroad. But as I cannot submit to your unjust charge of humility, will\r\nyou tell me where you are to be found in town, and to-morrow------"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow," said Dr. X----: "why not\r\nto-day?"\r\n\r\n"I am engaged," said Clarence, hesitating and laughing---"I am\r\nunfortunately engaged to-day to dine with Mr. Rochfort and Sir Philip\r\nBaddely, and in the evening I am to be at Lady Delacour\'s."\r\n\r\n"Lady Delacour! Not the same Lady Delacour whom four years ago, when we\r\nmet at Florence, you compared to the Venus de Medici--no, no, it cannot\r\nbe the same--a goddess of four years\' standing!--Incredible!"\r\n\r\n"Incredible as it seems," said Clarence, "it is true: I admire her\r\nladyship more than ever I did."\r\n\r\n"Like a true connoisseur," said Dr. X----, "you admire a fine picture\r\nthe older it grows: I hear that her ladyship\'s face is really one of the\r\nfinest pieces of painting extant, with the advantage of\r\n\r\n    \'Ev\'ry grace which time alone can grant.\'"\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Dr. X----," cried Mr. Percival, "no more wit at Lady\r\nDelacour\'s expense: I have a fellow-feeling for Mr. Hervey."\r\n\r\n"Why, you are not in love with her ladyship, are you?" said Dr. X----.\r\n"I am not in love with Lady Delacour\'s picture of herself," replied Mr.\r\nPercival, "but I was once in love with the original."\r\n\r\n"How?--When?--Where?" cried Clarence Hervey, in a tone totally different\r\nfrom that in which he had first addressed Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow you shall know the how, the when, and the where," said Mr.\r\nPercival: "here\'s your friend, Mr. St. George, and his coach."\r\n\r\n"The deuce take him!" said Clarence: "but tell me, is it possible that\r\nyou are not in love with her still?--and why?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" said Mr. Percival--"why? Come to-morrow, as you have promised, to\r\nUpper Grosvenor-street, and let me introduce you to Lady Anne Percival;\r\nshe can answer your question better than I can--if not entirely to your\r\nsatisfaction, at least entirely to mine, which is more surprising, as\r\nthe lady is my wife."\r\n\r\nBy this time Clarence Hervey was equipped in a dry suit of clothes;\r\nand by the strength of an excellent constitution, which he had never\r\ninjured, even amongst his dissipated associates, he had recovered from\r\nthe effects of his late imprudence.--"Clary, let\'s away, here\'s the\r\ncoach," said Mr. St. George. "Why, my boy--that\'s a famous fellow,\r\nfaith!--why, you look the better for being drowned. \'Pon honour, if I\r\nwere you, I would jump into the Serpentine river once a day."\r\n\r\n"If I could always be sure of such good friends to pull me out," said\r\nHervey.--"Pray, St. George, by-the-bye, what were you, and Rochfort,\r\nand Sir Philip, and all the rest of my friends doing, whilst I was\r\ndrowning?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say particularly, upon my soul," replied Mr. St. George; "for\r\nmy own part, I was in boots, so you know I was out of the question. But\r\nwhat signifies all that now? Come, come, we had best think of looking\r\nafter our dinners."\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey, who had very quick feelings, was extremely hurt by\r\nthe indifference which his dear friends had shown when his life was in\r\ndanger: he was apt to believe that he was really an object of affection\r\nand admiration amongst his companions; and that though they were neither\r\nvery wise, nor very witty, they were certainly very good-natured. When\r\nthey had forfeited, by their late conduct, these claims to his regard,\r\nhis partiality for them was changed into contempt.\r\n\r\n"You had better come home and dine with me, Mr. Hervey," said Mr.\r\nPercival, "if you be not absolutely engaged; for here is your physician,\r\nwho tells me that temperance is necessary for a man just recovered from\r\ndrowning, and Mr. Rochfort keeps too good a table, I am told, for one in\r\nyour condition."\r\n\r\nClarence accepted of this invitation with a degree of pleasure which\r\nperfectly astonished Mr. St. George.\r\n\r\n"Every man knows his own affairs best," said he to Clarence, as he\r\nstepped into his hackney coach; "but for my share, I will do my friend\r\nRochfort the justice to say that no one lives as well as he does."\r\n\r\n"If to live well mean nothing but to eat," said Clarence.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Dr. X----, looking at his watch, "it will be eight o\'clock\r\nby the time we get to Upper Grosvenor-street, and Lady Anne will\r\nprobably have waited dinner for us about two hours, which I apprehend\r\nis sufficient to try the patience of any woman but Griselda. Do\r\nnot," continued he, turning to Clarence Hervey, "expect to see an\r\nold-fashioned, spiritless, patient Griselda, in Lady Anne Percival: I\r\ncan assure you that she is--but I will neither tell you what she is,\r\nnor what she is not. Every man who has any abilities, likes to have the\r\npleasure and honour of finding out a character by his own penetration,\r\ninstead of having it forced upon him at full length in capital\r\nletters of gold, finely emblazoned and illuminated by the hand of some\r\ninjudicious friend: every child thinks the violet of his own finding the\r\nsweetest. I spare you any farther allusion and illustrations," concluded\r\nDr. X----, "for here we are, thank God, in Upper Grosvenor-street."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nA FAMILY PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey found Lady Anne Percival in the midst of her children, who all\r\nturned their healthy, rosy, intelligent faces towards the door, the\r\nmoment that they heard their father\'s voice. Clarence Hervey was so much\r\nstruck with the expression of happiness in Lady Anne\'s countenance, that\r\nhe absolutely forgot to compare her beauty with Lady Delacour\'s. Whether\r\nher eyes were large or small, blue or hazel, he could not tell; nay,\r\nhe might have been puzzled if he had been asked the colour of her hair.\r\nWhether she were handsome by the rules of art, he knew not; but he felt\r\nthat she had the essential charm of beauty, the power of prepossessing\r\nthe heart immediately in her favour. The effect of her manners, like\r\nthat of her beauty, was rather to be felt than described. Every body\r\nwas at ease in her company, and none thought themselves called upon to\r\nadmire her. To Clarence Hervey, who had been used to the brilliant and\r\n_exigeante_ Lady Delacour, this respite from the fatigue of admiration\r\nwas peculiarly agreeable. The unconstrained cheerfulness of Lady Anne\r\nPercival spoke a mind at ease, and immediately imparted happiness by\r\nexacting sympathy; but in Lady Delacour\'s wit and gaiety there was an\r\nappearance of art and effort, which often destroyed the pleasure that\r\nshe wished to communicate. Mr. Hervey was, perhaps unusually, disposed\r\nto reflection, by having just escaped from drowning; for he had made all\r\nthese comparisons, and came to this conclusion, with the accuracy of a\r\nmetaphysician, who has been accustomed to study cause and effect--indeed\r\nthere was no species of knowledge for which he had not taste and\r\ntalents, though, to please fools, he too often affected "the bliss of\r\nignorance."\r\n\r\nThe children at Lady Anne Percival\'s happened to be looking at some gold\r\nfish, which were in a glass globe, and Dr. X----, who was a general\r\nfavourite with the younger as well as with the elder part of the family,\r\nwas seized upon the moment he entered the room: a pretty little girl of\r\nfive years old took him prisoner by the flap of the coat, whilst two of\r\nher brothers assailed him with questions about the ears, eyes, and\r\nfins of fishes. One of the little boys filliped the glass globe, and\r\nobserved, that the fish immediately came to the surface of the water,\r\nand seemed to hear the noise very quickly; but his brother doubted\r\nwhether the fish heard the noise, and remarked, that they might be\r\ndisturbed by seeing or feeling the motion of the water, when the glass\r\nwas struck.\r\n\r\nDr. X---- observed, that this was a very learned dispute, and that the\r\nquestion had been discussed by no less a person than the Abbe Nollet;\r\nand he related some of the ingenious experiments tried by that\r\ngentleman, to decide whether fishes can or cannot hear. Whilst the\r\ndoctor was speaking, Clarence Hervey was struck with the intelligent\r\ncountenance of one of the little auditors, a girl of about ten or twelve\r\nyears old; he was surprised to discover in her features, though not in\r\ntheir expression, a singular resemblance to Lady Delacour. He remarked\r\nthis to Mr. Percival, and the child, who overheard him, blushed as red\r\nas scarlet. Dinner was announced at this instant, and Clarence Hervey\r\nthought no more of the circumstance, attributing the girl\'s blush\r\nto confusion at being looked at so earnestly. One of the little boys\r\nwhispered as they were going down to dinner, "Helena, I do believe that\r\nthis is the good-natured gentleman who went out of the path to make room\r\nfor us, instead of running over us as the other man did." The children\r\nagreed that Clarence Hervey certainly was the _good-natured gentleman_,\r\nand upon the strength of this observation, one of the boys posted\r\nhimself next to Clarence at dinner, and by all the little playful\r\nmanoeuvres in his power endeavoured to show his gratitude, and to\r\ncultivate a friendship which had been thus auspiciously commenced.\r\nMr. Hervey, who piqued himself upon being able always to suit his\r\nconversation to his companions, distinguished himself at dinner by an\r\naccount of the Chinese fishing-bird, from which he passed to the various\r\ningenious methods of fishing practised by the Russian Cossacks. From\r\nmodern he went to ancient fish, and he talked of that which was so much\r\nadmired by the Roman epicures for exhibiting a succession of beautiful\r\ncolours whilst it is dying; and which was, upon that account,\r\nalways suffered to die in the presence of the guests, as part of the\r\nentertainment.--Clarence was led on by the questions of the children\r\nfrom fishes to birds; he spoke of the Roman aviaries, which were\r\nso constructed as to keep from the sight of the prisoners that they\r\ncontained, "the fields, woods, and every object which might remind them\r\nof their former liberty."--From birds he was going on to beasts, when he\r\nwas nearly struck dumb by the forbidding severity with which an elderly\r\nlady, who sat opposite to him, fixed her eyes upon him. He had not,\r\ntill this instant, paid the smallest attention to her; but her stern\r\ncountenance was now so strongly contrasted with the approving looks of\r\nthe children who sat next to her, that he could not help remarking it.\r\nHe asked her to do him the honour to drink a glass of wine with him. She\r\ndeclined doing him that honour; observing that she never drank more than\r\none glass of wine at dinner, and that she had just taken one with Mr.\r\nPercival. Her manner was well-bred, but haughty in the extreme; and\r\nshe was so passionate, that her anger sometimes conquered even her\r\npoliteness. Her dislike to Clarence Hervey was apparent, even in her\r\nsilence. "If the old gentlewoman has taken an antipathy to me at first\r\nsight, I cannot help it," thought he, and he went on to the beasts. The\r\nboy, who sat next him, had asked some questions about the proboscis of\r\nthe elephant, and Mr. Hervey mentioned Ives\'s account of the elephants\r\nin India, who have been set to watch young children, and who draw them\r\nback gently with their trunks, when they go out of bounds. He talked\r\nnext of the unicorn; and addressing himself to Dr. X---- and Mr.\r\nPercival, he declared that in his opinion Herodotus did not deserve to\r\nbe called the father of lies; he cited the mammoth to prove that\r\nthe apocryphal chapter in the history of beasts should not be\r\ncontemned--that it would in all probability be soon established as true\r\nhistory. The dessert was on the table before Clarence had done with the\r\nmammoth.\r\n\r\nAs the butler put a fine dish of cherries upon the table, he said,\r\n\r\n"My lady, these cherries are a present from the old gardener to Miss\r\nDelacour."\r\n\r\n"Set them before Miss Delacour then," said Lady Anne. "Helena, my dear,\r\ndistribute your own cherries."\r\n\r\nAt the name of Delacour, Clarence Hervey, though his head was still half\r\nfull of the mammoth, looked round in astonishment; and when he saw\r\nthe cherries placed before the young lady, whose resemblance to Lady\r\nDelacour he had before observed, he could not help exclaiming,\r\n\r\n"That young lady then is not a daughter of your ladyship\'s?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I love her as well as if she were," replied Lady Anne.--"What\r\nwere you saying about the mammoth?"\r\n\r\n"That the mammoth is supposed to be------------" but interrupting\r\nhimself, Clarence said in an inquiring tone--"A _niece_ of Lady\r\nDelacour\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Her ladyship\'s _daughter_, sir," said the severe old lady, in a voice\r\nmore terrific than her looks.\r\n\r\n"Shall I give you some strawberries, Mr. Hervey," said lady Anne, "or\r\nwill you let Helena help you to some cherries?"\r\n\r\n"Her ladyship\'s _daughter!_" exclaimed Clarence Hervey in a tone of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Some cherries, sir?" said Helena; but her voice faltered so much, that\r\nshe could hardly utter the words.\r\n\r\nClarence perceived that he had been the cause of her agitation, though\r\nhe knew not precisely by what means; and he now applied himself in\r\nsilence to the picking of his strawberries with great diligence.\r\n\r\nThe ladies soon afterwards withdrew, and as Mr. Percival did not touch\r\nupon the subject again, Clarence forbore to ask any further questions,\r\nthough he was considerably surprised by this sudden discovery. When he\r\nwent into the drawing-room to tea, he found his friend, the stern old\r\nlady, speaking in a high declamatory tone. The words which he heard as\r\nhe came into the room were--\r\n\r\n"If there were no Clarence Herveys, there would be no Lady\r\nDelacours."--Clarence bowed as if he had received a high compliment--the\r\nold lady walked away to an antechamber, fanning herself with great\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Margaret Delacour," said Lady Anne, in a low voice to Hervey,\r\n"is an aunt of Lord Delacour\'s. A woman whose heart is warmer than her\r\ntemper."\r\n\r\n"And that is never cool," said a young lady, who sat next to Lady Anne.\r\n"I call Mrs. Margaret Delacour the volcano; I\'m sure I am never in her\r\ncompany without dreading an eruption. Every now and then out comes with\r\na tremendous noise, fire, smoke, and rubbish."\r\n\r\n"And precious minerals," said Lady Anne, "amongst the rubbish."\r\n\r\n"But the best of it is," continued the young lady, "that she is seldom\r\nin a passion without making a hundred mistakes, for which she is usually\r\nobliged afterwards to ask a thousand pardons."\r\n\r\n"By that account," said Lady Anne, "which I believe to be just, her\r\ncontrition is always ten times as great as her offence."\r\n\r\n"Now you talk of contrition, Lady Anne," said Mr. Hervey, "I should\r\nthink of my own offences: I am very sorry that my indiscreet questions\r\ngave Miss Delacour any pain--my head was so full of the mammoth, that I\r\nblundered on without seeing what I was about till it was too late."\r\n\r\n"Pray, sir," said Mrs. Margaret Delacour, who now returned, and took her\r\nseat upon a sofa, with the solemnity of a person who was going to sit in\r\njudgment upon a criminal, "pray, sir, may I ask how long you have been\r\nacquainted with my Lady Delacour?"\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey took up a book, and with great gravity kissed it, as if\r\nhe had been upon his oath in a court of justice, and answered,\r\n\r\n"To the best of my recollection, madam, it is now four years since I had\r\nfirst the pleasure and honour of seeing Lady Delacour."\r\n\r\n"And in that time, intimately as you have had the pleasure of being\r\nacquainted with her ladyship, you have never discovered that she had a\r\ndaughter?"\r\n\r\n"Never," said Mr. Hervey.\r\n\r\n"There, Lady Anne!--There!" cried Mrs. Delacour, "will you tell me after\r\nthis, that Lady Delacour is not a monster?"\r\n\r\n"Every body says that she\'s a prodigy," said Lady Anne; "and prodigies\r\nand monsters are sometimes thought synonymous terms."\r\n\r\n"Such a mother was never heard of," continued Mrs. Delacour, "since the\r\ndays of Savage and Lady Macclesfield. I am convinced that she _hates_\r\nher daughter. Why she never speaks of her--she never sees her--she never\r\nthinks of her!"\r\n\r\n"Some mothers speak more than they think of their children, and others\r\nthink more than they speak of them," said Lady Anne.\r\n\r\n"I always thought," said Mr. Hervey, "that Lady Delacour was a woman of\r\ngreat sensibility."\r\n\r\n"Sensibility!" exclaimed the indignant old lady, "she has no\r\nsensibility, sir--none--none. She who lives in a constant round of\r\ndissipation, who performs no one duty, who exists only for herself; how\r\ndoes she show her sensibility?--Has she sensibility for her husband--for\r\nher daughter--for any one useful purpose upon earth?--Oh, how I hate the\r\ncambric handkerchief sensibility that is brought out only to weep at a\r\ntragedy!--Yes; Lady Delacour has sensibility enough, I grant ye, when\r\nsensibility is the fashion. I remember well her performing the part of\r\na nurse with vast applause; and I remember, too, the sensibility\r\nshe showed, when the child that she nursed fell a sacrifice to her\r\ndissipation. The second of her children, that she killed--"\r\n\r\n"Killed!--Oh! surely, my dear Mrs. Delacour, that is too strong a word,"\r\nsaid Lady Anne: "you would not make a Medea of Lady Delacour!"\r\n\r\n"It would have been better if I had," cried Mrs. Delacour, "I can\r\nunderstand that there may be such a thing in nature as a jealous wife,\r\nbut an unfeeling mother I cannot comprehend--that passes my powers of\r\nimagination."\r\n\r\n"And mine, so much," said Lady Anne, "that I cannot believe such a being\r\nto exist in the world--notwithstanding all the descriptions I have\r\nheard of it: as you say, my dear Mrs. Delacour, it passes my powers\r\nof imagination. Let us leave it in Mr. Hervey\'s apocryphal chapter of\r\nanimals, and he will excuse us if I never admit it into true history, at\r\nleast without some better evidence than I have yet heard."\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear, dear Lady Anne," cried Mrs. Delacour--"I\'ve made this\r\ncoffee so sweet, there\'s no drinking it--what evidence would you have?"\r\n\r\n"None," said Lady Anne, smiling, "I would have none." "That is to say,\r\nyou will take none," said Mrs. Delacour: "but can any thing be stronger\r\nevidence than her ladyship\'s conduct to _my_ poor Helen--to _your_\r\nHelen, I should say--for you have educated, you have protected her, you\r\nhave been a mother to her. I am an infirm, weak, ignorant, passionate\r\nold woman--I could not have been what you have been to that child--God\r\nbless you!--God will bless you!"\r\n\r\nShe rose as she spoke, to set down her coffee-cup on the table. Clarence\r\nHervey took it from her with a look which said much, and which she was\r\nperfectly capable of understanding.\r\n\r\n"Young man," said she, "it is very unfashionable to treat age and\r\ninfirmity with politeness. I wish that your friend, Lady Delacour,\r\nmay at my time of life meet with as much respect, as she has met\r\nwith admiration and gallantry in her youth. Poor woman, her head has\r\nabsolutely been turned with admiration--and if fame say true, Mr. Hervey\r\nhas had his share in turning that head by his flattery."\r\n\r\n"I am sure her ladyship has turned mine by her charms," said Clarence;\r\n"and I certainly am not to be blamed for admiring what all the world\r\nadmires."\r\n\r\n"I wish," said the old lady, "for her own sake, for the sake of her\r\nfamily, and for the sake of her reputation, that my Lady Delacour had\r\nfewer admirers, and more friends."\r\n\r\n"Women who have met with so many admirers, seldom meet with many\r\nfriends," said Lady Anne.\r\n\r\n"No," said Mrs. Delacour, "for they seldom are wise enough to know their\r\nvalue."\r\n\r\n"We learn the value of all things, but especially of friends, by\r\nexperience," said Lady Anne; "and it is no wonder, therefore, that those\r\nwho have little experience of the pleasures of friendship should not be\r\nwise enough to know their value."\r\n\r\n"This is very good-natured sophistry; but Lady Delacour is too vain ever\r\nto have a friend," said Mrs. Delacour. "My dear Lady Anne, you don\'t\r\nknow her as well as I do--she has more vanity than ever woman had."\r\n\r\n"That is certainly saying a great deal," said Lady Anne; "but then we\r\nmust consider, that Lady Delacour, as an heiress, a beauty, and a wit,\r\nhas a right to a triple share at least."\r\n\r\n"Both her fortune and her beauty are gone; and if she had any wit left,\r\nit is time it should teach her how to conduct herself, I think," said\r\nMrs. Delacour: "but I give her up--I give her up."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Lady Anne, "you must not give her up yet, I have been\r\ninformed, and upon _the best authority_, that Lady Delacour was not\r\nalways the unfeeling, dissipated fine lady that she now appears to be.\r\nThis is only one of the transformations of fashion--the period of her\r\nenchantment will soon be at an end, and she will return to her natural\r\ncharacter. I should not be at all surprised, if Lady Delacour were to\r\nappear at once _la femme comme il y en a pen_."\r\n\r\n"Or _la bonne mere_?" said Mrs. Delacour, sarcastically, "after thus\r\nleaving her daughter----"\r\n\r\n"_Pour bonne bouche_," interrupted Lady Anne, "when she is tired of\r\nthe insipid taste of other pleasures, she will have a higher relish for\r\nthose of domestic life, which will be new and fresh to her."\r\n\r\n"And so you really think, my dear Lady Anne, that my Lady Delacour will\r\nend by being a domestic woman. Well," said Mrs. Margaret, after taking\r\ntwo pinches of snuff, "some people believe in the millennium; but I\r\nconfess I am not one of them--are you, Mr. Hervey?"\r\n\r\n"If it were foretold to me by a good angel," said Clarence, smiling,\r\nas his eye glanced at Lady Anne; "if it were foretold to me by a good\r\nangel, how could I doubt it?"\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of one of Lady\r\nAnne\'s little boys, who came running eagerly up to his mother, to ask\r\nwhether he might have "the sulphurs to show to Helena Delacour. I\r\nwant to show her Vertumnus and Pomona, mamma," said he. "Were not the\r\ncherries that the old gardener sent very good?"\r\n\r\n"What is this about the cherries and the old gardener, Charles?" said\r\nthe young lady who sat beside Lady Anne: "come here and tell me the\r\nwhole story."\r\n\r\n"I will, but I should tell it you a great deal better another time,"\r\nsaid the boy, "because now Helena\'s waiting for Vertumnus and Pomona."\r\n\r\n"Go then to Helena," said Lady Anne, "and I will tell the story for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThen turning to the young lady she began--"Once upon a time there lived\r\nan old gardener at Kensington; and this old gardener had an aloe, which\r\nwas older than himself; for it was very near a hundred years of age, and\r\nit was just going to blossom, and the old gardener calculated how much\r\nhe might make by showing his aloe, when it should be in full blow, to\r\nthe generous public--and he calculated that he might make a 100l.; and\r\nwith this 100l. he determined to do more than was ever done with a 100l.\r\nbefore: but, unluckily, as he was thus reckoning his blossoms before\r\nthey were blown, he chanced to meet with a fair damsel, who ruined all\r\nhis calculations."\r\n\r\n"Ay, Mrs. Stanhope\'s maid, was not it?" interrupted Mrs. Margaret\r\nDelacour. "A pretty damsel she was, and almost as good a politician as\r\nher mistress. Think of that jilt\'s tricking this poor old fellow out of\r\nhis aloe, and--oh, the meanness of Lady Delacour, to accept of that aloe\r\nfor one of her extravagant entertainments!"\r\n\r\n"But I always understood that she paid fifty guineas for it," said Lady\r\nAnne.\r\n\r\n"Whether she did or not," said Mrs. Delacour, "her ladyship and Mrs.\r\nStanhope between them were the ruin of this poor old man. He was taken\r\nin to marry that jade of a waiting-maid; she turned out just as you\r\nmight expect from a pupil of Mrs. Stanhope\'s--the match-making Mrs.\r\nStanhope--you know, sir." (Clarence Hervey changed colour.) "She turned\r\nout," continued Mrs. Delacour, "every thing that was bad--ruined her\r\nhusband--ran away from him--and left him a beggar."\r\n\r\n"Poor man!" said Clarence Hervey.\r\n\r\n"But now," said Lady Anne, "let\'s come to the best part of the\r\nstory--mark how good comes out of evil. If this poor man had not lost\r\nhis aloe and his wife, I probably should never have been acquainted with\r\nMrs. Delacour, or with my little Helena. About the time that the old\r\ngardener was left a beggar, as I happened to be walking one fine evening\r\nin Sloane-street, I met a procession of school-girls--an old man begged\r\nfrom them in a most moving voice; and as they passed, several of the\r\nyoung ladies threw halfpence to him. One little girl, who observed that\r\nthe old man could not stoop without great difficulty, stayed behind\r\nthe rest of her companions, and collected the halfpence which they had\r\nthrown to him, and put them into his hat. He began to tell his story\r\nover again to her, and she stayed so long listening to it, that her\r\ncompanions had turned the corner of the street, and were out of sight.\r\nShe looked about in great distress; and I never shall forget the\r\npathetic voice with which she said, \'Oh! what will become of me? every\r\nbody will be angry with me.\' I assured her that nobody should be angry\r\nwith her, and she gave me her little hand with the utmost innocent\r\nconfidence. I took her home to her schoolmistress, and I was so pleased\r\nwith the beginning of this acquaintance, that I was determined to\r\ncultivate it. One good acquaintance I have heard always leads to\r\nanother. Helena introduced me to her aunt Delacour as her best friend.\r\nMrs. Margaret Delacour has had the goodness to let her little niece\r\nspend the holidays and all her leisure time with me, so that our\r\nacquaintance has grown into friendship. Helena has become quite one of\r\nmy family."\r\n\r\n"And I am sure she has become quite a different creature since she has\r\nbeen so much with you," cried Mrs. Delacour; "her spirits were quite\r\nbroken by her mother\'s neglect of her: young as she is, she has a great\r\ndeal of real sensibility; but as to her mother\'s sensibility--"\r\n\r\nAt the recollection of Lady Delacour\'s neglect of her child, Mrs.\r\nDelacour was going again to launch forth into indignant invective, but\r\nLady Anne stopped her, by whispering--\r\n\r\n"Take care what you say of the mother, for here is the daughter coming,\r\nand she has, indeed, a great deal of real sensibility."\r\n\r\nHelena and her young companions now came into the room, bringing with\r\nthem the sulphurs at which they had been looking.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," said little Charles Percival, "we have brought the sulphurs to\r\nyou, because there are some of them that I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Wonderful!" said Lady Anne; "and what is not quite so wonderful, there\r\nare some of them that I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nThe children spread the sulphurs upon a little table, and all the\r\ncompany gathered round it.\r\n\r\n"Here are all the nine muses for you," said the least of the boys, who\r\nhad taken his seat by Clarence Hervey at dinner; "here are all the muses\r\nfor you, Mr. Hervey: which do you like best?--Oh, that\'s the tragic muse\r\nthat you have chosen!--You don\'t like the tragic better than the comic\r\nmuse, do you?"\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey made no answer, for he was at that instant recollecting\r\nhow Belinda looked in the character of the tragic muse.\r\n\r\n"Has your ladyship ever happened to meet with the young lady who has\r\nspent this winter with Lady Delacour?" said Clarence to Lady Anne.\r\n\r\n"I sat near her one night at the opera," said Lady Anne: "she has a\r\ncharming countenance."\r\n\r\n"Who?--Belinda Portman, do you mean?" said Mrs. Delacour. "I am sure if\r\nI were a young man, I would not trust to the charming countenance of a\r\nyoung lady who is a pupil of Mrs. Stanhope\'s, and a friend of--Helena,\r\nmy dear, shut the door--the most dissipated woman in London."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said Lady Anne, "Miss Portman is in a dangerous situation;\r\nbut some young people learn prudence by being placed in dangerous\r\nsituations, as some young horses, I have heard Mr. Percival say, learn\r\nto be sure-footed, by being left to pick their own way on bad roads."\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Percival, Dr. X----, and some other gentlemen, came up\r\nstairs to tea, and the conversation took another turn. Clarence Hervey\r\nendeavoured to take his share in it with his usual vivacity, but he was\r\nthinking of Belinda Portman, dangerous situations, stumbling horses, &c;\r\nand he made several blunders, which showed his absence of mind.\r\n\r\n"What have you there, Mr. Hervey?" said Dr. X----, looking over his\r\nshoulder--"the tragic muse? This tragic muse seems to rival Lady\r\nDelacour in your admiration."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Clarence, smiling, "you know I was always a votary of the\r\nmuses."\r\n\r\n"And a favoured votary," said Dr. X----. "I wish for the interests of\r\nliterature, that poets may always be lovers, though I cannot say that\r\nI desire lovers should always be poets. But, Mr. Hervey, you must never\r\nmarry, remember," continued Dr. X----, "never--for your true poet must\r\nalways be miserable. You know Petrarch tells us, he would not have been\r\nhappy if he could; he would not have married his mistress if it had been\r\nin his power; because then there would have been an end of his beautiful\r\nsonnets."\r\n\r\n"Every one to his taste," said Clarence; "for my part I have even less\r\nambition to imitate the heroism than hope of being inspired with the\r\npoetic genius of Petrarch. I have no wish to pass whole nights composing\r\nsonnets. I would (am I not right, Mr. Percival?) infinitely rather be a\r\nslave of the ring than a slave of the lamp."\r\n\r\nHere the conversation ended; Clarence took his leave, and Mrs. Margaret\r\nDelacour said, the moment he had left the room, "Quite a different sort\r\nof young man from what I had expected to see!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nADVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mr. Hervey called on Dr. X----, and begged that he\r\nwould accompany him to Lady Delacour\'s.\r\n\r\n"To be introduced to your tragic muse?" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr. Hervey: "I must have your opinion of her before I devote\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"My opinion! but of whom?--Of Lady Delacour?"\r\n\r\n"No; but of a young lady whom you will see with her."\r\n\r\n"Is she handsome?"\r\n\r\n"Beautiful!"\r\n\r\n"And young?"\r\n\r\n"And young."\r\n\r\n"And graceful?"\r\n\r\n"The most graceful person you ever beheld."\r\n\r\n"Young, beautiful, graceful; then the deuce take me," said Dr. X----,\r\n"if I give you my opinion of her: for the odds are, that she has a\r\nthousand faults, at least, to balance these perfections."\r\n\r\n"A thousand faults! a charitable allowance," said Clarence, smiling.\r\n\r\n"There now," said Dr. X----\r\n\r\n    \'Touch him, and no minister\'s so sore.\'\r\n\r\nTo punish you for wincing at my first setting out, I promise you, that\r\nif the lady have a million of faults, each of them high as huge Olympus,\r\nI will see them as with the eye of a flatterer--not of a friend."\r\n\r\n"I defy you to be so good or so bad as your word, doctor," said Hervey.\r\n"You have too much wit to make a good flatterer."\r\n\r\n"And perhaps you think too much to make a good friend," said Dr. X----.\r\n\r\n"Not so," said Clarence: "I would at any time rather be cut by a sharp\r\nknife than by a blunt one. But, my dear doctor, I hope you will not be\r\nprejudiced against Belinda, merely because she is with Lady Delacour;\r\nfor to my certain knowledge, she in not under her ladyship\'s influence.\r\nShe judges and acts for herself, of which I have had an instance."\r\n\r\n"Very possibly!" interrupted Dr. X----. "But before we go any farther,\r\nwill you please to tell me of what Belinda you are talking?"\r\n\r\n"Belinda Portman. I forgot that I had not told you."\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman, a niece of Mrs. Stanhope\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but do not be prejudiced against her on that account," said\r\nClarence, eagerly, "though I was at first myself."\r\n\r\n"Then you will excuse my following your example instead of your\r\nprecepts."\r\n\r\n"No," said Clarence, "for my precepts are far better than my example."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour received Dr. X---- most courteously, and thanked Mr.\r\nHervey for introducing to her a gentleman with whom she had long desired\r\nto converse. Dr. X---- had a great literary reputation, and she saw\r\nthat he was a perfectly well-bred man; consequently she was ambitious\r\nof winning his admiration. She perceived also that he had considerable\r\ninfluence with Clarence Hervey, and this was a sufficient reason to make\r\nher wish for his good opinion. Belinda was particularly pleased with his\r\nmanners and conversation; she saw that he paid her much attention, and\r\nshe was desirous that he should think favourably of her; but she had\r\nthe good sense and good taste to avoid a display of her abilities and\r\naccomplishments. A sensible man, who has any knowledge of the world and\r\ntalents for conversation, can easily draw out the knowledge of those\r\nwith whom he converses. Dr. X---- possessed this power in a superior\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n"Well," cried Clarence, when their visit was over, "what is your opinion\r\nof Lady Delacour?"\r\n\r\n"I am \'blasted with excess of light,\'" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Her ladyship is certainly very brilliant," said Clarence, "but I hope\r\nthat Miss Portman did not overpower you."\r\n\r\n"No--I turned my eyes from Lady Delacour upon Miss Portman, as a painter\r\nturns his eyes upon mild green, to rest them, when they have been\r\ndazzled by glaring colours.\r\n\r\n   \'She yields her charms of mind with sweet delay.\'"\r\n\r\n"I was afraid," said Hervey, "that you might think her manners too\r\nreserved and cold: they are certainly become more so than they used to\r\nbe. But so much the better; by and by we shall find beautiful flowers\r\nspring up from beneath the snow.\'"\r\n\r\n"A very poetical hope," said Dr. X----; "but in judging of the human\r\ncharacter, we must not entirely trust to analogies and allusions taken\r\nfrom the vegetable creation."\r\n\r\n"What!" cried Clarence Hervey, looking eagerly in the doctor\'s eyes,\r\n"what do you mean? I am afraid you do not approve of Belinda."\r\n\r\n"Your fears are almost as precipitate as your hopes, my good sir: but to\r\nput you out of pain, I will tell you, that I approve of all I have seen\r\nof this young lady, but that it is absolutely out of my power to form a\r\ndecisive judgment of a woman\'s temper and character in the course of a\r\nsingle morning visit. Women, you know, as well as men, often speak with\r\none species of enthusiasm, and act with another. I must see your Belinda\r\nact, I must study her, before I can give you my final judgment. Lady\r\nDelacour has honoured me with her commands to go to her as often as\r\npossible. For your sake, my dear Hervey, I shall obey her ladyship most\r\npunctually, that I may have frequent opportunities of seeing your Miss\r\nPortman."\r\n\r\nClarence expressed his gratitude with much energy, for this instance\r\nof the doctor\'s friendship. Belinda, who had been entertained by Dr.\r\nX----\'s conversation during this first visit, was more and more\r\ndelighted with his company as she became more acquainted with his\r\nunderstanding and character. She felt that he unfolded her powers, and\r\nthat with the greatest politeness and address he raised her confidence\r\nin herself, without ever descending to flattery. By degrees she\r\nlearned to look upon him as a friend; she imparted to him with great\r\ningenuousness her opinions on various subjects, and she was both amused\r\nand instructed by his observations on the characters and manners of the\r\ncompany who frequented Lady Delacour\'s assemblies. She did not judge of\r\nthe doctor\'s sincerity merely by the kindness he showed her, but by his\r\nconduct towards others.\r\n\r\nOne night, at a select party at Lady Delacour\'s, a Spanish gentleman\r\nwas amusing the company with some anecdotes, to prove the extraordinary\r\npassion which some of his countrymen formerly showed for the game of\r\nchess. He mentioned families, in which unfinished games, bequeathed by\r\nwill, had descended from father to son, and where victory was doubtful\r\nfor upwards of a century.\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey observed, that gaining a battle was, at that time, so common\r\nto the court of Spain, that a victory at chess seemed to confer more\r\n_eclat_; for that an abbe, by losing adroitly a game at chess to the\r\nSpanish minister, obtained a cardinal\'s hat.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner was flattered by the manner in which Hervey introduced\r\nthis slight circumstance, and he directed to him his conversation,\r\nspeaking in French and Italian successively; he was sufficiently skilled\r\nin both languages, but Clarence spoke them better. Till he appeared,\r\nthe foreigner was the principal object of attention, but he was soon\r\neclipsed by Mr. Hervey. Nothing amusing or instructive that could be\r\nsaid upon the game of chess escaped him, and the literary ground, which\r\nthe slow Don would have taken some hours to go regularly over, our\r\nhero traversed in a few minutes. From Twiss to Vida, from Irwin to Sir\r\nWilliam Jones, from Spain to India, he passed with admirable celerity,\r\nand seized all that could adorn his course from Indian Antiquities or\r\nAsiatic Researches.\r\n\r\nBy this display of knowledge he surprised even his friend Dr. X----.\r\nThe ladies admired his taste as a poet, the gentlemen his accuracy as a\r\ncritic; Lady Delacour loudly applauded, and Belinda silently approved.\r\nClarence was elated. The Spanish gentleman, to whom he had just quoted\r\na case in point from Vida\'s Scacchia, asked him if he were as perfect\r\nin the practice as in the theory of the game. Clarence was too proud of\r\nexcelling in every thing to decline the Spaniard\'s challenge. They sat\r\ndown to chess. Lady Delacour, as they ranged the pieces on the board,\r\ncried, "Whoever wins shall be my knight; and a silver chess-man shall be\r\nhis prize. Was it not Queen Elizabeth who gave a silver chess-man to one\r\nof her courtiers as a mark of her royal favour? I am ashamed to imitate\r\nsuch a pedantic coquet--but since I have said it, how can I retract?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible! impossible!" cried Clarence Hervey: "a silver chess-man be\r\nour prize; and if I win it, like the gallant Raleigh, I will wear it in\r\nmy cap; and what proud Essex shall dare to challenge it?"\r\n\r\nThe combat now began--the spectators were silent. Clarence made an error\r\nin his first move, for his attention was distracted by seeing Belinda\r\nbehind his adversary\'s chair. The Spaniard was deceived by this mistake\r\ninto a contemptuous opinion of his opponent--Belinda changed her\r\nplace--Clarence recovered his presence of mind, and convinced him that\r\nhe was not a man to be despised. The combat was long doubtful, but at\r\nlength to the surprise of all present, Clarence Hervey was victorious.\r\n\r\nExulting in his success, he looked round for Lady Delacour, from whom he\r\nexpected the honours of his triumph. She had left the room, but soon she\r\nreturned, dressed in the character of Queen Elizabeth, in which she had\r\nonce appeared at a masquerade, with a large ruff, and all the costume of\r\nthe times.\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey, throwing himself at her feet, addressed her in that\r\nhigh-flown style which her majesty was wont to hear from the gallant\r\nRaleigh, or the accomplished Essex.\r\n\r\nSoon the coquetry of the queen entirely conquered her prudery; and\r\nthe favoured courtier, evidently elated by his situation, was as\r\nenthusiastic as her majesty\'s most insatiable vanity could desire. The\r\ncharacters were well supported; both the actor and actress were\r\nhighly animated, and seemed so fully possessed by their parts as to\r\nbe insensible to the comments that were made upon the scene. Clarence\r\nHervey was first recalled to himself by the deep blush which he saw on\r\nBelinda\'s cheek, when Queen Elizabeth addressed her as one of her maids\r\nof honour, of whom she affected to be jealous. He was conscious that he\r\nhad been hurried by the enthusiasm of the moment farther than he either\r\nwished or intended. It was difficult to recede, when her majesty seemed\r\ndisposed to advance; but Sir Walter Raleigh, with much presence of mind,\r\nturned to the foreigner, whom he accosted as the Spanish ambassador.\r\n\r\n"Your excellency sees," said he, "how this great queen turns the heads\r\nof her faithful subjects, and afterwards has the art of paying them\r\nwith nothing but words. Has the new world afforded you any coin half so\r\nvaluable?"\r\n\r\nThe Spanish gentleman\'s grave replies to this playful question gave\r\na new turn to the conversation, and relieved Clarence Hervey from his\r\nembarrassment. Lady Delacour, though still in high spirits, was easily\r\ndiverted to other objects. She took the Spaniard with her to the\r\nnext room, to show him a picture of Mary, Queen of Scots. The company\r\nfollowed her--Clarence Hervey remained with Dr. X---- and Belinda, who\r\nhad just asked the doctor, to teach her the moves at chess.\r\n\r\n"Lady Delacour has charming spirits," said Clarence Hervey; "they\r\ninspire every body with gaiety."\r\n\r\n"Every body! they incline me more to melancholy than mirth," said Dr.\r\nX----. "These high spirits do not seem quite natural. The vivacity of\r\nyouth and of health, Miss Portman, always charms me; but this gaiety of\r\nLady Delacour\'s does not appear to me that of a sound mind in a sound\r\nbody."\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s penetration went so near the truth, that Belinda, afraid\r\nof betraying her friend\'s secrets, never raised her eyes from the\r\nchess-board whilst he spoke, but went on setting up the fallen castles,\r\nand bishops, and kings, with expeditious diligence.\r\n\r\n"You are putting the bishop into the place of the knight," said\r\nClarence.\r\n\r\n"Lady Delacour," continued the doctor, "seems to be in a perpetual\r\nfever, either of mind or body--I cannot tell which--and as a\r\nprofessional man, I really have some curiosity to determine the\r\nquestion. If I could feel her pulse, I could instantly decide; but I\r\nhave heard her say that she has a horror against having her pulse felt,\r\nand a lady\'s horror is invincible, by reason--"\r\n\r\n"But not by address," said Clarence. "I can tell you a method of\r\ncounting her pulse, without her knowing it, without her seeing you,\r\nwithout your seeing her."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Dr. X----, smiling; "that may be a useful secret in my\r\nprofession; pray impart it to me--you who excel in every thing."\r\n\r\n"Are you in earnest, Mr. Hervey?" said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Perfectly in earnest--my secret is quite simple. Look through the door\r\nat the shadow of Queen Elizabeth\'s ruff--observe how it vibrates; the\r\nmotion as well as the figure is magnified in the shadow. Cannot you\r\ncount every pulsation distinctly?"\r\n\r\n"I can," said Dr. X----, "and I give you credit for making an ingenious\r\nuse of a trifling observation." The doctor paused and looked round.\r\n"Those people cannot hear what we are saying, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Belinda, "they are intent upon themselves." Doctor\r\nX----fixed his eyes mildly upon Clarence Hervey, and exclaimed in an\r\nearnest friendly tone--"What a pity, Mr. Hervey, that a young man\r\nof your talents and acquirements, a man who might be any thing,\r\nshould--pardon the expression--choose to be--nothing; should waste upon\r\npetty objects powers suited to the greatest; should lend his soul\r\nto every contest for frivolous superiority, when the same energy\r\nconcentrated might ensure honourable pre-eminence among the first men\r\nin his country. Shall he who might not only distinguish himself in any\r\nscience or situation, who might not only acquire personal fame, but,\r\noh, far more noble motive! who might be permanently useful to his\r\nfellow-creatures, content himself with being the evanescent amusement\r\nof a drawing-room?--Shall one, who might be great in public, or happy\r\nin private life, waste in this deplorable manner the best years of his\r\nexistence--time that can never be recalled?--This is declamation!--No:\r\nit is truth put into the strongest language that I have power to use, in\r\nthe hope of making some impression: I speak from my heart, for I have a\r\nsincere regard for you, Mr. Hervey, and if I have been impertinent, you\r\nmust forgive me."\r\n\r\n"Forgive you!" cried Clarence Hervey, taking Dr. X---- by the hand, "I\r\nthink you a real friend; you shall have the best thanks not in words,\r\nbut in actions: you have roused my ambition, and I will pursue noble\r\nends by noble means. A few years have been sacrificed; but the lessons\r\nthat they have taught me remain. I cannot, presumptuous as I am,\r\nflatter myself that my exertions can be of any material utility to my\r\nfellow-creatures, but what I can do I will, my excellent friend! If I be\r\nhereafter either successful in public, or happy in private life, it is\r\nto you I shall owe it."\r\n\r\nBelinda was touched by the candour and good sense with which Clarence\r\nHervey spoke. His character appeared in a new light: she was proud of\r\nher own judgment, in having discerned his merit, and for a moment she\r\npermitted herself to feel "unreproved pleasure in his company."\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Sir Philip Baddely and Mr. Rochfort called at Lady\r\nDelacour\'s--Mr. Hervey was present--her ladyship was summoned to Mrs.\r\nFranks, and Belinda was left with these gentlemen.\r\n\r\n"Why, damme, Clary! you have been a lost man," cried Sir Philip, "ever\r\nsince you were drowned. Damme, why did not you come to dine with us\r\nthat day, now I recollect it? We were all famously merry; but for your\r\ncomfort, Clarence, we missed you cursedly, and were damned sorry you\r\never took that unlucky jump into the Serpentine river--damned sorry,\r\nwere not we, Rochfort?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Clarence, in an ironical tone, "you need no vouchers to\r\nconvince me of the reality of your sorrow. You know I can never forget\r\nyour jumping so courageously into the river, to save the life of your\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\n"Oh, pooh! damn it," said Sir Philip, "what signifies who pulled you\r\nout, now you are safe and sound? By-the-bye, Clary, did you ever quiz\r\nthat doctor, as I desired you? No, that I\'m sure you didn\'t; but I think\r\nhe has made a quiz of you: for, damme, I believe you have taken such a\r\nfancy to the old quizzical fellow, that you can\'t live without him. Miss\r\nPortman, don\'t you admire Hervey\'s taste?"\r\n\r\n"In this instance I certainly do admire Mr. Hervey\'s taste," said\r\nBelinda, "for the best of all possible reasons, because it entirely\r\nagrees with my own."\r\n\r\n"Very extraordinary, faith," said Sir Philip.\r\n\r\n"And what the devil can you find to like in him, Clary?" continued Mr.\r\nRochfort, "for one wouldn\'t be so rude to put that question to a lady.\r\nLadies, you know, are never to be questioned about their likings and\r\ndislikings. Some have pet dogs, some have pet cats: then why not a _pet\r\nquiz?_"\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! ha! that\'s a good one, Rochfort--a pet quiz!--Ha! ha! ha! Dr.\r\nX---- shall be Miss Portman\'s pet quiz. Put it about, put it about,\r\nRochfort," continued the witty baronet, and he and his facetious\r\ncompanion continued to laugh as long as they possibly could at this\r\nhappy hit.\r\n\r\nBelinda, without being in the least discomposed by their insolent folly,\r\nas soon as they had finished laughing, very coolly observed, that she\r\ncould have no objection to give her reasons for preferring Dr. X----\'s\r\ncompany but for fear they might give offence to Sir Philip and his\r\nfriends. She then defended the doctor with so much firmness, and yet\r\nwith so much propriety, that Clarence Hervey was absolutely enchanted\r\nwith her, and with his own penetration in having discovered her real\r\ncharacter, notwithstanding her being Mrs. Stanhope\'s niece.\r\n\r\n"I never argue, for my part," cried Mr. Rochfort: "\'pon honour, \'tis a\r\ndeal too much trouble. A lady, a handsome lady, I mean, is always in the\r\nright with me."\r\n\r\n"But as to you, Hervey," said Sir Philip, "damme, do you know, my boy,\r\nthat our club has come to a determination to black-ball you, if you keep\r\ncompany with this famous doctor?"\r\n\r\n"Your club, Sir Philip, will do me honour by such an ostracism."\r\n\r\n"Ostracism!" repeated Sir Philip.--"In plain English, does that mean\r\nthat you choose to be black-balled by us? Why, damn it, Clary, you\'ll\r\nbe nobody. But follow your own genius--damn me, if I take it upon me to\r\nunderstand your men of genius--they are in the Serpentine river one day,\r\nand in the clouds the next: so fare ye well, Clary. I expect to see you\r\na doctor of physic, or a methodist parson, soon, damn me if I don\'t:\r\nso fare ye well, Clary. Is black-ball your last word? or will you think\r\nbetter on\'t, and give up the doctor?"\r\n\r\n"I can never give up Dr. X----\'s friendship--I would sooner be\r\nblack-balled by every club in London. The good lesson you gave me, Sir\r\nPhilip, the day I was fool enough to jump into the Serpentine river, has\r\nmade me wiser for life. I know, for I have felt, the difference between\r\nreal friends and fashionable acquaintance. Give up Dr. X----! Never!\r\nnever!"\r\n\r\n"Then fare you well, Clary," said Sir Philip, "you\'re no longer one of\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Then fare ye well, Clary, you\'re no longer the man for me," said\r\nRochfort.\r\n\r\n"_Tant pis_, and _tant mieux_" said Clarence, and so they parted.\r\n\r\nAs they left the room, Clarence Hervey involuntarily turned to Belinda,\r\nand he thought that he read in her ingenuous, animated countenance, full\r\napprobation of his conduct.\r\n\r\n"Hist! are they gone? quite gone?" said Lady Delacour, entering the room\r\nfrom an adjoining apartment; "they have stayed an unconscionable time.\r\nHow much I am obliged to Mrs. Franks for detaining me! I have escaped\r\ntheir vapid impertinence; and in truth, this morning I have such a\r\nmultiplicity of business, that I have scarcely a moment even for wit\r\nand Clarence Hervey. Belinda, my dear, will you have the charity to look\r\nover some of these letters for me, which, as Marriott tells me, have\r\nbeen lying in my writing-table this week--expecting, most unreasonably,\r\nthat I should have the grace to open them? We are always punished for\r\nour indolence, as your friend Dr. X---- said the other day: if we suffer\r\nbusiness to accumulate, it drifts with every ill wind like snow, till\r\nat last an avalanche of it comes down at once, and quite overwhelms us.\r\nExcuse me, Clarence," continued her ladyship, as she opened her letters,\r\n"this is very rude: but I know I have secured my pardon from you by\r\nremembering your friend\'s wit--wisdom, I should say: how seldom are\r\nwit and wisdom joined! They might have been joined in Lady Delacour,\r\nperhaps--there\'s vanity!--if she had early met with such a friend as Dr.\r\nX----; but it\'s too late now," said she, with a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey heard it, and it made a great impression upon his\r\nbenevolent imagination. "Why too late?" said he to himself. "Mrs.\r\nMargaret Delacour is mistaken, if she thinks this woman wants\r\nsensibility."\r\n\r\n"What have you got there, Miss Portman?" said Lady Delacour, taking from\r\nBelinda\'s hand one of the letters which she had begged her to look\r\nover: "something wondrous pathetic, I should guess, by your countenance.\r\n\'_Helena Delacour_.\' Oh! read it to yourself, my dear--a school-girl\'s\r\nletter is a thing I abominate--I make it a rule never to read Helena\'s\r\nepistles."\r\n\r\n"Let me prevail upon your ladyship to make an exception to the general\r\nrule then," said Belinda; "I can assure you this is not a common\r\nschool-girl\'s letter: Miss Delacour seems to inherit her mother\'s\r\n\'_eloquence de billet_.\'"\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman seems to possess, by inheritance, by instinct, by magic,\r\nor otherwise, powers of persuasion, which no one can resist. There\'s\r\ncompliment for compliment, my dear. Is there any thing half so well\r\nturned in Helena\'s letter? Really, \'tis vastly well," continued her\r\nladyship, as she read the letter: "where did the little gipsy learn to\r\nwrite so charmingly? I protest I should like of all things to have her\r\nat home with me this summer--the 21st of June--well, after the birthday,\r\nI shall have time to think about it. But then, we shall be going out of\r\ntown, and at Harrowgate I should not know what to do with her; she had\r\nbetter, much better, go to her humdrum Aunt Margaret\'s, as she always\r\ndoes--she is a fixture in Grosvenor-square. These stationary good\r\npeople, these zoophite friends, are sometimes very convenient; and Mrs.\r\nMargaret Delacour is the most unexceptionable zoophite in the creation.\r\nShe has, it is true, an antipathy to me, because I\'m of such a different\r\nnature from herself; but then her antipathy does not extend to my\r\noffspring: she is kind beyond measure to Helena, on purpose, I believe,\r\nto provoke me. Now I provoke her in my turn, by never being provoked,\r\nand she saves me a vast deal of trouble, for which she is overpaid by\r\nthe pleasure of abusing me. This is the way of the world, Clarence.\r\nDon\'t look so serious--you are not come yet to daughters and sons, and\r\nschools and holidays, and all the evils of domestic life."\r\n\r\n"Evils!" repeated Clarence Hervey, in a tone which surprised her\r\nladyship. She looked immediately with a significant smile at Belinda.\r\n"Why do not you echo _evils_, Miss Portman?"\r\n\r\n"Pray, Lady Delacour," interrupted Clarence Hervey, "when do you go to\r\nHarrowgate?"\r\n\r\n"What a sudden transition!" said Lady Delacour. "What association of\r\nideas could just at that instant take you to Harrowgate? When do I go to\r\nHarrowgate? Immediately after the birthday, I believe we shall--I advise\r\nyou to be of the party."\r\n\r\n"Your ladyship does me a great deal of honour," said Hervey: "I shall,\r\nif it be possible, do myself the honour of attending you."\r\n\r\nAnd soon after this arrangement was made, Mr. Hervey took his leave.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, are you still poring over that letter of Helena\'s?" said\r\nLady Delacour to Miss Portman.\r\n\r\n"I fancy your ladyship did not quite finish it," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"No; I saw something about the Leverian Museum, and a swallow\'s nest in\r\na pair of garden-shears; and I was afraid I was to have a catalogue of\r\ncuriosities, for which I have little taste and less time."\r\n\r\n"You did not see, then, what Miss Delacour says of the lady who took her\r\nto that Museum?"\r\n\r\n"Not I. What lady? her Aunt Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"No; Mrs. Margaret Delacour, she says, has been so ill for some time\r\npast, that she goes no where but to Lady Anne Percival\'s."\r\n\r\n"Poor woman," said Lady Delacour, "she will die soon, and then I shall\r\nhave Helena upon my hands, unless some other kind friend takes a fancy\r\nto her. Who is this lady that has carried her to the Leverian Museum?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Anne Percival; of whom she speaks with so much gratitude and\r\naffection, that I quite long----"\r\n\r\n"Lord bless me!" interrupted Lady Delacour, "Lady Anne Percival! Helena\r\nhas mentioned this Lady Anne Percival to me before, I recollect, in some\r\nof her letters."\r\n\r\n"Then you did read some of her letters?"\r\n\r\n"Half!--I never read more than half, upon my word," said Lady Delacour,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"Why will you delight in making yourself appear less good than you are,\r\nmy dear Lady Delacour?" said Belinda, taking her hand.\r\n\r\n"Because I hate to be like other people," said her ladyship, "who\r\ndelight in making themselves appear better than they are. But I was\r\ngoing to tell you, that I do believe I did provoke Percival by marrying\r\nLord Delacour: I cannot tell you how much this Mea delights me--I am\r\nsure that the man has a lively remembrance of me, or else he would never\r\nmake his wife take so much notice of my daughter."\r\n\r\n"Surely, your ladyship does not think," said Belinda, "that a wife is a\r\nbeing whose actions are necessarily governed by a husband."\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily--but accidentally. When a lady accidentally sets up for\r\nbeing a good wife, she must of course love, honour, and obey. Now, you\r\nunderstand, I am not in the least obliged to Lady Anne for her kindness\r\nto Helena, because it all goes under the head of obedience, in my\r\nimagination; and her ladyship is paid for it by an accession of\r\ncharacter: she has the reward of having it said, \'Oh, Lady Anne Percival\r\nis the best wife in the world!\'--\'Oh, Lady Anne Percival is quite a\r\npattern woman!\' I hate pattern women. I hope I may never see Lady\r\nAnne; for I\'m sure I should detest her beyond all things living--Mrs.\r\nLuttridge not excepted."\r\n\r\nBelinda was surprised and shocked at the malignant vehemence with which\r\nher ladyship uttered these words; it was in vain, however, that she\r\nremonstrated on the injustice of predetermining to detest Lady Anne,\r\nmerely because she had shown kindness to Helena, and because she bore a\r\nhigh character. Lady Delacour was a woman who never listened to reason,\r\nor who listened to it only that she might parry it by wit. Upon this\r\noccasion, her wit had not its usual effect upon Miss Portman; instead of\r\nentertaining, it disgusted her.\r\n\r\n"You have called me your friend, Lady Delacour," said she; "I should but\r\nill deserve that name, if I had not the courage to speak the truth to\r\nyou--if I had not the courage to tell you when I think you are wrong."\r\n\r\n"But I have not the courage to hear you, my dear," said Lady Delacour,\r\nstopping her ears. "So your conscience may be at ease; you may suppose\r\nthat you have said every thing that is wise, and good, and proper, and\r\nsublime, and that you deserve to be called the best of friends; you\r\nshall enjoy the office of censor to Lady Delacour, and welcome; but\r\nremember, it is a sinecure place, though I will pay you with my love and\r\nesteem to any extent you please. You sigh--for my folly. Alas! my dear,\r\n\'tis hardly worth while--my follies will soon be at an end. Of what use\r\ncould even the wisdom of Solomon be to me now? If you have any humanity,\r\nyou will not force me to reflect: whilst I yet live, I must _keep it\r\nup_ with incessant dissipation--the teetotum keeps upright only while it\r\nspins: so let us talk of the birthnight, or the new play that we are to\r\nsee to-night, or the ridiculous figure Lady H---- made at the concert;\r\nor let us talk of Harrowgate, or what you will."\r\n\r\nPity succeeded to disgust and displeasure in Belinda\'s mind, and she\r\ncould hardly refrain from tears, whilst she saw this unhappy creature,\r\nwith forced smiles, endeavour to hide the real anguish of her soul: she\r\ncould only say, "But, my dear Lady Delacour, do not you think that your\r\nlittle Helena, who seems to have a most affectionate disposition, would\r\nadd to your happiness at home?"\r\n\r\n"Her affectionate disposition can be nothing to me," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\nBelinda felt a hot tear drop upon her hand, which lay upon Lady\r\nDelacour\'s lap.\r\n\r\n"Can you wonder," continued her ladyship, hastily wiping away the tear\r\nwhich she had let fall; "can you wonder that I should talk of detesting\r\nLady Anne Percival? You see she has robbed me of the affections of my\r\nchild. Helena asks to come home: yes, but how does she ask it? Coldly,\r\nformally,--as a duty. But look at the end of her letter; I have read\r\nit all--every bitter word of it I have tasted. How differently she\r\nwrites--look even at the flowing hand--the moment she begins to speak of\r\nLady Anne Percival; then her soul breaks out: \'Lady Anne has offered\r\nto take her to Oakly-park--she should be extremely happy to go, if I\r\nplease.\' Yes, let her go; let her go as far from me as possible; let her\r\nnever, never see her wretched mother more!--Write," said Lady Delacour,\r\nturning hastily to Belinda, "write in my name, and tell her to go to\r\nOakly-park, and to be happy."\r\n\r\n"But why should you take it for granted that she cannot be happy with\r\nyou?" said Belinda. "Let us see her--let us try the experiment."\r\n\r\n"No," said Lady Delacour; "no--it is too late: I will never condescend\r\nin my last moments to beg for that affection to which it may be thought\r\nI have forfeited my natural claim."\r\n\r\nPride, anger, and sorrow, struggled in her countenance as she spoke. She\r\nturned her face from Belinda, and walked out of the room with dignity.\r\n\r\nNothing remains for me to do, thought Belinda, but to sooth this haughty\r\nspirit: all other hope, I see, is vain.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Clarence Hervey, who had no suspicion that the gay,\r\nbrilliant Lady Delacour was sinking into the grave, had formed a design\r\nworthy of his ardent and benevolent character. The manner in which her\r\nladyship had spoken of his friend Dr. X----, the sigh which she gave\r\nat the reflection that she might have been a very different character\r\nif she had early had a sensible friend, made a great impression upon Mr.\r\nHervey. Till then, he had merely considered her ladyship as an object\r\nof amusement, and an introduction to high life; but he now felt so much\r\ninterested for her, that he determined to exert all his influence to\r\npromote her happiness. He knew _that_ influence to be considerable: not\r\nthat he was either coxcomb or dupe enough to imagine that Lady Delacour\r\nwas in love with him; he was perfectly sensible that her only wish was\r\nto obtain his admiration, and he resolved to show her that it could no\r\nlonger be secured without deserving his esteem. Clarence Hervey was\r\na thoroughly generous young man: capable of making the greatest\r\nsacrifices, when encouraged by the hope of doing good, he determined\r\nto postpone the declaration of his attachment to Belinda, that he might\r\ndevote himself entirely to his new project. His plan was to wean Lady\r\nDelacour by degrees from dissipation, by attaching her to her daughter,\r\nand to Lady Anne Percival. He was sanguine in all his hopes, and rapid,\r\nbut not unthinking, in all his decisions. From Lady Delacour he went\r\nimmediately to Dr. X----, to whom he communicated his designs.\r\n\r\n"I applaud your benevolent intentions," said the doctor: "but have\r\nyou really the presumption to hope, that an ingenuous young man of\r\nfour-and-twenty can reform a veteran coquet of four-and-thirty?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Delacour is not yet thirty," said Clarence; "but the older she\r\nis, the better the chance of her giving up a losing game. She has an\r\nadmirable understanding, and she will soon--I mean as soon as she is\r\nacquainted with Lady Anne Percival--discover that she has mistaken\r\nthe road to happiness. All the difficulty will be to make them fairly\r\nacquainted with each other; for this, my dear doctor, I must trust to\r\nyou. Do you prepare Lady Anne to tolerate Lady Delacour\'s faults, and I\r\nwill prepare Lady Delacour to tolerate Lady Anne\'s virtues."\r\n\r\n"You have generously taken the more difficult task of the two," replied\r\nDr. X----. "Well, we shall see what can be done. After the birthday,\r\nLady Delacour talks of going to Harrowgate: you know, Oakly-park is\r\nnot far from Harrowgate, so they will have frequent opportunities of\r\nmeeting. But, take my word for it, nothing can be done till after\r\nthe birthday; for Lady Delacour\'s head is at present full of crape\r\npetticoats, and horses, and carriages, and a certain Mrs. Luttridge,\r\nwhom she hates with a hatred passing that of women."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS BOUDOIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccustomed to study human nature, Dr. X---- had acquired peculiar\r\nsagacity in judging of character. Notwithstanding the address with which\r\nLady Delacour concealed the real motives for her apparently thoughtless\r\nconduct, he quickly discovered that the hatred of Mrs. Luttridge was her\r\nruling passion. Above nine years of continual warfare had exasperated\r\nthe tempers of both parties, and no opportunities of manifesting their\r\nmutual antipathy were ever neglected. Extravagantly as Lady Delacour\r\nloved admiration, the highest possible degree of positive praise was\r\ninsipid to her taste, if it did not imply some superiority over the\r\nwoman whom she considered as a perpetual rival.\r\n\r\nNow it had been said by the coachmaker, that Mrs. Luttridge would sport\r\na most elegant new vis-a-vis on the king\'s birthday. Lady Delacour\r\nwas immediately ambitious to outshine her in equipage; and it was this\r\npaltry ambition that made her condescend to all the meanness of the\r\ntransaction by which she obtained Miss Portman\'s draft, and Clarence\r\nHervey\'s two hundred guineas. The great, the important day, at length\r\narrived--her ladyship\'s triumph in the morning at the drawing-room\r\nwas complete. Mrs. Luttridge\'s dress, Mrs. Luttridge\'s vis-a-vis, Mrs.\r\nLuttridge\'s horses were nothing, absolutely nothing, in comparison with\r\nLady Delacour\'s: her ladyship enjoyed the full exultation of vanity; and\r\nat night she went in high spirits to the ball.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dearest Belinda," said she, as she left her dressing-room, "how\r\nterrible a thing it is that you cannot go with me!--None of the joys of\r\nthis life are without alloy!--\'Twould be too much to see in one night\r\nMrs. Luttridge\'s mortification, and my Belinda\'s triumph. Adieu!\r\nmy love: we shall live to see another birthday, it is to be hoped.\r\nMarriott, my drops. Oh, I have taken them."\r\n\r\nBelinda, after her ladyship\'s departure, retired to the library. Her\r\ntime passed so agreeably during Lady Delacour\'s absence, that she was\r\nsurprised when she heard the clock strike twelve.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible," thought she, "that I have spent two hours by myself\r\nin a library without being tired of my existence?--How different are my\r\nfeelings now from what they would have been in the same circumstances\r\nsix months ago!--I should then have thought the loss of a birthnight\r\nball a mighty trial of temper. It is singular, that my having spent\r\na winter with one of the most dissipated women in England should have\r\nsobered my mind so completely. If I had never seen the utmost extent\r\nof the pleasures of the world, as they are called, my imagination might\r\nhave misled me to the end of my life; but now I can judge from my own\r\nexperience, and I am convinced that the life of a fine lady would never\r\nmake me happy. Dr. X---- told me, the other day, that he thinks me\r\nformed for something better, and he is incapable of flattery."\r\n\r\nThe idea of Clarence Hervey was so intimately connected with that of his\r\nfriend, that Miss Portman could seldom separate them in her imagination;\r\nand she was just beginning to reflect upon the manner in which Clarence\r\nlooked, whilst he declared to Sir Philip Baddely, that he would never\r\ngive up Dr. X----, when she was startled by the entrance of Marriott.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Portman, what shall we do? what shall we do?-My lady! my poor\r\nlady!" cried she.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"The horses--the young horses!--Oh, I wish my lady had never seen them.\r\nOh, my lady, my poor lady, what will become of her?"\r\n\r\nIt was some minutes before Belinda could obtain from Marriott any\r\nintelligible account of what had happened.\r\n\r\n"All I know, ma\'am, is what James has just told me," said Marriott. "My\r\nlady gave the coachman orders upon no account to let Mrs. Luttridge\'s\r\ncarriage get before hers. Mrs. Luttridge\'s coachman would not give up\r\nthe point either. My lady\'s horses were young and ill broke, they tell\r\nme, and there was no managing of them no ways. The carriages got somehow\r\nacross one another, and my lady was overturned, and all smashed to\r\natoms. Oh, ma\'am," continued Marriott, "if it had not been for Mr.\r\nHervey, they say, my lady would never have been got out of the crowd\r\nalive. He\'s bringing her home in his own carriage, God bless him!"\r\n\r\n"But is Lady Delacour hurt?" cried Belinda.\r\n\r\n"She _must_,--to be sure, she must, ma\'am," cried Marriott, putting her\r\nhand upon her bosom. "But let her be ever so much hurt, my lady will\r\nkeep it to herself: the footmen swear she did not give a scream, not a\r\nsingle scream; so it\'s their opinion she was no ways hurt--but that,\r\nI know, can\'t be--and, indeed, they are thinking so much about the\r\ncarriage, that they can\'t give one any rational account of any thing;\r\nand, as for myself, I\'m sure I\'m in such a flutter. Lord knows, I\r\nadvised my lady not to go with the young horses, no later than--"\r\n\r\n"Hark!" cried Belinda, "here they are." She ran down stairs instantly.\r\nThe first object that she saw was Lady Delacour in convulsions--the\r\nstreet-door was open--the hall was crowded with servants. Belinda made\r\nher way through them, and, in a calm voice, requested that Lady Delacour\r\nmight immediately be brought to her own dressing-room, and that she\r\nshould there be left to Marriott\'s care and hers. Mr. Hervey assisted in\r\ncarrying Lady Delacour--she came to her senses as they were taking her\r\nup stairs. "Set me down, set me down," she exclaimed: "I am not hurt--I\r\nam quite well,--Where\'s Marriott? Where\'s Miss Portman?"\r\n\r\n"Here we are--you shall be carried quite safely--trust to me," said\r\nBelinda, in a firm tone, "and do not struggle."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour submitted: she was in agonizing pain, but her fortitude\r\nwas so great that she never uttered a groan. It was the constraint which\r\nshe had put upon herself, by endeavouring not to scream, which threw her\r\ninto convulsions. "She is hurt--I am sure she is hurt, though she will\r\nnot acknowledge it," cried Clarence Hervey. "My ankle is sprained,\r\nthat\'s all," said Lady Delacour--"lay me on this sofa, and leave me to\r\nBelinda."\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this?" cried Lord Delacour, staggering into the room: he was\r\nmuch intoxicated, and in this condition had just come home, as they were\r\ncarrying Lady Delacour up stairs: he could not be made to understand the\r\ntruth, but as soon as he heard Clarence Hervey\'s voice, he insisted upon\r\ngoing up to _his wife\'s_ dressing-room. It was a very unusual thing, but\r\nneither Champfort nor any one else could restrain him, the moment that\r\nhe had formed this idea; he forced his way into the room.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this?--Colonel Lawless!" said he, addressing himself to\r\nClarence Hervey, whom, in the confusion of his mind, he mistook for the\r\ncolonel, the first object of his jealousy. "Colonel Lawless," cried his\r\nlordship, "you are a villain. I always knew it."\r\n\r\n"Softly!--she\'s in great pain, my lord," said Belinda, catching Lord\r\nDelacour\'s arm, just as he was going to strike Clarence Hervey. She led\r\nhim to the sofa where Lady Delacour lay, and uncovering her ankle, which\r\nwas much swelled, showed it to him. His lordship, who was a humane man,\r\nwas somewhat moved by this appeal to his remaining senses, and he began\r\nroaring as loud as he possibly could for arquebusade.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour rested her head upon the back of the sofa, her hands moved\r\nwith convulsive twitches--she was perfectly silent. Marriott was in a\r\ngreat bustle, running backwards and forwards for she knew not what,\r\nand continually repeating, "I wish nobody would come in here but Miss\r\nPortman and me. My lady says nobody must come in. Lord bless me! my lord\r\nhere too!"\r\n\r\n"Have you any arquebusade, Marriott? Arquebusade, for your lady,\r\ndirectly!" cried his lordship, following her to the door of the boudoir,\r\nwhere she was going for some drops.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my lord, you can\'t come in, I assure you, my lord, there\'s nothing\r\nhere, my lord, nothing of the sort," said Marriott, setting her back\r\nagainst the door. Her terror and embarrassment instantly recalled all\r\nthe jealous suspicions of Lord Delacour. "Woman!" cried he, "I _will_\r\nsee whom you have in this room!--You have some one concealed there, and\r\nI _will_ go in." Then with brutal oaths he dragged Marriott from the\r\ndoor, and snatched the key from her struggling hand.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour started up, and gave a scream of agony. "My lord!--Lord\r\nDelacour," cried Belinda, springing forward, "hear me."\r\n\r\nLord Delacour stopped short. "Tell me, then," cried Lord Delacour,\r\n"is not a lover of Lady Delacour\'s concealed there?" "No!--No!--No!"\r\nanswered Belinda. "Then a lover of Miss Portman?" said Lord Delacour.\r\n"Gad! we have hit it now, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Believe whatever you please, my lord," said Belinda, hastily, "but give\r\nme the key."\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey drew the key from Lord Delacour\'s hand, gave it to Miss\r\nPortman without looking at her, and immediately withdrew. Lord Delacour\r\nfollowed him with a sort of drunken laugh; and no one remained in the\r\nroom but Marriott, Belinda, and Lady Delacour. Marriott was so much\r\n_fluttered_, as she said, that she could do nothing. Miss Portman locked\r\nthe room door, and began to undress Lady Delacour, who lay motionless.\r\n"Are we by ourselves?" said Lady Delacour, opening her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes--are you much hurt?" said Belinda. "Oh, you are a charming girl!"\r\nsaid Lady Delacour. "Who would have thought you had so much presence of\r\nmind and courage--have you the key safe?" "Here it is," said Belinda,\r\nproducing it; and she repeated her question, "Are you much hurt?" "I am\r\nnot in pain now," said Lady Delacour, "but I _have_ suffered terribly.\r\nIf I could get rid of all this finery, if you could put me to bed, I\r\ncould sleep perhaps."\r\n\r\nWhilst Belinda was undressing Lady Delacour, she shrieked several times;\r\nbut between every interval of pain she repeated, "I shall be better\r\nto-morrow." As soon as she was in bed, she desired Marriott to give\r\nher double her usual quantity of laudanum; for that all the inclination\r\nwhich she had felt to sleep was gone, and that she could not endure the\r\nshooting pains that she felt in her breast.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone with your lady, Marriott," said Miss Portman, taking\r\nthe bottle of laudanum from her trembling hand, "and go to bed; for I am\r\nsure you are not able to sit up any longer."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she took Marriott into the adjoining dressing-room. "Oh,\r\ndear Miss Portman," said Marriott, who was sincerely attached to her\r\nlady, and who at this instant forgot all her jealousies, and all her\r\nlove of power, "I\'ll do any thing you ask me; but pray let me stay in\r\nthe room, though I know I\'m quite helpless. It will be too much for you\r\nto be here all night by yourself. The convulsions may take my lady.\r\nWhat shrieks she gives every now and then!--and nobody knows what\'s the\r\nmatter but ourselves; and every body in the house is asking me why a\r\nsurgeon is not sent for, if my lady is so much hurt. Oh, I can\'t answer\r\nfor it to my conscience, to have kept the matter secret so long; for to\r\nbe sure a physician, if had in time, might have saved my lady--but now\r\nnothing can save her!" And here Marriott burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you give me the laudanum?" cried Lady Delacour, in a loud\r\nperemptory voice; "Give it to me instantly."--"No," said Miss Portman,\r\nfirmly.--"Hear me, Lady Delacour--you must allow me to judge, for you\r\nknow that you are not in a condition to judge for yourself, or rather\r\nyou must allow me to send for a physician, who may judge for us both."\r\n\r\n"A physician!" cried Lady Delacour, "Never--never. I charge you let\r\nno physician be sent for. Remember your promise: you _cannot_ betray\r\nme--you _will_ not betray me."\r\n\r\n"No," said Belinda, "of that I have given sufficient proof--but you will\r\nbetray yourself: it is already known by your servants that you have\r\nbeen hurt by the overturn of your carriage; if you do not let either a\r\nsurgeon or physician see you it will excite surprise and suspicion.\r\nIt is not in your power, when violent pain seizes you, to refrain\r\nfrom---------"\r\n\r\n"It is," interrupted Lady Delacour; "not another scream shall you\r\nhear--only do not, do not, my dear Belinda, send for a physician."\r\n\r\n"You will throw yourself again into convulsions," said Belinda.\r\n"Marriott, you see, has lost all command of herself--I shall not have\r\nstrength to manage you---perhaps I may lose my presence of mind--I\r\ncannot answer for myself--your husband may desire to see you."\r\n\r\n"No danger of that," said Lady Delacour: "tell him my ankle is\r\nsprained--tell him I am bruised all over--tell him any thing you\r\nwill--he will not trouble himself any more about me--he will forget all\r\nthat passed to-night by the time he is sober. Oh! give me the laudanum,\r\ndearest Belinda, and say no more about physicians."\r\n\r\nIt was in vain to reason with Lady Delacour. Belinda attempted to\r\npersuade her: "For my sake, dear Lady Delacour," said she, "let me send\r\nfor Dr. X----; he is a man of honour, your secret will be perfectly\r\nsafe with him."\r\n\r\n"He will tell it to Clarence Hervey," said Lady Delacour: "of all men\r\nliving, I would not send for Dr. X----; I will not see him if he\r\ncomes."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Belinda, calmly, but with a fixed determination of\r\ncountenance, "I must leave you to-morrow morning--I must return to\r\nBath."\r\n\r\n"Leave me! remember your promise."\r\n\r\n"Circumstances have occurred, about which I have made no promise," said\r\nBelinda; "I must leave you, unless you will now give me your permission\r\nto send for Dr. X----."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour hesitated. "You see," continued Belinda, "that I am in\r\nearnest: when I am gone, you will have no friend left; when I am gone,\r\nyour secret will inevitably be discovered; for without me, Marriott will\r\nnot have sufficient strength of mind to keep it."\r\n\r\n"Do you think we might trust Dr. X----?" said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you may trust him," said Belinda, with energy; "I will pledge\r\nmy life upon his honour."\r\n\r\n"Then send for him, since it must be so," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the words passed Lady Delacour\'s lips than Belinda flew\r\nto execute her orders. Marriott recovered her senses when she heard that\r\nher ladyship had consented to send for a physician; but she declared\r\nthat she could not conceive how any thing less than the power of magic\r\ncould have brought her lady to such a determination.\r\n\r\nBelinda had scarcely despatched a servant for Dr. X----, when Lady\r\nDelacour repented of the permission she had given, and all that could\r\nbe said to pacify only irritated her temper. She became delirious;\r\nBelinda\'s presence of mind never forsook her, she remained quietly\r\nbeside the bed waiting for the arrival of Dr. X----, and she absolutely\r\nrefused admittance to the servants, who, drawn by their lady\'s\r\noutrageous cries, continually came to her door with offers of\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nAbout four o\'clock the doctor arrived, and Miss Portman was relieved\r\nfrom some of her anxiety. He assured her that there was no immediate\r\ndanger, and he promised that the secret which she had entrusted to him\r\nshould be faithfully kept. He remained with her some hours, till Lady\r\nDelacour became more quiet and fell asleep, exhausted with delirious\r\nexertions.--"I think I may now leave you," said Dr. X----; but as he was\r\ngoing through the dressing-room, Belinda stopped him.--"Now that I have\r\ntime to think of myself," said she, "let me consult you as my friend: I\r\nam not used to act entirely for myself, and I shall be most grateful if\r\nyou will assist me with your advice. I hate all mysteries, but I feel\r\nmyself bound in honour to keep the secret with which Lady Delacour\r\nhas entrusted me. Last night I was so circumstanced, that I could not\r\nextricate her ladyship without exposing myself to--to suspicion."\r\n\r\nMiss Portman then related all that had passed about the mysterious door,\r\nwhich Lord Delacour, in his fit of drunken jealousy, had insisted upon\r\nbreaking open.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hervey," continued Belinda, "was present when all this happened--he\r\nseemed much surprised: I should be sorry that he should remain in an\r\nerror which might be fatal to my reputation--you know a woman ought\r\nnot even to be suspected; yet how to remove this suspicion I know not,\r\nbecause I cannot enter into any explanation, without betraying Lady\r\nDelacour--she has, I know, a peculiar dread of Mr. Hervey\'s discovering\r\nthe truth."\r\n\r\n"And is it possible," cried Dr. X----, "that any woman should be so\r\nmeanly selfish, as thus to expose the reputation of her friend merely to\r\npreserve her own vanity from mortification?"\r\n\r\n"Hush--don\'t speak so loud," said Belinda, "you will awaken her; and at\r\npresent she is certainly more an object of pity than of indignation.--If\r\nyou will have the goodness to come with me, I will take you by a back\r\nstaircase up to the _mysterious boudoir_. I am not too proud to give\r\npositive proofs of my speaking truth; the key of that room now lies on\r\nLady Delacour\'s bed--it was that which she grasped in her hand during\r\nher delirium--she has now let it fall--it opens both the doors of the\r\nboudoir--you shall see," added Miss Portman, with a smile, "that I am\r\nnot afraid to let you unlock either of them."\r\n\r\n"As a polite man," said Dr. X----, "I believe that I should\r\nabsolutely refuse to take any external evidence of a lady\'s truth; but\r\ndemonstration is unanswerable even by enemies, and I will not sacrifice\r\nyour interests to the foppery of my politeness--so I am ready to follow\r\nyou. The curiosity of the servants may have been excited by last night\'s\r\ndisturbance, and I see no method so certain as that which you propose of\r\npreventing busy rumour. That goddess (let Ovid say what he pleases) was\r\nborn and bred in a kitchen, or a servants\' hall.--But," continued\r\nDr. X----, "my dear Miss Portman, you will put a stop to a number\r\nof charming stories by this prudence of yours--a romance called the\r\nMysterious Boudoir, of nine volumes at least, might be written on this\r\nsubject, if you would only condescend to act like almost all other\r\nheroines, that is to say, without common sense."\r\n\r\nThe doctor now followed Belinda, and satisfied himself by ocular\r\ndemonstration, that this cabinet was the retirement of disease, and not\r\nof pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was about eight o\'clock in the morning when Dr. X---- got home; he\r\nfound Clarence Hervey waiting for him. Clarence seemed to be in great\r\nagitation, though he endeavoured, with all the power which he possessed\r\nover himself, to suppress his emotion.\r\n\r\n"You have been to see Lady Delacour," said he, calmly: "is she much\r\nhurt?--It was a terrible accident."\r\n\r\n"She has been much hurt," said Dr. X----, "and she has been for some\r\nhours delirious; but ask me no more questions now, for I am asleep, and\r\nmust go to bed, unless you have any thing to say that can waken me: you\r\nlook as if some great misfortune had befallen you; what is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear friend," said Hervey, taking his hand, "do not jest with\r\nme; I am not able to bear your raillery in my present temper--in one\r\nword, I fear that Belinda is unworthy of my esteem: I can tell you no\r\nmore, except that I am more miserable than I thought any woman could\r\nmake me."\r\n\r\n"You are in a prodigious hurry to be miserable," said Dr. X----. "Upon\r\nmy word I think you would make a mighty pretty hero in a novel; you take\r\nthings very properly for granted, and, stretched out upon that sofa, you\r\nact the distracted lover vastly well--and to complete the matter, you\r\ncannot tell me why you are more miserable than ever man or hero was\r\nbefore. I must tell you, then, that you have still more cause for\r\njealousy than you suspect. Ay, start--every jealous man starts at the\r\nsound of the word jealousy--a certain symptom this of the disease."\r\n\r\n"You mistake me," cried Clarence Hervey; "no man is less disposed to\r\njealousy than I am--but----"\r\n\r\n"But your mistress--no, not your mistress, for you have never yet\r\ndeclared to her your attachment--but the lady you admire will not let a\r\ndrunken man unlock a door, and you immediately suppose--"\r\n\r\n"She has mentioned the circumstance to you!" exclaimed Hervey, in a\r\njoyful tone: "then she _must_ be innocent."\r\n\r\n"Admirable reasoning!--I was going to have told you just now, if you\r\nwould have suffered me to speak connectedly, that you have more reason\r\nfor jealousy than you suspect, for Miss Portman has actually unlocked\r\nfor me--for me! look at me--the door, the mysterious door--and whilst I\r\nlive, and whilst she lives, we can neither of us ever tell you the cause\r\nof the mystery. All I can tell you is, that no lover is in the case,\r\nupon my honour--and now, if you should ever mistake curiosity in your\r\nown mind for jealousy, expect no pity from me."\r\n\r\n"I should deserve none," said Clarence Hervey; "you have made me the\r\nhappiest of men."\r\n\r\n"The happiest of men!--No, no; keep that superlative exclamation for\r\na future occasion. But now you behave like a reasonable creature, you\r\ndeserve to hear the praises of your Belinda--I am so much charmed with\r\nher, that I wish--"\r\n\r\n"When can I see her?" interrupted Hervey; "I\'ll go to her this instant."\r\n\r\n"Gently," said Dr. X----, "you forget what time of the day it is--you\r\nforget that Miss Portman has been up all night--that Lady Delacour is\r\nextremely ill--and that this would be the most unseasonable opportunity\r\nyou could possibly choose for your visit."\r\n\r\nTo this observation Clarence Hervey assented; but he immediately seized\r\na pen from the doctor\'s writing table, and began a letter to Belinda.\r\nThe doctor threw himself upon the sofa, saying, "Waken me when you want\r\nme," and in a few minutes he was fast asleep.\r\n\r\n"Doctor, upon second thoughts," said Clarence, rising suddenly, and\r\ntearing his letter down the middle, "I cannot write to her yet--I forgot\r\nthe reformation of Lady Delacour: how soon do you think she will be\r\nwell? Besides, I have another reason for not writing to Belinda at\r\npresent--you must know, my dear doctor, that I have, or had, another\r\nmistress."\r\n\r\n"Another mistress, indeed!" cried Dr. X----, trying to waken himself.\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens! I do believe you\'ve been asleep."\r\n\r\n"I do believe I have."\r\n\r\n"But is it possible that you could fall sound asleep in that time?"\r\n\r\n"Very possible," said the doctor: "what is there so extraordinary in\r\na man\'s falling asleep? Men are apt to sleep sometime within the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, unless they have half-a-dozen mistresses to keep\r\nthem awake, as you seem to have, my good friend."\r\n\r\nA servant now came into the room with a letter, that had just arrived\r\nexpress from the country for Dr. X----.\r\n\r\n"This is another affair," cried he, rousing himself.\r\n\r\nThe letter required the doctor\'s immediate attendance. He shook hands\r\nwith Clarence Hervey: "My dear friend, I am really concerned that I\r\ncannot stay to hear the history of your six mistresses; but you see that\r\nthis is an affair of life and death."\r\n\r\n"Farewell," said Clarence: "I have not six, I have only three goddesses;\r\neven if you count Lady Delacour for one. But I really wanted your advice\r\nin good earnest."\r\n\r\n"If your case be desperate, you can write, cannot you? Direct to me at\r\nHorton-hall, Cambridge. In the mean time, as far as general rules go, I\r\ncan give you my advice gratis, in the formula of an old Scotch song----\r\n\r\n    "\'Tis good to be merry and wise,\r\n    \'Tis good to be honest and true,\r\n    \'Tis good to be off with the old love\r\n    Before you be on with the new.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore he left town, Dr. X---- called in Berkeley-square, to see Lady\r\nDelacour; he found that she was out of all immediate danger. Miss\r\nPortman was sorry that he was obliged to quit her at this time, but she\r\nfelt the necessity for his going; he was sent for to attend Mr. Horton,\r\nan intimate friend of his, a gentleman of great talents, and of the most\r\nactive benevolence, who had just been seized with a violent fever, in\r\nconsequence of his exertions in saving the poor inhabitants of a village\r\nin his neighbourhood from the effects of a dreadful fire, which broke\r\nout in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour, who heard Dr. X---- giving this account to Belinda, drew\r\nback her curtain, and said, "Go this instant, doctor--I am out of all\r\nimmediate danger, you say; but if I were not--I must die in the course\r\nof a few months, you know--and what is my life, compared with the chance\r\nof saving your excellent friend! He is of some use in the world--I am of\r\nnone--go this instant, doctor."\r\n\r\n"What a pity," said Dr. X----, as he left the room, "that a woman who\r\nis capable of so much magnanimity should have wasted her life on petty\r\nobjects!"\r\n\r\n"Her life is not yet at an end--oh, sir, if you _could_ save her!" cried\r\nBelinda.\r\n\r\nDoctor X---- shook his head; but returning to Belinda, after going half\r\nway down stairs, he added, "when you read this paper, you will know all\r\nthat I can tell you upon the subject."\r\n\r\nBelinda, the moment the doctor was gone, shut herself up in her own room\r\nto read the paper which he had given to her. Dr. X---- first stated that\r\nhe was by no means certain that Lady Delacour really had the complaint\r\nwhich she so much dreaded; but it was impossible for him to decide\r\nwithout farther examination, to which her ladyship could not be\r\nprevailed upon to submit. Then he mentioned all that he thought would be\r\nmost efficacious in mitigating the pain that Lady Delacour might feel,\r\nand all that could be done, with the greatest probability of prolonging\r\nher life. And he concluded with the following words: "These are all\r\ntemporizing expedients: according to the usual progress of the disease,\r\nLady Delacour may live a year, or perhaps two.\r\n\r\n"It is possible that her life might be saved by a _skilful_ surgeon. By\r\na few words that dropped from her ladyship last night, I apprehend\r\nthat she has some thoughts of submitting to an operation, which will\r\nbe attended with much pain and danger, even if she employ the most\r\nexperienced surgeon in London; but if she put herself, from a vain hope\r\nof secrecy, into ignorant hands, she will inevitably destroy herself."\r\n\r\nAfter reading this paper, Belinda had some faint hopes that Lady\r\nDelacour\'s life might be saved; but she determined to wait till Dr.\r\nX----should return to town, before she mentioned his opinion to his\r\npatient; and she earnestly hoped that no idea of putting herself into\r\nignorant hands would recur to her ladyship.\r\n\r\nLord Delacour, in the morning, when he was sober, retained but a\r\nconfused idea of the events of the preceding night; but he made an\r\nawkwardly good-natured apology to Miss Portman for his intrusion, and\r\nfor the disturbance he had occasioned, which, he said, must be laid\r\nto the blame of Lord Studley\'s admirable burgundy. He expressed much\r\nconcern for Lady Delacour\'s terrible accident; but he could not help\r\nobserving, that if his advice had been taken, the thing could not have\r\nhappened--that it was the consequence of her ladyship\'s self-willedness\r\nabout the young horses.\r\n\r\n"How she got the horses without paying for them, or how she got money to\r\npay for them, I know not," said his lordship; "for I said I would have\r\nnothing to do with the business, and I have kept to my resolution."\r\n\r\nHis lordship finished his morning visit to Miss Portman, by observing\r\nthat "the house would now be very dull for her: that the office of a\r\nnurse was ill-suited to so young and beautiful a lady, but that her\r\nundertaking it with so much cheerfulness was a proof of a degree\r\nof good-nature that was not always to be met with in the young and\r\nhandsome."\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Lord Delacour spoke convinced Belinda that he was in\r\nreality attached to his wife, however the fear of being, or of appearing\r\nto be, governed by her ladyship might have estranged him from her, and\r\nfrom home. She now saw in him much more good sense, and symptoms of a\r\nmore amiable character, than his lady had described, or than she ever\r\nwould allow that he possessed.\r\n\r\nThe reflections, however, which Miss Portman made upon the miserable\r\nlife this ill-matched couple led together, did not incline her in favour\r\nof marriage in general; great talents on one side, and good-nature\r\non the other, had, in this instance, tended only to make each party\r\nunhappy. Matches of interest, convenience, and vanity, she was\r\nconvinced, diminished instead of increasing happiness. Of domestic\r\nfelicity she had never, except during her childhood, seen examples--she\r\nhad, indeed, heard from Dr. X---- descriptions of the happy family of\r\nLady Anne Percival, but she feared to indulge the romantic hope of ever\r\nbeing loved by a man of superior genius and virtue, with a temper and\r\nmanners suited to her taste. The only person she had seen, who at all\r\nanswered this description, was Mr. Hervey; and it was firmly fixed in\r\nher mind, that he was not a marrying man, and consequently not a man of\r\nwhom any prudent woman would suffer herself to think with partiality.\r\nShe could not doubt that he liked her society and conversation; his\r\nmanner had sometimes expressed more than cold esteem. Lady Delacour had\r\nassured her that it expressed love; but Lady Delacour was an imprudent\r\nwoman in her own conduct, and not scrupulous as to that of others.\r\nBelinda was not guided by _her_ opinions of propriety; and now that her\r\nladyship was confined to her bed, and not in a condition to give her\r\neither advice or protection, she felt that it was peculiarly incumbent\r\non her to guard, not only her conduct from reproach, but her heart from\r\nthe hopeless misery of an ill-placed attachment. She examined herself\r\nwith firm impartiality; she recollected the excessive pain that she had\r\nendured, when she first heard Clarence Hervey say, that Belinda Portman\r\nwas a compound of art and affectation; but this she thought was only\r\nthe pain of offended pride--of proper pride. She recollected the extreme\r\nanxiety she had felt, even within the last four-and-twenty hours,\r\nconcerning the opinion which he might form of the transaction about the\r\nkey of the boudoir--but this anxiety she justified to herself; it was\r\ndue, she thought, to her reputation; it would have been inconsistent\r\nwith female delicacy to have been indifferent about the suspicions that\r\nnecessarily arose from the circumstances in which she was placed. Before\r\nBelinda had completed her self-examination, Clarence Hervey called to\r\ninquire after Lady Delacour. Whilst he spoke of her ladyship, and of his\r\nconcern for the dreadful accident of which he believed himself to be\r\nin a great measure the cause, his manner and language were animated and\r\nunaffected; but the moment that this subject was exhausted, he became\r\nembarrassed; though he distinctly expressed perfect confidence and\r\nesteem for her, he seemed to wish, and yet to be unable, to support\r\nthe character of a friend, contradistinguished to an admirer. He seemed\r\nconscious that he could not, with propriety, advert to the suspicions\r\nand jealousy which he had felt the preceding night; for a man who has\r\nnever declared love would be absurd and impertinent, were he to betray\r\njealousy. Clarence was destitute neither of address nor presence of\r\nmind; but an accident happened, when he was just taking leave of Miss\r\nPortman, which threw him into utter confusion. It surprised, if it\r\ndid not confound, Belinda. She had forgotten to ask Dr. X---- for his\r\ndirection; and as she thought it might be necessary to write to him\r\nconcerning Lady Delacour\'s health, she begged of Mr. Hervey to give it\r\nto her. He took a letter out of his pocket, and wrote the direction with\r\na pencil; but as he opened the paper, to tear off the outside, on\r\nwhich he had been writing, a lock of hair dropped out of the letter; he\r\nhastily stooped for it, and as he took it up from the ground the lock\r\nunfolded. Belinda, though she cast but one involuntary, hasty glance at\r\nit, was struck with the beauty of its colour, and its uncommon length.\r\nThe confusion of Clarence Hervey convinced her that he was extremely\r\ninterested about the person to whom the hair belonged, and the\r\nspecies of alarm which she had felt at this discovery opened her eyes\r\neffectually to the state of her own heart. She was sensible that the\r\nsight of a lock of hair, however long, or however beautiful, in the\r\nhands of any man but Clarence Hervey, could not possibly have excited\r\nany emotion in her mind. "Fortunately," thought she, "I have discovered\r\nthat he is attached to another, whilst it is yet in my power to command\r\nmy affections; and he shall see that I am not so weak as to form any\r\nfalse expectations from what I must now consider as mere common-place\r\nflattery." Belinda was glad that Lady Delacour was not present at the\r\ndiscovery of the lock of hair, as she was aware that she would have\r\nrallied her unmercifully upon the occasion; and she rejoiced that she\r\nhad not been prevailed upon to give _Madame la Comtesse de Pomenars_\r\na lock of her _belle chevelure_. She could not help thinking, from the\r\nrecollection of several minute circumstances, that Clarence Hervey had\r\nendeavoured to gain an interest in her affections, and she felt that\r\nthere would be great impropriety in receiving his ambiguous visits\r\nduring Lady Delacour\'s confinement to her room. She therefore gave\r\norders that Mr. Hervey should not in future be admitted, till her\r\nladyship should again see company. This precaution proved totally\r\nsuperfluous, for Mr. Hervey never called again, during the whole course\r\nof Lady Delacour\'s confinement, though his servant regularly came every\r\nmorning with inquiries after her ladyship\'s health. She kept her room\r\nfor about ten days; a confinement to which she submitted with extreme\r\nimpatience: bodily pain she bore with fortitude, but constraint and\r\nennui she could not endure.\r\n\r\nOne morning as she was sitting up in bed, looking over a large\r\ncollection of notes, and cards of inquiry after her health, she\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n"These people will soon be tired of[4] bidding their footman put it into\r\ntheir heads to inquire whether I am alive or dead--I must appear amongst\r\nthem again, if it be only for a few minutes, or they will forget me.\r\nWhen I am fatigued, I will retire, and you, my dear Belinda, shall\r\nrepresent me; so tell them to open my doors, and unmuffle the knocker:\r\nlet me hear the sound of music and dancing, and let the house be filled\r\nagain, for Heaven\'s sake. Dr. Zimmermann should never have been my\r\nphysician, for he would have prescribed solitude. Now solitude and\r\nsilence are worse for me than poppy and mandragora. It is impossible to\r\ntell how much silence tires the ears of those who have not been used\r\nto it. For mercy\'s sake, Marriott," continued her ladyship, turning to\r\nMarriott, who just then came softly into the room, "for mercy\'s sake,\r\ndon\'t walk to all eternity on tiptoes: to see people gliding about like\r\nghosts makes me absolutely fancy myself amongst the shades below. I\r\nwould rather be stunned by the loudest peal that ever thundering footman\r\ngave at my door, than hear Marriott lock that boudoir, as if my life\r\ndepended on my not hearing the key turned."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! I never knew any lady that was ill, except my lady, complain\r\nof one\'s not making a noise to disturb her," said Marriott.\r\n\r\n"Then to please you, Marriott, I will complain of the only noise that\r\ndoes, or ever did disturb me--the screaming of your odious macaw."\r\n\r\nNow Marriott had a prodigious affection for this macaw, and she defended\r\nit with as much eagerness as if it had been her child.\r\n\r\n"Odious! O dear, my lady! to call my poor macaw odious!--I didn\'t expect\r\nit would ever have come to this--I am sure I don\'t deserve it--I\'m sure\r\nI don\'t deserve that my lady should have taken such a dislike to me."\r\n\r\nAnd here Marriott actually burst into tears. "But, my dear Marriott,"\r\nsaid Lady Delacour, "I only object to your macaw--may not I dislike your\r\nmacaw without disliking you?--I have heard of \'love me, love my dog;\'\r\nbut I never heard of \'love me, love my bird\'--did you, Miss Portman?"\r\n\r\nMarriott turned sharply round upon Miss Portman, and darted a fiery look\r\nat her through the midst of her tears. "Then \'tis plain," said she,\r\n"who I\'m to thank for this;" and as she left the room her lady could not\r\ncomplain of her shutting the door after her too gently.\r\n\r\n"Give her three minutes\' grace and she will come to her senses," said\r\nLady Delacour, "for she is not a bankrupt in sense. Oh, three minutes\r\nwon\'t do; I must allow her three days\' grace, I perceive," said Lady\r\nDelacour when Marriott half an hour afterward reappeared, with a face\r\nwhich might have sat for the picture of ill-humour. Her ill-humour,\r\nhowever, did not prevent her from attending her lady as usual; she\r\nperformed all her customary offices with the most officious zeal but\r\nin profound silence, except every now and then she would utter a sigh,\r\nwhich seemed to say, "See how much I\'m attached to my lady, and yet my\r\nlady hates my macaw!" Her lady, who perfectly understood the language of\r\nsighs, and felt the force of Marriott\'s, forbore to touch again on the\r\ntender subject of the macaw, hoping that when her house was once more\r\nfilled with company, she should be relieved by more agreeable noises\r\nfrom continually hearing this pertinacious tormentor.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was known that Lady Delacour was sufficiently recovered to\r\nreceive company, her door was crowded with carriages; and as soon as\r\nit was understood that balls and concerts were to go on as usual at\r\nher house, her "troops of friends" appeared to congratulate her, and to\r\namuse themselves.\r\n\r\n"How stupid it is," said Lady Delacour to Belinda, "to hear\r\ncongratulatory speeches from people, who would not care if I were in\r\nthe black hole at Calcutta this minute; but we must take the world as it\r\ngoes--dirt and precious stones mixed together. Clarence Hervey, however,\r\n_n\'a pas une ame de boue_; he, I am sure, has been really concerned for\r\nme: he thinks that his young horses were the sole cause of the whole\r\nevil, and he blames himself so sincerely, and so unjustly, that I really\r\nwas half tempted to undeceive him; but that would have been doing him\r\nan injury, for you know great philosophers tell us that there is no\r\npleasure in the world equal to that of being well deceived, especially\r\nby the fair sex. Seriously, Belinda, is it my fancy, or is not Clarence\r\nwonderfully changed? Is not he grown pale, and thin, and serious, not to\r\nsay melancholy? What have you done to him since I have been ill?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing--I have never seen him."\r\n\r\n"No! then the thing is accounted for very naturally--he is in despair\r\nbecause he has been banished from your divine presence."\r\n\r\n"More likely because he has been in anxiety about your ladyship," said\r\nBelinda.\r\n\r\n"I will find out the cause, let it be what it may," said Lady Delacour:\r\n"luckily my address is equal to my curiosity, and that is saying a great\r\ndeal."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all her ladyship\'s address, her curiosity was baffled;\r\nshe could not discover Clarence Hervey\'s secret, and she began to\r\nbelieve that the change which she had noticed in his looks and manner\r\nwas imaginary or accidental. Had she seen more of him at this time, she\r\nwould not have so easily given up her suspicions; but she saw him only\r\nfor a few minutes every day, and during that time he talked to her with\r\nall his former gaiety; besides, Lady Delacour had herself a daily part\r\nto perform, which occupied almost her whole attention. Notwithstanding\r\nthe vivacity which she affected, Belinda perceived that she was now more\r\nseriously alarmed than she had ever been about her health. It was all\r\nthat her utmost exertions could accomplish, to appear for a short time\r\nin the day--some evenings she came into company only for half an hour,\r\non other days only for a few minutes, just walked through the rooms,\r\npaid her compliments to every body, complained of a nervous head-ache,\r\nleft Belinda to do the honours for her, and retired.\r\n\r\nMiss Portman was now really placed in a difficult and dangerous\r\nsituation, and she had ample opportunities of learning and practising\r\nprudence. All the fashionable dissipated young men in London frequented\r\nLady Delacour\'s house, and it was said that they were drawn thither by\r\nthe attractions of her fair representative. The gentlemen considered a\r\nniece of Mrs. Stanhope as their lawful prize. The ladies wondered that\r\nthe men could think Belinda Portman a beauty; but whilst they affected\r\nto scorn, they sincerely feared her charms. Thus left entirely to her\r\nown discretion, she was exposed at once to the malignant eye of envy,\r\nand the insidious voice of flattery--she had no friend, no guide, and\r\nscarcely a protector: her aunt Stanhope\'s letters, indeed, continually\r\nsupplied her with advice, but with advice which she could not follow\r\nconsistently with her own feelings and principles. Lady Delacour, even\r\nif she had been well, was not a person on whose counsels she could rely;\r\nour heroine was not one of those daring spirits, who are ambitious of\r\nacting for themselves; she felt the utmost diffidence of her own powers,\r\nyet at the same time a firm resolution not to be led even by timidity\r\ninto follies which the example of Lady Delacour had taught her to\r\ndespise. Belinda\'s prudence seemed to increase with the necessity for\r\nits exertion. It was not the mercenary wily prudence of a young lady,\r\nwho has been taught to think it virtue to sacrifice the affections of\r\nher heart to the interests of her fortune--it was not the prudence of a\r\ncold and selfish, but of a modest and generous woman. She found it most\r\ndifficult to satisfy herself in her conduct towards Clarence Hervey:\r\nhe seemed mortified and miserable if she treated him merely as a\r\ncommon acquaintance, yet she felt the danger of admitting him to the\r\nfamiliarity of friendship. Had she been thoroughly convinced that he was\r\nattached to some other woman, she hoped that she could freely converse\r\nwith him, and look upon him as a married man; but notwithstanding the\r\nlock of beautiful hair, she could not entirely divest herself of the\r\nidea that she was beloved, when she observed the extreme eagerness with\r\nwhich Clarence Hervey watched all her motions, and followed her with his\r\neye as if his fate depended upon her. She remarked that he endeavoured\r\nas much as possible to prevent this species of attention from being\r\nnoticed, either by the public or by herself; his manner towards her\r\nevery day became more distant and respectful, more constrained and\r\nembarrassed; but now and then a different look and expression escaped.\r\nShe had often heard of Mr. Hervey\'s great _address_ in affairs of\r\ngallantry, and she was sometimes inclined to believe that he was\r\ntrifling with her, merely for the glory of a conquest over her heart; at\r\nother times she suspected him of deeper designs upon her, such as would\r\ndeserve contempt and detestation; but upon the whole she was disposed\r\nto believe that he was entangled by some former attachment from which he\r\ncould not extricate himself with honour; and upon this supposition she\r\nthought him worthy of her esteem, and of her pity.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Sir Philip Baddely began to pay a sort of lounging\r\nattention to Belinda: he knew that Clarence Hervey liked her, and this\r\nwas the principal cause of his desire to attract her attention. "Belinda\r\nPortman" became his favourite toast, and amongst his companions he gave\r\nhimself the air of talking of her with rapture.\r\n\r\n"Rochfort," said he, one day, to his friend, "damme, if I was to think\r\nof Belinda Portman in _any way_--you take me--Clary would look damned\r\nblue--hey?--damned blue, and devilish small, and cursed silly too--hey?"\r\n\r\n"\'Pon honour, I should like to see him," said Rochfort: "\'pon honour, he\r\ndeserves it from us, Sir Phil, and I\'ll stand your friend with the girl,\r\nand it will do no harm to give her a hint of Clary\'s Windsor flame, as a\r\ndead secret--\'pon honour, he deserves it from us."\r\n\r\nNow it seems that Sir Philip Baddely and Mr. Rochfort, during the time\r\nof Clarence Hervey\'s intimacy with them, observed that he paid frequent\r\nvisits at Windsor, and they took it into their heads that he kept a\r\nmistress there. They were very curious to see her: and, unknown to\r\nClarence, they made several attempts for this purpose: at last one\r\nevening, when they were certain that he was not at Windsor, they scaled\r\nthe high garden wall of the house which he frequented, and actually\r\nobtained a sight of a beautiful young girl and an elderly lady, whom\r\nthey took for her gouvernante. This adventure they kept a profound\r\nsecret from Clarence, because they knew that he would have quarrelled\r\nwith them immediately, and would have called them to account for their\r\nintrusion. They now determined to avail themselves of their knowledge,\r\nand of his ignorance of this circumstance: but they were sensible\r\nthat it was necessary to go warily to work, lest they should betray\r\nthemselves. Accordingly they began by dropping distant mysterious\r\nhints about Clarence Hervey to Lady Delacour and Miss Portman. Such\r\nfor instance as--"Damme, we all know Clary\'s a perfect connoisseur in\r\nbeauty--hey, Rochfort?--one beauty at a time is not enough for him--hey,\r\ndamme? And it is not fashion, nor wit, nor elegance, and all that, that\r\nhe looks for _always_."\r\n\r\nThese observations were accompanied with the most significant looks.\r\nBelinda heard and saw all this in painful silence, but Lady Delacour\r\noften used her address to draw some farther explanation from Sir Philip:\r\nhis regular answer was, "No, no, your ladyship must excuse me there; I\r\ncan\'t peach, damme--hey, Rochfort?"\r\n\r\nHe was in hopes, from the reserve with which Miss Portman began to treat\r\nClarence, that he should, without making any distinct charge, succeed\r\nin disgusting her with his rival. Mr. Hervey was about this time less\r\nassiduous than formerly in his visits at Lady Delacour\'s; Sir Philip\r\nwas there every day, and often for Miss Portman\'s entertainment exerted\r\nhimself so far as to tell the news of the town. One morning, when\r\nClarence Hervey happened to be present, the baronet thought it incumbent\r\nupon him to eclipse his rival in conversation, and he began to talk of\r\nthe last fete champetre at Frogmore.\r\n\r\n"What a cursed unlucky overturn that was of yours, Lady Delacour, with\r\nthose famous young horses! Why, what with this sprain, and this nervous\r\nbusiness, you\'ve not been able to stir out since the birthday, and\r\nyou\'ve missed the breakfast, and all that, at Frogmore--why, all the\r\nworld stayed broiling in town on purpose for it, and you that had a card\r\ntoo--how damned provoking!"\r\n\r\n"I regret extremely that my illness prevented me from being at this\r\ncharming fete; I regret it more on Miss Portman\'s account than on\r\nmy own," said her ladyship. Belinda assured her that she felt no\r\nmortification from the disappointment.\r\n\r\n"O, damme! but I would have driven you in my curricle," said Sir Philip:\r\n"it was the finest sight and best conducted I ever saw, and only wanted\r\nMiss Portman to make it complete. We had gipsies, and Mrs. Mills the\r\nactress for the queen of the gipsies; and she gave us a famous good\r\nsong, Rochfort, you know--and then there _was_ two children upon an\r\n_ass_--damme, I don\'t know how they came there, for they\'re things one\r\nsees every day--and belonged only to two of the soldiers\' wives--for we\r\nhad the whole band of the Staffordshire playing at dinner, and we had\r\nsome famous glees--and Fawcett gave us his laughing song, and then we\r\nhad the launching of the ship, and only it was a boat, it would have\r\nbeen well enough--but damme, the song of Polly Oliver was worth the\r\nwhole--except the Flemish Hercules, Ducrow, you know, dressed in light\r\nblue and silver, and--Miss Portman, I wish you had seen this--three\r\ngreat coach-wheels on his chin, and a ladder and two chairs and two\r\nchildren on them--and after that, he sported a musquet and bayonet with\r\nthe point of the bayonet on his chin--faith! that was really famous!\r\nBut I forgot the Pyrrhic dance, Miss Portman, which was damned fine\r\ntoo---danced in boots and spurs by those Hungarian fellows--they\r\njump and turn about, and clap their knees with their hands, and put\r\nthemselves in all sorts of ways--and then we had that song of Polly\r\nOliver, as I told you before, and Mrs. Mills gave us--no, no--it was\r\na drummer of the Staffordshire dressed as a gipsy girl, gave us _the\r\ncottage on the moor_, the most charming thing, and would suit your\r\nvoice, Miss Portman--damme, you\'d sing it like an angel----But where\r\nwas I?--Oh, then they had tea--and fireplaces built of brick, out in\r\nthe air--and then the entrance to the ball-room was all a colonnade\r\ndone with lamps and flowers, and that sort of thing--and there was\r\nsome bon-mot (but that was in the morning) amongst the gipsies about an\r\norange and the stadtholder--and then there was a Turkish dance, and a\r\nPolonese dance, all very fine, but nothing to come up to the\r\nPyrrhic touch, which was a great deal the most knowing, in boots and\r\nspurs--damme, now, I can\'t describe the thing to you, \'tis a cursed pity\r\nyou weren\'t there, damme."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour assured Sir Philip that she had been more entertained by\r\nthe description than she could have been by the reality.--"Clarence, was\r\nnot it the best description you ever heard? But pray favour us with _a\r\ntouch_ of the Pyrrhic dance, Sir Philip."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour spoke with such polite earnestness, and the baronet had so\r\nlittle penetration and so much conceit, that he did not suspect her\r\nof irony: he eagerly began to exhibit the Pyrrhic dance, but in such\r\na manner that it was impossible for human gravity to withstand the\r\nsight--Rochfort laughed first, Lady Delacour followed him, and Clarence\r\nHervey and Belinda could no longer restrain themselves.\r\n\r\n"Damme, now I believe you\'ve all been quizzing me," cried the baronet,\r\nand he fell into a sulky silence, eyeing Clarence Hervey and Miss\r\nPortman from time to time with what he meant for a _knowing_ look.\r\nHis silence and sulkiness lasted till Clarence took his leave. Soon\r\nafterward Belinda retired to the music-room. Sir Philip then begged to\r\nspeak a few words to Lady Delacour, with a face of much importance: and\r\nafter a preamble of nonsensical expletives, he said that his regard for\r\nher ladyship and Miss Portman made him wish to explain hints which had\r\nbeen dropped from him at times, and which he could not explain to her\r\nsatisfaction, without a promise of inviolable secresy. "As Hervey is or\r\nwas a sort of a friend, I can\'t mention this sort of thing without such\r\na preliminary."--Lady Delacour gave the preliminary promise, and Sir\r\nPhilip informed her, that people began to take notice that Hervey was\r\nan admirer of Miss Portman, and that it might be a disadvantage to the\r\nyoung lady, as Mr. Hervey could have no serious intentions, because he\r\nhad an attachment, to his certain knowledge, elsewhere.\r\n\r\n"A matrimonial attachment?" said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Why, damme, as to matrimony, I can\'t say; but the girl\'s so famously\r\nbeautiful, and Clary has been constant to her so many years----"\r\n\r\n"Many years! then she is not young?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, damme, yes, she is not more than seventeen,--and, let her be what\r\nelse she will, she\'s a famous fine girl. I had a sight of her once at\r\nWindsor, by stealth."\r\n\r\nAnd then the baronet described her after his manner.--"Where Clary keeps\r\nher now, I can\'t make out; but he has taken her away from Windsor. She\r\nwas then with a gouvernante, and is as proud as the devil, which smells\r\nlike matrimony for Clary."\r\n\r\n"And do you know this peerless damsel\'s name?"\r\n\r\n"I think the old Jezebel called her Miss St. Pierre--ay, damme, it was\r\nVirginia too--Virginia St. Pierre."\r\n\r\n"Virginia St. Pierre, a pretty romantic name," said Lady Delacour:\r\n"Miss Portman and I are extremely obliged by your attention to the\r\npreservation of our hearts, and I promise you we shall keep your counsel\r\nand our own."\r\n\r\nSir Philip then, with more than his usual complement of oaths,\r\npronounced Miss Portman to be the finest girl he had ever seen, and took\r\nhis leave.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Delacour repeated this story to Belinda, she concluded by\r\nsaying, "Now, my dear, you know Sir Philip Baddely has his own views\r\nin telling us all this--in telling _you_, all this; for evidently he\r\nadmires you, and consequently hates Clarence. So I believe only half the\r\nman says; and the other half, though it has made you turn so horribly\r\npale, my love, I consider as a thing of no manner of consequence to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Of no manner of consequence to me, I assure your ladyship," said\r\nBelinda; "I have always considered Mr. Hervey as--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, as a common acquaintance, no doubt--but we\'ll pass over all those\r\npretty speeches: I was going to say that this \'mistress in the wood\' can\r\nbe of no consequence to your happiness, because, whatever that fool Sir\r\nPhilip may think, Clarence Hervey is not a man to go and marry a\r\ngirl who has been his mistress for half a dozen years. Do not look so\r\nshocked, my dear--I really cannot help laughing. I congratulate\r\nyou, however, that the thing is no worse--it is all in rule and in\r\ncourse--when a man marries, he sets up new equipages, and casts off\r\nold mistresses; or if you like to see the thing as a woman of sentiment\r\nrather than as a woman of the world, here is the prettiest opportunity\r\nfor your lover\'s making a sacrifice. I am sorry I cannot make you smile,\r\nmy dear; but consider, as nobody knows this naughty thing but ourselves,\r\nwe are not called upon to bristle up our morality, and the most moral\r\nladies in the world do not expect men to be as moral as themselves:\r\nso we may suit the measure of our external indignation to our real\r\nfeelings. Sir Philip cannot stir in the business, for he knows Clarence\r\nwould call him out if his secret visit to Virginia were to come to light.\r\nI advise you _d\'aller votre train_ with Clarence, without seeming to\r\nsuspect him in the least; there is nothing like innocence in these\r\ncases, my dear: but I know by the Spanish haughtiness of your air\r\nat this instant, that you would sooner die the death of the\r\nsentimental--than follow my advice."\r\n\r\nBelinda, without any haughtiness, but with firm gentleness, replied,\r\nthat she had no designs whatever upon Mr. Hervey, and that therefore\r\nthere could be no necessity for any manoeuvring on her part;--that the\r\nambiguity of his conduct towards her had determined her long since to\r\nguard her affections, and that she had the satisfaction to feel that\r\nthey were entirely under her command.\r\n\r\n"That is a great satisfaction, indeed, my dear," said Lady Delacour.\r\n"It is a pity that your countenance, which is usually expressive\r\nenough, should not at this instant obey your wishes and express perfect\r\nfelicity. But though you feel no pain from disappointed affection,\r\ndoubtless the concern that you show arises from the necessity you are\r\nunder of withdrawing a portion of your esteem from Mr. Hervey--this\r\nis the style for you, is it not? After all, my dear, the whole maybe\r\na quizzification of Sir Philip\'s--and yet he gave me such a minute\r\ndescription of her person! I am sure the man has not invention or taste\r\nenough to produce such a fancy piece."\r\n\r\n"Did he mention," said Belinda, in a low voice, "the colour of her\r\nhair?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, light brown; but the colour of this hair seems to affect you more\r\nthan all the rest."\r\n\r\nHere, to Belinda\'s great relief, the conversation was interrupted by the\r\nentrance of Marriott. From all she had heard, but especially from the\r\nagreement between the colour of the hair which dropped from Hervey\'s\r\nletter with Sir Philip\'s description of Virginia\'s, Miss Portman was\r\nconvinced that Clarence had some secret attachment; and she could not\r\nhelp blaming him in her own mind for having, as she thought, endeavoured\r\nto gain her affections, whilst he knew that his heart was engaged to\r\nanother. Mr. Hervey, however, gave her no farther reason to suspect him\r\nof any design to win her love; for about this time his manner towards\r\nher changed,--he obviously endeavoured to avoid her; his visits were\r\nshort, and his attention was principally directed to Lady Delacour; when\r\nshe retired, he took his leave, and Sir Philip Baddely had the field to\r\nhimself. The baronet, who thought that he had succeeded in producing a\r\ncoldness between Belinda and his rival, was surprised to find that he\r\ncould not gain any advantage for himself; for some time he had not the\r\nslightest thoughts of any serious connexion with the lady, but at last\r\nhe was piqued by her indifference, and by the raillery of his friend\r\nRochfort.\r\n\r\n"\'Pon honour," said Rochfort, "the girl must be in love with Clary, for\r\nshe minds you no more than if you were nobody."\r\n\r\n"I could make her sing to another tune, if I pleased," said Sir Philip;\r\n"but, damme, it would cost me too much--a wife\'s too expensive a thing,\r\nnow-a-days. Why, a man could have twenty curricles, and a fine stud, and\r\na pack of hounds, and as many mistresses as he chooses into the bargain,\r\nfor what it would cost him to take a wife. Oh, damme, Belinda Portman\'s\r\na fine girl, but not worth so much as that comes to; and yet, confound\r\nme, if I should not like to see how blue Clary would look, if I were to\r\npropose for her in good earnest--hey, Rochfort?--I should like to pay\r\nhim for the way he served us about that quiz of a doctor, hey?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Rochfort, "you know he told us there was a _tant pis_ and a\r\n_tant mieux_ in every thing--he\'s not come to the _tant pis_ yet. \'Pon\r\nhonour, Sir Philip, the thing rests with you."\r\n\r\nThe baronet vibrated for some time between the fear of being taken in by\r\none of Mrs. Stanhope\'s nieces, and the hope of triumphing over Clarence\r\nHervey. At last, what he called love prevailed over prudence, and he was\r\nresolved, cost him what it would, to have Belinda Portman. He had not\r\nthe least doubt of being accepted, if he made a proposal of marriage;\r\nconsequently, the moment that he came to this determination, he could\r\nnot help assuming _d\'avance_ the tone of a favoured lover.\r\n\r\n"Damme," cried Sir Philip, one night, at Lady Delacour\'s concert,\r\n"I think that Mr. Hervey has taken out a patent for talking to Miss\r\nPortman; but damme if I give up this place, now I have got it," cried\r\nthe baronet, seating himself beside Belinda.\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey did not contest his seat, and Sir Philip kept his post during\r\nthe remainder of the concert; but, though he had the field entirely to\r\nhimself, he could not think of any thing more interesting, more amusing,\r\nto whisper in Belinda\'s ear, than, "Don\'t you think the candles want\r\nsnuffing famously?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE MACAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe baronet determined the next day upon the grand attack. He waited\r\nupon Miss Portman with the certainty of being favourably received; but\r\nhe was, nevertheless, somewhat embarrassed to know how to begin the\r\nconversation, when he found himself alone with the lady.\r\n\r\nHe twirled and twisted a short stick that he held in his hand, and\r\nput it into and out of his boot twenty times, and at last he began\r\nwith--"Lady Delacour\'s not gone to Harrowgate yet?"\r\n\r\n"No: her ladyship has not yet felt herself well enough to undertake the\r\njourney."\r\n\r\n"That was a cursed unlucky overturn! She may thank Clarence Hervey for\r\nthat: it\'s like him,--he thinks he\'s a better judge of horses, and wine,\r\nand every thing else, than any body in the world. Damme, now if I don\'t\r\nbelieve he thinks nobody else but himself has eyes enough to see that a\r\nfine woman\'s a fine woman; but I\'d have him to know, that Miss Belinda\r\nPortman has been Sir Philip Baddely\'s toast these two months."\r\n\r\nAs this intelligence did not seem to make the expected impression upon\r\nMiss Belinda Portman, Sir Philip had recourse again to his little stick,\r\nwith which he went through the sword exercise. After a silence of some\r\nminutes, and after walking to the window, and back again, as if to look\r\nfor sense, he exclaimed, "How is Mrs. Stanhope now, pray, Miss Portman?\r\nand your sister, Mrs. Tollemache? she was the finest woman, I thought,\r\nthe first winter she came out, that ever I saw, damme. Have you ever\r\nbeen told that you\'re like her?"\r\n\r\n"Never, sir."\r\n\r\n"Oh, damn it then, but you are; only ten times handsomer."\r\n\r\n"Ten times handsomer than the finest woman you ever saw, Sir Philip?"\r\nsaid Belinda, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Than the finest woman I had ever seen _then_," said Sir Philip; "for,\r\ndamme, I did not know what it was to be in love _then_" (here the\r\nbaronet heaved an audible sigh): "I always laughed at love, and all\r\nthat, _then_, and marriage particularly. I\'ll trouble you for Mrs.\r\nStanhope\'s direction, Miss Portman; I believe, to do the thing in style,\r\nI ought to write to her before I speak to you."\r\n\r\nBelinda looked at him with astonishment; and laying down the pencil\r\nwith which she had just begun to write a direction to Mrs. Stanhope,\r\nshe said, "Perhaps, Sir Philip, to _do the thing in style_, I ought to\r\npretend at this instant not to understand you; but such false delicacy\r\nmight mislead you: permit me, therefore, to say, that if I have\r\nany concern in the letter which you, are going to write to my aunt\r\nStanhope----"\r\n\r\n"Well guessed!" interrupted Sir Philip: "to be sure you have, and you\'re\r\na charming girl--damn me if you aren\'t--for meeting my ideas in this\r\nway, which will save a cursed deal of trouble," added the polite lover,\r\nseating himself on the sofa, beside Belinda.\r\n\r\n"To prevent your giving yourself any further trouble then, sir, on my\r\naccount," said Miss Portman----\r\n\r\n"Nay, damme, don\'t catch at that unlucky word, trouble, nor look so\r\ncursed angry; though it becomes you, too, uncommonly, and I like pride\r\nin a handsome woman, if it was only for variety\'s sake, for it\'s not\r\nwhat one meets with often, now-a-days. As to trouble, all I meant was,\r\nthe trouble of writing to Mrs. Stanhope, which of course I thank you for\r\nsaving me; for to be sure, I\'d rather (and you can\'t blame me for that)\r\nhave my answer from your own charming lips, if it was only for the\r\npleasure of seeing you blush in this heavenly sort of style."\r\n\r\n"To put an end to this heavenly sort of style, sir," said Belinda,\r\nwithdrawing her hand, which the baronet took as if he was confident of\r\nits being his willing prize, "I must explicitly assure you, that it is\r\nnot in my power to encourage your addresses. I am fully sensible," added\r\nMiss Portman, "of the honour Sir Philip Baddely has done me, and I hope\r\nhe will not be offended by the frankness of my answer."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t be in earnest, Miss Portman!" exclaimed the astonished\r\nbaronet.\r\n\r\n"Perfectly in earnest, Sir Philip."\r\n\r\n"Confusion seize me," cried he, starting up, "if this isn\'t the most\r\nextraordinary thing I ever heard! Will you do me the honour, madam, to\r\nlet me know your particular objections to Sir Philip Baddely?"\r\n\r\n"My objections," said Belinda, "cannot be obviated, and therefore it\r\nwould be useless to state them."\r\n\r\n"Nay, pray, ma\'am, do me the favour--I only ask for information sake--is\r\nit to Sir Philip Baddely\'s fortune, 15,000l. a year, you object, or\r\nto his family, or to his person?--Oh, curse it!" said he, changing his\r\ntone, "you\'re only quizzing me to see how I should look--damn me, you\r\ndid it too well, you little coquet!"\r\n\r\nBelinda again assured him that she was entirely in earnest, and that she\r\nwas incapable of the sort of coquetry which he ascribed to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, damme, ma\'am, then I\'ve no more to say--a coquet is a thing I\r\nunderstand as well as another, and if we had been only talking in the\r\nair, it would have been another thing; but when I come at once to a\r\nproposal in form, and a woman seriously tells me she has objections that\r\ncannot be obviated, damme, what must I, or what must the world conclude,\r\nbut that she\'s very unaccountable, or that she\'s engaged--which last I\r\npresume to be the case, and it would have been a satisfaction to me to\r\nhave known it sooner--at any rate, it is a satisfaction to me to know it\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to deprive you of so much satisfaction," said Miss Portman,\r\n"by assuring you, that I am not engaged to any one."\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Lord Delacour,\r\nwho came to inquire of Miss Portman how his lady did. The baronet, after\r\ntwisting his little black stick into all manner of shapes, finished by\r\nbreaking it, and then having no other resource, suddenly wished Miss\r\nPortman a good morning, and decamped with a look of silly ill-humour. He\r\nwas determined to write to Mrs. Stanhope, whose influence over her niece\r\nhe had no doubt would be decisive in his favour. "Sir Philip seems to\r\nbe a little out of sorts this morning," said Lord Delacour: "I am afraid\r\nhe\'s angry with me for interrupting his conversation; but really I did\r\nnot know he was here, and I wanted to catch you a moment alone, that\r\nI might, in the first place, thank you for all your goodness to Lady\r\nDelacour. She has had a tedious sprain of it; these nervous fevers\r\nand convulsions--I don\'t understand them, but I think Dr. X----\'s\r\nprescriptions seem to have done her good, for she is certainly better of\r\nlate, and I am glad to hear music and people again in the house,\r\nbecause I know all this is what my Lady Delacour likes, and there is\r\nno reasonable indulgence that I would not willingly allow a wife; but I\r\nthink there is a medium in all things. I am not a man to be governed\r\nby a wife, and when I have once said a thing, I like to be steady and\r\nalways shall. And I am sure Miss Portman has too much good sense to\r\nthink me wrong: for now, Miss Portman, in that quarrel about the coach\r\nand horses, which you heard part of one morning at breakfast--I must\r\ntell you the beginning of that quarrel."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, my lord, but I would rather hear of the end than of the\r\nbeginning of quarrels."\r\n\r\n"That shows your good sense as well as your good nature. I wish you\r\ncould make my Lady Delacour of your taste--she does not want sense--but\r\nthen (I speak to you freely of all that lies upon my mind, Miss Portman,\r\nfor I know--I _know_ you have no delight in making mischief in a house,)\r\nbetween you and me, her sense is not of the right kind. A woman may\r\nhave too much wit--now too much is as bad as too little, and in a woman,\r\nworse; and when two people come to quarrel, then wit on either side,\r\nbut more especially on the wife\'s, you know is very provoking--\'tis like\r\nconcealed weapons, which are wisely forbidden by law. If a person kill\r\nanother in a fray, with a concealed weapon, ma\'am, by a sword in a cane,\r\nfor instance, \'tis murder by the law. Now even if it were not contrary\r\nto law, I would never have such a thing in my cane to carry about with\r\nme; for when a man\'s in a passion he forgets every thing, and would as\r\nsoon lay about him with a sword as with a cane: so it is better such\r\na thing should not be in his power. And it is the same with wit, which\r\nwould be safest and best out of the power of some people."\r\n\r\n"But is it fair, my lord, to make use of wit yourself to abuse wit in\r\nothers?" said Belinda with a smile, which put his lordship into perfect\r\ngood-humour with both himself and his lady.\r\n\r\n"Why, really," said he, "there would be no living with Lady Delacour, if\r\nI did not come out with a little sly bit of wit now and then; but it is\r\nwhat I am not in the habit of doing, I assure you, except when very\r\nhard pushed. But, Miss Portman, as you like so much to hear the end of\r\nquarrels, here\'s the end of one which you have a particular right to\r\nhear something of," continued his lordship, taking out his pocket-book\r\nand producing some bank-notes: "you should have received this before,\r\nmadam, if I had known of the transaction sooner--of your part of it, I\r\nmean."\r\n\r\n"Milord, de man call to speak about de burgundy you order, milord," said\r\nChampfort, who came into the room with a sly, inquisitive face.\r\n\r\n"Tell him I\'ll see him immediately--show him into the parlour, and give\r\nhim a newspaper to read."\r\n\r\n"Yes, milord--milord has it in his pocket since he dress."\r\n\r\n"Here it is," said his lordship; and as Champfort came forward to\r\nreceive the newspaper, his eye glanced at the bank-notes, and then at\r\nMiss Portman.\r\n\r\n"Here," continued Lord Delacour, as Champfort had left the room, "here\r\nare your two hundred guineas, Miss Portman; and as I am going to this\r\nman about my burgundy, and shall be out all the rest of the day, let\r\nme trouble you the next time you see Lady Delacour to give her this\r\npocket-book from me. I should be sorry that Miss Portman, from any thing\r\nthat has passed, should run away with the idea that I am a niggardly\r\nhusband, or a tyrant, though I certainly like to be master in my own\r\nhouse. What are you doing, madam?--that is your note, that does not go\r\ninto the pocket-book, you know."\r\n\r\n"Permit me to put it in, my lord," said Belinda, returning the\r\npocket-book to him, "and to beg you will give Lady Delacour the pleasure\r\nof seeing you: she has inquired several times whether your lordship were\r\nat home. I will run up to her dressing-room, and tell her that you are\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"How lightly she goes on the wings of good-nature!" said Lord Delacour.\r\n"I can do no less than follow her; for though I like to be treated with\r\nrespect in my own house, there is a time for every thing. I would\r\nnot give Lady Delacour the trouble of coming down here to me with her\r\nsprained ankle, especially as she has inquired for me several times."\r\n\r\nHis lordship\'s visit was not of unseasonable length; for he recollected\r\nthat the man who came about the burgundy was waiting for him. But,\r\nperhaps, the shortness of the visit rendered it the more pleasing, for\r\nLady Delacour afterward said to Belinda, "My dear, would you believe\r\nit, my Lord Delacour was absolutely a perfect example of the useful\r\nand agreeable this morning--who knows but he may become the sublime and\r\nbeautiful in time? _En attendant_ here are your two hundred guineas,\r\nmy dear Belinda: a thousand thanks for the thing, and a million for the\r\nmanner--manner is all in all in conferring favours. My lord, who, to do\r\nhim justice, has too much honesty to pretend to more delicacy than he\r\nreally possesses, told me that he had been taking a lesson from Miss\r\nPortman this morning in the art of obliging; and really, for a grown\r\ngentleman, and for the first lesson, he comes on surprisingly. I do\r\nthink, that by the time he is a widower his lordship will be quite\r\nanother thing, quite an agreeable man--not a genius, not a Clarence\r\nHervey--that you cannot expect. Apropos, what is the reason that we have\r\nseen so little of Clarence Hervey lately? He has certainly some secret\r\nattraction elsewhere. It cannot be that girl Sir Philip mentioned; no,\r\nshe\'s nothing new. Can it be at Lady Anne Percival\'s?--or where can it\r\nbe? Whenever he sees me, I think he asks when we go to Harrowgate. Now\r\nOakly-park is within a few miles of Harrowgate. I will not go there,\r\nthat\'s decided. Lady Anne is an exemplary matron, so she is out of the\r\ncase; but I hope she has no _sister excellence_, no niece, no cousin, to\r\nentangle our hero."\r\n\r\n"Ours!" said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Well, _yours_, then," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Mine!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yours: I never in my life saw a better struggle between a sigh\r\nand a smile. But what have you done to poor Sir Philip Baddely? My Lord\r\nDelacour told me--you know all people who have nothing else to say,\r\ntell news quicker than others--my Lord Delacour told me, that he saw Sir\r\nPhilip part from you this morning in a terrible bad humour. Come, whilst\r\nyou tell your story, help me to string these pearls; that will save you\r\nfrom the necessity of looking at me, and will conceal your blushes: you\r\nneed not be afraid of betraying Sir Philip\'s secrets; for I could have\r\ntold you long ago, that he would inevitably propose for you--the fact\r\nis nothing new or surprising to me, but I should really like to hear how\r\nridiculous the man made himself."\r\n\r\n"And that," said Belinda, "is the only thing which I do not wish to tell\r\nyour ladyship."\r\n\r\n"Lord, my dear, surely it is no secret that Sir Philip Baddely is\r\nridiculous; but you are so good-natured that I can\'t be out of humour\r\nwith you. If you won\'t gratify my curiosity, will you gratify my taste,\r\nand sing for me once more that charming song which none but you _can_\r\nsing to please me?--I must learn it from you, absolutely."\r\n\r\nJust as Belinda was beginning to sing, Marriott\'s macaw began to scream,\r\nso that Lady Delacour could not hear any thing else.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that odious macaw!" cried her ladyship, "I can endure it no longer"\r\n(and she rang her bell violently): "it kept me from sleeping all last\r\nnight--Marriott must give up this bird. Marriott, I cannot endure that\r\nmacaw--you must part with it for my sake, Marriott. It cost you four\r\nguineas: I am sure I would give five with the greatest pleasure to get\r\nrid of it, for it is the torment of my life."\r\n\r\n"Dear, my lady! I can assure you it is only because they will not shut\r\nthe doors after them below, as I desire. I am certain Mr. Champfort\r\nnever shut a door after him in his life, nor never will if he was to\r\nlive to the days of Methuselah."\r\n\r\n"That is very little satisfaction to me, Marriott," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"And indeed, my lady, it is very little satisfaction to me, to hear my\r\nmacaw abused as it is every day of my life, for Mr. Champfort\'s fault."\r\n\r\n"But it cannot be Champfort\'s fault that I have ears."\r\n\r\n"But if the doors were shut, my lady, you wouldn\'t or couldn\'t hear--as\r\nI\'ll prove immediately," said Marriott, and she ran directly and shut,\r\naccording to her own account, "eleven doors which were stark staring\r\nwide open."--"Now, my lady, you can\'t hear a single syllable of the\r\nmacaw."\r\n\r\n"No, but one of the eleven doors will open presently," said Lady\r\nDelacour: "you will observe it is always more than ten to one against\r\nme."\r\n\r\nA door opened, and the macaw was heard to scream. "The macaw must go,\r\nMarriott, that is certain," said her ladyship, firmly.\r\n\r\n"Then _I_ must go, my lady," said Marriott, angrily, "that is certain;\r\nfor to part with my macaw is a thing I cannot do to please _any_ body."\r\nHer eyes turned with indignation upon Belinda, from association merely;\r\nbecause the last time that she had been angry about her macaw, she had\r\nalso been angry with Miss Portman, whom she imagined to be the secret\r\nenemy of her favourite.\r\n\r\n"To stay another week in the house after my macaw\'s discarded in\r\ndisgrace is a thing nothing shall prevail upon me to do." She flung out\r\nof the room in a fury.\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens! am I reduced to this?" said Lady Delacour: "she thinks\r\nthat she has me in her power. No; I can die without her: I have but a\r\nshort time to live--I will not live a slave. Let the woman betray me,\r\nif she will. Follow her this moment, my dear generous friend; tell\r\nher never to come into this room again: take this pocket-book, pay\r\nher whatever is due to her in the first place, and give her fifty\r\nguineas--observe!--not as a bribe, but as a reward."\r\n\r\nIt was a delicate and difficult commission. Belinda found Marriott at\r\nfirst incapable of listening to reason. "I am sure there is nobody in\r\nthe world that would treat me and my macaw in this manner, except my\r\nlady," cried she; "and somebody must have set her against me, for it is\r\nnot natural to her: but since she can\'t bear me about her any longer,\r\n\'tis time I should be gone."\r\n\r\n"The only thing of which Lady Delacour complained was the noise of this\r\nmacaw," said Belinda; "it was a pretty bird--how long have you had it?"\r\n\r\n"Scarcely a month," said Marriott, sobbing.\r\n\r\n"And how long have you lived with your lady?"\r\n\r\n"Six years!--And to part with her after all!--"\r\n\r\n"And for the sake of a macaw! And at a time when your lady is so much in\r\nwant of you, Marriott! You know she cannot live long, and she has much\r\nto suffer before she dies, and if you leave her, and if in a fit of\r\npassion you betray the confidence she has placed in you, you will\r\nreproach yourself for it ever afterward. This bird--or all the birds\r\nin the world--will not be able to console you; for you are of an\r\naffectionate disposition, I know, and sincerely attached to your poor\r\nlady."\r\n\r\n"That I am!--and to betray her!--Oh, Miss Portman, I would sooner cut\r\noff my hand than do it. And I have been tried more than my lady knows\r\nof, or you either, for Mr. Champfort, who is the greatest mischief-maker\r\nin the world, and is the cause, by not shutting the door, of all this\r\ndilemma; for now, ma\'am, I\'m convinced, by the tenderness of your\r\nspeaking, that you are not the enemy to me I supposed, and I beg your\r\npardon; but I was going to say that Mr. Champfort, who saw the _fracas_\r\nbetween my lord and me, about the key and the door, the night of my\r\nlady\'s accident, has whispered it about at Lady Singleton\'s and every\r\nwhere--Mrs. Luttridge\'s maid, ma\'am, who is my cousin, has pestered me\r\nwith so many questions and offers, from Mrs. Luttridge and Mrs. Freke,\r\nof any money, if I would only tell who was in the boudoir--and I have\r\nalways answered, nobody--and I defy them to get any thing out of me.\r\nBetray my lady! I\'d sooner cut my tongue out this minute! Can she have\r\nsuch a base opinion of me, or can you, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, I am convinced that you are incapable of betraying her,\r\nMarriott; but in all probability after you have left her----"\r\n\r\n"If my lady would let me keep my macaw," interrupted Marriott, "I should\r\nnever think of leaving her."\r\n\r\n"The macaw she will not suffer to remain in the house, nor is it\r\nreasonable that she should: it deprives her of sleep--it kept her awake\r\nthree hours this morning."\r\n\r\nMarriott was beginning the history of Champfort and the doors again; but\r\nMiss Portman stopped her by saying, "All this is past now. How much is\r\ndue to you, Mrs. Marriott? Lady Delacour has commissioned me to pay you\r\nevery thing that is due to you."\r\n\r\n"Due to me! Lord bless me, ma\'am, am I to go?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, it was your own desire--it is consequently your lady\'s: she\r\nis perfectly sensible of your attachment to her, and of your services,\r\nbut she cannot suffer herself to be treated with disrespect. Here are\r\nfifty guineas, which she gives you as a reward for your past fidelity,\r\nnot as a bribe to secure your future secresy. You are at liberty, she\r\ndesires me to say, to tell her secret to the whole world, if you choose\r\nto do so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Portman, take my macaw--do what you will with it--only make my\r\npeace with my lady," cried Marriott, clasping her hands, in an agony of\r\ngrief: "here are the fifty guineas, ma\'am, don\'t leave them with me--I\r\nwill never be disrespectful again--take my macaw and all! No, I will\r\ncarry it myself to my lady."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour was surprised by the sudden entrance of Marriott, and her\r\nmacaw. The chain which held the bird Marriott put into her ladyship\'s\r\nhand without being able to say any thing more than, "Do what you please,\r\nmy lady, with it--and with me."\r\n\r\nPacified by this submission, Lady Delacour granted Marriott\'s pardon,\r\nand she most sincerely rejoiced at this reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThe next day Belinda asked the dowager Lady Boucher, who was going to a\r\nbird-fancier\'s, to take her with her, in hopes that she might be able to\r\nmeet with some bird more musical than a macaw, to console Marriott for\r\nthe loss of her screaming favourite. Lady Delacour commissioned Miss\r\nPortman to go to any price she pleased. "If I were able, I would\r\naccompany you myself, my dear, for poor Marriott\'s sake, though I would\r\nalmost as soon go to the Augean stable."\r\n\r\nThere was a bird-fancier in High Holborn, who had bought several of the\r\nhundred and eighty beautiful birds, which, as the newspapers of the\r\nday advertised, had been "collected, after great labour and expense,\r\nby Mons. Marten and Co. for the Republican Museum at Paris, and lately\r\nlanded out of the French brig Urselle, taken on her voyage from Cayenne\r\nto Brest, by His Majesty\'s Ship Unicorn."\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Boucher and Belinda arrived at this bird-fancier\'s, they were\r\nlong in doubt to which of the feathered beauties they should give\r\nthe preference. Whilst the dowager was descanting upon their various\r\nperfections, a lady and three children came in; she immediately\r\nattracted Belinda\'s attention, by her likeness to Clarence Hervey\'s\r\ndescription of Lady Anne Percival--it was Lady Anne, as Lady Boucher,\r\nwho was slightly acquainted with her, informed Belinda in a whisper.\r\n\r\nThe children were soon eagerly engaged looking at the birds.\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman," said Lady Boucher, "as Lady Delacour is so far from\r\nwell, and wishes to have a bird that will not make any noise in the\r\nhouse, suppose you were to buy for Mrs. Marriott this beautiful pair of\r\ngreen parroquets; or, stay, a goldfinch is not very noisy, and here is\r\none that can play a thousand pretty tricks. Pray, sir, make it draw up\r\nwater in its little bucket for us."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma!" said one of the little boys, "this is the very thing that\r\nis mentioned in Bewick\'s History of Birds. Pray look at this goldfinch,\r\nHelena, now it is drawing up its little bucket--but where is Helena?\r\nhere\'s room for you, Helena."\r\n\r\nWhilst the little boys were looking at the goldfinch, Belinda felt\r\nsomebody touch her gently: it was Helena Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Can I speak a few words to you?" said Helena.\r\n\r\nBelinda walked to the farthest end of the shop with her.\r\n\r\n"Is my mamma better?" said she, in a timid tone. "I have some gold fish,\r\nwhich you know cannot make the least noise: may I send them to her? I\r\nheard that lady call you Miss Portman: I believe you are the lady who\r\nwrote such a kind postscript to me in mamma\'s last letter--that is the\r\nreason I speak so freely to you now. Perhaps you would write to tell me\r\nif mamma will see me; and Lady Anne Percival would take me at any time,\r\nI am sure--but she goes to Oakly-park in a few days. I wish I might\r\nbe with mamma whilst she is ill; I would not make the least noise. But\r\ndon\'t ask her, if you think it will be troublesome--only let me send the\r\ngold fish."\r\n\r\nBelinda was touched by the manner in which this affectionate little girl\r\nspoke to her. She assured her that she would say all she wished to\r\nher mother, and she begged Helena to send the gold fish whenever she\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n"Then," said Helena, "I will send them as soon as I go _home_ as soon\r\nas I go back to Lady Anne Percival\'s, I mean." Belinda, when she had\r\nfinished speaking to Helena, heard the man who was showing the birds,\r\nlament that he had not a blue macaw, which Lady Anne Percival was\r\ncommissioned to procure for Mrs. Margaret Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Red macaws, my lady, I have in abundance; but unfortunately, a blue\r\nmacaw I really have not at present; nor have I been able to get one,\r\nthough I have inquired amongst all the bird-fanciers in town; and I went\r\nto the auction at Haydon-square on purpose, but could not get one."\r\n\r\nBelinda requested Lady Boucher would tell her servants to bring in the\r\ncage that contained Marriott\'s blue macaw; and as soon as it was brought\r\nshe gave it to Helena, and begged that she would carry it to her Aunt\r\nDelacour.\r\n\r\n"Lord, my dear Miss Portman," said Lady Boucher, drawing her aside, "I\r\nam afraid you will get yourself into a scrape; for Lady Delacour is not\r\nupon speaking terms with this Mrs. Margaret Delacour--she cannot endure\r\nher; you know she is my Lord Delacour\'s aunt."\r\n\r\nBelinda persisted in sending the macaw, for she was in hopes that\r\nthese terrible family quarrels might be made up, if either party would\r\ncondescend to show any disposition to oblige the other.\r\n\r\nLady Anne Percival understood Miss Portman\'s civility as it was meant.\r\n\r\n"This is a bird of good omen," said she; "it augurs family peace."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would do me the favour, Lady Boucher, to introduce me to\r\nMiss Portman," continued Lady Anne.\r\n\r\n"The very thing I wished!" cried Helena.\r\n\r\nA few minutes\' conversation passed afterward upon different subjects,\r\nand Lady Anne Percival and Belinda parted with a mutual desire to see\r\nmore of each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSORTES VIRGILIANAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Belinda got home, Lady Delacour was busy in the library looking\r\nover a collection of French plays with the _ci-devant_ Count de N----;\r\na gentleman who possessed such singular talents for reading dramatic\r\ncompositions, that many people declared that they would rather hear him\r\nread a play than see it performed at the theatre. Even those who were\r\nnot judges of his merit, and who had little taste for literature,\r\ncrowded to hear him, because it was the fashion. Lady Delacour engaged\r\nhim for a reading party at her house, and he was consulting with her\r\nwhat play would be most amusing to his audience. "My dear Belinda! I am\r\nglad you are come to give us your opinion," said her ladyship; "no one\r\nhas a better taste: but first I should ask you what you have done at\r\nyour bird-fancier\'s; I hope you have brought home some _horned cock_[5],\r\nor some _monstrously_ beautiful creature for Marriott. If it has not a\r\nvoice like the macaw I shall be satisfied; but even if it be the bird\r\nof paradise, I question whether Marriott will like it as well as its\r\nscreaming predecessor."\r\n\r\n"I am sure she will like what is coming for her," said Belinda, "and\r\nso will your ladyship; but do not let me interrupt you and monsieur le\r\nComte." And as she spoke, she took up a volume of plays which lay upon\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n"Nanine, or La Prude, which shall we have?" said Lady Delacour: "or what\r\ndo you think of L\'Ecossaise?"\r\n\r\n"The scene of L\'Ecossaise is laid in London," said Belinda; "I should\r\nthink with an English audience it would therefore be popular."\r\n\r\n"Yes! so it will," said Lady Delacour: "then let it be L\'Ecossaise. M.\r\nle Comte I am sure will do justice to the character of _Friport_ the\r\nEnglishman, \'qui scait donner, mais qui ne scait pas vivre.\' My dear, I\r\nforgot to tell you that Clarence Hervey has been here: it is a pity you\r\ndid not come a little sooner, you would have heard a charming scene of\r\nthe School for Scandal read by him. M. le Comte was quite delighted; but\r\nClarence was in a great hurry, he would only give us one scene, he was\r\ngoing to Mr. Percival\'s on business. I am sure what I told you the other\r\nday is true: but, however, he has promised to come back to dine with\r\nme--M. le Comte, you will dine with us, I hope?"\r\n\r\nThe count was extremely sorry that it was impossible--he was engaged.\r\nBelinda suddenly recollected that it was time to dress for dinner; but\r\njust as the count took his leave, and as she was going up stairs, a\r\nfootman met her, and told her that Mr. Hervey was in the drawing-room,\r\nand wished to speak to her. Many conjectures were formed in Belinda\'s\r\nmind as she passed on to the drawing-room; but the moment that she\r\nopened the door, she knew the nature of Mr. Hervey\'s business, for she\r\nsaw the glass globe containing Helena Delacour\'s gold fishes standing on\r\nthe table beside him. "I have been commissioned to present these to\r\nyou for Lady Delacour," said Mr. Hervey, "and I have seldom received\r\na commission that has given me so much pleasure. I perceive that Miss\r\nPortman is indeed a real friend to Lady Delacour--how happy she is to\r\nhave such a friend!"\r\n\r\nAfter a pause Mr. Hervey went on speaking of Lady Delacour, and of his\r\nearnest desire to see her as happy in domestic life as she _appeared_\r\nto be in public. He frankly confessed, that when he was first acquainted\r\nwith her ladyship, he had looked upon her merely as a dissipated woman\r\nof fashion, and he had considered only his own amusement in cultivating\r\nher society: "But," continued he, "of late I have formed a different\r\nopinion of her character; and I think, from what I have observed, that\r\nMiss Portman\'s ideas on this subject agree with mine. I had laid a plan\r\nfor making her ladyship acquainted with Lady Anne Percival, who\r\nappears to me one of the most amiable and one of the happiest of women.\r\nOakly-park is but a few miles from Harrowgate.--But I am disappointed in\r\nthis scheme; Lady Delacour has changed her mind, she says, and will not\r\ngo there. Lady Anne, however, has just told me, that, though it is July,\r\nand though she loves the country, she will most willingly stay in town\r\na month longer, as she thinks that, with your assistance, there is some\r\nprobability of her effecting a reconciliation between Lady Delacour\r\nand her husband\'s relations, with some of whom Lady Anne is intimately\r\nacquainted. To begin with my friend, Mrs. Margaret Delacour: the macaw\r\nwas most graciously received, and I flatter myself that I have prepared\r\nMrs. Delacour to think somewhat more favourably of her niece than she\r\nwas wont to do. All now depends upon Lady Delacour\'s conduct towards\r\nher daughter: if she continues to treat her with neglect, I shall be\r\nconvinced that I have been mistaken in her character."\r\n\r\nBelinda was much pleased by the openness and the unaffected good-nature\r\nwith which Clarence Hervey spoke, and she certainly was not sorry\r\nto hear from his own lips a distinct explanation of his views and\r\nsentiments. She assured him that no effort that she could make with\r\npropriety should be wanting to effect the desirable reconciliation\r\nbetween her ladyship and her family, as she perfectly agreed with him in\r\nthinking that Lady Delacour\'s character had been generally misunderstood\r\nby the world.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr. Hervey, "her connexion with that Mrs. Freke hurt her\r\nmore in the eyes of the world than she was aware of. It is tacitly\r\nunderstood by the public, that every lady goes bail for the character\r\nof her female friends. If Lady Delacour had been so fortunate as to meet\r\nwith such a friend as Miss Portman in her early life, what a different\r\nwoman she would have been! She once said some such thing to me herself,\r\nand she never appeared to me so amiable as at that moment."\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey pronounced these last words in a manner more than usually\r\nanimated; and whilst he spoke, Belinda stooped to gather a sprig from a\r\nmyrtle, which stood on the hearth. She perceived that the myrtle, which\r\nwas planted in a large china vase, was propped up on one side with the\r\nbroken bits of Sir Philip Baddely\'s little stick: she took them up, and\r\nthrew them out of the window. "Lady Delacour stuck those fragments there\r\nthis morning," said Clarence smiling, "as trophies. She told me of Miss\r\nPortman\'s victory over the heart of Sir Philip Baddely; and Miss Portman\r\nshould certainly have allowed them to remain there, as indisputable\r\nevidence in favour of the baronet\'s taste and judgment."\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey appeared under some embarrassment, and seemed to be\r\nrestrained by some secret cause from laying open his real feelings:\r\nhis manner varied continually. Belinda could not avoid seeing his\r\nperplexity--she had recourse again to the gold fishes and to Helena:\r\nupon these subjects they could both speak very fluently. Lady Delacour\r\nmade her appearance by the time that Clarence had finished repeating\r\nthe Abbe Nollet\'s experiments, which he had heard from his friend Doctor\r\nX----.\r\n\r\n"Now, Miss Portman, the transmission of sound in water," said\r\nClarence----\r\n\r\n"Deep in philosophy, I protest!" said Lady Delacour, as she came in.\r\n"What is this about the transmission of sound in water?--Ha! whence come\r\nthese pretty gold fishes?"\r\n\r\n"These gold fishes," said Belinda, "are come to console Marriott for the\r\nloss of her macaw."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my dear Belinda, for these mute comforters," said her\r\nladyship; "the very best things you could have chosen."\r\n\r\n"I have not the merit of the choice," said Belinda, "but I am heartily\r\nglad that you approve of it."\r\n\r\n"Pretty creatures," said Lady Delacour: "no fish were ever so pretty\r\nsince the days of the prince of the Black Islands in the Arabian Tales.\r\nAnd am I obliged to you, Clarence, for these subjects?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have only had the honour of bringing them to your ladyship\r\nfrom----"\r\n\r\n"From whom?--Amongst all my numerous acquaintance, have I one in the\r\nworld who cares a gold fish about me?--Stay, don\'t tell me, let\r\nme guess----Lady Newland?--No; you shake your heads. I guessed her\r\nladyship, merely because I know she wants to bribe me some way or other\r\nto go to one of her stupid entertainments; she wants to pick out of\r\nme taste enough to spend a fortune. But you say it was not Lady\r\nNewland?--Mrs. Hunt then perhaps? for she has two daughters whom she\r\nwants me to ask to my concerts. It was not Mrs. Hunt?--Well, then, it\r\nwas Mrs. Masterson; for she has a mind to go with me to Harrowgate,\r\nwhere, by-the-bye, I shall not go; so I won\'t cheat her out of her gold\r\nfishes; it was Mrs. Masterson, hey?"\r\n\r\n"No. But these little gold fishes came from a person who would be very\r\nglad to go with you to Harrowgate!" said Clarence Hervey. "Or who would\r\nbe very glad to stay with you in town," said Belinda: "from a person who\r\nwants nothing from you but--your love."\r\n\r\n"Male or female?" said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Female."\r\n\r\n"Female? I have not a female friend in the world but yourself, my dear\r\nBelinda; nor do I know another female in the world, whose love I should\r\nthink about for half an instant. But pray tell me the name of this\r\nunknown friend of mine, who wants nothing from me but love."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," said Belinda; "I cannot tell her name, unless you will\r\npromise to see her."\r\n\r\n"You have really made me impatient to see her," said Lady Delacour: "but\r\nI am not able to go out, you know, yet; and with a new acquaintance, one\r\nmust go through the ceremony of a morning visit. Now, _en conscience_,\r\nis it worth while?"\r\n\r\n"Very well worth while," cried Belinda and Clarence Hervey, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, pardi! as M. le Comte exclaims continually, Ah, pardi! You are both\r\nwonderfully interested in this business. It is some sister, niece,\r\nor cousin of Lady Anne Percival\'s; or--no, Belinda looks as if I were\r\nwrong. Then, perhaps, it is Lady Anne herself?--Well, take me where you\r\nplease, my dear Belinda, and introduce me where you please: I depend on\r\nyour taste and judgment in all things; but I really am not yet able to\r\npay morning visits."\r\n\r\n"The ceremony of a morning visit is quite unnecessary here," said\r\nBelinda: "I will introduce the unknown friend to you to-morrow, if you\r\nwill let me invite her to your reading-party."\r\n\r\n"With pleasure. She is some charming emigree of Clarence Hervey\'s\r\nacquaintance. But where did you meet with her this morning? You have\r\nboth of you conspired to puzzle me. Take it upon yourselves, then, if\r\nthis new acquaintance should not, as Ninon de l\'Enclos used to say,\r\n_quit cost_. If she be half as agreeable and _graceful_, Clarence, as\r\nMadame la Comtesse de Pomenars, I should not think her acquaintance too\r\ndearly purchased by a dozen morning visits."\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted by a thundering knock at the door.\r\n\r\n"Whose carriage is it?" said Lady Delacour. "Oh! Lady Newland\'s\r\nostentatious livery; and here is her ladyship getting out of her\r\ncarriage as awkwardly as if she had never been in one before.\r\nOverdressed, like a true city dame! Pray, Clarence, look at her,\r\nentangled in her bale of gold muslin, and conscious of her bulse of\r\ndiamonds!--\'Worth, if I\'m worth a farthing, five hundred thousand pounds\r\nbank currency!\' she says or seems to say, whenever she comes into a\r\nroom. Now let us see her entree--"\r\n\r\n"But, my dear," cried Lady Delacour, starting at the sight of Belinda,\r\nwho was still in her morning dress, "absolutely below par!--Make your\r\nescape to Marriott, I conjure you, by all your fears of the contempt\r\nof a lady, who will at the first look estimate you, _au juste_, to a\r\nfarthing a yard."\r\n\r\nAs she left the room, Belinda heard Clarence Hervey repeat to Lady\r\nDelacour--\r\n\r\n    "Give me a look, give me a face,\r\n    That makes simplicity a grace;\r\n    Robes loosely flowing, hair as free--"\r\n\r\nhe paused--but Belinda recollected the remainder of the stanza--\r\n\r\n    "Such sweet neglect more taketh me\r\n    Than all th\'adulteries of art,\r\n    That strike mine eyes, but not mine heart."\r\n\r\nIt was observed, that Miss Portman dressed herself this day with the\r\nmost perfect simplicity.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour\'s curiosity was raised by the description which Belinda\r\nand Clarence Hervey had given of the new acquaintance who sent her the\r\ngold fishes, and who wanted nothing from her but her love.\r\n\r\nMiss Portman told her that the _unknown_ would probably come half an\r\nhour earlier to the reading-party than any of the rest of the company.\r\nHer ladyship was alone in the library, when Lady Anne Percival brought\r\nHelena, in consequence of a note from Belinda.\r\n\r\nMiss Portman ran down stairs to the hall to receive her: the little girl\r\ntook her hand in silence. "Your mother was much pleased with the pretty\r\ngold fishes," said Belinda, "and she will be still more pleased, when\r\nshe knows that they came from you:--she does not know _that_ yet."\r\n\r\n"I hope she is better to-day? I will not make the least noise,"\r\nwhispered Helena, as she went up stairs on tiptoe.\r\n\r\n"You need not be afraid to make a noise--you need not walk on tiptoe,\r\nnor shut the doors softly; for Lady Delacour seems to like all noises\r\nexcept the screaming of the macaw. This way, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I forgot--it is so long since!--Is mamma up and dressed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. She has had concerts and balls since her illness. You will hear a\r\nplay read to-night," said Belinda, "by that French gentleman whom Lady\r\nAnne Percival mentioned to me yesterday."\r\n\r\n"But there is a great deal of company, then, with mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody is with her now: so come into the library with me," said\r\nBelinda. "Lady Delacour, here is the young lady who sent you the gold\r\nfishes."\r\n\r\n"Helena!" cried Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"You must, I am sure, acknowledge that Mr. Hervey was in the right, when\r\nhe said that the lady was a striking resemblance of your ladyship."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hervey knows how to flatter. I never had that ingenuous\r\ncountenance, even in my best days: but certainly the hair of her head\r\nis like mine--and her hands and arms. But why do you tremble, Helena? Is\r\nthere any thing so very terrible in the looks of your mother?"\r\n\r\n"No, only------"\r\n\r\n"Only what, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Only--I was afraid--you might not like me."\r\n\r\n"Who has filled your little foolish head with these vain fears? Come,\r\nsimpleton, kiss me, and tell me how comes it that you are not at\r\nOakly-hall, or--What\'s the name of the place?--Oakly-park?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Anne Percival would not take me out of town, she said, whilst you\r\nwere ill; because she thought that you might wish--I mean she thought\r\nthat I should like to see you--if you pleased."\r\n\r\n"Lady Anne is very good--very obliging--very considerate."\r\n\r\n"She is _very_ good-natured," said Helena.\r\n\r\n"You love this Lady Anne Percival, I perceive."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, that I do. She has been so kind to me! I love her as if she\r\nwere----"\r\n\r\n"As if she _were_--What? finish your sentence."\r\n\r\n"My mother," said Helena, in a low voice, and she blushed.\r\n\r\n"You love her as well as if she were your mother," repeated Lady\r\nDelacour: "that is intelligible: speak intelligibly whatever you say,\r\nand never leave a sentence unfinished."\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Nothing can be more ill-bred, nor more absurd; for it shows that you\r\nhave the wish without the power to conceal your sentiments. Pray, my\r\ndear," continued Lady Delacour, "go to Oakly-park immediately--all\r\nfarther ceremony towards me may be spared."\r\n\r\n"Ceremony, mamma!" said the little girl, and the tears came into her\r\neyes. Belinda sighed; and for some moments there was a dead silence.\r\n\r\n"I mean only to say, Miss Portman," resumed Lady Delacour, "that I hate\r\nceremony: but I know that there are people in the world who love it, who\r\nthink all virtue, and all affection, depend on ceremony--who are\r\n\r\n    \'Content to dwell in _decencies_ for ever.\'\r\n\r\nI shall not dispute their merits. Verily, they have their reward in the\r\ngood opinion and good word of all little minds, that is to say, of above\r\nhalf the world. I envy them not their hard-earned fame. Let ceremony\r\ncurtsy to ceremony with Chinese decorum; but, when ceremony expects to\r\nbe paid with affection, I beg to be excused."\r\n\r\n"Ceremony sets no value upon affection, and therefore would not desire\r\nto be paid with it," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Never yet," continued lady Delacour, pursuing the train of her own\r\nthoughts without attending to Belinda, "never yet was any thing like\r\nreal affection won by any of these ceremonious people."\r\n\r\n"Never," said Miss Portman, looking at Helena; who, having quickness\r\nenough to perceive that her mother aimed this _tirade_ against ceremony\r\nat Lady Anne Percival, sat in the most painful embarrassment, her eyes\r\ncast down, and her face and neck colouring all over. "Never yet," said\r\nMiss Portman, "did mere ceremonious person win any thing like real\r\naffection; especially from children, who are often excellent, because\r\nunprejudiced, judges of character."\r\n\r\n"We are all apt to think, that an opinion that differs from our own is a\r\nprejudice," said Lady Delacour: "what is to decide?"\r\n\r\n"Facts, I should think," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"But it is so difficult to get at facts, even about the merest trifles,"\r\nsaid Lady Delacour. "Actions we see, but their causes we seldom see--an\r\naphorism worthy of Confucius himself: now to apply. Pray, my dear\r\nHelena, how came you by the pretty gold fishes that you were so good as\r\nto send to me yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Anne Percival gave them to me, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"And how came her ladyship to give them to you, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"She gave them to me," said Helena, hesitating.\r\n\r\n"You need not blush, nor repeat to me that she gave them to you; that I\r\nhave heard already--that is the fact: now for the cause--unless it be a\r\nsecret. If it be a secret which you have been desired to keep, you\r\nare quite right to keep it. I make no doubt of its being necessary,\r\naccording to some systems of education, that children should be taught\r\nto keep secrets; and I am convinced (for Lady Anne Percival is, I have\r\nheard, a perfect judge of propriety) that it is peculiarly proper that a\r\ndaughter should know how to keep secrets from her mother: therefore,\r\nmy dear, you need not trouble yourself to blush or hesitate any more--I\r\nshall ask no farther questions: I was not aware that there was any\r\nsecret in the case."\r\n\r\n"There is no secret in the world in the case, mamma," said Helena; "I\r\nonly hesitated because--"\r\n\r\n"You hesitated _only_ because, I suppose you mean. I presume Lady Anne\r\nPercival will have no objection to your speaking good English?"\r\n\r\n"I hesitated only because I was afraid it would not be right to praise\r\nmyself. Lady Anne Percival one day asked us all--"\r\n\r\n"Us all?"\r\n\r\n"I mean Charles, and Edward, and me, to give her an account of some\r\nexperiments, on the hearing of fishes, which Dr. X---- had told to us:\r\nshe promised to give the gold fishes, of which we were all very fond, to\r\nwhichever of us should give the best account of them--Lady Anne gave the\r\nfishes to me."\r\n\r\n"And is this all the secret? So it was real modesty made her hesitate,\r\nBelinda? I beg your pardon, my dear, and Lady Anne\'s: you see how candid\r\nI am, Belinda. But one question more, Helena: Who put it into your head\r\nto send me your gold fishes?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody, mamma; no one put it into my head. But I was at the\r\nbird-fancier\'s yesterday, when Miss Portman was trying to get some bird\r\nfor Mrs. Marriott, that could not make any noise to disturb you; so\r\nI thought my fishes would be the nicest things for you in the world;\r\nbecause they cannot make the least noise, and they are as pretty as any\r\nbirds in the world--prettier, I think--and I hope Mrs. Marriott thinks\r\nso too."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what Marriott thinks about the matter, but I can tell you\r\nwhat I think," said Lady Delacour, "that you are one of the sweetest\r\nlittle girls in the world, and that you would make me love you if I\r\nhad a heart of stone, which I have not, whatever some people may\r\nthink.--Kiss me, my child!"\r\n\r\nThe little girl sprang forwards, and threw her arms round her mother,\r\nexclaiming, "Oh, mamma, are you in earnest?" and she pressed close to\r\nher mother\'s bosom, clasping her with all her force.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour screamed, and pushed her daughter away.\r\n\r\n"She is not angry with you, my love," said Belinda, "she is in sudden\r\nand violent pain--don\'t be alarmed--she will be better soon. No, don\'t\r\nring the bell, but try whether you can open these window-shutters, and\r\nthrow up the sash."\r\n\r\nWhilst Belinda was supporting Lady Delacour, and whilst Helena was\r\ntrying to open the window, a servant came into the room to announce the\r\nCount de N----.\r\n\r\n"Show him into the drawing-room," said Belinda. Lady Delacour, though in\r\ngreat pain, rose and retired to her dressing-room. "I shall not be able\r\nto go down to these people yet," said she; "you must make my excuses\r\nto the count and to every body; and tell poor Helena I was not angry,\r\nthough I pushed her away. Keep her below stairs: I will come as soon as\r\nI am able. Send Marriott. Do not forget, my dear, to tell Helena I was\r\nnot angry."\r\n\r\nThe reading party went on, and Lady Delacour made her appearance as the\r\ncompany were drinking orgeat, between the fourth and fifth act. "Helena,\r\n_my dear_," said she, "will you bring me a glass of orgeat?"\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey looked at Belinda with a congratulatory smile: "do not\r\nyou think," whispered he, "that we shall succeed? Did you see that look\r\nof Lady Delacour\'s?"\r\n\r\nNothing tends more to increase the esteem and affection of two people\r\nfor each other than their having one and the same benevolent object.\r\nClarence Hervey and Belinda seemed to know one another\'s thoughts and\r\nfeelings this evening better than they had ever done before during the\r\nwhole course of their acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAfter the play was over, most of the company went away; only a select\r\nparty of _beaux esprits_ stayed to supper; they were standing at the\r\ntable at which the count had been reading: several volumes of French\r\nplays and novels were lying there, and Clarence Hervey, taking up one of\r\nthem, cried, "Come, let us try our fate by the Sortes Virgilianae."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour opened the book, which was a volume of Marmontel\'s Tales.\r\n\r\n"La femme comme il y en a peu!" exclaimed Hervey.\r\n\r\n"Who will ever more have faith in the Sortes Virgilianae?" said Lady\r\nDelacour, laughing; but whilst she laughed she went closer to a candle,\r\nto read the page which she had opened. Belinda and Clarence Hervey\r\nfollowed her. "Really, it is somewhat singular, Belinda, that I should\r\nhave opened upon this passage," continued she, in a low voice, pointing\r\nit out to Miss Portman.\r\n\r\nIt was a description of the manner in which la femme comme il y en a\r\npeu managed a husband, who was excessively afraid of being thought to\r\nbe governed by his wife. As her ladyship turned over the page, she saw\r\na leaf of myrtle which Belinda, who had been reading the story the\r\npreceding day, had put into the book for a mark.\r\n\r\n"Whose mark is this? Yours, Belinda, I am sure, by its elegance," said\r\nLady Delacour. "So! this is a concerted plan between you two, I see,"\r\ncontinued her ladyship, with an air of pique: "you have contrived\r\nprettily de me dire des verites! One says, \'Let us try our fate by the\r\nSortes Virgilianae;\' the other has dexterously put a mark in the book,\r\nto make it open upon a lesson for the naughty child."\r\n\r\nBelinda and Mr. Hervey assured her that they had used no such mean arts,\r\nthat nothing had been concerted between them.\r\n\r\n"How came this leaf of myrtle here, then?" said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"I was reading that story yesterday, and left it as my mark."\r\n\r\n"I cannot help believing you, because you never yet deceived me, even\r\nin the merest trifle: you are truth itself, Belinda. Well, you see that\r\n_you_ were the cause of my drawing such an extraordinary lot; the book\r\nwould not have opened here but for your mark. My fate, I find, is in\r\nyour hands: if Lady Delacour is ever to be la femme comme il y en a peu,\r\nwhich is the most _improbable_ thing in the world, Miss Portman will be\r\nthe cause of it."\r\n\r\n"Which is the most probable thing in the world," said Clarence Hervey.\r\n"This myrtle has a delightful perfume," added he, rubbing the leaf\r\nbetween his fingers.\r\n\r\n"But, after all," said Lady Delacour, throwing aside the book, "This\r\nheroine of Marmontel\'s is not la femme comme il y en a peu, but la femme\r\ncomme il n\'y en a _point_."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Margaret Delacour\'s carriage, my lady, for Miss Delacour," said a\r\nfootman to her ladyship.\r\n\r\n"Helena stays with me to-night--my compliments," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"How pleased the little gipsy looks!" added she, turning to Helena, who\r\nheard the message; "and how handsome she looks when she is pleased!--Do\r\nthese auburn locks of yours, Helena, curl naturally or artificially?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Naturally! so much the better: so did mine at your age."\r\n\r\nSome of the company now took notice of the astonishing resemblance\r\nbetween Helena and her mother; and the more Lady Delacour considered her\r\ndaughter as a part of herself, the more she was inclined to be pleased\r\nwith her. The glass globe containing the gold fishes was put in the\r\nmiddle of the table at supper; and Clarence Hervey never paid her\r\nladyship such respectful attention in his life as he did this evening.\r\n\r\nThe conversation at supper turned upon a magnificent and elegant\r\nentertainment which had lately been given by a fashionable duchess,\r\nand some of the company spoke in high terms of the beauty and\r\naccomplishments of her grace\'s daughter, who had for the first time\r\nappeared in public on that occasion.\r\n\r\n"The daughter will eclipse, totally eclipse, the mother," said Lady\r\nDelacour. "That total eclipse has been foretold by many knowing people,"\r\nsaid Clarence Hervey; "but how can there be an eclipse between two\r\nbodies which never cross one another and that I understand to be the\r\ncase between the duchess and her daughter."\r\n\r\nThis observation seemed to make a great impression upon Lady Delacour.\r\nClarence Hervey went on, and with much eloquence expressed his\r\nadmiration of the mother who had stopped short in the career of\r\ndissipation to employ her inimitable talents in the education of\r\nher children; who had absolutely brought Virtue into fashion by the\r\nirresistible powers of wit and beauty.\r\n\r\n"Really, Clarence," said Lady Delacour, rising from table, "vous parlez\r\navec beaucoup d\'onction. I advise you to write a sentimental comedy,\r\na comedie larmoyante, or a drama on the German model, and call it The\r\nSchool for Mothers, and beg her grace of ---- to sit for your heroine."\r\n\r\n"Your ladyship, surely, would not be so cruel as to send a faithful\r\nservant a begging for a heroine?" said Clarence Hervey.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour smiled at first at the compliment, but a few minutes\r\nafterwards she sighed bitterly. "It is too late for me to think of being\r\na heroine," said she.\r\n\r\n"Too late?" cried Hervey, following her eagerly as she walked out of\r\nthe supper-room; "too late? Her grace of ---- is _some_ years older than\r\nyour ladyship."\r\n\r\n"Well, I did not mean to say _too late_," said Lady Delacour; "but let\r\nus go on to something else. Why were you not at the fete champetre the\r\nother day? and where were you all this morning? And pray can you tell me\r\nwhen your friend doctor X---- returns to town?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Horton is getting better," said Clarence, "and I hope that we shall\r\nhave Dr. X---- soon amongst us again. I hear that he is to be in town in\r\nthe course of a few days."\r\n\r\n"Did he inquire for me?--Did he ask how I did?"\r\n\r\n"No. I fancy he took it for granted that your ladyship was quite well;\r\nfor I told him you were getting better every day, and that you were in\r\ncharming spirits."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lady Delacour, "but I wear myself out with these charming\r\nspirits. I am very nervous still, I assure you, and sitting up late is\r\nnot good for me: so I shall wish you and all the world a good night. You\r\nsee I am absolutely a reformed rake."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo hours after her ladyship had retired to her room, as Belinda was\r\npassing by the door to go to her own bedchamber, she heard Lady Delacour\r\ncall to her.\r\n\r\n"Belinda, you need not walk so softly; I am not asleep. Come in, will\r\nyou, my dear? I have something of consequence to say to you. Is all the\r\nworld gone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and I thought that you were asleep. I hope you are not in pain."\r\n\r\n"Not just at present, thank you; but that was a terrible embrace of\r\npoor little Helena\'s. You see to what accidents I should be continually\r\nexposed, if I had that child always about me; and yet she seems of such\r\nan affectionate disposition, that I wish it were possible to keep her at\r\nhome. Sit down by my bedside, my dear Belinda, and I will tell you what\r\nI have resolved upon."\r\n\r\nBelinda sat down, and Lady Delacour was silent for some minutes.\r\n\r\n"I am resolved," said she, "to make one desperate effort for my life.\r\nNew plans, new hopes of happiness, have opened to my imagination, and,\r\nwith my hopes of being happy, my courage rises. I am determined to\r\nsubmit to the dreadful operation which alone can radically cure me--you\r\nunderstand me; but it must be kept a profound secret. I know of a person\r\nwho could be got to perform this operation with the utmost secrecy."\r\n\r\n"But, surely," said Belinda, "safety must be your first object!"\r\n\r\n"No, secrecy is my first object. Nay, do not reason with me; it is a\r\nsubject on which I cannot, will not, reason. Hear me--I will keep Helena\r\nwith me for a few days; she was surprised by what passed in the library\r\nthis evening--I must remove all suspicion from her mind."\r\n\r\n"There is no suspicion in her mind," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"So much the better: she shall go immediately to school, or to\r\nOakly-park. I will then stand my trial for life or death; and if I live\r\nI will be, what I have never yet been, a mother to Helena. If I die, you\r\nand Clarence Hervey will take care of her; I know you will. That young\r\nman is worthy of you, Belinda. If I die, I charge you to tell him that\r\nI knew his value; that I had a soul capable of being touched by the\r\neloquence of virtue." Lady Delacour, after a pause, said, in an altered\r\ntone, "Do you think, Belinda, that I shall survive this operation?"\r\n\r\n"The opinion of Dr. X----," said Belinda, "must certainly be more\r\nsatisfactory than mine;" and she repeated what the doctor had left with\r\nher in writing upon this subject. "You see," said Belinda, "that Dr.\r\nX----is by no means certain that you have the complaint which you\r\ndread."\r\n\r\n"I am certain of it," said Lady Delacour, with a deep sigh. Then, after\r\na pause, she resumed: "So it is the doctor\'s opinion, that I shall\r\ninevitably destroy myself if, from a vain hope of secrecy, I put myself\r\ninto ignorant hands? These are his own words, are they? Very strong; and\r\nhe is prudent to leave that opinion in writing. Now, whatever happens,\r\nhe cannot be answerable for \'measures which he does not guide:\' nor you\r\neither, my dear; you have done all that is prudent and proper. But I\r\nmust beg you to recollect, that I am neither a child nor a fool; that I\r\nam come to years of discretion, and that I am not now in the delirium\r\nof a fever; consequently, there can be no pretence for _managing_ me. In\r\nthis particular I must insist upon managing myself. I have confidence\r\nin the skill of the person whom I shall employ: Dr. X----, very likely,\r\nwould have none, because the man may not have a diploma for killing\r\nor curing in form. That is nothing to the purpose. It is I that am to\r\nundergo the operation: it is _my_ health, _my_ life, that is risked; and\r\nif I am satisfied, that is enough. Secrecy, as I told you before, is my\r\nfirst object."\r\n\r\n"And cannot you," said Belinda, "depend with more security upon the\r\nhonour of a surgeon who is at the head of his profession, and who has a\r\nhigh reputation at stake, than upon a vague promise of secrecy from some\r\nobscure quack, who has no reputation to lose?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Lady Delacour: "I tell you, my dear, that I cannot depend\r\nupon any of these \'honourable men.\' I have taken means to satisfy myself\r\non this point: their honour and foolish delicacy would not allow them\r\nto perform such an operation for a wife, without the knowledge, privity,\r\nconsent, &c. &c. &c. of her husband. Now Lord Delacour\'s knowing the\r\nthing is quite out of the question."\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear Lady Delacour, why?" said Belinda, with great earnestness.\r\n"Surely a husband has the strongest claim to be consulted upon such an\r\noccasion! Let me entreat you to tell Lord Delacour your intention, and\r\nthen all will be right. Say Yes, my dear friend! let me prevail upon\r\nyou," said Belinda, taking her ladyship\'s hand, and pressing it between\r\nboth of hers with the most affectionate eagerness.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour made no answer, but fixed her eyes upon Belinda\'s.\r\n\r\n"Lord Delacour," continued Miss Portman, "deserves this from you, by the\r\ngreat interest, the increasing interest, that he has shown of late\r\nabout your health: his kindness and handsome conduct the other morning\r\ncertainly pleased you, and you have now an opportunity of showing that\r\nconfidence in him, which his affection and constant attachment to you\r\nmerit."\r\n\r\n"I trouble myself very little about the constancy of Lord Delacour\'s\r\nattachment to me," said her ladyship coolly, withdrawing her hand from\r\nBelinda; "whether his lordship\'s affection for me has of late increased\r\nor diminished, is an object of perfect indifference to me. But if I were\r\ninclined to reward him for his late attentions, I should apprehend that\r\nwe might hit upon some better reward than you have pitched upon.\r\nUnless you imagine that Lord Delacour has a peculiar taste for surgical\r\noperations, I cannot conceive how his becoming my confidant upon this\r\noccasion could have an immediate tendency to increase his affection for\r\nme--about which affection I don\'t care a straw, as you, better than any\r\none else, must know; for I am no hypocrite. I have laid open my whole\r\nheart to you, Belinda."\r\n\r\n"For that very reason," said Miss Portman, "I am eager to use the\r\ninfluence which I know I have in your heart for your happiness. I am\r\nconvinced that it will be absolutely impossible that you should carry on\r\nthis scheme in the house with your husband without its being discovered.\r\nIf he discover it by accident, he will feel very differently from what\r\nhe would do if he were trusted by you."\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake, my dear," cried Lady Delacour, "let me hear no more\r\nabout Lord Delacour\'s feelings."\r\n\r\n"But allow me then to speak of my own," said Belinda: "I cannot be\r\nconcerned in this affair, if it is to be concealed from your husband."\r\n\r\n"You will do about that as you think proper," said Lady Delacour\r\nhaughtily. "Your sense of propriety towards Lord Delacour is, I observe,\r\nstronger than your sense of honour towards me. But I make no doubt that\r\nyou act upon principle--just principle. You promised never to\r\nabandon me; but when I most want your assistance, you refuse it, from\r\nconsideration for Lord Delacour. A scruple of delicacy absolves a person\r\nof nice feelings, I find, from a positive promise--a new and convenient\r\ncode of morality!"\r\n\r\nBelinda, though much hurt by the sarcastic tone in which her ladyship\r\nspoke, mildly answered, that the promise she had made to stay with her\r\nladyship during her illness was very different from an engagement to\r\nassist her in such a scheme as she had now in contemplation.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour suddenly drew the curtain between her and Belinda, saying,\r\n"Well, my dear, at all events, I am glad to hear you don\'t forget your\r\npromise of _staying_ with me. You are, perhaps, prudent to refuse me\r\nyour assistance, all circumstances considered. Good night: I have kept\r\nyou up too long--good night!"\r\n\r\n"Good night!" said Belinda, drawing aside the curtain, "You will not be\r\ndispleased with me, when you reflect coolly."\r\n\r\n"The light blinds me," said Lady Delacour; and she turned her face away\r\nfrom Miss Portman, and added, in a drowsy voice, "I will _think of what\r\nhas been said_ some time or other: but just now I would rather go\r\nto sleep than say or hear any more; for I am more than half asleep\r\nalready."\r\n\r\nBelinda closed the curtains and left the room. But Lady Delacour,\r\nnotwithstanding the drowsy tone in which she pronounced these last\r\nwords, was not in the least inclined to sleep. A passion had taken\r\npossession of her mind, which kept her broad awake the remainder of the\r\nnight--the passion of jealousy. The extreme eagerness with which Belinda\r\nhad urged her to consult Lord Delacour, and to trust him with her\r\nsecret, displeased her; not merely as an opposition to her will, and\r\nundue attention to his lordship\'s feelings, but as "confirmation strong"\r\nof a hint which had been dropped by Sir Philip Baddely, but which never\r\ntill now had appeared to her worthy of a moment\'s consideration. Sir\r\nPhilip had observed, that, "if a young lady had any hopes of being a\r\nviscountess, it was no wonder she thought a baronet beneath her notice."\r\n"Now," thought Lady Delacour, "this is not impossible. In the first\r\nplace, Belinda Portman is niece to Mrs. Stanhope; she may have all her\r\naunt\'s art, and the still greater art to conceal it under the mask of\r\nopenness and simplicity: _Volto sciolto, pensieri stretti_, is the grand\r\nmaxim of the Stanhope school." The moment Lady Delacour\'s mind turned\r\nto suspicion, her ingenuity rapidly supplied her with circumstances and\r\narguments to confirm and justify her doubts.\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman fears that my husband is growing too fond of me: she says,\r\nhe has been very attentive to me of late. Yes, so he has; and on purpose\r\nto disgust him with me, she immediately urges me to tell him that I have\r\na loathsome disease, and that I am about to undergo a horrid operation.\r\nHow my eyes have been blinded by her artifice! This last stroke was\r\nrather too bold, and has opened them effectually, and now I see a\r\nthousand things that escaped me before. Even to-night, the Sortes\r\nVirgilianae, the myrtle leaf, Miss Portman\'s mark, left in the book\r\nexactly at the place where Marmontel gives a receipt for managing a\r\nhusband of Lord Delacour\'s character. Ah, ah! By her own confession, she\r\nhad been reading this: studying it. Yes, and she has studied it to some\r\npurpose; she has made that poor weak lord of mine think her an angel.\r\nHow he ran on in her praise the other day, when he honoured me with a\r\nmorning visit! That morning visit, too, was of her suggestion; and\r\nthe bank-notes, as he, like a simpleton, let out in the course of the\r\nconversation, had been offered to her first. She, with a delicacy that\r\ncharmed my short-sighted folly, begged that they might go through my\r\nhands. How artfully managed! Mrs. Stanhope herself could not have done\r\nbetter. So, she can make Lord Delacour do whatever she pleases; and\r\nshe condescends to make him behave _prettily_ to me, and desires him\r\nto bring me peace-offerings of bank-notes! She is, in fact, become my\r\nbanker; mistress of my house, my husband, and myself! Ten days I have\r\nbeen confined to my room. Truly, she has made a good use of her time:\r\nand I, fool that I am, have been thanking her for all her disinterested\r\nkindness!\r\n\r\n"Then her attention to my daughter! disinterested, too, as I\r\nthought!--But, good Heavens, what an idiot I have been! She looks\r\nforward to be the step-mother of Helena; she would win the simple\r\nchild\'s affections even before my face, and show Lord Delacour what a\r\ncharming wife and mother she would make! He said some such thing to me,\r\nas well as I remember, the other day. Then her extreme prudence! She\r\nnever coquets, not she, with any of the young men who come here on\r\npurpose to see her. Is this natural? Absolutely unnatural--artifice!\r\nartifice! To contrast herself with me in Lord Delacour\'s opinion is\r\ncertainly her object. Even to Clarence Hervey, with whom she was, or\r\npretended to be, smitten, how cold and reserved she is grown of late;\r\nand how haughtily she rejected my advice, when I hinted that she was\r\nnot taking the way to win him! I could not comprehend her; she had no\r\ndesigns on Clarence Hervey, she assured me. Immaculate purity! I believe\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n"Then her refusal of Sir Philip Baddely!--a baronet with fifteen\r\nthousand a year to be refused by a girl who has nothing, and merely\r\nbecause he is a fool! How could I be such a fool as to believe it?\r\nWorthy niece of Mrs. Stanhope, I know you now! And now I recollect that\r\nextraordinary letter of Mrs. Stanhope\'s which I snatched out of Miss\r\nPortman\'s hands some months ago, full of blanks, and inuendoes, and\r\nreferences to some letter which Belinda had written about my disputes\r\nwith my husband! From that moment to this, Miss Portman has never let me\r\nsee another of her aunt\'s letters. So I may conclude they are all in the\r\nsame style; and I make no doubt that she has instructed her niece,\r\nall this time, how to proceed. Now I know why she always puts Mrs.\r\nStanhope\'s letters into her pocket the moment she receives them, and\r\nnever opens them in my presence. And I have been laying open my whole\r\nheart, telling my whole history, confessing all my faults and follies,\r\nto this girl! And I have told her that I am dying! I have taught her\r\nto look forward with joy and certainty to the coronet, on which she has\r\nfixed her heart.\r\n\r\n"On my knees I conjured her to stay with me to receive my last breath.\r\nOh, dupe, miserable dupe, that I am! could nothing warn me? In the\r\nmoment that I discovered the treachery of one friend, I went and\r\nprostrated myself to the artifices of another--of another a thousand\r\ntimes more dangerous--ten thousand times more beloved! For what was\r\nHarriot Freke in comparison with Belinda Portman? Harriot Freke, even\r\nwhilst she diverted me most, I half despised. But Belinda!--Oh, Belinda!\r\nhow entirely have I loved--trusted--admired--adored--respected--revered\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nExhausted by the emotions to which she had worked herself up by the\r\nforce of her powerful imagination, Lady Delacour, after passing several\r\nrestless hours in bed, fell asleep late in the morning; and when she\r\nawaked, Belinda was standing by her bedside. "What could you be dreaming\r\nof?" said Belinda, smiling. "You started, and looked at me with such\r\nhorror, when you opened your eyes, as if I had been your evil genius."\r\nIt is not in human nature, thought Lady Delacour, suddenly overcome by\r\nthe sweet smile and friendly tone of Belinda, it is not in human nature\r\nto be so treacherous; and she stretched out both her arms to Belinda,\r\nsaying, "You my evil genius? No. My guardian angel, my dearest Belinda,\r\nkiss me, and forgive me."\r\n\r\n"Forgive you for what?" said Belinda; "I believe you are dreaming still,\r\nand I am sorry to awaken you; but I am come to tell you a wonderful\r\nthing--that Lord Delacour is up, and dressed, and actually in the\r\nbreakfast-room; and that he has been talking to me this half hour--of\r\nwhat do you think?--of Helena. He was quite surprised, he said, to see\r\nher grown such a fine girl, and he declares that he no longer regrets\r\nthat she was not a boy; and he says that he will dine at home to-day, on\r\npurpose to drink Helena\'s health in his new burgundy; and, in short, I\r\nnever saw him in such good spirits, or so agreeable: I always thought he\r\nwas one of the best-natured men I had ever seen. Will not you get up to\r\nbreakfast? Lord Delacour has asked for you ten times within these five\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Lady Delacour, rubbing her eyes. "All this is vastly\r\nwonderful; but I wish you had not awakened me so soon."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," said Belinda, "I know by the tone of your voice, that you\r\ndo not mean what you say; I know you will get up, and come down to us\r\ndirectly--so I will send Marriott."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour got up, and went down to breakfast, in much uncertainty\r\nwhat to think of Miss Portman; but ashamed to let her into her mind, and\r\nstill more afraid that Lord Delacour should suspect her of doing him the\r\nhonour to be jealous, Belinda had not the least guess of what was really\r\npassing in her ladyship\'s heart; she implicitly believed her expressions\r\nof complete indifference to her lord; and jealousy was the last feeling\r\nwhich Miss Portman would have attributed to Lady Delacour, because she\r\nunfortunately was not sufficiently aware that jealousy can exist without\r\nlove. The idea of Lord Delacour as an object of attachment, or of a\r\ncoronet as an object of ambition, or of her friend\'s death as an object\r\nof joy, were so foreign to Belinda\'s innocent mind, that it was scarcely\r\npossible she could decipher Lady Delacour\'s thoughts. Her ladyship\r\naffected to be in "remarkable good spirits this morning," declared that\r\nshe had never felt so well since her illness, ordered her carriage\r\nas soon as breakfast was over, and said she would take Helena to\r\nMaillardet\'s, to see the wonders of his little conjuror and his\r\nsinging-bird. "Nothing equal to Maillardet\'s singing-bird has ever been\r\nseen or heard of, my dear Helena, since the days of Aboulcasem\'s peacock\r\nin the Persian Tales. Since Lady Anne Percival has not shown you these\r\ncharming things, I must."\r\n\r\n"But I hope you won\'t tire yourself, mamma," said the little girl.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you will," said Belinda. "And you know, my dear," added Lord\r\nDelacour, "that Miss Portman, who is so very obliging and good-natured,\r\n_could_ go just as well with Helena; and I am sure, _would_, rather than\r\nthat you should tire yourself, or give yourself an unnecessary trouble."\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman is very good," answered Lady Delacour, hastily; "but I\r\nthink it no unnecessary trouble to give my daughter any pleasure in my\r\npower. As to its tiring me, I am neither dead, nor dying, _yet_; for the\r\nrest, Miss Portman, who understands what is proper, blushes for you, as\r\nyou see, my lord, when you propose that she, who is not _yet_ a married\r\nwoman, should _chaperon_ a young lady. It is quite out of rule; and Mrs.\r\nStanhope would be shocked if her niece could, or would, do such a thing\r\nto oblige any body."\r\n\r\nLord Delacour was too much in the habit of hearing sarcastic, and to him\r\nincomprehensible speeches from her ladyship, to take any extraordinary\r\nnotice of this; and if Belinda blushed, it was merely from the confusion\r\ninto which she was thrown by the piercing glance of Lady Delacour\'s\r\nblack eyes--a glance which neither guilt nor innocence could withstand.\r\nBelinda imagined that her ladyship still retained some displeasure from\r\nthe conversation that had passed the preceding night, and the first\r\ntime that she was alone with Lady Delacour, she again touched upon the\r\nsubject, in hopes of softening or convincing her. "At all events,\r\nmy dear friend," said she, "you will not, I hope, be offended by the\r\nsincerity with which I speak--I _can_ have no object but your safety and\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\n"Sincerity never offends me," was her ladyship\'s cold answer. And all\r\nthe time that they were out together, she was unusually ceremonious\r\nto Miss Portman; and there would have been but little conversation,\r\nif Helena had not been present, to whom her mother talked with fluent\r\ngaiety. When they got to Spring Gardens, Helena exclaimed, "Oh! there\'s\r\nLady Anne Percival\'s carriage, and Charles and Edward with her--they are\r\ngoing to the same place that we are, I dare say, for I heard Charles\r\nask Lady Anne to take him to see Maillardet\'s little bird--Mr. Hervey\r\nmentioned it to us, and he said it was a curious piece of machinery."\r\n\r\n"I wish you had told me sooner that Lady Anne was likely to be there--I\r\ndon\'t wish to meet her so awkwardly: I am not well enough yet, indeed,\r\nto go to these odious, hot, close places; and, besides, I hate seeing\r\nsights."\r\n\r\nHelena, with much good humour, said that she would rather give up\r\nseeing the sight than be troublesome to her mother. When they came to\r\nMaillardet\'s, however, Lady Delacour saw Mrs. ---- getting out of her\r\ncarriage, and to her she consigned Helena and Miss Portman, saying that\r\nshe would take a turn or two in the park, and call for them in half\r\nan hour. When the half hour was over, and her ladyship returned, she\r\ncarelessly asked, as they were going home, whether they had been pleased\r\nwith their visit to the bird and the conjuror. "Oh, yes, mamma!" said\r\nHelena: "and do you know, that one of the questions that the people\r\nask the conjuror is, _Where is the happiest family to be found?_" And\r\nCharles and Edward immediately said, "if he is a good conjuror, if he\r\ntells truth, he\'ll answer, \'At Oakly-park.\'"\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman, had you any conversation with Lady Anne Percival?" said\r\nLady Delacour, coldly.\r\n\r\n"A great deal," said Belinda, "and such as I am sure you would have\r\nliked: and so far from being a ceremonious person, I think I never saw\r\nany body who had such easy engaging manners."\r\n\r\n"And did she ask you, Helena, again to go with her to that place where\r\nthe happiest family in the world is to be found?"\r\n\r\n"Oakly-park?--No, mamma; she said that she was very glad that I was with\r\nyou; but she asked Miss Portman to come to see her whenever it was in\r\nher power."\r\n\r\n"And could Miss Portman withstand such a temptation?"\r\n\r\n"You know that I am engaged to your ladyship," said Belinda.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour bowed. "But from what passed last night," said she, "I was\r\nafraid that you might repent your engagement to me: and if so, I give up\r\nmy bond. I should be miserable if I apprehended that any one, but more\r\nespecially Miss Portman, felt herself a prisoner in my house."\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Delacour! I do not feel myself a prisoner; I have always till\r\nnow felt myself a friend in your house; but we\'ll talk of this another\r\ntime. Do not look at me with so much coldness; do not speak to me with\r\nso much politeness. I will not let you forget that I am your friend."\r\n\r\n"I do not wish to forget it, Belinda," said Lady Delacour, with emotion;\r\n"I am not ungrateful, though I may seem capricious--bear with me."\r\n\r\n"There now, you look like yourself again, and I am satisfied," cried\r\nBelinda. "As to going to Oakly-park, I give you my word I have not the\r\nmost distant thoughts of it. I stay with you from choice, and not from\r\ncompulsion, believe me."\r\n\r\n"I _do_ believe you," said Lady Delacour; and for a moment she was\r\nconvinced that Belinda stayed with her for her own sake alone; but the\r\nnext minute she suspected that Lord Delacour was the secret cause of her\r\nrefusing to go to Oakly-park. His lordship dined at home this day, and\r\ntwo or three succeeding days, and he was not intoxicated from\r\nMonday till Thursday. These circumstances appeared to his lady very\r\nextraordinary. In fact, he was pleased and amused with his little\r\ndaughter, Helena; and whilst she was yet almost a stranger to him, he\r\nwished to appear to her in the most agreeable and respectable light\r\npossible. One day after dinner, Lord Delacour, who was in a remarkably\r\ngood humour, said to her ladyship, "My dear, you know that your new\r\ncarriage was broken almost to pieces the night when you were overturned.\r\nWell, I have had it all set to rights again, and new painted, and it is\r\nall complete, except the hammer-cloth, which must have new fringe. What\r\ncolour will you have the fringe?"\r\n\r\n"What do you say, Miss Portman?" said her ladyship.\r\n\r\n"Black and orange would look well, I think," said Belinda, "and would\r\nsuit the lace of your liveries--would not it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly: black and orange then," said Lord Delacour, "it shall be."\r\n\r\n"If you ask my opinion," said Lady Delacour, "I am for blue and white,\r\nto match the cloth of the liveries."\r\n\r\n"Blue and white then it shall be," said Lord Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Miss Portman has a better taste than I have; and she says black\r\nand orange, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll have it black and orange, will you?" said Lord Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Just as you please," said Lady Delacour, and no more passed.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward a note came from Lady Anne Percival, with some trifles\r\nbelonging to Helena, for which her mother had sent. The note was for\r\nBelinda--another pressing invitation to Oakly-park--and a very civil\r\nmessage from Mrs. Margaret Delacour, and thanks to Lady Delacour for\r\nthe macaw. Ay, thought Lady Delacour, Miss Portman wants to ingratiate\r\nherself in time with all my husband\'s relations. "Mrs. Margaret Delacour\r\nshould have addressed these thanks to you, Miss Portman, for I had not\r\nthe grace to think of sending her the macaw." Lord Delacour, who was\r\nvery fond of his aunt, immediately joined his thanks, and observed that\r\nMiss Portman was always considerate--always obliging--always kind.\r\nThen he drank her health in a bumper of burgundy, and insisted upon his\r\nlittle Helena\'s drinking her health. "I am sure you ought, my dear, for\r\nMiss Portman is very good--too good to you, child."\r\n\r\n"Very good--not too good, I hope," said Lady Delacour. "Miss Portman,\r\nyour health."\r\n\r\n"And I hope," continued his lordship, after swallowing his bumper, "that\r\nmy Lady Anne Percival does not mean to inveigle you away from us, Miss\r\nPortman. You don\'t think of leaving us, Miss Portman, I hope? Here\'s\r\nHelena would break her little heart;--I say nothing for my Lady\r\nDelacour, because she can say every thing so much better for herself;\r\nand I say nothing for myself, because I am the worst man in the world\r\nat making speeches, when I really have a thing at heart--as I have your\r\nstaying with us, Miss Portman."\r\n\r\nBelinda assured him that there was no occasion to press her to do what\r\nwas perfectly agreeable to her, and said that she had no thoughts of\r\nleaving Lady Delacour. Her ladyship, with some embarrassment, expressed\r\nherself "extremely obliged, and gratified, and happy." Helena, with\r\nartless joy, threw her arms about Belinda, and exclaimed, "I am glad\r\nyou are not going; for I never liked any body so much, of whom I knew so\r\nlittle."\r\n\r\n"The more you know of Miss Portman the more you will like her, child--at\r\nleast I have found it so," said Lord Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Clarence Hervey would, I am sure, have given the Pigot diamond, if it\r\nwere in his gift, for such a smile as you bestowed on Lord Delacour just\r\nnow," whispered Lady Delacour. For an instant Belinda was struck with\r\nthe tone of pique and reproach, in which, her ladyship spoke. "Nay,\r\nmy dear, I did not mean to make you blush so piteously," pursued her\r\nladyship: "I really did not think it a blushing matter--but you know\r\nbest. Believe me, I spoke without malice; we are so apt to judge from\r\nour own feelings--and I could as soon blush about the old man of the\r\nmountains as about my Lord Delacour."\r\n\r\n"Lord Delacour!" said Belinda, with a look of such unfeigned surprise,\r\nthat her ladyship instantly changed countenance, and, taking her hand\r\nwith gaiety, said, "So, my little Belinda, I have caught you--the blush\r\nbelongs then to Clarence Hervey? Well, any man of common sense would\r\nrather have one blush than a thousand smiles for his share: now we\r\nunderstand one another. And will you go with me to the exhibition\r\nto-morrow? I am told there are some charming pictures this year. Helena,\r\nwho really has a genius for drawing, should see these things; and whilst\r\nshe _is_ with me, I will make her as happy as possible. You see the\r\nreformation is beginning--Clarence Hervey and Miss Portman can do\r\nwonders. If it be my fate, at last, to be _la bonne mere_, or _la femme\r\ncomme il y en a peu_, how can I help it? There is no struggling against\r\nfate, my dear!"\r\n\r\nWhenever Lady Delacour\'s suspicions of Belinda were suspended, all her\r\naffections returned with double force; she wondered at her own folly,\r\nshe was ashamed that she could have let such ideas enter her mind,\r\nand she was beyond measure astonished that any thing relative to Lord\r\nDelacour could so far have interested her attention. "Luckily," said she\r\nto herself, "he has not the penetration of a blind beetle; and, besides,\r\nhe has little snug jealousies of his own: so he will never find me\r\nout. It would be an excellent thing indeed, if he were to turn my\r\n\'_master-torment_\' against myself--it would be a judgment upon me. The\r\nmanes of poor Lawless would then be appeased. But it is impossible I\r\nshould ever be a jealous wife: I am only a jealous friend, and I\r\nmust satisfy myself about Belinda. To be a second time a dupe to\r\nthe treachery of a friend would be too much for me--too much for my\r\npride--too much for my heart."\r\n\r\nThe next day, when they came to the exhibition, Lady Delacour had an\r\nopportunity of judging of Belinda\'s real feelings. As they went up the\r\nstairs, they heard the voices of Sir Philip Baddely and Mr. Rochfort,\r\nwho were standing upon the landing-place, leaning over the banisters,\r\nand running their little sticks along the iron rails, to try which could\r\nmake the loudest noise.\r\n\r\n"Have you been much pleased with the pictures, gentlemen?" said Lady\r\nDelacour, as she passed them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, damme! no--\'tis a cursed bore; and yet there are some fine\r\npictures: one in particular--hey, Rochfort?--one damned fine picture!"\r\nsaid Sir Philip. And the two gentlemen laughing significantly, followed\r\nLady Delacour and Belinda into the rooms.\r\n\r\n"Ay, there\'s one picture that\'s worth all the rest, \'pon honour!"\r\nrepeated Rochfort; "and we\'ll leave it to your ladyship\'s and Miss\r\nPortman\'s taste and judgment to find it out, mayn\'t we, Sir Philip?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, damme! yes," said Sir Philip, "by all means." But he was so\r\nimpatient to direct her eyes, that he could not keep himself still an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n"Oh, curse it! Rochfort, we\'d better tell the ladies at once, else they\r\nmay be all day looking and looking!"\r\n\r\n"Nay, Sir Philip, may not I be allowed to guess? Must I be told which is\r\nyour fine picture?--This is not much in favour of my taste."\r\n\r\n"Oh, damn it! your ladyship has the best taste in the world, every body\r\nknows; and so has Miss Portman--and this picture will hit her taste\r\nparticularly, I\'m sure. It is Clarence Hervey\'s fancy; but this is a\r\ndead secret--dead--Clary no more thinks that we know it, than the man in\r\nthe moon."\r\n\r\n"Clarence Hervey\'s fancy! Then I make no doubt of its being good for\r\nsomething," said Lady Delacour, "if the painter have done justice to his\r\nimagination; for Clarence has really a fine imagination."\r\n\r\n"Oh, damme! \'tis not amongst the history pieces," cried Sir Philip;\r\n"\'tis a portrait."\r\n\r\n"And a history piece, too, \'pon honour!" said Rochfort: "a family\r\nhistory piece, I take it, \'pon honour! it will turn out," said Rochfort;\r\nand both the gentlemen were, or affected to be, thrown into convulsions\r\nof laughter, as they repeated the words, "family history piece, \'pon\r\nhonour!--family history piece, damme!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take my oath as to the portrait\'s being a devilish good likeness,"\r\nadded Sir Philip; and as he spoke, he turned to Miss Portman: "Miss\r\nPortman has it! damme, Miss Portman has him!"\r\n\r\nBelinda hastily withdrew her eyes from the picture at which she was\r\nlooking. "A most beautiful creature!" exclaimed Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Oh, faith! yes; I always do Clary the justice to say, he has a damned\r\ngood taste for beauty."\r\n\r\n"But this seems to be foreign beauty," continued Lady Delacour, "if one\r\nmay judge by her air, her dress, and the scenery about her--cocoa-trees,\r\nplantains: Miss Portman, what think you?"\r\n\r\n"I think," said Belinda, (but her voice faltered so much that she could\r\nhardly speak,) "that it is a scene from Paul and Virginia. I think the\r\nfigure is St. Pierre\'s Virginia."\r\n\r\n"Virginia St. Pierre! ma\'am," cried Mr. Rochfort, winking at Sir Philip.\r\n"No, no, damme! there you are wrong, Rochfort; say Hervey\'s Virginia,\r\nand then you have it, damme! or, may be, Virginia Hervey--who knows?"\r\n\r\n"This is a portrait," whispered the baronet to Lady Delacour, "of\r\nClarence\'s mistress." Whilst her ladyship leant her ear to this whisper,\r\nwhich was sufficiently audible, she fixed a seemingly careless, but most\r\nobserving, inquisitive eye upon poor Belinda. Her confusion, for she\r\nheard the whisper, was excessive.\r\n\r\n"She loves Clarence Hervey--she has no thoughts of Lord Delacour and\r\nhis coronet: I have done her injustice," thought Lady Delacour, and\r\ninstantly she despatched Sir Philip out of the room, for a catalogue\r\nof the pictures, begged Mr. Rochfort to get her something else, and,\r\ndrawing Miss Portman\'s arm within hers, she said, in a low voice, "Lean\r\nupon me, my dearest Belinda: depend upon it, Clarence will never be such\r\na fool as to marry the girl--Virginia Hervey she will never be!"\r\n\r\n"And what will become of her? can Mr. Hervey desert her? she looks\r\nlike innocence itself--and so young, too! Can he leave her for ever to\r\nsorrow, and vice, and infamy?" thought Belinda, as she kept her eyes\r\nfixed, in silent anguish, upon the picture of Virginia. "No, he cannot\r\ndo this: if he could he would be unworthy of me, and I _ought_ to think\r\nof him no more. No; he will marry her; and I _must_ think of him no\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nShe turned abruptly away from the picture, and she saw Clarence Hervey\r\nstanding beside her.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of this picture? is it not beautiful? We are quite\r\nenchanted with it; but you do not seem to be struck with it, as we were\r\nat the first glance," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Because," answered Clarence, gaily, "it is not the first glance I have\r\nhad at that picture--I admired it yesterday, and admire it to-day."\r\n\r\n"But you are tired of admiring it, I see. Well, we shall not force you\r\nto be in raptures with it--shall we, Miss Portman? A man may be tired of\r\nthe most beautiful face in the world, or the most beautiful picture;\r\nbut really there is so much sweetness, so much innocence, such tender\r\nmelancholy in this countenance, that, if I were a man, I should\r\ninevitably be in love with it, and in love for ever! Such beauty, if it\r\nwere in nature, would certainly fix the most inconstant man upon earth."\r\n\r\nBelinda ventured to take her eyes for an instant from the picture, to\r\nsee whether Clarence Hervey looked like the most inconstant man upon\r\nearth. He was intently gazing upon her; but as soon as she looked\r\nround, he suddenly exclaimed, as he turned to the picture--"A heavenly\r\ncountenance, indeed!--the painter has done justice to the poet."\r\n\r\n"Poet!" repeated Lady Delacour: "the man\'s in the clouds!"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," said Clarence; "does not M. de St. Pierre deserve to\r\nbe called a poet? Though he does not write in rhyme, surely he has a\r\npoetical imagination."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Belinda; and from the composure with which Mr. Hervey\r\nnow spoke, she was suddenly inclined to believe, or to hope, that all\r\nSir Philip\'s story was false. "M. de St. Pierre undoubtedly has a great\r\ndeal of imagination, and deserves to be called a poet."\r\n\r\n"Very likely, good people!" said Lady Delacour; "but what has that to do\r\nwith the present purpose?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," cried Clarence, "your ladyship certainly sees that this is St.\r\nPierre\'s Virginia?"\r\n\r\n"St. Pierre\'s Virginia! Oh, I know who it is, Clarence, as well as you\r\ndo. I am not quite so blind, or so stupid, as you take me to be." Then\r\nrecollecting her promise, not to betray Sir Philip\'s secret, she added,\r\npointing to the landscape of the picture, "These cocoa trees, this\r\nfountain, and the words _Fontaine de Virginie_, inscribed on the rock--I\r\nmust have been stupidity itself, if I had not found it out. I absolutely\r\n_can_ read, Clarence, and spell, and put together. But here comes Sir\r\nPhilip Baddely, who, I believe, cannot read, for I sent him an hour ago\r\nfor a catalogue, and he pores over the book as if he had not yet made\r\nout the title."\r\n\r\nSir Philip had purposely delayed, because he was afraid of rejoining\r\nLady Delacour whilst Clarence Hervey was with her, and whilst they were\r\ntalking of the picture of Virginia.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s the catalogue; here\'s the picture your ladyship wants. St.\r\nPierre\'s Virginia: damme! I never heard of that fellow before--he is\r\nsome new painter, damme! that is the reason I did not know the hand. Not\r\na word of what I told you, Lady Delacour--you won\'t blow us to Clary,"\r\nadded he _aside_ to her ladyship. "Rochfort keeps aloof; and so will I,\r\ndamme!"\r\n\r\nA gentleman at this instant beckoned to Mr. Hervey with an air of great\r\neagerness. Clarence went and spoke to him, then returned with an altered\r\ncountenance, and apologized to Lady Delacour for not dining with her, as\r\nhe had promised. Business, he said, of great importance required that he\r\nshould leave town immediately. Helena had just taken Miss Portman into a\r\nlittle room, where Westall\'s drawings were hung, to show her a group\r\nof Lady Anne Percival and her children; and Belinda was alone with\r\nthe little girl, when Mr. Hervey came to bid her adieu. He was in much\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman, I shall not, I am afraid, see you again for some\r\ntime;--perhaps I may never have that--hem!--happiness. I had something\r\nof importance that I wished to say to you before I left town; but I\r\nam forced to go so suddenly, I can hardly hope for any moment but the\r\npresent to speak to you, madam. May I ask whether you purpose remaining\r\nmuch longer with Lady Delacour?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Belinda, much surprised. "I believe--I am not quite\r\ncertain--but I believe I shall stay with her ladyship some time longer."\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey looked painfully embarrassed, and his eyes involuntarily fell\r\nupon little Helena. Helena drew her hand gently away from Belinda, left\r\nthe room, and retired to her mother.\r\n\r\n"That child, Miss Portman, is very fond of you," said Mr. Hervey.\r\nAgain he paused, and looked round to see whether he could be overheard.\r\n"Pardon me for what I am going to say. This is not a proper place. I\r\nmust be abrupt; for I am so circumstanced, that I have not a moment\'s\r\ntime to spare. May I speak to you with the sincerity of a friend?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Speak to me with sincerity," said Belinda, "and you will deserve\r\nthat I should think you my friend." She trembled excessively, but spoke\r\nand looked with all the firmness that she could command.\r\n\r\n"I have heard a report," said Mr. Hervey, "which is most injurious to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"To me!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. No one can escape calumny. It is whispered, that if Lady Delacour\r\nshould die--."\r\n\r\nAt the word _die_, Belinda started.\r\n\r\n"That if Lady Delacour should die, Miss Portman would become the mother\r\nof Helena!"\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens! what an absurd report! Surely _you_ could not for an\r\ninstant believe it, Mr. Hervey?"\r\n\r\n"Not for an instant. But I resolved, as soon as I heard it, to mention\r\nit to you; for I believe that half the miseries of the world arise from\r\nfoolish mysteries--from the want of courage to speak the truth. Now that\r\nyou are upon your guard, your own prudence will defend you sufficiently.\r\nI never saw any of your sex who appeared to me to have so much prudence,\r\nand so little art; but--farewell--I have not a moment to lose," added\r\nClarence, suddenly checking himself; and he hurried away from Belinda,\r\nwho stood fixed to the spot where he left her, till she was roused by\r\nthe voices of several people who came into the room to see the drawings.\r\nShe started as if from a dream, and went immediately in search of Lady\r\nDelacour.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Baddely was in earnest conversation with her ladyship; but\r\nhe stopped speaking when Belinda came within hearing, and Lady Delacour\r\nturned to Helena, and said, "My dear, if you are satisfied, for mercy\'s\r\nsake let us be gone, for I am absolutely overcome with heat--and with\r\ncuriosity," added she in a low voice to Belinda: "I long to hear how\r\nClarence Hervey likes Westall\'s drawings."\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got home, Lady Delacour sent her daughter to practise\r\na new lesson upon the piano forte. "And now sit down, my dear Belinda,"\r\nsaid she, "and satisfy my curiosity. It is the curiosity of a friend,\r\nnot of an impertinent busybody. Has Clarence declared himself? He chose\r\nan odd time and place; but that is no matter; I forgive him, and so\r\ndo you, I dare say. But why do you tear that unfortunate carnation to\r\npieces? Surely you cannot be embarrassed in speaking to me! What\'s\r\nthe matter? I once did tell you, that I would not give up my claim to\r\nClarence\'s adorations during my life; but I intend to live a few years\r\nlonger after the amazonian operation is performed, you know; and I could\r\nnot have the conscience to keep you waiting whole years. It is better\r\nto do things with a good grace, lest one should be forced at last to do\r\nthem with an ill grace. Therefore I give up all manner of claim to\r\nevery thing but--flattery! that of course you will allow me from poor\r\nClarence. So now do not begin upon another flower; but, without any\r\nfarther superfluous modesty, let me hear all the pretty things Clarence\r\nsaid or swore."\r\n\r\nWhilst Belinda was pulling the carnation to pieces, she recollected what\r\nMr. Hervey had said to her about mysteries: his words still sounded\r\nin her ear. "_I believe that half the miseries of the world arise from\r\nfoolish mysteries--from the want of courage to speak the truth_." I will\r\nhave the courage to speak the truth, thought she, whatever it may cost\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"The only pretty thing that Mr. Hervey said was, that he never saw any\r\nwoman who had so much prudence and so little art," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"A very pretty thing indeed, my dear! But it might have been said in\r\nopen court by your grandfather, or your great-grandfather. I am sorry,\r\nif that was all, that Helena did not stay to hear such a charming moral\r\ncompliment--_Moralite a la glace_. The last thing I should have expected\r\nin a _tete-a-tete_ with Clarence Hervey. Was it worth while to pull that\r\npoor flower to pieces for such a pretty speech as this? And so that was\r\nall?"\r\n\r\n"No, not all: but you overpower me with your wit; and I cannot stand the\r\n\'lightning of your eyes.\'"\r\n\r\n"There!" said her ladyship, letting down her veil over her face, "the\r\nfire of my eyes is not too much for you now."\r\n\r\n"Helena was showing me Westall\'s drawing of Lady Anne Percival and her\r\nchildren--"\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Hervey wished that he was the father of such a charming group\r\nof children, and you the mother--hey? was not that it? It was not put in\r\nsuch plain terms, but that was the purport, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"No, not at all; he said nothing about Lady Anne Percival\'s children,\r\nbut--"\r\n\r\n"But--why then did you bring in her ladyship and her children? To gain\r\ntime?--Bad policy!--Never, whilst you live, when you have a story\r\nto tell, bring in a parcel of people who have nothing to do with the\r\nbeginning, the middle, or the end of it. How could I suspect you of\r\nsuch false taste! I really imagined these children were essential to the\r\nbusiness; but I beg pardon for giving you these elements of criticism. I\r\nassure you I interrupt you, and talk on so fast, from pure good-nature,\r\nto give you time to recollect yourself; for I know you\'ve the worst of\r\nmemories, especially for what Clarence Hervey says. But come, my dear,\r\ndash into the middle of things at once, in the true Epic style."\r\n\r\n"Then to dash into the midst of things at once," said Miss Portman,\r\nspeaking very quick: "Mr. Hervey observed that Miss Delacour was growing\r\nvery fond of me."\r\n\r\n"Miss Delacour, did you say?" cried her ladyship: "_Et puis_?"\r\n\r\nAt this instant Champfort opened the door, looked in, and seeing Lady\r\nDelacour, immediately retired.\r\n\r\n"Champfort, whom do you want--or what do you want?" said her ladyship.\r\n\r\n"Miladi, c\'est que--I did come from milord, to see if miladi and\r\nmademoiselle were visible. I did tink miladi was not at home."\r\n\r\n"You see I am at home, though," said her ladyship. "Has Lord Delacour\r\nany business with me?"\r\n\r\n"No, miladi: not with miladi," said Champfort; "it was with\r\nmademoiselle."\r\n\r\n"With me, Monsieur Champfort? then you will be so good as to tell Lord\r\nDelacour I am here."\r\n\r\n"And that _I_ am not here, Champfort; for I must be gone to dress."\r\n\r\nShe rose hastily to leave the room, but Miss Portman caught her hand:\r\n"You won\'t go, I hope, Lady Delacour," said she, "till I have finished\r\nmy long story?" Lady Delacour sat down again, ashamed of her own\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\nWhether this be art, innocence, or assurance, thought she, I cannot\r\ntell; but we shall see.\r\n\r\nLord Delacour now came in, with a half-unfolded newspaper, and a packet\r\nof letters in his hand. He came to apologize to Miss Portman for having,\r\nby mistake, broken the seal of a letter to her, which had been sent\r\nunder cover to him. He had simply asked Champfort whether the ladies\r\nwere at home, that he might not have the trouble of going up stairs if\r\nthey were out. Monsieur Champfort possessed, in an eminent degree, the\r\nmischievous art of appearing mysterious about the simplest things in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"Though I was so thoughtless as to break the seal before I looked at the\r\ndirection of the letter," said Lord Delacour, "I assure you I went no\r\nfarther than the first three words; for I knew \'my dear niece\' could not\r\npossibly mean me." He gave Miss Portman the letter, and left the\r\nroom. This explanation was perfectly satisfactory to Belinda; but Lady\r\nDelacour, prejudiced by the hesitation of Champfort, could not help\r\nsuspecting that this letter was merely the ostensible cause of his\r\nlordship\'s visit.\r\n\r\n"From my aunt Stanhope," said Miss Portman, as she opened her letter.\r\nShe folded it up again after glancing over the first page, and put it\r\ninto her pocket, colouring deeply.\r\n\r\nAll Lady Delacour\'s suspicions about Mrs. Stanhope\'s epistolary counsels\r\nand secrets instantly recurred, with almost the force of conviction to\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman," said she, "I hope your politeness to me does not prevent\r\nyou from reading your letter? Some ceremonious people think it vastly\r\nrude to read a letter in company; but I am not one of them: I can write\r\nwhilst you read, for I have fifty notes and more to answer. So pray read\r\nyour letter at your ease."\r\n\r\nBelinda had but just unfolded her letter again, when Lord Delacour\r\nreturned, followed by Champfort, who brought with him a splendid\r\nhammer-cloth.\r\n\r\n"Here, my dear Lady Delacour," said his lordship, "is a little surprise\r\nfor you: here is a new hammer-cloth, of my bespeaking and taste, which I\r\nhope you will approve of."\r\n\r\n"Very handsome, upon my word!" said Lady Delacour, coldly, and she fixed\r\nher eyes upon the fringe, which was black and orange: "Miss Portman\'s\r\ntaste, I see!"\r\n\r\n"Did you not say black and orange fringe, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"No. I said blue and white, my lord."\r\n\r\nHis lordship declared he did not know how the mistake had happened; it\r\nwas merely a mistake:--but her ladyship was convinced that it was\r\ndone on purpose. And she said to herself, "Miss Portman will order my\r\nliveries next! I have not even the shadow of power left in my own house!\r\nI am not treated with even a decent show of respect! But this shall go\r\non till I have full conviction of her views."\r\n\r\nDissembling her displeasure, she praised the hammer-cloth, and\r\nespecially the fringe. Lord Delacour retired satisfied; and Miss Portman\r\nsat down to read the following letter from her aunt Stanhope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nJEALOUSY.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Crescent, Bath, July--Wednesday.\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR NIECE,\r\n\r\n"I received safely the bank notes for my two hundred guineas, enclosed\r\nin your last. But you should never trust unnecessarily in this manner to\r\nthe post--always, when you are obliged to send bank notes by post, cut\r\nthem in two, and send half by one post and half by another. This is\r\nwhat is done by all prudent people. Prudence, whether in trifles or\r\nin matters of consequence, can be learned only by experience (which is\r\noften too dearly bought), or by listening, which costs nothing, to the\r\nsuggestions of those who have a thorough knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\n"A report has just reached me concerning you and _a certain lord_, which\r\ngives me the most heartfelt concern. I always knew, and told you, that\r\nyou were _a great favourite_ with the person in question. I depended\r\non your prudence, delicacy, and principles, to understand this hint\r\nproperly, and I trusted that you would conduct yourself accordingly.\r\nIt is too plain, (from the report alluded to,) that there has been some\r\nmisconduct or mis-management somewhere. The misconduct I cannot--the\r\nmis-management I must, attribute to you, my dear; for let a man\'s\r\nadmiration for any woman be ever so great, unless she suffer herself\r\nto be dazzled by vanity, or unless she be naturally of an inconsiderate\r\ntemper, she can surely prevent his partiality from becoming so glaring\r\nas to excite envy: envy is always to be dreaded by handsome young women,\r\nas being, sooner or later, infallibly followed by scandal. Of this,\r\nI fear, you have not been sufficiently aware, and you see the\r\nconsequences--consequences which, to a female of genuine delicacy or of\r\nreal good sense, must be extremely alarming. Men of contracted minds and\r\ncold tempers, who are absolutely incapable of feeling generous passion\r\nfor our sex, are often unaccountably ambitious to gain the reputation\r\nof being _well_ with any woman whose beauty, accomplishments, or\r\nconnexions, may have brought her into fashion. Whatever affection may be\r\npretended, this is frequently the _ultimate_ and _sole_ object of these\r\nselfish creatures. Whether or not the person I have in my eye deserves\r\nto be included in this class, I will not presume positively to\r\ndetermine; but you, who have personal opportunities of observation,\r\nmay decide this point (if you have any curiosity on the subject) by\r\nobserving whether he most affects to pay his devoirs to you in public or\r\nin private. If the latter be the case, it is the most dangerous; because\r\na man even of the most contracted understanding has always sense or\r\ninstinct enough to feel that the slightest taint in the reputation\r\nof the woman who is, or who is to be, his wife, would affect his own\r\nprivate peace, or his honour in the eyes of the world. A husband who\r\nhas in a first marriage been, as it is said, in constant fear both of\r\nmatrimonial subjugation and disgrace, would, in his choice of a second\r\nlady, be peculiarly nice, and probably _tardy_. Any degree of favour\r\nthat might have been shown him, any report that may have been raised,\r\nand above all, any restraint he might feel himself under from\r\nimplied engagement, or from the discovery or reputation of superior\r\nunderstanding and talents in the object beloved, would operate\r\ninfallibly against her, to the confusion of all her plans, and the\r\nruin at once of her reputation, her peace of mind, and her hopes of an\r\nestablishment. Nay, supposing the best that could possibly happen--that,\r\nafter playing with the utmost dexterity this desperate game, the pool\r\nwere absolutely your own; yet, if there were any suspicions of unfair\r\nplay buzzed about amongst the by-standers, you would not in the main be\r\na gainer; for my dear, without character, what is even wealth, or all\r\nthat wealth can bestow? I do not mean to trouble you with stale wise\r\nsayings, which young people hate; nor musty morality, which is seldom\r\nfit for use in the world, or which smells too much of books to be\r\nbrought into good company. This is not my way of giving advice; but I\r\nonly beg you to observe what actually passes before your eyes in the\r\ncircle in which we live. Ladies of the best families, with rank and\r\nfortune, and beauty and fashion, and every thing in their favour, cannot\r\n(as yet in this country) dispense with the strictest observance of the\r\nrules of virtue and decorum. Some have fancied themselves raised so high\r\nabove the vulgar as to be in no danger from the thunder and lightning\r\nof public opinion; but these ladies in the clouds have found themselves\r\nmistaken--they have been blasted, and have fallen nobody knows where!\r\nWhat is become of Lady ----, and the Countess of ----, and others I\r\ncould mention, who were as high as envy could look? I remember seeing\r\nthe Countess of ----, who was then the most beautiful creature my eyes\r\never beheld, and the most admired that ever was heard of, come into\r\nthe Opera-house, and sit the whole night in her box without any woman\'s\r\nspeaking or courtesying to her, or taking any more notice of her than\r\nyou would of a post, or a beggar-woman. Even a coronet cannot protect\r\na woman, you see, from disgrace: if she falls, she and it, and all\r\ntogether, are trampled under foot. But why should I address all this to\r\nmy dear niece? Whither have the terror and confusion I was thrown into\r\nby this strange report about you and Lord ---- led me? And yet\r\none cannot be too cautious--\'Ce n\'est que le premier _mot_ qui\r\ncoute\'--Scandal never stops after the first word, unless she be\r\ninstantly gagged by a dexterous hand. Nothing shall be wanting on my\r\npart, but you alone are the person who can do any thing effectual Do not\r\nimagine that I would have you quit Lady----; that is the first idea,\r\nI know, that will come into your silly little head, but put it out\r\ndirectly. If you were upon this attack to quit the field of battle, you\r\nyield the victory to your enemies. To leave Lady----\'s house would be\r\nfolly and madness. As long as she is your friend, or _appears_ such,\r\nall is safe; but any coolness on her part would, in the present\r\ncircumstances, be death to your reputation. And, even if you were to\r\nleave her on the best terms possible, the malicious world would say\r\nthat you left her on the worst, and would assign as a reason the report\r\nalluded to. People who have not yet believed it would then conclude\r\nthat it must be true; and thus by your cowardice you would furnish an\r\nincontrovertible argument against your innocence. I therefore desire\r\nthat you will not, upon any account, think of coming home to me at\r\npresent; indeed, I hope your own good sense would prevent you from\r\nwishing it, after the reasons that I have given. Far from quitting Lady\r\n---- from false delicacy, it is your business, from consideration for\r\nher peace, as well as your own, to redouble your attentions to her in\r\nprivate, and, above all things, to appear as much as possible with her\r\nin public. I am glad to hear her health is so far reestablished, that\r\nshe _can_ appear again in public; her spirits, as you may hint, will be\r\nthe better for a little amusement. Luckily, you have it completely in\r\nyour power to convince her and all the world of the correctness of your\r\nmind. I believe I certainly should have fainted, my dear, when I first\r\nheard this shocking report, if I had not just afterward received a\r\nletter from Sir Philip Baddely which revived me. His proposal at this\r\ncrisis for you, my dear, is a charming thing. You have nothing to do but\r\nto encourage his addresses immediately,--the report dies away of itself,\r\nand all is just as your best friends wish. Such an establishment for\r\nyou, my dear, is indeed beyond their most sanguine expectations. Sir\r\nPhilip hints in his letter, that my influence might be wanting with you\r\nin his favour; but this surely cannot be. As I have told him, he has\r\nmerely mistaken becoming female reserve for a want of sensibility on\r\nyour part, which would be equally unnatural and absurd. Do you know, my\r\ndear, that Sir Philip Baddely has an estate of fifteen thousand a-year\r\nin Wiltshire? and his uncle Barton\'s estate in Norfolk will, in due\r\ntime, pay his debts. Then, as to family--look in the lists of baronets\r\nin your pocket-book; and surely, my love, an old baronetage in actual\r\npossession is worth something more than the reversion of a new coronet;\r\nsupposing that such a thing could properly be thought of, which Heaven\r\nforbid! So I see no possible objection to Sir Philip, my dear Belinda!\r\nand I am sure you have too much candour and good sense to make any\r\nchildish or romantic difficulties. Sir Philip is not, I know, a man of\r\nwhat you call genius. So much the better, my dear--those men of genius\r\nare dangerous husbands; they have so many oddities and eccentricities,\r\nthere is no managing them, though they are mighty pleasant men in\r\ncompany to enliven conversation; for example, your favourite, Clarence\r\nHervey. As it is well known he is not a marrying man, you never can have\r\nthought of him. You are not a girl to expose yourself to the ridicule,\r\n&c., of all your female acquaintance by romance and nonsense. I\r\ncannot conceive that a niece of mine could degrade herself by a mean\r\nprepossession for a man who has never made any declaration of his\r\nattachment to her, and who, I am sure, feels no such attachment.\r\nThat you may not deceive yourself, it is fit I should tell you, what\r\notherwise it might not be so proper to mention to a young lady, that\r\nhe keeps and has kept a mistress for some years; and those who are most\r\nintimately in his confidence have assured me that, if ever he marries\r\nany body, he will marry this girl; which is not impossible, considering\r\nthat she is, they say, the most beautiful young creature that ever was\r\nseen, and he _a man of genius_. If you have any sense or spirit, I have\r\nsaid enough. So adieu!--Let me hear, by return of the post, that every\r\nthing is going on as it should do. I am impatient to write to your\r\nsister Tollemache this good news. I always foretold that my Belinda\r\nwould marry better than her sister, or any of her cousins, and take\r\nplace of them all. Are not you obliged to me for sending you this winter\r\nto town to Lady ----? It was an admirable hit. Pray tell Lady Delacour,\r\nwith my best compliments, that our _aloe_ friend (her ladyship will\r\nunderstand me) cheated a gentleman of my acquaintance the other day, at\r\ncasino, out of seventy guineas. He hates the sight of her odious red wig\r\nas much now as we always did. I knew, and told Lady D----, as she will\r\ndo me the justice to remember, that Mrs.----cheated at play. What a\r\ncontemptible character!--Pray, my dear, do not forget to tell Lady\r\nDelacour, that I have a charming anecdote for her, about another\r\n_friend_ of ours, who has lately gone over to the enemy. Has her\r\nladyship seen a manuscript that is handed about as a great secret, and\r\nsaid to be by ----, a parallel between _our friend_ and the Chevalier\r\nd\'Eon? It is done with infinite wit and humour, in the manner of\r\nPlutarch. I would send a copy, but am afraid my frank would be too heavy\r\nif I began upon another sheet. So once more adieu, my dear niece! Write\r\nto me without fail, and mention Sir Philip. I have written to him to\r\ngive my approbation, &c.\r\n\r\n"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n"SELINA STANHOPE."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Stanhope seems to have written you a volume instead of a letter,\r\nMiss Portman," cried Lady Delacour, as Belinda turned over the sheets\r\nof her aunt\'s long epistle. She did not attempt to read it regularly\r\nthrough: some passages here and there were sufficient to astonish and\r\nshock her extremely. "No bad news, I hope?" said Lady Delacour, again\r\nlooking up from her writing at Belinda, who sat motionless, leaning\r\nher head upon her hand, as if deep in thought, Mrs. Stanhope\'s\r\nunfolded letter hanging from her hand. In the midst of the variety of\r\nembarrassing, painful, and alarming feelings excited by this letter, she\r\nhad sufficient strength of mind to adhere to her resolution of speaking\r\nthe exact truth to Lady Delacour. When she was roused by her ladyship\'s\r\nquestion, "No bad news, I hope, Miss Portman?" she instantly answered,\r\nwith all the firmness she could command. "Yes. My aunt has been alarmed\r\nby a strange report which I heard myself for the first time this morning\r\nfrom Mr. Hervey. I am sure I am much obliged to him for having the\r\ncourage to speak the truth to me." Here she repeated what Mr. Hervey had\r\nsaid to her. Lady Delacour never raised her eyes whilst Belinda spoke,\r\nbut went on scratching out some words in what she was writing. Through\r\nthe mask of paint which she wore no change of colour could be visible;\r\nand as Belinda did not see the expression of her ladyship\'s eyes, she\r\ncould not in the least judge of what was passing in her mind.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hervey has acted like a man of honour and sense," said Lady\r\nDelacour; "but it is a pity, for your sake, he did not speak\r\nsooner--before this report became so public--before it reached Bath, and\r\nyour aunt. Though it could not surprise her much, she has such a perfect\r\nknowledge of the world, and ----"\r\n\r\nLady Delacour uttered these broken sentences in a voice of suppressed\r\nanger; cleared her throat several times, and at last, unable to speak,\r\nstopped short, and then began with much precipitation to put wafers into\r\nseveral notes that she had been writing. So it has reached Bath, thought\r\nshe--the report is public! I never till now heard a hint of any such\r\nthing except from Sir Philip Baddely; but it has doubtless been the\r\ncommon talk of the town, and I am laughed at as a dupe and an idiot, as\r\nI am. And now, when the thing can he concealed no longer, she comes to\r\nme with that face of simplicity, and knowing my generous temper, throws\r\nherself on my mercy, and trusts that her speaking to me with this\r\naudacious plainness will convince me of her innocence. "You have acted\r\nin the most prudent manner possible, Miss Portman," said her ladyship,\r\nas she went on sealing her notes, "by speaking at once to me of this\r\nstrange, scandalous, absurd report. Do you act from your aunt Stanhope\'s\r\nadvice, or entirely from your own judgment and knowledge of my\r\ncharacter?"\r\n\r\n"From my own judgment and knowledge of your character, in which I\r\nhope--I am not--I cannot be mistaken," said Belinda, looking at her with\r\na mixture of doubt and astonishment.\r\n\r\n"No--you calculated admirably--\'twas the best, the only thing you could\r\ndo. Only," said her ladyship, falling back in her chair with an hysteric\r\nlaugh, "only the blunder of Champfort, and the entrance of my Lord\r\nDelacour, and the hammercloth with the orange and black fringe--forgive\r\nme, my dear; for the soul of me I can\'t help laughing--it was rather\r\nunlucky; so awkward, such a contretemps! But you," added she, wiping her\r\neyes, as if recovering from laughter, "you have such admirable presence\r\nof mind, nothing disconcerts you! You are equal to all situations,\r\nand stand in no need of such long letters of advice from your aunt\r\nStanhope," pointing to the two folio sheets which lay at Belinda\'s feet.\r\n\r\nThe rapid, unconnected manner in which Lady Delacour spoke, the hurry of\r\nher motions, the quick, suspicious, angry glances of her eye, her laugh,\r\nher unintelligible words, all conspired at this moment to give Belinda\r\nthe idea that her intellects were suddenly disordered. She was so firmly\r\npersuaded of her ladyship\'s utter indifference to Lord Delacour, that\r\nshe never conceived the possibility of her being actuated by the passion\r\nof jealousy--by the jealousy of power--a species of jealousy which she\r\nhad never felt, and could not comprehend. But she had sometimes seen\r\nLady Delacour in starts of passion that seemed to border on insanity,\r\nand the idea of her losing all command of her reason now struck Belinda\r\nwith irresistible force. She felt the necessity of preserving her own\r\ncomposure; and with all the calmness that she could assume, she took\r\nup her aunt Stanhope\'s letter, and looked for the passage in which Mrs.\r\nLuttridge and Harriot Freke were mentioned. If I can turn the course of\r\nLady Delacour\'s mind, thought she, or catch her attention, perhaps she\r\nwill recover herself. "Here is a message to you, my dear Lady Delacour,"\r\ncried she, "from my aunt Stanhope, about--about Mrs. Luttridge."\r\n\r\nMiss Portman\'s hand trembled as she turned over the pages of the letter.\r\n"I am all attention," said Lady Delacour, with a composed voice; "only\r\ntake care, don\'t make a mistake: I\'m in no hurry; don\'t read any thing\r\nMrs. Stanhope might not wish. It is dangerous to garble letters, almost\r\nas dangerous as to snatch them out of a friend\'s hand, as I once did,\r\nyou know--but you need not now be under the least alarm."\r\n\r\nConscious that this letter was not fit for her ladyship to see, Belinda\r\nneither offered to show it to her, nor attempted any apology for\r\nher reserve and embarrassment, but hastily began to read the message\r\nrelative to Mrs. Luttridge; her voice gaining confidence as she went on,\r\nas she observed that she had fixed Lady Delacour\'s attention, who now\r\nsat listening to her, calm and motionless. But when Miss Portman came\r\nto the words, "Do not forget to tell Lady D ----, that I have a charming\r\nanecdote for her about another _friend_ of hers, who lately went over\r\nto the enemy," her ladyship exclaimed with great vehemence,\r\n"_Friend_!--Harriot Freke!--Yes, like all other friends--Harriot\r\nFreke!--What was she compared to? \'Tis too much for me--too much!" and\r\nshe put her hand to her head.\r\n\r\n"Compose yourself, my dear _friend_," said Belinda, in a calm, gentle\r\ntone; and she went toward her with an intention of soothing her by\r\ncaresses; but, at her approach, Lady Delacour pushed the table on which\r\nshe had been writing from her with violence, started up, flung back the\r\nveil which fell over her face as she rose, and darted upon Belinda a\r\nlook, which fixed her to the spot where she stood. It said, "Come not a\r\nstep nearer, at your peril!" Belinda\'s blood ran cold--she had no longer\r\nany doubt that this was insanity. She shut the penknife which lay upon\r\nthe table, and put it into her pocket.\r\n\r\n"Cowardly creature!" cried Lady Delacour, and her countenance changed to\r\nthe expression of ineffable contempt; "what is it you fear?"\r\n\r\n"That you should injure yourself. Sit down--for Heaven\'s sake listen to\r\nme, to your friend, to Belinda!"\r\n\r\n"My friend! my Belinda!" cried Lady Delacour, and she turned from her,\r\nand walked away some steps in silence; then suddenly clasping her hands,\r\nshe raised her eyes to heaven with a fervent but wild expression of\r\ndevotion, and exclaimed, "Great God of heaven, my punishment is just!\r\nthe death of Lawless is avenged. May the present agony of my soul\r\nexpiate my folly! Of guilt--deliberate guilt--of hypocrisy--treachery--I\r\nhave not--oh, never may I have--to repent!"\r\n\r\nShe paused--her eyes involuntarily returned upon Belinda. "Oh, Belinda!\r\nYou, whom I have so loved--so trusted!"\r\n\r\nThe tears rolled fast down her painted cheeks; she wiped them hastily\r\naway, and so roughly, that her face became a strange and ghastly\r\nspectacle. Unconscious of her disordered appearance, she rushed past\r\nBelinda, who vainly attempted to stop her, threw up the sash, and\r\nstretching herself far out of the window, gasped for breath. Miss\r\nPortman drew her back, and closed the window, saying, "The rouge is all\r\noff your face, my dear Lady Delacour; you are not fit to be seen. Sit\r\ndown upon this sofa, and I will ring for Marriott, and get some fresh\r\nrouge. Look at your face in this glass--you see--"\r\n\r\n"I see," interrupted Lady Delacour, looking full at Belinda, "that she\r\nwho I thought had the noblest of souls has the meanest! I see that she\r\nis incapable of feeling. _Rouge! not fit to be seen_!--At such a time\r\nas this, to talk to me in this manner! Oh, niece of Mrs.\r\nStanhope!--dupe!--dupe that I am!" She flung herself upon the sofa,\r\nand struck her forehead with her hand violently several times. Belinda\r\ncatching her arm, and holding it with all her force, cried in a tone of\r\nauthority, "Command yourself, Lady Delacour, I conjure you, or you will\r\ngo out of your senses; and if you do, your secret will be discovered by\r\nthe whole world."\r\n\r\n"Hold me not--you have no right," cried Lady Delacour, struggling to\r\nfree her hand. "All-powerful as you are in this house, you have no\r\nlonger any power over me! I am not going out of my senses! You cannot\r\nget me into Bedlam, all-powerful, all-artful as you are. You have done\r\nenough to drive me mad--but I am not mad. No wonder you cannot believe\r\nme--no wonder you are astonished at the strong expression of feelings\r\nthat are foreign to your nature--no wonder that you mistake the\r\nwrithings of the heart, the agony of a generous soul, for madness! Look\r\nnot so terrified; I will do you no injury. Do not you hear that I can\r\nlower my voice?--do not you see that I can be calm? Could Mrs. Stanhope\r\nherself--could _you_, Miss Portman, speak in a softer, milder, more\r\npolite, more proper tone than I do now? Are you pleased, are you\r\nsatisfied?"\r\n\r\n"I am better satisfied--a little better satisfied," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"That\'s well; but still you tremble. There\'s not the least occasion for\r\napprehension--you see I can command myself, and smile upon you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do not smile in that horrid manner!"\r\n\r\n"Why not?--\'Horrid!--Don\'t you love deceit?"\r\n\r\n"I detest it from my soul."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Lady Delacour, still speaking in the same low, soft,\r\nunnatural voice: "then why do you practise it, my love?"\r\n\r\n"I never practised it for a moment--I am incapable of deceit. When you\r\nare _really_ calm, when you can _really_ command yourself, you will do\r\nme justice, Lady Delacour; but now it is my business, if I can, to bear\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\n"You are goodness itself, and gentleness, and prudence personified. You\r\nknow perfectly how to _manage_ a friend, whom you fear you have driven\r\njust to the verge of madness. But tell me, good, gentle, prudent Miss\r\nPortman, why need you dread so much that I should go mad? You know, if\r\nI went mad, nobody would mind, nobody would believe whatever I say--I\r\nshould be no evidence against you, and I should be out of your way\r\nsufficiently, shouldn\'t I? And you would have all the power in your own\r\nhands, would not you? And would not this be almost as well as if I were\r\ndead and buried? No; your calculations are better than mine. The poor\r\nmad wife would still be in your way, would yet stand between you and the\r\nfond object of your secret soul--a coronet!"\r\n\r\nAs she pronounced the word _coronet_, she pointed to a coronet set\r\nin diamonds on her watch-case, which lay on the table. Then suddenly\r\nseizing the watch, she dashed it upon the marble hearth with all her\r\nforce--"Vile bauble!" cried she; "must I lose my only friend for such\r\na thing as you? Oh, Belinda! do you see that a coronet cannot confer\r\nhappiness?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen it long: I pity you from the bottom of my soul," said\r\nBelinda, bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n"Pity me not. I cannot endure your pity, treacherous woman!" cried\r\nLady Delacour, and she stamped with a look of rage--"most perfidious of\r\nwomen!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, call me perfidious, treacherous--stamp at me--say, do what you\r\nwill; I can and will bear it all--all patiently; for I am innocent, and\r\nyou are mistaken and unhappy," said Belinda. "You will love me when you\r\nreturn to your senses; then how can I be angry with you?"\r\n\r\n"Fondle me not," said Lady Delacour, starting back from Belinda\'s\r\ncaresses: "do not degrade yourself to no purpose--I never more can be\r\nyour dupe. Your protestations of innocence are wasted on me--I am not so\r\nblind as you imagine--dupe as you think me, I have seen much in silence.\r\nThe whole world, you find, suspects you now. To save your reputation,\r\nyou want my friendship--you want--"\r\n\r\n"I want nothing from you, Lady Delacour," said Belinda. "_You have\r\nsuspected me long in silence!_ then I have mistaken your character--I\r\ncan love you no longer. Farewell for ever! Find another--a better\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\nShe walked away from Lady Delacour with proud indignation; but, before\r\nshe reached the door, she recollected her promise to remain with this\r\nunfortunate woman.\r\n\r\nIs a dying woman, in the paroxysm of insane passion, a fit object\r\nof indignation? thought Belinda, and she stopped short. "No, Lady\r\nDelacour," cried she, "I will not yield to my humour--I will not listen\r\nto my pride. A few words said in the heat of passion shall not make me\r\nforget myself or you. You have given me your confidence; I am grateful\r\nfor it. I cannot, will not desert you: my promise is sacred."\r\n\r\n"Your promise!" said Lady Delacour, contemptuously. "I absolve you from\r\nyour promise. Unless you find it _convenient_ to yourself to remember\r\nit, pray let it be forgotten; and if I must die--"\r\n\r\nAt this instant the door opened suddenly, and little Helena came in\r\nsinging--\r\n\r\n    "\'Merrily, merrily shall we live now,\r\n    Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.\'\r\n\r\nWhat comes next, Miss Portman?"\r\n\r\nLady Delacour dragged her veil across her face, and rushed out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?--Is mamma ill?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear," said Belinda. But at this instant she heard the sound of\r\nLord Delacour\'s voice upon the stairs; she broke from the little girl,\r\nand with the greatest precipitation retreated to her own room.\r\n\r\nShe had not been alone above an hour before Marriott knocked at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman, you don\'t know how late it is. Lady Singleton and the\r\nMiss Singletons are come. But, merciful heaven!" exclaimed Marriott, as\r\nshe entered the room, "what is all this packing up? What is this trunk?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to Oakly-park with Lady Anne Percival," said Belinda,\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\n"I thought there was something wrong; my mind misgave me all the time I\r\nwas dressing my lady,--she was in such a flutter, and never spoke to me.\r\nI\'d lay my life this is, some way or other, Mr. Champfort\'s doings. But,\r\ngood dear Miss Portman, can you leave my poor lady when she wants you\r\nso much; and I\'ll take upon me to say, ma\'am, loves you so much at the\r\nbottom of her heart? Dear me, how your face is flushed! Pray let me pack\r\nup these things, if it must be. But I do hope, if it be possible, that\r\nyou should stay. However, I\'ve no business to speak. I beg pardon for\r\nbeing so impertinent: I hope you won\'t take it ill,--it is only from\r\nregard to my poor lady I ventured to speak."\r\n\r\n"Your regard to your lady deserves the highest approbation, Marriott,"\r\nsaid Belinda. "It is impossible that I should stay with her any longer.\r\nWhen I am gone, good Marriott, and when her health and strength decline,\r\nyour fidelity and your services will be absolutely necessary to your\r\nmistress; and from what I have seen of the goodness of your heart, I\r\nam convinced that the more she is in want of you, the more _respectful_\r\nwill be your attention."\r\n\r\nMarriott answered only by her tears, and went on packing up in a great\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nNothing could equal Lady Delacour\'s astonishment when she learnt from\r\nMarriott that Miss Portman was actually preparing to leave the house.\r\nAfter a moment\'s reflection, however, she persuaded herself that this\r\nwas only a new artifice to work upon her affections; that Belinda did\r\nnot mean to leave her; but that she would venture all lengths, in hopes\r\nof being at the last moment pressed to stay. Under this persuasion, Lady\r\nDelacour resolved to disappoint her expectations: she determined to meet\r\nher with that polite coldness which would best become her own dignity,\r\nand which, without infringing the laws of hospitality, would effectually\r\npoint out to the world that Lady Delacour was no dupe, and that Miss\r\nPortman was an unwelcome inmate in her house.\r\n\r\nThe power of assuming gaiety when her heart was a prey to the most\r\npoignant feelings, she had completely acquired by long practice. With\r\nthe promptitude of an actress, she could instantly appear upon the\r\nstage, and support a character totally foreign to her own. The loud\r\nknocks at the door, which announced the arrival of company, were signals\r\nthat operated punctually upon her associations; and to this species of\r\nconventional necessity her most violent passions submitted with magical\r\ncelerity. Fresh rouged, and beautifully dressed, she was performing her\r\npart to a brilliant audience in her drawing-room when Belinda entered.\r\nBelinda beheld her with much astonishment, but more pity.\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman," said her ladyship, turning carelessly towards her,\r\n"where do you buy your rouge?--Lady Singleton, would you rather at this\r\nmoment be mistress of the philosopher\'s stone, or have a patent for\r\nrouge that will come and go like Miss Portman\'s?--Apropos! have you read\r\nSt. Leon?" Her ladyship was running on to a fresh train of ideas, when a\r\nfootman announced the arrival of Lady Anne Percival\'s carriage; and Miss\r\nPortman rose to depart.\r\n\r\n"You dine with Lady Anne, Miss Portman, I understand?--My compliments to\r\nher ladyship, and my duty to Mrs. Margaret Delacour, and her macaw. _Au\r\nrevoir_! Though you talk of running away from me to Oakly-park, I am\r\nsure you will do no such cruel thing. I am, with all due humility, so\r\nconfident of the irresistible attractions of this house, that I defy\r\nOakly-park and all its charms. So, Miss Portman, instead of adieu, I\r\nshall only say, _au revoir!_"\r\n\r\n"Adieu, Lady Delacour!" said Belinda, with a look and tone which struck\r\nher ladyship to the heart. All her suspicions, all her pride, all her\r\naffected gaiety vanished; her presence of mind forsook her, and for some\r\nmoments she stood motionless and powerless. Then recollecting herself,\r\nshe flew after Miss Portman, abruptly stopped her at the head of the\r\nstairs, and exclaimed, "My dearest Belinda, are you gone?--My best, my\r\nonly friend!--Say you are not gone for ever!--Say you will return!"\r\n\r\n"Adieu!" repeated Belinda. It was all she could say; she broke from Lady\r\nDelacour, and hurried out of the house with the strongest feeling of\r\ncompassion for this unhappy woman, but with an unaltered sense of the\r\npropriety and necessity of her own firmness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC HAPPINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an air of benevolence and perfect sincerity in the politeness\r\nwith which Lady Anne Percival received Belinda, that was peculiarly\r\nagreeable to her agitated and harassed mind.\r\n\r\n"You see, Lady Anne," said Belinda, "that I come to you at last, after\r\nhaving so often refused your kind invitations."\r\n\r\n"So you surrender yourself at discretion, just when I was going to raise\r\nthe siege in despair," said Lady Anne: "now I may make my own terms; and\r\nthe only terms I shall impose are, that you will stay at Oakly-park with\r\nus, as long as we can make it agreeable to you, and no longer. Whether\r\nthose who cease to please, or those who cease to be pleased, are most to\r\nblame,[6] it may sometimes be difficult to determine; so difficult,\r\nthat when this becomes a question between two friends, they perhaps had\r\nbetter part than venture upon the discussion."\r\n\r\nLady Anne Percival could not avoid suspecting that something\r\ndisagreeable had passed between Lady Delacour and Belinda; but she\r\nwas not troubled with the disease of idle curiosity, and her example\r\nprevailed upon Mrs. Margaret Delacour, who dined with her, to refrain\r\nfrom all questions and comments.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice which this lady had conceived against our heroine, as\r\nbeing a niece of Mrs. Stanhope\'s, had lately been vanquished by the\r\nfavourable representations of her conduct which she had heard from her\r\nnephew, and by the kindness that Belinda had shown to little Helena.\r\n\r\n"Madam," said Mrs. Delacour, addressing herself to Miss Portman\r\nwith some formality, but much dignity, "permit me, as one of my Lord\r\nDelacour\'s nearest relations now living, to return you my thanks for\r\nhaving, as my nephew informs me, exerted your influence over Lady\r\nDelacour for the happiness of his family. My little Helena, I am sure,\r\nfeels her obligations towards you, and I rejoice that I have had an\r\nopportunity of expressing, in person, my sense of what our family owes\r\nto Miss Portman. As to the rest, her own heart will reward her. The\r\npraise of the world is but an inferior consideration. However, it\r\ndeserves to be mentioned, as an instance of the world\'s candour, and\r\nfor the singularity of the case, that every body agrees in speaking well\r\neven of so handsome a young lady as Miss Portman."\r\n\r\n"She must have had extraordinary prudence," said Lady Anne; "and the\r\nworld does justly to reward it with extraordinary esteem."\r\n\r\nBelinda, with equal pleasure and surprise, observed that all this was\r\nsaid sincerely, and that the report, which she had feared was public,\r\nhad never reached Mrs. Delacour or Lady Anne Percival.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was known and believed only by those who had been prejudiced\r\nby the malice or folly of Sir Philip Baddely. Piqued by the manner in\r\nwhich his addresses had been received by Belinda, he readily listened to\r\nthe comfortable words of his valet de chambre, who assured him that he\r\nhad it from the best possible authority (Lord Delacour\'s own gentleman,\r\nMr. Champfort), that his lordship was deeply _taken_ with Miss\r\nPortman--that the young lady managed every thing in the house--that she\r\nhad been very prudent, to be sure, and had refused large presents--but\r\nthat there was no doubt of her becoming Lady Delacour, if ever his\r\nlordship should be at liberty. Sir Philip was the person who mentioned\r\nthis to Clarence Hervey, and Sir Philip was the person who hinted it\r\nto Mrs. Stanhope, in the very letter which he wrote to implore\r\nher influence in favour of his own proposal. This manoeuvring lady\r\nrepresented this report as being universally known and believed, in\r\nhopes of frightening her niece into an immediate match with the baronet.\r\nIn the whole extent of Mrs. Stanhope\'s politic imagination, she had\r\nnever foreseen the possibility of her niece\'s speaking the simple truth\r\nto Lady Delacour, and she had never guarded against this danger. She\r\nnever thought of Belinda\'s mentioning this report to her ladyship,\r\nbecause she would never have dealt so openly, had she been in the place\r\nof her niece. Thus her art and falsehood operated against her own views,\r\nand produced consequences diametrically opposite to her expectations.\r\nIt was her exaggerations that made Lady Delacour believe, when Belinda\r\nrepeated what she had said, that this report was universally known and\r\ncredited; her own suspicions were by these means again awakened, and her\r\njealousy and rage were raised to such a pitch, that, no longer mistress\r\nof herself, she insulted her friend and guest. Miss Portman was then\r\nobliged to do the very thing that Mrs. Stanhope most dreaded--to leave\r\nLady Delacour\'s house and all its advantages. As to Sir Philip Baddely,\r\nBelinda never thought of him from the moment she read her aunt\'s letter,\r\ntill after she had left her ladyship; her mind was firmly decided upon\r\nthis subject; yet she could not help fearing that her aunt would not\r\nunderstand her reasons, or approve her conduct. She wrote to Mrs.\r\nStanhope in the most kind and respectful manner; assured her that there\r\nhad been no foundation whatever for the report which had produced\r\nso much uneasiness; that Lord Delacour had always treated her with\r\npoliteness and good-nature, but that such thoughts or views as had been\r\nattributed to him, she was convinced had never entered his lordship\'s\r\nmind; that hearing of the publicity of this report had, however, _much\r\naffected_ Lady D----. "I have, therefore," said Belinda, "thought it\r\nprudent to quit her ladyship, and to accept of an invitation from Lady\r\nAnne Percival to Oakly-park. I hope, my dear aunt, that you will not be\r\ndispleased by my leaving town without seeing Sir Philip Baddely again.\r\nOur meeting could indeed answer no purpose, as it is entirely out of my\r\npower to return his partiality. Of his character, temper, and manners,\r\nI know enough to be convinced, that our union could tend only to make\r\nus both miserable. After what I have seen, nothing can ever tempt me to\r\nmarry from any of the common views of interest or ambition."\r\n\r\nOn this subject Belinda, though she declared her own sentiments with\r\nfirm sincerity, touched as slightly as she could, because she anxiously\r\nwished to avoid all appearance of _braving_ the opinions of an aunt to\r\nwhom she was under obligations. She was tempted to pass over in silence\r\nall that part of Mrs. Stanhope\'s letter which related to Clarence\r\nHervey; but upon reflection, she determined to conquer her repugnance\r\nto speak of him, and to make perfect sincerity the steady rule of her\r\nconduct. She therefore acknowledged to her aunt, that of all the persons\r\nshe had hitherto seen, this gentleman was the most agreeable to her; but\r\nat the same time she assured her, that the refusal of Sir Philip Baddely\r\nwas totally independent of all thoughts of Mr. Hervey--that, before she\r\nhad received her aunt\'s letter, circumstances had convinced her that Mr.\r\nHervey was attached to another woman. She concluded by saying, that she\r\nhad neither romantic hopes nor wishes, and that her affections were at\r\nher own command.\r\n\r\nBelinda received the following angry answer from Mrs. Stanhope:--\r\n\r\n"Henceforward, Belinda, you may manage your own affairs as you think\r\nproper; I shall never more interfere with my advice. Refuse whom you\r\nplease--go where you please--get what friends, and what admirers, and\r\nwhat establishment you can--I have nothing more to do with it--I will\r\nnever more undertake the management of young people. There\'s your sister\r\nTollemache has made a pretty return for all my kindness! she is going to\r\nbe parted from her husband, and basely throws all the blame upon me. But\r\n\'tis the same with all of you. There\'s your cousin Joddrell refused me a\r\nhundred guineas last week, though the piano-forte and harp I bought\r\nfor her before she was married stood me in double that sum, and are\r\nnow useless lumber on my hands; and she never could have had Joddrell\r\nwithout them, as she knows as well as I do. As for Mrs. Levit, she\r\nnever writes to me, and takes no manner of notice of me. But this is no\r\nmatter, for her notice can be of no consequence now to any body. Levit\r\nhas run out every thing he had in the world!--All his fine estates\r\nadvertised in to-day\'s paper--an execution in the House, I\'m told. I\r\nexpect that she will have the assurance to come to me in her distress:\r\nbut she shall find my doors shut, I promise her. Your cousin Valleton\'s\r\nmatch has, through her own folly, turned out like all the rest. She, her\r\nhusband, and all his relations are at daggers-drawing; and Valleton will\r\ndie soon, and won\'t leave her a farthing in his will, I foresee, and all\r\nthe fine Valleton estate goes to God knows whom!\r\n\r\n"If she had taken my advice after marriage as before, it would have been\r\nall her own at this instant. But the passions run away with people, and\r\nthey forget every thing--common sense, gratitude, and all--as you\r\ndo, Belinda. Clarence Hervey will never think of you, and I give you\r\nup!--Now manage for yourself as you please, and as you can! I\'ll have\r\nnothing more to do with the affairs of young ladies who will take no\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n"SELINA STANHOPE.\r\n\r\n"P. S. If you return directly to Lady Delacour\'s, and marry Sir Philip\r\nBaddely, I will forgive the past."\r\n\r\nThe regret which Belinda felt at having grievously offended her aunt was\r\nsomewhat alleviated by the reflection that she had acted with integrity\r\nand prudence. Thrown off her guard by anger, Mrs. Stanhope had\r\ninadvertently furnished her niece with the best possible reasons against\r\nfollowing her advice with regard to Sir Philip Baddely, by stating that\r\nher sister and cousins, who had married with mercenary views, had made\r\nthemselves miserable, and had shown their aunt neither gratitude nor\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe tranquillity of Belinda\'s mind was gradually restored by the society\r\nthat she enjoyed at Oakly-park. She found herself in the midst of a\r\nlarge and cheerful family, with whose domestic happiness she could\r\nnot forbear to sympathize. There was an affectionate confidence, an\r\nunconstrained gaiety in this house, which forcibly struck her, from its\r\ncontrast with what she had seen at Lady Delacour\'s. She perceived that\r\nbetween Mr. Percival and Lady Anne there was a union of interests,\r\noccupations, taste, and affection. She was at first astonished by the\r\nopenness with which they talked of their affairs in her presence; that\r\nthere were no family secrets, nor any of those petty mysteries\r\nwhich arise from a discordance of temper or struggle for power. In\r\nconversation, every person expressed without constraint their wishes and\r\nopinions; and wherever these differed, reason and the general good were\r\nthe standards to which they appealed. The elder and younger part of the\r\nfamily were not separated from each other; even the youngest child in\r\nthe house seemed to form part of the society, to have some share and\r\ninterest in the general occupations or amusements The children\r\nwere treated neither as slaves nor as playthings, but as reasonable\r\ncreatures; and the ease with which they were managed, and with which\r\nthey managed themselves, surprised Belinda; for she heard none of that\r\ncontinual lecturing which goes forward in some houses, to the great\r\nfatigue and misery of all the parties concerned, and of all the\r\nspectators. Without force or any factitious excitements, the taste for\r\nknowledge, and the habits of application, were induced by example, and\r\nconfirmed by sympathy. Mr. Percival was a man of science and literature,\r\nand his daily pursuits and general conversation were in the happiest\r\nmanner instructive and interesting to his family. His knowledge of the\r\nworld, and his natural gaiety of disposition, rendered his conversation\r\nnot only useful, but in the highest degree amusing. From the merest\r\ntrifles he could lead to some scientific fact, some happy literary\r\nallusion, or philosophical investigation.\r\n\r\nLady Anne Percival had, without any pedantry or ostentation, much\r\naccurate knowledge, and a taste for literature, which made her the\r\nchosen companion of her husband\'s understanding, as well as of his\r\nheart. He was not obliged to reserve his conversation for friends of\r\nhis own sex, nor was he forced to seclude himself in the pursuit of any\r\nbranch of knowledge; the partner of his warmest affections was also\r\nthe partner of his most serious occupations; and her sympathy and\r\napprobation, and the daily sense of her success in the education of\r\ntheir children, inspired him with a degree of happy social energy,\r\nunknown to the selfish solitary votaries of avarice and ambition.\r\n\r\nIn this large and happy family there was a variety of pursuits. One\r\nof the boys was fond of chemistry, another of gardening; one of the\r\ndaughters had a talent for painting, another for music; and all their\r\nacquirements and accomplishments contributed to increase their mutual\r\nhappiness, for there was no envy or jealousy amongst them.\r\n\r\nThose who unfortunately have never enjoyed domestic happiness, such as\r\nwe have just described, will perhaps suppose the picture to be visionary\r\nand romantic; there are others--it is hoped many others--who will\r\nfeel that it is drawn from truth and real life. Tastes that have been\r\nvitiated by the stimulus of dissipation might, perhaps, think these\r\nsimple pleasures insipid.\r\n\r\nEvery body must ultimately judge of what makes them happy, from the\r\ncomparison of their own feelings in different situations. Belinda was\r\nconvinced by this comparison, that domestic life was that which could\r\nalone make her really and permanently happy. She missed none of the\r\npleasures, none of the gay company, to which she had been accustomed at\r\nLady Delacour\'s. She was conscious, at the end of each day, that it had\r\nbeen agreeably spent; yet there were no extraordinary exertions made to\r\nentertain her; every thing seemed in its natural course, and so did\r\nher mind. Where there was so much happiness, no want of what is called\r\n_pleasure_ was ever experienced. She had not been at Oakly-park a week\r\nbefore she forgot that it was within a few miles of Harrowgate, and she\r\nnever once recollected her vicinity to this fashionable water-drinking\r\nplace for a month afterwards.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" some young ladies will exclaim. We hope others will feel\r\nthat it was perfectly natural. But to deal fairly with our readers, we\r\nmust not omit to mention a certain Mr. Vincent, who came to Oakly-park\r\nduring the first week of Belinda\'s visit, and who stayed there during\r\nthe whole succeeding month of felicity. Mr. Vincent was a creole; he was\r\nabout two-and-twenty: his person and manners were striking and engaging;\r\nhe was tall, and remarkably handsome; he had large dark eyes, an\r\naquiline nose, fine hair, and a manly sunburnt complexion; his\r\ncountenance was open and friendly, and when he spoke upon any\r\ninteresting subject, it lighted up, and became full of fire and\r\nanimation. He used much gesture in conversation; he had not the common\r\nmanners of young men who are, or who aim at being thought, fashionable,\r\nbut he was perfectly at ease in company, and all that was uncommon about\r\nhim appeared foreign. He had a frank, ardent temper, incapable of art\r\nor dissimulation, and so unsuspicious of all mankind, that he could\r\nscarcely believe falsehood existed in the world, even after he had\r\nhimself been its dupe. He was in extreme astonishment at the detection\r\nof any species of baseness in a _gentleman_; for he considered honour\r\nand generosity as belonging indefeasibly, if not exclusively, to the\r\nprivileged orders. His notions of virtue were certainly aristocratic in\r\nthe extreme, but his ambition was to entertain such only as would best\r\nsupport and dignify an aristocracy. His pride was magnanimous, not\r\ninsolent; and his social prejudices were such as, in some degree, to\r\nsupply the place of the power and habit of reasoning, in which he was\r\ntotally deficient. One principle of philosophy he practically possessed\r\nin perfection; he enjoyed the present, undisturbed by any unavailing\r\nregret for the past, or troublesome solicitude about the future. All the\r\ngoods of life he tasted with epicurean zest; all the evils he bore with\r\nstoical indifference. The mere pleasure of existence seemed to keep him\r\nin perpetual good humour with himself and others; and his never-failing\r\nflow of animal spirits exhilarated even the most phlegmatic. To persons\r\nof a cold and reserved temper he sometimes appeared rather too much\r\nof an egotist: for he talked with fluent enthusiasm of the excellent\r\nqualities and beauties of whatever he loved, whether it were his dog,\r\nhis horse, or his country: but this was not the egotism of vanity; it\r\nwas the overflowing of an affectionate heart, confident of obtaining\r\nsympathy from his fellow-creatures, because conscious of feeling it for\r\nall that existed.\r\n\r\nHe was as grateful as he was generous; and though high-spirited and\r\nimpatient of restraint, he would submit with affectionate gentleness to\r\nthe voice of a friend, or listen with deference to the counsel of those\r\nin whose superior judgment he had confidence. Gratitude, respect, and\r\naffection, all conspired to give Mr. Percival the strongest power over\r\nhis soul. Mr. Percival had been a guardian and a father to him. His own\r\nfather, an opulent merchant, on his death-bed requested that his son,\r\nwho was then about eighteen, might be immediately sent to England for\r\nthe advantages of a European education. Mr. Percival, who had a\r\nregard for the father, arising from circumstances which it is not here\r\nnecessary to explain, accepted the charge of young Vincent, and managed\r\nso well, that his ward when he arrived at the age of twenty-one did not\r\nfeel relieved from any restraint. On the contrary, his attachment to his\r\nguardian increased from that period, when the laws gave him full command\r\nover his fortune and his actions. Mr. Vincent had been at Harrowgate for\r\nsome time before Mr. Percival came into the country; but as soon as\r\nhe heard of Mr. Percival\'s arrival, he left half finished a game of\r\nbilliards, of which, by-the-bye, he was extremely fond, to pay his\r\nrespects at Oakly-park. At the first sight of Belinda, he did not seem\r\nmuch struck with her appearance; perhaps, from his thinking that there\r\nwas too little languor in her eyes, and too much colour in her cheeks;\r\nhe confessed that she was graceful, but her motions were not quite slow\r\nenough to please him.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat singular that Lady Delacour\'s faithful friend, Harriot\r\nFreke, should be the cause of Mr. Vincent\'s first fixing his favourable\r\nattention on Miss Portman.\r\n\r\nHe had a black servant of the name of Juba, who was extremely attached\r\nto him: he had known Juba from a boy, and had brought him over with\r\nhim when he first came to England, because the poor fellow begged so\r\nearnestly to go with young massa. Juba had lived with him ever since,\r\nand accompanied him wherever he went. Whilst he was at Harrowgate, Mr.\r\nVincent lodged in the same house with Mrs. Freke. Some dispute arose\r\nbetween their servants, about the right to a coach-house, which each\r\nparty claimed as exclusively their own. The master of the house was\r\nappealed to by Juba, who sturdily maintained his massa\'s right; he\r\nestablished it, and rolled his massa\'s curricle into the coach-house in\r\ntriumph. Mrs. Freke, who heard and saw the whole transaction from her\r\nwindow, said, or swore, that she would make Juba repent of what she\r\ncalled his insolence. The threat was loud enough to reach his ears, and\r\nhe looked up in astonishment to hear such a voice from a woman; but an\r\ninstant afterwards he began to sing very gaily, as he jumped into the\r\ncurricle to turn the cushions, and then danced himself up and down by\r\nthe springs, as if rejoicing in his victory. A second and a third time\r\nMrs. Freke repeated her threat, confirming it by an oath, and then\r\nviolently shut down the window and disappeared. Mr. Vincent, to whom\r\nJuba, with much simplicity, expressed his aversion of the _man-woman_\r\nwho lived in the house with them, laughed at the odd manner in which the\r\nblack imitated her voice and gesture, but thought no more of the matter.\r\nSome time afterward, however, Juba\'s spirits forsook him; he was never\r\nheard to sing or to whistle, he scarcely ever spoke even to his master,\r\nwho was much surprised by this sudden change from gaiety and loquacity\r\nto melancholy taciturnity. Nothing could draw from the poor fellow any\r\nexplanation of the cause of this alteration in his humour; and though\r\nhe seemed excessively grateful for the concern which his master showed\r\nabout his health, no kindness or amusement could restore him to his\r\nwonted cheerfulness. Mr. Vincent knew that he was passionately fond of\r\nmusic; and having heard him once express a wish for a tambourine, he\r\ngave him one: but Juba never played upon it, and his spirits seemed\r\nevery day to grow worse and worse. This melancholy lasted during the\r\nwhole time that he remained at Harrowgate, but from the first day of his\r\narrival at Oakly-park he began to mend: after he had been there a week,\r\nhe was heard to sing, and whistle, and talk as he used to do, and his\r\nmaster congratulated him upon his recovery. One evening his master\r\nasked him to go back to Harrowgate for his tambourine, as little Charles\r\nPercival wished to hear him play upon it. This simple request had a\r\nwonderful effect upon poor Juba; he began to tremble from head to foot,\r\nhis eyes became fixed, and he stood motionless; after some time, he\r\nsuddenly clasped his hands, fell upon his knees, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Oh, massa, Juba die! If Juba go back, Juba die!" and he wiped away the\r\ndrops that stood upon his forehead. "But me will go, if massa bid--me\r\nwill die!"\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent began to imagine that the poor fellow was out of his senses.\r\nHe assured him, with the greatest kindness, that he would almost as soon\r\nhazard his own life as that of such a faithful, affectionate servant;\r\nbut he pressed him to explain what possible danger he dreaded from\r\nreturning to Harrowgate. Juba was silent, as if afraid to speak--"Don\'t\r\nfear to speak to me," said Mr. Vincent; "I will defend you: if anybody\r\nhave injured you, or if you dread that any body will injure you, trust\r\nto me; I will protect you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, massa, you no can! Me die, if me go back! Me no can say word more;"\r\nand he put his finger upon his lips, and shook his head. Mr. Vincent\r\nknew that Juba was excessively superstitious; and convinced, that, if\r\nhis mind were not already deranged, it would certainly become so, were\r\nany secret terror thus to prey upon his imagination, he assumed a\r\nvery grave countenance, and assured him, that he should be extremely\r\ndispleased if he persisted in this foolish and obstinate silence.\r\nOvercome by this, Juba burst into tears, and answered:\r\n\r\n"Den me will tell all."\r\n\r\nThis conversation passed before Miss Portman and Charles Percival, who\r\nwere walking in the park with Mr. Vincent, at the time he met Juba and\r\nasked him to go for the tambourine. When he came to the words, "Me will\r\ntell all," he made a sign that he wished to tell it to his master alone.\r\nBelinda and the little boy walked on, to leave him at liberty to speak;\r\nand then, though with a sort of reluctant horror, he told that the\r\nfigure of an old woman, all in flames, had appeared to him in his\r\nbedchamber at Harrowgate every night, and that he was sure she was one\r\nof the obeah-women of his own country, who had pursued him to Europe to\r\nrevenge his having once, when he was a child, trampled upon an egg-shell\r\nthat contained some of her poisons. The extreme absurdity of this story\r\nmade Mr. Vincent burst out a laughing; but his humanity the next instant\r\nmade him serious; for the poor victim of superstitious terror, after\r\nhaving revealed what, according to the belief of his country, it is\r\ndeath to mention, fell senseless on the ground. When he came to himself,\r\nhe calmly said, that he knew he must now die, for that the obeah-women\r\nnever forgave those that talked of them or their secrets; and, with a\r\ndeep groan, he added, that he wished he might die before night, that he\r\nmight not see _her_ again. It was in vain to attempt to reason him out\r\nof the idea that he had actually seen this apparition: his account of it\r\nwas, that it first appeared to him in the coach-house one night, when\r\nhe went thither in the dark--that he never afterwards went to the\r\ncoach-house in the dark--but that the same figure of an old woman, all\r\nin flames, appeared at the foot of his bed every night whilst he stayed\r\nat Harrowgate; and that he was then persuaded she would never let him\r\nescape from her power till she had killed him. That since he had left\r\nHarrowgate, however, she had not tormented him, for he had never seen\r\nher, and he was in hopes that she had forgiven him; but that now he was\r\nsure of her vengeance for having spoken of her.\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent knew the astonishing power which the belief in this species\r\nof sorcery[7] has over the minds of the Jamaica negroes; they pine\r\nand actually die away from the moment they fancy themselves under the\r\nmalignant influence of these witches. He almost gave poor Juba over for\r\nlost. The first person that he happened to meet after his conversation\r\nwas Belinda, to whom he eagerly related it, because he had observed,\r\nthat she had listened with much attention and sympathy to the beginning\r\nof the poor fellow\'s story. The moment that she heard of the flaming\r\napparition, she recollected having seen a head drawn in phosphorus,\r\nwhich one of the children had exhibited for her amusement, and it\r\noccurred to her that, perhaps, some imprudent or ill-natured person\r\nmight have terrified the ignorant negro by similar means. When she\r\nmentioned this to Mr. Vincent, he recollected the threat that had been\r\nthrown out by Mrs. Freke, the day that Juba had taken possession of\r\nthe disputed coach-house; and from the character of this lady, Belinda\r\njudged that she would be likely to play such a trick, and to call it,\r\nas usual, fun or frolic. Miss Portman suggested that one of the children\r\nshould show him the phosphorus, and should draw some ludicrous figure\r\nwith it in his presence. This was done, and it had the effect that she\r\nexpected. Juba, familiarized by degrees with the object of his secret\r\nhorror, and convinced that no obeah-woman was exercising over him her\r\nsorceries, recovered his health and spirits. His gratitude to Miss\r\nPortman, who was the immediate cause of his cure, was as simple and\r\ntouching as it was lively and sincere. This was the circumstance which\r\nfirst turned Mr. Vincent\'s attention towards Belinda. Upon examining the\r\nroom in which the negro used to sleep at Harrowgate, the strong smell\r\nof phosphorus was perceived, and part of the paper was burnt on the very\r\nspot where he had always seen the figure, so that he was now perfectly\r\nconvinced that this trick had been purposely played to frighten him, in\r\nrevenge for his having kept possession of the coach-house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Freke, when she found herself detected, gloried in the jest, and\r\ntold the story as a good joke wherever she went--triumphing in the\r\nnotion, that it was she who had driven both _master and man_ from\r\nHarrowgate.\r\n\r\nThe exploit was, however, by no means agreeable in its consequences to\r\nher friend Mrs. Luttridge, who was now at Harrowgate. For reasons of her\r\nown, she was very anxious to fix Mr. Vincent in her society, and she\r\nwas much provoked by Mrs. Freke\'s conduct. The ladies came to high words\r\nupon the occasion, and an irreparable breach would have ensued had\r\nnot Mrs. Freke, in the midst of her rage, recollected Mrs. Luttridge\'s\r\nelectioneering interest: and suddenly changing her tone, she declared\r\nthat "she was really sorry to have driven Mr. Vincent from Harrowgate;\r\nthat her only intention was to get rid of his black; she would lay any\r\nwager, that, with Mrs. Luttridge\'s assistance, they could soon get the\r\ngentleman back again;" and she proposed, as a certain method of\r\nfixing Mr. Vincent in Mrs. Luttridge\'s society, to invite Belinda to\r\nHarrowgate.\r\n\r\n"You may be sure," said Mrs. Freke, "that she must by this time be\r\ncursedly tired of her visit to those stupid good people at Oakly-park,\r\nand never woman _wanted_ an excuse to do any thing she liked: so trust\r\nto her own ingenuity to make some decent apology to the Percivals for\r\nrunning away from them. As to Vincent, you may be sure Belinda Portman\r\nis his only inducement for staying with that precious family-party; and\r\nif we have her we have him. Now we can be sure of her, for she has just\r\nquarrelled with our dear Lady Delacour. I had the whole story from\r\nmy maid, who had it from Champfort. Lady Delacour and she are at\r\ndaggers-drawing, and it will be delicious to her to hear her ladyship\r\nhandsomely abused. We are the declared enemies of her enemy, so we must\r\nbe her friends. Nothing unites folk so quickly and so solidly, as hatred\r\nof some common foe."\r\n\r\nThis argument could not fail to convince Mrs. Luttridge, and the next\r\nday Mrs. Freke commenced her operations. She drove in her _unicorn_ to\r\nOakly-park to pay Miss Portman a visit. She had no acquaintance either\r\nwith Mr. Percival or Lady Anne, and she had always treated Belinda, when\r\nshe met her in town, rather cavalierly, as an humble companion of Lady\r\nDelacour. But it cost Mrs. Freke nothing to change her tone: she was one\r\nof those ladies who can remember or forget people, be perfectly familiar\r\nor strangely rude, just as it suits the convenience, fashion, or humour\r\nof the minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF WOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelinda was alone, and reading, when Mrs. Freke dashed into the room.\r\n\r\n"How do, dear creature?" cried she, stepping up to her, and shaking\r\nhands with her boisterously--"How do?--Glad to see you, faith!--Been\r\nlong here?--Tremendously hot to-day!"\r\n\r\nShe flung herself upon the sofa beside Belinda, threw her hat upon the\r\ntable, and then continued speaking.\r\n\r\n"And how d\'ye go on here, poor child?--Gad! I\'m glad you\'re\r\nalone--expected to find you encompassed by a whole host of the\r\nrighteous. Give me credit for my courage in coming to deliver you out of\r\ntheir hands. Luttridge and I had such compassion upon you, when we heard\r\nyou were close prisoner here! I swore to set the distressed damsel free,\r\nin spite of all the dragons in Christendom; so let me carry you off in\r\ntriumph in my unicorn, and leave these good people to stare when they\r\ncome home from their sober walk, and find you gone. There\'s nothing I\r\nlike so much as to make good people stare--I hope you\'re of my way o\'\r\nthinking---you don\'t look as if you were, though; but I never mind\r\nyoung ladies\' looks--always give the lie to their thoughts. Now we talk\r\no\' looks--never saw you look so well in my life--as handsome as an angel!\r\nAnd so much the better for me. Do you know, I\'ve a bet of twenty guineas\r\non your head--on your face, I mean. There\'s a young bride at Harrowgate,\r\nLady H----, they\'re all mad about her; the men swear she\'s the\r\nhandsomest woman in England, and I swear I know one ten times as\r\nhandsome. They\'ve dared me to make good my word, and I\'ve pledged myself\r\nto produce my beauty at the next ball, and to pit her against their\r\nbelle for any money. Most votes carry it. I\'m willing to double my\r\nbet since I\'ve seen you again. Come, had not we best be off? Now don\'t\r\nrefuse me and make speeches--you know that\'s all nonsense--I\'ll take all\r\nthe blame upon myself."\r\n\r\nBelinda, who had not been suffered to utter a word whilst Mrs. Freke ran\r\non in this strange manner, looked in unfeigned astonishment; but when\r\nshe found herself seized and dragged towards the door, she drew back\r\nwith a degree of gentle firmness that astonished Mrs. Freke. With a\r\nsmiling countenance, but a steady tone, she said, "that she was sorry\r\nMrs. Freke\'s knight-errantry should not be exerted in a better cause,\r\nfor that she was neither a prisoner, nor a distressed damsel."\r\n\r\n"And will you make me lose my bet?" cried Mrs. Freke "Oh, at all events,\r\nyou must come to the ball!--I\'m down for it. But I\'ll not press it now,\r\nbecause you\'re frightened out of your poor little wits, I see, at the\r\nbare thoughts of doing any thing considered out of rule by these good\r\npeople. Well, well! it shall be managed for you--leave that to me: I\'m\r\nused to managing for cowards. Pray tell me--you and Lady Delacour are\r\noff, I understand?--Give ye joy!--She and I were once great friends;\r\nthat is to say, I had over her \'that power which strong minds have over\r\nweak ones,\' but she was too weak for me--one of those people that have\r\nneither courage to be good, nor to be bad."\r\n\r\n"The courage to be bad," said Belinda, "I believe, indeed, she does not\r\npossess."\r\n\r\nMrs. Freke stared. "Why, I heard you had quarrelled with her!"\r\n\r\n"If I had," said Belinda, "I hope that I should still do justice to her\r\nmerits. It is said that people are apt to suffer more by their friends\r\nthan their enemies. I hope that will never be the case with Lady\r\nDelacour, as I confess that I have been one of her friends."\r\n\r\n"\'Gad, I like your spirit--you don\'t want courage, I see, to fight even\r\nfor your enemies. You are just the kind of girl I admire. I see you have\r\nbeen prejudiced against me by Lady Delacour; but whatever stories she\r\nmay have trumped up, the truth of the matter is this, there\'s no living\r\nwith her, she\'s so jealous--so ridiculously jealous--of that lord of\r\nhers, for whom all the time she has the impudence to pretend not to care\r\nmore than I do for the sole of my boot," said Mrs. Freke, striking it,\r\nwith her whip; "but she hasn\'t the courage to give him tit for tat: now\r\nthis is what I call weakness. Pray, how do she and Clarence Hervey go on\r\ntogether?--Are they out o\' the hornbook of platonics yet?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hervey was not in town when I left it," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Was not he?--Ho! ho!--He\'s off then!--Ay, so I prophesied; she\'s not\r\nthe thing for him: he has some strength of mind--some soul--above vulgar\r\nprejudices; so must a woman be to hold him. He was caught at first by\r\nher grace and beauty, and that sort of stuff; but I knew it could not\r\nlast--knew she\'d dilly dally with Clary, till he would turn upon his\r\nheel and leave her there."\r\n\r\n"I fancy that you are entirely mistaken both with respect to Mr. Hervey\r\nand Lady Delacour," Belinda very seriously began to say. But Mrs. Freke\r\ninterrupted her, and ran on; "No! no! no! I\'m not mistaken; Clarence has\r\nfound her out. She\'s a _very_ woman--_that_ he could forgive her, and\r\nso could I; but she\'s a _mere_ woman--and that he can\'t forgive--no more\r\ncan I."\r\n\r\nThere was a kind of drollery about Mrs. Freke, which, with some people,\r\nmade the odd things she said pass for wit. Humour she really possessed;\r\nand when she chose it, she could be diverting to those who like\r\nbuffoonery in women. She had set her heart upon winning Belinda over to\r\nher party. She began by flattery of her beauty; but as she saw that this\r\nhad no effect, she next tried what could be done by insinuating that she\r\nhad a high opinion of her understanding, by talking to her as an esprit\r\nfort.\r\n\r\n"For my part," said she, "I own I should like a strong devil better than\r\na weak angel."\r\n\r\n"You forget," said Belinda, "that it is not Milton, but Satan, who says,\r\n\r\n    \'Fallen spirit, to be weak is to be miserable.\'"\r\n\r\n"You read, I see!--I did not know you were a reading girl. So was I\r\nonce; but I never read now. Books only spoil the originality of genius:\r\nvery well for those who can\'t think for themselves--but when one has\r\nmade up one\'s opinion, there is no use in reading."\r\n\r\n"But to make them up," replied Belinda, "may it not be useful?"\r\n\r\n"Of no use upon earth to minds of a certain class. You, who can think\r\nfor yourself, should never read."\r\n\r\n"But I read that I may think for myself."\r\n\r\n"Only ruin your understanding, trust me. Books are full of\r\ntrash--nonsense, conversation is worth all the books in the world."\r\n\r\n"And is there never any nonsense in conversation?"\r\n\r\n"What have you here?" continued Mrs. Freke, who did not choose to attend\r\nto this question; exclaiming, as she reviewed each of the books on the\r\ntable in their turns, in the summary language of presumptuous\r\nignorance, "Smith\'s Theory of Moral Sentiments--milk and water! Moore\'s\r\nTravels--hasty pudding! La Bruyere--nettle porridge! This is what you\r\nwere at when I came in, was it not?" said she, taking up a book[8]\r\nin which she saw Belinda\'s mark: "Against Inconsistency in our\r\nExpectations. Poor thing! who bored you with this task?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Percival recommended it to me, as one of the best essays in the\r\nEnglish language."\r\n\r\n"The devil! they seem to have put you in a course of the bitters--a\r\ncourse of the woods might do your business better. Do you ever\r\nhunt?--Let me take you out with me some morning--you\'d be quite an angel\r\non horseback; or let me drive you out some day in my unicorn."\r\n\r\nBelinda declined this invitation, and Mrs. Freke strode away to the\r\nwindow to conceal her mortification, threw up the sash, and called out\r\nto her groom, "Walk those horses about, blockhead!"\r\n\r\nMr. Percival and Mr. Vincent at this instant came into the room.\r\n\r\n"Hail, fellow! well met!" cried Mrs. Freke, stretching out her hand to\r\nMr. Vincent.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked, that an antipathy subsists between creatures,\r\nwho, without being the same, have yet a strong external resemblance. Mr.\r\nPercival saw this instinct rising in Mr. Vincent, and smiled.\r\n\r\n"Hail, fellow! well met! I say. Shake hands and be friends, man! Though\r\nI\'m not in the habit of making apologies, if it will be any satisfaction\r\nto you, I beg your pardon for frightening your poor devil of a black."\r\n\r\nThen turning towards Mr. Percival, she measured him with her eye, as a\r\nperson whom she longed to attack. She thought, that if Belinda\'s opinion\r\nof the understanding of _these Percivals_ could be lowered, she should\r\nrise in her esteem: accordingly, she determined to draw Mr. Percival\r\ninto an argument.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been talking treason, I believe, to Miss Portman," cried she; "for\r\nI\'ve been opposing some of your opinions, Mr. Percival."\r\n\r\n"If you opposed them all, madam," said Mr. Percival, "I should not think\r\nit treason."\r\n\r\n"Vastly polite!--But I think all our politeness hypocrisy: what d\'ye say\r\nto that?"\r\n\r\n"You know that best, madam!"\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll go a step farther; for I\'m determined you shall contradict\r\nme: I think all virtue is hypocrisy."\r\n\r\n"I need not contradict you, madam," said Mr. Percival, "for the terms\r\nwhich you make use of contradict themselves."\r\n\r\n"It is my system," pursued Mrs. Freke, "that shame is always the cause\r\nof the vices of women."\r\n\r\n"It is sometimes the effect," said Mr. Percival; "and, as cause and\r\neffect are reciprocal, perhaps you may, in some instances, be right."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I hate qualifying arguers--plump assertion or plump denial for me:\r\nyou sha\'n\'t get off so. I say shame is the cause of all women\'s vices."\r\n\r\n"False shame, I suppose you mean?" said Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\n"Mere play upon words! All shame is false shame--we should be a great\r\ndeal better without it. What say you, Miss Portman?--Silent, hey?\r\nSilence that speaks."\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman\'s blushes," said Mr. Vincent, "speak _for her_."\r\n\r\n"_Against_ her," said Mrs. Freke: "women blush because they understand."\r\n\r\n"And you would have them understand without blushing?" said Mr.\r\nPercival. "I grant you that nothing can be more different than innocence\r\nand ignorance. Female delicacy--"\r\n\r\n"This is just the way you men spoil women," cried Mrs. Freke, "by\r\ntalking to them of the _delicacy of their sex_, and such stuff. This\r\n_delicacy_ enslaves the pretty delicate dears."\r\n\r\n"No; it enslaves us," said Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\n"I hate slavery! Vive la liberte!" cried Mrs. Freke. "I\'m a champion for\r\nthe Rights of Woman."\r\n\r\n"I am an advocate for their happiness," said Mr. Percival, "and for\r\ntheir delicacy, as I think it conduces to their happiness."\r\n\r\n"I\'m an enemy to their delicacy, as I am sure it conduces to their\r\nmisery."\r\n\r\n"You speak from experience?" said Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\n"No, from observation. Your most delicate women are always the greatest\r\nhypocrites; and, in my opinion, no hypocrite can or ought to be happy."\r\n\r\n"But you have not proved the hypocrisy," said Belinda. "Delicacy is not,\r\nI hope, an indisputable proof of it? If you mean _false_ delicacy----"\r\n\r\n"To cut the matter short at once," cried Mrs. Freke, "why, when a woman\r\nlikes a man, does not she go and tell him so honestly?"\r\n\r\nBelinda, surprised by this question from a woman, was too much abashed\r\ninstantly to answer.\r\n\r\n"Because she\'s a hypocrite. That is and must be the answer."\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr. Percival; "because, if she be a woman of sense, she knows\r\nthat by such a step she would disgust the object of her affection."\r\n\r\n"Cunning!--cunning!--cunning!--the arms of the weakest."\r\n\r\n"Prudence! prudence!--the arms of the strongest. Taking the best means\r\nto secure our own happiness without injuring that of others is the\r\nbest proof of sense and strength of mind, whether in man or woman.\r\nFortunately for society, the same conduct in ladies which best secures\r\ntheir happiness most increases ours."\r\n\r\nMrs. Freke beat the devil\'s tattoo for some moments, and then exclaimed,\r\n"You may say what you will, but the present system of society is\r\nradically wrong:--whatever is, is wrong."\r\n\r\n"How would you improve the state of society?" asked Mr. Percival,\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not tinker-general to the world," said she.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad of it," said Mr. Percival; "for I have heard that tinkers\r\noften spoil more than they mend."\r\n\r\n"But if you want to know," said Mrs. Freke, "what I would do to improve\r\nthe world, I\'ll tell you: I\'d have both sexes call things by their right\r\nnames."\r\n\r\n"This would doubtless be a great improvement," said Mr. Percival; "but\r\nyou would not overturn society to attain it, would you? Should we find\r\nthings much improved by tearing away what has been called the decent\r\ndrapery of life?"\r\n\r\n"Drapery, if you ask me my opinion," cried Mrs. Freke, "drapery, whether\r\nwet or dry, is the most confoundedly indecent thing in the world."\r\n\r\n"That depends on _public_ opinion, I allow," said Mr. Percival. "The\r\nLacedaemonian ladies, who were veiled only by public opinion, were\r\nbetter covered from profane eyes than some English ladies are in wet\r\ndrapery."\r\n\r\n"I know nothing of the Lacedaemonian ladies: I took my leave of them\r\nwhen I was a schoolboy--girl, I should say. But pray, what o\'clock is it\r\nby you? I\'ve sat till I\'m cramped all over," cried Mrs. Freke, getting\r\nup and stretching herself so violently that some part of her habiliments\r\ngave way. "Honi soit qui mal y pense!" said she, bursting into a horse\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nWithout sharing in any degree that confusion which Belinda felt for her,\r\nshe strode out of the room, saying, "Miss Portman, you understand these\r\nthings better than I do; come and set me to rights."\r\n\r\nWhen she was in Belinda\'s room, she threw herself into an arm-chair, and\r\nlaughed immoderately.\r\n\r\n"How I have trimmed Percival this morning!" said she.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you think so," said Belinda; "for I really was afraid he had\r\nbeen too severe upon you."\r\n\r\n"I only wish," continued Mrs. Freke, "I only wish his wife had been by.\r\nWhy the devil did not she make her appearance? I suppose the prude was\r\nafraid of my demolishing and unrigging her."\r\n\r\n"There seems to have been more danger of that for you than for any body\r\nelse," said Belinda, as she assisted to set Mrs. Freke\'s rigging, as she\r\ncalled it, to rights.\r\n\r\n"I do of all things delight in hauling good people\'s opinions out of\r\ntheir musty drawers, and seeing how they look when they\'re all pulled\r\nto pieces before their faces! Pray, are those Lady Anne\'s drawers or\r\nyours?" said Mrs. Freke, pointing to a chest of drawers.\r\n\r\n"Mine."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry for it; for if they were hers, to punish her for _shirking_\r\nme, by the Lord, I\'d have every rag she has in the world out in the\r\nmiddle of the floor in ten minutes! You don\'t know me--I\'m a terrible\r\nperson when provoked--stop at nothing!"\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Freke saw no other chance left of gaining her point with\r\nBelinda, she tried what intimidating her would do.\r\n\r\n"I stop at nothing," repeated she, fixing her eyes upon Miss Portman, to\r\nfascinate her by terror. "Friend or foe! peace or war! Take your choice.\r\nCome to the ball at Harrowgate, I win my bet, and I\'m your sworn friend.\r\nStay away, I lose my bet, and am your sworn enemy."\r\n\r\n"It is not in my power, madam," said Belinda, calmly, "to comply with\r\nyour request."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll take the consequences," cried Mrs. Freke. She rushed past\r\nher, hurried down stairs, and called out, "Bid my blockhead bring my\r\nunicorn."\r\n\r\nShe, her unicorn, and her blockhead, were out of sight in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nGood may be drawn from evil. Mrs. Freke\'s conversation, though at the\r\ntime it confounded Belinda, roused her, upon reflection, to examine by\r\nher reason the habits and principles which guided her conduct. She had\r\na general feeling that they were right and necessary; but now, with the\r\nassistance of Lady Anne and Mr. Percival, she established in her own\r\nunderstanding the exact boundaries between right and wrong upon many\r\nsubjects. She felt a species of satisfaction and security, from\r\nseeing the demonstration of those axioms of morality, in which she had\r\npreviously acquiesced. Reasoning gradually became as agreeable to her as\r\nwit; nor was her taste for wit diminished, it was only refined by this\r\nprocess. She now compared and judged of the value of the different\r\nspecies of this brilliant talent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Freke\'s wit, thought she, is like a noisy squib, the momentary\r\nterror of passengers; Lady Delacour\'s like an elegant firework, which\r\nwe crowd to see, and cannot forbear to applaud; but Lady Anne Percival\'s\r\nwit is like the refulgent moon, we\r\n\r\n    "Love the mild rays, and bless the useful light."\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman," said Mr. Percival, "are not you afraid of making an\r\nenemy of Mrs. Freke, by declining her invitation to Harrowgate?"\r\n\r\n"I think her friendship more to be dreaded than her enmity," replied\r\nBelinda.\r\n\r\n"Then you are not to be terrified by an obeah-woman?" said Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\n"Not in the least, unless she were to come in the shape of a false\r\nfriend," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Till lately," said Mr. Vincent, "I was deceived in the character of\r\nMrs. Freke. I thought her a dashing, free-spoken, free-hearted sort of\r\neccentric person, who would make a staunch friend and a jolly companion.\r\nAs a mistress, or a wife, no man of any taste could think of her.\r\nCompare that woman now with one of our Creole ladies."\r\n\r\n"But why with a creole?" said Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\n"For the sake of contrast, in the first place: our creole women are all\r\nsoftness, grace, delicacy----"\r\n\r\n"And indolence," said Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\n"Their indolence is but a slight, and, in my judgment, an amiable\r\ndefect; it keeps them out of mischief, and it attaches them to domestic\r\nlife. The activity of a Mrs. Freke would never excite their emulation;\r\nand so much the better."\r\n\r\n"So much the better, no doubt," said Mr. Percival. "But is there\r\nno other species of activity that might excite their ambition with\r\npropriety? Without diminishing their grace, softness, or delicacy,\r\nmight not they cultivate their minds? Do you think ignorance, as well as\r\nindolence, an amiable defect, essential to the female character?"\r\n\r\n"Not essential. You do not, I hope, imagine that I am so much prejudiced\r\nin favour of my countrywomen, that I can neither see nor feel the\r\nsuperiority in _some instances_ of European cultivation? I speak only in\r\ngeneral."\r\n\r\n"And in general," said Lady Anne Percival, "does Mr. Vincent wish to\r\nconfine our sex to the bliss of ignorance?"\r\n\r\n"If it be bliss," said Mr. Vincent, "what reason would they have for\r\ncomplaint?"\r\n\r\n"_If_," said Belinda; "but that is a question which you have not yet\r\ndecided."\r\n\r\n"And how can we decide it?" said Mr. Vincent, "The taste and feelings of\r\nindividuals must be the arbiters of their happiness."\r\n\r\n"You leave reason quite out of the question, then," said Mr. Percival,\r\n"and refer the whole to taste and feeling? So that if the most ignorant\r\nperson in the world assert that he is happier than you are, you are\r\nbound to believe him."\r\n\r\n"Why should not I?" said Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\n"Because," said Mr. Percival, "though he can judge of his own pleasures,\r\nhe cannot judge of yours; his are common to both, but yours are unknown\r\nto him. Would you, at this instant, change places with that ploughman\r\nyonder, who is whistling as he goes for want of thought? or, would you\r\nchoose to go a step higher in the bliss of ignorance, and turn savage?"\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent laughed, and protested that he should be very unwilling to\r\ngive up his title to civilized society; and that, instead of wishing to\r\nhave less knowledge, he regretted that he had not more. "I am sensible,"\r\nsaid he, "that I have many prejudices;--Miss Portman has made me ashamed\r\nof some of them."\r\n\r\nThere was a degree of candour in Mr. Vincent\'s manner and conversation,\r\nwhich interested every body in his favour; Belinda amongst the rest. She\r\nwas perfectly at ease in Mr. Vincent\'s company, because she considered\r\nhim as a person who wished for her friendship, without having any design\r\nto engage her affections. From several hints that dropped from him, from\r\nMr. Percival, and from Lady Anne, she was persuaded that he was attached\r\nto some creole lady; and all that he said in favour of the elegant\r\nsoftness and delicacy of his countrywomen confirmed this opinion.\r\n\r\nMiss Portman was not one of those young ladies who fancy that every\r\ngentleman who converses freely with them will inevitably fall a victim\r\nto the power of their charms, and will see in every man a lover, or\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nA DECLARATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'ve found it!--I\'ve found it, mamma!" cried little Charles Percival,\r\nrunning eagerly into the room with a plant in his hand. "Will you send\r\nthis in your letter to Helena Delacour, and tell her that is the thing\r\nthat gold fishes are so fond of? And tell her that it is called lemna,\r\nand that it may be found in any ditch or pool."\r\n\r\n"But how can she find ditches and pools in Grosvenor-square, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I forgot that. Then will you tell her, mamma, that I will send her\r\na great quantity?"\r\n\r\n"How, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, mamma, yet--but I will find out some way."\r\n\r\n"Would it not be as well, my dear," said his mother, smiling, "to\r\nconsider how you can perform your promises before you make them?"\r\n\r\n"A gentleman," said Mr. Vincent, "never makes a promise that he cannot\r\nperform."\r\n\r\n"I know that very well," said the boy, proudly: "Miss Portman, who is\r\nvery good-natured, will, I am sure, be so good, when she goes back to\r\nLady Delacour, as to carry food for the gold fishes to Helena--you see\r\nthat I have found out a way to keep my promise."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m afraid not," said Belinda; "for I am not going back to Lady\r\nDelacour\'s."\r\n\r\n"Then I am very glad of it!" said the boy, dropping the weed, and\r\nclapping his hands joyfully; "for then I hope you will always stay here,\r\ndon\'t you, mamma?--don\'t _you_, Mr. Vincent? Oh, _you_ do, I am sure,\r\nfor I heard you say so to papa the other day! But what makes you grow so\r\nred?"\r\n\r\nHis mother took him by the hand, as he was going to repeat the question,\r\nand leading him out of the room, desired him to show her the place where\r\nhe found the food for the gold fishes.\r\n\r\nBelinda, to Mr. Vincent\'s great relief, seemed not to take any notice of\r\nthe child\'s question, nor to have any sympathy in his curiosity; she was\r\nintently copying Westall\'s sketch of Lady Anne Percival and her family,\r\nand she had been roused, by the first mention of Helena Delacour\'s name,\r\nto many painful and some pleasing recollections. "What a charming woman,\r\nand what a charming family!" said Mr. Vincent, as he looked at the\r\ndrawing; "and how much more interesting is this picture of domestic\r\nhappiness than all the pictures of shepherds and shepherdesses, and gods\r\nand goddesses, that ever were drawn!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Belinda, "and how much more interesting this picture is to\r\nus, from our knowing that it is not a fancy-piece; that the happiness is\r\nreal, not imaginary: that this is the natural expression of affection in\r\nthe countenance of the mother; and that these children, who crowd round\r\nher, are what they seem to be--the pride and pleasure of her life!"\r\n\r\n"There cannot," exclaimed Mr. Vincent, with enthusiasm, "be a more\r\ndelightful picture! Oh, Miss Portman, is it possible that you should not\r\nfeel what you can paint so well?"\r\n\r\n"Is it possible, sir," said Belinda, "that you should suspect me of\r\nsuch wretched hypocrisy, as to affect to admire what I am incapable of\r\nfeeling?"\r\n\r\n"You misunderstand--you totally misunderstand me. Hypocrisy! No;\r\nthere is not a woman upon earth whom I believe to be so far above all\r\nhypocrisy, all affectation. But I imagined--I feared--"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke these last words he was in some confusion, and hastily\r\nturned over the prints in a portfolio which lay upon the table.\r\nBelinda\'s eye was caught by an engraving of Lady Delacour in the\r\ncharacter of the comic muse. Mr. Vincent did not know the intimacy that\r\nhad subsisted between her ladyship and Miss Portman--she sighed from\r\nthe recollection of Clarence Hervey, and of all that had passed at the\r\nmasquerade.\r\n\r\n"What a contrast!" said Mr. Vincent, placing the print of Lady Delacour\r\nbeside the picture of Lady Anne Percival. "What a contrast! Compare\r\ntheir pictures--compare their characters--compare--"\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," interrupted Belinda; "Lady Delacour was once my friend, and\r\nI do not like to make a comparison so much to her disadvantage. I have\r\nnever seen any woman who would not suffer by a comparison with Lady Anne\r\nPercival."\r\n\r\n"I have been more fortunate, I _have_ seen one--one equally worthy of\r\nesteem--admiration--love."\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent\'s voice faltered in pronouncing the word love; yet Belinda,\r\nprepossessed by the idea that he was attached to some creole lady,\r\nsimply answered, without looking up from her drawing, "You are indeed\r\nvery fortunate--peculiarly fortunate. Are the West-Indian ladies----"\r\n\r\n"West-Indian ladies!" interrupted Mr. Vincent. "Surely, Miss Portman\r\ncannot imagine that I am at this instant thinking of any West-Indian\r\nlady!" Belinda looked up with an air of surprise. "Charming Miss\r\nPortman," continued he, "I have learnt to admire _European beauty,\r\nEuropean excellence_! I have acquired new ideas of the female\r\ncharacter--ideas--feelings that must henceforward render me exquisitely\r\nhappy or exquisitely miserable."\r\n\r\nMiss Portman had been too often called "_charming_" to be much startled\r\nor delighted by the sound: the word would have passed by unnoticed, but\r\nthere was something so impassioned in Mr. Vincent\'s manner, that she\r\ncould no longer mistake it for common gallantry, and she was in evident\r\nconfusion. Now for the first time the idea of Mr. Vincent as a lover\r\ncame into her mind: the next instant she accused herself of vanity, and\r\ndreaded that he should read her thoughts. "Exquisitely miserable!" said\r\nshe, in a tone of raillery: "I should not suppose, from what I have seen\r\nof Mr. Vincent, that any thing could make him exquisitely miserable."\r\n\r\n"Then you do not know my character--you do not know my heart: it is in\r\n_your_ power to make me exquisitely miserable. Mine is not the cold,\r\nhackneyed phrase of gallantry, but the fervid language of passion,"\r\ncried he, seizing her hand.\r\n\r\nAt this instant one of the children came in with some flowers to\r\nBelinda; and, glad of the interruption, she hastily put up her drawings\r\nand left the room, observing that she should scarcely have time to dress\r\nbefore dinner. However, as soon as she found herself alone, she forgot\r\nhow late it was; and though she sat down before the glass to dress,\r\nshe made no progress in the business, but continued for some time\r\nmotionless, endeavouring to recollect and to understand all that had\r\npassed. The result of her reflections was the conviction that her\r\npartiality for Clarence Hervey was greater than she ever had till this\r\nmoment suspected. "I have told my aunt Stanhope," thought she, "that the\r\nidea of Mr. Hervey had no influence in my refusal of Sir Philip Baddely;\r\nI have said that my affections are entirely at my own command: then why\r\ndo I feel this alarm at the discovery of Mr. Vincent\'s views? Why do I\r\ncompare him with one whom I thought I had forgotten?--And yet how are we\r\nto judge of character? How can we form any estimate of what is amiable,\r\nof what will make us happy or miserable, but by comparison? Am I to\r\nblame for perceiving superiority? Am I to blame if one person be more\r\nagreeable, or seem to be more agreeable, than another? Am I to blame if\r\nI cannot love Mr. Vincent?"\r\n\r\nBefore Belinda had answered these questions to her satisfaction, the\r\ndinner-bell rang. There happened to dine this day at Mr. Percival\'s a\r\ngentleman who had just arrived from Lisbon, and the conversation turned\r\nupon the sailors\' practice of stilling the waves over the bar of Lisbon\r\nby throwing oil upon the water. Charles Percival\'s curiosity was excited\r\nby this conversation, and he wished to see the experiment. In the\r\nevening his father indulged his wishes. The children were delighted at\r\nthe sight, and little Charles insisted upon Belinda\'s following him to\r\na particular spot, where he was well convinced that she could see better\r\nthan any where else in the world. "Take care," cried Lady Anne, "or you\r\nwill lead your friend into the river, Charles." The boy paused, and\r\nsoon afterwards asked his father several questions about swimming and\r\ndrowning, and bringing people to life after they had been drowned.\r\n"Don\'t you remember, papa," said he, "_that_ Mr. Hervey, who was almost\r\ndrowned in the Serpentine river in London?"--Belinda coloured at hearing\r\nunexpectedly the name of the person of whom she was at that instant\r\nthinking, and the child continued--"I liked that Mr. Hervey very much--I\r\nliked him from the first day I saw him. What a number of entertaining\r\nthings he told us at dinner! We used to call him the good-natured\r\ngentleman: I like him very much--I wish he was here this minute. Did you\r\never see him, Miss Portman? Oh, yes, you must have seen him; for it was\r\nhe who carried Helena\'s gold fishes to her mother, and he used often to\r\nbe at Lady Delacour\'s--was not he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, often."\r\n\r\n"And did not you like him very much?"--This simple question threw\r\nBelinda into inexpressible confusion: but fortunately the crimson on\r\nher face was seen only by Lady Anne Percival. To Belinda\'s great\r\nsatisfaction, Mr. Vincent forbore this evening any attempt to renew\r\nthe conversation of the morning; he endeavoured to mix, with his usual\r\nanimation and gaiety, in the family society; and her embarrassment was\r\nmuch lessened when she heard the next day, at breakfast, that he was\r\ngone to Harrowgate. Lady Anne Percival took notice that she was this\r\nmorning unusually sprightly.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, as they were passing through the hall to take a walk in\r\nthe park, one of the little boys stopped to look at a musical instrument\r\nwhich hung up against the wall.\r\n\r\n"What is this, mamma?--It is not a guitar, is it?"\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, it is called a banjore; it is an African instrument, of\r\nwhich the negroes are particularly fond. Mr. Vincent mentioned it the\r\nother day to Miss Portman, and I believe she expressed some curiosity to\r\nsee one. Juba went to work immediately to make a banjore, I find. Poor\r\nfellow! I dare say that he was very sorry to go to Harrowgate, and to\r\nleave his African guitar half finished; especially as it was intended\r\nfor an offering to Miss Portman. He is the most grateful, affectionate\r\ncreature I ever saw."\r\n\r\n"But why, mamma," said Charles Percival, "is Mr. Vincent gone away? I\r\nam sorry he is gone; I hope he will soon come back. In the mean time, I\r\nmust run and water my carnations."\r\n\r\n"His sorrow for his friend Mr. Vincent\'s departure does not seem to\r\naffect his spirits much," said Lady Anne. "People who expect sentiment\r\nfrom children of six years old will be disappointed, and will probably\r\nteach them affectation. Surely it is much better to let their natural\r\naffections have time to expand. If we tear the rosebud open we spoil the\r\nflower." Belinda smiled at this parable of the rosebud, which, she said,\r\nmight be applied to men and women, as well as to children.\r\n\r\n"And yet, upon reflection," said Lady Anne, "the heart has nothing in\r\ncommon with a rosebud. Nonsensical allusions pass off very prettily\r\nin conversation. I mean, when we converse with partial friends: but\r\nwe should reason ill, and conduct ourselves worse, if we were to trust\r\nimplicitly to poetical analogies. Our affections," continued Lady Anne,\r\n"arise from circumstances totally independent of our will."\r\n\r\n"That is the very thing I meant to say," interrupted Belinda, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"They are excited by the agreeable or useful qualities that we discover\r\nin things or in persons."\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Or by those which our fancies discover," said Lady Anne.\r\n\r\nBelinda was silent; but, after a pause, she said, "That it was certainly\r\nvery dangerous, especially for women, to trust to fancy in bestowing\r\ntheir affections." "And yet," said Lady Anne, "it is a danger to which\r\nthey are much exposed in society. Men have it in their power to assume\r\nthe appearance of every thing that is amiable and estimable, and women\r\nhave scarcely any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit."\r\n\r\n"Without Ithuriel\'s spear, how can they distinguish the good from the\r\nevil?" said Belinda. "This is a common-place complaint, I know; the\r\nready excuse that we silly young women plead, when we make mistakes\r\nfor which our friends reproach us, and for which we too often reproach\r\nourselves."\r\n\r\n"The complaint is common-place precisely because it is general and\r\njust," replied Lady Anne. "In the slight and frivolous intercourse,\r\nwhich fashionable belles usually have with those fashionable beaux who\r\ncall themselves their lovers, it is surprising that they can discover\r\nany thing of each other\'s real character. Indeed they seldom do; and\r\nthis probably is the cause why there are so many unsuitable and unhappy\r\nmarriages. A woman who has an opportunity of seeing her lover in private\r\nsociety, in domestic life, has infinite advantages; for if she has any\r\nsense, and he has any sincerity, the real character of both may perhaps\r\nbe developed."\r\n\r\n"True," said Belinda (who now suspected that Lady Anne alluded to Mr.\r\nVincent); "and in such a situation a woman would readily be able to\r\ndecide whether the man who addressed her would suit her taste or not;\r\nso she would be inexcusable if, either from vanity or coquetry, she\r\ndisguised her real sentiments."\r\n\r\n"And will Miss Portman, who cannot, by any one to whom she is known,\r\nbe suspected of vanity or coquetry, permit me to speak to her with the\r\nfreedom of a friend?"\r\n\r\nBelinda, touched by the kindness of Lady Anne\'s manner, pressed her\r\nhand, and exclaimed, "Yes, dear Lady Anne, speak to me with freedom--you\r\ncannot do me a greater favour. No thought of my mind, no secret feeling\r\nof my heart, shall be concealed from you."\r\n\r\n"Do not imagine that I wish to encroach upon the generous openness of\r\nyour temper," said Lady Anne; "tell me when I go too far, and I will be\r\nsilent. One who, like Miss Portman, has lived in the world, has seen a\r\nvariety of characters, and probably has had a variety of admirers, must\r\nhave formed some determinate idea of the sort of companion that would\r\nmake her happy, if she were to marry--unless," said Lady Anne, "she has\r\nformed a resolution against marriage."\r\n\r\n"I have formed no such resolution," said Belinda. "Indeed, since I have\r\nseen the happiness which you and Mr. Percival enjoy in your own family,\r\nI have been much more disposed to think that a union--that a union such\r\nas yours, would increase my happiness. At the same time, my aversion to\r\nthe idea of marrying from interest, or convenience, or from any motives\r\nbut esteem and love, is increased almost to horror. O Lady Anne! there\r\nis nothing that I would not do to please the friends to whom I am under\r\nobligations, except sacrificing my peace of mind, or my integrity, the\r\nhappiness of my life, by--"\r\n\r\nLady Anne, in a gentle tone, assured her, that she was the last person\r\nin the world who would press her to any union which would make her\r\nunhappy. "You perceive that Mr. Vincent has spoken to me of what passed\r\nbetween you yesterday. You perceive that I am his friend, but do not\r\nforget that I am also yours. If you fear _undue influence_ from any of\r\nyour relations in favour of Mr. Vincent\'s large fortune, &c. let his\r\nproposal remain a secret between ourselves, till you can decide, from\r\nfarther acquaintance with him, whether it will be in your power to\r\nreturn his affection."\r\n\r\n"I fear, my dear Lady Anne," cried Belinda, "that it is not in my power\r\nto return his affection."\r\n\r\n"And may I ask your objections?"\r\n\r\n"Is it not a sufficient objection, that I am persuaded I cannot love\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"No; for you may be mistaken in that persuasion. Remember what we said\r\na little while ago, about _fancy and spontaneous affections_. Does Mr.\r\nVincent appear to you defective in any of the qualities which you think\r\nessential to happiness? Mr. Percival has known him from the time he was\r\na man, and can answer for his integrity and his good temper. Are not\r\nthese the first points you would consider? They ought to be, I am\r\nsure, and I believe they are. Of his understanding I shall say nothing,\r\nbecause you have had full opportunities of judging of it from his\r\nconversation."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent appears to have a good understanding," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Then to what do you object?--Is there any thing disgusting to you in\r\nhis person or manners?"\r\n\r\n"He is very handsome, he is well bred, and his manners are unaffected,"\r\nsaid Belinda; "but--do not accuse me of caprice--altogether he does not\r\nsuit my taste; and I cannot think it sufficient not to feel disgust for\r\na husband--though I believe this is the fashionable doctrine."\r\n\r\n"It is not mine, I assure you," said Lady Anne. "I am not one of those\r\nwho think it \'safest to begin with a little aversion;\' but since you\r\nacknowledge that Mr. Vincent possesses the essential good qualities\r\nthat entitle him to your esteem, I am satisfied. We gradually acquire\r\nknowledge of the good qualities of those who endeavour to please us;\r\nand if they are really amiable, their persons become agreeable to us by\r\ndegrees, when we become accustomed to them."\r\n\r\n"Accustomed!" said Belinda, smiling: "one does grow accustomed even to\r\ndisagreeable things certainly; but at this rate, my dear Lady Anne, I do\r\nnot doubt but one might grow _accustomed_ to Caliban."\r\n\r\n"My belief in the reconciling power of custom does not go quite so far,"\r\nsaid Lady Anne. "It does not extend to Caliban, or even to the hero of\r\nLa Belle et La Bete; but I do believe, that, in a mind so well regulated\r\nas yours, esteem may certainly in time be improved into love. I will\r\ntell Mr. Vincent so, my dear."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear Lady Anne! no; you must not--indeed you must not. You have\r\ntoo good an opinion of me--my mind is not so well regulated--I am much\r\nweaker, much sillier, than you imagine--than you can conceive," said\r\nBelinda.\r\n\r\nLady Anne soothed her with the most affectionate expressions, and\r\nconcluded with saying, "Mr. Vincent has promised not to return from\r\nHarrowgate, to torment you with his addresses, if you be absolutely\r\ndetermined against him. He is of too generous, and perhaps too proud\r\na temper, to persecute you with vain solicitations; and however Mr.\r\nPercival and I may wish that he could obtain such a wife, we shall have\r\nthe common, or uncommon, sense and good-nature to allow our friends to\r\nbe happy their own way."\r\n\r\n"You are very good--too good. But am I then to be the cause of banishing\r\nMr. Vincent from all his friends--from Oakly-park?"\r\n\r\n"Will he not do what is most prudent, to avoid the charming Miss\r\nPortman," said Lady Anne, smiling, "if he must not love her? This was at\r\nleast the advice I gave him, when he consulted us yesterday evening.\r\nBut I will not sign his writ of banishment lightly. Nothing but the\r\nassurance that the heart is engaged can be a sufficient cause for\r\ndespair; nothing else could, in my eyes, justify you, my dear Belinda,\r\nfrom the charge of caprice."\r\n\r\n"I can give you no such assurance, I hope--I believe," said Belinda,\r\nin great confusion; "and yet I would not for the world deceive you: you\r\nhave a right to my sincerity." She paused; and Lady Anne said with a\r\nsmile, "Perhaps I can spare you the trouble of telling me in words what\r\na blush told me, or at least made me suspect, yesterday evening, when we\r\nwere standing by the river side, when little Charles asked you--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I remember--I saw you look at me."\r\n\r\n"Undesignedly, believe me."\r\n\r\n"Undesignedly, I am sure; but I was afraid you would think--"\r\n\r\n"The truth."\r\n\r\n"No; but more than the truth. The truth you shall hear; and the rest I\r\nwill leave to your judgment and to your kindness."\r\n\r\nBelinda gave a full account of her acquaintance with Clarence Hervey; of\r\nthe variations in his manner towards her; of his excellent conduct with\r\nrespect to Lady Delacour (of this, by-the-by, she spoke at large). But\r\nshe was more concise when she touched upon the state of her own heart;\r\nand her voice almost failed when she came to the history of the lock of\r\nbeautiful hair, the Windsor incognita, and the picture of Virginia. She\r\nconcluded by expressing her conviction of the propriety of forgetting a\r\nman, who was in all probability attached to another, and she declared\r\nit to be her resolution to banish him from her thoughts. Lady Anne said,\r\n"that nothing could be more prudent or praiseworthy than forming such\r\na resolution--except keeping it." Lady Anne had a high opinion of Mr.\r\nHervey; but she had no doubt, from Belinda\'s account, and from her own\r\nobservations on Mr. Hervey, and from slight circumstances which had\r\naccidentally come to Mr. Percival\'s knowledge, that he was, as Belinda\r\nsuspected, attached to another person. She wished, therefore, to confirm\r\nMiss Portman in this belief, and to turn her thoughts towards one who,\r\nbeside being deserving of her esteem and love, felt for her the most\r\nsincere affection. She did not, however, press the subject farther at\r\nthis time, but contented herself with requesting that Belinda would take\r\nthree days (the usual time given for deliberation in fairy tales) before\r\nshe should decide against Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\nThe next day they went to look at a porter\'s lodge, which Mr. Percival\r\nhad just built; it was inhabited by an old man and woman, who had for\r\nmany years been industrious tenants, but who, in their old age, had been\r\nreduced to poverty, not by imprudence, but by misfortune. Lady Anne was\r\npleased to see them comfortably settled in their new habitation;\r\nand whilst she and Belinda were talking to the old couple, their\r\ngrand-daughter, a pretty looking girl of about eighteen, came in with\r\na basket of eggs in her hand. "Well, Lucy," said Lady Anne, "have you\r\novercome your dislike to James Jackson?" The girl reddened, smiled, and\r\nlooked at her grand-mother, who answered for her in an arch tone, "Oh,\r\nyes, my lady! We are not afraid of Jackson _now_; we are grown very\r\ngreat friends. This pretty cane chair for my good man was his handiwork,\r\nand these baskets he made for me. Indeed, he\'s a most industrious,\r\ningenious, good-natured youth; and our Lucy takes no offence at his\r\ncourting her now, my lady, I can assure you. That necklace, which is\r\nnever off her neck now, he turned for her, my lady; it is a present of\r\nhis. So I tell him he need not be discouraged, though so be she did not\r\ntake to him at the first; for she\'s a good girl, and a sensible girl--I\r\nsay it, though she\'s my own; and the eyes are used to a face after a\r\ntime, and then it\'s nothing. They say, fancy\'s all in all in love: now\r\nin my judgment, fancy\'s little or nothing with girls that have sense.\r\nBut I beg pardon for prating at this rate, more especially when I am so\r\nold as to have forgot all the little I ever knew about such things."\r\n\r\n"But you have the best right in the world to speak about such things,\r\nand your grand-daughter has the best reason in the world to listen to\r\nyou," said Lady Anne, "because, in spite of all the crosses of fortune,\r\nyou have been an excellent and happy wife, at least ever since I can\r\nremember."\r\n\r\n"And ever since I can remember, that\'s more; no offence to your\r\nladyship," said the old man, striking his crutch against the ground.\r\n"Ever since I can remember, she has made me the happiest man in the\r\nwhole world, in the whole parish, as every body knows, and I best of\r\nall!" cried he, with a degree of enthusiasm that lighted up his aged\r\ncountenance, and animated his feeble voice.\r\n\r\n"And yet," said the honest dame, "if I had followed my fancy, and taken\r\nup with my first love, it would not ha\' been with _he_, Lucy. I had a\r\nsort of a fancy (since my lady\'s so good as to let me speak), I had a\r\nsort of a fancy for an idle young man; but he, very luckily for me, took\r\nit into his head to fall in love with another young woman, and then I\r\nhad leisure enough left me to think of your grandfather, who was not so\r\nmuch to my taste like at first. But when I found out his goodness and\r\ncleverness, and joined to all, his great tenderness for me, I thought\r\nbetter of it, Lucy (as who knows but you may do, though there shall\r\nnot be a word said on my part to press you, for poor Jackson?); and my\r\nthinking better is the cause why I have been so happy ever since, and am\r\nso still in my old age. Ah, Lucy! dear, what a many years that same old\r\nage lasts, after all! But young folks, for the most part, never think\r\nwhat\'s to come after thirty or forty at farthest. But I don\'t say this\r\nfor you, Lucy; for you are a good girl, and a sensible girl, though my\r\nown grand-daughter, as I said before, and therefore won\'t be run away\r\nwith by fancy, which is soon past and gone: but make a prudent choice,\r\nthat you won\'t never have cause to repent of. But I\'ll not say a word\r\nmore; I\'ll leave it all to yourself and James Jackson."\r\n\r\n"You do right," said Lady Anne: "good morning to you! Farewell, Lucy!\r\nThat\'s a pretty necklace, and is very becoming to you--fare ye well!"\r\n\r\nShe hurried out of the cottage with Belinda, apprehensive that the\r\ntalkative old dame might weaken the effect of her good sense and\r\nexperience by a farther profusion of words.\r\n\r\n"One would think," said Belinda, with an ingenuous smile, "that this\r\nlesson upon the dangers of _fancy_ was intended for me: at any rate, I\r\nmay turn it to my own advantage!"\r\n\r\n"Happy those who can turn all the experience of others to their own\r\nadvantage!" said Lady Anne: "this would be a more valuable privilege\r\nthan the power of turning every thing that is touched to gold."\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence for a few minutes; and then Miss Portman,\r\npursuing the train of her own thoughts, and unconscious that she had\r\nnot explained them to Lady Anne, abruptly exclaimed, "But if I should be\r\nentangled, so as not to be able to retract!--and if it should not be\r\nin my power to love him at last, he will think me a coquette, a jilt,\r\nperhaps: he will have reason to complain of me, if I waste his time, and\r\ntrifle with his affections. Then is it not better that I should avoid,\r\nby a decided refusal, all possibility of injury to Mr. Vincent, and of\r\nblame to myself?"\r\n\r\n"There is no danger of Mr. Vincent\'s misunderstanding or misrepresenting\r\nyou. The risk that he runs is by his voluntary choice; and I am sure\r\nthat if, after farther acquaintance with him, you find it impossible to\r\nreturn his affection, he will not consider himself as ill-used by your\r\nrefusal."\r\n\r\n"But after a certain time--after the world suspects that two people are\r\nengaged to each other, it is scarcely possible for the woman to recede:\r\nwhen they come within a certain distance, they are pressed to unite, by\r\nthe irresistible force of external circumstances. A woman is too often\r\nreduced to this dilemma: either she must marry a man she does not love,\r\nor she must be blamed by the world--either she must sacrifice a portion\r\nof her reputation, or the whole of her happiness."\r\n\r\n"The world is indeed often too curious, and too rash in these affairs,"\r\nsaid Lady Anne. "A young woman is not in this respect allowed sufficient\r\ntime for freedom of deliberation. She sees, as Mr. Percival once said,\r\n\'the drawn sword of tyrant custom suspended over her head by a single\r\nhair.\'"\r\n\r\n"And yet, notwithstanding you are so well aware of the danger, your\r\nladyship would expose me to it?" said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Yes; for I think the chance of happiness, in this instance,\r\noverbalances the risk," said Lady Anne. "As we cannot alter the common\r\nlaw of custom, and as we cannot render the world less gossiping, or less\r\ncensorious, we must not expect always to avoid censure; all we can do\r\nis, never to deserve it--and it would be absurd to enslave ourselves to\r\nthe opinion of the idle and ignorant. To a certain point, respect for\r\nthe opinion of the world is prudence; beyond that point, it is weakness.\r\nYou should also consider that the _world_ at Oakly-park and in London\r\nare two different worlds. In London if you and Mr. Vincent were seen\r\noften in each other\'s company, it would be immediately buzzed about that\r\nMiss Portman and Mr. Vincent were going to be married; and if the match\r\ndid not take place, a thousand foolish stories might be told to account\r\nfor its being broken off. But here you are not surrounded by busy eyes\r\nand busy tongues. The butchers, bakers, ploughmen, and spinsters, who\r\ncompose our world, have all affairs of their own to mind. Besides, their\r\ncomments can have no very extensive circulation; they are used to see\r\nMr. Vincent continually here; and his staying with us the remainder of\r\nthe autumn will not appear to them any thing wonderful or portentous."\r\n\r\nTheir conversation was interrupted. Mr. Vincent returned to\r\nOakly-park--but upon the express condition that he should not make his\r\nattachment public by any particular attentions, and that he should draw\r\nno conclusions in his favour from Belinda\'s consenting to converse with\r\nhim freely upon every common subject. To this treaty of amity Lady Anne\r\nPercival was guarantee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nA WEDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelinda and Mr. Vincent could never agree in their definition of\r\nthe-word _flattery_; so that there were continual complaints on the one\r\nhand of a breach of treaty, and, on the other, solemn protestations of\r\nthe most scrupulous adherence to his compact. However this might be,\r\nit is certain that the gentleman gained so much, either by truth or\r\nfiction, that, in the course of some weeks, he got the lady as far as\r\n"gratitude and esteem."\r\n\r\nOne evening, Belinda was playing with little Charles Percival at\r\nspillikins. Mr. Vincent, who found pleasure in every thing that amused\r\nBelinda, and Mr. Percival, who took an interest in every thing which\r\nentertained his children, were looking on at this simple game.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Percival," said Belinda, "condescending to look at a game of\r\njack-straws!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lady Anne; "for he is of Dryden\'s opinion, that, if a straw\r\ncan be made the instrument of happiness, he is a wise man who does not\r\ndespise it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Miss Portman, take care!" cried Charles, who was anxious that she\r\nshould win, though he was playing against her. "Take care! don\'t touch\r\nthat knave."\r\n\r\n"I would lay a hundred guineas upon the steadiness of Miss Portman\'s\r\nhand," cried Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll lay you sixpence, though," cried Charles, eagerly, "that she\'ll\r\nstir the king, if she touches that knave--I\'ll lay you a shilling."\r\n\r\n"Done! done!" cried Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\n"Done! done!" cried the boy, stretching out his hand, but his father\r\ncaught it.\r\n\r\n"Softly! softly, Charles!--No betting, if you please, my dear. Done and\r\ndone sometimes ends in--undone."\r\n\r\n"It was my fault--it was I who was in the wrong," cried Vincent\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you are in the right, now," said Mr. Percival; "and, what\r\nis better than my saying so, Miss Portman thinks so, as her smile tells\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You moved, Miss Portman!" cried Charles:--"Oh, indeed! the king\'s head\r\nstirred, the very instant papa spoke. I knew it was impossible that you\r\ncould get that knave clear off without shaking the king. Now, papa, only\r\nlook how they were balanced."\r\n\r\n"I grant you," said Mr. Vincent, "I should have made an imprudent bet.\r\nSo it is well I made none; for now I see the chances were ten to one,\r\ntwenty to one, a hundred to one against me."\r\n\r\n"It does not appear to me to be a matter of chance," said Mr. Percival.\r\n"This is a game of address, not chance, and that is the reason I like\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa! Oh, Miss Portman! look how nicely these are balanced. There!\r\nmy breath has set them in motion. Look, they shake, shake, shake, like\r\nthe great rocking-stones at Brimham Crags."\r\n\r\n"That is comparing small things to great, indeed!" said Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\n"By-the-by," cried Mr. Vincent, "Miss Portman has never seen those\r\nwonderful rocking-stones--suppose we were to ride to see them\r\nto-morrow?"\r\n\r\nThe proposal was warmly seconded by the children, and agreed to by every\r\none. It was settled, that after they had seen Brimham Crags they should\r\nspend the remainder of the day at Lord C----\'s beautiful place in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe next morning was neither too hot nor too cold, and they set out on\r\ntheir little party of pleasure; the children went with their mother, to\r\ntheir great delight, in the _sociable_; and Mr. Vincent, to his great\r\ndelight, rode with Belinda. When they came within sight of the Crags,\r\nMr. Percival, who was riding with them, exclaimed--"What is that yonder,\r\non the top of one of the great rocking-stones?"\r\n\r\n"It looks like a statue," said Vincent. "It has been put up since we\r\nwere here last."\r\n\r\n"I fancy it has got up of itself," said Belinda, "for it seems to be\r\ngetting down of itself. I think I saw it stoop. Oh! I see now, it is a\r\nman who has got up there, and he seems to have a gun in his hand, has\r\nnot he? He is going through his manual exercise for his diversion--for\r\nthe diversion of the spectators below, I perceive--there is a party of\r\npeople looking at him."\r\n\r\n"Him!" said Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\n"I protest it is a woman!" said Vincent.\r\n\r\n"No, surely," said Belinda: "it cannot be a woman!"\r\n\r\n"Not unless it be Mrs. Freke," replied Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\nIn fact it was Mrs. Freke, who had been out shooting with a party of\r\ngentlemen, and who had scrambled upon this rocking-stone, on the summit\r\nof which she went through the manual exercise at the word of command\r\nfrom her officer. As they rode nearer to the scene of action, Belinda\r\nheard the shrill screams of a female voice, and they descried amongst\r\nthe gentlemen a slight figure in a riding habit.\r\n\r\n"Miss Moreton, I suppose," said Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\n"Poor girl! what are they doing with her?" cried Belinda.\r\n\r\n"They seem to be forcing her up to the top of that place, where she has\r\nno mind to go. Look how Mrs. Freke drags her up by the arm!"\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer, they heard Mrs. Freke laughing loud as she rocked\r\nthis frightened girl upon the top of the stone.\r\n\r\n"We had better keep out of the way, I think," said Belinda: "for\r\nperhaps, as she has vowed vengeance against me, she might take a fancy\r\nto setting me upon that pinnacle of glory."\r\n\r\n"She dare not," cried Vincent, his eyes flashing with anger: "you may\r\ntrust to us to defend you."\r\n\r\n"Certainly!--But I will not run into danger on purpose to give you the\r\npleasure of defending me," said Belinda; and as she spoke, she turned\r\nher horse another way.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t turn back, Miss Portman?" cried Vincent eagerly, laying his\r\nhand on her bridle.--"Good Heavens, ma\'am! we can\'t run away!--We came\r\nhere to look at these rocking-stones!--We have not half seen them. Lady\r\nAnne and the children will be here immediately. You would not deprive\r\nthem of the pleasure of seeing these things!"\r\n\r\n"I doubt whether they would have much pleasure in seeing _some of these\r\nthings!_ and as to the rest, if I disappoint the children now, Mr.\r\nPercival will, perhaps, have the goodness to bring them some other day."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Mr. Percival: "Miss Portman shows her usual prudence."\r\n\r\n"The children are so good tempered, that I am sure they will forgive\r\nme," continued Belinda; "and Mr. Vincent will be ashamed not to follow\r\ntheir example, though he seems to be rather angry with me at present for\r\nobliging him to turn back--out of the path of danger."\r\n\r\n"You must not be surprised at that," said Mr. Percival, laughing; "for\r\nMr. Vincent is a lover and a hero. You know it is a ruled case, in all\r\nromances, that when a lover and his mistress go out riding together,\r\nsome adventure must befal them. The horse must run away with the lady,\r\nand the gentleman must catch her in his arms just as her neck is about\r\nto be broken. If the horse has been too well trained for the heroine\'s\r\npurpose, \'some footpad, bandit fierce, or mountaineer,\' some jealous\r\nrival must make his appearance quite unexpectedly at the turn of a road,\r\nand the lady must be carried off--robes flying--hair streaming--like\r\nBuerger\'s Leonora. Then her lover must come to her rescue just in the\r\nproper moment. But if the damsel cannot conveniently be run away with,\r\nshe must, as the last resource, tumble into a river to make herself\r\ninteresting, and the hero must be at least half drowned in dragging her\r\nout, that she may be under eternal obligations to him, and at last be\r\nforced to marry him out of pure gratitude."\r\n\r\n"Gratitude!" interrupted Mr. Vincent: "he is no hero, to my mind, who\r\nwould be content with gratitude, instead of love."\r\n\r\n"You need not alarm yourself: Miss Portman does not seem inclined to\r\nput you to the trial, you see," said Mr. Percival, smiling. "Now it\r\nis really to be regretted, that she deprived you of an opportunity of\r\nfighting some of the gentlemen in Mrs. Freke\'s train, or of delivering\r\nher from the perilous height of one of those rocking-stones. It would\r\nhave been a new incident in a novel."\r\n\r\n"How that poor girl screamed!" said Belinda. "Was her terror real or\r\naffected?"\r\n\r\n"Partly real, partly affected, I fancy," said Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\n"I pity her," said Mr. Vincent; "for Mrs. Freke leads her a weary life."\r\n\r\n"She is certainly to be pitied, but also to be blamed," said Mr.\r\nPercival. "You do not know her history. Miss Moreton ran away from her\r\nfriends to live with this Mrs. Freke, who has led her into all kinds\r\nof mischief and absurdity. The girl is weak and vain, and believes that\r\nevery thing becomes her which Mrs. Freke assures her is becoming. At one\r\ntime she was persuaded to go to a public ball with her arms as bare as\r\nJuno\'s, and her feet as naked as Mad. Tallien\'s. At another time Miss\r\nMoreton (who unfortunately has never heard the Greek proverb, that half\r\nis better than the whole,) was persuaded by Mrs. Freke to lay aside, her\r\nhalf boots, and to equip herself in men\'s whole boots; and thus she rode\r\nabout the country, to the amazement of all the world. These are trifles;\r\nbut women who love to set the world at defiance in trifles seldom\r\nrespect its opinion in matters of consequence. Miss Moreton\'s whole\r\nboots in the morning, and her bare feet in the evening, were talked of\r\nby every body, till she gave them more to talk of about her attachment\r\nto a young officer. Mrs. Freke, whose philosophy is professedly\r\nlatitudinarian in morals, laughed at the girl\'s prejudice in favour of\r\nthe ceremony of marriage. So did the officer; for Miss Moreton had\r\nno fortune. It is suspected that the young lady did not feel the\r\ndifficulty, which philosophers are sometimes said to find in suiting\r\ntheir practice to their theory. The _unenlightened_ world reprobated the\r\ntheory much, and the practice more. I am inclined, in spite of scandal,\r\nto think the poor girl was only imprudent: at all events, she repents\r\nher folly too late. She has now no friend upon earth but Mrs. Freke, who\r\nis, in fact, her worst enemy, and who tyrannizes over her without mercy.\r\nImagine what it is to be the butt of a buffoon!"\r\n\r\n"What a lesson to young ladies in the choice of female friends!" said\r\nBelinda. "But had Miss Moreton no relations, who could interfere to get\r\nher out of Mrs. Freke\'s hands?"\r\n\r\n"Her father and mother were old, and, what is more contemptible,\r\nold-fashioned: she would not listen to their advice; she ran away from\r\nthem. Some of her relations were, I believe, willing that she should\r\nstay with Mrs. Freke, because she was a dashing, fashionable woman, and\r\nthey thought it might be what is called _an advantage_ to her. She had\r\none relation, indeed, who was quite of a different opinion, who saw the\r\ndanger of her situation, and remonstrated in the strongest manner--but\r\nto no purpose. This was a cousin of Miss Moreton\'s, a respectable\r\nclergyman. Mrs. Freke was so much incensed by his _insolent\r\ninterference_, as she was pleased to call it, that she made an effigy\r\nof Mr. Moreton dressed in his canonicals, and hung the figure up as a\r\nscarecrow in a garden close by the high road. He was so much beloved\r\nand respected for his benevolence and unaffected piety, that Mrs. Freke\r\ntotally failed in her design of making him ridiculous; her scarecrow was\r\ntorn to pieces by his parishioners; and though, in the true spirit of\r\ncharity, he did all he could to moderate their indignation against\r\nhis enemy, the lady became such an object of detestation, that she was\r\nfollowed with hisses and groans whenever she appeared, and she dared not\r\nventure within ten miles of the village.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Freke now changed the mode of her persecution: she was acquainted\r\nwith a nobleman from whom our clergyman expected a living, and she\r\nworked upon his lordship so successfully, that he insisted upon having\r\nan apology made to the lady. Mr. Moreton had as much dignity of mind as\r\ngentleness of character; his forbearance was that of principle, and so\r\nwas his firmness: he refused to make the concessions that were required.\r\nHis noble patron bullied. Though he had a large family to provide for,\r\nthe clergyman would not degrade himself by any improper submission. The\r\nincumbent died, and the living was given to a more compliant friend. So\r\nends the history of one of Mrs. Freke\'s numerous frolics."\r\n\r\n"This was the story," said Mr. Vincent, "which effectually changed my\r\nopinion of her. Till I heard it, I always looked upon her as one of\r\nthose thoughtless, good-natured people, who, as the common saying is, do\r\nnobody any harm but themselves."\r\n\r\n"It is difficult in society," said Mr. Percival, "especially for women,\r\nto do harm to themselves, without doing harm to others. They may begin\r\nin frolic, but they must end in malice. They defy the world--the world\r\nin return excommunicates them--the female outlaws become desperate, and\r\nmake it the business and pride of their lives to disturb the peace of\r\ntheir sober neighbours. Women who have lowered themselves in the public\r\nopinion cannot rest without attempting to bring others to their own\r\nlevel."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Freke, notwithstanding the blustering merriment that she affects,\r\nis obviously unhappy," said Belinda; "and since we cannot do her any\r\ngood, either by our blame or our pity, we had better think of something\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"Scandal," said Mr. Vincent, "does not seem to give you much pleasure,\r\nMiss Portman. You will be glad to hear that Mrs. Freke\'s malice against\r\npoor Mr. Moreton has not ruined him. Do you know Mr. Percival, that he\r\nhas just been presented to a good living by a generous young man, who\r\nheard of his excellent conduct?"\r\n\r\n"I am extremely glad of it," said Mr. Percival. "Who is this generous\r\nyoung man? I should like to be acquainted with him."\r\n\r\n"So should I," said Mr. Vincent: "he is a Mr. Hervey."\r\n\r\n"Clarence Hervey, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Clarence was his name."\r\n\r\n"No man more likely to do a generous action than Clarence Hervey," said\r\nMr. Percival.\r\n\r\n"Nobody more likely to do a generous action than Mr. Hervey," repeated\r\nBelinda, in rather a low tone. She could now praise Clarence Hervey\r\nwithout blushing, and she could think even of his generosity without\r\npartiality, though not without pleasure. By strength of mind, and\r\ntimely exertion, she had prevented her prepossession from growing into a\r\npassion that might have made her miserable. Proud of this conquest over\r\nherself, she was now disposed to treat Mr. Vincent with more favour\r\nthan usual. Self-complacency generally puts us in good-humour with our\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAfter spending some pleasant hours in Lord C------\'s beautiful grounds,\r\nwhere the children explored to their satisfaction every dingle and bushy\r\ndell, they returned home in the cool of the evening. Mr. Vincent thought\r\nit the most delightful evening he had ever felt.\r\n\r\n"What! as charming as a West Indian evening?" said Mr. Percival. "This\r\nis more than I expected ever to hear you acknowledge in favour of\r\nEngland. Do you remember how you used to rave of the climate and of the\r\nprospects of Jamaica?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but my taste has quite changed."\r\n\r\n"I remember the time," said Mr. Percival, "when you thought it\r\nimpossible that your taste should ever change; when you told me that\r\ntaste, whether for the beauties of animate or inanimate nature, was\r\nimmutable."\r\n\r\n"You and Miss Portman have taught me better sense. First loves are\r\ngenerally silly things," added he, colouring a little. Belinda coloured\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n"First loves," continued Mr. Percival, "are not necessarily more foolish\r\nthan others; but the chances are certainly against them. From poetry or\r\nromance, young people usually form their earlier ideas of love, before\r\nthey have actually felt the passion; and the image which they have in\r\ntheir own minds of the _beau ideal_ is cast upon the first objects they\r\nafterward behold. This, if I may be allowed the expression, is Cupid\'s\r\nFata Morgana. Deluded mortals are in ecstasy whilst the illusion lasts,\r\nand in despair when it vanishes."\r\n\r\nMr. Percival appeared to be unconscious that what he was saying was any\r\nway applicable to Belinda. He addressed himself to Mr. Vincent solely,\r\nand she listened at her ease.\r\n\r\n"But," said she, "do not you think that this prejudice, as I am willing\r\nto allow it to be, in favour of first loves, may _in our sex_ be\r\nadvantageous? Even when a woman may be convinced--that she ought not\r\nto indulge a _first_ love, should she not be prevented by delicacy from\r\nthinking of a second?"\r\n\r\n"Delicacy, my dear Miss Portman, is a charming word, and a still more\r\ncharming thing, and Mrs. Freke has probably increased our affection for\r\nit; but even delicacy, like all other virtues, must be judged of by the\r\ntest of utility. We should run into romance, and error, and misery, if\r\nwe did not constantly refer to this standard. Our reasonings as to the\r\nconduct of life, as far as moral prudence is concerned, must depend\r\nultimately upon facts. Now, of the numbers of people in this world, how\r\nmany do you think have married their _first loves?_ Probably not one\r\nout of ten. Then, would you have nine out of ten pine all their lives in\r\ncelibacy, or fret in matrimony, because they cannot have the persons who\r\nfirst struck their _fancy?_"\r\n\r\n"I acknowledge this would not add to the happiness of society," said\r\nBelinda.\r\n\r\n"Nor to its virtue," said Mr. Percival. "I scarcely know an idea more\r\ndangerous to domestic happiness than this belief in the unextinguishable\r\nnature of a first flame. There are people who would persuade us that,\r\nthough it may be smothered for years, it must break out at last,\r\nand blaze with destructive fury. Pernicious doctrine! false as it is\r\npernicious!--The struggles between duty and passion may be the charm of\r\nromance, but must be the misery of real life. The woman who marries\r\none man, and loves another, who, in spite of all that an amiable and\r\nestimable husband can do to win her confidence and affection, nourishes\r\nin secret a _fatal_ prepossession for her first love, may perhaps, by\r\nthe eloquence of a fine writer, be made an interesting heroine;--but\r\nwould any man of sense or feeling choose to be troubled with such\r\na wife?--Would not even the idea that women admired such conduct\r\nnecessarily tend to diminish our confidence, if not in their virtue,\r\nat least in their sincerity? And would not this suspicion destroy our\r\nhappiness? Husbands may sometimes have delicate feelings as well as\r\ntheir wives, though they are seldom allowed to have any by these unjust\r\nnovel writers. Now, could a husband who has any delicacy be content to\r\npossess the person without the mind?--the duty without the love?--Could\r\nhe be perfectly happy, if, in the fondest moments, he might doubt\r\nwhether he were an object of disgust or affection?--whether the smiles\r\nof apparent joy were only the efforts of a suffering martyr?--Thank\r\nHeaven! I am not married to one of these charming martyrs. Let those\r\nlive with them who admire them. For my part, I admire and love the wife,\r\nwho not only seems but is happy--as I," added Mr. Percival smiling,\r\n"have the fond credulity to believe. If I have spoken too long or\r\ntoo warmly upon the chapter of _first loves_, I have at least been a\r\nperfectly disinterested declaimer; for I can assure you, Miss Portman,\r\nthat I do not suspect Lady Anne Percival of sighing in secret for some\r\nvision of perfection, any more than she suspects me of pining for the\r\ncharming Lady Delacour, who, perhaps, you may have heard was my _first\r\nlove_. In these days, however, so few people marry with even the\r\npretence to love of any sort, that you will think I might have spared\r\nthis tirade. No; there are ingenuous minds which will never be enslaved\r\nby fashion or interest, though they may be exposed to be deceived by\r\nromance, or by the _delicacy_ of their own imaginations."\r\n\r\n"I hear," said Belinda, smiling, "I hear and understand the emphasis\r\nwith which you pronounce that word _delicacy_. I see you have not\r\nforgotten that I used it improperly half an hour ago, as you have\r\nconvinced me."\r\n\r\n"Happy they," said Mr. Percival, "who can be convinced in half an hour!\r\nThere are some people who cannot be convinced in a whole life, and who\r\nend where they began, with saying--\'This is my opinion--I always thought\r\nso, and always shall.\'"\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent at all times loved Mr. Percival; but he never felt so much\r\naffection for him as he did this evening, and his arguments appeared to\r\nhim unanswerable. Though Belinda had never mentioned to Mr. Vincent\r\nthe name of Clarence Hervey till this day, and though he did not in the\r\nleast suspect from her manner that this gentleman ever possessed any\r\ninterest in her heart; yet, with her accustomed sincerity, she had\r\nconfessed to him that an impression had been made upon her mind before\r\nshe came to Oakly-park.\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation with Mr. Percival, Mr. Vincent perceived that he\r\ngained ground more rapidly in her favour; and his company grew every day\r\nmore agreeable to her taste: he was convinced that, as he possessed her\r\nesteem, he should in time secure her affections.\r\n\r\n"In time," repeated Lady Anne Percival: "you must allow her time, or you\r\nwill spoil all."\r\n\r\nIt was with some difficulty that Mr. Vincent restrained his impatience,\r\neven though he was persuaded of the prudence of his friend\'s advice.\r\nThings went on in this happy, but as he thought slow, state of\r\nprogression till towards the latter end of September.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning Lady Anne Percival came into Belinda\'s room with a\r\nbridal favour in her hand. "Do you know," said she, "that we are to have\r\na wedding to-day? This favour has just been sent to my maid. Lucy, the\r\npretty girl whom you may remember to have seen some time ago with\r\nthat prettily turned necklace, is the bride, and James Jackson is the\r\nbridegroom. Mr. Vincent has let them a very pretty little farm in the\r\nneighbourhood, and--hark! there\'s the sound of music."\r\n\r\nThey looked out of the window, and they saw a troop of villagers,\r\ngaily dressed, going to the wedding. Lady Anne, who was always eager to\r\npromote innocent festivity, sent immediately to have a tent pitched\r\nin the park; and all the rural company were invited to a dance in the\r\nevening: it was a very cheerful spectacle. Belinda heard from all sides\r\npraises of Mr. Vincent\'s generosity; and she could not be insensible to\r\nthe simple but enthusiastic testimony which Juba bore to his master\'s\r\ngoodness. Juba had composed, in his broken dialect, a little song\r\nin honour of his master, which he sang to his banjore with the most\r\ntouching expression of joyful gratitude. In some of the stanzas Belinda\r\ncould distinguish that her own name was frequently repeated. Lady Anne\r\ncalled him, and desired to have the words of this song. They were a\r\nmixture of English and of his native language; they described in the\r\nstrongest manner what had been his feelings whilst he was under the\r\nterror of Mrs. Freke\'s fiery obeah-woman, then his joy on being\r\nrelieved from these horrors, with the delightful sensations of returning\r\nhealth;--and thence he suddenly passed to his gratitude to Belinda, the\r\nperson to whom he owed his recovery. He concluded with wishing her all\r\nsorts of happiness, and, above all, that she might be fortunate in\r\nher love; which Juba thought the highest degree of felicity. He had no\r\nsooner finished his song, which particularly touched and pleased\r\nMiss Portman, than he begged his master to offer to her the little\r\ninstrument, which he had made with much pains and ingenuity. She\r\naccepted the banjore with a smile that enchanted Mr. Vincent; but at\r\nthis instant they were startled by the sound of a carriage driving\r\nrapidly into the park. Belinda looked up, and between the heads of\r\nthe dancers she just caught a glimpse of a well-known livery. "Good\r\nheavens!" she exclaimed, "Lady Delacour\'s carriage!--Can it be Lady\r\nDelacour?"\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped, and Marriott hastily jumped out of it. Belinda\r\npressed forward to meet her; poor Marriott was in great agitation:--"Oh,\r\nMiss Portman! my poor lady is very ill--very ill, indeed. She has sent\r\nme for you--here\'s her letter. Dear Miss Portman, I hope you won\'t\r\nrefuse to come; she _has_ been very ill, and is very ill; but she would\r\nbe better, if she could see you again. But I\'ll tell every thing, ma\'am,\r\nwhen we are by ourselves, and when you have read your letter."\r\n\r\nMiss Portman immediately accompanied Marriott towards the house; and as\r\nthey walked thither, she learned that Lady Delacour had applied to\r\nthe quack-doctor in whom she had such implicit faith, and had in vain\r\nendeavoured to engage him to perform for her the operation to which she\r\nhad determined to submit. He was afraid to hazard it, and he prevailed\r\nupon her to give up the scheme, and to try some new external remedy from\r\nwhich he promised wonders. No one knew what his medicines were, but they\r\naffected her head in the most alarming manner.\r\n\r\nIn her delirium she called frequently upon Miss Portman; sometimes\r\naccusing her of the basest treachery, sometimes addressing her as if she\r\nwere present, and pouring forth the warmest expressions of friendship.\r\n"In her lucid intervals, ma\'am," continued Marriott, "she for some weeks\r\nscarcely ever mentioned your name, nor could bear to hear me mention\r\nit. One day, when I was saying how much I wished that you were with her\r\nagain, she darted at me the most terrible look that ever I beheld.\r\n\r\n"\'When I am in my grave, Marriott,\' cried my lady, \'it will be time\r\nenough for Miss Portman again to visit this house, and you may then\r\nexpress your attachment to her with more propriety than at present.\'\r\nThese were my lady\'s own words--I shall never forget them: they struck\r\nand astonished me, ma\'am, so much, I stood like one stupified, and then\r\nleft the room to think them over again by myself, and make sense of\r\nthem, if I could. Well, ma\'am, to be sure, it then struck me like a\r\nflash of lightning, that my lady was jealous--and, begging your pardon,\r\nma\'am--of you. This seemed to me the most unnatural thing in the world,\r\nconsidering how easy my lady had always seemed to be about my lord; but\r\nit was now clear to me, that this was the cause of your leaving us so\r\nsuddenly, ma\'am. Well, I was confident that Mr. Champfort was at the\r\nbottom of the business from the first; and now that I knew what scent to\r\ngo upon, I went to work with fresh spirit to find him out, which was a\r\nthing I was determined upon--and what I\'m determined upon, I generally\r\ndo, ma\'am. So I put together things about Miss Portman and my lord, that\r\nhad dropped at odd times from Sir Philip Baddely\'s gentleman; and I,\r\npartly serious and partly flirting, which in a good cause is no sin,\r\ndrew from him (for he pretends to be a little an admirer of mine, ma\'am,\r\nthough I never gave him the smallest encouragement) all he knew or\r\nsuspected, or had heard reported, or whispered; and out it came, ma\'am,\r\nthat Mr. Champfort was the original of all; and that he had told a heap\r\nof lies about some bank-notes that my lord had given you, and that you\r\nand my lord were to be married as soon as my lady was dead; and I\r\ndon\'t know what, which he maliciously circulated through Sir Philip\'s\r\ngentleman to Sir Philip himself, and so round again to my lady. Now, Sir\r\nPhilip\'s man behaved like a gentleman upon the occasion, which I shall\r\never be free to acknowledge and remember: and when I represented things\r\nproperly, and made him sensible of the mischief, which, he assured me,\r\nwas done purely with an eye to serve Sir Philip, his master, he very\r\ncandidly offered to assist me to unmask that villain Champfort, which\r\nhe could easily do with the assistance of a few bottles of claret, and\r\na few fair words; which, though I can\'t abide hypocrisy, I thought\r\nquite allowable upon such an occasion. So, ma\'am, when Mr. Champfort was\r\nthrown off his guard by the claret, Sir Philip\'s gentleman began to talk\r\nof my lord and my lady, and Miss Portman; and he observed that my lord\r\nand my lady were coming together more than they used to be since Miss\r\nPortman left the house. To which Champfort replied with an oath, like an\r\nunmannered reprobate as he is, and in his gibberish, French and English,\r\nwhich I can\'t speak; but the sense of it was this:--\'My lord and lady\r\nshall never come together, if I can help it. It was to hinder this I got\r\nMiss Portman banished; for my lord was quite another man after she got\r\nMiss Helena into the house; and I don\'t doubt but he might have been\r\nbrought to leave off his burgundy, and set up for a sober, regular man;\r\nwhich would not suit me at all. If my lady once was to get power over\r\nhim again, I might go whistle--so (with another reprobate oath) my lord\r\nand my lady shall never come together again whilst I live.\'\r\n\r\n"Well, ma\'am," continued Marriott, "as soon as I was in possession of\r\nthis precious speech, I carried it and a letter of Sir Philip Baddely\'s\r\ngentleman vouching it to my lady. My lady was thunderstruck, and so\r\nvexed to have been, as she said, a dupe, that she sent for my lord\r\ndirectly, and insisted upon his giving up Mr. Champfort. My lord\r\ndemurred, because my lady spoke so high, and said _insist_. He would\r\nhave done it, I\'m satisfied, of his own accord with the greatest\r\npleasure, if my lady had not, as it were, commanded it. But he answered\r\nat last, \'My Lady Delacour, I\'m not a man to be governed by a wife--I\r\nshall keep or part with my own servants in my own house, according to my\r\nown pleasure;\' and saying so, he left the room. I never saw my lady so\r\nangry as she was at this refusal of my lord to part with him. The house\r\nwas quite in a state of distraction for some days. I never would sit\r\ndown to the same table, ma\'am, with Mr. Champfort, nor speak to him, nor\r\nlook at him, and parties ran high above and below stairs. And at last my\r\nlady, who had been getting better, took to her bed again with a nervous\r\nfever, which brought her almost to death\'s door; she having been so\r\nmuch weakened before by the quack medicines and convulsions, and all\r\nher sufferings in secret. She would not see my lord on no account, and\r\nChampfort persuaded him her illness was pretence, to bring him to her\r\npurpose; which was the more readily believed, because nobody was ever\r\nlet into my lady\'s bedchamber but myself. All this time she never\r\nmentioned your name, ma\'am; but once, when I was sitting by her bedside,\r\nas she was asleep, she started suddenly, and cried out, \'Oh, my dearest\r\nBelinda! are you come back to me?\'--She awakened herself with the start;\r\nand raising herself quite up in her bed, she pulled back the curtains,\r\nand looked all round the room. I\'m sure she expected to see you; and\r\nwhen she found it was a dream, she gave a heavy sigh, and sank down upon\r\nher pillow. I then could not forbear to speak, and this time my lady was\r\ngreatly touched when I mentioned your name:--she shed tears, ma\'am; and\r\nyou know it is not a little thing that can draw tears from my lady. But\r\nwhen I said something about sending for you, she answered, she was sure\r\nyou would not return to her, and that she would never condescend to\r\nask a favour in vain, even from you. Then I replied that I was sure you\r\nloved her still, and as well as ever: and that the proof of that was,\r\nthat Mrs. Luttridge and Mrs. Freke together, by all their wiles,\r\ncould not draw you over to their party at Harrowgate, and that you had\r\naffronted Mrs. Freke by defending her ladyship. My lady was all surprise\r\nat this, and eagerly asked how I came to know it. Now, ma\'am, I had it\r\nall by a post letter from Mrs. Luttridge\'s maid, who is my cousin, and\r\nknows every thing that\'s going on. My lady from this moment forward\r\ncould scarce rest an instant without wishing for you, and fretting for\r\nyou as I knew by her manner. One day my lord met me on the stairs as I\r\nwas coming down from my poor lady\'s room, and he asked me how she was,\r\nand why she did not send for a physician. \'The best physician, my lord,\r\nshe could send for,\' said I, \'would be Miss Portman; for she\'ll never be\r\nwell till that good young lady comes back again, in my humble opinion.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And what should prevent that good young lady from coming back again?\r\nNot I, surely,\' rejoined my lord, \'for I wish she were here with all my\r\nheart.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It is not easy to suppose, my lord,\' said I, \'after all that has\r\npassed, that the young lady would choose to return, or that my lady\r\nwould ask her, whilst Mr. Champfort remains paramount in the house.\'\r\n\'If that\'s all,\' cried my lord, \'tell your lady I\'ll part with Champfort\r\nupon the spot; for the rascal has just had the insolence to insist upon\r\nit, that a pair of new boots are not too tight for me, when I said they\r\nwere. I\'ll show him I can be master, and will, in my own house.\' Ma\'am,\r\nmy heart leaped for joy within me at hearing these words, and I ran up\r\nto my lady with them. I easily concluded in my own mind, that my lord\r\nwas glad of the pretence of the boots, to give up handsomely after his\r\nstanding out so long. To be sure, my lord\'s mightily jealous of being\r\nmaster, and mighty fond of his own way; but I forgive him every thing\r\nfor doing as I would have him at last, and dismissing that prince of\r\nmischief-makers, Mr. Champfort. My lady called for her writing-desk\r\ndirectly, and sat up in her bed, and with her trembling hand, as you see\r\nby the writing, ma\'am, wrote a letter to you as fast as ever she could,\r\nand the postchaise was ordered. I don\'t know what fancy seized her--but\r\nif you remember, ma\'am, the hammercloth to her new carriage had orange\r\nand black fringe at first: she would not use it, till this had been\r\nchanged to blue and white. Well, ma\'am, she recollected this on a\r\nsudden, as I was getting ready to come for you; and she set the servants\r\nat work directly to take off the blue and white, and put on the black\r\nand orange fringe again, which she said must be done before your coming.\r\nAnd my lady ordered her own footman to ride along with me; and I have\r\ncome post, and have travelled night and day, and will never rest till\r\nI get back. But, ma\'am, I won\'t keep you any longer from reading your\r\nletter, only to say, that I hope to Heaven you will not refuse to return\r\nto my poor lady, if it be only to put her mind at ease before she dies.\r\nShe cannot have long to live."\r\n\r\nAs Marriott finished these words they reached the house, and Belinda\r\nwent to her own room to read Lady Delacour\'s letter. It contained none\r\nof her customary \'_eloquence du billet_,\' no sprightly wit, no real, no\r\naffected gaiety; her mind seemed to be exhausted by bodily suffering,\r\nand her high spirit subdued. She expressed the most poignant anguish\r\nfor having indulged such unjust suspicions and intemperate passions.\r\nShe lamented having forfeited the esteem and affection of the only\r\nreal friend she had ever possessed--a friend of whose forbearance,\r\ntenderness, and fidelity, she had received such indisputable proofs.\r\nShe concluded by saying, "I feel my end fast approaching, and perhaps,\r\nBelinda, your humanity will induce you to grant my last request, and to\r\nlet me see you once more before I die."\r\n\r\nBelinda immediately decided to return to Lady Delacour--though it was\r\nwith real regret that she thought of leaving Lady Anne Percival, and the\r\namiable and happy family to whom she had become so much attached. The\r\nchildren crowded round her when they heard that she was going, and Mr.\r\nVincent stood in silent sorrow--but we spare our readers this parting\r\nscene Miss Portman promised to return to Oakly-park as soon as she\r\npossibly could. Mr. Vincent anxiously requested permission to follow her\r\nto town: but this she positively refused; and he submitted with as good\r\na grace as a lover can submit to any thing that crosses his passion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nRECONCILIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAware that her remaining in town at such an unusual season of the\r\nyear would appear unaccountable to her fashionable acquaintance, Lady\r\nDelacour contrived for herself a characteristic excuse; she declared\r\nthat there was no possibility of finding pleasure in any thing but\r\nnovelty, and that the greatest novelty to her would be to remain a whole\r\nsummer in town. Most of her friends, amongst whom she had successfully\r\nestablished a character for caprice, were satisfied that this was merely\r\nsome new whim, practised to signalize herself by singularity. The real\r\nreason that detained her was her dependence upon the empiric, who\r\nhad repeatedly visited and constantly prescribed for her. Convinced,\r\nhowever, by the dreadful situation to which his prescriptions had lately\r\nreduced her that he was unworthy of her confidence, she determined to\r\ndismiss him: but she could not do this, as she had a considerable sum to\r\npay him, till Marriott\'s return, because she could not trust any one but\r\nMarriott to let him up the private staircase into the boudoir.\r\n\r\nDuring Marriott\'s absence, her ladyship suffered no one to attend her\r\nbut a maid who was remarkable for her stupidity. She thought that she\r\ncould have nothing to fear from this girl\'s spirit of inquiry, for never\r\nwas any human being so destitute of curiosity. It was about noon when\r\nBelinda and Marriott arrived. Lady Delacour, who had passed a restless\r\nnight, was asleep. When she awoke, she found Marriott standing beside\r\nher bed.\r\n\r\n"Then it is all in vain, I see," cried her ladyship: "Miss Portman is\r\nnot with you?--Give me my laudanum."\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman is come, my lady," said Marriott; "she is in the\r\ndressing-room: she would not come in here with me, lest she should\r\nstartle you."\r\n\r\n"Belinda is come, do you say? Admirable Belinda!" cried Lady Delacour,\r\nand she clasped her hands with ecstasy.\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell her, my lady, that you are awake?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--no--stay--Lord Delacour is at home. I will get up immediately.\r\nLet my lord be told that I wish to speak with him--that I beg he will\r\nbreakfast with me in my dressing-room half an hour hence. I will dress\r\nimmediately."\r\n\r\nMarriott in vain represented that she ought not to hurry herself in\r\nher present weak state. Intent upon her own thoughts, she listened to\r\nnothing that was said, but frequently urged Marriott to be expeditious.\r\nShe put on an unusual quantity of rouge: then looking at herself in the\r\nglass, she said, with a forced smile, "Marriott, I look so charmingly,\r\nthat Miss Portman, perhaps, will be of Lord Delacour\'s opinion, and\r\nthink that nothing is the matter with me. Ah! no; she has been behind\r\nthe scenes--she knows the truth too well!--Marriott, pray did she\r\nask you many questions about me?--Was not she very sorry to leave\r\nOakly-park?--Were not they all extremely concerned to part with\r\nher?--Did she ask after Helena?--Did you tell her that I insisted upon\r\nmy lord\'s parting with Champfort?"\r\n\r\nAt the word Champfort, Marriott\'s mouth opened eagerly, and she began to\r\nanswer with her usual volubility. Lady Delacour waited not for any reply\r\nto the various questions which, in the hurry of her mind, she had\r\nasked; but, passing swiftly by Marriott, she threw open the door of her\r\ndressing-room. At the sight of Belinda she stopped short; and, totally\r\noverpowered, she would have sunk upon the floor, had not Miss Portman\r\ncaught her in her arms, and supported her to a sofa. When she came to\r\nherself, and heard the soothing tone of Belinda\'s voice, she looked up\r\ntimidly in her face for a few moments without being able to speak.\r\n\r\n"And are you really here once more, my dear Belinda?" cried she at last;\r\n"and may I still call you my friend?--and do you forgive me?--Yes,\r\nI _see_ you do--and from you I can endure the humiliation of being\r\nforgiven. Enjoy the noble sense of your own superiority."\r\n\r\n"My dear Lady Delacour," said Belinda, "you see all this in too strong a\r\nlight: you have done me no injury--I have nothing to forgive."\r\n\r\n"I _cannot_ see it in too strong a light.--Nothing to forgive!--Yes, you\r\nhave; that which it is the most difficult to forgive--injustice. Oh, how\r\nyou must have despised me for the folly, the meanness of my suspicions!\r\nOf all tempers that which appears to me, and I am sure to you, the most\r\ndespicable, the most intolerable, is a suspicious temper. Mine was once\r\nopen, generous as your own--you see how the best dispositions may be\r\ndepraved--what am I now? Fit only\r\n\r\n    \'To point a moral, or adorn a tale\'--\r\n\r\na mismatched, misplaced, miserable, perverted being."\r\n\r\n"And now you have abused yourself till you are breathless, I may have\r\nsome chance," said Belinda, "of being heard in your defence. I perfectly\r\nagree with you in thinking that a suspicious temper is despicable and\r\nintolerable; but there is a vast difference between an acute fit of\r\njealousy, as our friend Dr. X---- would say, and a chronic habit\r\nof suspicion. The noblest natures may be worked up to suspicion by\r\ndesigning villany; and then a handkerchief, or a hammercloth, \'trifles\r\nas light as air\'--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, you are too good. But my folly admits of no excuse, no\r\npalliation," interrupted Lady Delacour; "mine was jealousy without\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"That indeed would admit of no excuse," said Belinda; "therefore you\r\nwill pardon me if I think it incredible--especially as I have detected\r\nyou in feeling something like affection for your little daughter, after\r\nyou had done your best, I mean your worst, to make me believe that you\r\nwere a monster of a mother."\r\n\r\n"That was quite another affair, my dear. I did not know Helena was worth\r\nloving. I did not imagine my little daughter could love me. When I found\r\nmy mistake, I changed my tone. But there is no hope of mistake with my\r\npoor husband. Your own sense must show you, that Lord Delacour is not a\r\nman to beloved."\r\n\r\n"That could not _always_ have been your ladyship\'s opinion," said\r\nBelinda, with an arch smile.\r\n\r\n"Lord! my dear," said Lady Delacour, a little embarrassed, "in the\r\nhighest paroxysm of my madness, I never suspected that you could _love_\r\nLord Delacour; I surely only hinted that you were in love with his\r\ncoronet. That was absurd enough in all conscience--don\'t make me more\r\nabsurd than I am."\r\n\r\n"Is it then the height of absurdity to love a husband?"\r\n\r\n"Love! Nonsense!--Impossible!--Hush! here he comes, with his odious\r\ncreaking shoes. What man can ever expect to be loved who wears creaking\r\nshoes?" pursued her ladyship, as Lord Delacour entered the room,\r\nhis shoes creaking at every step; and assuming an air of levity, she\r\nwelcomed him as a stranger to her dressing-room. "No speeches, my lord!\r\nno speeches, I beseech you," cried she, as he was beginning to speak to\r\nMiss Portman. "Believe me, that explanations always make bad worse. Miss\r\nPortman is here, thank Heaven! and her; and Champfort is gone, thank\r\nyou--or your boots. And now let us sit down to breakfast, and forget as\r\nsoon as possible every thing that is disagreeable."\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Delacour had a mind to banish painful recollections, it was\r\nscarcely possible to resist the magical influence of her conversation\r\nand manners; yet her lord\'s features never relaxed to a smile during\r\nthis breakfast. He maintained an obstinate silence, and a profound\r\nsolemnity--till at last, rising from table, he turned to Miss Portman,\r\nand said, "Of all the caprices of fine ladies, that which surprises me\r\nthe most is the whim of keeping their beds without being sick. Now, Miss\r\nPortman, you would hardly suppose that my Lady Delacour, who has been so\r\nlively this morning, has kept her bed, as I am informed, a fortnight--is\r\nnot this astonishing?"\r\n\r\n"Prodigiously astonishing, that my Lord Delacour, like all the rest of\r\nthe world, should be liable to be deceived by appearances," cried her\r\nladyship. "Honour me with your attention for a few minutes, my lord, and\r\nperhaps I may increase your astonishment."\r\n\r\nHis lordship, struck by the sudden change of her voice from gaiety\r\nto gravity, fixed his eyes upon her and returned to his seat. She\r\npaused--then addressing herself to Belinda, "My incomparable friend,"\r\nsaid she, "I will now give you a convincing proof of the unlimited power\r\nyou have over my mind. My lord, Miss Portman has persuaded me to the\r\nstep which I am now going to take. She has prevailed upon me to make a\r\ndecisive trial of your prudence and kindness. She has determined me to\r\nthrow myself on your mercy."\r\n\r\n"Mercy!" repeated Lord Delacour; and a confused idea, that she was\r\nnow about to make a confession of the justice of some of his former\r\nsuspicions, took possession of his mind: he looked aghast.\r\n\r\n"I am going, my lord, to confide to you a secret of the utmost\r\nimportance--a secret which is known to but three people in the\r\nworld--Miss Portman, Marriott, and a man whose name I cannot reveal to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Stop, Lady Delacour!" cried his lordship, with a degree of emotion and\r\nenergy which he had never shown till now: "stop, I conjure, I command\r\nyou, madam! I am not sufficiently master of myself--I once loved you\r\ntoo well to hear such a stroke. Trust me with no such secret--say no\r\nmore--you have said enough--too much. I forgive you, that is all I can\r\ndo: but we must part, Lady Delacour!" said he, breaking from her with\r\nagony expressed in his countenance.\r\n\r\n"The man has a heart, a soul, I protest! You knew him better than I did,\r\nMiss Portman. Nay, you are not gone yet, my lord! You really love me, I\r\nfind."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," cried he, vehemently: "weak as you take me to be, Lady\r\nDelacour, I am incapable of loving a woman who has disgraced me,\r\ndisgraced herself, her family, her station, her high endowments, her--"\r\nHis utterance failed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lady Delacour!" cried Belinda, "how can you trifle in this manner?"\r\n\r\n"I meant not," said her ladyship, "to trifle: I am satisfied. My lord,\r\nit is time that you should be satisfied. I _can_ give you the most\r\nirrefragable proof, that whatever may have been the apparent levity of\r\nmy conduct, you have had no serious cause for jealousy. But the proof\r\nwill shock--disgust you. Have you courage to know more?--Then follow\r\nme."\r\n\r\nHe followed her.--Belinda heard the boudoir door unlocked.--In a few\r\nminutes they returned.--Grief, and horror, and pity, were painted in\r\nLord Delacour\'s countenance, as he passed hastily through the room.\r\n\r\n"My dearest friend, I have taken your advice: would to Heaven I had\r\ntaken it sooner!" said Lady Delacour to Miss Portman. "I have revealed\r\nto Lord Delacour my real situation. Poor man! he was shocked beyond\r\nexpression. He behaved incomparably well. I am convinced that he would,\r\nas he said, let his hand be cut off to save my life. The moment his\r\nfoolish jealousy was extinguished, his love for me revived in full\r\nforce. Would you believe it? he has promised me to break with odious\r\nMrs. Luttridge. Upon my charging him to keep my secret from her, he\r\ninstantly, in the handsomest manner in the world, declared he would\r\nnever see her more, rather than give me a moment\'s uneasiness. How I\r\nreproach myself for having been for years the torment of this man\'s\r\nlife!"\r\n\r\n"You may do better than reproach yourself, my dear Lady Delacour," said\r\nBelinda; "you may yet live for years to be the blessing and pride of his\r\nlife. I am persuaded that nothing but your despair of obtaining domestic\r\nhappiness has so long enslaved you to dissipation; and now that you find\r\na friend in your husband, now that you know the affectionate temper of\r\nyour little Helena, you will have fresh views and fresh hopes; you will\r\nhave the courage to live for yourself, and not for what is called the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"The world!" cried Lady Delacour, with a tone of disdain: "how long has\r\nthat word enslaved a soul formed for higher purposes!" She paused, and\r\nlooked up towards heaven with an expression of fervent devotion, which\r\nBelinda had once, and but once, before seen in her countenance. Then,\r\nas if forgetful even that Belinda was present, she threw herself upon\r\na sofa, and fell, or seemed to fall, into a profound reverie. She\r\nwas roused by the entrance of Marriott, who came into the room to ask\r\nwhether she would now take her laudanum. "I thought I had taken it,"\r\nsaid she in a feeble voice; and as she raised her eyes and saw Belinda,\r\nshe added, with a faint smile, "Miss Portman, I believe, has been\r\nlaudanum to me this morning: but even that will not do long, you see;\r\nnothing will do for me now but _this_," and she stretched out her hand\r\nfor the laudanum. "Is not it shocking to think," continued she, after\r\nshe had swallowed it, "that in laudanum alone I find the means of\r\nsupporting existence?"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand to her head, as if partly conscious of the confusion of\r\nher own ideas: and ashamed that Belinda should witness it, she desired\r\nMarriott to assist her to rise, and to support her to her bedchamber.\r\nShe made a sign to Miss Portman not to follow her. "Do not take it\r\nunkindly, but I am quite exhausted, and wish to be alone; for I am grown\r\nfond of being alone some hours in the day, and perhaps I shall sleep."\r\n\r\nMarriott came out of her lady\'s room about a quarter of an hour\r\nafterward, and said that her lady seemed disposed to sleep, but that she\r\ndesired to have her hook left by her bedside. Marriott searched among\r\nseveral which lay upon the table, for one in which a mark was put.\r\nBelinda looked over them along with Marriott, and she was surprised to\r\nfind that they had almost all methodistical titles. Lady Delacour\'s mark\r\nwas in the middle of Wesley\'s Admonitions. Several pages in other\r\nbooks of the same description Miss Portman found marked in pencil, with\r\nreiterated lines, which she knew to be her ladyship\'s customary mode of\r\ndistinguishing passages that she particularly liked. Some were highly\r\noratorical, but most of them were of a mystical cast, and appeared\r\nto Belinda scarcely intelligible. She had reason to be astonished\r\nat meeting with such books in the dressing-room of a woman of Lady\r\nDelacour\'s character. During the solitude of her illness, her ladyship\r\nhad first begun to think seriously on religious subjects, and the\r\nearly impressions that had been made on her mind in her childhood, by a\r\nmethodistical mother, recurred. Her understanding, weakened perhaps by\r\ndisease, and never accustomed to reason, was incapable of distinguishing\r\nbetween truth and error; and her temper, naturally enthusiastic, hurried\r\nher from one extreme to the other--from thoughtless scepticism to\r\nvisionary credulity. Her devotion was by no means steady or permanent;\r\nit came on by fits usually at the time when the effect of opium was\r\nexhausted, or before a fresh dose began to operate. In these intervals\r\nshe was low-spirited--bitter reflections on the manner in which she had\r\nthrown away her talents and her life obtruded themselves; the idea of\r\nthe untimely death of Colonel Lawless, of which she reproached herself\r\nas the cause, returned; and her mind, from being a prey to remorse,\r\nbegan to sink in these desponding moments under the most dreadful\r\nsuperstitious terrors--terrors the more powerful as they were secret.\r\nWhilst the stimulus of laudanum lasted, the train of her ideas always\r\nchanged, and she was amazed at the weak fears and strange notions by\r\nwhich she had been disturbed; yet it was not in her power entirely\r\nto chase away these visions of the night, and they gained gradually a\r\ndominion over her, of which she was heartily ashamed. She resolved to\r\nconceal this _weakness_, as in her gayer moments she thought it, from\r\nBelinda, from whose superior strength of understanding she dreaded\r\nridicule or contempt. Her experience of Miss Portman\'s gentleness\r\nand friendship might reasonably have prevented or dispelled such\r\napprehensions; but Lady Delacour was governed by pride, by sentiment, by\r\nwhim, by enthusiasm, by passion--by any thing but reason.\r\n\r\nWhen she began to revive after her fit of languor, and had been\r\nrefreshed by opium and sleep, she rang for Marriott, and inquired for\r\nBelinda. She was much provoked when Marriott, by way of proving to her\r\nthat Miss Portman could not have been tired of being left alone, told\r\nher that she had been in the dressing-room _rummaging over the books_.\r\n\r\n"What books?" cried Lady Delacour. "I forgot that _they_ were left\r\nthere. Miss Portman is not reading them still, I suppose? Go for them,\r\nand let them be locked up in my own bookcase, and bring me the key."\r\n\r\nHer ladyship appeared in good spirits when she saw Belinda again. She\r\nrallied her upon the serious studies she had chosen for her morning\'s\r\namusements. "Those methodistical books, with their strange quaint\r\ntitles," said she, "are, however, diverting enough to those who, like\r\nmyself, can find diversion in the height of human absurdity."\r\n\r\nDeceived by the levity of her manner, Belinda concluded that the marks\r\nof approbation in these books were ironical, and she thought no more\r\nof the matter; for Lady Delacour suddenly gave a new turn to the\r\nconversation by exclaiming, "Now we talk of the height of human\r\nabsurdity, what are we to think of Clarence Hervey?"\r\n\r\n"Why should we think of him at all?" said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"For two excellent reasons, my dear: because we cannot help it, and\r\nbecause he deserves it. Yes, he deserves it, believe me, if it were only\r\nfor having written these charming letters," said Lady Delacour, opening\r\na cabinet, and taking out a small packet of letters, which she put\r\ninto Belinda\'s hands. "Pray, read them; you will find them amazingly\r\nedifying, as well as entertaining. I protest I am only puzzled to\r\nknow whether I shall bind them up with Sterne\'s Sentimental Journey\r\nor Fordyce\'s Sermons for Young Women. Here, my love, if you like\r\ndescription," continued her ladyship, opening one of the letters,\r\n"here is a Radcliffean tour along the picturesque coasts of Dorset and\r\nDevonshire. Why he went this tour, unless for the pleasure and glory of\r\ndescribing it, Heaven knows! Clouds and darkness rest over the tourist\'s\r\nprivate history: but this, of course, renders his letters more _piquant_\r\nand interesting. All who have a just taste either for literature or for\r\ngallantry, know how much we are indebted to the obscure for the sublime;\r\nand orators and lovers feel what felicity there is in the use of the\r\nfine figure of suspension."\r\n\r\n"Very good description, indeed!" said Belinda, without raising her eyes\r\nfrom the letter, or seeming to pay any attention to the latter part of\r\nLady Delacour\'s speech; "very good description, certainly!"\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear; but here is something better than _pure\r\ndescription_--here is sense for you: and pray mark the politeness of\r\naddressing sense to a woman--to a woman of sense, I mean--and which\r\nof us is not? Then here is sentiment for you," continued her ladyship,\r\nspreading another letter before Belinda; "a story of a Dorsetshire lady,\r\nwho had the misfortune to be married to a man as _unlike_ Mr. Percival,\r\nand as like Lord Delacour, as possible; and yet, oh, wonderful! they\r\nmake as happy a couple as one\'s heart could wish. Now, I am truly candid\r\nand good-natured to admire this letter; for every word of it is a lesson\r\nto me, and evidently was so intended. But I take it all in good part,\r\nbecause, to do Clarence justice, he describes the joys of domestic\r\nParadise in such elegant language, that he does not make me sick. In\r\nshort, my dear Belinda, to finish my panegyric, as it has been said of\r\nsome other epistles, if ever there were letters calculated to make you\r\nfall in love with the writer of them, these are they."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Miss Portman, folding up the letter which she was just\r\ngoing to read, "I will not run the hazard of reading them."\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear," said Lady Delacour, with a look of mingled concern,\r\nreproach, and raillery, "have you actually given up my poor Clarence,\r\nmerely on account of this mistress in the wood, this Virginia St.\r\nPierre? Nonsense! Begging your pardon, my dear, the man loves you. Some\r\nentanglement, some punctilio, some doubt, some delicacy, some folly,\r\nprevents him from being just at this moment, where, I confess, he ought\r\nto be--at your feet; and you, out of patience, which a young lady ought\r\nnever to be if she can help it, will go and marry--I know you will--some\r\nstick of a rival, purely to provoke him."\r\n\r\n"If ever I marry," said Belinda, with a look of proud humility, "I shall\r\ncertainly marry to please myself, and not to provoke any body else; and,\r\nat all events, I hope I shall never marry _a stick_."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me that word," said Lady Delacour. "I am convinced you never\r\nwill--but one is apt to judge of others by one\'s self. I am willing to\r\nbelieve that Mr. Vincent----"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent! How did you know----" exclaimed Belinda.\r\n\r\n"How did I know? Why, my dear, do you think I am so little interested\r\nabout you, that I have not found out some of your secrets? And do\r\nyou think that Marriott could refrain from telling me, in her most\r\ntriumphant tone, that \'Miss Portman has not gone to Oakly-park for\r\nnothing; that she has made a conquest of a Mr. Vincent, a West Indian, a\r\nward, or lately a ward, of Mr. Percival\'s, the handsomest man that ever\r\nwas seen, and the richest, &c. &c. &c.?\' Now simple I rejoiced at the\r\nnews; for I took it for granted you would never seriously think of\r\nmarrying the man."\r\n\r\n"Then why did your ladyship rejoice?"\r\n\r\n"Why? Oh, you novice at Cupid\'s chess-board! do not you see the next\r\nmove? Check with your new knight, and the game is your own. Now, if your\r\naunt Stanhope saw your look at this instant, she would give you up for\r\never--if she have not done that already. In plain, unmetaphorical prose,\r\nthen, cannot you comprehend, my straight-forward Belinda, that if you\r\nmake Clarence Hervey heartily jealous, let the impediments to your union\r\nbe what they may, he will acknowledge himself to be heartily in love\r\nwith you? I should make no scruple of frightening him within an inch of\r\nhis life, for his good. Sir Philip Baddely was not the man to frighten\r\nhim; but this Mr. Vincent, by all accounts, is just the thing."\r\n\r\n"And do you imagine that I could use Mr. Vincent so ill?--And can you\r\nthink me capable of such double dealing?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! in love and war, you know, all stratagems are allowable. But\r\nyou take the matter so seriously, and you redden with such virtuous\r\nindignation, that I dare not say a word more--only--may I ask--are you\r\nabsolutely engaged to Mr. Vincent?"\r\n\r\n"No. We have had the prudence to avoid all promises, all engagements."\r\n\r\n"There\'s my good girl!" cried Lady Delacour, kissing her: "all may yet\r\nturn out well. Read those letters--take them to your room, read them,\r\nread them; and depend upon it, my dearest Belinda! you are not the\r\nsort of woman that will, that can be happy, if you make a mere match\r\nof convenience. Forgive me--I love you too well not to speak the truth,\r\nthough it may offend for a moment."\r\n\r\n"You do not offend, but you misunderstand me," said Belinda. "Have\r\npatience with me, and you shall find that I am incapable of making a\r\nmere match of convenience."\r\n\r\nThen Miss Portman gave Lady Delacour a simple but full account of all\r\nthat had passed at Oakly-park relative to Mr. Vincent. She repeated the\r\narguments by which Lady Anne Percival had first prevailed upon her to\r\nadmit of Mr. Vincent\'s addresses. She said, that she had been convinced\r\nby Mr. Percival, that the omnipotence of a _first love_ was an idea\r\nfounded in error, and realized only in romance; and that to believe that\r\nnone could be happy in marriage, except with the first object of their\r\nfancy or their affections, would be an error pernicious to individuals\r\nand to society. When she detailed the arguments used by Mr. Percival on\r\nthis subject, Lady Delacour sighed, and observed that Mr. Percival was\r\ncertainly right, judging from _his own experience_, to declaim against\r\nthe folly of _first loves_; "and for the same reason," added she,\r\n"perhaps I may be pardoned if I retain some prejudice in their favour."\r\nShe turned aside her head to hide a starting tear, and here the\r\nconversation dropped. Belinda, recollecting the circumstances of her\r\nladyship\'s early history, reproached herself for having touched on this\r\ntender subject, yet at the same time she felt with increased force, at\r\nthis moment, the justice of Mr. Percival\'s observations; for, evidently,\r\nthe hold which this prejudice had kept in Lady Delacour\'s mind had\r\nmaterially injured her happiness, by making her neglect, after her\r\nmarriage, all the means of content that were in her reach. Her incessant\r\ncomparisons between her _first love_ and her husband excited perpetual\r\ncontempt and disgust in her mind for her wedded lord, and for many years\r\nprecluded all perception of his good qualities, all desire to live with\r\nhim upon good terms, and all idea of securing that share of domestic\r\nhappiness that was actually in her power. Belinda resolved at some\r\nfuture moment, whenever she could, with propriety and with effect, to\r\nsuggest these reflections to Lady Delacour, and in the mean time she\r\nwas determined to turn them to her own advantage. She perceived that\r\nshe should have need of all her steadiness to preserve her judgment\r\nunbiassed by her ladyship\'s wit and persuasive eloquence on the one\r\nhand, and on the other by her own high opinion of Lady Anne Percival\'s\r\njudgment, and the anxious desire she felt to secure her approbation. The\r\nletters from Clarence Hervey she read at night, when she retired to her\r\nown room; and they certainly raised not only Belinda\'s opinion of his\r\ntalents, but her esteem for his character. She saw that he had,\r\nwith great address, made use of the influence he possessed over Lady\r\nDelacour, to turn her mind to every thing that could make her amiable,\r\nestimable, and happy--she saw that Clarence, so far from attempting, for\r\nthe sake of his own vanity, to retain his pre-eminence in her ladyship\'s\r\nimagination, used on the contrary "his utmost skill" to turn the tide\r\nof her affections toward her husband and her daughter. In one of his\r\nletters, and but in one, he mentioned Belinda. He expressed great regret\r\nin hearing from Lady Delacour that her friend, Miss Portman, was\r\nno longer with her. He expatiated on the inestimable advantages and\r\nhappiness of having such a friend--but this referred to Lady Delacour,\r\nnot to himself. There was an air of much respect and some embarrassment\r\nin all he said of Belinda, but nothing like love. A few words at the end\r\nof this paragraph were cautiously obliterated, however; and, without\r\nany obvious link of connexion, the writer began a new sentence with a\r\ngeneral reflection upon the folly and imprudence of forming romantic\r\nprojects. Then he enumerated some of the various schemes he had formed\r\nin his early youth, and humorously recounted how they had failed, or how\r\nthey had been abandoned. Afterward, changing his tone from playful wit\r\nto serious philosophy, he observed the changes which these experiments\r\nhad made in his own character.\r\n\r\n"My friend, Dr. X----," said he, "divides mankind into three classes:\r\nthose who learn from the experience of others--they are happy men; those\r\nwho learn from their own experience--they are wise men; and, lastly,\r\nthose who learn neither from their own nor from other people\'s\r\nexperience--they are fools. This class is by far the largest. I am\r\ncontent," continued Clarence, "to be in the middle class--perhaps you\r\nwill say because I cannot be in the first: however, were it in my power\r\nto choose my own character, I should, forgive me the seeming vanity of\r\nthe speech, still be content to remain in my present station upon\r\nthis principle--the characters of those who are taught by their own\r\nexperience must be progressive in knowledge and virtue. Those who learn\r\nfrom the experience of others may become stationary, because they must\r\ndepend for their progress on the experiments that we brave volunteers,\r\nat whose expense they are to live and learn, are pleased to try. There\r\nmay be much safety in thus snugly fighting, or rather seeing the battle\r\nof life, behind the broad shield of a stouter warrior; yet it seems to\r\nme to be rather an ignominious than an enviable situation.\r\n\r\n"Our friend, Dr. X----, would laugh at my insisting upon being amongst\r\nthe class of learners by their own experience. He would ask me, whether\r\nit be the ultimate end of my philosophy to try experiments, or to be\r\nhappy. And what answer should I make? I have none ready. Common sense\r\nstares me in the face, and my feelings, even at this instant, alas!\r\nconfute my system. I shall pay too dear yet for some of my experiments.\r\n\'Sois grand homme, et sois malheureux,\' is, I am afraid, the law of\r\nnature, or rather the decree of the world. Your ladyship will not read\r\nthis without a smile; for you will immediately infer, that I think\r\nmyself a great man; and as I detest hypocrisy yet more than vanity,\r\nI shall not deny the charge. At all events, I feel that I am at\r\npresent--however gaily I talk of it--in as fair a way to be unhappy for\r\nlife, as if I were, in good earnest, the greatest man in Europe.\r\n\r\n"Your ladyship\'s most respectful admirer, and sincere friend,\r\n\r\n"CLARENCE HERVEY."\r\n\r\n\r\n"P. S.--Is there any hope that your friend, Miss Portman, may spend the\r\nwinter in town?"\r\n\r\nThough Lady Delacour had been much fatigued by the exertion of her\r\nspirits during the day, she sat up at night to write to Mr. Hervey. Her\r\nlove and gratitude to Miss Portman interested her most warmly for her\r\nhappiness, and she was persuaded that the most effectual way to secure\r\nit would be to promote her union with her _first love_. Lady Delacour,\r\nwho had also the best opinion of Clarence Hervey, and the most sincere\r\nfriendship for him, thought she was likewise acting highly for his\r\ninterest; and she felt that she had some merit in at once parting with\r\nhim from the train of her admirers, and urging him to become a dull,\r\nmarried man. Besides these generous motives, she was, perhaps, a little\r\ninfluenced by jealousy of the superior power which Lady Anne Percival\r\nhad in so short a time acquired over Belinda\'s mind. "Strange," thought\r\nshe, "if love and I be not a match for Lady Anne Percival and reason!"\r\nTo do Lady Delacour justice, it must be observed, that she took the\r\nutmost care in her letter not to _commit_ her friend; she wrote with all\r\nthe delicate address of which she was mistress. She began by rallying\r\nher correspondent on his indulging himself so charmingly in _the\r\nmelancholy of genius_; and she prescribed as a cure to her _malheureux\r\nimaginaire_, as she called him, those joys of domestic life which he so\r\nwell knew how to paint.\r\n\r\n"_Precepte commence, exemple acheve_," said her ladyship. "You will\r\nnever see me _la femme comme il y en a peu_, till I see you _le bon\r\nmari_. Belinda Portman has this day returned to me from Oakly-park,\r\nfresh, blooming, wise, and gay, as country air, flattery, philosophy,\r\nand love can make her. It seems that she has had full employment for\r\nher head and heart. Mr. Percival and Lady Anne, by right of science\r\nand reason, have taken possession of the head, and a Mr. Vincent, their\r\nci-devant ward and declared favourite, has laid close siege to the\r\nheart, of which he is in a fair way, I think, to take possession, by the\r\nright of conquest. As far as I can understand--for I have not yet seen\r\n_le futur_--he deserves my Belinda; for besides being as handsome as any\r\nhero of romance, ancient or modern, he has a soul in which neither\r\nspot nor blemish can be found, except the amiable weakness of being\r\ndesperately in love--a weakness which we ladies are apt to prefer to the\r\nmost philosophic stoicism: apropos of philosophy--we may presume,\r\nthat notwithstanding Mr. V---- is a creole, he has been bred up by his\r\nguardian in the class of men who learn by the experience of others. As\r\nsuch, according to your system, he has a right to expect to be a _happy\r\nman_, has not he? According to Mrs. Stanhope\'s system, I am sure that he\r\nhas: for his thousands and tens of thousands, as I am credibly informed,\r\npass the comprehension of the numeration table.\r\n\r\n"But these will weigh not a grain in the estimation of her truly\r\ndisinterested and noble-minded niece. Mrs. Stanhope knows nothing of\r\nMr. Vincent\'s proposals; and it is well for him she does not, for her\r\nworldly good word would mar the whole. Not so as to Lady Anne and Mr.\r\nPercival\'s approbation--their opinion is all in all with my friend. How\r\nthey have contrived it, I know not, but they have gained over Belinda\'s\r\nmind a degree of power almost equal to parental authority; so you may\r\nguess that the doubtful beam will not much longer nod from side to\r\nside: indeed it seems to me scarcely necessary to throw in the sword of\r\nauthority to turn the scale.\r\n\r\n"If you can persuade yourself to finish your picturesque tour before the\r\nides of the charming month of November, do, my dear Clarence! make haste\r\nand come back to us in time for Belinda\'s wedding--and do not forget my\r\ncommission about the Dorsetshire angel; bring me one in your right hand\r\nwith a gold ring upon her taper finger--so help you, Cupid! or never\r\nmore expect a smile\r\n\r\n"From your sincere friend and admirer,\r\n\r\n"T.C.H. DELACOUR."\r\n\r\n"P.S. Observe, my good sir, that I am not in such a desperate hurry to\r\ncongratulate you on your marriage, that I should be satisfied with an\r\nordinary Mrs. Hervey: so do not, under pretence of obliging me, or for\r\nany other consideration, yoke yourself to some damsel that you will be\r\nashamed to produce. For one woman worthy to be Clarence Hervey\'s wife, I\r\nhave seen, at a moderate computation, a hundred fit to be his mistress.\r\nIf he should, on this subject, mistake the _fitness of things or of\r\npersons_, he would indeed be _in a fair way to be unhappy for life_.\r\n\r\n"The substance of a lady\'s letter, it has been said, always is comprised\r\nin the postscript."\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Lady Delacour had finished this letter, which she had no doubt\r\nwould bring Clarence immediately to town, she left it with Marriott,\r\nwith orders to have it sent by the next post. Much fatigued, she then\r\nretired to rest, and was not visible the next day till near dinner-time.\r\nWhen Miss Portman returned the packet of Mr. Hervey\'s letters,\r\nher ladyship was dissatisfied with the measured terms of Belinda\'s\r\napprobation, and she said, with a sarcastic smile, "So, they have made a\r\ncomplete philosopher of you at Oakly-park! You are perfect in the first\r\nlesson--not to admire. And is the torch of Cupid to be extinguished on\r\nthe altar of Reason?"\r\n\r\n"Rather to be lighted there, if possible," said Belinda; and she\r\nendeavoured to turn the conversation to what she thought must be more\r\nimmediately interesting to Lady Delacour--her own health. She assured\r\nher, with perfect truth, that she was at present more intent upon her\r\nsituation than upon Cupid or his torch.\r\n\r\n"I believe you, my generous Belinda!" said Lady Delacour; "and for that\r\nvery reason I am interested in your affairs, I am afraid, even to the\r\nverge of impertinence. May I ask why this _preux chevalier_ of yours did\r\nnot attend you, or follow you to town?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent?--He knew that I came to attend your ladyship. I told him\r\nthat you had been confined by a nervous fever, and that it would be\r\nimpossible for me to see him at present; but I promised, when you could\r\nspare me, to return to Oakly-park."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour sighed, and opened Clarence Hervey\'s letters one after\r\nanother, looking over them without seeming well to know what she was\r\nabout. Lord Delacour came into the room whilst these letters were still\r\nin her hand. He had been absent since the preceding morning, and he now\r\nseemed as if he were just come home, much fatigued. He began in a tone\r\nof great anxiety to inquire after Lady Delacour\'s health. She was piqued\r\nat his having left home at such a time, and, merely bowing her head to\r\nhim, she went on reading. His eyes glanced upon the letters which she\r\nheld in her hand; and when he saw the well-known writing of Clarence\r\nHervey, his manner immediately altered, and, stammering out some\r\ncommon-place phrases, he threw himself into an arm-chair by the\r\nfireside, protesting that he was tired to death--that he was half\r\ndead--that he had been in a post-chaise for three hours, which he\r\nhated--had ridden fifty miles since yesterday; and he muttered that he\r\nwas a fool for his pains--an observation which, though it reached her\r\nladyship\'s ears, she did not think proper to contradict.\r\n\r\nHis lordship had then recourse to his watch, his never-failing friend\r\nin need, which he always pulled out with a particular jerk when he was\r\nvexed.\r\n\r\n"It is time for me to be gone--I shall be late at Studley\'s."\r\n\r\n"You dine with his lordship then?" said Lady Delacour, in a careless\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and his good burgundy, I hope, will wind me up again," said he,\r\nstretching himself, "for I am quite down."\r\n\r\n"Quite down? Then we may conclude that my friend Mrs. Luttridge is not\r\nyet come to _Rantipole_. Rantipole, my dear," continued Lady Delacour,\r\nturning to Miss Portman, "is the name of Harriot Freke\'s villa in Kent.\r\nHowever strange it may sound to your ears and mine, I can assure you\r\nthe name has _made fortune_ amongst a certain description of wits. And\r\ncandour must allow that, if not elegant, it is appropriate; it gives a\r\njust idea of the manners and way of life of the place, for every thing\r\nat Rantipole is rantipole. But I am really concerned, my lord, you\r\nshould have ridden yourself down in this way for nothing. Why did not\r\nyou get better intelligence before you set out? I am afraid you feel\r\nthe loss of Champfort. Why did not you contrive to learn for certain, my\r\ndear good lord, whether _the Luttridge_ was at Rantipole, before you set\r\nout on this wild goose chase?"\r\n\r\n"My dear good lady," replied Lord Delacour, assuming a degree of spirit\r\nwhich startled her as much as it became him, "why do you not get better\r\nintelligence before you suspect me of being a brute and a liar? Did not\r\nI promise you yesterday, that I would break with _the Luttridge_, as you\r\ncall her? and how could you imagine that the instant afterwards, just\r\nat the time I was wrung to the soul, as you know I was--how could you\r\nimagine I would leave you to go to Rantipole, or to any woman upon\r\nearth?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my lord! I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon a thousand times,"\r\ncried Lady Delacour, rising with much emotion; and, going towards him\r\nwith a sudden impulse, she kissed his forehead.\r\n\r\n"And so you ought to beg my pardon," said Lord Delacour, in a faltering\r\nvoice, but without moving his posture.\r\n\r\n"You will acknowledge you left me, however, my lord? That is clear."\r\n\r\n"Left you! Yes, so I did; to ride all over the country in search of a\r\nhouse that would suit you. For what else did you think I _could_ leave\r\nyou at such a time as this?"\r\n\r\nLady Delacour again stooped, and leaned her arm upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"I wish to Heaven, my dear," said his lordship, shrinking as he put away\r\nher hand, which still held Clarence Hervey\'s letters, "I wish to Heaven,\r\nmy dear, you would not hold those abominable perfumed papers just under\r\nmy very nose. You know I cannot stand perfumes."\r\n\r\n"Are they perfumed? Ay; so every thing is that I keep in that cabinet\r\nof curiosities. Thank you, my dear Miss Portman," said her ladyship,\r\nas Belinda rose to take the letters from her hand. "Will you have the\r\ngoodness to put them back into their cabinet, if you can endure to touch\r\nthem, if the perfume has not overcome you as well as my lord? After all,\r\nit is only ottar of roses, to which few people\'s olfactory nerves have\r\nan antipathy."\r\n\r\n"I have the honour to be one of the few," said his lordship, rising\r\nfrom his seat with so sudden a motion as to displace Lady Delacour\'s arm\r\nwhich leaned upon him. "For my part," continued he, taking down one\r\nof the Argand lamps from the chimney-piece, and trimming it, "I would\r\nrather a hundred to one snuff up the oil of this cursed lamp."\r\n\r\nWhilst his lordship applied himself to trimming the lamp with great\r\nearnestness, Lady Delacour negligently walked away to the farthest\r\nend of the room, where stood the cabinet, which Belinda was trying to\r\nunlock.\r\n\r\n"Stay, my love; it has a secret lock, which I alone can manage."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear Lady Delacour!" whispered Belinda, holding her hand as\r\nshe gave her the key, "I never can love or esteem you if you use Lord\r\nDelacour ill now."\r\n\r\n"Ill now? ill now? This lock is spoilt, I do believe," said she aloud.\r\n\r\n"Nay, you understand me, Lady Delacour! You see what is passing in his\r\nmind."\r\n\r\n"To be sure: I am not a fool, though he is. I see he is jealous, though\r\nhe has had such _damning proof_ that all\'s right--the man\'s a fool,\r\nthat\'s all. Are you sure this is the key I gave you, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"And can you think him a fool," pursued Belinda, in a still more earnest\r\nwhisper, "for being more jealous of your mind than of your person? Fools\r\nhave seldom so much penetration, or so much delicacy."\r\n\r\n"But, Lord! what would you have me do? what would you have me say? That\r\nLord Delacour writes better letters than these?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! but show him these letters, and you will do justice to him, to\r\nyourself, to Cla----, to every body."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I should be happy to do justice to _every body_."\r\n\r\n"Then pray do this very instant, my dearest Lady Delacour! and I shall\r\nlove you for it all my life."\r\n\r\n"Done!--for who can withstand that offer?--Done!" said her ladyship.\r\nThen turning to Lord Delacour, "My lord, will you come here and tell us\r\nwhat can be the matter with this lock?"\r\n\r\n"If the lock be spoiled, Lady Delacour, you had better send for a\r\nlocksmith," replied his lordship, who was still employed about the\r\nwick of the Argand: "I am no locksmith--I do not pretend to understand\r\nlocks--especially secret locks."\r\n\r\n"But you will not desert us at our utmost need, I am sure, my lord,"\r\nsaid Belinda, approaching him with a conciliatory smile.\r\n\r\n"You want the light, I believe, more than I do," said his lordship,\r\nadvancing with the lamp to meet her. "Well! what is the matter with this\r\nconfounded lock of yours, Lady Delacour? I know I should be at Studley\'s\r\nby this time--but how in the devil\'s name can you expect me to open a\r\nsecret lock when I do not know the secret, Lady Delacour?"\r\n\r\n"Then I will tell you the secret, Lord Delacour--that there is no secret\r\nat all in the lock, or in the letters. Here, if you can stand the odious\r\nsmell of ottar of roses, take these letters and read them, foolish man;\r\nand keep them till the shocking perfume is gone off."\r\n\r\nLord Delacour could scarcely believe his senses; he looked in Lady\r\nDelacour\'s eyes to see whether he had understood her rightly.\r\n\r\n"But I am afraid," said she, smiling, "that you will find the perfume\r\ntoo overcoming."\r\n\r\n"Not half so overcoming," cried he, seizing her hand, and kissing it\r\noften with eager tenderness, "not half so overcoming as this confidence,\r\nthis kindness, this condescension from you."\r\n\r\n"Miss Portman will think us both a couple of old fools," said her\r\nladyship, making a slight effort to withdraw her hand. "But she is\r\nalmost as great a simpleton herself, I think," continued she, observing\r\nthat the tears stood in Belinda\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"My lord," said a footman who came in at this instant, "do you dress?\r\nThe carriage is at the door, as you ordered, to go to Lord Studley\'s."\r\n\r\n"I\'d see Lord Studley at the devil, sir, and his burgundy along with\r\nhim, before I\'d go to him to-day; and you may tell him so, if you\r\nplease," cried Lord Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Very well, my lord," said the footman.\r\n\r\n"My lord dines at home--they may put up the carriage--that\'s all," said\r\nLady Delacour: "only let us have dinner directly," added she, as the\r\nservant shut the door. "Miss Portman will be famished amongst us: there\r\nis no living upon sentiment."\r\n\r\n"And there is no living with such belles without being something more of\r\na beau," said Lord Delacour, looking at his splashed boots. "I will\r\nbe ready for dinner before dinner is ready for me." With activity very\r\nunusual to him, he hurried out of the room to change his dress.\r\n\r\n"O day of wonders!" exclaimed Lady Delacour. "And, O night of wonders!\r\nif we can get him through the evening without the help of Lord Studley\'s\r\nwine. You must give us some music, my good Belinda, and make him\r\naccompany you with his flute. I can tell you he has really a very pretty\r\ntaste for music, and knows fifty times more of the matter than half\r\nthe dilettanti, who squeeze the human face divine into all manner of\r\nridiculous shapes, by way of persuading you that they are in ecstasy!\r\nAnd, my dear, do not forget to show us the charming little portfolio of\r\ndrawings that you have brought from Oakly-park. Lord Delacour was with\r\nme at Harrowgate in the days of his courtship: he knows the charming\r\nviews that you have been taking about Knaresborough and Fountain\'s\r\nAbbey, and all those places. I will answer for it, he remembers them\r\na hundred times better than I do. And, my love, I assure you he is a\r\nbetter judge of drawing than many whom we saw ogling Venus rising from\r\nthe sea, in the Orleans gallery. Lord Delacour has let his talents go to\r\nsleep in a shameless manner; but really he has talents, if they could be\r\nwakened. By-the-by, pray make him tell you the story of Lord Studley\'s\r\noriginal Titian: he tells that story with real humour. Perhaps you have\r\nnot found it out, but Lord Delacour has a vast deal of drollery in his\r\nown way, and----"\r\n\r\n"Dinner\'s ready, my lady!"\r\n\r\n"That is a pity!" whispered Lady Delacour; "for if they had let me go\r\non in my present humour, I should have found out that my lord has every\r\naccomplishment under the sun, and every requisite under the moon, to\r\nmake the marriage state happy."\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of Belinda\'s portfolio and her harp, and the\r\ngood-humour and sprightliness of Lady Delacour\'s wit, his lordship\r\ngot through the evening much to his own satisfaction. He played on the\r\nflute, he told the story of Studley\'s original Titian, and he detected a\r\nfault that had escaped Mr. Percival in the perspective of Miss Portman\'s\r\nsketch of Fountain\'s Abbey. The perception that his talents were _called\r\nout_, and that he appeared to unusual advantage, made him _excellent\r\ncompany_: he found that the spirits can be raised by self-complacency\r\neven more agreeably than by burgundy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst they were at breakfast the next morning in Lady Delacour\'s\r\ndressing-room, Marriott knocked at the door, and immediately opening\r\nit, exclaimed in a joyful tone, "Miss Portman, they\'re eating it! Ma\'am,\r\nthey\'re eating it as fast as ever they can!"\r\n\r\n"Bring them in; your lady will give you leave, Marriott, I fancy," said\r\nMiss Portman. Marriott brought in her gold fishes; some green leaves\r\nwere floating on the top of the water in the glass globe.\r\n\r\n"See, my lady," said she, "what Miss Portman has been so good as to\r\nbring from Oakly-park for my poor gold fishes, who, I am sure, ought\r\nto be much obliged to her, as well as myself." Marriott set the globe\r\nbeside her lady, and retired.\r\n\r\n"From Oakly-park! And by what name impossible to pronounce must I call\r\nthese green leaves, to please botanic ears?" said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"This," replied Belinda, "is what\r\n\r\n    \'Th\'unlearned, duckweed--learned, lemna, call;\r\n\r\nand it is to be found in any ditch or standing pool."\r\n\r\n"And what possessed you, my dear, for the sake of Marriott and her gold\r\nfishes, to trouble yourself to bring such stuff a hundred and seventy\r\nmiles?"\r\n\r\n"To oblige little Charles Percival," said Miss Portman. "He was anxious\r\nto keep his promise of sending it to your Helena. She found out in some\r\nbook that she was reading with him last summer, that gold fishes are\r\nfond of this plant; and I wish," added Belinda, in a timid voice, "that\r\nshe were here at this instant to see them eat it."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour was silent for some minutes, and kept her eye steadily\r\nupon the gold fishes. At length she said, "I never shall forget how\r\nwell the poor little creature behaved about those gold fishes. I\r\ngrew amazingly fond of her whilst she was with me. But you know,\r\ncircumstanced as I was, after you left me, I could not have her at\r\nhome."\r\n\r\n"But now I am here," said Belinda, "will she he any trouble to you? And\r\nwill she not make your home more agreeable to you, and to Lord Delacour,\r\nwho was evidently very fond of her?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear!" said Lady Delacour, "you forget, and so do I at times,\r\nwhat I have to go through. It is in vain to talk, to think of making\r\nhome, or any place, or any thing, or any person, agreeable to me now.\r\nWhat am I? The outside rind is left--the sap is gone. The tree lasts\r\nfrom day to day by miracle--it cannot last long. You would not wonder to\r\nhear me talk in this way, if you knew the terrible time I had last night\r\nafter we parted. But I have these nights constantly now. Let us talk of\r\nsomething else. What have you there--a manuscript?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a little journal of Edward Percival\'s, which he sent for the\r\nentertainment of Helena."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour stretched out her hand for it. "The boy will write as like\r\nhis father as possible," said she, turning over the leaves. "I wish\r\nto have this poor girl with me--but I have no spirits. And you know,\r\nwhenever Lord Delacour can find a house that will suit us, we shall\r\nleave town, and I could not take Helena with me. But this may be the\r\nlast opportunity I may ever have of seeing her; and I _can_ refuse you\r\nnothing, my dear. So will you go for her? She can stay with us a few\r\ndays. Lady Boucher, that most convenient dowager, who likes going about,\r\nno matter where, all the morning, will go with you to Mrs. Dumont\'s\r\nacademy in Sloane-street. I would as soon go to a bird-fancier\'s as to a\r\nboarding-school for young ladies: indeed, I am not well enough to go\r\nany where. So I will throw myself upon a sofa, and read this child\'s\r\njournal. I wonder how that or any thing else can interest me now."\r\n\r\nBelinda, who had been used to the variations of Lady Delacour\'s spirits,\r\nwas not much alarmed by the despondent strain in which she now spoke,\r\nespecially when she considered that the thoughts of the dreadful trial\r\nthis unfortunate woman was soon to go through must naturally depress\r\nher courage. Rejoiced at the permission that she had obtained to go for\r\nHelena, Miss Portman sent immediately to Lady Boucher, who took her to\r\nSloane-street.\r\n\r\n"Now, my dear, considerate Miss Portman," said Lady Boucher, "I must\r\nbeg, and request that you will hurry Miss Delacour into the carriage\r\nas fast as possible. I have not a moment to spare; for I am to be at a\r\nchina auction at two, that I would not miss for the whole world. Well,\r\nwhat\'s the matter with the people? Why does not James knock at the door?\r\nCan\'t the man read? Can\'t the man see?" cried the purblind dowager. "Is\r\nnot that Mrs. Dumont\'s name on the door before his eyes?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, I believe this name is Ellicot," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Ellicot, is it? Ay, true. But what\'s the man stopping for, then? Mrs.\r\nDumont\'s is the next door, tell the blind dunce. Mercy on us! To waste\r\none\'s time in this way! I shall, as sure as fate, be too late for the\r\nchina auction. What upon earth stops us?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but a little covered cart, which stands at Mrs. Dumont\'s door.\r\nThere, now it is going; an old man is drawing it out of the way as fast\r\nas he can."\r\n\r\n"Open the coach-door, James!" cried Lady Boucher the moment that they\r\nhad drawn up. "Now, my dear, considerate Miss Portman, remember the\r\nauction, and don\'t let Miss Delacour stay to change her dress or any\r\nthing."\r\n\r\nBelinda promised not to detain her ladyship a minute. The door at Mrs.\r\nDumont\'s was open, and a servant was assisting an old man to carry in\r\nsome geraniums and balsams out of the covered cart which had stopped the\r\nway. In the hall a crowd of children were gathered round a high stand,\r\non which they were eagerly arranging their flower-pots; and the busy hum\r\nof voices was so loud, that when Miss Portman first went in, she could\r\nneither hear the servant, nor make him hear her name. Nothing was to be\r\nheard but "Oh, how beautiful! Oh, how sweet! That\'s mine! That\'s yours!\r\nThe great rose geranium for Miss Jefferson! The white Provence rose for\r\nMiss Adderly! No, indeed, Miss Pococke, that\'s for Miss Delacour; the\r\nold man said so."\r\n\r\n"_Silence, silence, mesdemoiselles!_" cried the voice of a French woman,\r\nand all was silence. The little crowd looked towards the hall door;\r\nand from the midst of her companions, Helena Delacour, who now caught\r\na glimpse of Belinda, sprang forward, throwing down her white Provence\r\nrose as she passed.\r\n\r\n"Lady Boucher\'s compliments, ma\'am," said the servant to Mrs. Dumont;\r\n"she\'s in indispensable haste, and she begs you won\'t let Miss Delacour\r\nthink of changing her dress."\r\n\r\nIt was the last thing of which Miss Delacour was likely to think at this\r\ninstant. She was so much overjoyed, when she heard that Belinda was come\r\nby her mamma\'s desire to take her home, that she would scarcely stay\r\nwhilst Mrs. Dumont was tying on her straw hat, and exhorting her to let\r\nLady Delacour know how it happened that she was "so far from fit to be\r\nseen."\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am; yes, ma\'am, I\'ll remember; I\'ll be sure to remember," said\r\nHelena, tripping down the steps. But just as she was getting into the\r\ncarriage she stopped at the sight of the old man, and exclaimed, "Oh,\r\ngood old man! I must not forget you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, you must, though, my dear Miss Delacour," said Lady\r\nBoucher, pulling her into the carriage: "\'tis no time to think of good\r\nold men now."\r\n\r\n"But I must. Dear Miss Portman, will you speak for me? I must pay--I\r\nmust settle--and I have a great deal to say."\r\n\r\nMiss Portman desired the old man to call in Berkley-square at Lady\r\nDelacour\'s; and this satisfying all parties, they drove away.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived in Berkley-square, Marriott told them that her lady\r\nwas just gone to lie down. Edward Percival\'s little journal, which she\r\nhad been reading, was left on the sofa, and Belinda gave it to Helena,\r\nwho eagerly began to look over it.\r\n\r\n"Thirteen pages! Oh, how good he has been to write so much for me!" said\r\nshe; and she had almost finished reading it before her mother came into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour shrunk back as her daughter ran towards her; for she\r\nrecollected too well the agony she had once suffered from an embrace of\r\nHelena\'s. The little girl appeared more grieved than surprised at this;\r\nand after kissing her mother\'s hand, without speaking, she again looked\r\ndown at the manuscript.\r\n\r\n"Does that engross your attention so entirely, my dear," said Lady\r\nDelacour, "that you can neither spare one word nor one look for your\r\nmother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma! I only tried to read, because I thought you were angry with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"An odd reason for trying to read, my dear!" said Lady Delacour with a\r\nsmile: "have you any better reason for thinking I was angry with you?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, I know you are not angry now, for you smile," said Helena; "but\r\nI thought at first that you were, mamma, because you gave me only your\r\nhand to kiss."\r\n\r\n"Only my hand! The next time, simpleton, I\'ll give you only my foot\r\nto kiss," said her ladyship, sitting down, and holding out her foot\r\nplayfully.\r\n\r\nHer daughter threw aside the book, and kneeling down kissed her foot,\r\nsaying, in a low voice, "Dear mamma, I never was so happy in my life;\r\nfor you never looked so very, _very_ kindly at me before."\r\n\r\n"Do not judge always of the kindness people feel for you, child, by\r\ntheir looks; and remember that it is _possible_ a person might have felt\r\nmore than you could guess by their looks. Pray now, Helena, you are such\r\na good judge of physiognomy, should you guess that I was dying, by my\r\nlooks?"\r\n\r\nThe little girl laughed, and repeated "Dying? Oh, no, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! because I have such a fine colour in my cheeks, hey?"\r\n\r\n"Not for that reason, mamma," said Helena, withdrawing her eyes from her\r\nmother\'s face.\r\n\r\n"What, then you know rouge already when you see it?--You perceive some\r\ndifference, for instance, between Miss Portman\'s colour and mine? Upon\r\nmy word, you are a nice observer. Such nice observers are sometimes\r\ndangerous to have near one."\r\n\r\n"I hope, mother," said Helena, "that you do not think I would try to\r\nfind out any thing that you wish, or that I imagined you wished, I\r\nshould not know."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand you, child," cried Lady Delacour, raising herself\r\nsuddenly upon the sofa, and looking full in her daughter\'s face.\r\n\r\nHelena\'s colour rose to her temples; but, with a firmness that surprised\r\neven Belinda, she repeated what she had said nearly in the same words.\r\n\r\n"Do you understand her, Miss Portman?" said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"She expresses, I think," said Belinda, "a very honourable sentiment,\r\nand one that is easily understood."\r\n\r\n"Ay, in general, certainly," said Lady Delacour, checking herself; "but\r\nI thought that she meant to allude to something in particular--_that_\r\nwas what I did not understand. Undoubtedly, my dear, you have just\r\nexpressed a very honourable sentiment, and one that I should scarcely\r\nhave expected from a child of your age.\r\n\r\n"Helena, my dear," said her mother, after a silence of some minutes,\r\n"did you ever read the Arabian Tales?--\'Yes, mamma,\' I know must be the\r\nanswer. But do you remember the story of Zobeide, who carried the porter\r\nhome with her on condition that, let him hear or see what he might, he\r\nwould ask no questions?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma."\r\n\r\n"On the same conditions should you like to stay with me for a few days?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. On any conditions, mamma, I should like to stay with you."\r\n\r\n"Agreed, then, my dear!" said Lady Delacour. "Now let us go to the gold\r\nfishes, and see them eat lemna, or whatever you please to call it."\r\n\r\nWhile they were looking at the gold fishes, the old man, who had been\r\ndesired by Miss Portman to call, arrived. "Who is this fine, gray-haired\r\nold man?" said Lady Delacour. Helena, who did not know the share which\r\nBelinda\'s aunt and her own mother had in the transaction, began with\r\ngreat eagerness to tell the history of the poor gardener, who had been\r\ncheated by some fine ladies out of his aloe, &c. She then related how\r\nkind Lady Anne Percival and her Aunt Margaret had been to him; that\r\nthey had gotten him a place as a gardener at Twickenham; and that he\r\nhad pleased the family to whom he was recommended so much by his good\r\nbehaviour, that, as they were leaving their house, and obliged to part\r\nwith him, they had given him all the geraniums and balsams out of the\r\ngreen-house of which he had the care, and these he had been this day\r\nselling to the young ladies at Mrs. Dumont\'s. "I received the money for\r\nhim, and I was just going to pay him," said Helena, "when Miss Portman\r\ncame; and that put every thing else out of my head. May I go and give\r\nhim his money now, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"He can wait a few minutes," said Lady Delacour, who had listened to\r\nthis story with much embarrassment and impatience. "Before you go,\r\nHelena, favour us with the names of _the fine ladies who cheated_ this\r\nold gardener out of his aloe."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, mamma, I don\'t know their names."\r\n\r\n"No!--Did you never ask Lady Anne Percival, or your aunt Margaret?--Look\r\nin my face, child! Did they never inform you?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, never. I once asked Lady Anne, and she said that she did not\r\nchoose to tell me; that it would be of no use to me to know."\r\n\r\n"I give Lady Anne Percival more credit and more thanks for this," cried\r\nLady Delacour, "than for all the rest. I see she has not attempted to\r\nlower me in my child\'s opinion. I am the fine lady, Helena--I was\r\nthe cause of his being cheated--I was intent upon _the noble end_ of\r\noutshining a certain Mrs. Luttridge--the _noble means_ I left to others,\r\nand the means have proved worthy of the end. I deserve to be brought\r\nto shame for my folly; yet my being ashamed will do nobody any good but\r\nmyself. Restitution is in these cases the best proof of repentance. Go,\r\nHelena, my love! settle your little affairs with this old man, and bid\r\nhim call here again to-morrow. I will see what we can do for him."\r\n\r\nLord Delacour had this very morning sent home to her ladyship a handsome\r\ndiamond ring, which had been intended as a present for Mrs. Luttridge,\r\nand which he imagined would therefore be peculiarly acceptable to his\r\nlady. In the evening, when his lordship asked her how she liked the\r\nring, which he desired the jeweller to leave for her to look at it, she\r\nanswered, that it was a handsome ring, but that she hoped he had not\r\npurchased it for her.\r\n\r\n"It is not actually bought, my dear," said his lordship; "but if it\r\nsuits your fancy, I hope you will do me the honour to wear it for my\r\nsake."\r\n\r\n"I will wear it for your sake, my lord," said Lady Delacour, "if you\r\ndesire it; and as a mark of your regard it is agreeable: but as to the\r\nrest--\r\n\r\n    \'My taste for diamonds now is o\'er,\r\n    The sparkling baubles please no more.\'\r\n\r\nIf you wish to do me a kindness, I will tell you what I should like much\r\nbetter than diamonds, though I know it is rather ungracious to dictate\r\nthe form and fashion of a favour. But as my dictatorship in all human\r\nprobability cannot last much longer--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear Lady Delacour! I must not hear you talk in this manner:\r\nyour dictatorship, as you call it, will I hope last many, many happy\r\nyears. But to the point--what should you like better, my dear, than this\r\nfoolish ring?"\r\n\r\nHer ladyship then expressed her wish that a small annuity might be\r\nsettled upon a poor old man, whom she said she had unwittingly injured.\r\nShe told the story of the rival galas and the aloe, and concluded by\r\nobserving, that her lord was in some measure called upon to remedy\r\npart of the unnumbered ills which had sprung from her hatred of Mrs.\r\nLuttridge, as he had originally been the cause of her unextinguishable\r\nire. Lord Delacour was flattered by this hint, and the annuity was\r\nimmediately promised to the old gardener.\r\n\r\nIn talking to this old man afterward, Lady Delacour found, that the\r\nfamily in whose service he lately lived had a house at Twickenham that\r\nwould just answer her purpose. Lord Delacour\'s inquiries had hitherto\r\nbeen unsuccessful; he was rejoiced to find what he wanted just as he\r\nwas giving up the search. The house was taken, and the old man hired\r\nas gardener--a circumstance which seemed to give him almost as much\r\npleasure as the annuity; for there was a morello cherry-tree in the\r\ngarden which had succeeded the aloe in his affection: "it would have\r\ngrieved him sorely," he said, "to leave his favourite tree to strangers,\r\nafter all the pains he had been at _in netting_ it to keep off the\r\nbirds."\r\n\r\nAs the period approached when her fate was to be decided, Lady\r\nDelacour\'s courage seemed to rise; and at the same time her anxiety,\r\nthat her secret should not be discovered, appeared to increase.\r\n\r\n"If I survive _this business_," said she, "it is my firm intention to\r\nappear in a new character, or rather to assert my real character. I will\r\nbreak through the spell of dissipation--I will at once cast off all the\r\nacquaintance that are unworthy of me--I will, in one word, go with you,\r\nmy dear Belinda, to Mr. Percival\'s. I can bear to be mortified for my\r\ngood; and I am willing, since I find that Lady Anne Percival has behaved\r\ngenerously to me, with regard to Helena\'s affections, I am willing that\r\nthe recovery of my moral health should be attributed to the salubrious\r\nair of Oakly-park. But it would be inexpressible, intolerable\r\nmortification to me, to have it said or suspected in the world of\r\nfashion, that I retreated from the ranks disabled instead of disgusted.\r\nA voluntary retirement is graceful and dignified; a forced retreat is\r\nawkward and humiliating. You must be sensible that I could not endure to\r\nhave it whispered--\'Lady Delacour now sets up for being a prude, because\r\nshe can no longer be a coquette.\' Lady Delacour would become the subject\r\nof witticisms, epigrams, caricatures without end. It would just be the\r\nvery thing for Mrs. Luttridge; then she would revenge herself without\r\nmercy for _the ass and her panniers_. We should have \'Lord and Lady\r\nD----, or the Domestic Tete-a-tete,\' or \'The Reformed Amazon,\' stuck\r\nup in a print-shop window! Oh, my dear, think of seeing such a thing! I\r\nshould die with vexation; and of all deaths, that is the death I should\r\nlike the least."\r\n\r\nThough Belinda could not entirely enter into those feelings, which\r\nthus made Lady Delacour invent wit against herself, and anticipate\r\ncaricatures; yet she did every thing in her power to calm her ladyship\'s\r\napprehension of a discovery.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Lady Delacour, "I have perfect confidence in Lord\r\nDelacour\'s promise, and in his good-nature, of which he has within these\r\nfew days given me proofs that are not lost upon my heart; but he is not\r\nthe most discreet man in the world. Whenever he is anxious about any\r\nthing, you may read it a mile off in his eyes, nose, mouth, and chin.\r\nAnd to tell you all my fears in one word, Marriott informed me this\r\nmorning, that _the Luttridge_, who came from Harrowgate to Rantipole,\r\nto meet Lord Delacour, finding that there was no drawing him to her, has\r\nactually brought herself to town.\r\n\r\n"To town!--At this strange time of year! How will my lord resist this\r\nunequivocal, unprecedented proof of passion? If she catch hold of him\r\nagain, I am undone. Or, even suppose him firm as a rock, her surprise,\r\nher jealousy, her curiosity, will set all engines at work, to find out\r\nby what witchcraft I have taken my husband from her. Every precaution\r\nthat prudence could devise against her malicious curiosity I have taken.\r\nMarriott, you know, is above all temptation. That vile wretch (naming\r\nthe person whose quack medicines had nearly destroyed her), that vile\r\nwretch will be silent from fear, for his own sake. He is yet to be paid\r\nand dismissed. That should have been done long ago, but I had not money\r\nboth for him and Mrs. Franks the milliner. She is now paid: and Lord\r\nDelacour--I am glad to tell his friend how well he deserves her good\r\nopinion--Lord Delacour in the handsomest manner supplied me with the\r\nmeans of satisfying this man. He is to be here at three o\'clock to-day;\r\nand this is the last interview he will ever have with Lady Delacour in\r\n_the mysterious boudoir_."\r\n\r\nThe fears which her ladyship expressed of Mrs. Luttridge\'s malicious\r\ncuriosity were not totally without foundation. Champfort was at work for\r\nher and for himself. The memorable night of Lady Delacour\'s overturn,\r\nand the bustle that Marriott made about the key of the boudoir, were\r\nstill fresh in his memory; and he was in hopes that, if he could\r\ndiscover the mystery, he should at once regain his power over Lord\r\nDelacour, reinstate himself in his lucrative place, and obtain a\r\nhandsome reward, or, more properly speaking, bribe, from Mrs. Luttridge.\r\nThe means of obtaining information of all that passed in Lady Delacour\'s\r\nfamily were, he thought, still in his power, though he was no longer\r\nan inmate of the house. The _stupid maid_ was not so stupid as to be\r\nimpenetrable to the voice of flattery, or, as Mr. Champfort called\r\nit, the voice of love. He found it his interest to court, and she her\r\npleasure to be courted. On these "coquettes of the _second_ table,"\r\non these underplots in the drama, much of the comedy, and some of the\r\ntragedy, of life depend. Under the unsuspected mask of stupidity this\r\nworthy mistress of our intriguing valet-de-chambre concealed the quick\r\nears of a listener, and the demure eyes of a spy. Long, however, did she\r\nlisten, and long did she spy in vain, till at last Mr. Champfort gave\r\nher notice in writing that his love would not last another week, unless\r\nshe could within that time contrive to satisfy his curiosity; and that,\r\nin short, she _must_ find out the reason why the boudoir was always\r\nlocked, and why Mrs. Marriott alone was to be trusted with the key. Now\r\nit happened that this billet-doux was received on the very day appointed\r\nfor Lady Delacour\'s last interview with the quack surgeon in the\r\nmysterious boudoir. Marriott, as it was her custom upon such occasions,\r\nlet the surgeon in, and showed him up the back stairs into the boudoir,\r\nlocked the door, and bade him wait there till her lady came. The man had\r\nnot been punctual to the hour appointed; and Lady Delacour, giving up\r\nall expectation of his coming till the next day, had retired to her\r\nbedchamber, where she of late usually at this hour secluded herself to\r\nread methodistical books, or to sleep. Marriott, when she went up to\r\nlet her lady know that _the person_, as she always called him, was come,\r\nfound her so fast asleep that she thought it a pity to waken her, as she\r\nhad not slept at all the preceding night. She shut the door very softly,\r\nand left her lady to repose. At the bottom of the stairs she was met by\r\n_the stupid maid_, whom she immediately despatched with orders to wash\r\nsome lace: "Your lady\'s asleep," said she, "and pray let me have no\r\nrunning up and down stairs." The room into which the stupid maid went\r\nwas directly underneath the boudoir; and whilst she was there she\r\nthought that she heard the steps of a man\'s foot walking over head. She\r\nlistened more attentively--she heard them again. She armed herself\r\nwith a glass of jelly in her hand, _for my lady_, and hurried up stairs\r\ninstantly to _my lady\'s_ room. She was much surprised to see my lady\r\nfast asleep. Her astonishment at finding that Mrs. Marriott had told her\r\nthe truth was such, as for a moment to bereave her of all presence of\r\nmind, and she stood with the door ajar in her hand. As thus she stood\r\nshe was roused by the sound of some one clearing his throat very softly\r\nin the boudoir--_his_ throat; for she recollected the footsteps she\r\nhad heard before, and she was convinced it could be no other than a\r\nmasculine throat. She listened again, and stooped down to try whether\r\nany feet could be seen under the door. As she was in this attitude, her\r\nlady suddenly turned on her bed, and the book which she had been reading\r\nfell from the pillow to the floor with a noise, that made the listener\r\nstart up instantaneously in great terror. The noise, however, did not\r\nwaken Lady Delacour, who was in that dead sleep which is sometimes the\r\neffect of opium. The noise was louder than what could have been made by\r\nthe fall of a book alone, and the girl descried a key that had fallen\r\nalong with the book. It occurred to her that this might possibly be the\r\nkey of the boudoir. From one of those irresistible impulses which some\r\npeople make an excuse for doing whatever they please, she seized it,\r\nresolved at all hazards to open the mysterious door. She was cautiously\r\nputting the key into the key-hole, so as not to make the least noise,\r\nwhen she was suddenly startled by a voice behind her, which said, "Who\r\ngave you leave to open that door?"\r\n\r\nShe turned, and saw Helena standing at the half open bedchamber door.\r\n\r\n"Mercy, Miss Delacour! who thought of seeing you? For God\'s sake, don\'t\r\nmake a noise to waken my lady!"\r\n\r\n"Did my mother desire you to go into that room?" repeated Helena.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! no, miss," said the maid, putting on her stupid face; "but\r\nI only thought to open the door, to let in a little air to freshen the\r\nroom, which my lady always likes, and bids me to do--and I thought--"\r\n\r\nHelena took the key gently from her hand without listening to any more\r\nof her thoughts, and the woman left the room muttering something about\r\n_jelly_ and _my lady_, Helena went to the side of her mother\'s bed,\r\ndetermined to wait there till she awakened, then to give her the key,\r\nand tell her the circumstance. Notwithstanding the real simplicity of\r\nthis little girl\'s character, she was, as her mother had discovered, _a\r\nnice observer_, and she had remarked that her mother permitted no one\r\nbut Marriott to go into the boudoir. This remark did not excite her\r\nto dive into the mystery: on the contrary, she carefully repressed all\r\ncuriosity, remembering the promise she had given to her mother when she\r\ntalked of Zobeide and the porter. She had not been without temptation to\r\nbreak this promise; for the maid who usually attended her toilette had\r\nemployed every art in her power to stimulate her curiosity. As she was\r\ndressing Helena this morning, she had said to her, "The reason I was so\r\nlate calling you, miss, this morning, was because I was so late\r\nmyself last night; for I went to the play, miss, last night, which was\r\nBluebeard. Lord bless us! I\'m sure, if I had been Bluebeard\'s wife, I\r\nshould have opened the door, if I\'d died for it; for to have the notion\r\nof living all day long, and all night too, in a house in which there\r\nwas a room that one was never to go into, is a thing I could not put up\r\nwith." Then after a pause, and after waiting in vain for some reply\r\nfrom Helena, she added, "Pray, Miss Delacour, did you ever go into that\r\nlittle room within my lady\'s bedchamber, that Mrs. Marriott keeps the\r\nkey of always?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Helena.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve often wondered what\'s in it: but then that\'s only because I\'m a\r\nsimpleton. I thought to be sure, _you_ knew."\r\n\r\nObserving that Helena looked much displeased, she broke off her speech,\r\nhoping that what she had said would operate in due time, and that she\r\nshould thus excite the young lady to get the secret from Marriott, which\r\nshe had no doubt afterward of _worming_ from Miss Delacour.\r\n\r\nIn all this she calculated ill; for what she had said only made Helena\r\ndistrust and dislike her. It was the recollection of this conversation\r\nthat made her follow the maid to her mother\'s bedchamber, to see what\r\ndetained her there so long. Helena had heard Marriott say, that "she\r\nought not to run up and down stairs, because her lady was asleep," and\r\nit appeared extraordinary that but a few minutes after this information\r\nshe should have gone into the room with a glass of jelly in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Ah, mamma!" thought Helena, as she stood beside her mother\'s bed, "you\r\ndid not understand, and perhaps you did not believe me, when I said that\r\nI would not try to find out any thing that you wished me not to know.\r\nNow I hope you will _understand_ me better."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour opened her eyes: "Helena," cried she, starting up, "how\r\ncame you by that key?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother! don\'t look as if you suspected me." She then told her\r\nmother how the key came into her hands.\r\n\r\n"My dear child, you have done me an essential service," said Lady\r\nDelacour: "you know not its importance, at least in my estimation. But\r\nwhat gives me infinitely more satisfaction, you have proved yourself\r\nworthy of my esteem--my love."\r\n\r\nMarriott came into the room, and whispered a few words to her lady.\r\n\r\n"You may speak out, Marriott, before my Helena," said Lady Delacour,\r\nrising from the bed as she spoke: "child as she is, Helena has deserved\r\nmy confidence; and she shall be convinced that, where her mother has\r\nonce reason to confide, she is incapable of suspicion. Wait here for a\r\nfew minutes, my dear."\r\n\r\nShe went to her boudoir, paid and dismissed the surgeon expeditiously,\r\nthen returned, and taking her daughter by the hand, she said, "You\r\nlook all simplicity, my dear! I see you have no vulgar, school-girl\r\ncuriosity. You will have all your mother\'s strength of mind; may you\r\nnever have any of her faults, or any of her misfortunes! I speak to you\r\nnot as to a child, Helena, for you have reason far above your years; and\r\nyou will remember what I now say to you as long as you live. You will\r\npossess talents, beauty, fortune; you will be admired, followed, and\r\nflattered, as I have been: but do not throw away your life as I have\r\nthrown away mine--to win the praise of fools. Had I used but half the\r\ntalents I possess, as I hope you will use yours, I might have been an\r\nornament to my sex--I might have been a Lady Anne Percival."\r\n\r\nHere Lady Delacour\'s voice failed; but commanding her emotion, she in a\r\nfew moments went on speaking.\r\n\r\n"Choose your friends well, my dear daughter! It was my misfortune, my\r\nfolly, early in life to connect myself with a woman, who under the name\r\nof frolic led me into every species of mischief. You are too young, too\r\ninnocent, to hear the particulars of my history now; but you will hear\r\nthem all at a proper time from my best friend, Miss Portman. I shall\r\nleave you to her care, my dear, when I die."\r\n\r\n"When you die!--Oh, mother!" said Helena, "but why do you talk of\r\ndying?" and she threw her arms round her mother.\r\n\r\n"Gently, my love!" said Lady Delacour, shrinking back; and she seized\r\nthis moment to explain to her daughter why she shrunk in this manner\r\nfrom her caresses, and why she talked of dying.\r\n\r\nHelena was excessively shocked.\r\n\r\n"I wished, my dear," resumed her mother, calmly, "I wished to have\r\nspared you the pain of knowing all this. I have given you but little\r\npleasure in my life; it is unjust to give you so much pain. We shall go\r\nto Twickenham to-morrow, and I will leave you with your Aunt Margaret,\r\nmy dear, till all is over. If I die, Belinda will take you with her\r\nimmediately to Oakly-park--you shall have as little sorrow as possible.\r\nIf you had shown me less of your affectionate temper, you would have\r\nspared yourself the anguish that you now feel, and you would have spared\r\nme--"\r\n\r\n"My dear, kind mother," interrupted Helena, throwing herself on her\r\nknees at her mother\'s feet, "do not send me away from you--I don\'t wish\r\nto go to my Aunt Margaret--I don\'t wish to go to Oakly-park--I wish\r\nto stay with you. Do not send me away from you; for I shall suffer ten\r\ntimes more if I am not with you, though I know I can be of no use."\r\n\r\nOvercome by her daughter\'s entreaties, Lady Delacour at last consented\r\nthat she should remain with her, and that she should accompany her to\r\nTwickenham.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this day was taken up in preparations for their\r\ndeparture. The _stupid maid_ was immediately dismissed. No questions\r\nwere asked, and no reasons for her dismissal assigned, except that Lady\r\nDelacour had no farther occasion for her services. Marriott alone was\r\nto attend her lady to Twickenham. Lord Delacour, it was settled, should\r\nstay in town, lest the unusual circumstance of his attending his lady\r\nshould excite public curiosity. His lordship, who was naturally a\r\ngood-natured man, and who had been touched by the kindness his wife had\r\nlately shown him, was in extreme agitation during the whole of this day,\r\nwhich he thought might possibly be the last of her existence. She, on\r\nthe contrary, was calm and collected; her courage seemed to rise with\r\nthe necessity for its exertion.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when the carriage came to the door, as she parted\r\nwith Lord Delacour, she put into his hand a paper that contained some\r\ndirections and requests with which, she said, she hoped that he would\r\ncomply, if they should prove to be her _last_. The paper contained only\r\nsome legacies to her servants, a provision for Marriott, and a bequest\r\nto her excellent and beloved friend, Belinda Portman, of the cabinet in\r\nwhich she kept Clarence Hervey\'s letters.\r\n\r\nInterlined in this place, Lady Delacour had written these words: "My\r\ndaughter is nobly provided for; and lest any doubt or difficulty should\r\narise from the omission, I think it necessary to mention that the said\r\ncabinet contains the valuable jewels left to me by my late uncle,\r\nand that it is my intention that the said jewels should be part of\r\nmy bequest to the said Belinda Portman.--If she marry a man of good\r\nfortune, she will wear them for my sake: if she do not marry an opulent\r\nhusband, I hope she will sell the jewels without scruple, as they are\r\nintended for her convenience, and not as an ostentatious bequest. It is\r\nfit that she should be as independent in her circumstances as she is in\r\nher mind."\r\n\r\nLord Delacour with much emotion looked over this paper, and assured her\r\nladyship that she should be obeyed, if--he could say no more.\r\n\r\n"Farewell, then, my lord!" said she: "keep up your spirits, for I intend\r\nto live many years yet to try them."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nA SPECTRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surgeon who was to attend Lady Delacour was prevented from going\r\nto her on the day appointed; he was one of the surgeons of the queen\'s\r\nhousehold, and his attendance was required at the palace. This delay was\r\nextremely irksome to Lady Delacour, who had worked up her courage to the\r\nhighest point, but who had not prepared herself to endure suspense. She\r\nspent nearly a week at Twickenham in this anxious state, and Belinda\r\nobserved that she every day became more and more thoughtful and\r\nreserved. She seemed as if she had some secret subject of meditation,\r\nfrom which she could not bear to be distracted. When Helena was present,\r\nshe exerted herself to converse in her usual sprightly strain; but as\r\nsoon as she could escape, as she thought, unobserved, she would shut\r\nherself up in her own apartment, and remain there for hours.\r\n\r\n"I wish to Heaven, Miss Portman," said Marriott, coming one morning\r\ninto her room with a portentous face, "I wish to Heaven, ma\'am, that you\r\ncould any way persuade my lady not to spend so many hours of the day and\r\nnight as she does in reading those methodistical books that she keeps to\r\nherself!--I\'m sure that they do her no good, but a great deal of harm,\r\nespecially now when her spirits should be kept up as much as possible.\r\nI am sensible, ma\'am, that \'tis those books that have made my lady\r\nmelancholy of a sudden. Ma\'am, my lady has let drop very odd\r\nhints within these two or three days, and she speaks in a strange\r\n_disconnected_ sort of style, and at times I do not think she is quite\r\nright in her head."\r\n\r\nWhen Belinda questioned Marriott more particularly about the strange\r\nhints which her lady had let fall, she with looks of embarrassment\r\nand horror declined repeating the words that had been said to her; yet\r\npersisted in asserting that Lady Delacour had been very _strange_ for\r\nthese two or three days. "And I\'m sure, ma\'am, you\'d be shocked if you\r\nwere to see my lady in a morning, when she wakens, or rather when I\r\nfirst go into the room--for, as to wakening, that\'s out of the question.\r\nI am certain she does not sleep during the whole night. You\'ll find,\r\nma\'am, it is as I tell you, those books will quite turn her poor head,\r\nand I wish they were burnt. I know the mischief that the same sort of\r\nthings did to a poor cousin of my own, who was driven melancholy mad\r\nby a methodist preacher, and came to an untimely end. Oh, ma\'am! if you\r\nknew as much as I do, you\'d be as much alarmed for my lady as I am."\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to prevail upon Marriott to explain herself more\r\ndistinctly. The only circumstances that could be drawn from her seemed\r\nto Belinda so trifling as to be scarcely worth mentioning. For instance,\r\nthat Lady Delacour, contrary to Marriott\'s advice, had insisted on\r\nsleeping in a bedchamber upon the ground floor, and had refused to let\r\na curtain be put up before a glass door that was at the foot of her bed.\r\n"When I offered to put up the curtain, ma\'am," said Marriott, "my lady\r\nsaid she liked the moonlight, and that she would not have it put up till\r\nthe fine nights were over. Now, Miss Portman, to hear my lady talk of\r\nthe moon, and moonlights, and liking the moon, is rather extraordinary\r\nand unaccountable; for I never heard her say any thing of the sort in\r\nher life before; I question whether she ever knew there was a moon or\r\nnot from one year\'s end to another. But they say the moon has a great\r\ndeal to do with mad people; and, from my own experience, I\'m perfectly\r\nsensible, ma\'am, it had in my own cousin\'s case; for, before he came to\r\nthe worst, he took a prodigious fancy to the moon, and was always for\r\nwalking by moonlight, and talking to one of the beauty of the moon, and\r\nsuch melancholy nonsense, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nBelinda could not forbear smiling at this melancholy nonsense; though\r\nshe was inclined to be of Marriott\'s opinion about the methodistical\r\nbooks, and she determined to talk to Lady Delacour on the subject.\r\nThe moment that she made the attempt, her ladyship, commanding her\r\ncountenance, with her usual ability, replied only by cautious, cold\r\nmonosyllables, and changed the conversation as soon as she could.\r\n\r\nAt night, when they were retiring to rest, Marriott, as she lighted them\r\nto their rooms, observed that she was afraid her lady would suffer from\r\nsleeping in so cold a bedchamber, and Belinda pressed her friend to\r\nchange her apartment.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear," replied Lady Delacour, calmly. "I have chosen this for\r\nmy bedchamber, because it is at a distance from the servants\' rooms; and\r\nwhen _the operation_, which I have to go through, shall be performed, my\r\ncries, if I should utter any, will not be overheard. The surgeon will be\r\nhere in a few days, and it is not worth while to make any change."\r\n\r\nThe next day, towards evening, the surgeon and Dr. X---- arrived.\r\nBelinda\'s blood ran cold at the sight of them.\r\n\r\n"Will you be so kind, Miss Portman," said Marriott, "as to let my lady\r\nknow that they are come? for I am not well able to go, and you can speak\r\nmore composed to her than I can."\r\n\r\nMiss Portman went to Lady Delacour\'s bedchamber. The door was bolted.\r\nAs Lady Delacour opened it, she fixed her eyes upon Belinda, and said\r\nto her with a mild voice, "You are come to tell me that the surgeon is\r\narrived. I knew that by the manner in which you knocked at the door.\r\nI will see him this moment," continued she, in a firm tone; and she\r\ndeliberately put a mark in the book which she had been reading,\r\nwalked leisurely to the other end of the room, and locked it up in her\r\nbook-case. There was an air of determined dignity in all her motions.\r\n"Shall we go? I am ready," said she, holding out her hand to Belinda,\r\nwho had sunk upon a chair.\r\n\r\n"One would think that you were the person that was going to suffer. But\r\ndrink this water, my dear, and do not tremble for me; you see that I do\r\nnot tremble for myself. Listen to me, dearest Belinda! I owe it to\r\nyour friendship not to torment you with unnecessary apprehensions. Your\r\nhumanity shall be spared this dreadful scene."\r\n\r\n"No," said Belinda, "Marriott is incapable of attending you. I must--I\r\nwill--I am ready now. Forgive me one moment\'s weakness. I admire, and\r\nwill imitate, your courage. I will keep my promise."\r\n\r\n"Your promise was to be with me in my dying moments, and to let me\r\nbreathe my last in your arms."\r\n\r\n"I hope that I shall never be called upon to perform that promise."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour made no answer, but walked on before her with steady steps\r\ninto the room where Dr. X---- and the surgeon were waiting. Without\r\nadverting in the least to the object of their visit, she paid her\r\ncompliments to them, as if they came on a visit of mere civility.\r\nWithout seeming to notice the serious countenances of her companions,\r\nshe talked of indifferent subjects with the most perfect ease, occupying\r\nherself all the time with cleaning a seal, which she unhooked from her\r\nwatch-chain. "This seal," said she, turning to Dr. X----, "is a fine\r\nonyx--it is a head of Esculapius. I have a great value for it. It was\r\ngiven to me by your friend, Clarence Hervey; and I have left it in my\r\nwill, doctor," continued she, smiling, "to you, as no slight token of my\r\nregard. He is an excellent young man; and I request," said she, drawing\r\nDr. X---- to a window, and lowering her voice, "I request, when you see\r\nhim again, and when I am out of the way, that you will tell him such\r\nwere my sentiments to the hour of my death. Here is a letter which you\r\nwill have the goodness to put into his hands, sealed with my favourite\r\nseal. You need have no scruple to take charge of it; it relates not to\r\nmyself. It expresses only my opinion concerning a lady who stands almost\r\nas high in your esteem, I believe, as she does in mine. My affection\r\nand my gratitude have not biassed my judgment in the advice which I have\r\nventured to give to Mr. Hervey."\r\n\r\n"But he will soon be here," interrupted Dr. X----, "and then--"\r\n\r\n"And then I shall be gone," said Lady Delacour, coolly,\r\n\r\n    "\'To that undiscover\'d country,\r\n    From whose bourn no traveller returns.\'"\r\n\r\nDr. X---- was going to interrupt her, but she continued rapidly, "And\r\nnow, my dear doctor, tell me candidly, have you seen any symptoms of\r\ncowardice in my manner this evening?"\r\n\r\n"None," replied he. "On the contrary, I have admired your calm\r\nself-possession."\r\n\r\n"Then do not suspect me of want of fortitude, when I request that this\r\noperation may not be performed to-day. I have changed my mind within\r\nthese few hours. I have determined, for a reason which I am sure that\r\nyou would feel to be sufficient, to postpone this affair till to-morrow.\r\nBelieve me, I do not act from caprice."\r\n\r\nShe saw that Dr. X---- did not yield assent to her last assertion, and\r\nthat he looked displeased.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you my reason," said she; "and then you will have no\r\nright to be displeased if I persist, as I shall inflexibly, in my\r\ndetermination. It is my belief that I shall die this night. To submit to\r\na painful operation to-day would be only to sacrifice the last moments\r\nof my existence to no purpose. If I survive this night, manage me as\r\nyou please! But I am the best judge of my own feelings--I shall die\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\nDr. X---- looked at her with a mixture of astonishment and compassion.\r\nHer pulse was high, she was extremely feverish, and he thought that the\r\nbest thing which he could do was to stay with her till the next day, and\r\nto endeavour to divert her mind from this fancy, which he considered as\r\nan insane idea. He prevailed upon the surgeon to stay with her till the\r\nnext morning; and he communicated his intentions to Belinda, who joined\r\nwith him in doing all that was possible to entertain and interest her\r\nby conversation during the remainder of the day. She had sufficient\r\npenetration to perceive that they gave not the least faith to her\r\nprognostic, and she never said one word more upon the subject; but\r\nappeared willing to be amused by their attempts to divert her, and\r\nresolute to support her courage to the last moment. She did not affect\r\ntrifling gaiety: on the contrary, there was in all she said more\r\nstrength and less point than usual.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed away, and Lady Delacour seemed totally to have\r\nforgotten her own prophecy respecting the event of the ensuing night;\r\nso much so, that she spoke of several things that she intended to do the\r\nnext day. Helena knew nothing of what had passed, and Belinda imagined\r\nthat her friend put this constraint upon herself to avoid alarming her\r\ndaughter. Yet, after Helena retired, her mother\'s manner continued to be\r\nso much the same, that Dr. X---- began to believe that her ladyship\r\nwas actuated merely by caprice. In this opinion she confirmed him by\r\nbursting out a laughing when he proposed that some one should sit up\r\nwith her during the night.\r\n\r\n"My sage sir," said she, "have you lived to this time without ever\r\nhaving been duped by a woman before? I wanted a day\'s reprieve, and I\r\nhave gained it--gained a day, spent in most agreeable conversation, for\r\nwhich I thank you. To-morrow," said she, turning to the surgeon, "I must\r\ninvent some new excuse for my cowardice; and though I give you notice of\r\nit beforehand, as Harrington did when he picked the man\'s pocket, yet,\r\nnevertheless, I shall succeed. Good night!"\r\n\r\nShe hurried to her own apartment, leaving them all in astonishment and\r\nperplexity. Belinda was persuaded that she only affected this gaiety to\r\nprevent Dr. X---- from insisting upon sitting up in her room, as he had\r\nproposed. Doctor X----, judging, as he said, from her ladyship\'s general\r\ncharacter, attributed the whole to caprice; and the surgeon, judging,\r\nas he said, from human nature in general, was decided in his belief that\r\nshe had been influenced, as she herself declared, by cowardice. After\r\nhaving all expressed their opinions, without making any impression upon\r\none another, they retired to rest.\r\n\r\nBelinda\'s bedchamber was next to Helena\'s; and after she had been in bed\r\nabout an hour, she fancied that she heard some one walking softly in\r\nthe next room. She rose, and found Lady Delacour standing beside her\r\ndaughter\'s bed. She started at the sight of Belinda, but only said in\r\na low voice, as she pointed to her child, "Don\'t waken her." She then\r\nlooked at her for some moments in silence. The moon shone full upon\r\nher face. She stooped over Helena, parted the ringlets of hair upon her\r\nforehead, and kissed her gently.\r\n\r\n"You will be good to this poor girl when I am gone, Belinda!" said she,\r\nturning away from her as she spoke: "I only came to look at her for the\r\nlast time."\r\n\r\n"Are you then serious, my dear Lady Delacour?"\r\n\r\n"Hush! Don\'t waken her," said Lady Delacour, putting her finger on her\r\nlips; and walking slowly out of the room, she forbade Belinda to follow.\r\n\r\n"If my fears be vain," said she, "why should I disturb you with them? If\r\nthey be just, you will hear my bell ring, and then come to me."\r\n\r\nFor some time afterward all was perfectly silent in the house. Belinda\r\ndid not go to bed, but sat waiting and listening anxiously. The clock\r\nstruck two; and as she heard no other sound, she began to hope that she\r\nhad suffered herself to be falsely alarmed by a foolish imagination, and\r\nshe lay down upon her bed, resolving to compose herself to rest. She was\r\njust sinking to sleep, when she thought she heard the faint sound of a\r\nbell. She was not sure whether she was dreaming or awake. She started up\r\nand listened. All was silent. But in a few minutes Lady Delacour\'s bell\r\nrang violently. Belinda flew to her room. The surgeon was already there;\r\nhe had been sitting up in the next room to write letters, and he\r\nhad heard the first sound of the bell. Lady Delacour was senseless,\r\nsupported in the surgeon\'s arms. Belinda, by his directions, ran\r\nimmediately for Doctor X----, who was at the other end of the house.\r\nBefore she returned, Lady Delacour had recovered her senses. She begged\r\nthat the surgeon would leave the room, and that neither Dr. X---- nor\r\nMarriott might be yet admitted, as she had something of importance to\r\ncommunicate to Miss Portman. The surgeon withdrew, and she beckoned to\r\nBelinda, who sat down upon the side of her bed. Lady Delacour held out\r\nher hand to her; it was covered with a cold dew.\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," said she, "my prophecy is accomplishing--I know I must\r\ndie."\r\n\r\n"The surgeon said that you were not in the least danger, my dear Lady\r\nDelacour; that it was merely a fainting fit. Do not suffer a vain\r\nimagination thus to overpower your reason."\r\n\r\n"It is no vain imagination--I must die," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n    \'I hear a voice you cannot hear,\r\n        Which says I must not stay;\r\n    I see a hand you cannot see,\r\n        Which beckons me away.\'\r\n\r\n"You perceive that I am in my perfect senses, my dear, or I could not\r\nquote poetry. I am not insane--I am not delirious."\r\n\r\nShe paused--"I am ashamed to tell you what I know will expose me to your\r\nridicule."\r\n\r\n"Ridicule!" cried Belinda: "can you think me so cruel as to consider\r\nyour sufferings a subject for ridicule?"\r\n\r\nLady Delacour was overcome by the tenderness with which Belinda spoke.\r\n\r\n"I will then speak to you," said she, "without reserve. Inconsistent as\r\nit is with the strength of mind which you might expect from me, I cannot\r\nresist the impression which has been made on my mind by--a vision."\r\n\r\n"A vision!"\r\n\r\n"Three times," continued Lady Delacour, "it has appeared to me about\r\nthis hour. The first night after we came here I saw it; last night it\r\nreturned; and to-night I have beheld it for the third time. I consider\r\nit as a warning to prepare for death. You are surprised--you are\r\nincredulous. I know that this must appear to you extravagant; but depend\r\nupon it that what I tell you is true. It is scarcely a quarter of an\r\nhour since I beheld the figure of ----, that man for whose untimely\r\ndeath I am answerable. Whenever I close my eyes the same form appears\r\nbefore me."\r\n\r\n"These visions," said Belinda, "are certainly the effects of opium."\r\n\r\n"The forms that flit before my eyes when I am between sleeping and\r\nwaking," said Lady Delacour, "I am willing to believe, are the effects\r\nof opium; but, Belinda, it is impossible I should be convinced that my\r\nsenses have deceived me with respect to what I have beheld when I have\r\nbeen as broad awake, and in as perfect possession of my understanding as\r\nI am at this instant. The habits of my life, and the natural gaiety,\r\nnot to say levity, of my temper, have always inclined me rather to\r\nincredulity than to superstition. But there are things which no strength\r\nof mind, no temerity can resist. I repeat it--this is a warning to me to\r\nprepare for death. No human means, no human power can save me!"\r\n\r\nHere they were interrupted by Marriott, who could no longer be\r\nrestrained from bursting into the room. Dr. X---- followed, and going\r\ncalmly to the side of Lady Delacour\'s bed, took her hand to feel her\r\npulse.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Marriott, you need not alarm yourself in this manner," said he:\r\n"your lady is at this instant in as little danger as I am."\r\n\r\n"_You_ think she\'ll live! Oh, my lady! why did you terrify us in this\r\nmanner?"\r\n\r\nLady Delacour smiled, and calmly said, as Doctor X---- still continued\r\nto count her pulse, "The pulse may deceive you, doctor, but I do not.\r\nMarriott, you may--"\r\n\r\nBelinda heard no more; for at this instant, as she was standing alone,\r\nnear the glass-door that was opposite to the bed, she saw at a distance\r\nin the garden the figure which Lady Delacour had described. Lady\r\nDelacour was now so intent upon speaking to Dr. X----, that she saw\r\nnothing but him. Belinda had the presence of mind to be perfectly\r\nsilent. The figure stood still for some moments. She advanced a few\r\nsteps nearer to the window, and the figure vanished. She kept her eye\r\nsteadily fixed upon the spot where it had disappeared, and she saw it\r\nrise again and glide quickly behind some bushes. Belinda beckoned to Dr.\r\nX----, who perceived by the eagerness of her manner, that she wished\r\nto speak to him immediately. He resigned his patient to Marriott, and\r\nfollowed Miss Portman out of the room. She told him what she had just\r\nseen, said it was of the utmost consequence to Lady Delacour to have the\r\ntruth ascertained, and requested that Dr. X----would go with some of\r\nthe men-servants and search the garden, to discover whether any one was\r\nthere concealed, or whether any footsteps could be traced. The doctor\r\ndid not search long before he perceived footsteps in the borders\r\nopposite to the glass-door of Lady Delacour\'s bedchamber; he was\r\ncarefully following their track, when he heard a loud cry, which seemed\r\nto come from the other side of the garden wall. There was a breach\r\nin the wall over which he scrambled with some difficulty. The screams\r\ncontinued with redoubled violence. As he was making his way to the\r\nspot from which they proceeded, he was met by the old gardener, who was\r\ncrossing one of the walks with a lantern in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Ho! ho!" cried the gardener, "I take it that we have the thief at last.\r\nI fancy that the fellow whose footsteps I traced, and who has been at my\r\nmorello cherry-tree every night, has been caught in the trap. I hope his\r\nleg is not broke, though!-This way, sir--this way!"\r\n\r\nThe gardener led the doctor to the place, and there they found a man,\r\nwhose leg had actually been caught in the spring-trap which had been set\r\nfor the defence of the cherry-tree. The man had by this time fallen into\r\na swoon; they extricated him as fast as possible, and Doctor X----\r\nhad him brought to Lady Delacour\'s, in order that the surgeon, who was\r\nthere, might see his leg.\r\n\r\nAs they were carrying him across the hall, Belinda met them. She poured\r\nout a glass of water for the man, who was just recovering from his\r\nswoon; but as she went nearer to give it him, she was struck with his\r\nwonderful resemblance to Harriot Freke.\r\n\r\n"It must be Mrs. Freke herself!" whispered she to Marriott, whose wide\r\nopening eyes, at this instant, fixed themselves upon her.\r\n\r\n"It must be Mrs. Freke herself, ma\'am!" repeated Marriott.\r\n\r\nAnd so in fact it was.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain class of people, who are incapable of generous\r\nconfidence in their equals, but who are disposed to yield implicit\r\ncredit to the underhand information of mean emissaries. Through the\r\nmedium of Champfort and the _stupid maid_, Mrs. Freke had learned a\r\nconfused story of a man\'s footsteps having been heard in Lady Delacour\'s\r\nboudoir, of his being let in by Marriott secretly, of his having\r\nremained locked up there for several hours, and of the maid\'s having\r\nbeen turned away, merely because she innocently went to open the door\r\nwhilst the gentleman was in concealment. Mrs. Freke was farther informed\r\nby the same unquestionable authority, that Lady Delacour had taken a\r\nhouse at Twickenham, for the express purpose of meeting her lover: that\r\nMiss Portman and Marriott were the only persons who were to be of this\r\nparty of pleasure.\r\n\r\nUpon the faith of this intelligence, Mrs. Freke, who had accompanied\r\nMrs. Luttridge to town, immediately repaired to Twickenham, to pay a\r\nvisit to a third cousin, that she might have an opportunity of detecting\r\nthe intrigues, and afterwards of publishing the disgrace, of her former\r\nfriend. The desire of revenging herself upon Miss Portman, for having\r\ndeclined her civilities at Harrowgate, had also a powerful influence in\r\nstimulating her malicious activity. She knew that if it were proved that\r\nBelinda was the confidante of Lady Delacour\'s intrigues, her reputation\r\nmust be materially injured, and that the Percivals would then be as\r\ndesirous to break off as they now were anxious to promote the match with\r\nMr. Vincent. Charmed with this hope of a double triumph, the vindictive\r\nlady commenced her operations, nor was she ashamed to descend to the\r\ncharacter of a spy. The general and convenient name of _frolic_, she\r\nthought, would cover every species of meanness. She swore that "it was\r\ncharming fun to equip herself at night in men\'s clothes, and to sally\r\nforth to reconnoitre the motions of the enemy."\r\n\r\nBy an unfrequented path she used to gain the window that looked into\r\nLady Delacour\'s bedchamber. This was the figure which appeared at night\r\nat a certain hour, and which, to her ladyship\'s disturbed imagination,\r\nseemed to be the form of Colonel Lawless. There was, indeed, a\r\nresemblance in their size and persons, which favoured the delusion.\r\nFor several nights Mrs. Freke paid these visits without obtaining\r\nany satisfaction; but this night she thought herself overpaid for her\r\nexertions, by the charming discovery which she fancied she had made. She\r\nmistook the surgeon for a lover of Lady Delacour\'s; and she was hurrying\r\nhome with the joyful intelligence, when she was caught in the gardener\'s\r\ntrap. The agony that she suffered was at first intense, but in a few\r\nhours the pain somewhat subsided; and in this interval of rest she\r\nturned to Belinda, and with a malicious smile said,--"Miss Portman, \'tis\r\nfair I should pay for my peeping; but I shall not pay quite so dear for\r\nit as some of my friends."\r\n\r\nMiss Portman did not in the least comprehend her, till she added, "I\'m\r\nsure you\'ll allow that \'tis better for a lady to lose her leg than her\r\nreputation--and for my part I\'d rather be caught in a man trap, than\r\nhave a man caught in my bedchamber. My service to your friend, Lady\r\nDelacour, and tell her so."\r\n\r\n"And do you know who that gentleman was, that you saw in her ladyship\'s\r\nroom?"\r\n\r\n"Not I, not yet; but I\'ll make it my business to find out. I give you\r\nfair notice; I\'m a very devil when provoked. Why didn\'t you make me your\r\nfriend when you could?--You\'ll not baffle me. I have seen all I wanted,\r\nand I am capable of painting all I saw. As to who the man might be,\r\nthat\'s no matter; one Lothario is as good as another for my purpose."\r\n\r\nLonger had Mrs. Freke spoken with malignant triumph, had she not been\r\ninterrupted by a burst of laughter from the surgeon. Her vexation was\r\nindescribable when he informed her, that he was the man whom she had\r\nseen in Lady Delacour\'s bedchamber, and whom she had mistaken for a\r\nfavoured lover.\r\n\r\nMrs. Freke\'s leg was much cut and bruised; and now that she was no\r\nlonger supported by the hopes of revenge, she began to lament loudly and\r\nincessantly the injury that she had sustained. She impatiently inquired\r\nhow long it was probable that she should be confined by this accident;\r\nand she grew quite outrageous when it was hinted, that the beauty of her\r\nlegs would be spoiled, and that she would never more be able to appear\r\nto advantage in man\'s apparel. The dread of being seen by Lady Delacour\r\nin the deplorable yet ludicrous situation to which she had reduced\r\nherself operated next upon her mind, and every time the door of the\r\napartment opened, she looked with terror towards it, expecting to\r\nsee her ladyship appear. But though Lady Delacour heard from Marriott\r\nimmediately the news of Mrs. Freke\'s disaster, she never disturbed her\r\nby her presence. She was too generous to insult a fallen foe.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning Mrs. Freke was by her own desire conveyed to her\r\ncousin\'s house, where without regret we shall leave her to suffer the\r\nconsequences of her frolic.\r\n\r\n"A false prophetess! Nowithstanding all my visions, I have outlived the\r\nnight, you see," said Lady Delacour, to Miss Portman when they met in\r\nthe morning. "I have heard, my dear Belinda, and I believe, that the\r\npassion of love, which can endure caprice, vice, wrinkles, deformity,\r\npoverty, nay, disease itself, is notwithstanding so squeamish as to\r\nbe instantaneously disgusted by the perception of folly in the object\r\nbeloved. I hope friendship, though akin to love, is of a more robust\r\nconstitution, else what would become of me? My folly, and my visions,\r\nand my spectre--oh, that I had not exposed myself to you in this manner!\r\nHarriot Freke herself is scarcely more contemptible. Spies and cowards\r\nare upon an equal footing. Her malice and her _frolic_ are consistent\r\nwith her character, but my fears and my superstition are totally\r\ninconsistent with mine. Forget the nonsense I talked to you last night,\r\nmy dear, or fancy that I was then under the dominion of laudanum. This\r\nmorning you shall see Lady Delacour _herself again_. Is Dr. X----, is\r\nthe surgeon ready? Where are they? I am prepared. My fortitude shall\r\nredeem me in your opinion, Belinda, and in my own."\r\n\r\nDoctor X---- and the surgeon immediately obeyed her summons.\r\n\r\nHelena heard them go into Lady Delacour\'s room, and she saw by\r\nMarriott\'s countenance, who followed, that her mother was going to\r\nsubmit to the operation. She sat down trembling on the steps which led\r\nto her mother\'s room, and waited there a long time, as she thought, in\r\nthe most painful suspense. At last she heard some one call Helena. She\r\nlooked up, and saw her father close to her.\r\n\r\n"Helena," said he, "how is your mother?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Oh, papa, you cannot go in there _now_," said Helena,\r\nstopping him as he was pressing forwards.\r\n\r\n"Why did not you or Miss Portman write to me yesterday, as you\r\npromised?" said Lord Delacour, in a voice that showed he was scarcely\r\nable to ask the question.\r\n\r\n"Because, papa, we had nothing to tell you: nothing was done yesterday.\r\nBut the surgeon is now there," said Helena, pointing towards her\r\nmother\'s room.\r\n\r\nLord Delacour stood motionless for an instant; then suddenly seizing his\r\ndaughter\'s hand, "Let us go," said he: "if we stay here, we shall\r\nhear her screams;" and he was hurrying her away, when the door of Lady\r\nDelacour\'s apartment opened, and Belinda appeared, her countenance\r\nradiant with joy.\r\n\r\n"Good news, dear Helena! Oh, my lord! you are come in a happy moment--I\r\ngive you joy."\r\n\r\n"Joy! joy! joy!" cried Marriott, following.\r\n\r\n"Is it all over?" said Lord Delacour.\r\n\r\n"And without a single shriek!" said Helena. "What courage!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no need of shrieks, or courage either, thank God," said\r\nMarriott. "Dr. X---- says so, and he is the best man in the world, and\r\nthe cleverest. And I was right from the first; I said it was impossible\r\nmy lady should have such a shocking complaint as she thought she had.\r\nThere\'s no such thing at all in the case, my lord! I said so always,\r\ntill I was persuaded out of my senses by that villainous quack, who\r\ncontradicted me for this own \'molument. And Doctor X---- says, if my\r\nlady will leave off the terrible quantities of laudanum she takes, he\'ll\r\nengage for her recovery."\r\n\r\nThe surgeon and Dr. X---- now explained to Lord Delacour that the\r\nunprincipled wretch to whom her ladyship had applied for assistance had\r\npersuaded her that she had a cancer, though in fact her complaint arose\r\nmerely from the bruise which she had received. He knew too well how to\r\nmake a wound hideous and painful, and so continue her delusion for his\r\nown advantage. Dr. X---- observed, that if Lady Delacour would have\r\npermitted either the surgeon or him to have _examined_ sooner into the\r\nreal state of the case, it would have saved herself infinite pain, and\r\nthem all anxiety. Belinda at this moment felt too much to speak.\r\n\r\n"I\'m morally certain," cried Marriott, "Mr. Champfort would die with\r\nvexation, if he could see the joy that\'s painted in my lord\'s face this\r\nminute. And we may thank Miss Portman for this, for \'twas she made every\r\nthing go right, and I never expected to live to see so happy a day."\r\n\r\nWhilst Marriott ran on in this manner with all the volubility of joy,\r\nLord Delacour passed her with some difficulty, and Helena was in her\r\nmother\'s arms in an instant.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour, struck to the heart by their affectionate looks and\r\nwords, burst into tears. "How little have I deserved this kindness from\r\nyou, my lord! or from you, my child! But my feelings," added she,\r\nwiping away her tears, "shall not waste themselves in tears, nor in vain\r\nthanks. My actions, the whole course of my future life, shall show that\r\nI am not quite a brute. Even brutes are won by kindness. Observe, my\r\nlord," continued she, smiling, "I said _won_, not _tamed!_--A tame Lady\r\nDelacour would be a sorry animal, not worth looking at. Were she even to\r\nbecome domesticated, she would fare the worse."\r\n\r\n"How so?--How so, my dear?" said Lord Delacour and Belinda almost in the\r\nsame breath.\r\n\r\n"How so?--Why, if Lady Delacour were to wash off her rouge, and lay\r\naside her air, and be as gentle, good, and kind as Belinda Portman, for\r\ninstance, her lord would certainly say to her,\r\n\r\n    \'So alter\'d are your face and mind,\r\n    \'Twere perjury to love you now.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPLAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some minds, emotions of joy are always connected with feelings of\r\nbenevolence and generosity. Lady Delacour\'s heart expanded with the\r\nsensations of friendship and gratitude, now that she was relieved from\r\nthose fears by which she had so long been oppressed.\r\n\r\n"My dear daughter," said she to Helena, "have you at this instant any\r\nwish that I can gratify?--Ask any thing you please, the fairy Goodwill\r\nshall contrive to get it for you in a trice. You have thought of a\r\nwish at this moment, I know, by your eyes, by your blush. Nay, do not\r\nhesitate. Do you doubt me because I do not appear before you in the\r\nshape of a little ugly woman, like Cinderella\'s godmother? or do you\r\ndespise me because you do not see a wand waving in my hand?--\'Ah, little\r\nskilled of fairy lore!\' know that I am in possession of a talisman that\r\ncan command more than ever fairy granted. Behold my talisman," continued\r\nshe, drawing out her purse, and showing the gold through the net-work.\r\n"Speak boldly, then," cried she to Helena, "and be obeyed."\r\n\r\n"Ah, mamma," said Helena, "I was not thinking of what fairies or gold\r\ncan give; but you can grant my wish, and if you will let me, I will\r\nwhisper it to you."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour stooped to hear her daughter\'s whisper.\r\n\r\n"Your wish is granted, my own grateful, charming girl," said her mother.\r\n\r\nHelena\'s wish was, that her mother could be reconciled to her good aunt,\r\nMargaret Delacour.\r\n\r\nHer ladyship sat down instantly, and wrote to Mrs. Delacour. Helena was\r\nthe bearer of this letter, and Lady Delacour promised to wait upon this\r\nexcellent old lady as soon as she should return to town.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime her ladyship\'s health rapidly improved under the skilful\r\ncare of Dr. X----: it had been terribly injured by the ignorance and\r\nvillany of the wretch to whom she had so long and so rashly trusted. The\r\nnostrums which he persuaded her to take, and the immoderate use of opium\r\nto which she accustomed herself, would have ruined her constitution, had\r\nit not been uncommonly strong. Dr. X---- recommended it to her ladyship\r\nto abstain gradually from opium, and this advice she had the resolution\r\nto follow with uninterrupted perseverance.\r\n\r\nThe change in Lady Delacour\'s manner of life, in the hours and the\r\ncompany that she kept, contributed much to her recovery.[9] She was no\r\nlonger in continual anxiety to conceal the state of her health from the\r\nworld. She had no secret to keep--no part to act; her reconciliation\r\nwith her husband and with his friends restored her mind to ease and\r\nself-complacency. Her little Helena was a source of daily pleasure; and\r\nno longer conscious of neglecting her daughter, she no longer feared\r\nthat the affections of her child should be alienated. Dr. X----, well\r\naware that the passions have a powerful influence over the body, thought\r\nit full as necessary, in some cases, to attend to the mind as to the\r\npulse. By conversing with Lady Delacour, and by combining hints and\r\ncircumstances, he soon discovered what had lately been the course of\r\nher reading, and what impression it had made on her imagination.\r\nMrs. Marriott, indeed, assisted him with her opinion concerning _the\r\nmethodistical books_; and when he recollected the forebodings of death\r\nwhich her ladyship had felt, and the terror with which she had been\r\nseized on the night of Mrs. Freke\'s adventure, he was convinced that\r\nsuperstitious horrors hung upon his patient\'s spirits, and affected her\r\nhealth. To argue on religious subjects was not his province, much less\r\nhis inclination; but he was acquainted with a person qualified by his\r\nprofession and his character \'to minister to a mind diseased,\' and he\r\nresolved on the first favourable opportunity to introduce this gentleman\r\nto her ladyship.\r\n\r\nOne morning Lady Delacour was complaining to Belinda, that the books in\r\nthe library were in dreadful confusion. "My lord has really a very fine\r\nlibrary," said she; "but I wish he had half as many books twice as well\r\narranged: I never can find any thing I want. Dr. X----, I wish to heaven\r\nyou could recommend a librarian to my lord--not a chaplain, observe."\r\n\r\n"Why not a chaplain, may I ask your ladyship?" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, because we had once a chaplain, who gave me a surfeit of the whole\r\ntribe. The meanest sycophant, yet the most impertinent busy-body--always\r\ncringing, yet always intriguing--wanting to govern the whole family, and\r\nat the same time every creature\'s humble servant--fawning to my lord\r\nthe bishop, insolent to the poor curate--anathematizing all who differed\r\nfrom him in opinion, yet without dignity to enforce the respect due\r\nto his faith or his profession--greedy for preferment, yet without a\r\nthought of the duties of his office. It was the common practice of\r\nthis man to leap from his horse at the church door on a holiday, after\r\nfollowing a pack of hounds, huddle on his surplice, and gabble over\r\nthe service with the most indecent mockery of religion. Do I speak with\r\nacrimony? I have reason. It was this chaplain who first led my lord to\r\nNewmarket; it was he who first taught my lord to drink. Then he was _a\r\nwit_--an insufferable wit. His conversation after he had drank was\r\nsuch as no woman but Harriot Freke could understand, and such as few\r\n_gentlemen_ could hear. I have never, alas! been thought a prude, but in\r\nthe heyday of my youth and gaiety, this man always disgusted me. In one\r\nword, he was a buck parson. I hope you have as great a horror for this\r\nspecies of animal as I have?"\r\n\r\n"Full as great," replied Dr. X----; "but I consider them as monsters,\r\nwhich belonging to no species, can disgrace none."\r\n\r\n"They ought to be hunted by common consent out of civilized society,"\r\nsaid Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"They are by public opinion banished from all rational society; and your\r\nladyship\'s just indignation proves, that they have no chance of being\r\ntolerated by fashion. But would it not allow such beings too much\r\nconsequence, would it not extend their power to do mischief, if we\r\nperceived that one such person could disgust Lady Delacour with the\r\nwhole race of chaplains?"\r\n\r\n"It is uncommon," replied her ladyship, "to hear a physician _earnest_\r\nin the defence of the clergy--and a literary philosophic physician too!\r\nShall we have an eulogium upon bishops as well as chaplains?"\r\n\r\n"We have had that already," replied Dr. X----. "All ranks, persuasions,\r\nand descriptions of people, including, I hope, those stigmatized by the\r\nname of philosophers, have joined in admiration of the bishop of St.\r\nPol de Leon. The conduct of the real martyrs to their faith amongst\r\nthe French clergy, not even the most witty or brutal sceptic could\r\nridicule."\r\n\r\n"You surprise me, doctor!" said Lady Delacour; "for I assure you that\r\nyou have the character of being very liberal in your opinions."\r\n\r\n"I hope I am liberal in my opinions," replied the doctor, "and that I\r\ngive your ladyship a proof of it."\r\n\r\n"You would not then persecute a man or woman with ridicule for believing\r\nmore than you do?" said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Those who persecute, to overturn religion, can scarcely pretend to more\r\nphilosophy, or more liberality, than those who persecute to support it,"\r\nsaid Dr. X----.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, doctor, you are only speaking popularly?"\r\n\r\n"I believe what I now say to be true," said Dr. X----, "and I always\r\nendeavour to make truth popular."\r\n\r\n"But possibly these are only truths for ladies. Doctor X---- may be such\r\nan ungallant philosopher, as to think that some truths are not fit for\r\nladies. He may hold a different language with gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"I should not only be an ungallant but a weak philosopher," said Dr.\r\nX----, "if I thought that truth was not the same for all the world\r\nwho can understand it. And who can doubt Lady Delacour\'s being of that\r\nnumber?"\r\n\r\nLady Delacour, who, at the beginning of this conversation, had spoken\r\nguardedly, from the fear of lowering the doctor\'s opinion of her\r\nunderstanding, was put at her ease by the manner in which he now spoke;\r\nand, half laying aside the tone of raillery, she said to him, "Well,\r\ndoctor! seriously, I am not so _illiberal_ as to condemn _all_ chaplains\r\nfor one, odious as he was. But where to find his contrast in these\r\ndegenerate days? Can you, who are a defender of the faith, and so forth,\r\nassist me? Will you recommend a chaplain to my lord?"\r\n\r\n"Willingly," said Dr. X----; "and that is what I would not say for a\r\nworld of fees, unless I were sure of my man."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a man is he?"\r\n\r\n"Not a buck parson."\r\n\r\n"And I hope not a pedant, not a dogmatist, for that would be almost\r\nas bad. Before we domesticate another chaplain, I wish to know all his\r\nqualities, and to have a full and true description of him."\r\n\r\n"Shall I then give you a full and true description of him in the words\r\nof Chaucer?"\r\n\r\n"In any words you please. But Chaucer\'s chaplain must be a little\r\nold-fashioned by this time, I should think."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me. Some people, as well as some things, never grow\r\nold-fashioned. I should not be ashamed to produce Chaucer\'s parish\r\npriest at this day to the best company in England--I am not ashamed to\r\nproduce him to your ladyship; and if I can remember twenty lines in his\r\nfavour, I hope you will give me credit for being a sincere friend to the\r\nworthy part of the clergy. Observe, you must take them as I can patch\r\nthem together; I will not promise that I can recollect twenty lines _de\r\nsuite_, and without missing a word; that is what I would not swear to do\r\nfor His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury."\r\n\r\n"His Grace will probably excuse you from swearing; at least I will,"\r\nsaid Lady Delacour, "on the present occasion: so now for your twenty\r\nlines in whatever order you please."\r\n\r\nDoctor X----, with sundry intervals of recollection, which may be spared\r\nthe reader, repeated the following lines:\r\n\r\n    "Yet has his aspect nothing of severe,\r\n    But such a face as promised him sincere.\r\n    Nothing reserved or sullen was to see,\r\n    But sweet regards, and pleasing sanctity,\r\n    Mild was his accent, and his action free.\r\n    With eloquence innate his tongue was arm\'d,\r\n    Though harsh the precept, yet the preacher charm\'d;\r\n    For, letting down the golden chain from high,\r\n    He drew his audience upwards to the sky.\r\n    He taught the Gospel rather than the law,\r\n    And forced himself to drive, but loved to draw.\r\n    The tithes his parish freely paid, he took;\r\n    But never sued, or curs\'d with bell and book.\r\n    Wide was his parish, not contracted close\r\n    In streets--but here and there a straggling house.\r\n    Yet still he was at hand, without request,\r\n    To serve the sick, and succour the distressed.\r\n    The proud he tamed, the penitent he cheer\'d,\r\n    Nor to rebuke the rich offender fear\'d.\r\n    His preaching much, but more his practice wrought,\r\n    A living sermon of the truths he taught."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour wished that she could find a chaplain, who in any degree\r\nresembled this charming parish priest, and Dr. X----promised that he\r\nwould the next day introduce to her his friend Mr. Moreton.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moreton!" said Belinda, "the gentleman of whom Mr. Percival spoke,\r\nMrs. Freke\'s Mr. Moreton?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dr. X----, "the clergyman whom Mrs. Freke hanged in effigy,\r\nand to whom Clarence Hervey has given a small living."\r\n\r\nThese circumstances, even if he had not precisely resembled Chaucer\'s\r\ncharacter of a benevolent clergyman, would have strongly interested\r\nLady Delacour in his favour. She found him, upon farther acquaintance, a\r\nperfect contrast to her former chaplain; and he gradually acquired such\r\nsalutary influence over her mind, that he relieved her from the terrors\r\nof methodism, and in their place substituted the consolations of mild\r\nand rational piety.\r\n\r\nHer conscience was now at peace; her spirits were real and equable, and\r\nnever was her conversation so agreeable. Animated with the new feelings\r\nof returning health, and the new hopes of domestic happiness, she\r\nseemed desirous to impart her felicity to all around her, but chiefly\r\nto Belinda, who had the strongest claims upon her gratitude, and the\r\nwarmest place in her affections. Belinda never made her friend feel the\r\nweight of any obligation, and consequently Lady Delacour\'s gratitude\r\nwas a voluntary pleasure--not an expected duty. Nothing could be more\r\ndelightful to Miss Portman than thus to feel herself the object at once\r\nof esteem, affection, and respect; to see that she had not only been\r\nthe means of saving her friend\'s life, but that the influence she had\r\nobtained over her mind was likely to be so permanently beneficial both\r\nto her and to her family.\r\n\r\nBelinda did not take all the merit of this reformation to herself: she\r\nwas most willing to share it, in her own imagination, not only with Dr.\r\nX----and Mr. Moreton, but with poor Clarence Hervey. She was pleased to\r\nobserve that Lady Delacour never omitted any occasion of doing justice\r\nto his merit, and she loved her for that generosity, which sometimes\r\npassed the bounds of justice in her eulogiums. But Belinda was careful\r\nto preserve her consistency, and to guard her heart from the dangerous\r\neffect of these enthusiastic praises; and as Lady Delacour was now\r\nsufficiently re-established in her health, she announced her intention\r\nof returning immediately to Oakly-park, according to her promise to Lady\r\nAnne Percival and to Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear," said Lady Delacour, "one week more is all I ask from\r\nyou--may not friendship ask such a sacrifice from love?"\r\n\r\n"You expect, I know," said Miss Portman, ingenuously, "that before the\r\nend of that time Mr. Hervey will be here."\r\n\r\n"True. And have you no friendship for him?" said Lady Delacour with\r\nan arch smile, "or is friendship for every man in the creation,\r\none Augustus Vincent always excepted, prohibited by the statutes of\r\nOakly-park?"\r\n\r\n"By the statutes of Oakly-park nothing is forbidden," said Belinda, "but\r\nwhat reason--"\r\n\r\n"Reason! Oh, I have done if you go to reason! You are invulnerable to\r\nthe light shafts of wit, I know, when you are cased in this heavy armour\r\nof reason; Cupid himself may strain his bow, and exhaust his quiver\r\nupon you in vain. But have a care--you cannot live in armour all your\r\nlife--lay it aside but for a moment, and the little bold urchin will\r\nmake it his prize. Remember, in one of Raphael\'s pictures, Cupid\r\ncreeping into the armour of the conqueror of the world."\r\n\r\n"I am sufficiently aware," said Belinda, smiling, "of the power of\r\nCupid, and of his wiles. I would not brave his malice, but I will fly\r\nfrom it."\r\n\r\n"It is so cowardly to fly!"\r\n\r\n"Surely prudence, not courage, is the virtue of our sex; and seriously,\r\nmy dear Lady Delacour, I entreat you not to use your influence over my\r\nmind, lest you should lessen my happiness, though you cannot alter my\r\ndetermination."\r\n\r\nMoved by the earnest manner in which Belinda uttered these words, Lady\r\nDelacour rallied her no more, nor did she longer oppose her resolution\r\nof returning immediately to Oakly-park.\r\n\r\n"May I remind you," said Miss Portman, "though it is seldom either\r\npolitic or polite, to remind people of their promises,--but may I\r\nremind you of something like a promise you made, to accompany me to Mr.\r\nPercival\'s?"\r\n\r\n"And would you have me behave so brutally to poor Lord Delacour, as to\r\nrun away from him in this manner the moment I have strength to run?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Delacour is included in this invitation," said Miss Portman,\r\nputting the last letter that she had received from Lady Anne Percival\r\ninto her hands.\r\n\r\n"When I recollect," said Lady Delacour, as she looked over the letter,\r\n"how well this Lady Anne of yours has behaved to me about Helena, when\r\nI recollect, that, though you have been with her so long, she has not\r\nsupplanted me in your affections, and that she did not attempt to detain\r\nyou when I sent Marriott to Oakly-park, and when I consider how much for\r\nmy own advantage it will be to accept this invitation, I really cannot\r\nbring myself, from pride, or folly, or any other motive, to refuse it.\r\nSo, my dear Belinda, prevail upon Lord Delacour to spend his Christmas\r\nat Oakly-park, instead of at Studley-manor (Rantipole, thank Heaven! is\r\nout of the question), and prevail upon yourself to stay a few days for\r\nme, and you shall take us all with you in triumph."\r\n\r\nBelinda was convinced that, when Lady Delacour had once tasted the\r\npleasures of domestic life, she would not easily return to that\r\ndissipation which she had followed from habit, and into which she had\r\nfirst been driven by a mixture of vanity and despair. All the connexions\r\nwhich she had imprudently formed with numbers of fashionable but\r\nextravagant and thoughtless women would insensibly be broken off by\r\nthis measure; for Lady Delacour, who was already weary of their company,\r\nwould be so much struck with the difference between their insipid\r\nconversation and the animated and interesting society in Lady Anne\r\nPercival\'s family, that she would afterwards think them not only\r\nburdensome but intolerable. Lord Delacour\'s intimacy with Lord Studley\r\nwas one of his chief inducements to that intemperance, which injured\r\nalmost equally his constitution and his understanding: for some weeks\r\npast he had abstained from all excess, and Belinda was well aware, that,\r\nwhen the immediate motive of humanity to Lady Delacour ceased to act\r\nupon him, he would probably return to his former habits, if he continued\r\nto visit his former associates. It was therefore of importance to break\r\nat once his connexion with Lord Studley, and to place him in a situation\r\nwhere he might form new habits, and where his dormant talents might be\r\nroused to exertion. She was convinced that his understanding was not so\r\nmuch _below par_ as she had once been taught to think it: she perceived,\r\nalso, that since their reconciliation, Lady Delacour was anxious to\r\nmake him appear to advantage: whenever he said any thing that was worth\r\nhearing, she looked at Belinda with triumph; and whenever he happened to\r\nmake _a mistake_ in conversation, she either showed involuntary signs of\r\nuneasiness, or passed it off with that easy wit, by which she generally\r\nknew how "to make the worse appear the better reason." Miss Portman\r\nknew that Mr. Percival possessed the happy talent of drawing out all the\r\nabilities of those with whom he conversed, and that he did not value men\r\nmerely for their erudition, science, or literature; he was capable of\r\nestimating _the potential_ as well as _the actual range_ of the mind. Of\r\nhis generosity she could not doubt, and she was persuaded that he would\r\ntake every possible means which good nature, joined to good sense, could\r\nsuggest, to raise Lord Delacour in his lady\'s esteem, and to make that\r\nunion happy which was indissoluble. All these reflections passed with\r\nthe utmost rapidity in Belinda\'s mind, and the result of them was, that\r\nshe consented to wait Lady Delacour\'s leisure for her journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nPEU A PEU.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings were in this situation, when one day Marriott made her appearance\r\nat her lady\'s toilette with a face which at once proclaimed that\r\nsomething had discomposed her, and that she was impatient to be asked\r\nwhat it was.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, Marriott?" said Lady Delacour; "for I know you want\r\nme to ask."\r\n\r\n"Want you to ask! Oh, dear, my lady, no!--for I\'m sure, it\'s a thing\r\nthat goes quite against me to tell; for I thought, indeed, my lady,\r\n_superiorly_ of the person in question; so much so, indeed, that I\r\nwished what I declare I should now be ashamed to mention, especially in\r\nthe presence of Miss Portman, who deserves the best that this world can\r\nafford of every denomination. Well, ma\'am, in one word," continued she,\r\naddressing herself to Belinda, "I am extremely rejoiced that things are\r\nas they are, though I confess that was not always my wish or opinion,\r\nfor which I beg Mr. Vincent\'s pardon and yours; but I hope to be\r\nforgiven, since I\'m now come entirely round to my Lady Anne Percival\'s\r\nway of thinking, which I learnt from good authority at Oakly-park; and\r\nI am now convinced and confident, Miss Portman, that every thing is for\r\nthe best."\r\n\r\n"Marriott will inform us, in due course of time, what has thus suddenly\r\nand happily converted her," said Lady Delacour to Belinda, who was\r\nthrown into some surprise and confusion by Marriott\'s address; but\r\nMarriott went on with much warmth--\r\n\r\nDear me! I\'m sure I thought we had got rid of all double-dealers, when\r\nthe house was cleared of Mr. Champfort; but, oh, mercy! there\'s not\r\ntraps enough in the world for them all; I only wish they were all\r\ncaught as finely as some people were. "Tis what all double-dealers, and\r\nChampfort at the head of the whole regiment, deserve--that\'s certain."\r\n\r\n"We must take patience, my dear Belinda," said Lady Delacour, calmly,\r\n"till Marriott has exhausted all the expletives in and out of the\r\nEnglish language; and presently, when she has fought all her battles\r\nwith Champfort over again, we may hope to get at the fact."\r\n\r\n"Dear! my lady, it has nothing to do with Mr. Champfort, nor any such\r\nstyle of personage, I can assure you; for, I\'m positive, I\'d rather\r\nthink contemptibly of a hundred million Mr. Champforts than of one such\r\ngentleman as Mr. Clarence Hervey."\r\n\r\n"Clarence Hervey!" exclaimed Lady Delacour: taking it for granted that\r\nBelinda blushed, her ladyship, with superfluous address, instantly\r\nturned, so as to hide her friend\'s face from Mrs. Marriott. "Well,\r\nMarriott, what of Mr. Hervey?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my lady, something you\'ll be surprised to hear, and Miss Portman,\r\ntoo. It is not, by any means, that I am more of a prude than is\r\nbecoming, my lady: nor that I take upon me to be so innocent as not to\r\nknow that young gentlemen of fortune will, if it be only for fashion\'s\r\nsake, have such things as kept mistresses (begging pardon for mentioning\r\nsuch trash); but no one that has lived in the world thinks any thing of\r\nthat, except," added she, catching a glimpse of Belinda\'s countenance,\r\n"except, to be sure, ma\'am, morally speaking, it\'s very wicked and\r\nshocking, and makes one blush before company, till one\'s used to it,\r\nand ought certainly to be put down by act of parliament, ma\'am; but, my\r\nlady, you know, in point of surprising any body, or being discreditable\r\nin a young gentleman of Mr. Hervey\'s fortune and pretensions, it would\r\nbe mere envy and scandal to deem it any thing--worth mentioning."\r\n\r\n"Then, for mercy\'s sake, or mine," said Lady Delacour, "go on to\r\nsomething that is worth mentioning."\r\n\r\n"Well, my lady, you must know, then, that yesterday I wanted some\r\nhempseed for my bullfinch--Miss Helena\'s bullfinch, I mean; for it was\r\nshe found it by accident, you know, Miss Portman, the day after we came\r\nhere. Poor thing! it got itself so entangled in the net over the morello\r\ncherry tree, in the garden, that it could neither get itself in nor out;\r\nbut very luckily Miss Helena saw it, and saved, and brought it in: it\r\nwas almost dead, my lady."\r\n\r\n"Was it?--I mean I am very sorry for it: that is what you expect me to\r\nsay. Now, go on--get us once past the bullfinch, or tell us what it has\r\nto do with Clarence Hervey."\r\n\r\n"That is what I am aiming at, as fast as possible, my lady. So I sent\r\nfor some hempseed for the bullfinch, and along with the hempseed they\r\nbrought me wrapped round it, as it were, a printed handbill, as it might\r\nbe, or advertisement, which I threw off, disregardingly, taking for\r\ngranted it might have been some of those advertisements for lozenges or\r\nrazor-strops, that meet one wherever one goes; but Miss Delacour picked\r\nit up, and found it was a kind of hue and cry after a stolen or strayed\r\nbullfinch. Ma\'am, I was so provoked, I could have cried, when I learnt\r\nit was the exact description of our little Bobby to a feather--gray upon\r\nthe back, and red on----"\r\n\r\n"Oh! spare me the description to a feather. Well, you took the bird,\r\nbullfinch, or Bobby, as you call it, home to its rightful owner, I\r\npresume? Let me get you so far on your way."\r\n\r\n"No, I beg your pardon, my lady, that is not the thing."\r\n\r\n"Then you did not take the bird home to its owner--and you are a\r\nbird-stealer? With all my heart: be a dog-stealer, if you will--only go\r\non."\r\n\r\n"But, my lady, you hurry me so, it puts every thing topsy-turvy in my\r\nhead; I could tell it as fast as possible my own way."\r\n\r\n"Do so, then."\r\n\r\n"I was ready to cry, when I found our little Bobby was claimed from\r\nus, to be sure; but Miss Delacour observed, that those with whom it\r\nhad lived till it was grey must be sorrier still to part with it: so I\r\nresolved to do the honest and genteel thing by the lady who advertised\r\nfor it, and to take it back myself, and to refuse the five guineas\r\nreward offered. The lady\'s name, according to the advertisement, was\r\nOrmond."\r\n\r\n"Ormond!" repeated Lady Delacour, looking eagerly at Belinda: "was not\r\nthat the name Sir Philip Baddely mentioned to us--you remember?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Ormond was the name, as well as I recollect," said Belinda, with\r\na degree of steady composure that provoked her ladyship. "Go on,\r\nMarriott."\r\n\r\n"And the words were, to leave the bird at a perfumer\'s in Twickenham,\r\nopposite to ----; but that\'s no matter. Well, my lady, to the perfumer\'s\r\nI went with the bird, this morning. Now, I had my reasons for wishing\r\nto see this Mrs. Ormond myself, because, my lady, there was one thing\r\nrather remarkable about this bullfinch, that it sings a very particular\r\ntune, which I never heard any bullfinch, or any human creature, sing\r\nanything like before: so I determined, in my own cogitations, to ask\r\nthis Mrs. Ormond to name the tunes her bullfinch could sing, before I\r\nproduced it; and if she made no mention of its knowing any one out of\r\nthe common way, I resolved to keep my bird to myself, as I might very\r\nconscientiously and genteelly too. So, my lady, when I got to the\r\nperfumer\'s, I inquired where Mrs. Ormond was to be found? I was told\r\nthat she received no visits from any, at least from the female sex; and\r\nthat I must leave the bird there till called for. I was considering what\r\nto do, and the strangeness of the information made about the female sex,\r\nwhen in there came, into the shop, a gentleman, who saved me all the\r\nindelicacy of asking particulars. The bullfinch was at this time piping\r\naway at a fine rate, and, as luck would have it, that very remarkable\r\nstrange tune that I mentioned to you. Says the gentleman, as he came\r\ninto the shop, fixing his eyes on the bullfinch as if they would have\r\ncome fairly out of his head, \'How did that bird come here?\'--\'I brought\r\nit here, sir,\' said I. Then he began to offer me mountains of gold in a\r\nvery strange way, if I could tell him any tidings of the lady to whom\r\nit belonged. The shopman from behind the counter now bent forward, and\r\nwhispered the gentleman that he could give him some information, if he\r\nwould make it worth his while; and they both went together to a little\r\nparlour behind the shop, and I saw no more of them. But, my lady, very\r\nopportunely for me, that was dying with curiosity, out of the parlour\r\nthey turned a young woman in, to attend the shop, who proved to be an\r\nacquaintance of mine, whom I had done some little favours to when in\r\nservice in London. And this young woman, when I told her my distress\r\nabout the advertisement and the bullfinch, let me into the whole of the\r\naffair. \'Ma\'am,\' said she, \'all that is known about Mrs. Ormond, in\r\nthis house, or any where else, is from me; so there was no occasion for\r\nturning me out of the parlour. I lived with Mrs. Ormond, ma\'am,"\r\nsays she, "\'for half a year, in the very house she now occupies, and\r\nconsequently nobody can be better informed than I am:\'--to which I\r\nagreed. Then she told me that the reason that Mrs. Ormond never saw any\r\ncompany of any sort was, because she is not fit to see company--proper\r\ncompany--for she\'s not a proper woman. She has a most beautiful young\r\ncreature there, shut up, who has been seduced, and is now deserted in a\r\nmost cruel manner by a Mr. Hervey. Oh, my lady! how the name struck\r\nupon my ear! I hoped, however, it was not our Mr. Hervey; but it was the\r\nidentical Mr. Clarence Hervey. I made the young woman describe him,\r\nfor she had often and often seen him, when he visited the unfortunate\r\ncreature; and the description could suit none but our Mr. Hervey, and\r\nbesides it put it beyond a doubt, she told me his linen was all marked\r\nC. H. So our Mr. Hervey, ma\'am," added Marriott, turning to Belinda, "it\r\ncertainly proved to be, to my utter dismay and confusion."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Marriott! my poor head!" exclaimed Lady Delacour, starting from\r\nunder her hands: "that cruel comb went at least half an inch into my\r\nhead--heads have feeling as well as hearts, believe me." And, as she\r\nspoke, she snatched out the comb with which Marriott had just fastened\r\nup her hair, and flung it on a sofa at some yards\' distance. While\r\nMarriott went to fetch it, Lady Delacour thought that Belinda would\r\nhave time to recover from that utter dismay and confusion into which she\r\nhoped that she must now be thrown. "Come, Marriott, make haste. I\r\nhave done _you_ at least a great favour, for you have all this hair to\r\nperform upon again, and you will have leisure to finish this story\r\nof yours--which, at all events, if it is not in any other respect\r\nwonderful, we must allow is wonderfully long."\r\n\r\n"Well, my lady, to be short, then--I was more curious than ever, when\r\nI heard all this, to hear more; and asked my friend how she could ever\r\nthink of staying in a house with ladies of such a description! Upon\r\nwhich she justified herself by assuring me, upon her honour, that at\r\nfirst she believed the young lady was married privately to Mr. Hervey,\r\nfor that a clergyman came in secret, and read prayers, and she verily\r\nbelieves that the unfortunate young creature was deceived barbarously,\r\nand made to fancy herself married to all intents and purposes, till\r\nall at once Mr. Hervey threw off the mask, and left off visiting her,\r\npretending a necessity to take a journey, and handing her over to that\r\nvile woman, that Mrs. Ormond, who bid her to be comforted, and all the\r\nthings that are said by such women, on such occasions, by all accounts.\r\nBut the poor deluded young thing saw how it was now too plain, and she\r\nwas ready to break her heart; but not in a violent, common sort of way,\r\nma\'am, but in silent grief, pining and drooping. My friend could not\r\nstand the sight, nor endure to look upon Mrs. Ormond now she knew\r\nwhat she was; and so she left the house, without giving any reason,\r\nimmediately. I forgot to mention, that the unfortunate girl\'s maiden\r\nname was St. Pierre, my lady: but her Christian name, which was rather\r\nan out o\' the way name, I quite forget."\r\n\r\n"No matter," said Lady Delacour; "we can live without it; or we can\r\nimagine it."\r\n\r\n"To be sure--I beg pardon; such sort of people\'s names can\'t be of any\r\nconsequence, and, I\'m sure, I blame myself now for going to the house,\r\nafter all I had heard."\r\n\r\n"You did go to the house, then?"\r\n\r\n"To my shame be it spoken; my curiosity got the better of me, and I\r\nwent---but only on account of the bullfinch in the eyes of the world. It\r\nwas a great while before I could get in: but I was so firm, that I would\r\nnot give up the bird to no one but the lady herself, that I got in at\r\nlast. Oh, never did my eyes light upon so beautiful a creature, nor so\r\ngraceful, nor so innocent to look at!"--Belinda sighed--Marriott echoed\r\nthe sigh, and continued "She was by herself, and in tears, when I was\r\nshown in, ma\'am, and she started as if she had never seen any body\r\nbefore in her life. But when she saw the bullfinch, ma\'am, she clapped\r\nher hands, and, smiling through her tears like a child, she ran up to\r\nme, and thanked me again and again, kissing the bird between times, and\r\nputting it into her bosom. Well, I declare, if she had talked to all\r\neternity, she could never have made me pity her half so much as all this\r\ndid, for it looked so much like innocence. I\'m sure, nobody that was\r\nnot--or, at least, that did not think themselves innocent, could have\r\nsuch ways, and such an innocent affection for a little bird. Not but\r\nwhat I know ladies of a certain description often have birds, but then\r\ntheir fondness is all affectation and fashion; but this poor thing was\r\nall nature. Ah! poor unfortunate girl, thought I--but it\'s no matter\r\nwhat I thought now," said Marriott, shutting her eyes, to hide the tears\r\nthat came into them at this instant; "I was ashamed of myself, when I\r\nsaw Mrs. Ormond just then come into the room, which made me recollect\r\nwhat sort of company I was in. La! my lady, how I detested the sight\r\nof her! She looked at me, too, more like a dragon than any thing else;\r\nthough in a civil way, and as if she was frightened out of her wits,\r\nshe asked Miss St. Pierre, as she called her, how I had got in (in a\r\nwhisper), and she made all sorts of signs afterward to her, to go out\r\nof the room. Never having been in such a situation before, I was quite\r\nrobbed of all fluency, and could not--what with the anger I felt for the\r\none, and sorrow for the other--get out a word of common sense, or even\r\nrecollect what pretence brought me into the room, till the bird very\r\nluckily put it into my head by beginning to sing; so then I asked,\r\nwhether they could certify it to be theirs by any particular tune of its\r\nown? \'Oh, yes,\' said Miss St. Pierre; and she sung the very same tune. I\r\nnever heard so sweet a voice; but, poor thing, something came across her\r\nmind in the middle of it, and she stopped; but she thanked me again for\r\nbringing back the bird, which, she said, had been hers for a great\r\nmany years, and that she loved it dearly. I stood, I believe, like one\r\nstupified, till I was roused by _the woman\'s_ offering to put the five\r\nguineas reward, mentioned in the advertisement, into my hand. The touch\r\nof her gold made me start, as if it had been a snake, and I pushed it\r\nfrom me; and when she pressed it again, I threw it on the table, scarce\r\nknowing what I did; and just then, in her iniquitous hand, I saw a\r\nletter, directed to Clarence Hervey, Esq. Oh, how I hated the sight of\r\nhis name, and every thing belonging to him, ma\'am, at that minute!\r\nI\'m sure, I could not have kept myself from saying something quite\r\noutrageous, if I had not taken myself out of the house, as I did, that\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n"When there are women enough born and bred good for nothing, and ladies\r\nenough to flirt with, that would desire no better, that a gentleman like\r\nMr. Clarence Hervey, ma\'am, should set his wits, as one may say, to\r\nbe the ruin of such a sweet, innocent-looking young creature, and then\r\ndesert her in that barbarous way, after bringing a clergyman to deceive\r\nher with a mock ceremony, and all--oh! there is no fashion, nor nothing\r\ncan countenance such wickedness! \'tis the worst of wickedness and\r\ncruelty--and I shall think and say so to the latest hour of my life."\r\n\r\n"Well said, Marriott," cried Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"And now you know the reason, ma\'am," added Marriott, "that I said,\r\nI was glad _things are as they are_. To be sure I and every body once\r\nthought--but that\'s all over now--and I am glad _things are as they\r\nare_."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour once more turned her quick eyes upon Belinda, and was\r\nmuch pleased to see that she seemed to sympathize with Marriott\'s\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when they were alone, Lady Delacour touched upon\r\nthe subject again, and observed, that as they should now, in all\r\nprobability, see Mr. Hervey in a few days, they might be able to form\r\na better judgment of this affair, which she doubted not had been\r\nexaggerated. "You should judge from the whole of Clarence\'s conduct and\r\ncharacter, and not from any particular part," said her ladyship. "Do not\r\nhis letters breathe a spirit of generosity?"\r\n\r\n"But," interrupted Miss Portman, "I am not called upon to judge of Mr.\r\nHervey\'s whole conduct and character, nor of any part of it; his letters\r\nand his generosity are nothing--"\r\n\r\n"To you?" said Lady Delacour with a smile.\r\n\r\n"This is no time, and no subject for raillery, my dear friend," said\r\nBelinda; "you assured me, and I believed you, that the idea of Mr.\r\nHervey\'s return was entirely out of the question, when you prevailed\r\nupon me to delay my journey to Oakly-park. As I now understand that your\r\nladyship has changed your mind, I must request your ladyship will permit\r\nme--"\r\n\r\n"I will permit you to do what you please, dearest Belinda, except\r\nto call me _your ladyship_ twice in one sentence. You shall go to\r\nOakly-park the day after to-morrow: will that content you, my dear? I\r\nadmire your strength of mind--you are much fitter to conduct yourself\r\nthan I am to conduct you. I have done with raillery: my first, my only\r\nobject, is your happiness. I respect and esteem as much as I love you,\r\nand I love you better than any thing upon earth--power excepted, you\r\nwill say--power not excepted, believe me; and if you are one of those\r\nstrange people that cannot believe without proof, you shall have proof\r\npositive upon the spot," added she, ringing the bell as she spoke. "I\r\nwill no longer contend for power over your mind with your friends\r\nat Oakly-park. I will give orders, in your presence, to Marriott, to\r\nprepare for our march--I did not call it retreat; but there is nothing\r\nshows so much generalship as a good retreat, unless it be a great\r\nvictory. I am, I confess, rather prejudiced in favour of victory."\r\n\r\n"So am I," said Belinda, with a smile; "I am so strongly prejudiced in\r\nfavour of victory, that rather than obtain no other, I would even be\r\ncontent with a victory over myself."\r\n\r\nScarcely had Belinda pronounced these words, when Lord Delacour, who had\r\ndined in town, entered the room, accompanied by Mr. Vincent.\r\n\r\n"Give me leave, Lady Delacour, to introduce to you," said his\r\nlordship, "a young gentleman, who has a great, and, I am sure, a most\r\ndisinterested desire to cultivate your ladyship\'s further acquaintance."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour received him with all the politeness imaginable; and even\r\nher prepossessions in favour of Clarence Hervey could not prevent her\r\nfrom being struck with his appearance. Il a infiniment l\'air d\'un heros\r\nde roman, thought she, and Belinda is not quite so great a philosopher\r\nas I imagined. In due time her ladyship recollected that she had orders\r\nto give to Marriott about her journey, that made it absolutely necessary\r\nshe should leave Miss Portman to entertain Mr. Vincent, if possible,\r\nwithout her, for a few minutes; and Lord Delacour departed, contenting\r\nhimself with the usual excuse of--_letters to write_.\r\n\r\n"I ought to be delighted with your gallantry, Mr. Vincent," said\r\nBelinda, "in travelling so many miles, to remind me of my promise about\r\nOakly-park; but on the contrary, I am sorry you have taken so much\r\nunnecessary trouble: Lady Delacour is, at this instant, preparing\r\nfor our journey to Mr. Percival\'s. We intend to set out the day after\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I am heartily glad of it--I shall be infinitely overpaid for my\r\njourney, by having the pleasure of going back with you."\r\n\r\nAfter some conversation upon different subjects, Mr. Vincent, with an\r\nair of frankness which was peculiarly pleasing to Belinda, put into her\r\nhands an anonymous letter, which he had received the preceding day.\r\n\r\n"It is not worth your reading," said he; "but I know you too well to\r\nfear that it should give you any pain; and I hope you know me too well,\r\nto apprehend that it could make any impression on my mind."\r\n\r\nBelinda read with some surprise:--\r\n\r\n"Rash young man! beware of connecting yourself with the lady to whom you\r\nhave lately been drawn in to pay your addresses: she is the most artful\r\nof women. She has been educated, as you may find upon inquiry, by one,\r\nwhose successful trade it has been to draw in young men of fortune for\r\nher nieces, whence she has obtained the appellation of _the match-maker\r\ngeneral_. The only niece whom she could not get rid of any other way,\r\nshe sent to the most dissipated and unprincipled viscountess in town.\r\nThe viscountess fell sick, and, as it was universally reported last\r\nwinter, the young lady was immediately, upon her friend\'s death, to have\r\nbeen married to the viscount widower. But the viscountess detected the\r\nconnexion, and the young lady, to escape from her friend\'s rage, and\r\nfrom public shame, was obliged to retreat to certain shades in the\r\nneighbourhood of Harrowgate; where she passed herself for a saint upon\r\nthose who were too honourable themselves to be suspicious of others.\r\n\r\n"At length the quarrel between her and the viscountess was made up, by\r\nher address and boldness in declaring, that if she was not recalled, she\r\nwould divulge some secrets respecting a certain mysterious boudoir in\r\nher ladyship\'s house: this threat terrified the viscountess, who sent\r\noff express for her late discarded humble companion. The quarrel\r\nwas hushed up, and the young lady is now with her noble friend at\r\nTwickenham. The person who used to be let up the private stairs into\r\nthe boudoir, by Mrs. Marriott, is now more conveniently received at\r\nTwickenham."\r\n\r\nMuch more was said by the letter-writer in the same strain. The name\r\nof Clarence Hervey, in the last page, caught Belinda\'s eye; and with a\r\ntrepidation which she did not feel at the beginning of this epistle, she\r\nread the conclusion.\r\n\r\n"The viscount is not supposed to have been unrivalled in the young\r\nlady\'s favour. A young gentleman, of large fortune, great talents,\r\nand uncommon powers of pleasing, has, for some months, been her secret\r\nobject; but he has been prudent enough to escape her matrimonial snares,\r\nthough he carries on a correspondence with her, through the means of her\r\nfriend the viscountess, to whom he privately writes. The noble lady has\r\nbargained to make over to her confidante all her interest in Hervey\'s\r\nheart. He is expected every day to return from his tour; and, if the\r\nschemes upon him can be brought to bear, the promised return to the\r\nneighbourhood of Harrowgate will never be thought of. Mr. Vincent will\r\nbe left in the lurch; he will not even have the lady\'s fair hand--her\r\n_fair_ heart is Clarence Hervey\'s, at all events. Further particulars\r\nshall be communicated to Mr. Vincent, if he pays due attention to this\r\nwarning from\r\n\r\n"A SINCERE FRIEND."\r\n\r\nAs soon as Belinda had finished this curious production, she thanked Mr.\r\nVincent, with more kindness than she had ever before shown him, for the\r\nconfidence he placed in her, and for the openness with which he treated\r\nher. She begged his permission to show this letter to Lady Delacour,\r\nthough he had previously dreaded the effect which it might have upon her\r\nladyship\'s feelings.\r\n\r\nHer first exclamation was, "This is one of Harriot Freke\'s frolics;" but\r\nas her ladyship\'s indignation against Mrs. Freke had long since subsided\r\ninto utter contempt, she did not waste another thought upon the writer\r\nof this horrible letter; but instantly the whole energy of her mind\r\nand fire of her eloquence burst forth in an eulogium upon her friend.\r\nCareless of all that concerned herself, she explained, without a\r\nmoment\'s hesitation, every thing that could exalt Belinda: she described\r\nall the difficult circumstances in which her friend had been placed; she\r\nmentioned the secret with which she had been intrusted; the honour\r\nwith which, even at the hazard of her own reputation, she had kept\r\nher promise of secrecy inviolable, when Lord Delacour, in a fit of\r\nintoxication and jealousy, had endeavoured to wrest from Marriott the\r\nkey of _the mysterious boudoir_. She confessed her own absurd jealousy,\r\nexplained how it had been excited by the artifices of Champfort and Sir\r\nPhilip Baddely, how slight circumstances had worked her mind up almost\r\nto frenzy. "The temper, the dignity, the gentleness, the humanity, with\r\nwhich Belinda bore with me, during this paroxysm of madness," said Lady\r\nDelacour, "I never can forget; nor the spirit with which she left my\r\nhouse, when she saw me unworthy of her esteem, and ungrateful for her\r\nkindness; nor the magnanimity with which she returned to me, when I\r\nthought myself upon my death-bed: all this has made an impression upon\r\nmy soul, which never, whilst I have life and reason, can be effaced. She\r\nhas saved my life. She has made my life worth saving. She has made\r\nme feel my own value. She has made me know my own happiness. She has\r\nreconciled me to my husband. She has united me with my child. She has\r\nbeen my guardian angel.--_She_, the confidante of my intrigues!--_she_\r\nleagued with me in vice!--No, I am bound to her by ties stronger\r\nthan vice ever felt; than vice, even in the utmost ingenuity of its\r\ndepravity, can devise."\r\n\r\nExhausted by the vehemence with which she had spoken, Lady Delacour\r\npaused; but Vincent, who sympathized in her enthusiasm, kept his eyes\r\nfixed upon her, in hopes that she had yet more to say.\r\n\r\n"I might, perhaps, you will think," continued she, smiling, "have spared\r\nyou this history of myself, and of my own affairs, Mr. Vincent; but\r\nI thought it necessary to tell you the plain facts, which malice has\r\ndistorted into the most odious form. This is the quarrel, this is\r\nthe reconciliation, of which your anonymous friend has been so well\r\ninformed. Now, as to Clarence Hervey."\r\n\r\n"I have explained to Mr. Vincent," interrupted Belinda, "every thing\r\nthat he could wish to know on that subject, and I now wish you to tell\r\nhim that I faithfully remembered my promise to return to Oakly-park, and\r\nthat we were actually preparing for the journey."\r\n\r\n"Look here, sir," cried Lady Delacour, opening the door of her\r\ndressing-room, in which Marriott was upon her knees, locking a trunk,\r\n"here\'s dreadful note of preparation."\r\n\r\n"You are a happier man than you yet know, Mr. Vincent," continued Lady\r\nDelacour; "for I can tell you, that some persuasion, some raillery, and\r\nsome wit, I flatter myself, have been used, to detain Miss Portman from\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"From Oakly-park," interrupted Belinda.\r\n\r\n"From Oakly-park, &c. a few days longer. Shall I be frank with you, Mr.\r\nVincent?--Yes, for I cannot help it--I am not of the nature of anonymous\r\nletter-writers; I cannot, either secretly or publicly, sign or say\r\nmyself a _sincere friend_, without being one to the utmost extent of\r\nmy influence. I never give my vote without my interest, nor my interest\r\nwithout my vote. Now Clarence Hervey is my friend. Start not at all,\r\nsir,--you have no reason; for if he is my friend, Miss Portman is yours:\r\nwhich has the better bargain? But, as I was going to tell you, Mr.\r\nClarence Hervey is my friend, and I am his. My vote, interest, and\r\ninfluence, have consequently been all in his favour. I had reason to\r\nbelieve that he has long admired _the dignity_ of Miss Portman\'s _mind,\r\nand the simplicity of her character_," continued her ladyship, with an\r\narch look at Belinda; "and though he was too much a man of genius to\r\nbegin with the present tense of the indicative mood, \'I love,\' yet I\r\nwas, and am, convinced, that he does love her."\r\n\r\n"Can you, dear Lady Delacour," cried Belinda, "speak in this manner, and\r\nrecollect all we heard from Marriott this morning? And to what purpose\r\nall this?"\r\n\r\n"To what purpose, my dear? To convince your friend, Mr. Vincent, that I\r\nam neither fool nor knave; but that I deal fairly by you, by him, and\r\nby all the world. Mr. Hervey\'s conduct towards Miss Portman has, I\r\nacknowledge, sir, been undecided. Some circumstances have lately come\r\nto my knowledge which throw doubts upon his honour and integrity--doubts\r\nwhich, I firmly believe, he will clear up to _my_ satisfaction at\r\nleast, as soon as I see him, or as soon as it is in his power; with this\r\nconviction, and believing, as I do, that no man upon earth is so well\r\nsuited to my friend,--pardon me, Mr. Vincent, if my wishes differ from\r\nyours: though my sincerity may give you present, it may save you from\r\nfuture, pain."\r\n\r\n"Your ladyship\'s sincerity, whatever pain it may give me, I admire,"\r\nsaid Mr. Vincent, with some pride in his manner; "but I see that I must\r\ndespair of the honour of your ladyship\'s congratulations."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," interrupted Lady Delacour; "there you are quite mistaken:\r\nthe man of Belinda\'s choice _must_ receive my congratulations; he must\r\ndo more--he must become my friend I would never rest till I had won his\r\nregard, nor should I in the least be apprehensive that he would not have\r\nsufficient greatness of mind to forgive my having treated him with a\r\ndegree of sincerity which the common forms of politeness cannot justify,\r\nand at which common souls would be scandalized past recovery."\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent\'s pride was entirely vanquished by this speech; and with\r\nthat frankness by which his manners were usually characterized, he\r\nthanked her for having distinguished him from _common souls_; and\r\nassured her that such sincerity as hers was infinitely more to his\r\ntaste than that refined politeness of which he was aware no one was more\r\nperfect mistress than Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\nHere their conversation ended, and Mr. Vincent, as it was now late, took\r\nhis leave.\r\n\r\n"Really, my dear Belinda," said Lady Delacour, when he was gone, "I am\r\nnot surprised at your impatience to return to Oakly-park; I am not so\r\npartial to my knight, as to compare him, in personal accomplishments,\r\nwith your hero. I acknowledge, also, that there is something vastly\r\nprepossessing in the frankness of his manners; he has behaved admirably\r\nwell about this abominable letter; but, what is better than all in a\r\nlady\'s eyes he is _eperdument amoureux_."\r\n\r\n"Not _eperdument_, I hope," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Then, as you do not think it necessary for your hero to be _eperdument\r\namoureux_, I presume," said Lady Delacour, "you do not think it\r\nnecessary that a heroine should be in love at all. So love and marriage\r\nare to be separated by philosophy, as well as by fashion. This is Lady\r\nAnne Percival\'s doctrine! I give Mr. Percival joy. I remember the time,\r\nwhen he fancied love essential to happiness."\r\n\r\n"I believe he not only fancies, but is sure of it now, from experience,"\r\nsaid Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Then he interdicts love only to his friends? He does not think it\r\nessential that you should know any thing about the matter. You may marry\r\nhis ward, and welcome, without being in love with him."\r\n\r\n"But not without loving him," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"I am not casuist enough in these matters to understand the subtle\r\ndistinction you make, with the true Percival emphasis, between loving\r\nand falling in love. But I suppose I am to understand by loving, loving\r\nas half the world do when they marry."\r\n\r\n"As it would be happy for half the world if they did," replied Belinda,\r\nmildly, but with a firmness of tone that her ladyship felt. "I should\r\ndespise myself and deserve no pity from any human being, if, after all I\r\nhave seen, I could think of marrying for convenience or interest."\r\n\r\n"Oh! pardon me; I meant not to insinuate such an idea: even your worst\r\nenemy, Sir Philip Baddely, would acquit you there. I meant but to hint,\r\nmy dear Belinda, that a heart such as yours is formed for love in its\r\nhighest, purest, happiest state."\r\n\r\nA pause ensued.\r\n\r\n"Such happiness can be secured only," resumed Belinda, "by a union with\r\na man of sense and virtue."\r\n\r\n"A man of sense and virtue, I suppose, means Mr. Vincent," said Lady\r\nDelacour: "no doubt you have lately learned in the same sober style that\r\na little love will suffice with a great deal of esteem."\r\n\r\n"I hope I have learned lately that a great deal of esteem is the best\r\nfoundation for a great deal of love."\r\n\r\n"Possibly," said Lady Delacour; "but we often see people working at the\r\nfoundation all their lives without getting any farther."\r\n\r\n"And those who build their castles of happiness in the air," said\r\nBelinda, "are they more secure, wiser, or happier?"\r\n\r\n"Wiser! I know nothing about that," said Lady Delacour; "but happier\r\nI do believe they are; for the castle-building is always a _labour of\r\nlove_, but the foundation of drudgery is generally _love\'s labour lost_.\r\nPoor Vincent will find it so."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," said Belinda; "for already his solid good qualities--"\r\n\r\n"Solid good qualities!" interrupted Lady Delacour: "I beg your pardon\r\nfor interrupting you, but, my dear, you know we never fall in love with\r\ngood qualities, except, indeed, when they are joined to an aquiline\r\nnose--oh! that aquiline nose of Mr. Vincent\'s! I am more afraid of it\r\nthan of all his solid good qualities. He has again, I acknowledge it,\r\nmuch the advantage of Clarence Hervey in personal accomplishments. But\r\nyou are not a woman to be decided by personal accomplishments."\r\n\r\n"And you will not allow me to be decided by solid good qualities," said\r\nBelinda. "So by what must I be determined?"\r\n\r\n"By your heart, my dear; by your heart: trust your heart only."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said Belinda, "how many, many women have deplored their having\r\ntrusted to their hearts only."\r\n\r\n"_Their_ hearts! but I said _your_ heart: mind your pronouns, my dear;\r\nthat makes all the difference. But, to be serious, tell me, do you\r\nreally and _bona fide_, as my old uncle the lawyer used to say, love Mr.\r\nVincent?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Belinda, "I do not love him yet."\r\n\r\n"But for that emphatic _yet_, how I should have worshipped you! I wish I\r\ncould once clearly understand the state of your mind about Mr. Vincent,\r\nand then I should be able to judge how far I might indulge myself in\r\nraillery without being absolutely impertinent. So without intruding upon\r\nyour confidence, tell me whatever you please."\r\n\r\n"I will tell you all I know of my own mind," replied Belinda, looking up\r\nwith an ingenuous countenance. "I esteem Mr. Vincent; I am grateful\r\nto him for the proofs he has given me of steady attachment, and of\r\nconfidence in my integrity. I like his manners and the frankness of\r\nhis temper; but I do not yet love him, and till I do, no earthly\r\nconsideration could prevail upon me to marry him."\r\n\r\n"Perfectly satisfactory, my dear Belinda; and yet I cannot be quite\r\nat ease whilst Mr. Vincent is present, and my poor Clarence absent:\r\nproximity is such a dangerous advantage even with the wisest of us. The\r\nabsent lose favour so quickly in Cupid\'s court, as in all other courts;\r\nand they are such victims to false reports and vile slanderers!"\r\n\r\nBelinda sighed.\r\n\r\n"Thank you for that sigh, my dear," said Lady Delacour. "May I ask,\r\nwould you, if you discovered that Mr. Vincent had a Virginia, discard\r\nhim for ever from your thoughts?"\r\n\r\n"If I discovered that he had deceived and behaved dishonourably to any\r\nwoman, I certainly should banish him for ever from my regard."\r\n\r\n"With as much ease as you banished Clarence Hervey?"\r\n\r\n"With more, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Then you acknowledge--that\'s all I want--that you liked Clarence better\r\nthan you do Vincent?"\r\n\r\n"I acknowledge it," said Belinda, colouring up to her temples; "but that\r\ntime is entirely past, and I never look back to it."\r\n\r\n"But if you were forced to look back to it, my dear,--if Clarence Hervey\r\nproposed for you,--would not you cast a lingering look behind?"\r\n\r\n"Let me beg of you, my dear Lady Delacour, as my friend," cried Belinda,\r\nspeaking and looking with great earnestness; "let me beg of you to\r\nforbear. Do not use your powerful influence over my heart to make me\r\nthink of what I ought not to think, or do what I ought not to do. I have\r\npermitted Mr. Vincent to address me. You cannot imagine that I am so\r\nbase as to treat him with duplicity, or that I consider him only as a\r\n_pis-aller_; no--I have treated, I will treat him honourably. He knows\r\nexactly the state of my mind. He shall have a fair trial whether he can\r\nwin my love; the moment I am convinced that he cannot succeed, I will\r\ntell him so decidedly: but if ever I should feel for him that affection\r\nwhich is necessary for my happiness and his, I hope I shall without\r\nfear, even of Lady Delacour\'s ridicule or displeasure, avow my\r\nsentiments, and abide by my choice."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I admire you," said Lady Delacour; "but I am incorrigible;\r\nI am not fit to hear myself convinced. After all, I am impelled by the\r\ngenius of imprudence to tell you, that, in spite of Mr. Percival\'s cure\r\nfor _first loves_, I consider love as a distemper that can be had but\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"As you acknowledge that you are not fit to hear yourself convinced,"\r\nsaid Belinda, "I will not argue this point with you."\r\n\r\n"But you will allow," said Lady Delacour, "as it is said or sung in\r\nCupid\'s calendar, that--\r\n\r\n    \'Un peu d\'amour, un peu de soin,\r\n    Menent souvent un coeur bien loin;\'"\r\n\r\nand she broke off the conversation by singing that beautiful French air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nLOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only interest that honest people can take in the fate of rogues\r\nis in their detection and punishment; the reader, then, will be so far\r\ninterested in the fate of Mr. Champfort, as to feel some satisfaction at\r\nhis being safely lodged in Newgate. The circumstance which led to this\r\ndesirable catastrophe was the anonymous letter to Mr. Vincent. From\r\nthe first moment that Marriott saw or heard of the letter, she was\r\nconvinced, she said, that "Mr. Champfort _was at the bottom of it_."\r\nLady Delacour was equally convinced that Harriot Freke was the author of\r\nthe epistle; and she supported her opinion by observing, that Champfort\r\ncould neither write nor spell English. Marriott and her lady were both\r\nright. It was a joint, or rather a triplicate performance. Champfort, in\r\nconjunction with the stupid maid, furnished the intelligence, which Mrs.\r\nFreke manufactured; and when she had put the whole into proper style and\r\nform, Mr. Champfort got her rough draught fairly copied at his leisure,\r\nand transmitted his copy to Mr. Vincent. Now all this was discovered by\r\na very slight circumstance. The letter was copied by Mr. Champfort upon\r\na sheet of mourning paper, off which he thought that he had carefully\r\ncut the edges; but one bit of the black edge remained, which did not\r\nescape Marriott\'s scrutinizing eye. "Lord bless my stars! my lady," she\r\nexclaimed, "this must be the paper--I mean may be the paper--that Mr.\r\nChampfort was cutting a quire of, the very day before Miss Portman left\r\ntown. It\'s a great while ago, but I remember it as well as if it was\r\nyesterday. I saw a parcel of black jags of paper littering the place,\r\nand asked what had been going on? and was told, that it was only\r\nMr. Champfort who had been cutting some paper; which, to be sure, I\r\nconcluded my lord had given to him, having no further occasion for,--as\r\nmy lord and you, my lady, were just going out of mourning at that time,\r\nas you may remember."\r\n\r\nLord Delacour, when the paper was shown to him, recognized it\r\nimmediately by a private mark which he had put on the outside sheet of\r\na division of letter paper, which, indeed, he had never given to\r\nChampfort, but which he had missed about the time Marriott mentioned.\r\nBetween the leaves of this paper his lordship had put, as it was often\r\nhis practice, some bank notes: they were notes but of small value, and\r\nwhen he missed them he was easily persuaded by Champfort that, as he had\r\nbeen much intoxicated the preceding night, he had thrown them away with\r\nsome useless papers. He rummaged through his writing-desk in vain, and\r\nthen gave up the search. It was true that on this very occasion he\r\ngave Champfort the remainder of some mourning paper, which he made no\r\nscruple, therefore, of producing openly. Certain that he could swear\r\nto his own private mark, and that he could identify his notes by their\r\nnumbers, &c., of which he had luckily a memorandum, Lord Delacour,\r\nenraged to find himself both robbed and duped by a favourite servant, in\r\nwhom he had placed implicit confidence, was effectually roused from his\r\nnatural indolence: he took such active and successful measures, that Mr.\r\nChampfort was committed to gaol, to take his trial for the robbery. To\r\nmake peace for himself, he confessed that he had been instigated by Mrs.\r\nFreke to get the anonymous letter written. This lady was now suffering\r\njust punishment for her _frolics_, and Lady Delacour thought her fallen\r\nso much below indignation, that she advised Belinda to take no manner\r\nof notice of her conduct, except by simply returning the letter to\r\nher, with "Miss Portman\'s, Mr. Vincent\'s, and Lord and Lady Delacour\'s,\r\ncompliments and thanks to _a sincere friend_, who had been the means of\r\nbringing villany to justice."\r\n\r\nSo much for Mrs. Freke and Mr. Champfort, who, both together, scarcely\r\ndeserve an episode of ten lines.\r\n\r\nNow to return to Mr. Vincent. Animated by fresh hope, he pressed his\r\nsuit with Belinda with all the ardour of his sanguine temper. Though\r\nlittle disposed to fear any future evil, especially in the midst of\r\npresent felicity, yet he was aware of the danger that might ensue to\r\nhim from Clarence Hervey\'s arrival; he was therefore impatient for the\r\nintermediate day to pass, and it was with heartfelt joy that he saw the\r\ncarriages at last at the door, which were actually to convey them\r\nto Oakly-park. Mr. Vincent, who had all the West Indian love for\r\nmagnificence, had upon this occasion an extremely handsome equipage.\r\nLady Delacour, though she was disappointed by Clarence Hervey\'s not\r\nappearing, did not attempt to delay their departure. She contented\r\nherself with leaving a note, to be delivered to him on his arrival,\r\nwhich, she still flattered herself, would induce him immediately to go\r\nto Harrowgate. The trunks were fastened upon the carriages, the imperial\r\nwas carrying out, Marriott was full of a world of business, Lord\r\nDelacour was looking at his horses as usual, Helena was patting Mr.\r\nVincent\'s great dog, and Belinda was rallying her lover upon his taste\r\nfor "the pomp, pride, and circumstance" of glorious travelling--when an\r\nexpress arrived from Oakly-park. It was to delay their journey for a\r\nfew weeks. Mr. Percival and Lady Anne wrote word, that they were\r\nunexpectedly called from home by--. Lady Delacour did not stay to read\r\nby what, or by whom, she was so much delighted by this reprieve.\r\nMr. Vincent bore the disappointment as well as could be expected;\r\nparticularly when Belinda observed, to comfort him, that "the mind\r\nis its own place;" and that hers, she believed, would be the same at\r\nTwickenham as at Oakly-park. Nor did _she_ give him any reason to regret\r\nthat she was not immediately under the influence of his own friends. The\r\ndread of being unduly biassed by Lady Delacour, and the strong desire\r\nBelinda felt to act honourably by Mr. Vincent, to show him that she\r\nwas not trifling with his happiness, and that she was incapable of the\r\nmeanness of retaining a lover as a _pis-aller_, were motives which acted\r\nmore powerfully in his favour than all that even Lady Anne Percival\r\ncould have looked or said. The contrast between the openness and\r\ndecision of his conduct towards her, and Clarence Hervey\'s vacillation\r\nand mystery; the belief that Mr. Hervey was or ought to be attached to\r\nanother woman; the conviction that Mr. Vincent was strongly attached to\r\nher, and that he possessed many of the good qualities essential to her\r\nhappiness, operated every day more and more strongly upon Belinda\'s\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nWhere was Clarence Hervey all this time? Lady Delacour, alas! could not\r\ndivine. She every morning was certain that he would appear that day, and\r\nevery night she was forced to acknowledge her mistake. No inquiries--and\r\nshe had made all that could be made, by address and perseverance--no\r\ninquiries could clear up the mystery of Virginia and Mrs. Ormond; and\r\nher impatience to see her friend Clarence every hour increased. She was\r\ndivided between her confidence in him and her affection for Belinda;\r\nunwilling to give him up, yet afraid to injure her happiness, or to\r\noffend her, by injudicious advice, and improper interference. One thing\r\nkept Lady Delacour for some time in spirits--Miss Portman\'s assurance\r\nthat she would not bind herself by any promise or engagement to Mr.\r\nVincent, even when decided in his favour; and that she should hold both\r\nhim and herself perfectly free till they were actually married. This was\r\naccording to Lady Anne and Mr. Percival\'s principles; and Lady Delacour\r\nwas never tired of expressing directly or indirectly her admiration of\r\nthe prudence and propriety of their doctrine.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour recollected her own promise, to give her _sincere\r\ncongratulations to the victorious knight_; and she endeavoured to treat\r\nMr. Vincent with impartiality. She was, however, now still less inclined\r\nto like him, from a discovery, which she accidentally made, of his being\r\nstill upon good terms with _odious Mrs. Luttridge_. Helena, one morning,\r\nwas playing with Mr. Vincent\'s large dog, of which he was excessively\r\nfond. It was called Juba, after his faithful servant.\r\n\r\n"Helena, my dear," said Lady Delacour, "take care! don\'t trust your hand\r\nin that creature\'s monstrous mouth."\r\n\r\n"I can assure your ladyship," cried Mr. Vincent, "that he is the very\r\nquietest and best creature in the world."\r\n\r\n"No doubt," said Belinda, smiling, "since he belongs to you; for you\r\nknow, as Mr. Percival tells you, every thing animate or inanimate that\r\nis under your protection, you think must be the best of its kind in the\r\nuniverse."\r\n\r\n"But, really, Juba is the best creature in the world," repeated Mr.\r\nVincent, with great eagerness. "Juba is, without exception, the best\r\ncreature in the universe."\r\n\r\n"Juba, the dog, or Juba, the man?" said Belinda: "you know, they cannot\r\nbe both the best creatures in the universe."\r\n\r\n"Well! Juba, the man, is the best man--and Juba, the dog, is the best\r\ndog, in the universe," said Mr. Vincent, laughing, with his usual\r\ncandour, at his own foible, when it was pointed out to him. "But,\r\nseriously, Lady Delacour, you need not be in the least afraid to trust\r\nMiss Delacour with this poor fellow; for, do you know, during a whole\r\nmonth that I lent him to Mrs. Luttridge, at Harrowgate, she used\r\nconstantly to let him sleep in the room with her; and now, whenever he\r\nsees her, he licks her hand as gently as if he were a lapdog; and it\r\nwas but yesterday, when I had him there, she declared he was more gentle\r\nthan any lapdog in London."\r\n\r\nAt the name of Luttridge, Lady Delacour changed countenance, and she\r\ncontinued silent for some time. Mr. Vincent, attributing her sudden\r\nseriousness to dislike or fear of his dog, took him out of the room.\r\n\r\n"My dear Lady Delacour," said Belinda, observing that she still retained\r\nan air of displeasure, "I hope your antipathy to _odious Mrs. Luttridge_\r\ndoes not extend to every body who visits her."\r\n\r\n"Tout au contraire," cried Lady Delacour, starting from her reverie, and\r\nassuming a playful manner: "I have made a general gaol-delivery of\r\nall my old hatreds; and even odious Mrs. Luttridge, though a hardened\r\noffender, must be included in this act of grace: so you need not fear\r\nthat Mr. Vincent should fall under my royal displeasure for consorting\r\nwith this state criminal. Though I can\'t sympathize with him, I forgive\r\nhim, both for liking that great dog, and that little woman; especially,\r\nas I shrewdly suspect, that he likes the lady\'s E O table better than\r\nthe lady."\r\n\r\n"E O table! Good Heavens! you do not imagine Mr. Vincent----"\r\n\r\n"Nay, my dear, don\'t look so terribly alarmed! I assure you, I did not\r\nmean to hint that there was any serious, _improper_ attachment to the E\r\nO table; only a little flirtation, perhaps, to which his passion for you\r\nhas, doubtless, put a stop."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll ask him the moment I see him," cried Belinda, "if he is fond of\r\nplay: I know he used to play at billiards at Oakly-park, but merely as\r\nan amusement. Games of address are not to be put upon a footing with\r\ngames of hazard.\'\r\n\r\n"A man may, however, contrive to lose a good deal of money at billiards,\r\nas poor Lord Delacour can tell you. But I beseech you, my dear, do not\r\nbetray me to Mr. Vincent; ten to one I am mistaken, for his great dog\r\nput me out of humour----"\r\n\r\n"But with such a doubt upon my mind, unsatisfied----"\r\n\r\n"It shall be satisfied; Lord Delacour shall make inquiries for me. Lord\r\nDelacour _shall_ make inquiries, did I say?--_will_, I should have\r\nsaid. If Champfort had heard me, to what excellent account he might have\r\nturned that unlucky _shall_. What a nice grammarian a woman had need to\r\nbe, who would live well with a husband inferior to her in understanding!\r\nWith a superior or an equal, she might use _shall_ and _will_ as\r\ninaccurately as she pleases. Glorious privilege! How I shall envy it\r\nyou, my dear Belinda! But how can you ever hope to enjoy it? Where is\r\nyour superior? Where is your equal?"\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent, who had by this time seen his dog fed, which was one of his\r\ndaily pleasures, returned, and politely assured Lady Delacour that Juba\r\nshould not again intrude. To make her peace with Mr. Vincent, and to\r\ndrive the E O table from Belinda\'s thoughts, her ladyship now turned the\r\nconversation from Juba the dog, to Juba the man. She talked of Harriot\r\nFreke\'s phosphoric Obeah woman, of whom, she said, she had heard an\r\naccount from Miss Portman. From thence she went on to the African\r\nslave trade, by way of contrast, and she finished precisely where she\r\nintended, and where Mr. Vincent could have wished, by praising a poem\r\ncalled \'The dying Negro,\' which he had the preceding evening brought to\r\nread to Belinda. This praise was peculiarly agreeable, because he was\r\nnot perfectly sure of his own critical judgment, and his knowledge\r\nof English literature was not as extensive as Clarence Hervey\'s; a\r\ncircumstance which Lady Delacour had discovered one morning, when they\r\nwent to see Pope\'s famous villa at Twickenham. Flattered by her present\r\nconfirmation of his taste, Mr. Vincent readily complied with a request\r\nto read the poem to Belinda. They were all deeply engaged by the\r\ncharms of poetry, when they were suddenly interrupted by the entrance\r\nof--Clarence Hervey!\r\n\r\nThe book dropped from Vincent\'s hand the instant that he heard his name.\r\nLady Delacour\'s eyes sparkled with joy. Belinda\'s colour rose, but her\r\ncountenance maintained an expression of calm dignity. Mr. Hervey, upon\r\nhis first entrance, appeared prepared to support an air of philosophic\r\ncomposure, which forsook him before he had walked across the room. He\r\nseemed overpowered by the kindness with which Lady Delacour received\r\nhis congratulations on her recovery--struck by the reserve of Belinda\'s\r\nmanner--but not surprised, or displeased, at the sight of Mr. Vincent.\r\nOn the contrary, he desired immediately to be introduced to him, with\r\nthe air of a man resolute to cultivate his friendship. Provoked\r\nand perplexed, Lady Delacour, in a tone of mingled reproach and\r\nastonishment, exclaimed, "Though you have not done me the honour, Mr.\r\nHervey, to take any other notice of my last letter, I am to understand,\r\nI presume, by the manner in which you desire me to introduce you to our\r\nfriend Mr. Vincent, that it has been received."\r\n\r\n"Received! Good Heavens! have not you had my answer?" cried Clarence\r\nHervey, with a voice and look of extreme surprise and emotion: "Has not\r\nyour ladyship received a packet?"\r\n\r\n"I have had no packet--I have had no letter. Mr. Vincent, do me the\r\nfavour to ring the bell," cried Lady Delacour, eagerly: "I\'ll know, this\r\ninstant, what\'s become of it."\r\n\r\n"Your ladyship must have thought me--," and, as he spoke, his eye\r\ninvoluntarily glanced towards Belinda.\r\n\r\n"No matter what I thought you," cried Lady Delacour, who forgave him\r\nevery thing for this single glance; "if I did you a little injustice,\r\nClarence, when I was angry, you must forgive me; for, I assure you, I do\r\nyou a great deal of justice at other times."\r\n\r\n"Did any letter, any packet, come here for me? Inquire, inquire," said\r\nshe, impatiently, to the servant who came in. No letter or packet was\r\nto be heard of. It had been directed, Mr. Hervey now remembered, to her\r\nladyship\'s house in town. She gave orders to have it immediately sent\r\nfor; but scarcely had she given them, when, turning to Mr. Hervey, she\r\nlaughed and said, "A very foolish compliment to you and your letter,\r\nfor you certainly can speak as well as you can write; nay, better, I\r\nthink--though you don\'t write ill, neither--but you can tell me, in two\r\nwords, what in writing would take half a volume. Leave this gentleman\r\nand lady to \'the dying Negro,\' and let me hear your two words in Lord\r\nDelacour\'s dressing-room, if you please," said she, opening the door of\r\nan adjoining apartment. "Lord Delacour will not be jealous if he find\r\nyou tete-a-tete with me, I promise you. But you shall not be compelled.\r\nYou look--"\r\n\r\n"I look," said Mr. Hervey, affecting to laugh, "as if I felt the\r\nimpossibility of putting half a volume into two words. It is a long\r\nstory, and--"\r\n\r\n"And I must wait for the packet, whether I will or no--well, be it so,"\r\nsaid Lady Delacour. Struck with the extreme perturbation into which\r\nhe was thrown, she pressed him with no farther raillery, but instantly\r\nattempted to change the conversation to general subjects.\r\n\r\nAgain she had recourse to \'the dying Negro.\' Mr. Vincent, to whom she\r\nnow addressed herself, said, "For my part, I neither have, nor pretend\r\nto have, much critical taste; but I admire in this poem the manly,\r\nenergetic spirit of virtue which it breathes." From the poem, an easy\r\ntransition was made to the author; and Clarence Hervey, exerting himself\r\nto join in the conversation, observed, "that this writer (Mr. Day) was\r\nan instance that genuine eloquence must spring from the heart. Cicero\r\nwas certainly right," continued he, addressing himself to Mr. Vincent,\r\n"in his definition of a great orator, to make it one of the first\r\nrequisites, that he should be a good man."\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent coldly replied, "This definition would exclude too many men\r\nof superior talents, to be easily admitted."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the appearance of virtue," said Belinda, "might, on many\r\noccasions, succeed as well as the reality."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if the man be as good an actor as Mr. Hervey," said, Lady\r\nDelacour, "and if he suit \'the action to the word\'--\'the word to the\r\naction.\'"\r\n\r\nBelinda never raised her eyes whilst her ladyship uttered these words;\r\nMr. Vincent was, or seemed to be, so deeply engaged in looking for\r\nsomething in the book, which he held in his hand, that he could take no\r\nfarther part in the conversation; and a dead silence ensued.\r\n\r\nLady Delacour, who was naturally impatient in the extreme, especially\r\nin the vindication of her friends, could not bear to see, as she did by\r\nBelinda\'s countenance, that she had not forgotten Marriott\'s story of\r\nVirginia St. Pierre; and though her ladyship was convinced that the\r\n_packet_ would clear up all mysteries, yet she could not endure that\r\neven in the interim \'poor Clarence\' should he unjustly suspected; nor\r\ncould she refrain from trying an expedient, which just occurred to her,\r\nto satisfy herself and every body present. She was the first to break\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"To do ye justice, my friends, you are all good company this morning.\r\nMr. Vincent is excusable, because he is in love; and Belinda is\r\nexcusable, because--because--Mr. Hervey, pray help me to an excuse for\r\nMiss Portman\'s stupidity, for I am dreadfully afraid of blundering out\r\nthe truth. But why do I ask _you_ to help me? In your present condition,\r\nyou seem totally unable to help yourself.--Not a word!--Run over the\r\ncommon-places of conversation--weather--fashion--scandal--dress--deaths--\r\nmarriages.--Will none of these do? Suppose, then, you were to entertain\r\nme with other people\'s thoughts, since you have none of your own\r\nunpacked--Forfeit to arbitrary power," continued her ladyship, playfully\r\nseizing Mr. Vincent\'s book. "I have always observed that none submit\r\nwith so good a grace to arbitrary power from our sex as your true men of\r\nspirit, who would shed the last drop of their blood to resist it from\r\none of their own. Inconsistent creatures, the best of you! So read this\r\ncharming little poem to us, Mr. Hervey, will you?"\r\n\r\nHe was going to begin immediately, but Lady Delacour put her hand upon\r\nthe book, and stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Stay; though I am tyrannical, I will not be treacherous. I warn you,\r\nthen, that I have imposed upon you a difficult, a dangerous task. If you\r\nhave any \'sins unwhipt of justice,\' there are lines which I defy you to\r\nread without faltering--listen to the preface."\r\n\r\nHer ladyship began as follows:\r\n\r\n"Mr. Day, indeed, retained during all the period of his life, as\r\nmight be expected from his character, a strong detestation of female\r\nseduction----Happening to see some verses, written by a young lady, on\r\na recent event of this nature, which was succeeded by a fatal\r\ncatastrophe--the unhappy young woman, who had been a victim to the\r\nperfidy of a lover, overpowered by her sensibility of shame, having died\r\nof a broken heart--he expresses his sympathy with the fair poetess in\r\nthe following manner."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour paused, and fixed her eyes upon Clarence Hervey. He, with\r\nall the appearance of conscious innocence, received the book, without\r\nhesitation, from her hands, and read aloud the lines, to which she\r\npointed.\r\n\r\n    "Swear by the dread avengers of the tomb,\r\n    By all thy hopes, by death\'s tremendous gloom,\r\n    That ne\'er by thee deceived, the tender maid\r\n    Shall mourn her easy confidence betray\'d,\r\n    Nor weep in secret the triumphant art,\r\n    With bitter anguish rankling in her heart;\r\n    So may each blessing, which impartial fate\r\n    Throws on the good, but snatches from the great,\r\n    Adorn thy favour\'d course with rays divine,\r\n    And Heaven\'s best gift, a virtuous love, be thine!"\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey read these lines with so much unaffected, unembarrassed\r\nenergy, that Lady Delacour could not help casting a triumphant look at\r\nBelinda, which said or seemed to say--you see I was right in my opinion\r\nof Clarence!\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Vincent been left to his own observations, he would have seen\r\nthe simple truth; but he was alarmed and deceived by Lady Delacour\'s\r\nimprudent expressions of joy, and by the significant looks that she\r\ngave her friend Miss Portman, which seemed to be _looks of mutual\r\nintelligence_. He scarcely dared to turn his eyes toward his mistress,\r\nor upon him whom he thought his rival: but he kept them anxiously fixed\r\nupon her ladyship, in whose face, as in a glass, he seemed to study\r\nevery thing that was passing.\r\n\r\n"Pray, have you ever played at chess, since we saw you last?" said\r\nLady Delacour to Clarence. "I hope you do not forget that you are _my\r\nknight_. I do not forget it, I assure you--I own you as my knight to all\r\nthe world, in public and private--do not I, Belinda?"\r\n\r\nA dark cloud overspread Mr. Vincent\'s brow--he listened not to Belinda\'s\r\nanswer. Seized with a transport of jealousy, he darted at Mr. Hervey a\r\nglance of mingled scorn and rage; and, after saying a few unintelligible\r\nwords to Miss Portman and Lady Delacour, he left the room.\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey, who seemed afraid to trust himself longer with Belinda,\r\nwithdrew a few minutes afterward.\r\n\r\n"My dear Belinda," exclaimed Lady Delacour, the moment that he was out\r\nof the room, "how glad I am he is gone, that I may say all the good I\r\nthink of him! In the first place, Clarence Hervey loves you. Never was I\r\nso fully convinced of it as this day. Why had we not that letter of his\r\nsooner? that will explain all to us: but I ask for no explanation, I\r\nask for no letter, to confirm my opinion, my conviction--that he _loves_\r\nyou: on this point I _cannot_ be mistaken--he fondly loves you."\r\n\r\n"He fondly loves her!--Yes, to be sure, I could have told you that news\r\nlong ago," cried the dowager Lady Boucher, who was in the room before\r\nthey were aware of her entrance; they had both been so eager, the one\r\nlistening, and the other speaking.\r\n\r\n"Fondly loves her!" repeated the dowager: "yes; and no secret, I\r\npromise you, Lady Delacour:" and then, turning to Belinda, she began a\r\ncongratulatory speech, upon the report of her approaching marriage with\r\nMr. Vincent. Belinda absolutely denied the truth of this report: but the\r\ndowager continued, "I distress you, I see, and it\'s quite out of rule,\r\nI am sensible, to speak in this sort of way, Miss Portman; but as I\'m an\r\nold acquaintance, and an old friend, and an old woman, you\'ll excuse me.\r\nI can\'t help saying, I feel quite rejoiced at your meeting with such a\r\nmatch." Belinda again attempted to declare that she was not going to be\r\nmarried; but the invincible dowager went on: "Every way eligible, and\r\nevery way agreeable. A charming young man, I hear, Lady Delacour: I\r\nsee I must only speak to you, or I shall make Miss Portman sink to the\r\ncentre of the earth, which I would not wish to do, especially at such a\r\ncritical moment as this. A charming young man, I hear, with a noble West\r\nIndian fortune, and a noble spirit, and well connected, and passionately\r\nin love--no wonder. But I have done now, I promise you; I\'ll ask no\r\nquestions: so don\'t run away, Miss Portman; I\'ll ask no questions, I\r\npromise you."\r\n\r\nTo ensure the performance of the promise, Lady Delacour asked what news\r\nthere was in the world? This question, she knew, would keep the dowager\r\nin delightful employment. "I live quite out of the world here; but since\r\nLady Boucher has the charity to come to see me, we shall hear all the\r\n\'secrets worth knowing,\' from the best authority."\r\n\r\n"Then, the first piece of news I have for you is, that my Lord and my\r\nLady Delacour are absolutely reconciled; and that they are the happiest\r\ncouple that ever lived."\r\n\r\n"All very true," replied Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"True!" repeated Lady Boucher: "why, my dear Lady Delacour, you amaze\r\nme!--Are you in earnest?--Was there ever any thing so provoking?--There\r\nhave I been contradicting the report, wherever I went; for I was\r\nconvinced that the whole story was a mistake, and a fabrication."\r\n\r\n"The history of the reformation might not be exact, but the reformation\r\nitself your ladyship may depend upon, since you hear it from my own\r\nlips."\r\n\r\n"Well, how amazing! how incredible!--Lord bless me! But your ladyship\r\ncertainly is not in earnest? for you look just the same, and speak just\r\nin the same sort of way: I see no alteration, I confess."\r\n\r\n"And what alteration, my good Lady Boucher, did you expect to see? Did\r\nyou think that, by way of being exemplarily virtuous, I should, like\r\nLady Q----, let my sentences come out of my mouth only at the rate of a\r\nword a minute?\r\n\r\n    \'Like--minute--drops--from--off--the--eaves.\'\r\n\r\nOr did you expect that, in hopes of being a pattern for the rising\r\ngeneration, I should hold my features in penance, immoveably, thus--like\r\nsome of the poor ladies of Antigua, who, after they have blistered their\r\nfaces all over, to get a fine complexion, are forced, whilst the new\r\nskin is coming, to sit without speaking, smiling, or moving muscle or\r\nfeature, lest an indelible wrinkle should be the consequence?"\r\n\r\nLady Boucher was impatient to have this speech finished, for she had a\r\npiece of news to tell. "Well!" cried she, "there\'s no knowing what to\r\nbelieve or disbelieve, one hears so many strange reports; but I have a\r\npiece of news for you, that you may all depend upon. I have one secret\r\nworth knowing, I can tell your ladyship--and one, your ladyship and\r\nMiss Portman, I\'m sure, will be rejoiced to hear. Your friend, Clarence\r\nHervey, is going to be married."\r\n\r\n"Married! married!" cried Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, your ladyship may look as much astonished as you please, you\r\ncannot be more so than I was when I heard it. Clarence Hervey, Miss\r\nPortman, that was looked upon so completely, you know, as not a marrying\r\nman; and now the last man upon earth that your ladyship would suspect of\r\nmarrying in this sort of way!"\r\n\r\n"In what sort of way?--My dear Belinda, how can you stand this fire?"\r\nsaid Lady Delacour, placing a skreen, dexterously, to hide her face from\r\nthe dowager\'s observation.\r\n\r\n"Now only guess whom he is going to marry," continued Lady Boucher:\r\n"whom do _you_ guess, Miss Portman?"\r\n\r\n"An amiable woman, I should guess, from Mr. Hervey\'s general character,"\r\ncried Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Oh, an amiable woman, I take for granted; every woman is amiable of\r\ncourse, as the newspapers tell us, when she is going to be married,"\r\nsaid the dowager: "an amiable woman, to be sure; but that means nothing.\r\nI have not had a guess from Miss Portman."\r\n\r\n"From general character," Belinda began, in a constrained voice.\r\n\r\n"Do not guess from general character, my dear Belinda," interrupted\r\nLady Delacour; "for there is no judging, in these cases, from general\r\ncharacter, of what people will like or dislike."\r\n\r\n"Then I will leave it to your ladyship to guess this time, if you\r\nplease," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"You will neither of you guess till doomsday!" cried the dowager; "I\r\nmust tell you. Mr. Hervey\'s going to marry--in the strangest sort of\r\nway!--a girl that nobody knows--a daughter of a Mr. Hartley. The\r\nfather can give her a good fortune, it is true; but one should not have\r\nsupposed that fortune was an object with Mr. Hervey, who has such a\r\nnoble one of his own. It\'s really difficult to believe it."\r\n\r\n"So difficult, that I find it quite impossible," said Lady Delacour,\r\nwith an incredulous smile.\r\n\r\n"Depend upon it, my dear Lady Delacour," said the dowager, laying the\r\nconvincing weight of her arm upon her ladyship\'s, "depend upon it, my\r\ndear Lady Delacour, that my information is correct. Guess whom I had it\r\nfrom."\r\n\r\n"Willingly. But first let me tell you, that I have seen Mr. Hervey\r\nwithin this half hour, and I never saw a man look less like a\r\nbridegroom."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! well, I\'ve heard, too, that he didn\'t like the match: but what\r\na pity, when you saw him yourself this morning, that you didn\'t get all\r\nthe particulars out of him. But let him look like what he will, you\'ll\r\nfind that my information is perfectly correct. Guess whom I had it\r\nfrom--from Mrs. Margaret Delacour: it was at her house that Clarence\r\nHervey first met Mr. Hartley, who, as I mentioned, is the father of the\r\nyoung lady. There was a charming scene, and some romantic story, about\r\nhis finding the girl in a cottage, and calling her Virginia something or\r\nother, but I didn\'t clearly understand about that. However, this much is\r\ncertain, that the girl, as her father told Mrs. Delacour, is desperately\r\nin love with Mr. Hervey, and they are to be married immediately. Depend\r\nupon it, you\'ll find my information correct. Good morning to you. Lord\r\nbless me! now I recollect, I once heard that Mr. Hervey was a great\r\nadmirer of Miss Portman," said the dowager.\r\n\r\nThe inquisitive dowager, whose curiosity was put upon a new scent,\r\nimmediately fastened her eyes upon Belinda\'s face; but from that she\r\ncould make out nothing. Was it because she had not the best eyes, or\r\nbecause there was nothing to be seen? To determine this question, she\r\nlooked through her glass, to take a clearer view; but Lady Delacour drew\r\noff her attention, by suddenly exclaiming--"My dear Lady Boucher,\r\nwhen you go back to town, do send me a bottle of concentrated anima of\r\nquassia."\r\n\r\n"Ah! ah! have I made a convert of you at last?" said the dowager; and,\r\nsatisfied with the glory of this conversion, she departed.\r\n\r\n"Admire my knowledge of human nature, my dear Belinda," said Lady\r\nDelacour. "Now she will talk, at the next place she goes to, of nothing\r\nbut of my faith in anima of quassia; and she will forget to make a\r\ngossiping story out of that most imprudent hint I gave her, about\r\nClarence Hervey\'s having been an admirer of yours."\r\n\r\n"Do not leave the room, Belinda; I have a thousand things to say to you,\r\nmy dear."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, at present, my dear Lady Delacour; I am impatient to write a\r\nfew lines to Mr. Vincent. He went away--"\r\n\r\n"In a fit of jealousy, and I am glad of it."\r\n\r\n"And I am sorry for it," said Belinda; "sorry that he should have so\r\nlittle confidence in me as to feel jealousy without cause--without\r\nsufficient cause, I should say; for certainly your ladyship gave pain,\r\nby the manner in which you received Mr. Hervey."\r\n\r\n"Lord, my dear, you would spoil any man upon earth. You could not act\r\nmore foolishly if the man were your husband. Are you privately married\r\nto him?--If you be not--for my sake--for your own--for Mr. Vincent\'s--do\r\nnot write till we see the contents of Clarence Hervey\'s packet."\r\n\r\n"It _can_ make no alteration in what I write," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, write what you please; but I only hope you will not send\r\nyour letter till the packet arrives."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, I shall send it as soon as I possibly can: the \'dear delight\r\nof giving pain\' does not suit my taste."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour, as soon as she was left alone, began to reconsider the\r\ndowager\'s story; notwithstanding her unbelieving smile, it alarmed her,\r\nfor she could not refuse to give it some degree of credit, when she\r\nlearnt that Mrs. Margaret Delacour was the authority from whom it came.\r\nMrs. Delacour was a woman of scrupulous veracity, and rigid in her\r\ndislike to gossiping; so that it was scarcely probable a report\r\noriginating with her, however it might be altered by the way, should\r\nprove to be totally void of foundation. The name of Virginia coincided\r\nwith Sir Philip Baddely\'s hints, and with Marriott\'s discoveries: these\r\ncircumstances considered, Lady Delacour knew not what opinion to form;\r\nand her eagerness to receive Mr. Hervey\'s packet every moment increased.\r\nShe walked up and down the room--looked at her watch--fancied that it\r\nhad stopped--held it to her ear--ran the bell every quarter of an hour,\r\nto inquire whether the messenger was not _yet_ come back. At last,\r\nthe long-expected packet arrived. She seized it, and hurried with it\r\nimmediately to Belinda\'s room.\r\n\r\n"Clarence Hervey\'s packet, my love!--Now, woe be to the person who\r\ninterrupts us!" She bolted the door as she spoke--. rolled an arm-chair\r\nto the fire--"Now for it!" said she, seating herself. "The devil upon\r\ntwo sticks, if he were looking down upon me from the house-top, or\r\nChampfort, who is the worse devil of the two, would, if he were peeping\r\nthrough the keyhole, swear I was going to open a love-letter--and so I\r\nhope I am. Now for it!" cried she, breaking the seal.\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," said Belinda, laying her hand upon Lady Delacour\'s,\r\n"before we open this packet, let me speak to you, whilst our minds are\r\ncalm."\r\n\r\n"Calm! It is the strangest time for your mind to be calm. But I must not\r\naffront you by my incredulity. Speak, then, but be quick, for I do not\r\npretend to be calm; it not being, thank my stars, _\'mon metier d\'etre\r\nphilosophe.\'_ Crack goes the last seal--speak now, or for ever after\r\nhold your tongue, my _calm philosopher _of Oakly-park: but do you wish\r\nme to attend to what you are going to say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Belinda, smiling; "that is the usual wish of those who\r\nspeak."\r\n\r\n"Very true: and I can listen tolerably well, when I don\'t know what\r\npeople are going to say; but when I know it all beforehand, I have an\r\nunfortunate habit of not being able to attend to one word. Now, my dear,\r\nlet me anticipate your speech, and if my anticipation be wrong, then you\r\nshall rise to explain; and I will," said she, (putting her finger on her\r\nlips,) "listen to you, like Harpocrates, without moving an eyelash."\r\n\r\nBelinda, as the most certain way of being heard, consented to hear\r\nbefore she spoke.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you," pursued Lady Delacour, "if not what you are going to\r\nsay to me, at least what you say to yourself, which is fully as much to\r\nthe purpose. You say to yourself, \'Let this packet of Clarence Hervey\r\ncontain what it may, it comes too late. Let him say, or let him do, \'tis\r\nall the same to me--because--(now for the reasoning)--because things\r\nhave gone so far with Mr. Vincent, that Lady Anne Percival and all the\r\nworld (at Oakly-park) will blame me, if I retract. In short, _things\r\nhave gone so far_ that I cannot recede; because--_things have gone so\r\nfar_.\' This is the rondeau of your argument. Nay, hear me out, then you\r\nshall have your turn, my dear, for an hour, if you please. Let things\r\nhave gone ever so far, they can stop, and turn about again, cannot they?\r\nLady Anne Percival is your friend, of course can wish only for\r\nyour happiness. You think she is \'the thing that\'s most uncommon, a\r\nreasonable woman:\' then she cannot be angry with you for being happy\r\nyour own way. So I need not, as the orators say, _labour this point any\r\nmore_. Now, as to your aunt. The fear of displeasing Mrs. Stanhope a\r\nlittle more or less is not to be put in competition with the hope of\r\nyour happiness for life, especially as you have contrived to exist some\r\nmonths in a state of utter excommunication from her favour. After all,\r\nyou know she will not grieve for any thing but the loss of Mr. Vincent\'s\r\nfortune; and Mr. Hervey\'s fortune might do as well, or almost as\r\nwell: at least, she may compound with her pride for the difference, by\r\nconsidering that an English member of parliament is, in the eyes of the\r\nworld (the only eyes with which she sees), a better connexion than the\r\nson of a West India planter, even though he may be a protege of Lady\r\nAnne Percival.\r\n\r\n"Spare me your indignation, my dear!--What a look was there!--Reasoning\r\nfor Mrs. Stanhope, must not I reason as Mrs. Stanhope does?--Now I will\r\nput this stronger still. Suppose that you had actually acknowledged that\r\nMr. Vincent had got beyond esteem with you; suppose that you had in\r\ndue form consented to marry him; suppose that preparations were at this\r\nmoment making for the wedding; even in that desperate case I should say\r\nto you, you are not a girl to marry because your wedding-gown is made\r\nup. Some few guineas are thrown away, perhaps; do not throw away your\r\nwhole happiness after them--that would be sorry economy. Trust me, my\r\ndear, I should say, as I have to you, in time of need. Or, if you fear\r\nto be obliged to one who never was afraid of being obliged to you, ten\r\nto one the preparations for _a_ wedding, though not _the_ wedding, may\r\nbe necessary immediately. No matter to Mrs. Franks who the bridegroom\r\nmay be; so that her bill be paid, she would not care the turning of a\r\nfeather whether it be paid by Mrs. Vincent or Mrs. Hervey. I hope I have\r\nconvinced, I am sure I have made you blush, my dear, and that is some\r\nsatisfaction. A blush at this moment is an earnest of victory. Lo,\r\ntriumphe! Now I will open my packet; my hand shall not be held an\r\ninstant longer."\r\n\r\n"I absolve you from the penance of hearing me for an hour, but I claim\r\nyour promise to attend to me for a few minutes, my dear friend," said\r\nBelinda: "I thank you most sincerely for your kindness; and let me\r\nassure you that I should not hesitate to accept from you any species of\r\nobligation."\r\n\r\n"Thanks! thanks!--there\'s a dear good girl!--my own Belinda!"\r\n\r\n"But indeed you totally misunderstand me; your reasoning--"\r\n\r\n"Show me the fault of it: I challenge all the logic of all the\r\nPercivals."\r\n\r\n"Your reasoning is excellent, if your facts were not taken for granted.\r\nYou have taken it for granted, that Mr. Hervey is in love with me."\r\n\r\n"No," said Lady Delacour; "I take nothing for granted, as you will find\r\nwhen I open this packet."\r\n\r\n"You have taken it for granted," continued Belinda, "that I am still\r\nsecretly attached to him; and you take it for granted that I am\r\nrestrained only by fear of Lady Anne Percival, my aunt, and the world,\r\nfrom breaking off with Mr. Vincent: if you will read the letter, which\r\nI was writing to him when you came into the room, perhaps you will be\r\nconvinced of your mistake."\r\n\r\n"Read a letter to Mr. Vincent at such a time as this! then I will go\r\nand read my packet in my own room," cried Lady Delacour, rising hastily,\r\nwith evident displeasure.\r\n\r\n"Not even your displeasure, my dear friend," said Belinda, "can alter\r\nmy determination to behave with consistency and openness towards Mr.\r\nVincent; and I can bear your anger, for I know it arises from your\r\nregard for me."\r\n\r\n"I never loved you so little as at this instant, Belinda."\r\n\r\n"You will do me justice when you are cool."\r\n\r\n"Cool!" repeated Lady Delacour, as she was about to leave the room, "I\r\nnever wish to be as cool as you are, Belinda! So, after all, you love\r\nMr. Vincent--you\'ll marry Mr. Vincent!"\r\n\r\n"I never said so," replied Belinda: "you have not read my letter. Oh,\r\nLady Delacour, at this instant--you should not reproach me."\r\n\r\n"I did you injustice," cried Lady Delacour, as she now looked at\r\nBelinda\'s letter. "Send it--send it--you have said the very thing you\r\nought; and now sit down with me to this packet of Clarence Hervey\'s--be\r\njust to him, as you are to Mr. Vincent, that\'s all I ask--give him a\r\nfair hearing:--now for it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA\r\n\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey\'s packet contained a history of his connexion with\r\nVirginia St. Pierre.\r\n\r\nTo save our hero from the charge of egotism, we shall relate the\r\nprincipal circumstances in the third person.\r\n\r\nIt was about a year before he had seen Belinda that Clarence Hervey\r\nreturned from his travels; he had been in France just before the\r\nRevolution, when luxury and dissipation were at their height in Paris,\r\nand when a universal spirit of licentious gallantry prevailed. Some\r\ncircumstances in which he was personally interested disgusted him\r\nstrongly with the Parisian belles; he felt that women who were full\r\nof vanity, affectation, and artifice, whose tastes were perverted, and\r\nwhose feelings were depraved, were equally incapable of conferring or\r\nenjoying real happiness. Whilst this conviction was full in his mind, he\r\nread the works of Rousseau: this eloquent writer\'s sense made its full\r\nimpression upon Clarence\'s understanding, and his declamations produced\r\nmore than their just effect upon an imagination naturally ardent. He was\r\ncharmed with the picture of Sophia, when contrasted with the characters\r\nof the women of the world with whom he had been disgusted; and he formed\r\nthe romantic project of educating a wife for himself. Full of this idea,\r\nhe returned to England, determined to carry his scheme immediately into\r\nexecution, but was some time delayed by the difficulty of finding\r\na proper object for his purpose: it was easy to meet with beauty\r\nin distress, and ignorance in poverty; but it was difficult to find\r\nsimplicity without vulgarity, ingenuity without cunning, or even\r\nignorance without prejudice; it was difficult to meet with an\r\nunderstanding totally uncultivated, yet likely to reward the labour of\r\nlate instruction; a heart wholly unpractised, yet full of sensibility,\r\ncapable of all the enthusiasm of passion, the delicacy of sentiment, and\r\nthe firmness of rational constancy. It is not wonderful that Mr. Hervey,\r\nwith such high expectations, should not immediately find them gratified.\r\nDisappointed in his first search, he did not, however, relinquish his\r\ndesign; and at length, by accident, he discovered, or thought that he\r\ndiscovered, an object formed expressly for his purpose.\r\n\r\nOne fine evening in autumn, as he was riding through the New Forest,\r\ncharmed with the picturesque beauties of the place, he turned out of\r\nthe beaten road, and struck into a fresh track, which he pursued with\r\nincreasing delight, till the setting sun reminded him that it was\r\nnecessary to postpone his farther reflections on forest scenery, and\r\nthat it was time to think of finding his way out of the wood. He was\r\nnow in the most retired part of the forest, and he saw no path to direct\r\nhim; but, as he stopped to consider which way he should turn, a dog\r\nsprang from a thicket, barking furiously at his horse: his horse was\r\nhigh-spirited, but he was master of him, and he obliged the animal to\r\nstand quietly till the dog, having barked himself hoarse, retreated\r\nof his own accord. Clarence watched to see which way he would go, and\r\nfollowed him, in hopes of meeting with the person to whom he belonged:\r\nhe kept his guide in sight, till he came into a beautiful glade, in the\r\nmidst of which was a neat but very small cottage, with numerous beehives\r\nin the garden, surrounded by a profusion of rose-trees which were in\r\nfull blow. This cultivated spot was strikingly contrasted with the\r\nwildness of the surrounding scenery. As he came nearer, Mr. Hervey saw a\r\nyoung girl watering the rose-trees, which grew round the cottage, and\r\nan old woman beside her filling a basket with the flowers. The old\r\nwoman was like most other old women, except that she had a remarkably\r\nbenevolent countenance, and an air that had been acquired in better\r\ndays; but the young girl did not appear to Clarence like any other young\r\ngirl that he had ever seen. The setting sun shone upon her countenance,\r\nthe wind blew aside the ringlets of her light hair, and the blush of\r\nmodesty overspread her cheeks when she looked up at the stranger. In\r\nher large blue eyes there was an expression of artless sensibility with\r\nwhich Mr. Hervey was so powerfully struck that he remained for some\r\nmoments silent, totally forgetting that he came to ask his way out of\r\nthe forest. His horse had made so little noise upon the soft grass, that\r\nhe was within a few yards of them before he was perceived by the old\r\nwoman. As soon as she saw him, she turned abruptly to the young girl,\r\nput the basket of roses into her hand, and bid her carry them into the\r\nhouse. As she passed him, the girl, with a sweet innocent smile, held up\r\nthe basket to Clarence, and offered him one of the roses.\r\n\r\n"Go in, Rachel!--go in, child," said the old woman, in so loud and\r\nsevere a tone, that both Rachel and Mr. Hervey started; the basket was\r\noverturned, and the roses all scattered upon the grass. Clarence, though\r\nhe attempted some apology, was by no means concerned for the accident,\r\nas it detained Rachel some instants longer to collect her flowers, and\r\ngave him an opportunity of admiring her finely shaped hands and arms,\r\nand the ease and natural grace of her motions.\r\n\r\n"Go in, Rachel," repeated the old woman, in a still more severe tone;\r\n"leave the roses there--I can pick them up as well as you, child--go\r\nin."\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at the old woman with astonishment, her eyes filled with\r\ntears, and throwing down the roses that she held in her hand, she said,\r\n"I _am_ going, grandmother." The door closed after her before Clarence\r\nrecollected himself sufficiently to tell the old lady how he had lost\r\nhis way, &c. Her severity vanished, as soon as her grand-daughter was\r\nsafe in the house, and with much readiness she showed him the road for\r\nwhich he inquired.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as it was in his power, he returned thither; for he\r\nhad taken such good note of the place, that he easily found his way to\r\nthe spot, which appeared to him a terrestrial paradise. As he descended\r\ninto the valley, he heard the humming of bees, but he saw no smoke\r\nrising from the cottage chimney--no dog barked--no living creature was\r\nto be seen--the house door was shut--the window-shutters closed--all\r\nwas still. The place looked as if it had been deserted by all its\r\ninhabitants: the roses had not been watered, many of them had shed their\r\nleaves; and a basket half full of dead flowers was left in the middle of\r\nthe garden. Clarence alighted, and tried the latch of the door, but it\r\nwas fastened; he listened, but heard no sound; he walked round to the\r\nback of the house: a small lattice window was half open, and, as he went\r\ntoward it, he thought he heard a low moaning voice; he gently pulled\r\naside the curtain, and peeped in at the window. The room was darkened,\r\nhis eyes had been dazzled by the sun, so that he could not, at first,\r\nsee any object distinctly; but he heard the moaning repeated at\r\nintervals, and a soft voice at last said--\r\n\r\n"Oh, speak to me!--speak to me once again--only once--only once again,\r\nspeak to me!"\r\n\r\nThe voice came from a corner of the room, to which he had not yet turned\r\nhis eyes: and as he drew aside more of the curtain, to let in more\r\nlight, a figure started up from the side of a bed, at which she had\r\nbeen kneeling, and he saw the beautiful young girl, with her hair all\r\ndishevelled, and the strongest expression of grief in her countenance.\r\nHe asked if he could do her any service. She beckoned to him to come\r\nin, and then, pointing to the bed, on which the old woman was stretched,\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"She cannot speak to me--she cannot move one side--she has been so these\r\nthree days--but she is not dead--she is not dead!"\r\n\r\nThe poor creature had been struck with the palsy. As Clarence went close\r\nto the bed, she opened her eyes, and fixing them upon him, she stretched\r\nout her withered hand, caught fast hold of her grand-daughter, and\r\nthen raising herself, with a violent effort, she pronounced the word\r\n"Begone!" Her face grew black, her features convulsed, and she sunk down\r\nagain in her bed, without power of utterance. Clarence left the house\r\ninstantly, mounted his horse, and galloped to the next town for medical\r\nassistance. The poor woman was so far recovered by a skilful apothecary,\r\nthat she could, in a few days, articulate so as to be understood. She\r\nknew that her end was approaching fast, and seemed piously resigned to\r\nher fate. Mr. Hervey went constantly to see her; but, though grateful\r\nto him for his humanity, and for the assistance he had procured for her,\r\nyet she appeared agitated when he was in the room, and frequently looked\r\nat him and at her grand-daughter with uncommon anxiety. At last, she\r\nwhispered something to the girl, who immediately left the room; and she\r\nthen beckoned to him to come closer to the arm-chair, in which she was\r\nseated.\r\n\r\n"May be, sir," said she, "you thought me out of my right mind the day\r\nwhen I was lying on that bed, and said to you in such a peremptory tone,\r\n\'Begone!\'--It was all I could say then; and, in truth, I cannot speak\r\nquite plain yet; nor ever shall again. But God\'s will be done. I had\r\nonly one thing to say to you, sir, about that poor girl of mine--"\r\n\r\nClarence listened to her with eagerness. She paused, and then laying her\r\ncold hand upon his, she looked up earnestly in his face, and continued,\r\n"You are a fine young gentleman, and you look like a good gentleman; but\r\nso did the man who broke the heart of her poor mother. Her mother was\r\ncarried off from a boarding-school, when she was scarcely sixteen, by a\r\nwretch, who, after privately marrying her, would not own his marriage,\r\nstayed with her but two years, then went abroad, left his wife and his\r\ninfant, and has never been heard of since. My daughter died of a broken\r\nheart. Rachel was then between three and four years old; a beautiful\r\nchild. God forgive her father!--God\'s will be done!"--She paused to\r\nsubdue her emotion, and then, with some difficulty, proceeded.\r\n\r\n"My only comfort is, I have bred Rachel up in innocence; I never sent\r\nher to a boarding-school. No, no; from the moment of her birth till now,\r\nI have kept her under my own eye. In this cottage she has lived with me,\r\naway from all the world. You are the first man she ever spoke to; the\r\nfirst man who ever was within these doors. She is innocence itself!--Oh,\r\nsir, as you hope for mercy when you are as I am now, spare the innocence\r\nof that poor child!--Never, never come here after her, when I am dead\r\nand gone! Consider, she is but a child, sir. God never made a better\r\ncreature. Oh, promise me you will not be the ruin of my sweet innocent\r\ngirl, and I shall die in peace!"\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey was touched. He instantly made the promise required of\r\nhim; and, as nothing less would satisfy the poor dying woman, confirmed\r\nit by a solemn oath.\r\n\r\n"Now I am easy," said she, "quite easy; and may God bless you for it! In\r\nthe village here, there is a Mrs. Smith, a good farmer\'s wife, who knows\r\nus well; she will see to have me decently buried, and then has promised\r\nto sell all the little I have for my girl, and to take care of her. And\r\nyou\'ll never come near her more?"\r\n\r\n"I did not promise that," said Hervey.\r\n\r\nThe old woman again looked much disturbed.\r\n\r\n"Ah, good young gentleman!" said she, "take my advice; it will be best\r\nfor you both. If you see her again, you will love her, sir--you can\'t\r\nhelp it; and if she sees you--poor thing, how innocently she smiled when\r\nshe gave you the rose!--oh, sir, never come near her when I am gone! It\r\nis too late for me now to get her out of your way. This night, I\'m sure,\r\nwill be my last in this world--oh, promise me you will never come here\r\nagain!"\r\n\r\n"After the oath I have taken," replied Clarence, "that promise would be\r\nunnecessary. Trust to my honour."\r\n\r\n"Honour! Oh, that was the word the gentleman said that betrayed her poor\r\nmother, and left her afterwards to die.\'--Oh, sir, sir----"\r\n\r\nThe violent emotion that she felt was too much for her--she fell back\r\nexhausted--never spoke more--and an hour afterwards she expired in the\r\narms of her grand-daughter. The poor girl could not believe that she\r\nhad breathed her last. She made a sign to the surgeon, and to Clarence\r\nHervey, who stood beside her, to be silent; and listened, fancying that\r\nthe corpse would breathe again. Then she kissed her cold lips, and the\r\nshrivelled cheeks, and the eyelids that were closed for ever. She warmed\r\nthe dead fingers with her breath--she raised the heavy arm, and when\r\nit fell she perceived there was no hope: she threw herself upon her\r\nknees:--"She is dead!" she exclaimed; "and she has died without giving\r\nme her blessing! She can never bless me again."\r\n\r\nThey took her into the air, and Clarence Hervey sprinkled water upon\r\nher face. It was a fine night, and the fresh air soon brought her to her\r\nsenses. He then said that he would leave her to the care of the surgeon,\r\nand ride to the village in search of that Mrs. Smith who had promised to\r\nbe her friend.\r\n\r\n"And so _you_ are going away from me, too?" said she; and she burst into\r\ntears. At the sight of these tears Clarence turned away, and hurried\r\nfrom her. He sent the woman from the village, but returned no more that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHer simplicity, sensibility, and, perhaps more than he was aware, her\r\nbeauty, had pleased and touched him extremely. The idea of attaching a\r\nperfectly pure, disinterested, unpractised heart, was delightful to his\r\nimagination: the cultivation of her understanding, he thought, would\r\nbe an easy and a pleasing task: all difficulties vanished before his\r\nsanguine hopes.\r\n\r\n"Sensibility," said he to himself, "is the parent of great talents\r\nand great virtues; and evidently she possesses natural feeling in\r\nan uncommon degree: it shall be developed with skill, patience, and\r\ndelicacy; and I will deserve before I claim my reward."\r\n\r\nThe next day he returned to the cottage, accompanied by an elderly lady,\r\na Mrs. Ormond; the same lady who afterward, to Marriott\'s prejudiced\r\neyes, had appeared _more like a dragon than any thing else_, but who, to\r\nthis simple, unsuspicious girl, seemed like what she really was, a truly\r\ngood-natured, benevolent woman. She consented, most readily, to put\r\nherself under the protection of Mrs. Ormond, "provided Mrs. Smith would\r\ngive her leave." There was no difficulty in persuading Mrs. Smith that\r\nit was for her advantage. Mrs. Smith, who was a plain farmer\'s wife,\r\ntold all that she knew of Rachel\'s history; but all that she knew was\r\nlittle. She had heard only hints at odd times from the old woman: these\r\nagreed perfectly with what Mr. Hervey had already heard.\r\n\r\n"The _old gentlewoman_," said Mrs. Smith, "as I believe I should call\r\nher by rights, has lived in the forest there, where you found her,\r\nthese many a year--she earned her subsistence by tending bees and making\r\nrose-water--she was a good soul, but very particular, especially about\r\nher grand-daughter, which, considering all things, one cannot blame her\r\nfor. She often told me she would never put Rachel to a boarding-school,\r\nwhich I approved, seeing she had no fortune; and it is the ruin of\r\ngirls, to my mind, to be bred above their means--as it was of her\r\nmother, sir. Then she would never teach Rachel to write, for fear she\r\nshould take to scrawling nonsense of love-letters, as her mother did\r\nbefore her. Now, sir, this I approved too, for I don\'t much mind about\r\nbook-learning myself; and I even thought it would have been as well if\r\nthe girl had not learnt to read; but that she did learn, and was\r\nalways fond of, and I\'m sure it was more plague than use too to her\r\ngrandmother, for she was as particular about the books that the girl was\r\nto read as about all the rest. She went farther than all that, sir, for\r\nshe never would let the girl speak to a man--not a man ever entered the\r\ndoors of the house."\r\n\r\n"So she told me."\r\n\r\n"And she told you true enough. But there, I thought, she was quite\r\nwrong; for seeing the girl must, some time or other, speak to men,\r\nwhere was the use of her not learning to do it properly?--Lord, ma\'am,"\r\ncontinued Mrs. Smith, addressing herself to Mrs. Ormond, "Lord, ma\'am,\r\nthough it is a sin to be remembering so much of the particularities\r\nof the dead, I must say there never was an old lady who had more\r\nscrupulosities than the deceased. I verily thought, one day, she would\r\nhave gone into fits about a picture of a man, that Rachel lit upon by\r\naccident, as if a picture had any sense to hurt a body! Now if it had\r\nbeen one of your naked pictures, there might have been some delicacy in\r\nher dislike to it; but it was no such thing, but a very proper picture.\r\n\r\n"A picture, ma\'am, of a young sea-officer, in his full uniform--quite\r\nproper, ma\'am. It was his mother that left it with me, and I had it\r\nalways in my own room, and the girl saw it, and was mightily taken with\r\nit, being the first thing of the kind she had ever lit upon, and the\r\nold lady comes in, _and took on_, till I verily thought she was crazed.\r\nLord! I really could not but laugh; but I checked myself, when the poor\r\nold soul\'s eyes filled with tears, which made me know she was thinking\r\nof her daughter that was dead. When I thought on the cause of\r\nher particularity about Rachel, I could not laugh any more at her\r\nstrangeness.\r\n\r\n"I promised the good lady that day, in case of her death, to take care\r\nof her grand-daughter; and I thought in my own mind that, in time to\r\ncome, if one of my boys should take a fancy to her, I should make no\r\nobjections, because she was always a good, modest-behaved girl; and, I\'m\r\nsure, would make a good wife, though too delicate for hard country work;\r\nbut, as it pleases God to send you, madam, and the good gentleman, to\r\ntake the charge of her off my hands, I am content it should be so, and I\r\nwill sell every thing here for her honestly, and bring it to you, madam,\r\nfor poor Rachel."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing that Rachel was anxious to carry away with her but\r\na little bullfinch, of which she was very fond. One, and but one,\r\ncircumstance about Rachel stopped the current of Clarence Hervey\'s\r\nimagination, and this, consequently, was excessively disagreeable to\r\nhim--her name: the name of Rachel he could not endure, and he thought it\r\nso unsuited to her, that he could scarcely believe it belonged to her.\r\nHe consequently resolved to change it as soon as possible. The first\r\ntime that he beheld her, he was struck with the idea that she resembled\r\nthe description of Virginia in M. de St. Pierre\'s celebrated romance;\r\nand by this name he always called her, from the hour that she quitted\r\nher cottage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond, the lady whom he had engaged to take care of his Virginia,\r\nwas a widow, the mother of a gentleman who had been his tutor at\r\ncollege. Her son died, and left her in such narrow circumstances, that\r\nshe was obliged to apply to her friends for pecuniary assistance.\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey had been liberal in his contributions; from his childhood he\r\nhad known her worth, and her attachment to him was blended with the most\r\nprofound respect. She was not a woman of superior abilities, or of\r\nmuch information; but her excellent temper and gentle disposition won\r\naffection, though she had not any talents to excite admiration. Mr.\r\nHervey had perfect confidence in her integrity; he believed that she\r\nwould exactly comply with his directions, and he thought that her want\r\nof literature and ingenuity could easily be supplied by his own care and\r\ninstructions. He took a house for her and his fair pupil at Windsor, and\r\nhe exacted a solemn promise that she would neither receive nor pay any\r\nvisits. Virginia was thus secluded from all intercourse with the world:\r\nshe saw no one but Mrs. Ormond, Clarence Hervey, and Mr. Moreton, an\r\nelderly clergyman, whom Mr. Hervey engaged to attend every Sunday to\r\nread prayers for them at home. Virginia never expressed the slightest\r\ncuriosity to see any other persons, or any thing beyond the walls of\r\nthe garden that belonged to the house in which she lived; her present\r\nretirement was not greater than that to which she had long been\r\naccustomed, and consequently she did not feel her seclusion from the\r\nworld as any restraint: with the circumstances that were altered in her\r\nsituation she seemed neither to be dazzled nor charmed; the objects\r\nof convenience or luxury that were new to her she looked upon with\r\nindifference; but with any thing that reminded her of her former way of\r\nlife, and of her grandmother\'s cottage, she was delighted.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Hervey asked her, whether she should like better to return\r\nto that cottage, or to remain where she was? He trembled for her answer.\r\nShe innocently replied, "I should like best to go back to the cottage,\r\nif you would go with me--but I would rather stay here with you than live\r\nthere without you."\r\n\r\nClarence was touched and flattered by this artless answer, and for some\r\ntime he discovered every day fresh indications, as he thought, of virtue\r\nand abilities in his charming pupil. Her indifference to objects of show\r\nand ornament appeared to him an indisputable proof of her magnanimity,\r\nand of the superiority of her unprejudiced mind. What a difference,\r\nthought he, between this child of nature and the frivolous,\r\nsophisticated slaves of art!\r\n\r\nTo try and prove the simplicity of her taste, and the purity of her\r\nmind, he once presented to her a pair of diamond earrings and a moss\r\nrosebud, and asked her to take whichever she liked best. She eagerly\r\nsnatched the rose, crying, "Oh! it puts me in mind of the cottage:--how\r\nsweet it smells!"\r\n\r\nShe placed it in her bosom, and then, looking at the diamonds, said,\r\n"They are pretty, sparkling things--what are they? of what use are\r\nthey?" and she looked with more curiosity and admiration at the manner\r\nin which the earring shut and opened than at the diamonds. Clarence was\r\ncharmed with her. When Mrs. Ormond told her that these things were to\r\nhang in her ears, she laughed and said, "How! how can I make them hang?"\r\n\r\n"Have you never observed that I wear earrings?" said Mrs. Ormond.\r\n\r\n"Ay! but yours are not like these, and--let me look--I never saw how you\r\nfastened them--let me look--oh! you have holes in your ears; but I have\r\nnone in mine."\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond told her that holes could easily be made in her ears, by\r\nrunning a steel pin through them. She shrunk back, defending her\r\near with one hand, and pushing the diamonds from her with the other,\r\nexclaiming, "Oh, no, no!--unless," added she, changing her tone, and\r\nturning to Clarence, "unless you wish it:--if you bid me, I will."\r\n\r\nClarence was scarcely master of himself at this instant; and it was with\r\nthe utmost difficulty that he could reply to her with that dispassionate\r\ncalmness which became his situation and hers. And yet there was more of\r\nignorance and timidity, perhaps, than of sound sense or philosophy\r\nin Virginia\'s indifference to diamonds; she did not consider them as\r\nornaments that would confer distinction upon their possessor, because\r\nshe was ignorant of the value affixed to them by society. Isolated in\r\nthe world, she had no excitements to the love of finery, no competition,\r\nno means of comparison, or opportunities of display; diamonds were\r\nconsequently as useless to her as guineas were to Robinson Crusoe on\r\nhis desert island. It could not justly be said that he was free from\r\navarice, because he set no value on the gold; or that she was free from\r\nvanity, because she rejected the diamonds. These reflections could not\r\npossibly have escaped a man of Clarence Hervey\'s abilities, had he not\r\nbeen engaged in defence of a favourite system of education, or if his\r\npupil had not been quite so handsome. Virginia\'s absolute ignorance\r\nof the world frequently gave an air of originality to her most\r\ntrivial observations, which made her appear at once interesting and\r\nentertaining. All her ideas of happiness were confined to the life she\r\nhad led during her childhood; and as she had accidentally lived in\r\na beautiful situation in the New Forest, she appeared to have an\r\ninstinctive taste for the beauties of nature, and for what we call the\r\npicturesque. This taste Mr. Hervey perceived, whenever he showed\r\nher prints and drawings, and it was a fresh source of delight and\r\nself-complacency to him. All that was amiable or estimable in Virginia\r\nhad a double charm, from the secret sense of his penetration, in having\r\ndiscovered and appreciated the treasure. The affections of this innocent\r\ngirl had no object but himself and Mrs. Ormond, and they were\r\nstrong, perhaps, in proportion as they were concentrated. The artless\r\nfamiliarity of her manner, and her unsuspicious confidence, amounting\r\nalmost to credulity, had irresistible power over Mr. Hervey\'s mind; he\r\nfelt them as appeals at once to his tenderness and his generosity. He\r\ntreated her with the utmost delicacy, and his oath was never absent from\r\nhis mind: but he felt proudly convinced, that if he had not been bound\r\nby any such solemn engagement, no temptation could have made him deceive\r\nand betray confiding innocence.\r\n\r\nConscious that his views were honourable, anticipating the generous\r\npleasure he should have in showing his superiority to all mercenary\r\nconsiderations and worldly prejudices, in the choice of a wife,\r\nhe indulged, with a species of pride, his increasing attachment to\r\nVirginia; but he was not sensible of the rapid progress of the passion,\r\ntill he was suddenly awakened by a few simple observations of Mrs.\r\nOrmond.\r\n\r\n"This is Virginia\'s birthday--she tells me she is seventeen to-day."\r\n\r\n"Seventeen!--is she only seventeen?" cried Clarence, with a mixture of\r\nsurprise and disappointment in his countenance--"Only seventeen! Why she\r\nis but a child still."\r\n\r\n"Quite a child," said Mrs. Ormond; "and so much the better."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse, I think," said Clarence. "But are you sure she\'s\r\nonly seventeen?--she must be mistaken--she must be eighteen, at least."\r\n\r\n"God forbid!"\r\n\r\n"God forbid!--Why, Mrs. Ormond?"\r\n\r\n"Because, you know, we have a year more before us."\r\n\r\n"That may be a very satisfactory prospect to you," said Mr. Hervey,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"And to you, surely," said Mrs. Ormond; "for, I suppose, you would be\r\nglad that your wife should, at least, know the common things that every\r\nbody knows."\r\n\r\n"As to that," said Clarence, "I should be glad that my wife were\r\nignorant of what _every body knows_. Nothing is so tiresome to a man of\r\nany taste or abilities as _what every body knows_. I am rather desirous\r\nto have a wife who has an uncommon than a common understanding."\r\n\r\n"But you would choose, would not you," said Mrs. Ormond, hesitating with\r\nan air of great deference, "that your wife should know how to write?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure," replied Clarence, colouring. "Does not Virginia know how\r\nto write?"\r\n\r\n"How should she?" said Mrs. Ormond: "it is no fault of hers, poor\r\ngirl--she was never taught. You know it was her grandmother\'s notion\r\nthat she should not learn to write, lest she should write love-letters."\r\n\r\n"But _you_ promised that she should be taught to write, and I trusted to\r\nyou, Mrs. Ormond."\r\n\r\n"She has been here only two months, and all that time, I am sure, I have\r\ndone every thing in my power; but when a person comes to be sixteen or\r\nseventeen, it is up-hill work."\r\n\r\n"I will teach her myself," cried Clarence: "I am sure she may be taught\r\nany thing."\r\n\r\n"By you," said Mrs. Ormond, smiling; "but not by me."\r\n\r\n"You have no doubts of her capacity, surely?"\r\n\r\n"I am no judge of capacity, especially of the capacity of those I love;\r\nand I am grown very fond of Virginia; she is a charming, open-hearted,\r\nsimple, affectionate creature. I rather think it is from indolence that\r\nshe does not learn, and not from want of abilities."\r\n\r\n"All indolence arises from want of excitement," said Clarence: "if she\r\nhad proper motives, she would conquer her indolence."\r\n\r\n"Why, I dare say, if I were to tell her that she would never have a\r\nletter from Mr. Hervey till she is able to write an answer, she would\r\nlearn to write very expeditiously; but I thought that would not be a\r\nproper motive, because you forbade me to tell her your future views. And\r\nindeed it would be highly imprudent, on your account, as well as hers,\r\nto give her any hint of that kind: because you might change your mind,\r\nbefore she\'s old enough for you to think of her seriously, and then\r\nyou would not know what to do with her; and after entertaining hopes\r\nof becoming your wife, she would be miserable, I am sure, with that\r\naffectionate tender heart of hers, if you were to leave her. Now that\r\nshe knows nothing of the matter, we are all safe, and as we should be."\r\n\r\nThough Clarence Hervey did not at this time foresee any great\r\nprobability of his changing his mind, yet he felt the good sense and\r\njustice of Mrs. Ormond\'s suggestions; and he was alarmed to perceive\r\nthat his mind had been so intoxicated as to suffer such obvious\r\nreflections to escape his attention. Mrs. Ormond, a woman whom he had\r\nbeen accustomed to consider as far his inferior in capacity, he now felt\r\nwas superior to him in prudence, merely because she was undisturbed by\r\npassion. He resolved to master his own mind: to consider that it was\r\nnot a mistress, but a wife he wanted in Virginia; that a wife without\r\ncapacity or without literature could never be a companion suited to him,\r\nlet her beauty or sensibility be ever so exquisite and captivating. The\r\nhappiness of his life and of hers were at stake, and every motive of\r\nprudence and delicacy called upon him to command his affections. He\r\nwas, however, still sanguine in his expectations from Virginia\'s\r\nunderstanding, and from his own power of developing her capacity. He\r\nmade several attempts, with the greatest skill and patience; and his\r\nfair pupil, though she did not by any means equal his hopes, astonished\r\nMrs. Ormond by her comparatively rapid progress.\r\n\r\n"I always believed that you could make her any thing you pleased," said\r\nshe. "You are a tutor who can work miracles with Virginia."\r\n\r\n"I see no miracles," replied Clarence; "I am conscious of no such power.\r\nI should be sorry to possess any such influence, until I am sure that it\r\nwould be for our mutual happiness."\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey then conjured Mrs. Ormond, by all her attachment to him and\r\nto her pupil, never to give Virginia the most distant idea that he had\r\nany intentions of making her his wife. She promised to do all that was\r\nin her power to keep this secret, but she could not help observing that\r\nit had already been betrayed, as plainly as looks could speak, by Mr.\r\nHervey himself. Clarence in vain endeavoured to exculpate himself from\r\nthis charge: Mrs. Ormond brought to his recollection so many instances\r\nof his indiscretion, that it was substantiated even in his own\r\njudgment, and he was amazed to find that all the time he had put so much\r\nconstraint upon his inclinations, he had, nevertheless, so obviously\r\nbetrayed them. His surprise, however, was at this time unmixed with any\r\npainful regret; he did not foresee the probability that he should change\r\nhis mind; and notwithstanding Mrs. Ormond assured him that Virginia\'s\r\nsensibility had increased, he was persuaded that she was mistaken, and\r\nthat his pupil\'s heart and imagination were yet untouched. The innocent\r\nopenness with which she expressed her affection for him confirmed him,\r\nhe said, in his opinion. To do him justice, Clarence had none of the\r\npresumption which too often characterizes men who have been successful,\r\nas it is called, with the fair sex. His acquaintance with women had\r\nincreased his persuasion that it is difficult to excite genuine love\r\nin the heart; and with respect to himself, he was upon this subject\r\nastonishingly incredulous. It was scarcely possible to convince him that\r\nhe was beloved.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond, piqued upon this subject, determined to ascertain more\r\ndecisively her pupil\'s sentiments.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said she, one day to Virginia, who was feeding her bullfinch,\r\n"I do believe you are fonder of that bird than of any thing in the\r\nworld--fonder of it, I am sure, than of me."\r\n\r\n"Oh! you cannot think so," said Virginia, with an affectionate smile.\r\n\r\n"Well! fonder than you are of Mr. Hervey, you will allow, at least?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed!" cried she, eagerly: "how can you think me so foolish, so\r\nchildish, so ungrateful, as to prefer a little worthless bird to\r\nhim--" (the bullfinch began to sing so loud at this instant, that her\r\nenthusiastic speech was stopped). "My pretty bird," said she, as it\r\nperched upon her hand, "I love you very much, but if Mr. Hervey were to\r\nask it, to wish it, I would open that window, and let you fly; yes, and\r\nbid you fly away far from me for ever. Perhaps he does wish it?--Does\r\nhe?--Did he tell you so?" cried she, looking earnestly in Mrs. Ormond\'s\r\nface, as she moved towards the window.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond put her hand upon the sash, as Virginia was going to throw\r\nit up--\r\n\r\n"Gently, gently, my love--whither is your imagination carrying you?"\r\n\r\n"I thought _something_ by your look," said Virginia, blushing.\r\n\r\n"And I thought _something_, my dear Virginia," said Mrs. Ormond,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"What did you think?--What _could_ you think?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot--I mean, I would rather not at present tell you. But do not\r\nlook so grave; I will tell you some time or other, if you cannot guess."\r\n\r\nVirginia was silent, and stood abashed.\r\n\r\n"I am sure, my sweet girl," said Mrs. Ormond, "I do not mean, by any\r\nthing I said, to confuse or blame you. It is very natural that you\r\nshould be grateful to Mr. Hervey, and that you should admire, and, _to a\r\ncertain degree, love_ him."\r\n\r\nVirginia looked up delighted, yet with some hesitation in her manner.\r\n\r\n"He is, indeed," said Mrs. Ormond, "one of the first of human beings:\r\nsuch even _I_ have always thought him; and I am sure I like you the\r\nbetter, my dear, for your sensibility," said she, kissing Virginia as\r\nshe spoke; "only we must take care of it, or this tenderness might go\r\ntoo far."\r\n\r\n"How so?" said Virginia, returning her caresses with fondness: "can I\r\nlove you and Mr. Hervey too much?"\r\n\r\n"Not me."\r\n\r\n"Nor him, I\'m sure--he is so good, so very good! I am afraid that I do\r\nnot love him _enough_," said she, sighing. "I love him enough when he\r\nis absent, but not when he is present. When he is near I feel a sort of\r\nfear mixed with my love. I wish to please him very much, but I should\r\nnot quite like that he should show his love for me as you do--as you did\r\njust now."\r\n\r\n"My dear, it would not be proper that he should; you are quite right not\r\nto wish it."\r\n\r\n"Am I? I was afraid that it was a sign of my not liking him as much as I\r\nought."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my poor child! you love him full as much as you ought."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so? I am glad of it," said Virginia, with a look of such\r\nconfiding simplicity, that her friend was touched to the heart.\r\n\r\n"I do think so, my love," said Mrs. Ormond; "and I hope I shall never\r\nbe sorry for it, nor you either. But it is not proper that we should say\r\nany more upon this subject now. Where are your drawings? Where is your\r\nwriting? My dear, we must get forward with these things as fast as we\r\ncan. That is the way to please Mr. Hervey, I can tell you."\r\n\r\nConfirmed by this conversation in her own opinion, Mrs. Ormond was\r\nsatisfied. From delicacy to her pupil, she did not repeat all that had\r\npassed to Mr. Hervey, resolving to wait till the _proper_ moment. "She\r\nis too young and too childish for him to think of marrying her yet,\r\nfor a year or two," thought she; "and it is better to repress her\r\nsensibility till her education is more finished; by that time Mr. Hervey\r\nwill find out his mistake."\r\n\r\nIn the mean time she could not help thinking that he was blind, for he\r\ncontinued steady in his belief of Virginia\'s indifference.\r\n\r\nTo dissipate his own mind, and to give time for the development of hers,\r\nhe now, according to his resolution, left his pupil to the care of Mrs.\r\nOrmond, and mixed as much as possible in gay and fashionable company. It\r\nwas at this period that he renewed his acquaintance with Lady Delacour,\r\nwhom he had seen and admired before he went abroad. He found that his\r\ngallantry, on the famous day of the battle between the turkeys and pigs,\r\nwas still remembered with gratitude by her ladyship; she received him\r\nwith marked courtesy, and he soon became a constant visitor at her\r\nhouse. Her wit entertained, her eloquence charmed him, and he followed,\r\nadmired, and _gallanted_ her, without scruple, for he considered\r\nher merely as a coquette, who preferred the glory of conquest to the\r\nsecurity of reputation. With such a woman he thought he could amuse\r\nhimself without danger, and he every where appeared the foremost in the\r\npublic train of her ladyship\'s admirers. He soon discovered, however,\r\nthat her talents were far superior to what are necessary for playing the\r\npart of a fine lady; his visits became more and more agreeable to him,\r\nand he was glad to feel, that, by dividing his attention, his passion\r\nfor Virginia insensibly diminished, or, as he said to himself, became\r\nmore reasonable. In conversing with Lady Delacour, his faculties were\r\nalways called into full play; in talking to Virginia, his understanding\r\nwas passive: he perceived that a large proportion of his intellectual\r\npowers, and of his knowledge, was absolutely useless to him in her\r\ncompany; and this did not raise her either in his love or esteem. Her\r\nsimplicity and naivete, however, sometimes relieved him, after he had\r\nbeen fatigued by the extravagant gaiety and _glare_ of her ladyship\'s\r\nmanners; and he reflected that the coquetry which amused him in an\r\nacquaintance would be odious in a wife: the perfect innocence of\r\nVirginia promised security to his domestic happiness, and he did not\r\nchange his views, though he was less eager for the period of their\r\naccomplishment. "I cannot expect every thing that is desirable," said he\r\nto himself: "a more brilliant character than Virginia\'s would excite my\r\nadmiration, but could not command my confidence."\r\n\r\nIt was whilst his mind was in this situation that he became acquainted\r\nwith Belinda. At first, the idea of her having been educated by the\r\nmatch-making Mrs. Stanhope prejudiced him against her; but as he\r\nhad opportunities of observing her conduct, this prepossession was\r\nconquered, and when she had secured his esteem, he could no longer\r\nresist her power over his heart. In comparison with Belinda, Virginia\r\nappeared to him but an insipid, though innocent child: the one he\r\nfound was his equal, the other his inferior; the one he saw could be\r\na companion, a friend to him for life, the other would merely be\r\nhis pupil, or his plaything. Belinda had cultivated taste, an active\r\nunderstanding, a knowledge of literature, the power and the habit of\r\nconducting herself; Virginia was ignorant and indolent, she had\r\nfew ideas, and no wish to extend her knowledge; she was so entirely\r\nunacquainted with the world, that it was absolutely impossible she could\r\nconduct herself with that discretion, which must be the combined result\r\nof reasoning and experience. Mr. Hervey had felt gratuitous confidence\r\nin Virginia\'s innocence; but on Belinda\'s prudence, which he had\r\nopportunities of seeing tried, he gradually learned to feel a different\r\nand a higher species of reliance, which it is neither in our power to\r\nbestow nor to refuse. The virtues of Virginia sprang from sentiment;\r\nthose of Belinda from reason.\r\n\r\nClarence, whilst he made all these comparisons, became every day more\r\nwisely and more fondly attached to Belinda; and at length he became\r\ndesirous to change the nature of his connexion with Virginia, and to\r\nappear to her only in the light of a friend or a benefactor. He thought\r\nof giving her a suitable fortune and of leaving her under the care of\r\nMrs. Ormond, till some method of establishing her in the world should\r\noccur. Unfortunately, just at the time when Mr. Hervey formed this plan,\r\nand before it was communicated to Mrs. Ormond, difficulties arose which\r\nprevented him from putting it into execution.\r\n\r\nWhilst he had been engaged in the gay world at Lady Delacour\'s, his\r\npupil had necessarily been left much to the management of Mrs. Ormond.\r\nThis lady, with the best possible intentions, had not that reach of mind\r\nand variety of resource necessary to direct the exquisite sensibility\r\nand ardent imagination of Virginia: the solitude in which she lived\r\nadded to the difficulty of the task. Without companions to interest\r\nher social affections, without real objects to occupy her senses\r\nand understanding, Virginia\'s mind was either perfectly indolent, or\r\n_exalted_ by romantic views, and visionary ideas of happiness. As she\r\nhad never seen any thing of society, all her notions were drawn from\r\nbooks; the severe restrictions which her grandmother had early laid upon\r\nthe choice of these seemed to have awakened her curiosity, and to have\r\nincreased her appetite for books--it was insatiable. Reading, indeed,\r\nwas now almost her only pleasure; for Mrs. Ormond\'s conversation was\r\nseldom entertaining, and Virginia had no longer those occupations which\r\nfilled a portion of her day at the cottage.\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey had cautioned Mrs. Ormond against putting _common_ novels\r\ninto her hands, but he made no objection to romances: these, he thought,\r\nbreathed a spirit favourable to female virtue, exalted the respect for\r\nchastity, and inspired enthusiastic admiration of honour, generosity,\r\ntruth, and all the noble qualities which dignify human nature. Virginia\r\ndevoured these romances with the greatest eagerness; and Mrs. Ormond,\r\nwho found her a prey to ennui when her fancy was not amused, indulged\r\nher taste; yet she strongly suspected that they contributed to increase\r\nher passion for the only man who could, in her imagination, represent a\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nOne night Virginia found, in Mrs. Ormond\'s room, a volume of St.\r\nPierre\'s Paul and Virginia. She knew that her own name had been taken\r\nfrom this romance; Mr. Hervey had her picture painted in this character;\r\nand these circumstances strongly excited her curiosity to read the book.\r\nMrs. Ormond could not refuse to let her have it; for, though it was not\r\nan ancient romance, it did not exactly come under the description of\r\na common novel, and Mr. Hervey was not at hand to give his advice.\r\nVirginia sat down instantly to her volume, and never stirred from the\r\nspot till she had nearly finished it.\r\n\r\n"What is it that strikes your fancy so much? What are you considering so\r\ndeeply, my love?" said Mrs. Ormond, observing, that she seemed lost\r\nin thought. "Let us see, my dear," continued she, offering to take the\r\nhook, which hung from her hand. Virginia started from her reverie, but\r\nheld the volume fast.--"Will not you let me read along with you?" said\r\nMrs. Ormond. "Won\'t you let me share your pleasure?"\r\n\r\n"It was not pleasure that I felt, I believe," said Virginia. "I would\r\nrather you should not see just that particular part that I was reading;\r\nand yet, if you desire it," added she, resigning the book reluctantly.\r\n\r\n"What can make you so much afraid of me, my sweet girl?"\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid of you--but--of myself," said Virginia, sighing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond read the following passage:\r\n\r\n "She thought of Paul\'s friendship, more pure than the waters\r\n of the fountain, stronger than the united palms, and sweeter than\r\n the perfume of flowers; and these images, in night and in\r\n solitude, gave double force to the passion which she nourished\r\n in her heart. She suddenly left the dangerous shades, and\r\n went to her mother, to seek protection against herself. She\r\n wished to reveal her distress to her; she pressed her hands, and\r\n the name of Paul was on her lips; but the oppression of her\r\n heart took away all utterance, and, laying her head upon her\r\n mother\'s bosom, she only wept."\r\n\r\n"And am I not a mother to you, my beloved Virginia?" said Mrs. Ormond.\r\n"Though I cannot express my affection in such charming language as this,\r\nyet, believe me, no mother was ever fonder of a child."\r\n\r\nVirginia threw her arms round Mrs. Ormond, and laid her head upon her\r\nfriend\'s bosom, as if she wished to realize the illusion, and to be the\r\nVirginia of whom she had been reading.\r\n\r\n"I know all you think, and all you feel: I know," whispered Mrs. Ormond,\r\n"the name that is on _your_ lips."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, you do not; you cannot," cried Virginia, suddenly raising\r\nher head, and looking up in Mrs. Ormond\'s face, with surprise and\r\ntimidity: "how could you possibly know _all_ my thoughts and feelings? I\r\nnever told them to you; for, indeed, I have only confused ideas\r\nfloating in my imagination from the books I have been reading. I do not\r\ndistinctly know my own feelings."\r\n\r\n"This is all very natural, and a proof of your perfect innocence and\r\nsimplicity, my child. But why did the passage you were reading just now\r\nstrike you so much?"\r\n\r\n"I was only considering," said Virginia, "whether it was the description\r\nof--love."\r\n\r\n"And your heart told you that it was?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said she, sighing. "But of this I am certain, that I had\r\nnot the name, which you were thinking of, upon my lips."\r\n\r\nAh! thought Mrs. Ormond, she has not forgotten how I checked her\r\nsensibility some time ago. Poor girl! she is become afraid of me, and I\r\nhave taught her to dissemble; but she betrays herself every moment.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Mrs. Ormond, "you need not fear me--I cannot blame\r\nyou: in your situation, it is impossible that you could help loving Mr.\r\nHervey."\r\n\r\n"Is it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; quite impossible. So do not blame yourself for it."\r\n\r\n"No, I do not blame myself for that. I only blame myself for not loving\r\nhim _enough_, as I told you once before."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear; and the oftener you tell me so, the more I am convinced\r\nof your affection. It is one of the strongest symptoms of love, that we\r\nare unconscious of its extent. We fancy that we can never do too much\r\nfor the beloved object."\r\n\r\n"That is exactly what I feel about Mr. Hervey."\r\n\r\n"That we can never love him enough."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that is precisely what I feel for Mr. Hervey."\r\n\r\n"And what you ought--I mean, what it is natural you should feel; and\r\nwhat he will himself, I hope, indeed I dare say, some time or other\r\nwish, and be glad that you should feel."\r\n\r\n"Some time or other! Does not he wish it now?"\r\n\r\n"I--he--my dear, what a question is that? And how shall I answer it? We\r\nmust judge of what he feels by what he expresses: when he expresses love\r\nfor you, it will then be the time to show yours for him."\r\n\r\n"He has always expressed love for me, I think," said Virginia--"always,\r\ntill lately," continued she; "but lately he has been away so much, and\r\nwhen he comes home, he does not look so well pleased; so that I was\r\nafraid he was angry with me, and that he thought me ungrateful."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my love, do not torment yourself with these vain fears! And yet I\r\nknow that you cannot help it."\r\n\r\n"Since you are so kind, so very kind to me," said Virginia, "I will tell\r\nyou all my fears and doubts. But it is late--there! the clock struck\r\none. I will not keep you up."\r\n\r\n"I am not at all sleepy," said the indulgent Mrs. Ormond.\r\n\r\n"Nor I," said Virginia,\r\n\r\n"Now, then," said Mrs. Ormond, "for these doubts and fears."\r\n\r\n"I was afraid that, perhaps, Mr. Hervey would be angry if he knew that I\r\nthought of any thing in the world but him."\r\n\r\n"Of what else do you think?--Of nothing else from morning till night,\r\nthat I can see."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then you do not see into my mind. In the daytime often think of\r\nthose heroes, those charming heroes, that I read of in the books you\r\nhave given me."\r\n\r\n"To be sure you do."\r\n\r\n"And is not that wrong? Would not Mr. Hervey be displeased if he knew\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Why should he?"\r\n\r\n"Because they are not quite like him. I love some of them better than I\r\ndo him, and he might think that _ungrateful_."\r\n\r\nHow naturally love inspires the idea of jealousy, thought Mrs. Ormond.\r\n"My dear," said she, "you carry your ideas of delicacy and gratitude to\r\nan extreme; but it is very natural you should: however, you need not\r\nbe afraid; Mr. Hervey cannot be jealous of those charming heroes, that\r\nnever existed, though they are not quite like him."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad that he would not think me ungrateful--but if he knew\r\nthat I dream of them sometimes?"\r\n\r\n"He would think you dreamed, as all people do, of what they think of in\r\nthe daytime."\r\n\r\n"And he would not be angry? I am very glad of it. But I once saw a\r\npicture--"\r\n\r\n"I know you did--well," said Mrs. Ormond, "and your grandmother was\r\nfrightened because it was the picture of a man--hey? If she was not your\r\ngrandmother, I should say that she was a simpleton. I assure you, Mr.\r\nHervey is not like her, if that is what you mean to ask. He would not be\r\nangry at your having seen fifty pictures."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of it--but I see it very often in my dreams."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you had seen more pictures, you would not see this so often.\r\nIt was the first you ever saw, and very naturally you remember it, Mr.\r\nHervey would not be angry at that," said Mrs. Ormond, laughing.\r\n\r\n"But sometimes, in my dreams, it speaks to me."\r\n\r\n"And what does it say?"\r\n\r\n"The same sort of things that those heroes I read of say to their\r\nmistresses."\r\n\r\n"And do you never, in your dreams, hear Mr. Hervey say this sort of\r\nthings?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"And do you never see Mr. Hervey in these dreams?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes; but he does not speak to me; he does not look at me with the\r\nsame sort of tenderness, and he does not throw himself at my feet."\r\n\r\n"No; because he has never done all this in reality."\r\n\r\n"No; and I wonder how I come to dream of such things."\r\n\r\n"So do I; but you have read and thought of them, it is plain. Now go\r\nto sleep, there\'s my good girl; that is the best thing you can do at\r\npresent--go to sleep."\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this conversation that Sir Philip Baddely and Mr.\r\nRochfort scaled the garden wall, to obtain a sight of Clarence Hervey\'s\r\nmistress. Virginia was astonished, terrified, and disgusted, by their\r\nappearance; they seemed to her a species of animals for which she had\r\nno name, and of which she had no prototype in her imagination. That they\r\nwere men she saw; but they were clearly not _Clarence Herveys_: they\r\nbore still less resemblance to the courteous knights of chivalry. Their\r\nlanguage was so different from any of the books she had read, and any of\r\nthe conversations she had heard, that they were scarcely intelligible.\r\nAfter they had forced themselves into her presence, they did not scruple\r\nto address her in the most unceremonious manner. Amongst other rude\r\nthings, they said, "Damme, my pretty dear, you cannot love the man that\r\nkeeps you prisoner in this manner, hey? Damme, you\'d better come and\r\nlive with one of us. You can\'t love this tyrant of a fellow."\r\n\r\n"He is not a tyrant--I _do_ love him as much as I detest you," cried\r\nVirginia, shrinking from him with looks of horror.\r\n\r\n"Damme! good actress! Put her on the stage when he is tired of her. So\r\nyou won\'t come with us?--Good bye, till we see you again. You\'re right,\r\nmy girl, to be upon your good behaviour; may be you may get him to marry\r\nyou, child!"\r\n\r\nVirginia, upon hearing this speech, turned from the man who insulted\r\nher with a degree of haughty indignation, of which her gentle nature had\r\nnever before appeared capable.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond hoped, that after the alarm was over, the circumstance would\r\npass away from her pupil\'s mind; but on the contrary, it left the most\r\nforcible impression. Virginia became silent and melancholy, and whole\r\nhours were spent in reverie. Mrs. Ormond imagined, that notwithstanding\r\nVirginia\'s entire ignorance of the world, she had acquired from books\r\nsufficient knowledge to be alarmed at the idea of being taken for\r\nClarence Hervey\'s mistress. She touched upon this subject with much\r\ndelicacy, and the answers that she received confirmed her opinion.\r\nVirginia had been inspired by romances with the most exalted notions of\r\nfemale delicacy and honour! but from her perfect ignorance, these were\r\nrather vague ideas than principles of conduct.\r\n\r\n"We shall see Mr. Hervey to-morrow; he has written me word that he will\r\ncome from town, and spend the day with us."\r\n\r\n"I shall be ashamed to see him after what has passed," said Virginia.\r\n\r\n"You have no cause for shame, my dear; Mr. Hervey will try to discover\r\nthe persons who insulted you, and he will punish them. They will never\r\nreturn here; you need not fear that. He is willing and able to protect\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Yes of that I am sure. But what did that strange man mean, when he\r\nsaid--"\r\n\r\n"What, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"That, perhaps, Mr. Hervey would marry me."\r\n\r\nVirginia pronounced these words with difficulty. Mrs. Ormond was silent,\r\nfor she was much embarrassed. Virginia having conquered her first\r\ndifficulty, seemed resolute to obtain an answer.\r\n\r\n"You do not speak to me! Will you not tell me, dear Mrs. Ormond," said\r\nshe, hanging upon her fondly, "what did he mean?"\r\n\r\n"What he said, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"But he said, that if I behaved well, I might get Mr. Hervey to marry\r\nme. What did he mean by that?" said Virginia, in an accent of offended\r\npride.\r\n\r\n"He spoke very rudely and improperly; but it is not worth while to think\r\nof what he said, or what he meant."\r\n\r\n"But, dear Mrs. Ormond, do not go away from me now: I never so much\r\nwished to speak to you in my whole life, and you turn away from me."\r\n\r\n"Well, my love, well, what would you say?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me one thing, only one thing, and you will set my heart at ease.\r\nDoes Mr. Hervey _wish_ me to be his wife?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you that, my dearest Virginia. Time will show us. Perhaps\r\nhis heart has not yet decided."\r\n\r\n"I wish it would decide," said Virginia, sighing deeply; "and I wish\r\nthat strange man had not told me any thing about the matter; it has made\r\nme very unhappy."\r\n\r\nShe covered her eyes with her hand, but the tears trickled between her\r\nfingers, and rolled fast down her arm. Mrs. Ormond, quite overcome by\r\nthe sight of her distress, was no longer able to keep the secret with\r\nwhich she had been entrusted by Clarence Hervey. And after all, thought\r\nshe, Virginia will hear it from himself soon. I shall only spare her\r\nsome unnecessary pain; it is cruel to see her thus, and to keep her in\r\nsuspense. Besides, her weakness might be her ruin, in his opinion, if it\r\nwere to extinguish all her energy, and deprive her of the very power of\r\npleasing. How wan she looks, and how heavy are those sleepless eyes!\r\nShe is not, indeed, in a condition to meet him, when he comes to us\r\nto-morrow: if she had some hopes, she would revive and appear with her\r\nnatural ease and grace.\r\n\r\n"My sweet child," said Mrs. Ormond, "I cannot bear to see you so\r\nmelancholy; consider, Mr. Hervey will be with us to-morrow, and it will\r\ngive him a great deal of pain to see you so."\r\n\r\n"Will it? Then I will try to be very gay."\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond was so delighted to see Virginia smile, that she could not\r\nforbear adding, "The strange man was not wrong in every thing he said;\r\nyou _will_, one of these days, be Mr. Hervey\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"That, I am sure," said Virginia, bursting again into tears, "that, I am\r\nsure, I do not wish, unless _he_ does."\r\n\r\n"He does, he does, my dear--do not let this delicacy of yours, which has\r\nbeen wound up too high, make you miserable. He thought of you, he loved\r\nyou long and long ago."\r\n\r\n"He is very good, too good," said Virginia, sobbing.\r\n\r\n"Nay, what is more--for I can keep nothing from you--he has been\r\neducating you all this time on purpose for his wife, and he only waits\r\ntill your education is finished, and till he is sure that you feel no\r\nrepugnance for him."\r\n\r\n"I should be very ungrateful if I felt any repugnance for him," said\r\nVirginia; "I feel none."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that you need not assure me," said Mrs. Ormond.\r\n\r\n"But I do not wish to marry him--I do not wish to marry."\r\n\r\n"You are a modest girl to say so; and this modesty will make you ten\r\ntimes more amiable, especially in Mr. Hervey\'s eyes. Heaven forbid that\r\nI should lessen it!"\r\n\r\nThe next morning Virginia, who always slept in the same room with Mrs.\r\nOrmond, wakened her, by crying out in her sleep, with a voice of terror,\r\n"Oh, save him!--save Mr. Hervey!--Mr. Hervey!--forgive me! forgive me!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond drew back the curtain, and saw Virginia lying fast asleep;\r\nher beautiful face convulsed with agony.\r\n\r\n"He\'s dead!--Mr. Hervey!" cried she, in a voice of exquisite distress:\r\nthen starting up, and stretching out her arms, she uttered a piercing\r\ncry, and awoke.\r\n\r\n"My love, you have been dreaming frightfully," said Mrs. Ormond.\r\n\r\n"Is it all a dream?" cried Virginia, looking round fearfully.\r\n\r\n"All a dream, my dear!" said Mrs. Ormond, taking her hand.\r\n\r\n"I am very, very glad of it!--Let me breathe. It was, indeed, a\r\nfrightful dream!"\r\n\r\n"Your hand still trembles," said Mrs. Ormond; "let me put back this hair\r\nfrom your poor face, and you will grow cool, and forget this foolish\r\ndream."\r\n\r\n"No; I must tell it you. I ought to tell it you. But it was all so\r\nconfused, I can recollect only some parts of it. First, I remember that\r\nI thought I was not myself, but the Virginia that we were reading of the\r\nother night; and I was somewhere in the Isle of France. I thought the\r\nplace was something like the forest where my grandmother\'s cottage used\r\nto be, only there were high mountains and rocks, and cocoa-trees and\r\nplantains."\r\n\r\n"Such as you saw in the prints of that book?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; only beautiful, beautiful beyond description! And it was\r\nmoonlight, brighter and clearer than any moonlight I ever before had\r\nseen; and the air was fresh yet perfumed; and I was seated under the\r\nshade of a plane-tree, beside Virginia\'s fountain."\r\n\r\n"Just as you are in your picture?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: but Paul was seated beside me."\r\n\r\n"Paul!" said Mrs. Ormond, smiling: "that is Mr. Hervey."\r\n\r\n"No; not Mr. Hervey\'s face, though it spoke with his voice--this is what\r\nI thought that I must tell you. It was another figure: it seemed a\r\nreal living person: it knelt at my feet, and spoke to me so kindly, so\r\ntenderly; and just as it was going to kiss my hand, Mr. Hervey appeared,\r\nand I started terribly, for I was afraid he would be displeased, and\r\nthat he would think me _ungrateful_; and he was displeased, and he\r\ncalled me ungrateful Virginia, and frowned, and then I gave him my hand,\r\nand then every thing changed, I do not know how suddenly, and I was in a\r\nplace like the great print of the cathedral, which Mr. Hervey showed me;\r\nand there were crowds of people--I was almost stifled. _You_ pulled me\r\non, as I remember; and Mr. Moreton was there, standing upon some steps\r\nby what you called the altar; and then we knelt down before him, and Mr.\r\nHervey was putting a ring on my finger; but there came suddenly from the\r\ncrowd that strange man, who was here the other day, and he dragged me\r\nalong with him, I don\'t know how or where, swiftly down precipices,\r\nwhilst I struggled, and at last fell. Then all changed again, and I\r\nwas in a magnificent field, covered with cloth of gold, and there\r\nwere beautiful ladies seated under canopies; and I thought it was a\r\ntournament, such as I have read of, only more splendid; and two knights,\r\nclad in complete armour, and mounted on fiery steeds, were engaged\r\nin single combat; and they fought furiously, and I thought they were\r\nfighting for me. One of the knights wore black plumes in his helmet, and\r\nthe other white; and, as he was passing by me, the vizor of the knight\r\nof the white plumes was raised, and I saw it was--"\r\n\r\n"Clarence Hervey?" said Mrs. Ormond.\r\n\r\n"No; still the same figure that knelt to me; and I wished him to be\r\nvictorious. And he was victorious. And he unhorsed his adversary, and\r\nstood over him with his drawn sword; and then I saw that the knight in\r\nthe black plumes was Mr. Hervey, and I ran to save him, but I could\r\nnot. I saw him weltering in his blood, and I heard him say, \'Perfidious,\r\n_ungrateful_ Virginia! you are the cause of my death!\'--and I screamed,\r\nI believe, and that awakened me."\r\n\r\n"Well, it is only a dream, my love," said Mrs. Ormond; "Mr. Hervey is\r\nsafe: get up and dress yourself, and you will soon see him."\r\n\r\n"But was it not wrong and _ungrateful_ to wish that the knight in the\r\nwhite plumes should be victorious?"\r\n\r\n"Your poor little head is full of nothing but these romances, and love\r\nfor Mr. Hervey. It is your love for him that makes you fear that he will\r\nbe jealous. But he is not so simple as you are. He will forgive you\r\nfor wishing that the knight in the white plumes should be victorious,\r\nespecially as you did not know that the other knight was Mr. Hervey.\r\nCome, my love, dress yourself, and think no more of these foolish\r\ndreams, and all will go well."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nA DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of the open, childish, affectionate familiarity with which\r\nVirginia used to meet Clarence Hervey, she now received him with\r\nreserved, timid embarrassment. Struck by this change in her manner,\r\nand alarmed by the dejection of her spirits, which she vainly strove to\r\nconceal, he eagerly inquired, from Mrs. Ormond, into the cause of this\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond\'s answers, and her account of all that had passed during his\r\nabsence, increased his anxiety. His indignation was roused by the insult\r\nwhich Virginia had been offered by the strangers who had scaled the\r\ngarden-wall. All his endeavours to discover who they were proved\r\nineffectual; but, lest they should venture to repeat their visit, he\r\nremoved her from Windsor, and took her directly to Twickenham. Here\r\nhe stayed with her and Mrs. Ormond some days, to determine, by his own\r\nobservation, how far the representations that had been made to him were\r\njust. Till this period he had been persuaded that Virginia\'s regard for\r\nhim was rather that of gratitude than of love; and with this opinion,\r\nhe thought that he had no reason seriously to reproach himself for the\r\nimprudence with which he had betrayed the partiality that he felt for\r\nher in the beginning of their acquaintance. He flattered himself that\r\neven should she have discerned his intentions, her heart would not\r\nrepine at any alteration in his sentiments; and if her happiness were\r\nuninjured, his reason told him that he was not in honour bound to\r\nconstancy. The case was now altered. Unwilling as he was to believe, he\r\ncould no longer doubt. Virginia could neither meet his eyes nor speak to\r\nhim without a degree of embarrassment which she had not sufficient art\r\nto conceal: she trembled whenever he came near her, and if he looked\r\ngrave, or forbore to take notice of her, she would burst into tears.\r\nAt other times, contrary to the natural indolence of her character, she\r\nwould exert herself to please him with surprising energy: she learned\r\nevery thing that he wished; her capacity seemed suddenly to unfold. For\r\nan instant, Clarence flattered himself that both her fits of melancholy\r\nand of exertion might arise from a secret desire to see something of\r\nthat world from which she had been secluded. One day he touched upon\r\nthis subject, to see what effect it would produce; but, contrary to his\r\nexpectations, she seemed to have no desire to quit her retirement: she\r\ndid not wish, she said, for amusements such as he described; she did not\r\nwish to go into the world.\r\n\r\nIt was during the time of his passion for her that Clarence had her\r\npicture painted in the character of St. Pierre\'s Virginia. It happened\r\nto be in the room in which they were now conversing, and when she spoke\r\nof loving a life of retirement, Clarence accidentally cast his eyes upon\r\nthe picture, and then upon Virginia. She turned away--sighed deeply; and\r\nwhen, in a tone of kindness, he asked her if she were unhappy, she hid\r\nher face in her hands, and made no answer.\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey could not be insensible to her distress or to her delicacy.\r\nHe saw her bloom fading daily, her spirits depressed, her existence a\r\nburden to her, and he feared that his own imprudence had been the cause\r\nof all this misery.\r\n\r\n"I have taken her out of a situation in which she might have spent her\r\nlife usefully and happily; I have excited false hopes in her mind, and\r\nnow she is a wretched and useless being. I have won her affections; her\r\nhappiness depends totally upon me; and can I forsake her? Mrs. Ormond\r\nsays, that she is convinced Virginia would not survive the day of my\r\nmarriage with another. I am not disposed to believe that girls often\r\ndie or destroy themselves for love; nor am I a coxcomb enough to suppose\r\nthat love for me must be extraordinarily desperate. But here\'s a girl,\r\nwho is of a melancholy temperament, who has a great deal of natural\r\nsensibility, whose affections have all been concentrated, who has lived\r\nin solitude, whose imagination has dwelt, for a length of time, upon a\r\ncertain set of ideas, who has but one object of hope; in such a mind,\r\nand in such circumstances, passion may rise to a paroxysm of despair."\r\n\r\nPity, generosity, and honour, made him resolve not to abandon this\r\nunfortunate girl; though he felt that every time he saw Virginia, his\r\nlove for Belinda increased. It was this struggle in his mind betwixt\r\nlove and honour which produced all the apparent inconsistency and\r\nirresolution that puzzled Lady Delacour and perplexed Belinda. The\r\nlock of beautiful hair, which so unluckily fell at Belinda\'s feet, was\r\nVirginia\'s; he was going to take it to the painter, who had made the\r\nhair in her picture considerably too dark. How this picture got into the\r\nexhibition must now be explained.\r\n\r\nWhilst Mr. Hervey\'s mind was in that painful state of doubt which has\r\njust been described, a circumstance happened that promised him some\r\nrelief from his embarrassment. Mr. Moreton, the clergyman who used to\r\nread prayers every Sunday for Mrs. Ormond and Virginia, did not come one\r\nSunday at the usual time: the next morning he called on Mr. Hervey, with\r\na face that showed he had something of importance to communicate.\r\n\r\n"I have hopes, my dear Clarence," said he, "that I have found out your\r\nVirginia\'s father. Yesterday, a musical friend of mine persuaded me\r\nto go with him to hear the singing at the Asylum for children in\r\nSt. George\'s Fields. There is a girl there who has indeed a charming\r\nvoice--but that\'s not to the present purpose. After church was over,\r\nI happened to be one of the last that stayed; for I am too old to love\r\nbustling through a crowd. Perhaps, as you are impatient, you think\r\nthat\'s nothing to the purpose; and yet it is, as you shall hear.\r\nWhen the congregation had almost left the church, I observed that the\r\nchildren of the Asylum remained in their places, by order of one of\r\nthe governors; and a middle-aged gentleman went round amongst the elder\r\ngirls, examined their countenances with care, and inquired with much\r\nanxiety their ages, and every particular relative to their parents. The\r\nstranger held a miniature picture in his hand, with which he compared\r\neach face. I was not near enough to him," continued Mr. Moreton, "to see\r\nthe miniature distinctly: but from the glimpse I caught of it, I thought\r\nthat it was like your Virginia, though it seemed to be the portrait of a\r\nchild but four or five years old. I understand that this gentleman will\r\nbe at the Asylum again next Sunday; I heard him express a wish to see\r\nsome of the girls who happened last Sunday to be absent."\r\n\r\n"Do you know this gentleman\'s name, or where he lives?" said Clarence.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing of him," replied Mr. Moreton, "except that he seems fond\r\nof painting; for he told one of the directors, who was looking at his\r\nminiature, that it was remarkably well painted, and that, in his happier\r\ndays, he had been something of a judge of the art."\r\n\r\nImpatient to see the stranger, who, he did not doubt, was Virginia\'s\r\nfather, Clarence Hervey went the next Sunday to the Asylum; but no such\r\ngentleman appeared, and all that he could learn respecting him was, that\r\nhe had applied to one of the directors of the institution for leave to\r\nsee and question the girls, in hopes of finding amongst them his lost\r\ndaughter; that in the course of the week, he had seen all those who were\r\nnot at the church the last Sunday. None of the directors knew any thing\r\nmore concerning him; but the porter remarked, that he came in a very\r\nhandsome coach, and one of the girls of the Asylum said that he gave her\r\nhalf a guinea, because she was a little like _his poor Rachel, who was\r\ndead_; but that he had added, with a sigh, "This cannot be my daughter,\r\nfor she is only thirteen, and my girl, if she be now living, must be\r\nnearly eighteen."\r\n\r\nThe age, the name, every circumstance confirmed Mr. Hervey in the belief\r\nthat this stranger was the father of Virginia, and he was disappointed\r\nand provoked by having missed the opportunity of seeing or speaking to\r\nhim. It occurred to Clarence that the gentleman might probably visit the\r\nFoundling Hospital, and thither he immediately went, to make inquiries.\r\nHe was told that a person, such as he described, had been there about\r\na month before, and had compared the face of the oldest girls with a\r\nlittle picture of a child: that he gave money to several of the girls,\r\nbut that they did not know his name, or any thing more about him.\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey now inserted proper advertisements in all the papers, but\r\nwithout producing any effect. At last, recollecting what Mr. Moreton\r\ntold him of the stranger\'s love of pictures, he determined to put his\r\nportrait of Virginia into the exhibition, in hopes that the gentleman\r\nmight go there and ask some questions about it, which might lead to a\r\ndiscovery. The young artist, who had painted this picture, was under\r\nparticular obligations to Clarence, and he promised that he would\r\nfaithfully comply with his request, to be at Somerset-house regularly\r\nevery morning, as soon as the exhibition opened; that he would stay\r\nthere till it closed, and watch whether any of the spectators were\r\nparticularly struck with the portrait of Virginia. If any person should\r\nask questions respecting the picture, he was to let Mr. Hervey know\r\nimmediately, and to give the inquirer his address.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that the very day when Lady Delacour and Belinda were at\r\nthe exhibition, the painter called Clarence aside, and informed him that\r\na gentleman had just inquired from him very eagerly, whether the picture\r\nof Virginia was a portrait. This gentleman proved to be not the stranger\r\nwho had been at the Asylum, but an eminent jeweller, who told Mr. Hervey\r\nthat his curiosity about the picture arose merely from its striking\r\nlikeness to a miniature, which had been lately left at his house to\r\nbe new set. It belonged to a Mr. Hartley, a gentleman who had made a\r\nconsiderable fortune in the West Indies, but who was prevented from\r\nenjoying his affluence by the loss of an only daughter, of whom the\r\nminiature was a portrait, taken when she was not more than four or five\r\nyears old. When Clarence heard all this, he was extremely impatient to\r\nknow where Mr. Hartley was to be found; but the jeweller could only\r\ntell him that the miniature had been called for the preceding day by Mr.\r\nHartley\'s servant, who said his master was leaving town in a great hurry\r\nto go to Portsmouth, to join the West India fleet, which was to sail\r\nwith the first favourable wind.\r\n\r\nClarence determined immediately to follow him to Portsmouth: he had not\r\na moment to spare, for the wind was actually favourable, and his only\r\nchance of seeing Mr. Hartley was by reaching Portsmouth as soon as\r\npossible. This was the cause of his taking leave of Belinda in such\r\nan abrupt manner: painful indeed were his feelings at that moment, and\r\ngreat the difficulty he felt in parting with her, without giving any\r\nexplanation of his conduct, which must have appeared to her capricious\r\nand mysterious. He was aware that he had explicitly avowed to Lady\r\nDelacour his admiration of Miss Portman, and that in a thousand\r\ninstances he had betrayed his passion. Yet of her love he dared not\r\ntrust himself to think, whilst his affairs were in this doubtful\r\nstate. He had, it is true, some faint hopes that a change in Virginia\'s\r\nsituation might produce an alteration in her sentiments, and he resolved\r\nto decide his own conduct by the manner in which she should behave,\r\nif her father should be found, and she should become heiress to a\r\nconsiderable fortune. New views might then open to her imagination: the\r\nworld, the fashionable world, in all its glory, would be before her;\r\nher beauty and fortune would attract a variety of admirers, and Clarence\r\nthought that perhaps her partiality for him might become less exclusive,\r\nwhen she had more opportunities of choice. If her love arose merely from\r\ncircumstances, with circumstances it would change; if it were only a\r\ndisease of the imagination, induced by her seclusion from society,\r\nit might be cured by mixing with the world; and then he should be\r\nat liberty to follow the dictates of his own heart, and declare his\r\nattachment to Belinda. But if he should find that change of situation\r\nmade no alteration in Virginia\'s sentiments, if her happiness should\r\nabsolutely depend upon the realization of those hopes which he had\r\nimprudently excited, he felt that he should be bound to her by all the\r\nlaws of justice and honour; laws which no passion could tempt him to\r\nbreak. Full of these ideas, he hurried to Portsmouth in pursuit of\r\nVirginia\'s father. The first question he asked, upon his arrival there,\r\nmay easily be guessed.\r\n\r\n"Has the West India fleet sailed?"\r\n\r\n"No: it sails to-morrow morning," was the answer.\r\n\r\nHe hastened instantly to make inquiries for Mr. Hartley. No such\r\nperson could be found, no such gentleman was to be heard of any where.\r\n_Hartley_, he was sure, was the name which the jeweller mentioned to\r\nhim, but it was in vain that he repeated it; no Mr. Hartley was to be\r\nheard of at Portsmouth, except a pawnbroker. At last, a steward of one\r\nof the West Indiamen recollected that a gentleman of that name came over\r\nwith him in the Effingham, and that he talked of returning in the same\r\nvessel to the West Indies, if he should ever leave England again.\r\n\r\n"But we have heard nothing of him since, sir," said the steward. "No\r\npassage is taken for him with us."\r\n\r\n"And my life to a china orange," cried a sailor who was standing by,\r\n"he\'s gone to kingdom come, or more likely to Bedlam, afore this; for\r\nhe was plaguy crazy in his timbers, and his head wanted righting, I take\r\nit, if it was he, Jack, who used to walk the deck, you know, with a bit\r\nof a picture in his hand, to which he seemed to be mumbling his prayers\r\nfrom morning to night. There\'s no use in sounding for him, master;\r\nhe\'s down in Davy\'s locker long ago, or stowed into the tight waistcoat\r\nbefore this time o\'day."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this knowing sailor\'s opinion, Clarence would not desist\r\nfrom his sounding; because having so lately heard of him at different\r\nplaces, he could not believe that he was gone either into Davy\'s locker\r\nor to Bedlam. He imagined that, by some accident, Mr. Hartley had been\r\ndetained upon the road to Portsmouth; and in the expectation that he\r\nwould certainly arrive before the fleet should sail, Clarence waited\r\nwith tolerable patience. He waited, however, in vain; he saw the\r\nEffingham and the whole fleet sail--no Mr. Hartley arrived. As he\r\nhailed one of the boats of the Effingham, which was rowing out with some\r\npassengers, who had been too late to get on board, his friend the sailor\r\nanswered, "We\'ve no crazy man here: I told you, master, he\'d never go\r\nout no more in the Effingham. He\'s where I said, master, you\'ll find, or\r\nnowhere."\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey remained some days at Portsmouth, after the fleet had sailed,\r\nin hopes that he might yet obtain some information; but none could be\r\nhad; neither could any farther tidings be obtained from the jeweller,\r\nwho had first mentioned Mr. Hartley. Despairing of success in the object\r\nof his journey, he, however, determined to delay his return to town for\r\nsome time, in hopes that absence might efface the impression which had\r\nbeen made on the heart of Virginia. He made a tour along the picturesque\r\ncoasts of Dorset and Devonshire, and it was during this excursion\r\nthat he wrote the letters to Lady Delacour which have so often been\r\nmentioned. He endeavoured to dissipate his thoughts by new scenes and\r\nemployments, but all his ideas involuntarily centred in Belinda. If he\r\nsaw new characters, he compared them with hers, or considered how far\r\nshe would approve or condemn them. The books that he read were perused\r\nwith a constant reference to what she would think or feel; and during\r\nhis whole journey he never beheld any beautiful prospect, without\r\nwishing that it could at the same instant be seen by Belinda. If her\r\nname were mentioned but once in his letters, it was because he dared not\r\ntrust himself to speak of her; she was for ever present to his mind: but\r\nwhile he was writing to Lady Delacour, her idea pressed more strongly\r\nupon his heart; he recollected that it was she who first gave him a just\r\ninsight into her ladyship\'s real character; he recollected that she\r\nhad joined with him in the benevolent design of reconciling her to Lord\r\nDelacour, and of creating in her mind a taste for domestic happiness.\r\nThis remembrance operated powerfully to excite him to fresh exertions,\r\nand the eloquence which touched Lady Delacour so much in these\r\n"_edifying_" letters, as she called them, was in fact inspired by\r\nBelinda.\r\n\r\nWhenever he thought distinctly upon his future plans, Virginia\'s\r\nattachment, and the hopes which he had imprudently inspired, appeared\r\ninsuperable obstacles to his union with Miss Portman; but, in more\r\nsanguine moments, he flattered himself with a confused notion that these\r\ndifficulties would vanish. Great were his surprise and alarm when he\r\nreceived that letter of Lady Delacour\'s, in which she announced the\r\nprobability of Belinda\'s marriage with Mr. Vincent. In consequence of\r\nhis moving from place to place in the course of his tour, he did not\r\nreceive this letter till nearly a fortnight after it should have come\r\nto his hands. The instant he received it he set out on his way home; he\r\ntravelled with all that expedition which money can command in England:\r\nhis first thought and first wish when he arrived in town were to go\r\nto Lady Delacour\'s; but he checked his impatience, and proceeded\r\nimmediately to Twickenham, to have his fate decided by Virginia. It was\r\nwith the most painful sensations that he saw her again. The accounts\r\nwhich he received from Mrs. Ormond convinced him that absence had\r\nproduced none of the effects which he expected on the mind of her pupil.\r\nMrs. Ormond was naturally both of an affectionate disposition and a\r\ntimid temper; she had become excessively fond of Virginia, and her\r\nanxiety was more than in proportion to her love; it sometimes balanced\r\nand even overbalanced her regard and respect for Clarence Hervey\r\nhimself. When he spoke of his attachment to Belinda, and of his doubts\r\nrespecting Virginia, she could no longer restrain her emotion.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed, Mr. Hervey," said she, "this is no time for reasoning and\r\ndoubting. No man in his senses, no man who is not wilfully blind, could\r\ndoubt her being distractedly fond of you."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for it," said Clarence.\r\n\r\n"And why--oh, why, Mr. Hervey? Don\'t you recollect the time when you\r\nwere all impatience to call her yours,--when you thought her the most\r\ncharming creature in the whole world?"\r\n\r\n"I had not seen Belinda Portman then."\r\n\r\n"And I wish to Heaven you never had seen her! But oh, surely, Mr.\r\nHervey, you will not desert my Virginia!--Must her health, her\r\nhappiness, her reputation, all be the sacrifice?"\r\n\r\n"Reputation! Mrs. Ormond."\r\n\r\n"Reputation, Mr. Hervey: you do not know in what a light she is\r\nconsidered here; nor did I till lately. But I tell you her reputation\r\nis injured--fatally injured. It is whispered, and more than whispered\r\neverywhere, that she is your mistress. A woman came here the other\r\nday with the bullfinch, and she looked at me, and spoke in such an\r\nextraordinary way, that I was shocked more than I can express. I\r\nneed not tell you all the particulars; it is enough that I have made\r\ninquiries, and am sure, too sure, of what I say, that nothing but your\r\nmarriage with Virginia can save her reputation; or--"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond stopped short, for at this instant Virginia entered the\r\nroom, walking in her slow manner, as if she were in a deep reverie.\r\n\r\n"Since my return," said Clarence, in an embarrassed voice, "I have\r\nscarcely heard a syllable from Miss St. Pierre\'s lips."\r\n\r\n"_Miss St. Pierre!_--He used to call me Virginia," said she, turning to\r\nMrs. Ormond: "he is angry with me--he used to call me Virginia."\r\n\r\n"But you were a child then, you know, my love," said Mrs. Ormond.\r\n\r\n"And I wish I was still a child," said Virginia, Then, after a long\r\npause, she approached Mr. Hervey with extreme timidity, and, opening\r\na portfolio which lay on the table, she said to him, "If you are at\r\nleisure--if I do not interrupt you--would you look at these drawings;\r\nthough they are not worth your seeing, except as proofs that I can\r\nconquer my natural indolence?"\r\n\r\nThe drawings were views which she had painted from memory, of scenes in\r\nthe New Forest, near her grandmother\'s cottage. That cottage was drawn\r\nwith an exactness that proved how fresh it was in her remembrance. Many\r\nrecollections rushed forcibly into Clarence Hervey\'s mind at the sight\r\nof this cottage. The charming image of Virginia, as it first struck his\r\nfancy,--the smile, the innocent smile, with which she offered him the\r\nfinest rose in her basket,--the stern voice in which her grandmother\r\nspoke to her,--the prophetic fears of her protectress,--the figure of\r\nthe dying woman,--the solemn promise he made to her,--all recurred, in\r\nrapid succession, to his memory.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t seem to like that," said Virginia; and then putting another\r\ndrawing into his hands, "perhaps this may please you better."\r\n\r\n"They are beautiful; they are surprisingly well done!" exclaimed he.\r\n\r\n"I knew he would like them! I told you so!" cried Mrs. Ormond, in a\r\ntriumphant tone.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Virginia, "that though you have heard scarcely a\r\nsyllable from Miss St. Pierre\'s lips since your return, yet she has not\r\nbeen unmindful of your wishes in your absence. You told her, some time\r\nago, that you wished she would try to improve in drawing. She has done\r\nher best. But do not trouble yourself to look at them any longer," said\r\nVirginia, taking one of her drawings from his hand; "I merely wanted to\r\nshow you that, though I have no genius, I have some--"\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered so that she could not pronounce the word _gratitude_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond pronounced it for her; and added, "I can answer for it, that\r\nVirginia is not ungrateful."\r\n\r\n"Ungrateful!" repeated Clarence; "who ever thought her so? Why did you\r\nput these ideas into her mind?"\r\n\r\nVirginia, resting her head on Mrs. Ormond\'s shoulder, wept bitterly.\r\n\r\n"You have worked upon her sensibility till you have made her miserable,"\r\ncried Clarence, angrily. "Virginia, listen to me: look at me," said he,\r\naffectionately taking her hand; but she pressed closer to Mrs. Ormond,\r\nand would not raise her head. "Do not consider me as your master--your\r\ntyrant; do not imagine that I think you ungrateful!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am--I am--I am ungrateful to you," cried she, sobbing; "but Mrs.\r\nOrmond never told me so; do not blame her: she has never worked upon\r\nmy sensibility. Do you think," said she, looking up, while a transient\r\nexpression of indignation passed over her countenance, "do you think I\r\ncannot _feel_ without having been taught?"\r\n\r\nClarence uttered a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n"But if you feel too much, my dearest Virginia,--if you give way to your\r\nfeelings in this manner," said Mrs. Ormond, "you will make both yourself\r\nand Mr. Hervey unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid! The first wish of my soul is--" She paused. "I should be\r\nthe most ungrateful wretch in the world, if I were to make him unhappy."\r\n\r\n"But if he sees you miserable, Virginia?"\r\n\r\n"Then he shall not see it," said she, wiping the tears from her face.\r\n\r\n"To imagine that you were unhappy, and that you concealed it from us,\r\nwould be still worse," said Clarence.\r\n\r\n"But why should you imagine it?" replied Virginia; "you are too good,\r\ntoo kind; but do not fancy that I am not happy: I am sure I ought to be\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\n"Do you regret your cottage?" said Clarence: "these drawings show how\r\nwell you remember it."\r\n\r\nVirginia coloured; and, with some hesitation, answered, "Is it my fault\r\nif I cannot forget?"\r\n\r\n"You were happier then, Virginia, than you are now, you will confess,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Ormond, who was not a woman of refined delicacy, and who\r\nthought that the best chance she had of working upon Mr. Hervey\'s sense\r\nof honour was by making it plain to him how much her pupil\'s affections\r\nwere engaged.\r\n\r\nVirginia made no answer to this question, and her silence touched\r\nClarence more than any thing she could have said. When Mrs. Ormond\r\nrepeated her question, he relieved the trembling girl by saying, "My\r\ndear Mrs. Ormond, confidence must be won, not demanded."\r\n\r\n"I have no right to insist upon confessions, I know," said Mrs. Ormond;\r\n"but--"\r\n\r\n"Confessions! I do not wish to conceal any thing, but I think sincerity\r\nis not _always_ in our sex consistent with--I mean--I don\'t know what I\r\nmean, what I say, or what I ought to say," cried Virginia; and she sunk\r\ndown on a sofa, in extreme confusion.\r\n\r\n"Why will you agitate her, Mrs. Ormond, in this manner?" said Mr.\r\nHervey, with an expression of sudden anger. It was succeeded by a look\r\nof such tender compassion for Virginia, that Mrs. Ormond rejoiced to\r\nhave excited his anger; at any price she wished to serve her beloved\r\npupil.\r\n\r\n"Do not be in the least apprehensive, my dear Virginia, that we should\r\ntake ungenerous advantage of the openness and simplicity of your\r\ncharacter," said Mr. Hervey.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no; I cannot, do not apprehend any thing ungenerous from you;\r\nyou are, you ever have been, my best, my most generous friend! But I\r\nfear that I have not the simplicity of character, the openness that you\r\nimagine; and yet, I am sure, I wish, from the bottom of my heart--I wish\r\nto do right, if I knew how. But there is not one--no, not one--person in\r\nthe whole world," continued she, her eyes moving from Mrs. Ormond to Mr.\r\nHervey, and from him to Mrs. Ormond again, "not one person in the whole\r\nworld I dare--I ought--to lay my heart open to. I have, perhaps, said\r\nmore than is proper already. But this I know," added she, in a firm\r\ntone, rising, and addressing herself to Clarence, "_you_ shall never be\r\nmade unhappy by me. And do not think about my happiness so much," said\r\nshe, forcing a smile; "I am, I will be, perfectly happy. Only let me\r\nalways know your wishes, your sentiments, your feelings, and by them I\r\nwill, as I ought, regulate mine."\r\n\r\n"Amiable, charming, generous girl!" cried Clarence.\r\n\r\n"Take care," said Mrs. Ormond; "take care, Virginia, lest you promise\r\nmore than you can perform. Wishes, and feelings, and sentiments, are not\r\nto be so easily regulated."\r\n\r\n"I did not, I believe, say it was easy; but I hope it is possible,"\r\nreplied Virginia. "I promise nothing but what I am able to perform."\r\n\r\n"I doubt it," said Mrs. Ormond, shaking her head. "You _are_--you _will_\r\nbe perfectly happy. Oh, Virginia, my love, do not deceive yourself; do\r\nnot deceive us so terribly. I am sorry to put you to the blush; but--"\r\n\r\n"Not a word more, my dear madam, I beg--I insist," said Mr. Hervey in a\r\ncommanding tone; but, for the first time in her life, regardless of him,\r\nshe persisted.\r\n\r\n"I only ask you to call to mind, my dearest Virginia," said she, taking\r\nher hand, "the morning that you screamed in your sleep, the morning when\r\nyou told me the frightful dream--were you perfectly happy then?"\r\n\r\n"It is easy to force my thoughts from me," said Virginia, withdrawing\r\nher hand from Mrs. Ormond; "but it is cruel to do so." And with an air\r\nof offended dignity she passed them, and quitted the room.\r\n\r\n"I wish to Heaven!" exclaimed Mrs. Ormond, "that Miss Portman was\r\nmarried, and out of the way--I shall never forgive myself! We have used\r\nthis poor girl cruelly amongst us: she loves you to distraction, and I\r\nhave encouraged her passion, and I have betrayed her--oh, fool that I\r\nwas! I told her that she would certainly be your wife."\r\n\r\n"You have told her so!--Did I not charge you, Mrs. Ormond----"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I could not help it, when I saw the sweet girl fading\r\naway--and, besides, I am sure she thought it, from your manner, long\r\nand long before I told it to her. Do you forget how fond of her you were\r\nscarce one short year ago? And do you forget how plainly you let her see\r\nyour passion? Oh, how can you blame her, if she loves you, and if she is\r\nunhappy?"\r\n\r\n"I blame no one but myself," cried Clarence; "I must abide by the\r\nconsequences of my own folly. Unhappy!--she shall not be unhappy; she\r\ndoes not deserve to be so."\r\n\r\nHe walked backward and forward, with hasty steps, for some minutes; then\r\nsat down and wrote a letter to Virginia.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished it, he put it into Mrs. Ormond\'s hands.\r\n\r\n"Read it--seal it--give it to her--and let her answer be sent to town to\r\nme, at Dr. X.\'s, in Clifford-street."\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond clasped her hands, in an ecstasy of joy, as she glanced her\r\neye over the letter, for it contained an offer of his hand.\r\n\r\n"This is like yourself; like what I always knew you to be, dear Mr.\r\nHervey!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nBut her exclamation was lost upon him. When she looked up, to repeat her\r\npraises, she perceived he was gone. After the effort which he had made,\r\nhe wished for time to tranquillize his mind, before he should again see\r\nVirginia. What her answer to this letter would be he could not doubt:\r\nhis fate was now decided, and he determined immediately to write to Lady\r\nDelacour to explain his situation; he felt that he had not sufficient\r\nfortitude at this moment to make such an explanation in person. With\r\nall the strength of his mind, he endeavoured to exclude Belinda from his\r\nthoughts, but _curiosity_--(for he would suffer himself to call it by no\r\nother name)--curiosity to know whether she were actually engaged to Mr.\r\nVincent obtruded itself with such force, that it could not be resisted.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. X---- he thought he could obtain full information, and he\r\nhastened immediately to town. When he got to Clifford-street, he found\r\nthat the doctor was not at home; his servant said, he might probably be\r\nmet with at Mrs. Margaret Delacour\'s, as he usually finished his morning\r\nrounds at her house. Thither Mr. Hervey immediately went.\r\n\r\nThe first sound that he heard, as he went up her stairs, was the\r\nscreaming of a macaw; and the first person he saw, through the open door\r\nof the drawing-room, was Helena Delacour. She was standing with her back\r\nto him, leaning over the macaw\'s cage, and he heard her say in a joyful\r\ntone, "Yes, though you do scream so frightfully, my pretty macaw, I love\r\nyou as well as Marriott ever did. When my dear, good Miss Portman, sent\r\nthis macaw--My dear aunt! here\'s Mr. Hervey!--you were just wishing to\r\nsee him."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hervey," said the old lady, with a benevolent smile, "your little\r\nfriend Helena tells you truth; we were just wishing for you. I am sure\r\nit will give you pleasure to hear that I am at last a convert to your\r\nopinion of Lady Delacour. She has given up all those that I used to call\r\nher rantipole acquaintance. She has reconciled herself to her husband,\r\nand to his friends; and Helena is to go home to live with her. Here is\r\na charming note I have just received from her! Dine with me on Thursday\r\nnext, and you will meet her ladyship, and see a happy family party.\r\nYou have had some share in the _reformation_, I know, and that was the\r\nreason I wished that you should be with us on Thursday. You see I am not\r\nan obstinate old woman, though I was cross the first day I saw you at\r\nLady Anne Percival\'s. I found I was mistaken in your character, and I\r\nam glad of it. But this note of Lady Delacour\'s seems to have struck you\r\ndumb."\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, a few words in this note, which deprived him, for\r\nsome moments, of all power of utterance.\r\n\r\n"The report you have heard (unlike most other reports) is perfectly well\r\nfounded: Mr. Vincent, Belinda\'s admirer, is here. I will bring him with\r\nus on Thursday."\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey was relieved from the necessity of accounting to Mrs.\r\nDelacour for his sudden embarrassment, by the entrance of Dr. X---- and\r\nanother gentleman, of whom, in the confusion of his mind, Clarence\r\ndid not at first take any notice. Dr. X----, with his usual mixture\r\nof benevolence and raillery, addressed himself to Clarence, whilst the\r\nstranger took out of his pocket some papers, and in a low voice entered\r\nearnestly into conversation with Mrs. Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Now, tell me, if you can, Clarence," said Dr. X----, "which of your\r\nthree mistresses you like best? I think I left you some months ago in\r\ngreat doubt upon this subject: are you still in that philosophic state?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Clarence; "all doubts are over--I am going to be married."\r\n\r\n"Bravo!--But you look as if you were going to be hanged. May I, as it\r\nwill so soon be in the newspaper, may I ask the name of the fair lady?"\r\n\r\n"Virginia St. Pierre. You shall know her history and mine when we are\r\nalone," said Mr. Hervey, lowering his voice.\r\n\r\n"You need not lower your voice," said Dr. X----, "for Mrs. Delacour\r\nis, as you see, so much taken up with her own affairs, that she has no\r\ncuriosity for those of her neighbours; and Mr. Hartley is as busy as--"\r\n\r\n"Mr. who? Mr. Hartley did you say?" interrupted Clarence, eagerly\r\nturning his eyes upon the stranger, who was a middle-aged gentleman,\r\nexactly answering the description of the person who had been at the\r\nAsylum in search of his daughter.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hartley! yes. What astonishes you so much?" said X----, calmly. "He\r\nis a West Indian. I met him in Cambridgeshire last summer, at his friend\r\nMr. Horton\'s; he has been very generous to the poor people who suffered\r\nby the fire, and he is now consulting with Mrs. Delacour, who has an\r\nestate adjoining to Mr. Horton\'s, about her tenants, whose houses in\r\nthe village were burnt. Now I have, in as few words and parentheses\r\nas possible, told you all I know of Mr. Hartley\'s history; but your\r\ncuriosity still looks voracious."\r\n\r\n"I want to know whether he has a miniature?" said Clarence, hastily.\r\n"Introduce me to him, for Heaven\'s sake, directly!"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hartley," cried the doctor, raising his voice, "give me leave to\r\nintroduce my friend Mr. Hervey to you, and to your miniature picture, if\r\nyou have one."\r\n\r\nMr. Hartley sighed profoundly as he drew from his bosom a small\r\nportrait, which he put into Mr. Hervey\'s hands, saying, "Alas! sir, you\r\ncannot, I fear, give me any tidings of the original; it is the picture\r\nof a daughter, whom I have never seen since she was an infant--whom I\r\nnever shall see again."\r\n\r\nClarence instantly knew it to be Virginia; but as he was upon the point\r\nof making some joyful exclamation, he felt Dr. X---- touch his shoulder,\r\nand looking up at Mr. Hartley, he saw in his countenance such strong\r\nworkings of passion, that he prudently suppressed his own emotion, and\r\ncalmly said, "It would be cruel, sir, to give you false hopes."\r\n\r\n"It would kill me--it would kill me, sir!--or worse!--worse! a thousand\r\ntimes worse!" cried Mr. Hartley, putting his hand to his forehead.\r\n"What," continued he impatiently, "what was the meaning of the look you\r\ngave, when you first saw that picture? Speak, if you have any humanity!\r\nDid you ever see any one that resembles that picture?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen, I think, a picture," said Clarence Hervey, "that has some\r\nresemblance to it."\r\n\r\n"When? where?--"\r\n\r\n"My good sir," said Dr. X----, "let me recommend it to you to consider\r\nthat there is scarcely any possibility of judging, from the features of\r\nchildren, of what their faces may be when they grow up. Nothing can be\r\nmore fallacious than these accidental resemblances between the pictures\r\nof children and of grown-up people."\r\n\r\nMr. Hartley\'s countenance fell.\r\n\r\n"But," added Clarence Hervey, "you will perhaps, sir, think it worth\r\nyour while to see the picture of which I speak: you can see it at Mr.\r\nF----\'s, the painter, in Newman-street; and I will accompany you thither\r\nwhenever you please."\r\n\r\n"This moment, if you would have the goodness: my carriage is at the\r\ndoor; and Mrs. Delacour will be so kind to excuse ----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, make no apologies to me at such a time as this," said Mrs.\r\nDelacour. "Away with you, gentlemen, as soon as you please; upon\r\ncondition, that if you have any good news to tell, some of you will\r\nremember, in the midst of your joy, that such an old woman as Mrs.\r\nMargaret Delacour exists, who loves to hear _good_ news of those who\r\ndeserve it."\r\n\r\n"It was so late in the day when they got to Newman-street, that they\r\nwere obliged to light candles. Trembling with eagerness, Mr. Hartley\r\ndrew near, while Clarence held the light to the picture.\r\n\r\n"It is so like," said he, looking at his miniature, "that I dare not\r\nbelieve my senses. Dr. X----, pray do you look. My head is so dizzy, and\r\nmy eyes so----What do you think, sir? What do you say, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"That the likeness is certainly striking--but this seems to be a fancy\r\npiece."\r\n\r\n"A fancy piece," repeated Mr. Hartley, with terror: "why then did you\r\nbring me here?--A fancy piece!"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; it is a portrait," said Clarence; "and if you will be calm, I\r\nwill tell you more."\r\n\r\n"I will be calm--only is she alive?"\r\n\r\n"The lady, of whom this is the portrait, is alive," replied Clarence\r\nHervey, who was obliged to exert his utmost command over himself, to\r\nmaintain that composure which he saw was necessary; "the lady, of whom\r\nthis is the portrait, is alive, and you shall see her to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, why not now? Cannot I see her now? I must see her to-night--this\r\ninstant, sir!"\r\n\r\n"It is impossible," said Mr. Hervey, "that you should see her this\r\ninstant, for she is some miles off, at Twickenham."\r\n\r\n"It is too late to go thither now; you cannot think of it, Mr. Hartley,"\r\ncontinued Dr. X----, in a tone of command, to which he yielded more\r\nreadily than to reason.\r\n\r\nClarence had the presence of mind to recollect that it would be\r\nnecessary to prepare poor Virginia for this meeting, and he sent a\r\nmessenger immediately to request that Mrs. Ormond would communicate the\r\nintelligence with all the caution in her power.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Mr. Hartley and Mr. Hervey set off together for\r\nTwickenham. In their way thither Clarence gradually confirmed Mr.\r\nHartley in the belief that Virginia was his daughter, by relating all\r\nthe circumstances that he had learned from her grandmother, and\r\nfrom Mrs. Smith, the farmer\'s wife, with whom she had formerly been\r\nacquainted: the name, the age, every particular, as it was disclosed,\r\nheightened his security and his joy.\r\n\r\nFor some time Mr. Hartley\'s mind was so intent that he could not listen\r\nto any thing, but at last Clarence engaged his attention and suspended\r\nhis anxiety, by giving him a history of his own connexion with Virginia,\r\nfrom the day of his first discovering her in the New Forest, to the\r\nletter which he had just written, to offer her his hand. The partiality\r\nwhich it was suspected Virginia felt for him was the only circumstance\r\nwhich he suppressed, because, notwithstanding all Mrs. Ormond had\r\nsaid, and all he had himself heard and seen, his obstinate incredulity\r\nrequired confirmation under her own hand, or positively from her own\r\nlips. He still fancied it was possible that change of situation might\r\nalter her views and sentiments; and he earnestly entreated that she\r\nmight be left entirely to her own decision. It was necessary to make\r\nthis stipulation with her father; for in the excess of his gratitude\r\nfor the kindness which Clarence had shown to her, he protested that he\r\nshould look upon her as a monster if she did not love him: he added,\r\nthat if Mr. Hervey had not a farthing, he should prefer him to every man\r\nupon earth; he, however, promised that he would conceal his wishes, and\r\nthat his daughter should act entirely from the dictates of her own mind.\r\nIn the fulness of his heart, he told Clarence all those circumstances\r\nof his conduct towards Virginia\'s mother which had filled his soul\r\nwith remorse. She was scarcely sixteen when he ran away with her from\r\na boarding-school; he was at that time a gay officer, she a sentimental\r\ngirl, who had been spoiled by early novel-reading. Her father had a\r\nsmall place at court, lived beyond his fortune, educated his daughter,\r\nto whom he could give no portion, as if she were to be heiress to a\r\nlarge estate; then died, and left his widow absolutely in penury. This\r\nwidow was the old lady who lived in the cottage in the New Forest. It\r\nwas just at the time of her husband\'s death, and of her own distress,\r\nthat she heard of the elopement of her daughter from school. Mr.\r\nHartley\'s parents were so much incensed by the match, that he was\r\nprevailed upon to separate from his wife, and to go abroad, to push\r\nhis fortune in the army. His marriage had been secret: his own friends\r\ndisavowed it, notwithstanding the repeated, urgent entreaties of his\r\nwife and of her mother, who was her only surviving relation. His wife,\r\non her death-bed, wrote to urge him to take charge of his daughter; and,\r\nto make the appeal stronger to his feelings, she sent him a picture\r\nof his little girl, who was then about four years old. Mr. Hartley,\r\nhowever, was intent upon forming a new connexion with the rich widow\r\nof a planter in Jamaica. He married the widow, took possession of her\r\nfortune, and all his affections soon were fixed upon a son, for whom\r\nhe formed, even from the moment of his birth, various schemes of\r\naggrandizement. The boy lived till he was about ten years old, when he\r\ncaught a fever, which at that time raged in Jamaica, and, after a few\r\ndays\' illness, died. His mother was carried off by the same disease;\r\nand Mr. Hartley, left alone in the midst of his wealth, felt how\r\ninsufficient it was to happiness. Remorse now seized him; he returned to\r\nEngland in search of his deserted daughter. To this neglected child he\r\nnow looked forward for the peace and happiness of the remainder of his\r\nlife. Disappointment in all his inquiries for some months preyed\r\nupon his spirits to such a degree, that his intellects were at times\r\ndisordered; this derangement was the cause of his not sooner recovering\r\nhis child. He was in confinement during the time that Clarence Hervey\'s\r\nadvertisements were inserted in the papers; and his illness was also the\r\ncause of his not going to Portsmouth, and sailing in the Effingham, as\r\nhe had originally intended. The history of his connexion with Mr. Horton\r\nwould be uninteresting to the reader; it is enough to say, that he was\r\nprevailed upon, by that gentleman, to spend some time in the country\r\nwith him, for the recovery of his health; and it was there that he\r\nbecame acquainted with Dr. X----, who introduced him, as we have seen,\r\nto Mrs. Margaret Delacour, at whose house he met Clarence Hervey. This\r\nis the most succinct account that we can give of him and his affairs.\r\nHis own account was ten times as long; but we spare our readers his\r\nincoherences and reflections, because, perhaps, they are in a hurry to\r\nget to Twickenham, and to hear of his meeting with Virginia.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ormond found it no easy task to prepare Virginia for the sight of\r\nMr. Hartley. Virginia had scarcely ever spoken of her father; but the\r\nremembrance of things which she had heard of him from her grandmother\r\nwas fresh in her mind; she had often pictured him in her fancy, and\r\nshe had secretly nourished the hope that she should not for ever be a\r\n_deserted child_. Mrs. Ormond had observed, that in those romances, of\r\nwhich she was so fond, every thing that related to children who were\r\ndeserted by their parents affected her strongly.\r\n\r\nThe belief in what the French call _la force du sang_ was suited to\r\nher affectionate temper and ardent imagination, and it had taken full\r\npossession of her mind. The eloquence of romance persuaded her that\r\nshe should not only discover but love her father with intuitive filial\r\npiety, and she longed to experience those yearnings of affection of\r\nwhich she had read so much.\r\n\r\nThe first moment that Mrs. Ormond began to speak of Mr. Clarence\r\nHervey\'s hopes of discovering her father, she was transported with joy.\r\n\r\n"My _father_!--How delightful that word _father_ sounds!--_My_\r\nfather?--May I say _my_ father?--And will he own me, and will he love\r\nme, and will he give me his blessing, and will he fold me in his arms,\r\nand call me his daughter, his dear daughter?--Oh, how I shall love him!\r\nI will make it the whole business of my life to please him!"\r\n\r\n"The _whole_ business?" said Mrs. Ormond, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Not the whole," said Virginia; "I hope my father will like Mr. Hervey.\r\nDid not you say that he is rich? I wish that my father may be _very_\r\nrich."\r\n\r\n"That is the last wish that I should have expected to hear from you, my\r\nVirginia."\r\n\r\n"But do you not know why I wish it?--that I may show my gratitude to Mr.\r\nHervey."\r\n\r\n"My dear child," said Mrs. Ormond, "these are most generous sentiments,\r\nand worthy of you; but do not let your imagination run away with you at\r\nthis rate--Mr. Hervey is rich enough."\r\n\r\n"I wish he were poor," said Virginia, "that I might make him rich."\r\n\r\n"He would not love you the better, my dear," said Mrs. Ormond, "if\r\nyou had the wealth of the Indies. Perhaps your father may not be rich;\r\ntherefore do not set your heart upon this idea."\r\n\r\nVirginia sighed: fear succeeded to hope, and her imagination immediately\r\nreversed the bright picture that it had drawn.\r\n\r\n"But I am afraid," said she, "that this gentleman is not my father--how\r\ndisappointed I shall be! I wish you had never told me all this, my dear\r\nMrs. Ormond."\r\n\r\n"I would not have told it to you, if Mr. Hervey had not desired that I\r\nshould; and you maybe sure he would not have desired it, unless he had\r\ngood reason to believe that you would not be disappointed."\r\n\r\n"But he is not sure--he does not say he is quite sure. And, even if I\r\nwere quite certain of his being my father, how can I be certain that he\r\nwill not disown me--he, who has deserted me so long? My grandmother, I\r\nremember, often used to say that he had no natural affection."\r\n\r\n"Your grandmother was mistaken, then; for he has been searching for\r\nhis child all over England, Mr. Hervey says; and he has almost lost his\r\nsenses with grief and with remorse!"\r\n\r\n"Remorse!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, remorse, for having so long deserted you: he fears that you will\r\nhate him."\r\n\r\n"Hate him!--is it possible to hate a father?" said Virginia.\r\n\r\n"He dreads that you should never forgive him."\r\n\r\n"Forgive him!--I have read of parents forgiving their children, but\r\nI never remember to have read of a daughter forgiving her father.\r\n_Forgive!_ you should not have used that word. I cannot _forgive_ my\r\nfather: but I can love him, and I will make him quite forget all his\r\nsorrows--I mean, all his sorrows about me."\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation Virginia spent her time in imagining what sort\r\nof person her father would be; whether he was like Mr. Hervey; what\r\nwords he would say; where he would sit; whether he would sit beside her;\r\nand, above all, whether he would give her his blessing.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," said she, "of liking my father better than _any body\r\nelse_."\r\n\r\n"No danger of that, my dear," said Mrs. Ormond, smiling.\r\n\r\n"I am glad of it, for it would be very wrong and _ungrateful_ to like\r\nany thing in this world so well as Mr. Hervey."\r\n\r\nThe carriage now came to the door: Mrs. Ormond instantly ran to the\r\nwindow, but Virginia had not power to move--her heart beat violently.\r\n\r\n"Is he come?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is getting out of the carriage this moment!"\r\n\r\nVirginia stood with her eyes eagerly fixed upon the door: "Hark!" said\r\nshe, laying her hand upon Mrs. Ormond\'s arm, to prevent her from moving:\r\n"Hush! that we may hear his voice."\r\n\r\nShe was breathless--no voice was to be heard: "They are not coming,"\r\nsaid she, turning as pale as death. An instant afterwards her colour\r\nreturned--she heard the steps of two people coming up the stairs.\r\n\r\n"His step!--Do you hear it?--Is it my father?"\r\n\r\nVirginia\'s imagination was worked to the highest pitch; she could\r\nscarcely sustain herself: Mrs. Ormond supported her. At this instant her\r\nfather appeared.\r\n\r\n"My child!--the image of her mother!" exclaimed he, stopping short: he\r\nsunk upon a chair.\r\n\r\n"My father!" cried Virginia, springing forward, and throwing herself at\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n"The voice of her mother!" said Mr. Hartley. "My daughter!--My long lost\r\nchild!"\r\n\r\nHe tried to raise her, but could not; her arms were clasped round his\r\nknee, her face rested upon it, and when he stooped to kiss her cheek, he\r\nfound it cold--she had fainted.\r\n\r\nWhen she came to her senses, and found herself in her father\'s arms, she\r\ncould scarcely believe that it was not a dream.\r\n\r\n"Your blessing!--give me your blessing, and then I shall know that you\r\nare indeed my father!" cried Virginia, kneeling to him, and looking up\r\nwith an enthusiastic expression of filial piety in her countenance.\r\n\r\n"God bless you, my sweet child!" said he, laying his hand upon her; "and\r\nGod forgive your father!"\r\n\r\n"My grandmother died without giving me her blessing," said Virginia;\r\n"but now I have been blessed by my father! Happy, happy moment!--O that\r\nshe could look down from heaven, and see us at this instant!"\r\n\r\nVirginia was so much astonished and overpowered by this sudden discovery\r\nof a parent, and by the novelty of his first caresses, that after the\r\nfirst violent effervescence of her sensibility was over, she might,\r\nto an indifferent spectator, have appeared stupid and insensible. Mrs.\r\nOrmond, though far from an indifferent spectator, was by no means a\r\npenetrating judge of the human heart: she seldom saw more than the\r\nexternal symptoms of feeling, and she was apt to be rather impatient\r\nwith her friends if theirs did not accord with her own.\r\n\r\n"Virginia, my dear," said she, in rather a reproachful tone, "Mr.\r\nHervey, you see, has left the room, on purpose to leave you at full\r\nliberty to talk to your father; and I am going--but you are so silent!"\r\n\r\n"I have so much to say, and my heart is so full!" said Virginia.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know you told me of a thousand things that you had to say to\r\nyour father, before you saw him."\r\n\r\n"But now I see him, I have forgotten them all. I can think of nothing\r\nbut of him."\r\n\r\n"Of him and Mr. Hervey," said Mrs. Ormond.\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of Mr. Hervey at that moment," said Virginia,\r\nblushing.\r\n\r\n"Well, my love, I will leave you to think and talk of what you please,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Ormond, smiling significantly as she left the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartley folded his daughter in his arms with the fondest expressions\r\nof parental affection, and he was upon the point of telling her how much\r\nhe approved of the choice of her heart; but he recollected his promise,\r\nand he determined to sound her inclinations farther, before he even\r\nmentioned the name of Clarence Hervey.\r\n\r\nHe began by painting the pleasures of the world, that world from which\r\nshe had hitherto been secluded.\r\n\r\nShe heard him with simple indifference: not even her curiosity was\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nHe observed, that though she had no curiosity to see, it was natural\r\nthat she must have some pleasure in the thoughts of being seen.\r\n\r\n"What pleasure?" said Virginia.\r\n\r\n"The pleasure of being admired and loved: beauty and grace such as\r\nyours, my child, cannot be seen without commanding admiration and love."\r\n\r\n"I do not want to be admired," replied Virginia, "and I want to be loved\r\nby those only whom I love."\r\n\r\n"My dearest daughter, you shall be entirely your own mistress; I will\r\nnever interfere, either directly or indirectly, in the disposal of your\r\nheart."\r\n\r\nAt these last words, Virginia, who had listened to all the rest unmoved,\r\ntook her father\'s hand, and kissed it repeatedly.\r\n\r\n"Now that I have found you, my darling child, let me at least make you\r\nhappy, if I can--it is the only atonement in my power; it will be the\r\nonly solace of my declining years. All that wealth can bestow--"\r\n\r\n"Wealth!" interrupted Virginia: "then you have wealth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my child--may it make you happy! that is all the enjoyment I\r\nexpect from it: it shall all be yours."\r\n\r\n"And may I do what I please with it?--Oh, then it will indeed make me\r\nhappy. I will give it all, all to Mr. Hervey. How delightful to have\r\nsomething to _give_ to Mr. Hervey!"\r\n\r\n"And had you never any thing to give to Mr. Hervey till now?"\r\n\r\n"Never! never! he has given me every thing. Now--oh, joyful day!--I can\r\nprove to him that Virginia is not ungrateful!"\r\n\r\n"Dear, generous girl," said her father, wiping the tears from his eyes,\r\n"what a daughter have I found! But tell me, my child," continued he,\r\nsmiling, "do you think Mr. Hervey will be content if you give him only\r\nyour fortune? Do you think that he would accept the fortune without the\r\nheart? Nay, do not turn away that dear blushing face from me; remember\r\nit is _your father_ who speaks to you. Mr. Hervey will not take your\r\nfortune without yourself, I am afraid: what shall we do? Must I refuse\r\nhim your hand?"\r\n\r\n"Refuse him! do you think that I could refuse him any thing, who\r\nhas given me every thing?--I should be a monster indeed! There is no\r\nsacrifice I would not make, no exertion of which I am not capable, for\r\nMr. Hervey\'s sake. But, my dear father," said she, changing her tone,\r\n"he never asked for my hand till yesterday."\r\n\r\nBut he had won your heart long ago, I see, thought her father.\r\n\r\n"I have written an answer to his letter; will you look at it, and tell\r\nme if you approve of it?"\r\n\r\n"I do approve of it, my darling child: I will not read it--I know what\r\nit must be: he has a right to the preference he has so nobly earned."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he has--he has, indeed!" cried Virginia, with an expression\r\nof strong feeling; "and now is the time to show him that I am not\r\nungrateful."\r\n\r\n"How I love you for this, my child!" cried her father, fondly embracing\r\nher. "This is exactly what I wished, though I did not dare to say so\r\ntill I was sure of your sentiments. Mr. Hervey charged me to leave you\r\nentirely to yourself; he thought that your new situation might perhaps\r\nproduce some change in your sentiments: I see he was mistaken; and I am\r\nheartily glad of it. But you are going to say something, my dear; do not\r\nlet me interrupt you."\r\n\r\n"I was only going to beg that you would give this letter, my dear\r\nfather, to Mr. Hervey. It is an answer to one which he wrote to me\r\nwhen I was poor"--_and deserted_, she was near saying, but she stopped\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"I wish," continued she, "Mr. Hervey should know that my sentiments are\r\nprecisely the same now that they have always been. Tell him," added she,\r\nproudly, "that he did me injustice by imagining that my sentiments could\r\nalter with my situation. He little knows Virginia." Clarence at this\r\nmoment entered the room, and Mr. Hartley eagerly led his daughter to\r\nmeet him.\r\n\r\n"Take her hand," cried he; "you have her heart--you deserve it; and\r\nshe has just been very angry with me for doubting. But read her\r\nletter,--that will speak better for her, and more to your satisfaction,\r\nno doubt, than I can."\r\n\r\nVirginia hastily put the letter into Mr. Hervey\'s hand, and, breaking\r\nfrom her father, retired to her own apartment.\r\n\r\nWith all the trepidation of a person who feels that the happiness of his\r\nlife is to be decided in a few moments, Clarence tore open Virginia\'s\r\nletter, and, conscious that he was not able to command his emotion, he\r\nwithdrew from her father\'s inquiring eyes. Mr. Hartley, however, saw\r\nnothing in this agitation but what he thought natural to a lover, and\r\nhe was delighted to perceive that his daughter had inspired so strong a\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nVirginia\'s letter contained but these few lines:\r\n\r\n"Most happy shall I be if the whole of my future life can prove to you\r\nhow deeply I feel your goodness.\r\n\r\n"VIRGINIA ST. PIERRE."\r\n\r\n[_End of C. Hervey\'s packet_.]\r\n\r\nAn acceptance so direct left Clarence no alternative: his fate was\r\ndecided. He determined immediately to force himself to see Belinda and\r\nMr. Vincent; for he fancied that his mind would be more at ease when he\r\nhad convinced himself by ocular demonstration that she was absolutely\r\nengaged to another; that, consequently, even if he were free, he could\r\nhave no chance of gaining her affections. There are moments when we\r\ndesire the conviction which at another time would overwhelm us with\r\ndespair: it was in this temper that Mr. Hervey paid his visit to Lady\r\nDelacour; but we have seen that he was unable to support for many\r\nminutes that philosophic composure to which, at his first entrance\r\ninto the room, he had worked up his mind. The tranquillity which he had\r\nexpected would be the consequence of this visit, he was farther than\r\never from obtaining. The extravagant joy with which Lady Delacour\r\nreceived him, and an indescribable something in her manner when she\r\nlooked from him to Belinda, and from Belinda to Mr. Vincent, persuaded\r\nhim her ladyship wished that he were in Mr. Vincent\'s place. The idea\r\nwas so delightful, that his soul was entranced, and for a few minutes\r\nVirginia, and every thing that related to her, vanished from his\r\nremembrance. It was whilst he was in this state that Lady Delacour (as\r\nthe reader may recollect) invited him into her lord\'s dressing-room,\r\nto tell her the contents of the packet, which had not then reached her\r\nhands. The request suddenly recalled him to his senses, but he felt\r\nthat he was not at this moment able to trust himself to her ladyship\'s\r\npenetration; he therefore referred her to his letter for that\r\nexplanation which he dreaded to make in person, and he escaped from\r\nBelinda\'s presence, resolving never more to expose himself to such\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nWhat effect his packet produced on Lady Delacour\'s mind and on\r\nBelinda\'s, we shall not at present stop to inquire; but having brought\r\nup Clarence Hervey\'s affairs to the present day, we shall continue his\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nE O.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Clarence Hervey was not much disposed to see either Virginia or\r\nher father whilst he was in the state of perturbation into which he had\r\nbeen thrown by his interview with Belinda, yet he did not delay to send\r\nhis servant home with a note to Mrs. Ormond, to say that he would meet\r\nMr. Hartley, whenever he pleased, at his lawyer\'s, to make whatever\r\narrangements might be necessary for proper settlements.\r\n\r\nAs he saw no possibility of receding with honour, he, with becoming\r\nresolution, desired to urge things forward as fast as possible, and to\r\nstrengthen in his mind the sense of the _necessity_ of the sacrifice\r\nthat he was bound to make. His passions were naturally impetuous, but\r\nhe had by persevering efforts brought them under the subjection of his\r\nreason. His power over himself was now to be put to a severe trial.\r\n\r\nAs he was going to town, he met Lord Delacour, who was riding in the\r\npark: he was extremely intent upon his own thoughts, and was anxious to\r\npass unnoticed. In former times this would have been the most feasible\r\nthing imaginable, for Lord Delacour used to detest the sight of Clarence\r\nHervey, whom he considered as the successor of Colonel Lawless in\r\nhis lady\'s favour; but his opinion and his feelings had been entirely\r\nchanged by the perusal of those letters, which were perfumed with ottar\r\nof roses: even this perfume had, from that association, become agreeable\r\nto him. He now accosted Clarence with a warmth and cordiality in\r\nhis manner that at any other moment must have pleased as much as\r\nit surprised him; but Clarence was not in a humour to enter into\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"You seem to be in haste, Mr. Hervey," said his lordship, observing his\r\nimpatience; "but, as I know your good-nature, I shall make no scruple to\r\ndetain you a quarter of an hour."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he turned his horse, and rode with Clarence, who looked as\r\nif he wished that his lordship had been more scrupulous, and that he had\r\nnot such a reputation for good-nature.\r\n\r\n"You will not refuse me this quarter of an hour, I am sure," continued\r\nLord Delacour, "when you hear that, by favouring me with your attention,\r\nyou may perhaps materially serve an old, or rather a young, friend of\r\nyours, and one whom I once fancied was a particular favourite--I mean,\r\nMiss Belinda Portman."\r\n\r\nAt the name of Belinda Portman, Clarence Hervey became all attention: he\r\nassured his lordship that he was in no haste; and all his difficulty now\r\nwas to moderate the eagerness of his curiosity.\r\n\r\n"We can take a turn or two in the park, as well as any where," said his\r\nlordship: "nobody will overhear us, and the sooner you know what I have\r\nto say the better."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Clarence.\r\n\r\nThe most malevolent person upon earth could not have tired poor\r\nClarence\'s patience more than good-natured Lord Delacour contrived to\r\ndo, with the best intentions possible, by his habitual circumlocution.\r\n\r\nHe descanted at length upon the difficulties, as the world goes, of\r\nmeeting with a confidential friend, whom it is prudent to trust in any\r\naffair that demands delicacy, honour, and address. Men of talents were\r\noften, he observed, devoid of integrity, and men of integrity devoid of\r\ntalents. When he had obtained Hervey\'s assent to this proposition, he\r\nnext paid him sundry handsome, but long-winded compliments: then he\r\ncomplimented himself for having just thought of Mr. Hervey as the\r\nfittest person he could apply to: then he congratulated himself upon his\r\ngood luck in meeting with the very man he was just thinking of. At last,\r\nafter Clarence had returned thanks for all his kindness, and had given\r\nassent to all his lordship\'s truisms, the substance of the business came\r\nout.\r\n\r\nLord Delacour informed Mr. Hervey, "that he had been lately\r\ncommissioned, by Lady Delacour, to discover what attractions drew a Mr.\r\nVincent so constantly to Mrs. Luttridge\'s----"\r\n\r\nHere he was going to explain who Mr. Vincent was; but Clarence\r\nassured him that he knew perfectly well that he had been a ward of Mr.\r\nPercival\'s, that he was a West Indian of large fortune, &c.\r\n\r\n"And a lover of Miss Portman\'s--that is the most material part of the\r\nstory to _me_," continued Lord Delacour; "for otherwise, you know, Mr.\r\nVincent would be no more to me than any other gentleman. But in that\r\npoint of view--I mean as a lover of Belinda Portman, and I may say, not\r\nquite unlikely to be her husband--he is highly interesting to my\r\nLady Delacour, and to me, and to you, as Miss Portman\'s well-wisher,\r\ndoubtless."\r\n\r\n"Doubtless!" was all Mr. Hervey could reply.\r\n\r\n"Now, you must know," continued his lordship, "that Lady Delacour\r\nhas, for a woman, an uncommon share of penetration, and can put things\r\ntogether in a wonderful way: in short, it has come to her (my Lady\r\nDelacour\'s) knowledge, that before Miss Portman was at Oakly-park last\r\nsummer, and after she left it this autumn, Mr. Vincent was a constant\r\nvisitor at Mrs. Luttridge\'s, whilst at Harrowgate, and used to play\r\nhigh (though unknown to the Percivals, of course) at billiards with Mr.\r\nLuttridge--a _man_, I confess, I disliked _always_, even when I carried\r\nthe election for them. But no matter: it is not from enmity I speak now.\r\nBut it is very well known that Luttridge has but a small fortune, and\r\nyet lives as if he had a large one; and all the young men who like high\r\nplay are sure to be well received at his house. Now, I hope Mr. Vincent\r\nis not well received on that footing.\r\n\r\n"Since my Lady Delacour and I have been such good friends," continued\r\nhis lordship, "I have dropped all connexion with the Luttridges; so\r\ncannot go there myself: moreover, I do not wish to be tempted to lose\r\nany more thousands to the lady. But you never play, and you are not\r\nlikely to be tempted to it now; so you will oblige me and Lady Delacour\r\nif you will go to Luttridge\'s to-night: she is always charmed to see\r\nyou, and you will easily discover how the land lies. Mr. Vincent is\r\ncertainly a very agreeable, open-hearted young man; but, if he game, God\r\nforbid that Miss Portman should ever be his wife!"\r\n\r\n"God forbid!" said Clarence Hervey.\r\n\r\n"The man," resumed Lord Delacour, "must, in my opinion, be very superior\r\nindeed who is deserving of Belinda Portman. Oh, Mr. Hervey, you do\r\nnot--you cannot know her merit, as I do. It is one thing, sir, to see\r\na fine girl in a ball-room, and another--quite another--to live in\r\nthe house with her for months, and to see her, as I have seen Belinda\r\nPortman, in every-day life, as one may call it. _Then_ it is one can\r\njudge of the real temper, manners, and character; and never woman had\r\nso sweet a temper, such charming manners, such a fair, open, generous,\r\ndecided yet gentle character, as this Miss Portman."\r\n\r\n"Your lordship speaks _con amore_," said Clarence.\r\n\r\n"I speak, Mr. Hervey, from the bottom of my soul," cried Lord Delacour,\r\npulling in his horse, and stopping short. "I should be an unfeeling,\r\nungrateful brute, if I were not sensible of the obligations--yes, the\r\nobligations--which my Lady Delacour and I have received from Belinda\r\nPortman. Why, sir, she has been the peacemaker between us--but we will\r\nnot talk of that now. Let us think of her affairs. If Mr. Vincent once\r\ngets into Mrs. Luttridge\'s cursed set, there\'s no knowing where it will\r\nend. I speak from my own experience, for I really never was fond of high\r\nplay; and yet, when I got into that set, I could not withstand it. I\r\nlost by hundreds and thousands; and so will he, before he is aware of\r\nit, no doubt. Mrs. Luttridge will look upon him as her dupe, and make\r\nhim such. I always--but this is between ourselves--suspected that I\r\ndid not lose my last thousand to her fairly. Now, Hervey, you know the\r\nwhole, do try and save Mr. Vincent, for Belinda Portman\'s sake."\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey shook hands with Lord Delacour, with a sentiment of real\r\ngratitude and affection; and assured him that his confidence was not\r\nmisplaced. His lordship little suspected that he had been soliciting him\r\nto save his rival. Clarence\'s love was not of that selfish sort which\r\nthe moment that it is deprived of hope sinks into indifference, or is\r\nconverted into hatred. Belinda could not be his; but, in the midst of\r\nthe bitterest regret, he was supported by the consciousness of his\r\nown honour and generosity: he felt a noble species of delight in the\r\nprospect of promoting the happiness of the woman upon whom his\r\nfondest affections had been fixed; and he rejoiced to feel that he had\r\nsufficient magnanimity to save a rival from ruin. He was even determined\r\nto make that rival his friend, notwithstanding the prepossession which,\r\nhe clearly perceived, Mr. Vincent felt against him.\r\n\r\n"His jealousy will be extinguished the moment he knows my real\r\nsituation," said Clarence to himself. "He will be convinced that I have\r\na soul incapable of envy; and, if he suspect my love for Belinda, he\r\nwill respect the strength of mind with which I can command my passions.\r\nI take it for granted that Mr. Vincent must possess a heart and\r\nunderstanding such as I should desire in a friend, or he could never\r\nbe--what he is to Belinda."\r\n\r\nFull of these generous sentiments, Clarence waited with impatience for\r\nthe hour when he might present himself at Mrs. Luttridge\'s. He went\r\nthere so early in the evening, that he found the drawing-room quite\r\nempty; the company, who had been invited to dine, had not yet left\r\nthe dining-room, and the servants had but just set the card-tables and\r\nlighted the candles. Mr. Hervey desired that nobody should be disturbed\r\nby his coming so early; and, fortunately, Mrs. Luttridge was detained\r\nsome minutes by Lady Newland\'s lingering glass of Madeira. In the mean\r\ntime, Clarence executed his design. From his former observations, and\r\nfrom the hints that Lord Delacour had let fall, he suspected that\r\nthere was sometimes in this house not only high play, but foul play:\r\nhe recollected that once, when he played there at billiards, he had\r\nperceived that the table was not perfectly horizontal; and it occurred\r\nto him, that perhaps the E O table might be so contrived as to put\r\nthe fortunes of all who played at it in the power of the proprietor.\r\nClarence had sufficient ingenuity to invent the method by which this\r\nmight be done; and he had the infallible means in his possession of\r\ndetecting the fraud. The E O table was in an apartment adjoining to\r\nthe drawing-room: he found his way to it; and he discovered, beyond a\r\npossibility of doubt, that it was constructed for the purposes of fraud.\r\nHis first impulse was to tell this immediately to Mr. Vincent, to\r\nput him on his guard; but, upon reflection, he determined to keep his\r\ndiscovery to himself, till he was satisfied whether that gentleman had\r\nor had not any passion for play.\r\n\r\n"If he have," thought Clarence, "it is of the utmost consequence to Miss\r\nPortman that he should early in life receive a shock that may leave an\r\nindelible impression upon his mind. To save him a few hours of remorse,\r\nI will not give up the power of doing him the most essential service. I\r\nwill let him go on--if he be so inclined--to the very verge of ruin\r\nand despair: I will let him feel all the horrors of a gamester\'s fate,\r\nbefore I tell him that I have the means to save him. Mrs. Luttridge\r\nmust, when I call upon her, refund whatever he may lose: she will not\r\nbrave public shame--she cannot stand a public prosecution."\r\n\r\nScarcely had Clarence arranged his scheme, when he heard the voices of\r\nthe ladies, who were coming up stairs.\r\n\r\nMrs. Luttridge made her appearance, accompanied by a very pretty,\r\nmodish, affected young lady, Miss Annabella Luttridge, her niece. Her\r\nlittle coquettish airs were lost upon Clarence Hervey, whose eye was\r\nintently fixed upon the door, watching for the entrance of Mr. Vincent.\r\nHe was one of the dinner party, and he came up soon after the ladies.\r\nHe seemed prepared for the sight of Mr. Hervey, to whom he bowed with\r\na cold, haughty air; and then addressed himself to Miss Annabella\r\nLuttridge, who showed the most obvious desire to attract his attention.\r\n\r\nFrom all that passed this evening, Mr. Hervey was led to suspect,\r\nnotwithstanding the reasons which made it apparently improbable, that\r\nthe fair Annabella was the secret cause of Mr. Vincent\'s frequent visits\r\nat her aunt\'s. It was natural that Clarence should be disposed to this\r\nopinion, from the circumstances of his own situation. During three hours\r\nthat he stayed at Mrs. Luttridge\'s, Mr. Vincent never joined any of\r\nthe parties at play; but, just as he was going away, he heard some one\r\nsay--"How comes it, Vincent, that you\'ve been idle all night?" This\r\nquestion revived Mr. Hervey\'s suspicions; and, uncertain what report he\r\nshould make to Lord Delacour, he resolved to defer making any, till he\r\nhad farther opportunities of judging.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hervey asked himself how it was possible that the pupil of Mr.\r\nPercival could become a gamester, he forgot that Mr. Vincent had not\r\nbeen educated by his guardian; that he had lived in the West Indies\r\ntill he was eighteen; and that he had only been under the care of Mr.\r\nPercival for a few years, after his habits and character were in a great\r\nmeasure formed. The taste for gambling he had acquired whilst he was a\r\nchild; but, as it was then confined to trifles, it had been passed over,\r\nas a thing of no consequence, a boyish folly, that would never grow\r\nup with him: his father used to see him, day after day, playing with\r\neagerness at games of chance, with his negroes, or with the sons of\r\nneighbouring planters; yet he was never alarmed: he was too intent upon\r\nmaking a fortune for his family to consider how they would spend it;\r\nand he did not foresee that this boyish fault might be the means of his\r\nson\'s losing, in a few hours, the wealth which he had been many years\r\namassing. When young Vincent came over to England, Mr. Percival had not\r\nimmediate opportunities of discovering this particular foible in his\r\nward; but he perceived that in his mind there was that presumptuous\r\nbelief in his special good fortune which naturally leads to the love\r\nof gambling. Instead of lecturing him, his guardian appealed to his\r\nunderstanding, and took opportunities of showing him the ruinous\r\neffects of high play in real life. Young Vincent was touched, and, as\r\nhe thought, convinced; but his emotion was stronger than his\r\nconviction--his feelings were always more powerful than his reason.\r\nHis detestation of the selfish character of a gamester was felt and\r\nexpressed with enthusiasm and eloquence; and his indignation rose\r\nafterwards at the slightest hint that _he_ might ever in future be\r\ntempted to become what he abhorred. Unfortunately he disdained prudence,\r\nas the factitious virtue of inferior minds: he thought that the\r\n_feelings_ of a man of honour were to be his guide in the first and last\r\nappeal; and for his conduct through life, as a man and as a gentleman,\r\nhe proudly professed to trust to the sublime instinct of a good heart.\r\nHis guardian\'s doubts of the infallibility and even of the existence of\r\nthis moral instinct wounded Mr. Vincent\'s pride instead of alarming his\r\nunderstanding; and he was rather eager than averse to expose himself to\r\nthe danger, that he might prove his superiority to the temptation. How\r\ndifferent are the feelings in different situations! Yet often as\r\nthis has been repeated, how difficult it is to impress the truth upon\r\ninexperienced, sanguine minds!--Whilst young Vincent was immediately\r\nunder his guardian\'s eye at Oakly-park, his safety from vice appeared\r\nto him inglorious; he was impatient to sally forth into the world,\r\nconfident rather of his innate than acquired virtue.\r\n\r\nWhen he first became acquainted with Mrs. Luttridge at Harrowgate, he\r\nknew that she was a professed gambler, and he despised the character;\r\nyet without reflecting on the danger, or perhaps for the pleasure of\r\nconvincing Mr. Percival that he was superior to it, he continued his\r\nvisits. For some time he was a passive spectator. Billiards, however,\r\nwas a game of address, not chance; there was a billiard-table at\r\nOakly-park, as well as at Mr. Luttridge\'s, and he had played with his\r\nguardian. Why, then, should he not play with Mr. Luttridge? He did play:\r\nhis skill was admired; he betted, and his bets were successful: but he\r\ndid not call this gaming, for the bets were not to any great amount, and\r\nit was only playing at billiards. Mr. Percival was delayed in town some\r\nweeks longer than usual, and he knew nothing of the manner in which his\r\nyoung friend spent his time. As soon as Mr. Vincent heard of his\r\narrival at Oakly-park, he left half finished his game at billiards;\r\nand, fortunately for him, the charms of Belinda made him forget for\r\nsome months that such a thing as a billiard-table existed. All that had\r\nhappened at Mr. Luttridge\'s passed from his mind as a dream; and whilst\r\nhis heart was agitated by his new passion, he could scarcely believe\r\nthat he had ever been interested by any other feelings. He was surprised\r\nwhen he accidentally recollected the eagerness with which he used to\r\n_amuse_ himself in Mr. Luttridge\'s company; but he was certain that\r\nall this was passed for ever; and precisely because he was under the\r\ndominion of one strong passion, he thought he could never be under the\r\ndominion of another. Thus persisting in his disdain of reason as a moral\r\nguide, Mr. Vincent thought, acted, and suffered as a man of feeling.\r\nScarcely had Belinda left Oakly-park for one week when the ennui\r\nconsequent to violent passion became insupportable; and to console\r\nhimself for her absence he flew to the billiard-table. Emotion of some\r\nkind or other was become necessary to him; he said that not to feel was\r\nnot to live; and soon the suspense, the anxiety, the hopes, the fears,\r\nthe perpetual vicissitudes of a gamester\'s life, seemed to him almost\r\nas delightful as those of a lover\'s. Deceived by these appearances, Mrs.\r\nLuttridge thought that his affection for Belinda either was or might\r\nbe conquered, and her hopes of obtaining his fortune for her niece\r\nAnnabella revived. As Mr. Vincent could not endure Mrs. Freke, she\r\nabstained, at her friend\'s particular desire, from appearing at her\r\nhouse whilst he was there, and Mrs. Luttridge interested him much in her\r\nown favour, by representing her indignation at _Harriot\'s_ conduct to\r\nbe such that it had occasioned a total breach in their friendship. Mrs.\r\nFreke\'s sudden departure from Harrowgate confirmed the probability of\r\nthis quarrel; yet these two ladies were secretly leagued together in a\r\ndesign of breaking off Mr. Vincent\'s match with Belinda, against whom\r\nMrs. Freke had vowed revenge. The anonymous letter, which she hoped\r\nwould work her purpose, produced, however, an effect totally unexpected\r\nupon his generous mind: he did not guess the writer; but his indignation\r\nagainst such base accusations burst forth with a violence that\r\nastounded Mrs. Luttridge. His love for Belinda appeared ten times more\r\nenthusiastic than before--the moment she was accused, he felt himself\r\nher defender, as well as her lover. He was dispossessed of the evil\r\nspirit of gambling as if by a miracle; and the billiard-table, and\r\nMrs. Luttridge, and Miss Annabella, vanished from his view. He breathed\r\nnothing but love; he would ask no permission, he would wait for none\r\nfrom Belinda: he declared that instant he would set out in search of\r\nher, and he would tear that infamous letter to atoms in her presence;\r\nhe would show her how impossible suspicion was to his nature. The first\r\nviolence of the hurricane Mrs. Luttridge could not stand, and thought\r\nnot of opposing; but whilst his horses and curricle were getting ready,\r\nshe took such an affectionate leave of his dog Juba, and she protested\r\nso much that she and Annabella should not know how to live without poor\r\nJuba, that Mr. Vincent, who was excessively fond of his dog, could\r\nnot help sympathizing in their sorrow: reasoning just as well as they\r\nwished, he extended his belief in their affection for this animal\r\nto friendship, if not love, for his master. He could not grant Mrs.\r\nLuttridge\'s earnest supplication to leave the dog behind him under her\r\nprotection; but he promised--and laid his hand upon his heart when he\r\npromised--that Juba should wait upon Mrs. Luttridge as soon as she went\r\nto town. This appointment being made, Miss Annabella permitted herself\r\nto be somewhat consoled. It would be injustice to omit that she did\r\nall that could be done by a cambric handkerchief to evince delicate\r\nsensibility in this parting scene. Mrs. Luttridge also deserves her\r\nshare of praise for the manner in which she reproved her niece for\r\ngiving way to her feelings, and for the address with which she wished to\r\nHeaven that poor Annabella had the calm philosophic temper of which Miss\r\nPortman was, she understood, a most uncommon example.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Vincent drove toward London he reflected upon these last words;\r\nand he could not help thinking that if Belinda had more faults she would\r\nbe more amiable.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were, however, driven from his mind, and scarcely left\r\na trace behind them, when he once more saw and conversed with her. The\r\ndignity, sincerity, and kindness which she showed the evening that he\r\nput the anonymous letter into her hands charmed and touched him, and his\r\nreal feelings and his enthusiasm conspired to make him believe that his\r\nwhole happiness depended on her smiles. The confession which she made\r\nto him of her former attachment to Clarence Hervey, as it raised in\r\nVincent\'s mind strong emotions of jealousy, increased his passion\r\nas much as it piqued his pride; and she appeared in a new and highly\r\ninteresting light when he discovered that the coldness of manner\r\nwhich he had attributed to want of sensibility arose probably from its\r\nexcess--that her heart should have been preoccupied was more tolerable\r\nto him than the belief of her settled indifference. He was so intent\r\nupon these delightful varieties in his love for Belinda that it was not\r\ntill he had received a reproachful note from Mrs. Luttridge, to remind\r\nhim of his promised visit with Juba, that he could prevail upon himself\r\nto leave Twickenham, even for a few hours. Lady Delacour\'s hatred\r\nor fear of Juba, which he accidentally mentioned to Miss Annabella,\r\nappeared to her and to her aunt "the most extraordinary thing upon\r\nearth;" and when it was contrasted with their excessive fondness, it\r\nseemed to him indeed unaccountable. From pure consideration for her\r\nladyship\'s nerves, Mrs. Luttridge petitioned Vincent to leave the dog\r\nwith her, that Helena might not be in such imminent danger from\r\n"the animal\'s monstrous jaws." The petition was granted; and as the\r\npetitioners foresaw, Juba became to them a most useful auxiliary.\r\nJuba\'s master called daily to see him, and sometimes when he came in the\r\nmorning Mrs. Luttridge was not at home, so that his visits were repeated\r\nin the evening; and the evening in London is what in other places is\r\ncalled the night. Mrs. Luttridge\'s nights could not be passed without\r\ndeep play. The sight of the E O table at first shocked Mr. Vincent: he\r\nthought of Mr. Percival, and he turned away from it; but to his\r\nactive social disposition it was extremely irksome to stand idle and\r\nuninterested where all were busy and eager in one common pursuit; to his\r\ngenerous temper it seemed ungentlemanlike to stand by the silent\r\ncensor of the rest of the company; and when he considered of how little\r\nimportance a few hundreds or even thousands could be to a man of his\r\nlarge fortune, he _could not help feeling_ that it was sordid, selfish,\r\navaricious, to dread their possible loss; and thus social spirit,\r\ncourage, generosity, all conspired to carry our man of feeling to the\r\ngaming-table. Once there, his ruin was inevitable. Mrs. Luttridge,\r\nwhilst she held his doom in her power, hesitated only whether it would\r\nbe more her interest to marry him to her niece, or to content herself\r\nwith his fortune. His passion for Belinda, which she saw had been by\r\nsome means or other increased, in spite of the anonymous letter, gave\r\nher little hopes of Annabella\'s succeeding, even with the assistance\r\nof Juba and delicate sensibility. So the aunt, careless of her niece\'s\r\ndisappointment, determined that Mr. Vincent should be _her_ victim; and\r\nsensible that she must not give him time for reflection, she hurried\r\nhim on, till, in the course of a few evenings spent at the E O table,\r\nhe lost not only thousands, but tens of thousands. One lucky night,\r\nshe assured him, would set all to rights; the run could not always be\r\nagainst him, and fortune must change in his favour, if he tried her with\r\nsufficient perseverance.\r\n\r\nThe horror, the agony of mind, which he endured at this sudden ruin\r\nwhich seemed impending over him--the recollection of Belinda, of Mr.\r\nPercival, almost drove him to distraction. He retreated from the E O\r\ntable one night, swearing that he never would hazard another guinea. But\r\nhis ruin was not yet complete--he had thousands yet to lose, and Mrs.\r\nLuttridge would not thus relinquish her prey. She persuaded him to try\r\nhis fortune _once_ more. She now suffered him to regain courage, by\r\nwinning back some of his own money. His mind was relieved from the sense\r\nof immediate danger; he rejoiced to be saved from the humiliation of\r\nconfessing his losses to Mr. Percival and Belinda. The next day he saw\r\nher with unusual pleasure, and this was the very morning Clarence Hervey\r\npaid his visit. The imprudence of Lady Delacour, joined perhaps to his\r\nown consciousness that he had a secret fault, which ought to lower him\r\nin the esteem of his mistress, made him misinterpret every thing that\r\npassed--his jealousy was excited in the most sudden and violent manner.\r\nHe flew from Lady Delacour\'s to Mrs. Luttridge\'s--he was soothed\r\nand flattered by the apparent kindness with which he was received by\r\nAnnabella and her aunt; but after dinner, when one of the servants\r\nwhispered to Mrs. Luttridge, who sat next to him, that Mr. Clarence\r\nHervey was above stairs, he gave such a start, that the fair Annabella\'s\r\nlap did not escape a part of the bumper of wine which he was going to\r\ndrink to her health. In the confusion and apologies which this accident\r\noccasioned, Mrs. Luttridge had time to consider what might be the cause\r\nof the start, and she combined her suspicions so quickly and judiciously\r\nthat she guessed the truth--that he feared to be seen at the E O table\r\nby a person who might find it for his interest to tell the truth to\r\nBelinda Portman. "Mr. Vincent," said she, in a low voice, "I have such\r\na terrible headache, that I am fit for nothing--I am not _up_ to E O\r\nto-night, so you must wait for your revenge till to-morrow."\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent was heartily glad to be relieved from his engagement, and he\r\nendeavoured to escape Clarence\'s suspicions, by devoting his whole time\r\nthis evening to Annabella, not in the least apprehensive that Mr. Hervey\r\nwould return the next night. Mr. Vincent was at the E O table at the\r\nusual hour, for he was excessively anxious to regain what he had lost,\r\nnot so much for the sake of the money, which he could afford to lose,\r\nbut lest the defalcation in his fortune should lead Mr. Percival to the\r\nknowledge of the means which had occasioned it. He could not endure,\r\nafter his high vaunts, to see himself humbled by his rash confidence in\r\nhimself, and he secretly vowed, that if he could but reinstate himself,\r\nby one night\'s good luck, he would for ever quit the society of\r\ngamblers. A few months before this time, he would have scorned the idea\r\nof concealing any part of his conduct, any one of his actions, from\r\nhis best friend, Mr. Percival; but his pride now reconciled him to the\r\nmeanness of concealment; and here, the acuteness of his feelings was\r\nto his own mind an excuse for dissimulation: so fallacious is moral\r\ninstinct, unenlightened or uncontrolled by reason and religion.\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent was disappointed in his hopes of regaining what he had lost.\r\nThis was not the fortunate night, which Mrs. Luttridge\'s prognostics\r\nhad vainly taught him to expect: he played on, however, with all the\r\nimpetuosity of his natural temper; his judgment forsook him; he scarcely\r\nknew what he said or did; and, in the course of a few hours, he was\r\nworked up to such a pitch of insanity, that in one desperate moment he\r\nbetted nearly all that he was worth in the world--and lost! He stood\r\nlike one stupified: the hum of voices scarcely reached his ear--he saw\r\nfigures moving before him; but he did not distinguish who or what they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nSupper was announced, and the room emptied fast, whilst he remained\r\nmotionless leaning on the E O table. He was roused by Mrs. Luttridge\r\nsaying, as she passed, "Don\'t you sup to-night, Mr. Hervey?"--Vincent\r\nlooked up, and saw Clarence Hervey opposite to him. His countenance\r\ninstantly changed, and the lightning of anger flashed through the gloom\r\nof despair: he uttered not a syllable; but his looks said, "How is this,\r\nsir? Here again to-night to watch me?--to enjoy my ruin?--to be ready to\r\ncarry the first news of it to Belinda?"\r\n\r\nAt this last thought, Vincent struck his closed hand with violence\r\nagainst his forehead; and rushing by Mr. Hervey, who in vain attempted\r\nto speak to him, he pressed into the midst of the crowd on the stairs,\r\nand let himself be carried along with them into the supper-room. At\r\nsupper he took his usual seat between Mrs. Luttridge and the fair\r\nAnnabella; and, as if determined to brave the observing eyes of Clarence\r\nHervey, who was at the same table, he affected extravagant gaiety; he\r\nate, drank, talked, and laughed, more than any of the company. Toward\r\nthe end of the supper, his dog, who was an inmate at Mrs. Luttridge\'s,\r\nlicked his hand to put him in mind that he had given him nothing to eat.\r\n\r\n"Drink, Juba!--drink, and never have done, boy!" cried Vincent, holding\r\na bumper of wine to the dog\'s mouth; "he\'s the only dog I ever saw\r\ntaste wine." Then snatching up some of the flowers, which ornamented the\r\ntable, he swore that Juba should henceforward be called Anacreon, and\r\nthat he deserved to be crowned with roses by the hand of beauty. The\r\nfair Annabella instantly took a hothouse rose from her bosom, and\r\nassisted in making the garland, with which she crowned the new Anacreon.\r\nInsensible to his honours, the dog, who was extremely hungry, turned\r\nsuddenly to Mrs. Luttridge, by whom he had, till this night, regularly\r\nbeen fed with the choicest morsels, and lifting up his huge paw, laid\r\nit, as he had been wont to do, upon her arm. She shook it off: he,\r\nknowing nothing of the change in his master\'s affairs, laid the paw\r\nagain upon her arm; and with that familiarity to which he had long been\r\nencouraged, raised his head almost close to the lady\'s cheek.\r\n\r\n"Down, Juba!--down, sir, down!" cried Mrs. Luttridge, in a sharp voice.\r\n\r\n"Down, Juba!--down, sir!" repeated Mr. Vincent, in a tone of bitter\r\nfeeling, all his assumed gaiety forsaking him at this instant: "Down,\r\nJuba!--down, sir, down!" as low as your master, thought he; and pushing\r\nback his chair, he rose from table, and precipitately left the room.\r\n\r\nLittle notice was taken of his retreat; the chairs closed in; and\r\nthe gap which his vacant place left was visible but for a moment: the\r\ncompany were as gay as before; the fair Annabella smiled with a grace\r\nas attractive; and Mrs. Luttridge exulted in the success of her\r\nschemes--whilst her victim was in the agonies of despair.\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey, who had watched every change of Vincent\'s countenance,\r\nsaw the agony of soul with which he rose from the table, and quitted the\r\nroom: he suspected his purpose, and followed him immediately; but Mr.\r\nVincent had got out of the house before he could overtake him; which\r\nway he was gone no one could tell, for no one had seen him; the only\r\ninformation he could gain was, that he might possibly be heard of at\r\nNerot\'s Hotel, or at Governor Montford\'s, in Portland-place. The hotel\r\nwas but a few yards from Mrs. Luttridge\'s. Clarence went there directly.\r\nHe asked for Mr. Vincent. One of the waiters said, that he was not yet\r\ncome in; but another called out, "Mr. Vincent, sir, did you say? I have\r\njust shown him up to his room."\r\n\r\n"Which is the room?--I must see him instantly," cried Hervey.\r\n\r\n"Not to-night--you can\'t see him now, sir. Mr. Vincent won\'t let you\r\nin, I can assure you, sir. I went up myself three minutes ago, with some\r\nletters, that came whilst he was away, but he would not let me in. I\r\nheard him double-lock the door, and he swore terribly. I can\'t go up\r\nagain at this time o\'night--for my life I dare not, sir."\r\n\r\n"Where is his own man?--Has Mr. Vincent any servant here?--Mr. Vincent\'s\r\nman!" cried Clarence; "let me see him!"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t, sir. Mr. Vincent has just sent his black, the only servant\r\nhe has here, out on some message. Indeed, sir, there\'s no use in going\r\nup," continued the waiter, as Clarence sprang up two or three stairs\r\nat once: "Mr. Vincent has desired nobody may disturb him. I give you my\r\nword, sir, he\'ll be very angry; and, besides, \'twould be to no purpose,\r\nfor he\'ll not unlock the door."\r\n\r\n"Is there but one door to the room?" said Mr. Hervey; and, as he asked\r\nthe question, he pulled a guinea out of his pocket, and touched the\r\nwaiter\'s hand with it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, now I recollect--yes, sir, there\'s a private door through a closet:\r\nmay be that mayn\'t be fastened."\r\n\r\nClarence put the guinea into the waiter\'s hand, who instantly showed him\r\nthe way up the back staircase to the door that opened into Mr. Vincent\'s\r\nbed-chamber.\r\n\r\n"Leave me now," whispered he, "and make no noise."\r\n\r\nThe man withdrew; and as Mr. Hervey went close to the concealed door,\r\nto try if it was fastened, he distinctly heard a pistol cocked. The door\r\nwas not fastened: he pushed it softly open, and saw the unfortunate man\r\nupon his knees, the pistol in his hand, his eyes looking up to heaven.\r\nClarence was in one moment behind him; and, seizing hold of the pistol,\r\nhe snatched it from Vincent\'s grasp with so much calm presence of mind\r\nand dexterity, that, although the pistol was cocked, it did not go off.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hervey!" exclaimed Vincent, starting up. Astonishment overpowered\r\nall other sensations. But the next instant recovering the power of\r\nspeech, "Is this the conduct of a gentleman, Mr. Hervey--of a man of\r\nhonour," cried he, "thus to intrude upon my privacy; to be a spy upon my\r\nactions; to triumph in my ruin; to witness my despair; to rob me of the\r\nonly--"\r\n\r\nHe looked wildly at the pistol which Clarence held in his hand; then\r\nsnatching up another, which lay upon the table, he continued, "You are\r\nmy enemy--I know it; you are my rival; I know it; Belinda loves you!\r\nNay, affect not to start--this is no time for dissimulation--Belinda\r\nloves you--you know it: for her sake, for your own, put me out of the\r\nworld--put me out of torture. It shall not be called murder: it shall\r\nbe called a duel. You have been a spy upon my actions--I demand\r\nsatisfaction. If you have one spark of honour or of courage within you,\r\nMr. Hervey, show it now--fight me, sir, openly as man to man, rival to\r\nrival, enemy to enemy--fire."\r\n\r\n"If you fire upon me, you will repent it," replied Clarence calmly; "for\r\nI am not your enemy--I am not your rival."\r\n\r\n"You _are_," interrupted Vincent, raising his voice to the highest pitch\r\nof indignation: "you are my rival, though you dare not avow it! The\r\ndenial is base, false, unmanly. Oh, Belinda, is this the being you\r\nprefer to _me_? Gamester--wretch, as I am, my soul never stooped to\r\nfalsehood! Treachery I abhor; courage, honour, and a heart worthy\r\nof Belinda, I possess. I beseech you, sir," continued he, addressing\r\nhimself, in a tremulous tone of contempt, to Mr. Hervey, "I beseech you,\r\nsir, to leave me to my own feelings--and to myself."\r\n\r\n"You are not yourself at this moment, and I cannot leave you to such\r\nmistaken feelings," replied Hervey: "command yourself for a moment, and\r\nhear me; use your reason, and you will soon be convinced that I am your\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\n"My friend!"\r\n\r\n"Your friend. For what purpose did I come here? to snatch this pistol\r\nfrom your hand? If it were my interest, my wish, that you were out of\r\nthe world, why did I prevent you from destroying yourself? Do you think\r\n_that_ the action of an enemy? Use your reason."\r\n\r\n"I cannot," said Vincent, striking his forehead; "I know not what to\r\nthink--I am not master of myself. I conjure you, sir, for your own sake,\r\nto leave me."\r\n\r\n"For my _own_ sake!" repeated Hervey, disdainfully: "I am not thinking\r\nof myself; nor can any thing you have said provoke me from my purpose.\r\nMy purpose is to save you from ruin, for the sake of a woman, whom,\r\nthough I am no longer your rival, I have loved longer, if not better,\r\nthan you have."\r\n\r\nThere was something so open in Hervey\'s countenance, such a strong\r\nexpression of truth in his manner, that it could not be resisted, and\r\nVincent, in an altered voice, exclaimed, "You acknowledge that you have\r\nloved Belinda--and could you cease to love her? Impossible!--And, loving\r\nher, must you not detest me?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Clarence, holding out his hand to him; "I wish to be your\r\nfriend. I have not the baseness to wish to deprive others of happiness\r\nbecause I cannot enjoy it myself. In one word, to put you at ease with\r\nme for ever, I have no pretensions, I can have none, to Miss Portman.\r\nI am engaged to another woman--in a few days you will hear of my\r\nmarriage."\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent threw the pistol from him, and gave his hand to Hervey.\r\n\r\n"Pardon what I said to you just now," cried he; "I knew not what\r\nI said--I spoke in the agony of despair: your purpose is most\r\ngenerous--but it is in vain--you come too late--I am ruined, past all\r\nhope."\r\n\r\nHe folded his arms, and his eyes reverted involuntarily to his pistols.\r\n\r\n"The misery that you have this night experienced," said Mr. Hervey, "was\r\nnecessary to the security of your future happiness."\r\n\r\n"Happiness!" repeated Vincent; "happiness--there is no happiness left\r\nfor me. My doom is fixed--fixed by my own folly--my own rash, headstrong\r\nfolly. Madman that I was, what could tempt me to the gaming-table?\r\nOh! if I could recall but a few days, a few hours of my existence! But\r\nremorse is vain--prudence comes too late. Do you know," said he, fixing\r\nhis eyes upon Hervey, "do you know that I am a beggar? that I have not a\r\nfarthing left upon earth? Go to Belinda; tell her so: tell her, that if\r\nshe had ever the slightest regard for me, I deserve it no longer. Tell\r\nher to forget, despise, detest me. Give her joy that she has escaped\r\nhaving a gamester for a husband."\r\n\r\n"I will," said Clarence, "I will, if you please, tell her what I believe\r\nto be true, that the agony you have felt this night, the dear-bought\r\nexperience you have had, will be for ever a warning."\r\n\r\n"A warning!" interrupted Vincent: "Oh, that it could yet be useful to\r\nme!--But I tell you it comes too late--nothing can save me."\r\n\r\n"_I_ can," said Mr. Hervey. "Swear to me, for Belinda\'s sake--solemnly\r\nswear to me, that you will never more trust your happiness and hers\r\nto the hazard of a die--swear that you will never more, directly or\r\nindirectly, play at any game of chance, and I will restore to you the\r\nfortune that you have lost."\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent stood as if suspended between ecstasy and despair: he dared\r\nnot trust his senses: with a fervent and solemn adjuration he made the\r\nvow that was required of him; and Clarence then revealed to him the\r\nsecret of the E O table.\r\n\r\n"When Mrs. Luttridge knows that I have it in my power to expose her to\r\npublic shame, she will instantly refund all that she has iniquitously\r\nwon from you. Even among gamblers she would be blasted for ever by this\r\ndiscovery: she knows it, and if she dared to brave public opinion, we\r\nhave then a sure resource in the law--prosecute her. The laws of honour,\r\nas well as the laws of the land, will support the prosecution. But she\r\nwill never let the affair go into a court of justice. I will see her\r\nearly, as early as I can to-morrow, and put you out of suspense."\r\n\r\n"Most generous of human beings!" exclaimed Vincent; "I cannot express to\r\nyou what I feel; but your own heart, your own approbation--"\r\n\r\n"Farewell, good night," interrupted Clarence; "I see that I have made a\r\nfriend--I was determined that Belinda\'s husband should be my friend--I\r\nhave succeeded beyond my hopes. And now I will _intrude_ no longer,"\r\nsaid he, as he closed the door after him. His sensations at this instant\r\nwere more delightful even than those of the man he had relieved from\r\nthe depth of despair. How wisely has Providence made the benevolent and\r\ngenerous passions the most pleasurable!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nA JEW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the silence of the night, when the hurry of action was over, and the\r\nenthusiasm of generosity began to subside, the words, which had escaped\r\nfrom Mr. Vincent in the paroxysm of despair and rage--the words,\r\n"_Belinda loves you_"--recurred to Clarence Hervey; and it required all\r\nhis power over himself to banish the sound from his ear, and the idea\r\nfrom his mind. He endeavoured to persuade himself that these words were\r\ndictated merely by sudden jealousy, and that there could be no real\r\nfoundation for the assertion: perhaps this belief was a necessary\r\nsupport to his integrity. He reflected, that, at all events, his\r\nengagement with Virginia could not be violated; his proffered services\r\nto Mr. Vincent could not be withdrawn: he was firm and consistent.\r\nBefore two o\'clock the next day, Vincent received from Clarence this\r\nshort note:\r\n\r\n"Enclosed is Mrs. Luttridge\'s acknowledgment, that she has no claims\r\nupon you, in consequence of what passed last night. I said nothing about\r\nthe money she had previously won, as I understand you have paid it.\r\n\r\n"The lady fell into fits, but it would not do. The husband attempted to\r\nbully me; I told him I should be at his service, after he had made the\r\nwhole affair public, by calling you out.\r\n\r\n"I would have seen you myself this morning, but that I am engaged with\r\nlawyers and marriage settlements.\r\n\r\n"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n"CLARENCE HERVEY."\r\n\r\nOverjoyed at the sight of Mrs. Luttridge\'s acknowledgment, Vincent\r\nrepeated his vow never more to hazard himself in her dangerous society.\r\nHe was impatient to see Belinda; and, full of generous and grateful\r\nsentiments, in his first moment of joy, he determined to conceal nothing\r\nfrom her; to make at once the confession of his own imprudence and the\r\neulogium of Clarence Hervey\'s generosity. He was just setting out for\r\nTwickenham, when he was sent for by his uncle, Governor Montford, who\r\nhad business to settle with him, relative to his West India estates. He\r\nspent the remainder of the morning with his uncle; and there he received\r\na charming letter from Belinda--that letter which she had written and\r\nsent whilst Lady Delacour was reading Clarence Hervey\'s packet. It would\r\nhave cured Vincent of jealousy, even if he had not, in the interim, seen\r\nMr. Hervey, and learnt from him the news of his approaching marriage.\r\nMiss Portman, at the conclusion of her letter, informed him that Lady\r\nDelacour purposed being in Berkeley-square the next day; that they were\r\nto spend a week in town, on account of Mrs. Margaret Delacour, who\r\nhad promised her ladyship a visit; and to go to Twickenham would be a\r\nformidable journey to an infirm old lady, who seldom stirred out of her\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nWhatever displeasure Lady Delacour felt towards her friend Belinda,\r\non account of her coldness to Mr. Hervey, and her steadiness to Mr.\r\nVincent, had by this time subsided. Angry people, who express their\r\npassion, as it has been justly said, always speak worse than they think.\r\nThis was usually the case with her ladyship.\r\n\r\nThe morning after they arrived in town, she came into Belinda\'s room,\r\nwith an air of more than usual sprightliness and satisfaction. "Great\r\nnews!--Great news!--Extraordinary news!--But it is very imprudent\r\nto excite your expectations, my dear Belinda. Pray, did you hear a\r\nwonderful noise in the square a little while ago?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I thought I heard a great bustle; but Marriott appeased my\r\ncuriosity, by saying that it was only a battle between two dogs."\r\n\r\n"It is well if this battle between two dogs do not end in a duel between\r\ntwo men," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"This prospect of mischief seems to have put your ladyship in\r\nwonderfully good spirits," said Belinda, smiling.\r\n\r\n"But what do you think I have heard of Mr. Vincent?" continued Lady\r\nDelacour: "that Miss Annabella Luttridge is dying for love of him--or\r\nof his fortune. Knowing, as I do, the vanity of mankind, I suppose that\r\nyour Mr. Vincent, all perfect as he is, was flattered by the little\r\ncoquette; and perhaps he condescends to repay her in the same coin. I\r\ntake it for granted--for I always fill up the gaps in a story my own\r\nway--I take it for granted that Mr. Vincent got into some entanglement\r\nwith her, and that this has been the cause of the quarrel with the aunt.\r\nThat there has been a quarrel is certain, for your friend Juba told\r\nMarriott so. His massa swore that he would never go to Mrs. Luttridge\'s\r\nagain; and this morning he took the decisive measure of sending to\r\nrequest that his dog might be returned. Juba went for his namesake. Miss\r\nAnnabella Luttridge was the person who delivered up the dog; and she\r\ndesired the black to tell his master, with her compliments, that Juba\'s\r\ncollar was rather too tight; and she begged that he would not fail to\r\ntake it off as soon as he could. Perhaps, my dear, you are as simple\r\nas the poor negro, and suspect no _finesse_ in this message. Miss\r\nLuttridge, aware that the faithful fellow was too much in your interests\r\nto be either persuaded or bribed to carry a billet-doux from any other\r\nlady to his master, did not dare to trust him upon this occasion; but\r\nshe had the art to make him carry her letter without his knowing it.\r\n_Colin maillard_, vulgarly called _blind man\'s buff_, was, some time\r\nago, a favourite play amongst the Parisian ladies: now _hide and seek_\r\nwill be brought into fashion, I suppose, by the fair Annabella. Judge\r\nof her talents for the game by this instance:--she hid her billet-doux\r\nwithin the lining of Juba\'s collar. The dog, unconscious of his dignity\r\nas an ambassador, or rather as a charge d\'affaires, set out on his\r\nway home. As he was crossing Berkeley-square he was met by Sir Philip\r\nBaddely and his dog. The baronet\'s insolent favourite bit the black\'s\r\nheels. Juba, the dog, resented the injury immediately, and a furious\r\ncombat ensued. In the height of the battle Juba\'s collar fell off. Sir\r\nPhilip Baddely espied the paper that was sewed to the lining, and seized\r\nupon it immediately: the negro caught hold of it at the same instant:\r\nthe baronet swore; the black struggled: the baronet knocked him down.\r\nThe great dog left his canine antagonist that moment, flew at your\r\nbaronet, and would have eaten him up at three mouthfuls, if Sir Philip\r\nhad not made good his retreat to Dangerfield\'s circulating library. The\r\nnegro\'s head was terribly cut by the sharp point of a stone, and his\r\nankle was sprained; but, as he has just told me, he did not feel this\r\ntill afterward. He started up, and pursued his master\'s enemy. Sir\r\nPhilip was actually reading Miss Luttridge\'s billet-doux aloud when the\r\nblack entered the library. He reclaimed his master\'s property with great\r\nintrepidity; and a gentleman who was present took his part immediately.\r\n\r\n"In the mean time, Lord Delacour, who had been looking at the battle\r\nfrom our breakfast-room window, determined to go over to Dangerfield\'s,\r\nto see what was the matter, and how all this would end. He entered the\r\nlibrary just as the gentleman who had volunteered in favour of poor Juba\r\nwas disputing with Sir Philip. The bleeding negro told my lord, in as\r\nplain words as he could, the cause of the dispute; and Lord Delacour,\r\nwho, to do him justice, is a man of honour, joined instantly in his\r\ndefence. The baronet thought proper at length to submit; and he left\r\nthe field of battle, without having any thing to say for himself\r\nbut--\'Damme!--very extraordinary, damme!\'--_or words to that effect_.\r\n\r\n"Now, Lord Delacour, besides being a man of honour, is also a man of\r\nhumanity. I know that I cannot oblige you more, my dear Belinda, than\r\nby seasoning my discourse with a little conjugal flattery. My lord\r\nwas concerned to see the poor black writhing in pain; and with the\r\nassistance of the gentleman who had joined in his defence, he brought\r\nJuba across the square to our house. Guess for what:--to try upon the\r\nstrained ankle an infallible quack balsam recommended to him by the\r\nDowager Lady Boucher. I was in the hall when they brought the poor\r\nfellow in: Marriott was called. \'Mrs. Marriott,\' cried my lord, \'pray\r\nlet us have Lady Boucher\'s infallible balsam--this instant!\' Had you but\r\nseen the eagerness of face, or heard the emphasis, with which he said\r\n\'_infallible_ balsam\'--you must let me laugh at the recollection. One\r\nhuman smile must pass, and be forgiven."\r\n\r\n"The smile may be the more readily forgiven," said Belinda, "since I am\r\nsure you are conscious that it reflected almost as much upon yourself as\r\nupon Lord Delacour."\r\n\r\n"Why, yes; belief in a quack doctor is full as bad as belief in a quack\r\nbalsam, I allow. Your observation is so malicious, because so just, that\r\nto punish you for it, I will not tell you the remainder of my story for\r\na week to come; and I assure you that the best part of it I have left\r\nuntold. To return to our friend Mr. Vincent:--could you but know what\r\nreasons I have, at this instant, for wishing him in Jamaica, you would\r\nacknowledge that I am truly candid in confessing that I believe\r\nmy suspicions about E O were unfounded; and I am truly generous in\r\nadmitting that you are right to treat him with justice."\r\n\r\nThis last enigmatical sentence Belinda could not prevail upon Lady\r\nDelacour to explain.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mr. Vincent made his appearance. Lady Delacour\r\nimmediately attacked him with raillery, on the subject of the fair\r\nAnnabella. He was rejoiced to perceive that her suspicions took this\r\nturn, and that nothing relative to the transaction in which Clarence\r\nHervey had been engaged had transpired. Vincent wavered in his\r\nresolution to confess the truth to Belinda. Though he had determined\r\nupon this in the first moment of joyful enthusiasm, yet the delay of\r\nfour-and-twenty hours had made a material change in his feelings; his\r\nmost virtuous resolves were always rather the effect of sudden impulse\r\nthan of steady principle. But when the tide of passion had swept away\r\nthe landmarks, he had no method of ascertaining the boundaries of right\r\nand wrong. Upon the present occasion his love for Belinda confounded\r\nall his moral calculations: one moment, his feelings as a man of honour\r\nforbade him to condescend to the meanness of dissimulation; but the\r\nnext instant his feelings as a lover prevailed; and he satisfied his\r\nconscience by the idea that, as his vow must preclude all danger of\r\nhis return to the gaming-table in future, it would only be creating\r\nan unnecessary alarm in Belinda\'s mind to speak to her of his past\r\nimprudence. His generosity at first revolted from the thought of\r\nsuppressing those praises of Clarence Hervey, which had been so well\r\ndeserved; but his jealousy returned, to combat his first virtuous\r\nimpulse. He considered that his own inferiority must by comparison\r\nappear more striking to his mistress; and he sophistically persuaded\r\nhimself that it would be for her happiness to conceal the merits of a\r\nrival, to whom she could never be united. In this vacillating state of\r\nmind he continued during the greatest part of the evening. About half an\r\nhour before he took his leave, Lady Delacour was called out of the room\r\nby Mrs. Marriott. Left alone with Belinda, his embarrassment increased,\r\nand the unsuspecting kindness of her manner was to him the most bitter\r\nreproach. He stood in silent agony whilst in a playful tone she smiled\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n"Where are your thoughts, Mr. Vincent? If I were of a jealous temper, I\r\nshould say with the fair Annabella--"\r\n\r\n"You would say wrong, then," replied Mr. Vincent, in a constrained\r\nvoice. He was upon the point of telling the truth; but to gain a\r\nreprieve of a few minutes, he entered into a defence of his conduct\r\ntowards Miss Luttridge.\r\n\r\nThe sudden return of Lady Delacour relieved him from his embarrassment,\r\nand they conversed only on general subjects during the remainder of the\r\nevening; and he at last departed, secretly rejoicing that he was, as\r\nhe fancied, under the necessity of postponing his explanation; he\r\neven thought of suppressing the history of his transaction with Mrs.\r\nLuttridge. He knew that his secret was safe with Clarence Hervey: Mrs.\r\nLuttridge would be silent for her own sake; and neither Lady Delacour\r\nnor Belinda had any connexion with her society.\r\n\r\nA few days afterward, Mr. Vincent went to Gray, the jeweller, for some\r\ntrinkets which he had bespoken. Lord Delacour was there, speaking about\r\nthe diamond ring, which Gray had promised to dispose of for him. Whilst\r\nhis lordship and Mr. Vincent were busy about their own affairs, Sir\r\nPhilip Baddely and Mr. Rochfort came into the shop. Sir Philip and Mr.\r\nVincent had never before met. Lord Delacour, to prevent him from getting\r\ninto a quarrel about a lady who was so little worth fighting for as Miss\r\nAnnabella Luttridge, had positively refused to tell Mr. Vincent what he\r\nknew of the affair, or to let him know the name of the gentleman who was\r\nconcerned in it.\r\n\r\nThe shopman addressed Mr. Vincent by his name, and immediately Sir\r\nPhilip whispered to Rochfort, that Mr. Vincent was "_the master of the\r\nblack_." Vincent, who unluckily overheard him, instantly asked Lord\r\nDelacour if that was the gentleman who had behaved so ill to his\r\nservant? Lord Delacour told him that it was now of no consequence to\r\ninquire. "If," said his lordship, "either of these gentlemen choose to\r\naccost you, I shall think you do rightly to retort; but for Heaven\'s\r\nsake do not begin the attack!"\r\n\r\nVincent\'s impetuosity was not to be restrained; he demanded from Sir\r\nPhilip, whether he was the person who had beaten his servant? Sir\r\nPhilip readily obliged him with an answer in the affirmative; and the\r\nconsequence was the loss of a finger to the baronet, and a wound in the\r\nside to Mr. Vincent, which, though it did not endanger his life, yet\r\nconfined him to his room for several days. The impatience of his mind\r\nincreased his fever, and retarded his recovery.\r\n\r\nWhen Belinda\'s first alarm for Mr. Vincent\'s safety was over, she\r\nanxiously questioned Lord Delacour as to the particulars of all that had\r\npassed between Mr. Vincent and Sir Philip, that she might judge of the\r\nmanner in which her lover had conducted himself. Lord Delacour, who was\r\na man of strict truth, was compelled to confess that Mr. Vincent had\r\nshown more spirit than temper, and more courage than prudence. Lady\r\nDelacour rejoiced to perceive that this account made Belinda uncommonly\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent now thought himself sufficiently recovered to leave his\r\nroom; his physicians, indeed, would have kept him prisoner a few\r\ndays longer, but he was too impatient of restraint to listen to their\r\ncounsels.\r\n\r\n"Juba, tell the doctor, when he comes, that you could not keep me at\r\nhome; and that is all that is necessary to be said."\r\n\r\nHe had now summoned courage to acknowledge to Belinda all that had\r\nhappened, and was proceeding, with difficulty, down stairs, when he was\r\nsuddenly struck by the sound of a voice which he little expected at this\r\nmoment; a voice he had formerly been accustomed to hear with pleasure,\r\nbut now it smote him to the heart:--it was the voice of Mr. Percival.\r\nFor the first time in his life, he wished to deny himself to his friend.\r\nThe recollection of the E O table, of Mrs. Luttridge, of Mr. Percival as\r\nhis guardian, and of all the advice he had heard from him as his friend,\r\nrushed upon his mind at this instant; conscious and ashamed, he shrunk\r\nback, precipitately returned to his own room, and threw himself into\r\na chair, breathless with agitation. He listened, expecting to hear Mr.\r\nPercival coming up stairs, and endeavoured to compose himself, that\r\nhe might not betray, by his own agitation, all that he wished most\r\nanxiously to conceal. After waiting for some time, he rang the bell, to\r\nmake inquiries. The waiter told him that a Mr. Percival had asked for\r\nhim; but, having been told by his black that he was just gone out,\r\nthe gentleman being, as he said, much hurried, had left a note; for an\r\nanswer to which he would call at eight o\'clock in the evening. Vincent\r\nwas glad of this short reprieve. "Alas!" thought he, "how changed am\r\nI, when I fear to meet my best friend! To what has this one fatal\r\npropensity reduced me!"\r\n\r\nHe was little aware of the new difficulties that awaited him.\r\n\r\nMr. Percival\'s note was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n"My dear _friend_!\r\n\r\n"Am not I a happy man, to find a friend in my ci-devant ward? But I have\r\nno time for sentiment; nor does it become the character, in which I am\r\nnow writing to you--that of a DUN. You are so rich, and so prudent, that\r\nthe word in capital letters cannot frighten you. Lady Anne\'s cousin,\r\npoor Mr. Carysfort, is dead. I am guardian to his boys; they are but ill\r\nprovided for. I have fortunately obtained a partnership in a good house\r\nfor the second son. Ten thousand pounds are wanting to establish him--we\r\ncannot raise the money amongst us, without dunning poor Mr. Vincent.\r\nEnclosed is your bond for the purchase-money of the little estate you\r\nbought from me last summer. I know that you have double the sum we want\r\nin ready money--so I make no ceremony. Let me have the ten thousand this\r\nevening, if you can, as I wish to leave town as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n"Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n"HENRY PERCIVAL."\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Vincent had lost, and had actually paid to Mrs. Luttridge,\r\nthe ready money which had been destined to discharge his debt to Mr.\r\nPercival: he expected fresh remittances from the West Indies in the\r\ncourse of a few weeks; but, in the mean time, he must raise this\r\nmoney immediately: this he could only do by having recourse to Jews--a\r\ndesperate expedient. The Jew, to whom he applied, no sooner discovered\r\nthat Mr. Vincent was under a necessity of having this sum before eight\r\no\'clock in the evening than he became exorbitant in his demands; and the\r\nmore impatient this unfortunate young man became, the more difficulties\r\nhe raised. At last, a bargain was concluded between them, in which\r\nVincent knew that he was grossly imposed upon; but to this he submitted,\r\nfor he had no alternative. The Jew promised to bring him ten thousand\r\npounds at five o\'clock in the evening, but it was half after seven\r\nbefore he made his appearance; and then he was so dilatory and\r\ncircumspect, in reading over and signing the bonds, and in completing\r\nthe formalities of the transaction, that before the money was actually\r\nin Vincent\'s possession, one of the waiters of the hotel knocked at the\r\ndoor to let him know that Mr. Percival was coming up stairs. Vincent\r\nhurried the Jew into an adjoining apartment, and bid him wait there,\r\ntill he should come to finish the business. Though totally unsuspicious,\r\nMr. Percival could not help being struck with the perturbation in which\r\nhe found his young friend. Vincent immediately began to talk of the\r\nduel, and his friend was led to conclude that his anxiety arose\r\nfrom this affair. He endeavoured to put him at ease by changing the\r\nconversation. He spoke of the business which brought him to town, and of\r\nthe young man whom he was going to place with a banker. "I hope," said\r\nhe, observing that Vincent grew more embarrassed, "that my _dunning_ you\r\nfor this money is not really inconvenient."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least--not in the least. I have the money ready--in a few\r\nmoments--if you\'ll be so good as to wait here--I have the money ready in\r\nthe next room."\r\n\r\nAt this instant a loud noise was heard--the raised voices of two people\r\nquarrelling. It was Juba, the black, and Solomon, the Jew. Mr. Vincent\r\nhad sent Juba out of the way, on some errand, whilst he had been\r\ntransacting his affairs with the Jew; but the black, having executed\r\nthe commission on which he had been sent, returned, and went into his\r\nmaster\'s bedchamber, to read at his leisure a letter which he had just\r\nreceived from his wife. He did not at first see the Jew, and he was\r\nspelling out the words of his wife\'s letter.\r\n\r\n"My dear Juba,\r\n\r\n"I take this op-por-tu--" --_nity_ he would have said; but the Jew,\r\nwho had held his breath in to avoid discovery, till he could hold it no\r\nlonger, now drew it so loud, that Juba started, looked round, and saw\r\nthe feet of a man, which appeared beneath the bottom of the window\r\ncurtain. Where fears of supernatural appearances were out of the\r\nquestion, our negro was a man of courage; he had no doubt that the man\r\nwho was concealed behind the curtain was a robber, but the idea of a\r\nrobber did not unnerve him like that of an Obeah woman. With presence\r\nof mind worthy of a greater danger, Juba took down his master\'s pistol,\r\nwhich hung over the chimney-piece, and marching deliberately up to the\r\nenemy, he seized the Jew by the throat, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n"You rob my massa?--You dead man, if you rob my massa."\r\n\r\nTerrified at the sight of the pistol, the Jew instantly explained who\r\nhe was, and producing his large purse, assured Juba that he was come to\r\nlend money, and not to take it from his master; but this appeared highly\r\nimprobable to Juba, who believed his master to be the richest man in the\r\nworld; besides, the Jew\'s language was scarcely intelligible to him, and\r\nhe saw secret terror in Solomon\'s countenance. Solomon had an antipathy\r\nto the sight of a black, and he shrunk from the negro with strong signs\r\nof aversion. Juba would not relinquish his hold; each went on talking\r\nin his own angry gibberish as loud as he could, till at last the negro\r\nfairly dragged the Jew into the presence of his master and Mr. Percival.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe Mr. Vincent\'s confusion, or Mr. Percival\'s\r\nastonishment. The Jew\'s explanation was perfectly intelligible to him;\r\nhe saw at once all the truth. Vincent, overwhelmed with shame, stood the\r\npicture of despair, incapable of uttering a single syllable.\r\n\r\n"There is no necessity to borrow this money on my account," said Mr.\r\nPercival, calmly; "and if there were, we could probably have it on more\r\nreasonable terms than this gentleman proposes."\r\n\r\n"I care not on what terms I have it--I care not what becomes of me--I am\r\nundone!" cried Vincent.\r\n\r\nMr. Percival coolly dismissed the Jew, made a sign to Juba to leave the\r\nroom, and then, addressing himself to Vincent, said, "I can borrow the\r\nmoney that I want elsewhere. Fear no reproaches from me--I foresaw all\r\nthis--you have lost this sum at play: it is well that it was not your\r\nwhole fortune. I have only one question to ask you, on which depends my\r\nesteem--have you informed Miss Portman of this affair?"\r\n\r\n"I have not yet told her, but I was actually half down stairs in my way\r\nto tell her."\r\n\r\n"Then, Mr. Vincent, you are still my friend. I know the difficulty of\r\nsuch an avowal--but it is necessary."\r\n\r\n"Cannot you, dear Mr. Percival, save me the intolerable shame of\r\nconfessing my own folly? Spare me this mortification! Be yourself the\r\nbearer of this intelligence, and the mediator in my favour."\r\n\r\n"I will with pleasure," said Mr. Percival; "I will go this instant: but\r\nI cannot say that I have any hope of persuading Belinda to believe in\r\nyour being irrevocably reclaimed from the charms of play."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, my excellent friend, she may rely upon me: I feel such horror\r\nat the past, such heartfelt resolution against all future temptation,\r\nthat you may pledge yourself for my total reformation."\r\n\r\nMr. Percival promised that he would exert all his influence, except by\r\npledging his own honour; to this he could not consent. "If I have any\r\ngood news for you, I will return as soon as possible; but I will not\r\nbe the bearer of any painful intelligence," said he; and he departed,\r\nleaving Mr. Vincent in a state of anxiety, which, to his temper, was a\r\npunishment sufficient for almost any imprudence he could have committed.\r\n\r\nMr. Percival returned no more that night. The next morning Mr. Vincent\r\nreceived the following letter from Belinda. He guessed his fate: he had\r\nscarcely power to read the words.\r\n\r\n"I promised you that, whenever my own mind should be decided, I would\r\nnot hold yours in suspense; yet at this moment I find it difficult to\r\nkeep my word.\r\n\r\n"Instead of lamenting, as you have often done, that my esteem for your\r\nmany excellent qualities never rose beyond the bounds of friendship, we\r\nhave now reason to rejoice at this, since it will save us much useless\r\npain. It spares me the difficulty of conquering a passion that might\r\nbe fatal to my happiness; and it will diminish the regret which you may\r\nfeel at our separation. I am now obliged to say, that circumstances have\r\nmade me certain we could not add to our mutual felicity by any nearer\r\nconnexion.\r\n\r\n"The hope of enjoying domestic happiness with a person whose manners,\r\ntemper, and tastes suited my own, inclined me to listen to your\r\naddresses. But this happiness I could never enjoy with one who has any\r\npropensity to the love of play.\r\n\r\n"For my own sake, as well as for yours, I rejoice that your fortune has\r\nnot been materially injured; as this relieves me from the fear that my\r\npresent conduct should be imputed to interested motives. Indeed, such\r\nis the generosity of your own temper, that in any situation I should\r\nscarcely have reason to apprehend from you such a suspicion.\r\n\r\n"The absolute impossibility of my forming at present a connexion with\r\nanother, will prevent you from imagining that I am secretly influenced\r\nby sentiments different from those which I avow; nor can any weak doubts\r\non this subject expose me to my own reproaches.\r\n\r\n"You perceive, sir, that I am not willing utterly to lose your esteem,\r\neven when I renounce, in the most unequivocal manner, all claim upon\r\nyour affections. If any thing should appear to you harsh in this letter,\r\nI beg you to impute it to the real cause--my desire to spare you all\r\npainful suspense, by convincing you at once that my determination is\r\nirrevocable. With sincere wishes for your happiness, I bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n"BELINDA PORTMAN."\r\n\r\n\r\nA few hours after Mr. Vincent had read this letter he threw himself into\r\na post-chaise, and set out for Germany. He saw that all hopes of being\r\nunited to Belinda were over, and he hurried as far from her as possible.\r\nHer letter rather soothed than irritated his temper; her praises of his\r\ngenerosity were highly gratifying, and they had so powerful an effect\r\nupon his mind, that he was determined to prove that they were deserved.\r\nHis conscience reproached him with not having made sufficiently\r\nhonourable mention of Clarence Hervey\'s conduct, on the night when he\r\nwas on the point of destroying himself. Before he left London he wrote\r\na full account of this whole transaction, to be given to Miss Portman\r\nafter his departure.\r\n\r\nBelinda was deeply touched by this proof of his generosity. His\r\nletter--his farewell letter--she could not read without great emotion.\r\nIt was written with true feeling, but in a manly style, without one word\r\nof vain lamentation.\r\n\r\n"What a pity," thought Belinda, "that with so many good and great\r\nqualities, I should be forced to bid him adieu for ever!"\r\n\r\nThough she strongly felt the pain of this separation, yet she could not\r\nrecede from her decision: nothing could tempt her to connect herself\r\nwith a man who had the fatal taste for play. Even Mr. Percival, much as\r\nhe loved his ward, much as he wished for his union with Belinda, dared\r\nnot pledge his honour for Mr. Vincent on this point.\r\n\r\nLady Anne Percival, in a very kind and sensible letter, expressed the\r\nhighest approbation of Belinda\'s conduct; and the most sincere hope that\r\nBelinda would still continue to think of her with affection and esteem,\r\nthough she had been so rash in her advice, and though her friendship had\r\nbeen apparently so selfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nNEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Do not expect that I should pretend to be sorry for Mr. Vincent," said\r\nLady Delacour. "Let him be as generous and as penitent as he pleases,\r\nI am heartily glad that he is on his way to Germany. I dare say he will\r\nfind in the upper or _lower_ circles of the empire some heroine in\r\nthe Kotzebue taste, who will alternately make him miserable till he\r\nis happy, and happy till he is miserable. He is one of those men who\r\nrequire great emotions: fine lovers these make for stage effect--but the\r\nworst husbands in the world!\r\n\r\n"I hope, Belinda, you give me credit, for having judged better of Mr.\r\nVincent than Lady Anne Percival did?"\r\n\r\n"For having judged worse of him, you mean? Lady Anne always judges _as\r\nwell_ as possible of every body."\r\n\r\n"I will allow you to play upon words in a friend\'s defence, but do not\r\nbe alarmed for the reputation of Lady Anne\'s judgment. If it will be\r\nany satisfaction to you, I can with thorough sincerity assure you that\r\nI never liked her so well in my life as since I have detected her in\r\na mistake. It saves her, in my imagination, from the odium of being a\r\nperfect character."\r\n\r\n"And there was something so handsome in her manner of writing to me,\r\nwhen she found out her error," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Very true, and my friend Mr. Percival behaved handsomely. Where\r\nfriendships clash, it is not every man who has clearness of head\r\nsufficient to know his duty to his neighbour. Mr. Percival said no\r\nmore than just the thing he ought, for his ward. You have reason to be\r\nobliged to him: and as we are returning thanks to all persons concerned\r\nin our deliverance from this imminent danger, Juba, the dog, and Juba,\r\nthe black, and Solomon, the Jew, ought to come in for their share; for\r\nwithout that wrestling match of theirs, the truth might never have been\r\ndragged to light, and Mr. Vincent would have been in due course of\r\ntime your lord and master. But the danger is over; you need not look\r\nso terrified: do not be like the man who dropped down dead with terror,\r\nwhen he was shown by daylight the broken bridge which he had galloped\r\nover in the dark."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour was in such high spirits that, without regard to\r\nconnexion, she ran on from one subject to another.\r\n\r\n"You have proved to me, my dear," said she, "that you are not a girl to\r\nmarry, because the day was fixed, or because _things had gone so far_.\r\nI give you infinite credit for your _civil courage_, as Dr. X---- calls\r\nit: military courage, as he said to me yesterday--military courage, that\r\nseeks the bubble reputation even in the cannon\'s mouth, may be had\r\nfor sixpence a day. But civil courage, such as enabled the Princess\r\nParizade, in the Arabian Tales, to go straight up the hill to her\r\nobject, though the magical multitude of advising and abusive voices\r\ncontinually called to her to turn back, is one of the rarest qualities\r\nin man or woman, and not to be had for love, money, or admiration."\r\n\r\n"You place admiration not only above money, but above love, in your\r\nclimax, I perceive," said Belinda, smiling.\r\n\r\n"I will give you leave to be as philosophically sarcastic as you please,\r\nmy dear, if you will only smile, and if you will not look as pale as\r\nSeneca\'s Paulina, whose story we heard--from whom?"\r\n\r\n"From Mr. Hervey, I believe."\r\n\r\n"His name was ready upon your lips; I hope he was not far from your\r\nthoughts?"\r\n\r\n"No one could be farther from my thoughts," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Well, very likely--I believe it, because you say it; and because it is\r\nimpossible."\r\n\r\n"Rally me as much as you please, my dear Lady Delacour, I assure you\r\nthat I speak the simple truth."\r\n\r\n"I cannot suspect you of affectation, my dear. Therefore honestly tell\r\nme, if Clarence Hervey were at your feet this instant, would you spurn\r\nhim from you?"\r\n\r\n"Spurn him! no--I would neither spurn him, nor _motion him from me_; but\r\nwithout using any of the terms in the heroine\'s dictionary----"\r\n\r\n"You would refuse him?" interrupted Lady Delacour, with a look of\r\nindignation--"you would refuse him?"\r\n\r\n"I did not say so, I _believe_."\r\n\r\n"You would accept him?"\r\n\r\n"I did not say so, _I am sure_."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you would tell him that you were not _accustomed_ to him?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly in those words, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Well, we shall not quarrel about words," said Lady Delacour; "I only\r\nbeg you to remember your own principles; and if ever you are put to\r\nthe trial, be consistent. The first thing in a philosopher is to be\r\nconsistent."\r\n\r\n"Fortunately, for the credit of my philosophy, there is no immediate\r\ndanger of its being put to the test."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, you surely mean; unless you are afraid that it might not\r\nstand the test. But I was going, when I spoke of consistency, to remind\r\nyou that all your own and Mr. Percival\'s arguments about _first loves_\r\nmay now, with equal propriety, be turned against you."\r\n\r\n"How _against_ me?"\r\n\r\n"They are evidently as applicable to second as to first loves, I think."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they are," said Belinda; "but I really and truly am not\r\ninclined to think of love at present; particularly as there is no\r\nnecessity that I should."\r\n\r\nBelinda took up a book, and Lady Delacour for one half hour abstained\r\nfrom any farther raillery. But longer than half an hour she could not be\r\nsilent on the subject uppermost in her thoughts.\r\n\r\n"If Clarence Hervey," cried she, "were not the most honourable of\r\nblockheads, he might be the most happy of men. This Virginia!--oh, how I\r\nhate her!--I am sure poor Clarence cannot love her."\r\n\r\n"Because you hate her--or because you hate her without having ever seen\r\nher?" said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know what she must be," replied Lady Delacour: "a soft, sighing,\r\ndying damsel, who puts bullfinches into her bosom. Smile, smile, my\r\ndear; you cannot help it; in spite of all your generosity, I know you\r\nmust think as I do, and wish as I do, that she were at the bottom of the\r\nBlack Sea this instant."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour stood for some minutes musing, and then exclaimed, "I will\r\nmove heaven and earth to break off this absurd match."\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens! my dear Lady Delacour, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Mean! my dear--I mean what I say, which very few people do: no wonder I\r\nshould surprise you."\r\n\r\n"I conjure you," cried Belinda, "if you have the least regard for my\r\nhonour and happiness--"\r\n\r\n"I have not the least, but the greatest; and depend upon it, my dear, I\r\nwill do nothing that shall injure that _dignity of mind and delicacy of\r\ncharacter_, which I admire and love, as much as Clarence Hervey did, and\r\ndoes. Trust to me: not Lady Anne Percival herself can be more delicate\r\nin her notions of propriety than I am for my friends, and, since\r\nmy reformation, I hope I may add, for myself. Fear nothing." As she\r\nfinished these words, she rang for her carriage. "I don\'t ask you to go\r\nout with me, my dear Belinda; I give you leave to sit in this armchair\r\ntill I come back again, with your feet upon the fender, a book in\r\nyour hand, and this little table beside you, like Lady S.\'s picture of\r\nComfort."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour spent the rest of the morning abroad; and when she\r\nreturned home, she gave no account of what she had been doing, or of\r\nwhat or whom she had seen. This was so unusual, that Belinda could not\r\navoid taking notice of it. Notwithstanding her ladyship\'s eulogium upon\r\nher own delicate sense of propriety, Miss Portman could not confide,\r\nwith perfect resignation, in her prudence.\r\n\r\n"Your ladyship reproached me once," said she, in a playful tone, "for\r\nmy provoking want of curiosity: you have completely cured me of this\r\ndefect, for never was woman more curious than I am, at this instant, to\r\nknow the secret scheme that you have in agitation."\r\n\r\n"Have patience a little longer, and the mystery will be unravelled. In\r\nthe mean time, trust that every thing I do is for the best. However, as\r\nyou have behaved pretty well, I will give you one leading hint, when you\r\nhave explained to me what you meant by saying that your heart is not at\r\npresent inclined to love. Pray, have you quarrelled with love for ever?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I can exist without it."\r\n\r\n"Have you a heart?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"And it can exist without love? I now understand what was once said to\r\nme by a foolish lordling:--\' Of what use is the sun to the dial?\'" [10]\r\n\r\nCompany came in, and relieved Belinda from any further raillery. Lady\r\nBoucher and Mrs. Margaret Delacour were, amongst a large party, to dine\r\nat Lady Delacour\'s. At dinner, the dowager seized the first auspicious\r\nmoment of silence to announce a piece of intelligence, which she\r\nflattered herself would fix the eyes of all the world upon her.\r\n\r\n"So Mr. Clarence Hervey is married at last!"\r\n\r\n"Married!" cried Lady Delacour: she had sufficient presence of mind\r\nnot to look directly at Belinda; but she fixed the dowager\'s eyes, by\r\nrepeating, "Married! Are you sure of it?"\r\n\r\n"Positive--positive! He was privately married yesterday at his aunt,\r\nLady Almeria\'s apartments, at Windsor, to Miss Hartley. I told you it\r\nwas to be, and now it is over; and a very extraordinary match Mr. Hervey\r\nhas made of it, after all. Think of his going at last, and marrying a\r\ngirl who has been his mistress for years! Nobody will visit her, to be\r\nsure. Lady Almeria is excessively distressed; she did all she could to\r\nprevail on her brother, the bishop, to marry his nephew, but he very\r\nproperly refused, giving it as a reason, that the girl\'s character was\r\ntoo well known."\r\n\r\n"I thought the bishop was at Spa," interposed a gentleman, whilst the\r\ndowager drew breath.\r\n\r\n"O dear, no, sir; you have been misinformed," resumed she. "The bishop\r\nhas been returned from Spa this great while, and he has refused to see\r\nhis nephew, to my certain knowledge. After all, I cannot but pity poor\r\nClarence for being driven into this match. Mr. Hartley has a prodigious\r\nfine fortune, to be sure, and he hurried things forward at an amazing\r\nrate, to patch up his daughter\'s reputation. He said, as I am credibly\r\ninformed, yesterday morning, that if Clarence did not marry the girl\r\nbefore night, he would carry her and her fortune off the next day to the\r\nWest Indies. Now the fortune was certainly an object."\r\n\r\n"My dear Lady Boucher," interrupted Lord Delacour, "you must be\r\nmisinformed in that particular: fortune is no object to Clarence\r\nHervey; he is too generous a fellow to marry for fortune. What do you\r\nthink--what do you say, Lady Delacour?"\r\n\r\n"I say, and think, and feel, as you do, my lord," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"You say, and think, and feel the same as my lord.--Very extraordinary\r\nindeed!" said the dowager. "Then if it were not for the sake of the\r\nfortune, pray why did Mr. Hervey marry at all? Can any body guess?"\r\n\r\n"I should guess because he was in love," said Lord Delacour "for I\r\nremember that was the reason I married myself."\r\n\r\n"My dear good lord--but when I tell you the girl had been his mistress,\r\ntill he was tired of her--"\r\n\r\n"My Lady Boucher," said Mrs. Margaret Delacour, who had hitherto\r\nlistened in silence, "my Lady Boucher, you have been misinformed; Miss\r\nHartley never was Clarence Hervey\'s mistress."\r\n\r\n"I\'m mighty glad you think so, Mrs. Delacour; but I assure you nobody\r\nelse is so _charitable_. Those who live in the world hear a great deal\r\nmore than those who live out of the world. I can promise you, nobody\r\nwill visit the bride, and that is the thing by which we are to judge."\r\n\r\nThen the dowager and the rest of the company continued to descant upon\r\nthe folly of the match. Those who wished to pay their court to Lady\r\nDelacour were the loudest in their astonishment at his throwing himself\r\naway in this manner. Her ladyship smiled, and kept them in play by her\r\naddress, on purpose to withdraw all eyes from Miss Portman, whilst,\r\nfrom time to time, she stole a glance at Belinda, to observe how she was\r\naffected by what passed: she was provoked by Belinda\'s self-possession.\r\nAt last, when it had been settled that all the Herveys were _odd_, but\r\nthat this match of Clarence\'s was the _oddest_ of all the odd things\r\nthat any of the family had done for many generations, Mrs. Delacour\r\ncalmly said, "Are you sure, Lady Boucher, that Mr. Hervey is married?"\r\n\r\n"Positive! as I said before, positive! Madam, my woman had it from Lady\r\nNewland\'s Swiss, who had it from Lady Singleton\'s Frenchwoman, who had\r\nit from Longueville, the hairdresser, who had it from Lady Almeria\'s own\r\nwoman, who was present at the ceremony, and must know if any body does."\r\n\r\n"The report has come to us zigzag as quick as lightning, yet it does not\r\nflash conviction upon me," said Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Nor upon me," said Mrs. Delacour, "for this simple reason. I have seen\r\nMiss Hartley within these two hours, and I had it from herself that she\r\nis not married."\r\n\r\n"Not married!" cried the dowager with terror.\r\n\r\n"I rather think not; she is now with her father, at my house at dinner,\r\nI believe, and Clarence Hervey is at Lady Almeria\'s, at Windsor: her\r\nladyship is confined by a fit of the gout, and sent for her nephew\r\nyesterday. If people who live out of the world hear less, they sometimes\r\nhear more correctly than those who live in it."\r\n\r\n"Pray when does Mr. Hervey return from Windsor?" said the incorrigible\r\ndowager.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, madam," said Mrs. Delacour. "As your ladyship is going to\r\nseveral parties this evening, I think it but _charitable_ to set you\r\nright in these particulars, and I hope you will be so _charitable_ as\r\nto contradict the report of Miss Hartley\'s having been Clarence\'s\r\nmistress."\r\n\r\n"Why, as to that, if the young lady is not married, we must presume\r\nthere are good reasons for it," said the dowager. "Pray, on which side\r\nwas the match broken off?"\r\n\r\n"On neither side," answered Mrs. Delacour.\r\n\r\n"The thing goes on then; and what day is the marriage to take place?"\r\nsaid Lady Boucher.\r\n\r\n"On Monday--or Tuesday--or Wednesday--or Thursday--or Friday--or\r\nSaturday---or Sunday, I believe," replied Mrs. Delacour, who had the\r\nprudent art of giving answers effectually baffling to the curiosity of\r\ngossips.\r\n\r\nThe dowager consoled herself in her utmost need with a full plate of\r\nbrandy peaches, and spoke not a word more during the second course. When\r\nthe ladies retired after the dessert, she again commenced hostilities:\r\nshe dared not come to open war with Mrs. Delacour; but in a bye-battle,\r\nin a corner, she carried every thing before her; and she triumphantly\r\nwhispered, "We shall see, ma\'am, that it will turn out, as I told you,\r\nthat Miss Rachel, or Virginia, or whatever he pleases to call her, has\r\nbeen what I said; and, as I said, nobody will visit her, not a soul:\r\nfifty people I can count who have declared to me they\'ve made up their\r\nminds; and my own\'s made up, I candidly confess; and Lady Delacour, I\r\nam sure by her silence and looks, is of my way of thinking, and has no\r\nopinion of the young lady: as to Miss Portman, she is, poor thing, of\r\ncourse, so wrapped up in her own affairs, no wonder she says nothing.\r\nThat was a sad business of Mr. Vincent\'s! I am surprised to see her look\r\neven so well as she does after it. Mr. Percival, I am told," said the\r\nwell-informed dowager, lowering her voice so much that the lovers of\r\nscandal were obliged to close their heads round her--"Mr. Percival, I am\r\ninformed, refused his consent to his ward (who is not of age) on account\r\nof an anonymous letter, and it is supposed Mr. Vincent desired it for\r\nan excuse to get off handsomely. Fighting that duel about her with Sir\r\nPhilip Baddely settled his love--so he is gone to Germany, and she\r\nis left to wear the willow, which, you see, becomes her as well as\r\neverything else. Did she eat any dinner, ma\'am? you sat next her."\r\n\r\n"Yes; more than I did, I am sure."\r\n\r\n"Very extraordinary! Then perhaps Sir Philip Baddely\'s _on_ again--Lord\r\nbless me, what a match would that be for her! Why, Mrs. Stanhope might\r\nthen, indeed, deserve to be called the match-maker general. The seventh\r\nof her nieces this. But look, there\'s Mrs. Delacour leading Miss Portman\r\noff into the trictrac cabinet, with a face full of business--her hand\r\nin hers--Lord, I did not know they were on that footing! I wonder\r\nwhat\'s going forward. Suppose old Hartley was to propose for Miss\r\nPortman--there would be a denouement! and cut his daughter off with a\r\nshilling! Nothing\'s impossible, you know. Did he ever see Miss Portman?\r\nI must go and find out, positively."\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Mrs. Delacour, unconscious of the curiosity she had\r\nexcited, was speaking to Belinda in the trictrac cabinet.\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Portman," said she, "you have a great deal of good-nature,\r\nelse I should not venture to apply to you on the present occasion. Will\r\nyou oblige me, and serve a friend of mine--a gentleman who, as I once\r\nimagined, was an admirer of yours?"\r\n\r\n"I will do any thing in my power to oblige any friend of yours, madam,"\r\nsaid Belinda; "but of whom are you speaking?"\r\n\r\n"Of Mr. Hervey, my dear young lady."\r\n\r\n"Tell me how I can serve him as a friend," said Belinda, colouring\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\n"That you shall know immediately," said Mrs. Delacour, rummaging and\r\nrustling for a considerable time amongst a heap of letters, which she\r\nhad pulled out of the largest pockets that ever woman wore, even in the\r\nlast century.\r\n\r\n"Oh, here it is," continued she, opening and looking into them. "May I\r\ntrouble you just to look over this letter? It is from poor Mr. Hartley;\r\nhe is, as you will see, excessively fond of his daughter, whom he has so\r\nfortunately discovered after his long search: he is dreadfully nervous,\r\nand has been terribly annoyed by these idle gossiping stories. You find,\r\nby what Lady Boucher said at dinner, that they have settled it amongst\r\nthem that Virginia is not a fit person to be visited; that she has been\r\nClarence\'s mistress instead of his pupil. Mr. Hartley, you see by this\r\nletter, is almost out of his senses with the apprehension that his\r\ndaughter\'s reputation is ruined. I sent my carriage to Twickenham, the\r\nmoment I received this letter, for the poor girl and her gouvernante.\r\nThey came to me this morning; but what can I do? I am only one old woman\r\nagainst a confederacy of veteran gossips; but if I could gain you and\r\nLady Delacour for my allies, I should fear no adversaries. Virginia is\r\nto stay with me for some days; and Lady Delacour, I see, has a great\r\nmind to come to see her; but she does not like to come without you, and\r\nshe says that she does not like to ask you to accompany her. I don\'t\r\nunderstand her delicacy about the matter--I have none; believing, as I\r\ndo, that there is no foundation whatever for these malicious reports,\r\nwhich, _entre nous_, originated, I fancy, with Mrs. Marriott. Now,\r\nwill you oblige me? If you and Lady Delacour will come and see Virginia\r\nto-morrow, all the world would follow your example the next day. It\'s\r\noften cowardice that makes people ill-natured: have you the courage,\r\nmy good Miss Portman, to be the first to do a benevolent action? I\r\ndo assure you," continued Mrs. Delacour with great earnestness, "I do\r\nassure you I would as soon put my hand into that fire, this moment,\r\nas ask you to do any thing that I thought improper. But forgive me for\r\npressing this point; I am anxious to have your suffrage in her favour:\r\nMiss Belinda Portman\'s character for prudence and propriety stands so\r\nhigh, and is fixed so firmly, that she may venture to let us cling to\r\nit; and I am as well convinced of the poor girl\'s innocence as I am of\r\nyours; and when you see her, you will be of my opinion."\r\n\r\n"I assure you, Mrs. Delacour," said Belinda, "that you have wasted a\r\ngreat deal of eloquence upon this occasion, for--"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for it," interrupted Mrs. Delacour, rising from her seat,\r\nwith a look of some displeasure. "I meant not to distress or offend you,\r\nMiss Portman, by _my eloquence_: I am only concerned that I should have\r\nso far mistaken your character as to expose myself to this refusal."\r\n\r\n"I have given no refusal," said Belinda, mildly: "you did not let me\r\nfinish my sentence."\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon; that is a foolish old trick of mine."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Delacour, I was going to say, has wasted a great deal of\r\neloquence: for I am entirely of her opinion, and I shall, with the\r\ngreatest readiness, comply with her request."\r\n\r\n"You are a charming, generous girl, and I am a passionate old\r\nfool--thank you a thousand times."\r\n\r\n"You are not at all obliged to me," said Belinda. "When I first heard\r\nthis story, I believed it, as Lady Boucher now does--but I have had\r\nreason to alter my opinion, and perhaps the same means of information\r\nwould have changed hers; once convinced, it is impossible to relapse\r\ninto suspicion."\r\n\r\n"Impossible to _you_: the most truly virtuous women are always the least\r\nsuspicious and uncharitable in their opinion of their own sex. Lady Anne\r\nPercival inspired me with this belief, and Miss Portman confirms it.\r\nI admire your courage in daring to come forward in the defence of\r\ninnocence. I am very rude, alas! for praising you so much."\r\n\r\n"I have not a right to your admiration," said Belinda; "for I must\r\nhonestly confess to you that I should not have this courage if there\r\nwere any danger in the case. I do not think that in doubtful cases it is\r\nthe business of a young woman to hazard her own reputation by an\r\nattempt to preserve another\'s: I do not imagine, at least, that I am of\r\nsufficient consequence in the world for this purpose; therefore I should\r\nnever attempt it. It is the duty of such women as Mrs. Delacour, whose\r\nreputation is beyond the power of scandal, to come forward in the\r\ndefence of injured innocence; but this would not be courage in Belinda\r\nPortman, it would be presumption and temerity."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you will not let me admire your courage, or your generosity,\r\nor your prudence," said Mrs. Delacour laughing, "you must positively\r\nlet me admire _you_ altogether, and love you too, for I cannot help it.\r\nFarewell."\r\n\r\nAfter the company was gone, Lady Delacour was much surprised by the\r\nearnestness with which Belinda pressed the request that they might the\r\nnext morning pay a visit to Virginia.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Lady Delacour, "to tell you the truth, I am full of\r\ncuriosity, and excessively anxious to go. I hesitated merely on your\r\naccount: I fancied that you would not like the visit, and that if I went\r\nwithout you, it might be taken notice of; but I am delighted to find\r\nthat you will come with me: I can only say that you have more generosity\r\nthan I should have in the same situation."\r\n\r\nThe next morning they went together to Mrs. Delacour\'s. In their way\r\nthither, Belinda, to divert her own thoughts, and to rouse Lady Delacour\r\nfrom the profound and unnatural silence into which she had fallen,\r\npetitioned her to finish the history of Sir Philip Baddely, the dog,\r\nMiss Annabella Luttridge, and her billet-doux.\r\n\r\n"For some of my high crimes and misdemeanours, you vowed that you would\r\nnot tell me the remainder of the story till the whole week had elapsed;\r\nnow will you satisfy my curiosity? You recollect that you left off just\r\nwhere you said that you were come to the best part of the story."\r\n\r\n"Was I? did I?--Very true, we shall have time enough to finish it\r\nby-and-by, my dear," said Lady Delacour; "at present my poor head is\r\nrunning upon something else, and I have left off being an accomplished\r\nactress, or I could talk of one subject and think of another as well\r\nas the best of you.--Stop the carriage, my dear; I am afraid they have\r\nforgot my orders."\r\n\r\n"Did you carry what I desired this morning to Mrs. Delacour?" said her\r\nladyship to one of the footmen.\r\n\r\n"I did, my lady."\r\n\r\n"And did you say from me, that it was not to be opened till I came?\'\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lady."\r\n\r\n"Where did you leave it?"\r\n\r\n"In Mrs. Delacour\'s dressing-room, my lady:--she desired me to take it\r\nup there, and she locked the door, and said no one should go in till you\r\ncame."\r\n\r\n"Very well--go on. Belinda, my dear, I hope that I have worked up your\r\ncuriosity to the highest pitch."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE DENOUEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCuriosity was not, at this instant, the strongest passion in Belinda\'s\r\nmind. When the carriage stopped at Mrs. Delacour\'s door, her heart\r\nalmost ceased to beat; but she summoned resolution to go through, with\r\nfirmness and dignity, the task she had undertaken.\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey was not in the room when they entered, nor was Virginia:\r\nMrs. Ormond said that she had been extremely feverish during the night,\r\nand that she had advised her not to get up till late in the day. But\r\nMrs. Delacour immediately went for her, and in a few minutes she made\r\nher appearance.\r\n\r\nBelinda and Lady Delacour exchanged a glance of surprise and admiration.\r\nThere was a grace and simplicity in her manner, joined to an air of\r\nnaivete, that made an irresistible impression in her favour. Lady\r\nDelacour, however, after the first surprise was over, seemed to relapse\r\ninto her former opinion; and the piercing looks which her ladyship from\r\ntime to time cast upon Virginia as she spoke, produced their effect.\r\nShe was abashed and silent. Belinda endeavoured to engage her in\r\nconversation, and to her she talked with ease and even with freedom.\r\nVirginia examined Miss Portman\'s countenance with a species of\r\nartless curiosity and interest, that was not restrained by factitious\r\npoliteness. This examination was not peculiarly agreeable to Belinda,\r\nyet it was made with so much apparent simplicity, that she could not be\r\ndispleased.\r\n\r\nOn the first pause in the conversation, Mrs. Delacour said, "Pray, my\r\ndear Lady Delacour, what is this wonderful present that you sent to me\r\nthis morning, which you desired that no one should see till you came?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot satisfy your curiosity yet," replied Lady Delacour. "I must\r\nwait till Clarence Hervey comes, for the present is intended for him."\r\n\r\nAn air of solemn mystery in her ladyship\'s manner, as she pronounced\r\nthese words, excited general attention. There was a dead silence, which\r\nlasted several minutes: some feeble attempts were then made by each of\r\nthe company to start a fresh subject of conversation; but it would\r\nnot do--all relapsed into the silence of expectation. At last Clarence\r\nHervey arrived. Belinda rejoiced that the universal curiosity which Lady\r\nDelacour had inspired prevented any one\'s observing the sudden change in\r\nMr. Hervey\'s countenance when he beheld her.\r\n\r\n"A pretty set of curious children you are!" cried Lady Delacour,\r\nlaughing. "Do you know, Clarence, that they are all dying with\r\nimpatience to see _un gage d\'amitie_ that I have brought for you; and\r\nthe reason that they are so curious is simply because I had the address\r\nto say, in a solemn voice, \'I cannot satisfy your curiosity till\r\nClarence Hervey arrives.\' Now follow me, my friends; and if you be\r\ndisappointed, lay the blame, not on me, but on your own imaginations."\r\n\r\nShe led the way to Mrs. Delacour\'s dressing-room, and all the company\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n"Now, what do you expect to see?" said she, putting the key into the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting some moments for a reply, but in vain, she threw open\r\nthe door, and they saw, hung before the wall opposite to them, a green\r\ncurtain.\r\n\r\n"I thought, my dear Clarence," resumed Lady Delacour, "that no present\r\ncould be more agreeable to you than a companion for your Virginia. Does\r\nthis figure," continued she, drawing back the curtain, "does this figure\r\ngive you the idea of Paul?"\r\n\r\n"Paul!" said Clarence; "it is a naval officer in full uniform: what can\r\nyour ladyship mean?"\r\n\r\n"Virginia perhaps will know what I mean, if you will only stand out of\r\nher way, and let her see the picture."\r\n\r\nAt these words Clarence made way for Virginia: she turned her eyes upon\r\nthe picture, uttered a piercing shriek, and fell senseless upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n"Take it coolly," said Lady Delacour, "and she will come to her senses\r\npresently. Young ladies must shriek and faint upon certain occasions;\r\nbut men (looking at Clarence Hervey) need not always be dupes. This is\r\nonly a _scene_; consider it as such, and admire the actress as I do."\r\n\r\n"Actress! Oh, she is no actress!" cried Mrs. Ormond.\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey raised her from the ground, and Belinda sprinkled water\r\nover her face.\r\n\r\n"She\'s dead!--she\'s dead! Oh, my sweet child! she\'s dead!" exclaimed\r\nMrs. Ormond, trembling so violently, that she could not sustain\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n"She is no actress, indeed," said Clarence Hervey: "her pulse is gone!"\r\n\r\nLady Delacour looked at Virginia\'s pale lips, touched her cold hands,\r\nand with a look of horror cried out, "Good Heavens! what have I done?\r\nWhat shall we do with her?"\r\n\r\n"Give her air--give her air, air, air!" cried Belinda.\r\n\r\n"You keep the air from her, Mrs. Ormond," said Mrs. Delacour. "Let us\r\nleave her to Miss Portman; she has more presence of mind than any of\r\nus." And as she spoke she forced Mrs. Ormond away with her out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"If Mr. Hartley should come, keep him with you, Mrs. Delacour," said\r\nClarence Hervey. "Is her pulse quite gone?"\r\n\r\n"No; it beats stronger and stronger," said Belinda.\r\n\r\n"Her colour is returning," said Lady Delacour. "There! raise her a\r\nlittle, dear Belinda; she is coming to herself."\r\n\r\n"Had not you better draw the curtain again before that picture," said\r\nMiss Portman, "lest she should see it the moment she opens her eyes?"\r\n\r\nVirginia came slowly to her recollection, saw Lady Delacour drawing the\r\ncurtain before the picture, then fixed her eyes upon Clarence Hervey,\r\nwithout uttering a word.\r\n\r\n"Are you better now?" said he, in a gentle tone.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do not speak--do not look so kindly!" cried Virginia. "I am\r\nwell--quite well--better than I deserve to be;" and she pressed\r\nBelinda\'s hand, as if to thank her for assisting and supporting her.\r\n\r\n"We may safely leave her now," whispered Belinda to Lady Delacour; "we\r\nare strangers, and our presence only distresses her."\r\n\r\nThey withdrew. But the moment Virginia found herself alone with Mr.\r\nHervey, she was seized with a universal tremor; she tried to speak, but\r\ncould not articulate. At last she burst into a flood of tears; and when\r\nthis had in some measure relieved her, she threw herself upon her knees,\r\nand clasping her hands, exclaimed, as she looked up to heaven--\r\n\r\n"Oh, if I knew what I ought to do!--if I knew what I ought to say!"\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you, Virginia? And will you believe me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, yes!"\r\n\r\n"You ought to say--the truth, whatever it may be."\r\n\r\n"But you will think me the most ungrateful of human beings?"\r\n\r\n"How often must I assure you, Virginia, that I make no claim upon your\r\ngratitude? Speak to me--I conjure you, as you value your happiness and\r\nmine--speak to me without disguise! What is all this mystery? Why should\r\nyou fear to let me know what passes in your heart? Why did you shriek at\r\nthe sight of that picture?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, forgive me! forgive me!" cried Virginia: she would have sunk at his\r\nfeet, if he had not prevented her.\r\n\r\n"I will--I can forgive any thing but deceit. Do not look at me with so\r\nmuch terror, Virginia--I have not deserved it: my wish is to make you\r\nhappy. I would sacrifice even my own happiness to secure yours; but\r\ndo not mislead me, or you ruin us both. Cannot you give me a distinct\r\nanswer to this simple question--Why did you shriek at the sight of that\r\npicture?"\r\n\r\n"Because--but you will call me \'_perfidious, ungrateful\r\nVirginia_!\'--because I have seen that figure--he has knelt to me--he has\r\nkissed my hand--and I------"\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey withdrew his arms, which had supported her, and placing\r\nher upon a sofa, left her, whilst he walked up and down the room for\r\nsome minutes in silence.\r\n\r\n"And why, Virginia," said he, stopping short, "was it necessary to\r\nconceal all this from me? Why was it necessary to persuade me that I\r\nwas beloved? Why was it necessary that my happiness should be the\r\nsacrifice?"\r\n\r\n"It shall not!--it shall not! Your happiness shall not be the sacrifice.\r\nHeaven is my witness, that there is no sacrifice I would not make for\r\nyou. Forgive me that shriek! I could not help fainting, indeed! But I\r\nwill be yours--I _ought_ to be yours; and I am not perfidious--I am not\r\nungrateful: do not look upon me as you did in my dream!"\r\n\r\n"Do not talk to me of dreams, my dear Virginia; this is no time for\r\ntrifling; I ask no sacrifice from you--I ask nothing but truth."\r\n\r\n"Truth! Mrs. Ormond knows all the truth: I have concealed nothing from\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"But she has concealed every thing from me," cried Clarence; and, with a\r\nsudden impulse of indignation, he was going to summon her, but when his\r\nhand was upon the lock of the door he paused, returned to Virginia, and\r\nsaid, "Let me hear the truth from _your_ lips: it is all I shall ever\r\nask from you. How--when--where did you see this man?"\r\n\r\n"What man?" said Virginia, looking up, with the simple expression of\r\ninnocence in her countenance.\r\n\r\nClarence pointed to the picture.\r\n\r\n"At the village in the New Forest, at Mrs. Smith\'s house," said\r\nVirginia, "one evening when I walked with her from my grandmother\'s\r\ncottage."\r\n\r\n"And your grandmother knew of this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Virginia, blushing, "and she was very much displeased."\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Ormond knew of this?" pursued Clarence.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but she told me that you would not be displeased at it."\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey made another hasty step toward the door, but restraining\r\nhis impetuous temper, he again stopped, and leaning ever the back of a\r\nchair, opposite to Virginia, waited in silence for her to proceed. He\r\nwaited in vain.\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to distress you, Miss Hartley," said he.\r\n\r\nShe burst into tears. "I knew, I knew," cried she, "that you _would_ be\r\ndispleased; I told Mrs. Ormond so. I knew you would never forgive me."\r\n\r\n"In that you were mistaken," said Clarence, mildly; "I forgive you\r\nwithout difficulty, as I hope you may forgive yourself: nor can it be my\r\nwish to extort from you any mortifying confessions. But, perhaps, it may\r\nyet be in my power to serve you, if you will trust to me. I will myself\r\nspeak to your father. I will do every thing to secure to you the object\r\nof your affections, if you will, in this last moment of our connexion,\r\ntreat me with sincerity, and suffer me to be your friend."\r\n\r\nVirginia sobbed so violently for some time, that she could not speak:\r\nat last she said, "You are--you are the most generous of men! You have\r\nalways been my _best_ friend! I am the most ungrateful of human beings!\r\nBut I am sure I never wished, I never intended, to deceive you. Mrs.\r\nOrmond told me--"\r\n\r\n"Do not speak of her at present, or perhaps I may lose my temper,"\r\ninterrupted Clarence in an altered voice: "only tell me--I conjure you,\r\ntell me--in one word, who is this man and where is he to be found?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. I do not understand you," said Virginia.\r\n\r\n"You do not know! You will not trust me. Then I must leave you to--to\r\nMr. Hartley."\r\n\r\n"Do not leave me--oh, do not leave me in anger!" cried Virginia,\r\nclinging to him. "Not trust you!--I!--not trust you! Oh, what _can_ you\r\nmean? I have no confessions to make! Mrs. Ormond knows every thought of\r\nmy mind, and so shall you, if you will only hear me. I do not know who\r\nthis man is, I assure you; nor where he is to be found."\r\n\r\n"And yet you love him? Can you love a man whom you do not know,\r\nVirginia?"\r\n\r\n"I only love his figure, I believe," said Virginia.\r\n\r\n"His figure!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am quite bewildered," said Virginia, looking round wildly; "I\r\nknow not what I feel."\r\n\r\n"If you permitted this man to kneel to you, to kiss your hand, surely\r\nyou must know that you love him, Virginia?"\r\n\r\n"But that was only in a dream; and Mrs. Ormond said----"\r\n\r\n"Only a dream! But you met him at Mrs. Smith\'s, in the New Forest?"\r\n\r\n"That was only a picture."\r\n\r\n"Only a picture!--but you have seen the original?"\r\n\r\n"Never--never in my life; and I wish to Heaven I had never, never seen\r\nthe fatal picture! the image haunts me day and night. When I read of\r\nheroes in the day, that figure rises to my view, instead of yours. When\r\nI go to sleep at night, I see it, instead of yours, in my dreams; it\r\nspeaks to me, it kneels to me. I long ago told Mrs. Ormond this, but she\r\nlaughed at me. I told her of that frightful dream. I saw you weltering\r\nin your blood; I tried to save you, but could not. I heard you say,\r\n\'Perfidious, ungrateful Virginia! you are the cause of my death!\' Oh,\r\nit was the most dreadful night I ever passed! Still this figure, this\r\npicture, was before me; and he was the knight of the white plumes; and\r\nit was he who stabbed you; but when I wished him to be victorious, I did\r\nnot know that he was fighting against you. So Mrs. Ormond told me that\r\nI need not blame myself; and she said that you were not so foolish as to\r\nbe jealous of a picture; but I knew you would be displeased--I knew you\r\nwould think me ungrateful--I knew you would never forgive me."\r\n\r\nWhilst Virginia rapidly uttered all this, Clarence marked the wild\r\nanimation of her eyes, the sudden changes of her countenance; he\r\nrecollected her father\'s insanity; every feeling of his mind gave way to\r\nterror and pity; he approached her with all the calmness that he\r\ncould assume, took both her hands, and holding them in his, said, in a\r\nsoothing voice--\r\n\r\n"My dear Virginia, you are not ungrateful. I do not think you so. I am\r\nnot displeased with you. You have done nothing to displease me. Compose\r\nyourself, dear Virginia."\r\n\r\n"I am quite composed, now you again call me dear Virginia. Only I am\r\nafraid, as I always told Mrs. Ormond, that I do not love you _enough_;\r\nbut she said that I did, and that my fear was the strongest proof of my\r\naffection."\r\n\r\nVirginia now spoke in so consistent a manner that Clarence could not\r\ndoubt that she was in the clear possession of her understanding. She\r\nrepeated to him all that she had said to Mrs. Ormond; and he began to\r\nhope that, without any intention to deceive, Mrs. Ormond\'s ignorance\r\nof the human heart led her into a belief that Virginia was in love with\r\nhim; whilst, in fact, her imagination, exalted by solitude and romance,\r\nembodied and became enamoured of a phantom.\r\n\r\n"I always told Mrs. Ormond that she was mistaken," said Clarence.\r\n"I never believed that you loved me, Virginia, till--(he paused and\r\ncarefully examined her countenance)--till you yourself gave me reason to\r\nthink so. Was it only a principle of gratitude, then, that dictated your\r\nanswer to my letter?"\r\n\r\nShe looked irresolute: and at last, in a low voice, said, "If I could\r\nsee, if I could speak to Mrs. Ormond------"\r\n\r\n"She cannot tell what are the secret feelings of your heart, Virginia.\r\nConsult no Mrs. Ormond. Consult no human creature but yourself."\r\n\r\n"But Mrs. Ormond told me that you loved me, and that you had educated me\r\nto be your wife."\r\n\r\nMr. Hervey made an involuntary exclamation against Mrs. Ormond\'s folly.\r\n\r\n"How, then, can you be happy," continued Virginia, "if I am so\r\nungrateful as to say I do not love you? That I do not _love_ you!--Oh!\r\n_that_ I cannot say; for I do love you better than any one living except\r\nmy father, and with the same sort of affection that I feel for him.\r\nYou ask me to tell you the secret feelings of my heart: the only secret\r\nfeeling of which I am conscious is--a wish not to marry, unless I could\r\nsee in reality such a person as----But that I knew was only a picture,\r\na dream; and I thought that I ought at least to sacrifice my foolish\r\nimaginations to you, who have done so much for me. I knew that it would\r\nbe the height of ingratitude to refuse you; and besides, my father\r\ntold me that you would not accept of my fortune without my hand, so\r\nI consented to marry you: forgive me, if these were wrong motives--I\r\nthought them right. Only tell me what I can do to make you happy, as\r\nI am sure I wish to do; to that wish I would sacrifice every other\r\nfeeling."\r\n\r\n"Sacrifice nothing, dear Virginia. We may both be happy without making\r\nany sacrifice of our feelings," cried Clarence. And, transported at\r\nregaining his own freedom, Virginia\'s simplicity never appeared to\r\nhim so charming as at this moment. "Dearest Virginia, forgive me for\r\nsuspecting you for one instant of any thing unhandsome. Mrs. Ormond,\r\nwith the very best intentions possible, has led us both to the brink\r\nof misery. But I find you such as I always thought you, ingenuous,\r\naffectionate, innocent."\r\n\r\n"And you are not angry with me?" interrupted Virginia, with joyful\r\neagerness; "and you will not think me ungrateful? And you will not be\r\nunhappy? And Mrs. Ormond was mistaken? And you do not wish that I should\r\n_love_ you, that I should be your wife, I mean? Oh, don\'t deceive me,\r\nfor I cannot help believing whatever you say."\r\n\r\nClarence Hervey, to give her a convincing proof that Mrs. Ormond had\r\nmisled her as to his sentiments, immediately avowed his passion for\r\nBelinda.\r\n\r\n"You have relieved me from all doubt, all fear, all anxiety," said\r\nVirginia, with the sweetest expression of innocent affection in her\r\ncountenance. "May you be as happy as you deserve to be! May Belinda--is\r\nnot that her name?--May Belinda--"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lady Delacour half opened the door, exclaiming--"Human\r\npatience can wait no longer!"\r\n\r\n"Will you trust me to explain for you, dear Virginia?" said Clarence.\r\n\r\n"Most willingly," said Virginia, retiring as Lady Delacour advanced.\r\n"Pray leave me here alone, whilst you, who are used to talk before\r\nstrangers, speak for me."\r\n\r\n"Dare you venture, Clarence," said her ladyship, as she closed the door,\r\n"to leave her alone with that picture? You are no lover, if you be not\r\njealous."\r\n\r\n"I am not jealous," said Clarence, "yet I am a lover--a passionate\r\nlover."\r\n\r\n"A passionate lover!" cried Lady Delacour, stopping short as they were\r\ncrossing the antechamber:--"then I have done nothing but mischief. In\r\nlove with Virginia? I will not--cannot believe it."\r\n\r\n"In love with Belinda!--Cannot you, will not you believe it?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Clarence, I never doubted it for an instant. But are you at\r\nliberty to own it to any body but me?"\r\n\r\n"I am at liberty to declare it to all the world."\r\n\r\n"You transport me with joy! I will not keep you from her a second. But\r\nstay--I am sorry to tell you, that, as she informed me this morning,\r\n_her heart is not at present inclined to love_. And here is Mrs.\r\nMargaret Delacour, poor wretch, in this room, dying with curiosity.\r\nCuriosity is as ardent as love, and has as good a claim to compassion."\r\n\r\nAs he entered the room, where there were only Mrs. Margaret Delacour and\r\nBelinda, Clarence Hervey\'s first glance, rapid as it was, explained his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBelinda put her arm within Lady Delacour\'s, trembling so that she\r\ncould scarcely stand. Lady Delacour pressed her hand, and was perfectly\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n"And what is Miss Portman to believe," cried Mrs. Margaret Delacour,\r\n"when she has seen you on the very eve of marriage with another lady?"\r\n\r\n"The strongest merit I can plead with such a woman as Miss Portman is,\r\nthat I was ready to sacrifice my own happiness to a sense of duty. Now\r\nthat I am at liberty----"\r\n\r\n"Now that you are at liberty," interrupted Lady Delacour, "you are in a\r\nvast hurry to offer your whole soul to a lady, who has for months\r\nseen all your merits with perfect insensibility, and who has been,\r\nnotwithstanding all my operations, stone blind to your love."\r\n\r\n"The struggles of my passion cannot totally have escaped Belinda\'s\r\npenetration," said Clarence; "but I like her a thousand times the better\r\nfor not having trusted merely to appearances. That love is most to be\r\nvalued which cannot be easily won. In my opinion there is a prodigious\r\ndifference between a warm imagination and a warm heart."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Lady Delacour, "we have all of us seen _Pamela\r\nmaritata_--let us now see _Belinda in love_, if that be possible. _If!_\r\nforgive me this last stroke, my dear--in spite of all my raillery, I\r\ndo believe that the prudent Belinda is more capable of feeling real\r\npermanent passion than any of the dear sentimental young ladies, whose\r\nmotto is\r\n\r\n   \'All for love, or the world well lost.\'"\r\n\r\n"That is just my opinion," said Mrs. Margaret Delacour.\r\n\r\n"But pray, what is become of Mr. Hartley?" looking round: "I do not see\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"No: for I have hid him," said Lady Delacour: "he shall be forthcoming\r\npresently."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mr. Clarence Hervey, what have you done with my Virginia?" said\r\nMrs. Ormond, coming into the room.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs. Ormond, what have _you_ done with her?" replied Clarence. "By\r\nyour mistaken kindness, by insisting upon doing us both good against our\r\nwills, you were very near making us both miserable for life. But I blame\r\nnobody; I have no right to blame any one so much as myself. All this\r\nhas arisen from my own presumption and imprudence. Nothing could be more\r\nabsurd than my scheme of educating a woman in solitude to make her fit\r\nfor society. I might have foreseen what must happen, that Virginia would\r\nconsider me as her tutor, her father, not as her lover, or her husband;\r\nthat with the most affectionate of hearts, she could for me feel nothing\r\nbut _gratitude_."\r\n\r\n"Nothing but gratitude!" repeated Mrs. Ormond, with a degree of\r\namazement in her countenance, which made every body present smile: "I am\r\nsure I thought she was dying for love of you."\r\n\r\n"My dear Belinda," whispered Lady Delacour, "if I might judge of the\r\ncolour of this cheek, which has been for some moments permanent crimson,\r\nI should guess that you were beginning to find out _of what use the sun\r\nis to the dial_."\r\n\r\n"You will not let me hear what Mr. Hervey is saying," replied Belinda;\r\n"I am very curious."\r\n\r\n"Curiosity is a stronger passion than love, as I told him just now,"\r\nsaid Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his explanations, Mrs. Ormond could not be made to\r\ncomprehend Virginia\'s feelings. She continually repeated, "But it is\r\nimpossible for Virginia, or for any body, to be in love with a picture."\r\n\r\n"It is not said that she is in love with a picture," replied Mrs.\r\nDelacour, "though even for that I could find you a precedent."\r\n\r\n"My Lady Delacour," said Mrs. Ormond, "will you explain to us how that\r\npicture came into your possession, and how it came here, and, in short,\r\nall that is to be known about it?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, explain! explain! my dear Lady Delacour," cried Mrs. Delacour:\r\n"I am afraid I am grown almost as curious as my Lady Boucher. Explain!\r\nexplain!"\r\n\r\n"Most willingly," said Lady Delacour. "To Marriott\'s ruling passion for\r\nbirds you are all of you indebted for this discovery. Some time ago,\r\nwhilst we were at Twickenham, as Marriott was waiting at a stationer\'s,\r\nto bid her last adieus to a bullfinch, a gentleman came into the shop\r\nwhere she and Bobby (as she calls this bird) were coquetting, and the\r\ngentleman was struck even more than Marriott with the bullfinch. He went\r\nalmost distracted on hearing a particular tune, which this bird sang. I\r\nsuspected, from the symptoms, that the gentleman must be, or must have\r\nbeen, in love with the bullfinch\'s mistress. Now the bullfinch was\r\ntraced home to the ci-devant Virginia St. Pierre, the present Miss\r\nHartley. I had my reasons for being curious about her loves and lovers,\r\nand as soon as I learned the story from Marriott, I determined, if\r\npossible, to find out who this stranger, with the strange passion for\r\nbullfinches, might be. I questioned and cross-questioned all those\r\npeople at the stationer\'s who were present when he fell into ecstasies;\r\nand, from the shopman, who had been bribed to secrecy, I learned that\r\nour gentleman returned to the stationer\'s the day after he met Marriott,\r\nand watched till he obtained a sight of Virginia, as she came to her\r\nwindow. Now it was believed by the girl of this shop, who had lived for\r\nsome time with Mrs. Ormond--Forgive me, Mr. Hervey, for what I am going\r\nto say--forgive me, Mrs. Ormond--scandal, like death, is common to\r\nall--It was believed that Virginia was Mr. Hervey\'s mistress. My\r\nstranger no sooner learned this than he swore that he would think of her\r\nno more; and after bestowing a variety of seamen\'s\' execrations upon\r\nthe villain who had seduced this heavenly creature, he departed from\r\nTwickenham, and was no more seen or heard of. My inquiries after him\r\nwere indefatigable, but for some time unsuccessful: and so they might\r\nhave continued, and we might have been all making one another unhappy at\r\nthis moment, if it had not been for Mr. Vincent\'s great dog Juba--Miss\r\nAnnabella Luttridge\'s billet-doux--Sir Philip Baddely\'s insolence--my\r\nLord Delacour\'s belief in a quack balsam--and Captain Sunderland\'s\r\nhumanity."\r\n\r\n"Captain Sunderland! who is Captain Sunderland? we never heard of him\r\nbefore," cried Mrs. Ormond.\r\n\r\n"You shall hear of him just as I did, if you please," said Lady\r\nDelacour, "and if Belinda will submit to hear me tell the same story\r\ntwice."\r\n\r\nHere her ladyship repeated the history of the battle of the dogs; and\r\nof Sir Philip Baddely\'s knocking down Juba, the man, for struggling in\r\ndefence of Juba, the dog.\r\n\r\n"Now the gentleman who assisted my Lord Delacour in bringing the\r\ndisabled negro across the square to our house, was Captain Sunderland.\r\nMy lord summoned Marriott to produce Lady Boucher\'s infallible balsam,\r\nthat it might be tried upon Juba\'s sprained ankle. Whilst my lord was\r\nintent upon the balsam, Marriott was intent upon Captain Sunderland.\r\nShe recollected that she had met him somewhere before, and the moment he\r\nspoke, she knew him to be the gentleman who had fallen into ecstasies\r\nin the shop at Twickenham, about the bullfinch. Marriott hastened to\r\nme with the news; I hastened to my lord, made him introduce Captain\r\nSunderland to me, and I never rested till he had told me all that I\r\nwanted to know. Some years ago, just before he went to sea, he paid\r\na visit to his mother, who then lodged with a widow Smith, in the New\r\nForest. Whilst he was there, he heard of the young beauty who lived in\r\nthe Forest, with a grandmother, who was _not a little particular_; and\r\nwho would not permit any body to see her.\r\n\r\n"My captain\'s curiosity was excited; one day, unseen by the duenna, he\r\nobtained a distinct view of Virginia, watering her roses and tending her\r\nbees. Struck with her uncommon beauty, he approached carefully to the\r\nthicket in which the cottage was enclosed, and found a _lair_, where\r\nhe concealed himself, day after day, and contemplated at leisure the\r\nbudding charms of the fair wood-nymph. In short, he became so enamoured,\r\nthat he was determined to gain admittance at the cottage, and declare\r\nhis passion: but to his honour be it told, that when the history of the\r\npoor girl\'s mother, and the situation and fears of the old lady, who\r\nwas her only friend, were known to him, in consideration of the extreme\r\nyouth of the ward, and the extreme age of her guardian, he determined to\r\ndefer his addresses till his return from the West Indies, whither he was\r\nshortly to sail, and where he had hopes of making a fortune, that\r\nmight put him in a situation to render the object of his affections\r\nindependent. He left a bullfinch with Mrs. Smith, who gave it to\r\nVirginia, without telling to whom it had belonged, lest her grandmother\r\nmight be displeased.\r\n\r\n"I really thought that all this showed too nice a moral sense for\r\na young dashing lieutenant in the navy, and I was persuaded that my\r\ngentleman was only keeping his mistress\'s secret like a man of honour.\r\nWith this belief, I regretted that Clarence Hervey should throw himself\r\naway upon a girl who was unworthy of him."\r\n\r\n"I hope," interrupted Clarence, "you are perfectly convinced of your\r\nmistake."\r\n\r\n"Perfectly! perfectly!--I am convinced that Virginia is only half mad.\r\nBut let me go on with my story. I was determined to discover whether she\r\nhad any remains of affection for this captain. It was in vain he assured\r\nme that she had never seen him. I prevailed upon him to let me go on my\r\nown way. I inquired whether he had ever had his picture drawn. Yes, he\r\nhad for his mother, just when he first went out to sea. It had been left\r\nat the widow Smith\'s. I begged him to procure it for me. He told me it\r\nwas impossible. I told him I trampled on impossibilities. In short, he\r\ngot the picture for me, as you see. \'Now,\' thought I, \'if he speaks the\r\ntruth, Virginia will see this picture without emotion, and it will only\r\nseem to be a present for Clarence. But if she had ever seen him before,\r\nor had any secret to conceal, she will betray herself on the sudden\r\nappearance of this picture.\' Things have turned out contrary to all my\r\nexpectations, and yet better.------And now, Clarence, I must beg you\r\nwill prevail on Miss Hartley to appear; I can go on no farther without\r\nher."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour took Virginia by the hand, the moment she entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Will you trust yourself with me, Miss Hartley?" said she. "I have made\r\nyou faint once to-day by the sight of a picture; will you promise me not\r\nto faint again, when I produce the original?"\r\n\r\n"The original!" said Virginia. "I will trust myself with you, for I am\r\nsure you cannot mean to laugh at me, though, perhaps, I deserve to be\r\nlaughed at."\r\n\r\nLady Delacour threw open the door of another apartment. Mr. Hartley\r\nappeared, and with him Captain Sunderland.\r\n\r\n"My dear daughter," said Mr. Hartley, "give me leave to introduce to you\r\na friend, to whom I owe more obligations than to any man living, except\r\nto Mr. Hervey. This gentleman was stationed some years ago at Jamaica,\r\nand in a rebellion of the negroes on my plantation he saved my life.\r\nFortune has accidentally thrown my benefactor in my way. To show my\r\nsense of my obligations is out of my power."\r\n\r\nVirginia\'s surprise was extreme; her vivid dreams, the fond wishes of\r\nher waking fancy, were at once accomplished. For the first moment she\r\ngazed as on an animated picture, and all the ideas of love and romance\r\nassociated with this image rushed upon her mind.\r\n\r\nBut when the realities by which he was surrounded dispelled the\r\nillusion, she suddenly withdrew her eyes, and blushed deeply, with such\r\ntimid and graceful modesty as charmed every body present.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sunderland pressed forward; but was stopped by Lady Delacour.\r\n\r\n"Avaunt, thou real lover!" cried she: "none but the shadow of a man can\r\nhope to approach the visionary maid. In vain has Marraton forced his way\r\nthrough the bushes and briars, in vain has he braved the apparition of\r\nthe lion; there is yet a phantom barrier apparently impassable between\r\nhim and his Yaratilda, for he is in the world of shadows. Now, mark me,\r\nMarraton: hurry not this delicate spirit, or perchance you frighten and\r\nlose her for ever; but have patience, and gradually and gracefully she\r\nwill venture into your world of realities--only give her time."\r\n\r\n"Time! O yes, give me time," cried Virginia, shrinking back.\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Hartley," continued Lady Delacour, "in plain prose, to\r\nprevent all difficulties and embarrassments, I must inform you, that\r\nCaptain Sunderland will not insist upon prompt payment of your father\'s\r\ndebt of gratitude: he has but one quarter of an hour to spend with\r\nus--he is actually under sailing orders; so that you will have time to\r\ncompose your mind before his return. Clarence, I advise you to accompany\r\nCaptain Sunderland on this cruise; don\'t you, Belinda?\r\n\r\n"And now, my good friends," continued Lady Delacour, "shall I finish the\r\nnovel for you?"\r\n\r\n"If your ladyship pleases; nobody can do it better," said Clarence\r\nHervey.\r\n\r\n"But I hope you will remember, dear Lady Delacour," said Belinda, "that\r\nthere is nothing in which novelists are so apt to err as in hurrying\r\nthings toward the conclusion: in not allowing _time_ enough for that\r\nchange of feeling, which change of situation cannot instantly produce."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, my dear Belinda; true to your principles to the last\r\ngasp. Fear nothing--you shall have _time_ enough to become accustomed\r\nto Clarence. Would you choose that I should draw out the story to five\r\nvolumes more? With your advice and assistance, I can with the greatest\r\nease, my dear. A declaration of love, you know, is only the beginning\r\nof things; there may be blushes, and sighs, and doubts, and fears, and\r\nmisunderstandings, and jealousies without end or common sense, to fill\r\nup the necessary space, and to gain the necessary _time_; but if I might\r\nconclude the business in two lines, I should say,\r\n\r\n    \'Ye gods, annihilate both space and time,\r\n    And make four lovers happy.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that would be cutting matters too short," said Mrs. Margaret\r\nDelacour. "I am of the old school; and though I could dispense with the\r\ndescription of Miss Harriot Byron\'s worked chairs and fine china, yet I\r\nown I like to hear something of the preparation for a marriage, as well\r\nas of the mere wedding. I like to hear _how_ people become happy in a\r\nrational manner, better than to be told in the huddled style of an old\r\nfairy tale--_and so they were all married, and they lived very happily\r\nall the rest of their days_."\r\n\r\n"We are not in much danger of hearing such an account of modern\r\nmarriages," said Lady Delacour. "But how shall I please you all?--Some\r\npeople cry, \'Tell me every thing;\' others say, that,\r\n\r\n    \'Le secret d\'ennuyer est celui de tout dire.\'"\r\n\r\n"Something must be left to the imagination. Positively I will not\r\ndescribe wedding-dresses, or a procession to church. I have no objection\r\nto saying that the happy couples were united by the worthy Mr. Moreton;\r\nthat Mr. Percival gave Belinda away; and that immediately after the\r\nceremony, he took the whole party down with him to Oakly-park. Will this\r\ndo?--Or, we may conclude, if you like it better, with a characteristic\r\nletter of congratulation from Mrs. Stanhope to her _dearest_ niece,\r\nBelinda, acknowledging that she was wrong to quarrel with her for\r\nrefusing Sir Philip Baddely, and giving her infinite credit for that\r\nadmirable _management_ of Clarence Hervey, which she hopes will continue\r\nthrough life."\r\n\r\n"Well, I have no objection to ending with a letter," said Mrs. Delacour;\r\n"for last speeches are always tiresome."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said her ladyship; "it is so difficult, as the Critic says, to\r\nget lovers off upon their knees. Now I think of it, let me place you all\r\nin proper attitudes for stage effect. What signifies being happy,\r\nunless we appear so?--Captain Sunderland--kneeling with Virginia, if you\r\nplease, sir, at her father\'s feet: you in the act of giving them your\r\nblessing, Mr. Hartley. Mrs. Ormond clasps her hands with joy--nothing\r\ncan be better than that, madam--I give you infinite credit for the\r\nattitude. Clarence, you have a right to Belinda\'s hand, and may kiss\r\nit too: nay, Miss Portman, it is the rule of the stage. Now, where\'s\r\nmy Lord Delacour? he should be embracing me, to show that we are\r\nreconciled. Ha! here he comes--Enter Lord Delacour, with little Helena\r\nin his hand--very well! a good start of surprise, my love--stand still,\r\npray; you cannot be better than you are: Helena, my love, do not let go\r\nyour father\'s hand. There! quite pretty and natural! Now, Lady Delacour,\r\nto show that she is reformed, comes forward to address the audience with\r\na moral--a moral! Yes,\r\n\r\n    "Our _tale_ contains a _moral_; and, no doubt,\r\n    You all have wit enough to find it out.\'"\r\n\r\n(_Written in_ 1800. _Published in_ 1801.)\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This declaration was taken from the lips of a celebrated character.\r\n\r\n[2] The manners, if not the morals, of gentlemen, have improved since\r\nthe first publication of this work.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
