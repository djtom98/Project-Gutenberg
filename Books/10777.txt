They are a nuisance to everyone--my abomination, as you know,\r\nJack. Why on earth they can not be kept out of sight altogether till\r\nthey reach a sensible age is what puzzles me! And I suppose if anything\r\ncould make the matter worse, it is that this is a girl."\r\n\r\nThe tone of disgust with which the last word was uttered brought a laugh\r\nfrom Sir Edward Wentworth\'s companion, who replied, as he took his cigar\r\nfrom his mouth and gazed critically into the worried, perplexed face of\r\nhis host--\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, she is not of an age yet to trouble you much. Wait till\r\nshe gets a bit older. When her education is finished, and she takes\r\npossession of you and your house, will be the time for you to look to\r\nus for pity!"\r\n\r\n"Look here, Sir Edward," said a bright looking youth from the other side\r\nof the room, "I\'ll give you a bit of advice. Send the child straight off\r\nto school. Is she coming to-day? Good. Then pack her off to-morrow, and\r\nkeep her there as long as is needful. Then I will go down and inspect\r\nher, and if she grows up to be a moderately decent-looking girl, I will\r\ndo you a good turn by taking her off your hands. She will have a nice\r\nlittle fortune, you informed us, and if you will give her something in\r\naddition, out of gratitude to me for relieving you of all responsibility\r\nconcerning her, upon my word I think I should not do badly!"\r\n\r\nBut Sir Edward was not in a mood to joke. He looked gloomily around upon\r\nhis friends as they gathered around the smoking-room fire after a hard\r\nday\'s shooting, and remarked--\r\n\r\n"I know what is before me. I have seen it in my sister\'s family, and\r\nhave heard something of all her toils and troubles. How thankful I was\r\nwhen she and hers were translated to Australia, and the sea came between\r\nus! It is first the nurses, who run off with one\'s butler, make love to\r\nthe keepers, and bring all kinds of followers about the house, who\r\nsometimes make off with one\'s plate. Then it\'s the governesses, who come\r\nand have a try at the guests, or most likely in my case they would set\r\ntheir affections on me, and get the reins of government entirely into\r\ntheir hands. If it is school, then there is a mass of correspondence\r\nabout the child\'s health and training; and, in addition, I shall have\r\nall the ladies in the neighborhood coming to mother the child and tell\r\nme how to train it. It is a bad look-out for me, I can tell you, and not\r\none of you would care to be in my shoes."\r\n\r\n"What is the trouble, Ned?" asked a new-comer, opening the door and\r\nglancing at the amused faces of those surrounding Sir Edward, all of\r\nwhom seemed to be keenly enjoying their host\'s perplexity.\r\n\r\n"He has received a legacy to-day, that is all," was the response; "he\r\nhas had an orphan niece and nurse sent to him from some remote place in\r\nthe Highlands. Come, give us your case again, old fellow, for the\r\nbenefit of your cousin."\r\n\r\nSir Edward, a grave, abstracted-looking man, with an iron-grey\r\nmoustache and dark, piercing eyes, looked up with a desponding shake of\r\nthe head, and repeated slowly and emphatically--\r\n\r\n"A widowed sister of mine died last year, and left her little girl in\r\nthe charge of an old school friend, who has now taken a husband to\r\nherself and discarded the child, calmly sending me the following\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n  \'DEAR SIR: Doubtless you will remember that\r\n  your sister\'s great desire on her death-bed was that\r\n  you should receive her little one and bring her up\r\n  under your own eye, being her natural guardian\r\n  and nearest relative. Hearing, however, from you\r\n  that you did not at that time feel equal to the\r\n  responsibility, I came forward and volunteered to\r\n  take her for a short while till you had made\r\n  arrangements to receive her. I have been expecting\r\n  to hear from you for some time, and\r\n  as I have promised my future husband to fix\r\n  the day for our marriage some time early next\r\n  month, I thought I could not do better than send\r\n  the child with her nurse to you without delay.\r\n  She will reach you the day after you receive this\r\n  letter. Perhaps you will kindly send me word of\r\n  her safe arrival.      Yours truly,\r\n                             ANNA KENT.\'\r\n\r\nNow, Lovell, what do you think of that? And sure enough, this afternoon,\r\nwhile we were out, the child and nurse appeared, and are in the house\r\nat this present moment. Don\'t you think it a hard case for such a\r\nconfirmed bachelor as I am?"\r\n\r\n"I do indeed," was the hearty reply; "but I think you will find a way\r\nout of it, Ned. Take a wife unto yourself, and she will relieve you of\r\nall responsibility."\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh at this, but in the midst of it the door\r\nslowly opened, and the subject of all this discussion appeared on the\r\nthreshold, a fragile little figure, with long, golden-brown hair, and a\r\npair of dark brown eyes that looked calmly and searchingly in front of\r\nher. Clad in white, with her dimpled hands crossed in front of her, she\r\nstood there for a moment in silence, then spoke:--\r\n\r\n"Where is my Uncle Edward?"\r\n\r\n"Here," replied Sir Edward, as he looked helplessly round, first at his\r\nfriends and then at his small niece.\r\n\r\nThe child stepped up to him with perfect composure, and held out her\r\nlittle hand, which her uncle took, undergoing all the while a severe\r\nscrutiny from the pair of dark eyes fixed upon him. There was dead\r\nsilence in the room. Sir Edward\'s companions were delighting in the\r\nscene, and his great discomfiture only heightened their enjoyment.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said at length, rather feebly, "I think you know the look of\r\nme now, don\'t you? Where is your nurse? Ought you not to be in your bed?\r\nThis is not the place for little girls, you know."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking you would kiss me," and the child\'s lips began to\r\nquiver, while a pink flush rose to her cheeks, and she glanced wistfully\r\nround, in the hope of seeing some sympathetic face near her.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Edward could not bring himself to do this. Laying his hand on\r\nthe curly head raised to his, he patted it as he might his dog, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"There, there! Now you have introduced yourself to me, you can run away.\r\nWhat is your name? Millicent, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Milly is my name. And are all these gentlemen my uncles too?"\r\n\r\nThe tone of doubtful inquiry was too much for the little company, and\r\nMilly\'s question was answered by a shout of laughter.\r\n\r\nAgain the child\'s face flushed, and then a grey-haired man stepped\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n"Come, Wentworth, this is a severe ordeal for such a mite. I have\r\ngrandchildren of my own, so am not so scared as you. Now, little one, is\r\nthat better?"\r\n\r\nAnd in an instant the child was lifted by him and placed upon his knee\r\nas he took a seat by the fire.\r\n\r\nMilly heaved a short sigh.\r\n\r\n"I like this," she said, looking up at him confidingly. "Does Uncle\r\nEdward really want me to go to bed? Nurse said it wasn\'t time yet. Nurse\r\nwanted her supper, so she sent me in here while she had it."\r\n\r\n"The reign of the nurse has begun," said Sir Edward. "Well, it may be a\r\nvery fine joke to all you fellows, but if I don\'t make my authority felt\r\nat once, it will be all up with me. Lovell, be so good as to ring that\r\nbell."\r\n\r\nSir Edward\'s voice was irate when his old butler appeared.\r\n\r\n"Ford, take this child to her nurse, and tell her that she is never to\r\nappear in my presence again unless sent for. Now, Millicent, go at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\nThe child slid down from her seat, but though evidently puzzled at the\r\nquick, sharp words, she seemed to have no fear, for, going up to her\r\nuncle, she slipped her little hand into his.\r\n\r\n"Are you angry, uncle? What does \'presence\' mean? Will you say,\r\n\'Good-night; God bless you,\' to me?"\r\n\r\nWith the baby fingers clinging to his, what could Sir Edward say?\r\n\r\n"Good-night; good-night, child! Now go."\r\n\r\n"Say, \'God bless you!\'" persisted the little one, and it was not till\r\nher uncle muttered the desired words that she relinquished her hold and\r\nfollowed the butler sedately out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID AND GOLIATH.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Wentworth was, as he expressed it, a "confirmed bachelor,"\r\nand though during the autumn months he was quite willing to fill his\r\nhouse with his London friends, he was better pleased to live the greater\r\npart of the year in seclusion, occupying himself with looking after his\r\nestate and writing articles for several of the leading reviews of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe advent of his small niece was indeed a great trial to him, but, with\r\nhis characteristic thoroughness, he determined that he would make the\r\nnecessary arrangements for her comfort. Accordingly he had a long\r\ninterview with her nurse the following morning. It proved to be\r\nsatisfactory. The nurse was a staid, elderly woman, who assured him she\r\nwas accustomed to the sole charge of the child, and would keep her\r\nentirely under her own control.\r\n\r\n"I expect you would like her to be sent down to you in the evening--at\r\ndessert, perhaps, sir?" she inquired.\r\n\r\nSir Edward pulled the ends of his moustache dubiously. "Is it necessary?\r\nI thought children ought to be in bed at that time."\r\n\r\n"Of course it shall be as you like, sir. You do not dine so late as some\r\ndo. I thought you would expect to see her once in the day."\r\n\r\nAfter a little hesitation Sir Edward gave his permission; and when he\r\nfound that Milly neither screamed nor snatched for the fruit on the\r\ntable, and did not herself engross the whole conversation, he became\r\nquite reconciled to the little white figure stealing in and occupying\r\nthe chair that was always placed at his left-hand side for her.\r\n\r\nBeyond this he saw very little of her while his guests were with him;\r\nbut afterwards, when they had all left him, and he relapsed into his\r\nordinary life, he was constantly coming across her. Sometimes he would\r\nfind her in the stables, her arms round the stable cat, and the grooms\r\nholding a voluble conversation with her, or among the cows at the bottom\r\nof the paddock, or feeding the pigs and fowls in the poultry yard.\r\nGenerally she was attended by Fritz, a beautiful collie, who had, with\r\nthe fickleness of his nature, transferred his affection from his master\r\nto her, and though uncertain in temper towards most, was never anything\r\nbut amiable when with the little girl.\r\n\r\nHer uncle\'s form approaching was quite a sufficient hint to her to make\r\nherself scarce. She would generally anticipate the usual formula: "Now\r\nrun away child, to nurse," by singing out cheerfully: "I am just off,\r\nuncle," and by the time he had reached the spot where she was standing\r\nthe little figure would be running off in the distance, Fritz close at\r\nher heels.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Sir Edward was returning from a stroll up the avenue when\r\nhe saw the child at play among the trees, and for a moment he paused and\r\nwatched her. She appeared to be very busy with a doll wrapped in a fur\r\nrug which she carefully deposited at the foot of the tree; then for some\r\nminutes she and Fritz seemed to be having a kind of a game of hide and\r\nseek with one another, until she pushed him into a bush and commanded\r\nhim to stay there. Suddenly dog and child darted at each other, and\r\nthen, to Sir Edward\'s amazement, he saw his little niece seize Fritz by\r\nthe throat and bring him to the ground. When both were rolling over one\r\nanother, and Fritz\'s short, sharp barks became rather indignant in tone,\r\nas he vainly tried to escape from the little hands so tightly round him,\r\nSir Edward thought it high time to interfere.\r\n\r\n"Millicent," he called out sharply, "come to me at once; what are you\r\ndoing?"\r\n\r\nIn an instant Milly was upon her feet, and lifting a hot flushed little\r\nface to his, she placed herself in her favorite attitude when in his\r\npresence; her hands clasped behind her back, and feet closely planted\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know Fritz might bite if you are so rough with him? Were you\r\ntrying to choke him?" demanded her uncle.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she responded, breathless from her late exertions, "I was trying\r\nto kill him! He\'s a bear, and that\'s my lamb, and I am David; that\'s\r\nall."\r\n\r\nA child\'s games were beyond Sir Edward\'s comprehension. He looked down\r\nupon her with a knitted brow.\r\n\r\nShe continued--\r\n\r\n"You see, he has to do for both, a bear and a lion, for they both came,\r\nand they both tried to get the lamb. Nurse was the lion one day, but she\r\nis too big; I can\'t knock her down, though I try hard."\r\n\r\n"I will not have Fritz knocked down in that fashion. He might hurt you,"\r\nsaid Sir Edward, sternly.\r\n\r\nMilly looked sorrowful; then brightening up, she asked--\r\n\r\n"But I may kill Goliath, mayn\'t I? Do you know that is one of my games.\r\nSee, I\'m David, and you see that big old tree standing by itself? That\'s\r\nGoliath. He is looking at me now. Do you see where his eyes come? Just\r\nup there in those first branches. When it\'s windy he shakes his head at\r\nme fearful! He\'s a wicked, wicked old thing, and he thinks no one can\r\nknock him down. Do you remember about him, uncle?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward was becoming slightly interested. He leaned against a tree\r\nand took out a cigar.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think I do," he said.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember? He stood up so proud, and called out: \'Choose a man\r\nto come and fight me.\' He\'s saying that to me now. I\'m David, you know,\r\nand I\'m going. Just wait a moment till I\'m ready."\r\n\r\nShe darted away to where her doll was, and soon returned with a tiny\r\ncalico bag, which she opened very carefully and disclosed to her uncle\'s\r\npuzzled gaze five round stones.\r\n\r\n"You see," she went on, "it\'s a pity I haven\'t a sling, but Tom in the\r\nstable says he will make me a cattypot; that\'s a lovely sling, he says,\r\nwhich would kill anything. But it\'s all right; I pretend I have a sling,\r\nyou know. Now you wait here; I\'m going to meet him. I\'m not a bit\r\nafraid, though he looks so big, because David wasn\'t, you know. God\r\nhelped him. Now, Goliath, I\'m ready!"\r\n\r\nSir Edward looked on in some amusement as Milly stepped out with regular\r\neven steps until she was about twenty feet from the tree, then suddenly\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n"I hear what you say, Goliath. You say you\'ll give my body to be pecked\r\nat and eaten by the birds; but you won\'t do that, for I am coming, and I\r\nam going to kill you."\r\n\r\nAnd then with all her strength the child flung her stones one by one at\r\nthe tree, pausing for some moments when she had done so.\r\n\r\n"He\'s quite dead, uncle," she said calmly, as she retraced her steps and\r\nstood before Sir Edward, again looking up at him with those earnest eyes\r\nof hers, "quite dead; and if I had a sword I would play at cutting off\r\nhis head. I suppose you wouldn\'t lend me your sword hanging up in the\r\nhall, would you?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly not," was the quick reply. Then taking his cigar from\r\nhis mouth, Sir Edward asked:\r\n\r\n"And does all your play consist in killing people?"\r\n\r\n"I only try to kill the bear and lion and Goliath, because they\'re so\r\nwicked and so strong."\r\n\r\nMilly continued,--\r\n\r\n"This is such a lovely place to play in--trees are so nice to have games\r\nwith. Shall I tell you some more? Do you see that little tree over\r\nthere? That\'s where I sit when I\'m the probable son, and when I\'ve sat\r\nthere a long time and been very miserable, and eaten some of the beech\r\nnuts that do for husks, then suddenly I think I will go home to my\r\nfather. It\'s rather a long walk, but I get happier and happier as I go,\r\nand I get to walk very quick at last, and then I run when I see my\r\nfather. Do you see that nice big old tree right up there with the red\r\nleaves, uncle? That\'s him, and I run up and say, \'Father, I have sinned;\r\nI am not fit to come back, but I am so sorry that I left you,\' and then\r\nI just hug him and kiss him; and, do you know, I feel he hugs and kisses\r\nme back. He does in the story, you know. And then I have a nice little\r\nfeast all ready. I get some biscuits from nurse, and a little jam, and\r\nsome sugar and water, and I sit down and feel so happy to think I\'m not\r\nthe probable son any more, and haven\'t got to eat husks or be with the\r\npigs. Don\'t you think that\'s a beautiful game, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Do you get all your games from the Bible?" inquired Sir Edward. "I\r\nsomehow think it is not quite correct," and he looked very dubiously at\r\nhis little niece as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Milly, the earnest look coming into her eyes again, "I love\r\nthe Bible so much, you see. Nurse tells me the stories ever so often,\r\nand I know lots and lots of them. But I like the probable son the best.\r\nDo you like it?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward replaced his cigar in his mouth and strolled on without a\r\nreply. His little niece\'s words awakened very uncomfortable feelings\r\nwithin his heart. Years before he had known and loved his Bible well. He\r\nhad been active in Christian work, and had borne many a scoff and jeer\r\nfrom his companions when at Oxford for being "pious," as they termed it.\r\nBut there came a time when coldness crept into his Christianity, and\r\nworldly ambition and desires filled his soul. Gradually he wandered\r\nfarther and farther away from the right path, and when he came into his\r\nproperty he took possession of it with no other aim and object in life\r\nthan to enjoy himself in his own way and to totally ignore both the past\r\nand future. Beyond going to church once on Sunday he made no profession\r\nof religion, but that custom he conformed to most regularly, and the\r\nvicar of the parish had nothing to complain of in the way in which his\r\nappeals for charity were met by the squire. It is needless to say that\r\nSir Edward was not a happy man. There were times when he could not bear\r\nhis own thoughts and the solitude of his position; and at such times\r\nthere was a hasty departure for town, and some weeks of club life\r\nensued, after which he would return to his home, and engross himself in\r\nboth his literary and country occupations with fresh vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PUNISHMENT.\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely little Milly was advancing in her uncle\'s favor. Her\r\nextreme docility and great fearlessness, added to her quaintness of\r\nspeech and action, attracted him greatly. He became interested in\r\nwatching her little figure as it flitted to and fro, and the sunny laugh\r\nand bright childish voice about the house were no longer an annoyance to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOne day he was moved to anger by an accident that happened to a small\r\nstatue in the hall and Milly was the delinquent. Her ball had rolled\r\nbehind it, and both she and the dog were having a romp to get it, when\r\nin the scuffle the statue came to the ground and lay there in a thousand\r\npieces. Hearing the crash, Sir Edward came out of his study, and\r\ncompletely losing his temper, he turned furiously upon the child, giving\r\nvent to language that was hardly fit for her ears to hear. She stood\r\nbefore him with round, frightened eyes and quivering lips, her little\r\nfigure upright and still, until she could bear it no longer; and then\r\nshe turned and fled from him through the garden door out upon the smooth\r\ngrassy lawn, where she flung herself down face foremost close to her\r\nfavorite beech tree, there giving way to a burst of passionate tears.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean it--oh! I didn\'t mean to break it," she sobbed aloud.\r\n"Uncle Edward is a fearful angry man; he doesn\'t love me a bit. I wish I\r\nhad a father! I want a father like the probable son; he wouldn\'t be so\r\nangry!"\r\n\r\nAnd when later on nurse came, with an anxious face, to fetch her little\r\ncharge in from the cold, wet grass, she had not the heart to scold her,\r\nfor the tear-stained face was raised so pitifully to hers with the\r\nwords,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, nurse, dear, carry me in your arms. No one loves me here. I\'ve been\r\ntelling God all about it. He\'s the only One that isn\'t angry."\r\n\r\nThat evening, at the accustomed time, Milly stole quietly into the\r\ndining-room, wondering in her little heart whether her uncle was still\r\nangry with her.\r\n\r\nAs she climbed into her chair, now placed on the opposite side of the\r\nlarge table, she eyed him doubtfully through her long eyelashes; then\r\ngathering courage from the immovable expression of his face, she said in\r\nher most cheerful tone,--\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very fine night, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Is it?" responded Sir Edward, who was accustomed by this time to some\r\nsuch remark when his little niece wanted to attract his notice. Then\r\nfeeling really ashamed of his outburst a few hours before, he said, by\r\nway of excusing himself,--"Look here, Millicent, you made me exceedingly\r\nangry by your piece of mischief this afternoon. That statue can never be\r\nreplaced, and you have destroyed one of my most valuable possessions.\r\nLet it be a warning for the future. If ever you break anything again, I\r\nshall punish you most severely. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, uncle," she answered, looking up earnestly. "\'You will punish me\r\n_most_ severely.\' I will remember. I have been wondering why I broke it,\r\nwhen I didn\'t mean to do it. Nurse says it was a most \'unfortunate\r\naccident.\' I asked her what an accident was. She says it\'s a thing that\r\nhappens when you don\'t expect it--a surprise, she called it. I\'m sure\r\nit was a dreadful surprise to me, and to Fritz, too; but I\'ll never play\r\nball in the hall again, _never_!"\r\n\r\nA week later, and Sir Edward was in his study, absorbed in his books and\r\npapers, when there was a knock at his door, and, to his astonishment,\r\nhis little niece walked in. This was so against all rules and\r\nregulations that his voice was very stern as he said,--\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of this intrusion, Millicent? You know you are\r\nnever allowed to disturb me when here."\r\n\r\nMilly did not answer for a moment. She walked up to her uncle, her small\r\nlips tightly closed, and then, standing in front of him with clasped\r\nhands, she said,--\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come to tell you some dreadful news."\r\n\r\nSir Edward pushed aside his papers, adjusted his glasses, and saw from\r\nthe pallor of the child\'s face and the scared expression in her eyes,\r\nthat it was no light matter that had made her venture into his presence\r\nuncalled for.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a dreadful surprise again," Milly continued, "but I told nurse I\r\nmust tell you at once. I--I felt so bad here," and her little hand was\r\nlaid pathetically on her chest.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is it? Out with it, child! You are wasting my time," said\r\nher uncle impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I have--I have broken something else."\r\n\r\nThere was silence. Then Sir Edward asked drily,--\r\n\r\n"And what is it now?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a--a flower-pot, that the gardener\'s boy left outside the\r\ntool-house. I--I--well, I put it on Fritz\'s head for a hat, you know. He\r\ndid look so funny, but he tossed up his head and ran away, and it fell,\r\nand it is smashed to bits. I have got the bits outside the door on the\r\nmat. Shall I bring them in?"\r\n\r\nA flower-pot was of such small value in Sir Edward\'s eyes that he almost\r\nsmiled at the child\'s distress.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, you must learn not to touch the flower-pots in future. Now\r\nrun away, and do not disturb me again."\r\n\r\nBut Milly stood her ground.\r\n\r\n"I think you have forgot, Uncle Edward. You told me that if I broke\r\nanything again you would punish me \'_most_ severely.\' Those were the\r\nwords you said; don\'t you remember?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward pulled the ends of his moustache and fidgeted uneasily in his\r\nchair. He always prided himself upon being a man of his word, but much\r\nregretted at the present moment that he had been so rash in his speech.\r\n\r\n"Oh! ah! I remember," he said at length, meeting his little niece\'s\r\nanxious gaze with some embarrassment. Then pulling himself together, he\r\nadded sternly,--\r\n\r\n"Of course you must be punished; it was exceedingly careless and\r\nmischievous. What does your nurse do when she punishes you?"\r\n\r\n"She never does punish me--not now," said Milly plaintively. "When I was\r\na very little girl I used to stand in the corner. I don\'t think nurse\r\nhas punished me for years."\r\n\r\nSir Edward was in a dilemma; children\'s punishments were quite unknown\r\nto him. Milly seemed to guess at his difficulty.\r\n\r\n"How were you punished when you were a little boy, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"I used to be well thrashed. Many is the whipping that I have had from\r\nmy father!"\r\n\r\n"What is a whipping--like you gave Fritz when he went into the game\r\nwood?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. The child clasped her little hands tighter, and set\r\nher lips firmer, as she saw before her eyes a strong arm dealing very\r\nheavy strokes with a riding-whip. Then she said in an awe-struck tone,--\r\n\r\n"And do you think that is how you had better punish me?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward smiled grimly as he looked at the baby figure standing so\r\nerect before him.\r\n\r\n"No," he said; "I do not think you are a fit subject for that kind of\r\ntreatment."\r\n\r\nMilly heaved a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you know how to punish," she said after some minutes of\r\nawkward silence. There was commiseration in her tone. The situation was\r\nbecoming ludicrous to Sir Edward, though there was a certain amount of\r\nannoyance at feeling his inability to carry out his threat.\r\n\r\n"Nurse told me," continued his little niece gravely, "that she knew a\r\nlittle boy who was shut up in a dark cupboard for a punishment; but he\r\nwas found nearly dead, and really died the next day, from fright. There\r\nis a dark cupboard on the kitchen stairs. I don\'t think I should be very\r\nfrightened, because God will be in there with me. Do you think that\r\nwould do?"\r\n\r\nThis was not acceptable. The child went on with knitted brows:\r\n\r\n"I expect the Bible will tell you how to punish. I remember a man who\r\npicked up sticks on Sunday--he was stoned dead; and Elisha\'s servant was\r\nmade a leper, and some children were killed by a bear, and a prophet by\r\na lion, and Annas and Sophia were struck dead. All of them were punished\r\n\'most severely,\' weren\'t they? If you forgave me a little bit, and left\r\nout the \'most severely,\' it would make it easier, I expect."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I might do that," said poor Sir Edward, who by this time longed\r\nto dispense with the punishment altogether; "as it was only a\r\nflower-pot, I will leave out the \'most severely.\'"\r\n\r\nMilly\'s face brightened.\r\n\r\n"I think," she said, coming up to him and laying one hand on his\r\nknee--"I think if I were to go to bed instead of coming down to dessert\r\nwith you this evening, that would punish me; don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Very well, that will do. Now run away, and let this be your last\r\nbreakage. I cannot be worried with your punishments."\r\n\r\n"I will try to be very good, nurse, always," said Milly while being\r\ntucked up in bed that night, "because Uncle Edward is very puzzled when\r\nhe has to punish me. He doesn\'t know what to do. He looked quite unhappy\r\nand said it worried him."\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Edward as he finished his dinner in silence and solitude\r\nmuttered to himself,--\r\n\r\n"That child is certainly a great nuisance at times, but, upon my word, I\r\nquite miss her this evening. Children after all are original, if they\r\nare nothing else, and she is one of the most original that I have ever\r\nmet."\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday morning, and Sir Edward was just starting for church. As\r\nhe stood over the blazing fire in the hall buttoning a glove, a little\r\nvoice came to him from the staircase:\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward, may I come down and speak to you?"\r\n\r\nPermission being given, Milly danced down the stairs, and then, slipping\r\nher little hand into her uncle\'s, she lifted a coaxing face to his.\r\n\r\n"Will you take me to church with you? Nurse thinks I\'m almost big enough\r\nnow, and I have been to church in the afternoon sometimes."\r\n\r\nSir Edward hesitated. "If you come, you will fidget, I expect. I cannot\r\nstand that."\r\n\r\n"I will sit as still as a mouse. I won\'t fidget."\r\n\r\n"If you behave badly I shall never take you again. Yes, you may come. Be\r\nquick and get ready."\r\n\r\nA few moments after, Sir Edward and his little niece were walking down\r\nthe avenue, she clasping a large Bible under her arm, and trying in vain\r\nto match her steps with his.\r\n\r\nThe squire\'s pew was one of the old-fashioned high ones, and Milly\'s\r\nhead did not reach the top of it. Very quiet and silent she was during\r\nthe service, and very particular to follow her uncle\'s example in every\r\nrespect, though she nearly upset his gravity at the outset by taking off\r\nher hat in imitation of him and covering her face with it. But when the\r\nsermon commenced her large dark eyes were riveted on the clergyman as he\r\ngave out the text so well known to her:--\r\n\r\n"_I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I\r\nhave sinned against Heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be\r\ncalled thy son_"; and though the sermon was half an hour in length, her\r\ngaze never left the pulpit.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward," she said, when their steps at length turned homewards,\r\n"do you know, I heard all the sermon, and understood it pretty well\r\nexcept the long words. Wasn\'t it nice to hear about the probable son?"\r\n\r\n"\'Prodigal,\' you mean. Cannot you pronounce your words properly?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward\'s tone was irritable. He had not been feeling very\r\ncomfortable under the good vicar\'s words.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say that; I always forget it. Nurse says one long word is as\r\ngood as another sometimes. Uncle, what did the clergyman mean by people\r\nrunning away from God? No one does, do they?"\r\n\r\n"A great many do," was the dry response.\r\n\r\n"But how can they? Because God is everywhere. No one can\'t get away\r\nfrom God, and why do they want to? Because God loves them so."\r\n\r\n"Why did the prodigal want to get away?"\r\n\r\nMilly considered.\r\n\r\n"I s\'pose he wanted to have some a--aventures, don\'t you call them? I\r\nplay at that, you know. All sorts of things happen to me before I sit\r\ndown at the beech tree, but--but it\'s so different with God. Why, I\r\nshould be fearful unhappy if I got away from Him. I couldn\'t, could I,\r\nuncle? Who would take care of me and love me when I\'m asleep? And who\r\nwould listen to my prayers? Why, Uncle Edward, I think I should die of\r\nfright if I got away from God. Do tell me I couldn\'t."\r\n\r\nMilly had stopped short, and grasped hold of Sir Edward\'s coat in her\r\ngrowing excitement. He glanced at her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n"You foolish child, there is no fear of your getting away from God.\r\nDon\'t be so excitable. We will change the subject. I want to see\r\nMaxwell, so we will go through the wood."\r\n\r\nMaxwell was Sir Edward\'s head game-keeper, and a little later found them\r\nat his pretty cottage at the edge of the wood. It was Milly\'s first\r\nvisit, and Mrs. Maxwell, a motherly-looking body, greeted her with such\r\na sunshiny smile that the child drew near to her instinctively.\r\n\r\n"What a lovely room," she exclaimed, looking round the homely little\r\nkitchen with a child\'s admiring eyes, "and what a beautiful cat! May I\r\nstroke her?"\r\n\r\nAssent being given, Milly was soon seated in a large cushioned chair, a\r\nfat tabby cat on her lap, and while Sir Edward was occupied with his\r\nkeeper she was making fast friends with the wife.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward," she said, when they had taken their leave and were\r\nwalking homewards, "Mrs. Maxwell has asked me to go to tea with her\r\nto-morrow. May I--all by myself?"\r\n\r\n"Ask your nurse; I have no objection."\r\n\r\n"I should love to live in her house," continued the child eagerly; "it\r\nis all among the trees, and I love trees. And this wood is so lovely.\r\nWhy, I might get lost in it, mightn\'t I? I have never been here before.\r\nIn my story-books, children always get lost in a wood. Uncle Edward, do\r\nyou think the trees talk to one another? I always think they do. Look\r\nat them now. They are just shaking their heads together and whispering,\r\naren\'t they? Whispering very gently to-day, because it is Sunday.\r\nSometimes they get angry with one another and scream, but I like to hear\r\nthem hum and sing best. Nurse says it\'s the wind that makes them do it.\r\nDon\'t you like to hear them? When I lie in bed I listen to them around\r\nthe house, and I always want to sing with them. Nurse doesn\'t like it.\r\nShe says it\'s the wind moaning. I think it\'s the trees singing to God,\r\nand I love them when they do it. Which do you think it is?"\r\n\r\nAnd so Milly chatted on, and Sir Edward listened, and put in a word or\r\ntwo occasionally, and on the whole did not find his small niece bad\r\ncompany. He told her when they entered the house that she could go to\r\nchurch every Sunday morning in future with him, and that sent Milly to\r\nthe nursery with a radiant face, there to confide to nurse that she had\r\nhad a "lovely time," and was going to tea as often as she might with\r\n"Mrs. Maxwell in the wood."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. MAXWELL\'S SORROW.\r\n\r\nMilly spent a very happy afternoon at the keeper\'s cottage the next day,\r\nand came down to dessert in the evening so full of her visit that she\r\ncould talk of nothing else.\r\n\r\n"They were so kind to me, uncle. Mrs. Maxwell made a hot currant cake on\r\npurpose for me, and the cat had a red ribbon for company, and we sat by\r\nthe fire and talked when Maxwell was out, and she told me such lovely\r\nstories, and I saw a beautiful picture of the probable son in the best\r\nparlor, and Mrs. Maxwell took it down and let me have a good look at it.\r\nI am going to save up my money and buy one just like it for my nursery,\r\nand do you know, uncle--"\r\n\r\nShe stopped short, but not for want of breath. Putting her curly head on\r\none side, she surveyed her uncle for a minute meditatively, then asked,\r\na little doubtfully:\r\n\r\n"Can you keep a secret, Uncle Edward? Because I would like to tell you,\r\nonly, you see, Mrs. Maxwell doesn\'t talk about it, and I told her I\r\nwouldn\'t--at least, not to the servants, you know."\r\n\r\n"I think you can trust me," Sir Edward said gravely.\r\n\r\n"This is it, then, and I think it\'s so wonderful. They have got a real\r\nlive probable son."\r\n\r\nSir Edward raised his eyebrows. His little niece continued:\r\n\r\n"Yes, they really have. It was when I was talking about the picture Mrs.\r\nMaxwell took the corner of her apron and wiped her eyes, and said she\r\nhad a dear son who had run away from home, and she hadn\'t seen him for\r\nnine years. Just fancy! Where was I nine years ago?"\r\n\r\n"Not born."\r\n\r\n"But I must have been somewhere," and Milly\'s active little brain now\r\nstarted another train of thought, until she got fairly bewildered.\r\n\r\n"I expect I was fast asleep in God\'s arms," she said at length, with\r\nknitted brows; "only, of course, I don\'t remember," and having settled\r\nthat point to her satisfaction, she continued her story:\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Maxwell\'s \'probable son\' is called Tommy. He ran away when he was\r\nseventeen because he didn\'t like the blacksmith\'s shop. Mrs. Maxwell and\r\nI cried about him. He had such curly hair, and stood six feet in his\r\nstockings, and he was a _beautiful_ baby when he was little, and had\r\ncroup and--and confusions, and didn\'t come to for four hours; but he\r\nwould run away, though he laid the fire and put sticks on it and drew\r\nthe water for Mrs. Maxwell before he went. And Mrs. Maxwell says he may\r\nbe a soldier or a sailor now for all she knows, and he may be drownded\r\ndead, or run over, or have both his legs shot to pieces, or he may be in\r\nIndia with the blacks; but I told her he was very likely taking care of\r\nsome pigs somewhere, and she got happy a little bit then, and we dried\r\nour tears, and she gave me some peppermint to suck. Isn\'t it a wonderful\r\nstory, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Very wonderful," was the response.\r\n\r\n"Well, we were in the middle of talking when Maxwell came in, so we\r\nhushed, because Mrs. Maxwell said, \'It makes my man so sad\'; but, do you\r\nknow, when Maxwell was bringing me home through the wood he asked me\r\nwhat we had been talking about, and he said he knew it was about the\r\nboy because he could see it in Mrs. Maxwell\'s eye. And then I asked him\r\nif he would run and kiss Tommy when he came back, and if he would make a\r\nfeast; and he said he would do anything to get him home again."\r\n\r\nMilly paused, then said wistfully,--\r\n\r\n"I wish I had a father, Uncle Edward. You see, nurse does for a mother,\r\nbut fathers are so fond of their children, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"It does not always follow that they are," Sir Edward replied.\r\n\r\n"The probable son\'s father loved him, and Maxwell loves Tommy, and then\r\nthere was David, you know, who really had a wicked son, with long\r\nhair--I forget his name--and he cried dreadful when he was dead. I\r\nsometimes tell God about it when I\'m in bed, and then He--He just seems\r\nto put His arms round me and send me off to sleep; at least, I think He\r\ndoes. Nurse says God likes me to call Him my Father, but of course that\r\nisn\'t quite the same as having a father I can see. Maxwell is a very\r\nnice father, I think. I told him I would pray for Tommy every night when\r\nI go to bed, and then I told him that God had lots of probable sons,\r\ntoo--the clergyman said so on Sunday, didn\'t he?--people who have run\r\naway from Him. I\'ve been asking God to make them come back. I hope He\r\nwill let me know when they do. Do you know any one who has run away from\r\nGod, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"You are chattering too much, child," said Sir Edward irritably; "sit\r\nstill and be quiet."\r\n\r\nMilly instantly obeyed, and after some moments of silence her uncle\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind your going to Maxwell\'s cottage, but you must never take\r\nFritz with you. He is not allowed in that wood at all. Do you quite\r\nunderstand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I\'m very sorry, for Fritz doesn\'t like being left behind; the\r\ntears were in his eyes when nurse told him he wasn\'t to go with me. You\r\nsee, no one talks to him like I do. He likes me to tell him stories, and\r\nI told him when I came back about my visit, so he wants to go. But I\r\nwon\'t take him with me if you say no."\r\n\r\nWhen she was leaving him that night for bed, she paused a moment as she\r\nwished him good-night.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward, when you say your prayers to-night, will you ask God to\r\nmake Tommy come back home? His mother does want him so badly."\r\n\r\n"I will leave you to do that," was the curt reply.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you don\'t want to pray for Tommy, pray for God\'s probable\r\nsons, won\'t you? Do, Uncle Edward. Mrs. Maxwell said the only thing that\r\ncomforted her is asking God to bring Tommy back."\r\n\r\nSir Edward made no reply, only dismissed her more peremptorily than\r\nusual, and when she had left the room he leaned his arms on the chimney\r\npiece, and resting his head on them, gazed silently into the fire with a\r\nknitted brow. His thoughts did not soothe him, for he presently raised\r\nhis head with a short laugh, saying to himself,--\r\n\r\n"Where is my cigar-case? I will go and have a smoke to get rid of this\r\nfit of the blues. I shall have to curb that child\'s tongue a little. She\r\nis getting too troublesome."\r\n\r\nAnd while he was pacing moodily up and down the terrace outside, a\r\nlittle white-robed figure, with bent head and closed eyes, was saying\r\nsoftly and reverently as she knelt at her nurse\'s knee--\r\n\r\n"And, O God, bring Tommy back, and don\'t let him be a probable son any\r\nmore. Bring him home very soon, please, and will you bring back all your\r\nprobable sons who are running away from you, for Jesus Christ\'s sake.\r\nAmen."\r\n\r\nSir Edward did not escape several visits from ladies in the neighborhood\r\noffering to befriend his little niece, but all these overtures were\r\ncourteously and firmly rejected. He told them the child was happy with\r\nher nurse, he did not wish her to mix with other children at present,\r\nand a year or two hence would be quite time enough to think about her\r\neducation. So Milly was left alone, more than one mother remarking with\r\na shake of the head--\r\n\r\n"It\'s a sad life for a child, but Sir Edward is peculiar, and when he\r\ngets a notion into his head he keeps to it."\r\n\r\nThe child was not unhappy, and when the days grew shorter, and her\r\nrambles out of doors were curtailed, she would lie on the tiger-skin by\r\nthe hall fire with Fritz for the hour together, pouring out to him all\r\nher childish confidences.\r\n\r\nSometimes her uncle would find her perched on the broad window-seat\r\nhalf-way up the staircase, with her little face pressed against the\r\nwindowpanes, and late on one very cold afternoon in November he\r\nremonstrated with her.\r\n\r\n"It is too cold for you here, Millicent," he said sternly; "you ought to\r\nbe in the nursery."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t feel cold," she replied. "I don\'t like being in the nursery all\r\nday; and when it gets dark, nurse will have the lamp lit and the\r\ncurtains drawn, and then there are only the walls and ceiling and the\r\npictures to look at. I\'m tired of them; I see them every day."\r\n\r\n"And what do you see here?" asked Sir Edward.\r\n\r\n"You come and sit down, and I will tell you. There\'s room, uncle; make\r\nFritz move a little. Now, you look out with me. I can see such a lot\r\nfrom this window. I like looking out right into the world; don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Are we not in the world? I thought we were."\r\n\r\n"I s\'pose we are, but I mean God\'s world. The insides of houses aren\'t\r\nHis world, are they? Do you see my trees? I can see Goliath from this\r\nwindow; he looks very fierce to-night; he has lost all his leaves, and I\r\ncan almost hear him muttering to himself. And then, uncle, do you see\r\nthose nice thin trees cuddling each other? I call those David and\r\nJon\'than; they\'re just kissing each other, like they did in the wood,\r\nyou know. Do you remember? And there\'s my beech-tree over there, where I\r\nsit when I\'m the probable son. It\'s too dark for you to see all the\r\nothers. I have names for them all nearly, but I like to come and watch\r\nthem, and then I see the stars just beginning to come out. Do you know\r\nwhat I think about the stars? They\'re angels\' eyes, and they look down\r\nand blink at me so kindly, and then I look up and blink back. We go on\r\nblinking at each other sometimes till I get quite sleepy. I watch the\r\nbirds going to bed too. There is so much I can see from this window."\r\n\r\n"Well, run along to the nursery now; you have been here long enough."\r\n\r\nMilly jumped down from her seat obediently; then catching hold of her\r\nuncle\'s hand as he was moving away, she said,--\r\n\r\n"Just one thing more I want to show you, uncle. I can see the high-road\r\nfor such a long way over there, and when it is not quite so dark I sit\r\nand watch for Tommy--that\'s Maxwell\'s probable son, you know. I should\r\nbe so glad if I were to see him coming along one day with his head\r\nhanging down, and all ragged and torn. He is sure to come some day--God\r\nwill bring him--and if I see him coming first, I shall run off quick to\r\nMaxwell and tell him, and then he will run out to meet him. Won\'t it be\r\nlovely?"\r\n\r\nAnd with shining eyes Milly shook back her brown curls and looked up\r\ninto her uncle\'s face for sympathy. He patted her head, the nearest\r\napproach to a caress that he ever gave her, and left her without saying\r\na word.\r\n\r\nAnother day, later still, he came upon her at the staircase window. He\r\nwas dining out that night, and was just leaving the house, but stopped\r\nas he noticed his little niece earnestly waving her handkerchief up at\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing now?" he inquired as he passed down the stairs.\r\nMilly turned round, her little face flushed, and eyes looking very sweet\r\nand serious.\r\n\r\n"I was just waving to God, Uncle Edward. I thought I saw Him looking\r\ndown at me from the sky."\r\n\r\nSir Edward passed on, muttering inaudibly,--\r\n\r\n"I believe that child lives in the presence of God from morning to\r\nnight".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRODIGAL.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward, nurse and I are going shopping; would you like us to buy\r\nyou anything? We are going in the dog-cart with Harris."\r\n\r\nMilly was dancing up and down on the rug inside the front door as she\r\nspoke. It was a bright, frosty morning, and Sir Edward was leaving the\r\nbreakfast-room with the newspaper and a large packet of letters in his\r\nhand. He stopped and glanced at the little fur-clad figure as she stood\r\nthere, eager anticipation written on her face, and his thoughts went\r\nback to the time when he as a boy looked upon a day\'s visit to the\r\nneighboring town--nine miles away--as one of his greatest pleasures.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, slowly fumbling in his waistcoat pocket; "you can get me\r\nsome pens and blotting paper at the stationer\'s. I will write down the\r\nkind I want, and here is the money. Keep the change, and buy anything\r\nyou like with it."\r\n\r\nMilly\'s cheeks flushed with delight as she took the money--\r\n\r\n"What a lot it will buy!" she said. "Thank you very much indeed. I was\r\nwanting to buy something my own self, and I\'ve only a little cook gave\r\nme, but now I shall be quite rich."\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when nurse and her little charge drove\r\nback, and Sir Edward met them coming up the avenue. Milly\'s face was\r\nclouded, and there were traces of tears on her cheeks, and this was such\r\nan unusual sight that Sir Edward inquired of the nurse what was the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n"She has not been good, sir, I am sorry to say. It isn\'t often that I\r\nhave to pull her up, but she has given me such a fright and trouble this\r\nafternoon as I am not likely to forget in a hurry."\r\n\r\n"What has she been doing? But never mind; I will not detain you now. I\r\ncan hear about it when we get in."\r\n\r\nNurse was evidently very disturbed in mind, for she poured into Sir\r\nEdward\'s ear, directly they were inside the hall, a confused story:--\r\n\r\n"I was in the grocer\'s, sir, and I knew I should be there some time; for\r\ncook, she gave me so many commissions I had to write a long list of\r\nthem. I said to Miss Milly, \'You can stand outside, but don\'t go a step\r\nfarther.\' She knows she is never allowed to speak to such people; I\'ve\r\nknown, as I told her, children being carried bodily off and set down at\r\na street corner with hardly a rag on their backs; and to think of her\r\nmarching off with him, and never a thought of my anxiety--and the way I\r\nwent rushing up and down the streets--and the policemen--they are\r\nperfectly useless to help a person, but can only stare at you and grin.\r\nI\'m sure I never expected to light eyes on her again, and I lost my\r\npurse and my best umbrella; I left them both somewhere, but it was nigh\r\non two hours I spent, and my shopping not near done, and he the greatest\r\nlooking rascal that one might see coming out of jail. I\'m sure I\r\nshouldn\'t have been so angry but to see her smiling face, as if she\r\nhadn\'t done any wrong at all, nor disobeyed me flatly, and most likely\r\nput herself in the way of catching the most infectious disease from the\r\nvery look of him, and run the risk of being robbed and perhaps murdered,\r\nand not an idea in her head that she was a very naughty child, but\r\nquite expected me to see the reasonableness of it all!"\r\n\r\nNurse stopped for breath, whilst Milly\'s hanging head, heaving chest,\r\nand quick sobs showed that by this time nurse\'s words had quite\r\nconvinced her of her wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nSir Edward was surprised at the interest he felt in his little niece\'s\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I cannot understand your story, nurse," he said quietly;\r\n"but I daresay Miss Millicent will tell me herself. Come into the study,\r\nchild, with me."\r\n\r\nHe took her hand in his, and led her away, while nurse looked after him\r\nin astonishment, and Ford, the old butler, standing by, said with great\r\nsolemnity,--\r\n\r\n"You may well stare, nurse. Mark my words, that child will be able to\r\ntwist him round with her little finger one of these days. I see it\r\na-developin\'. It will be a terrible come-down to the master--but there,\r\nI will say that the women always conquer, and they begin it when they\'re\r\nin short frocks."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see the remarkableness in a gentleman taking notice of his own\r\nsister\'s child," returned nurse testily; "the wonder is that he should\r\nhold her at arm\'s length as he does, and treat her as if she were a dog\r\nor a piece of furniture, without any feelings, and she his own flesh and\r\nblood, too. There\'s no \'coming down\' to have a spark of humanity in his\r\nbreast occasionally."\r\n\r\nAnd nurse sailed upstairs, the loss of her purse and umbrella having\r\nconsiderably ruffled her usually even temper.\r\n\r\nSir Edward seated himself by the study fire, and Milly stood before him,\r\none little hand resting upon his knee and the other holding her tiny\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes, and vainly trying to restrain her sobs.\r\n\r\n"Now suppose you stop crying, and tell me what has happened!" her uncle\r\nsaid, feeling moved at seeing his usually self-contained little niece in\r\nsuch grief.\r\n\r\nMilly applied her handkerchief vigorously to her eyes, and looking up\r\nwith quivering lips, she said,--\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to be naughty, uncle. Nurse hasn\'t been angry with me\r\nlike she is now for _years_, and I\'m _so_ unhappy!"\r\n\r\nThe pitiful tone and look touched Sir Edward\'s heart, and, on the\r\nimpulse of the moment, he did what he had never as yet attempted--lifted\r\nher upon his knee, and told her to proceed with her story; and Milly,\r\nafter a final struggle with her tears, got the better of them, and was\r\nable to give him a pretty clear account of what had happened.\r\n\r\n"I had bought your pens and blotting-paper, uncle, and was going to a\r\npicture-shop to spend the rest of my money when nurse had finished at\r\nthe grocer\'s. I was standing outside, when I saw a man coming along. He\r\nlimped, and his hat was broken in, and he was so ragged that I thought\r\nhe must be a probable son, and then I thought he might be Tommy going\r\nhome, and when I thought that, I couldn\'t think of nothing else, and I\r\nforgot all about nurse, and I forgot she told me to stay there, and I\r\nran after him as hard as I could. I caught him up, and he looked very\r\nastonished when I asked him was his name Tommy. He said, \'No,\' and he\r\nlaughed at me, and then I asked him was he a probable son, because he\r\nlooked like one. He said he didn\'t know what kind of person that was.\r\nAnd then I had to explain it to him. He told me he had never had a home\r\nto run away from, so that wouldn\'t do; but he really looked just like\r\nthe man I\'ve seen in Mr. Maxwell\'s picture, and I told him so, and then\r\nI found out what he was, and I was so sorry, and yet I was so glad."\r\n\r\nMilly paused, and her large, expressive eyes shone as she turned them up\r\nto her uncle\'s face, and her voice dropped almost to a whisper as she\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"I found out he was one of God\'s probable sons. When I asked him if he\r\nhad run away from God, he said yes, he supposed he had done that, so of\r\ncourse he was ragged and unhappy."\r\n\r\n"That is not always the case," put in Sir Edward, half touched, half\r\namused. "Sometimes it is very rich people who run away from God, and\r\nthey get richer when they are away from Him."\r\n\r\nMilly looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n"But they can\'t be happy, uncle. Oh, they never can be!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not."\r\n\r\n"Well, I talked to this poor man till we had walked quite away from the\r\nshops, and then he turned down a lane, and I went with him; and we were\r\nboth rather tired, so we sat down together on some doorsteps inside an\r\narchway, and he told me all about himself. His name is Jack, and his\r\nfather and mother are dead, like mine; and he got drunk one night, and\r\nfell down and broke his arm, and then he went to a hospital; and when he\r\ngot well and went back to his work again, his master couldn\'t take him,\r\nbecause some one else was in his place, and he couldn\'t get any work. I\r\nasked him were there no pigs to keep, but he said there weren\'t any in\r\nLondon, and he was there, and for six months, he told me, he had been\r\n\'on the tramp\'; that\'s what he called it. I asked him what that meant,\r\nand he said just walking on every day to no place particular. And he\r\nsaid something about going to the bad, which I couldn\'t quite\r\nunderstand. Then I asked him why he didn\'t go back to God, and he said\r\nhe had been a good boy once, when he went to Sunday-school, and he had a\r\nvery good uncle who kept a baker\'s shop in London, and who wanted him to\r\ngo and live with him, but he wouldn\'t, because he was too good for him.\r\nAnd I asked him why he wouldn\'t go to him now, and he said he couldn\'t\r\ntramp back again to London, it was too far, and he had no money. So\r\nthen I opened my purse, and we counted over my money together, and he\r\nsaid it was just enough to take him back, if I would lend it to him. So,\r\nof course, I did, and he asked me my name and where I lived, and I told\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"The scoundrel!" muttered Sir Edward.\r\n\r\nMilly paused. "Why are you looking so angry, uncle? I was so glad to\r\ngive him the money; and then we talked a good deal, and I begged him not\r\nto be one of God\'s probable sons any more. Fancy! He wouldn\'t believe\r\nGod loved him, and he wouldn\'t believe that God wanted him back! I told\r\nhim I should be quite frightened to get away from God, and he--well, he\r\nalmost didn\'t seem to care; he said no one cared what came of him,\r\nwhether he was hung, dead, or not; and I told him no one cared for me\r\nmuch except nurse, but God did. I feel He loves me, and I know He loves\r\nJack just the same; doesn\'t He, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"And when did nurse find you?" inquired Sir Edward, evading this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMilly\'s little face, which had been gradually brightening with the\r\ninterest of her story, now clouded over again, and she hung her head.\r\n\r\n"She was fearful angry with me. She was quite hot and red, and she\r\nsnatched me away, and said that Jack was a thief and--and a vagbag, or\r\nsomething like that. She scolded me all the way home, and I don\'t think\r\nshe will ever love me again. She said it was just a chance she found me,\r\nand if she hadn\'t come along that lane I should have been lost forever!\r\nAnd she was angry most of all because I shook hands with Jack and wished\r\nhim good-bye. I don\'t think nurse would run and meet a probable son if\r\nshe had one; she thinks all ragged people are wicked. But I\'m--I\'m\r\ndreadful sorry I was disobedient. Do you think I have been very naughty,\r\nUncle Edward?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward twisted the ends of his moustache slowly. "I think you were\r\nnaughty to run after a strange man like that, and I quite understand\r\nnurse\'s displeasure. You made her exceedingly anxious."\r\n\r\n"And is God very angry with me?"\r\n\r\n"God is not pleased with disobedient children."\r\n\r\n"May I kneel down and ask him to forgive me now?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward hesitated. "I think you had better go to the nursery and do\r\nit there."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to see nurse till I have done it. May I? Will you ask God\r\nto forgive me too?"\r\n\r\n"Your prayer will be quite sufficient."\r\n\r\nMilly slipped off his knee, and then, kneeling down with folded hands\r\nand closed eyes, she said softly,--\r\n\r\n"Please God, will you forgive me! I\'m so sorry I disobeyed nurse and ran\r\naway. And please take care of Jack, and bring him back to you, for Jesus\r\nChrist\'s sake. Amen."\r\n\r\n"Now run along to nurse, and don\'t cry any more," said Sir Edward, as he\r\nrose from his seat.\r\n\r\nMilly looked back wistfully as she reached the door.\r\n\r\n"Do you think nurse is still angry?"\r\n\r\n"Tell nurse from me that she is not to scold you any more. The loss of\r\nyour money ought to be a lesson to you."\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t lose it, uncle. I lent it to Jack. He wouldn\'t let me give\r\nit to him; he said he would send it back to me in a letter."\r\n\r\nSir Edward laughed unbelievingly, and Milly trotted upstairs to be\r\nreceived with open arms by nurse at the nursery door.\r\n\r\n"There! never mind, my dear. I have been very angry with you, but\r\nyou\'ll never do such a thing again. Come and have your tea. I\'ve had a\r\ncup already, and feel wonderful better. Now, don\'t cry any more; bless\r\nyour little heart, I can\'t bear to see you in tears."\r\n\r\nWith that nurse took her up in her arms; and poor tired little Milly\r\nwhispered, as she clung to her,--\r\n\r\n"I was afraid you would never love me again. I\'ve told God I\'m sorry; do\r\nyou quite forgive me?"\r\n\r\n"Quite, my lamb," was the reply; "and as to loving you, I shouldn\'t give\r\nover doing that if you were twice as troublesome."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROMISE KEPT.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight later Sir Edward, who always opened the post-bag\r\nhimself, found there a letter addressed to his little niece, and sent a\r\nmessage to the nursery to tell her to come down to him. She arrived very\r\nsurprised at the summons, as Sir Edward always wished to be left\r\nundisturbed at his breakfast, but when she saw the letters on the table\r\nshe cried out joyously,--\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Uncle Edward. I know there\'s a letter from Jack for me,\r\nisn\'t there? I\'ve been waiting for it every day."\r\n\r\n"I think there may be, judging from the writing on the envelope. Come\r\nhere and open it."\r\n\r\nMilly took the letter, and her little fingers fairly trembled with\r\nexcitement as she opened it, saying softly to herself as she did so,--\r\n\r\n"I knew he would keep his promise. I knew he wasn\'t a thief."\r\n\r\nA money order dropped out.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Sir Edward, "you were right, little woman, and we were\r\nwrong. Would you like me to read it for you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, please, uncle."\r\n\r\nThe letter read as follows:--\r\n\r\n  "I am as good as my word, little Miss, in sending\r\n  you back what you lent me with many grateful\r\n  thanks for the loan, as I reached London safe and\r\n  have never touched a drop of drink since I seen\r\n  you, and am in work at my uncle\'s, which is good\r\n  of him to take me, and am getting good wages and\r\n  goes to church again. And my uncle has a chum\r\n  which is a street preacher, and comes along of\r\n  plenty of fellows like I was, and I told him of your\r\n  young fellow, Tommy Maxwell, and he will keep a\r\n  look-out for him. Tell the woman that fetched\r\n  you sharp away that I\'ll hold up my head with her\r\n  yet, and every night I asks God to bless you, for I\r\n  hopes I am getting on the right track again, and\r\n  thank you kindly for your talk, which is sticking to\r\n  me.\r\n\r\n                                "Yours obediently,\r\n\r\n                                          "JACK GRAY."\r\n\r\nSir Edward laid the letter down in silence when he had finished reading\r\nit. Milly\'s face was radiant.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never had a letter in my life before, uncle, but I don\'t quite\r\nunderstand all of it. Will you explain it to me?"\r\n\r\nAnd this her uncle did, sending her upstairs at length to show it to\r\nnurse, but sitting wrapped in thought himself and leaving both his\r\nletters and breakfast untouched for some considerable time.\r\n\r\nThat same day he went out driving in the afternoon with a young horse,\r\nand returning home met a traction engine, at which the horse instantly\r\ntook fright and bolted.\r\n\r\nFor some time Sir Edward kept steadily to his seat, and though powerless\r\nto check the animal\'s course was able to guide it; but in spite of all\r\nhis efforts the trap was at last upset, and he was thrown violently to\r\nthe ground. He had no groom with him, and the accident took place on a\r\nlonely road, so that it was not till an hour later that help came, in\r\nthe shape of a farmer returning from market in his cart. He found Sir\r\nEdward unconscious, and the horse still feebly struggling to extricate\r\nhimself from under the trap, which was badly broken.\r\n\r\nIt was about seven o\'clock in the evening when Sir Edward was brought\r\nhome, and he had three ribs broken, besides some very severe injuries to\r\nhis head. The doctor wished to telegraph for a nurse from London, but\r\nSir Edward had a horror of them, and having recovered consciousness\r\nshook his head vehemently when it was suggested; and so it ended in\r\nMilly\'s nurse volunteering to assist his valet in nursing him. Poor\r\nlittle Milly wandered about the house with Fritz at her heels in a very\r\nwoe-begone fashion. What with the anxiety in her heart lest her uncle\r\nshould die, and the absence of her nurse--who could spare little time\r\nnow to look after her--she felt most forlorn, and her greatest comfort\r\nwas to go down to the keeper\'s cottage and talk to Mrs. Maxwell.\r\n\r\nSir Edward was soon out of danger, but he was a long time recovering,\r\nand required most careful nursing. Milly begged and entreated to go in\r\nand see him, but this was not allowed. At last permission was given by\r\nthe doctor for a very short visit, and the child stole in on tip-toe,\r\nbut insisted upon taking a large brown paper parcel in with her, the\r\ncontents of which were unknown to all except herself.\r\n\r\nSoftly she crept up to the bed and looked at her uncle\'s bandaged head\r\nand worn face with the greatest awe.\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand, which she took in hers, and then she said, her\r\nbrown eyes fixed wistfully on his face,--\r\n\r\n"I\'ve wanted to see you, Uncle Edward, for so long. I wish you would let\r\nme come in and help to nurse you."\r\n\r\nSir Edward smiled, then shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been asking God to make you better so many times," she continued,\r\nsoftly stroking his hand as she spoke, "and He is going to make you live\r\nagain; now isn\'t He? I wasn\'t quite sure whether you mightn\'t like to\r\ndie best, but I didn\'t want you to. Nurse says I mustn\'t stay a moment,\r\nbut I\'ve brought you a present. Maxwell went to the town and got it for\r\nme with the money Jack sent back to me. May I open it for you?"\r\n\r\nReading assent in his eyes, Milly eagerly removed her brown paper, and\r\nthen lifted on to the bed with difficulty a picture of the Prodigal Son,\r\nin a plain oak frame.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a lovely one, Uncle Edward? There\'s the prodigal son--I\'ve\r\nlearned to say it properly now--all in rags hurrying along the road, and\r\nthere\'s his old father in the distance coming to meet him; and can you\r\nsee the words underneath?--_\'I will arise and go to my father, and will\r\nsay unto him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and before thee_.\' I\r\nthought you would like it to look at while you are in bed. May I rest it\r\nagainst the rail at the bottom of your bed?--then you can see it\r\nbeautifully."\r\n\r\nNurse came forward and helped the child to put the picture in the place\r\nshe wished; and Sir Edward tried to look pleased, and said in a low\r\ntone,--\r\n\r\n"Thank you, little one, I can see it well from there"; but under his\r\nbreath he muttered, "Has she a purpose in bringing that everlasting\r\nsubject before me? I\'m sick to death of it. I shall get rid of that\r\npicture when she is gone."\r\n\r\nBut he did not. His eyes grew somewhat wistful as he gazed upon it, and\r\nlater in the day, when nurse asked him if he would like to have it\r\nremoved, he shook his head in the negative.\r\n\r\nNo one could know his thoughts during those long days and nights of\r\nweariness and pain. The restlessness of body did not equal the\r\nrestlessness of soul, and the past came back with a startling vividness.\r\nThe wasted years, the misused talents, and above all, the fast-closed\r\nheart against its rightful Owner, now seemed to stand up in judgment\r\nagainst him. Often in his wretchedness would he groan aloud, and wish\r\nfor unconsciousness to come to his aid and consign to oblivion his\r\naccusing memory.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, gray afternoon. Mrs. Maxwell\'s little kitchen was in\r\nperfect order. The fire shed flickering lights on the bright dish-covers\r\non the wall, and the blue and white china on the old-fashioned dresser\r\nwas touched with a ruddy glow. Mrs. Maxwell herself, seated in a wooden\r\nrocking-chair, in spotless white apron, was knitting busily as she\r\ntalked; and Milly on a low stool, the tabby in her arms, with her\r\ngolden-brown curls in pretty disorder, and her large dark eyes gazing\r\nearnestly into the fire, completed the picture.\r\n\r\n"Do you like winter, Mrs. Maxwell?" she was asking.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, I can\'t say as I don\'t prefer the summer; but\r\nthere!--the Almighty sends it, and it must be right, and I don\'t think\r\nfolks have a right to grumble and go rushing off to them foreign parts,\r\na-leaving their own country and the weather God gives them, because they\r\nsay they must have sunshine. I allays thinks they\'ve no sunshine in\r\ntheir hearts, or they wouldn\'t be so up and down with the weather."\r\n\r\n"I think winter is a very lonely time, Mrs. Maxwell, and I\'m so sorry\r\nfor the trees. I was out this morning with Fritz, and I talked to them\r\nand tried to cheer them up. And I think they feel they\'re nearly dead,\r\npoor things! and they were shivering with cold this morning; they were,\r\nreally. I told them they would be happy when next summer comes, but they\r\nsighed and shook their heads; it\'s such a long time to wait, and they\r\nhave nothing to do--they can only stand still. I was very sad this\r\nmorning. After I had talked to them, I went down to the plantation at\r\nthe bottom of the lawn, and on the way I came to a poor dead frog. Fritz\r\nsniffed at him, but he didn\'t seem to be sorry. I don\'t know how he\r\ndied. I thought perhaps he had stayed out in the cold and got frozen, he\r\nfelt so very cold. I took him up and buried him, and I wondered if his\r\nmother would miss him; and then I went on a little farther, and there\r\nwere some little bird\'s feathers all in a heap on the ground. I felt\r\nsure a cruel cat had been eating it up, and I couldn\'t help crying, for\r\neverything seemed to be dying. And when I got to the plantation I was a\r\nlittle comforted, for the fir-trees looked so comfortable and warm--they\r\nhadn\'t lost their leaves like the other trees--but do you know, in the\r\nmiddle of them all was a tall, thin, bare tree--he looked so lonely and\r\nunhappy, and he was the only one without any leaves."\r\n\r\n"One of those birches, I expect. My man, he said the other day that the\r\nfir plantation yonder wanted weeding out."\r\n\r\n"Well, I couldn\'t bear to see him so sad, so I crept right in amongst\r\nthe firs until I got to him, and then I put my arms right round him and\r\ncuddled him tight. I told him God would take care of him, and give him a\r\nbeautiful new green dress next summer; but he seemed to feel the cold,\r\nand I expect the other trees aren\'t very kind to him. I always think the\r\nfirs are very stiff and proud. I--I kissed him before I came away. It\r\nwas a sad morning."\r\n\r\nMilly\'s tone was truly pathetic, and Mrs. Maxwell, who loved to hear her\r\nchildish fancies and never laughed at them, now looked up from her\r\nknitting sympathetically--\r\n\r\n"You\'re sad yourself, dear. Is your uncle pretty well to-day?"\r\n\r\n"I think he is getting better, but he mustn\'t talk, and nurse won\'t let\r\nme see him. I think it\'s winter makes me sad, Mrs. Maxwell."\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a few moments. Milly stroked her cat thoughtfully,\r\nthen she said,--\r\n\r\n"If Uncle Edward had died, what would have happened to me? Should I have\r\nhad to go to the workhouse?"\r\n\r\n"Bless your little heart, no! Why, my man and I was saying the other day\r\nthat it\'s most sure as you\'ll be mistress of the property one day. Sir\r\nEdward he have no other kith or kin, as far as we know. Workhouse,\r\nindeed! A place where they takes in tramps and vagabonds."\r\n\r\n"I heard some of the maids talking about it," pursued Milly; "they said\r\nthey wondered what would happen to me. I think he is my only uncle, so I\r\ncouldn\'t go anywhere else. I wish I had a father, Mrs. Maxwell, I\'m\r\nalways wishing for one. I never remember my father. My mother I do, but\r\nshe was always ill, and she didn\'t like me to bother her. Do you know, I\r\nthought when I came to Uncle Edward that he would be a kind of father;\r\nMiss Kent said he would. But I\'m afraid he doesn\'t like me to bother him\r\neither. I should like him to take me up in his arms and kiss me. Do you\r\nthink he ever will? I feel as if no one cares for me sometimes."\r\n\r\n"I think a certain little apple dumpling as I put in the oven for some\r\none is smelling as if it wants to come out," was Mrs. Maxwell\'s brisk\r\nresponse as she bustled out of her chair, her old eyes moist with\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Milly\'s pensiveness had disappeared. A baked apple\r\ndumpling had great charms for her, and no one would have believed that\r\nthe light-hearted child with the merry laugh, now dancing around the\r\nroom, and climbing up to the dresser for a plate, was the same as the\r\none who had so sadly discoursed a few moments before on the mournfulness\r\nof winter and of her orphaned state.\r\n\r\n"Did you make such nice apple dumplings for Tommy?" she asked presently,\r\nbusy with her fork and spoon, and looking supremely content with\r\nherself and surroundings.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Didn\'t I? I mind when he used to come in on Saturdays from the\r\nforge, I always had a hot pudding for him. He used to say there was no\r\none as cooked as well as mother."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a long time coming home, isn\'t he, Mrs. Maxwell? I get so tired of\r\nwaiting. I wish he would come for Christmas."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not tired of waiting," Mrs. Maxwell said softly, "and I\'ve waited\r\nthese nine years, but it sometimes seems as if it is only yesterday as\r\nhe went off. I feel at times like fretting sadly over him, and wish I\r\nknew if he was alive or dead, but then the Lord do comfort one, and I\r\nknow He sees just where he is, and He\'ll let me know when the right time\r\ncomes."\r\n\r\n"I\'m expecting him every day," said Milly with a cheerful little nod. "I\r\nwas telling God about him last night at my window on the stairs--and it\r\nseemed as if God said to me that he was coming very soon now. I\r\nshouldn\'t wonder if he came next week!"\r\n\r\nThe keeper entered the cottage at this moment, and Milly jumped off her\r\nseat at once.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it\'s time for me to be going back. Nurse said I was to be in\r\nat four. Are you going to take me, Maxwell?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I always see you safe and sound up at the house?" Maxwell said\r\ngood-humoredly, "and do you know it has struck four ten minutes ago?\r\nWhen you and my old woman get together to have a crack, as the saying\r\nis, you don\'t know how time passes. We shall have to run for it."\r\n\r\nMilly was being rapidly covered up in a thick plaid by Mrs. Maxwell.\r\n\r\n"There now, my dearie, good-bye till next I see you, and don\'t be\r\ndoleful in that big house by yourself. Your uncle will soon be well, and\r\nnurse will be better able to see after you. I don\'t know what all those\r\nservants are after that they can\'t amuse you a bit."\r\n\r\n"Nurse doesn\'t like me ever to go near the servants\' hall," said Milly;\r\n"I promised her I wouldn\'t. Sarah stays in the nursery with me, but she\r\nruns away downstairs pretty often. Good-bye, Mrs. Maxwell."\r\n\r\nIt was getting dark. Maxwell soon had the child in his strong arms, and\r\nwas striding along at a great pace, when passing a rather dark corner, a\r\nman suddenly sprang out of the bushes and took to his heels.\r\n\r\nMaxwell shouted out wrathfully: "Let me see you in here again, and it\r\nwill be the worse for you, you scoundrel!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Maxwell," cried Milly, "who is it?"\r\n\r\n"One of them skulking poachers--they\'re always in here after the\r\nrabbits. If I hadn\'t a-had you to look after and had my thick stick I\r\nwould a-been after him."\r\n\r\n"But you wouldn\'t have hurt him?"\r\n\r\n"I should have taught him a lesson, that I should!"\r\n\r\n"But, Maxwell, you mustn\'t, really! Only think, he might be--Tommy\r\ncoming home! You couldn\'t see who it was, could you? It would be\r\ndreadful if you chased away Tommy."\r\n\r\n"No fear o\' that," Maxwell said in a quieter tone. "My own son wouldn\'t\r\nskulk along like that. He was a ragged vagabond, that\'s what he was."\r\n\r\n"Prodigal sons are nearly always ragged. He might have been some one\'s\r\nprodigal son, Maxwell."\r\n\r\n"He was just a poacher, my dear, and I think I know the chap. He\'s\r\nstaying at the Blue Dragon, and has been a-watching this place for some\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he is one of God\'s prodigal sons," said Milly softly, "like\r\nJack was."\r\n\r\nTo this Maxwell made no reply, but when he set her down in the\r\nbrightly-lighted hall a little later, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you fret about our Tommy. I should know him fast enough. He\r\nwouldn\'t run from his own father."\r\n\r\nAnd Milly went in, and that night added another petition to her\r\nprayers:--\r\n\r\n"And please God, if the man who ran away from Maxwell is a prodigal son,\r\nbring him back to his father for Jesus\' sake. Amen."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSS-EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n"Nurse, where is Miss Millicent? I haven\'t seen her for days. Fetch her\r\nin here this afternoon, and you go and get a little fresh air; I am well\r\nenough to be left alone now."\r\n\r\nSir Edward\'s tone was impatient. He was getting to the convalescent\r\nstage, and nurse found him a most trying patient. Nothing would please\r\nhim, and he wearied both himself and her with his perpetual complaints.\r\n\r\n"I thought she would only worry you, sir. She has been asking me every\r\nday to come in and see you. I will fetch her at once."\r\n\r\nMilly shortly appeared in a clean pinafore, her little face radiant with\r\nsmiles. As she climbed up into the chair by the bedside and gently\r\nstroked the hand that was given her, she said with sparkling eyes,--\r\n\r\n"Nurse says I may stay here all alone with you, uncle; won\'t that be\r\nlovely? May I give you your medicines, and be your nurse?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t promise that, but you may sit there and talk to me."\r\n\r\n"What shall I talk about?"\r\n\r\n"Anything you like. You never seem to be at a loss for conversation."\r\n\r\nMilly considered for a moment.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had so few people to talk to lately, you see; I generally talk\r\nmost to Fritz. He understands, I\'m sure, but he doesn\'t talk back. When\r\nwill you be quite well again, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Not this side of Christmas, I\'m afraid."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, what a long time! But I\'m very glad God has made you better.\r\nNurse said it was a mercy you hadn\'t broken your neck. Do you know,\r\nuncle, I saw such a sad sight yesterday morning. I was down in the fir\r\nplantation with Fritz, and we came upon a dear little rabbit caught in a\r\nsteel trap. Maxwell said a poacher had put it there, and he was very\r\nangry. The rabbit was quite dead, and his two hind legs were broken.\r\nWasn\'t it dreadful? What is a poacher, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"A thief--a man that steals game that isn\'t his."\r\n\r\n"Maxwell says there are lots of poachers about. I\'m so afraid he will\r\nthink Tommy is one when he comes back. I do hope he will be careful,\r\nbecause if it\'s dark he might make a mistake. Wouldn\'t it be dreadful if\r\nhe hurt his own prodigal son! And I expect Tommy will look very like a\r\npoacher. He is sure to have ragged, dirty clothes. If I was----" Here\r\nMilly paused, and gazed dreamily in front of her for some minutes in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Well?" inquired Sir Edward, looking at his little niece with interest\r\nas she sat in her big chair, her elbows supported by her knees, and her\r\nchin resting in her hands, "are you going into a brown study?"\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking if I was a prodigal son--I mean a real one, not\r\njust playing at it, as I do--I would rather be one of God\'s prodigal\r\nsons, than belonging to any one else."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I would know for certain He would meet me and take me back.\r\nNurse told me she had a cousin who ran away and made himself a soldier,\r\nand when he was sorry and wanted to come home, his father shut the door\r\nin his face, and wouldn\'t let him in. And then there\'s Tommy, I can\'t\r\nhelp s\'posing that his father mightn\'t know him. But God can\'t make\r\nmistakes. It must be lovely just to run right into God\'s arms, and hear\r\nHim saying, _\'Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him.\'_ I should\r\nlove to have Him say that to me."\r\n\r\nMilly\'s little face glowed with pleasure at the thought, and she turned\r\nher expressive eyes toward her uncle, who lay with knitted brows\r\nlistening to her.\r\n\r\n"And supposing if God would not receive you; supposing you had stayed\r\naway so long, and had refused to listen to His voice when He called, and\r\nthen when you did want to come back, you felt it would be too late, what\r\nwould you do then?"\r\n\r\nMilly smiled.\r\n\r\n"Why, uncle, it would be never too late for God, would it? Maxwell said\r\nhe would be glad to see Tommy if he came back in the middle of the\r\nnight, and God would never turn one of his prodigal sons away. He loves\r\nthem so that he sent Jesus to die for them. He would never say He\r\ncouldn\'t have them back again."\r\n\r\nSir Edward said no more, and after another pause the child went on.\r\n\r\n"I was asking Mrs. Maxwell the other day if she had some best clothes\r\nfor Tommy when he came home, and she took me upstairs into his little\r\nroom, and opened a long drawer, and told me to look inside. And there\r\nwere his best Sunday coat and waistcoat and trousers, and a silk\r\nhandkerchief with lavender in it, and a necktie with yellow and red\r\nstripes, and she told me they had been there for nine years, and she\r\nshakes them out and brushes them every Saturday. He didn\'t run away in\r\nhis best clothes, you know; he left them behind. So they\'re quite ready\r\nfor him. The only thing Mrs. Maxwell hasn\'t got is the ring."\r\n\r\n"The what?" inquired Sir Edward, amused.\r\n\r\n"The ring," Milly repeated earnestly. "Maxwell will have to say, \'_Put a\r\nring on his hand, and shoes on his feet_.\' Mrs. Maxwell has got a pair\r\nof carpet slippers. I couldn\'t bear her not having any shoes ready for\r\nhim, so we looked about and found a pair that are just too small for\r\nMaxwell, and I put them in the drawer my own self. Mrs. Maxwell says he\r\nwon\'t want a ring, and that she thinks the Bible people dressed\r\ndifferently, and she said Tommy was a poor man\'s son: it wasn\'t as if he\r\nwas rich. But I don\'t know; I don\'t like to think we have no ring for\r\nhim. I suppose you haven\'t one, uncle, that you would like to give him?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward put his head back on his cushions and laughed aloud. Then,\r\nnoting Milly\'s troubled face, he said:\r\n\r\n"Wait till Tommy comes back, little woman, and then it will be time\r\nenough to see about his ring, though I quite agree with his mother that\r\nit would be most unfitting."\r\n\r\n"You have had the picture I gave you taken away, uncle," said Milly\r\npresently, her quick eyes roving round the room. "Ah! you\'ve had it hung\r\nup on the wall. That\'s nice there. You can see it from your bed. Don\'t\r\nyou like looking at it? Doesn\'t it make you feel happy?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say it does," replied Sir Edward, glancing at the picture in\r\nquestion. "Why ought it to make me feel happy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s so nice to think he is just getting home after being away so\r\nlong. I wonder if he was a great time walking back. How long do you\r\nthink it takes one of God\'s prodigal sons to get back to Him, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"I should say a very long time, indeed," said Sir Edward, slowly.\r\n\r\n"But how long? Two days, or six hours, or a week?"\r\n\r\n"It would depend perhaps on how long they had been away from Him."\r\n\r\n"It\'s rather hard to understand," said Milly, wrinkling her little brow\r\nperplexedly, "because God is everywhere, isn\'t He? and I should have\r\nthought He would have been close by them all the time. I was asking\r\nnurse about it, and she said that God was near them, only they wouldn\'t\r\nhave anything to say to Him, and did bad things and shut the Lord Jesus\r\nout of their heart, and let Satan in, and then God had to leave them\r\ntill they said they said they were sorry. I suppose directly they say:\r\n\'_Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in Thy sight, and am no more\r\nworthy to be called Thy son,_\' then God just folds them in His arms and\r\nforgives them and takes them back again; isn\'t that it?"\r\n\r\n"Look here, I think we have had enough of this subject. Talk about\r\nsomething else."\r\n\r\nSir Edward\'s tone was irritable. Milly\'s ready tongue obeyed.\r\n\r\n"Nurse says it\'s so cold to-day that she thinks it will snow. Do you\r\nthink it will? It is quite smoky by the river; nurse says it is a fog. I\r\nwondered where it all came from. Do you think it might be God\'s breath,\r\nuncle?"\r\n\r\nAs she was chatting on, suddenly there came a sharp knock at the door,\r\nand a visitor appeared.\r\n\r\n"Thought I\'d look you up, for I heard you were on the sick list. Good\r\ngracious! you have been pretty bad, haven\'t you? Will you put me up for\r\na night or two? I expect you want a little cheerful company."\r\n\r\nTalking volubly, Major Lovell--for it was he--came forward and looked\r\nwith real concern on Sir Edward\'s altered face.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad to see you," said the latter, heartily, holding out his\r\nhand. "Come and stay for as long as you like. I\'m sick to death of my\r\nown society."\r\n\r\n"And is this the small party that arrived so unexpectedly when I was\r\nhere before?" inquired Major Lovell, looking down at Milly, who still\r\nsat in the big chair, regarding the new-comer with her large brown eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Sir Edward, a faint smile hovering about his lips as he\r\nremembered his horror of her advent; "she is taking charge of me this\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\nMilly held out her little hand with all the grace of a duchess.\r\n\r\n"I remember you," she said; "you were one of the gentlemen that laughed\r\nat me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I could have been guilty of such rudeness, surely."\r\n\r\n"Now, I think you may run away," Sir Edward said, "and tell nurse I will\r\nring when I want her."\r\n\r\nMilly obeyed, and confided to nurse that she hoped the "new gentleman"\r\nwould not keep her away from her uncle. "For do you know, nurse, I like\r\nUncle Edward so much better when he is in bed. He looks so sad, and\r\nspeaks so softly. I wish I could sit with him every day."\r\n\r\nMajor Lovell was a distant cousin of Sir Edward, and there existed a\r\nwarm friendship between them. The very brightness of his tone seemed to\r\ndo the invalid good, and Milly was quite delighted to find that her\r\nuncle\'s visitor not only listened with interest to the account of her\r\nfavorite games and pastimes, but insisted upon joining her in them, and\r\nthe walls of the quiet old house rang again with merry mirth and\r\nlaughter such as they had not known for years.\r\n\r\nUpstairs in the sick room Major Lovell proved a wonderfully patient and\r\nskillful nurse; but there were times when all his bright cheeriness\r\ncould not smooth the furrows in the invalid\'s brow, or take away the\r\nfretfulness of tone.\r\n\r\nOne morning Major Lovell came down from an interview with him with a\r\npuzzled expression of face. Catching sight of Milly in the hall,\r\nequipped in hat and jacket, he asked,--\r\n\r\n"Are you going out with nurse?"\r\n\r\n"No, nurse is busy--just by my own self, in the avenue with Fritz. Do\r\ncome with me."\r\n\r\nThe major consented, but with a graver face than usual, and then\r\nsuddenly, very full of his own thoughts, said to the child,--\r\n\r\n"I believe your uncle has something on his mind. It strikes me from\r\ndifferent things he has let drop that he is turning pious."\r\n\r\n"What is pious?" inquired Milly, instantly.\r\n\r\n"What is it? A pious person thinks every one wicked but themselves, and\r\ncondemns everybody and everything all round them. They are most\r\nobjectionable people, little woman, so mind you never take up that line,\r\nand the worst of it is that they\'re so satisfied with their own\r\ngoodness, that you can\'t crush them, try as much as you may."\r\n\r\n"And is Uncle Edward going to be like them?" asked the child, with a\r\nperplexed face.\r\n\r\n"I devoutly hope not. I shall do all in my power to prevent it."\r\n\r\n"What do pious people do?" questioned Milly.\r\n\r\n"Do! They give tracts away and sing hymns, and pull long faces over very\r\nwell-bound Bibles."\r\n\r\n"I like singing hymns," asserted Milly, very emphatically; "everybody\r\nsings hymns to God, don\'t they? I listen to the birds, sometimes, and\r\nwish I could sing like them; and the trees sing, and the bees and flies.\r\nEverything seems to sing out of doors in the summer time, but they\'ve\r\nnearly all dropped asleep now till next year. What hymns do you sing,\r\nMajor Lovell?"\r\n\r\n"Bless the child! what do you take me for?" and the major laughed\r\nheartily as he spoke; then, with a twinkle in his eye, he went on\r\ngravely,--\r\n\r\n"I shall begin to think that you are pious if you don\'t take care. What\r\nelse do you do besides sing hymns?"\r\n\r\n"I have a Bible," said Milly, solemnly, "and I just love it."\r\n\r\n"And what makes you love such a dry book as the Bible? You can\'t\r\nunderstand a word of it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can, Major Lovell, it\'s beautiful. I love nurse to read and read\r\nit to me. It tells about Jesus, you know, and I love Jesus, and He loves\r\nme. And it has such nice stories in it."\r\n\r\nMajor Lovell gave a long, low whistle.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he said, shaking his head comically at the little figure walking\r\nby his side, "I\'m very much afraid you may be at the bottom of it all.\r\nDo you read the Bible to your uncle? Do you tell him that he has been\r\nwasting his life and not fulfilling the end for which he was created, in\r\nfact, that he is a wicked sinner? For that has been the substance of\r\nhis talk with me this morning!"\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward is a very good man," Milly replied, warmly. "I don\'t know\r\nwhat you mean, Major Lovell; don\'t you read the Bible?"\r\n\r\n"What will you think of me if I tell you I don\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you know it all by heart? I expect that is why."\r\n\r\n"I rather think I don\'t. You must not begin to catechise me too\r\nseverely. Who has brought you up in this pious fashion?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not pious. You said they were horrid people. But I thought all the\r\ngrown-up people read the Bible, except people like Jack."\r\n\r\n"Who is Jack?"\r\n\r\n"He was a prodigal son, one of God\'s prodigal sons."\r\n\r\n"And what are they, may I ask?"\r\n\r\nMilly did not answer for a minute, then she stopped short, and said very\r\nsolemnly, raising her large dark eyes to the major\'s face,--\r\n\r\n"I wonder if you\'re a prodigal son. Uncle Edward said there were some\r\nrich ones. Have you run away from God, Major Lovell?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now," said the major, pinching her cheek good-naturedly; "I\r\ndidn\'t bargain for this when I came out with you. You must keep your\r\nsermons for some one else. Come along to the stables with me, and I will\r\ngive you a ride."\r\n\r\nIn an instant Milly\'s gravity disappeared, and a little time afterwards\r\nshe was laughing gleefully as she was being trotted round the\r\nstable-yard on a large bay mare; but she said to her nurse when she came\r\nin,--\r\n\r\n"Major Lovell is very nice, but very funny, and I can\'t always\r\nunderstand his talk, he says such difficult things."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n"HE AROSE AND CAME TO HIS FATHER."\r\n\r\nMajor Lovell stayed a week, and Sir Edward seemed the better for his\r\ncompany, as far as his bodily health was concerned. But at heart he was\r\nvery wretched, and his cousin\'s influence was not the sort to help him.\r\n\r\n"Now, old chap, make haste and get well, and don\'t moon over yourself\r\nand your feelings. And come down to our place for Christmas, won\'t you?\r\nYou\'re getting quite in the blues by being so much alone."\r\n\r\nThese were Major Lovell\'s parting words, and Sir Edward responded,--\r\n\r\n"No, thanks; I prefer being at home this Christmas. Why, I doubt if I\r\nshall leave my room by that time; I am as weak as a baby."\r\n\r\nThe week before Christmas Sir Edward was in an easy chair in the\r\nlibrary, and, though still an invalid, was now making rapid progress\r\ntowards recovery. He was conning over an article he had just written,\r\nbefore a blazing fire, when there was a knock at the door. A frown came\r\nto his face as he turned to see who the intruder was, but disappeared at\r\nthe sight of his little niece, rosy and breathless, in out-door\r\ngarments, and hugging a large piece of holly in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward, he has come!"\r\n\r\n"Who has come?"\r\n\r\n"Tommy--he really and truly has. Ford told me just as I came in with\r\nnurse. He heard it from Harris, and Harris heard it from Maxwell\r\nhimself. He said, \'My lad has come, tell little missy,\' and Ford says\r\nHarris said, \'He looked as if he could dance a jig for joy!\' Oh, Uncle\r\nEdward, may I go to them? Nurse says it\'s too late, but I do want to be\r\nthere. There\'s such a lot to be done now he has really come; and, Uncle\r\nEdward, may they kill one of the cows in the farm that are being fatted\r\nup? There\'s no calf, I\'m afraid. May they? And may I go and tell them\r\nso? You will let me go, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUGGING A LARGE PIECE OF HOLLY IN HER ARMS.]\r\n\r\n"Most certainly not; it is much too late in the afternoon for you to\r\nbe going down there. It is getting quite dark, and as to one of my\r\ncattle being disposed of in that way, I should not dream of allowing it\r\nfor one moment."\r\n\r\nMilly\'s eyes filled with tears, which she vainly tried to restrain. When\r\nher uncle spoke to her in that tone she knew it was useless to\r\nremonstrate.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be having the feast without me," she said, with a little sob in\r\nher voice. "Mrs. Maxwell promised me I should be there when they had it,\r\nand I\'m longing to see Tommy."\r\n\r\n"Then if Mrs. Maxwell promised you that, she will put off her feast till\r\nto-morrow," said Sir Edward in a softer tone. "And now be a sensible\r\nlittle woman, and wait patiently till the time comes. You may be sure\r\nhis parents will like to have him to themselves the first night. Run\r\naway now; I don\'t want to be disturbed."\r\n\r\nPoor little Milly crept out of the room feeling very crestfallen, and a\r\nshort time after was lying on the hearth-rug before the nursery fire,\r\nher arms wound round Fritz\'s neck, confiding to him the whole story, and\r\ncomforting herself by conjecturing how and where the meeting had taken\r\nplace. Her little mind was so full of the subject that it was long\r\nbefore nurse could get her to sleep that night. Her last words before\r\nshe dropped off were,--\r\n\r\n"I wonder who will do the music and dancing!"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the instant her breakfast was over, Milly obtained\r\nnurse\'s permission to go down to the keeper\'s cottage under charge of\r\nSarah, the nursery maid. She was away the whole morning, and about one\r\no\'clock a message came from Mrs. Maxwell to ask if she might stay to\r\ndinner with them. So that it was not till nearly four in the afternoon\r\nthat she was brought up to the house, and then, flushed and excited, she\r\npoured into her nurse\'s ear a long account of all that she had been\r\nhearing and doing.\r\n\r\n"Now, come, my dear, you mustn\'t talk forever," was nurse\'s remonstrance\r\nat last; "Sir Edward told me I could send you to him for a little when\r\nyou came in, and I must make you tidy first."\r\n\r\nIt was quite dusk when Milly entered the library, but the bright\r\nfirelight showed her the figure of her uncle leaning back in his easy\r\nchair, and indulging in a reverie.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, looking round, "where have you been all day? Down at\r\nMaxwell\'s, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Milly, sedately; "and I\'ll tell you all about it, if you\r\nlike. May I make myself comfortable first?"\r\n\r\nAnd after a minute\'s hesitation she climbed into the heavy armchair on\r\nthe opposite side of the fireplace, making a pretty picture, as she\r\nleaned her curly head back on the cushion and gazed earnestly into her\r\nuncle\'s face.\r\n\r\n"We will have a crack together, uncle. That\'s what Maxwell calls it,\r\nwhen Mrs. Maxwell and I talk over the fire. May I tell you all about\r\nTommy now?"\r\n\r\n"You may," was the amused reply.\r\n\r\n"Well, you know, I ran as fast as I could down to the wood this morning,\r\nand Sarah ran after me, and Mrs. Maxwell saw me coming and she ran to\r\nthe door. I was rather out of breath, you see, so she just smoothed me\r\ndown a little, and we kissed each other, and she cried a tiny bit, for I\r\nfelt her tears on my face. Then she took me in to see Tommy--Maxwell was\r\nout, and Tommy was in the kitchen in one of Maxwell\'s great-coats, and\r\nhe was eating some bacon at the table for his breakfast. He got up when\r\nhe saw me--he\'s a nice big man, uncle, but I think his hair wants\r\ncutting. We shook hands, and I told him I\'d been expecting him ever so\r\nlong. He looked rather shy, but after he had quite finished his\r\nbreakfast, we had a very nice talk, and Mrs. Maxwell went bustling about\r\ngetting dinner ready. Tommy told me all about himself from the very\r\nbeginning, but I really quite forget some of it. He never kept any pigs\r\nat all, but he kept some sheep instead--he went out to America and did\r\nit--and then he was a railway man, and then he had a fever, and then he\r\ngot into bad company, and at last he came to London, and he was an\r\nomnibus man there, and then a cabman, and then he drank too much beer,\r\nand his money all went away, and he was ashamed of himself, and so he\r\nwouldn\'t write home, and then he smashed his cab against the lamp-post,\r\nand then he drank too much again."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you need tell me any more of his misdoings," said Sir\r\nEdward, drily.\r\n\r\n"But, you see, he had to get very bad before he got good, because he was\r\na prodigal son. And he is sorry now. He said he never, never would have\r\ncome home until he was a good man, only one day he listened to a man\r\npreaching a sermon in the middle of a street on a Sunday night, and he\r\nfelt uncomfortable, and then he was spoken to after by--now guess,\r\nuncle, who do you think?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward could not guess, so Milly went on triumphantly: "Why, it was\r\nmy Jack, and he began to talk to him, and told him he was like him once,\r\nand he said he was looking out for a Tommy Maxwell. Now wasn\'t that\r\nwonderful, when it was Tommy himself he spoke to! Well, Tommy said he\r\nhadn\'t the face to go home till he was better, but Jack told him not to\r\nwait a day longer, for his father and mother were waiting for him; but\r\nthe strange thing was that even then Tommy waited a whole two weeks\r\nbefore he made up his mind to come. Now don\'t you think he was foolish,\r\nuncle?"\r\n\r\n"Very foolish."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t quite understand it, but nurse says there are lots of people\r\nlike that, waiting to make themselves better, instead of running home\r\njust as they are. She says some of God\'s prodigal sons do that; do you\r\nthink many do, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"I daresay."\r\n\r\n"And Tommy said, though he wanted to see his home again dreadfully, he\r\nhad a great fight with himself to come at all. I didn\'t know prodigal\r\nsons found it so difficult--the one in the Bible didn\'t, not when he\r\nonce made up his mind. Well, and so Tommy got out at the station--I\'m\r\nsorry he came by train, but Jack\'s uncle paid for his ticket--I would\r\nrather he had run the whole way."\r\n\r\n"Why would you?" asked Sir Edward, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"I think it would have been more proper if he had," said the child\r\nslowly, her head a little on one side, as she gazed thoughtfully into\r\nthe fire. "I always run or walk the whole way when I play the prodigal\r\nson. I begin rather slowly, because it looks a long way off, but when I\r\ncome near I hurry. I\'m wanting to be there when I see my home. The\r\nprodigal son didn\'t have a train in the Bible, and I think Tommy might\r\nhave tried to do without it."\r\n\r\nThe tone of reproach at the end of her speech was too much for her\r\nuncle\'s gravity, and he laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid Tommy has sadly disappointed you. Did he take a cab from\r\nthe station?"\r\n\r\n"No, he didn\'t do that. He got home in the afternoon, and Maxwell was\r\ncleaning his gun on the doorstep, when he saw a shadow, and he looked up\r\nand there he was! Oh! I should like to have been there, but I\'m sorry to\r\nsay Maxwell didn\'t fall on his neck and kiss him. I asked Tommy very\r\ncarefully about it, and he said he took hold of both his hands and\r\nsqueezed them tight, and he gave a shout, and Mrs. Maxwell was doing her\r\nwashing in the back yard, and she heard it, and she shook all over so\r\nthat she could hardly walk. She cried so much when she saw Tommy that\r\nMaxwell had to pat her on the back and give her a glass of water; and\r\nTommy he sat down on the little seat inside the porch, and he\r\nsaid--these were his very words, uncle--\'I ain\'t fit to come home,\r\nfather. I\'m a disgrace to your name,\' and Mrs. Maxwell--Tommy told\r\nme--she just took his head between her two hands, and drew it to rest on\r\nher shoulder, and then she bent down and kissed him all over and she\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n"\'My boy, who should you come to when you are in disgrace and trouble\r\nbut your own father and mother?\'\r\n\r\n"Tommy said, when he told me this, \'It fair broke my heart, miss,\' and\r\nthen he gave a great sob, and I began to cry, and then Mrs. Maxwell came\r\nup, and her hands were all floury, for she was making an apple pudding,\r\nand she cried too, and then we all cried together--at least, Tommy\r\nturned his head away and pretended he didn\'t, but I saw he did."\r\n\r\nMilly paused for breath, and her eyes looked wistfully into the glowing\r\ncoals before her.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know prodigal sons were sad when they came back, but Tommy\r\nseemed so sad that he made me sad too. Why do you think Tommy cried,\r\nuncle?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward did not reply. He was gazing dreamily into the fire, and\r\nsomething of the wistfulness in his little niece\'s face seemed to be\r\nreflected in his. He gave a start after a moment\'s silence.\r\n\r\n"Eh, child? What are you saying? Have you finished your story?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no, uncle, not nearly. Are you tired? Nurse said I must not tire\r\nyou too much."\r\n\r\nSir Edward laughed, but it was not a happy laugh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, finish your story by all means, little woman," he said, and Milly\r\ncontinued:--\r\n\r\n"We all cheered up when Mrs. Maxwell asked me if I\'d like to stay to\r\ndinner. I asked if it was the feast, and she laughed and said, \'Yes.\'\r\nShe had a roast leg of pork in the oven, with some stuffing and apple\r\nsauce, and, uncle, it was lovely! Maxwell came in just in time, and he\r\nlooked so happy, and then we all sat down to dinner, but I asked Maxwell\r\nto say first before we began: \'_Let us eat, and be merry, for this my\r\nson was dead, and is alive again, he was lost, and is found_.\' He folded\r\nhis hands and said it like grace, and Mrs. Maxwell said \'Amen\' when he\r\nhad finished, and wiped her eyes with her apron. I told them we must all\r\nbe very merry, but Tommy wasn\'t, I\'m afraid. He kept looking first at\r\nMrs. Maxwell and then all round the kitchen, and then at Maxwell, and\r\nthen he sighed very big sighs. He said he couldn\'t believe he was at\r\nhome, but he told me, when I asked him quietly afterwards, that he was\r\nreally very happy, he only sighed and looked sad because he thought how\r\nfoolish he had been to stay away so long. I was very sorry for one thing\r\nabout him, uncle. He wasn\'t in his best clothes. They were all too small\r\nfor him, and the slippers wouldn\'t fit him, but Maxwell says he will buy\r\nhim some new ones to-morrow. And Tommy told me he wouldn\'t wear a ring\r\nif he had one. He asked me why he should, so I told him about the\r\nprodigal son in the Bible--he seemed to like hearing about it, and he\r\nsaid he thought he was very like him. And then I asked about the music\r\nand dancing. I wanted to have that, but we couldn\'t manage it. Mrs.\r\nMaxwell said we had music in our hearts; how can we have that, uncle? I\r\ndidn\'t hear any in mine, for I kept silent and listened for it."\r\n\r\n"I expect she meant you were so happy that you did not want any music to\r\nmake you happier."\r\n\r\n"I was very happy. Oh, Uncle Edward, why won\'t all the prodigal sons go\r\nhome? I can\'t think why they like staying away. It is so lovely to think\r\nof Tommy now! And every one would be just as happy, wouldn\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think all young men have such fond parents as your friend\r\nTommy has," said Sir Edward gravely.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t they? Well, God\'s prodigal sons couldn\'t have a nicer father. I\r\nlie and think of them when I\'m in bed sometimes, and I talk to God about\r\nthem. I was so glad when Jack went back to Him. I think it is worst of\r\nall to stay a long way off from God, because He does love them so. I\r\nwonder if it is that they don\'t know whether God will take them back.\r\nTommy seemed half afraid till he came, that his father would be angry\r\nwith him. I should like to see a prodigal son running back into God\'s\r\narms so much! But I suppose he does it very quietly, and only the angels\r\nlook down and see it!"\r\n\r\n"And what is this young scapegrace going to do now? Live on his father\r\nand mother, or is he going to try and do some honest work?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward\'s tone was rather impatient. Milly looked up surprised.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean Tommy, uncle? Are you angry with him? He told me he was\r\ngoing to look for work directly, and Maxwell is coming up to speak to\r\nyou about him to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I daresay--wants him to take the place of under-keeper, I suppose,"\r\nand Sir Edward gave a little grunt of dissatisfaction at the thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n"A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM."\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Edward retired to his room that night, he paced up and down for\r\nsome time in front of his little niece\'s picture that she had given him.\r\nHis brow was knitted, and he was thinking deeply.\r\n\r\n"I am longing to have peace," he muttered. "Why cannot I make up my mind\r\nto seek it! \'_I will arise_\'--ay, easy to say; it\'s a hard and bitter\r\nthing for a backslider to retrace his steps. How the child stabs me\r\nsometimes, and how little she knows my past!"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and gazed at the picture. "And the Lord Himself used this as\r\nan illustration. I could not want anything stronger."\r\n\r\nA deep-drawn sigh followed, then a heartfelt cry rose to heaven.\r\n\r\n"May God have mercy on me, and bring me back, for I can\'t bring myself!"\r\n\r\nThe next morning Sir Edward had an interview with his keeper, who\r\nbrought his son up with him, and as the tall, broad-shouldered young\r\nfellow stood before the squire, and in earnest, humble tones asked if he\r\ncould be given a chance of redeeming his character by being employed on\r\nthe estate, Sir Edward\'s severity relaxed, and after a long conversation\r\nwith him he promised he would give him a trial.\r\n\r\nHe smiled grimly to himself as father and son left him with warm\r\nexpressions of gratitude.\r\n\r\n"So that is the child\'s hero! One whose example I might well follow. He\r\nhas had the courage at last to take the step from which I am still\r\nshrinking. Why should I fear that my welcome home would be less full of\r\nlove and forgiveness than his?"\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas eve, a wild and stormy day. The wind raged ceaselessly\r\nround the old house, howling down the chimneys, and beating the branches\r\nof the trees outside against the window panes.\r\n\r\nMilly had been very busy for some hours helping Ford to decorate the\r\nhall and rooms with holly and evergreen, though Ford would every now\r\nand then pause in his work, saying:\r\n\r\n"There, Miss Milly, I\'m sure we\'re overdoing it. If the house was full\r\nof company now, I would take a pride in it, but I don\'t believe the\r\nmaster will notice whether it\'s done or not. It seems to me as he is\r\ngetting more and more shut up into hisself lately. Christmas is a dull\r\ntime with us."\r\n\r\nAll was finished at last, and Milly went up to the nursery and stood at\r\nthe window, her bright brown eyes eagerly scanning and taking note of\r\nevery object out of doors.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a perfect hurricane," said nurse, presently, as she sat with her\r\nwork in a comfortable chair by the fire. "If we feel it inland like\r\nthis, what must it be at sea!"\r\n\r\n"I should like to be on the sea," said Milly. "I love the wind, but I\r\nthink it is getting a little bit too rough this afternoon. I\'m rather\r\nafraid it will hurt the little trees. Ford said if I went out I should\r\nbe blown away. Do you think, nurse, if the wind was very, very strong it\r\nwould ever be able to blow me up to heaven?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not," said nurse, gravely, "and I don\'t think we could\r\nspare you, my dear. You would not like to leave this world yet awhile."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes I think I should, and sometimes I think I shouldn\'t. I think\r\nI should like to be blown up to spend a day there, and then come back\r\nagain. Oh, nurse, Goliath is screaming and cracking so! I wish the wind\r\nwould knock him over, he is a horrid old tree. I always think he is\r\nmaking faces at me when I run past him. Wouldn\'t it be nice to see him\r\nblown down?"\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t wish that," said nurse, getting up from her chair and\r\nmoving towards the door; "it\'s a dangerous thing for an old tree to be\r\nblown down. Now I am going downstairs for a short time, so be a good\r\nchild and don\'t get into mischief while I am away."\r\n\r\nMilly remained at the window for some minutes after nurse\'s departure,\r\nthen her quick eyes noticed a poor wretched little kitten mewing\r\npitifully as she vainly tried to shelter herself from the violent blasts\r\nby crouching close to a tree.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, without thought of consequences, the child darted to the\r\nnursery door and down the broad oak staircase.\r\n\r\n"Poor pussy, I will run and fetch her in. I expect she has run away\r\nfrom the kitchen."\r\n\r\nSir Edward was writing at his study table, when an unusually violent\r\ngust of wind caused him to raise his eyes and glance out of the window.\r\nThere, to his amazement, he saw, under the old oak tree on the lawn, his\r\nlittle niece, her golden brown curls flying as she battled with the\r\nelements, and struggled vainly to stoop and take the kitten in her arms.\r\n\r\nHe started up from his seat, but as he did so a blast that shook the\r\nhouse swept by; there was an awful cracking, then a crash, and, to his\r\nhorror, a huge limb of the old oak came with an awful thud upon the very\r\nspot where his little niece was standing.\r\n\r\n"My God, save her!" was his agonized cry, as he saw at the same moment\r\nthe little figure stagger and fall. Then, forgetting his weakness and\r\nlack of physical strength, he dashed out of the house, and in another\r\ninstant was standing over her.\r\n\r\nHis first feeling was one of intense thankfulness to find that the\r\nbranch in falling could have only slightly grazed her, as she was lying\r\non the ground untouched by it; but as he raised the motionless figure,\r\nand noted a red mark on her forehead which was swelling rapidly, his\r\nheart sank within him. It did not take him long to carry her into her\r\nhouse, and he was met at the door by nurse, who wisely wasted no time in\r\nuseless lamentation, but set to work at once to restore animation to her\r\nlittle charge. Her efforts were successful. Milly was only slightly\r\nstunned, but it had been a miraculous escape, and had the blow been an\r\ninch nearer her temple it might have been fatal. As it was, the child\r\nwas more frightened than hurt, and when a little time after her uncle\r\ntook her in his arms with unwonted tenderness, she clung to him and\r\nburst into passionate sobs.\r\n\r\n"Take care of me, uncle! That nasty old Goliath! He tried to kill me, he\r\ndid! I saw him coming on the top of me. God only just saved me in time,\r\ndidn\'t He?"\r\n\r\nWhen the bruise had been bathed and dressed by nurse, Sir Edward still\r\nkept her on his knee, and after nurse had left the room, and the child\r\nrested her little head on his shoulder in a very subdued frame of mind,\r\nhe did, what he had never done yet--stooped over her and kissed her,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n"You have been very near death this afternoon, little one, and I could\r\nill have spared you."\r\n\r\nMilly raised her large dark eyes to his.\r\n\r\n"If I had died I should have gone straight up to God, shouldn\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you would."\r\n\r\n"I should have liked that. I suppose He doesn\'t want me yet, or He would\r\nhave sent for me."\r\n\r\nWhen she came down to her uncle that evening she raised a very sad\r\nlittle face to his from the opposite side of the table.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward, have you heard who Goliath really did kill?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean the tree that came on you? No one else was hurt, I hope?"\r\nand Sir Edward\'s tone was a little anxious.\r\n\r\n"She was killed dead--quite dead and mangled, nurse said. It was the\r\npoor little kitten, uncle, that I ran out to fetch."\r\n\r\nThe brown eyes were swimming with tears, and Milly could not understand\r\nthe smile that came to Sir Edward\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"Only a kitten. Well, it was sad, I daresay, but there are plenty of\r\nkittens about the place."\r\n\r\n"But, uncle, I\'ve been thinking so much about this one. Ford says she\r\nhad run away from the stable. I expect she was going to be a prodigal\r\nkitten, perhaps, and now she\'ll never run away any more. It\'s so sad\r\nabout her, and I think why it is sad is because nobody cares, not even\r\nnurse. She said she would rather it had been the kitten than me. Poor\r\nlittle kitty, her mother will be missing her so to-night! Do you think,\r\nuncle, the wind or Goliath killed her? I think it was Goliath. I just\r\nlooked out of my window on the stairs before I came down. The wind has\r\nstopped now, and the trees seemed to be crying and sobbing together. I\'m\r\nsure they were sorry for kitty. I think they were tired out themselves,\r\ntoo, they have been so knocked about to-day. I wish so much I had been\r\njust in time to save the dear little kitten."\r\n\r\n"We will not talk about her any more," said Sir Edward cheerfully. "Have\r\nyou seen Tom Maxwell lately?"\r\n\r\nMilly\'s little tongue was only too ready to talk of him.\r\n\r\n"He helped nurse and me to get some holly in the wood yesterday. I have\r\nnice talks with him often. He says he is very happy, and this will be\r\nthe best Christmas he has spent in his life. Uncle, I want to ask you\r\nsomething. I\'ve been thinking of it a great deal to-day, only since I\r\nwas knocked down this afternoon I\'ve had such a pain in my head I left\r\noff thinking. But I\'ve just remembered it now. You see it is really\r\nJesus Christ\'s birthday to-morrow, and I was thinking I\'ve been getting\r\npresents for every one in the house but Him. Nurse has been helping me\r\nwith some of them. I\'ve made nurse a kettleholder, and cook a\r\nneedlebook, and I\'ve bought a penknife for Ford, and a thimble for\r\nSarah, and some handkerchiefs for Maxwell and Mrs. Maxwell, and some\r\nwoolen gloves for Tommy. And I\'ve nothing--no nothing for Him. If I only\r\nknew something He would like."\r\n\r\nShe paused, and a soft wistfulness came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking," she went on, "that perhaps I could put my present for\r\nHim outside the nursery window on the ledge. And then when we are all in\r\nbed, and it is very quiet, I expect He might send an angel down to\r\nbring it up to Him. I think He might do that, because He knows how much\r\nI want to give Him something. But then I don\'t know what to give Him.\r\nCould you tell me, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"I think," said Sir Edward, gravely, "the only way you can give Him\r\na Christmas present is to give something to the poor. He would rather\r\nhave that. I will give you this to put in the plate to-morrow in\r\nchurch."\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Edward put his hand in his pocket, and rolled a coin across the\r\ntable to his little niece.\r\n\r\nBut Milly was not satisfied.\r\n\r\n"This is your present," she said, doubtfully. "What will you give Him\r\nthis Christmas besides? Is money the only thing you can give Him,\r\nuncle?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward pushed back his chair and rose from the table. His feelings\r\nwere almost getting beyond his control. With the one subject that was\r\nnow always foremost in his thoughts, the child\'s question rang again in\r\nhis ears, "Is money the only thing you can give Him, uncle?" And like a\r\nflash of light came a reply:\r\n\r\n"No, I can give myself back to Him, my soul and body, that have now\r\nbeen so long in the keeping of His enemy."\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes\' silence he said, in a strangely quiet voice:\r\n\r\n"Come, little one, it is bedtime; say \'Good-night,\' and run up to\r\nnurse!"\r\n\r\nMilly came up to him, and as he stood with his back to the fire warming\r\nhis hands, she took hold of the ends of his coat in her little hands,\r\nand, looking up at him, said:\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward, you gave me a kiss like a father might have done this\r\nafternoon. Would you mind very much giving me another?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward looked down at the sweet little face raised so coaxingly to\r\nhis, and then took her up in his arms; but after he had given her the\r\ndesired kiss he said, with some effort,--\r\n\r\n"I want you to do something to-night, little one. When you say your\r\nprayers, ask that one of God\'s prodigal sons may be brought back this\r\nChristmas time. It is one who wants to return. Will you pray for him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, uncle," replied the child softly. "And will you tell me his name?"\r\n\r\n"No, I cannot do that."\r\n\r\nSomething in his face made his little niece refrain from asking further\r\nquestions. She left him a moment later, and Sir Edward went to the\r\nsmoking-room and seated himself in a chair by the fire. The chimes of\r\nthe village church were ringing out merrily, and presently outside in\r\nthe avenue a little company of carol singers were singing the sweet old\r\nChristmas truths that none can hear untouched.\r\n\r\n"_Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward\r\nmen_."\r\n\r\nA sense of the love of God seemed to surround his soul, and this verse\r\ncame into his mind as he mused:--\r\n\r\n"_I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with\r\nloving-kindness have I drawn thee_."\r\n\r\nCould he not trace in the events of the last few months the hand of a\r\nloving Father gently calling His wanderer home? Stricken down himself,\r\nplaced on a sick bed for reflection, brought to the edge of the valley\r\nof the shadow of death, and then tenderly restored to life and health;\r\nthe gentle voice and life of a little child pleading with him day by\r\nday, and that life having so lately been miraculously preserved from a\r\ngreat danger--all this filled his heart with the realization of the\r\nmercy and loving-kindness of God; and when again the past came up before\r\nhim, and the tempter drew near again with the old refrain, "You have\r\nwandered too long, you have hardened your heart, and God has shut his\r\near to your cry!" Sir Edward, by the help and power of the Divine\r\nSpirit, was able to look up, and say from the depths of his heart,--\r\n\r\n"_Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and in Thy sight, and am no more\r\nworthy to be called Thy son."_\r\n\r\nThey were sitting in the study the next afternoon, the child upon his\r\nknee, when Sir Edward said suddenly,--\r\n\r\n"Do you know that I have received a letter to-day about you?"\r\n\r\n"Who from?" asked Milly, with interest.\r\n\r\n"From my sister, your aunt, in Australia. I wrote to her when you came,\r\nand she wants to have you out there, and bring you up among her own\r\nchildren. She says a friend of hers will take charge of you and take you\r\nto her next month. I must talk to nurse about it."\r\n\r\nThe little hands clutched hold of his coat sleeve tightly, but not a\r\nword did Milly say. Sir Edward noted a slight quivering of the lips, and\r\na piteous gleam in the soft brown eyes. He waited in silence for a\r\nmoment, then said cheerfully,--\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you be glad to have a lot of boys and girls to play with, instead\r\nof staying here with a lonely old man?"\r\n\r\nStill the child said nothing; but suddenly down went the curly head upon\r\nhis arm, and the tears came thick and fast.\r\n\r\nSir Edward raised the little face to his,--\r\n\r\n"We must not have tears on Christmas Day," he said. "What is the matter,\r\ndon\'t you want to go?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I must," sobbed Milly. "Ford told nurse the day I came that\r\nyou hated children. I\'ve always been thinking of it, but you have been\r\nso kind to me that I thought perhaps he had made a little mistake. Miss\r\nKent didn\'t want me, and now you don\'t want me, and perhaps my aunt\r\nwon\'t want me when I get there. I wish God wanted me, but I\'m afraid He\r\ndoesn\'t. Nurse says she thinks He wants me to work for Him when I grow\r\nup. I think--I think I\'m rather like the little kitten yesterday, that\r\nnobody was sorry for when she died. You said there were plenty more\r\nkittens, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there are plenty of small Millicents in this world," and\r\nSir Edward\'s voice was husky. "Now listen, little woman. I have been\r\nthinking over the matter, and have decided this afternoon to keep you\r\nwith me. I find I do want you after all, and cannot afford to lose you.\r\nSupposing we dry these tears, and talk about something else."\r\n\r\nAnd as the little arms were thrown round his neck, and a face full of\r\nsmiles and tears like an April shower was lifted to his, the "confirmed\r\nold bachelor" took to his heart the little maiden whose very existence\r\nhad so annoyed and distressed him only a few months before.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Edward," she said, a little time after, "do you know if that\r\nprodigal son you told me about last night has come back to God?"\r\n\r\nSir Edward was silent for a minute, then very gravely and solemnly he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"I think he has, little one. It has been a very happy Christmas Day to\r\nhim, and you must pray now that he may not be ashamed to own his Lord,\r\nwho has so mercifully brought him back through the instrumentality of\r\none of His lambs."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Probable Sons, by Amy LeFeuvre\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PROBABLE SONS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 10777.txt or 10777.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/7/7/10777/\r\n\r\nProduced by Joel Erickson, Michael Ciesielski, Garrett Alley and PG\r\nDistributed Proofreaders\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n\r\n'
