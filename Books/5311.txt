And on her behalf I want to\r\nsend to you these few words of acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mifflin, I need hardly say, is unskilled in the arts of\r\nauthorship: this is her first book, and I doubt whether she will\r\never write another. She hardly realized, I think, how much her\r\nstory owes to your own delightful writings. There used to be a\r\nwell-thumbed copy of "Adventures in Contentment" on her table at the\r\nSabine Farm, and I have seen her pick it up, after a long day in\r\nthe kitchen, read it with chuckles, and say that the story of you\r\nand Harriet reminded her of herself and Andrew. She used to mutter\r\nsomething about "Adventures in Discontentment" and ask why Harriet\'s\r\nside of the matter was never told? And so when her own adventure\r\ncame to pass, and she was urged to put it on paper, I think she\r\nunconsciously adopted something of the manner and matter that you\r\nhave made properly yours.\r\n\r\nSurely, sir, you will not disown so innocent a tribute! At any rate,\r\nMiss Harriet Grayson, whose excellent qualities we have all so long\r\nadmired, will find in Mrs. Mifflin a kindred spirit.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mifflin would have said this for herself, with her characteristic\r\ndefiniteness of speech, had she not been out of touch with her\r\npublishers and foolscap paper. She and the Professor are on their\r\nParnassus, somewhere on the high roads, happily engrossed in the\r\nmost godly diversion known to man--selling books. And I venture\r\nto think that there are no volumes they take more pleasure in\r\nrecommending than the wholesome and invigorating books which bear\r\nyour name.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Mr. Grayson, with warm regards,\r\n\r\nFaithfully yours,\r\nCHRISTOPHER MORLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder if there isn\'t a lot of bunkum in higher education? I never\r\nfound that people who were learned in logarithms and other kinds of\r\npoetry were any quicker in washing dishes or darning socks. I\'ve\r\ndone a good deal of reading when I could, and I don\'t want to "admit\r\nimpediments" to the love of books, but I\'ve also seen lots of good,\r\npractical folk spoiled by too much fine print. Reading sonnets\r\nalways gives me hiccups, too.\r\n\r\nI never expected to be an author! But I do think there are some\r\namusing things about the story of Andrew and myself and how books\r\nbroke up our placid life. When John Gutenberg, whose real name (so\r\nthe Professor says) was John Gooseflesh, borrowed that money to set\r\nup his printing press he launched a lot of troubles on the world.\r\n\r\nAndrew and I were wonderfully happy on the farm until he became an\r\nauthor. If I could have foreseen all the bother his writings were\r\nto cause us, I would certainly have burnt the first manuscript in\r\nthe kitchen stove.\r\n\r\nAndrew McGill, the author of those books every one reads, is my\r\nbrother. In other words, I am his sister, ten years younger. Years\r\nago Andrew was a business man, but his health failed and, like so\r\nmany people in the story books, he fled to the country, or, as he\r\ncalled it, to the bosom of Nature. He and I were the only ones left\r\nin an unsuccessful family. I was slowly perishing as a conscientious\r\ngoverness in the brownstone region of New York. He rescued me from\r\nthat and we bought a farm with our combined savings. We became real\r\nfarmers, up with the sun and to bed with the same. Andrew wore\r\noveralls and a soft shirt and grew brown and tough. My hands got\r\nred and blue with soapsuds and frost; I never saw a Redfern\r\nadvertisement from one year\'s end to another, and my kitchen was a\r\nbattlefield where I set my teeth and learned to love hard work.\r\nOur literature was government agriculture reports, patent medicine\r\nalmanacs, seedsmen\'s booklets, and Sears Roebuck catalogues. We\r\nsubscribed to Farm and Fireside and read the serials aloud. Every\r\nnow and then, for real excitement, we read something stirring in the\r\nOld Testament--that cheery book Jeremiah, for instance, of which\r\nAndrew was very fond. The farm did actually prosper, after a while;\r\nand Andrew used to hang over the pasture bars at sunset, and tell,\r\nfrom the way his pipe burned, just what the weather would be the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, we were tremendously happy until Andrew got the\r\nfatal idea of telling the world how happy we were. I am sorry to\r\nhave to admit he had always been rather a bookish man. In his\r\ncollege days he had edited the students\' magazine, and sometimes he\r\nwould get discontented with the Farm and Fireside serials and pull\r\ndown his bound volumes of the college paper. He would read me some\r\nof his youthful poems and stories and mutter vaguely about writing\r\nsomething himself some day. I was more concerned with sitting hens\r\nthan with sonnets and I\'m bound to say I never took these threats\r\nvery seriously. I should have been more severe.\r\n\r\nThen great-uncle Philip died, and his carload of books came to us.\r\nHe had been a college professor, and years ago when Andrew was a\r\nboy Uncle Philip had been very fond of him--had, in fact, put him\r\nthrough college. We were the only near relatives, and all those\r\nbooks turned up one fine day. That was the beginning of the end,\r\nif I had only known it. Andrew had the time of his life building\r\nshelves all round our living-room; not content with that he turned\r\nthe old hen house into a study for himself, put in a stove, and used\r\nto sit up there evenings after I had gone to bed. The first thing I\r\nknew he called the place Sabine Farm (although it had been known for\r\nyears as Bog Hollow) because he thought it a literary thing to do.\r\nHe used to take a book along with him when he drove over to Redfield\r\nfor supplies; sometimes the wagon would be two hours late coming\r\nhome, with old Ben loafing along between the shafts and Andrew lost\r\nin his book.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t think much of all this, but I\'m an easy-going woman and\r\nas long as Andrew kept the farm going I had plenty to do on my own\r\nhook. Hot bread and coffee, eggs and preserves for breakfast; soup\r\nand hot meat, vegetables, dumplings, gravy, brown bread and white,\r\nhuckleberry pudding, chocolate cake and buttermilk for dinner;\r\nmuffins, tea, sausage rolls, blackberries and cream, and doughnuts\r\nfor supper--that\'s the kind of menu I had been preparing three times\r\na day for years. I hadn\'t any time to worry about what wasn\'t my\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAnd then one morning I caught Andrew doing up a big, flat parcel for\r\nthe postman. He looked so sheepish I just had to ask what it was.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve written a book," said Andrew, and he showed me the title page--\r\n\r\n  PARADISE REGAINED\r\n  BY\r\n  ANDREW McGILL\r\n\r\nEven then I wasn\'t much worried, because of course I knew no one\r\nwould print it. But Lord! a month or so later came a letter from a\r\npublisher--accepting it! That\'s the letter Andrew keeps framed above\r\nhis desk. Just to show how such things sound I\'ll copy it here:\r\n\r\n  DECAMERON, JONES AND COMPANY\r\n  PUBLISHERS\r\n  UNION SQUARE, NEW YORK\r\n\r\n  January 13, 1907.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. McGILL:\r\n\r\nWe have read with singular pleasure your manuscript "Paradise\r\nRegained." There is no doubt in our minds that so spirited an\r\naccount of the joys of sane country living should meet with\r\npopular approval, and, with the exception of a few revisions and\r\nabbreviations, we would be glad to publish the book practically as\r\nit stands. We would like to have it illustrated by Mr. Tortoni, some\r\nof whose work you may have seen, and would be glad to know whether\r\nhe may call upon you in order to acquaint himself with the local\r\ncolour of your neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWe would be glad to pay you a royalty of 10 percent upon the retail\r\nprice of the book, and we enclose duplicate contracts for your\r\nsignature in case this proves satisfactory to you.\r\n\r\nBelieve us, etc., etc.,\r\n\r\nDECAMERON, JONES & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have since thought that "Paradise Lost" would have been a better\r\ntitle for that book. It was published in the autumn of 1907, and\r\nsince that time our life has never been the same. By some mischance\r\nthe book became the success of the season; it was widely commended\r\nas "a gospel of health and sanity" and Andrew received, in almost\r\nevery mail, offers from publishers and magazine editors who wanted\r\nto get hold of his next book. It is almost incredible to what\r\nstratagems publishers will descend to influence an author. Andrew\r\nhad written in "Paradise Regained" of the tramps who visit us, how\r\nquaint and appealing some of them are (let me add, how dirty),\r\nand how we never turn away any one who seems worthy. Would you\r\nbelieve that, in the spring after the book was published, a\r\ndisreputable-looking vagabond with a knapsack, who turned up one\r\nday, blarneyed Andrew about his book and stayed overnight, announced\r\nhimself at breakfast as a leading New York publisher? He had chosen\r\nthis ruse in order to make Andrew\'s acquaintance.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine that it didn\'t take long for Andrew to become\r\nspoiled at this rate! The next year he suddenly disappeared, leaving\r\nonly a note on the kitchen table, and tramped all over the state for\r\nsix weeks collecting material for a new book. I had all I could do\r\nto keep him from going to New York to talk to editors and people of\r\nthat sort. Envelopes of newspaper cuttings used to come to him, and\r\nhe would pore over them when he ought to have been ploughing corn.\r\nLuckily the mail man comes along about the middle of the morning\r\nwhen Andrew is out in the fields, so I used to look over the letters\r\nbefore he saw them. After the second book ("Happiness and Hayseed"\r\nit was called) was printed, letters from publishers got so thick\r\nthat I used to put them all in the stove before Andrew saw\r\nthem--except those from the Decameron Jones people, which sometimes\r\nheld checks. Literary folk used to turn up now and then to interview\r\nAndrew, but generally I managed to head them off.\r\n\r\nBut Andrew got to be less and less of a farmer and more and more\r\nof a literary man. He bought a typewriter. He would hang over the\r\npigpen noting down adjectives for the sunset instead of mending the\r\nweather vane on the barn which took a slew so that the north wind\r\ncame from the southwest. He hardly ever looked at the Sears Roebuck\r\ncatalogues any more, and after Mr. Decameron came to visit us and\r\nsuggested that Andrew write a book of country poems, the man became\r\nsimply unbearable.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time I was counting eggs and turning out three meals a\r\nday, and running the farm when Andrew got a literary fit and would\r\ngo off on some vagabond jaunt to collect adventures for a new book.\r\n(I wish you could have seen the state he was in when he came back\r\nfrom these trips, hoboing it along the roads without any money or a\r\nclean sock to his back. One time he returned with a cough you could\r\nhear the other side of the barn, and I had to nurse him for three\r\nweeks.) When somebody wrote a little booklet about "The Sage of\r\nRedfield" and described me as a "rural Xantippe" and "the domestic\r\nbalance-wheel that kept the great writer close to the homely\r\nrealities of life" I made up my mind to give Andrew some of his own\r\nmedicine. And that\'s my story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a fine, crisp morning in fall--October I dare say--and I was\r\nin the kitchen coring apples for apple sauce. We were going to have\r\nroast pork for dinner with boiled potatoes and what Andrew calls\r\nVandyke brown gravy. Andrew had driven over to town to get some\r\nflour and feed and wouldn\'t be back till noontime.\r\n\r\nBeing a Monday, Mrs. McNally, the washerwoman, had come over to take\r\ncare of the washing. I remember I was just on my way out to the wood\r\npile for a few sticks of birch when I heard wheels turn in at the\r\ngate. There was one of the fattest white horses I ever saw, and a\r\nqueer wagon, shaped like a van. A funny-looking little man with a\r\nred beard leaned forward from the seat and said something. I didn\'t\r\nhear what it was, I was looking at that preposterous wagon of his.\r\n\r\nIt was coloured a pale, robin\'s-egg blue, and on the side, in big\r\nscarlet letters, was painted:\r\n\r\n  R. MIFFLIN\'S\r\n  TRAVELLING PARNASSUS\r\n  GOOD BOOKS FOR SALE\r\n  SHAKESPEARE, CHARLES LAMB, R.L.S.\r\n  HAZLITT, AND ALL OTHERS\r\n\r\nUnderneath the wagon, in slings, hung what looked like a tent,\r\ntogether with a lantern, a bucket, and other small things. The van\r\nhad a raised skylight on the roof, something like an old-fashioned\r\ntrolley car; and from one corner went up a stove pipe. At the back\r\nwas a door with little windows on each side and a flight of steps\r\nleading up to it.\r\n\r\nAs I stood looking at this queer turnout, the little reddish man\r\nclimbed down from in front and stood watching me. His face was a\r\ncomic mixture of pleasant drollery and a sort of weather-beaten\r\ncynicism. He had a neat little russet beard and a shabby Norfolk\r\njacket. His head was very bald.\r\n\r\n"Is this where Andrew McGill lives?" he said.\r\n\r\nI admitted it.\r\n\r\n"But he\'s away until noon," I added. "He\'ll be back then. There\'s\r\nroast pork for dinner."\r\n\r\n"And apple sauce?" said the little man.\r\n\r\n"Apple sauce and brown gravy," I said. "That\'s why I\'m sure he\'ll be\r\nhome on time. Sometimes he\'s late when there\'s boiled dinner, but\r\nnever on roast pork days. Andrew would never do for a rabbi."\r\n\r\nA sudden suspicion struck me.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not another publisher, are you?" I cried. "What do you want\r\nwith Andrew?"\r\n\r\n"I was wondering whether he wouldn\'t buy this outfit," said the\r\nlittle man, including, with a wave of the hand, both van and white\r\nhorse. As he spoke he released a hook somewhere, and raised the\r\nwhole side of his wagon like a flap. Some kind of catch clicked, the\r\nflap remained up like a roof, displaying nothing but books--rows and\r\nrows of them. The flank of his van was nothing but a big bookcase.\r\nShelves stood above shelves, all of them full of books--both old and\r\nnew. As I stood gazing, he pulled out a printed card from somewhere\r\nand gave it to me:\r\n\r\n  ROGER MIFFLIN\'S\r\n  TRAVELLING PARNASSUS\r\n\r\n  Worthy friends, my wain doth hold\r\n  Many a book, both new and old;\r\n  Books, the truest friends of man,\r\n  Fill this rolling caravan.\r\n  Books to satisfy all uses,\r\n  Golden lyrics of the Muses,\r\n  Books on cookery and farming,\r\n  Novels passionate and charming,\r\n  Every kind for every need\r\n  So that he who buys may read.\r\n  What librarian can surpass us?\r\n\r\n  MIFFLIN\'S TRAVELLING PARNASSUS\r\n\r\n  By R. Mifflin, Prop\'r.\r\n\r\n  Star Job Print, Celeryville, Va.\r\n\r\nWhile I was chuckling over this, he had raised a similar flap on the\r\nother side of the Parnassus which revealed still more shelves loaded\r\nwith books.\r\n\r\nI\'m afraid I am severely practical by nature.\r\n\r\n"Well!" I said, "I should think you _would_ need a pretty stout\r\nsteed to lug that load along. It must weigh more than a coal wagon."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Peg can manage it all right," he said. "We don\'t travel very\r\nfast. But look here, I want to sell out. Do you suppose your husband\r\nwould buy the outfit--Parnassus, Pegasus, and all? He\'s fond of\r\nbooks, isn\'t he?\r\n\r\n"Hold on a minute!" I said. "Andrew\'s my brother, not my husband,\r\nand he\'s altogether _too_ fond of books. Books\'ll be the ruin of\r\nthis farm pretty soon. He\'s mooning about over his books like a\r\nsitting hen about half the time, when he ought to be mending\r\nharness. Lord, if he saw this wagonload of yours he\'d be unsettled\r\nfor a week. I have to stop the postman down the road and take all\r\nthe publishers\' catalogues out of the mail so that Andrew don\'t\r\nsee \'em. I\'m mighty glad he\'s not here just now, I can tell you!"\r\n\r\nI\'m not literary, as I said before, but I\'m human enough to like\r\na good book, and my eye was running along those shelves of his\r\nas I spoke. He certainly had a pretty miscellaneous collection.\r\nI noticed poetry, essays, novels, cook books, juveniles, school\r\nbooks, Bibles, and what not--all jumbled together.\r\n\r\n"Well, see here," said the little man--and about this time I noticed\r\nthat he had the bright eyes of a fanatic--"I\'ve been cruising with\r\nthis Parnassus going on seven years. I\'ve covered the territory from\r\nFlorida to Maine and I reckon I\'ve injected about as much good\r\nliterature into the countryside as ever old Doc Eliot did with his\r\nfive-foot shelf. I want to sell out now. I\'m going to write a book\r\nabout \'Literature Among the Farmers,\' and want to settle down with\r\nmy brother in Brooklyn and write it. I\'ve got a sackful of notes for\r\nit. I guess I\'ll just stick around until Mr. McGill gets home and\r\nsee if he won\'t buy me out. I\'ll sell the whole concern, horse,\r\nwagon, and books, for $400. I\'ve read Andrew McGill\'s stuff and I\r\nreckon the proposition\'ll interest him. I\'ve had more fun with this\r\nParnassus than a barrel of monkeys. I used to be a school teacher\r\ntill my health broke down. Then I took this up and I\'ve made more\r\nthan expenses and had the time of my life."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Mifflin," I said, "if you want to stay around I guess I\r\ncan\'t stop you. But I\'m sorry you and your old Parnassus ever came\r\nthis way."\r\n\r\nI turned on my heel and went back to the kitchen. I knew pretty well\r\nthat Andrew would go up in the air when he saw that wagonload of\r\nbooks and one of those crazy cards with Mr. Mifflin\'s poetry on it.\r\n\r\nI must confess that I was considerably upset. Andrew is just as\r\nunpractical and fanciful as a young girl, and always dreaming of\r\nnew adventures and rambles around the country. If he ever saw that\r\ntravelling Parnassus he\'d fall for it like snap. And I knew Mr.\r\nDecameron was after him for a new book anyway. (I\'d intercepted one\r\nof his letters suggesting another "Happiness and Hayseed" trip just\r\na few weeks before. Andrew was away when the letter came. I had a\r\nsuspicion what was in it; so I opened it, read it, and--well, burnt\r\nit. Heavens! as though Andrew didn\'t have enough to do without\r\nmooning down the road like a tinker, just to write a book about it.)\r\n\r\nAs I worked around the kitchen I could see Mr. Mifflin making\r\nhimself at home. He unhitched his horse, tied her up to the fence,\r\nsat down by the wood pile, and lit a pipe. I could see I was in for\r\nit. By and by I couldn\'t stand it any longer. I went out to talk to\r\nthat bald-headed pedlar.\r\n\r\n"See here," I said. "You\'re a pretty cool fish to make yourself so\r\neasy in my yard. I tell you I don\'t want you around here, you and\r\nyour travelling parcheesi. Suppose you clear out of here before my\r\nbrother gets back and don\'t be breaking up our happy family."\r\n\r\n"Miss McGill," he said (the man had a pleasant way with him,\r\ntoo--darn him--with his bright, twinkling eye and his silly little\r\nbeard), "I\'m sure I don\'t want to be discourteous. If you move me on\r\nfrom here, of course I\'ll go; but I warn you I shall lie in wait for\r\nMr. McGill just down this road. I\'m here to sell this caravan of\r\nculture, and by the bones of Swinburne I think your brother\'s the\r\nman to buy it."\r\n\r\nMy blood was up now, and I\'ll admit that I said my next without\r\nproper calculation.\r\n\r\n"Rather than have Andrew buy your old parcheesi," I said, "I\'ll buy\r\nit myself. I\'ll give you $300 for it."\r\n\r\nThe little man\'s face brightened. He didn\'t either accept or decline\r\nmy offer. (I was frightened to death that he\'d take me right on the\r\nnail and bang would go my three years\' savings for a Ford.)\r\n\r\n"Come and have another look at her," he said.\r\n\r\nI must admit that Mr. Roger Mifflin had fixed up his van mighty\r\ncomfortably inside. The body of the wagon was built out on each side\r\nover the wheels, which gave it an unwieldy appearance but made extra\r\nroom for the bookshelves. This left an inside space about five feet\r\nwide and nine long. On one side he had a little oil stove, a flap\r\ntable, and a cozy-looking bunk above which was built a kind of chest\r\nof drawers--to hold clothes and such things, I suppose; on the other\r\nside more bookshelves, a small table, and a little wicker easy\r\nchair. Every possible inch of space seemed to be made useful in some\r\nway, for a shelf or a hook or a hanging cupboard or something. Above\r\nthe stove was a neat little row of pots and dishes and cooking\r\nusefuls. The raised skylight made it just possible to stand upright\r\nin the centre aisle of the van; and a little sliding window opened\r\nonto the driver\'s seat in front. Altogether it was a very neat\r\naffair. The windows in front and back were curtained and a pot of\r\ngeraniums stood on a diminutive shelf. I was amused to see a sandy\r\nIrish terrier curled up on a bright Mexican blanket in the bunk.\r\n\r\n"Miss McGill," he said, "I couldn\'t sell Parnassus for less than\r\nfour hundred. I\'ve put twice that much into her, one time and\r\nanother. She\'s built clean and solid all through, and there\'s\r\neverything a man would need from blankets to bouillon cubes. The\r\nwhole thing\'s yours for $400--including dog, cook stove, and\r\neverything--jib, boom, and spanker. There\'s a tent in a sling\r\nunderneath, and an ice box (he pulled up a little trap door under\r\nthe bunk) and a tank of coal oil and Lord knows what all. She\'s as\r\ngood as a yacht; but I\'m tired of her. If you\'re so afraid of your\r\nbrother taking a fancy to her, why don\'t you buy her yourself and\r\ngo off on a lark? Make _him_ stay home and mind the farm!... Tell\r\nyou what I\'ll do. I\'ll start you on the road myself, come with you\r\nthe first day and show you how it\'s worked. You could have the time\r\nof your life in this thing, and give yourself a fine vacation. It\r\nwould give your brother a good surprise, too. Why not?"\r\n\r\nI don\'t know whether it was the neatness of his absurd little van,\r\nor the madness of the whole proposition, or just the desire to have\r\nan adventure of my own and play a trick on Andrew, but anyway, some\r\nextraordinary impulse seized me and I roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n"Right!" I said. "I\'ll do it."\r\n\r\nI, Helen McGill, in the thirty-ninth year of my age!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well," I thought, "if I\'m in for an adventure I may as well be spry\r\nabout it. Andrew\'ll be home by half-past twelve and if I\'m going to\r\ngive him the slip I\'d better get a start. I suppose he\'ll think I\'m\r\ncrazy! He\'ll follow me, I guess. Well, he just shan\'t catch me,\r\nthat\'s all!" A kind of anger came over me to think that I\'d been\r\nliving on that farm for nearly fifteen years--yes, sir, ever since\r\nI was twenty-five--and hardly ever been away except for that trip\r\nto Boston once a year to go shopping with cousin Edie. I\'m a\r\nhome-keeping soul, I guess, and I love my kitchen and my preserve\r\ncupboard and my linen closet as well as grandmother ever did, but\r\nsomething in that blue October air and that crazy little red-bearded\r\nman just tickled me.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Mr. Parnassus," I said, "I guess I\'m a fat old fool but\r\nI just believe I\'ll do that. You hitch up your horse and van and\r\nI\'ll go pack some clothes and write you a check. It\'ll do Andrew all\r\nthe good in the world to have me skip. I\'ll get a chance to read a\r\nfew books, too. It\'ll be as good as going to college!" And I untied\r\nmy apron and ran for the house. The little man stood leaning against\r\na corner of the van as if he were stupefied. I dare say he was.\r\n\r\nI ran into the house through the front door, and it struck me as\r\ncomical to see a copy of one of Andrew\'s magazines lying on the\r\nliving-room table with "The Revolt of Womanhood" printed across\r\nit in red letters. "Here goes for the revolt of Helen McGill," I\r\nthought. I sat down at Andrew\'s desk, pushed aside a pad of notes\r\nhe had been jotting down about "the magic of autumn," and scrawled\r\na few lines:\r\n\r\nDEAR ANDREW,\r\n\r\nDon\'t be thinking I\'m crazy. I\'ve gone off for an adventure. It just\r\ncame over me that you\'ve had all the adventures while I\'ve been at\r\nhome baking bread. Mrs. McNally will look after your meals and one\r\nof her girls can come over to do the housework. So don\'t worry. I\'m\r\ngoing off for a little while--a month, maybe--to see some of this\r\nhappiness and hayseed of yours. It\'s what the magazines call the\r\nrevolt of womanhood. Warm underwear in the cedar chest in the spare\r\nroom when you need it. With love, HELEN.\r\n\r\nI left the note on his desk.\r\n\r\nMrs. McNally was bending over the tubs in the laundry. I could see\r\nonly the broad arch of her back and hear the vigorous zzzzzzz of her\r\nrubbing. She straightened up at my call.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. McNally," I said, "I\'m going away for a little trip. You\'d\r\nbetter let the washing go until this afternoon and get Andrew\'s\r\ndinner for him. He\'ll be back about twelve-thirty. It\'s half-past\r\nten now. You tell him I\'ve gone over to see Mrs. Collins at Locust\r\nFarm."\r\n\r\nMrs. McNally is a brawny, slow-witted Swede. "All right Mis\'\r\nMcGill," she said. "You be back to denner?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not coming back for a month," I said. "I\'m going away for\r\na trip. I want you to send Rosie over here every day to do the\r\nhousework while I\'m away. You can arrange with Mr. McGill about\r\nthat. I\'ve got to hurry now."\r\n\r\nMrs. McNally\'s honest eyes, as blue as Copenhagen china, gazing\r\nthrough the window in perplexity, fell upon the travelling Parnassus\r\nand Mr. Mifflin backing Pegasus into the shafts. I saw her make a\r\nvaliant effort to comprehend the sign painted on the side of the\r\nvan--and give it up.\r\n\r\n"You going driving?" she said blankly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, and fled upstairs.\r\n\r\nI always keep my bank book in an old Huyler box in the top drawer\r\nof my bureau. I don\'t save very quickly, I\'m afraid. I have a\r\nlittle income from some money father left me, but Andrew takes care\r\nof that. Andrew pays all the farm expenses, but the housekeeping\r\naccounts fall to me. I make a fairish amount of pin money on my\r\npoultry and some of my preserves that I send to Boston, and on some\r\nrecipes of mine that I send to a woman\'s magazine now and then; but\r\ngenerally my savings don\'t amount to much over $10 a month. In the\r\nlast five years I had put by something more than $600. I had been\r\nsaving up for a Ford. But just now it looked to me as if that\r\nParnassus would be more fun than a Ford ever could be. Four hundred\r\ndollars was a lot of money, but I thought of what it would mean\r\nto have Andrew come home and buy it. Why, he\'d be away until\r\nThanksgiving! Whereas if I bought it I could take it away, have my\r\nadventure, and sell it somewhere so that Andrew never need see it.\r\nI hardened my heart and determined to give the Sage of Redfield\r\nsome of his own medicine.\r\n\r\nMy balance at the Redfield National Bank was $615.20. I sat down at\r\nthe table in my bedroom where I keep my accounts and wrote out a\r\ncheck to Roger Mifflin for $400. I put in plenty of curlicues after\r\nthe figures so that no one could raise the check into $400,000; then\r\nI got out my old rattan suit case and put in some clothes. The whole\r\nbusiness didn\'t take me ten minutes. I came downstairs to find Mrs.\r\nMcNally looking sourly at the Parnassus from the kitchen door.\r\n\r\n"You going away in that--that \'bus, Mis\' McGill?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mrs. McNally," I said cheerfully. Her use of the word gave me\r\nan inspiration. "That\'s one of the new jitney \'buses we hear about.\r\nHe\'s going to take me to the station. Don\'t you worry about me. I\'m\r\ngoing for a holiday. You get Mr. McGill\'s dinner ready for him.\r\nAfter dinner tell him there\'s a note for him in the living-room."\r\n\r\n"I tank that bane a queer \'bus," said Mrs. McNally, puzzled. I think\r\nthe excellent woman suspected an elopement.\r\n\r\nI carried my suit case out to the Parnassus. Pegasus stood placidly\r\nbetween the shafts. From within came sounds of vigorous movement. In\r\na moment the little man burst out with a bulging portmanteau in his\r\nhand. He had a tweed cap slanted on the back of his head.\r\n\r\n"There!" he cried triumphantly. "I\'ve packed all my personal\r\neffects--clothes and so on--and everything else goes with the\r\ntransaction. When I get on the train with this bag I\'m a free man,\r\nand hurrah for Brooklyn! Lord, won\'t I be glad to get back to the\r\ncity! I lived in Brooklyn once, and I haven\'t been back there for\r\nten years," he added plaintively.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s the check," I said, handing it to him. He flushed a little,\r\nand looked at me rather shamefacedly. "See here," he said, "I hope\r\nyou\'re not making a bad bargain? I don\'t want to take advantage of a\r\nlady. If you think your brother...."\r\n\r\n"I was going to buy a Ford, anyway," I said, "and it looks to me\r\nas though this parcheesi of yours would be cheaper to run than any\r\nflivver that ever came out of Detroit. I want to keep it away from\r\nAndrew and that\'s the main thing. You give me a receipt and we\'ll\r\nget away from here before he comes back."\r\n\r\nHe took the check without a word, hoisted his fat portmanteau on the\r\ndriver\'s seat, and then disappeared in the van. In a minute he\r\nreappeared. On the back of one of his poetical cards he had written:\r\n\r\nReceived from Miss McGill the sum of four hundred dollars in\r\nexchange for one Travelling Parnassus in first class condition,\r\ndelivered to her this day, October 3rd, 19--.\r\n\r\nSigned\r\nROGER MIFFLIN.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," I said, "does your Parnassus--_my_ Parnassus,\r\nrather--contain everything I\'m likely to need? Is it stocked up\r\nwith food and so on?"\r\n\r\n"I was coming to that," he said. "You\'ll find a fair supply of stuff\r\nin the cupboard over the stove, though I used to get most of my\r\nmeals at farmhouses along the road. I generally read aloud to people\r\nas I go along, and they\'re often good for a free meal. It\'s amazing\r\nhow little most of the country folk know about books, and how\r\npleased they are to hear good stuff. Down in Lancaster County,\r\nPennsylvania...."\r\n\r\n"Well, how about the horse?" I said hastily, seeing him about to\r\nembark on an anecdote. It wasn\'t far short of eleven o\'clock, and I\r\nwas anxious to get started.\r\n\r\n"It might be well to take along some oats. My supply\'s about\r\nexhausted."\r\n\r\nI filled a sack with oats in the stable and Mr. Mifflin showed me\r\nwhere to hang it under the van. Then in the kitchen I loaded a big\r\nbasket with provisions for an emergency: a dozen eggs, a jar of\r\nsliced bacon, butter, cheese, condensed milk, tea, biscuits, jam,\r\nand two loaves of bread. These Mr. Mifflin stowed inside the van,\r\nMrs. McNally watching in amazement.\r\n\r\n"I tank this bane a queer picnic!" she said. "Which way are you\r\ngoing? Mr. McGill, is he coming after you?"\r\n\r\n"No," I insisted, "he\'s not coming. I\'m going off on a holiday. You\r\nget dinner for him and he won\'t worry about anything until after\r\nthat. Tell him I\'ve gone over to see Mrs. Collins."\r\n\r\nI climbed the little steps and entered my Parnassus with a pleasant\r\nthrill of ownership. The terrier on the bunk jumped to the floor\r\nwith a friendly wag of the tail. I piled the bunk with bedding and\r\nblankets of my own, shook out the drawers which fitted above the\r\nbunk, and put into them what few belongings I was taking with me.\r\nAnd we were ready to start.\r\n\r\nRedbeard was already sitting in front with the reins in hand. I\r\nclimbed up beside him. The front seat was broad but uncushioned,\r\nwell sheltered by the peak of the van. I gave a quick glance around\r\nat the comfortable house under its elms and maples--saw the big, red\r\nbarn shining in the sun and the pump under the grape arbour. I waved\r\ngood-bye to Mrs. McNally who was watching us in silent amazement.\r\nPegasus threw her solid weight against the traces and Parnassus\r\nswung round and rolled past the gate. We turned into the Redfield\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Mifflin, handing me the reins, "you\'re skipper, you\'d\r\nbetter drive. Which way do you want to go?"\r\n\r\nMy breath came a little fast when I realized that my adventure had\r\nbegun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nJust out of sight of the farm the road forks, one way running on\r\nto Walton where you cross the river by a covered bridge, the other\r\nswinging down toward Greenbriar and Port Vigor. Mrs. Collins lives a\r\nmile or so up the Walton road, and as I very often run over to see\r\nher I thought Andrew would be most likely to look for me there. So,\r\nafter we had passed through the grove, I took the right-hand turn to\r\nGreenbriar. We began the long ascent over Huckleberry Hill and as I\r\nsmelt the fresh autumn odour of the leaves I chuckled a little.\r\n\r\nMr. Mifflin seemed in a perfect ecstasy of high spirits. "This is\r\ncertainly grand," he said. "Lord, I applaud your spunk. Do you think\r\nMr. McGill will give chase?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t an idea," I said. "Not right away, anyhow. He\'s so used\r\nto my settled ways that I don\'t think he\'ll suspect anything till he\r\nfinds my note. I wonder what kind of story Mrs. McNally will tell!"\r\n\r\n"How about putting him off the scent?" he said. "Give me your\r\nhandkerchief."\r\n\r\nI did so. He hopped nimbly out, ran back down the hill (he was a\r\nspry little person in spite of his bald crown), and dropped the\r\nhandkerchief on the Walton Road about a hundred feet beyond the\r\nfork. Then he followed me up the slope.\r\n\r\n"There," he said, grinning like a kid, "that\'ll fool him. The Sage\r\nof Redfield will undoubtedly follow a false spoor and the criminals\r\nwill win a good start. But I\'m afraid it\'s rather easy to follow a\r\ncraft as unusual as Parnassus."\r\n\r\n"Tell me how you manage the thing," I said. "Do you really make it\r\npay?" We halted at the top of the hill to give Pegasus a breathing\r\nspace. The terrier lay down in the dust and watched us gravely. Mr.\r\nMifflin pulled out a pipe and begged my permission to smoke.\r\n\r\n"It\'s rather comical how I first got into it," he said. "I was a\r\nschool teacher down in Maryland. I\'d been plugging away in a country\r\nschool for years, on a starvation salary. I was trying to support an\r\ninvalid mother, and put by something in case of storms. I remember\r\nhow I used to wonder whether I\'d ever be able to wear a suit that\r\nwasn\'t shabby and have my shoes polished every day. Then my health\r\nwent back on me. The doctor told me to get into the open air. By and\r\nby I got this idea of a travelling bookstore. I had always been a\r\nlover of books, and in the days when I boarded out among the farmers\r\nI used to read aloud to them. After my mother died I built the wagon\r\nto suit my own ideas, bought a stock of books from a big second-hand\r\nstore in Baltimore, and set out. Parnassus just about saved my life\r\nI guess."\r\n\r\nHe pushed his faded old cap back on his head and relit his pipe.\r\nI clicked to Pegasus and we rumbled gently off over the upland,\r\nlooking down across the pastures. Distant cow bells sounded\r\ntankle-tonk among the bushes. Across the slope of the hill I could\r\nsee the road winding away to Redfield. Somewhere along that road\r\nAndrew would be rolling back toward home and roast pork with apple\r\nsauce; and here was I, setting out on the first madness of my life\r\nwithout even a qualm.\r\n\r\n"Miss McGill," said the little man, "this rolling pavilion has been\r\nwife, doctor, and religion to me for seven years. A month ago I\r\nwould have scoffed at the thought of leaving her; but somehow it\'s\r\ncome over me I need a change. There\'s a book I\'ve been yearning to\r\nwrite for a long time, and I need a desk steady under my elbows and\r\na roof over my head. And silly as it seems, I\'m crazy to get back\r\nto Brooklyn. My brother and I used to live there as kids. Think\r\nof walking over the old Bridge at sunset and seeing the towers of\r\nManhattan against a red sky! And those old gray cruisers down in the\r\nNavy Yard! You don\'t know how tickled I am to sell out. I\'ve sold a\r\nlot of copies of your brother\'s books and I\'ve often thought he\'d be\r\nthe man to buy Parnassus if I got tired of her."\r\n\r\n"So he would," I said. "Just the man. He\'d be only too likely\r\nto--and go maundering about in this jaunting car and neglect the\r\nfarm. But tell me about selling books. How much profit do you make\r\nout of it? We\'ll be passing Mrs. Mason\'s farm, by and by, and we\r\nmight as well sell her something just to make a start."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very simple," he said. "I replenish my stock whenever I go\r\nthrough a big town. There\'s always a second-hand bookstore somewhere\r\nabout, where you can pick up odds and ends. And every now and then I\r\nwrite to a wholesaler in New York for some stuff. When I buy a book\r\nI mark in the back just what I paid for it, then I know what I can\r\nafford to sell it for. See here."\r\n\r\nHe pulled up a book from behind the seat--a copy of "Lorna Doone" it\r\nwas--and showed me the letters _a m_ scrawled in pencil in the back.\r\n\r\n"That means that I paid ten cents for this. Now, if you sell it for\r\na quarter you\'ve got a safe profit. It costs me about four dollars a\r\nweek to run Parnassus--generally less. If you clear that much in six\r\ndays you can afford to lay off on Sundays!"\r\n\r\n"How do you know that _a m_ stands for ten cents?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"The code word\'s _manuscript_. Each letter stands for a figure,\r\nfrom 0 up to 9, see?" He scrawled it down on a scrap of paper:\r\n\r\n  m a n u s c r i p t\r\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\r\n\r\n"Now, you see _a m_ stands for 10, _a n_ would be 12, _n s_ is 24,\r\n_a c_ is 15, _a m m_ is $1.00, and so on. I don\'t pay much over\r\nfifty cents for books as a rule, because country folks are shy of\r\npaying much for them. They\'ll pay a lot for a separator or a buggy\r\ntop, but they\'ve never been taught to worry about literature! But\r\nit\'s surprising how excited they get about books if you sell \'em the\r\nright kind. Over beyond Port Vigor there\'s a farmer who\'s waiting\r\nfor me to go back--I\'ve been there three or four times--and he\'ll\r\nbuy about five dollars\' worth if I know him. First time I went there\r\nI sold him \'Treasure Island,\' and he\'s talking about it yet. I sold\r\nhim \'Robinson Crusoe,\' and \'Little Women\' for his daughter, and\r\n\'Huck Finn,\' and Grubb\'s book about \'The Potato.\' Last time I was\r\nthere he wanted some Shakespeare, but I wouldn\'t give it to him.\r\nI didn\'t think he was up to it yet."\r\n\r\nI began to see something of the little man\'s idealism in his work.\r\nHe was a kind of traveling missionary in his way. A hefty talker,\r\ntoo. His eyes were twinkling now and I could see him warming up.\r\n\r\n"Lord!" he said, "when you sell a man a book you don\'t sell him\r\njust twelve ounces of paper and ink and glue--you sell him a whole\r\nnew life. Love and friendship and humour and ships at sea by\r\nnight--there\'s all heaven and earth in a book, a real book I mean.\r\nJiminy! If I were the baker or the butcher or the broom huckster,\r\npeople would run to the gate when I came by--just waiting for my\r\nstuff. And here I go loaded with everlasting salvation--yes, ma\'am,\r\nsalvation for their little, stunted minds--and it\'s hard to make \'em\r\nsee it. That\'s what makes it worth while--I\'m doing something that\r\nnobody else from Nazareth, Maine, to Walla Walla, Washington, has\r\never thought of. It\'s a new field, but by the bones of Whitman it\'s\r\nworth while. That\'s what this country needs--more books!"\r\n\r\nHe laughed at his own vehemence. "Do you know, it\'s comical," he\r\nsaid. "Even the publishers, the fellows that print the books,\r\ncan\'t see what I\'m doing for them. Some of \'em refuse me credit\r\nbecause I sell their books for what they\'re worth instead of\r\nfor the prices they mark on them. They write me letters about\r\nprice-maintenance--and I write back about merit-maintenance.\r\nPublish a good book and I\'ll get a good price for it, say I!\r\nSometimes I think the publishers know less about books than any\r\none else! I guess that\'s natural, though. Most school teachers\r\ndon\'t know much about children."\r\n\r\n"The best of it is," he went on, "I have such a darn good time.\r\nPeg and Bock (that\'s the dog) and I go loafing along the road on\r\na warm summer day, and by and by we\'ll fetch up alongside some\r\nboarding-house and there are the boarders all rocking off their\r\nlunch on the veranda. Most of \'em bored to death--nothing good to\r\nread, nothing to do but sit and watch the flies buzzing in the sun\r\nand the chickens rubbing up and down in the dust. First thing you\r\nknow I\'ll sell half a dozen books that put the love of life into\r\nthem, and they don\'t forget Parnassus in a hurry. Take O. Henry, for\r\ninstance--there isn\'t anybody so dog-gone sleepy that he won\'t enjoy\r\nthat man\'s stories. He understood life, you bet, and he could write\r\nit down with all its little twists. I\'ve spent an evening reading O.\r\nHenry and Wilkie Collins to people and had them buy out all their\r\nbooks I had and clamour for more."\r\n\r\n"What do you do in winter?" I asked--a practical question, as most\r\nof mine are.\r\n\r\n"That depends on where I am when bad weather sets in," said Mr.\r\nMifflin. "Two winters I was down south and managed to keep Parnassus\r\ngoing all through the season. Otherwise, I just lay up wherever I\r\nam. I\'ve never found it hard to get lodging for Peg and a job for\r\nmyself, if I had to have them. Last winter I worked in a bookstore\r\nin Boston. Winter before, I was in a country drugstore down in\r\nPennsylvania. Winter before that, I tutored a couple of small boys\r\nin English literature. Winter before that, I was a steward on a\r\nsteamer; you see how it goes. I\'ve had a fairly miscellaneous\r\nexperience. As far as I can see, a man who\'s fond of books never\r\nneed starve! But this winter I\'m planning to live with my brother in\r\nBrooklyn and slog away at my book. Lord, how I\'ve pondered over that\r\nthing! Long summer afternoons I\'ve sat here, jogging along in the\r\ndust, thinking it out until it seemed as if my forehead would burst.\r\nYou see, my idea is that the common people--in the country, that\r\nis--never have had any chance to get hold of books, and never have\r\nhad any one to explain what books can mean. It\'s all right for\r\ncollege presidents to draw up their five-foot shelves of great\r\nliterature, and for the publishers to advertise sets of their\r\nLinoleum Classics, but what the people need is the good, homely,\r\nhonest stuff--something that\'ll stick to their ribs--make them laugh\r\nand tremble and feel sick to think of the littleness of this popcorn\r\nball spinning in space without ever even getting a hot-box! And\r\nsomething that\'ll spur \'em on to keep the hearth well swept and the\r\nwood pile split into kindling and the dishes washed and dried and\r\nput away. Any one who can get the country people to read something\r\nworth while is doing his nation a real service. And that\'s what\r\nthis caravan of culture aspires to.... You must be weary of this\r\nharangue! Does the Sage of Redfield ever run on like that?"\r\n\r\n"Not to me," I said. "He\'s known me so long that he thinks of me as\r\na kind of animated bread-baking and cake-mixing machine. I guess he\r\ndoesn\'t put much stock in my judgment in literary matters. But he\r\nputs his digestion in my hands without reserve. There\'s Mason\'s\r\nfarm over there. I guess we\'d better sell them some books--hadn\'t\r\nwe? Just for a starter."\r\n\r\nWe turned into the lane that runs up to the Mason farmhouse. Bock\r\ntrotted on ahead--very stiff on his legs and his tail gently\r\nwagging--to interview the mastiff, and Mrs. Mason who was sitting\r\non the porch, peeling potatoes, laid down the pan. She\'s a big,\r\nbuxom woman with jolly, brown eyes like a cow\'s.\r\n\r\n"For heaven\'s sake, Miss McGill," she called out in a cheerful\r\nvoice--"I\'m glad to see you. Got a lift, did you?"\r\n\r\nShe hadn\'t really noticed the inscription on Parnassus, and thought\r\nit was a regular huckster\'s wagon.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mrs. Mason," I said, "I\'ve gone into the book business. This\r\nis Mr. Mifflin. I\'ve bought out his stock. We\'ve come to sell you\r\nsome books."\r\n\r\nShe laughed. "Go on, Helen," she said, "you can\'t kid me! I bought\r\na whole set of books last year from an agent--\'The World\'s Great\r\nFuneral Orations\'--twenty volumes. Sam and I ain\'t read more\'n the\r\nfirst volume yet. It\'s awful uneasy reading!"\r\n\r\nMifflin jumped down, and raised the side flap of the wagon. Mrs.\r\nMason came closer. I was tickled to see how the little man perked\r\nup at the sight of a customer. Evidently selling books was meat\r\nand drink to him.\r\n\r\n"Madam," he said, "\'Funeral Orations\' (bound in sackcloth, I\r\nsuppose?) have their place, but Miss McGill and I have got some real\r\nbooks here to which I invite your attention. Winter will be here\r\nsoon, and you will need something more cheerful to beguile your\r\nevenings. Very possibly you have growing children who would profit\r\nby a good book or two. A book of fairy tales for the little girl I\r\nsee on the porch? Or stories of inventors for that boy who is about\r\nto break his neck jumping from the barn loft? Or a book about road\r\nmaking for your husband? Surely there is something here you need?\r\nMiss McGill probably knows your tastes."\r\n\r\nThat little red-bearded man was surely a born salesman. How he\r\nguessed that Mr. Mason was the road commissioner in our township,\r\ngoodness only knows. Perhaps it was just a lucky shot. By this\r\ntime most of the family had gathered around the van, and I saw Mr.\r\nMason coming from the barn with his twelve-year-old Billy.\r\n\r\n"Sam," shouted Mrs. Mason, "here\'s Miss McGill turned book pedlar\r\nand got a preacher with her!"\r\n\r\n"Hello, Miss McGill," said Mr. Mason. He is a big, slow-moving man\r\nof great gravity and solidity. "Where\'s Andrew?"\r\n\r\n"Andrew\'s coming home for roast pork and apple sauce," I said, "and\r\nI\'m going off to sell books for a living. Mr. Mifflin here is\r\nteaching me how. We\'ve got a book on road mending that\'s just what\r\nyou need."\r\n\r\nI saw Mr. and Mrs. Mason exchange glances. Evidently they thought me\r\ncrazy. I began to wonder whether we had made a mistake in calling on\r\npeople I knew so well. The situation was a trifle embarrassing.\r\n\r\nMr. Mifflin came to the rescue.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be alarmed, sir," he said to Mr. Mason. "I haven\'t kidnapped\r\nMiss McGill." (As he is about half my size this was amusing.) "We\r\nare trying to increase her brother\'s income by selling his books for\r\nhim. As a matter of fact, we have a wager with him that we can sell\r\nfifty copies of \'Happiness and Hayseed\' before Hallowe\'en. Now I\'m\r\nsure your sporting instinct will assist us by taking at least one\r\ncopy. Andrew McGill is probably the greatest author in this State,\r\nand every taxpayer ought to possess his books. May I show you a\r\ncopy?"\r\n\r\n"That sounds reasonable," said Mr. Mason, and he almost smiled.\r\n"What do you say, Emma, think we better buy a book or two? You know\r\nthose \'Funeral Orations.\'..." "Well," said Emma, "you know we\'ve\r\nalways said we ought to read one of Andrew McGill\'s books but we\r\ndidn\'t rightly know how to get hold of one. That fellow that sold us\r\nthe funeral speeches didn\'t seem to know about \'em. I tell you what,\r\nyou folks better stop and have dinner with us and you can tell us\r\nwhat we\'d ought to buy. I\'m just ready to put the potatoes on the\r\nstove now."\r\n\r\nI must confess that the prospect of sitting down to a meal I hadn\'t\r\ncooked myself appealed to me strongly; and I was keen to see what\r\nkind of grub Mrs. Mason provided for her household; but I was\r\nafraid that if we dallied there too long Andrew would be after us. I\r\nwas about to say that we would have to be getting on, and couldn\'t\r\nstay; but apparently the zest of expounding his philosophy to new\r\nlisteners was too much for Mifflin. I heard him saying:\r\n\r\n"That\'s mighty kind of you, Mrs. Mason, and we\'d like very much to\r\nstay. Perhaps I can put Peg up in your barn for a while. Then we can\r\ntell you all about our books." And to my amazement I found myself\r\nchiming in with assent.\r\n\r\nMifflin certainly surpassed himself at dinner. The fact that\r\nMrs. Mason\'s hot biscuits tasted of saleratus gave me far less\r\nsatisfaction than it otherwise would, because I was absorbed in\r\nlistening to the little vagabond\'s talk. Mr. Mason came to the table\r\ngrumbling something about his telephone being out of order--(I\r\nwondered whether he had been trying to get Andrew on the wire; he\r\nwas a little afraid that I was being run away with, I think)--but\r\nhe was soon won over by the current of the little man\'s cheery wit.\r\nNothing daunted Mifflin. He talked to the old grandmother about\r\nquilts; offered to cut off a strip of his necktie for her new\r\npatchwork; and told all about the illustrated book on quilts that he\r\nhad in the van. He discussed cookery and the Bible with Mrs. Mason;\r\nand she being a leading light in the Greenbriar Sunday School, was\r\npleasantly scandalized by his account of the best detective stories\r\nin the Old Testament. With Mr. Mason he was all scientific farming,\r\nchemical manures, macadam roads, and crop rotation; and to little\r\nBilly (who sat next him) he told extraordinary yarns about Daniel\r\nBoone, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson, Buffalo Bill, and what not.\r\nHonestly I was amazed at the little man. He was as genial as a\r\ncricket on the hearth, and yet every now and then his earnestness\r\nwould break through. I don\'t wonder he was a success at selling\r\nbooks. That man could sell clothes pins or Paris garters, I guess,\r\nand make them seem romantic.\r\n\r\n"You know, Mr. Mason," he said, "you certainly owe it to these\r\nyoungsters of yours to put a few really good books into their hands.\r\nCity kids have the libraries to go to, but in the country there\'s\r\nonly old Doc Hostetter\'s Almanac and the letters written by ladies\r\nwith backache telling how Peruna did for them. Give this boy and\r\ngirl of yours a few good books and you\'re starting them on the\r\ndouble-track, block-signal line to happiness. Now there\'s \'Little\r\nWomen\'--that girl of yours can learn more about real girlhood and\r\nfine womanhood out of that book than from a year\'s paper dolls in\r\nthe attic."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Pa," assented Mrs. Mason. ("Go on with your meal,\r\nProfessor, the meat\'ll be cold.") She was completely won by the\r\ntravelling bookseller, and had given him the highest title of honour\r\nin her ken. "Why, I read that story when I was a girl, and I still\r\nremember it. That\'s better readin\' for Dorothy than those funeral\r\nspeeches, I reckon. I believe the Professor\'s right: we\'d ought to\r\nhave more books laying around. Seems kind of a shame, with a famous\r\nauthor at the next farm, not to read more, don\'t it, now?"\r\n\r\nSo by the time we got down to Mrs. Mason\'s squash pie (good pie,\r\ntoo, I admit, but her hand is a little heavy for pastry), the whole\r\nhousehold was enthusiastic about books, and the atmosphere was\r\nliterary enough for even Dr. Eliot to live in without panting. Mrs.\r\nMason opened up her parlour and we sat there while Mifflin recited\r\n"The Revenge" and "Maud Muller."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, ain\'t that real sweet!" said Emma Mason. "It\'s\r\nsurprising how those words rhyme so nicely. Seems almost as though\r\nit was done a-purpose! Reminds me of piece day at school. There\r\nwas a mighty pretty piece I learned called the \'Wreck of the\r\nAsperus.\'" And she subsided into a genteel melancholy.\r\n\r\nI saw that Mr. Mifflin was well astride his hobby: he had started to\r\ntell the children about Robin Hood, but I had the sense to give him\r\na wink. We had to be getting along or surely Andrew might be on us.\r\nSo while Mifflin was putting Pegasus into the shafts again I picked\r\nout seven or eight books that I thought would fit the needs of the\r\nMasons. Mr. Mason insisted that "Happiness and Hayseed" be included\r\namong them, and gave me a crisp five-dollar bill, refusing any\r\nchange. "No, no," he said, "I\'ve had more fun than I get at a grange\r\nmeeting. Come round again, Miss McGill; I\'m going to tell Andrew\r\nwhat a good show this travelling theayter of yours gives! And you,\r\nProfessor, any time you\'re here about road-mending season, stop in\r\nan\' tell me some more good advice. Well, I must get back to the\r\nfield."\r\n\r\nBock fell in under the van, and we creaked off down the lane.\r\nMifflin filled his pipe and was chuckling to himself. I was a little\r\nworried now for fear Andrew might overtake us.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a wonder Sam Mason didn\'t call up Andrew," I said. "It must\r\nhave looked mighty queer to him for an old farm hand like me to be\r\naround, peddling books."\r\n\r\n"He would have done it straight off," said Mifflin, "but you see, I\r\ncut his telephone wire!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nI gazed in astonishment at the wizened little rogue. Here was a\r\nnew side to the amiable idealist! Apparently there was a streak of\r\nfearless deviltry in him besides his gentle love of books. I\'m bound\r\nto say that now, for the first time, I really admired him. I had\r\nburnt my own very respectable boats behind me, and I rather enjoyed\r\nknowing that he, too, could act briskly in a pinch.\r\n\r\n"Well!" I said. "You are a cool hand! It\'s a good job for you that\r\nyou didn\'t stay a schoolmaster. You might have taught your pupils\r\nsome fine deviltries! And at your age, too!"\r\n\r\nI\'m afraid my raillery goes a little too far sometimes. He flushed\r\na bit at my reference to his age, and puffed sharply at his pipe.\r\n\r\n"I say," he rejoined, "how old do you think I am, anyway? Only\r\nforty-one, by the bones of Byron! Henry VIII was only forty-one\r\nwhen he married Anne Boleyn. There are many consolations in history\r\nfor people over forty! Remember that when you get there.\r\n\r\n"Shakespeare wrote \'King Lear\' at forty-one," he added, more\r\nhumorously; and then burst out laughing. "I\'d like to edit a series\r\nof \'Chloroform Classics,\' to include only books written after forty.\r\nWho was that doctor man who recommended anaesthetics for us at that\r\nage? Now isn\'t that just like a medico? Nurse us through the\r\ndiseases of childhood, and as soon as we settle down into permanent\r\ngood health and worldly wisdom, and freedom from doctors\' fees, why\r\nhe loses interest in us! Jove! I must note that down and bring it\r\ninto my book."\r\n\r\nHe pulled out a memorandum book and jotted down "Chloroform\r\nClassics" in a small, neat hand.\r\n\r\n"Well," I said (I felt a little contrite, as I was sincerely\r\nsorry to have offended him), "I\'ve passed forty myself in some\r\nmeasurements, so youth no longer has any terrors for me."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me rather comically.\r\n\r\n"My dear madam," he said, "your age is precisely eighteen. I think\r\nthat if we escape the clutches of the Sage of Redfield you may\r\nreally begin to live."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Andrew\'s not a bad sort," I said. "He\'s absentminded, and hot\r\ntempered, and a little selfish. The publishers have done their best\r\nto spoil him, but for a literary man I guess he\'s quite human. He\r\nrescued me from being a governess, and that\'s to his credit. If only\r\nhe didn\'t take his meals quite so much as a matter of course...."\r\n\r\n"The preposterous thing about him is that he really can _write_,"\r\nsaid Mifflin. "I envy him that. Don\'t let him know I said so, but\r\nas a matter of fact his prose is almost as good as Thoreau. He\r\napproaches facts as daintily as a cat crossing a wet road."\r\n\r\n"You should see him at dinner," I thought; or rather I meant to\r\nthink it, but the words slipped out. I found myself thinking aloud\r\nin a rather disconcerting way while sitting with this strange\r\nlittle person.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me. I noticed for the first time that his eyes were\r\nslate blue, with funny birds\' foot wrinkles at the corners.\r\n\r\n"That\'s so," he said. "I never thought of that. A fine prose style\r\ncertainly presupposes sound nourishment. Excellent point that...\r\nAnd yet Thoreau did his own cooking. A sort of Boy Scout I guess,\r\nwith a badge as kitchen master. Perhaps he took Beechnut bacon with\r\nhim into the woods. I wonder who cooked for Stevenson--Cummy? The\r\n\'Child\'s Garden of Verses\' was really a kind of kitchen garden,\r\nwasn\'t it? I\'m afraid the commissariat problem has weighed rather\r\nheavily on you. I\'m glad you\'ve got away from it."\r\n\r\nAll this was getting rather intricate for me. I set it down as I\r\nremember it, inaccurately perhaps. My governess days are pretty\r\nfar astern now, and my line is common sense rather than literary\r\nallusions. I said something of the sort.\r\n\r\n"Common sense?" he repeated. "Good Lord, ma\'am, sense is the most\r\nuncommon thing in the world. I haven\'t got it. I don\'t believe your\r\nbrother has, from what you say. Bock here has it. See how he trots\r\nalong the road, keeps an eye on the scenery, and minds his own\r\nbusiness. I never saw him get into a fight yet. Wish I could say the\r\nsame of myself. I named him after Boccaccio, to remind me to read\r\nthe \'Decameron\' some day."\r\n\r\n"Judging by the way you talk," I said, "you ought to be quite a\r\nwriter yourself."\r\n\r\n"Talkers never write. They go on talking."\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable silence. Mifflin relit his pipe and watched\r\nthe landscape with a shrewd eye. I held the reins loosely, and Peg\r\nambled along with a steady clop-clop. Parnassus creaked musically,\r\nand the mid-afternoon sun lay rich across the road. We passed\r\nanother farm, but I did not suggest stopping as I felt we ought to\r\npush on. Mifflin seemed lost in meditation, and I began to wonder,\r\na little uneasily, how the adventure would turn out. This quaintly\r\nmasterful little man was a trifle disconcerting. Across the next\r\nridge I could see the Greenbriar church spire shining white.\r\n\r\n"Do you know this part of the country?" I asked finally.\r\n\r\n"Not this exact section. I\'ve been in Port Vigor often, but then I\r\nwas on the road that runs along the Sound. I suppose this village\r\nahead is Greenbriar?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "It\'s about thirteen miles from there to Port Vigor.\r\nHow do you expect to get back to Brooklyn?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Brooklyn?" he said vaguely. "Yes, I\'d forgotten about Brooklyn\r\nfor the minute. I was thinking of my book. Why, I guess I\'ll take\r\nthe train from Port Vigor. The trouble is, you can never get to\r\nBrooklyn without going through New York. It\'s symbolic, I suppose."\r\n\r\nAgain there was a silence. Finally he said, "Is there another town\r\nbetween Greenbriar and Port Vigor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Shelby," I said. "About five miles from Greenbriar."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be as far as you\'ll get to-night," he said. "I\'ll see you\r\nsafe to Shelby, and then make tracks for Port Vigor. I hope there\'s\r\na decent inn at Shelby where you can stop overnight."\r\n\r\nI hoped so, too, but I wasn\'t going to let him see that with the\r\nwaning afternoon my enthusiasm was a little less robust. I was\r\nwondering what Andrew was thinking, and whether Mrs. McNally had\r\nleft things in good order. Like most Swedes she had to be watched or\r\nshe left her work only three quarters done. And I didn\'t depend any\r\ntoo much on her daughter Rosie to do the housework efficiently. I\r\nwondered what kind of meals Andrew would get. And probably he would\r\ngo right on wearing his summer underclothes, although I had already\r\nreminded him about changing. Then there were the chickens...\r\n\r\nWell, the Rubicon was crossed now, and there was nothing to be done.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, little Redbeard had divined my anxiety. "Now don\'t\r\nyou worry about the Sage," he said kindly. "A man that draws his\r\nroyalties isn\'t going to starve. By the bones of John Murray, his\r\npublishers can send him a cook if necessary! This is a holiday for\r\nyou, and don\'t you forget it."\r\n\r\nAnd with this cheering sentiment in my mind, we rolled sedately down\r\nthe hill toward Greenbriar.\r\n\r\nI am about as hardy as most folks, I think, but I confess I balked a\r\nlittle at the idea of facing the various people I know in Greenbriar\r\nas the owner of a bookvan and the companion of a literary huckster.\r\nAlso I recollected that if Andrew should try to trace us it would be\r\nas well for me to keep out of sight. So after telling Mr. Mifflin\r\nhow I felt about matters I dived into the Parnassus and lay down\r\nmost comfortably on the bunk. Bock the terrier joined me, and I\r\nrested there in great comfort of mind and body as we ambled down the\r\ngrade. The sun shone through the little skylight gilding a tin pan\r\nthat hung over the cook stove. Tacked here and there were portraits\r\nof authors, and I noticed a faded newspaper cutting pinned up. The\r\nheadlines ran: "Literary Pedlar Lectures on Poetry." I read it\r\nthrough. Apparently the Professor (so I had begun to call him, as\r\nthe aptness of the nickname stuck in my mind) had given a lecture\r\nin Camden, N.J., where he had asserted that Tennyson was a greater\r\npoet than Walt Whitman; and the boosters of the Camden poet had\r\nenlivened the evening with missiles. It seems that the chief Whitman\r\ndisciple in Camden is Mr. Traubel; and Mr. Mifflin had started the\r\nrumpus by asserting that Tennyson, too, had "Traubels of his own."\r\nWhat an absurd creature the Professor was, I thought, as I lay\r\ncomfortably lulled by the rolling wheels.\r\n\r\nGreenbriar is a straggling little town, built around a large common\r\nmeadow. Mifflin\'s general plan in towns, he had told me, was to\r\nhalt Parnassus in front of the principal store or hotel, and when\r\na little throng had gathered he would put up the flaps of the van,\r\ndistribute his cards, and deliver a harangue on the value of good\r\nbooks. I lay concealed inside, but I gathered from the sounds that\r\nthis was what was happening. We came to a stop; I heard a growing\r\nmurmur of voices and laughter outside, and then the click of the\r\nraised sides of the wagon. I heard Mifflin\'s shrill, slightly nasal\r\nvoice making facetious remarks as he passed out the cards. Evidently\r\nBock was quite accustomed to the routine, for though his tail wagged\r\ngently when the Professor began to talk, he lay quite peaceably\r\ndozing at my feet.\r\n\r\n"My friends," said Mr. Mifflin. "You remember Abe Lincoln\'s joke\r\nabout the dog? If you call a tail a leg, said Abe, how many legs\r\nhas a dog? Five, you answer. No, says Abe; because calling a tail a\r\nleg doesn\'t make it a leg. Well, there are lots of us in the same\r\ncase as that dog\'s tail. Calling us men doesn\'t _make_ us men. No\r\ncreature on earth has a right to think himself a human being if he\r\ndoesn\'t know at least one good book. The man that spends every\r\nevening chewing Piper Heidsieck at the store is unworthy to catch\r\nthe intimations of a benevolent Creator. The man that\'s got a few\r\ngood books on his shelf is making his wife happy, giving his\r\nchildren a square deal, and he\'s likely to be a better citizen\r\nhimself. How about that, parson?"\r\n\r\nI heard the deep voice of Reverend Kane, the Methodist minister:\r\n"You\'re dead right, Professor!" he shouted. "Tell us some more about\r\nbooks. I\'m right with you!" Evidently Mr. Kane had been attracted\r\nby the sight of Parnassus, and I could hear him muttering to himself\r\nas he pulled one or two books from the shelves. How surprised he\r\nwould have been if he had known I was inside the van! I took the\r\nprecaution of slipping the bolt of the door at the back, and drew\r\nthe curtains. Then I crept back into the bunk. I began to imagine\r\nwhat an absurd situation there would be if Andrew should arrive on\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\n"You are all used to hucksters and pedlars and fellows selling every\r\nkind of junk from brooms to bananas," said the Professor\'s voice.\r\n"But how often does any one come round here to sell you books?\r\nYou\'ve got your town library, I dare say; but there are some books\r\nthat folks ought to own. I\'ve got \'em all here from Bibles to cook\r\nbooks. They\'ll speak for themselves. Step up to the shelves,\r\nfriends, and pick and choose."\r\n\r\nI heard the parson asking the price of something he had found on the\r\nshelves, and I believe he bought it; but the hum of voices around\r\nthe flanks of Parnassus was very soothing, and in spite of my\r\ninterest in what was going on I\'m afraid I fell asleep. I must have\r\nbeen pretty tired; anyway I never felt the van start again. The\r\nProfessor says he looked in through the little window from the\r\ndriver\'s seat, and saw me sound asleep. And the next thing I knew I\r\nwoke up with a start to find myself rolling leisurely in the dark.\r\nBock was still lying over my feet, and there was a faint, musical\r\nclang from the bucket under the van which struck against something\r\nnow and then. The Professor was sitting in front, with a lighted\r\nlantern hanging from the peak of the van roof. He was humming some\r\noutlandish song to himself, with a queer, monotonous refrain:\r\n\r\n  Shipwrecked was I off Soft Perowse\r\n    And right along the shore,\r\n  And so I did resolve to roam\r\n    The country to explore.\r\n  Tommy rip fal lal and a balum tip\r\n    Tommy rip fal lal I dee;\r\n  And so I did resolve to roam\r\n    The country for to see!\r\n\r\nI jumped out of the bunk, cracked my shins against something, and\r\nuttered a rousing halloo. Parnassus stopped, and the Professor\r\npushed back the sliding window behind the driver\'s seat.\r\n\r\n"Heavens!" I said. "Father Time, what o\'clock is it?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty near supper time, I reckon. You must have fallen asleep\r\nwhile I was taking money from the Philistines. I made nearly three\r\ndollars for you. Let\'s pull up along the road and have a bite to\r\neat."\r\n\r\nHe guided Pegasus to one side of the road, and then showed me how\r\nto light the swinging lamp that hung under the skylight. "No use\r\nto light the stove on a lovely evening like this," he said. "I\'ll\r\ncollect some sticks and we can cook outside. You get out your basket\r\nof grub and I\'ll make a fire." He unhitched Pegasus, tied her to a\r\ntree, and gave her a nose bag of oats. Then he rooted around for\r\nsome twigs and had a fire going in a jiffy. In five minutes I had\r\nbacon and scrambled eggs sizzling in a frying pan, and he had\r\nbrought out a pail of water from the cooler under the bunk, and was\r\nmaking tea.\r\n\r\nI never enjoyed a picnic so much! It was a perfect autumn evening,\r\nwindless and frosty, with a dead black sky and a tiny rim of new\r\nmoon like a thumb-nail paring. We had our eggs and bacon, washed\r\ndown with tea and condensed milk, and followed by bread and jam.\r\nThe little fire burned blue and cozy, and we sat on each side of it\r\nwhile Bock scoured the pan and ate the crusts.\r\n\r\n"This your own bread, Miss McGill?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "I was calculating the other day that I\'ve baked more\r\nthan 400 loaves a year for the last fifteen years. That\'s more than\r\n6,000 loaves of bread. They can put that on my tombstone."\r\n\r\n"The art of baking bread is as transcendent a mystery as the art of\r\nmaking sonnets," said Redbeard. "And then your hot biscuits--they\r\nmight be counted as shorter lyrics, I suppose--triolets perhaps.\r\nThat makes quite an anthology, or a doxology, if you prefer it."\r\n\r\n"Yeast is yeast, and West is West," I said, and was quite surprised\r\nat my own cleverness. I hadn\'t made a remark like that to Andrew in\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n"I see you are acquainted with Kipling," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, every governess is."\r\n\r\n"Where and whom did you govern?"\r\n\r\n"I was in New York, with the family of a wealthy stockbroker. There\r\nwere three children. I used to take them walking in Central Park."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever go to Brooklyn?" he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Never," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he said. "That\'s just the trouble. New York is Babylon;\r\nBrooklyn is the true Holy City. New York is the city of envy, office\r\nwork, and hustle; Brooklyn is the region of homes and happiness. It\r\nis extraordinary: poor, harassed New Yorkers presume to look down on\r\nlow-lying, home-loving Brooklyn, when as a matter of fact it is the\r\nprecious jewel their souls are thirsting for and they never know it.\r\nBroadway: think how symbolic the name is. Broad is the way that\r\nleadeth to destruction! But in Brooklyn the ways are narrow, and\r\nthey lead to the Heavenly City of content. Central Park: there you\r\nare--the centre of things, hemmed in by walls of pride. Now how\r\nmuch better is Prospect Park, giving a fair view over the hills of\r\nhumility! There is no hope for New Yorkers, for they glory in their\r\nskyscraping sins; but in Brooklyn there is the wisdom of the lowly."\r\n\r\n"So you think that if I had been a governess in Brooklyn I should\r\nhave been so contented that I would never have come with Andrew\r\nand compiled my anthology of 6,000 loaves of bread and the lesser\r\nlyrics?"\r\n\r\nBut the volatile Professor had already soared to other points of\r\nview, and was not to be thwarted by argument.\r\n\r\n"Of course Brooklyn is a dingy place, really," he admitted. "But to\r\nme it symbolizes a state of mind, whereas New York is only a state\r\nof pocket. You see I was a boy in Brooklyn: it still trails clouds\r\nof glory for me. When I get back there and start work on my book\r\nI shall be as happy as Nebuchadnezzar when he left off grass and\r\nreturned to tea and crumpets. \'Literature Among the Farmers\' I\'m\r\ngoing to call it, but that\'s a poor title. I\'d like to read you some\r\nof my notes for it."\r\n\r\nI\'m afraid I poorly concealed a yawn. As a matter of fact I was\r\nsleepy, and it was growing chilly.\r\n\r\n"Tell me first," I said, "where in the world are we, and what time\r\nis it?"\r\n\r\nHe pulled out a turnip watch. "It\'s nine o\'clock," he said, "and\r\nwe\'re about two miles from Shelby, I should reckon. Perhaps we\'d\r\nbetter get along. They told me in Greenbriar that the Grand Central\r\nHotel in Shelby is a good place to stop at. That\'s why I wasn\'t\r\nanxious to get there. It sounds so darned like New York."\r\n\r\nHe bundled the cooking utensils back into Parnassus, hitched Peg up\r\nagain, and tied Bock to the stern of the van. Then he insisted on\r\ngiving me the two dollars and eighty cents he had collected in\r\nGreenbriar. I was really too sleepy to protest, and of course it was\r\nmine anyway. We creaked off along the dark and silent road between\r\nthe pine woods. I think he talked fluently about his pilgrim\'s\r\nprogress among the farmers of a dozen states, but (to be honest)\r\nI fell asleep in my corner of the seat. I woke up when we halted\r\nbefore the one hotel in Shelby--a plain, unimposing country inn,\r\ndespite its absurd name. I left him to put Parnassus and the animals\r\naway for the night, while I engaged a room. Just as I got my key\r\nfrom the clerk he came into the dingy lobby.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Mifflin," I said. "Shall I see you in the morning?"\r\n\r\n"I had intended to push on to Port Vigor to-night," he said, "but as\r\nit\'s fully eight miles (they tell me), I guess I\'ll bivouac here. I\r\nthink I\'ll go into the smoking-room and put them wise to some good\r\nbooks. We won\'t say good-bye till to-morrow."\r\n\r\nMy room was pleasant and clean (fairly so). I took my suit case up\r\nwith me and had a hot bath. As I fell asleep I heard a shrill voice\r\nascending from below, punctuated with masculine laughter. The\r\nPilgrim was making more converts!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a curious feeling of bewilderment when I woke the next\r\nmorning. The bare room with the red-and-blue rag carpet and green\r\nchina toilet set was utterly strange. In the hall outside I heard a\r\nclock strike. "Heavens!" I thought, "I\'ve overslept myself nearly\r\ntwo hours. What on earth will Andrew do for breakfast?" And then\r\nas I ran to close the window I saw the blue Parnassus with its\r\nstartling red letters standing in the yard. Instantly I remembered.\r\nAnd discreetly peeping from behind the window shade I saw that the\r\nProfessor, armed with a tin of paint, was blotting out his own name\r\non the side of the van, evidently intending to substitute mine. That\r\nwas something I had not thought of. However, I might as well make\r\nthe best of it.\r\n\r\nI dressed promptly, repacked my bag, and hurried downstairs for\r\nbreakfast. The long table was nearly empty, but one or two men\r\nsitting at the other end eyed me curiously. Through the window I\r\ncould see my name in large, red letters, growing on the side of the\r\nvan, as the Professor diligently wielded his brush. And when I had\r\nfinished my coffee and beans and bacon I noticed with some amusement\r\nthat the Professor had painted out the line about Shakespeare,\r\nCharles Lamb, and so on, and had substituted new lettering. The\r\nsign now read:\r\n\r\n                        H. MCGILL\'S\r\n                    TRAVELLING PARNASSUS\r\n                     GOOD BOOKS FOR SALE\r\n                   COOK BOOKS A SPECIALTY\r\n                       INQUIRE WITHIN\r\n\r\nEvidently he distrusted my familiarity with the classics.\r\n\r\nI paid my bill at the desk, and was careful also to pay the charge\r\nfor putting up the horse and van overnight. Then I strolled into the\r\nstable yard, where I found Mr. Mifflin regarding his handiwork with\r\nsatisfaction. He had freshened up all the red lettering, which shone\r\nbrilliantly in the morning sunlight.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," I said.\r\n\r\nHe returned it.\r\n\r\n"There!" he cried--"Parnassus is really yours! All the world lies\r\nbefore you! And I\'ve got some more money for you. I sold some books\r\nlast night. I persuaded the hotel keeper to buy several volumes of\r\nO. Henry for his smoking-room shelf, and I sold the \'Waldorf Cook\r\nBook\' to the cook. My! wasn\'t her coffee awful? I hope the cook book\r\nwill better it."\r\n\r\nHe handed me two limp bills and a handful of small change. I took it\r\ngravely and put it in my purse. This was really not bad--more than\r\nten dollars in less than twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n"Parnassus seems to be a gold mine," I said.\r\n\r\n"Which way do you think you\'ll go?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, as I know you want to get to Port Vigor I might just as well\r\ngive you a lift that way," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Good! I was hoping you\'d say that. They tell me the stage for Port\r\nVigor doesn\'t leave till noon, and I think it would kill me to hang\r\naround here all morning with no books to sell. Once I get on the\r\ntrain I\'ll be all right."\r\n\r\nBock was tied up in a corner of the yard, under the side door of the\r\nhotel. I went over to release him while the Professor was putting\r\nPeg into harness. As I stooped to unfasten the chain from his collar\r\nI heard some one talking through the telephone. The hotel lobby was\r\njust over my head, and the window was open.\r\n\r\n"What did you say?"\r\n\r\n"---- ---- ---- ----"\r\n\r\n"McGill? Yes, sir, registered here last night. She\'s here now."\r\n\r\nI didn\'t wait to hear more. Unfastening Bock, I hurried to tell\r\nMifflin. His eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n"The Sage is evidently on our spoor," he chuckled. "Well, let\'s be\r\noff. I don\'t see what he can do even if he overhauls us."\r\n\r\nThe clerk was calling me from the window: "Miss McGill, your\r\nbrother\'s on the wire and asks to speak to you."\r\n\r\n"Tell him I\'m busy," I retorted, and climbed onto the seat. It was\r\nnot a diplomatic reply, I\'m afraid, but I was too exhilarated by\r\nthe keen morning and the spirit of adventure to stop to think of a\r\nbetter answer. Mifflin clucked to Peg, and off we went.\r\n\r\nThe road from Shelby to Port Vigor runs across the broad hill slopes\r\nthat trend toward the Sound; and below, on our left, the river lay\r\nglittering in the valley. It was a perfect landscape: the woods\r\nwere all bronze and gold; the clouds were snowy white and seemed\r\nlike heavenly washing hung out to air; the sun was warm and swam\r\ngloriously in an arch of superb blue. My heart was uplifted indeed.\r\nFor the first time, I think, I knew how Andrew feels on those\r\nvagabond trips of his. Why had all this been hidden from me before?\r\nWhy had the transcendent mystery of baking bread blinded me so long\r\nto the mysteries of sun and sky and wind in the trees? We passed a\r\nwhite farmhouse close to the road. By the gate sat the farmer on a\r\nlog, whittling a stick and smoking his pipe. Through the kitchen\r\nwindow I could see a woman blacking the stove. I wanted to cry out:\r\n"Oh, silly woman! Leave your stove, your pots and pans and chores,\r\neven if only for one day! Come out and see the sun in the sky and\r\nthe river in the distance!" The farmer looked blankly at Parnassus\r\nas we passed, and then I remembered my mission as a distributor\r\nof literature. Mifflin was sitting with one foot on his bulging\r\nportmanteau, watching the tree tops rocking in the cool wind. He\r\nseemed to be far away in a morning muse. I threw down the reins and\r\naccosted the farmer.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, friend."\r\n\r\n"Morning to you, ma\'am," he said firmly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m selling books," I said. "I wonder if there isn\'t something you\r\nneed?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks, lady," he said, "but I bought a mort o\' books last year an\'\r\nI don\'t believe I\'ll ever read \'em this side Jordan. A whole set o\'\r\n\'Funereal Orations\' what an agent left on me at a dollar a month. I\r\ncould qualify as earnest mourner at any death-bed merrymakin\' now, I\r\nreckon."\r\n\r\n"You need some books to teach you how to live, not how to die," I\r\nsaid. "How about your wife--wouldn\'t she enjoy a good book? How\r\nabout some fairy tales for the children?"\r\n\r\n"Bless me," he said, "I ain\'t got a wife. I never was a daring man,\r\nand I guess I\'ll confine my melancholy pleasures to them funereal\r\norators for some time yet."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, hold on a minute!" I exclaimed. "I\'ve got just the thing\r\nfor you." I had been looking over the shelves with some care, and\r\nremembered seeing a copy of "Reveries of a Bachelor." I clambered\r\ndown, raised the flap of the van (it gave me quite a thrill to do it\r\nmyself for the first time), and hunted out the book. I looked inside\r\nthe cover and saw the letters _n m_ in Mifflin\'s neat hand.\r\n\r\n"Here you are," I said. "I\'ll sell you that for thirty cents."\r\n\r\n"Thank you kindly, ma\'am," he said courteously. "But honestly I\r\nwouldn\'t know what to do with it. I am working through a government\r\nreport on scabworm and fungus, and I sandwich in a little of them\r\nfunereal speeches with it, and honestly that\'s about all the readin\'\r\nI figure on. That an\' the Port Vigor Clarion."\r\n\r\nI saw that he really meant it, so I climbed back on the seat. I\r\nwould have liked to talk to the woman in the kitchen who was peering\r\nout of the window in amazement, but I decided it would be better to\r\njog on and not waste time. The farmer and I exchanged friendly\r\nsalutes, and Parnassus rumbled on.\r\n\r\nThe morning was so lovely that I did not feel talkative, and as the\r\nProfessor seemed pensive I said nothing. But as Peg plodded slowly\r\nup a gentle slope he suddenly pulled a book out of his pocket and\r\nbegan to read aloud. I was watching the river, and did not turn\r\nround, but listened carefully:\r\n\r\n\r\n"Rolling cloud, volleying wind, and wheeling sun--the blue\r\ntabernacle of sky, the circle of the seasons, the sparkling\r\nmultitude of the stars--all these are surely part of one rhythmic,\r\nmystic whole. Everywhere, as we go about our small business, we\r\nmust discern the fingerprints of the gigantic plan, the orderly and\r\ninexorable routine with neither beginning nor end, in which death\r\nis but a preface to another birth, and birth the certain forerunner\r\nof another death. We human beings are as powerless to conceive the\r\nmotive or the moral of it all as the dog is powerless to understand\r\nthe reasoning in his master\'s mind. He sees the master\'s acts,\r\nbenevolent or malevolent, and wags his tail. But the master\'s acts\r\nare always inscrutable to him. And so with us.\r\n\r\n"And therefore, brethren, let us take the road with a light heart.\r\nLet us praise the bronze of the leaves and the crash of the surf\r\nwhile we have eyes to see and ears to hear. An honest amazement at\r\nthe unspeakable beauties of the world is a comely posture for the\r\nscholar. Let us all be scholars under Mother Nature\'s eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n"How do you like that?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"A little heavy, but very good," I said. "There\'s nothing in it\r\nabout the transcendent mystery of baking bread!"\r\n\r\nHe looked rather blank.\r\n\r\n"Do you know who wrote it?" he asked.\r\n\r\nI made a valiant effort to summon some of my governessly\r\nrecollections of literature.\r\n\r\n"I give it up," I said feebly. "Is it Carlyle?"\r\n\r\n"That is by Andrew McGill," he said. "One of his cosmic passages\r\nwhich are now beginning to be reprinted in schoolbooks. The blighter\r\nwrites well."\r\n\r\nI began to be uneasy lest I should be put through a literary\r\ncatechism, so I said nothing, but roused Peg into an amble. To tell\r\nthe truth I was more curious to hear the Professor talk about his\r\nown book than about Andrew\'s. I had always carefully refrained from\r\nreading Andrew\'s stuff, as I thought it rather dull.\r\n\r\n"As for me," said the Professor, "I have no facility at the grand\r\nstyle. I have always suffered from the feeling that it\'s better to\r\nread a good book than to write a poor one; and I\'ve done so much\r\nmixed reading in my time that my mind is full of echoes and voices\r\nof better men. But this book I\'m worrying about now really deserves\r\nto be written, I think, for it has a message of its own."\r\n\r\nHe gazed almost wistfully across the sunny valley. In the distance\r\nI caught a glint of the Sound. The Professor\'s faded tweed cap was\r\nslanted over one ear, and his stubby little beard shone bright red\r\nin the sun. I kept a sympathetic silence. He seemed pleased to have\r\nsome one to talk to about his precious book.\r\n\r\n"The world is full of great writers about literature," he said,\r\n"but they\'re all selfish and aristocratic. Addison, Lamb, Hazlitt,\r\nEmerson, Lowell--take any one you choose--they all conceive the love\r\nof books as a rare and perfect mystery for the few--a thing of the\r\nsecluded study where they can sit alone at night with a candle,\r\nand a cigar, and a glass of port on the table and a spaniel on the\r\nhearthrug. What I say is, who has ever gone out into high roads and\r\nhedges to bring literature home to the plain man? To bring it home\r\nto his business and bosom, as somebody says? The farther into the\r\ncountry you go, the fewer and worse books you find. I\'ve spent\r\nseveral years joggling around with this citadel of crime, and by\r\nthe bones of Ben Ezra I don\'t think I ever found a really good book\r\n(except the Bible) at a farmhouse yet, unless I put it there myself.\r\nThe mandarins of culture--what do they do to teach the common folk\r\nto read? It\'s no good writing down lists of books for farmers and\r\ncompiling five-foot shelves; you\'ve got to go out and visit the\r\npeople yourself--take the books to them, talk to the teachers and\r\nbully the editors of country newspapers and farm magazines and tell\r\nthe children stories--and then little by little you begin to get\r\ngood books circulating in the veins of the nation. It\'s a great\r\nwork, mind you! It\'s like carrying the Holy Grail to some of these\r\nway-back farmhouses. And I wish there were a thousand Parnassuses\r\ninstead of this one. I\'d never give it up if it weren\'t for my book:\r\nbut I want to write about my ideas in the hope of stirring other\r\nfolk up, too. I don\'t suppose there\'s a publisher in the country\r\nwill take it!"\r\n\r\n"Try Mr. Decameron," I said. "He\'s always been very nice to Andrew."\r\n\r\n"Think what it would mean," he cried, waving an eloquent hand, "if\r\nsome rich man would start a fund to equip a hundred or so wagons\r\nlike this to go huckstering literature around through the rural\r\ndistricts. It would pay, too, once you got started. Yes, by the\r\nbones of Webster! I went to a meeting of booksellers once, at some\r\nhotel in New York, and told \'em about my scheme. They laughed at me.\r\nBut I\'ve had more fun toting books around in this Parnassus than I\r\ncould have had in fifty years sitting in a bookstore, or teaching\r\nschool, or preaching. Life\'s full of savour when you go creaking\r\nalong the road like this. Look at today, with the sun and the air\r\nand the silver clouds. Best of all, though, I love the rainy days. I\r\nused to pull up alongside the road, throw a rubber blanket over Peg,\r\nand Bock and I would curl up in the bunk and smoke and read. I used\r\nto read aloud to Bock: we went through \'Midshipman Easy\' together,\r\nand a good deal of Shakespeare. He\'s a very bookish dog. We\'ve seen\r\nsome queer experiences in this Parnassus."\r\n\r\nThe hill road from Shelby to Port Vigor is a lonely one, as most\r\nof the farmhouses lie down in the valley. If I had known better we\r\nmight have taken the longer and more populous way, but as a matter\r\nof fact I was enjoying the wide view and the solitary road lying\r\nwhite in the sunshine. We jogged along very pleasantly. Once more we\r\nstopped at a house where Mifflin pleaded for a chance to exercise\r\nhis art. I was much amused when he succeeded in selling a copy of\r\n"Grimm\'s Fairy Tales" to a shrewish spinster on the plea that she\r\nwould enjoy reading the stories to her nephews and nieces who were\r\ncoming to visit her.\r\n\r\n"My!" he chuckled, as he gave me the dingy quarter he had extracted.\r\n"There\'s nothing in that book as grim as she is!"\r\n\r\nA little farther on we halted by a roadside spring to give Peg a\r\ndrink, and I suggested lunch. I had laid in some bread and cheese in\r\nShelby, and with this and some jam we made excellent sandwiches. As\r\nwe were sitting by the fence the motor stage trundled past on its\r\nway to Port Vigor. A little distance down the road it halted, and\r\nthen went on again. I saw a familiar figure walking back toward us.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'m in for it," I said to the Professor. "Here\'s Andrew!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew is just as thin as I am fat, and his clothes hang on him in\r\nthe most comical way. He is very tall and shambling, wears a ragged\r\nbeard and a broad Stetson hat, and suffers amazingly from hay fever\r\nin the autumn. (In fact, his essay on "Hay Fever" is the best thing\r\nhe ever wrote, I think.) As he came striding up the road I noticed\r\nhow his trousers fluttered at the ankles as the wind plucked at\r\nthem. The breeze curled his beard back under his chin and his face\r\nwas quite dark with anger. I couldn\'t help being amused; he looked\r\nso funny.\r\n\r\n"The Sage looks like Bernard Shaw," whispered Mifflin.\r\n\r\nI always believe in drawing first blood.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Andrew," I called cheerfully. "Want to buy any\r\nbooks?" I halted Pegasus, and Andrew stood a little in front of\r\nthe wheel--partly out of breath and mostly out of temper.\r\n\r\n"What on earth is this nonsense, Helen?" he said angrily. "You\'ve\r\nled me the deuce of a chase since yesterday. And who is this--this\r\nperson you\'re driving with?"\r\n\r\n"Andrew," I said, "you forget your manners. Let me introduce Mr.\r\nMifflin. I have bought his caravan and am taking a holiday, selling\r\nbooks. Mr. Mifflin is on his way to Port Vigor where he takes the\r\ntrain to Brooklyn."\r\n\r\nAndrew stared at the Professor without speaking. I could tell by the\r\nblaze in his light-blue eyes that he was thoroughly angry, and I\r\nfeared things would be worse before they were better. Andrew is slow\r\nto wrath, but a very hard person to deal with when roused. And I had\r\nsome inkling by this time of the Professor\'s temperament. Moreover,\r\nI am afraid that some of my remarks had rather prejudiced him\r\nagainst Andrew, as a brother at any rate and apart from his\r\nexcellent prose.\r\n\r\nMifflin had the next word. He had taken off his funny little cap,\r\nand his bare skull shone like an egg. I noticed a little sort of\r\nfairy ring of tiny drops around his crown.\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Mifflin, "the proceedings look somewhat unusual,\r\nbut the facts are simple to narrate. Your sister has bought this van\r\nand its contents, and I have been instructing her in my theories of\r\nthe dissemination of good books. You as a literary man..."\r\n\r\nAndrew paid absolutely no attention to the Professor, and I saw a\r\nslow flush tinge Mifflin\'s sallow cheek.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Helen," said Andrew, "do you think I propose to have my\r\nsister careering around the State with a strolling vagabond? Upon my\r\nsoul you ought to have better sense--and at your age and weight! I\r\ngot home yesterday and found your ridiculous note. I went to Mrs.\r\nCollins, and she knew nothing. I went to Mason\'s, and found him\r\nwondering who had bilked his telephone. I suppose you did that. He\r\nhad seen this freight car of yours and put me on the track. But my\r\nGod! I never thought to see a woman of forty abducted by gypsies!"\r\n\r\nMifflin was about to speak but I waved him back.\r\n\r\n"Now see here Andrew," I said, "you talk too quickly. A woman of\r\nforty (you exaggerate, by the way) who has compiled an anthology\r\nof 6,000 loaves of bread and dedicated it to you deserves some\r\ncourtesy. When _you_ want to run off on some vagabond tour or other\r\nyou don\'t hesitate to do it. You expect me to stay home and do\r\nthe Lady Eglantine in the poultry yard. By the ghost of Susan B.\r\nAnthony, I won\'t do it! This is the first real holiday I\'ve had in\r\nfifteen years, and I\'m going to suit myself."\r\n\r\nAndrew\'s mouth opened, but I shook my fist so convincingly that he\r\nhalted.\r\n\r\n"I bought this Parnassus from Mr. Mifflin fair and square for four\r\nhundred dollars. That\'s the price of about thirteen hundred dozen\r\neggs," I said. (I had worked this out in my head while Mifflin was\r\ntalking about his book.)\r\n\r\n"The money\'s mine, and I\'m going to use it my own way. Now, Andrew\r\nMcGill, if you want to buy any books, you can parley with me.\r\nOtherwise, I\'m on my way. You can expect me back when you see me."\r\nI handed him one of Mifflin\'s little cards, which were in a pocket\r\nat the side of the van, and gathered up the reins. I was really\r\nangry, for Andrew had been both unreasonable and insulting.\r\n\r\nAndrew looked at the card, and tore it in halves. He looked at the\r\nside of Parnassus where the fresh red lettering was still damp.\r\n\r\n"Well, upon my word," he said, "you must be crazy." He burst into a\r\nviolent fit of sneezing--a last touch of hay fever, I suspect, as\r\nthere was still goldenrod in the meadows. He coughed and sneezed\r\nfuriously, which made him madder than ever. At last he turned to\r\nMifflin who was sitting bald-headed with a flushed face and very\r\nbright eyes. Andrew took him all in, the shabby Norfolk jacket, the\r\nbulging memorandum book in his pocket, the stuffed portmanteau under\r\nhis foot, even the copy of "Happiness and Hayseed" which had dropped\r\nto the floor and lay back up.\r\n\r\n"Look here, you," said Andrew, "I don\'t know by what infernal arts\r\nyou cajoled my sister away to go vagabonding in a huckster\'s wagon,\r\nbut I know this, that if you\'ve cheated her out of her money I\'ll\r\nhave the law on you."\r\n\r\nI tried to insert a word of protest, but matters had gone too far.\r\nThe Professor was as mad as Andrew now.\r\n\r\n"By the bones of Piers Plowman," he said, "I had expected to meet a\r\nman of letters and the author of this book"--he held up "Happiness\r\nand Hayseed"--"but I see I was mistaken. I tell you, sir, a man who\r\nwould insult his sister before a stranger, as you have done, is an\r\noaf and a cad." He threw the book over the hedge, and before I could\r\nsay a word he had vaulted over the off wheel and ran round behind\r\nthe van.\r\n\r\n"Look here sir," he said, with his little red beard bristling, "your\r\nsister is over age and acting of her own free will. By the bones of\r\nthe Baptist, I don\'t blame her for wanting a vacation if this is the\r\nway you treat her. She is nothing to me, sir, and I am nothing to\r\nher, but I propose to be a teacher to you. Put up your hands and\r\nI\'ll give you a lesson!"\r\n\r\nThis was too much for me. I believe I screamed aloud, and started\r\nto clamber from the van. But before I could do anything the two\r\nfanatics had begun to pummel each other. I saw Andrew swing savagely\r\nat Mifflin, and Mifflin hit him square on the chin. Andrew\'s hat\r\nfell on the road. Peg stood placidly, and Bock made as if to grab\r\nAndrew\'s leg, but I hopped out and seized him.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a weird sight. I suppose I should have wrung my\r\nhands and had hysterics, but as a matter of fact I was almost\r\namused, it was so silly. Thank goodness the road was deserted.\r\n\r\nAndrew was a foot taller than the Professor, but awkward, loosely\r\nknit, and unmuscular, while the little Redbeard was wiry as a cat.\r\nAlso Andrew was so furious that he was quite beside himself, and\r\nMifflin was in the cold anger that always wins. Andrew landed a\r\ncouple of flailing blows on the other man\'s chest and shoulders,\r\nbut in thirty seconds he got another punch on the chin followed by\r\none on the nose that tumbled him over backward.\r\n\r\nAndrew sat in the road fishing for a handkerchief, and Mifflin stood\r\nglaring at him, but looking very ill at ease. Neither of them said a\r\nword. Bock broke away from me and capered and danced about Mifflin\'s\r\nfeet as if it were all a game. It was an extraordinary scene.\r\n\r\nAndrew got up, mopping his bleeding nose.\r\n\r\n"Upon my soul," he said, "I almost respect you for that punch. But\r\nby Jove I\'ll have the law on you for kidnapping my sister. You\'re a\r\nfine kind of a pirate."\r\n\r\nMifflin said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool, Andrew" I said. "Can\'t you see that I want a\r\nlittle adventure of my own? Go home and bake six thousand loaves of\r\nbread, and by the time they\'re done I\'ll be back again. I think two\r\nmen of your age ought to be ashamed of yourselves. I\'m going off to\r\nsell books." And with that I climbed up to the seat and clucked to\r\nPegasus. Andrew and Mifflin and Bock remained standing in the road.\r\n\r\nI was mad all the way through. I was mad at both men for behaving\r\nlike schoolboys. I was mad at Andrew for being so unreasonable,\r\nyet in a way I admired him for it; I was mad at Mifflin for giving\r\nAndrew a bloody nose, and yet I appreciated the spirit in which it\r\nwas done. I was mad at myself for causing all the trouble, and I was\r\nmad at Parnassus. If there had been a convenient cliff handy I would\r\nhave pushed the old thing over it. But now I was in for it, and just\r\nhad to go on. Slowly I rolled up a long grade, and then saw Port\r\nVigor lying ahead and the broad blue stretches of the Sound.\r\n\r\nParnassus rumbled on with its pleasant creak, and the mellow sun and\r\nsweep of the air soon soothed me. I began to taste salt in the wind,\r\nand above the meadows two or three seagulls were circling. Like\r\nall women, my angry mood melted into a reaction of exaggerated\r\ntenderness and I began to praise both Andrew and Mifflin in my\r\nheart. How fine to have a brother so solicitous of his sister\'s\r\nwelfare and reputation! And yet, how splendid the little, scrawny\r\nProfessor had been! How quick to resent an insult and how bold to\r\navenge it! His absurd little tweed cap was lying on the seat, and I\r\npicked it up almost sentimentally. The lining was frayed and torn.\r\nFrom my suit case in the van I got out a small sewing kit, and\r\nhanging the reins on a hook I began to stitch up the rents as\r\nPeg jogged along. I thought with amusement of the quaint life\r\nMr. Mifflin had led in his "caravan of culture." I imagined him\r\naddressing the audience of Whitman disciples in Camden, and wondered\r\nhow the fuss ended. I imagined him in his beloved Brooklyn,\r\nstrolling in Prospect Park and preaching to chance comers his gospel\r\nof good books. How different was his militant love of literature\r\nfrom Andrew\'s quiet satisfaction. And yet how much they really had\r\nin common! It tickled me to think of Mifflin reading aloud from\r\n"Happiness and Hayseed," and praising it so highly, just before\r\nfighting with the author and giving him a bloody nose. I remembered\r\nthat I should have spoken to Andrew about feeding the hens, and\r\nreminded him of his winter undergarments. What helpless creatures\r\nmen are, after all!\r\n\r\nI finished mending the cap in high good humour.\r\n\r\nI had hardly laid it down when I heard a quick step in the road\r\nbehind me, and looking back, there was Mifflin, striding along with\r\nhis bald pate covered with little beads of moisture. Bock trotted\r\nsedately at his heels. I halted Peg.\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, "what\'s happened to Andrew?"\r\n\r\nThe Professor still looked a bit shamefaced. "The Sage is a\r\ntenacious person," he said. "We argued for a bit without much\r\nsatisfaction. As a matter of fact we nearly came to blows again,\r\nonly he got another waft of goldenrod, which started him sneezing,\r\nand then his nose began bleeding once more. He is convinced that\r\nI\'m a ruffian, and said so in excellent prose. Honestly, I admire\r\nhim a great deal. I believe he intends to have the law on me. I\r\ngave him my Brooklyn address in case he wants to follow the matter\r\nup. I think I rather pleased him by asking him to autograph\r\n\'Happiness and Hayseed\' for me. I found it lying in the ditch."\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, "you two are certainly a great pair of lunatics. You\r\nboth ought to go on the stage. You\'d be as good as Weber and Fields.\r\nDid he give you the autograph?"\r\n\r\nHe pulled the book out of his pocket. Scrawled in it in pencil were\r\nthe words "I have shed blood for Mr. Mifflin. Andrew McGill."\r\n\r\n"I shall read the book again with renewed interest," said Mifflin.\r\n"May I get in?"\r\n\r\n"By all means," I said. "There\'s Port Vigor in front of us."\r\n\r\nHe put on his cap, noticed that it seemed to feel different, pulled\r\nit off again, and then looked at me in a quaint embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"You are very good, Miss McGill," he said.\r\n\r\n"Where did Andrew go?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"He set off for Shelby on foot," Mifflin answered. "He has a grand\r\nstride for walking. He suddenly remembered that he had left some\r\npotatoes boiling on the fire yesterday afternoon, and said he must\r\nget back to attend to them. He said he hoped you would send him a\r\npostal card now and then. Do you know, he reminds me of Thoreau more\r\nthan ever."\r\n\r\n"He reminds me of a burnt cooking pot," I said. "I suppose all my\r\nkitchenware will be in a horrible state when I get home."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nPort Vigor is a fascinating old town. It is built on a point jutting\r\nout into the Sound. Dimly in the distance one can see the end of\r\nLong Island, which Mifflin viewed with sparkling eyes. It seemed to\r\nbring him closer to Brooklyn. Several schooners were beating along\r\nthe estuary in the fresh wind, and there was a delicious tang of\r\nbrine in the air. We drove direct to the station where the Professor\r\nalighted. We took his portmanteau, and shut Bock inside the van to\r\nprevent the dog from following him. Then there was an awkward pause\r\nas he stood by the wheel with his cap off.\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss McGill," he said, "there\'s an express train at five\r\no\'clock, so with luck I shall be in Brooklyn to-night. My brother\'s\r\naddress is 600 Abingdon Avenue, and I hope when you\'re sending a\r\ncard to the Sage you\'ll let me have one, too. I shall be very\r\nhomesick for Parnassus, but I\'d rather leave her with you than with\r\nany one I know."\r\n\r\nHe bowed very low, and before I could say a word he blew his nose\r\nviolently and hurried away. I saw him carrying his valise into the\r\nstation, and then he disappeared. I suppose that living alone with\r\nAndrew for all these years has unused me to the eccentricities of\r\nother people, but surely this little Redbeard was one of the\r\nstrangest beings one would be likely to meet.\r\n\r\nBock yowled dismally inside, and I did not feel in any mood to sell\r\nbooks in Port Vigor. I drove back into the town and stopped at a tea\r\nshop for a pot of tea and some toast. When I came out I found that\r\nquite a little crowd had collected, partly owing to the strange\r\nappearance of Parnassus and partly because of Bock\'s plaintive cries\r\nfrom within. Most of the onlookers seemed to suspect the outfit of\r\nbeing part of a travelling menagerie, so almost against my will I\r\nput up the flaps, tied Bock to the tail of the wagon, and began to\r\nanswer the humourous questions of the crowd. Two or three bought\r\nbooks without any urging, and it was some time before I could get\r\naway. Finally I shut up the van and pulled off, as I was afraid of\r\nseeing some one I knew. As I turned into the Woodbridge Road I heard\r\nthe whistle of the five o\'clock train to New York.\r\n\r\nThe twenty miles of road between Sabine Farm and Port Vigor was all\r\nfamiliar to me, but now to my relief I struck into a region that I\r\nhad never visited. On my occasional trips to Boston I had always\r\ntaken the train at Port Vigor, so the country roads were unknown.\r\nBut I had set out on the Woodbridge way because Mifflin had spoken\r\nof a farmer, Mr. Pratt, who lived about four miles out of Port\r\nVigor, on the Woodbridge Road. Apparently Mr. Pratt had several\r\ntimes bought books from the Professor and the latter had promised to\r\nvisit him again. So I felt in duty bound to oblige a good customer.\r\n\r\nAfter the varied adventures of the last two days it was almost a\r\nrelief to be alone to think things over. Here was I, Helen McGill,\r\nin a queer case indeed. Instead of being home at Sabine Farm getting\r\nsupper, I was trundling along a strange road, the sole owner of a\r\nParnassus (probably the only one in existence), a horse, and a dog,\r\nand a cartload of books on my hands. Since the morning of the day\r\nbefore my whole life had twisted out of its accustomed orbit. I had\r\nspent four hundred dollars of my savings; I had sold about thirteen\r\ndollars\' worth of books; I had precipitated a fight and met a\r\nphilosopher. Not only that, I was dimly beginning to evolve a new\r\nphilosophy of my own. And all this in order to prevent Andrew from\r\nbuying a lot more books! At any rate, I had been successful in\r\nthat. When he had seen Parnassus at last, he had hardly looked at\r\nher--except in tones of scorn. I caught myself wondering whether the\r\nProfessor would allude to the incident in his book, and hoping that\r\nhe would send me a copy. But after all, why should he mention it? To\r\nhim it was only one of a thousand adventures. As he had said angrily\r\nto Andrew, he was nothing to me, nor I to him. How could he realize\r\nthat this was the first adventure I had had in the fifteen years I\r\nhad been--what was it he called it?--compiling my anthology. Well,\r\nthe funny little gingersnap!\r\n\r\nI kept Bock tied to the back of the van, as I was afraid he might\r\ntake a notion to go in search of his master. As we jogged on, and\r\nthe falling sun cast a level light across the way, I got a bit\r\nlonely. This solitary vagabonding business was a bit sudden after\r\nfifteen years of home life. The road lay close to the water and I\r\nwatched the Sound grow a deeper blue and then a dull purple. I could\r\nhear the surf pounding, and on the end of Long Island a far-away\r\nlighthouse showed a ruby spark. I thought of the little gingersnap\r\nroaring toward New York on the express, and wondered whether he was\r\ntravelling in a Pullman or a day coach. A Pullman chair would feel\r\neasy after that hard Parnassus seat.\r\n\r\nBy and by we neared a farmhouse which I took to be Mr. Pratt\'s. It\r\nstood close to the road, with a big, red barn behind and a gilt\r\nweathervane representing a galloping horse. Curiously enough Peg\r\nseemed to recognize the place, for she turned in at the gate and\r\nneighed vigorously. It must have been a favourite stopping place for\r\nthe Professor.\r\n\r\nThrough a lighted window I could see people sitting around a table.\r\nEvidently the Pratts were at supper. I drew up in the yard. Some one\r\nlooked out of a window, and I heard a girl\'s voice:\r\n\r\n"Why, Pa, here\'s Parnassus!"\r\n\r\nGingersnap must have been a welcome visitor at that farm, for in an\r\ninstant the whole family turned out with a great scraping of chairs\r\nand clatter of dishes. A tall, sunburnt man, in a clean shirt with\r\nno collar, led the group, and then came a stout woman about my own\r\nbuild, and a hired man and three children.\r\n\r\n"Good evening!" I said. "Is this Mr. Pratt?"\r\n\r\n"Sure thing!" said he. "Where\'s the Perfessor?"\r\n\r\n"On his way to Brooklyn," said I. "And I\'ve got Parnassus. He told\r\nme to be sure to call on you. So here we are."\r\n\r\n"Well, I want to know!" ejaculated Mrs. Pratt. "Think of Parnassus\r\nturned suffrage! Ben, you put up the critters, and I\'ll take Mrs.\r\nMifflin in to supper."\r\n\r\n"Hold on there," I said. "My name\'s McGill--Miss McGill. See,\r\nit\'s painted on the wagon. I bought the outfit from Mr. Mifflin.\r\nA business proposition entirely."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Mr. Pratt. "We\'re glad to see any friend of the\r\nPerfessor. Sorry he\'s not here, too. Come right in and have a bite\r\nwith us."\r\n\r\nThey were certainly good-hearted folk, Mr. and Mrs. Ben Pratt. He\r\nput Peg and Bock away in the barn and gave them their supper, while\r\nMrs. Pratt took me up to her spare bedroom and brought me a jug of\r\nhot water. Then they all trooped back into the dining-room and the\r\nmeal began again. I am a connoisseur of farm cooking, I guess, and\r\nI\'ve got to hand it to Beulah Pratt that she was an A-1 housewife.\r\nHer hot biscuit was perfect; the coffee was real Mocha, simmered,\r\nnot boiled; the cold sausage and potato salad was as good as any\r\nAndrew ever got. And she had a smoking-hot omelet sent in for me,\r\nand opened a pot of her own strawberry preserve. The children (two\r\nboys and a girl) sat open-mouthed, nudging one another, and Mr.\r\nPratt got out his pipe while I finished up on stewed pears and cream\r\nand chocolate cake. It was a regular meal. I wondered what Andrew\r\nwas eating and whether he had found the nest behind the wood pile\r\nwhere the red hen always drops her eggs.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Mr. Pratt, "tell us about the Perfessor. We was\r\nexpectin\' him here some time this fall. He generally gets here\r\naround cider time."\r\n\r\n"I guess there isn\'t so much to tell," I said. "He stopped up at our\r\nplace the other day, and said he wanted to sell his outfit. So I\r\nbought him out. He was pining to get back to Brooklyn and write a\r\nbook."\r\n\r\n"That book o\' his!" said Mrs. Pratt. "He was always talkin\' on it,\r\nbut I don\'t believe he ever started it yet."\r\n\r\n"Whereabout do you come from, Miss McGill?" said Pratt. I could see\r\nhe was mighty puzzled at a woman driving a vanload of books around\r\nthe country, alone.\r\n\r\n"Over toward Redfield," I said.\r\n\r\n"You any kin to that writer that lives up that way?"\r\n\r\n"You mean Andrew McGill?" I said. "He\'s my brother."\r\n\r\n"Do tell!" exclaimed Mrs. Pratt. "Why the Perfessor thought a\r\nterrible lot of him. He read us all to sleep with one of his books\r\none night. Said he was the best literature in this State, I do\r\nbelieve."\r\n\r\nI smiled to myself as I thought of the set-to on the road from\r\nShelby.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Pratt, "if the Perfessor\'s got any better friends\r\nthan us in these parts, I\'m glad to meet \'em. He come here first\r\ntime \'bout four years ago. I was up working in the hayfield that\r\nafternoon, and I heard a shout down by the mill pond. I looked over\r\nthat way and saw a couple o\' kids waving their arms and screamin\'.\r\nI ran down the hill and there was the Perfessor just a pullin\' my\r\nboy Dick out o\' the water. Dick\'s this one over here."\r\n\r\nDick, a small boy of thirteen or so, grew red under his freckles.\r\n\r\n"The kids had been foolin\' around on a raft there, an\' first thing\r\nyou know Dick fell in, right into deep water, over by the dam.\r\nCouldn\'t swim a stroke, neither. And the Perfessor, who jest\r\nhappened to be comin\' along in that \'bus of his, heard the boys\r\nyell. Didn\'t he hop out o\' the wagon as spry as a chimpanzee, skin\r\nover the fence, an\' jump into the pond, swim out there an\' tow the\r\nboy in! Yes, ma\'am, he saved that boy\'s life then an\' no mistake.\r\nThat man can read me to sleep with poetry any night he has a mind\r\nto. He\'s a plumb fine little firecracker, the Perfessor."\r\n\r\nFarmer Pratt pulled hard on his pipe. Evidently his friendship for\r\nthe wandering bookseller was one of the realities of his life.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," he went on, "that Perfessor has been a good friend to\r\nme, sure enough. We brought him an\' the boy back to the house. The\r\nboy had gone down three times an\' the Perfessor had to dive to find\r\nhim. They were both purty well all in, an\' I tell you I was scared.\r\nBut we got Dick around somehow--rolled him on a sugar bar\'l, an\'\r\npoured whiskey in him, an\' worked his arms, an\' put him in hot\r\nblankets. By and by he come to. An\' then I found that the Perfessor,\r\ngettin\' over the barb-wire fence so quick (when he lit for the pond)\r\nhad torn a hole in his leg you could put four fingers in. There was\r\nhis trouser all stiff with blood, an\' he not sayin\' a thing.\r\nPluckiest little runt in three States, by Judas! Well, we put _him_\r\nto bed, too, and then the Missus keeled over, an\' we put _her_ to\r\nbed. Three of them, by time the Doc got here. Great old summer\r\nafternoon that was! But bless your heart, we couldn\'t keep the\r\nPerfessor abed long. Next day he was out lookin\' fer his poetry\r\nbooks, an\' first thing you know he had us all rounded up an\' was\r\npreachin\' good literature at us like any evangelist. I guess we all\r\nfell asleep over his poetry, so then he started on readin\' that\r\n\'Treasure Island\' story to us, wasn\'t it, Mother? By hickory, we\r\nnone of us fell asleep over that. He started the kids readin\' so\r\nthey been at it ever since, and Dick\'s top boy at school now.\r\nTeacher says she never saw such a boy for readin\'. That\'s what\r\nPerfessor done for us! Well, tell us \'bout yerself, Miss McGill. Is\r\nthere any good books we ought to read? I used to pine for some o\'\r\nthat feller Shakespeare my father used to talk about so much, but\r\nPerfessor always \'lowed it was over my head!"\r\n\r\nIt gave me quite a thrill to hear all this about Mifflin. I\r\ncould readily imagine the masterful little man captivating the\r\nsimple-hearted Pratts with his eloquence and earnestness. And the\r\nstory of the mill pond had its meaning, too. Little Redbeard was no\r\nmere wandering crank--he was a real man, cool and steady of brain,\r\nwith the earmarks of a hero. I felt a sudden gush of warmth as I\r\nrecalled his comical ways.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pratt lit a fire in her Franklin stove and I racked my head\r\nwondering how I could tread worthily in the Professor\'s footsteps.\r\nFinally I fetched the "Jungle Book" from Parnassus and read them\r\nthe story of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. There was a long pause when I had\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n"Say, Pa," said Dick shyly, "that mongoose was rather like\r\nProfessor, wasn\'t he!"\r\n\r\nPlainly the Professor was the traditional hero of this family,\r\nand I began to feel rather like an impostor!\r\n\r\nI suppose it was foolish of me, but I had already made up my mind\r\nto push on to Woodbridge that night. It could not be more than four\r\nmiles, and the time was not much after eight. I felt a little twinge\r\nof quite unworthy annoyance because I was still treading in the\r\nglamour of the Professor\'s influence. The Pratts would talk of\r\nnothing else, and I wanted to get somewhere where I would be\r\nestimated at my own value, not merely as his disciple. "Darn the\r\nRedbeard," I said to myself, "I think he has bewitched these\r\npeople!" And in spite of their protests and invitations to stay the\r\nnight, I insisted on having Peg hitched up. I gave them the copy\r\nof the "Jungle Book" as a small return for their hospitality,\r\nand finally sold Mr. Pratt a little copy of "Lamb\'s Tales from\r\nShakespeare" which I thought he could read without brain fever. Then\r\nI lit my lantern and after a chorus of good-byes Parnassus rolled\r\naway. "Well," I said to myself as I turned into the high road once\r\nmore, "drat the gingersnap, he seems to hypnotize everybody... he\r\nmust be nearly in Brooklyn by this time!"\r\n\r\nIt was very quiet along the road, also very dark, for the sky had\r\nclouded over and I could see neither moon nor stars. As it was a\r\ndirect road I should have had no difficulty, and I suppose I must\r\nhave fallen into a doze during which Peg took a wrong turning. At\r\nany rate, I realized about half-past nine that Parnassus was on a\r\nmuch rougher road than the highway had any right to be, and there\r\nwere no telephone poles to be seen. I knew that they stretched\r\nall along the main road, so plainly I had made a mistake. I was\r\nreluctant for a moment to admit that I could be wrong, and just\r\nthen Peg stumbled heavily and stood still. She paid no heed to my\r\nexhortations, and when I got out and carried my lantern to see\r\nwhether anything was in the way, I found that she had cast a shoe\r\nand her foot was bleeding. The shoe must have dropped off some way\r\nback and she had picked up a nail or something in the quick. I saw\r\nno alternative but to stay where I was for the night.\r\n\r\nThis was not very pleasant, but the adventures of the day had put\r\nme into a stoical frame of mind, and I saw no good in repining. I\r\nunhitched Peg, sponged her foot, and tied her to a tree. I would\r\nhave made more careful explorations to determine just where I was,\r\nbut a sharp patter of rain began to fall. So I climbed into my\r\nParnassus, took Bock in with me, and lit the swinging lamp. By this\r\ntime it was nearly ten o\'clock. There was nothing to do but turn in,\r\nso I took off my boots and lay down in the bunk. Bock lay quite\r\ncomfortably on the floor of the van. I meant to read for a while,\r\nand so did not turn out the light, but I fell asleep almost\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nI woke up at half-past eleven and turned out the lamp, which had\r\nmade the van very warm. I opened the little windows front and back,\r\nand would have opened the door, but I feared Bock might slip away.\r\nIt was still raining a little. To my annoyance I felt very wakeful.\r\nI lay for some time listening to the patter of raindrops on the roof\r\nand skylight--a very snug sound when one is warm and safe. Every now\r\nand then I could hear Peg stamping in the underbrush. I was almost\r\ndozing off again when Bock gave a low growl.\r\n\r\nNo woman of my bulk has a right to be nervous, I guess, but\r\ninstantly my security vanished! The patter of the rain seemed\r\nmenacing, and I imagined a hundred horrors. I was totally alone and\r\nunarmed, and Bock was not a large dog. He growled again, and I felt\r\nworse than before. I imagined that I heard stealthy sounds in the\r\nbushes, and once Peg snorted as though frightened. I put my hand\r\ndown to pat Bock, and found that his neck was all bristly, like a\r\nfighting cock. He uttered a queer half growl, half whine, which\r\ngave me a chill. Some one must be prowling about the van, but in the\r\nfalling rain I could hear nothing.\r\n\r\nI felt I must do something. I was afraid to call out lest I betray\r\nthe fact that there was only a woman in the van. My expedient was\r\nabsurd enough, but at any rate it satisfied my desire to act. I\r\nseized one of my boots and banged vigorously on the floor, at the\r\nsame time growling in as deep and masculine a voice as I could\r\nmuster: "What the hell\'s the matter? What the hell\'s the matter?"\r\nThis sounds silly enough, I dare say, but it afforded me some\r\nrelief. And as Bock shortly ceased growling, it apparently served\r\nsome purpose.\r\n\r\nI lay awake for a long time, tingling all over with nervousness.\r\nThen I began to grow calmer, and was getting drowsy almost in spite\r\nof myself when I was aroused by the unmistakable sound of Bock\'s\r\ntail thumping on the floor--a sure sign of pleasure. This puzzled\r\nme quite as much as his growls. I did not dare strike a light, but\r\ncould hear him sniffing at the door of the van and whining with\r\neagerness. This seemed very uncanny, and again I crept stealthily\r\nout of the bunk and pounded on the floor lustily, this time with the\r\nfrying pan, which made an unearthly din. Peg neighed and snorted,\r\nand Bock began to bark. Even in my anxiety I almost laughed. "It\r\nsounds like an insane asylum," I thought, and reflected that\r\nprobably the disturbance was only caused by some small animal.\r\nPerhaps a rabbit or a skunk which Bock had winded and wanted to\r\nchase. I patted him, and crawled into my bunk once more.\r\n\r\nBut my real excitement was still to come. About half an hour later\r\nI heard unmistakable footsteps alongside the van. Bock growled\r\nfuriously, and I lay in a panic. Something jarred one of the wheels.\r\nThen broke out a most extraordinary racket. I heard quick steps, Peg\r\nwhinneyed, and something fell heavily against the back of the wagon.\r\nThere was a violent scuffle on the ground, the sound of blows, and\r\nrapid breathing. With my heart jumping I peered out of one of the\r\nback windows. There was barely any light, but dimly I could see a\r\ntumbling mass which squirmed and writhed on the ground. Something\r\nstruck one of the rear wheels so that Parnassus trembled. I heard\r\nhoarse swearing, and then the whole body, whatever it was, rolled\r\noff into the underbrush. There was a terrific crashing and snapping\r\nof twigs. Bock whined, growled, and pawed madly at the door. And\r\nthen complete silence.\r\n\r\nMy nerves were quite shattered by this time. I don\'t think I had\r\nbeen so frightened since childhood days when I awakened from a\r\nnightmare. Little trickles of fear crept up and down my spine and my\r\nscalp prickled. I pulled Bock on the bunk, and lay with one hand on\r\nhis collar. He, too, seemed agitated and sniffed gingerly now and\r\nthen. Finally, however, he gave a sigh and fell asleep. I judged it\r\nmight have been two o\'clock, but I did not like to strike a light.\r\nAnd at last I fell into a doze.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke the sun was shining brilliantly and the air was full of\r\nthe chirping of birds. I felt stiff and uneasy from sleeping in my\r\nclothes, and my foot was numb from Bock\'s weight.\r\n\r\nI got up and looked out of the window. Parnassus was standing in a\r\nnarrow lane by a grove of birch trees. The ground was muddy, and\r\nsmeared with footprints behind the van. I opened the door and looked\r\naround. The first thing I saw, on the ground by one of the wheels,\r\nwas a battered tweed cap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n\r\nMy feelings were as mixed as a crushed nut sundae. So the Professor\r\nhadn\'t gone to Brooklyn after all! What did he mean by prowling\r\nafter me like a sleuth? Was it just homesickness for Parnassus? Not\r\nlikely! And then the horrible noises I had heard in the night; had\r\nsome tramp been hanging about the van in the hope of robbing me? Had\r\nthe tramp attacked Mifflin? Or had Mifflin attacked the tramp? Who\r\nhad got the better of it?\r\n\r\nI picked up the muddy cap and threw it into the van. Anyway, I had\r\nproblems of my own to tackle, and those of the Professor could wait.\r\n\r\nPeg whinneyed when she saw me. I examined her foot. Seeing it by\r\ndaylight the trouble was not hard to diagnose. A long, jagged piece\r\nof slate was wedged in the frog of the foot. I easily wrenched it\r\nout, heated some water, and gave the hoof another sponging. It\r\nwould be all right when shod once more. But where was the shoe?\r\n\r\nI gave the horse some oats, cooked an egg and a cup of coffee for\r\nmyself at the little kerosene stove, and broke up a dog biscuit\r\nfor Bock. I marvelled once more at the completeness of Parnassus\'\r\nfurnishings. Bock helped me to scour the pan. He sniffed eagerly\r\nat the cap when I showed it to him, and wagged his tail.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that the only thing I could do was to leave\r\nParnassus and the animals where they were and retrace my steps as\r\nfar as the Pratt farm. Undoubtedly Mr. Pratt would be glad to sell\r\nme a horse-shoe and send his hired man to do the job for me. I could\r\nnot drive Peg as she was, with a sore foot and without a shoe. I\r\njudged Parnassus would be quite safe: the lane seemed to be a lonely\r\none leading to a deserted quarry. I tied Bock to the steps to act as\r\na guard, took my purse and the Professor\'s cap with me, locked the\r\ndoor of the van, and set off along the back track. Bock whined and\r\ntugged violently when he saw me disappearing, but I could see no\r\nother course.\r\n\r\nThe lane rejoined the main road about half a mile back. I must have\r\nbeen asleep or I could never have made the mistake of turning off.\r\nI don\'t see why Peg should have made the turn, unless her foot hurt\r\nand she judged the side track would be a good place to rest. She\r\nmust have been well used to stopping overnight in the open.\r\n\r\nI strode along pondering over my adventures, and resolved to buy a\r\npistol when I got to Woodbridge. I remember thinking that I could\r\nwrite quite a book now myself. Already I began to feel quite a\r\nhardened pioneer. It doesn\'t take an adaptable person long to\r\naccustom one\'s self to a new way of life, and the humdrum routine of\r\nthe farm certainly looked prosy compared to voyaging with Parnassus.\r\nWhen I had got beyond Woodbridge, and had crossed the river, I would\r\nbegin to sell books in earnest. Also I would buy a notebook and jot\r\ndown my experiences. I had heard of bookselling as a profession\r\nfor women, but I thought that my taste of it was probably unique.\r\nI might even write a book that would rival Andrew\'s--yes, and\r\nMifflin\'s. And that brought my thoughts to Barbarossa again.\r\n\r\nOf all extraordinary people, I thought, he certainly takes the\r\ncake--and then, rounding a bend, I saw him sitting on a rail fence,\r\nwith his head shining in the sunlight. My heart gave a sort of jump.\r\nI do believe I was getting fond of the Professor. He was examining\r\nsomething which he held in his hand.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get sunstroke," I said. "Here\'s your cap." And I pulled it\r\nout of my pocket and tossed it to him.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," he said, as cool as you please. "And here\'s your\r\nhorse-shoe. Fair exchange!"\r\n\r\nI burst out laughing, and he looked disconcerted, as I hoped he\r\nwould.\r\n\r\n"I thought you\'d be in Brooklyn by now," I said, "at 600 Abingdon\r\nAvenue, laying out Chapter One. What do you mean by following me\r\nthis way? You nearly frightened me to death last night. I felt like\r\none of Fenimore Cooper\'s heroines, shut up in the blockhouse while\r\nthe redskins prowled about."\r\n\r\nHe flushed and looked very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"I owe you an apology," he said. "I certainly never intended that\r\nyou should see me. I bought a ticket for New York and checked my\r\nbag through. And then while I was waiting for the train it came\r\nover me that your brother was right, and that it was a darned risky\r\nthing for you to go jaunting about alone in Parnassus. I was afraid\r\nsomething might happen. I followed along the road behind you,\r\nkeeping well out of sight."\r\n\r\n"Where were you while I was at Pratt\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Sitting not far down the road eating bread and cheese," he said.\r\n"Also I wrote a poem, a thing I very rarely do."\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope your ears burned," I said, "for those Pratts have\r\ncertainly raised you to the peerage."\r\n\r\nHe got more uncomfortable than ever.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, "I dare say it was all an error, but anyway I _did_\r\nfollow you. When you turned off into that lane, I kept pretty close\r\nbehind you. As it happens, I know this bit of country, and there are\r\nvery often some hoboes hanging around the old quarry up that lane.\r\nThey have a cave there where they go into winter quarters. I was\r\nafraid some of them might bother you. You could hardly have chosen a\r\nworse place to camp out. By the bones of George Eliot, Pratt ought\r\nto have warned you. I can\'t conceive why you didn\'t stop at his\r\nhouse overnight anyway."\r\n\r\n"If you must know, I got weary of hearing them sing your praises."\r\n\r\nI could see that he was beginning to get nettled.\r\n\r\n"I regret having alarmed you," he said. "I see that Peg has dropped\r\na shoe. If you\'ll let me fix it for you, after that I won\'t bother\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nWe turned back again along the road, and I noticed the right side of\r\nhis face for the first time. Under the ear was a large livid bruise.\r\n\r\n"That hobo, or whoever he was," I said, "must have been a better\r\nfighter than Andrew. I see he landed on your cheek. Are you always\r\nfighting?"\r\n\r\nHis annoyance disappeared. Apparently the Professor enjoyed a fight\r\nalmost as much as he did a good book.\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t regard the last twenty-four hours as typical of me,"\r\nhe said with a chuckle. "I am so unused to being a squire of dames\r\nthat perhaps I take the responsibilities too seriously."\r\n\r\n"Did you sleep at all last night?" I asked. I think I began to\r\nrealize for the first time that the gallant little creature had been\r\nout all night in a drizzling rain, simply to guard me from possible\r\nannoyance; and I had been unforgivably churlish about it.\r\n\r\n"I found a very fine haystack in a field overlooking the quarry.\r\nI crawled into the middle of it. A haystack is sometimes more\r\ncomfortable than a boarding-house."\r\n\r\n"Well," I said penitently, "I can never forgive myself for the\r\ntrouble I\'ve caused you. It was awfully good of you to do what\r\nyou did. Please put your cap on and don\'t catch cold."\r\n\r\nWe walked for several minutes in silence. I watched him out of the\r\ncorner of my eye. I was afraid he might have caught his death of\r\ncold from being out all night in the wet, to say nothing of the\r\nscuffle he had had with the tramp; but he really looked as chipper\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\n"How do you like the wild life of a bookseller?" he said.\r\n"You must read George Borrow. He would have enjoyed Parnassus."\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking, when I met you, that I could write a book\r\nabout my adventures."\r\n\r\n"Good!" he said. "We might collaborate."\r\n\r\n"There\'s another thing we might collaborate on," I said, "and\r\nthat\'s breakfast. I\'m sure you haven\'t had any."\r\n\r\n"No," he said, "I don\'t think I have. I never lie when I know\r\nI shan\'t be believed."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t had any, either," I said. I thought that to tell an\r\nuntruth would be the least thing I could do to reward the little\r\nman for his unselfishness.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, "I really thought that by this time--"\r\n\r\nHe broke off. "Was that Bock barking?" he asked sharply.\r\n\r\nWe had been walking slowly, and had not yet reached the spot where\r\nthe lane branched from the main road. We were still about three\r\nquarters of a mile from the place where I had camped overnight. We\r\nboth listened carefully, but I could hear nothing but the singing of\r\nthe telephone wires along the road.\r\n\r\n"No matter," he said. "I thought I heard a dog." But I noticed that\r\nhe quickened his pace.\r\n\r\n"I was saying," he continued, "that I had really thought to have\r\nlost Parnassus for good by this morning, but I\'m tickled to death to\r\nhave a chance to see her again. I hope she\'ll be as good a friend to\r\nyou as she has been to me. I suppose you\'ll sell her when you return\r\nto the Sage?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know I\'m sure," I said. "I must confess I\'m still a little\r\nat sea. My desire for an adventure seems to have let me in deeper\r\nthan I expected. I begin to see that there\'s more in this\r\nbookselling game than I thought. Honestly, it\'s getting into my\r\nblood."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s fine," he said heartily. "I couldn\'t have left\r\nParnassus in better hands. You must let me know what you do with\r\nher, and then perhaps, when I\'ve finished my book, I can buy her\r\nback."\r\n\r\nWe struck off into the lane. The ground was slippery under the trees\r\nand we went single file, Mifflin in front. I looked at my watch--it\r\nwas nine o\'clock, just an hour since I had left the van. As we\r\nneared the spot Mifflin kept looking ahead through the birch trees\r\nin a queer way.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" I said. "We\'re almost there, aren\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"We _are_ there," he said. "Here\'s the place."\r\n\r\nParnassus was gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stood in complete dismay--I did, at any rate--for about as long\r\nas it takes to peel a potato. There could be no doubt in which\r\ndirection the van had moved, for the track of the wheels was plain.\r\nIt had gone farther up the lane toward the quarry. In the earth,\r\nwhich was still soggy, were a number of footprints.\r\n\r\n"By the bones of Polycarp!" exclaimed the Professor, "those hoboes\r\nhave stolen the van. I guess they think it\'ll make a fine Pullman\r\nsleeper for them. If I\'d realized there was more than one of them\r\nI\'d have hung around closer. They need a lesson."\r\n\r\nGood Lord! I thought, here\'s Don Quixote about to wade into another\r\nfight.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t we better go back and get Mr. Pratt?" I asked.\r\n\r\nThis was obviously the wrong thing to say. It put the fiery little\r\nman all the more on his mettle. His beard bristled. "Nothing of the\r\nsort!" he said. "Those fellows are cowards and vagabonds anyway.\r\nThey can\'t be far off; you haven\'t been away more than an hour, have\r\nyou? If they\'ve done anything to Bock, by the bones of Chaucer, I\'ll\r\nharry them. I _thought_ I heard him bark."\r\n\r\nHe hurried up the lane, and I followed in a panicky frame of mind.\r\nThe track wound along a hillside, between a high bank and a forest\r\nof birch trees. I think the distance can\'t have been more than a\r\nquarter of a mile. Anyway, in a very few minutes the road made a\r\nsharp twist to the right and we found ourselves looking down into\r\nthe quarry, over a sheer rocky drop of a hundred feet at least.\r\nBelow, drawn over to one side of the wall of rock, stood Parnassus.\r\nPeg was between the shafts. Bock was nowhere to be seen. Sitting by\r\nthe van were three disreputable looking men. The smoke of a cooking\r\nfire rose into the air; evidently they were making free with my\r\nlittle larder.\r\n\r\n"Keep back," said the Professor softly. "Don\'t let them see us." He\r\nflattened himself in the grass and crawled to the edge of the cliff.\r\nI did the same, and we lay there, invisible from below, but quite\r\nable to see everything in the quarry. The three tramps were\r\nevidently enjoying an excellent breakfast.\r\n\r\n"This place is a regular hang-out for these fellows," Mifflin\r\nwhispered. "I\'ve seen hoboes about here every year. They go into\r\nwinter quarters about the end of October, usually. There\'s an old\r\nblasted-out section of this quarry that makes a sheltered dormitory\r\nfor them, and as the place isn\'t worked any more they\'re not\r\ndisturbed here so long as they don\'t make mischief in the\r\nneighbourhood. We\'ll give them...."\r\n\r\n"Hands up!" said a rough voice behind us. I looked round. There was\r\na fat, red-faced villainous-looking creature covering us with a\r\nshiny revolver. It was an awkward situation. Both the Professor and\r\nI were lying full length on the ground. We were quite helpless.\r\n\r\n"Get up!" said the tramp in a husky, nasty voice. "I guess youse\r\nthought we wasn\'t covering our trail? Well, we\'ll have to tie you\r\nup, I reckon, while we get away with this Crystal Pallis of yourn."\r\n\r\nI scrambled to my feet, but to my surprise the Professor continued\r\nto lie at full length.\r\n\r\n"Get up, deacon!" said the tramp again. "Get up on them graceful\r\nlimbs, _if_ you please."\r\n\r\nI guess he thought himself safe from attack by a woman. At any rate,\r\nhe bent over as if to grab Mifflin by the neck. I saw my chance\r\nand jumped on him from behind. I am heavy, as I have said, and he\r\nsprawled on the ground. My doubts as to the pistol being loaded were\r\npromptly dissolved, for it went off like a cannon. Nobody was in\r\nfront of it, however, and Mifflin was on his feet like a flash. He\r\nhad the ruffian by the throat and kicked the weapon out of his hand.\r\nI ran to seize it.\r\n\r\n"You son of Satan!" said the valiant Redbeard. "Thought you could\r\nbully us, did you? Miss McGill, you were as quick as Joan of Arc.\r\nHand me the pistol, please."\r\n\r\nI gave it to him, and he shoved it under the hobo\'s nose.\r\n\r\n"Now," he said, "take off that rag around your neck."\r\n\r\nThe rag was an old red handkerchief, inconceivably soiled. The tramp\r\nremoved it, grumbling and whining. Mifflin gave me the pistol to\r\nhold while he tied our prisoner\'s wrists together. In the meantime\r\nwe heard a shout from the quarry. The three vagabonds were gazing up\r\nin great excitement.\r\n\r\n"You tell those fashion plates down there," said Mifflin, as he\r\nknotted the tramp\'s hands together, "that if they make any fight\r\nI\'ll shoot them like crows." His voice was cold and savage and he\r\nseemed quite master of the situation, but I must confess I wondered\r\nhow we could handle four of them.\r\n\r\nThe greasy ruffian shouted down to his pals in the quarry, but I did\r\nnot hear what he said, as just then the Professor asked me to keep\r\nour captive covered while he got a stick. I stood with the pistol\r\npointed at his head while Mifflin ran back into the birchwood to cut\r\na cudgel.\r\n\r\nThe tramp\'s face became the colour of the under side of a fried egg\r\nas he looked into the muzzle of his own gun.\r\n\r\n"Say, lady," he pleaded, "that gun goes off awful easy, point her\r\nsomewhere else or you\'ll croak me by mistake."\r\n\r\nI thought a good scare wouldn\'t do him any harm and kept the barrel\r\nsteadily on him.\r\n\r\nThe rascals down below seemed debating what to do. I don\'t know\r\nwhether they were armed or not; but probably they imagined that\r\nthere were more than two of us. At all events, by the time Mifflin\r\ncame back with a stout birch staff they were hustling out of the\r\nquarry on the lower side. The Professor swore, and looked as if he\r\nwould gladly give chase, but he refrained.\r\n\r\n"Here, you," he said in crisp tones to the tramp, "march on ahead of\r\nus, down to the quarry."\r\n\r\nThe fat ruffian shambled awkwardly down the trail. We had to make\r\nquite a detour to get into the quarry, and by the time we reached\r\nthere the other three tramps had got clean away. I was not sorry, to\r\ntell the truth. I thought the Professor had had enough scrapping for\r\none twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nPeg whinneyed loudly as she saw us coming, but Bock was not in sight.\r\n\r\n"What have you done with the dog, you swine?" said Mifflin. "If\r\nyou\'ve hurt him I\'ll make you pay with your own hide."\r\n\r\nOur prisoner was completely cowed. "No, boss, we ain\'t hurt the\r\ndog," he fawned. "We tied him up so he couldn\'t bark, that\'s all.\r\nHe\'s in the \'bus." And sure enough, by this time we could hear\r\nsmothered yelping and whining from Parnassus.\r\n\r\nI hurried to open the door, and there was Bock, his jaws tied\r\ntogether with a rope-end. He bounded out and made super-canine\r\nefforts to express his joy at seeing the Professor again. He paid\r\nvery little attention to me.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mifflin, after freeing the dog\'s muzzle, and with\r\ndifficulty restraining him from burying his teeth in the tramp\'s\r\nshin, "what shall we do with this heroic specimen of manhood? Shall\r\nwe cart him over to the jail in Port Vigor, or shall we let him go?"\r\n\r\nThe tramp burst into a whining appeal that was almost funny, it was\r\nso abject. The Professor cut it short.\r\n\r\n"I ought to pack you into quod," he said. "Are you the Phoebus\r\nApollo I scuffled with down the lane last night? Was it you skulking\r\naround this wagon then?"\r\n\r\n"No, boss, that was Splitlip Sam, honest to Gawd it was. He come\r\nback, boss; said he\'d been fightin\' with a cat-o\'-mountain! Say,\r\nboss, you sure hit him hard. One of his lamps is a pudding! Boss,\r\nI\'ll swear I ain\'t had nothin\' to do with it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like your society," said the Professor, "and I\'m going to\r\nturn you loose. I\'m going to count ten, and if you\'re not out of\r\nthis quarry by then, I\'ll shoot. And if I see you again I\'ll skin\r\nyou alive. Now get out!"\r\n\r\nHe cut the knotted handkerchief in two. The hobo needed no urging.\r\nHe spun on his heel and fled like a rabbit. The Professor watched\r\nhim go, and as the fat, ungainly figure burst through a hedge and\r\ndisappeared he fired the revolver into the air to frighten him still\r\nmore. Then he tossed the weapon into the pool near by.\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss McGill," he said with a chuckle, "if you like to\r\nundertake breakfast, I\'ll fix up Peg." And he drew the horse-shoe\r\nfrom his pocket once more.\r\n\r\nA brief inspection of Parnassus satisfied me that the thieves had\r\nnot had time to do any real damage. They had got out most of the\r\neatables and spread them on a flat rock in preparation for a feast;\r\nand they had tracked a good deal of mud into the van; but otherwise\r\nI could see nothing amiss. So while Mifflin busied himself with\r\nPeg\'s foot it was easy for me to get a meal under way. I found a\r\ngush of clean water trickling down the face of the rock. There were\r\nstill some eggs and bread and cheese in the little cupboard, and an\r\nunopened tin of condensed milk. I gave Peg her nose bag of oats, and\r\nfed Bock, who was frisking about in high spirits. By that time the\r\nshoeing was done, and the Professor and I sat down to an improvised\r\nmeal. I was beginning to feel as if this gipsy existence were the\r\nnormal course of my life.\r\n\r\n"Well, Professor," I said, as I handed him a cup of coffee and a\r\nplate of scrambled eggs and cheese, "for a man who slept in a wet\r\nhaystack, you acquit yourself with excellent valour."\r\n\r\n"Old Parnassus is quite a stormy petrel," he said. "I used to think\r\nthe chief difficulty in writing a book would be to invent things to\r\nhappen, but if I were to sit down and write the adventures I\'d had\r\nwith her it would be a regular Odyssey."\r\n\r\n"How about Peg\'s foot?" I asked. "Can she travel on it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be all right if you go easy. I\'ve scraped out the injured\r\npart and put the shoe back. I keep a little kit of tools under the\r\nvan for emergencies of all sorts."\r\n\r\nIt was chilly, and we didn\'t dawdle over our meal. I only made a\r\nfeint of eating, as I had had a little breakfast before, and also\r\nas the events of the last few hours had left me rather restless. I\r\nwanted to get Parnassus out on the highway again, to jog along in\r\nthe sun and think things over. The quarry was a desolate, forbidding\r\nplace anyway. But before we left we explored the cave where the\r\ntramps had been preparing to make themselves comfortable for the\r\nwinter. It was not really a cave, but only a shaft into the granite\r\ncliff. A screen of evergreen boughs protected the opening against\r\nthe weather, and inside were piles of sacking that had evidently\r\nbeen used as beds, and many old grocery boxes for tables and chairs.\r\nIt amused me to notice a cracked fragment of mirror balanced on a\r\ncorner of rock. Even these ragamuffins apparently were not totally\r\nunconscious of personal appearance. I seized the opportunity, while\r\nthe Professor was giving Peg\'s foot a final look, to rearrange my\r\nhair, which was emphatically a sight. I hardly think Andrew would\r\nhave recognized me that morning.\r\n\r\nWe led Peg up the steep incline, back into the lane where I had\r\nstrayed, and at length we reached the main road again. Here I began\r\nto lay down the law to Redbeard.\r\n\r\n"Now look here, Professor," I said, "I\'m not going to have you tramp\r\nall the way back to Port Vigor. After the night you\'ve had you need\r\na rest. You just climb into that Parnassus and lie down for a good\r\nsnooze. I\'ll drive you into Woodbridge and you can take your train\r\nthere. Now you get right into that bunk. I\'ll sit out here and drive."\r\n\r\nHe demurred, but without much emphasis. I think the little fool was\r\njust about fagged out, and no wonder. I was a trifle groggy myself.\r\nIn the end he was quite docile. He climbed into the van, took off\r\nhis boots, and lay down under a blanket. Bock followed him, and I\r\nthink they both fell asleep on the instant. I got on the front seat\r\nand took the reins. I didn\'t let Peg go more quickly than a walk as\r\nI wanted to spare her sore foot.\r\n\r\nMy, what a morning that was after the rain! The road ran pretty\r\nclose to the shore, and every now and then I could catch a glimpse\r\nof the water. The air was keen--not just the ordinary, unnoticed air\r\nthat we breathe in and out and don\'t think about, but a sharp and\r\ntingling essence, as strong in the nostrils as camphor or ammonia.\r\nThe sun seemed focussed upon Parnassus, and we moved along the white\r\nroad in a flush of golden light. The flat fronds of the cedars\r\nswayed gently in the salty air, and for the first time in ten\r\nyears, I should think, I began amusing myself by selecting words to\r\ndescribe the goodness of the morning. I even imagined myself writing\r\na description of it, as if I were Andrew or Thoreau. The crazy\r\nlittle Professor had inoculated me with his literary bug, I guess.\r\n\r\nAnd then I did a dishonourable thing. Just by chance I put my hand\r\ninto the little pocket beside the seat where Mifflin kept a few odds\r\nand ends. I meant to have another look at that card of his with the\r\npoem on it. And there I found a funny, battered little notebook,\r\nevidently forgotten. On the cover was written, in ink, "Thoughts\r\non the Present Discontents." That title seemed vaguely familiar. I\r\nseemed to recall something of the kind from my school days--more\r\nthan twenty years ago, goodness me! Of course if I had been\r\nhonourable I wouldn\'t have looked into it. But in a kind of\r\nquibbling self-justification I recalled that I had bought Parnassus\r\nand all it contained, "lock, stock, barrel and bung" as Andrew used\r\nto say. And so....\r\n\r\nThe notebook was full of little jottings, written in pencil in\r\nthe Professor\'s small, precise hand. The words were rubbed\r\nand soiled, but plainly legible. I read this:\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\'t suppose Bock or Peg get lonely, but by the bones of Ben\r\nGunn, I do. Seems silly when Herrick and Hans Andersen and Tennyson\r\nand Thoreau and a whole wagonload of other good fellows are riding\r\nat my back. I can hear them all talking as we trundle along. But\r\nbooks aren\'t a _substantial_ world after all, and every now and then\r\nwe get hungry for some closer, more human relationships. I\'ve been\r\ntotally alone now for eight years--except for Runt, and he might be\r\ndead and never say so. This wandering about is fine in its way, but\r\nit must come to an end some day. A man needs to put down a root\r\nsomewhere to be really happy.\r\n\r\nWhat absurd victims of contrary desires we are! If a man is settled\r\nin one place he yearns to wander; when he wanders he yearns to have\r\na home. And yet how bestial is content--all the great things in life\r\nare done by discontented people.\r\n\r\nThere are three ingredients in the good life: learning, earning,\r\nand yearning. A man should be learning as he goes; and he should\r\nbe earning bread for himself and others; and he should be yearning,\r\ntoo: yearning to know the unknowable.\r\n\r\nWhat a fine old poem is "The Pulley" by George Herbert! Those\r\nElizabethan fellows knew how to write! They were marred perhaps by\r\ntheir idea that poems must be "witty." (Remember how Bacon said\r\nthat reading poets makes one witty? There he gave a clue to the\r\nliterature of his time.)  Their fantastic puns and conceits are\r\nrather out of our fashion nowadays. But Lord! the root of the\r\nmatter was in them! How gallantly, how reverently, they tackle the\r\nproblems of life!\r\n\r\nWhen God at first made man (says George Herbert) He had a "glass of\r\nblessings standing by." So He pours on man all the blessings in His\r\nreservoir: strength, beauty, wisdom, honour, pleasure--and then He\r\nrefrains from giving him the last of them, which is rest, i.e.,\r\ncontentment. God sees that if man is contented he will never win\r\nhis way to Him. Let man be restless, so that\r\n\r\n  "If goodness lead him not, yet weariness\r\n     May toss him to My breast."\r\n\r\nSome day I shall write a novel on that theme, and call it "The\r\nPulley." In this tragic, restless world there must be some\r\nplace where at last we can lay our heads and be at rest. Some\r\npeople call it death. Some call it God.\r\n\r\nMy ideal of a man is not the Omar who wants to shatter into bits\r\nthis sorry scheme of things, and then remould it nearer to the\r\nheart\'s desire. Old Omar was a coward, with his silk pajamas and\r\nhis glass of wine. The real man is George Herbert\'s "seasoned\r\ntimber"--the fellow who does handily and well whatever comes to him.\r\nEven if it\'s only shovelling coal into a furnace he can balance the\r\nshovel neatly, swing the coal square on the fire and not spill it on\r\nthe floor. If it\'s only splitting kindling or running a trolley car\r\nhe can make a good, artistic job of it. If it\'s only writing a book\r\nor peeling potatoes he can put into it the best he has. Even if he\'s\r\nonly a bald-headed old fool over forty selling books on a country\r\nroad, he can make an ideal of it. Good old Parnassus! It\'s a great\r\ngame.... I think I\'ll have to give her up soon, though: I must get\r\nthat book of mine written. But Parnassus has been a true glass of\r\nblessings to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was much more in the notebook; indeed it was half full of\r\njotted paragraphs, memoranda, and scraps of writing--poems I believe\r\nsome of them were--but I had seen enough. It seemed as if I had\r\nstumbled unawares on the pathetic, brave, and lonely heart of the\r\nlittle man. I\'m a commonplace creature, I\'m afraid, insensible to\r\nmany of the deeper things in life, but every now and then, like all\r\nof us, I come face to face with something that thrills me. I saw how\r\nthis little, red-bearded pedlar was like a cake of yeast in the big,\r\nheavy dough of humanity: how he travelled about trying to fulfil in\r\nhis own way his ideals of beauty. I felt almost motherly toward him:\r\nI wanted to tell him that I understood him. And in a way I felt\r\nashamed of having run away from my own homely tasks, my kitchen and\r\nmy hen yard and dear old, hot-tempered, absent-minded Andrew. I\r\nfell into a sober mood. As soon as I was alone, I thought, I would\r\nsell Parnassus and hurry back to the farm. That was my job, that\r\nwas my glass of blessings. What was I doing--a fat, middle-aged\r\nwoman--trapesing along the roads with a cartload of books I didn\'t\r\nunderstand?\r\n\r\nI slipped the little notebook back into its hiding-place. I would\r\nhave died rather than let the Professor know I had seen it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were coming into Woodbridge; and I was just wondering whether to\r\nwake the Professor when the little window behind me slid back and he\r\nstuck his head out.\r\n\r\n"Hello!" he said. "I think I must have been asleep!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I should hope so," I said. "You needed it."\r\n\r\nIndeed he looked much better, and I was relieved to see it. I had\r\nbeen really afraid he would be ill after sleeping out all night, but\r\nI guess he was tougher than I thought. He joined me on the seat, and\r\nwe drove into the town. While he went to the station to ask about\r\nthe trains I had a fine time selling books. I was away from the\r\nlocality where I was known, and had no shyness in attempting to\r\nimitate Mifflin\'s methods. I even went him one better by going into\r\na hardware store where I bought a large dinner bell. This I rang\r\nlustily until a crowd gathered, then I put up the flaps and\r\ndisplayed my books. As a matter of fact, I sold only one, but I\r\nenjoyed myself none the less.\r\n\r\nBy and by Mifflin reappeared. I think he had been to a barber: at\r\nany rate he looked very spry: he had bought a clean collar and a\r\nflowing tie of a bright electric blue which really suited him rather\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, "the Sage is going to get back at me for that\r\npunch on the nose! I\'ve been to the bank to cash your check. They\r\ntelephoned over to Redfield, and apparently your brother has stopped\r\npayment on it. It\'s rather awkward: they seem to think I\'m a crook."\r\n\r\nI was furious. What right had Andrew to do that?\r\n\r\n"The brute!" I said. "What on earth shall I do?"\r\n\r\n"I suggest that you telephone to the Redfield Bank," he said, "and\r\ncountermand your brother\'s instructions--that is, unless you think\r\nyou\'ve made a mistake? I don\'t want to take advantage of you."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" I said. "I\'m not going to let Andrew spoil my holiday.\r\nThat\'s always his way: if he gets an idea into his head he\'s like a\r\nmule. I\'ll telephone to Redfield, and then we\'ll go to see the bank\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nWe put Parnassus up at the hotel, and I went to the telephone. I was\r\nthoroughly angry at Andrew, and tried to get him on the wire first.\r\nBut Sabine Farm didn\'t answer. Then I telephoned to the bank in\r\nRedfield, and got Mr. Shirley. He\'s the cashier, and I know him\r\nwell. I guess he recognized my voice, for he made no objection when\r\nI told him what I wanted.\r\n\r\n"Now you telephone to the bank in Woodbridge," I said, "and tell\r\nthem to let Mr. Mifflin have the money. I\'ll go there with him to\r\nidentify him. Will that be all right?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly," he said. The deceitful little snail! If I had only\r\nknown what he was concocting!\r\n\r\nMifflin said there was a train at three o\'clock which he could take.\r\nWe stopped at a little lunch room for a bite to eat, then he went\r\nagain to the bank, and I with him. We asked the cashier whether they\r\nhad had a message from Redfield.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said. "We\'ve just heard." And he looked at me rather\r\nqueerly.\r\n\r\n"Are you Miss McGill?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I am," I said.\r\n\r\n"Will you just step this way a moment?" he asked politely.\r\n\r\nHe led me into a little sitting-room and asked me to sit down. I\r\nsupposed that he was going to get some paper for me to sign, so I\r\nwaited quite patiently for several minutes. I had left the Professor\r\nat the cashier\'s window, where they would give him his money.\r\n\r\nI waited some time, and finally I got tired of looking at the Life\r\nInsurance calendars. Then I happened to glance out of the window.\r\nSurely that was the Professor, just disappearing round the corner\r\nwith another man?\r\n\r\nI returned to the cashier\'s desk.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" I said. "Your mahogany furniture is charming,\r\nbut I\'m tired of it. Do I have to sit here any longer? And where\'s\r\nMr. Mifflin? Did he get his money?"\r\n\r\nThe cashier was a horrid little creature with side whiskers.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you had to wait, Madam," he said. "The transaction is\r\njust concluded. We gave Mr. Mifflin what was due him. There is no\r\nneed for you to stay longer."\r\n\r\nI thought this was very extraordinary. Surely the Professor would\r\nnot leave without saying good-bye? However, I noticed that the clock\r\nsaid three minutes to three, so I thought that perhaps he had had to\r\nrun to catch his train. He was such a strange little man, anyway....\r\n\r\nWell, I went back to the hotel, quite a little upset by this sudden\r\nparting. At least I was glad the little man had got his money all\r\nright. Probably he would write from Brooklyn, but of course I\r\nwouldn\'t get the letter till I returned to the farm as that was the\r\nonly address he would have. Perhaps that wouldn\'t be so long after\r\nall: but I did not feel like going back now, when Andrew had been\r\nso horrid.\r\n\r\nI drove Parnassus on the ferry, and we crossed the river. I felt\r\nlost and disagreeable. Even the fresh movement through the air\r\ngave me no pleasure. Bock whined dismally inside the van.\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t take me long to discover that Parnassing all alone had\r\nlost some of its charms. I missed the Professor: missed his abrupt,\r\ndirect way of saying things, and his whimsical wit. And I was\r\nannoyed by his skipping off without a word of good-bye. It didn\'t\r\nseem natural. I partially appeased my irritation by stopping at a\r\nfarmhouse on the other side of the river and selling a cook book.\r\nThen I started along the road for Bath--about five miles farther on.\r\nPeg\'s foot didn\'t seem to bother her so I thought it would be safe\r\nto travel that far before stopping for the night. Counting up the\r\ndays (with some difficulty: it seemed as though I had been away from\r\nhome a month), I remembered that this was Saturday night. I thought\r\nI would stay in Bath over Sunday and get a good rest. We jogged\r\nsedately along the road, and I got out a copy of "Vanity Fair." I\r\nwas so absorbed in Becky Sharp that I wouldn\'t even interrupt myself\r\nto sell books at the houses we passed. I think reading a good book\r\nmakes one modest. When you see the marvellous insight into human\r\nnature which a truly great book shows, it is bound to make you feel\r\nsmall--like looking at the Dipper on a clear night, or seeing the\r\nwinter sunrise when you go out to collect the morning eggs. And\r\nanything that makes you feel small is mighty good for you.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by a great book?" said the Professor--I mean,\r\nI imagined him saying it. It seemed to me as if I could see him\r\nsitting there, with his corncob pipe in his hand and that quizzical\r\nlittle face of his looking sharply at me. Somehow, talking with\r\nthe Professor had made me think. He was as good as one of those\r\nScranton correspondence courses, I do believe, and no money to pay\r\nfor postage.\r\n\r\nWell, I said to the Professor--to myself I mean--let\'s see: what\r\n_is_ a good book? I don\'t mean books like Henry James\'s (he\'s\r\nAndrew\'s great idol. It always seemed to me that he had a kind\r\nof rush of words to the head and never stopped to sort them out\r\nproperly). A good book ought to have something simple about it. And,\r\nlike Eve, it ought to come from somewhere near the third rib: there\r\nought to be a heart beating in it. A story that\'s all forehead\r\ndoesn\'t amount to much. Anyway, it\'ll never get over at a Dorcas\r\nmeeting. That was the trouble with Henry James. Andrew talked so\r\nmuch about him that I took one of his books to read aloud at our\r\nsewing circle over at Redfield. Well, after one try we had to fall\r\nback on "Pollyanna."\r\n\r\nI haven\'t been doing chores and running a farmhouse for fifteen\r\nyears without getting some ideas about life--and even about books.\r\nI wouldn\'t set my lit\'ry views up against yours, Professor (I was\r\nstill talking to Mifflin in my mind), no, nor even against\r\nAndrew\'s--but as I say, I\'ve got some ideas of my own. I\'ve learned\r\nthat honest work counts in writing books just as much as it does in\r\nwashing dishes. I guess Andrew\'s books must be some good after all\r\nbecause he surely does mull over them without end. I can forgive\r\nhis being a shiftless farmer so long as he really does his literary\r\nchores up to the hilt. A man can be slack in everything else, if\r\nhe does one thing as well as he possibly can. And I guess it won\'t\r\nmatter my being an ignoramus in literature so long as I\'m rated A-1\r\nin the kitchen. That\'s what I used to think as I polished and\r\nscoured and scrubbed and dusted and swept and then set about getting\r\ndinner. If I ever sat down to read for ten minutes the cat would\r\nget into the custard. No woman in the country sits down for fifteen\r\nconsecutive minutes between sunrise and sunset, anyway, unless\r\nshe has half a dozen servants. And nobody knows anything about\r\nliterature unless he spends most of his life sitting down. So\r\nthere you are.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of philosophic reflection was a new experience for\r\nme. Peg ambled along contentedly and the dog trailed under Parnassus\r\nwhere I had tied him. I read "Vanity Fair" and thought about all\r\nsorts of things. Once I got out to pick some scarlet maple leaves\r\nthat attracted me. The motors passing annoyed me with their dust\r\nand noise, but by and by one of them stopped, looked at my outfit\r\ncuriously, and then asked to see some books. I put up the flaps for\r\nthem and we pulled off to one side of the road and had a good talk.\r\nThey bought two or three books, too.\r\n\r\nBy the time I neared Bath the hands of my watch pointed to supper.\r\nI was still a bit shy of Mifflin\'s scheme of stopping overnight at\r\nfarmhouses, so I thought I\'d go right into the town and look for a\r\nhotel. The next day was Sunday, so it seemed reasonable to give the\r\nhorse a good rest and stay in Bath two nights. The Hominy House\r\nlooked clean and old-fashioned, and the name amused me, so in I\r\nwent. It was a kind of high-class boarding-house, with mostly old\r\nwomen around. It looked to me almost literary and Elbert Hubbardish\r\ncompared to the Grand Central in Shelby. The folks there stared at\r\nme somewhat suspiciously and I half thought they were going to say\r\nthey didn\'t take pedlars; but when I flashed a new five-dollar bill\r\nat the desk I got good service. A five-dollar bill is a patent of\r\nnobility in New England.\r\n\r\nMy! how I enjoyed that creamed chicken on toast, and buckwheat cakes\r\nwith syrup! After you get used to cooking all your own grub, a meal\r\noff some one else\'s stove is the finest kind of treat. After supper\r\nI was all prepared to sit out on the porch with my sweater on and\r\ngive a rocking chair a hot box, but then I remembered that it was up\r\nto me to carry on the traditions of Parnassus. I was there to spread\r\nthe gospel of good books. I got to thinking how the Professor never\r\nshirked carrying on his campaign, and I determined that I would be\r\nworthy of the cause.\r\n\r\nWhen I think back about the experience, it seems pretty crazy, but\r\nat the time I was filled with a kind of evangelistic zeal. I thought\r\nif I was going to try to sell books I might as well have some fun\r\nout of it. Most of the old ladies were squatting about in the\r\nparlour, knitting or reading or playing cards. In the smoking-room I\r\ncould see two dried-up men. Mrs. Hominy, the manager of the place,\r\nwas sitting at her desk behind a brass railing, going over accounts\r\nwith a quill pen. I thought that the house probably hadn\'t had a\r\nshock since Walt Whitman wrote "Leaves of Grass." In a kind of\r\ndo-or-die spirit I determined to give them a rouse.\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room I had noticed a huge dinner bell that stood\r\nbehind the door. I stepped in there, and got it. Standing in the\r\nbig hall I began ringing it as hard as I could shake my arm.\r\n\r\nYou might have thought it was a fire alarm. Mrs. Hominy dropped her\r\npen in horror. The colonial dames in the parlour came to life and\r\nran into the hall like cockroaches. In a minute I had gathered quite\r\na respectable audience. It was up to me to do the spellbinding.\r\n\r\n"Friends," I said (unconsciously imitating the Professor\'s tricks\r\nof the trade, I guess), "this bell which generally summons you to\r\nthe groaning board now calls you to a literary repast. With the\r\npermission of the management, and with apologies for disturbing your\r\ntranquillity, I will deliver a few remarks on the value of good\r\nbooks. I see that several of you are fond of reading, so perhaps the\r\ntopic will be congenial?"\r\n\r\nThey gazed at me about as warmly as a round of walnut sundaes.\r\n\r\n"Ladies and Gentlemen," I continued, "of course you remember the\r\nstory of Abe Lincoln when he said, \'if you call a leg a tail, how\r\nmany tails has a dog?\' \'Five,\' you answer. Wrong; because, as Mr.\r\nLincoln said, calling a leg a tail...."\r\n\r\nI still think it was a good beginning. But that was as far as I got.\r\nMrs. Hominy came out of her trance, hastened from the cage, and\r\ngrabbed my arm. She was quite red with anger.\r\n\r\n"Really!" she said. "Well, really!... I must ask you to continue\r\nthis in some other place. We do not allow commercial travellers in\r\nthis house."\r\n\r\nAnd within fifteen minutes they had hitched up Peg and asked me to\r\nmove on. Indeed I was so taken aback by my own zeal that I could\r\nhardly protest. In a kind of daze I found myself at the Moose Hotel,\r\nwhere they assured me that they catered to mercantile people. I went\r\nstraight to my room and fell asleep as soon as I reached the straw\r\nmattress.\r\n\r\nThat was my first and only public speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday, October sixth. I well remember the date.\r\n\r\nI woke up as chipper as any Robert W. Chambers heroine. All my\r\ndoubts and depressions of the evening before had fled, and I was\r\nsingle-heartedly delighted with the world and everything in it. The\r\nhotel was a poor place, but it would have taken more than that to\r\nmar my composure. I had a bitterly cold bath in a real country tin\r\ntub, and then eggs and pancakes for breakfast. At the table was\r\na drummer who sold lightning rods, and several other travelling\r\nsalesmen. I\'m afraid my conversation was consciously modelled along\r\nthe line of what the Professor would have said if he had been there,\r\nbut at any rate I got along swimmingly. The travelling men, after a\r\nmoment or two of embarrassed diffidence, treated me quite as one of\r\nthemselves and asked me about my "line" with interest. I described\r\nwhat I was doing and they all said they envied me my freedom to come\r\nand go independently of trains. We talked cheerfully for a long\r\ntime, and almost without intending to, I started preaching about\r\nbooks. In the end they insisted on my showing them Parnassus. We\r\nall went out to the stable, where the van was quartered, and they\r\nbrowsed over the shelves. Before I knew it I had sold five dollars\'\r\nworth, although I had decided not to do any business at all on\r\nSunday. But I couldn\'t refuse to sell them the stuff as they all\r\nseemed so keen on getting something really good to read. One man\r\nkept on talking about Harold Bell Wright, but I had to admit that\r\nI hadn\'t heard of him. Evidently the Professor hadn\'t stocked any\r\nof his works. I was tickled to see that after all little Redbeard\r\ndidn\'t know _everything_ about literature.\r\n\r\nAfter that I debated whether to go to church or to write letters.\r\nFinally I decided in favour of the letters. First I tackled Andrew.\r\nI wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moose Hotel, Bath,\r\nSunday morning.\r\n\r\nDEAR ANDREW:\r\n\r\nIt seems absurd to think that it\'s only three days since I left\r\nSabine Farm. Honestly, more has happened to me in these three days\r\nthan in three years at home.\r\n\r\nI\'m sorry that you and Mr. Mifflin disagreed but I quite understood\r\nyour feelings. But I\'m very angry that you should have tried to\r\nstop that check I gave him. It was none of your business, Andrew.\r\nI telephoned Mr. Shirley and made him send word to the bank in\r\nWoodbridge to give Mifflin the money. Mr. Mifflin did not swindle me\r\ninto buying Parnassus. I did it of my own free will. If you want to\r\nknow the truth, it was your fault! I bought it because I was scared\r\n_you_ would if I didn\'t. And I didn\'t want to be left all alone on\r\nthe farm from now till Thanksgiving while you went off on another\r\ntrip. So I decided to do the thing myself. I thought I\'d see how you\r\nwould like being left all alone to run the house. I thought it\'d be\r\npretty nice for me to get things off my mind a while and have an\r\nadventure of my own.\r\n\r\nNow, Andrew, here are some directions for you:\r\n\r\n1. Don\'t forget to feed the chickens twice a day, and collect _all_\r\nthe eggs. There\'s a nest behind the wood pile, and some of the\r\nWyandottes have been laying under the ice house.\r\n\r\n2. Don\'t let Rosie touch grandmother\'s blue china, because she\'ll\r\nbreak it as sure as fate if she lays her big, thick Swedish fingers\r\non it.\r\n\r\n3. Don\'t forget your warmer underwear. The nights are getting\r\nchilly.\r\n\r\n4. I forgot to put the cover on the sewing machine. Please do that\r\nfor me or it\'ll get all dusty.\r\n\r\n5. Don\'t let the cat run loose in the house at night: he always\r\nbreaks something.\r\n\r\n6. Send your socks and anything else that needs darning over to Mrs.\r\nMcNally, she can do it for you.\r\n\r\n7. Don\'t forget to feed the pigs.\r\n\r\n8. Don\'t forget to mend the weathervane on the barn.\r\n\r\n9. Don\'t forget to send that barrel of apples over to the cider mill\r\nor you won\'t have any cider to drink when Mr. Decameron comes up to\r\nsee us later in the fall.\r\n\r\n10. Just to make ten commandments, I\'ll add one more: You might\r\n\'phone to Mrs. Collins that the Dorcas will have to meet at some\r\none else\'s house next week, because I don\'t know just when I\'ll get\r\nback. I may be away a fortnight more. This is my first holiday in a\r\nlong time and I\'m going to chew it before I swallow it.\r\n\r\nThe Professor (Mr. Mifflin, I mean) has gone back to Brooklyn to\r\nwork on his book. I\'m sorry you and he had to mix it up on the high\r\nroad like a couple of hooligans. He\'s a nice little man and you\'d\r\nlike him if you got to know him.\r\n\r\nI\'m spending Sunday in Bath: to-morrow I\'m going on toward Hastings.\r\nI\'ve sold five dollars\' worth of books this morning even if it is\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nYour affte sister\r\nHELEN McGiLL.\r\n\r\nP.S. Don\'t forget to clean the separator after using it, or it\'ll\r\nget in a fearful state.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter writing to Andrew I thought I would send a message to the\r\nProfessor. I had already written him a long letter in my mind, but\r\nsomehow when I began putting it on paper a sort of awkwardness came\r\nover me. I didn\'t know just how to begin. I thought how much more\r\nfun it would be if he were there himself and I could listen to him\r\ntalk. And then, while I was writing the first few sentences, some\r\nof the drummers came back into the room.\r\n\r\n"Thought you\'d like to see a Sunday paper," said one of them.\r\n\r\nI picked up the newspaper with a word of thanks and ran an eye over\r\nthe headlines. The ugly black letters stood up before me, and my\r\nheart gave a great contraction. I felt my fingertips turn cold.\r\n\r\n  DISASTROUS WRECK\r\n  ON THE SHORE LINE\r\n  EXPRESS RUNS INTO OPEN SWITCH\r\n  --\r\n  TEN LIVES LOST, AND\r\n  MORE THAN A SCORE INJURED\r\n  --\r\n  FAILURE OF BLOCK SIGNALS\r\n\r\nThe letters seemed to stand up before me as large as a Malted Milk\r\nsignboard. With a shuddering apprehension I read the details.\r\nApparently the express that left Providence at four o\'clock on\r\nSaturday afternoon had crashed into an open siding near Willdon\r\nabout six o\'clock, and collided with a string of freight empties.\r\nThe baggage car had been demolished and the smoker had turned over\r\nand gone down an embankment. There were ten men killed... my head\r\nswam. Was that the train the Professor had taken? Let me see. He\r\nleft Woodbridge on a local train at three. He had said the day\r\nbefore that the express left Port Vigor at five.... If he had\r\nchanged to the express.....\r\n\r\nIn a kind of fascinated horror my eye caught the list of the dead.\r\nI ran down the names. Thank God, no, Mifflin was not among them.\r\nThen I saw the last entry:\r\n\r\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN, MIDDLE-AGED.\r\n\r\nWhat if that should be the Professor?\r\n\r\nAnd I suddenly felt dizzy, and for the first time in my life I\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\nThank goodness, no one else was in the room. The drummers had gone\r\noutside again, and no one heard me flop off the chair. I came to in\r\na moment, my heart whirling like a spinning top. At first I did not\r\nrealize what was wrong. Then my eye fell on the newspaper again.\r\nFeverishly I re-read the account, and the names of the injured, too,\r\nwhich I had missed before. Nowhere was there a name I knew. But the\r\ntragic words "unidentified man" danced before my eyes. Oh! if it\r\nwere the Professor....\r\n\r\nIn a wave the truth burst upon me. I loved that little man: I loved\r\nhim, I loved him. He had brought something new into my life, and his\r\nbrave, quaint ways had warmed my fat old heart. For the first time,\r\nin an intolerable gush of pain, I seemed to know that my life could\r\nnever again be endurable without him. And now--what was I to do?\r\n\r\nHow could I learn the truth? Certainly if he _had_ been on the\r\ntrain, and had escaped from the wreck unhurt, he would have sent\r\na message to Sabine Farm to let me know. At any rate, that was a\r\npossibility. I rushed to the telephone to call up Andrew.\r\n\r\nOh! the agonizing slowness of telephone connections when urgent\r\nhurry is needed! My voice shook as I said "Redfield 158 J" to the\r\noperator. Throbbing with nervousness I waited to hear the familiar\r\nclick of the receiver at the other end. I could hear the Redfield\r\nswitchboard receive the call, and put in the plug to connect with\r\nour wire. In imagination I could see the telephone against the wall\r\nin the old hallway at Sabine Farm. I could see the soiled patch of\r\nplaster where Andrew rests his elbow when he talks into the \'phone,\r\nand the place where he jots numbers down in pencil and I rub\r\nthem off with bread crumbs. I could see Andrew coming out of\r\nthe sitting-room to answer the bell. And then the operator said\r\ncarelessly, "Doesn\'t answer." My forehead was wet as I came out\r\nof the booth.\r\n\r\nI hope I may never have to re-live the horrors of the next hour.\r\nIn spite of my bluff and hearty ways, in times of trouble I am as\r\nreticent as a clam. I was determined to hide my agony and anxiety\r\nfrom the well-meaning people of the Moose Hotel. I hurried to the\r\nrailway station to send a telegram to the Professor\'s address in\r\nBrooklyn, but found the place closed. A boy told me it would not be\r\nopen until the afternoon. From a drugstore I called "information" in\r\nWilldon, and finally got connected with some undertaker to whom the\r\nWilldon operator referred me. A horrible, condoling voice (have you\r\never talked to an undertaker over the telephone?) answered me that\r\nno one by the name of Mifflin had been among the dead, but admitted\r\nthat there was one body still unidentified. He used one ghastly word\r\nthat made me shudder--unrecognizable. I rang off.\r\n\r\nI knew then for the first time the horror of loneliness. I thought\r\nof the poor little man\'s notebook that I had seen. I thought of his\r\nfearless and lovable ways--of his pathetic little tweed cap, of the\r\nmissing button of his jacket, of the bungling darns on his frayed\r\nsleeve. It seemed to me that heaven could mean nothing more than to\r\nroll creaking along country roads, in Parnassus, with the Professor\r\nbeside me on the seat. What if I had known him only--how long was\r\nit? He had brought the splendour of an ideal into my humdrum life.\r\nAnd now--had I lost it forever? Andrew and the farm seemed faint and\r\nfar away. I was a homely old woman, mortally lonely and helpless.\r\nIn my perplexity I walked to the outskirts of the village and burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\nFinally I got a grip on myself again. I am not ashamed to say that\r\nI now admitted frankly what I had been hiding from myself. I was in\r\nlove--in love with a little, red-bearded bookseller who seemed to me\r\nmore splendid than Sir Galahad. And I vowed that if he would have\r\nme, I would follow him to the other end of nowhere.\r\n\r\nI walked back to the hotel. I thought I would make one more try to\r\nget Andrew on the telephone. My whole soul quivered when at last I\r\nheard the receiver click.\r\n\r\n"Hello?" said Andrew\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Andrew," I said, "this is Helen."\r\n\r\n"Where are you?" (His voice sounded cross.)\r\n\r\n"Andrew, is there any--any message from Mr. Mifflin? That wreck\r\nyesterday--he might have been on that train--I\'ve been so\r\nfrightened; do you think he was--hurt?"\r\n\r\n"Stuff and nonsense," said Andrew. "If you want to know about\r\nMifflin, he\'s in jail in Port Vigor."\r\n\r\nAnd then I think Andrew must have been surprised. I began to laugh\r\nand cry simultaneously, and in my agitation I set down the receiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was to hide myself in some obscure corner where I\r\ncould vent my feelings without fear or favour. I composed my face\r\nas well as I could before leaving the \'phone booth; then I sidled\r\nacross the lobby and slipped out of the side door. I found my way\r\ninto the stable, where good old Peg was munching in her stall. The\r\nfine, homely smell of horseflesh and long-worn harness leather went\r\nright to my heart, and while Bock frisked at my knees I laid my head\r\non Peg\'s neck and cried. I think that fat old mare understood me.\r\nShe was as tubby and prosaic and middle-aged as I--but she loved the\r\nProfessor.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Andrew\'s words echoed again in my mind. I had barely\r\nheeded them before, in the great joy of my relief, but now their\r\nsignificance came to me. "In jail." The Professor in jail! That was\r\nthe meaning of his strange disappearance at Woodbridge. That little\r\nbrute of a man Shirley must have telephoned from Redfield, and when\r\nthe Professor came to the Woodbridge bank to cash that check they\r\nhad arrested him. That was why they had shoved me into that mahogany\r\nsitting-room. Andrew must be behind this. The besotted old fool! My\r\nface burned with anger and humiliation.\r\n\r\nI never knew before what it means to be really infuriated. I could\r\nfeel my brain tingle. The Professor in jail! The gallant, chivalrous\r\nlittle man, penned up with hoboes and sneak thieves suspected of\r\nbeing a crook... as if I couldn\'t take care of myself! What did they\r\nthink he was, anyway? A kidnapper?\r\n\r\nInstantly I decided I would hurry back to Port Vigor without delay.\r\nIf Andrew had had the Professor locked up, it could only be on the\r\ncharge of defrauding me. Certainly it couldn\'t be for giving him a\r\nbloody nose on the road from Shelby. And if I appeared to deny the\r\ncharge, surely they would have to let Mr. Mifflin go.\r\n\r\nI believe I must have been talking to myself in Peg\'s stall--at\r\nany rate, just at this moment the stableman appeared and looked\r\nvery bewildered when he saw me, with flushed face and in obvious\r\nexcitement, talking to the horse. I asked him when was the next\r\ntrain to Port Vigor.\r\n\r\n"Well, ma\'am," he said, "they say that all the local trains is held\r\nup till the wreck at Willdon\'s cleared away. This being Sunday, I\r\ndon\'t think you\'ll get anything from here until to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nI reflected. It wasn\'t so awfully far back to Port Vigor. A flivver\r\nfrom the local garage could spin me back there in a couple of\r\nhours at the most. But somehow it seemed more fitting to go to the\r\nProfessor\'s rescue in his own Parnassus, even if it would take\r\nlonger to get there. To tell the truth, while I was angry and\r\nhumiliated at the thought of his being put in jail by Andrew, I\r\ncouldn\'t help, deep down within me, being rather thankful. Suppose\r\nhe had been in the wreck? The Sage of Redfield had played the part\r\nof Providence after all. And if I set out right away with Parnassus,\r\nI could get to Port Vigor--well, by Monday morning anyway.\r\n\r\nThe good people of the Moose Hotel were genuinely surprised at\r\nthe hurry with which I dispatched my lunch. But I gave them no\r\nexplanations. Goodness knows, my head was full of other thoughts and\r\nthe apple sauce might have been asbestos. You know, a woman only\r\nfalls in love once in her life, and if it waits until she\'s darn\r\nnear forty--well, it _takes!_ You see I hadn\'t even been vaccinated\r\nagainst it by girlish flirtations. I began to be a governess when\r\nI was just a kid, and a governess doesn\'t get many chances to be\r\nskittish. So now when it came, it hit me hard. That\'s when a woman\r\nfinds herself--when she\'s in love. I don\'t care if she _is_ old or\r\nfat or homely or prosy. She feels that little flutter under her ribs\r\nand she drops from the tree like a ripe plum. I didn\'t care if Roger\r\nMifflin and I were as odd a couple as old Dr. Johnson and his wife,\r\nI only knew one thing: that when I saw that little red devil again I\r\nwas going to be all his--if he\'d have me. That\'s why the old Moose\r\nHotel in Bath is always sacred to me. That\'s where I learned that\r\nlife still held something fresh for me--something better than baking\r\nchamplain biscuits for Andrew.\r\n\r\n   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nThat Sunday was one of those mellow, golden days that we New\r\nEnglanders get in October. The year really begins in March, as\r\nevery farmer knows, and by the end of September or the beginning of\r\nOctober the season has come to its perfect, ripened climax. There\r\nare a few days when the world seems to hang still in a dreaming,\r\nsweet hush, at the very fulness of the fruit before the decline\r\nsets in. I have no words (like Andrew) to describe it, but every\r\nautumn for years I have noticed it. I remember that sometimes at\r\nthe farm I used to lean over the wood pile for a moment just before\r\nsupper to watch those purple October sunsets. I would hear the sharp\r\nting of Andrew\'s little typewriter bell as he was working in his\r\nstudy. And then I would try to swallow down within me the beauty\r\nand wistfulness of it all, and run back to mash the potatoes.\r\n\r\nPeg drew Parnassus along the backward road with a merry little\r\nrumble. I think she knew we were going back to the Professor.\r\nBock careered mightily along the wayside. And I had much time for\r\nthinking. On the whole, I was glad; for I had much to ponder. An\r\nadventure that had started as a mere lark or whim had now become for\r\nme the very gist of life itself. I was fanciful, I guess, and as\r\nromantic as a young hen, but by the bones of George Eliot, I\'m sorry\r\nfor the woman that never has a chance to be fanciful. Mifflin was\r\nin jail; aye, but he might have been dead and--unrecognizable! My\r\nheart refused to be altogether sad. I was on my way to deliver him\r\nfrom durance vile. There seemed a kinship between the season and\r\nmyself, I mused, seeing the goldenrod turning bronze and droopy\r\nalong the way. Here was I, in the full fruition of womanhood, on the\r\nverge of my decline into autumn, and lo! by the grace of God, I had\r\nfound my man, my master. He had touched me with his own fire and\r\ncourage. I didn\'t care what happened to Andrew, or to Sabine Farm,\r\nor to anything else in the world. Here were my hearth and my\r\nhome--Parnassus, or wherever Roger should pitch his tent. I dreamed\r\nof crossing the Brooklyn Bridge with him at dusk, watching the\r\nskyscrapers etched against a burning sky. I believed in calling\r\nthings by their true names. Ink is ink, even if the bottle is marked\r\n"commercial fluid." I didn\'t try to blink the fact that I was in\r\nlove. In fact, I gloried in it. As Parnassus rolled along the road,\r\nand the scarlet maple leaves eddied gently down in the blue October\r\nair, I made up a kind of chant which I called\r\n\r\n  Hymn for a Middle-Aged Woman (Fat)\r\n  Who Has Fallen into Love\r\n\r\n  O God, I thank Thee who sent this great adventure my way!\r\n  I am grateful to have come out of the barren land of\r\n  spinsterhood, seeing the glory of a love greater than myself.\r\n  I thank Thee for teaching me that mixing, and kneading, and\r\n  baking are not all that life holds for me. Even if he doesn\'t\r\n  love me, God, I shall always be his.\r\n\r\nI was crooning some such babble as this to myself when, near\r\nWoodbridge, I came upon a big, shiny motor car stranded by the\r\nroadside. Several people, evidently intelligent and well-to-do,\r\nsat under a tree while their chauffeur fussed with a tire. I was\r\nso absorbed in my own thoughts that I think I should have gone\r\nby without paying them much heed, but suddenly I remembered the\r\nProfessor\'s creed--to preach the gospel of books in and out of\r\nseason. Sunday or no Sunday, I thought I could best honour Mifflin\r\nby acting on his own principle. I pulled up by the side of the road.\r\n\r\nI noticed the people turn to one another in a kind of surprise, and\r\nwhisper something. There was an elderly man with a lean, hard-worked\r\nface; a stout woman, evidently his wife; and two young girls and a\r\nman in golfing clothes. Somehow the face of the older man seemed\r\nfamiliar. I wondered whether he were some literary friend of\r\nAndrew\'s whose photo I had seen.\r\n\r\nBock stood by the wheel with his long, curly tongue running in and\r\nout over his teeth. I hesitated a moment, thinking just how to\r\nphrase my attack, when the elderly gentleman called out:\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the Professor?"\r\n\r\nI was beginning to realize that Mifflin was indeed a public character.\r\n\r\n"Heavens!" I said. "Do you know him, too?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I should think so," he said. "Didn\'t he come to see me last\r\nspring about an appropriation for school libraries, and wouldn\'t\r\nleave till I\'d promised to do what he wanted! He stayed the night\r\nwith us and we talked literature till four o\'clock in the morning.\r\nWhere is he now? Have you taken over Parnassus?"\r\n\r\n"Just at present," I said, "Mr. Mifflin is in the jail at Port Vigor."\r\n\r\nThe ladies gave little cries of astonishment, and the gentleman\r\nhimself (I had sized him up as a school commissioner or something\r\nof that sort) seemed not less surprised.\r\n\r\n"In jail!" he said. "What on earth for? Has he sandbagged somebody\r\nfor reading Nick Carter and Bertha M. Clay? That\'s about the only\r\ncrime he\'d be likely to commit."\r\n\r\n"He\'s supposed to have cozened me out of four hundred dollars," I\r\nsaid, "and my brother has had him locked up. But as a matter of fact\r\nhe wouldn\'t swindle a hen out of a new-laid egg. I bought Parnassus\r\nof my own free will. I\'m on my way to Port Vigor now to get him out.\r\nThen I\'m going to ask him to marry me--if he will. It\'s not leap\r\nyear, either."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me, his thin, lined face working with friendliness. He\r\nwas a fine-looking man--short, gray hair brushed away from a broad,\r\nbrown forehead. I noticed his rich, dark suit and the spotless\r\ncollar. This was a man of breeding, evidently.\r\n\r\n"Well, Madam," he said, "any friend of the Professor is a friend of\r\nours." (His wife and the girls chimed in with assent.) "If you would\r\nlike a lift in our car to speed you on your errand, I\'m sure Bob\r\nhere would be glad to drive Parnassus into Port Vigor. Our tire will\r\nsoon be mended."\r\n\r\nThe young man assented heartily, but as I said before, I was bent\r\non taking Parnassus back myself. I thought the sight of his own\r\ntabernacle would be the best balm for Mifflin\'s annoying experience.\r\nSo I refused the offer, and explained the situation a little more\r\nfully.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, "then let me help in any way I can." He took a\r\ncard from his pocket-book and scribbled something on it. "When you\r\nget to Port Vigor," he said, "show this at the jail and I don\'t\r\nthink you\'ll have any trouble. I happen to know the people there."\r\n\r\nSo after a hand-shake all round I went on again, much cheered by\r\nthis friendly little incident. It wasn\'t till I was some way along\r\nthe road that I thought of looking at the card he had given me. Then\r\nI realized why the man\'s face had been familiar. The card read quite\r\nsimply:\r\n\r\nRALEIGH STONE STAFFORD\r\n\r\nThe Executive Mansion,\r\nDarlington.\r\n\r\nIt was the Governor of the State!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t help chuckling, as Parnassus came over the brow of the\r\nhill, and I saw the river in the distance once more. How different\r\nall this was from my girlhood visions of romance. That has been\r\ncharacteristic of my life all along--it has been full of homely,\r\nworkaday happenings, and often rather comic in spite of my best\r\nresolves to be highbrow and serious. All the same I was something\r\nnear to tears as I thought of the tragic wreck at Willdon and the\r\ngrief-laden hearts that must be mourning. I wondered whether the\r\nGovernor was now returning from Willdon after ordering an inquiry.\r\n\r\nOn his card he had written: "Please release R. Mifflin at once\r\nand show this lady all courtesies." So I didn\'t anticipate any\r\nparticular trouble. This made me all the more anxious to push on,\r\nand after crossing the ferry we halted in Woodbridge only long\r\nenough for supper. I drove past the bank where I had waited in the\r\nanteroom, and would have been glad of a chance to horsewhip that\r\nsneaking little cashier. I wondered how they had transported the\r\nProfessor to Port Vigor, and thought ironically that it was only\r\nthat Saturday morning when he had suggested taking the hoboes to\r\nthe same jail. Still I do not doubt that his philosophic spirit\r\nhad made the best of it all.\r\n\r\nWoodbridge was as dead as any country town is on Sunday night.\r\nAt the little hotel where I had supper there was no topic of\r\nconversation except the wreck. But the proprietor, when I paid\r\nmy bill, happened to notice Parnassus in the yard.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the bus that pedlar sold you, ain\'t it?" he asked with\r\na leer.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, shortly.\r\n\r\n"Goin\' back to prosecute him, I guess?" he suggested. "Say, that\r\nfeller\'s a devil, believe _me_. When the sheriff tried to put the\r\ncuffs on him he gave him a black eye and pretty near broke his\r\njaw. Some scrapper fer a midget!"\r\n\r\nMy own brave little fighter, I thought, and flushed with pride.\r\n\r\nThe road back to Port Vigor seemed endless. I was a little nervous,\r\nremembering the tramps in Pratt\'s quarry, but with Bock sitting\r\nbeside me on the seat I thought it craven to be alarmed. We rumbled\r\ngently through the darkness, between aisles of inky pines where the\r\nstrip of starlight ran like a ribbon overhead, then on the rolling\r\ndunes that overlook the water. There was a moon, too, but I was\r\nmortally tired and lonely and longed only to see my little Redbeard.\r\nPeg was weary, too, and plodded slowly. It must have been midnight\r\nbefore we saw the red and green lights of the railway signals and I\r\nknew that Port Vigor was at hand.\r\n\r\nI decided to camp where I was. I guided Peg into a field beside the\r\nroad, hitched her to a fence, and took the dog into the van with me.\r\nI was too tired to undress. I fell into the bunk and drew the\r\nblankets over me. As I did so, something dropped down behind the\r\nbunk with a sharp rap. It was a forgotten corncob pipe of the\r\nProfessor\'s, blackened and sooty. I put it under my pillow, and\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\nMonday, October seventh. If this were a novel about some charming,\r\nslender, pansy-eyed girl, how differently I would have to describe\r\nthe feelings with which I woke the next morning. But these being\r\nonly a few pages from the life of a fat, New England housewife, I\r\nmust be candid. I woke feeling dull and sour. The day was gray and\r\ncool: faint shreds of mist sifting up from the Sound and a desolate\r\nmewing of seagulls in the air. I was unhappy, upset, and--yes--shy.\r\nPassionately I yearned to run to the Professor, to gather him into\r\nmy arms, to be alone with him in Parnassus, creaking up some sunny\r\nby-road. But his words came back to me: I was nothing to him. What\r\nif he didn\'t love me after all?\r\n\r\nI walked across two fields, down to the beach where little waves\r\nwere slapping against the shingle. I washed my face and hands in\r\nsalt water. Then I went back to Parnassus and brewed some coffee\r\nwith condensed milk. I gave Peg and Bock their breakfasts. Then I\r\nhitched Peg to the van again, and felt better. As I drove into the\r\ntown I had to wait at the grade crossing while a wrecking train\r\nrumbled past, on its way back from Willdon. That meant that the\r\nline was clear again. I watched the grimy men on the cars, and\r\nshuddered to think what they had been doing.\r\n\r\nThe Vigor county jail lies about a mile out of the town, an ugly,\r\ngray stone barracks with a high, spiked wall about it. I was\r\nthankful that it was still fairly early in the morning, and I drove\r\nthrough the streets without seeing any one I knew. Finally I reached\r\nthe gate in the prison wall. Here some kind of a keeper barred my\r\nway. "Can\'t get in, lady," he said. "Yesterday was visitors\' day.\r\nNo more visitors till next month."\r\n\r\n"I _must_ get in," I said. "You\'ve got a man in there on a\r\nfalse charge."\r\n\r\n"So they all say," he retorted, calmly, and spat halfway across the\r\nroad. "You wouldn\'t believe any of our boarders had a right to be\r\nhere if you could hear their friends talk."\r\n\r\nI showed him Governor Stafford\'s card. He was rather impressed\r\nby this, and retired into a sentry-box in the wall--to telephone,\r\nI suppose.\r\n\r\nPresently he came back.\r\n\r\n"The sheriff says he\'ll see you, ma\'am. But you\'ll have to leave\r\nthis here dynamite caboose behind." He unlocked a little door in the\r\nimmense iron gate, and turned me over to another man inside. "Take\r\nthis here lady to the sheriff," he said.\r\n\r\nSome of Vigor county\'s prisoners must have learned to be pretty good\r\ngardeners, for certainly the grounds were in good condition. The\r\ngrass was green and trimly mowed; there were conventional beds of\r\nflowers in very ugly shapes; in the distance I saw a gang of men\r\nin striped overalls mending a roadway. The guide led me to an\r\nattractive cottage to one side of the main building. There were two\r\nchildren playing outside, and I remember thinking that within the\r\nwalls of a jail was surely a queer place to bring up youngsters.\r\n\r\nBut I had other things to think about. I looked up at that grim,\r\ngray building. Behind one of those little barred windows was the\r\nProfessor. I should have been angry at Andrew, but somehow it all\r\nseemed a kind of dream. Then I was taken into the hallway of the\r\nsheriff\'s cottage and in a minute I was talking to a big,\r\nbull-necked man with a political moustache.\r\n\r\n"You have a prisoner here called Roger Mifflin?" I said.\r\n\r\n"My dear Madam, I don\'t keep a list of all our inmates in my\r\nhead. If you will come to the office we will look up the records."\r\n\r\nI showed him the Governor\'s card. He took it and kept looking at it\r\nas though he expected to see the message written there change or\r\nfade away. We walked across a strip of lawn to the prison building.\r\nThere, in a big bare office, he ran over a card index.\r\n\r\n"Here we are," he said. "Roger Mifflin; age, 41; face, oval;\r\ncomplexion, florid; hair, red but not much of it; height, 64\r\ninches; weight, stripped, 120; birthmark...."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," I said. "That\'s the man. What\'s he here for?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s held in default of bail, pending trial. The charge is attempt\r\nto defraud one Helen McGill, spinster, age..."\r\n\r\n"Rubbish!" I said. "I\'m Helen McGill, and the man made no attempt to\r\ndefraud me."\r\n\r\n"The charge was entered and warrant applied for by your brother,\r\nAndrew McGill, acting on your behalf."\r\n\r\n"I never authorized Andrew to act on my behalf."\r\n\r\n"Then do you withdraw the charge?"\r\n\r\n"By all means," I said. "I\'ve a great mind to enter a counter-charge\r\nagainst Andrew and have _him_ arrested."\r\n\r\n"This is all very irregular," said the sheriff, "but if the prisoner\r\nis known to the Governor, I suppose there is no alternative. I\r\ncannot annul the warrant without some recognizance. According to\r\nthe laws of this State the next of kin must stand surety for the\r\nprisoner\'s good behaviour after release. There is no next of kin...."\r\n\r\n"Surely there is!" I said. "I am the prisoner\'s next of kin."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" he said. "In what relationship do you\r\nstand to this Roger Mifflin?"\r\n\r\n"I intend to marry him just as soon as I can get him away from here."\r\n\r\nHe burst into a roar of laughter. "I guess there\'s no stopping you,"\r\nhe said. He pinned the Governor\'s card to a blue paper on the desk,\r\nand began filling in some blanks.\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss McGill," he went on, "don\'t take away more than one of\r\nmy prisoners or I\'ll lose my job. The turnkey will take you up to\r\nthe cell. I\'m exceedingly sorry: you can see that the mistake was\r\nnone of our fault. Tell the Governor that, will you, when you see\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\nI followed the attendant up two flights of bare, stone stairs, and\r\ndown a long, whitewashed corridor. It was a gruesome place; rows\r\nand rows of heavy doors with little, barred windows. I noticed\r\nthat each door had a combination knob, like a safe. My knees felt\r\nawfully shaky.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn\'t really so heart-throbby as I had expected. The jailer\r\nstopped at the end of a long passageway. He spun the clicking dial,\r\nwhile I waited in a kind of horror. I think I expected to see the\r\nProfessor with shaved head (they couldn\'t shave much off his head,\r\npoor lamb!) and striped canvas suit, and a ball and chain on his\r\nankle.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open heavily. There was a narrow, clean little room\r\nwith a low camp bed, and under the barred window a table strewn with\r\nsheets of paper. It was the Professor in his own clothes, writing\r\nbusily, with his back toward me. Perhaps he thought it was only\r\nan attendant with food, or perhaps he didn\'t even hear the\r\ninterruption. I could hear his pen running busily. I might have\r\nknown you never would get any heroics out of that man! Trust him\r\nto make the best of it!\r\n\r\n"Lemon sole and a glass of sherry, please, James," said the\r\nProfessor over his shoulder, and the warder, who evidently had\r\njoked with him before, broke into a cackle of laughter.\r\n\r\n"A lady to see yer Lordship," he said.\r\n\r\nThe Professor turned round. His face went quite white. For the first\r\ntime in my experience of him he seemed to be at a loss for speech.\r\n\r\n"Miss--Miss McGill," he stammered. "You _are_ the good Samaritan.\r\nI\'m doing the John Bunyan act, see? Writing in prison. I\'ve really\r\nstarted my book at last. And I find the fellows here know nothing\r\nwhatever about literature. There isn\'t even a library in the place."\r\n\r\nFor the life of me, I couldn\'t utter the tenderness in my heart with\r\nthat gorilla of a jailer standing behind us.\r\n\r\nSomehow we made our way downstairs, after the Professor had gathered\r\ntogether the sheets of his manuscript. It had already reached\r\nformidable proportions, as he had written fifty pages in the\r\nthirty-six hours he had been in prison. In the office we had to sign\r\nsome papers. The sheriff was very apologetic to Mifflin, and offered\r\nto take him back to town in his car, but I explained that Parnassus\r\nwas waiting at the gate. The Professor\'s eyes brightened when he\r\nheard that, but I had to hurry him away from an argument about\r\nputting good books in prisons. The sheriff walked with us to the\r\ngate and there shook hands again.\r\n\r\nPeg whickered as we came up to her, and the Professor patted her\r\nsoft nose. Bock tugged at his chain in a frenzy of joy. At last we\r\nwere alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nI never knew just how it happened. Instead of driving back through\r\nPort Vigor, we turned into a side road leading up over the hill and\r\nacross the heath where the air came fresh and sweet from the sea.\r\nThe Professor sat very silent, looking about him. There was a grove\r\nof birches on the hill, and the sunlight played upon their satin\r\nboles.\r\n\r\n"It feels good to be out again," he said calmly. "The Sage cannot\r\nbe so keen a lover of open air as his books would indicate, or he\r\nwouldn\'t be so ready to clap a man into quod. Perhaps I owe him\r\nanother punch on the nose for that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Roger," I said--and I\'m afraid my voice was trembly--"I\'m\r\n_sorry_. I\'m _sorry_."\r\n\r\nNot very eloquent, was it? And then, somehow or other, his arm was\r\naround me.\r\n\r\n"Helen," he said. "Will you marry me? I\'m not rich, but I\'ve saved\r\nup enough to live on. We\'ll always have Parnassus, and this winter\r\nwe\'ll go and live in Brooklyn and write the book. And we\'ll travel\r\naround with Peg, and preach the love of books and the love of human\r\nbeings. Helen--you\'re just what I need, God bless you. Will you come\r\nwith me and make me the happiest bookseller in the world?"\r\n\r\nPeg must have been astonished at the length of time she had for\r\ncropping the grass, undisturbed. I know that Roger and I sat\r\ncareless of time. And when he told me that ever since our first\r\nafternoon together he had determined to have me, sooner or later,\r\nI was the proudest woman in New England. I told Roger about the\r\nghastly wreck, and my agony of apprehension. I think it was the\r\nwreck that made us both feel inclined to forgive Andrew.\r\n\r\nWe had a light luncheon together there on the dunes above the Sound.\r\nBy taking a short cut over the ridge we struck into the Shelby road\r\nwithout going down into Port Vigor again. Peg pulled us along toward\r\nGreenbriar, and we talked as we went.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best of it was that a cold drizzle of rain began to fall\r\nas we moved along the hill road. The Professor--as I still call him,\r\nby force of habit--curtained in the front of the van with a rubber\r\nsheet. Bock hopped up and curled himself aginst his master\'s leg.\r\nRoger got out his corncob pipe, and I sat close to him. In the\r\ngathering gloom we plodded along, as happy a trio--or quartet, if\r\nyou include fat, cheery old Peg--as any on this planet. Summer was\r\nover, and we were no longer young, but there were great things\r\nbefore us. I listened to the drip of the rain, and the steady creak\r\nof Parnassus on her axles. I thought of my "anthology" of loaves of\r\nbread and vowed to bake a million more if Roger wanted me to. It was\r\nafter supper time when we got to Greenbriar. Roger had suggested\r\nthat we take a shorter road that would have brought us through to\r\nRedfield sooner, but I begged him to go by way of Shelby and\r\nGreenbriar, just as we had come before. I did not tell him why I\r\nwanted this. And when finally we came to a halt in front of Kirby\'s\r\nstore at the crossroads it was raining heavily and we were ready for\r\na rest.\r\n\r\n"Well, sweetheart," said Roger, "shall we go and see what sort of\r\nrooms the hotel has?"\r\n\r\n"I can think of something better than that," said I. "Let\'s go up to\r\nMr. Kane and have him marry us. Then we can get back to Sabine Farm\r\nafterward, and give Andrew a surprise."\r\n\r\n"By the bones of Hymen!" said Roger. "You\'re right!"\r\n\r\nIt must have been ten o\'clock when we turned in at the red gate\r\nof Sabine Farm. The rain had stopped, but the wheels sloshed\r\nthrough mud and water at every turn. The light was burning in the\r\nsitting-room, and through the window I could see Andrew bent over\r\nhis work table. We climbed out, stiff and sore from the long ride.\r\nI saw Roger\'s face set in a comical blend of sternness and humour.\r\n\r\n"Well, here goes to surprise the Sage!" he whispered.\r\n\r\nWe picked our way between puddles and rapped on the door. Andrew\r\nappeared, carrying the lamp in one hand. When he saw us he grunted.\r\n\r\n"Let me introduce my wife," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll be damned," said Andrew.\r\n\r\nBut Andrew isn\'t quite so black as I\'ve painted him. When he\'s\r\nonce convinced of the error of his ways, he is almost pathetically\r\neager to make up. I remember only one remark in the subsequent\r\nconversation, because I was so appalled by the state of everything\r\nat Sabine Farm that I immediately set about putting the house to\r\nrights. The two men, however, as soon as Parnassus was housed in\r\nthe barn and the animals under cover, sat down by the stove to talk\r\nthings over.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Andrew--"do whatever you like with your\r\nwife; she\'s too much for me. But I\'d like to buy that Parnassus."\r\n\r\n"Not on your life!" said the Professor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Parnassus on Wheels, by Christopher Morley\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PARNASSUS ON WHEELS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 5311.txt or 5311.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/3/1/5311/\r\n\r\nProduced by Andrew Sly\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
