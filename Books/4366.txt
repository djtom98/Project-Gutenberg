Whereas\r\n in general the spirit that removed cometh back upon occasion, and is\r\n sometimes seen of those in flesh (appearing in the form of the body\r\n it bore) yet it hath happened that the veritable body without the\r\n spirit hath walked.  And it is attested of those encountering who\r\n have lived to speak thereon that a lich so raised up hath no natural\r\n affection, nor remembrance thereof, but only hate.  Also, it is known\r\n that some spirits which in life were benign become by death evil\r\n altogether.\xe2\x80\x94_Hali_.\r\n\r\nONE dark night in midsummer a man waking from a dreamless sleep in a\r\nforest lifted his head from the earth, and staring a few moments into the\r\nblackness, said: \xe2\x80\x9cCatherine Larue.\xe2\x80\x9d  He said nothing more; no reason was\r\nknown to him why he should have said so much.\r\n\r\nThe man was Halpin Frayser.  He lived in St. Helena, but where he lives\r\nnow is uncertain, for he is dead.  One who practices sleeping in the\r\nwoods with nothing under him but the dry leaves and the damp earth, and\r\nnothing over him but the branches from which the leaves have fallen and\r\nthe sky from which the earth has fallen, cannot hope for great longevity,\r\nand Frayser had already attained the age of thirty-two.  There are\r\npersons in this world, millions of persons, and far and away the best\r\npersons, who regard that as a very advanced age.  They are the children.\r\nTo those who view the voyage of life from the port of departure the bark\r\nthat has accomplished any considerable distance appears already in close\r\napproach to the farther shore.  However, it is not certain that Halpin\r\nFrayser came to his death by exposure.\r\n\r\nHe had been all day in the hills west of the Napa Valley, looking for\r\ndoves and such small game as was in season.  Late in the afternoon it had\r\ncome on to be cloudy, and he had lost his bearings; and although he had\r\nonly to go always downhill\xe2\x80\x94everywhere the way to safety when one is\r\nlost\xe2\x80\x94the absence of trails had so impeded him that he was overtaken by\r\nnight while still in the forest.  Unable in the darkness to penetrate the\r\nthickets of manzanita and other undergrowth, utterly bewildered and\r\novercome with fatigue, he had lain down near the root of a large madro\xc3\xb1o\r\nand fallen into a dreamless sleep.  It was hours later, in the very\r\nmiddle of the night, that one of God\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious messengers, gliding\r\nahead of the incalculable host of his companions sweeping westward with\r\nthe dawn line, pronounced the awakening word in the ear of the sleeper,\r\nwho sat upright and spoke, he knew not why, a name, he knew not whose.\r\n\r\nHalpin Frayser was not much of a philosopher, nor a scientist.  The\r\ncircumstance that, waking from a deep sleep at night in the midst of a\r\nforest, he had spoken aloud a name that he had not in memory and hardly\r\nhad in mind did not arouse an enlightened curiosity to investigate the\r\nphenomenon.  He thought it odd, and with a little perfunctory shiver, as\r\nif in deference to a seasonal presumption that the night was chill, he\r\nlay down again and went to sleep.  But his sleep was no longer dreamless.\r\n\r\nHe thought he was walking along a dusty road that showed white in the\r\ngathering darkness of a summer night.  Whence and whither it led, and why\r\nhe traveled it, he did not know, though all seemed simple and natural, as\r\nis the way in dreams; for in the Land Beyond the Bed surprises cease from\r\ntroubling and the judgment is at rest.  Soon he came to a parting of the\r\nways; leading from the highway was a road less traveled, having the\r\nappearance, indeed, of having been long abandoned, because, he thought,\r\nit led to something evil; yet he turned into it without hesitation,\r\nimpelled by some imperious necessity.\r\n\r\nAs he pressed forward he became conscious that his way was haunted by\r\ninvisible existences whom he could not definitely figure to his mind.\r\nFrom among the trees on either side he caught broken and incoherent\r\nwhispers in a strange tongue which yet he partly understood.  They seemed\r\nto him fragmentary utterances of a monstrous conspiracy against his body\r\nand soul.\r\n\r\nIt was now long after nightfall, yet the interminable forest through\r\nwhich he journeyed was lit with a wan glimmer having no point of\r\ndiffusion, for in its mysterious lumination nothing cast a shadow.  A\r\nshallow pool in the guttered depression of an old wheel rut, as from a\r\nrecent rain, met his eye with a crimson gleam.  He stooped and plunged\r\nhis hand into it.  It stained his fingers; it was blood!  Blood, he then\r\nobserved, was about him everywhere.  The weeds growing rankly by the\r\nroadside showed it in blots and splashes on their big, broad leaves.\r\nPatches of dry dust between the wheelways were pitted and spattered as\r\nwith a red rain.  Defiling the trunks of the trees were broad maculations\r\nof crimson, and blood dripped like dew from their foliage.\r\n\r\nAll this he observed with a terror which seemed not incompatible with the\r\nfulfillment of a natural expectation.  It seemed to him that it was all\r\nin expiation of some crime which, though conscious of his guilt, he could\r\nnot rightly remember.  To the menaces and mysteries of his surroundings\r\nthe consciousness was an added horror.  Vainly he sought by tracing life\r\nbackward in memory, to reproduce the moment of his sin; scenes and\r\nincidents came crowding tumultuously into his mind, one picture effacing\r\nanother, or commingling with it in confusion and obscurity, but nowhere\r\ncould he catch a glimpse of what he sought.  The failure augmented his\r\nterror; he felt as one who has murdered in the dark, not knowing whom nor\r\nwhy.  So frightful was the situation\xe2\x80\x94the mysterious light burned with so\r\nsilent and awful a menace; the noxious plants, the trees that by common\r\nconsent are invested with a melancholy or baleful character, so openly in\r\nhis sight conspired against his peace; from overhead and all about came\r\nso audible and startling whispers and the sighs of creatures so obviously\r\nnot of earth\xe2\x80\x94that he could endure it no longer, and with a great effort\r\nto break some malign spell that bound his faculties to silence and\r\ninaction, he shouted with the full strength of his lungs!  His voice\r\nbroken, it seemed, into an infinite multitude of unfamiliar sounds, went\r\nbabbling and stammering away into the distant reaches of the forest, died\r\ninto silence, and all was as before.  But he had made a beginning at\r\nresistance and was encouraged.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not submit unheard.  There may be powers that are not malignant\r\ntraveling this accursed road.  I shall leave them a record and an appeal.\r\nI shall relate my wrongs, the persecutions that I endure\xe2\x80\x94I, a helpless\r\nmortal, a penitent, an unoffending poet!\xe2\x80\x9d  Halpin Frayser was a poet only\r\nas he was a penitent: in his dream.\r\n\r\nTaking from his clothing a small red-leather pocketbook, one-half of\r\nwhich was leaved for memoranda, he discovered that he was without a\r\npencil.  He broke a twig from a bush, dipped it into a pool of blood and\r\nwrote rapidly.  He had hardly touched the paper with the point of his\r\ntwig when a low, wild peal of laughter broke out at a measureless\r\ndistance away, and growing ever louder, seemed approaching ever nearer; a\r\nsoulless, heartless, and unjoyous laugh, like that of the loon, solitary\r\nby the lakeside at midnight; a laugh which culminated in an unearthly\r\nshout close at hand, then died away by slow gradations, as if the\r\naccursed being that uttered it had withdrawn over the verge of the world\r\nwhence it had come.  But the man felt that this was not so\xe2\x80\x94that it was\r\nnear by and had not moved.\r\n\r\nA strange sensation began slowly to take possession of his body and his\r\nmind.  He could not have said which, if any, of his senses was affected;\r\nhe felt it rather as a consciousness\xe2\x80\x94a mysterious mental assurance of\r\nsome overpowering presence\xe2\x80\x94some supernatural malevolence different in\r\nkind from the invisible existences that swarmed about him, and superior\r\nto them in power.  He knew that it had uttered that hideous laugh.  And\r\nnow it seemed to be approaching him; from what direction he did not\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94dared not conjecture.  All his former fears were forgotten or merged\r\nin the gigantic terror that now held him in thrall.  Apart from that, he\r\nhad but one thought: to complete his written appeal to the benign powers\r\nwho, traversing the haunted wood, might some time rescue him if he should\r\nbe denied the blessing of annihilation.  He wrote with terrible rapidity,\r\nthe twig in his fingers rilling blood without renewal; but in the middle\r\nof a sentence his hands denied their service to his will, his arms fell\r\nto his sides, the book to the earth; and powerless to move or cry out, he\r\nfound himself staring into the sharply drawn face and blank, dead eyes of\r\nhis own mother, standing white and silent in the garments of the grave!\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIN his youth Halpin Frayser had lived with his parents in Nashville,\r\nTennessee.  The Fraysers were well-to-do, having a good position in such\r\nsociety as had survived the wreck wrought by civil war.  Their children\r\nhad the social and educational opportunities of their time and place, and\r\nhad responded to good associations and instruction with agreeable manners\r\nand cultivated minds.  Halpin being the youngest and not over robust was\r\nperhaps a trifle \xe2\x80\x9cspoiled.\xe2\x80\x9d  He had the double disadvantage of a mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassiduity and a father\xe2\x80\x99s neglect.  Frayser p\xc3\xa8re was what no Southern man\r\nof means is not\xe2\x80\x94a politician.  His country, or rather his section and\r\nState, made demands upon his time and attention so exacting that to those\r\nof his family he was compelled to turn an ear partly deafened by the\r\nthunder of the political captains and the shouting, his own included.\r\n\r\nYoung Halpin was of a dreamy, indolent and rather romantic turn, somewhat\r\nmore addicted to literature than law, the profession to which he was\r\nbred.  Among those of his relations who professed the modern faith of\r\nheredity it was well understood that in him the character of the late\r\nMyron Bayne, a maternal great-grandfather, had revisited the glimpses of\r\nthe moon\xe2\x80\x94by which orb Bayne had in his lifetime been sufficiently\r\naffected to be a poet of no small Colonial distinction.  If not specially\r\nobserved, it was observable that while a Frayser who was not the proud\r\npossessor of a sumptuous copy of the ancestral \xe2\x80\x9cpoetical works\xe2\x80\x9d (printed\r\nat the family expense, and long ago withdrawn from an inhospitable\r\nmarket) was a rare Frayser indeed, there was an illogical indisposition\r\nto honor the great deceased in the person of his spiritual successor.\r\nHalpin was pretty generally deprecated as an intellectual black sheep who\r\nwas likely at any moment to disgrace the flock by bleating in meter.  The\r\nTennessee Fraysers were a practical folk\xe2\x80\x94not practical in the popular\r\nsense of devotion to sordid pursuits, but having a robust contempt for\r\nany qualities unfitting a man for the wholesome vocation of politics.\r\n\r\nIn justice to young Halpin it should be said that while in him were\r\npretty faithfully reproduced most of the mental and moral characteristics\r\nascribed by history and family tradition to the famous Colonial bard, his\r\nsuccession to the gift and faculty divine was purely inferential.  Not\r\nonly had he never been known to court the muse, but in truth he could not\r\nhave written correctly a line of verse to save himself from the Killer of\r\nthe Wise.  Still, there was no knowing when the dormant faculty might\r\nwake and smite the lyre.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the young man was rather a loose fish, anyhow.  Between\r\nhim and his mother was the most perfect sympathy, for secretly the lady\r\nwas herself a devout disciple of the late and great Myron Bayne, though\r\nwith the tact so generally and justly admired in her sex (despite the\r\nhardy calumniators who insist that it is essentially the same thing as\r\ncunning) she had always taken care to conceal her weakness from all eyes\r\nbut those of him who shared it.  Their common guilt in respect of that\r\nwas an added tie between them.  If in Halpin\xe2\x80\x99s youth his mother had\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cspoiled\xe2\x80\x9d him, he had assuredly done his part toward being spoiled.  As\r\nhe grew to such manhood as is attainable by a Southerner who does not\r\ncare which way elections go the attachment between him and his beautiful\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94whom from early childhood he had called Katy\xe2\x80\x94became yearly\r\nstronger and more tender.  In these two romantic natures was manifest in\r\na signal way that neglected phenomenon, the dominance of the sexual\r\nelement in all the relations of life, strengthening, softening, and\r\nbeautifying even those of consanguinity.  The two were nearly\r\ninseparable, and by strangers observing their manner were not\r\ninfrequently mistaken for lovers.\r\n\r\nEntering his mother\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir one day Halpin Frayser kissed her upon the\r\nforehead, toyed for a moment with a lock of her dark hair which had\r\nescaped from its confining pins, and said, with an obvious effort at\r\ncalmness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you greatly mind, Katy, if I were called away to California for a\r\nfew weeks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was hardly needful for Katy to answer with her lips a question to\r\nwhich her telltale cheeks had made instant reply.  Evidently she would\r\ngreatly mind; and the tears, too, sprang into her large brown eyes as\r\ncorroborative testimony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking up into his face with infinite\r\ntenderness, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have known that this was coming.  Did I not lie\r\nawake a half of the night weeping because, during the other half,\r\nGrandfather Bayne had come to me in a dream, and standing by his\r\nportrait\xe2\x80\x94young, too, and handsome as that\xe2\x80\x94pointed to yours on the same\r\nwall?  And when I looked it seemed that I could not see the features; you\r\nhad been painted with a face cloth, such as we put upon the dead.  Your\r\nfather has laughed at me, but you and I, dear, know that such things are\r\nnot for nothing.  And I saw below the edge of the cloth the marks of\r\nhands on your throat\xe2\x80\x94forgive me, but we have not been used to keep such\r\nthings from each other.  Perhaps you have another interpretation.\r\nPerhaps it does not mean that you will go to California.  Or maybe you\r\nwill take me with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that this ingenious interpretation of the dream in\r\nthe light of newly discovered evidence did not wholly commend itself to\r\nthe son\xe2\x80\x99s more logical mind; he had, for the moment at least, a\r\nconviction that it foreshadowed a more simple and immediate, if less\r\ntragic, disaster than a visit to the Pacific Coast.  It was Halpin\r\nFrayser\xe2\x80\x99s impression that he was to be garroted on his native heath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there not medicinal springs in California?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Frayser resumed\r\nbefore he had time to give her the true reading of the dream\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cplaces\r\nwhere one recovers from rheumatism and neuralgia?  Look\xe2\x80\x94my fingers feel\r\nso stiff; and I am almost sure they have been giving me great pain while\r\nI slept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hands for his inspection.  What diagnosis of her case\r\nthe young man may have thought it best to conceal with a smile the\r\nhistorian is unable to state, but for himself he feels bound to say that\r\nfingers looking less stiff, and showing fewer evidences of even\r\ninsensible pain, have seldom been submitted for medical inspection by\r\neven the fairest patient desiring a prescription of unfamiliar scenes.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of it was that of these two odd persons having equally odd\r\nnotions of duty, the one went to California, as the interest of his\r\nclient required, and the other remained at home in compliance with a wish\r\nthat her husband was scarcely conscious of entertaining.\r\n\r\nWhile in San Francisco Halpin Frayser was walking one dark night along\r\nthe water front of the city, when, with a suddenness that surprised and\r\ndisconcerted him, he became a sailor.  He was in fact \xe2\x80\x9cshanghaied\xe2\x80\x9d aboard\r\na gallant, gallant ship, and sailed for a far countree.  Nor did his\r\nmisfortunes end with the voyage; for the ship was cast ashore on an\r\nisland of the South Pacific, and it was six years afterward when the\r\nsurvivors were taken off by a venturesome trading schooner and brought\r\nback to San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThough poor in purse, Frayser was no less proud in spirit than he had\r\nbeen in the years that seemed ages and ages ago.  He would accept no\r\nassistance from strangers, and it was while living with a fellow survivor\r\nnear the town of St. Helena, awaiting news and remittances from home,\r\nthat he had gone gunning and dreaming.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE apparition confronting the dreamer in the haunted wood\xe2\x80\x94the thing so\r\nlike, yet so unlike his mother\xe2\x80\x94was horrible!  It stirred no love nor\r\nlonging in his heart; it came unattended with pleasant memories of a\r\ngolden past\xe2\x80\x94inspired no sentiment of any kind; all the finer emotions\r\nwere swallowed up in fear.  He tried to turn and run from before it, but\r\nhis legs were as lead; he was unable to lift his feet from the ground.\r\nHis arms hung helpless at his sides; of his eyes only he retained\r\ncontrol, and these he dared not remove from the lusterless orbs of the\r\napparition, which he knew was not a soul without a body, but that most\r\ndreadful of all existences infesting that haunted wood\xe2\x80\x94a body without a\r\nsoul!  In its blank stare was neither love, nor pity, nor\r\nintelligence\xe2\x80\x94nothing to which to address an appeal for mercy.  \xe2\x80\x9cAn appeal\r\nwill not lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, with an absurd reversion to professional\r\nslang, making the situation more horrible, as the fire of a cigar might\r\nlight up a tomb.\r\n\r\nFor a time, which seemed so long that the world grew gray with age and\r\nsin, and the haunted forest, having fulfilled its purpose in this\r\nmonstrous culmination of its terrors, vanished out of his consciousness\r\nwith all its sights and sounds, the apparition stood within a pace,\r\nregarding him with the mindless malevolence of a wild brute; then thrust\r\nits hands forward and sprang upon him with appalling ferocity!  The act\r\nreleased his physical energies without unfettering his will; his mind was\r\nstill spellbound, but his powerful body and agile limbs, endowed with a\r\nblind, insensate life of their own, resisted stoutly and well.  For an\r\ninstant he seemed to see this unnatural contest between a dead\r\nintelligence and a breathing mechanism only as a spectator\xe2\x80\x94such fancies\r\nare in dreams; then he regained his identity almost as if by a leap\r\nforward into his body, and the straining automaton had a directing will\r\nas alert and fierce as that of its hideous antagonist.\r\n\r\nBut what mortal can cope with a creature of his dream?  The imagination\r\ncreating the enemy is already vanquished; the combat\xe2\x80\x99s result is the\r\ncombat\xe2\x80\x99s cause.  Despite his struggles\xe2\x80\x94despite his strength and activity,\r\nwhich seemed wasted in a void, he felt the cold fingers close upon his\r\nthroat.  Borne backward to the earth, he saw above him the dead and drawn\r\nface within a hand\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of his own, and then all was black.  A sound\r\nas of the beating of distant drums\xe2\x80\x94a murmur of swarming voices, a sharp,\r\nfar cry signing all to silence, and Halpin Frayser dreamed that he was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nA WARM, clear night had been followed by a morning of drenching fog.  At\r\nabout the middle of the afternoon of the preceding day a little whiff of\r\nlight vapor\xe2\x80\x94a mere thickening of the atmosphere, the ghost of a cloud\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nbeen observed clinging to the western side of Mount St. Helena, away up\r\nalong the barren altitudes near the summit.  It was so thin, so\r\ndiaphanous, so like a fancy made visible, that one would have said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\nquickly! in a moment it will be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment it was visibly larger and denser.  While with one edge it\r\nclung to the mountain, with the other it reached farther and farther out\r\ninto the air above the lower slopes.  At the same time it extended itself\r\nto north and south, joining small patches of mist that appeared to come\r\nout of the mountainside on exactly the same level, with an intelligent\r\ndesign to be absorbed.  And so it grew and grew until the summit was shut\r\nout of view from the valley, and over the valley itself was an\r\never-extending canopy, opaque and gray.  At Calistoga, which lies near\r\nthe head of the valley and the foot of the mountain, there were a\r\nstarless night and a sunless morning.  The fog, sinking into the valley,\r\nhad reached southward, swallowing up ranch after ranch, until it had\r\nblotted out the town of St. Helena, nine miles away.  The dust in the\r\nroad was laid; trees were adrip with moisture; birds sat silent in their\r\ncoverts; the morning light was wan and ghastly, with neither color nor\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nTwo men left the town of St. Helena at the first glimmer of dawn, and\r\nwalked along the road northward up the valley toward Calistoga.  They\r\ncarried guns on their shoulders, yet no one having knowledge of such\r\nmatters could have mistaken them for hunters of bird or beast.  They were\r\na deputy sheriff from Napa and a detective from San Francisco\xe2\x80\x94Holker and\r\nJaralson, respectively.  Their business was man-hunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far is it?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Holker, as they strode along, their feet\r\nstirring white the dust beneath the damp surface of the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe White Church?  Only a half mile farther,\xe2\x80\x9d the other answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\nthe way,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cit is neither white nor a church; it is an abandoned\r\nschoolhouse, gray with age and neglect.  Religious services were once\r\nheld in it\xe2\x80\x94when it was white, and there is a graveyard that would delight\r\na poet.  Can you guess why I sent for you, and told you to come heeled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I never have bothered you about things of that kind.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve always\r\nfound you communicative when the time came.  But if I may hazard a guess,\r\nyou want me to help you arrest one of the corpses in the graveyard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember Branscom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jaralson, treating his companion\xe2\x80\x99s wit with\r\nthe inattention that it deserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chap who cut his wife\xe2\x80\x99s throat?  I ought; I wasted a week\xe2\x80\x99s work on\r\nhim and had my expenses for my trouble.  There is a reward of five\r\nhundred dollars, but none of us ever got a sight of him.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nto say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do.  He has been under the noses of you fellows all the time.  He\r\ncomes by night to the old graveyard at the White Church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!  That\xe2\x80\x99s where they buried his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you fellows might have had sense enough to suspect that he would\r\nreturn to her grave some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very last place that anyone would have expected him to return to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you had exhausted all the other places.  Learning your failure at\r\nthem, I \xe2\x80\x98laid for him\xe2\x80\x99 there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you found him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it! he found _me_.  The rascal got the drop on me\xe2\x80\x94regularly held me\r\nup and made me travel.  It\xe2\x80\x99s God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go through me.\r\nOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a good one, and I fancy the half of that reward is enough for me\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99re needy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolker laughed good humoredly, and explained that his creditors were\r\nnever more importunate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted merely to show you the ground, and arrange a plan with you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe detective explained.  \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it as well for us to be heeled, even\r\nin daylight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man must be insane,\xe2\x80\x9d said the deputy sheriff.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe reward is for\r\nhis capture and conviction.  If he\xe2\x80\x99s mad he won\xe2\x80\x99t be convicted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Holker was so profoundly affected by that possible failure of justice\r\nthat he involuntarily stopped in the middle of the road, then resumed his\r\nwalk with abated zeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he looks it,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Jaralson.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bound to admit that a more\r\nunshaven, unshorn, unkempt, and uneverything wretch I never saw outside\r\nthe ancient and honorable order of tramps.  But I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone in for him, and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t make up my mind to let go.  There\xe2\x80\x99s glory in it for us, anyhow.\r\nNot another soul knows that he is this side of the Mountains of the\r\nMoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Holker said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will go and view the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d and he added,\r\nin the words of a once favorite inscription for tombstones: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98where you\r\nmust shortly lie\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I mean, if old Branscom ever gets tired of you and your\r\nimpertinent intrusion.  By the way, I heard the other day that \xe2\x80\x98Branscom\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwas not his real name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t recall it.  I had lost all interest in the wretch, and it did\r\nnot fix itself in my memory\xe2\x80\x94something like Pardee.  The woman whose\r\nthroat he had the bad taste to cut was a widow when he met her.  She had\r\ncome to California to look up some relatives\xe2\x80\x94there are persons who will\r\ndo that sometimes.  But you know all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not knowing the right name, by what happy inspiration did you find\r\nthe right grave?  The man who told me what the name was said it had been\r\ncut on the headboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know the right grave.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jaralson was apparently a trifle\r\nreluctant to admit his ignorance of so important a point of his plan.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave been watching about the place generally.  A part of our work this\r\nmorning will be to identify that grave.  Here is the White Church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a long distance the road had been bordered by fields on both sides,\r\nbut now on the left there was a forest of oaks, madro\xc3\xb1os, and gigantic\r\nspruces whose lower parts only could be seen, dim and ghostly in the fog.\r\nThe undergrowth was, in places, thick, but nowhere impenetrable.  For\r\nsome moments Holker saw nothing of the building, but as they turned into\r\nthe woods it revealed itself in faint gray outline through the fog,\r\nlooking huge and far away.  A few steps more, and it was within an arm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlength, distinct, dark with moisture, and insignificant in size.  It had\r\nthe usual country-schoolhouse form\xe2\x80\x94belonged to the packing-box order of\r\narchitecture; had an underpinning of stones, a moss-grown roof, and blank\r\nwindow spaces, whence both glass and sash had long departed.  It was\r\nruined, but not a ruin\xe2\x80\x94a typical Californian substitute for what are\r\nknown to guide-bookers abroad as \xe2\x80\x9cmonuments of the past.\xe2\x80\x9d  With scarcely\r\na glance at this uninteresting structure Jaralson moved on into the\r\ndripping undergrowth beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will show you where he held me up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the graveyard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere and there among the bushes were small inclosures containing graves,\r\nsometimes no more than one.  They were recognized as graves by the\r\ndiscolored stones or rotting boards at head and foot, leaning at all\r\nangles, some prostrate; by the ruined picket fences surrounding them; or,\r\ninfrequently, by the mound itself showing its gravel through the fallen\r\nleaves.  In many instances nothing marked the spot where lay the vestiges\r\nof some poor mortal\xe2\x80\x94who, leaving \xe2\x80\x9ca large circle of sorrowing friends,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhad been left by them in turn\xe2\x80\x94except a depression in the earth, more\r\nlasting than that in the spirits of the mourners.  The paths, if any\r\npaths had been, were long obliterated; trees of a considerable size had\r\nbeen permitted to grow up from the graves and thrust aside with root or\r\nbranch the inclosing fences.  Over all was that air of abandonment and\r\ndecay which seems nowhere so fit and significant as in a village of the\r\nforgotten dead.\r\n\r\nAs the two men, Jaralson leading, pushed their way through the growth of\r\nyoung trees, that enterprising man suddenly stopped and brought up his\r\nshotgun to the height of his breast, uttered a low note of warning, and\r\nstood motionless, his eyes fixed upon something ahead.  As well as he\r\ncould, obstructed by brush, his companion, though seeing nothing,\r\nimitated the posture and so stood, prepared for what might ensue.  A\r\nmoment later Jaralson moved cautiously forward, the other following.\r\n\r\nUnder the branches of an enormous spruce lay the dead body of a man.\r\nStanding silent above it they noted such particulars as first strike the\r\nattention\xe2\x80\x94the face, the attitude, the clothing; whatever most promptly\r\nand plainly answers the unspoken question of a sympathetic curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe body lay upon its back, the legs wide apart.  One arm was thrust\r\nupward, the other outward; but the latter was bent acutely, and the hand\r\nwas near the throat.  Both hands were tightly clenched.  The whole\r\nattitude was that of desperate but ineffectual resistance to\xe2\x80\x94what?\r\n\r\nNear by lay a shotgun and a game bag through the meshes of which was seen\r\nthe plumage of shot birds.  All about were evidences of a furious\r\nstruggle; small sprouts of poison-oak were bent and denuded of leaf and\r\nbark; dead and rotting leaves had been pushed into heaps and ridges on\r\nboth sides of the legs by the action of other feet than theirs; alongside\r\nthe hips were unmistakable impressions of human knees.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the struggle was made clear by a glance at the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthroat and face.  While breast and hands were white, those were\r\npurple\xe2\x80\x94almost black.  The shoulders lay upon a low mound, and the head\r\nwas turned back at an angle otherwise impossible, the expanded eyes\r\nstaring blankly backward in a direction opposite to that of the feet.\r\nFrom the froth filling the open mouth the tongue protruded, black and\r\nswollen.  The throat showed horrible contusions; not mere finger-marks,\r\nbut bruises and lacerations wrought by two strong hands that must have\r\nburied themselves in the yielding flesh, maintaining their terrible grasp\r\nuntil long after death.  Breast, throat, face, were wet; the clothing was\r\nsaturated; drops of water, condensed from the fog, studded the hair and\r\nmustache.\r\n\r\nAll this the two men observed without speaking\xe2\x80\x94almost at a glance.  Then\r\nHolker said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor devil! he had a rough deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJaralson was making a vigilant circumspection of the forest, his shotgun\r\nheld in both hands and at full cock, his finger upon the trigger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe work of a maniac,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without withdrawing his eyes from the\r\ninclosing wood.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was done by Branscom\xe2\x80\x94Pardee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething half hidden by the disturbed leaves on the earth caught\r\nHolker\xe2\x80\x99s attention.  It was a red-leather pocketbook.  He picked it up\r\nand opened it.  It contained leaves of white paper for memoranda, and\r\nupon the first leaf was the name \xe2\x80\x9cHalpin Frayser.\xe2\x80\x9d  Written in red on\r\nseveral succeeding leaves\xe2\x80\x94scrawled as if in haste and barely legible\xe2\x80\x94were\r\nthe following lines, which Holker read aloud, while his companion\r\ncontinued scanning the dim gray confines of their narrow world and\r\nhearing matter of apprehension in the drip of water from every burdened\r\nbranch:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cEnthralled by some mysterious spell, I stood\r\n    In the lit gloom of an enchanted wood.\r\n       The cypress there and myrtle twined their boughs,\r\n    Significant, in baleful brotherhood.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe brooding willow whispered to the yew;\r\n    Beneath, the deadly nightshade and the rue,\r\n       With immortelles self-woven into strange\r\n    Funereal shapes, and horrid nettles grew.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNo song of bird nor any drone of bees,\r\n    Nor light leaf lifted by the wholesome breeze:\r\n       The air was stagnant all, and Silence was\r\n    A living thing that breathed among the trees.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cConspiring spirits whispered in the gloom,\r\n    Half-heard, the stilly secrets of the tomb.\r\n       With blood the trees were all adrip; the leaves\r\n    Shone in the witch-light with a ruddy bloom.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI cried aloud!\xe2\x80\x94the spell, unbroken still,\r\n    Rested upon my spirit and my will.\r\n       Unsouled, unhearted, hopeless and forlorn,\r\n    I strove with monstrous presages of ill!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAt last the viewless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolker ceased reading; there was no more to read.  The manuscript broke\r\noff in the middle of a line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds like Bayne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jaralson, who was something of a scholar\r\nin his way.  He had abated his vigilance and stood looking down at the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s Bayne?\xe2\x80\x9d Holker asked rather incuriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMyron Bayne, a chap who flourished in the early years of the nation\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nthan a century ago.  Wrote mighty dismal stuff; I have his collected\r\nworks.  That poem is not among them, but it must have been omitted by\r\nmistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is cold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Holker; \xe2\x80\x9clet us leave here; we must have up the\r\ncoroner from Napa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJaralson said nothing, but made a movement in compliance.  Passing the\r\nend of the slight elevation of earth upon which the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s head and\r\nshoulders lay, his foot struck some hard substance under the rotting\r\nforest leaves, and he took the trouble to kick it into view.  It was a\r\nfallen headboard, and painted on it were the hardly decipherable words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatharine Larue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLarue, Larue!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Holker, with sudden animation.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that is\r\nthe real name of Branscom\xe2\x80\x94not Pardee.  And\xe2\x80\x94bless my soul! how it all\r\ncomes to me\xe2\x80\x94the murdered woman\xe2\x80\x99s name had been Frayser!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some rascally mystery here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Detective Jaralson.  \xe2\x80\x9cI hate\r\nanything of that kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere came to them out of the fog\xe2\x80\x94seemingly from a great distance\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsound of a laugh, a low, deliberate, soulless laugh, which had no more of\r\njoy than that of a hyena night-prowling in the desert; a laugh that rose\r\nby slow gradation, louder and louder, clearer, more distinct and\r\nterrible, until it seemed barely outside the narrow circle of their\r\nvision; a laugh so unnatural, so unhuman, so devilish, that it filled\r\nthose hardy man-hunters with a sense of dread unspeakable!  They did not\r\nmove their weapons nor think of them; the menace of that horrible sound\r\nwas not of the kind to be met with arms.  As it had grown out of silence,\r\nso now it died away; from a culminating shout which had seemed almost in\r\ntheir ears, it drew itself away into the distance, until its failing\r\nnotes, joyless and mechanical to the last, sank to silence at a\r\nmeasureless remove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF MACARGER\xe2\x80\x99S GULCH\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHWESTWARDLY from Indian Hill, about nine miles as the crow flies, is\r\nMacarger\xe2\x80\x99s Gulch.  It is not much of a gulch\xe2\x80\x94a mere depression between\r\ntwo wooded ridges of inconsiderable height.  From its mouth up to its\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94for gulches, like rivers, have an anatomy of their own\xe2\x80\x94the distance\r\ndoes not exceed two miles, and the width at bottom is at only one place\r\nmore than a dozen yards; for most of the distance on either side of the\r\nlittle brook which drains it in winter, and goes dry in the early spring,\r\nthere is no level ground at all; the steep slopes of the hills, covered\r\nwith an almost impenetrable growth of manzanita and chemisal, are parted\r\nby nothing but the width of the water course.  No one but an occasional\r\nenterprising hunter of the vicinity ever goes into Macarger\xe2\x80\x99s Gulch, and\r\nfive miles away it is unknown, even by name.  Within that distance in any\r\ndirection are far more conspicuous topographical features without names,\r\nand one might try in vain to ascertain by local inquiry the origin of the\r\nname of this one.\r\n\r\nAbout midway between the head and the mouth of Macarger\xe2\x80\x99s Gulch, the hill\r\non the right as you ascend is cloven by another gulch, a short dry one,\r\nand at the junction of the two is a level space of two or three acres,\r\nand there a few years ago stood an old board house containing one small\r\nroom.  How the component parts of the house, few and simple as they were,\r\nhad been assembled at that almost inaccessible point is a problem in the\r\nsolution of which there would be greater satisfaction than advantage.\r\nPossibly the creek bed is a reformed road.  It is certain that the gulch\r\nwas at one time pretty thoroughly prospected by miners, who must have had\r\nsome means of getting in with at least pack animals carrying tools and\r\nsupplies; their profits, apparently, were not such as would have\r\njustified any considerable outlay to connect Macarger\xe2\x80\x99s Gulch with any\r\ncenter of civilization enjoying the distinction of a sawmill.  The house,\r\nhowever, was there, most of it.  It lacked a door and a window frame, and\r\nthe chimney of mud and stones had fallen into an unlovely heap, overgrown\r\nwith rank weeds.  Such humble furniture as there may once have been and\r\nmuch of the lower weatherboarding, had served as fuel in the camp fires\r\nof hunters; as had also, probably, the curbing of an old well, which at\r\nthe time I write of existed in the form of a rather wide but not very\r\ndeep depression near by.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in the summer of 1874, I passed up Macarger\xe2\x80\x99s Gulch from\r\nthe narrow valley into which it opens, by following the dry bed of the\r\nbrook.  I was quail-shooting and had made a bag of about a dozen birds by\r\nthe time I had reached the house described, of whose existence I was\r\nuntil then unaware.  After rather carelessly inspecting the ruin I\r\nresumed my sport, and having fairly good success prolonged it until near\r\nsunset, when it occurred to me that I was a long way from any human\r\nhabitation\xe2\x80\x94too far to reach one by nightfall.  But in my game bag was\r\nfood, and the old house would afford shelter, if shelter were needed on a\r\nwarm and dewless night in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, where one\r\nmay sleep in comfort on the pine needles, without covering.  I am fond of\r\nsolitude and love the night, so my resolution to \xe2\x80\x9ccamp out\xe2\x80\x9d was soon\r\ntaken, and by the time that it was dark I had made my bed of boughs and\r\ngrasses in a corner of the room and was roasting a quail at a fire that I\r\nhad kindled on the hearth.  The smoke escaped out of the ruined chimney,\r\nthe light illuminated the room with a kindly glow, and as I ate my simple\r\nmeal of plain bird and drank the remains of a bottle of red wine which\r\nhad served me all the afternoon in place of the water, which the region\r\ndid not supply, I experienced a sense of comfort which better fare and\r\naccommodations do not always give.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was something lacking.  I had a sense of comfort, but\r\nnot of security.  I detected myself staring more frequently at the open\r\ndoorway and blank window than I could find warrant for doing.  Outside\r\nthese apertures all was black, and I was unable to repress a certain\r\nfeeling of apprehension as my fancy pictured the outer world and filled\r\nit with unfriendly entities, natural and supernatural\xe2\x80\x94chief among which,\r\nin their respective classes, were the grizzly bear, which I knew was\r\noccasionally still seen in that region, and the ghost, which I had reason\r\nto think was not.  Unfortunately, our feelings do not always respect the\r\nlaw of probabilities, and to me that evening, the possible and the\r\nimpossible were equally disquieting.\r\n\r\nEveryone who has had experience in the matter must have observed that one\r\nconfronts the actual and imaginary perils of the night with far less\r\napprehension in the open air than in a house with an open doorway.  I\r\nfelt this now as I lay on my leafy couch in a corner of the room next to\r\nthe chimney and permitted my fire to die out.  So strong became my sense\r\nof the presence of something malign and menacing in the place, that I\r\nfound myself almost unable to withdraw my eyes from the opening, as in\r\nthe deepening darkness it became more and more indistinct.  And when the\r\nlast little flame flickered and went out I grasped the shotgun which I\r\nhad laid at my side and actually turned the muzzle in the direction of\r\nthe now invisible entrance, my thumb on one of the hammers, ready to cock\r\nthe piece, my breath suspended, my muscles rigid and tense.  But later I\r\nlaid down the weapon with a sense of shame and mortification.  What did I\r\nfear, and why?\xe2\x80\x94I, to whom the night had been\r\n\r\n                   a more familiar face\r\n    Than that of man\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI, in whom that element of hereditary superstition from which none of us\r\nis altogether free had given to solitude and darkness and silence only a\r\nmore alluring interest and charm!  I was unable to comprehend my folly,\r\nand losing in the conjecture the thing conjectured of, I fell asleep.\r\nAnd then I dreamed.\r\n\r\nI was in a great city in a foreign land\xe2\x80\x94a city whose people were of my\r\nown race, with minor differences of speech and costume; yet precisely\r\nwhat these were I could not say; my sense of them was indistinct.  The\r\ncity was dominated by a great castle upon an overlooking height whose\r\nname I knew, but could not speak.  I walked through many streets, some\r\nbroad and straight with high, modern buildings, some narrow, gloomy, and\r\ntortuous, between the gables of quaint old houses whose overhanging\r\nstories, elaborately ornamented with carvings in wood and stone, almost\r\nmet above my head.\r\n\r\nI sought someone whom I had never seen, yet knew that I should recognize\r\nwhen found.  My quest was not aimless and fortuitous; it had a definite\r\nmethod.  I turned from one street into another without hesitation and\r\nthreaded a maze of intricate passages, devoid of the fear of losing my\r\nway.\r\n\r\nPresently I stopped before a low door in a plain stone house which might\r\nhave been the dwelling of an artisan of the better sort, and without\r\nannouncing myself, entered.  The room, rather sparely furnished, and\r\nlighted by a single window with small diamond-shaped panes, had but two\r\noccupants; a man and a woman.  They took no notice of my intrusion, a\r\ncircumstance which, in the manner of dreams, appeared entirely natural.\r\nThey were not conversing; they sat apart, unoccupied and sullen.\r\n\r\nThe woman was young and rather stout, with fine large eyes and a certain\r\ngrave beauty; my memory of her expression is exceedingly vivid, but in\r\ndreams one does not observe the details of faces.  About her shoulders\r\nwas a plaid shawl.  The man was older, dark, with an evil face made more\r\nforbidding by a long scar extending from near the left temple diagonally\r\ndownward into the black mustache; though in my dreams it seemed rather to\r\nhaunt the face as a thing apart\xe2\x80\x94I can express it no otherwise\xe2\x80\x94than to\r\nbelong to it.  The moment that I found the man and woman I knew them to\r\nbe husband and wife.\r\n\r\nWhat followed, I remember indistinctly; all was confused and\r\ninconsistent\xe2\x80\x94made so, I think, by gleams of consciousness.  It was as if\r\ntwo pictures, the scene of my dream, and my actual surroundings, had been\r\nblended, one overlying the other, until the former, gradually fading,\r\ndisappeared, and I was broad awake in the deserted cabin, entirely and\r\ntranquilly conscious of my situation.\r\n\r\nMy foolish fear was gone, and opening my eyes I saw that my fire, not\r\naltogether burned out, had revived by the falling of a stick and was\r\nagain lighting the room.  I had probably slept only a few minutes, but my\r\ncommonplace dream had somehow so strongly impressed me that I was no\r\nlonger drowsy; and after a little while I rose, pushed the embers of my\r\nfire together, and lighting my pipe proceeded in a rather ludicrously\r\nmethodical way to meditate upon my vision.\r\n\r\nIt would have puzzled me then to say in what respect it was worth\r\nattention.  In the first moment of serious thought that I gave to the\r\nmatter I recognized the city of my dream as Edinburgh, where I had never\r\nbeen; so if the dream was a memory it was a memory of pictures and\r\ndescription.  The recognition somehow deeply impressed me; it was as if\r\nsomething in my mind insisted rebelliously against will and reason on the\r\nimportance of all this.  And that faculty, whatever it was, asserted also\r\na control of my speech.  \xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d I said aloud, quite involuntarily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe MacGregors must have come here from Edinburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the moment, neither the substance of this remark nor the fact of my\r\nmaking it, surprised me in the least; it seemed entirely natural that I\r\nshould know the name of my dreamfolk and something of their history.  But\r\nthe absurdity of it all soon dawned upon me: I laughed aloud, knocked the\r\nashes from my pipe and again stretched myself upon my bed of boughs and\r\ngrass, where I lay staring absently into my failing fire, with no further\r\nthought of either my dream or my surroundings.  Suddenly the single\r\nremaining flame crouched for a moment, then, springing upward, lifted\r\nitself clear of its embers and expired in air.  The darkness was\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\nAt that instant\xe2\x80\x94almost, it seemed, before the gleam of the blaze had\r\nfaded from my eyes\xe2\x80\x94there was a dull, dead sound, as of some heavy body\r\nfalling upon the floor, which shook beneath me as I lay.  I sprang to a\r\nsitting posture and groped at my side for my gun; my notion was that some\r\nwild beast had leaped in through the open window.  While the flimsy\r\nstructure was still shaking from the impact I heard the sound of blows,\r\nthe scuffling of feet upon the floor, and then\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to come from\r\nalmost within reach of my hand, the sharp shrieking of a woman in mortal\r\nagony.  So horrible a cry I had never heard nor conceived; it utterly\r\nunnerved me; I was conscious for a moment of nothing but my own terror!\r\nFortunately my hand now found the weapon of which it was in search, and\r\nthe familiar touch somewhat restored me.  I leaped to my feet, straining\r\nmy eyes to pierce the darkness.  The violent sounds had ceased, but more\r\nterrible than these, I heard, at what seemed long intervals, the faint\r\nintermittent gasping of some living, dying thing!\r\n\r\nAs my eyes grew accustomed to the dim light of the coals in the\r\nfireplace, I saw first the shapes of the door and window, looking blacker\r\nthan the black of the walls.  Next, the distinction between wall and\r\nfloor became discernible, and at last I was sensible to the form and full\r\nexpanse of the floor from end to end and side to side.  Nothing was\r\nvisible and the silence was unbroken.\r\n\r\nWith a hand that shook a little, the other still grasping my gun, I\r\nrestored my fire and made a critical examination of the place.  There was\r\nnowhere any sign that the cabin had been entered.  My own tracks were\r\nvisible in the dust covering the floor, but there were no others.  I\r\nrelit my pipe, provided fresh fuel by ripping a thin board or two from\r\nthe inside of the house\xe2\x80\x94I did not care to go into the darkness out of\r\ndoors\xe2\x80\x94and passed the rest of the night smoking and thinking, and feeding\r\nmy fire; not for added years of life would I have permitted that little\r\nflame to expire again.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nSome years afterward I met in Sacramento a man named Morgan, to whom I\r\nhad a note of introduction from a friend in San Francisco.  Dining with\r\nhim one evening at his home I observed various \xe2\x80\x9ctrophies\xe2\x80\x9d upon the wall,\r\nindicating that he was fond of shooting.  It turned out that he was, and\r\nin relating some of his feats he mentioned having been in the region of\r\nmy adventure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Morgan,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know a place up there called\r\nMacarger\xe2\x80\x99s Gulch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have good reason to,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cit was I who gave to the\r\nnewspapers, last year, the accounts of the finding of the skeleton\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had not heard of it; the accounts had been published, it appeared,\r\nwhile I was absent in the East.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morgan, \xe2\x80\x9cthe name of the gulch is a corruption; it\r\nshould have been called \xe2\x80\x98MacGregor\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99  My dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, speaking to\r\nhis wife, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Elderson has upset his wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was hardly accurate\xe2\x80\x94I had simply dropped it, glass and all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was an old shanty once in the gulch,\xe2\x80\x9d Morgan resumed when the ruin\r\nwrought by my awkwardness had been repaired, \xe2\x80\x9cbut just previously to my\r\nvisit it had been blown down, or rather blown away, for its _d\xc3\xa9bris_ was\r\nscattered all about, the very floor being parted, plank from plank.\r\nBetween two of the sleepers still in position I and my companion observed\r\nthe remnant of a plaid shawl, and examining it found that it was wrapped\r\nabout the shoulders of the body of a woman, of which but little remained\r\nbesides the bones, partly covered with fragments of clothing, and brown\r\ndry skin.  But we will spare Mrs. Morgan,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with a smile.  The\r\nlady had indeed exhibited signs of disgust rather than sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary to say, however,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the skull was\r\nfractured in several places, as by blows of some blunt instrument; and\r\nthat instrument itself\xe2\x80\x94a pick-handle, still stained with blood\xe2\x80\x94lay under\r\nthe boards near by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan turned to his wife.  \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with\r\naffected solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cfor mentioning these disagreeable particulars, the\r\nnatural though regrettable incidents of a conjugal quarrel\xe2\x80\x94resulting,\r\ndoubtless, from the luckless wife\xe2\x80\x99s insubordination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to be able to overlook it,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady replied with composure;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou have so many times asked me to in those very words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought he seemed rather glad to go on with his story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom these and other circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe coroner\xe2\x80\x99s jury found\r\nthat the deceased, Janet MacGregor, came to her death from blows\r\ninflicted by some person to the jury unknown; but it was added that the\r\nevidence pointed strongly to her husband, Thomas MacGregor, as the guilty\r\nperson.  But Thomas MacGregor has never been found nor heard of.  It was\r\nlearned that the couple came from Edinburgh, but not\xe2\x80\x94my dear, do you not\r\nobserve that Mr. Elderson\xe2\x80\x99s boneplate has water in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had deposited a chicken bone in my finger bowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a little cupboard I found a photograph of MacGregor, but it did not\r\nlead to his capture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me see it?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nThe picture showed a dark man with an evil face made more forbidding by a\r\nlong scar extending from near the temple diagonally downward into the\r\nblack mustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Mr. Elderson,\xe2\x80\x9d said my affable host, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I know why you\r\nasked about \xe2\x80\x98Macarger\xe2\x80\x99s Gulch\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lost a mule near there once,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand the mischance has\xe2\x80\x94has\r\nquite\xe2\x80\x94upset me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Morgan, with the mechanical intonation of an\r\ninterpreter translating, \xe2\x80\x9cthe loss of Mr. Elderson\xe2\x80\x99s mule has peppered\r\nhis coffee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE SUMMER NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE fact that Henry Armstrong was buried did not seem to him to prove\r\nthat he was dead: he had always been a hard man to convince.  That he\r\nreally was buried, the testimony of his senses compelled him to admit.\r\nHis posture\xe2\x80\x94flat upon his back, with his hands crossed upon his stomach\r\nand tied with something that he easily broke without profitably altering\r\nthe situation\xe2\x80\x94the strict confinement of his entire person, the black\r\ndarkness and profound silence, made a body of evidence impossible to\r\ncontrovert and he accepted it without cavil.\r\n\r\nBut dead\xe2\x80\x94no; he was only very, very ill.  He had, withal, the invalid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napathy and did not greatly concern himself about the uncommon fate that\r\nhad been allotted to him.  No philosopher was he\xe2\x80\x94just a plain,\r\ncommonplace person gifted, for the time being, with a pathological\r\nindifference: the organ that he feared consequences with was torpid.  So,\r\nwith no particular apprehension for his immediate future, he fell asleep\r\nand all was peace with Henry Armstrong.\r\n\r\nBut something was going on overhead.  It was a dark summer night, shot\r\nthrough with infrequent shimmers of lightning silently firing a cloud\r\nlying low in the west and portending a storm.  These brief, stammering\r\nilluminations brought out with ghastly distinctness the monuments and\r\nheadstones of the cemetery and seemed to set them dancing.  It was not a\r\nnight in which any credible witness was likely to be straying about a\r\ncemetery, so the three men who were there, digging into the grave of\r\nHenry Armstrong, felt reasonably secure.\r\n\r\nTwo of them were young students from a medical college a few miles away;\r\nthe third was a gigantic negro known as Jess.  For many years Jess had\r\nbeen employed about the cemetery as a man-of-all-work and it was his\r\nfavorite pleasantry that he knew \xe2\x80\x9cevery soul in the place.\xe2\x80\x9d  From the\r\nnature of what he was now doing it was inferable that the place was not\r\nso populous as its register may have shown it to be.\r\n\r\nOutside the wall, at the part of the grounds farthest from the public\r\nroad, were a horse and a light wagon, waiting.\r\n\r\nThe work of excavation was not difficult: the earth with which the grave\r\nhad been loosely filled a few hours before offered little resistance and\r\nwas soon thrown out.  Removal of the casket from its box was less easy,\r\nbut it was taken out, for it was a perquisite of Jess, who carefully\r\nunscrewed the cover and laid it aside, exposing the body in black\r\ntrousers and white shirt.  At that instant the air sprang to flame, a\r\ncracking shock of thunder shook the stunned world and Henry Armstrong\r\ntranquilly sat up.  With inarticulate cries the men fled in terror, each\r\nin a different direction.  For nothing on earth could two of them have\r\nbeen persuaded to return.  But Jess was of another breed.\r\n\r\nIn the gray of the morning the two students, pallid and haggard from\r\nanxiety and with the terror of their adventure still beating tumultuously\r\nin their blood, met at the medical college.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod! yes\xe2\x80\x94what are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went around to the rear of the building, where they saw a horse,\r\nattached to a light wagon, hitched to a gatepost near the door of the\r\ndissecting-room.  Mechanically they entered the room.  On a bench in the\r\nobscurity sat the negro Jess.  He rose, grinning, all eyes and teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m waiting for my pay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nStretched naked on a long table lay the body of Henry Armstrong, the head\r\ndefiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOONLIT ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nSTATEMENT OF JOEL HETMAN, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI AM the most unfortunate of men.  Rich, respected, fairly well educated\r\nand of sound health\xe2\x80\x94with many other advantages usually valued by those\r\nhaving them and coveted by those who have them not\xe2\x80\x94I sometimes think that\r\nI should be less unhappy if they had been denied me, for then the\r\ncontrast between my outer and my inner life would not be continually\r\ndemanding a painful attention.  In the stress of privation and the need\r\nof effort I might sometimes forget the somber secret ever baffling the\r\nconjecture that it compels.\r\n\r\nI am the only child of Joel and Julia Hetman.  The one was a well-to-do\r\ncountry gentleman, the other a beautiful and accomplished woman to whom\r\nhe was passionately attached with what I now know to have been a jealous\r\nand exacting devotion.  The family home was a few miles from Nashville,\r\nTennessee, a large, irregularly built dwelling of no particular order of\r\narchitecture, a little way off the road, in a park of trees and\r\nshrubbery.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I write I was nineteen years old, a student at Yale.\r\nOne day I received a telegram from my father of such urgency that in\r\ncompliance with its unexplained demand I left at once for home.  At the\r\nrailway station in Nashville a distant relative awaited me to apprise me\r\nof the reason for my recall: my mother had been barbarously murdered\xe2\x80\x94why\r\nand by whom none could conjecture, but the circumstances were these: My\r\nfather had gone to Nashville, intending to return the next afternoon.\r\nSomething prevented his accomplishing the business in hand, so he\r\nreturned on the same night, arriving just before the dawn.  In his\r\ntestimony before the coroner he explained that having no latchkey and not\r\ncaring to disturb the sleeping servants, he had, with no clearly defined\r\nintention, gone round to the rear of the house.  As he turned an angle of\r\nthe building, he heard a sound as of a door gently closed, and saw in the\r\ndarkness, indistinctly, the figure of a man, which instantly disappeared\r\namong the trees of the lawn.  A hasty pursuit and brief search of the\r\ngrounds in the belief that the trespasser was some one secretly visiting\r\na servant proving fruitless, he entered at the unlocked door and mounted\r\nthe stairs to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s chamber.  Its door was open, and stepping into\r\nblack darkness he fell headlong over some heavy object on the floor.  I\r\nmay spare myself the details; it was my poor mother, dead of\r\nstrangulation by human hands!\r\n\r\nNothing had been taken from the house, the servants had heard no sound,\r\nand excepting those terrible finger-marks upon the dead woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthroat\xe2\x80\x94dear God! that I might forget them!\xe2\x80\x94no trace of the assassin was\r\never found.\r\n\r\nI gave up my studies and remained with my father, who, naturally, was\r\ngreatly changed.  Always of a sedate, taciturn disposition, he now fell\r\ninto so deep a dejection that nothing could hold his attention, yet\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94a footfall, the sudden closing of a door\xe2\x80\x94aroused in him a fitful\r\ninterest; one might have called it an apprehension.  At any small\r\nsurprise of the senses he would start visibly and sometimes turn pale,\r\nthen relapse into a melancholy apathy deeper than before.  I suppose he\r\nwas what is called a \xe2\x80\x9cnervous wreck.\xe2\x80\x9d  As to me, I was younger then than\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94there is much in that.  Youth is Gilead, in which is balm for every\r\nwound.  Ah, that I might again dwell in that enchanted land!\r\nUnacquainted with grief, I knew not how to appraise my bereavement; I\r\ncould not rightly estimate the strength of the stroke.\r\n\r\nOne night, a few months after the dreadful event, my father and I walked\r\nhome from the city.  The full moon was about three hours above the\r\neastern horizon; the entire countryside had the solemn stillness of a\r\nsummer night; our footfalls and the ceaseless song of the katydids were\r\nthe only sound aloof.  Black shadows of bordering trees lay athwart the\r\nroad, which, in the short reaches between, gleamed a ghostly white.  As\r\nwe approached the gate to our dwelling, whose front was in shadow, and in\r\nwhich no light shone, my father suddenly stopped and clutched my arm,\r\nsaying, hardly above his breath:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod!  God! what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut see\xe2\x80\x94see!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing along the road, directly ahead.\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing is there.  Come, father, let us go in\xe2\x80\x94you are ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had released my arm and was standing rigid and motionless in the\r\ncenter of the illuminated roadway, staring like one bereft of sense.  His\r\nface in the moonlight showed a pallor and fixity inexpressibly\r\ndistressing.  I pulled gently at his sleeve, but he had forgotten my\r\nexistence.  Presently he began to retire backward, step by step, never\r\nfor an instant removing his eyes from what he saw, or thought he saw.  I\r\nturned half round to follow, but stood irresolute.  I do not recall any\r\nfeeling of fear, unless a sudden chill was its physical manifestation.\r\nIt seemed as if an icy wind had touched my face and enfolded my body from\r\nhead to foot; I could feel the stir of it in my hair.\r\n\r\nAt that moment my attention was drawn to a light that suddenly streamed\r\nfrom an upper window of the house: one of the servants, awakened by what\r\nmysterious premonition of evil who can say, and in obedience to an\r\nimpulse that she was never able to name, had lit a lamp.  When I turned\r\nto look for my father he was gone, and in all the years that have passed\r\nno whisper of his fate has come across the borderland of conjecture from\r\nthe realm of the unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nSTATEMENT OF CASPAR GRATTAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day I am said to live; to-morrow, here in this room, will lie a\r\nsenseless shape of clay that all too long was I.  If anyone lift the\r\ncloth from the face of that unpleasant thing it will be in gratification\r\nof a mere morbid curiosity.  Some, doubtless, will go further and\r\ninquire, \xe2\x80\x9cWho was he?\xe2\x80\x9d  In this writing I supply the only answer that I\r\nam able to make\xe2\x80\x94Caspar Grattan.  Surely, that should be enough.  The name\r\nhas served my small need for more than twenty years of a life of unknown\r\nlength.  True, I gave it to myself, but lacking another I had the right.\r\nIn this world one must have a name; it prevents confusion, even when it\r\ndoes not establish identity.  Some, though, are known by numbers, which\r\nalso seem inadequate distinctions.\r\n\r\nOne day, for illustration, I was passing along a street of a city, far\r\nfrom here, when I met two men in uniform, one of whom, half pausing and\r\nlooking curiously into my face, said to his companion, \xe2\x80\x9cThat man looks\r\nlike 767.\xe2\x80\x9d  Something in the number seemed familiar and horrible.  Moved\r\nby an uncontrollable impulse, I sprang into a side street and ran until I\r\nfell exhausted in a country lane.\r\n\r\nI have never forgotten that number, and always it comes to memory\r\nattended by gibbering obscenity, peals of joyless laughter, the clang of\r\niron doors.  So I say a name, even if self-bestowed, is better than a\r\nnumber.  In the register of the potter\xe2\x80\x99s field I shall soon have both.\r\nWhat wealth!\r\n\r\nOf him who shall find this paper I must beg a little consideration.  It\r\nis not the history of my life; the knowledge to write that is denied me.\r\nThis is only a record of broken and apparently unrelated memories, some\r\nof them as distinct and sequent as brilliant beads upon a thread, others\r\nremote and strange, having the character of crimson dreams with\r\ninterspaces blank and black\xe2\x80\x94witch-fires glowing still and red in a great\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nStanding upon the shore of eternity, I turn for a last look landward over\r\nthe course by which I came.  There are twenty years of footprints fairly\r\ndistinct, the impressions of bleeding feet.  They lead through poverty\r\nand pain, devious and unsure, as of one staggering beneath a burden\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                    Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow.\r\n\r\nAh, the poet\xe2\x80\x99s prophecy of Me\xe2\x80\x94how admirable, how dreadfully admirable!\r\n\r\nBackward beyond the beginning of this _via dolorosa_\xe2\x80\x94this epic of\r\nsuffering with episodes of sin\xe2\x80\x94I see nothing clearly; it comes out of a\r\ncloud.  I know that it spans only twenty years, yet I am an old man.\r\n\r\nOne does not remember one\xe2\x80\x99s birth\xe2\x80\x94one has to be told.  But with me it was\r\ndifferent; life came to me full-handed and dowered me with all my\r\nfaculties and powers.  Of a previous existence I know no more than\r\nothers, for all have stammering intimations that may be memories and may\r\nbe dreams.  I know only that my first consciousness was of maturity in\r\nbody and mind\xe2\x80\x94a consciousness accepted without surprise or conjecture.  I\r\nmerely found myself walking in a forest, half-clad, footsore, unutterably\r\nweary and hungry.  Seeing a farmhouse, I approached and asked for food,\r\nwhich was given me by one who inquired my name.  I did not know, yet knew\r\nthat all had names.  Greatly embarrassed, I retreated, and night coming\r\non, lay down in the forest and slept.\r\n\r\nThe next day I entered a large town which I shall not name.  Nor shall I\r\nrecount further incidents of the life that is now to end\xe2\x80\x94a life of\r\nwandering, always and everywhere haunted by an overmastering sense of\r\ncrime in punishment of wrong and of terror in punishment of crime.  Let\r\nme see if I can reduce it to narrative.\r\n\r\nI seem once to have lived near a great city, a prosperous planter,\r\nmarried to a woman whom I loved and distrusted.  We had, it sometimes\r\nseems, one child, a youth of brilliant parts and promise.  He is at all\r\ntimes a vague figure, never clearly drawn, frequently altogether out of\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\nOne luckless evening it occurred to me to test my wife\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity in a\r\nvulgar, commonplace way familiar to everyone who has acquaintance with\r\nthe literature of fact and fiction.  I went to the city, telling my wife\r\nthat I should be absent until the following afternoon.  But I returned\r\nbefore daybreak and went to the rear of the house, purposing to enter by\r\na door with which I had secretly so tampered that it would seem to lock,\r\nyet not actually fasten.  As I approached it, I heard it gently open and\r\nclose, and saw a man steal away into the darkness.  With murder in my\r\nheart, I sprang after him, but he had vanished without even the bad luck\r\nof identification.  Sometimes now I cannot even persuade myself that it\r\nwas a human being.\r\n\r\nCrazed with jealousy and rage, blind and bestial with all the elemental\r\npassions of insulted manhood, I entered the house and sprang up the\r\nstairs to the door of my wife\xe2\x80\x99s chamber.  It was closed, but having\r\ntampered with its lock also, I easily entered and despite the black\r\ndarkness soon stood by the side of her bed.  My groping hands told me\r\nthat although disarranged it was unoccupied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is below,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand terrified by my entrance has evaded me in\r\nthe darkness of the hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the purpose of seeking her I turned to leave the room, but took a\r\nwrong direction\xe2\x80\x94the right one!  My foot struck her, cowering in a corner\r\nof the room.  Instantly my hands were at her throat, stifling a shriek,\r\nmy knees were upon her struggling body; and there in the darkness,\r\nwithout a word of accusation or reproach, I strangled her till she died!\r\n\r\nThere ends the dream.  I have related it in the past tense, but the\r\npresent would be the fitter form, for again and again the somber tragedy\r\nreenacts itself in my consciousness\xe2\x80\x94over and over I lay the plan, I\r\nsuffer the confirmation, I redress the wrong.  Then all is blank; and\r\nafterward the rains beat against the grimy window-panes, or the snows\r\nfall upon my scant attire, the wheels rattle in the squalid streets where\r\nmy life lies in poverty and mean employment.  If there is ever sunshine I\r\ndo not recall it; if there are birds they do not sing.\r\n\r\nThere is another dream, another vision of the night.  I stand among the\r\nshadows in a moonlit road.  I am aware of another presence, but whose I\r\ncannot rightly determine.  In the shadow of a great dwelling I catch the\r\ngleam of white garments; then the figure of a woman confronts me in the\r\nroad\xe2\x80\x94my murdered wife!  There is death in the face; there are marks upon\r\nthe throat.  The eyes are fixed on mine with an infinite gravity which is\r\nnot reproach, nor hate, nor menace, nor anything less terrible than\r\nrecognition.  Before this awful apparition I retreat in terror\xe2\x80\x94a terror\r\nthat is upon me as I write.  I can no longer rightly shape the words.\r\nSee! they\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNow I am calm, but truly there is no more to tell: the incident ends\r\nwhere it began\xe2\x80\x94in darkness and in doubt.\r\n\r\nYes, I am again in control of myself: \xe2\x80\x9cthe captain of my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d  But that\r\nis not respite; it is another stage and phase of expiation.  My penance,\r\nconstant in degree, is mutable in kind: one of its variants is\r\ntranquillity.  After all, it is only a life-sentence.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo Hell for\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is a foolish penalty: the culprit chooses the duration of his\r\npunishment.  To-day my term expires.\r\n\r\nTo each and all, the peace that was not mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nSTATEMENT OF THE LATE JULIA HETMAN,\r\nTHROUGH THE MEDIUM BAYROLLES\r\n\r\n\r\nI had retired early and fallen almost immediately into a peaceful sleep,\r\nfrom which I awoke with that indefinable sense of peril which is, I\r\nthink, a common experience in that other, earlier life.  Of its unmeaning\r\ncharacter, too, I was entirely persuaded, yet that did not banish it.  My\r\nhusband, Joel Hetman, was away from home; the servants slept in another\r\npart of the house.  But these were familiar conditions; they had never\r\nbefore distressed me.  Nevertheless, the strange terror grew so\r\ninsupportable that conquering my reluctance to move I sat up and lit the\r\nlamp at my bedside.  Contrary to my expectation this gave me no relief;\r\nthe light seemed rather an added danger, for I reflected that it would\r\nshine out under the door, disclosing my presence to whatever evil thing\r\nmight lurk outside.  You that are still in the flesh, subject to horrors\r\nof the imagination, think what a monstrous fear that must be which seeks\r\nin darkness security from malevolent existences of the night.  That is to\r\nspring to close quarters with an unseen enemy\xe2\x80\x94the strategy of despair!\r\n\r\nExtinguishing the lamp I pulled the bed-clothing about my head and lay\r\ntrembling and silent, unable to shriek, forgetful to pray.  In this\r\npitiable state I must have lain for what you call hours\xe2\x80\x94with us there are\r\nno hours, there is no time.\r\n\r\nAt last it came\xe2\x80\x94a soft, irregular sound of footfalls on the stairs!  They\r\nwere slow, hesitant, uncertain, as of something that did not see its way;\r\nto my disordered reason all the more terrifying for that, as the approach\r\nof some blind and mindless malevolence to which is no appeal.  I even\r\nthought that I must have left the hall lamp burning and the groping of\r\nthis creature proved it a monster of the night.  This was foolish and\r\ninconsistent with my previous dread of the light, but what would you\r\nhave?  Fear has no brains; it is an idiot.  The dismal witness that it\r\nbears and the cowardly counsel that it whispers are unrelated.  We know\r\nthis well, we who have passed into the Realm of Terror, who skulk in\r\neternal dusk among the scenes of our former lives, invisible even to\r\nourselves and one another, yet hiding forlorn in lonely places; yearning\r\nfor speech with our loved ones, yet dumb, and as fearful of them as they\r\nof us.  Sometimes the disability is removed, the law suspended: by the\r\ndeathless power of love or hate we break the spell\xe2\x80\x94we are seen by those\r\nwhom we would warn, console, or punish.  What form we seem to them to\r\nbear we know not; we know only that we terrify even those whom we most\r\nwish to comfort, and from whom we most crave tenderness and sympathy.\r\n\r\nForgive, I pray you, this inconsequent digression by what was once a\r\nwoman.  You who consult us in this imperfect way\xe2\x80\x94you do not understand.\r\nYou ask foolish questions about things unknown and things forbidden.\r\nMuch that we know and could impart in our speech is meaningless in yours.\r\nWe must communicate with you through a stammering intelligence in that\r\nsmall fraction of our language that you yourselves can speak.  You think\r\nthat we are of another world.  No, we have knowledge of no world but\r\nyours, though for us it holds no sunlight, no warmth, no music, no\r\nlaughter, no song of birds, nor any companionship.  O God! what a thing\r\nit is to be a ghost, cowering and shivering in an altered world, a prey\r\nto apprehension and despair!\r\n\r\nNo, I did not die of fright: the Thing turned and went away.  I heard it\r\ngo down the stairs, hurriedly, I thought, as if itself in sudden fear.\r\nThen I rose to call for help.  Hardly had my shaking hand found the\r\ndoorknob when\xe2\x80\x94merciful heaven!\xe2\x80\x94I heard it returning.  Its footfalls as it\r\nremounted the stairs were rapid, heavy and loud; they shook the house.  I\r\nfled to an angle of the wall and crouched upon the floor.  I tried to\r\npray.  I tried to call the name of my dear husband.  Then I heard the\r\ndoor thrown open.  There was an interval of unconsciousness, and when I\r\nrevived I felt a strangling clutch upon my throat\xe2\x80\x94felt my arms feebly\r\nbeating against something that bore me backward\xe2\x80\x94felt my tongue thrusting\r\nitself from between my teeth!  And then I passed into this life.\r\n\r\nNo, I have no knowledge of what it was.  The sum of what we knew at death\r\nis the measure of what we know afterward of all that went before.  Of\r\nthis existence we know many things, but no new light falls upon any page\r\nof that; in memory is written all of it that we can read.  Here are no\r\nheights of truth overlooking the confused landscape of that dubitable\r\ndomain.  We still dwell in the Valley of the Shadow, lurk in its desolate\r\nplaces, peering from brambles and thickets at its mad, malign\r\ninhabitants.  How should we have new knowledge of that fading past?\r\n\r\nWhat I am about to relate happened on a night.  We know when it is night,\r\nfor then you retire to your houses and we can venture from our places of\r\nconcealment to move unafraid about our old homes, to look in at the\r\nwindows, even to enter and gaze upon your faces as you sleep.  I had\r\nlingered long near the dwelling where I had been so cruelly changed to\r\nwhat I am, as we do while any that we love or hate remain.  Vainly I had\r\nsought some method of manifestation, some way to make my continued\r\nexistence and my great love and poignant pity understood by my husband\r\nand son.  Always if they slept they would wake, or if in my desperation I\r\ndared approach them when they were awake, would turn toward me the\r\nterrible eyes of the living, frightening me by the glances that I sought\r\nfrom the purpose that I held.\r\n\r\nOn this night I had searched for them without success, fearing to find\r\nthem; they were nowhere in the house, nor about the moonlit lawn.  For,\r\nalthough the sun is lost to us forever, the moon, full-orbed or slender,\r\nremains to us.  Sometimes it shines by night, sometimes by day, but\r\nalways it rises and sets, as in that other life.\r\n\r\nI left the lawn and moved in the white light and silence along the road,\r\naimless and sorrowing.  Suddenly I heard the voice of my poor husband in\r\nexclamations of astonishment, with that of my son in reassurance and\r\ndissuasion; and there by the shadow of a group of trees they stood\xe2\x80\x94near,\r\nso near!  Their faces were toward me, the eyes of the elder man fixed\r\nupon mine.  He saw me\xe2\x80\x94at last, at last, he saw me!  In the consciousness\r\nof that, my terror fled as a cruel dream.  The death-spell was broken:\r\nLove had conquered Law!  Mad with exultation I shouted\xe2\x80\x94I _must_ have\r\nshouted, \xe2\x80\x9cHe sees, he sees: he will understand!\xe2\x80\x9d  Then, controlling\r\nmyself, I moved forward, smiling and consciously beautiful, to offer\r\nmyself to his arms, to comfort him with endearments, and, with my son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand in mine, to speak words that should restore the broken bonds between\r\nthe living and the dead.\r\n\r\nAlas! alas! his face went white with fear, his eyes were as those of a\r\nhunted animal.  He backed away from me, as I advanced, and at last turned\r\nand fled into the wood\xe2\x80\x94whither, it is not given to me to know.\r\n\r\nTo my poor boy, left doubly desolate, I have never been able to impart a\r\nsense of my presence.  Soon he, too, must pass to this Life Invisible and\r\nbe lost to me forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DIAGNOSIS OF DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so superstitious as some of your physicians\xe2\x80\x94men of science, as\r\nyou are pleased to be called,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawver, replying to an accusation\r\nthat had not been made.  \xe2\x80\x9cSome of you\xe2\x80\x94only a few, I confess\xe2\x80\x94believe in\r\nthe immortality of the soul, and in apparitions which you have not the\r\nhonesty to call ghosts.  I go no further than a conviction that the\r\nliving are sometimes seen where they are not, but have been\xe2\x80\x94where they\r\nhave lived so long, perhaps so intensely, as to have left their impress\r\non everything about them.  I know, indeed, that one\xe2\x80\x99s environment may be\r\nso affected by one\xe2\x80\x99s personality as to yield, long afterward, an image of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self to the eyes of another.  Doubtless the impressing personality\r\nhas to be the right kind of personality as the perceiving eyes have to be\r\nthe right kind of eyes\xe2\x80\x94mine, for example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the right kind of eyes, conveying sensations to the wrong kind of\r\nbrain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Frayley, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; one likes to have an expectation gratified; that is about the\r\nreply that I supposed you would have the civility to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me.  But you say that you know.  That is a good deal to say,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you think?  Perhaps you will not mind the trouble of saying how you\r\nlearned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will call it an hallucination,\xe2\x80\x9d Hawver said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that does not\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he told the story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast summer I went, as you know, to pass the hot weather term in the\r\ntown of Meridian.  The relative at whose house I had intended to stay was\r\nill, so I sought other quarters.  After some difficulty I succeeded in\r\nrenting a vacant dwelling that had been occupied by an eccentric doctor\r\nof the name of Mannering, who had gone away years before, no one knew\r\nwhere, not even his agent.  He had built the house himself and had lived\r\nin it with an old servant for about ten years.  His practice, never very\r\nextensive, had after a few years been given up entirely.  Not only so,\r\nbut he had withdrawn himself almost altogether from social life and\r\nbecome a recluse.  I was told by the village doctor, about the only\r\nperson with whom he held any relations, that during his retirement he had\r\ndevoted himself to a single line of study, the result of which he had\r\nexpounded in a book that did not commend itself to the approval of his\r\nprofessional brethren, who, indeed, considered him not entirely sane.  I\r\nhave not seen the book and cannot now recall the title of it, but I am\r\ntold that it expounded a rather startling theory.  He held that it was\r\npossible in the case of many a person in good health to forecast his\r\ndeath with precision, several months in advance of the event.  The limit,\r\nI think, was eighteen months.  There were local tales of his having\r\nexerted his powers of prognosis, or perhaps you would say diagnosis; and\r\nit was said that in every instance the person whose friends he had warned\r\nhad died suddenly at the appointed time, and from no assignable cause.\r\nAll this, however, has nothing to do with what I have to tell; I thought\r\nit might amuse a physician.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house was furnished, just as he had lived in it.  It was a rather\r\ngloomy dwelling for one who was neither a recluse nor a student, and I\r\nthink it gave something of its character to me\xe2\x80\x94perhaps some of its former\r\noccupant\xe2\x80\x99s character; for always I felt in it a certain melancholy that\r\nwas not in my natural disposition, nor, I think, due to loneliness.  I\r\nhad no servants that slept in the house, but I have always been, as you\r\nknow, rather fond of my own society, being much addicted to reading,\r\nthough little to study.  Whatever was the cause, the effect was dejection\r\nand a sense of impending evil; this was especially so in Dr. Mannering\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy, although that room was the lightest and most airy in the house.\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s life-size portrait in oil hung in that room, and seemed\r\ncompletely to dominate it.  There was nothing unusual in the picture; the\r\nman was evidently rather good looking, about fifty years old, with\r\niron-gray hair, a smooth-shaven face and dark, serious eyes.  Something\r\nin the picture always drew and held my attention.  The man\xe2\x80\x99s appearance\r\nbecame familiar to me, and rather \xe2\x80\x98haunted\xe2\x80\x99 me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening I was passing through this room to my bedroom, with a\r\nlamp\xe2\x80\x94there is no gas in Meridian.  I stopped as usual before the\r\nportrait, which seemed in the lamplight to have a new expression, not\r\neasily named, but distinctly uncanny.  It interested but did not disturb\r\nme.  I moved the lamp from one side to the other and observed the effects\r\nof the altered light.  While so engaged I felt an impulse to turn round.\r\nAs I did so I saw a man moving across the room directly toward me!  As\r\nsoon as he came near enough for the lamplight to illuminate the face I\r\nsaw that it was Dr. Mannering himself; it was as if the portrait were\r\nwalking!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, somewhat coldly, \xe2\x80\x98but if you knocked I did\r\nnot hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe passed me, within an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, lifted his right forefinger, as in\r\nwarning, and without a word went on out of the room, though I observed\r\nhis exit no more than I had observed his entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I need not tell you that this was what you will call an\r\nhallucination and I call an apparition.  That room had only two doors, of\r\nwhich one was locked; the other led into a bedroom, from which there was\r\nno exit.  My feeling on realizing this is not an important part of the\r\nincident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless this seems to you a very commonplace \xe2\x80\x98ghost story\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nconstructed on the regular lines laid down by the old masters of the art.\r\nIf that were so I should not have related it, even if it were true.  The\r\nman was not dead; I met him to-day in Union street.  He passed me in a\r\ncrowd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawver had finished his story and both men were silent.  Dr. Frayley\r\nabsently drummed on the table with his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he say anything to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9canything from which you inferred\r\nthat he was not dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawver stared and did not reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Frayley, \xe2\x80\x9che made a sign, a gesture\xe2\x80\x94lifted a finger,\r\nas in warning.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a trick he had\xe2\x80\x94a habit when saying something\r\nserious\xe2\x80\x94announcing the result of a diagnosis, for example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he did\xe2\x80\x94just as his apparition had done.  But, good God! did you\r\never know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawver was apparently growing nervous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew him.  I have read his book, as will every physician some day.  It\r\nis one of the most striking and important of the century\xe2\x80\x99s contributions\r\nto medical science.  Yes, I knew him; I attended him in an illness three\r\nyears ago.  He died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawver sprang from his chair, manifestly disturbed.  He strode forward\r\nand back across the room; then approached his friend, and in a voice not\r\naltogether steady, said: \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor, have you anything to say to me\xe2\x80\x94as a\r\nphysician?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Hawver; you are the healthiest man I ever knew.  As a friend I\r\nadvise you to go to your room.  You play the violin like an angel.  Play\r\nit; play something light and lively.  Get this cursed bad business off\r\nyour mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day Hawver was found dead in his room, the violin at his neck,\r\nthe bow upon the strings, his music open before him at Chopin\xe2\x80\x99s funeral\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOXON\xe2\x80\x99S MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cARE you serious?\xe2\x80\x94do you really believe that a machine thinks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI got no immediate reply; Moxon was apparently intent upon the coals in\r\nthe grate, touching them deftly here and there with the fire-poker till\r\nthey signified a sense of his attention by a brighter glow.  For several\r\nweeks I had been observing in him a growing habit of delay in answering\r\neven the most trivial of commonplace questions.  His air, however, was\r\nthat of preoccupation rather than deliberation: one might have said that\r\nhe had \xe2\x80\x9csomething on his mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a \xe2\x80\x98machine\xe2\x80\x99?  The word has been variously defined.  Here is one\r\ndefinition from a popular dictionary: \xe2\x80\x98Any instrument or organization by\r\nwhich power is applied and made effective, or a desired effect produced.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWell, then, is not a man a machine?  And you will admit that he thinks\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nthinks he thinks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do not wish to answer my question,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, rather testily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\nnot say so?\xe2\x80\x94all that you say is mere evasion.  You know well enough that\r\nwhen I say \xe2\x80\x98machine\xe2\x80\x99 I do not mean a man, but something that man has made\r\nand controls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it does not control him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rising abruptly and looking out\r\nof a window, whence nothing was visible in the blackness of a stormy\r\nnight.  A moment later he turned about and with a smile said: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your\r\npardon; I had no thought of evasion.  I considered the dictionary man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunconscious testimony suggestive and worth something in the discussion.\r\nI can give your question a direct answer easily enough: I do believe that\r\na machine thinks about the work that it is doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was direct enough, certainly.  It was not altogether pleasing, for\r\nit tended to confirm a sad suspicion that Moxon\xe2\x80\x99s devotion to study and\r\nwork in his machine-shop had not been good for him.  I knew, for one\r\nthing, that he suffered from insomnia, and that is no light affliction.\r\nHad it affected his mind?  His reply to my question seemed to me then\r\nevidence that it had; perhaps I should think differently about it now.  I\r\nwas younger then, and among the blessings that are not denied to youth is\r\nignorance.  Incited by that great stimulant to controversy, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what, pray, does it think with\xe2\x80\x94in the absence of a brain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reply, coming with less than his customary delay, took his favorite\r\nform of counter-interrogation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith what does a plant think\xe2\x80\x94in the absence of a brain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, plants also belong to the philosopher class!  I should be pleased to\r\nknow some of their conclusions; you may omit the premises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, apparently unaffected by my foolish irony, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nmay be able to infer their convictions from their acts.  I will spare you\r\nthe familiar examples of the sensitive mimosa, the several insectivorous\r\nflowers and those whose stamens bend down and shake their pollen upon the\r\nentering bee in order that he may fertilize their distant mates.  But\r\nobserve this.  In an open spot in my garden I planted a climbing vine.\r\nWhen it was barely above the surface I set a stake into the soil a yard\r\naway.  The vine at once made for it, but as it was about to reach it\r\nafter several days I removed it a few feet.  The vine at once altered its\r\ncourse, making an acute angle, and again made for the stake.  This\r\nman\xc5\x93uvre was repeated several times, but finally, as if discouraged, the\r\nvine abandoned the pursuit and ignoring further attempts to divert it\r\ntraveled to a small tree, further away, which it climbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoots of the eucalyptus will prolong themselves incredibly in search of\r\nmoisture.  A well-known horticulturist relates that one entered an old\r\ndrain pipe and followed it until it came to a break, where a section of\r\nthe pipe had been removed to make way for a stone wall that had been\r\nbuilt across its course.  The root left the drain and followed the wall\r\nuntil it found an opening where a stone had fallen out.  It crept through\r\nand following the other side of the wall back to the drain, entered the\r\nunexplored part and resumed its journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you miss the significance of it?  It shows the consciousness of\r\nplants.  It proves that they think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if it did\xe2\x80\x94what then?  We were speaking, not of plants, but of\r\nmachines.  They may be composed partly of wood\xe2\x80\x94wood that has no longer\r\nvitality\xe2\x80\x94or wholly of metal.  Is thought an attribute also of the mineral\r\nkingdom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow else do you explain the phenomena, for example, of crystallization?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not explain them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you cannot without affirming what you wish to deny, namely,\r\nintelligent cooperation among the constituent elements of the crystals.\r\nWhen soldiers form lines, or hollow squares, you call it reason.  When\r\nwild geese in flight take the form of a letter V you say instinct.  When\r\nthe homogeneous atoms of a mineral, moving freely in solution, arrange\r\nthemselves into shapes mathematically perfect, or particles of frozen\r\nmoisture into the symmetrical and beautiful forms of snowflakes, you have\r\nnothing to say.  You have not even invented a name to conceal your heroic\r\nunreason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMoxon was speaking with unusual animation and earnestness.  As he paused\r\nI heard in an adjoining room known to me as his \xe2\x80\x9cmachine-shop,\xe2\x80\x9d which no\r\none but himself was permitted to enter, a singular thumping sound, as of\r\nsome one pounding upon a table with an open hand.  Moxon heard it at the\r\nsame moment and, visibly agitated, rose and hurriedly passed into the\r\nroom whence it came.  I thought it odd that any one else should be in\r\nthere, and my interest in my friend\xe2\x80\x94with doubtless a touch of\r\nunwarrantable curiosity\xe2\x80\x94led me to listen intently, though, I am happy to\r\nsay, not at the keyhole.  There were confused sounds, as of a struggle or\r\nscuffle; the floor shook.  I distinctly heard hard breathing and a hoarse\r\nwhisper which said \xe2\x80\x9cDamn you!\xe2\x80\x9d  Then all was silent, and presently Moxon\r\nreappeared and said, with a rather sorry smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for leaving you so abruptly.  I have a machine in there that\r\nlost its temper and cut up rough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFixing my eyes steadily upon his left cheek, which was traversed by four\r\nparallel excoriations showing blood, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would it do to trim its nails?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could have spared myself the jest; he gave it no attention, but seated\r\nhimself in the chair that he had left and resumed the interrupted\r\nmonologue as if nothing had occurred:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless you do not hold with those (I need not name them to a man of\r\nyour reading) who have taught that all matter is sentient, that every\r\natom is a living, feeling, conscious being.  _I_ do.  There is no such\r\nthing as dead, inert matter: it is all alive; all instinct with force,\r\nactual and potential; all sensitive to the same forces in its environment\r\nand susceptible to the contagion of higher and subtler ones residing in\r\nsuch superior organisms as it may be brought into relation with, as those\r\nof man when he is fashioning it into an instrument of his will.  It\r\nabsorbs something of his intelligence and purpose\xe2\x80\x94more of them in\r\nproportion to the complexity of the resulting machine and that of its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to recall Herbert Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x98Life\xe2\x80\x99?  I read\r\nit thirty years ago.  He may have altered it afterward, for anything I\r\nknow, but in all that time I have been unable to think of a single word\r\nthat could profitably be changed or added or removed.  It seems to me not\r\nonly the best definition, but the only possible one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Life,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98is a definite combination of heterogeneous changes,\r\nboth simultaneous and successive, in correspondence with external\r\ncoexistences and sequences.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat defines the phenomenon,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut gives no hint of its cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cis all that any definition can do.  As Mill points\r\nout, we know nothing of cause except as an antecedent\xe2\x80\x94nothing of effect\r\nexcept as a consequent.  Of certain phenomena, one never occurs without\r\nanother, which is dissimilar: the first in point of time we call cause,\r\nthe second, effect.  One who had many times seen a rabbit pursued by a\r\ndog, and had never seen rabbits and dogs otherwise, would think the\r\nrabbit the cause of the dog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I fear,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, laughing naturally enough, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my rabbit is\r\nleading me a long way from the track of my legitimate quarry: I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nindulging in the pleasure of the chase for its own sake.  What I want you\r\nto observe is that in Herbert Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x98life\xe2\x80\x99 the activity\r\nof a machine is included\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing in the definition that is not\r\napplicable to it.  According to this sharpest of observers and deepest of\r\nthinkers, if a man during his period of activity is alive, so is a\r\nmachine when in operation.  As an inventor and constructor of machines I\r\nknow that to be true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMoxon was silent for a long time, gazing absently into the fire.  It was\r\ngrowing late and I thought it time to be going, but somehow I did not\r\nlike the notion of leaving him in that isolated house, all alone except\r\nfor the presence of some person of whose nature my conjectures could go\r\nno further than that it was unfriendly, perhaps malign.  Leaning toward\r\nhim and looking earnestly into his eyes while making a motion with my\r\nhand through the door of his workshop, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoxon, whom have you in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomewhat to my surprise he laughed lightly and answered without\r\nhesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody; the incident that you have in mind was caused by my folly in\r\nleaving a machine in action with nothing to act upon, while I undertook\r\nthe interminable task of enlightening your understanding.  Do you happen\r\nto know that Consciousness is the creature of Rhythm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO bother them both!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, rising and laying hold of my overcoat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to wish you good night; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll add the hope that the machine\r\nwhich you inadvertently left in action will have her gloves on the next\r\ntime you think it needful to stop her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to observe the effect of my shot I left the house.\r\n\r\nRain was falling, and the darkness was intense.  In the sky beyond the\r\ncrest of a hill toward which I groped my way along precarious plank\r\nsidewalks and across miry, unpaved streets I could see the faint glow of\r\nthe city\xe2\x80\x99s lights, but behind me nothing was visible but a single window\r\nof Moxon\xe2\x80\x99s house.  It glowed with what seemed to me a mysterious and\r\nfateful meaning.  I knew it was an uncurtained aperture in my friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmachine-shop,\xe2\x80\x9d and I had little doubt that he had resumed the studies\r\ninterrupted by his duties as my instructor in mechanical consciousness\r\nand the fatherhood of Rhythm.  Odd, and in some degree humorous, as his\r\nconvictions seemed to me at that time, I could not wholly divest myself\r\nof the feeling that they had some tragic relation to his life and\r\ncharacter\xe2\x80\x94perhaps to his destiny\xe2\x80\x94although I no longer entertained the\r\nnotion that they were the vagaries of a disordered mind.  Whatever might\r\nbe thought of his views, his exposition of them was too logical for that.\r\nOver and over, his last words came back to me: \xe2\x80\x9cConsciousness is the\r\ncreature of Rhythm.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bald and terse as the statement was, I now found it\r\ninfinitely alluring.  At each recurrence it broadened in meaning and\r\ndeepened in suggestion.  Why, here, (I thought) is something upon which\r\nto found a philosophy.  If consciousness is the product of rhythm all\r\nthings _are_ conscious, for all have motion, and all motion is rhythmic.\r\nI wondered if Moxon knew the significance and breadth of his thought\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nscope of this momentous generalization; or had he arrived at his\r\nphilosophic faith by the tortuous and uncertain road of observation?\r\n\r\nThat faith was then new to me, and all Moxon\xe2\x80\x99s expounding had failed to\r\nmake me a convert; but now it seemed as if a great light shone about me,\r\nlike that which fell upon Saul of Tarsus; and out there in the storm and\r\ndarkness and solitude I experienced what Lewes calls \xe2\x80\x9cThe endless variety\r\nand excitement of philosophic thought.\xe2\x80\x9d  I exulted in a new sense of\r\nknowledge, a new pride of reason.  My feet seemed hardly to touch the\r\nearth; it was as if I were uplifted and borne through the air by\r\ninvisible wings.\r\n\r\nYielding to an impulse to seek further light from him whom I now\r\nrecognized as my master and guide, I had unconsciously turned about, and\r\nalmost before I was aware of having done so found myself again at Moxon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor.  I was drenched with rain, but felt no discomfort.  Unable in my\r\nexcitement to find the doorbell I instinctively tried the knob.  It\r\nturned and, entering, I mounted the stairs to the room that I had so\r\nrecently left.  All was dark and silent; Moxon, as I had supposed, was in\r\nthe adjoining room\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cmachine-shop.\xe2\x80\x9d  Groping along the wall until I\r\nfound the communicating door I knocked loudly several times, but got no\r\nresponse, which I attributed to the uproar outside, for the wind was\r\nblowing a gale and dashing the rain against the thin walls in sheets.\r\nThe drumming upon the shingle roof spanning the unceiled room was loud\r\nand incessant.\r\n\r\nI had never been invited into the machine-shop\xe2\x80\x94had, indeed, been denied\r\nadmittance, as had all others, with one exception, a skilled metal\r\nworker, of whom no one knew anything except that his name was Haley and\r\nhis habit silence.  But in my spiritual exaltation, discretion and\r\ncivility were alike forgotten and I opened the door.  What I saw took all\r\nphilosophical speculation out of me in short order.\r\n\r\nMoxon sat facing me at the farther side of a small table upon which a\r\nsingle candle made all the light that was in the room.  Opposite him, his\r\nback toward me, sat another person.  On the table between the two was a\r\nchessboard; the men were playing.  I knew little of chess, but as only a\r\nfew pieces were on the board it was obvious that the game was near its\r\nclose.  Moxon was intensely interested\xe2\x80\x94not so much, it seemed to me, in\r\nthe game as in his antagonist, upon whom he had fixed so intent a look\r\nthat, standing though I did directly in the line of his vision, I was\r\naltogether unobserved.  His face was ghastly white, and his eyes\r\nglittered like diamonds.  Of his antagonist I had only a back view, but\r\nthat was sufficient; I should not have cared to see his face.\r\n\r\nHe was apparently not more than five feet in height, with proportions\r\nsuggesting those of a gorilla\xe2\x80\x94a tremendous breadth of shoulders, thick,\r\nshort neck and broad, squat head, which had a tangled growth of black\r\nhair and was topped with a crimson fez.  A tunic of the same color,\r\nbelted tightly to the waist, reached the seat\xe2\x80\x94apparently a box\xe2\x80\x94upon which\r\nhe sat; his legs and feet were not seen.  His left forearm appeared to\r\nrest in his lap; he moved his pieces with his right hand, which seemed\r\ndisproportionately long.\r\n\r\nI had shrunk back and now stood a little to one side of the doorway and\r\nin shadow.  If Moxon had looked farther than the face of his opponent he\r\ncould have observed nothing now, except that the door was open.\r\nSomething forbade me either to enter or to retire, a feeling\xe2\x80\x94I know not\r\nhow it came\xe2\x80\x94that I was in the presence of an imminent tragedy and might\r\nserve my friend by remaining.  With a scarcely conscious rebellion\r\nagainst the indelicacy of the act I remained.\r\n\r\nThe play was rapid.  Moxon hardly glanced at the board before making his\r\nmoves, and to my unskilled eye seemed to move the piece most convenient\r\nto his hand, his motions in doing so being quick, nervous and lacking in\r\nprecision.  The response of his antagonist, while equally prompt in the\r\ninception, was made with a slow, uniform, mechanical and, I thought,\r\nsomewhat theatrical movement of the arm, that was a sore trial to my\r\npatience.  There was something unearthly about it all, and I caught\r\nmyself shuddering.  But I was wet and cold.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times after moving a piece the stranger slightly inclined\r\nhis head, and each time I observed that Moxon shifted his king.  All at\r\nonce the thought came to me that the man was dumb.  And then that he was\r\na machine\xe2\x80\x94an automaton chess-player!  Then I remembered that Moxon had\r\nonce spoken to me of having invented such a piece of mechanism, though I\r\ndid not understand that it had actually been constructed.  Was all his\r\ntalk about the consciousness and intelligence of machines merely a\r\nprelude to eventual exhibition of this device\xe2\x80\x94only a trick to intensify\r\nthe effect of its mechanical action upon me in my ignorance of its\r\nsecret?\r\n\r\nA fine end, this, of all my intellectual transports\xe2\x80\x94my \xe2\x80\x9cendless variety\r\nand excitement of philosophic thought!\xe2\x80\x9d  I was about to retire in disgust\r\nwhen something occurred to hold my curiosity.  I observed a shrug of the\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99s great shoulders, as if it were irritated: and so natural was\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94so entirely human\xe2\x80\x94that in my new view of the matter it startled me.\r\nNor was that all, for a moment later it struck the table sharply with its\r\nclenched hand.  At that gesture Moxon seemed even more startled than I:\r\nhe pushed his chair a little backward, as in alarm.\r\n\r\nPresently Moxon, whose play it was, raised his hand high above the board,\r\npounced upon one of his pieces like a sparrow-hawk and with the\r\nexclamation \xe2\x80\x9ccheckmate!\xe2\x80\x9d rose quickly to his feet and stepped behind his\r\nchair.  The automaton sat motionless.\r\n\r\nThe wind had now gone down, but I heard, at lessening intervals and\r\nprogressively louder, the rumble and roll of thunder.  In the pauses\r\nbetween I now became conscious of a low humming or buzzing which, like\r\nthe thunder, grew momentarily louder and more distinct.  It seemed to\r\ncome from the body of the automaton, and was unmistakably a whirring of\r\nwheels.  It gave me the impression of a disordered mechanism which had\r\nescaped the repressive and regulating action of some controlling part\xe2\x80\x94an\r\neffect such as might be expected if a pawl should be jostled from the\r\nteeth of a ratchet-wheel.  But before I had time for much conjecture as\r\nto its nature my attention was taken by the strange motions of the\r\nautomaton itself.  A slight but continuous convulsion appeared to have\r\npossession of it.  In body and head it shook like a man with palsy or an\r\nague chill, and the motion augmented every moment until the entire figure\r\nwas in violent agitation.  Suddenly it sprang to its feet and with a\r\nmovement almost too quick for the eye to follow shot forward across table\r\nand chair, with both arms thrust forth to their full length\xe2\x80\x94the posture\r\nand lunge of a diver.  Moxon tried to throw himself backward out of\r\nreach, but he was too late: I saw the horrible thing\xe2\x80\x99s hands close upon\r\nhis throat, his own clutch its wrists.  Then the table was overturned,\r\nthe candle thrown to the floor and extinguished, and all was black dark.\r\nBut the noise of the struggle was dreadfully distinct, and most terrible\r\nof all were the raucous, squawking sounds made by the strangled man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nefforts to breathe.  Guided by the infernal hubbub, I sprang to the\r\nrescue of my friend, but had hardly taken a stride in the darkness when\r\nthe whole room blazed with a blinding white light that burned into my\r\nbrain and heart and memory a vivid picture of the combatants on the\r\nfloor, Moxon underneath, his throat still in the clutch of those iron\r\nhands, his head forced backward, his eyes protruding, his mouth wide open\r\nand his tongue thrust out; and\xe2\x80\x94horrible contrast!\xe2\x80\x94upon the painted face\r\nof his assassin an expression of tranquil and profound thought, as in the\r\nsolution of a problem in chess!  This I observed, then all was blackness\r\nand silence.\r\n\r\nThree days later I recovered consciousness in a hospital.  As the memory\r\nof that tragic night slowly evolved in my ailing brain recognized in my\r\nattendant Moxon\xe2\x80\x99s confidential workman, Haley.  Responding to a look he\r\napproached, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about it,\xe2\x80\x9d I managed to say, faintly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou were carried unconscious from a burning\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94Moxon\xe2\x80\x99s.  Nobody knows how you came to be there.  You may have to\r\ndo a little explaining.  The origin of the fire is a bit mysterious, too.\r\nMy own notion is that the house was struck by lightning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Moxon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuried yesterday\xe2\x80\x94what was left of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently this reticent person could unfold himself on occasion.  When\r\nimparting shocking intelligence to the sick he was affable enough.  After\r\nsome moments of the keenest mental suffering I ventured to ask another\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho rescued me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that interests you\xe2\x80\x94I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mr. Haley, and may God bless you for it.  Did you rescue,\r\nalso, that charming product of your skill, the automaton chess-player\r\nthat murdered its inventor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was silent a long time, looking away from me.  Presently he\r\nturned and gravely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI saw it done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was many years ago.  If asked to-day I should answer less\r\nconfidently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOUGH TUSSLE\r\n\r\n\r\nONE night in the autumn of 1861 a man sat alone in the heart of a forest\r\nin western Virginia.  The region was one of the wildest on the\r\ncontinent\xe2\x80\x94the Cheat Mountain country.  There was no lack of people close\r\nat hand, however; within a mile of where the man sat was the now silent\r\ncamp of a whole Federal brigade.  Somewhere about\xe2\x80\x94it might be still\r\nnearer\xe2\x80\x94was a force of the enemy, the numbers unknown.  It was this\r\nuncertainty as to its numbers and position that accounted for the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence in that lonely spot; he was a young officer of a Federal\r\ninfantry regiment and his business there was to guard his sleeping\r\ncomrades in the camp against a surprise.  He was in command of a\r\ndetachment of men constituting a picket-guard.  These men he had\r\nstationed just at nightfall in an irregular line, determined by the\r\nnature of the ground, several hundred yards in front of where he now sat.\r\nThe line ran through the forest, among the rocks and laurel thickets, the\r\nmen fifteen or twenty paces apart, all in concealment and under\r\ninjunction of strict silence and unremitting vigilance.  In four hours,\r\nif nothing occurred, they would be relieved by a fresh detachment from\r\nthe reserve now resting in care of its captain some distance away to the\r\nleft and rear.  Before stationing his men the young officer of whom we\r\nare writing had pointed out to his two sergeants the spot at which he\r\nwould be found if it should be necessary to consult him, or if his\r\npresence at the front line should be required.\r\n\r\nIt was a quiet enough spot\xe2\x80\x94the fork of an old wood-road, on the two\r\nbranches of which, prolonging themselves deviously forward in the dim\r\nmoonlight, the sergeants were themselves stationed, a few paces in rear\r\nof the line.  If driven sharply back by a sudden onset of the enemy\xe2\x80\x94and\r\npickets are not expected to make a stand after firing\xe2\x80\x94the men would come\r\ninto the converging roads and naturally following them to their point of\r\nintersection could be rallied and \xe2\x80\x9cformed.\xe2\x80\x9d  In his small way the author\r\nof these dispositions was something of a strategist; if Napoleon had\r\nplanned as intelligently at Waterloo he would have won that memorable\r\nbattle and been overthrown later.\r\n\r\nSecond-Lieutenant Brainerd Byring was a brave and efficient officer,\r\nyoung and comparatively inexperienced as he was in the business of\r\nkilling his fellow-men.  He had enlisted in the very first days of the\r\nwar as a private, with no military knowledge whatever, had been made\r\nfirst-sergeant of his company on account of his education and engaging\r\nmanner, and had been lucky enough to lose his captain by a Confederate\r\nbullet; in the resulting promotions he had gained a commission.  He had\r\nbeen in several engagements, such as they were\xe2\x80\x94at Philippi, Rich\r\nMountain, Carrick\xe2\x80\x99s Ford and Greenbrier\xe2\x80\x94and had borne himself with such\r\ngallantry as not to attract the attention of his superior officers.  The\r\nexhilaration of battle was agreeable to him, but the sight of the dead,\r\nwith their clay faces, blank eyes and stiff bodies, which when not\r\nunnaturally shrunken were unnaturally swollen, had always intolerably\r\naffected him.  He felt toward them a kind of reasonless antipathy that\r\nwas something more than the physical and spiritual repugnance common to\r\nus all.  Doubtless this feeling was due to his unusually acute\r\nsensibilities\xe2\x80\x94his keen sense of the beautiful, which these hideous things\r\noutraged.  Whatever may have been the cause, he could not look upon a\r\ndead body without a loathing which had in it an element of resentment.\r\nWhat others have respected as the dignity of death had to him no\r\nexistence\xe2\x80\x94was altogether unthinkable.  Death was a thing to be hated.  It\r\nwas not picturesque, it had no tender and solemn side\xe2\x80\x94a dismal thing,\r\nhideous in all its manifestations and suggestions.  Lieutenant Byring was\r\na braver man than anybody knew, for nobody knew his horror of that which\r\nhe was ever ready to incur.\r\n\r\nHaving posted his men, instructed his sergeants and retired to his\r\nstation, he seated himself on a log, and with senses all alert began his\r\nvigil.  For greater ease he loosened his sword-belt and taking his heavy\r\nrevolver from his holster laid it on the log beside him.  He felt very\r\ncomfortable, though he hardly gave the fact a thought, so intently did he\r\nlisten for any sound from the front which might have a menacing\r\nsignificance\xe2\x80\x94a shout, a shot, or the footfall of one of his sergeants\r\ncoming to apprise him of something worth knowing.  From the vast,\r\ninvisible ocean of moonlight overhead fell, here and there, a slender,\r\nbroken stream that seemed to plash against the intercepting branches and\r\ntrickle to earth, forming small white pools among the clumps of laurel.\r\nBut these leaks were few and served only to accentuate the blackness of\r\nhis environment, which his imagination found it easy to people with all\r\nmanner of unfamiliar shapes, menacing, uncanny, or merely grotesque.\r\n\r\nHe to whom the portentous conspiracy of night and solitude and silence in\r\nthe heart of a great forest is not an unknown experience needs not to be\r\ntold what another world it all is\xe2\x80\x94how even the most commonplace and\r\nfamiliar objects take on another character.  The trees group themselves\r\ndifferently; they draw closer together, as if in fear.  The very silence\r\nhas another quality than the silence of the day.  And it is full of\r\nhalf-heard whispers\xe2\x80\x94whispers that startle\xe2\x80\x94ghosts of sounds long dead.\r\nThere are living sounds, too, such as are never heard under other\r\nconditions: notes of strange night-birds, the cries of small animals in\r\nsudden encounters with stealthy foes or in their dreams, a rustling in\r\nthe dead leaves\xe2\x80\x94it may be the leap of a wood-rat, it may be the footfall\r\nof a panther.  What caused the breaking of that twig?\xe2\x80\x94what the low,\r\nalarmed twittering in that bushful of birds?  There are sounds without a\r\nname, forms without substance, translations in space of objects which\r\nhave not been seen to move, movements wherein nothing is observed to\r\nchange its place.  Ah, children of the sunlight and the gaslight, how\r\nlittle you know of the world in which you live!\r\n\r\nSurrounded at a little distance by armed and watchful friends, Byring\r\nfelt utterly alone.  Yielding himself to the solemn and mysterious spirit\r\nof the time and place, he had forgotten the nature of his connection with\r\nthe visible and audible aspects and phases of the night.  The forest was\r\nboundless; men and the habitations of men did not exist.  The universe\r\nwas one primeval mystery of darkness, without form and void, himself the\r\nsole, dumb questioner of its eternal secret.  Absorbed in thoughts born\r\nof this mood, he suffered the time to slip away unnoted.  Meantime the\r\ninfrequent patches of white light lying amongst the tree-trunks had\r\nundergone changes of size, form and place.  In one of them near by, just\r\nat the roadside, his eye fell upon an object that he had not previously\r\nobserved.  It was almost before his face as he sat; he could have sworn\r\nthat it had not before been there.  It was partly covered in shadow, but\r\nhe could see that it was a human figure.  Instinctively he adjusted the\r\nclasp of his sword-belt and laid hold of his pistol\xe2\x80\x94again he was in a\r\nworld of war, by occupation an assassin.\r\n\r\nThe figure did not move.  Rising, pistol in hand, he approached.  The\r\nfigure lay upon its back, its upper part in shadow, but standing above it\r\nand looking down upon the face, he saw that it was a dead body.  He\r\nshuddered and turned from it with a feeling of sickness and disgust,\r\nresumed his seat upon the log, and forgetting military prudence struck a\r\nmatch and lit a cigar.  In the sudden blackness that followed the\r\nextinction of the flame he felt a sense of relief; he could no longer see\r\nthe object of his aversion.  Nevertheless, he kept his eyes set in that\r\ndirection until it appeared again with growing distinctness.  It seemed\r\nto have moved a trifle nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn the thing!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt did not appear to be in need of anything but a soul.\r\n\r\nByring turned away his eyes and began humming a tune, but he broke off in\r\nthe middle of a bar and looked at the dead body.  Its presence annoyed\r\nhim, though he could hardly have had a quieter neighbor.  He was\r\nconscious, too, of a vague, indefinable feeling that was new to him.  It\r\nwas not fear, but rather a sense of the supernatural\xe2\x80\x94in which he did not\r\nat all believe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have inherited it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.  \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it will require a\r\nthousand ages\xe2\x80\x94perhaps ten thousand\xe2\x80\x94for humanity to outgrow this feeling.\r\nWhere and when did it originate?  Away back, probably, in what is called\r\nthe cradle of the human race\xe2\x80\x94the plains of Central Asia.  What we inherit\r\nas a superstition our barbarous ancestors must have held as a reasonable\r\nconviction.  Doubtless they believed themselves justified by facts whose\r\nnature we cannot even conjecture in thinking a dead body a malign thing\r\nendowed with some strange power of mischief, with perhaps a will and a\r\npurpose to exert it.  Possibly they had some awful form of religion of\r\nwhich that was one of the chief doctrines, sedulously taught by their\r\npriesthood, as ours teach the immortality of the soul.  As the Aryans\r\nmoved slowly on, to and through the Caucasus passes, and spread over\r\nEurope, new conditions of life must have resulted in the formulation of\r\nnew religions.  The old belief in the malevolence of the dead body was\r\nlost from the creeds and even perished from tradition, but it left its\r\nheritage of terror, which is transmitted from generation to generation\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nas much a part of us as are our blood and bones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn following out his thought he had forgotten that which suggested it;\r\nbut now his eye fell again upon the corpse.  The shadow had now\r\naltogether uncovered it.  He saw the sharp profile, the chin in the air,\r\nthe whole face, ghastly white in the moonlight.  The clothing was gray,\r\nthe uniform of a Confederate soldier.  The coat and waistcoat,\r\nunbuttoned, had fallen away on each side, exposing the white shirt.  The\r\nchest seemed unnaturally prominent, but the abdomen had sunk in, leaving\r\na sharp projection at the line of the lower ribs.  The arms were\r\nextended, the left knee was thrust upward.  The whole posture impressed\r\nByring as having been studied with a view to the horrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9che was an actor\xe2\x80\x94he knows how to be dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew away his eyes, directing them resolutely along one of the roads\r\nleading to the front, and resumed his philosophizing where he had left\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that our Central Asian ancestors had not the custom of burial.\r\nIn that case it is easy to understand their fear of the dead, who really\r\nwere a menace and an evil.  They bred pestilences.  Children were taught\r\nto avoid the places where they lay, and to run away if by inadvertence\r\nthey came near a corpse.  I think, indeed, I\xe2\x80\x99d better go away from this\r\nchap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe half rose to do so, then remembered that he had told his men in front\r\nand the officer in the rear who was to relieve him that he could at any\r\ntime be found at that spot.  It was a matter of pride, too.  If he\r\nabandoned his post he feared they would think he feared the corpse.  He\r\nwas no coward and he was unwilling to incur anybody\xe2\x80\x99s ridicule.  So he\r\nagain seated himself, and to prove his courage looked boldly at the body.\r\nThe right arm\xe2\x80\x94the one farthest from him\xe2\x80\x94was now in shadow.  He could\r\nbarely see the hand which, he had before observed, lay at the root of a\r\nclump of laurel.  There had been no change, a fact which gave him a\r\ncertain comfort, he could not have said why.  He did not at once remove\r\nhis eyes; that which we do not wish to see has a strange fascination,\r\nsometimes irresistible.  Of the woman who covers her eyes with her hands\r\nand looks between the fingers let it be said that the wits have dealt\r\nwith her not altogether justly.\r\n\r\nByring suddenly became conscious of a pain in his right hand.  He\r\nwithdrew his eyes from his enemy and looked at it.  He was grasping the\r\nhilt of his drawn sword so tightly that it hurt him.  He observed, too,\r\nthat he was leaning forward in a strained attitude\xe2\x80\x94crouching like a\r\ngladiator ready to spring at the throat of an antagonist.  His teeth were\r\nclenched and he was breathing hard.  This matter was soon set right, and\r\nas his muscles relaxed and he drew a long breath he felt keenly enough\r\nthe ludicrousness of the incident.  It affected him to laughter.\r\nHeavens! what sound was that? what mindless devil was uttering an unholy\r\nglee in mockery of human merriment?  He sprang to his feet and looked\r\nabout him, not recognizing his own laugh.\r\n\r\nHe could no longer conceal from himself the horrible fact of his\r\ncowardice; he was thoroughly frightened!  He would have run from the\r\nspot, but his legs refused their office; they gave way beneath him and he\r\nsat again upon the log, violently trembling.  His face was wet, his whole\r\nbody bathed in a chill perspiration.  He could not even cry out.\r\nDistinctly he heard behind him a stealthy tread, as of some wild animal,\r\nand dared not look over his shoulder.  Had the soulless living joined\r\nforces with the soulless dead?\xe2\x80\x94was it an animal?  Ah, if he could but be\r\nassured of that!  But by no effort of will could he now unfix his gaze\r\nfrom the face of the dead man.\r\n\r\nI repeat that Lieutenant Byring was a brave and intelligent man.  But\r\nwhat would you have?  Shall a man cope, single-handed, with so monstrous\r\nan alliance as that of night and solitude and silence and the dead,\xe2\x80\x94while\r\nan incalculable host of his own ancestors shriek into the ear of his\r\nspirit their coward counsel, sing their doleful death-songs in his heart,\r\nand disarm his very blood of all its iron?  The odds are too\r\ngreat\xe2\x80\x94courage was not made for so rough use as that.\r\n\r\nOne sole conviction now had the man in possession: that the body had\r\nmoved.  It lay nearer to the edge of its plot of light\xe2\x80\x94there could be no\r\ndoubt of it.  It had also moved its arms, for, look, they are both in the\r\nshadow!  A breath of cold air struck Byring full in the face; the boughs\r\nof trees above him stirred and moaned.  A strongly defined shadow passed\r\nacross the face of the dead, left it luminous, passed back upon it and\r\nleft it half obscured.  The horrible thing was visibly moving!  At that\r\nmoment a single shot rang out upon the picket-line\xe2\x80\x94a lonelier and louder,\r\nthough more distant, shot than ever had been heard by mortal ear!  It\r\nbroke the spell of that enchanted man; it slew the silence and the\r\nsolitude, dispersed the hindering host from Central Asia and released his\r\nmodern manhood.  With a cry like that of some great bird pouncing upon\r\nits prey he sprang forward, hot-hearted for action!\r\n\r\nShot after shot now came from the front.  There were shoutings and\r\nconfusion, hoof-beats and desultory cheers.  Away to the rear, in the\r\nsleeping camp, were a singing of bugles and grumble of drums.  Pushing\r\nthrough the thickets on either side the roads came the Federal pickets,\r\nin full retreat, firing backward at random as they ran.  A straggling\r\ngroup that had followed back one of the roads, as instructed, suddenly\r\nsprang away into the bushes as half a hundred horsemen thundered by them,\r\nstriking wildly with their sabres as they passed.  At headlong speed\r\nthese mounted madmen shot past the spot where Byring had sat, and\r\nvanished round an angle of the road, shouting and firing their pistols.\r\nA moment later there was a roar of musketry, followed by dropping\r\nshots\xe2\x80\x94they had encountered the reserve-guard in line; and back they came\r\nin dire confusion, with here and there an empty saddle and many a\r\nmaddened horse, bullet-stung, snorting and plunging with pain.  It was\r\nall over\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9can affair of outposts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe line was re\xc3\xabstablished with fresh men, the roll called, the\r\nstragglers were reformed.  The Federal commander with a part of his\r\nstaff, imperfectly clad, appeared upon the scene, asked a few questions,\r\nlooked exceedingly wise and retired.  After standing at arms for an hour\r\nthe brigade in camp \xe2\x80\x9cswore a prayer or two\xe2\x80\x9d and went to bed.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning a fatigue-party, commanded by a captain and\r\naccompanied by a surgeon, searched the ground for dead and wounded.  At\r\nthe fork of the road, a little to one side, they found two bodies lying\r\nclose together\xe2\x80\x94that of a Federal officer and that of a Confederate\r\nprivate.  The officer had died of a sword-thrust through the heart, but\r\nnot, apparently, until he had inflicted upon his enemy no fewer than five\r\ndreadful wounds.  The dead officer lay on his face in a pool of blood,\r\nthe weapon still in his breast.  They turned him on his back and the\r\nsurgeon removed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Byring!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94adding, with a glance at the\r\nother, \xe2\x80\x9cThey had a tough tussle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon was examining the sword.  It was that of a line officer of\r\nFederal infantry\xe2\x80\x94exactly like the one worn by the captain.  It was, in\r\nfact, Byring\xe2\x80\x99s own.  The only other weapon discovered was an undischarged\r\nrevolver in the dead officer\xe2\x80\x99s belt.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon laid down the sword and approached the other body.  It was\r\nfrightfully gashed and stabbed, but there was no blood.  He took hold of\r\nthe left foot and tried to straighten the leg.  In the effort the body\r\nwas displaced.  The dead do not wish to be moved\xe2\x80\x94it protested with a\r\nfaint, sickening odor.  Where it had lain were a few maggots, manifesting\r\nan imbecile activity.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon looked at the captain.  The captain looked at the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF TWINS\r\n\r\n\r\n        A LETTER FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF THE LATE MORTIMER BARR\r\n\r\nYOU ask me if in my experience as one of a pair of twins I ever observed\r\nanything unaccountable by the natural laws with which we have\r\nacquaintance.  As to that you shall judge; perhaps we have not all\r\nacquaintance with the same natural laws.  You may know some that I do\r\nnot, and what is to me unaccountable may be very clear to you.\r\n\r\nYou knew my brother John\xe2\x80\x94that is, you knew him when you knew that I was\r\nnot present; but neither you nor, I believe, any human being could\r\ndistinguish between him and me if we chose to seem alike.  Our parents\r\ncould not; ours is the only instance of which I have any knowledge of so\r\nclose resemblance as that.  I speak of my brother John, but I am not at\r\nall sure that his name was not Henry and mine John.  We were regularly\r\nchristened, but afterward, in the very act of tattooing us with small\r\ndistinguishing marks, the operator lost his reckoning; and although I\r\nbear upon my forearm a small \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x9d and he bore a \xe2\x80\x9cJ,\xe2\x80\x9d it is by no means\r\ncertain that the letters ought not to have been transposed.  During our\r\nboyhood our parents tried to distinguish us more obviously by our\r\nclothing and other simple devices, but we would so frequently exchange\r\nsuits and otherwise circumvent the enemy that they abandoned all such\r\nineffectual attempts, and during all the years that we lived together at\r\nhome everybody recognized the difficulty of the situation and made the\r\nbest of it by calling us both \xe2\x80\x9cJehnry.\xe2\x80\x9d  I have often wondered at my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s forbearance in not branding us conspicuously upon our unworthy\r\nbrows, but as we were tolerably good boys and used our power of\r\nembarrassment and annoyance with commendable moderation, we escaped the\r\niron.  My father was, in fact, a singularly good-natured man, and I think\r\nquietly enjoyed nature\xe2\x80\x99s practical joke.\r\n\r\nSoon after we had come to California, and settled at San Jose (where the\r\nonly good fortune that awaited us was our meeting with so kind a friend\r\nas you) the family, as you know, was broken up by the death of both my\r\nparents in the same week.  My father died insolvent and the homestead was\r\nsacrificed to pay his debts.  My sisters returned to relatives in the\r\nEast, but owing to your kindness John and I, then twenty-two years of\r\nage, obtained employment in San Francisco, in different quarters of the\r\ntown.  Circumstances did not permit us to live together, and we saw each\r\nother infrequently, sometimes not oftener than once a week.  As we had\r\nfew acquaintances in common, the fact of our extraordinary likeness was\r\nlittle known.  I come now to the matter of your inquiry.\r\n\r\nOne day soon after we had come to this city I was walking down Market\r\nstreet late in the afternoon, when I was accosted by a well-dressed man\r\nof middle age, who after greeting me cordially said: \xe2\x80\x9cStevens, I know, of\r\ncourse, that you do not go out much, but I have told my wife about you,\r\nand she would be glad to see you at the house.  I have a notion, too,\r\nthat my girls are worth knowing.  Suppose you come out to-morrow at six\r\nand dine with us, _en famille_; and then if the ladies can\xe2\x80\x99t amuse you\r\nafterward I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand in with a few games of billiards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was said with so bright a smile and so engaging a manner that I had\r\nnot the heart to refuse, and although I had never seen the man in my life\r\nI promptly replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good, sir, and it will give me great\r\npleasure to accept the invitation.  Please present my compliments to Mrs.\r\nMargovan and ask her to expect me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a shake of the hand and a pleasant parting word the man passed on.\r\nThat he had mistaken me for my brother was plain enough.  That was an\r\nerror to which I was accustomed and which it was not my habit to rectify\r\nunless the matter seemed important.  But how had I known that this man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname was Margovan?  It certainly is not a name that one would apply to a\r\nman at random, with a probability that it would be right.  In point of\r\nfact, the name was as strange to me as the man.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I hastened to where my brother was employed and met him\r\ncoming out of the office with a number of bills that he was to collect.\r\nI told him how I had \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted\xe2\x80\x9d him and added that if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care to\r\nkeep the engagement I should be delighted to continue the impersonation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s queer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said thoughtfully.  \xe2\x80\x9cMargovan is the only man in the\r\noffice here whom I know well and like.  When he came in this morning and\r\nwe had passed the usual greetings some singular impulse prompted me to\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Margovan, but I neglected to ask your\r\naddress.\xe2\x80\x99  I got the address, but what under the sun I was to do with it,\r\nI did not know until now.  It\xe2\x80\x99s good of you to offer to take the\r\nconsequence of your impudence, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat that dinner myself, if you\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ate a number of dinners at the same place\xe2\x80\x94more than were good for him,\r\nI may add without disparaging their quality; for he fell in love with\r\nMiss Margovan, proposed marriage to her and was heartlessly accepted.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks after I had been informed of the engagement, but before it\r\nhad been convenient for me to make the acquaintance of the young woman\r\nand her family, I met one day on Kearney street a handsome but somewhat\r\ndissipated-looking man whom something prompted me to follow and watch,\r\nwhich I did without any scruple whatever.  He turned up Geary street and\r\nfollowed it until he came to Union square.  There he looked at his watch,\r\nthen entered the square.  He loitered about the paths for some time,\r\nevidently waiting for someone.  Presently he was joined by a fashionably\r\ndressed and beautiful young woman and the two walked away up Stockton\r\nstreet, I following.  I now felt the necessity of extreme caution, for\r\nalthough the girl was a stranger it seemed to me that she would recognize\r\nme at a glance.  They made several turns from one street to another and\r\nfinally, after both had taken a hasty look all about\xe2\x80\x94which I narrowly\r\nevaded by stepping into a doorway\xe2\x80\x94they entered a house of which I do not\r\ncare to state the location.  Its location was better than its character.\r\n\r\nI protest that my action in playing the spy upon these two strangers was\r\nwithout assignable motive.  It was one of which I might or might not be\r\nashamed, according to my estimate of the character of the person finding\r\nit out.  As an essential part of a narrative educed by your question it\r\nis related here without hesitancy or shame.\r\n\r\nA week later John took me to the house of his prospective father-in-law,\r\nand in Miss Margovan, as you have already surmised, but to my profound\r\nastonishment, I recognized the heroine of that discreditable adventure.\r\nA gloriously beautiful heroine of a discreditable adventure I must in\r\njustice admit that she was; but that fact has only this importance: her\r\nbeauty was such a surprise to me that it cast a doubt upon her identity\r\nwith the young woman I had seen before; how could the marvelous\r\nfascination of her face have failed to strike me at that time?  But\r\nno\xe2\x80\x94there was no possibility of error; the difference was due to costume,\r\nlight and general surroundings.\r\n\r\nJohn and I passed the evening at the house, enduring, with the fortitude\r\nof long experience, such delicate enough banter as our likeness naturally\r\nsuggested.  When the young lady and I were left alone for a few minutes I\r\nlooked her squarely in the face and said with sudden gravity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, too, Miss Margovan, have a double: I saw her last Tuesday afternoon\r\nin Union square.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe trained her great gray eyes upon me for a moment, but her glance was\r\na trifle less steady than my own and she withdrew it, fixing it on the\r\ntip of her shoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she very like me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with an indifference which I thought a\r\nlittle overdone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo like,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I greatly admired her, and being unwilling to\r\nlose sight of her I confess that I followed her until\xe2\x80\x94Miss Margovan, are\r\nyou sure that you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was now pale, but entirely calm.  She again raised her eyes to mine,\r\nwith a look that did not falter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you wish me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou need not fear to name your\r\nterms.  I accept them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was plain, even in the brief time given me for reflection, that in\r\ndealing with this girl ordinary methods would not do, and ordinary\r\nexactions were needless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Margovan,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, doubtless with something of the compassion in my\r\nvoice that I had in my heart, \xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible not to think you the\r\nvictim of some horrible compulsion.  Rather than impose new\r\nembarrassments upon you I would prefer to aid you to regain your\r\nfreedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, sadly and hopelessly, and I continued, with\r\nagitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour beauty unnerves me.  I am disarmed by your frankness and your\r\ndistress.  If you are free to act upon conscience you will, I believe, do\r\nwhat you conceive to be best; if you are not\xe2\x80\x94well, Heaven help us all!\r\nYou have nothing to fear from me but such opposition to this marriage as\r\nI can try to justify on\xe2\x80\x94on other grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese were not my exact words, but that was the sense of them, as nearly\r\nas my sudden and conflicting emotions permitted me to express it.  I rose\r\nand left her without another look at her, met the others as they\r\nreentered the room and said, as calmly as I could: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been bidding\r\nMiss Margovan good evening; it is later than I thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn decided to go with me.  In the street he asked if I had observed\r\nanything singular in Julia\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought her ill,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is why I left.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nothing more was\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe next evening I came late to my lodgings.  The events of the previous\r\nevening had made me nervous and ill; I had tried to cure myself and\r\nattain to clear thinking by walking in the open air, but I was oppressed\r\nwith a horrible presentiment of evil\xe2\x80\x94a presentiment which I could not\r\nformulate.  It was a chill, foggy night; my clothing and hair were damp\r\nand I shook with cold.  In my dressing-gown and slippers before a blazing\r\ngrate of coals I was even more uncomfortable.  I no longer shivered but\r\nshuddered\xe2\x80\x94there is a difference.  The dread of some impending calamity\r\nwas so strong and dispiriting that I tried to drive it away by inviting a\r\nreal sorrow\xe2\x80\x94tried to dispel the conception of a terrible future by\r\nsubstituting the memory of a painful past.  I recalled the death of my\r\nparents and endeavored to fix my mind upon the last sad scenes at their\r\nbedsides and their graves.  It all seemed vague and unreal, as having\r\noccurred ages ago and to another person.  Suddenly, striking through my\r\nthought and parting it as a tense cord is parted by the stroke of steel\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan think of no other comparison\xe2\x80\x94I heard a sharp cry as of one in mortal\r\nagony!  The voice was that of my brother and seemed to come from the\r\nstreet outside my window.  I sprang to the window and threw it open.  A\r\nstreet lamp directly opposite threw a wan and ghastly light upon the wet\r\npavement and the fronts of the houses.  A single policeman, with upturned\r\ncollar, was leaning against a gatepost, quietly smoking a cigar.  No one\r\nelse was in sight.  I closed the window and pulled down the shade, seated\r\nmyself before the fire and tried to fix my mind upon my surroundings.  By\r\nway of assisting, by performance of some familiar act, I looked at my\r\nwatch; it marked half-past eleven.  Again I heard that awful cry!  It\r\nseemed in the room\xe2\x80\x94at my side.  I was frightened and for some moments had\r\nnot the power to move.  A few minutes later\xe2\x80\x94I have no recollection of the\r\nintermediate time\xe2\x80\x94I found myself hurrying along an unfamiliar street as\r\nfast as I could walk.  I did not know where I was, nor whither I was\r\ngoing, but presently sprang up the steps of a house before which were two\r\nor three carriages and in which were moving lights and a subdued\r\nconfusion of voices.  It was the house of Mr. Margovan.\r\n\r\nYou know, good friend, what had occurred there.  In one chamber lay Julia\r\nMargovan, hours dead by poison; in another John Stevens, bleeding from a\r\npistol wound in the chest, inflicted by his own hand.  As I burst into\r\nthe room, pushed aside the physicians and laid my hand upon his forehead\r\nhe unclosed his eyes, stared blankly, closed them slowly and died without\r\na sign.\r\n\r\nI knew no more until six weeks afterward, when I had been nursed back to\r\nlife by your own saintly wife in your own beautiful home.  All of that\r\nyou know, but what you do not know is this\xe2\x80\x94which, however, has no bearing\r\nupon the subject of your psychological researches\xe2\x80\x94at least not upon that\r\nbranch of them in which, with a delicacy and consideration all your own,\r\nyou have asked for less assistance than I think I have given you:\r\n\r\nOne moonlight night several years afterward I was passing through Union\r\nsquare.  The hour was late and the square deserted.  Certain memories of\r\nthe past naturally came into my mind as I came to the spot where I had\r\nonce witnessed that fateful assignation, and with that unaccountable\r\nperversity which prompts us to dwell upon thoughts of the most painful\r\ncharacter I seated myself upon one of the benches to indulge them.  A man\r\nentered the square and came along the walk toward me.  His hands were\r\nclasped behind him, his head was bowed; he seemed to observe nothing.  As\r\nhe approached the shadow in which I sat I recognized him as the man whom\r\nI had seen meet Julia Margovan years before at that spot.  But he was\r\nterribly altered\xe2\x80\x94gray, worn and haggard.  Dissipation and vice were in\r\nevidence in every look; illness was no less apparent.  His clothing was\r\nin disorder, his hair fell across his forehead in a derangement which was\r\nat once uncanny and picturesque.  He looked fitter for restraint than\r\nliberty\xe2\x80\x94the restraint of a hospital.\r\n\r\nWith no defined purpose I rose and confronted him.  He raised his head\r\nand looked me full in the face.  I have no words to describe the ghastly\r\nchange that came over his own; it was a look of unspeakable terror\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nthought himself eye to eye with a ghost.  But he was a courageous man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn you, John Stevens!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and lifting his trembling arm he\r\ndashed his fist feebly at my face and fell headlong upon the gravel as I\r\nwalked away.\r\n\r\nSomebody found him there, stone-dead.  Nothing more is known of him, not\r\neven his name.  To know of a man that he is dead should be enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAUNTED VALLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nHOW TREES ARE FELLED IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nA HALF-MILE north from Jo. Dunfer\xe2\x80\x99s, on the road from Hutton\xe2\x80\x99s to Mexican\r\nHill, the highway dips into a sunless ravine which opens out on either\r\nhand in a half-confidential manner, as if it had a secret to impart at\r\nsome more convenient season.  I never used to ride through it without\r\nlooking first to the one side and then to the other, to see if the time\r\nhad arrived for the revelation.  If I saw nothing\xe2\x80\x94and I never did see\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94there was no feeling of disappointment, for I knew the\r\ndisclosure was merely withheld temporarily for some good reason which I\r\nhad no right to question.  That I should one day be taken into full\r\nconfidence I no more doubted than I doubted the existence of Jo. Dunfer\r\nhimself, through whose premises the ravine ran.\r\n\r\nIt was said that Jo. had once undertaken to erect a cabin in some remote\r\npart of it, but for some reason had abandoned the enterprise and\r\nconstructed his present hermaphrodite habitation, half residence and half\r\ngroggery, at the roadside, upon an extreme corner of his estate; as far\r\naway as possible, as if on purpose to show how radically he had changed\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nThis Jo. Dunfer\xe2\x80\x94or, as he was familiarly known in the neighborhood,\r\nWhisky Jo.\xe2\x80\x94was a very important personage in those parts.  He was\r\napparently about forty years of age, a long, shock-headed fellow, with a\r\ncorded face, a gnarled arm and a knotty hand like a bunch of prison-keys.\r\nHe was a hairy man, with a stoop in his walk, like that of one who is\r\nabout to spring upon something and rend it.\r\n\r\nNext to the peculiarity to which he owed his local appellation, Mr.\r\nDunfer\xe2\x80\x99s most obvious characteristic was a deep-seated antipathy to the\r\nChinese.  I saw him once in a towering rage because one of his herdsmen\r\nhad permitted a travel-heated Asian to slake his thirst at the\r\nhorse-trough in front of the saloon end of Jo.\xe2\x80\x99s establishment.  I\r\nventured faintly to remonstrate with Jo. for his unchristian spirit, but\r\nhe merely explained that there was nothing about Chinamen in the New\r\nTestament, and strode away to wreak his displeasure upon his dog, which\r\nalso, I suppose, the inspired scribes had overlooked.\r\n\r\nSome days afterward, finding him sitting alone in his barroom, I\r\ncautiously approached the subject, when, greatly to my relief, the\r\nhabitual austerity of his expression visibly softened into something that\r\nI took for condescension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou young Easterners,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9care a mile-and-a-half too good for this\r\ncountry, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t catch on to our play.  People who don\xe2\x80\x99t know a\r\nChile\xc3\xb1o from a Kanaka can afford to hang out liberal ideas about Chinese\r\nimmigration, but a fellow that has to fight for his bone with a lot of\r\nmongrel coolies hasn\xe2\x80\x99t any time for foolishness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis long consumer, who had probably never done an honest day\xe2\x80\x99s-work in\r\nhis life, sprung the lid of a Chinese tobacco-box and with thumb and\r\nforefinger forked out a wad like a small haycock.  Holding this\r\nreinforcement within supporting distance he fired away with renewed\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re a flight of devouring locusts, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going for everything\r\ngreen in this God blest land, if you want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere he pushed his reserve into the breach and when his gabble-gear was\r\nagain disengaged resumed his uplifting discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had one of them on this ranch five years ago, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you about\r\nit, so that you can see the nub of this whole question.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pan out\r\nparticularly well those days\xe2\x80\x94drank more whisky than was prescribed for me\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care for my duty as a patriotic American citizen; so I\r\ntook that pagan in, as a kind of cook.  But when I got religion over at\r\nthe Hill and they talked of running me for the Legislature it was given\r\nto me to see the light.  But what was I to do?  If I gave him the go\r\nsomebody else would take him, and mightn\xe2\x80\x99t treat him white.  _What_ was I\r\nto do?  What would any good Christian do, especially one new to the trade\r\nand full to the neck with the brotherhood of Man and the fatherhood of\r\nGod?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJo. paused for a reply, with an expression of unstable satisfaction, as\r\nof one who has solved a problem by a distrusted method.  Presently he\r\nrose and swallowed a glass of whisky from a full bottle on the counter,\r\nthen resumed his story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t count for much\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything and gave himself\r\nairs.  They all do that.  I said him nay, but he muled it through on that\r\nline while he lasted; but after turning the other cheek seventy and seven\r\ntimes I doctored the dice so that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t last forever.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nalmighty glad I had the sand to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJo.\xe2\x80\x99s gladness, which somehow did not impress me, was duly and\r\nostentatiously celebrated at the bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout five years ago I started in to stick up a shack.  That was before\r\nthis one was built, and I put it in another place.  I set Ah Wee and a\r\nlittle cuss named Gopher to cutting the timber.  Of course I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect Ah Wee to help much, for he had a face like a day in June and big\r\nblack eyes\xe2\x80\x94I guess maybe they were the damn\xe2\x80\x99dest eyes in this neck o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwoods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile delivering this trenchant thrust at common sense Mr. Dunfer\r\nabsently regarded a knot-hole in the thin board partition separating the\r\nbar from the living-room, as if that were one of the eyes whose size and\r\ncolor had incapacitated his servant for good service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you Eastern galoots won\xe2\x80\x99t believe anything against the yellow\r\ndevils,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly flamed out with an appearance of earnestness not\r\naltogether convincing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I tell you that Chink was the perversest\r\nscoundrel outside San Francisco.  The miserable pigtail Mongolian went to\r\nhewing away at the saplings all round the stems, like a worm o\xe2\x80\x99 the dust\r\ngnawing a radish.  I pointed out his error as patiently as I knew how,\r\nand showed him how to cut them on two sides, so as to make them fall\r\nright; but no sooner would I turn my back on him, like this\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\nturned it on me, amplifying the illustration by taking some more\r\nliquor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthan he was at it again.  It was just this way: while I looked at\r\nhim, _so_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94regarding me rather unsteadily and with evident complexity of\r\nvision\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che was all right; but when I looked away, _so_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94taking a long\r\npull at the bottle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che defied me.  Then I\xe2\x80\x99d gaze at him reproachfully,\r\n_so_, and butter wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have melted in his mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoubtless Mr. Dunfer honestly intended the look that he fixed upon me to\r\nbe merely reproachful, but it was singularly fit to arouse the gravest\r\napprehension in any unarmed person incurring it; and as I had lost all\r\ninterest in his pointless and interminable narrative, I rose to go.\r\nBefore I had fairly risen, he had again turned to the counter, and with a\r\nbarely audible \xe2\x80\x9cso,\xe2\x80\x9d had emptied the bottle at a gulp.\r\n\r\nHeavens! what a yell!  It was like a Titan in his last, strong agony.\r\nJo. staggered back after emitting it, as a cannon recoils from its own\r\nthunder, and then dropped into his chair, as if he had been \xe2\x80\x9cknocked in\r\nthe head\xe2\x80\x9d like a beef\xe2\x80\x94his eyes drawn sidewise toward the wall, with a\r\nstare of terror.  Looking in the same direction, I saw that the knot-hole\r\nin the wall had indeed become a human eye\xe2\x80\x94a full, black eye, that glared\r\ninto my own with an entire lack of expression more awful than the most\r\ndevilish glitter.  I think I must have covered my face with my hands to\r\nshut out the horrible illusion, if such it was, and Jo.\xe2\x80\x99s little white\r\nman-of-all-work coming into the room broke the spell, and I walked out of\r\nthe house with a sort of dazed fear that _delirium tremens_ might be\r\ninfectious.  My horse was hitched at the watering-trough, and untying him\r\nI mounted and gave him his head, too much troubled in mind to note\r\nwhither he took me.\r\n\r\nI did not know what to think of all this, and like every one who does not\r\nknow what to think I thought a great deal, and to little purpose.  The\r\nonly reflection that seemed at all satisfactory, was, that on the morrow\r\nI should be some miles away, with a strong probability of never\r\nreturning.\r\n\r\nA sudden coolness brought me out of my abstraction, and looking up I\r\nfound myself entering the deep shadows of the ravine.  The day was\r\nstifling; and this transition from the pitiless, visible heat of the\r\nparched fields to the cool gloom, heavy with pungency of cedars and vocal\r\nwith twittering of the birds that had been driven to its leafy asylum,\r\nwas exquisitely refreshing.  I looked for my mystery, as usual, but not\r\nfinding the ravine in a communicative mood, dismounted, led my sweating\r\nanimal into the undergrowth, tied him securely to a tree and sat down\r\nupon a rock to meditate.\r\n\r\nI began bravely by analyzing my pet superstition about the place.  Having\r\nresolved it into its constituent elements I arranged them in convenient\r\ntroops and squadrons, and collecting all the forces of my logic bore down\r\nupon them from impregnable premises with the thunder of irresistible\r\nconclusions and a great noise of chariots and general intellectual\r\nshouting.  Then, when my big mental guns had overturned all opposition,\r\nand were growling almost inaudibly away on the horizon of pure\r\nspeculation, the routed enemy straggled in upon their rear, massed\r\nsilently into a solid phalanx, and captured me, bag and baggage.  An\r\nindefinable dread came upon me.  I rose to shake it off, and began\r\nthreading the narrow dell by an old, grass-grown cow-path that seemed to\r\nflow along the bottom, as a substitute for the brook that Nature had\r\nneglected to provide.\r\n\r\nThe trees among which the path straggled were ordinary, well-behaved\r\nplants, a trifle perverted as to trunk and eccentric as to bough, but\r\nwith nothing unearthly in their general aspect.  A few loose bowlders,\r\nwhich had detached themselves from the sides of the depression to set up\r\nan independent existence at the bottom, had dammed up the pathway, here\r\nand there, but their stony repose had nothing in it of the stillness of\r\ndeath.  There was a kind of death-chamber hush in the valley, it is true,\r\nand a mysterious whisper above: the wind was just fingering the tops of\r\nthe trees\xe2\x80\x94that was all.\r\n\r\nI had not thought of connecting Jo. Dunfer\xe2\x80\x99s drunken narrative with what\r\nI now sought, and only when I came into a clear space and stumbled over\r\nthe level trunks of some small trees did I have the revelation.  This was\r\nthe site of the abandoned \xe2\x80\x9cshack.\xe2\x80\x9d  The discovery was verified by noting\r\nthat some of the rotting stumps were hacked all round, in a most\r\nunwoodmanlike way, while others were cut straight across, and the butt\r\nends of the corresponding trunks had the blunt wedge-form given by the\r\naxe of a master.\r\n\r\nThe opening among the trees was not more than thirty paces across.  At\r\none side was a little knoll\xe2\x80\x94a natural hillock, bare of shrubbery but\r\ncovered with wild grass, and on this, standing out of the grass, the\r\nheadstone of a grave!\r\n\r\nI do not remember that I felt anything like surprise at this discovery.\r\nI viewed that lonely grave with something of the feeling that Columbus\r\nmust have had when he saw the hills and headlands of the new world.\r\nBefore approaching it I leisurely completed my survey of the\r\nsurroundings.  I was even guilty of the affectation of winding my watch\r\nat that unusual hour, and with needless care and deliberation.  Then I\r\napproached my mystery.\r\n\r\nThe grave\xe2\x80\x94a rather short one\xe2\x80\x94was in somewhat better repair than was\r\nconsistent with its obvious age and isolation, and my eyes, I dare say,\r\nwidened a trifle at a clump of unmistakable garden flowers showing\r\nevidence of recent watering.  The stone had clearly enough done duty once\r\nas a doorstep.  In its front was carved, or rather dug, an inscription.\r\nIt read thus:\r\n\r\n                               AH WEE\xe2\x80\x94CHINAMAN.\r\n                     Age unknown.  Worked for Jo. Dunfer.\r\n             This monument is erected by him to keep the Chink\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n              memory green.  Likewise as a warning to Celestials\r\n                    not to take on airs.  Devil take \xe2\x80\x99em!\r\n                             She Was a Good Egg.\r\n\r\nI cannot adequately relate my astonishment at this uncommon inscription!\r\nThe meagre but sufficient identification of the deceased; the impudent\r\ncandor of confession; the brutal anathema; the ludicrous change of sex\r\nand sentiment\xe2\x80\x94all marked this record as the work of one who must have\r\nbeen at least as much demented as bereaved.  I felt that any further\r\ndisclosure would be a paltry anti-climax, and with an unconscious regard\r\nfor dramatic effect turned squarely about and walked away.  Nor did I\r\nreturn to that part of the county for four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nWHO DRIVES SANE OXEN SHOULD HIMSELF BE SANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee-up, there, old Fuddy-Duddy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis unique adjuration came from the lips of a queer little man perched\r\nupon a wagonful of firewood, behind a brace of oxen that were hauling it\r\neasily along with a simulation of mighty effort which had evidently not\r\nimposed on their lord and master.  As that gentleman happened at the\r\nmoment to be staring me squarely in the face as I stood by the roadside\r\nit was not altogether clear whether he was addressing me or his beasts;\r\nnor could I say if they were named Fuddy and Duddy and were both subjects\r\nof the imperative verb \xe2\x80\x9cto gee-up.\xe2\x80\x9d  Anyhow the command produced no\r\neffect on us, and the queer little man removed his eyes from mine long\r\nenough to spear Fuddy and Duddy alternately with a long pole, remarking,\r\nquietly but with feeling: \xe2\x80\x9cDern your skin,\xe2\x80\x9d as if they enjoyed that\r\nintegument in common.  Observing that my request for a ride took no\r\nattention, and finding myself falling slowly astern, I placed one foot\r\nupon the inner circumference of a hind wheel and was slowly elevated to\r\nthe level of the hub, whence I boarded the concern, _sans c\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9monie_, and\r\nscrambling forward seated myself beside the driver\xe2\x80\x94who took no notice of\r\nme until he had administered another indiscriminate castigation to his\r\ncattle, accompanied with the advice to \xe2\x80\x9cbuckle down, you derned\r\nIncapable!\xe2\x80\x9d  Then, the master of the outfit (or rather the former master,\r\nfor I could not suppress a whimsical feeling that the entire\r\nestablishment was my lawful prize) trained his big, black eyes upon me\r\nwith an expression strangely, and somewhat unpleasantly, familiar, laid\r\ndown his rod\xe2\x80\x94which neither blossomed nor turned into a serpent, as I half\r\nexpected\xe2\x80\x94folded his arms, and gravely demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at did you do to\r\nW\xe2\x80\x99isky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy natural reply would have been that I drank it, but there was something\r\nabout the query that suggested a hidden significance, and something about\r\nthe man that did not invite a shallow jest.  And so, having no other\r\nanswer ready, I merely held my tongue, but felt as if I were resting\r\nunder an imputation of guilt, and that my silence was being construed\r\ninto a confession.\r\n\r\nJust then a cold shadow fell upon my cheek, and caused me to look up.  We\r\nwere descending into my ravine!  I cannot describe the sensation that\r\ncame upon me: I had not seen it since it unbosomed itself four years\r\nbefore, and now I felt like one to whom a friend has made some sorrowing\r\nconfession of crime long past, and who has basely deserted him in\r\nconsequence.  The old memories of Jo. Dunfer, his fragmentary revelation,\r\nand the unsatisfying explanatory note by the headstone, came back with\r\nsingular distinctness.  I wondered what had become of Jo., and\xe2\x80\x94I turned\r\nsharply round and asked my prisoner.  He was intently watching his\r\ncattle, and without withdrawing his eyes replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee-up, old Terrapin!  He lies aside of Ah Wee up the gulch.  Like to\r\nsee it?  They always come back to the spot\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been expectin\xe2\x80\x99 you.\r\nH-woa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the enunciation of the aspirate, Fuddy-Duddy, the incapable terrapin,\r\ncame to a dead halt, and before the vowel had died away up the ravine had\r\nfolded up all his eight legs and lain down in the dusty road, regardless\r\nof the effect upon his derned skin.  The queer little man slid off his\r\nseat to the ground and started up the dell without deigning to look back\r\nto see if I was following.  But I was.\r\n\r\nIt was about the same season of the year, and at near the same hour of\r\nthe day, of my last visit.  The jays clamored loudly, and the trees\r\nwhispered darkly, as before; and I somehow traced in the two sounds a\r\nfanciful analogy to the open boastfulness of Mr. Jo. Dunfer\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and\r\nthe mysterious reticence of his manner, and to the mingled hardihood and\r\ntenderness of his sole literary production\xe2\x80\x94the epitaph.  All things in\r\nthe valley seemed unchanged, excepting the cow-path, which was almost\r\nwholly overgrown with weeds.  When we came out into the \xe2\x80\x9cclearing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhowever, there was change enough.  Among the stumps and trunks of the\r\nfallen saplings, those that had been hacked \xe2\x80\x9cChina fashion\xe2\x80\x9d were no\r\nlonger distinguishable from those that were cut \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Melican way.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was\r\nas if the Old-World barbarism and the New-World civilization had\r\nreconciled their differences by the arbitration of an impartial decay\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nis the way of civilizations.  The knoll was there, but the Hunnish\r\nbrambles had overrun and all but obliterated its effete grasses; and the\r\npatrician garden-violet had capitulated to his plebeian brother\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\nhad merely reverted to his original type.  Another grave\xe2\x80\x94a long, robust\r\nmound\xe2\x80\x94had been made beside the first, which seemed to shrink from the\r\ncomparison; and in the shadow of a new headstone the old one lay\r\nprostrate, with its marvelous inscription illegible by accumulation of\r\nleaves and soil.  In point of literary merit the new was inferior to the\r\nold\xe2\x80\x94was even repulsive in its terse and savage jocularity:\r\n\r\n                            JO. DUNFER.  DONE FOR.\r\n\r\nI turned from it with indifference, and brushing away the leaves from the\r\ntablet of the dead pagan restored to light the mocking words which, fresh\r\nfrom their long neglect, seemed to have a certain pathos.  My guide, too,\r\nappeared to take on an added seriousness as he read it, and I fancied\r\nthat I could detect beneath his whimsical manner something of manliness,\r\nalmost of dignity.  But while I looked at him his former aspect, so\r\nsubtly inhuman, so tantalizingly familiar, crept back into his big eyes,\r\nrepellant and attractive.  I resolved to make an end of the mystery if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, pointing to the smaller grave, \xe2\x80\x9cdid Jo. Dunfer\r\nmurder that Chinaman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was leaning against a tree and looking across the open space into the\r\ntop of another, or into the blue sky beyond.  He neither withdrew his\r\neyes, nor altered his posture as he slowly replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; he justifiably homicided him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he really did kill him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill \xe2\x80\x99im?  I should say he did, rather.  Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t everybody know that?\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he stan\xe2\x80\x99 up before the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s jury and confess it?  And didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey find a verdict of \xe2\x80\x98Came to \xe2\x80\x99is death by a wholesome Christian\r\nsentiment workin\xe2\x80\x99 in the Caucasian breast\xe2\x80\x99?  An\xe2\x80\x99 didn\xe2\x80\x99t the church at the\r\nHill turn W\xe2\x80\x99isky down for it?  And didn\xe2\x80\x99t the sovereign people elect him\r\nJustice of the Peace to get even on the gospelers?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where\r\nyou were brought up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut did Jo. do that because the Chinaman did not, or would n\xe2\x80\x99ot, learn\r\nto cut down trees like a white man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure!\xe2\x80\x94it stan\xe2\x80\x99s so on the record, which makes it true an\xe2\x80\x99 legal.  My\r\nknowin\xe2\x80\x99 better doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference with legal truth; it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\nfuneral and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t invited to deliver an oration.  But the fact is,\r\nW\xe2\x80\x99isky was jealous o\xe2\x80\x99 _me_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the little wretch actually swelled out\r\nlike a turkeycock and made a pretense of adjusting an imaginary neck-tie,\r\nnoting the effect in the palm of his hand, held up before him to\r\nrepresent a mirror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJealous of _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated with ill-mannered astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I said.  Why not?\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t I look all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe assumed a mocking attitude of studied grace, and twitched the wrinkles\r\nout of his threadbare waistcoat.  Then, suddenly dropping his voice to a\r\nlow pitch of singular sweetness, he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99isky thought a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 that Chink; nobody but me knew how \xe2\x80\x99e doted on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99im.  Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear \xe2\x80\x99im out of \xe2\x80\x99is sight, the derned protoplasm!  And\r\nw\xe2\x80\x99en \xe2\x80\x99e came down to this clear-in\xe2\x80\x99 one day an\xe2\x80\x99 found him an\xe2\x80\x99 me\r\nneglectin\xe2\x80\x99 our work\xe2\x80\x94him asleep an\xe2\x80\x99 me grapplin a tarantula out of \xe2\x80\x99is\r\nsleeve\xe2\x80\x94W\xe2\x80\x99isky laid hold of my axe and let us have it, good an\xe2\x80\x99 hard!  I\r\ndodged just then, for the spider bit me, but Ah Wee got it bad in the\r\nside an\xe2\x80\x99 tumbled about like anything.  W\xe2\x80\x99isky was just weigh-in\xe2\x80\x99 me out\r\none w\xe2\x80\x99en \xe2\x80\x99e saw the spider fastened on my finger; then \xe2\x80\x99e knew he\xe2\x80\x99d made\r\na jack ass of \xe2\x80\x99imself.  He threw away the axe and got down on \xe2\x80\x99is knees\r\nalongside of Ah Wee, who gave a last little kick and opened \xe2\x80\x99is eyes\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhad eyes like mine\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 puttin\xe2\x80\x99 up \xe2\x80\x99is hands drew down W\xe2\x80\x99isky\xe2\x80\x99s ugly head\r\nand held it there w\xe2\x80\x99ile \xe2\x80\x99e stayed.  That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long, for a tremblin\xe2\x80\x99 ran\r\nthrough \xe2\x80\x99im and \xe2\x80\x99e gave a bit of a moan an\xe2\x80\x99 beat the game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the story the narrator had become transfigured.\r\nThe comic, or rather, the sardonic element was all out of him, and as he\r\npainted that strange scene it was with difficulty that I kept my\r\ncomposure.  And this consummate actor had somehow so managed me that the\r\nsympathy due to his _dramatis person\xc3\xa6_ was given to himself.  I stepped\r\nforward to grasp his hand, when suddenly a broad grin danced across his\r\nface and with a light, mocking laugh he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99en W\xe2\x80\x99isky got \xe2\x80\x99is nut out o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x99e was a sight to see!  All his fine\r\nclothes\xe2\x80\x94he dressed mighty blindin\xe2\x80\x99 those days\xe2\x80\x94were spoiled everlastin\xe2\x80\x99!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Is hair was towsled and his face\xe2\x80\x94what I could see of it\xe2\x80\x94was whiter than\r\nthe ace of lilies.  \xe2\x80\x99E stared once at me, and looked away as if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncount; an\xe2\x80\x99 then there were shootin\xe2\x80\x99 pains chasin\xe2\x80\x99 one another from my\r\nbitten finger into my head, and it was Gopher to the dark.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the inquest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did you hold your tongue afterward?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s that kind of tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and not another word would he say\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that W\xe2\x80\x99isky took to drinkin\xe2\x80\x99 harder an\xe2\x80\x99 harder, and was rabider\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 rabider anti-coolie, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think \xe2\x80\x99e was ever particularly glad\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x99e dispelled Ah Wee.  He didn\xe2\x80\x99t put on so much dog about it w\xe2\x80\x99en we\r\nwere alone as w\xe2\x80\x99en he had the ear of a derned Spectacular Extravaganza\r\nlike you.  \xe2\x80\x99E put up that headstone and gouged the inscription accordin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto his varyin\xe2\x80\x99 moods.  It took \xe2\x80\x99im three weeks, workin\xe2\x80\x99 between drinks.\r\nI gouged his in one day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did Jo. die?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked rather absently.  The answer took my breath:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty soon after I looked at him through that knot-hole, w\xe2\x80\x99en you had\r\nput something in his w\xe2\x80\x99isky, you derned Borgia!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRecovering somewhat from my surprise at this astounding charge, I was\r\nhalf-minded to throttle the audacious accuser, but was restrained by a\r\nsudden conviction that came to me in the light of a revelation.  I fixed\r\na grave look upon him and asked, as calmly as I could: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when did you\r\ngo luny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine years ago!\xe2\x80\x9d he shrieked, throwing out his clenched hands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnine\r\nyears ago, w\xe2\x80\x99en that big brute killed the woman who loved him better than\r\nshe did me!\xe2\x80\x94me who had followed \xe2\x80\x99er from San Francisco, where \xe2\x80\x99e won \xe2\x80\x99er\r\nat draw poker!\xe2\x80\x94me who had watched over \xe2\x80\x99er for years w\xe2\x80\x99en the scoundrel\r\nshe belonged to was ashamed to acknowledge \xe2\x80\x99er and treat \xe2\x80\x99er white!\xe2\x80\x94me\r\nwho for her sake kept \xe2\x80\x99is cussed secret till it ate \xe2\x80\x99im up!\xe2\x80\x94me who w\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nyou poisoned the beast fulfilled \xe2\x80\x99is last request to lay \xe2\x80\x99im alongside\r\n\xe2\x80\x99er and give \xe2\x80\x99im a stone to the head of \xe2\x80\x99im!  And I\xe2\x80\x99ve never since seen\r\n\xe2\x80\x99er grave till now, for I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to meet \xe2\x80\x99im here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet him?  Why, Gopher, my poor fellow, he is dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of \xe2\x80\x99im.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed the little wretch back to his wagon and wrung his hand at\r\nparting.  It was now nightfall, and as I stood there at the roadside in\r\nthe deepening gloom, watching the blank outlines of the receding wagon, a\r\nsound was borne to me on the evening wind\xe2\x80\x94a sound as of a series of\r\nvigorous thumps\xe2\x80\x94and a voice came out of the night:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee-up, there, you derned old Geranium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JUG OF SIRUP\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS narrative begins with the death of its hero.  Silas Deemer died on\r\nthe 16th day of July, 1863, and two days later his remains were buried.\r\nAs he had been personally known to every man, woman and well-grown child\r\nin the village, the funeral, as the local newspaper phrased it, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nlargely attended.\xe2\x80\x9d  In accordance with a custom of the time and place,\r\nthe coffin was opened at the graveside and the entire assembly of friends\r\nand neighbors filed past, taking a last look at the face of the dead.\r\nAnd then, before the eyes of all, Silas Deemer was put into the ground.\r\nSome of the eyes were a trifle dim, but in a general way it may be said\r\nthat at that interment there was lack of neither observance nor\r\nobservation; Silas was indubitably dead, and none could have pointed out\r\nany ritual delinquency that would have justified him in coming back from\r\nthe grave.  Yet if human testimony is good for anything (and certainly it\r\nonce put an end to witchcraft in and about Salem) he came back.\r\n\r\nI forgot to state that the death and burial of Silas Deemer occurred in\r\nthe little village of Hillbrook, where he had lived for thirty-one years.\r\nHe had been what is known in some parts of the Union (which is admittedly\r\na free country) as a \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d; that is to say, he kept a retail shop\r\nfor the sale of such things as are commonly sold in shops of that\r\ncharacter.  His honesty had never been questioned, so far as is known,\r\nand he was held in high esteem by all.  The only thing that could be\r\nurged against him by the most censorious was a too close attention to\r\nbusiness.  It was not urged against him, though many another, who\r\nmanifested it in no greater degree, was less leniently judged.  The\r\nbusiness to which Silas was devoted was mostly his own\xe2\x80\x94that, possibly,\r\nmay have made a difference.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Deemer\xe2\x80\x99s death nobody could recollect a single day,\r\nSundays excepted, that he had not passed in his \xe2\x80\x9cstore,\xe2\x80\x9d since he had\r\nopened it more than a quarter-century before.  His health having been\r\nperfect during all that time, he had been unable to discern any validity\r\nin whatever may or might have been urged to lure him astray from his\r\ncounter and it is related that once when he was summoned to the county\r\nseat as a witness in an important law case and did not attend, the lawyer\r\nwho had the hardihood to move that he be \xe2\x80\x9cadmonished\xe2\x80\x9d was solemnly\r\ninformed that the Court regarded the proposal with \xe2\x80\x9csurprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Judicial\r\nsurprise being an emotion that attorneys are not commonly ambitious to\r\narouse, the motion was hastily withdrawn and an agreement with the other\r\nside effected as to what Mr. Deemer would have said if he had been\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94the other side pushing its advantage to the extreme and making the\r\nsupposititious testimony distinctly damaging to the interests of its\r\nproponents.  In brief, it was the general feeling in all that region that\r\nSilas Deemer was the one immobile verity of Hillbrook, and that his\r\ntranslation in space would precipitate some dismal public ill or\r\nstrenuous calamity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Deemer and two grown daughters occupied the upper rooms of the\r\nbuilding, but Silas had never been known to sleep elsewhere than on a cot\r\nbehind the counter of the store.  And there, quite by accident, he was\r\nfound one night, dying, and passed away just before the time for taking\r\ndown the shutters.  Though speechless, he appeared conscious, and it was\r\nthought by those who knew him best that if the end had unfortunately been\r\ndelayed beyond the usual hour for opening the store the effect upon him\r\nwould have been deplorable.\r\n\r\nSuch had been Silas Deemer\xe2\x80\x94such the fixity and invariety of his life and\r\nhabit, that the village humorist (who had once attended college) was\r\nmoved to bestow upon him the sobriquet of \xe2\x80\x9cOld Ibidem,\xe2\x80\x9d and, in the first\r\nissue of the local newspaper after the death, to explain without offence\r\nthat Silas had taken \xe2\x80\x9ca day off.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was more than a day, but from the\r\nrecord it appears that well within a month Mr. Deemer made it plain that\r\nhe had not the leisure to be dead.\r\n\r\nOne of Hillbrook\xe2\x80\x99s most respected citizens was Alvan Creede, a banker.\r\nHe lived in the finest house in town, kept a carriage and was a most\r\nestimable man variously.  He knew something of the advantages of travel,\r\ntoo, having been frequently in Boston, and once, it was thought, in New\r\nYork, though he modestly disclaimed that glittering distinction.  The\r\nmatter is mentioned here merely as a contribution to an understanding of\r\nMr. Creede\xe2\x80\x99s worth, for either way it is creditable to him\xe2\x80\x94to his\r\nintelligence if he had put himself, even temporarily, into contact with\r\nmetropolitan culture; to his candor if he had not.\r\n\r\nOne pleasant summer evening at about the hour of ten Mr. Creede, entering\r\nat his garden gate, passed up the gravel walk, which looked very white in\r\nthe moonlight, mounted the stone steps of his fine house and pausing a\r\nmoment inserted his latchkey in the door.  As he pushed this open he met\r\nhis wife, who was crossing the passage from the parlor to the library.\r\nShe greeted him pleasantly and pulling the door further back held it for\r\nhim to enter.  Instead he turned and, looking about his feet in front of\r\nthe threshold, uttered an exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x94what the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chas become of that jug?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat jug, Alvan?\xe2\x80\x9d his wife inquired, not very sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA jug of maple sirup\xe2\x80\x94I brought it along from the store and set it down\r\nhere to open the door.  What the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, Alvan, please don\xe2\x80\x99t swear again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady,\r\ninterrupting.  Hillbrook, by the way, is not the only place in\r\nChristendom where a vestigial polytheism forbids the taking in vain of\r\nthe Evil One\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nThe jug of maple sirup which the easy ways of village life had permitted\r\nHillbrook\xe2\x80\x99s foremost citizen to carry home from the store was not there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure, Alvan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, do you suppose a man does not know when he is carrying a jug?\r\nI bought that sirup at Deemer\xe2\x80\x99s as I was passing.  Deemer himself drew it\r\nand lent me the jug, and I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sentence remains to this day unfinished.  Mr. Creede staggered into\r\nthe house, entered the parlor and dropped into an armchair, trembling in\r\nevery limb.  He had suddenly remembered that Silas Deemer was three weeks\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nMrs. Creede stood by her husband, regarding him with surprise and\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat ails you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Creede\xe2\x80\x99s ailment having no obvious relation to the interests of the\r\nbetter land he did not apparently deem it necessary to expound it on that\r\ndemand; he said nothing\xe2\x80\x94merely stared.  There were long moments of\r\nsilence broken by nothing but the measured ticking of the clock, which\r\nseemed somewhat slower than usual, as if it were civilly granting them an\r\nextension of time in which to recover their wits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane, I have gone mad\xe2\x80\x94that is it.\xe2\x80\x9d  He spoke thickly and hurriedly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have told me; you must have observed my symptoms before they\r\nbecame so pronounced that I have observed them myself.  I thought I was\r\npassing Deemer\xe2\x80\x99s store; it was open and lit up\xe2\x80\x94that is what I thought; of\r\ncourse it is never open now.  Silas Deemer stood at his desk behind the\r\ncounter.  My God, Jane, I saw him as distinctly as I see you.\r\nRemembering that you had said you wanted some maple sirup, I went in and\r\nbought some\xe2\x80\x94that is all\xe2\x80\x94I bought two quarts of maple sirup from Silas\r\nDeemer, who is dead and underground, but nevertheless drew that sirup\r\nfrom a cask and handed it to me in a jug.  He talked with me, too, rather\r\ngravely, I remember, even more so than was his way, but not a word of\r\nwhat he said can I now recall.  But I saw him\xe2\x80\x94good Lord, I saw and talked\r\nwith him\xe2\x80\x94and he is dead!  So I thought, but I\xe2\x80\x99m mad, Jane, I\xe2\x80\x99m as crazy\r\nas a beetle; and you have kept it from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis monologue gave the woman time to collect what faculties she had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlvan,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have given no evidence of insanity, believe me.\r\nThis was undoubtedly an illusion\xe2\x80\x94how should it be anything else?  That\r\nwould be too terrible!  But there is no insanity; you are working too\r\nhard at the bank.  You should not have attended the meeting of directors\r\nthis evening; any one could see that you were ill; I knew something would\r\noccur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may have seemed to him that the prophecy had lagged a bit, awaiting\r\nthe event, but he said nothing of that, being concerned with his own\r\ncondition.  He was calm now, and could think coherently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless the phenomenon was subjective,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a somewhat\r\nludicrous transition to the slang of science.  \xe2\x80\x9cGranting the possibility\r\nof spiritual apparition and even materialization, yet the apparition and\r\nmaterialization of a half-gallon brown clay jug\xe2\x80\x94a piece of coarse, heavy\r\npottery evolved from nothing\xe2\x80\x94that is hardly thinkable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he finished speaking, a child ran into the room\xe2\x80\x94his little daughter.\r\nShe was clad in a bedgown.  Hastening to her father she threw her arms\r\nabout his neck, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou naughty papa, you forgot to come in and kiss\r\nme.  We heard you open the gate and got up and looked out.  And, papa\r\ndear, Eddy says mayn\xe2\x80\x99t he have the little jug when it is empty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the full import of that revelation imparted itself to Alvan Creede\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunderstanding he visibly shuddered.  For the child could not have heard a\r\nword of the conversation.\r\n\r\nThe estate of Silas Deemer being in the hands of an administrator who had\r\nthought it best to dispose of the \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d the store had been closed\r\never since the owner\xe2\x80\x99s death, the goods having been removed by another\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d who had purchased them _en bloc_.  The rooms above were vacant\r\nas well, for the widow and daughters had gone to another town.\r\n\r\nOn the evening immediately after Alvan Creede\xe2\x80\x99s adventure (which had\r\nsomehow \xe2\x80\x9cgot out\xe2\x80\x9d) a crowd of men, women and children thronged the\r\nsidewalk opposite the store.  That the place was haunted by the spirit of\r\nthe late Silas Deemer was now well known to every resident of Hillbrook,\r\nthough many affected disbelief.  Of these the hardiest, and in a general\r\nway the youngest, threw stones against the front of the building, the\r\nonly part accessible, but carefully missed the unshuttered windows.\r\nIncredulity had not grown to malice.  A few venturesome souls crossed the\r\nstreet and rattled the door in its frame; struck matches and held them\r\nnear the window; attempted to view the black interior.  Some of the\r\nspectators invited attention to their wit by shouting and groaning and\r\nchallenging the ghost to a footrace.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable time had elapsed without any manifestation, and many\r\nof the crowd had gone away, all those remaining began to observe that the\r\ninterior of the store was suffused with a dim, yellow light.  At this all\r\ndemonstrations ceased; the intrepid souls about the door and windows fell\r\nback to the opposite side of the street and were merged in the crowd; the\r\nsmall boys ceased throwing stones.  Nobody spoke above his breath; all\r\nwhispered excitedly and pointed to the now steadily growing light.  How\r\nlong a time had passed since the first faint glow had been observed none\r\ncould have guessed, but eventually the illumination was bright enough to\r\nreveal the whole interior of the store; and there, standing at his desk\r\nbehind the counter, Silas Deemer was distinctly visible!\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the crowd was marvelous.  It began rapidly to melt away\r\nat both flanks, as the timid left the place.  Many ran as fast as their\r\nlegs would let them; others moved off with greater dignity, turning\r\noccasionally to look backward over the shoulder.  At last a score or\r\nmore, mostly men, remained where they were, speechless, staring, excited.\r\nThe apparition inside gave them no attention; it was apparently occupied\r\nwith a book of accounts.\r\n\r\nPresently three men left the crowd on the sidewalk as if by a common\r\nimpulse and crossed the street.  One of them, a heavy man, was about to\r\nset his shoulder against the door when it opened, apparently without\r\nhuman agency, and the courageous investigators passed in.  No sooner had\r\nthey crossed the threshold than they were seen by the awed observers\r\noutside to be acting in the most unaccountable way.  They thrust out\r\ntheir hands before them, pursued devious courses, came into violent\r\ncollision with the counter, with boxes and barrels on the floor, and with\r\none another.  They turned awkwardly hither and thither and seemed trying\r\nto escape, but unable to retrace their steps.  Their voices were heard in\r\nexclamations and curses.  But in no way did the apparition of Silas\r\nDeemer manifest an interest in what was going on.\r\n\r\nBy what impulse the crowd was moved none ever recollected, but the entire\r\nmass\xe2\x80\x94men, women, children, dogs\xe2\x80\x94made a simultaneous and tumultuous rush\r\nfor the entrance.  They congested the doorway, pushing for\r\nprecedence\xe2\x80\x94resolving themselves at length into a line and moving up step\r\nby step.  By some subtle spiritual or physical alchemy observation had\r\nbeen transmuted into action\xe2\x80\x94the sightseers had become participants in the\r\nspectacle\xe2\x80\x94the audience had usurped the stage.\r\n\r\nTo the only spectator remaining on the other side of the street\xe2\x80\x94Alvan\r\nCreede, the banker\xe2\x80\x94the interior of the store with its inpouring crowd\r\ncontinued in full illumination; all the strange things going on there\r\nwere clearly visible.  To those inside all was black darkness.  It was as\r\nif each person as he was thrust in at the door had been stricken blind,\r\nand was maddened by the mischance.  They groped with aimless imprecision,\r\ntried to force their way out against the current, pushed and elbowed,\r\nstruck at random, fell and were trampled, rose and trampled in their\r\nturn.  They seized one another by the garments, the hair, the\r\nbeard\xe2\x80\x94fought like animals, cursed, shouted, called one another\r\nopprobrious and obscene names.  When, finally, Alvan Creede had seen the\r\nlast person of the line pass into that awful tumult the light that had\r\nilluminated it was suddenly quenched and all was as black to him as to\r\nthose within.  He turned away and left the place.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning a curious crowd had gathered about \xe2\x80\x9cDeemer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d  It\r\nwas composed partly of those who had run away the night before, but now\r\nhad the courage of sunshine, partly of honest folk going to their daily\r\ntoil.  The door of the store stood open; the place was vacant, but on the\r\nwalls, the floor, the furniture, were shreds of clothing and tangles of\r\nhair.  Hillbrook militant had managed somehow to pull itself out and had\r\ngone home to medicine its hurts and swear that it had been all night in\r\nbed.  On the dusty desk, behind the counter, was the sales-book.  The\r\nentries in it, in Deemer\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, had ceased on the 16th day of\r\nJuly, the last of his life.  There was no record of a later sale to Alvan\r\nCreede.\r\n\r\nThat is the entire story\xe2\x80\x94except that men\xe2\x80\x99s passions having subsided and\r\nreason having resumed its immemorial sway, it was confessed in Hillbrook\r\nthat, considering the harmless and honorable character of his first\r\ncommercial transaction under the new conditions, Silas Deemer, deceased,\r\nmight properly have been suffered to resume business at the old stand\r\nwithout mobbing.  In that judgment the local historian from whose\r\nunpublished work these facts are compiled had the thoughtfulness to\r\nsignify his concurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTALEY FLEMING\xe2\x80\x99S HALLUCINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOF two men who were talking one was a physician.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent for you, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can do\r\nme any good.  May be you can recommend a specialist in psychopathy.  I\r\nfancy I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit loony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look all right,\xe2\x80\x9d the physician said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall judge\xe2\x80\x94I have hallucinations.  I wake every night and see in my\r\nroom, intently watching me, a big black Newfoundland dog with a white\r\nforefoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you wake; are you sure about that?  \xe2\x80\x98Hallucinations\xe2\x80\x99 are\r\nsometimes only dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wake, all right.  Sometimes I lie still a long time, looking at\r\nthe dog as earnestly as the dog looks at me\xe2\x80\x94I always leave the light\r\ngoing.  When I can\xe2\x80\x99t endure it any longer I sit up in bed\xe2\x80\x94and nothing is\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99M, \xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94what is the beast\xe2\x80\x99s expression?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me sinister.  Of course I know that, except in art, an\r\nanimal\xe2\x80\x99s face in repose has always the same expression.  But this is not\r\na real animal.  Newfoundland dogs are pretty mild looking, you know;\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with this one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, my diagnosis would have no value: I am not going to treat the\r\ndog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe physician laughed at his own pleasantry, but narrowly watched his\r\npatient from the corner of his eye.  Presently he said: \xe2\x80\x9cFleming, your\r\ndescription of the beast fits the dog of the late Atwell Barton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFleming half-rose from his chair, sat again and made a visible attempt at\r\nindifference.  \xe2\x80\x9cI remember Barton,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI believe he was\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nreported that\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there something suspicious in his death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking squarely now into the eyes of his patient, the physician said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree years ago the body of your old enemy, Atwell Barton, was found in\r\nthe woods near his house and yours.  He had been stabbed to death.  There\r\nhave been no arrests; there was no clew.  Some of us had \xe2\x80\x98theories.\xe2\x80\x99  I\r\nhad one.  Have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?  Why, bless your soul, what could I know about it?  You remember that\r\nI left for Europe almost immediately afterward\xe2\x80\x94a considerable time\r\nafterward.  In the few weeks since my return you could not expect me to\r\nconstruct a \xe2\x80\x98theory.\xe2\x80\x99  In fact, I have not given the matter a thought.\r\nWhat about his dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was first to find the body.  It died of starvation on his grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe do not know the inexorable law underlying coincidences.  Staley\r\nFleming did not, or he would perhaps not have sprung to his feet as the\r\nnight wind brought in through the open window the long wailing howl of a\r\ndistant dog.  He strode several times across the room in the steadfast\r\ngaze of the physician; then, abruptly confronting him, almost shouted:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has all this to do with my trouble, Dr. Halderman?  You forget why\r\nyou were sent for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRising, the physician laid his hand upon his patient\xe2\x80\x99s arm and said,\r\ngently: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me.  I cannot diagnose your disorder off-hand\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow,\r\nperhaps.  Please go to bed, leaving your door unlocked; I will pass the\r\nnight here with your books.  Can you call me without rising?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is an electric bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood.  If anything disturbs you push the button without sitting up.\r\nGood night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nComfortably installed in an armchair the man of medicine stared into the\r\nglowing coals and thought deeply and long, but apparently to little\r\npurpose, for he frequently rose and opening a door leading to the\r\nstaircase, listened intently; then resumed his seat.  Presently, however,\r\nhe fell asleep, and when he woke it was past midnight.  He stirred the\r\nfailing fire, lifted a book from the table at his side and looked at the\r\ntitle.  It was Denneker\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMeditations.\xe2\x80\x9d  He opened it at random and\r\nbegan to read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForasmuch as it is ordained of God that all flesh hath spirit and\r\nthereby taketh on spiritual powers, so, also, the spirit hath powers of\r\nthe flesh, even when it is gone out of the flesh and liveth as a thing\r\napart, as many a violence performed by wraith and lemure sheweth.  And\r\nthere be who say that man is not single in this, but the beasts have the\r\nlike evil inducement, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reading was interrupted by a shaking of the house, as by the fall of\r\na heavy object.  The reader flung down the book, rushed from the room and\r\nmounted the stairs to Fleming\xe2\x80\x99s bed-chamber.  He tried the door, but\r\ncontrary to his instructions it was locked.  He set his shoulder against\r\nit with such force that it gave way.  On the floor near the disordered\r\nbed, in his night clothes, lay Fleming gasping away his life.\r\n\r\nThe physician raised the dying man\xe2\x80\x99s head from the floor and observed a\r\nwound in the throat.  \xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought of this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, believing\r\nit suicide.\r\n\r\nWhen the man was dead an examination disclosed the unmistakable marks of\r\nan animal\xe2\x80\x99s fangs deeply sunken into the jugular vein.\r\n\r\nBut there was no animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RESUMED IDENTITY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nTHE REVIEW AS A FORM OF WELCOME\r\n\r\n\r\nONE summer night a man stood on a low hill overlooking a wide expanse of\r\nforest and field.  By the full moon hanging low in the west he knew what\r\nhe might not have known otherwise: that it was near the hour of dawn.  A\r\nlight mist lay along the earth, partly veiling the lower features of the\r\nlandscape, but above it the taller trees showed in well-defined masses\r\nagainst a clear sky.  Two or three farmhouses were visible through the\r\nhaze, but in none of them, naturally, was a light.  Nowhere, indeed, was\r\nany sign or suggestion of life except the barking of a distant dog,\r\nwhich, repeated with mechanical iteration, served rather to accentuate\r\nthan dispel the loneliness of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe man looked curiously about him on all sides, as one who among\r\nfamiliar surroundings is unable to determine his exact place and part in\r\nthe scheme of things.  It is so, perhaps, that we shall act when, risen\r\nfrom the dead, we await the call to judgment.\r\n\r\nA hundred yards away was a straight road, showing white in the moonlight.\r\nEndeavoring to orient himself, as a surveyor or navigator might say, the\r\nman moved his eyes slowly along its visible length and at a distance of a\r\nquarter-mile to the south of his station saw, dim and gray in the haze, a\r\ngroup of horsemen riding to the north.  Behind them were men afoot,\r\nmarching in column, with dimly gleaming rifles aslant above their\r\nshoulders.  They moved slowly and in silence.  Another group of horsemen,\r\nanother regiment of infantry, another and another\xe2\x80\x94all in unceasing motion\r\ntoward the man\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, past it, and beyond.  A battery of\r\nartillery followed, the cannoneers riding with folded arms on limber and\r\ncaisson.  And still the interminable procession came out of the obscurity\r\nto south and passed into the obscurity to north, with never a sound of\r\nvoice, nor hoof, nor wheel.\r\n\r\nThe man could not rightly understand: he thought himself deaf; said so,\r\nand heard his own voice, although it had an unfamiliar quality that\r\nalmost alarmed him; it disappointed his ear\xe2\x80\x99s expectancy in the matter of\r\n_timbre_ and resonance.  But he was not deaf, and that for the moment\r\nsufficed.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered that there are natural phenomena to which some one has\r\ngiven the name \xe2\x80\x9cacoustic shadows.\xe2\x80\x9d  If you stand in an acoustic shadow\r\nthere is one direction from which you will hear nothing.  At the battle\r\nof Gaines\xe2\x80\x99s Mill, one of the fiercest conflicts of the Civil War, with a\r\nhundred guns in play, spectators a mile and a half away on the opposite\r\nside of the Chickahominy valley heard nothing of what they clearly saw.\r\nThe bombardment of Port Royal, heard and felt at St. Augustine, a hundred\r\nand fifty miles to the south, was inaudible two miles to the north in a\r\nstill atmosphere.  A few days before the surrender at Appomattox a\r\nthunderous engagement between the commands of Sheridan and Pickett was\r\nunknown to the latter commander, a mile in the rear of his own line.\r\n\r\nThese instances were not known to the man of whom we write, but less\r\nstriking ones of the same character had not escaped his observation.  He\r\nwas profoundly disquieted, but for another reason than the uncanny\r\nsilence of that moonlight march.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself\xe2\x80\x94and again it was as if another had spoken\r\nhis thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif those people are what I take them to be we have lost the\r\nbattle and they are moving on Nashville!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen came a thought of self\xe2\x80\x94an apprehension\xe2\x80\x94a strong sense of personal\r\nperil, such as in another we call fear.  He stepped quickly into the\r\nshadow of a tree.  And still the silent battalions moved slowly forward\r\nin the haze.\r\n\r\nThe chill of a sudden breeze upon the back of his neck drew his attention\r\nto the quarter whence it came, and turning to the east he saw a faint\r\ngray light along the horizon\xe2\x80\x94the first sign of returning day.  This\r\nincreased his apprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must get away from here,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cor I shall be discovered and\r\ntaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved out of the shadow, walking rapidly toward the graying east.\r\nFrom the safer seclusion of a clump of cedars he looked back.  The entire\r\ncolumn had passed out of sight: the straight white road lay bare and\r\ndesolate in the moonlight!\r\n\r\nPuzzled before, he was now inexpressibly astonished.  So swift a passing\r\nof so slow an army!\xe2\x80\x94he could not comprehend it.  Minute after minute\r\npassed unnoted; he had lost his sense of time.  He sought with a terrible\r\nearnestness a solution of the mystery, but sought in vain.  When at last\r\nhe roused himself from his abstraction the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rim was visible above\r\nthe hills, but in the new conditions he found no other light than that of\r\nday; his understanding was involved as darkly in doubt as before.\r\n\r\nOn every side lay cultivated fields showing no sign of war and war\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nravages.  From the chimneys of the farmhouses thin ascensions of blue\r\nsmoke signaled preparations for a day\xe2\x80\x99s peaceful toil.  Having stilled\r\nits immemorial allocution to the moon, the watch-dog was assisting a\r\nnegro who, prefixing a team of mules to the plow, was flatting and\r\nsharping contentedly at his task.  The hero of this tale stared stupidly\r\nat the pastoral picture as if he had never seen such a thing in all his\r\nlife; then he put his hand to his head, passed it through his hair and,\r\nwithdrawing it, attentively considered the palm\xe2\x80\x94a singular thing to do.\r\nApparently reassured by the act, he walked confidently toward the road.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nWHEN YOU HAVE LOST YOUR LIFE CONSULT A PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Stilling Malson, of Murfreesboro, having visited a patient six or\r\nseven miles away, on the Nashville road, had remained with him all night.\r\nAt daybreak he set out for home on horseback, as was the custom of\r\ndoctors of the time and region.  He had passed into the neighborhood of\r\nStone\xe2\x80\x99s River battlefield when a man approached him from the roadside and\r\nsaluted in the military fashion, with a movement of the right hand to the\r\nhat-brim.  But the hat was not a military hat, the man was not in uniform\r\nand had not a martial bearing.  The doctor nodded civilly, half thinking\r\nthat the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s uncommon greeting was perhaps in deference to the\r\nhistoric surroundings.  As the stranger evidently desired speech with him\r\nhe courteously reined in his horse and waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9calthough a civilian, you are perhaps an\r\nenemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a physician,\xe2\x80\x9d was the non-committal reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am a lieutenant, of the staff of General\r\nHazen.\xe2\x80\x9d  He paused a moment and looked sharply at the person whom he was\r\naddressing, then added, \xe2\x80\x9cOf the Federal army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe physician merely nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the other, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has happened here.  Where\r\nare the armies?  Which has won the battle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe physician regarded his questioner curiously with half-shut eyes.\r\nAfter a professional scrutiny, prolonged to the limit of politeness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cone asking information should be willing to impart\r\nit.  Are you wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot seriously\xe2\x80\x94it seems.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man removed the unmilitary hat, put his hand to his head, passed it\r\nthrough his hair and, withdrawing it, attentively considered the palm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was struck by a bullet and have been unconscious.  It must have been a\r\nlight, glancing blow: I find no blood and feel no pain.  I will not\r\ntrouble you for treatment, but will you kindly direct me to my command\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nany part of the Federal army\xe2\x80\x94if you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the doctor did not immediately reply: he was recalling much that is\r\nrecorded in the books of his profession\xe2\x80\x94something about lost identity and\r\nthe effect of familiar scenes in restoring it.  At length he looked the\r\nman in the face, smiled, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant, you are not wearing the uniform of your rank and service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this the man glanced down at his civilian attire, lifted his eyes, and\r\nsaid with hesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true.  I\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill regarding him sharply but not unsympathetically the man of science\r\nbluntly inquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-three\xe2\x80\x94if that has anything to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t look it; I should hardly have guessed you to be just that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was growing impatient.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe need not discuss that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant to know about the army.  Not two hours ago I saw a column of troops\r\nmoving northward on this road.  You must have met them.  Be good enough\r\nto tell me the color of their clothing, which I was unable to make out,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite sure that you saw them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure?  My God, sir, I could have counted them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, really,\xe2\x80\x9d said the physician, with an amusing consciousness of his\r\nown resemblance to the loquacious barber of the Arabian Nights, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is\r\nvery interesting.  I met no troops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man looked at him coldly, as if he had himself observed the likeness\r\nto the barber.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is plain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you do not care to assist\r\nme.  Sir, you may go to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned and strode away, very much at random, across the dewy fields,\r\nhis half-penitent tormentor quietly watching him from his point of\r\nvantage in the saddle till he disappeared beyond an array of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nTHE DANGER OF LOOKING INTO A POOL OF WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the road the man slackened his pace, and now went forward,\r\nrather deviously, with a distinct feeling of fatigue.  He could not\r\naccount for this, though truly the interminable loquacity of that country\r\ndoctor offered itself in explanation.  Seating himself upon a rock, he\r\nlaid one hand upon his knee, back upward, and casually looked at it.  It\r\nwas lean and withered.  He lifted both hands to his face.  It was seamed\r\nand furrowed; he could trace the lines with the tips of his fingers.  How\r\nstrange!\xe2\x80\x94a mere bullet-stroke and a brief unconsciousness should not make\r\none a physical wreck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have been a long time in hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what a\r\nfool I am!  The battle was in December, and it is now summer!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlaughed.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder that fellow thought me an escaped lunatic.  He was\r\nwrong: I am only an escaped patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a little distance a small plot of ground enclosed by a stone wall\r\ncaught his attention.  With no very definite intent he rose and went to\r\nit.  In the center was a square, solid monument of hewn stone.  It was\r\nbrown with age, weather-worn at the angles, spotted with moss and lichen.\r\nBetween the massive blocks were strips of grass the leverage of whose\r\nroots had pushed them apart.  In answer to the challenge of this\r\nambitious structure Time had laid his destroying hand upon it, and it\r\nwould soon be \xe2\x80\x9cone with Nineveh and Tyre.\xe2\x80\x9d  In an inscription on one side\r\nhis eye caught a familiar name.  Shaking with excitement, he craned his\r\nbody across the wall and read:\r\n\r\n                               HAZEN\xe2\x80\x99S BRIGADE\r\n                                      to\r\n                          The Memory of Its Soldiers\r\n                                 who fell at\r\n                         Stone River, Dec. 31, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe man fell back from the wall, faint and sick.  Almost within an arm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlength was a little depression in the earth; it had been filled by a\r\nrecent rain\xe2\x80\x94a pool of clear water.  He crept to it to revive himself,\r\nlifted the upper part of his body on his trembling arms, thrust forward\r\nhis head and saw the reflection of his face, as in a mirror.  He uttered\r\na terrible cry.  His arms gave way; he fell, face downward, into the pool\r\nand yielded up the life that had spanned another life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BABY TRAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nIF you had seen little Jo standing at the street corner in the rain, you\r\nwould hardly have admired him.  It was apparently an ordinary autumn\r\nrainstorm, but the water which fell upon Jo (who was hardly old enough to\r\nbe either just or unjust, and so perhaps did not come under the law of\r\nimpartial distribution) appeared to have some property peculiar to\r\nitself: one would have said it was dark and adhesive\xe2\x80\x94sticky.  But that\r\ncould hardly be so, even in Blackburg, where things certainly did occur\r\nthat were a good deal out of the common.\r\n\r\nFor example, ten or twelve years before, a shower of small frogs had\r\nfallen, as is credibly attested by a contemporaneous chronicle, the\r\nrecord concluding with a somewhat obscure statement to the effect that\r\nthe chronicler considered it good growing-weather for Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nSome years later Blackburg had a fall of crimson snow; it is cold in\r\nBlackburg when winter is on, and the snows are frequent and deep.  There\r\ncan be no doubt of it\xe2\x80\x94the snow in this instance was of the color of blood\r\nand melted into water of the same hue, if water it was, not blood.  The\r\nphenomenon had attracted wide attention, and science had as many\r\nexplanations as there were scientists who knew nothing about it.  But the\r\nmen of Blackburg\xe2\x80\x94men who for many years had lived right there where the\r\nred snow fell, and might be supposed to know a good deal about the\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94shook their heads and said something would come of it.\r\n\r\nAnd something did, for the next summer was made memorable by the\r\nprevalence of a mysterious disease\xe2\x80\x94epidemic, endemic, or the Lord knows\r\nwhat, though the physicians didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94which carried away a full half of the\r\npopulation.  Most of the other half carried themselves away and were slow\r\nto return, but finally came back, and were now increasing and multiplying\r\nas before, but Blackburg had not since been altogether the same.\r\n\r\nOf quite another kind, though equally \xe2\x80\x9cout of the common,\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nincident of Hetty Parlow\xe2\x80\x99s ghost.  Hetty Parlow\xe2\x80\x99s maiden name had been\r\nBrownon, and in Blackburg that meant more than one would think.\r\n\r\nThe Brownons had from time immemorial\xe2\x80\x94from the very earliest of the old\r\ncolonial days\xe2\x80\x94been the leading family of the town.  It was the richest\r\nand it was the best, and Blackburg would have shed the last drop of its\r\nplebeian blood in defense of the Brownon fair fame.  As few of the\r\nfamily\xe2\x80\x99s members had ever been known to live permanently away from\r\nBlackburg, although most of them were educated elsewhere and nearly all\r\nhad traveled, there was quite a number of them.  The men held most of the\r\npublic offices, and the women were foremost in all good works.  Of these\r\nlatter, Hetty was most beloved by reason of the sweetness of her\r\ndisposition, the purity of her character and her singular personal\r\nbeauty.  She married in Boston a young scapegrace named Parlow, and like\r\na good Brownon brought him to Blackburg forthwith and made a man and a\r\ntown councilman of him.  They had a child which they named Joseph and\r\ndearly loved, as was then the fashion among parents in all that region.\r\nThen they died of the mysterious disorder already mentioned, and at the\r\nage of one whole year Joseph set up as an orphan.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Joseph the disease which had cut off his parents did\r\nnot stop at that; it went on and extirpated nearly the whole Brownon\r\ncontingent and its allies by marriage; and those who fled did not return.\r\nThe tradition was broken, the Brownon estates passed into alien hands and\r\nthe only Brownons remaining in that place were underground in Oak Hill\r\nCemetery, where, indeed, was a colony of them powerful enough to resist\r\nthe encroachment of surrounding tribes and hold the best part of the\r\ngrounds.  But about the ghost:\r\n\r\nOne night, about three years after the death of Hetty Parlow, a number of\r\nthe young people of Blackburg were passing Oak Hill Cemetery in a\r\nwagon\xe2\x80\x94if you have been there you will remember that the road to Greenton\r\nruns alongside it on the south.  They had been attending a May Day\r\nfestival at Greenton; and that serves to fix the date.  Altogether there\r\nmay have been a dozen, and a jolly party they were, considering the\r\nlegacy of gloom left by the town\xe2\x80\x99s recent somber experiences.  As they\r\npassed the cemetery the man driving suddenly reined in his team with an\r\nexclamation of surprise.  It was sufficiently surprising, no doubt, for\r\njust ahead, and almost at the roadside, though inside the cemetery, stood\r\nthe ghost of Hetty Parlow.  There could be no doubt of it, for she had\r\nbeen personally known to every youth and maiden in the party.  That\r\nestablished the thing\xe2\x80\x99s identity; its character as ghost was signified by\r\nall the customary signs\xe2\x80\x94the shroud, the long, undone hair, the \xe2\x80\x9cfar-away\r\nlook\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94everything.  This disquieting apparition was stretching out its\r\narms toward the west, as if in supplication for the evening star, which,\r\ncertainly, was an alluring object, though obviously out of reach.  As\r\nthey all sat silent (so the story goes) every member of that party of\r\nmerrymakers\xe2\x80\x94they had merry-made on coffee and lemonade only\xe2\x80\x94distinctly\r\nheard that ghost call the name \xe2\x80\x9cJoey, Joey!\xe2\x80\x9d  A moment later nothing was\r\nthere.  Of course one does not have to believe all that.\r\n\r\nNow, at that moment, as was afterward ascertained, Joey was wandering\r\nabout in the sage-brush on the opposite side of the continent, near\r\nWinnemucca, in the State of Nevada.  He had been taken to that town by\r\nsome good persons distantly related to his dead father, and by them\r\nadopted and tenderly cared for.  But on that evening the poor child had\r\nstrayed from home and was lost in the desert.\r\n\r\nHis after history is involved in obscurity and has gaps which conjecture\r\nalone can fill.  It is known that he was found by a family of Piute\r\nIndians, who kept the little wretch with them for a time and then sold\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94actually sold him for money to a woman on one of the east-bound\r\ntrains, at a station a long way from Winnemucca.  The woman professed to\r\nhave made all manner of inquiries, but all in vain: so, being childless\r\nand a widow, she adopted him herself.  At this point of his career Jo\r\nseemed to be getting a long way from the condition of orphanage; the\r\ninterposition of a multitude of parents between himself and that woeful\r\nstate promised him a long immunity from its disadvantages.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darnell, his newest mother, lived in Cleveland, Ohio.  But her\r\nadopted son did not long remain with her.  He was seen one afternoon by a\r\npoliceman, new to that beat, deliberately toddling away from her house,\r\nand being questioned answered that he was \xe2\x80\x9ca doin\xe2\x80\x99 home.\xe2\x80\x9d  He must have\r\ntraveled by rail, somehow, for three days later he was in the town of\r\nWhiteville, which, as you know, is a long way from Blackburg.  His\r\nclothing was in pretty fair condition, but he was sinfully dirty.  Unable\r\nto give any account of himself he was arrested as a vagrant and sentenced\r\nto imprisonment in the Infants\xe2\x80\x99 Sheltering Home\xe2\x80\x94where he was washed.\r\n\r\nJo ran away from the Infants\xe2\x80\x99 Sheltering Home at Whiteville\xe2\x80\x94just took to\r\nthe woods one day, and the Home knew him no more forever.\r\n\r\nWe find him next, or rather get back to him, standing forlorn in the cold\r\nautumn rain at a suburban street corner in Blackburg; and it seems right\r\nto explain now that the raindrops falling upon him there were really not\r\ndark and gummy; they only failed to make his face and hands less so.  Jo\r\nwas indeed fearfully and wonderfully besmirched, as by the hand of an\r\nartist.  And the forlorn little tramp had no shoes; his feet were bare,\r\nred, and swollen, and when he walked he limped with both legs.  As to\r\nclothing\xe2\x80\x94ah, you would hardly have had the skill to name any single\r\ngarment that he wore, or say by what magic he kept it upon him.  That he\r\nwas cold all over and all through did not admit of a doubt; he knew it\r\nhimself.  Anyone would have been cold there that evening; but, for that\r\nreason, no one else was there.  How Jo came to be there himself, he could\r\nnot for the flickering little life of him have told, even if gifted with\r\na vocabulary exceeding a hundred words.  From the way he stared about him\r\none could have seen that he had not the faintest notion of where (nor\r\nwhy) he was.\r\n\r\nYet he was not altogether a fool in his day and generation; being cold\r\nand hungry, and still able to walk a little by bending his knees very\r\nmuch indeed and putting his feet down toes first, he decided to enter one\r\nof the houses which flanked the street at long intervals and looked so\r\nbright and warm.  But when he attempted to act upon that very sensible\r\ndecision a burly dog came bowsing out and disputed his right.\r\nInexpressibly frightened and believing, no doubt (with some reason, too)\r\nthat brutes without meant brutality within, he hobbled away from all the\r\nhouses, and with gray, wet fields to right of him and gray, wet fields to\r\nleft of him\xe2\x80\x94with the rain half blinding him and the night coming in mist\r\nand darkness, held his way along the road that leads to Greenton.  That\r\nis to say, the road leads those to Greenton who succeed in passing the\r\nOak Hill Cemetery.  A considerable number every year do not.\r\n\r\nJo did not.\r\n\r\nThey found him there the next morning, very wet, very cold, but no longer\r\nhungry.  He had apparently entered the cemetery gate\xe2\x80\x94hoping, perhaps,\r\nthat it led to a house where there was no dog\xe2\x80\x94and gone blundering about\r\nin the darkness, falling over many a grave, no doubt, until he had tired\r\nof it all and given up.  The little body lay upon one side, with one\r\nsoiled cheek upon one soiled hand, the other hand tucked away among the\r\nrags to make it warm, the other cheek washed clean and white at last, as\r\nfor a kiss from one of God\xe2\x80\x99s great angels.  It was observed\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nnothing was thought of it at the time, the body being as yet\r\nunidentified\xe2\x80\x94that the little fellow was lying upon the grave of Hetty\r\nParlow.  The grave, however, had not opened to receive him.  That is a\r\ncircumstance which, without actual irreverence, one may wish had been\r\nordered otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT-DOINGS AT \xe2\x80\x9cDEADMAN\xe2\x80\x99S\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A STORY THAT IS UNTRUE\r\n\r\nIT was a singularly sharp night, and clear as the heart of a diamond.\r\nClear nights have a trick of being keen.  In darkness you may be cold and\r\nnot know it; when you see, you suffer.  This night was bright enough to\r\nbite like a serpent.  The moon was moving mysteriously along behind the\r\ngiant pines crowning the South Mountain, striking a cold sparkle from the\r\ncrusted snow, and bringing out against the black west the ghostly\r\noutlines of the Coast Range, beyond which lay the invisible Pacific.  The\r\nsnow had piled itself, in the open spaces along the bottom of the gulch,\r\ninto long ridges that seemed to heave, and into hills that appeared to\r\ntoss and scatter spray.  The spray was sunlight, twice reflected: dashed\r\nonce from the moon, once from the snow.\r\n\r\nIn this snow many of the shanties of the abandoned mining camp were\r\nobliterated, (a sailor might have said they had gone down) and at\r\nirregular intervals it had overtopped the tall trestles which had once\r\nsupported a river called a flume; for, of course, \xe2\x80\x9cflume\xe2\x80\x9d is _flumen_.\r\nAmong the advantages of which the mountains cannot deprive the\r\ngold-hunter is the privilege of speaking Latin.  He says of his dead\r\nneighbor, \xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone up the flume.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is not a bad way to say, \xe2\x80\x9cHis\r\nlife has returned to the Fountain of Life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile putting on its armor against the assaults of the wind, this snow\r\nhad neglected no coign of vantage.  Snow pursued by the wind is not\r\nwholly unlike a retreating army.  In the open field it ranges itself in\r\nranks and battalions; where it can get a foothold it makes a stand; where\r\nit can take cover it does so.  You may see whole platoons of snow\r\ncowering behind a bit of broken wall.  The devious old road, hewn out of\r\nthe mountain side, was full of it.  Squadron upon squadron had struggled\r\nto escape by this line, when suddenly pursuit had ceased.  A more\r\ndesolate and dreary spot than Deadman\xe2\x80\x99s Gulch in a winter midnight it is\r\nimpossible to imagine.  Yet Mr. Hiram Beeson elected to live there, the\r\nsole inhabitant.\r\n\r\nAway up the side of the North Mountain his little pine-log shanty\r\nprojected from its single pane of glass a long, thin beam of light, and\r\nlooked not altogether unlike a black beetle fastened to the hillside with\r\na bright new pin.  Within it sat Mr. Beeson himself, before a roaring\r\nfire, staring into its hot heart as if he had never before seen such a\r\nthing in all his life.  He was not a comely man.  He was gray; he was\r\nragged and slovenly in his attire; his face was wan and haggard; his eyes\r\nwere too bright.  As to his age, if one had attempted to guess it, one\r\nmight have said forty-seven, then corrected himself and said\r\nseventy-four.  He was really twenty-eight.  Emaciated he was; as much,\r\nperhaps, as he dared be, with a needy undertaker at Bentley\xe2\x80\x99s Flat and a\r\nnew and enterprising coroner at Sonora.  Poverty and zeal are an upper\r\nand a nether millstone.  It is dangerous to make a third in that kind of\r\nsandwich.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Beeson sat there, with his ragged elbows on his ragged knees, his\r\nlean jaws buried in his lean hands, and with no apparent intention of\r\ngoing to bed, he looked as if the slightest movement would tumble him to\r\npieces.  Yet during the last hour he had winked no fewer than three\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp rapping at the door.  A rap at that time of night and\r\nin that weather might have surprised an ordinary mortal who had dwelt two\r\nyears in the gulch without seeing a human face, and could not fail to\r\nknow that the country was impassable; but Mr. Beeson did not so much as\r\npull his eyes out of the coals.  And even when the door was pushed open\r\nhe only shrugged a little more closely into himself, as one does who is\r\nexpecting something that he would rather not see.  You may observe this\r\nmovement in women when, in a mortuary chapel, the coffin is borne up the\r\naisle behind them.\r\n\r\nBut when a long old man in a blanket overcoat, his head tied up in a\r\nhandkerchief and nearly his entire face in a muffler, wearing green\r\ngoggles and with a complexion of glittering whiteness where it could be\r\nseen, strode silently into the room, laying a hard, gloved hand on Mr.\r\nBeeson\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, the latter so far forgot himself as to look up with an\r\nappearance of no small astonishment; whomever he may have been expecting,\r\nhe had evidently not counted on meeting anyone like this.  Nevertheless,\r\nthe sight of this unexpected guest produced in Mr. Beeson the following\r\nsequence: a feeling of astonishment; a sense of gratification; a\r\nsentiment of profound good will.  Rising from his seat, he took the\r\nknotty hand from his shoulder, and shook it up and down with a fervor\r\nquite unaccountable; for in the old man\xe2\x80\x99s aspect was nothing to attract,\r\nmuch to repel.  However, attraction is too general a property for\r\nrepulsion to be without it.  The most attractive object in the world is\r\nthe face we instinctively cover with a cloth.  When it becomes still more\r\nattractive\xe2\x80\x94fascinating\xe2\x80\x94we put seven feet of earth above it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Beeson, releasing the old man\xe2\x80\x99s hand, which fell\r\npassively against his thigh with a quiet clack, \xe2\x80\x9cit is an extremely\r\ndisagreeable night.  Pray be seated; I am very glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Beeson spoke with an easy good breeding that one would hardly have\r\nexpected, considering all things.  Indeed, the contrast between his\r\nappearance and his manner was sufficiently surprising to be one of the\r\ncommonest of social phenomena in the mines.  The old man advanced a step\r\ntoward the fire, glowing cavernously in the green goggles.  Mr. Beeson\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet your life I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Beeson\xe2\x80\x99s elegance was not too refined; it had made reasonable\r\nconcessions to local taste.  He paused a moment, letting his eyes drop\r\nfrom the muffled head of his guest, down along the row of moldy buttons\r\nconfining the blanket overcoat, to the greenish cowhide boots powdered\r\nwith snow, which had begun to melt and run along the floor in little\r\nrills.  He took an inventory of his guest, and appeared satisfied.  Who\r\nwould not have been?  Then he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cheer I can offer you is, unfortunately, in keeping with my\r\nsurroundings; but I shall esteem myself highly favored if it is your\r\npleasure to partake of it, rather than seek better at Bentley\xe2\x80\x99s Flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a singular refinement of hospitable humility Mr. Beeson spoke as if\r\na sojourn in his warm cabin on such a night, as compared with walking\r\nfourteen miles up to the throat in snow with a cutting crust, would be an\r\nintolerable hardship.  By way of reply, his guest unbuttoned the blanket\r\novercoat.  The host laid fresh fuel on the fire, swept the hearth with\r\nthe tail of a wolf, and added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ think you\xe2\x80\x99d better skedaddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man took a seat by the fire, spreading his broad soles to the\r\nheat without removing his hat.  In the mines the hat is seldom removed\r\nexcept when the boots are.  Without further remark Mr. Beeson also seated\r\nhimself in a chair which had been a barrel, and which, retaining much of\r\nits original character, seemed to have been designed with a view to\r\npreserving his dust if it should please him to crumble.  For a moment\r\nthere was silence; then, from somewhere among the pines, came the\r\nsnarling yelp of a coyote; and simultaneously the door rattled in its\r\nframe.  There was no other connection between the two incidents than that\r\nthe coyote has an aversion to storms, and the wind was rising; yet there\r\nseemed somehow a kind of supernatural conspiracy between the two, and Mr.\r\nBeeson shuddered with a vague sense of terror.  He recovered himself in a\r\nmoment and again addressed his guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are strange doings here.  I will tell you everything, and then if\r\nyou decide to go I shall hope to accompany you over the worst of the way;\r\nas far as where Baldy Peterson shot Ben Hike\xe2\x80\x94I dare say you know the\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded emphatically, as intimating not merely that he did,\r\nbut that he did indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Beeson, \xe2\x80\x9cI, with two companions, occupied this\r\nhouse; but when the rush to the Flat occurred we left, along with the\r\nrest.  In ten hours the Gulch was deserted.  That evening, however, I\r\ndiscovered I had left behind me a valuable pistol (that is it) and\r\nreturned for it, passing the night here alone, as I have passed every\r\nnight since.  I must explain that a few days before we left, our Chinese\r\ndomestic had the misfortune to die while the ground was frozen so hard\r\nthat it was impossible to dig a grave in the usual way.  So, on the day\r\nof our hasty departure, we cut through the floor there, and gave him such\r\nburial as we could.  But before putting him down I had the extremely bad\r\ntaste to cut off his pigtail and spike it to that beam above his grave,\r\nwhere you may see it at this moment, or, preferably, when warmth has\r\ngiven you leisure for observation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stated, did I not, that the Chinaman came to his death from natural\r\ncauses?  I had, of course, nothing to do with that, and returned through\r\nno irresistible attraction, or morbid fascination, but only because I had\r\nforgotten a pistol.  This is clear to you, is it not, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitor nodded gravely.  He appeared to be a man of few words, if\r\nany.  Mr. Beeson continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the Chinese faith, a man is like a kite: he cannot go to\r\nheaven without a tail.  Well, to shorten this tedious story\xe2\x80\x94which,\r\nhowever, I thought it my duty to relate\xe2\x80\x94on that night, while I was here\r\nalone and thinking of anything but him, that Chinaman came back for his\r\npigtail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. Beeson relapsed into blank silence.  Perhaps he was\r\nfatigued by the unwonted exercise of speaking; perhaps he had conjured up\r\na memory that demanded his undivided attention.  The wind was now fairly\r\nabroad, and the pines along the mountainside sang with singular\r\ndistinctness.  The narrator continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you do not see much in that, and I must confess I do not myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he keeps coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another long silence, during which both stared into the fire\r\nwithout the movement of a limb.  Then Mr. Beeson broke out, almost\r\nfiercely, fixing his eyes on what he could see of the impassive face of\r\nhis auditor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it him?  Sir, in this matter I have no intention of troubling\r\nanyone for advice.  You will pardon me, I am sure\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here he became\r\nsingularly persuasive\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut I have ventured to nail that pigtail fast, and\r\nhave assumed the somewhat onerous obligation of guarding it.  So it is\r\nquite impossible to act on your considerate suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you play me for a Modoc?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the sudden ferocity with which he thrust this\r\nindignant remonstrance into the ear of his guest.  It was as if he had\r\nstruck him on the side of the head with a steel gauntlet.  It was a\r\nprotest, but it was a challenge.  To be mistaken for a coward\xe2\x80\x94to be\r\nplayed for a Modoc: these two expressions are one.  Sometimes it is a\r\nChinaman.  Do you play me for a Chinaman? is a question frequently\r\naddressed to the ear of the suddenly dead.\r\n\r\nMr. Beeson\xe2\x80\x99s buffet produced no effect, and after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause,\r\nduring which the wind thundered in the chimney like the sound of clods\r\nupon a coffin, he resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, as you say, it is wearing me out.  I feel that the life of the last\r\ntwo years has been a mistake\xe2\x80\x94a mistake that corrects itself; you see how.\r\nThe grave!  No; there is no one to dig it.  The ground is frozen, too.\r\nBut you are very welcome.  You may say at Bentley\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94but that is not\r\nimportant.  It was very tough to cut: they braid silk into their\r\npigtails.  Kwaagh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Beeson was speaking with his eyes shut, and he wandered.  His last\r\nword was a snore.  A moment later he drew a long breath, opened his eyes\r\nwith an effort, made a single remark, and fell into a deep sleep.  What\r\nhe said was this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are swiping my dust!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the aged stranger, who had not uttered one word since his arrival,\r\narose from his seat and deliberately laid off his outer clothing, looking\r\nas angular in his flannels as the late Signorina Festorazzi, an Irish\r\nwoman, six feet in height, and weighing fifty-six pounds, who used to\r\nexhibit herself in her chemise to the people of San Francisco.  He then\r\ncrept into one of the \xe2\x80\x9cbunks,\xe2\x80\x9d having first placed a revolver in easy\r\nreach, according to the custom of the country.  This revolver he took\r\nfrom a shelf, and it was the one which Mr. Beeson had mentioned as that\r\nfor which he had returned to the Gulch two years before.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Mr. Beeson awoke, and seeing that his guest had retired\r\nhe did likewise.  But before doing so he approached the long, plaited\r\nwisp of pagan hair and gave it a powerful tug, to assure himself that it\r\nwas fast and firm.  The two beds\xe2\x80\x94mere shelves covered with blankets not\r\noverclean\xe2\x80\x94faced each other from opposite sides of the room, the little\r\nsquare trapdoor that had given access to the Chinaman\xe2\x80\x99s grave being\r\nmidway between.  This, by the way, was crossed by a double row of\r\nspike-heads.  In his resistance to the supernatural, Mr. Beeson had not\r\ndisdained the use of material precautions.\r\n\r\nThe fire was now low, the flames burning bluely and petulantly, with\r\noccasional flashes, projecting spectral shadows on the walls\xe2\x80\x94shadows that\r\nmoved mysteriously about, now dividing, now uniting.  The shadow of the\r\npendent queue, however, kept moodily apart, near the roof at the further\r\nend of the room, looking like a note of admiration.  The song of the\r\npines outside had now risen to the dignity of a triumphal hymn.  In the\r\npauses the silence was dreadful.\r\n\r\nIt was during one of these intervals that the trap in the floor began to\r\nlift.  Slowly and steadily it rose, and slowly and steadily rose the\r\nswaddled head of the old man in the bunk to observe it.  Then, with a\r\nclap that shook the house to its foundation, it was thrown clean back,\r\nwhere it lay with its unsightly spikes pointing threateningly upward.\r\nMr. Beeson awoke, and without rising, pressed his fingers into his eyes.\r\nHe shuddered; his teeth chattered.  His guest was now reclining on one\r\nelbow, watching the proceedings with the goggles that glowed like lamps.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a howling gust of wind swooped down the chimney, scattering\r\nashes and smoke in all directions, for a moment obscuring everything.\r\nWhen the firelight again illuminated the room there was seen, sitting\r\ngingerly on the edge of a stool by the hearthside, a swarthy little man\r\nof prepossessing appearance and dressed with faultless taste, nodding to\r\nthe old man with a friendly and engaging smile.  \xe2\x80\x9cFrom San Francisco,\r\nevidently,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mr. Beeson, who having somewhat recovered from his\r\nfright was groping his way to a solution of the evening\xe2\x80\x99s events.\r\n\r\nBut now another actor appeared upon the scene.  Out of the square black\r\nhole in the middle of the floor protruded the head of the departed\r\nChinaman, his glassy eyes turned upward in their angular slits and\r\nfastened on the dangling queue above with a look of yearning unspeakable.\r\nMr. Beeson groaned, and again spread his hands upon his face.  A mild\r\nodor of opium pervaded the place.  The phantom, clad only in a short blue\r\ntunic quilted and silken but covered with grave-mold, rose slowly, as if\r\npushed by a weak spiral spring.  Its knees were at the level of the\r\nfloor, when with a quick upward impulse like the silent leaping of a\r\nflame it grasped the queue with both hands, drew up its body and took the\r\ntip in its horrible yellow teeth.  To this it clung in a seeming frenzy,\r\ngrimacing ghastly, surging and plunging from side to side in its efforts\r\nto disengage its property from the beam, but uttering no sound.  It was\r\nlike a corpse artificially convulsed by means of a galvanic battery.  The\r\ncontrast between its superhuman activity and its silence was no less than\r\nhideous!\r\n\r\nMr. Beeson cowered in his bed.  The swarthy little gentleman uncrossed\r\nhis legs, beat an impatient tattoo with the toe of his boot and consulted\r\na heavy gold watch.  The old man sat erect and quietly laid hold of the\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\nBang!\r\n\r\nLike a body cut from the gallows the Chinaman plumped into the black hole\r\nbelow, carrying his tail in his teeth.  The trapdoor turned over,\r\nshutting down with a snap.  The swarthy little gentleman from San\r\nFrancisco sprang nimbly from his perch, caught something in the air with\r\nhis hat, as a boy catches a butterfly, and vanished into the chimney as\r\nif drawn up by suction.\r\n\r\nFrom away somewhere in the outer darkness floated in through the open\r\ndoor a faint, far cry\xe2\x80\x94a long, sobbing wail, as of a child death-strangled\r\nin the desert, or a lost soul borne away by the Adversary.  It may have\r\nbeen the coyote.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the following spring a party of miners on their way\r\nto new diggings passed along the Gulch, and straying through the deserted\r\nshanties found in one of them the body of Hiram Beeson, stretched upon a\r\nbunk, with a bullet hole through the heart.  The ball had evidently been\r\nfired from the opposite side of the room, for in one of the oaken beams\r\noverhead was a shallow blue dint, where it had struck a knot and been\r\ndeflected downward to the breast of its victim.  Strongly attached to the\r\nsame beam was what appeared to be an end of a rope of braided horsehair,\r\nwhich had been cut by the bullet in its passage to the knot.  Nothing\r\nelse of interest was noted, excepting a suit of moldy and incongruous\r\nclothing, several articles of which were afterward identified by\r\nrespectable witnesses as those in which certain deceased citizens of\r\nDeadman\xe2\x80\x99s had been buried years before.  But it is not easy to understand\r\nhow that could be, unless, indeed, the garments had been worn as a\r\ndisguise by Death himself\xe2\x80\x94which is hardly credible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEYOND THE WALL\r\n\r\n\r\nMANY years ago, on my way from Hongkong to New York, I passed a week in\r\nSan Francisco.  A long time had gone by since I had been in that city,\r\nduring which my ventures in the Orient had prospered beyond my hope; I\r\nwas rich and could afford to revisit my own country to renew my\r\nfriendship with such of the companions of my youth as still lived and\r\nremembered me with the old affection.  Chief of these, I hoped, was Mohun\r\nDampier, an old schoolmate with whom I had held a desultory\r\ncorrespondence which had long ceased, as is the way of correspondence\r\nbetween men.  You may have observed that the indisposition to write a\r\nmerely social letter is in the ratio of the square of the distance\r\nbetween you and your correspondent.  It is a law.\r\n\r\nI remembered Dampier as a handsome, strong young fellow of scholarly\r\ntastes, with an aversion to work and a marked indifference to many of the\r\nthings that the world cares for, including wealth, of which, however, he\r\nhad inherited enough to put him beyond the reach of want.  In his family,\r\none of the oldest and most aristocratic in the country, it was, I think,\r\na matter of pride that no member of it had ever been in trade nor\r\npolitics, nor suffered any kind of distinction.  Mohun was a trifle\r\nsentimental, and had in him a singular element of superstition, which led\r\nhim to the study of all manner of occult subjects, although his sane\r\nmental health safeguarded him against fantastic and perilous faiths.  He\r\nmade daring incursions into the realm of the unreal without renouncing\r\nhis residence in the partly surveyed and charted region of what we are\r\npleased to call certitude.\r\n\r\nThe night of my visit to him was stormy.  The Californian winter was on,\r\nand the incessant rain plashed in the deserted streets, or, lifted by\r\nirregular gusts of wind, was hurled against the houses with incredible\r\nfury.  With no small difficulty my cabman found the right place, away out\r\ntoward the ocean beach, in a sparsely populated suburb.  The dwelling, a\r\nrather ugly one, apparently, stood in the center of its grounds, which as\r\nnearly as I could make out in the gloom were destitute of either flowers\r\nor grass.  Three or four trees, writhing and moaning in the torment of\r\nthe tempest, appeared to be trying to escape from their dismal\r\nenvironment and take the chance of finding a better one out at sea.  The\r\nhouse was a two-story brick structure with a tower, a story higher, at\r\none corner.  In a window of that was the only visible light.  Something\r\nin the appearance of the place made me shudder, a performance that may\r\nhave been assisted by a rill of rain-water down my back as I scuttled to\r\ncover in the doorway.\r\n\r\nIn answer to my note apprising him of my wish to call, Dampier had\r\nwritten, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ring\xe2\x80\x94open the door and come up.\xe2\x80\x9d  I did so.  The\r\nstaircase was dimly lighted by a single gas-jet at the top of the second\r\nflight.  I managed to reach the landing without disaster and entered by\r\nan open door into the lighted square room of the tower.  Dampier came\r\nforward in gown and slippers to receive me, giving me the greeting that I\r\nwished, and if I had held a thought that it might more fitly have been\r\naccorded me at the front door the first look at him dispelled any sense\r\nof his inhospitality.\r\n\r\nHe was not the same.  Hardly past middle age, he had gone gray and had\r\nacquired a pronounced stoop.  His figure was thin and angular, his face\r\ndeeply lined, his complexion dead-white, without a touch of color.  His\r\neyes, unnaturally large, glowed with a fire that was almost uncanny.\r\n\r\nHe seated me, proffered a cigar, and with grave and obvious sincerity\r\nassured me of the pleasure that it gave him to meet me.  Some unimportant\r\nconversation followed, but all the while I was dominated by a melancholy\r\nsense of the great change in him.  This he must have perceived, for he\r\nsuddenly said with a bright enough smile, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are disappointed in\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94_non sum qualis eram_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hardly knew what to reply, but managed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, really, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow: your Latin is about the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe brightened again.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing a dead language, it grows in\r\nappropriateness.  But please have the patience to wait: where I am going\r\nthere is perhaps a better tongue.  Will you care to have a message in\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smile faded as he spoke, and as he concluded he was looking into my\r\neyes with a gravity that distressed me.  Yet I would not surrender myself\r\nto his mood, nor permit him to see how deeply his prescience of death\r\naffected me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy that it will be long,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore human speech will cease\r\nto serve our need; and then the need, with its possibilities of service,\r\nwill have passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, and I too was silent, for the talk had taken a\r\ndispiriting turn, yet I knew not how to give it a more agreeable\r\ncharacter.  Suddenly, in a pause of the storm, when the dead silence was\r\nalmost startling by contrast with the previous uproar, I heard a gentle\r\ntapping, which appeared to come from the wall behind my chair.  The sound\r\nwas such as might have been made by a human hand, not as upon a door by\r\none asking admittance, but rather, I thought, as an agreed signal, an\r\nassurance of someone\xe2\x80\x99s presence in an adjoining room; most of us, I\r\nfancy, have had more experience of such communications than we should\r\ncare to relate.  I glanced at Dampier.  If possibly there was something\r\nof amusement in the look he did not observe it.  He appeared to have\r\nforgotten my presence, and was staring at the wall behind me with an\r\nexpression in his eyes that I am unable to name, although my memory of it\r\nis as vivid to-day as was my sense of it then.  The situation was\r\nembarrassing; I rose to take my leave.  At this he seemed to recover\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease be seated,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit is nothing\xe2\x80\x94no one is there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the tapping was repeated, and with the same gentle, slow insistence\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is late.  May I call to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled\xe2\x80\x94a little mechanically, I thought.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very delicate of\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut quite needless.  Really, this is the only room in the\r\ntower, and no one is there.  At least\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He left the sentence incomplete,\r\nrose, and threw up a window, the only opening in the wall from which the\r\nsound seemed to come.  \xe2\x80\x9cSee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot clearly knowing what else to do I followed him to the window and\r\nlooked out.  A street-lamp some little distance away gave enough light\r\nthrough the murk of the rain that was again falling in torrents to make\r\nit entirely plain that \xe2\x80\x9cno one was there.\xe2\x80\x9d  In truth there was nothing\r\nbut the sheer blank wall of the tower.\r\n\r\nDampier closed the window and signing me to my seat resumed his own.\r\n\r\nThe incident was not in itself particularly mysterious; any one of a\r\ndozen explanations was possible (though none has occurred to me), yet it\r\nimpressed me strangely, the more, perhaps, from my friend\xe2\x80\x99s effort to\r\nreassure me, which seemed to dignify it with a certain significance and\r\nimportance.  He had proved that no one was there, but in that fact lay\r\nall the interest; and he proffered no explanation.  His silence was\r\nirritating and made me resentful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, somewhat ironically, I fear, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not disposed\r\nto question your right to harbor as many spooks as you find agreeable to\r\nyour taste and consistent with your notions of companionship; that is no\r\nbusiness of mine.  But being just a plain man of affairs, mostly of this\r\nworld, I find spooks needless to my peace and comfort.  I am going to my\r\nhotel, where my fellow-guests are still in the flesh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not a very civil speech, but he manifested no feeling about it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly remain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am grateful for your presence here.  What\r\nyou have heard to-night I believe myself to have heard twice before.  Now\r\nI _know_ it was no illusion.  That is much to me\xe2\x80\x94more than you know.\r\nHave a fresh cigar and a good stock of patience while I tell you the\r\nstory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rain was now falling more steadily, with a low, monotonous\r\nsusurration, interrupted at long intervals by the sudden slashing of the\r\nboughs of the trees as the wind rose and failed.  The night was well\r\nadvanced, but both sympathy and curiosity held me a willing listener to\r\nmy friend\xe2\x80\x99s monologue, which I did not interrupt by a single word from\r\nbeginning to end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI occupied a ground-floor apartment in one of\r\na row of houses, all alike, away at the other end of the town, on what we\r\ncall Rincon Hill.  This had been the best quarter of San Francisco, but\r\nhad fallen into neglect and decay, partly because the primitive character\r\nof its domestic architecture no longer suited the maturing tastes of our\r\nwealthy citizens, partly because certain public improvements had made a\r\nwreck of it.  The row of dwellings in one of which I lived stood a little\r\nway back from the street, each having a miniature garden, separated from\r\nits neighbors by low iron fences and bisected with mathematical precision\r\nby a box-bordered gravel walk from gate to door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne morning as I was leaving my lodging I observed a young girl entering\r\nthe adjoining garden on the left.  It was a warm day in June, and she was\r\nlightly gowned in white.  From her shoulders hung a broad straw hat\r\nprofusely decorated with flowers and wonderfully beribboned in the\r\nfashion of the time.  My attention was not long held by the exquisite\r\nsimplicity of her costume, for no one could look at her face and think of\r\nanything earthly.  Do not fear; I shall not profane it by description; it\r\nwas beautiful exceedingly.  All that I had ever seen or dreamed of\r\nloveliness was in that matchless living picture by the hand of the Divine\r\nArtist.  So deeply did it move me that, without a thought of the\r\nimpropriety of the act, I unconsciously bared my head, as a devout\r\nCatholic or well-bred Protestant uncovers before an image of the Blessed\r\nVirgin.  The maiden showed no displeasure; she merely turned her glorious\r\ndark eyes upon me with a look that made me catch my breath, and without\r\nother recognition of my act passed into the house.  For a moment I stood\r\nmotionless, hat in hand, painfully conscious of my rudeness, yet so\r\ndominated by the emotion inspired by that vision of incomparable beauty\r\nthat my penitence was less poignant than it should have been.  Then I\r\nwent my way, leaving my heart behind.  In the natural course of things I\r\nshould probably have remained away until nightfall, but by the middle of\r\nthe afternoon I was back in the little garden, affecting an interest in\r\nthe few foolish flowers that I had never before observed.  My hope was\r\nvain; she did not appear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a night of unrest succeeded a day of expectation and disappointment,\r\nbut on the day after, as I wandered aimlessly about the neighborhood, I\r\nmet her.  Of course I did not repeat my folly of uncovering, nor venture\r\nby even so much as too long a look to manifest an interest in her; yet my\r\nheart was beating audibly.  I trembled and consciously colored as she\r\nturned her big black eyes upon me with a look of obvious recognition\r\nentirely devoid of boldness or coquetry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not weary you with particulars; many times afterward I met the\r\nmaiden, yet never either addressed her or sought to fix her attention.\r\nNor did I take any action toward making her acquaintance.  Perhaps my\r\nforbearance, requiring so supreme an effort of self-denial, will not be\r\nentirely clear to you.  That I was heels over head in love is true, but\r\nwho can overcome his habit of thought, or reconstruct his character?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was what some foolish persons are pleased to call, and others, more\r\nfoolish, are pleased to be called\xe2\x80\x94an aristocrat; and despite her beauty,\r\nher charms and graces, the girl was not of my class.  I had learned her\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94which it is needless to speak\xe2\x80\x94and something of her family.  She was\r\nan orphan, a dependent niece of the impossible elderly fat woman in whose\r\nlodging-house she lived.  My income was small and I lacked the talent for\r\nmarrying; it is perhaps a gift.  An alliance with that family would\r\ncondemn me to its manner of life, part me from my books and studies, and\r\nin a social sense reduce me to the ranks.  It is easy to deprecate such\r\nconsiderations as these and I have not retained myself for the defense.\r\nLet judgment be entered against me, but in strict justice all my\r\nancestors for generations should be made co-defendants and I be permitted\r\nto plead in mitigation of punishment the imperious mandate of heredity.\r\nTo a m\xc3\xa9salliance of that kind every globule of my ancestral blood spoke\r\nin opposition.  In brief, my tastes, habits, instinct, with whatever of\r\nreason my love had left me\xe2\x80\x94all fought against it.  Moreover, I was an\r\nirreclaimable sentimentalist, and found a subtle charm in an impersonal\r\nand spiritual relation which acquaintance might vulgarize and marriage\r\nwould certainly dispel.  No woman, I argued, is what this lovely creature\r\nseems.  Love is a delicious dream; why should I bring about my own\r\nawakening?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe course dictated by all this sense and sentiment was obvious.  Honor,\r\npride, prudence, preservation of my ideals\xe2\x80\x94all commanded me to go away,\r\nbut for that I was too weak.  The utmost that I could do by a mighty\r\neffort of will was to cease meeting the girl, and that I did.  I even\r\navoided the chance encounters of the garden, leaving my lodging only when\r\nI knew that she had gone to her music lessons, and returning after\r\nnightfall.  Yet all the while I was as one in a trance, indulging the\r\nmost fascinating fancies and ordering my entire intellectual life in\r\naccordance with my dream.  Ah, my friend, as one whose actions have a\r\ntraceable relation to reason, you cannot know the fool\xe2\x80\x99s paradise in\r\nwhich I lived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening the devil put it into my head to be an unspeakable idiot.\r\nBy apparently careless and purposeless questioning I learned from my\r\ngossipy landlady that the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom adjoined my own, a\r\nparty-wall between.  Yielding to a sudden and coarse impulse I gently\r\nrapped on the wall.  There was no response, naturally, but I was in no\r\nmood to accept a rebuke.  A madness was upon me and I repeated the folly,\r\nthe offense, but again ineffectually, and I had the decency to desist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour later, while absorbed in some of my infernal studies, I heard,\r\nor thought I heard, my signal answered.  Flinging down my books I sprang\r\nto the wall and as steadily as my beating heart would permit gave three\r\nslow taps upon it.  This time the response was distinct, unmistakable:\r\none, two, three\xe2\x80\x94an exact repetition of my signal.  That was all I could\r\nelicit, but it was enough\xe2\x80\x94too much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next evening, and for many evenings afterward, that folly went on, I\r\nalways having \xe2\x80\x98the last word.\xe2\x80\x99  During the whole period I was deliriously\r\nhappy, but with the perversity of my nature I persevered in my resolution\r\nnot to see her.  Then, as I should have expected, I got no further\r\nanswers.  \xe2\x80\x98She is disgusted,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98with what she thinks my\r\ntimidity in making no more definite advances\xe2\x80\x99; and I resolved to seek her\r\nand make her acquaintance and\xe2\x80\x94what?  I did not know, nor do I now know,\r\nwhat might have come of it.  I know only that I passed days and days\r\ntrying to meet her, and all in vain; she was invisible as well as\r\ninaudible.  I haunted the streets where we had met, but she did not come.\r\nFrom my window I watched the garden in front of her house, but she passed\r\nneither in nor out.  I fell into the deepest dejection, believing that\r\nshe had gone away, yet took no steps to resolve my doubt by inquiry of my\r\nlandlady, to whom, indeed, I had taken an unconquerable aversion from her\r\nhaving once spoken of the girl with less of reverence than I thought\r\nbefitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere came a fateful night.  Worn out with emotion, irresolution and\r\ndespondency, I had retired early and fallen into such sleep as was still\r\npossible to me.  In the middle of the night something\xe2\x80\x94some malign power\r\nbent upon the wrecking of my peace forever\xe2\x80\x94caused me to open my eyes and\r\nsit up, wide awake and listening intently for I knew not what.  Then I\r\nthought I heard a faint tapping on the wall\xe2\x80\x94the mere ghost of the\r\nfamiliar signal.  In a few moments it was repeated: one, two, three\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nlouder than before, but addressing a sense alert and strained to receive\r\nit.  I was about to reply when the Adversary of Peace again intervened in\r\nmy affairs with a rascally suggestion of retaliation.  She had long and\r\ncruelly ignored me; now I would ignore her.  Incredible fatuity\xe2\x80\x94may God\r\nforgive it!  All the rest of the night I lay awake, fortifying my\r\nobstinacy with shameless justifications and\xe2\x80\x94listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLate the next morning, as I was leaving the house, I met my landlady,\r\nentering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good morning, Mr. Dampier,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98Have you heard the news?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI replied in words that I had heard no news; in manner, that I did not\r\ncare to hear any.  The manner escaped her observation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98About the sick young lady next door,\xe2\x80\x99 she babbled on.  \xe2\x80\x98What! you did\r\nnot know?  Why, she has been ill for weeks.  And now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost sprang upon her.  \xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 I cried, \xe2\x80\x98now what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She is dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the whole story.  In the middle of the night, as I learned\r\nlater, the patient, awakening from a long stupor after a week of\r\ndelirium, had asked\xe2\x80\x94it was her last utterance\xe2\x80\x94that her bed be moved to\r\nthe opposite side of the room.  Those in attendance had thought the\r\nrequest a vagary of her delirium, but had complied.  And there the poor\r\npassing soul had exerted its failing will to restore a broken\r\nconnection\xe2\x80\x94a golden thread of sentiment between its innocence and a\r\nmonstrous baseness owning a blind, brutal allegiance to the Law of Self.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat reparation could I make?  Are there masses that can be said for the\r\nrepose of souls that are abroad such nights as this\xe2\x80\x94spirits \xe2\x80\x98blown about\r\nby the viewless winds\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94coming in the storm and darkness with signs and\r\nportents, hints of memory and presages of doom?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the third visitation.  On the first occasion I was too skeptical\r\nto do more than verify by natural methods the character of the incident;\r\non the second, I responded to the signal after it had been several times\r\nrepeated, but without result.  To-night\xe2\x80\x99s recurrence completes the \xe2\x80\x98fatal\r\ntriad\xe2\x80\x99 expounded by Parapelius Necromantius.  There is no more to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Dampier had finished his story I could think of nothing relevant\r\nthat I cared to say, and to question him would have been a hideous\r\nimpertinence.  I rose and bade him good night in a way to convey to him a\r\nsense of my sympathy, which he silently acknowledged by a pressure of the\r\nhand.  That night, alone with his sorrow and remorse, he passed into the\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PSYCHOLOGICAL SHIPWRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the summer of 1874 I was in Liverpool, whither I had gone on business\r\nfor the mercantile house of Bronson & Jarrett, New York.  I am William\r\nJarrett; my partner was Zenas Bronson.  The firm failed last year, and\r\nunable to endure the fall from affluence to poverty he died.\r\n\r\nHaving finished my business, and feeling the lassitude and exhaustion\r\nincident to its dispatch, I felt that a protracted sea voyage would be\r\nboth agreeable and beneficial, so instead of embarking for my return on\r\none of the many fine passenger steamers I booked for New York on the\r\nsailing vessel _Morrow_, upon which I had shipped a large and valuable\r\ninvoice of the goods I had bought.  The _Morrow_ was an English ship\r\nwith, of course, but little accommodation for passengers, of whom there\r\nwere only myself, a young woman and her servant, who was a middle-aged\r\nnegress.  I thought it singular that a traveling English girl should be\r\nso attended, but she afterward explained to me that the woman had been\r\nleft with her family by a man and his wife from South Carolina, both of\r\nwhom had died on the same day at the house of the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s father in\r\nDevonshire\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance in itself sufficiently uncommon to remain\r\nrather distinctly in my memory, even had it not afterward transpired in\r\nconversation with the young lady that the name of the man was William\r\nJarrett, the same as my own.  I knew that a branch of my family had\r\nsettled in South Carolina, but of them and their history I was ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe _Morrow_ sailed from the mouth of the Mersey on the 15th of June and\r\nfor several weeks we had fair breezes and unclouded skies.  The skipper,\r\nan admirable seaman but nothing more, favored us with very little of his\r\nsociety, except at his table; and the young woman, Miss Janette Harford,\r\nand I became very well acquainted.  We were, in truth, nearly always\r\ntogether, and being of an introspective turn of mind I often endeavored\r\nto analyze and define the novel feeling with which she inspired me\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsecret, subtle, but powerful attraction which constantly impelled me to\r\nseek her; but the attempt was hopeless.  I could only be sure that at\r\nleast it was not love.  Having assured myself of this and being certain\r\nthat she was quite as whole-hearted, I ventured one evening (I remember\r\nit was on the 3d of July) as we sat on deck to ask her, laughingly, if\r\nshe could assist me to resolve my psychological doubt.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she was silent, with averted face, and I began to fear I had\r\nbeen extremely rude and indelicate; then she fixed her eyes gravely on my\r\nown.  In an instant my mind was dominated by as strange a fancy as ever\r\nentered human consciousness.  It seemed as if she were looking at me, not\r\n_with_, but _through_, those eyes\xe2\x80\x94from an immeasurable distance behind\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94and that a number of other persons, men, women and children, upon\r\nwhose faces I caught strangely familiar evanescent expressions, clustered\r\nabout her, struggling with gentle eagerness to look at me through the\r\nsame orbs.  Ship, ocean, sky\xe2\x80\x94all had vanished.  I was conscious of\r\nnothing but the figures in this extraordinary and fantastic scene.  Then\r\nall at once darkness fell upon me, and anon from out of it, as to one who\r\ngrows accustomed by degrees to a dimmer light, my former surroundings of\r\ndeck and mast and cordage slowly resolved themselves.  Miss Harford had\r\nclosed her eyes and was leaning back in her chair, apparently asleep, the\r\nbook she had been reading open in her lap.  Impelled by surely I cannot\r\nsay what motive, I glanced at the top of the page; it was a copy of that\r\nrare and curious work, \xe2\x80\x9cDenneker\xe2\x80\x99s Meditations,\xe2\x80\x9d and the lady\xe2\x80\x99s index\r\nfinger rested on this passage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sundry it is given to be drawn away, and to be apart from the body\r\nfor a season; for, as concerning rills which would flow across each other\r\nthe weaker is borne along by the stronger, so there be certain of kin\r\nwhose paths intersecting, their souls do bear company, the while their\r\nbodies go fore-appointed ways, unknowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nMiss Harford arose, shuddering; the sun had sunk below the horizon, but\r\nit was not cold.  There was not a breath of wind; there were no clouds in\r\nthe sky, yet not a star was visible.  A hurried tramping sounded on the\r\ndeck; the captain, summoned from below, joined the first officer, who\r\nstood looking at the barometer.  \xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d I heard him exclaim.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the form of Janette Harford, invisible in the darkness and\r\nspray, was torn from my grasp by the cruel vortex of the sinking ship,\r\nand I fainted in the cordage of the floating mast to which I had lashed\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nIt was by lamplight that I awoke.  I lay in a berth amid the familiar\r\nsurroundings of the stateroom of a steamer.  On a couch opposite sat a\r\nman, half undressed for bed, reading a book.  I recognized the face of my\r\nfriend Gordon Doyle, whom I had met in Liverpool on the day of my\r\nembarkation, when he was himself about to sail on the steamer _City of\r\nPrague_, on which he had urged me to accompany him.\r\n\r\nAfter some moments I now spoke his name.  He simply said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nturned a leaf in his book without removing his eyes from the page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoyle,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cdid they save _her_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe now deigned to look at me and smiled as if amused.  He evidently\r\nthought me but half awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer?  Whom do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJanette Harford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis amusement turned to amazement; he stared at me fixedly, saying\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will tell me after a while,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you will tell\r\nme after a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment later I asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat ship is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoyle stared again.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe steamer _City of Prague_, bound from Liverpool\r\nto New York, three weeks out with a broken shaft.  Principal passenger,\r\nMr. Gordon Doyle; ditto lunatic, Mr. William Jarrett.  These two\r\ndistinguished travelers embarked together, but they are about to part, it\r\nbeing the resolute intention of the former to pitch the latter\r\noverboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sat bolt upright.  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that I have been for three weeks\r\na passenger on this steamer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, pretty nearly; this is the 3d of July.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I been ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight as a trivet all the time, and punctual at your meals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God!  Doyle, there is some mystery here; do have the goodness to be\r\nserious.  Was I not rescued from the wreck of the ship _Morrow_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoyle changed color, and approaching me, laid his fingers on my wrist.  A\r\nmoment later, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know of Janette Harford?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked very\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst tell me what _you_ know of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Doyle gazed at me for some moments as if thinking what to do, then\r\nseating himself again on the couch, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I not?  I am engaged to marry Janette Harford, whom I met a\r\nyear ago in London.  Her family, one of the wealthiest in Devonshire, cut\r\nup rough about it, and we eloped\xe2\x80\x94are eloping rather, for on the day that\r\nyou and I walked to the landing stage to go aboard this steamer she and\r\nher faithful servant, a negress, passed us, driving to the ship _Morrow_.\r\nShe would not consent to go in the same vessel with me, and it had been\r\ndeemed best that she take a sailing vessel in order to avoid observation\r\nand lessen the risk of detection.  I am now alarmed lest this cursed\r\nbreaking of our machinery may detain us so long that the _Morrow_ will\r\nget to New York before us, and the poor girl will not know where to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI lay still in my berth\xe2\x80\x94so still I hardly breathed.  But the subject was\r\nevidently not displeasing to Doyle, and after a short pause he resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, she is only an adopted daughter of the Harfords.  Her mother\r\nwas killed at their place by being thrown from a horse while hunting, and\r\nher father, mad with grief, made away with himself the same day.  No one\r\never claimed the child, and after a reasonable time they adopted her.\r\nShe has grown up in the belief that she is their daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoyle, what book are you reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x98Denneker\xe2\x80\x99s Meditations.\xe2\x80\x99  It\xe2\x80\x99s a rum lot, Janette gave\r\nit to me; she happened to have two copies.  Want to see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tossed me the volume, which opened as it fell.  On one of the exposed\r\npages was a marked passage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sundry it is given to be drawn away, and to be apart from the body\r\nfor a season; for, as concerning rills which would flow across each other\r\nthe weaker is borne along by the stronger, so there be certain of kin\r\nwhose paths intersecting, their souls do bear company, the while their\r\nbodies go fore-appointed ways, unknowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had\xe2\x80\x94she has\xe2\x80\x94a singular taste in reading,\xe2\x80\x9d I managed to say,\r\nmastering my agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  And now perhaps you will have the kindness to explain how you knew\r\nher name and that of the ship she sailed in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talked of her in your sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nA week later we were towed into the port of New York.  But the _Morrow_\r\nwas never heard from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE TOE OF THE RIGHT FOOT\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is well known that the old Manton house is haunted.  In all the rural\r\ndistrict near about, and even in the town of Marshall, a mile away, not\r\none person of unbiased mind entertains a doubt of it; incredulity is\r\nconfined to those opinionated persons who will be called \xe2\x80\x9ccranks\xe2\x80\x9d as soon\r\nas the useful word shall have penetrated the intellectual demesne of the\r\nMarshall _Advance_.  The evidence that the house is haunted is of two\r\nkinds: the testimony of disinterested witnesses who have had ocular\r\nproof, and that of the house itself.  The former may be disregarded and\r\nruled out on any of the various grounds of objection which may be urged\r\nagainst it by the ingenious; but facts within the observation of all are\r\nmaterial and controlling.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Manton house has been unoccupied by mortals for\r\nmore than ten years, and with its outbuildings is slowly falling into\r\ndecay\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance which in itself the judicious will hardly venture to\r\nignore.  It stands a little way off the loneliest reach of the Marshall\r\nand Harriston road, in an opening which was once a farm and is still\r\ndisfigured with strips of rotting fence and half covered with brambles\r\noverrunning a stony and sterile soil long unacquainted with the plow.\r\nThe house itself is in tolerably good condition, though badly\r\nweather-stained and in dire need of attention from the glazier, the\r\nsmaller male population of the region having attested in the manner of\r\nits kind its disapproval of dwelling without dwellers.  It is two stories\r\nin height, nearly square, its front pierced by a single doorway flanked\r\non each side by a window boarded up to the very top.  Corresponding\r\nwindows above, not protected, serve to admit light and rain to the rooms\r\nof the upper floor.  Grass and weeds grow pretty rankly all about, and a\r\nfew shade trees, somewhat the worse for wind, and leaning all in one\r\ndirection, seem to be making a concerted effort to run away.  In short,\r\nas the Marshall town humorist explained in the columns of the _Advance_,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe proposition that the Manton house is badly haunted is the only\r\nlogical conclusion from the premises.\xe2\x80\x9d  The fact that in this dwelling\r\nMr. Manton thought it expedient one night some ten years ago to rise and\r\ncut the throats of his wife and two small children, removing at once to\r\nanother part of the country, has no doubt done its share in directing\r\npublic attention to the fitness of the place for supernatural phenomena.\r\n\r\nTo this house, one summer evening, came four men in a wagon.  Three of\r\nthem promptly alighted, and the one who had been driving hitched the team\r\nto the only remaining post of what had been a fence.  The fourth remained\r\nseated in the wagon.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of his companions, approaching\r\nhim, while the others moved away in the direction of the dwelling\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\nis the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man addressed did not move.  \xe2\x80\x9cBy God!\xe2\x80\x9d he said harshly, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a\r\ntrick, and it looks to me as if you were in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am,\xe2\x80\x9d the other said, looking him straight in the face and\r\nspeaking in a tone which had something of contempt in it.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou will\r\nremember, however, that the choice of place was with your own assent left\r\nto the other side.  Of course if you are afraid of spooks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid of nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d the man interrupted with another oath, and\r\nsprang to the ground.  The two then joined the others at the door, which\r\none of them had already opened with some difficulty, caused by rust of\r\nlock and hinge.  All entered.  Inside it was dark, but the man who had\r\nunlocked the door produced a candle and matches and made a light.  He\r\nthen unlocked a door on their right as they stood in the passage.  This\r\ngave them entrance to a large, square room that the candle but dimly\r\nlighted.  The floor had a thick carpeting of dust, which partly muffled\r\ntheir footfalls.  Cobwebs were in the angles of the walls and depended\r\nfrom the ceiling like strips of rotting lace, making undulatory movements\r\nin the disturbed air.  The room had two windows in adjoining sides, but\r\nfrom neither could anything be seen except the rough inner surfaces of\r\nboards a few inches from the glass.  There was no fireplace, no\r\nfurniture; there was nothing: besides the cobwebs and the dust, the four\r\nmen were the only objects there which were not a part of the structure.\r\n\r\nStrange enough they looked in the yellow light of the candle.  The one\r\nwho had so reluctantly alighted was especially spectacular\xe2\x80\x94he might have\r\nbeen called sensational.  He was of middle age, heavily built, deep\r\nchested and broad shouldered.  Looking at his figure, one would have said\r\nthat he had a giant\xe2\x80\x99s strength; at his features, that he would use it\r\nlike a giant.  He was clean shaven, his hair rather closely cropped and\r\ngray.  His low forehead was seamed with wrinkles above the eyes, and over\r\nthe nose these became vertical.  The heavy black brows followed the same\r\nlaw, saved from meeting only by an upward turn at what would otherwise\r\nhave been the point of contact.  Deeply sunken beneath these, glowed in\r\nthe obscure light a pair of eyes of uncertain color, but obviously enough\r\ntoo small.  There was something forbidding in their expression, which was\r\nnot bettered by the cruel mouth and wide jaw.  The nose was well enough,\r\nas noses go; one does not expect much of noses.  All that was sinister in\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s face seemed accentuated by an unnatural pallor\xe2\x80\x94he appeared\r\naltogether bloodless.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the other men was sufficiently commonplace: they were\r\nsuch persons as one meets and forgets that he met.  All were younger than\r\nthe man described, between whom and the eldest of the others, who stood\r\napart, there was apparently no kindly feeling.  They avoided looking at\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man holding the candle and keys, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe\r\neverything is right.  Are you ready, Mr. Rosser?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man standing apart from the group bowed and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Mr. Grossmith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe heavy man bowed and scowled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be pleased to remove your outer clothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir hats, coats, waistcoats and neckwear were soon removed and thrown\r\noutside the door, in the passage.  The man with the candle now nodded,\r\nand the fourth man\xe2\x80\x94he who had urged Grossmith to leave the wagon\xe2\x80\x94produced\r\nfrom the pocket of his overcoat two long, murderous-looking bowie-knives,\r\nwhich he drew now from their leather scabbards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are exactly alike,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, presenting one to each of the two\r\nprincipals\xe2\x80\x94for by this time the dullest observer would have understood\r\nthe nature of this meeting.  It was to be a duel to the death.\r\n\r\nEach combatant took a knife, examined it critically near the candle and\r\ntested the strength of blade and handle across his lifted knee.  Their\r\npersons were then searched in turn, each by the second of the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is agreeable to you, Mr. Grossmith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man holding the\r\nlight, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will place yourself in that corner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe indicated the angle of the room farthest from the door, whither\r\nGrossmith retired, his second parting from him with a grasp of the hand\r\nwhich had nothing of cordiality in it.  In the angle nearest the door Mr.\r\nRosser stationed himself, and after a whispered consultation his second\r\nleft him, joining the other near the door.  At that moment the candle was\r\nsuddenly extinguished, leaving all in profound darkness.  This may have\r\nbeen done by a draught from the opened door; whatever the cause, the\r\neffect was startling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice which sounded strangely unfamiliar in the\r\naltered condition affecting the relations of the senses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen, you\r\nwill not move until you hear the closing of the outer door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sound of trampling ensued, then the closing of the inner door; and\r\nfinally the outer one closed with a concussion which shook the entire\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterward a belated farmer\xe2\x80\x99s boy met a light wagon which\r\nwas being driven furiously toward the town of Marshall.  He declared that\r\nbehind the two figures on the front seat stood a third, with its hands\r\nupon the bowed shoulders of the others, who appeared to struggle vainly\r\nto free themselves from its grasp.  This figure, unlike the others, was\r\nclad in white, and had undoubtedly boarded the wagon as it passed the\r\nhaunted house.  As the lad could boast a considerable former experience\r\nwith the supernatural thereabouts his word had the weight justly due to\r\nthe testimony of an expert.  The story (in connection with the next day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevents) eventually appeared in the _Advance_, with some slight literary\r\nembellishments and a concluding intimation that the gentlemen referred to\r\nwould be allowed the use of the paper\xe2\x80\x99s columns for their version of the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s adventure.  But the privilege remained without a claimant.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events that led up to this \xe2\x80\x9cduel in the dark\xe2\x80\x9d were simple enough.\r\nOne evening three young men of the town of Marshall were sitting in a\r\nquiet corner of the porch of the village hotel, smoking and discussing\r\nsuch matters as three educated young men of a Southern village would\r\nnaturally find interesting.  Their names were King, Sancher and Rosser.\r\nAt a little distance, within easy hearing, but taking no part in the\r\nconversation, sat a fourth.  He was a stranger to the others.  They\r\nmerely knew that on his arrival by the stage-coach that afternoon he had\r\nwritten in the hotel register the name Robert Grossmith.  He had not been\r\nobserved to speak to anyone except the hotel clerk.  He seemed, indeed,\r\nsingularly fond of his own company\xe2\x80\x94or, as the _personnel_ of the\r\n_Advance_ expressed it, \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly addicted to evil associations.\xe2\x80\x9d  But\r\nthen it should be said in justice to the stranger that the _personnel_\r\nwas himself of a too convivial disposition fairly to judge one\r\ndifferently gifted, and had, moreover, experienced a slight rebuff in an\r\neffort at an \xe2\x80\x9cinterview.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate any kind of deformity in a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said King, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether natural\r\nor\xe2\x80\x94acquired.  I have a theory that any physical defect has its\r\ncorrelative mental and moral defect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI infer, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosser, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a lady lacking the moral\r\nadvantage of a nose would find the struggle to become Mrs. King an\r\narduous enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you may put it that way,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, seriously, I\r\nonce threw over a most charming girl on learning quite accidentally that\r\nshe had suffered amputation of a toe.  My conduct was brutal if you like,\r\nbut if I had married that girl I should have been miserable for life and\r\nshould have made her so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sancher, with a light laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cby marrying a gentleman of\r\nmore liberal views she escaped with a parted throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you know to whom I refer.  Yes, she married Manton, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nabout his liberality; I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure but he cut her throat because he\r\ndiscovered that she lacked that excellent thing in woman, the middle toe\r\nof the right foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that chap!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosser in a low voice, his eyes fixed upon the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nThat chap was obviously listening intently to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn his impudence!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered King\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat ought we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an easy one,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosser replied, rising.  \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\naddressing the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be better if you would remove\r\nyour chair to the other end of the veranda.  The presence of gentlemen is\r\nevidently an unfamiliar situation to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man sprang to his feet and strode forward with clenched hands, his\r\nface white with rage.  All were now standing.  Sancher stepped between\r\nthe belligerents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are hasty and unjust,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Rosser; \xe2\x80\x9cthis gentleman has done\r\nnothing to deserve such language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Rosser would not withdraw a word.  By the custom of the country and\r\nthe time there could be but one outcome to the quarrel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI demand the satisfaction due to a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, who\r\nhad become more calm.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have not an acquaintance in this region.\r\nPerhaps you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d bowing to Sancher, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be kind enough to represent\r\nme in this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSancher accepted the trust\xe2\x80\x94somewhat reluctantly it must be confessed, for\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s appearance and manner were not at all to his liking.  King, who\r\nduring the colloquy had hardly removed his eyes from the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nand had not spoken a word, consented with a nod to act for Rosser, and\r\nthe upshot of it was that, the principals having retired, a meeting was\r\narranged for the next evening.  The nature of the arrangements has been\r\nalready disclosed.  The duel with knives in a dark room was once a\r\ncommoner feature of Southwestern life than it is likely to be again.  How\r\nthin a veneering of \xe2\x80\x9cchivalry\xe2\x80\x9d covered the essential brutality of the\r\ncode under which such encounters were possible we shall see.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the blaze of a midsummer noonday the old Manton house was hardly true\r\nto its traditions.  It was of the earth, earthy.  The sunshine caressed\r\nit warmly and affectionately, with evident disregard of its bad\r\nreputation.  The grass greening all the expanse in its front seemed to\r\ngrow, not rankly, but with a natural and joyous exuberance, and the weeds\r\nblossomed quite like plants.  Full of charming lights and shadows and\r\npopulous with pleasant-voiced birds, the neglected shade trees no longer\r\nstruggled to run away, but bent reverently beneath their burdens of sun\r\nand song.  Even in the glassless upper windows was an expression of peace\r\nand contentment, due to the light within.  Over the stony fields the\r\nvisible heat danced with a lively tremor incompatible with the gravity\r\nwhich is an attribute of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nSuch was the aspect under which the place presented itself to Sheriff\r\nAdams and two other men who had come out from Marshall to look at it.\r\nOne of these men was Mr. King, the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s deputy; the other, whose\r\nname was Brewer, was a brother of the late Mrs. Manton.  Under a\r\nbeneficent law of the State relating to property which has been for a\r\ncertain period abandoned by an owner whose residence cannot be\r\nascertained, the sheriff was legal custodian of the Manton farm and\r\nappurtenances thereunto belonging.  His present visit was in mere\r\nperfunctory compliance with some order of a court in which Mr. Brewer had\r\nan action to get possession of the property as heir to his deceased\r\nsister.  By a mere coincidence, the visit was made on the day after the\r\nnight that Deputy King had unlocked the house for another and very\r\ndifferent purpose.  His presence now was not of his own choosing: he had\r\nbeen ordered to accompany his superior and at the moment could think of\r\nnothing more prudent than simulated alacrity in obedience to the command.\r\n\r\nCarelessly opening the front door, which to his surprise was not locked,\r\nthe sheriff was amazed to see, lying on the floor of the passage into\r\nwhich it opened, a confused heap of men\xe2\x80\x99s apparel.  Examination showed it\r\nto consist of two hats, and the same number of coats, waistcoats and\r\nscarves, all in a remarkably good state of preservation, albeit somewhat\r\ndefiled by the dust in which they lay.  Mr. Brewer was equally\r\nastonished, but Mr. King\xe2\x80\x99s emotion is not of record.  With a new and\r\nlively interest in his own actions the sheriff now unlatched and pushed\r\nopen a door on the right, and the three entered.  The room was apparently\r\nvacant\xe2\x80\x94no; as their eyes became accustomed to the dimmer light something\r\nwas visible in the farthest angle of the wall.  It was a human\r\nfigure\xe2\x80\x94that of a man crouching close in the corner.  Something in the\r\nattitude made the intruders halt when they had barely passed the\r\nthreshold.  The figure more and more clearly defined itself.  The man was\r\nupon one knee, his back in the angle of the wall, his shoulders elevated\r\nto the level of his ears, his hands before his face, palms outward, the\r\nfingers spread and crooked like claws; the white face turned upward on\r\nthe retracted neck had an expression of unutterable fright, the mouth\r\nhalf open, the eyes incredibly expanded.  He was stone dead.  Yet, with\r\nthe exception of a bowie-knife, which had evidently fallen from his own\r\nhand, not another object was in the room.\r\n\r\nIn thick dust that covered the floor were some confused footprints near\r\nthe door and along the wall through which it opened.  Along one of the\r\nadjoining walls, too, past the boarded-up windows, was the trail made by\r\nthe man himself in reaching his corner.  Instinctively in approaching the\r\nbody the three men followed that trail.  The sheriff grasped one of the\r\noutthrown arms; it was as rigid as iron, and the application of a gentle\r\nforce rocked the entire body without altering the relation of its parts.\r\nBrewer, pale with excitement, gazed intently into the distorted face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod of mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly cried, \xe2\x80\x9cit is Manton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said King, with an evident attempt at calmness: \xe2\x80\x9cI knew\r\nManton.  He then wore a full beard and his hair long, but this is he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe might have added: \xe2\x80\x9cI recognized him when he challenged Rosser.  I told\r\nRosser and Sancher who he was before we played him this horrible trick.\r\nWhen Rosser left this dark room at our heels, forgetting his outer\r\nclothing in the excitement, and driving away with us in his shirt\r\nsleeves\xe2\x80\x94all through the discreditable proceedings we knew whom we were\r\ndealing with, murderer and coward that he was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut nothing of this did Mr. King say.  With his better light he was\r\ntrying to penetrate the mystery of the man\xe2\x80\x99s death.  That he had not once\r\nmoved from the corner where he had been stationed; that his posture was\r\nthat of neither attack nor defense; that he had dropped his weapon; that\r\nhe had obviously perished of sheer horror of something that he saw\xe2\x80\x94these\r\nwere circumstances which Mr. King\xe2\x80\x99s disturbed intelligence could not\r\nrightly comprehend.\r\n\r\nGroping in intellectual darkness for a clew to his maze of doubt, his\r\ngaze, directed mechanically downward in the way of one who ponders\r\nmomentous matters, fell upon something which, there, in the light of day\r\nand in the presence of living companions, affected him with terror.  In\r\nthe dust of years that lay thick upon the floor\xe2\x80\x94leading from the door by\r\nwhich they had entered, straight across the room to within a yard of\r\nManton\xe2\x80\x99s crouching corpse\xe2\x80\x94were three parallel lines of footprints\xe2\x80\x94light\r\nbut definite impressions of bare feet, the outer ones those of small\r\nchildren, the inner a woman\xe2\x80\x99s.  From the point at which they ended they\r\ndid not return; they pointed all one way.  Brewer, who had observed them\r\nat the same moment, was leaning forward in an attitude of rapt attention,\r\nhorribly pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, pointing with both hands at the nearest print\r\nof the woman\xe2\x80\x99s right foot, where she had apparently stopped and stood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe middle toe is missing\xe2\x80\x94it was Gertrude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude was the late Mrs. Manton, sister to Mr. Brewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MORTONSON\xe2\x80\x99S FUNERAL {252}\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MORTONSON was dead: his lines in \xe2\x80\x9cthe tragedy \xe2\x80\x98Man\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d had all been\r\nspoken and he had left the stage.\r\n\r\nThe body rested in a fine mahogany coffin fitted with a plate of glass.\r\nAll arrangements for the funeral had been so well attended to that had\r\nthe deceased known he would doubtless have approved.  The face, as it\r\nshowed under the glass, was not disagreeable to look upon: it bore a\r\nfaint smile, and as the death had been painless, had not been distorted\r\nbeyond the repairing power of the undertaker.  At two o\xe2\x80\x99clock of the\r\nafternoon the friends were to assemble to pay their last tribute of\r\nrespect to one who had no further need of friends and respect.  The\r\nsurviving members of the family came severally every few minutes to the\r\ncasket and wept above the placid features beneath the glass.  This did\r\nthem no good; it did no good to John Mortonson; but in the presence of\r\ndeath reason and philosophy are silent.\r\n\r\nAs the hour of two approached the friends began to arrive and after\r\noffering such consolation to the stricken relatives as the proprieties of\r\nthe occasion required, solemnly seated themselves about the room with an\r\naugmented consciousness of their importance in the scheme funereal.  Then\r\nthe minister came, and in that overshadowing presence the lesser lights\r\nwent into eclipse.  His entrance was followed by that of the widow, whose\r\nlamentations filled the room.  She approached the casket and after\r\nleaning her face against the cold glass for a moment was gently led to a\r\nseat near her daughter.  Mournfully and low the man of God began his\r\neulogy of the dead, and his doleful voice, mingled with the sobbing which\r\nit was its purpose to stimulate and sustain, rose and fell, seemed to\r\ncome and go, like the sound of a sullen sea.  The gloomy day grew darker\r\nas he spoke; a curtain of cloud underspread the sky and a few drops of\r\nrain fell audibly.  It seemed as if all nature were weeping for John\r\nMortonson.\r\n\r\nWhen the minister had finished his eulogy with prayer a hymn was sung and\r\nthe pall-bearers took their places beside the bier.  As the last notes of\r\nthe hymn died away the widow ran to the coffin, cast herself upon it and\r\nsobbed hysterically.  Gradually, however, she yielded to dissuasion,\r\nbecoming more composed; and as the minister was in the act of leading her\r\naway her eyes sought the face of the dead beneath the glass.  She threw\r\nup her arms and with a shriek fell backward insensible.\r\n\r\nThe mourners sprang forward to the coffin, the friends followed, and as\r\nthe clock on the mantel solemnly struck three all were staring down upon\r\nthe face of John Mortonson, deceased.\r\n\r\nThey turned away, sick and faint.  One man, trying in his terror to\r\nescape the awful sight, stumbled against the coffin so heavily as to\r\nknock away one of its frail supports.  The coffin fell to the floor, the\r\nglass was shattered to bits by the concussion.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening crawled John Mortonson\xe2\x80\x99s cat, which lazily leapt to the\r\nfloor, sat up, tranquilly wiped its crimson muzzle with a forepaw, then\r\nwalked with dignity from the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REALM OF THE UNREAL\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR a part of the distance between Auburn and Newcastle the road\xe2\x80\x94first on\r\none side of a creek and then on the other\xe2\x80\x94occupies the whole bottom of\r\nthe ravine, being partly cut out of the steep hillside, and partly built\r\nup with bowlders removed from the creek-bed by the miners.  The hills are\r\nwooded, the course of the ravine is sinuous.  In a dark night careful\r\ndriving is required in order not to go off into the water.  The night\r\nthat I have in memory was dark, the creek a torrent, swollen by a recent\r\nstorm.  I had driven up from Newcastle and was within about a mile of\r\nAuburn in the darkest and narrowest part of the ravine, looking intently\r\nahead of my horse for the roadway.  Suddenly I saw a man almost under the\r\nanimal\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and reined in with a jerk that came near setting the\r\ncreature upon its haunches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cI did not see you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could hardly be expected to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d the man replied, civilly,\r\napproaching the side of the vehicle; \xe2\x80\x9cand the noise of the creek\r\nprevented my hearing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI at once recognized the voice, although five years had passed since I\r\nhad heard it.  I was not particularly well pleased to hear it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Dr. Dorrimore, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and you are my good friend Mr. Manrich.  I am more than glad to see\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94the excess,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a light laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing due to the fact\r\nthat I am going your way, and naturally expect an invitation to ride with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I extend with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was not altogether true.\r\n\r\nDr. Dorrimore thanked me as he seated himself beside me, and I drove\r\ncautiously forward, as before.  Doubtless it is fancy, but it seems to me\r\nnow that the remaining distance was made in a chill fog; that I was\r\nuncomfortably cold; that the way was longer than ever before, and the\r\ntown, when we reached it, cheerless, forbidding, and desolate.  It must\r\nhave been early in the evening, yet I do not recollect a light in any of\r\nthe houses nor a living thing in the streets.  Dorrimore explained at\r\nsome length how he happened to be there, and where he had been during the\r\nyears that had elapsed since I had seen him.  I recall the fact of the\r\nnarrative, but none of the facts narrated.  He had been in foreign\r\ncountries and had returned\xe2\x80\x94this is all that my memory retains, and this I\r\nalready knew.  As to myself I cannot remember that I spoke a word, though\r\ndoubtless I did.  Of one thing I am distinctly conscious: the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence at my side was strangely distasteful and disquieting\xe2\x80\x94so much so\r\nthat when I at last pulled up under the lights of the Putnam House I\r\nexperienced a sense of having escaped some spiritual peril of a nature\r\npeculiarly forbidding.  This sense of relief was somewhat modified by the\r\ndiscovery that Dr. Dorrimore was living at the same hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn partial explanation of my feelings regarding Dr. Dorrimore I will\r\nrelate briefly the circumstances under which I had met him some years\r\nbefore.  One evening a half-dozen men of whom I was one were sitting in\r\nthe library of the Bohemian Club in San Francisco.  The conversation had\r\nturned to the subject of sleight-of-hand and the feats of the\r\n_prestidigitateurs_, one of whom was then exhibiting at a local theatre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese fellows are pretenders in a double sense,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the party;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey can do nothing which it is worth one\xe2\x80\x99s while to be made a dupe by.\r\nThe humblest wayside juggler in India could mystify them to the verge of\r\nlunacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor example, how?\xe2\x80\x9d asked another, lighting a cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor example, by all their common and familiar performances\xe2\x80\x94throwing\r\nlarge objects into the air which never come down; causing plants to\r\nsprout, grow visibly and blossom, in bare ground chosen by spectators;\r\nputting a man into a wicker basket, piercing him through and through with\r\na sword while he shrieks and bleeds, and then\xe2\x80\x94the basket being opened\r\nnothing is there; tossing the free end of a silken ladder into the air,\r\nmounting it and disappearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, rather uncivilly, I fear.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou surely do not believe\r\nsuch things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not: I have seen them too often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said a journalist of considerable local fame as a picturesque\r\nreporter.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have so frequently related them that nothing but\r\nobservation could shake my conviction.  Why, gentlemen, I have my own\r\nword for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody laughed\xe2\x80\x94all were looking at something behind me.  Turning in my\r\nseat I saw a man in evening dress who had just entered the room.  He was\r\nexceedingly dark, almost swarthy, with a thin face, black-bearded to the\r\nlips, an abundance of coarse black hair in some disorder, a high nose and\r\neyes that glittered with as soulless an expression as those of a cobra.\r\nOne of the group rose and introduced him as Dr. Dorrimore, of Calcutta.\r\nAs each of us was presented in turn he acknowledged the fact with a\r\nprofound bow in the Oriental manner, but with nothing of Oriental\r\ngravity.  His smile impressed me as cynical and a trifle contemptuous.\r\nHis whole demeanor I can describe only as disagreeably engaging.\r\n\r\nHis presence led the conversation into other channels.  He said little\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndo not recall anything of what he did say.  I thought his voice\r\nsingularly rich and melodious, but it affected me in the same way as his\r\neyes and smile.  In a few minutes I rose to go.  He also rose and put on\r\nhis overcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Manrich,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil you are!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know which way I am going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be pleased to have your company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe left the building together.  No cabs were in sight, the street cars\r\nhad gone to bed, there was a full moon and the cool night air was\r\ndelightful; we walked up the California street hill.  I took that\r\ndirection thinking he would naturally wish to take another, toward one of\r\nthe hotels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not believe what is told of the Hindu jugglers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nWithout replying he laid his hand lightly upon my arm and with the other\r\npointed to the stone sidewalk directly in front.  There, almost at our\r\nfeet, lay the dead body of a man, the face upturned and white in the\r\nmoonlight!  A sword whose hilt sparkled with gems stood fixed and upright\r\nin the breast; a pool of blood had collected on the stones of the\r\nsidewalk.\r\n\r\nI was startled and terrified\xe2\x80\x94not only by what I saw, but by the\r\ncircumstances under which I saw it.  Repeatedly during our ascent of the\r\nhill my eyes, I thought, had traversed the whole reach of that sidewalk,\r\nfrom street to street.  How could they have been insensible to this\r\ndreadful object now so conspicuous in the white moonlight?\r\n\r\nAs my dazed faculties cleared I observed that the body was in evening\r\ndress; the overcoat thrown wide open revealed the dress-coat, the white\r\ntie, the broad expanse of shirt front pierced by the sword.  And\xe2\x80\x94horrible\r\nrevelation!\xe2\x80\x94the face, except for its pallor, was that of my companion!\r\nIt was to the minutest detail of dress and feature Dr. Dorrimore himself.\r\nBewildered and horrified, I turned to look for the living man.  He was\r\nnowhere visible, and with an added terror I retired from the place, down\r\nthe hill in the direction whence I had come.  I had taken but a few\r\nstrides when a strong grasp upon my shoulder arrested me.  I came near\r\ncrying out with terror: the dead man, the sword still fixed in his\r\nbreast, stood beside me!  Pulling out the sword with his disengaged hand,\r\nhe flung it from him, the moonlight glinting upon the jewels of its hilt\r\nand the unsullied steel of its blade.  It fell with a clang upon the\r\nsidewalk ahead and\xe2\x80\x94vanished!  The man, swarthy as before, relaxed his\r\ngrasp upon my shoulder and looked at me with the same cynical regard that\r\nI had observed on first meeting him.  The dead have not that look\xe2\x80\x94it\r\npartly restored me, and turning my head backward, I saw the smooth white\r\nexpanse of sidewalk, unbroken from street to street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this nonsense, you devil?\xe2\x80\x9d I demanded, fiercely enough,\r\nthough weak and trembling in every limb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is what some are pleased to call jugglery,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a\r\nlight, hard laugh.\r\n\r\nHe turned down Dupont street and I saw him no more until we met in the\r\nAuburn ravine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day after my second meeting with Dr. Dorrimore I did not see him:\r\nthe clerk in the Putnam House explained that a slight illness confined\r\nhim to his rooms.  That afternoon at the railway station I was surprised\r\nand made happy by the unexpected arrival of Miss Margaret Corray and her\r\nmother, from Oakland.\r\n\r\nThis is not a love story.  I am no storyteller, and love as it is cannot\r\nbe portrayed in a literature dominated and enthralled by the debasing\r\ntyranny which \xe2\x80\x9csentences letters\xe2\x80\x9d in the name of the Young Girl.  Under\r\nthe Young Girl\xe2\x80\x99s blighting reign\xe2\x80\x94or rather under the rule of those false\r\nMinisters of the Censure who have appointed themselves to the custody of\r\nher welfare\xe2\x80\x94love\r\n\r\n             veils her sacred fires,\r\n    And, unaware, Morality expires,\r\n\r\nfamished upon the sifted meal and distilled water of a prudish\r\npurveyance.\r\n\r\nLet it suffice that Miss Corray and I were engaged in marriage.  She and\r\nher mother went to the hotel at which I lived, and for two weeks I saw\r\nher daily.  That I was happy needs hardly be said; the only bar to my\r\nperfect enjoyment of those golden days was the presence of Dr. Dorrimore,\r\nwhom I had felt compelled to introduce to the ladies.\r\n\r\nBy them he was evidently held in favor.  What could I say?  I knew\r\nabsolutely nothing to his discredit.  His manners were those of a\r\ncultivated and considerate gentleman; and to women a man\xe2\x80\x99s manner is the\r\nman.  On one or two occasions when I saw Miss Corray walking with him I\r\nwas furious, and once had the indiscretion to protest.  Asked for\r\nreasons, I had none to give and fancied I saw in her expression a shade\r\nof contempt for the vagaries of a jealous mind.  In time I grew morose\r\nand consciously disagreeable, and resolved in my madness to return to San\r\nFrancisco the next day.  Of this, however, I said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was at Auburn an old, abandoned cemetery.  It was nearly in the\r\nheart of the town, yet by night it was as gruesome a place as the most\r\ndismal of human moods could crave.  The railings about the plats were\r\nprostrate, decayed, or altogether gone.  Many of the graves were sunken,\r\nfrom others grew sturdy pines, whose roots had committed unspeakable sin.\r\nThe headstones were fallen and broken across; brambles overran the\r\nground; the fence was mostly gone, and cows and pigs wandered there at\r\nwill; the place was a dishonor to the living, a calumny on the dead, a\r\nblasphemy against God.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the day on which I had taken my madman\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to\r\ndepart in anger from all that was dear to me found me in that congenial\r\nspot.  The light of the half moon fell ghostly through the foliage of\r\ntrees in spots and patches, revealing much that was unsightly, and the\r\nblack shadows seemed conspiracies withholding to the proper time\r\nrevelations of darker import.  Passing along what had been a gravel path,\r\nI saw emerging from shadow the figure of Dr. Dorrimore.  I was myself in\r\nshadow, and stood still with clenched hands and set teeth, trying to\r\ncontrol the impulse to leap upon and strangle him.  A moment later a\r\nsecond figure joined him and clung to his arm.  It was Margaret Corray!\r\n\r\nI cannot rightly relate what occurred.  I know that I sprang forward,\r\nbent upon murder; I know that I was found in the gray of the morning,\r\nbruised and bloody, with finger marks upon my throat.  I was taken to the\r\nPutnam House, where for days I lay in a delirium.  All this I know, for I\r\nhave been told.  And of my own knowledge I know that when consciousness\r\nreturned with convalescence I sent for the clerk of the hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre Mrs. Corray and her daughter still here?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody of that name has been here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg you will not trifle with me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said petulantly.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou see that I\r\nam all right now; tell me the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you my word,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied with evident sincerity, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have had no\r\nguests of that name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis words stupefied me.  I lay for a few moments in silence; then I\r\nasked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Dr. Dorrimore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe left on the morning of your fight and has not been heard of since.\r\nIt was a rough deal he gave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts of this case.  Margaret Corray is now my wife.  She\r\nhas never seen Auburn, and during the weeks whose history as it shaped\r\nitself in my brain I have endeavored to relate, was living at her home in\r\nOakland, wondering where her lover was and why he did not write.  The\r\nother day I saw in the Baltimore _Sun_ the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProfessor Valentine Dorrimore, the hypnotist, had a large audience last\r\nnight.  The lecturer, who has lived most of his life in India, gave some\r\nmarvelous exhibitions of his power, hypnotizing anyone who chose to\r\nsubmit himself to the experiment, by merely looking at him.  In fact, he\r\ntwice hypnotized the entire audience (reporters alone exempted), making\r\nall entertain the most extraordinary illusions.  The most valuable\r\nfeature of the lecture was the disclosure of the methods of the Hindu\r\njugglers in their famous performances, familiar in the mouths of\r\ntravelers.  The professor declares that these thaumaturgists have\r\nacquired such skill in the art which he learned at their feet that they\r\nperform their miracles by simply throwing the \xe2\x80\x98spectators\xe2\x80\x99 into a state\r\nof hypnosis and telling them what to see and hear.  His assertion that a\r\npeculiarly susceptible subject may be kept in the realm of the unreal for\r\nweeks, months, and even years, dominated by whatever delusions and\r\nhallucinations the operator may from time to time suggest, is a trifle\r\ndisquieting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BARTINE\xe2\x80\x99S WATCH\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A STORY BY A PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE exact time?  Good God! my friend, why do you insist?  One would\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94but what does it matter; it is easily bedtime\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that near\r\nenough?  But, here, if you must set your watch, take mine and see for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he detached his watch\xe2\x80\x94a tremendously heavy, old-fashioned\r\none\xe2\x80\x94from the chain, and handed it to me; then turned away, and walking\r\nacross the room to a shelf of books, began an examination of their backs.\r\nHis agitation and evident distress surprised me; they appeared\r\nreasonless.  Having set my watch by his, I stepped over to where he stood\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he took his timepiece and reattached it to the guard I observed that\r\nhis hands were unsteady.  With a tact upon which I greatly prided myself,\r\nI sauntered carelessly to the sideboard and took some brandy and water;\r\nthen, begging his pardon for my thoughtlessness, asked him to have some\r\nand went back to my seat by the fire, leaving him to help himself, as was\r\nour custom.  He did so and presently joined me at the hearth, as tranquil\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\nThis odd little incident occurred in my apartment, where John Bartine was\r\npassing an evening.  We had dined together at the club, had come home in\r\na cab and\xe2\x80\x94in short, everything had been done in the most prosaic way; and\r\nwhy John Bartine should break in upon the natural and established order\r\nof things to make himself spectacular with a display of emotion,\r\napparently for his own entertainment, I could nowise understand.  The\r\nmore I thought of it, while his brilliant conversational gifts were\r\ncommending themselves to my inattention, the more curious I grew, and of\r\ncourse had no difficulty in persuading myself that my curiosity was\r\nfriendly solicitude.  That is the disguise that curiosity usually assumes\r\nto evade resentment.  So I ruined one of the finest sentences of his\r\ndisregarded monologue by cutting it short without ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn Bartine,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must try to forgive me if I am wrong, but\r\nwith the light that I have at present I cannot concede your right to go\r\nall to pieces when asked the time o\xe2\x80\x99 night.  I cannot admit that it is\r\nproper to experience a mysterious reluctance to look your own watch in\r\nthe face and to cherish in my presence, without explanation, painful\r\nemotions which are denied to me, and which are none of my business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this ridiculous speech Bartine made no immediate reply, but sat\r\nlooking gravely into the fire.  Fearing that I had offended I was about\r\nto apologize and beg him to think no more about the matter, when looking\r\nme calmly in the eyes he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, the levity of your manner does not at all disguise the\r\nhideous impudence of your demand; but happily I had already decided to\r\ntell you what you wish to know, and no manifestation of your unworthiness\r\nto hear it shall alter my decision.  Be good enough to give me your\r\nattention and you shall hear all about the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis watch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chad been in my family for three generations\r\nbefore it fell to me.  Its original owner, for whom it was made, was my\r\ngreat-grandfather, Bramwell Olcott Bartine, a wealthy planter of Colonial\r\nVirginia, and as stanch a Tory as ever lay awake nights contriving new\r\nkinds of maledictions for the head of Mr. Washington, and new methods of\r\naiding and abetting good King George.  One day this worthy gentleman had\r\nthe deep misfortune to perform for his cause a service of capital\r\nimportance which was not recognized as legitimate by those who suffered\r\nits disadvantages.  It does not matter what it was, but among its minor\r\nconsequences was my excellent ancestor\xe2\x80\x99s arrest one night in his own\r\nhouse by a party of Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s rebels.  He was permitted to say\r\nfarewell to his weeping family, and was then marched away into the\r\ndarkness which swallowed him up forever.  Not the slenderest clew to his\r\nfate was ever found.  After the war the most diligent inquiry and the\r\noffer of large rewards failed to turn up any of his captors or any fact\r\nconcerning his disappearance.  He had disappeared, and that was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in Bartine\xe2\x80\x99s manner that was not in his words\xe2\x80\x94I hardly knew\r\nwhat it was\xe2\x80\x94prompted me to ask:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your view of the matter\xe2\x80\x94of the justice of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy view of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he flamed out, bringing his clenched hand down upon the\r\ntable as if he had been in a public house dicing with blackguards\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nview of it is that it was a characteristically dastardly assassination by\r\nthat damned traitor, Washington, and his ragamuffin rebels!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some minutes nothing was said: Bartine was recovering his temper, and\r\nI waited.  Then I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94there was something else.  A few weeks after my great-grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrest his watch was found lying on the porch at the front door of his\r\ndwelling.  It was wrapped in a sheet of letter paper bearing the name of\r\nRupert Bartine, his only son, my grandfather.  I am wearing that watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartine paused.  His usually restless black eyes were staring fixedly\r\ninto the grate, a point of red light in each, reflected from the glowing\r\ncoals.  He seemed to have forgotten me.  A sudden threshing of the\r\nbranches of a tree outside one of the windows, and almost at the same\r\ninstant a rattle of rain against the glass, recalled him to a sense of\r\nhis surroundings.  A storm had risen, heralded by a single gust of wind,\r\nand in a few moments the steady plash of the water on the pavement was\r\ndistinctly heard.  I hardly know why I relate this incident; it seemed\r\nsomehow to have a certain significance and relevancy which I am unable\r\nnow to discern.  It at least added an element of seriousness, almost\r\nsolemnity.  Bartine resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a singular feeling toward this watch\xe2\x80\x94a kind of affection for it;\r\nI like to have it about me, though partly from its weight, and partly for\r\na reason I shall now explain, I seldom carry it.  The reason is this:\r\nEvery evening when I have it with me I feel an unaccountable desire to\r\nopen and consult it, even if I can think of no reason for wishing to know\r\nthe time.  But if I yield to it, the moment my eyes rest upon the dial I\r\nam filled with a mysterious apprehension\xe2\x80\x94a sense of imminent calamity.\r\nAnd this is the more insupportable the nearer it is to eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nthis watch, no matter what the actual hour may be.  After the hands have\r\nregistered eleven the desire to look is gone; I am entirely indifferent.\r\nThen I can consult the thing as often as I like, with no more emotion\r\nthan you feel in looking at your own.  Naturally I have trained myself\r\nnot to look at that watch in the evening before eleven; nothing could\r\ninduce me.  Your insistence this evening upset me a trifle.  I felt very\r\nmuch as I suppose an opium-eater might feel if his yearning for his\r\nspecial and particular kind of hell were re-enforced by opportunity and\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that is my story, and I have told it in the interest of your\r\ntrumpery science; but if on any evening hereafter you observe me wearing\r\nthis damnable watch, and you have the thoughtfulness to ask me the hour,\r\nI shall beg leave to put you to the inconvenience of being knocked down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis humor did not amuse me.  I could see that in relating his delusion he\r\nwas again somewhat disturbed.  His concluding smile was positively\r\nghastly, and his eyes had resumed something more than their old\r\nrestlessness; they shifted hither and thither about the room with\r\napparent aimlessness and I fancied had taken on a wild expression, such\r\nas is sometimes observed in cases of dementia.  Perhaps this was my own\r\nimagination, but at any rate I was now persuaded that my friend was\r\nafflicted with a most singular and interesting monomania.  Without, I\r\ntrust, any abatement of my affectionate solicitude for him as a friend, I\r\nbegan to regard him as a patient, rich in possibilities of profitable\r\nstudy.  Why not?  Had he not described his delusion in the interest of\r\nscience?  Ah, poor fellow, he was doing more for science than he knew:\r\nnot only his story but himself was in evidence.  I should cure him if I\r\ncould, of course, but first I should make a little experiment in\r\npsychology\xe2\x80\x94nay, the experiment itself might be a step in his restoration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very frank and friendly of you, Bartine,\xe2\x80\x9d I said cordially, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m rather proud of your confidence.  It is all very odd, certainly.  Do\r\nyou mind showing me the watch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe detached it from his waistcoat, chain and all, and passed it to me\r\nwithout a word.  The case was of gold, very thick and strong, and\r\nsingularly engraved.  After closely examining the dial and observing that\r\nit was nearly twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I opened it at the back and was interested\r\nto observe an inner case of ivory, upon which was painted a miniature\r\nportrait in that exquisite and delicate manner which was in vogue during\r\nthe eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, feeling a sharp artistic delight\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chow\r\nunder the sun did you get that done?  I thought miniature painting on\r\nivory was a lost art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, gravely smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cis not I; it is my excellent\r\ngreat-grandfather, the late Bramwell Olcott Bartine, Esquire, of\r\nVirginia.  He was younger then than later\xe2\x80\x94about my age, in fact.  It is\r\nsaid to resemble me; do you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cResemble you?  I should say so!  Barring the costume, which I supposed\r\nyou to have assumed out of compliment to the art\xe2\x80\x94or for _vraisemblance_,\r\nso to say\xe2\x80\x94and the no mustache, that portrait is you in every feature,\r\nline, and expression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo more was said at that time.  Bartine took a book from the table and\r\nbegan reading.  I heard outside the incessant plash of the rain in the\r\nstreet.  There were occasional hurried footfalls on the sidewalks; and\r\nonce a slower, heavier tread seemed to cease at my door\xe2\x80\x94a policeman, I\r\nthought, seeking shelter in the doorway.  The boughs of the trees tapped\r\nsignificantly on the window panes, as if asking for admittance.  I\r\nremember it all through these years and years of a wiser, graver life.\r\n\r\nSeeing myself unobserved, I took the old-fashioned key that dangled from\r\nthe chain and quickly turned back the hands of the watch a full hour;\r\nthen, closing the case, I handed Bartine his property and saw him replace\r\nit on his person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you said,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, with assumed carelessness, \xe2\x80\x9cthat after\r\neleven the sight of the dial no longer affects you.  As it is now nearly\r\ntwelve\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94looking at my own timepiece\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cperhaps, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t resent my\r\npursuit of proof, you will look at it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled good-humoredly, pulled out the watch again, opened it, and\r\ninstantly sprang to his feet with a cry that Heaven has not had the mercy\r\nto permit me to forget!  His eyes, their blackness strikingly intensified\r\nby the pallor of his face, were fixed upon the watch, which he clutched\r\nin both hands.  For some time he remained in that attitude without\r\nuttering another sound; then, in a voice that I should not have\r\nrecognized as his, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn you! it is two minutes to eleven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not unprepared for some such outbreak, and without rising replied,\r\ncalmly enough:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon; I must have misread your watch in setting my own by\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shut the case with a sharp snap and put the watch in his pocket.  He\r\nlooked at me and made an attempt to smile, but his lower lip quivered and\r\nhe seemed unable to close his mouth.  His hands, also, were shaking, and\r\nhe thrust them, clenched, into the pockets of his sack-coat.  The\r\ncourageous spirit was manifestly endeavoring to subdue the coward body.\r\nThe effort was too great; he began to sway from side to side, as from\r\nvertigo, and before I could spring from my chair to support him his knees\r\ngave way and he pitched awkwardly forward and fell upon his face.  I\r\nsprang to assist him to rise; but when John Bartine rises we shall all\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ examination disclosed nothing; every organ was normal\r\nand sound.  But when the body had been prepared for burial a faint dark\r\ncircle was seen to have developed around the neck; at least I was so\r\nassured by several persons who said they saw it, but of my own knowledge\r\nI cannot say if that was true.\r\n\r\nNor can I set limitations to the law of heredity.  I do not know that in\r\nthe spiritual world a sentiment or emotion may not survive the heart that\r\nheld it, and seek expression in a kindred life, ages removed.  Surely, if\r\nI were to guess at the fate of Bramwell Olcott Bartine, I should guess\r\nthat he was hanged at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, and that he had been\r\nallowed several hours in which to prepare for the change.\r\n\r\nAs to John Bartine, my friend, my patient for five minutes, and\xe2\x80\x94Heaven\r\nforgive me!\xe2\x80\x94my victim for eternity, there is no more to say.  He is\r\nburied, and his watch with him\xe2\x80\x94I saw to that.  May God rest his soul in\r\nParadise, and the soul of his Virginian ancestor, if, indeed, they are\r\ntwo souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAMNED THING\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nONE DOES NOT ALWAYS EAT WHAT IS ON THE TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nBY the light of a tallow candle which had been placed on one end of a\r\nrough table a man was reading something written in a book.  It was an old\r\naccount book, greatly worn; and the writing was not, apparently, very\r\nlegible, for the man sometimes held the page close to the flame of the\r\ncandle to get a stronger light on it.  The shadow of the book would then\r\nthrow into obscurity a half of the room, darkening a number of faces and\r\nfigures; for besides the reader, eight other men were present.  Seven of\r\nthem sat against the rough log walls, silent, motionless, and the room\r\nbeing small, not very far from the table.  By extending an arm any one of\r\nthem could have touched the eighth man, who lay on the table, face\r\nupward, partly covered by a sheet, his arms at his sides.  He was dead.\r\n\r\nThe man with the book was not reading aloud, and no one spoke; all seemed\r\nto be waiting for something to occur; the dead man only was without\r\nexpectation.  From the blank darkness outside came in, through the\r\naperture that served for a window, all the ever unfamiliar noises of\r\nnight in the wilderness\xe2\x80\x94the long nameless note of a distant coyote; the\r\nstilly pulsing thrill of tireless insects in trees; strange cries of\r\nnight birds, so different from those of the birds of day; the drone of\r\ngreat blundering beetles, and all that mysterious chorus of small sounds\r\nthat seem always to have been but half heard when they have suddenly\r\nceased, as if conscious of an indiscretion.  But nothing of all this was\r\nnoted in that company; its members were not overmuch addicted to idle\r\ninterest in matters of no practical importance; that was obvious in every\r\nline of their rugged faces\xe2\x80\x94obvious even in the dim light of the single\r\ncandle.  They were evidently men of the vicinity\xe2\x80\x94farmers and woodsmen.\r\n\r\nThe person reading was a trifle different; one would have said of him\r\nthat he was of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his attire\r\nwhich attested a certain fellowship with the organisms of his\r\nenvironment.  His coat would hardly have passed muster in San Francisco;\r\nhis foot-gear was not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on the\r\nfloor (he was the only one uncovered) was such that if one had considered\r\nit as an article of mere personal adornment he would have missed its\r\nmeaning.  In countenance the man was rather prepossessing, with just a\r\nhint of sternness; though that he may have assumed or cultivated, as\r\nappropriate to one in authority.  For he was a coroner.  It was by virtue\r\nof his office that he had possession of the book in which he was reading;\r\nit had been found among the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s effects\xe2\x80\x94in his cabin, where the\r\ninquest was now taking place.\r\n\r\nWhen the coroner had finished reading he put the book into his breast\r\npocket.  At that moment the door was pushed open and a young man entered.\r\nHe, clearly, was not of mountain birth and breeding: he was clad as those\r\nwho dwell in cities.  His clothing was dusty, however, as from travel.\r\nHe had, in fact, been riding hard to attend the inquest.\r\n\r\nThe coroner nodded; no one else greeted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have waited for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary to have\r\ndone with this business to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to have kept you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI went\r\naway, not to evade your summons, but to post to my newspaper an account\r\nof what I suppose I am called back to relate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coroner smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe account that you posted to your newspaper,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdiffers,\r\nprobably, from that which you will give here under oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, rather hotly and with a visible flush, \xe2\x80\x9cis as\r\nyou please.  I used manifold paper and have a copy of what I sent.  It\r\nwas not written as news, for it is incredible, but as fiction.  It may go\r\nas a part of my testimony under oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you say it is incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is nothing to you, sir, if I also swear that it is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coroner was silent for a time, his eyes upon the floor.  The men\r\nabout the sides of the cabin talked in whispers, but seldom withdrew\r\ntheir gaze from the face of the corpse.  Presently the coroner lifted his\r\neyes and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe will resume the inquest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men removed their hats.  The witness was sworn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d the coroner asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam Harker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew the deceased, Hugh Morgan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were with him when he died?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did that happen\xe2\x80\x94your presence, I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was visiting him at this place to shoot and fish.  A part of my\r\npurpose, however, was to study him and his odd, solitary way of life.  He\r\nseemed a good model for a character in fiction.  I sometimes write\r\nstories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes read them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStories in general\xe2\x80\x94not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome of the jurors laughed.  Against a sombre background humor shows high\r\nlights.  Soldiers in the intervals of battle laugh easily, and a jest in\r\nthe death chamber conquers by surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRelate the circumstances of this man\xe2\x80\x99s death,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmay use any notes or memoranda that you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe witness understood.  Pulling a manuscript from his breast pocket he\r\nheld it near the candle and turning the leaves until he found the passage\r\nthat he wanted began to read.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nWHAT MAY HAPPEN IN A FIELD OF WILD OATS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... The sun had hardly risen when we left the house.  We were looking\r\nfor quail, each with a shotgun, but we had only one dog.  Morgan said\r\nthat our best ground was beyond a certain ridge that he pointed out, and\r\nwe crossed it by a trail through the _chaparral_.  On the other side was\r\ncomparatively level ground, thickly covered with wild oats.  As we\r\nemerged from the _chaparral_ Morgan was but a few yards in advance.\r\nSuddenly we heard, at a little distance to our right and partly in front,\r\na noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes, which we could\r\nsee were violently agitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve started a deer,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.  \xe2\x80\x98I wish we had brought a rifle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorgan, who had stopped and was intently watching the agitated\r\n_chaparral_, said nothing, but had cocked both barrels of his gun and was\r\nholding it in readiness to aim.  I thought him a trifle excited, which\r\nsurprised me, for he had a reputation for exceptional coolness, even in\r\nmoments of sudden and imminent peril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98O, come,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.  \xe2\x80\x98You are not going to fill up a deer with\r\nquail-shot, are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill he did not reply; but catching a sight of his face as he turned it\r\nslightly toward me I was struck by the intensity of his look.  Then I\r\nunderstood that we had serious business in hand and my first conjecture\r\nwas that we had \xe2\x80\x98jumped\xe2\x80\x99 a grizzly.  I advanced to Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s side, cocking\r\nmy piece as I moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bushes were now quiet and the sounds had ceased, but Morgan was as\r\nattentive to the place as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What is it?  What the devil is it?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That Damned Thing!\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, without turning his head.  His voice\r\nwas husky and unnatural.  He trembled visibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about to speak further, when I observed the wild oats near the\r\nplace of the disturbance moving in the most inexplicable way.  I can\r\nhardly describe it.  It seemed as if stirred by a streak of wind, which\r\nnot only bent it, but pressed it down\xe2\x80\x94crushed it so that it did not rise;\r\nand this movement was slowly prolonging itself directly toward us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing that I had ever seen had affected me so strangely as this\r\nunfamiliar and unaccountable phenomenon, yet I am unable to recall any\r\nsense of fear.  I remember\xe2\x80\x94and tell it here because, singularly enough, I\r\nrecollected it then\xe2\x80\x94that once in looking carelessly out of an open window\r\nI momentarily mistook a small tree close at hand for one of a group of\r\nlarger trees at a little distance away.  It looked the same size as the\r\nothers, but being more distinctly and sharply defined in mass and detail\r\nseemed out of harmony with them.  It was a mere falsification of the law\r\nof a\xc3\xabrial perspective, but it startled, almost terrified me.  We so rely\r\nupon the orderly operation of familiar natural laws that any seeming\r\nsuspension of them is noted as a menace to our safety, a warning of\r\nunthinkable calamity.  So now the apparently causeless movement of the\r\nherbage and the slow, undeviating approach of the line of disturbance\r\nwere distinctly disquieting.  My companion appeared actually frightened,\r\nand I could hardly credit my senses when I saw him suddenly throw his gun\r\nto his shoulder and fire both barrels at the agitated grain!  Before the\r\nsmoke of the discharge had cleared away I heard a loud savage cry\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nscream like that of a wild animal\xe2\x80\x94and flinging his gun upon the ground\r\nMorgan sprang away and ran swiftly from the spot.  At the same instant I\r\nwas thrown violently to the ground by the impact of something unseen in\r\nthe smoke\xe2\x80\x94some soft, heavy substance that seemed thrown against me with\r\ngreat force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seemed to have\r\nbeen struck from my hands, I heard Morgan crying out as if in mortal\r\nagony, and mingling with his cries were such hoarse, savage sounds as one\r\nhears from fighting dogs.  Inexpressibly terrified, I struggled to my\r\nfeet and looked in the direction of Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s retreat; and may Heaven in\r\nmercy spare me from another sight like that!  At a distance of less than\r\nthirty yards was my friend, down upon one knee, his head thrown back at a\r\nfrightful angle, hatless, his long hair in disorder and his whole body in\r\nviolent movement from side to side, backward and forward.  His right arm\r\nwas lifted and seemed to lack the hand\xe2\x80\x94at least, I could see none.  The\r\nother arm was invisible.  At times, as my memory now reports this\r\nextraordinary scene, I could discern but a part of his body; it was as if\r\nhe had been partly blotted out\xe2\x80\x94I cannot otherwise express it\xe2\x80\x94then a\r\nshifting of his position would bring it all into view again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this must have occurred within a few seconds, yet in that time\r\nMorgan assumed all the postures of a determined wrestler vanquished by\r\nsuperior weight and strength.  I saw nothing but him, and him not always\r\ndistinctly.  During the entire incident his shouts and curses were heard,\r\nas if through an enveloping uproar of such sounds of rage and fury as I\r\nhad never heard from the throat of man or brute!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a moment only I stood irresolute, then throwing down my gun I ran\r\nforward to my friend\xe2\x80\x99s assistance.  I had a vague belief that he was\r\nsuffering from a fit, or some form of convulsion.  Before I could reach\r\nhis side he was down and quiet.  All sounds had ceased, but with a\r\nfeeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired I now\r\nsaw again the mysterious movement of the wild oats, prolonging itself\r\nfrom the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of a wood.\r\nIt was only when it had reached the wood that I was able to withdraw my\r\neyes and look at my companion.  He was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nA MAN THOUGH NAKED MAY BE IN RAGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man.  Lifting an\r\nedge of the sheet he pulled it away, exposing the entire body, altogether\r\nnaked and showing in the candle-light a claylike yellow.  It had,\r\nhowever, broad maculations of bluish black, obviously caused by\r\nextravasated blood from contusions.  The chest and sides looked as if\r\nthey had been beaten with a bludgeon.  There were dreadful lacerations;\r\nthe skin was torn in strips and shreds.\r\n\r\nThe coroner moved round to the end of the table and undid a silk\r\nhandkerchief which had been passed under the chin and knotted on the top\r\nof the head.  When the handkerchief was drawn away it exposed what had\r\nbeen the throat.  Some of the jurors who had risen to get a better view\r\nrepented their curiosity and turned away their faces.  Witness Harker\r\nwent to the open window and leaned out across the sill, faint and sick.\r\nDropping the handkerchief upon the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s neck the coroner stepped to\r\nan angle of the room and from a pile of clothing produced one garment\r\nafter another, each of which he held up a moment for inspection.  All\r\nwere torn, and stiff with blood.  The jurors did not make a closer\r\ninspection.  They seemed rather uninterested.  They had, in truth, seen\r\nall this before; the only thing that was new to them being Harker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d the coroner said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have no more evidence, I think.  Your\r\nduty has been already explained to you; if there is nothing you wish to\r\nask you may go outside and consider your verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe foreman rose\xe2\x80\x94a tall, bearded man of sixty, coarsely clad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to ask one question, Mr. Coroner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat asylum\r\ndid this yer last witness escape from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Harker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coroner, gravely and tranquilly, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom what asylum\r\ndid you last escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarker flushed crimson again, but said nothing, and the seven jurors rose\r\nand solemnly filed out of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have done insulting me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harker, as soon as he and the\r\nofficer were left alone with the dead man, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I am at liberty to\r\ngo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarker started to leave, but paused, with his hand on the door latch.\r\nThe habit of his profession was strong in him\xe2\x80\x94stronger than his sense of\r\npersonal dignity.  He turned about and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe book that you have there\xe2\x80\x94I recognize it as Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s diary.  You\r\nseemed greatly interested in it; you read in it while I was testifying.\r\nMay I see it?  The public would like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe book will cut no figure in this matter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the official,\r\nslipping it into his coat pocket; \xe2\x80\x9call the entries in it were made before\r\nthe writer\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Harker passed out of the house the jury reentered and stood about the\r\ntable, on which the now covered corpse showed under the sheet with sharp\r\ndefinition.  The foreman seated himself near the candle, produced from\r\nhis breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper and wrote rather\r\nlaboriously the following verdict, which with various degrees of effort\r\nall signed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hands\r\nof a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nAN EXPLANATION FROM THE TOMB\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the diary of the late Hugh Morgan are certain interesting entries\r\nhaving, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions.  At the inquest upon\r\nhis body the book was not put in evidence; possibly the coroner thought\r\nit not worth while to confuse the jury.  The date of the first of the\r\nentries mentioned cannot be ascertained; the upper part of the leaf is\r\ntorn away; the part of the entry remaining follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... would run in a half-circle, keeping his head turned always toward\r\nthe centre, and again he would stand still, barking furiously.  At last\r\nhe ran away into the brush as fast as he could go.  I thought at first\r\nthat he had gone mad, but on returning to the house found no other\r\nalteration in his manner than what was obviously due to fear of\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan a dog see with his nose?  Do odors impress some cerebral centre with\r\nimages of the thing that emitted them? . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSept. 2.\xe2\x80\x94Looking at the stars last night as they rose above the crest of\r\nthe ridge east of the house, I observed them successively disappear\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nleft to right.  Each was eclipsed but an instant, and only a few at the\r\nsame time, but along the entire length of the ridge all that were within\r\na degree or two of the crest were blotted out.  It was as if something\r\nhad passed along between me and them; but I could not see it, and the\r\nstars were not thick enough to define its outline.  Ugh!  I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks\xe2\x80\x99 entries are missing, three leaves being torn from the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSept. 27.\xe2\x80\x94It has been about here again\xe2\x80\x94I find evidences of its presence\r\nevery day.  I watched again all last night in the same cover, gun in\r\nhand, double-charged with buckshot.  In the morning the fresh footprints\r\nwere there, as before.  Yet I would have sworn that I did not\r\nsleep\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I hardly sleep at all.  It is terrible, insupportable!  If\r\nthese amazing experiences are real I shall go mad; if they are fanciful I\r\nam mad already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOct. 3.\xe2\x80\x94I shall not go\xe2\x80\x94it shall not drive me away.  No, this is _my_\r\nhouse, _my_ land.  God hates a coward . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOct. 5.\xe2\x80\x94I can stand it no longer; I have invited Harker to pass a few\r\nweeks with me\xe2\x80\x94he has a level head.  I can judge from his manner if he\r\nthinks me mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOct. 7.\xe2\x80\x94I have the solution of the mystery; it came to me last\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94suddenly, as by revelation.  How simple\xe2\x80\x94how terribly simple!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are sounds that we cannot hear.  At either end of the scale are\r\nnotes that stir no chord of that imperfect instrument, the human ear.\r\nThey are too high or too grave.  I have observed a flock of blackbirds\r\noccupying an entire tree-top\xe2\x80\x94the tops of several trees\xe2\x80\x94and all in full\r\nsong.  Suddenly\xe2\x80\x94in a moment\xe2\x80\x94at absolutely the same instant\xe2\x80\x94all spring\r\ninto the air and fly away.  How?  They could not all see one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x94whole tree-tops intervened.  At no point could a leader have been\r\nvisible to all.  There must have been a signal of warning or command,\r\nhigh and shrill above the din, but by me unheard.  I have observed, too,\r\nthe same simultaneous flight when all were silent, among not only\r\nblackbirds, but other birds\xe2\x80\x94quail, for example, widely separated by\r\nbushes\xe2\x80\x94even on opposite sides of a hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is known to seamen that a school of whales basking or sporting on the\r\nsurface of the ocean, miles apart, with the convexity of the earth\r\nbetween, will sometimes dive at the same instant\xe2\x80\x94all gone out of sight in\r\na moment.  The signal has been sounded\xe2\x80\x94too grave for the ear of the\r\nsailor at the masthead and his comrades on the deck\xe2\x80\x94who nevertheless feel\r\nits vibrations in the ship as the stones of a cathedral are stirred by\r\nthe bass of the organ.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs with sounds, so with colors.  At each end of the solar spectrum the\r\nchemist can detect the presence of what are known as \xe2\x80\x98actinic\xe2\x80\x99 rays.\r\nThey represent colors\xe2\x80\x94integral colors in the composition of light\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwe are unable to discern.  The human eye is an imperfect instrument; its\r\nrange is but a few octaves of the real \xe2\x80\x98chromatic scale.\xe2\x80\x99  I am not mad;\r\nthere are colors that we cannot see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, God help me! the Damned Thing is of such a color!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHA\xc3\x8fTA THE SHEPHERD\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the heart of Ha\xc3\xafta the illusions of youth had not been supplanted by\r\nthose of age and experience.  His thoughts were pure and pleasant, for\r\nhis life was simple and his soul devoid of ambition.  He rose with the\r\nsun and went forth to pray at the shrine of Hastur, the god of shepherds,\r\nwho heard and was pleased.  After performance of this pious rite Ha\xc3\xafta\r\nunbarred the gate of the fold and with a cheerful mind drove his flock\r\nafield, eating his morning meal of curds and oat cake as he went,\r\noccasionally pausing to add a few berries, cold with dew, or to drink of\r\nthe waters that came away from the hills to join the stream in the middle\r\nof the valley and be borne along with it, he knew not whither.\r\n\r\nDuring the long summer day, as his sheep cropped the good grass which the\r\ngods had made to grow for them, or lay with their forelegs doubled under\r\ntheir breasts and chewed the cud, Ha\xc3\xafta, reclining in the shadow of a\r\ntree, or sitting upon a rock, played so sweet music upon his reed pipe\r\nthat sometimes from the corner of his eye he got accidental glimpses of\r\nthe minor sylvan deities, leaning forward out of the copse to hear; but\r\nif he looked at them directly they vanished.  From this\xe2\x80\x94for he must be\r\nthinking if he would not turn into one of his own sheep\xe2\x80\x94he drew the\r\nsolemn inference that happiness may come if not sought, but if looked for\r\nwill never be seen; for next to the favor of Hastur, who never disclosed\r\nhimself, Ha\xc3\xafta most valued the friendly interest of his neighbors, the\r\nshy immortals of the wood and stream.  At nightfall he drove his flock\r\nback to the fold, saw that the gate was secure and retired to his cave\r\nfor refreshment and for dreams.\r\n\r\nSo passed his life, one day like another, save when the storms uttered\r\nthe wrath of an offended god.  Then Ha\xc3\xafta cowered in his cave, his face\r\nhidden in his hands, and prayed that he alone might be punished for his\r\nsins and the world saved from destruction.  Sometimes when there was a\r\ngreat rain, and the stream came out of its banks, compelling him to urge\r\nhis terrified flock to the uplands, he interceded for the people in the\r\ncities which he had been told lay in the plain beyond the two blue hills\r\nforming the gateway of his valley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is kind of thee, O Hastur,\xe2\x80\x9d so he prayed, \xe2\x80\x9cto give me mountains so\r\nnear to my dwelling and my fold that I and my sheep can escape the angry\r\ntorrents; but the rest of the world thou must thyself deliver in some way\r\nthat I know not of, or I will no longer worship thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Hastur, knowing that Ha\xc3\xafta was a youth who kept his word, spared the\r\ncities and turned the waters into the sea.\r\n\r\nSo he had lived since he could remember.  He could not rightly conceive\r\nany other mode of existence.  The holy hermit who dwelt at the head of\r\nthe valley, a full hour\xe2\x80\x99s journey away, from whom he had heard the tale\r\nof the great cities where dwelt people\xe2\x80\x94poor souls!\xe2\x80\x94who had no sheep, gave\r\nhim no knowledge of that early time, when, so he reasoned, he must have\r\nbeen small and helpless like a lamb.\r\n\r\nIt was through thinking on these mysteries and marvels, and on that\r\nhorrible change to silence and decay which he felt sure must some time\r\ncome to him, as he had seen it come to so many of his flock\xe2\x80\x94as it came to\r\nall living things except the birds\xe2\x80\x94that Ha\xc3\xafta first became conscious how\r\nmiserable and hopeless was his lot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I know whence and how I came; for how\r\ncan one perform his duties unless able to judge what they are by the way\r\nin which he was intrusted with them?  And what contentment can I have\r\nwhen I know not how long it is going to last?  Perhaps before another sun\r\nI may be changed, and then what will become of the sheep?  What, indeed,\r\nwill have become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPondering these things Ha\xc3\xafta became melancholy and morose.  He no longer\r\nspoke cheerfully to his flock, nor ran with alacrity to the shrine of\r\nHastur.  In every breeze he heard whispers of malign deities whose\r\nexistence he now first observed.  Every cloud was a portent signifying\r\ndisaster, and the darkness was full of terrors.  His reed pipe when\r\napplied to his lips gave out no melody, but a dismal wail; the sylvan and\r\nriparian intelligences no longer thronged the thicket-side to listen, but\r\nfled from the sound, as he knew by the stirred leaves and bent flowers.\r\nHe relaxed his vigilance and many of his sheep strayed away into the\r\nhills and were lost.  Those that remained became lean and ill for lack of\r\ngood pasturage, for he would not seek it for them, but conducted them day\r\nafter day to the same spot, through mere abstraction, while puzzling\r\nabout life and death\xe2\x80\x94of immortality he knew not.\r\n\r\nOne day while indulging in the gloomiest reflections he suddenly sprang\r\nfrom the rock upon which he sat, and with a determined gesture of the\r\nright hand exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cI will no longer be a suppliant for knowledge\r\nwhich the gods withhold.  Let them look to it that they do me no wrong.\r\nI will do my duty as best I can and if I err upon their own heads be it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as he spoke, a great brightness fell about him, causing him to\r\nlook upward, thinking the sun had burst through a rift in the clouds; but\r\nthere were no clouds.  No more than an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length away stood a\r\nbeautiful maiden.  So beautiful she was that the flowers about her feet\r\nfolded their petals in despair and bent their heads in token of\r\nsubmission; so sweet her look that the humming birds thronged her eyes,\r\nthrusting their thirsty bills almost into them, and the wild bees were\r\nabout her lips.  And such was her brightness that the shadows of all\r\nobjects lay divergent from her feet, turning as she moved.\r\n\r\nHa\xc3\xafta was entranced.  Rising, he knelt before her in adoration, and she\r\nlaid her hand upon his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a voice that had the music of all the bells of his\r\nflock\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccome, thou art not to worship me, who am no goddess, but if thou\r\nart truthful and dutiful I will abide with thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHa\xc3\xafta seized her hand, and stammering his joy and gratitude arose, and\r\nhand in hand they stood and smiled into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.  He gazed on\r\nher with reverence and rapture.  He said: \xe2\x80\x9cI pray thee, lovely maid, tell\r\nme thy name and whence and why thou comest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this she laid a warning finger on her lip and began to withdraw.  Her\r\nbeauty underwent a visible alteration that made him shudder, he knew not\r\nwhy, for still she was beautiful.  The landscape was darkened by a giant\r\nshadow sweeping across the valley with the speed of a vulture.  In the\r\nobscurity the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s figure grew dim and indistinct and her voice\r\nseemed to come from a distance, as she said, in a tone of sorrowful\r\nreproach: \xe2\x80\x9cPresumptuous and ungrateful youth! must I then so soon leave\r\nthee?  Would nothing do but thou must at once break the eternal compact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInexpressibly grieved, Ha\xc3\xafta fell upon his knees and implored her to\r\nremain\xe2\x80\x94rose and sought her in the deepening darkness\xe2\x80\x94ran in circles,\r\ncalling to her aloud, but all in vain.  She was no longer visible, but\r\nout of the gloom he heard her voice saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNay, thou shalt not have me\r\nby seeking.  Go to thy duty, faithless shepherd, or we shall never meet\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight had fallen; the wolves were howling in the hills and the terrified\r\nsheep crowding about Ha\xc3\xafta\xe2\x80\x99s feet.  In the demands of the hour he forgot\r\nhis disappointment, drove his sheep to the fold and repairing to the\r\nplace of worship poured out his heart in gratitude to Hastur for\r\npermitting him to save his flock, then retired to his cave and slept.\r\n\r\nWhen Ha\xc3\xafta awoke the sun was high and shone in at the cave, illuminating\r\nit with a great glory.  And there, beside him, sat the maiden.  She\r\nsmiled upon him with a smile that seemed the visible music of his pipe of\r\nreeds.  He dared not speak, fearing to offend her as before, for he knew\r\nnot what he could venture to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthou didst thy duty by the flock, and didst not\r\nforget to thank Hastur for staying the wolves of the night, I am come to\r\nthee again.  Wilt thou have me for a companion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho would not have thee forever?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ha\xc3\xafta.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh! never again leave\r\nme until\xe2\x80\x94until I\xe2\x80\x94change and become silent and motionless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHa\xc3\xafta had no word for death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat thou wert of my own sex, that we\r\nmight wrestle and run races and so never tire of being together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words the maiden arose and passed out of the cave, and Ha\xc3\xafta,\r\nspringing from his couch of fragrant boughs to overtake and detain her,\r\nobserved to his astonishment that the rain was falling and the stream in\r\nthe middle of the valley had come out of its banks.  The sheep were\r\nbleating in terror, for the rising waters had invaded their fold.  And\r\nthere was danger for the unknown cities of the distant plain.\r\n\r\nIt was many days before Ha\xc3\xafta saw the maiden again.  One day he was\r\nreturning from the head of the valley, where he had gone with ewe\xe2\x80\x99s milk\r\nand oat cake and berries for the holy hermit, who was too old and feeble\r\nto provide himself with food.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old man!\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud, as he trudged along homeward.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nreturn to-morrow and bear him on my back to my own dwelling, where I can\r\ncare for him.  Doubtless it is for this that Hastur has reared me all\r\nthese many years, and gives me health and strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the maiden, clad in glittering garments, met him in the path\r\nwith a smile that took away his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am come again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto dwell with thee if thou wilt now have\r\nme, for none else will.  Thou mayest have learned wisdom, and art willing\r\nto take me as I am, nor care to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHa\xc3\xafta threw himself at her feet.  \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful being,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou\r\nwilt but deign to accept all the devotion of my heart and soul\xe2\x80\x94after\r\nHastur be served\xe2\x80\x94it is thine forever.  But, alas! thou art capricious and\r\nwayward.  Before to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s sun I may lose thee again.  Promise, I\r\nbeseech thee, that however in my ignorance I may offend, thou wilt\r\nforgive and remain always with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScarcely had he finished speaking when a troop of bears came out of the\r\nhills, racing toward him with crimson mouths and fiery eyes.  The maiden\r\nagain vanished, and he turned and fled for his life.  Nor did he stop\r\nuntil he was in the cot of the holy hermit, whence he had set out.\r\nHastily barring the door against the bears he cast himself upon the\r\nground and wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit from his couch of straw, freshly gathered that\r\nmorning by Ha\xc3\xafta\xe2\x80\x99s hands, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not like thee to weep for bears\xe2\x80\x94tell me\r\nwhat sorrow hath befallen thee, that age may minister to the hurts of\r\nyouth with such balms as it hath of its wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHa\xc3\xafta told him all: how thrice he had met the radiant maid, and thrice\r\nshe had left him forlorn.  He related minutely all that had passed\r\nbetween them, omitting no word of what had been said.\r\n\r\nWhen he had ended, the holy hermit was a moment silent, then said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nson, I have attended to thy story, and I know the maiden.  I have myself\r\nseen her, as have many.  Know, then, that her name, which she would not\r\neven permit thee to inquire, is Happiness.  Thou saidst the truth to her,\r\nthat she is capricious for she imposeth conditions that man cannot\r\nfulfill, and delinquency is punished by desertion.  She cometh only when\r\nunsought, and will not be questioned.  One manifestation of curiosity,\r\none sign of doubt, one expression of misgiving, and she is away!  How\r\nlong didst thou have her at any time before she fled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a single instant,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ha\xc3\xafta, blushing with shame at the\r\nconfession.  \xe2\x80\x9cEach time I drove her away in one moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunate youth!\xe2\x80\x9d said the holy hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for thine indiscretion\r\nthou mightst have had her for two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INHABITANT OF CARCOSA\r\n\r\n\r\n    For there be divers sorts of death\xe2\x80\x94some wherein the body remaineth;\r\n    and in some it vanisheth quite away with the spirit.  This commonly\r\n    occurreth only in solitude (such is God\xe2\x80\x99s will) and, none seeing the\r\n    end, we say the man is lost, or gone on a long journey\xe2\x80\x94which indeed\r\n    he hath; but sometimes it hath happened in sight of many, as abundant\r\n    testimony showeth.  In one kind of death the spirit also dieth, and\r\n    this it hath been known to do while yet the body was in vigor for\r\n    many years.  Sometimes, as is veritably attested, it dieth with the\r\n    body, but after a season is raised up again in that place where the\r\n    body did decay.\r\n\r\nPONDERING these words of Hali (whom God rest) and questioning their full\r\nmeaning, as one who, having an intimation, yet doubts if there be not\r\nsomething behind, other than that which he has discerned, I noted not\r\nwhither I had strayed until a sudden chill wind striking my face revived\r\nin me a sense of my surroundings.  I observed with astonishment that\r\neverything seemed unfamiliar.  On every side of me stretched a bleak and\r\ndesolate expanse of plain, covered with a tall overgrowth of sere grass,\r\nwhich rustled and whistled in the autumn wind with heaven knows what\r\nmysterious and disquieting suggestion.  Protruded at long intervals above\r\nit, stood strangely shaped and somber-colored rocks, which seemed to have\r\nan understanding with one another and to exchange looks of uncomfortable\r\nsignificance, as if they had reared their heads to watch the issue of\r\nsome foreseen event.  A few blasted trees here and there appeared as\r\nleaders in this malevolent conspiracy of silent expectation.\r\n\r\nThe day, I thought, must be far advanced, though the sun was invisible;\r\nand although sensible that the air was raw and chill my consciousness of\r\nthat fact was rather mental than physical\xe2\x80\x94I had no feeling of discomfort.\r\nOver all the dismal landscape a canopy of low, lead-colored clouds hung\r\nlike a visible curse.  In all this there were a menace and a portent\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhint of evil, an intimation of doom.  Bird, beast, or insect there was\r\nnone.  The wind sighed in the bare branches of the dead trees and the\r\ngray grass bent to whisper its dread secret to the earth; but no other\r\nsound nor motion broke the awful repose of that dismal place.\r\n\r\nI observed in the herbage a number of weather-worn stones, evidently\r\nshaped with tools.  They were broken, covered with moss and half sunken\r\nin the earth.  Some lay prostrate, some leaned at various angles, none\r\nwas vertical.  They were obviously headstones of graves, though the\r\ngraves themselves no longer existed as either mounds or depressions; the\r\nyears had leveled all.  Scattered here and there, more massive blocks\r\nshowed where some pompous tomb or ambitious monument had once flung its\r\nfeeble defiance at oblivion.  So old seemed these relics, these vestiges\r\nof vanity and memorials of affection and piety, so battered and worn and\r\nstained\xe2\x80\x94so neglected, deserted, forgotten the place, that I could not\r\nhelp thinking myself the discoverer of the burial-ground of a prehistoric\r\nrace of men whose very name was long extinct.\r\n\r\nFilled with these reflections, I was for some time heedless of the\r\nsequence of my own experiences, but soon I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHow came I hither?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nA moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection seemed to make this all clear and explain at the\r\nsame time, though in a disquieting way, the singular character with which\r\nmy fancy had invested all that I saw or heard.  I was ill.  I remembered\r\nnow that I had been prostrated by a sudden fever, and that my family had\r\ntold me that in my periods of delirium I had constantly cried out for\r\nliberty and air, and had been held in bed to prevent my escape\r\nout-of-doors.  Now I had eluded the vigilance of my attendants and had\r\nwandered hither to\xe2\x80\x94to where?  I could not conjecture.  Clearly I was at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the city where I dwelt\xe2\x80\x94the ancient and famous\r\ncity of Carcosa.\r\n\r\nNo signs of human life were anywhere visible nor audible; no rising\r\nsmoke, no watch-dog\xe2\x80\x99s bark, no lowing of cattle, no shouts of children at\r\nplay\xe2\x80\x94nothing but that dismal burial-place, with its air of mystery and\r\ndread, due to my own disordered brain.  Was I not becoming again\r\ndelirious, there beyond human aid?  Was it not indeed _all_ an illusion\r\nof my madness?  I called aloud the names of my wives and sons, reached\r\nout my hands in search of theirs, even as I walked among the crumbling\r\nstones and in the withered grass.\r\n\r\nA noise behind me caused me to turn about.  A wild animal\xe2\x80\x94a lynx\xe2\x80\x94was\r\napproaching.  The thought came to me: If I break down here in the\r\ndesert\xe2\x80\x94if the fever return and I fail, this beast will be at my throat.\r\nI sprang toward it, shouting.  It trotted tranquilly by within a hand\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreadth of me and disappeared behind a rock.\r\n\r\nA moment later a man\xe2\x80\x99s head appeared to rise out of the ground a short\r\ndistance away.  He was ascending the farther slope of a low hill whose\r\ncrest was hardly to be distinguished from the general level.  His whole\r\nfigure soon came into view against the background of gray cloud.  He was\r\nhalf naked, half clad in skins.  His hair was unkempt, his beard long and\r\nragged.  In one hand he carried a bow and arrow; the other held a blazing\r\ntorch with a long trail of black smoke.  He walked slowly and with\r\ncaution, as if he feared falling into some open grave concealed by the\r\ntall grass.  This strange apparition surprised but did not alarm, and\r\ntaking such a course as to intercept him I met him almost face to face,\r\naccosting him with the familiar salutation, \xe2\x80\x9cGod keep you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave no heed, nor did he arrest his pace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI am ill and lost.  Direct me, I beseech\r\nyou, to Carcosa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man broke into a barbarous chant in an unknown tongue, passing on and\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAn owl on the branch of a decayed tree hooted dismally and was answered\r\nby another in the distance.  Looking upward, I saw through a sudden rift\r\nin the clouds Aldebaran and the Hyades!  In all this there was a hint of\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94the lynx, the man with the torch, the owl.  Yet I saw\xe2\x80\x94I saw even\r\nthe stars in absence of the darkness.  I saw, but was apparently not seen\r\nnor heard.  Under what awful spell did I exist?\r\n\r\nI seated myself at the root of a great tree, seriously to consider what\r\nit were best to do.  That I was mad I could no longer doubt, yet\r\nrecognized a ground of doubt in the conviction.  Of fever I had no trace.\r\nI had, withal, a sense of exhilaration and vigor altogether unknown to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94a feeling of mental and physical exaltation.  My senses seemed all\r\nalert; I could feel the air as a ponderous substance; I could hear the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nA great root of the giant tree against whose trunk I leaned as I sat held\r\ninclosed in its grasp a slab of stone, a part of which protruded into a\r\nrecess formed by another root.  The stone was thus partly protected from\r\nthe weather, though greatly decomposed.  Its edges were worn round, its\r\ncorners eaten away, its surface deeply furrowed and scaled.  Glittering\r\nparticles of mica were visible in the earth about it\xe2\x80\x94vestiges of its\r\ndecomposition.  This stone had apparently marked the grave out of which\r\nthe tree had sprung ages ago.  The tree\xe2\x80\x99s exacting roots had robbed the\r\ngrave and made the stone a prisoner.\r\n\r\nA sudden wind pushed some dry leaves and twigs from the uppermost face of\r\nthe stone; I saw the low-relief letters of an inscription and bent to\r\nread it.  God in Heaven! _my_ name in full!\xe2\x80\x94the date of _my_ birth!\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndate of _my_ death!\r\n\r\nA level shaft of light illuminated the whole side of the tree as I sprang\r\nto my feet in terror.  The sun was rising in the rosy east.  I stood\r\nbetween the tree and his broad red disk\xe2\x80\x94no shadow darkened the trunk!\r\n\r\nA chorus of howling wolves saluted the dawn.  I saw them sitting on their\r\nhaunches, singly and in groups, on the summits of irregular mounds and\r\ntumuli filling a half of my desert prospect and extending to the horizon.\r\nAnd then I knew that these were ruins of the ancient and famous city of\r\nCarcosa.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts imparted to the medium Bayrolles by the spirit Hoseib\r\nAlar Robardin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAN stepped out of the darkness into the little illuminated circle\r\nabout our failing campfire and seated himself upon a rock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not the first to explore this region,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gravely.\r\n\r\nNobody controverted his statement; he was himself proof of its truth, for\r\nhe was not of our party and must have been somewhere near when we camped.\r\nMoreover, he must have companions not far away; it was not a place where\r\none would be living or traveling alone.  For more than a week we had\r\nseen, besides ourselves and our animals, only such living things as\r\nrattlesnakes and horned toads.  In an Arizona desert one does not long\r\ncoexist with only such creatures as these: one must have pack animals,\r\nsupplies, arms\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9can outfit.\xe2\x80\x9d  And all these imply comrades.  It was\r\nperhaps a doubt as to what manner of men this unceremonious stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomrades might be, together with something in his words interpretable as\r\na challenge, that caused every man of our half-dozen \xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen\r\nadventurers\xe2\x80\x9d to rise to a sitting posture and lay his hand upon a\r\nweapon\xe2\x80\x94an act signifying, in that time and place, a policy of\r\nexpectation.  The stranger gave the matter no attention and began again\r\nto speak in the same deliberate, uninflected monotone in which he had\r\ndelivered his first sentence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty years ago Ramon Gallegos, William Shaw, George W. Kent and Berry\r\nDavis, all of Tucson, crossed the Santa Catalina mountains and traveled\r\ndue west, as nearly as the configuration of the country permitted.  We\r\nwere prospecting and it was our intention, if we found nothing, to push\r\nthrough to the Gila river at some point near Big Bend, where we\r\nunderstood there was a settlement.  We had a good outfit but no\r\nguide\xe2\x80\x94just Ramon Gallegos, William Shaw, George W. Kent and Berry Davis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man repeated the names slowly and distinctly, as if to fix them in\r\nthe memories of his audience, every member of which was now attentively\r\nobserving him, but with a slackened apprehension regarding his possible\r\ncompanions somewhere in the darkness that seemed to enclose us like a\r\nblack wall; in the manner of this volunteer historian was no suggestion\r\nof an unfriendly purpose.  His act was rather that of a harmless lunatic\r\nthan an enemy.  We were not so new to the country as not to know that the\r\nsolitary life of many a plainsman had a tendency to develop\r\neccentricities of conduct and character not always easily distinguishable\r\nfrom mental aberration.  A man is like a tree: in a forest of his fellows\r\nhe will grow as straight as his generic and individual nature permits;\r\nalone in the open, he yields to the deforming stresses and tortions that\r\nenviron him.  Some such thoughts were in my mind as I watched the man\r\nfrom the shadow of my hat, pulled low to shut out the firelight.  A\r\nwitless fellow, no doubt, but what could he be doing there in the heart\r\nof a desert?\r\n\r\nHaving undertaken to tell this story, I wish that I could describe the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s appearance; that would be a natural thing to do.  Unfortunately,\r\nand somewhat strangely, I find myself unable to do so with any degree of\r\nconfidence, for afterward no two of us agreed as to what he wore and how\r\nhe looked; and when I try to set down my own impressions they elude me.\r\nAnyone can tell some kind of story; narration is one of the elemental\r\npowers of the race.  But the talent for description is a gift.\r\n\r\nNobody having broken silence the visitor went on to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis country was not then what it is now.  There was not a ranch between\r\nthe Gila and the Gulf.  There was a little game here and there in the\r\nmountains, and near the infrequent water-holes grass enough to keep our\r\nanimals from starvation.  If we should be so fortunate as to encounter no\r\nIndians we might get through.  But within a week the purpose of the\r\nexpedition had altered from discovery of wealth to preservation of life.\r\nWe had gone too far to go back, for what was ahead could be no worse than\r\nwhat was behind; so we pushed on, riding by night to avoid Indians and\r\nthe intolerable heat, and concealing ourselves by day as best we could.\r\nSometimes, having exhausted our supply of wild meat and emptied our\r\ncasks, we were days without food or drink; then a water-hole or a shallow\r\npool in the bottom of an _arroyo_ so restored our strength and sanity\r\nthat we were able to shoot some of the wild animals that sought it also.\r\nSometimes it was a bear, sometimes an antelope, a coyote, a cougar\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwas as God pleased; all were food.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne morning as we skirted a mountain range, seeking a practicable pass,\r\nwe were attacked by a band of Apaches who had followed our trail up a\r\ngulch\xe2\x80\x94it is not far from here.  Knowing that they outnumbered us ten to\r\none, they took none of their usual cowardly precautions, but dashed upon\r\nus at a gallop, firing and yelling.  Fighting was out of the question: we\r\nurged our feeble animals up the gulch as far as there was footing for a\r\nhoof, then threw ourselves out of our saddles and took to the _chaparral_\r\non one of the slopes, abandoning our entire outfit to the enemy.  But we\r\nretained our rifles, every man\xe2\x80\x94Ramon Gallegos, William Shaw, George W.\r\nKent and Berry Davis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame old crowd,\xe2\x80\x9d said the humorist of our party.  He was an Eastern man,\r\nunfamiliar with the decent observances of social intercourse.  A gesture\r\nof disapproval from our leader silenced him and the stranger proceeded\r\nwith his tale:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe savages dismounted also, and some of them ran up the gulch beyond\r\nthe point at which we had left it, cutting off further retreat in that\r\ndirection and forcing us on up the side.  Unfortunately the _chaparral_\r\nextended only a short distance up the slope, and as we came into the open\r\nground above we took the fire of a dozen rifles; but Apaches shoot badly\r\nwhen in a hurry, and God so willed it that none of us fell.  Twenty yards\r\nup the slope, beyond the edge of the brush, were vertical cliffs, in\r\nwhich, directly in front of us, was a narrow opening.  Into that we ran,\r\nfinding ourselves in a cavern about as large as an ordinary room in a\r\nhouse.  Here for a time we were safe: a single man with a repeating rifle\r\ncould defend the entrance against all the Apaches in the land.  But\r\nagainst hunger and thirst we had no defense.  Courage we still had, but\r\nhope was a memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one of those Indians did we afterward see, but by the smoke and\r\nglare of their fires in the gulch we knew that by day and by night they\r\nwatched with ready rifles in the edge of the bush\xe2\x80\x94knew that if we made a\r\nsortie not a man of us would live to take three steps into the open.  For\r\nthree days, watching in turn, we held out before our suffering became\r\ninsupportable.  Then\xe2\x80\x94it was the morning of the fourth day\xe2\x80\x94Ramon Gallegos\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Senores, I know not well of the good God and what please him.  I have\r\nlive without religion, and I am not acquaint with that of you.  Pardon,\r\nsenores, if I shock you, but for me the time is come to beat the game of\r\nthe Apache.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knelt upon the rock floor of the cave and pressed his pistol against\r\nhis temple.  \xe2\x80\x98Madre de Dios,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98comes now the soul of Ramon\r\nGallegos.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so he left us\xe2\x80\x94William Shaw, George W. Kent and Berry Davis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was the leader: it was for me to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He was a brave man,\xe2\x80\x99 I said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98he knew when to die, and how.  It is\r\nfoolish to go mad from thirst and fall by Apache bullets, or be skinned\r\nalive\xe2\x80\x94it is in bad taste.  Let us join Ramon Gallegos.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That is right,\xe2\x80\x99 said William Shaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That is right,\xe2\x80\x99 said George W. Kent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI straightened the limbs of Ramon Gallegos and put a handkerchief over\r\nhis face.  Then William Shaw said: \xe2\x80\x98I should like to look like that\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle while.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd George W. Kent said that he felt that way, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It shall be so,\xe2\x80\x99 I said: \xe2\x80\x98the red devils will wait a week.  William\r\nShaw and George W. Kent, draw and kneel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey did so and I stood before them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Almighty God, our Father,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Almighty God, our Father,\xe2\x80\x99 said William Shaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Almighty God, our Father,\xe2\x80\x99 said George W. Kent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Forgive us our sins,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Forgive us our sins,\xe2\x80\x99 said they.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And receive our souls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And receive our souls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Amen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Amen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI laid them beside Ramon Gallegos and covered their faces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a quick commotion on the opposite side of the campfire: one of\r\nour party had sprung to his feet, pistol in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_you_ dared to escape?\xe2\x80\x94you dare to be alive?  You\r\ncowardly hound, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you to join them if I hang for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut with the leap of a panther the captain was upon him, grasping his\r\nwrist.  \xe2\x80\x9cHold it in, Sam Yountsey, hold it in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were now all upon our feet\xe2\x80\x94except the stranger, who sat motionless and\r\napparently inattentive.  Some one seized Yountsey\xe2\x80\x99s other arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something wrong here.  This fellow is either\r\na lunatic or merely a liar\xe2\x80\x94just a plain, every-day liar whom Yountsey has\r\nno call to kill.  If this man was of that party it had five members, one\r\nof whom\xe2\x80\x94probably himself\xe2\x80\x94he has not named.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, releasing the insurgent, who sat down, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x94unusual.  Years ago four dead bodies of white men, scalped and\r\nshamefully mutilated, were found about the mouth of that cave.  They are\r\nburied there; I have seen the graves\xe2\x80\x94we shall all see them to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger rose, standing tall in the light of the expiring fire, which\r\nin our breathless attention to his story we had neglected to keep going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were four,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cRamon Gallegos, William Shaw, George W. Kent\r\nand Berry Davis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this reiterated roll-call of the dead he walked into the darkness\r\nand we saw him no more.\r\n\r\nAt that moment one of our party, who had been on guard, strode in among\r\nus, rifle in hand and somewhat excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the last half-hour three men have been standing\r\nout there on the _mesa_.\xe2\x80\x9d  He pointed in the direction taken by the\r\nstranger.  \xe2\x80\x9cI could see them distinctly, for the moon is up, but as they\r\nhad no guns and I had them covered with mine I thought it was their move.\r\nThey have made none, but, damn it! they have got on to my nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back to your post, and stay till you see them again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncaptain.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe rest of you lie down again, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll kick you all into the\r\nfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sentinel obediently withdrew, swearing, and did not return.  As we\r\nwere arranging our blankets the fiery Yountsey said: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\r\nCaptain, but who the devil do you take them to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRamon Gallegos, William Shaw and George W. Kent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how about Berry Davis?  I ought to have shot him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite needless; you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made him any deader.  Go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n{252}  Rough notes of this tale were found among the papers of the late\r\nLeigh Bierce.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
