This\r\ncomposition, as it stands, makes, to my vision--and will have made\r\nperhaps still more to that of its readers--so considerable a mass\r\nbeside the germ sunk in it and still possibly distinguishable, that I\r\nam half-moved to leave my small secret undivulged. I shall encounter, I\r\nthink, in the course of this copious commentary, no better example, and\r\nnone on behalf of which I shall venture to invite more interest, of the\r\nquite incalculable tendency of a mere grain of subject-matter to expand\r\nand develop and cover the ground when conditions happen to favour it. I\r\nsay all, surely, when I speak of the thing as planned, in perfect good\r\nfaith, for brevity, for levity, for simplicity, for jocosity, in fine,\r\nand for an accommodating irony. I invoked, for my protection, the spirit\r\nof the lightest comedy, but \xe2\x80\x9cThe Awkward Age\xe2\x80\x9d was to belong, in the\r\nevent, to a group of productions, here re-introduced, which have in\r\ncommon, to their author\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, the endearing sign that they asserted\r\nin each case an unforeseen principle of growth. They were projected\r\nas small things, yet had finally to be provided for as comparative\r\nmonsters. That is my own title for them, though I should perhaps resent\r\nit if applied by another critic--above all in the case of the piece\r\nbefore us, the careful measure of which I have just freshly taken. The\r\nresult of this consideration has been in the first place to render sharp\r\nfor me again the interest of the whole process thus illustrated, and in\r\nthe second quite to place me on unexpectedly good terms with the work\r\nitself. As I scan my list I encounter none the \xe2\x80\x9chistory\xe2\x80\x9d of which\r\nembodies a greater number of curious truths--or of truths at least by\r\nwhich I find contemplation more enlivened. The thing done and dismissed\r\nhas ever, at the best, for the ambitious workman, a trick of looking\r\ndead, if not buried, so that he almost throbs with ecstasy when, on an\r\nanxious review, the flush of life reappears. It is verily on recognising\r\nthat flush on a whole side of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Awkward Age\xe2\x80\x9d that I brand it all,\r\nbut ever so tenderly, as monstrous--which is but my way of noting the\r\nQUANTITY of finish it stows away. Since I speak so undauntedly, when\r\nneed is, of the value of composition, I shall not beat about the bush to\r\nclaim for these pages the maximum of that advantage. If such a feat\r\nbe possible in this field as really taking a lesson from one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown adventure I feel I have now not failed of it--to so much more\r\ndemonstration of my profit than I can hope to carry through do I find\r\nmyself urged. Thus it is that, still with a remnant of self-respect,\r\nor at least of sanity, one may turn to complacency, one may linger with\r\npride. Let my pride provoke a frown till I justify it; which--though\r\nwith more matters to be noted here than I have room for I shall\r\naccordingly proceed to do.\r\n\r\nYet I must first make a brave face, no doubt, and present in its native\r\nhumility my scant but quite ponderable germ. The seed sprouted in that\r\nvast nursery of sharp appeals and concrete images which calls itself,\r\nfor blest convenience, London; it fell even into the order of the minor\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csocial phenomena\xe2\x80\x9d with which, as fruit for the observer, that mightiest\r\nof the trees of suggestion bristles. It was not, no doubt, a fine\r\npurple peach, but it might pass for a round ripe plum, the note one had\r\ninevitably had to take of the difference made in certain friendly houses\r\nand for certain flourishing mothers by the sometimes dreaded, often\r\ndelayed, but never fully arrested coming to the forefront of some vague\r\nslip of a daughter. For such mild revolutions as these not, to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination, to remain mild one had had, I dare say, to be infinitely\r\naddicted to \xe2\x80\x9cnoticing\xe2\x80\x9d; under the rule of that secret vice or that\r\nunfair advantage, at any rate, the \xe2\x80\x9csitting downstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d from a given\r\ndate, of the merciless maiden previously perched aloft could easily be\r\nfelt as a crisis. This crisis, and the sense for it in those whom it\r\nmost concerns, has to confess itself courageously the prime propulsive\r\nforce of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Awkward Age.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a matter might well make a scant show\r\nfor a \xe2\x80\x9cthick book,\xe2\x80\x9d and no thick book, but just a quite charmingly thin\r\none, was in fact originally dreamt of. For its proposed scale the\r\nlittle idea seemed happy--happy, that is, above all in having come very\r\nstraight; but its proposed scale was the limit of a small square canvas.\r\nOne had been present again and again at the exhibition I refer to--which\r\nis what I mean by the \xe2\x80\x9ccoming straight\xe2\x80\x9d of this particular London\r\nimpression; yet one was (and through fallibilities that after all had\r\ntheir sweetness, so that one would on the whole rather have kept them\r\nthan parted with them) still capable of so false a measurement. When I\r\nthink indeed of those of my many false measurements that have resulted,\r\nafter much anguish, in decent symmetries, I find the whole case, I\r\nprofess, a theme for the philosopher. The little ideas one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave treated save for the design of keeping them small, the developed\r\nsituations that one would never with malice prepense have undertaken,\r\nthe long stories that had thoroughly meant to be short, the short\r\nsubjects that had underhandedly plotted to be long, the hypocrisy of\r\nmodest beginnings, the audacity of misplaced middles, the triumph of\r\nintentions never entertained--with these patches, as I look about, I see\r\nmy experience paved: an experience to which nothing is wanting save, I\r\nconfess, some grasp of its final lesson.\r\n\r\nThis lesson would, if operative, surely provide some law for the\r\nrecognition, the determination in advance, of the just limits and the\r\njust extent of the situation, ANY situation, that appeals, and that yet,\r\nby the presumable, the helpful law of situations, must have its reserves\r\nas well as its promises. The storyteller considers it because it\r\npromises, and undertakes it, often, just because also making out, as\r\nhe believes, where the promise conveniently drops. The promise, for\r\ninstance, of the case I have just named, the case of the account to\r\nbe taken, in a circle of free talk, of a new and innocent, a wholly\r\nunacclimatised presence, as to which such accommodations have never had\r\nto come up, might well have appeared as limited as it was lively; and\r\nif these pages were not before us to register my illusion I should never\r\nhave made a braver claim for it. They themselves admonish me, however,\r\nin fifty interesting ways, and they especially emphasise that truth of\r\nthe vanity of the a priori test of what an idee-mere may have to give.\r\nThe truth is that what a happy thought has to give depends immensely\r\non the general turn of the mind capable of it, and on the fact that\r\nits loyal entertainer, cultivating fondly its possible relations and\r\nextensions, the bright efflorescence latent in it, but having to take\r\nother things in their order too, is terribly at the mercy of his mind.\r\nThat organ has only to exhale, in its degree, a fostering tropic air in\r\norder to produce complications almost beyond reckoning. The trap laid\r\nfor his superficial convenience resides in the fact that, though the\r\nrelations of a human figure or a social occurrence are what make such\r\nobjects interesting, they also make them, to the same tune, difficult to\r\nisolate, to surround with the sharp black line, to frame in the square,\r\nthe circle, the charming oval, that helps any arrangement of objects\r\nto become a picture. The storyteller has but to have been condemned by\r\nnature to a liberally amused and beguiled, a richly sophisticated, view\r\nof relations and a fine inquisitive speculative sense for them, to find\r\nhimself at moments flounder in a deep warm jungle. These are the moments\r\nat which he recalls ruefully that the great merit of such and such a\r\nsmall case, the merit for his particular advised use, had been precisely\r\nin the smallness.\r\n\r\nI may say at once that this had seemed to me, under the first flush of\r\nrecognition, the good mark for the pretty notion of the \xe2\x80\x9cfree circle\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n put about by having, of a sudden, an ingenuous mind and a pair of limpid\r\nsearching eyes to count with. Half the attraction was in the current\r\nactuality of the thing: repeatedly, right and left, as I have said, one\r\nhad seen such a drama constituted, and always to the effect of proposing\r\nto the interested view one of those questions that are of the essence\r\nof drama: what will happen, who suffer, who not suffer, what turn be\r\ndetermined, what crisis created, what issue found? There had of course\r\nto be, as a basis, the free circle, but this was material of that\r\nadmirable order with which the good London never leaves its true lover\r\nand believer long unprovided. One could count them on one\xe2\x80\x99s fingers\r\n(an abundant allowance), the liberal firesides beyond the wide glow of\r\nwhich, in a comparative dimness, female adolescence hovered and waited.\r\nThe wide glow was bright, was favourable to \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d talk, to play of\r\nmind, to an explicit interest in life, a due demonstration of the\r\ninterest by persons I qualified to feel it: all of which meant frankness\r\nand ease, the perfection, almost, as it were, of intercourse, and a\r\ntone as far as possible removed from that of the nursery and the\r\nschoolroom--as far as possible removed even, no doubt, in its appealing\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmodernity,\xe2\x80\x9d from that of supposedly privileged scenes of conversation\r\ntwenty years ago. The charm was, with a hundred other things, in\r\nthe freedom--the freedom menaced by the inevitable irruption of the\r\ningenuous mind; whereby, if the freedom should be sacrificed, what would\r\ntruly BECOME of the charm? The charm might be figured as dear to members\r\nof the circle consciously contributing to it, but it was none the less\r\ntrue that some sacrifice in some quarter would have to be made, and what\r\nmeditator worth his salt could fail to hold his breath while waiting\r\non the event? The ingenuous mind might, it was true, be suppressed\r\naltogether, the general disconcertment averted either by some\r\nmaster-stroke of diplomacy or some rude simplification; yet these\r\nwere ugly matters, and in the examples before one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes nothing ugly,\r\nnothing harsh or crude, had flourished. A girl might be married off the\r\nday after her irruption, or better still the day before it, to remove\r\nher from the sphere of the play of mind; but these were exactly not\r\ncrudities, and even then, at the worst, an interval had to be bridged.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Awkward Age\xe2\x80\x9d is precisely a study of one of these curtailed or\r\nextended periods of tension and apprehension, an account of the manner\r\nin which the resented interference with ancient liberties came to be in\r\na particular instance dealt with.\r\n\r\nI note once again that I had not escaped seeing it actually and\r\ntraceably dealt with--(I admit) a good deal of friendly suspense; also\r\nwith the nature and degree of the \xe2\x80\x9csacrifice\xe2\x80\x9d left very much to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappreciation. In circles highly civilised the great things, the real\r\nthings, the hard, the cruel and even the tender things, the true\r\nelements of any tension and true facts of any crisis, have ever, for the\r\noutsider\xe2\x80\x99s, for the critic\xe2\x80\x99s use, to be translated into terms--terms\r\nin the distinguished name of which, terms for the right employment of\r\nwhich, more than one situation of the type I glance at had struck me as\r\nall irresistibly appealing. There appeared in fact at moments no end to\r\nthe things they said, the suggestions into which they flowered; one\r\nof these latter in especial arriving at the highest intensity. Putting\r\nvividly before one the perfect system on which the awkward age is\r\nhandled in most other European societies, it threw again into relief\r\nthe inveterate English trick of the so morally well-meant and so\r\nintellectually helpless compromise. We live notoriously, as I suppose\r\nevery age lives, in an \xe2\x80\x9cepoch of transition\xe2\x80\x9d; but it may still be\r\nsaid of the French for instance, I assume, that their social scheme\r\nabsolutely provides against awkwardness. That is it would be, by this\r\nscheme, so infinitely awkward, so awkward beyond any patching-up, for\r\nthe hovering female young to be conceived as present at \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d talk,\r\nthat their presence is, theoretically at least, not permitted till their\r\nyouth has been promptly corrected by marriage--in which case they have\r\nceased to be merely young. The better the talk prevailing in any circle,\r\naccordingly, the more organised, the more complete, the element of\r\nprecaution and exclusion. Talk--giving the term a wide application--is\r\none thing, and a proper inexperience another; and it has never occurred\r\nto a logical people that the interest of the greater, the general,\r\nneed be sacrificed to that of the less, the particular. Such sacrifices\r\nstrike them as gratuitous and barbarous, as cruel above all to the\r\nsocial intelligence; also as perfectly preventable by wise arrangement.\r\nNothing comes home more, on the other hand, to the observer of English\r\nmanners than the very moderate degree in which wise arrangement, in\r\nthe French sense of a scientific economy, has ever been invoked; a fact\r\nindeed largely explaining the great interest of their incoherence, their\r\nheterogeneity, their wild abundance. The French, all analytically, have\r\nconceived of fifty different proprieties, meeting fifty different cases,\r\nwhereas the English mind, less intensely at work, has never conceived\r\nbut of one--the grand propriety, for every case, it should in fairness\r\nbe said, of just being English. As practice, however, has always to be\r\na looser thing than theory, so no application of that rigour has been\r\npossible in the London world without a thousand departures from the grim\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nThe American theory, if I may \xe2\x80\x9cdrag it in,\xe2\x80\x9d would be, I think, that talk\r\nshould never become \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d than the female young, either actually or\r\nconstructively present, are minded to allow it. THAT system involves as\r\nlittle compromise as the French; it has been absolutely simple, and the\r\nbeauty of its success shines out in every record of our conditions of\r\nintercourse--premising always our \xe2\x80\x9cbasic\xe2\x80\x9d assumption that the female\r\nyoung read the newspapers. The English theory may be in itself almost\r\nas simple, but different and much more complex forces have ruled the\r\napplication of it; so much does the goodness of talk depend on what\r\nthere may be to talk about. There are more things in London, I think,\r\nthan anywhere in the world; hence the charm of the dramatic struggle\r\nreflected in my book, the struggle somehow to fit propriety into\r\na smooth general case which is really all the while bristling and\r\ncrumbling into fierce particular ones. The circle surrounding Mrs.\r\nBrookenham, in my pages, is of course nothing if not a particular,\r\neven a \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiar\xe2\x80\x9d one--and its rather vain effort (the vanity, the real\r\ninexpertness, being precisely part of my tale) is toward the courage\r\nof that condition. It has cropped up in a social order where individual\r\nappreciations of propriety have not been formally allowed for, in spite\r\nof their having very often quite rudely and violently and insolently,\r\nrather of course than insidiously, flourished; so that as the matter\r\nstands, rightly or wrongly, Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s retarded, but eventually none the\r\nless real, incorporation means virtually Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s exposure. It means\r\nthis, that is, and many things beside--means them for Nanda herself and,\r\nwith a various intensity, for the other participants in the action;\r\nbut what it particularly means, surely, is the failure of successful\r\narrangement and the very moral, sharply pointed, of the fruits of\r\ncompromise. It is compromise that has suffered her to be in question\r\nat all, and that has condemned the freedom of the circle to be\r\nself-conscious, compunctious, on the whole much more timid than\r\nbrave--the consequent muddle, if the term be not too gross, representing\r\nmeanwhile a great inconvenience for life, but, as I found myself\r\nfeeling, an immense promise, a much greater one than on the \xe2\x80\x9cforeign\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n showing, for the painted picture of life. Beyond which let me add that\r\nhere immediately is a prime specimen of the way in which the obscurer,\r\nthe lurking relations of a motive apparently simple, always in wait for\r\ntheir spring, may by seizing their chance for it send simplicity flying.\r\nPoor Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s little case, and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s, and Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s and Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s, to say nothing of that of the others, has\r\nonly to catch a reflected light from over the Channel in order to double\r\nat once its appeal to the imagination. (I am considering all these\r\nmatters, I need scarce say, only as they are concerned with that\r\nfaculty. With a relation NOT imaginative to his material the storyteller\r\nhas nothing whatever to do.)\r\n\r\nIt exactly happened moreover that my own material here was to profit in\r\na particular way by that extension of view. My idea was to be treated\r\nwith light irony--it would be light and ironical or it would be nothing;\r\nso that I asked myself, naturally, what might be the least solemn form\r\nto give it, among recognised and familiar forms. The question thus at\r\nonce arose: What form so familiar, so recognised among alert readers, as\r\nthat in which the ingenious and inexhaustible, the charming philosophic\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGyp\xe2\x80\x9d casts most of her social studies? Gyp had long struck me as\r\nmistress, in her levity, of one of the happiest of forms--the only\r\nobjection to my use of which was a certain extraordinary benightedness\r\non the part of the Anglo-Saxon reader. One had noted this reader\r\nas perverse and inconsequent in respect to the absorption of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdialogue\xe2\x80\x9d--observed the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic for fiction\xe2\x80\x9d consume it, in certain\r\nconnexions, on the scale and with the smack of lips that mark the\r\nconsumption of bread-and-jam by a children\xe2\x80\x99s school-feast, consume it\r\neven at the theatre, so far as our theatre ever vouchsafes it, and yet\r\nas flagrantly reject it when served, so to speak, au naturel. One had\r\nseen good solid slices of fiction, well endued, one might surely have\r\nthought, with this easiest of lubrications, deplored by editor and\r\npublisher as positively not, for the general gullet as known to THEM,\r\nmade adequately \xe2\x80\x9cslick.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Dialogue,\xe2\x80\x99 always \xe2\x80\x98dialogue\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d I had seemed\r\nfrom far back to hear them mostly cry: \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t have too much of it, we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t have enough of it, and no excess of it, in the form of no matter\r\nwhat savourless dilution, or what boneless dispersion, ever began to\r\ninjure a book so much as even the very scantest claim put in for form\r\nand substance.\xe2\x80\x9d This wisdom had always been in one\xe2\x80\x99s ears; but it had\r\nat the same time been equally in one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes that really constructive\r\ndialogue, dialogue organic and dramatic, speaking for itself,\r\nrepresenting and embodying substance and form, is among us an uncanny\r\nand abhorrent thing, not to be dealt with on any terms. A comedy or a\r\ntragedy may run for a thousand nights without prompting twenty persons\r\nin London or in New York to desire that view of its text which is so\r\ndesired in Paris, as soon as a play begins to loom at all large, that\r\nthe number of copies of the printed piece in circulation far exceeds at\r\nlast the number of performances. But as with the printed piece our\r\nown public, infatuated as it may be with the theatre, refuses all\r\ncommerce--though indeed this can\xe2\x80\x99t but be, without cynicism, very much\r\nthrough the infirmity the piece, IF printed, would reveal--so the\r\nsame horror seems to attach to any typographic hint of the proscribed\r\nplaybook or any insidious plea for it. The immense oddity resides in\r\nthe almost exclusively typographic order of the offence. An English, an\r\nAmerican Gyp would typographically offend, and that would be the end\r\nof her. THERE gloomed at me my warning, as well as shone at me my\r\nprovocation, in respect to the example of this delightful writer. I\r\nmight emulate her, since I presumptuously would, but dishonour would\r\nawait me if, proposing to treat the different faces of my subject in the\r\nmost completely instituted colloquial form, I should evoke the figure\r\nand affirm the presence of participants by the repeated and prefixed\r\nname rather than by the recurrent and affixed \xe2\x80\x9csaid he\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csaid she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n All I have space to go into here--much as the funny fact I refer to\r\nmight seem to invite us to dance hand in hand round it--is that I was at\r\nany rate duly admonished, that I took my measures accordingly, and\r\nthat the manner in which I took them has lived again for me ever so\r\narrestingly, so amusingly, on re-examination of the book.\r\n\r\nBut that I did, positively and seriously--ah so seriously!--emulate\r\nthe levity of Gyp and, by the same token, of that hardiest of flowers\r\nfostered in her school, M. Henri Lavedan, is a contribution to the\r\nhistory of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Awkward Age\xe2\x80\x9d that I shall obviously have had to brace\r\nmyself in order to make. Vivid enough to me the expression of face of\r\nany kindest of critics, even, moved to declare that he would never in\r\nthe least have suspected it. Let me say at once, in extenuation of the\r\ntoo respectful distance at which I may thus have appeared to follow my\r\nmodel, that my first care HAD to be the covering of my tracks--lest I\r\ntruly should be caught in the act of arranging, of organising dialogue\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cspeak for itself.\xe2\x80\x9d What I now see to have happened is that I\r\norganised and arranged but too well--too well, I mean, for any betrayal\r\nof the Gyp taint, however faded and feeble. The trouble appears to have\r\nbeen that while I on the one hand exorcised the baleful association, I\r\nsucceeded in rousing on nobody\xe2\x80\x99s part a sense of any other association\r\nwhatever, or of my having cast myself into any conceivable or calculable\r\nform. My private inspiration had been in the Gyp plan (artfully\r\ndissimulated, for dear life, and applied with the very subtlest\r\nconsistency, but none the less kept in secret view); yet I was to\r\nfail to make out in the event that the book succeeded in producing the\r\nimpression of ANY plan on any person. No hint of that sort of success,\r\nor of any critical perception at all in relation to the business, has\r\never come my way; in spite of which when I speak, as just above, of\r\nwhat was to \xe2\x80\x9chappen\xe2\x80\x9d under the law of my ingenious labour, I fairly\r\nlose myself in the vision of a hundred bright phenomena. Some of these\r\nincidents I must treat myself to naming, for they are among the best I\r\nshall have on any occasion to retail. But I must first give the measure\r\nof the degree in which they were mere matters of the study. This\r\ncomposition had originally appeared in \xe2\x80\x9cHarper\xe2\x80\x99s Weekly\xe2\x80\x9d during the\r\nautumn of 1898 and the first weeks of the winter, and the volume\r\ncontaining it was published that spring. I had meanwhile been absent\r\nfrom England, and it was not till my return, some time later, that I had\r\nfrom my publisher any news of our venture. But the news then met at a\r\nstroke all my curiosity: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say the book has done nothing\r\nto speak of; I\xe2\x80\x99ve never in all my experience seen one treated with more\r\ngeneral and complete disrespect.\xe2\x80\x9d There was thus to be nothing left me\r\nfor fond subsequent reference--of which I doubtless give even now so\r\nadequate an illustration--save the rich reward of the singular interest\r\nattaching to the very intimacies of the effort.\r\n\r\nIt comes back to me, the whole \xe2\x80\x9cjob,\xe2\x80\x9d as wonderfully amusing and\r\ndelightfully difficult from the first; since amusement deeply abides,\r\nI think, in any artistic attempt the basis and groundwork of which are\r\nconscious of a particular firmness. On that hard fine floor the element\r\nof execution feels it may more or less confidently DANCE; in which case\r\npuzzling questions, sharp obstacles, dangers of detail, may come up for\r\nit by the dozen without breaking its heart or shaking its nerve. It is\r\nthe difficulty produced by the loose foundation or the vague scheme that\r\nbreaks the heart--when a luckless fatuity has over-persuaded an author\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9csaving\xe2\x80\x9d virtue of treatment. Being \xe2\x80\x9ctreated\xe2\x80\x9d is never, in a\r\nworkable idea, a mere passive condition, and I hold no subject ever\r\nsusceptible of help that isn\xe2\x80\x99t, like the embarrassed man of our\r\nproverbial wisdom, first of all able to help itself. I was thus to have\r\nhere an envious glimpse, in carrying my design through, of that artistic\r\nrage and that artistic felicity which I have ever supposed to be\r\nintensest and highest, the confidence of the dramatist strong in the\r\nsense of his postulate. The dramatist has verily to BUILD, is committed\r\nto architecture, to construction at any cost; to driving in deep his\r\nvertical supports and laying across and firmly fixing his horizontal,\r\nhis resting pieces--at the risk of no matter what vibration from the tap\r\nof his master-hammer. This makes the active value of his basis immense,\r\nenabling him, with his flanks protected, to advance undistractedly, even\r\nif not at all carelessly, into the comparative fairy-land of the mere\r\nminor anxiety. In other words his scheme HOLDS, and as he feels this in\r\nspite of noted strains and under repeated tests, so he keeps his face\r\nto the day. I rejoiced, by that same token, to feel MY scheme hold, and\r\neven a little ruefully watched it give me much more than I had ventured\r\nto hope. For I promptly found my conceived arrangement of my material\r\nopen the door wide to ingenuity. I remember that in sketching my project\r\nfor the conductors of the periodical I have named I drew on a sheet of\r\npaper--and possibly with an effect of the cabalistic, it now comes over\r\nme, that even anxious amplification may have but vainly attenuated--the\r\nneat figure of a circle consisting of a number of small rounds disposed\r\nat equal distance about a central object. The central object was my\r\nsituation, my subject in itself, to which the thing would owe its title,\r\nand the small rounds represented so many distinct lamps, as I liked to\r\ncall them, the function of each of which would be to light with all due\r\nintensity one of its aspects. I had divided it, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they see? into\r\naspects--uncanny as the little term might sound (though not for a moment\r\ndid I suggest we should use it for the public), and by that sign we\r\nwould conquer.\r\n\r\nThey \xe2\x80\x9csaw,\xe2\x80\x9d all genially and generously--for I must add that I had made,\r\nto the best of my recollection, no morbid scruple of not blabbing about\r\nGyp and her strange incitement. I the more boldly held my tongue over\r\nthis that the more I, by my intelligence, lived in my arrangement and\r\nmoved about in it, the more I sank into satisfaction. It was clearly to\r\nwork to a charm and, during this process--by calling at every step for\r\nan exquisite management--\xe2\x80\x9cto haunt, to startle and waylay.\xe2\x80\x9d Each of my\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clamps\xe2\x80\x9d would be the light of a single \xe2\x80\x9csocial occasion\xe2\x80\x9d in the history\r\nand intercourse of the characters concerned, and would bring out to\r\nthe full the latent colour of the scene in question and cause it to\r\nillustrate, to the last drop, its bearing on my theme. I revelled in\r\nthis notion of the Occasion as a thing by itself, really and completely\r\na scenic thing, and could scarce name it, while crouching amid the thick\r\narcana of my plan, with a large enough O. The beauty of the conception\r\nwas in this approximation of the respective divisions of my form to the\r\nsuccessive Acts of a Play--as to which it was more than ever a case for\r\ncharmed capitals. The divine distinction of the act of a play--and\r\na greater than any other it easily succeeds in arriving at--was, I\r\nreasoned, in its special, its guarded objectivity. This objectivity, in\r\nturn, when achieving its ideal, came from the imposed absence of that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgoing behind,\xe2\x80\x9d to compass explanations and amplifications, to drag out\r\nodds and ends from the \xe2\x80\x9cmere\xe2\x80\x9d storyteller\xe2\x80\x99s great property-shop of aids\r\nto illusion: a resource under denial of which it was equally perplexing\r\nand delightful, for a change, to proceed. Everything, for that matter,\r\nbecomes interesting from the moment it has closely to consider, for full\r\neffect positively to bestride, the law of its kind. \xe2\x80\x9cKinds\xe2\x80\x9d are the\r\nvery life of literature, and truth and strength come from the complete\r\nrecognition of them, from abounding to the utmost in their respective\r\nsenses and sinking deep into their consistency. I myself have scarcely\r\nto plead the cause of \xe2\x80\x9cgoing behind,\xe2\x80\x9d which is right and beautiful and\r\nfruitful in its place and order; but as the confusion of kinds is the\r\ninelegance of letters and the stultification of values, so to renounce\r\nthat line utterly and do something quite different instead may become in\r\nanother connexion the true course and the vehicle of effect. Something\r\nin the very nature, in the fine rigour, of this special sacrifice (which\r\nis capable of affecting the form-lover, I think, as really more of a\r\nprojected form than any other) lends it moreover a coercive charm; a\r\ncharm that grows in proportion as the appeal to it tests and stretches\r\nand strains it, puts it powerfully to the touch. To make the presented\r\noccasion tell all its story itself, remain shut up in its own presence\r\nand yet on that patch of staked-out ground become thoroughly interesting\r\nand remain thoroughly clear, is a process not remarkable, no doubt,\r\nso long as a very light weight is laid on it, but difficult enough to\r\nchallenge and inspire great adroitness so soon as the elements to be\r\ndealt with begin at all to \xe2\x80\x9csize up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe disdainers of the contemporary drama deny, obviously, with all\r\npromptness, that the matter to be expressed by its means--richly and\r\nsuccessfully expressed that is--CAN loom with any largeness; since from\r\nthe moment it does one of the conditions breaks down. The process simply\r\ncollapses under pressure, they contend, proves its weakness as quickly\r\nas the office laid on it ceases to be simple. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d they say to\r\nthe dramatist, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have to be, supremely, three things: you have\r\nto be true to your form, you have to be interesting, you have to be\r\nclear. You have in other words to prove yourself adequate to taking a\r\nheavy weight. But we defy you really to conform to your conditions with\r\nany but a light one. Make the thing you have to convey, make the picture\r\nyou have to paint, at all rich and complex, and you cease to be\r\nclear. Remain clear--and with the clearness required by the infantine\r\nintelligence of any public consenting to see a play--and what becomes\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x98importance\xe2\x80\x99 of your subject? If it\xe2\x80\x99s important by any other\r\ncritical measure than the little foot-rule the \xe2\x80\x98produced\xe2\x80\x99 piece has to\r\nconform to, it is predestined to be a muddle. When it has escaped being\r\na muddle the note it has succeeded in striking at the furthest will be\r\nrecognised as one of those that are called high but by the courtesy, by\r\nthe intellectual provinciality, of theatrical criticism, which, as we\r\ncan see for ourselves any morning, is--well, an abyss even deeper than\r\nthe theatre itself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to crush us with Dumas and Ibsen, for\r\nsuch values are from any informed and enlightened point of view, that is\r\nmeasured by other high values, literary, critical, philosophic, of the\r\nmost moderate order. Ibsen and Dumas are precisely cases of men, men in\r\ntheir degree, in their poor theatrical straight-jacket, speculative,\r\nwho have HAD to renounce the finer thing for the coarser, the thick, in\r\nshort, for the thin and the curious for the self-evident. What earthly\r\nintellectual distinction, what \xe2\x80\x98prestige\xe2\x80\x99 of achievement, would have\r\nattached to the substance of such things as \xe2\x80\x98Denise,\xe2\x80\x99 as \xe2\x80\x98Monsieur\r\nAlphonse,\xe2\x80\x99 as \xe2\x80\x98Francillon\xe2\x80\x99 (and we take the Dumas of the supposedly\r\nsubtler period) in any other form? What virtues of the same order would\r\nhave attached to \xe2\x80\x98The Pillars of Society,\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98An Enemy of the People,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto \xe2\x80\x98Ghosts,\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98Rosmersholm\xe2\x80\x99 (or taking also Ibsen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98subtler period\xe2\x80\x99)\r\nto \xe2\x80\x98John Gabriel Borkmann,\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98The Master-Builder\xe2\x80\x99? Ibsen is in fact\r\nwonderfully a case in point, since from the moment he\xe2\x80\x99s clear, from the\r\nmoment he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98amusing,\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s on the footing of a thesis as simple and\r\nsuperficial as that of \xe2\x80\x98A Doll\xe2\x80\x99s House\xe2\x80\x99--while from the moment he\xe2\x80\x99s by\r\napparent intention comprehensive and searching it\xe2\x80\x99s on the footing of an\r\neffect as confused and obscure as \xe2\x80\x98The Wild Duck.\xe2\x80\x99 From which you easily\r\nsee ALL the conditions can\xe2\x80\x99t be met. The dramatist has to choose but\r\nthose he\xe2\x80\x99s most capable of, and by that choice he\xe2\x80\x99s known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the objector concludes, and never surely without great profit\r\nfrom his having been \xe2\x80\x9cdrawn.\xe2\x80\x9d His apparent triumph--if it be even\r\napparent--still leaves, it will be noted, convenient cover for retort\r\nin the riddled face of the opposite stronghold. The last word in these\r\ncases is for nobody who can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to an ABSOLUTE test. The terms\r\nhere used, obviously, are matters of appreciation, and there is no short\r\ncut to proof (luckily for us all round) either that \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Alphonse\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n develops itself on the highest plane of irony or that \xe2\x80\x9cGhosts\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n simplifies almost to excruciation. If \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Gabriel Borkmann\xe2\x80\x9d is but a\r\npennyworth of effect as to a character we can imagine much more amply\r\npresented, and if \xe2\x80\x9cHedda Gabler\xe2\x80\x9d makes an appeal enfeebled by remarkable\r\nvagueness, there is by the nature of the case no catching the convinced,\r\nor call him the deluded, spectator or reader in the act of a mistake.\r\nHe is to be caught at the worst in the act of attention, of the very\r\ngreatest attention, and that is all, as a precious preliminary at least,\r\nthat the playwright asks of him, besides being all the very divinest\r\npoet can get. I remember rejoicing as much to remark this, after getting\r\nlaunched in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Awkward Age,\xe2\x80\x9d as if I were in fact constructing a\r\nplay--just as I may doubtless appear now not less anxious to keep the\r\nphilosophy of the dramatist\xe2\x80\x99s course before me than if I belonged to his\r\norder. I felt, certainly, the support he feels, I participated in his\r\ntechnical amusement, I tasted to the full the bitter-sweetness of his\r\ndraught--the beauty and the difficulty (to harp again on that string) of\r\nescaping poverty EVEN THOUGH the references in one\xe2\x80\x99s action can only be,\r\nwith intensity, to each other, to things exactly on the same plane of\r\nexhibition with themselves. Exhibition may mean in a \xe2\x80\x9cstory\xe2\x80\x9d twenty\r\ndifferent ways, fifty excursions, alternatives, excrescences, and the\r\nnovel, as largely practised in English, is the perfect paradise of the\r\nloose end. The play consents to the logic of but one way, mathematically\r\nright, and with the loose end as gross an impertinence on its surface,\r\nand as grave a dishonour, as the dangle of a snippet of silk or wool on\r\nthe right side of a tapestry. We are shut up wholly to cross-relations,\r\nrelations all within the action itself; no part of which is related\r\nto anything but some other part--save of course by the relation of the\r\ntotal to life. And, after invoking the protection of Gyp, I saw the\r\npoint of my game all in the problem of keeping these conditioned\r\nrelations crystalline at the same time that I should, in emulation of\r\nlife, consent to their being numerous and fine and characteristic of\r\nthe London world (as the London world was in this quarter and that to be\r\ndeciphered). All of which was to make in the event for complications.\r\n\r\nI see now of course how far, with my complications, I got away from Gyp;\r\nbut I see to-day so much else too that this particular deflexion from\r\nsimplicity makes scarce a figure among the others after having once\r\nserved its purpose, I mean, of lighting my original imitative innocence.\r\nFor I recognise in especial, with a waking vibration of that interest\r\nin which, as I say, the plan of the book is embalmed for me, that\r\nmy subject was probably condemned in advance to appreciable, or more\r\nexactly perhaps to almost preposterously appreciative, over-treatment.\r\nIt places itself for me thus in a group of small productions exhibiting\r\nthis perversity, representations of conceived cases in which my process\r\nhas been to pump the case gaspingly dry, dry not only of superfluous\r\nmoisture, but absolutely (for I have encountered the charge) of\r\nbreathable air. I may note, in fine, that coming back to the pages\r\nbefore us with a strong impression of their recording, to my shame,\r\nthat disaster, even to the extent of its disqualifying them for decent\r\nreappearance, I have found the adventure taking, to my relief,\r\nquite another turn, and have lost myself in the wonder of what\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cover-treatment\xe2\x80\x9d may, in the detail of its desperate ingenuity, consist\r\nof. The revived interest I speak of has been therefore that of following\r\ncritically, from page to page, even as the red Indian tracks in the\r\nforest the pale-face, the footsteps of the systematic loyalty I was able\r\nto achieve. The amusement of this constatation is, as I have hinted, in\r\nthe detail of the matter, and the detail is so dense, the texture of the\r\nfigured and smoothed tapestry so loose, that the genius of Gyp herself,\r\nmuse of general looseness, would certainly, once warned, have uttered\r\nthe first disavowal of my homage. But what has occurred meanwhile is\r\nthat this high consistency has itself, so to speak, constituted an\r\nexhibition, and that an important artistic truth has seemed to me\r\nthereby lighted. We brushed against that truth just now in our glance\r\nat the denial of expansibility to any idea the mould of the \xe2\x80\x9cstage-play\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n may hope to express without cracking and bursting--and we bear in mind\r\nat the same time that the picture of Nanda Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s situation,\r\nthough perhaps seeming to a careless eye so to wander and sprawl, yet\r\npresents itself on absolutely scenic lines, and that each of these\r\nscenes in itself, and each as related to each and to all of its\r\ncompanions, abides without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s deflexion by the principle of the\r\nstage-play. In doing this then it does more--it helps us ever so happily\r\nto see the grave distinction between substance and form in a really\r\nwrought work of art signally break down. I hold it impossible to say,\r\nbefore \xe2\x80\x9cThe Awkward Age,\xe2\x80\x9d where one of these elements ends and the other\r\nbegins: I have been unable at least myself, on re-examination, to mark\r\nany such joint or seam, to see the two DISCHARGED offices as separate.\r\nThey are separate before the fact, but the sacrament of execution\r\nindissolubly marries them, and the marriage, like any other marriage,\r\nhas only to be a \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d one for the scandal of a breach not to show.\r\nThe thing \xe2\x80\x9cdone,\xe2\x80\x9d artistically, is a fusion, or it has not BEEN done--in\r\nwhich case of course the artist may be, and all deservedly, pelted with\r\nany fragment of his botch the critic shall choose to pick up. But his\r\nground once conquered, in this particular field, he knows nothing of\r\nfragments and may say in all security: \xe2\x80\x9cDetach one if you can. You can\r\nanalyse in YOUR way, oh yes--to relate, to report, to explain; but you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t disintegrate my synthesis; you can\xe2\x80\x99t resolve the elements of my\r\nwhole into different responsible agents or find your way at all (for\r\nyour own fell purpose). My mixture has only to be perfect literally\r\nto bewilder you--you are lost in the tangle of the forest. Prove this\r\nvalue, this effect, in the air of the whole result, to be of my subject,\r\nand that other value, other effect, to be of my treatment, prove that\r\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t so shaken them together as the conjurer I profess to be MUST\r\nconsummately shake, and I consent but to parade as before a booth at the\r\nfair.\xe2\x80\x9d The exemplary closeness of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Awkward Age\xe2\x80\x9d even affects me, on\r\nre-perusal, I confess, as treasure quite instinctively and foreseeingly\r\nlaid up against my present opportunity for these remarks. I have\r\nbeen positively struck by the quantity of meaning and the number of\r\nintentions, the extent of GROUND FOR INTEREST, as I may call it, that\r\nI have succeeded in working scenically, yet without loss of\r\nsharpness, clearness or \xe2\x80\x9catmosphere,\xe2\x80\x9d into each of my illuminating\r\noccasions--where, at certain junctures, the due preservation of all\r\nthese values took, in the familiar phrase, a good deal of doing.\r\n\r\nI should have liked just here to re-examine with the reader some of the\r\npositively most artful passages I have in mind--such as the hour of Mr.\r\nLongdon\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful and, as it were, mystic attempt at a compact with\r\nVanderbank, late at night, in the billiard-room of the country-house at\r\nwhich they are staying; such as the other nocturnal passage, under Mr.\r\nLongdon\xe2\x80\x99s roof, between Vanderbank and Mitchy, where the conduct of so\r\nmuch fine meaning, so many flares of the exhibitory torch through the\r\nlabyrinth of mere immediate appearances, mere familiar allusions, is\r\nsuccessfully and safely effected; such as the whole array of the terms\r\nof presentation that are made to serve, all systematically, yet without\r\na gap anywhere, for the presentation, throughout, of a Mitchy \xe2\x80\x9csubtle\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n no less than concrete and concrete no less than deprived of that\r\nofficious explanation which we know as \xe2\x80\x9cgoing behind\xe2\x80\x9d; such as, briefly,\r\nthe general service of co-ordination and vivification rendered, on lines\r\nof ferocious, of really quite heroic compression, by the picture of the\r\nassembled group at Mrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s, where the \xe2\x80\x9ccross-references\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\naction are as thick as the green leaves of a garden, but none the less,\r\nas they have scenically to be, counted and disposed, weighted with\r\nresponsibility. Were I minded to use in this connexion a \xe2\x80\x9cloud\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n word--and the critic in general hates loud words as a man of taste may\r\nhate loud colours--I should speak of the composition of the chapters\r\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cTishy Grendon,\xe2\x80\x9d with all the pieces of the game on the\r\ntable together and each unconfusedly and contributively placed, as\r\ntriumphantly scientific. I must properly remind myself, rather, that\r\nthe better lesson of my retrospect would seem to be really a supreme\r\nrevision of the question of what it may be for a subject to suffer,\r\nto call it suffering, by over-treatment. Bowed down so long by the\r\ninference that its product had in this case proved such a betrayal, my\r\nartistic conscience meets the relief of having to recognise truly here\r\nno traces of suffering. The thing carries itself to my maturer and\r\ngratified sense as with every symptom of soundness, an insolence of\r\nhealth and joy. And from this precisely I deduce my moral; which is to\r\nthe effect that, since our only way, in general, of knowing that we have\r\nhad too much of anything is by FEELING that too much: so, by the same\r\ntoken, when we don\xe2\x80\x99t feel the excess (and I am contending, mind, that in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Awkward Age\xe2\x80\x9d the multiplicity yields to the order) how do we know\r\nthat the measure not recorded, the notch not reached, does represent\r\nadequacy or satiety? The mere feeling helps us for certain degrees of\r\ncongestion, but for exact science, that is for the criticism of \xe2\x80\x9cfine\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n art, we want the notation. The notation, however, is what we lack, and\r\nthe verdict of the mere feeling is liable to fluctuate. In other words\r\nan imputed defect is never, at the worst, disengageable, or other than\r\nmatter for appreciation--to come back to my claim for that felicity of\r\nthe dramatist\xe2\x80\x99s case that his synthetic \xe2\x80\x9cwhole\xe2\x80\x9d IS his form, the only\r\none we have to do with. I like to profit in his company by the fact that\r\nif our art has certainly, for the impression it produces, to defer to\r\nthe rise and fall, in the critical temperature, of the telltale mercury,\r\nit still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t to reckon with the engraved thermometer-face.\r\n\r\nHENRY JAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AWKWARD AGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIRST. LADY JULIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSave when it happened to rain Vanderbank always walked home, but\r\nhe usually took a hansom when the rain was moderate and adopted the\r\npreference of the philosopher when it was heavy. On this occasion he\r\ntherefore recognised as the servant opened the door a congruity between\r\nthe weather and the \xe2\x80\x9cfour-wheeler\xe2\x80\x9d that, in the empty street, under the\r\nglazed radiance, waited and trickled and blackly glittered. The butler\r\nmentioned it as on such a wild night the only thing they could get,\r\nand Vanderbank, having replied that it was exactly what would do best,\r\nprepared in the doorway to put up his umbrella and dash down to it.\r\nAt this moment he heard his name pronounced from behind and on turning\r\nfound himself joined by the elderly fellow guest with whom he had\r\ntalked after dinner and about whom later on upstairs he had sounded his\r\nhostess. It was at present a clear question of how this amiable, this\r\napparently unassertive person should get home--of the possibility of the\r\nother cab for which even now one of the footmen, with a whistle to his\r\nlips, craned out his head and listened through the storm. Mr. Longdon\r\nwondered to Vanderbank if their course might by any chance be the same;\r\nwhich led our young friend immediately to express a readiness to see him\r\nsafely in any direction that should accommodate him. As the footman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhistle spent itself in vain they got together into the four-wheeler,\r\nwhere at the end of a few moments more Vanderbank became conscious of\r\nhaving proposed his own rooms as a wind-up to their drive. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nbe a better finish of the evening than just separating in the wet? He\r\nliked his new acquaintance, who struck him as in a manner clinging to\r\nhim, who was staying at an hotel presumably at that hour dismal, and\r\nwho, confessing with easy humility to a connexion positively timid with\r\na club at which one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a visitor, accepted his invitation\r\nunder pressure. Vanderbank, when they arrived, was amused at the air\r\nof added extravagance with which he said he would keep the cab: he so\r\nclearly enjoyed to that extent the sense of making a night of it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nyoung men, I believe, keep them for hours, eh? At least they did in my\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed--\xe2\x80\x9cthe wild ones! But I think of them as all wild then.\r\nI dare say that when one settles in town one learns how to manage; only\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, you know, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got completely out of it. I do feel\r\nreally quite mouldy. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of thirty years--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor more than a few days at a time, upon my honour. You won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand that--any more, I dare say, than I myself quite understand\r\nhow at the end of all I\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted this queer view of the doom of\r\ncoming back. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt I shall ask you, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good\r\nas to let me, for the help of a hint or two: as to how to do, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow? and not to--what do you fellows call it?--BE done. Now about one\r\nof THESE things--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of these things was the lift in which, at no great pace and with\r\nmuch rumbling and creaking, the porter conveyed the two gentlemen to\r\nthe alarming eminence, as Mr. Longdon measured their flight, at which\r\nVanderbank perched. The impression made on him by this contrivance\r\nshowed him as unsophisticated, yet when his companion, at the top,\r\nushering him in, gave a touch to the quick light and, in the pleasant\r\nruddy room, all convenience and character, had before the fire another\r\nlook at him, it was not to catch in him any protrusive angle. Mr.\r\nLongdon was slight and neat, delicate of body and both keen and kind of\r\nface, with black brows finely marked and thick smooth hair in which\r\nthe silver had deep shadows. He wore neither whisker nor moustache and\r\nseemed to carry in the flicker of his quick brown eyes and the positive\r\nsun-play of his smile even more than the equivalent of what might,\r\nsuperficially or stupidly, elsewhere be missed in him; which was mass,\r\nsubstance, presence--what is vulgarly called importance. He had indeed\r\nno presence but had somehow an effect. He might almost have been a\r\npriest if priests, as it occurred to Vanderbank, were ever such dandies.\r\nHe had at all events conclusively doubled the Cape of the years--he\r\nwould never again see fifty-five: to the warning light of that bleak\r\nheadland he presented a back sufficiently conscious. Yet though\r\nto Vanderbank he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t look young he came near--strikingly and\r\namusingly--looking new: this after a minute appeared mainly perhaps\r\nindeed in the perfection of his evening dress and the special smartness\r\nof the sleeveless overcoat he had evidently had made to wear with it\r\nand might even actually be wearing for the first time. He had talked to\r\nVanderbank at Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s about Beccles and Suffolk; but it was\r\nnot at Beccles nor anywhere in the county that these ornaments had been\r\ndesigned. His action had already been, with however little purpose,\r\nto present the region to his interlocutor in a favourable light.\r\nVanderbank, for that matter, had the kind of imagination that likes\r\nto PLACE an object, even to the point of losing sight of it in the\r\nconditions; he already saw the nice old nook it must have taken to keep\r\na man of intelligence so fresh while suffering him to remain so fine.\r\nThe product of Beccles accepted at all events a cigarette--still much\r\nas a joke and an adventure--and looked about him as if even more pleased\r\nthan he expected. Then he broke, through his double eye-glass, into an\r\nexclamation that was like a passing pang of envy and regret. \xe2\x80\x9cYou young\r\nmen, you young men--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about us?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s tone encouraged the courtesy of the\r\nreference. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so young moreover as that comes to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you then, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I\xe2\x80\x99m thirty-four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call that? I\xe2\x80\x99m a hundred and three!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon at all\r\nevents took out his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only a quarter past eleven.\xe2\x80\x9d Then with\r\na quick change of interest, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say is your public office?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe General Audit. I\xe2\x80\x99m Deputy Chairman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon looked at him as if he had had fifty windows. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\na head you must have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--our head\xe2\x80\x99s Sir Digby Dence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do we do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you gild the pill--though not perhaps very thick. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndecent berth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thing a good many fellows would give a pound of their flesh for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s visitor appeared so to deprecate too faint a picture that\r\nhe dropped all scruples. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the most envied man I know--so that if I\r\nwere a shade less amiable I should be one of the most hated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon laughed, yet not quite as if they were joking. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. Your\r\npleasant way carries it off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank was, however, not serious. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it carry off anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain his friend, through the pince-nez, appeared to crown him with a\r\nWhitehall cornice. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I ought to let you know I\xe2\x80\x99m studying you.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s really fair to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued with an earnestness not\r\ndiscomposed by the indulgence in Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right--all\r\nright!\xe2\x80\x9d he reassuringly added, having meanwhile stopped before a\r\nphotograph suspended on the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s your mother!\xe2\x80\x9d he brought out\r\nwith something of the elation of a child making a discovery or guessing\r\na riddle. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t make you out in her yet--in my recollection of her,\r\nwhich, as I told you, is perfect; but I dare say I soon shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank was more and more aware that the kind of amusement he excited\r\nwould never in the least be a bar to affection. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease take all your\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked at his watch again. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I HAD better keep\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cab?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank liked him so, found in him such a promise of\r\npleasant things, that he was almost tempted to say: \xe2\x80\x9cDear and delightful\r\nsir, don\xe2\x80\x99t weigh that question; I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay, myself, for the man\xe2\x80\x99s whole\r\nnight!\xe2\x80\x9d His approval at all events was complete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost certainly. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way not to think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you young men, you young men!\xe2\x80\x9d his guest again murmured. He\r\nhad passed on to the photograph--Vanderbank had many, too many\r\nphotographs--of some other relation, and stood wiping the gold-mounted\r\nglasses through which he had been darting admirations and catching\r\nside-lights for shocks. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued as his\r\nfriend attempted once more to throw in a protest; \xe2\x80\x9cI belong to a\r\ndifferent period of history. There have been things this evening that\r\nhave made me feel as if I had been disinterred--literally dug up from a\r\nlong sleep. I assure you there have!\xe2\x80\x9d--he really pressed the point.\r\n\r\nVanderbank wondered a moment what things in particular these might be;\r\nhe found himself wanting to get at everything his visitor represented,\r\nto enter into his consciousness and feel, as it were, on his side. He\r\nglanced with an intention freely sarcastic at an easy possibility. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nextraordinary vitality of Brookenham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, with nippers in place again, fixed on him a gravity\r\nthat failed to prevent his discovering in the eyes behind them a shy\r\nreflexion of his irony. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Brookenham! You must tell me all about\r\nBrookenham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that\xe2\x80\x99s not what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon forbore to deny it. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand what I\r\nmean.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank bristled with the wish to be put to the test, but was\r\nchecked before he could say so. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s HIS place--Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Rivers and Lakes--an awfully good thing. He got it last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon--but not too grossly--wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did he get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, SHE got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend remained grave. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd about how much now--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh twelve hundred--and lots of allowances and boats and things. To do\r\nthe work!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank, still with a certain levity, added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what IS the work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk HIM. He\xe2\x80\x99ll like to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet he seemed to have but little to say.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon exactly measured\r\nit again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh not about that. Try him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked more sharply at his host, as if vaguely suspicious of a trap;\r\nthen not less vaguely he sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s what I came up for--to try\r\nyou all. But do they live on that?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.\r\n\r\nVanderbank once more debated. \xe2\x80\x9cOne doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what they live on.\r\nBut they\xe2\x80\x99ve means--for it was just that fact, I remember, that showed\r\nBrookenham\xe2\x80\x99s getting the place wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a job. It was given, I mean, not\r\nto his mere domestic need, but to his notorious efficiency. He has a\r\nproperty--an ugly little place in Gloucestershire--which they sometimes\r\nlet. His elder brother has the better one, but they make up an income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon for an instant lost himself. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I remember--one heard of\r\nthose things at the time. And SHE must have had something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes indeed, she had something--and she always has her intense\r\ncleverness. She knows thoroughly how. They do it tremendously well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTremendously well,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon intelligently echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut a house in\r\nBuckingham Crescent, with the way they seem to have built through to all\r\nsorts of other places--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh they\xe2\x80\x99re all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank soothingly dropped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne likes to feel that of people with whom one has dined. There are\r\nfour children?\xe2\x80\x9d his friend went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe older boy, whom you saw and who in his way is a wonder, the older\r\ngirl, whom you must see, and two youngsters, male and female, whom you\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere might by this time, in the growing interest of their talk, have\r\nbeen almost nothing too uncanny for Mr. Longdon to fear it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\r\nthe youngsters are--unfortunate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--they\xe2\x80\x99re only, like all the modern young, I think, mysteries,\r\nterrible little baffling mysteries.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank had found amusement\r\nagain--it flickered so from his friend\xe2\x80\x99s face that, really at moments to\r\nthe point of alarm, his explanations deepened darkness. Then with more\r\ninterest he harked back. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the thing you just mentioned--the thing\r\nthat strikes you as odd.\xe2\x80\x9d He produced his knowledge quite with elation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe talk.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon on this only looked at him in silence and\r\nharder, but he went on with assurance: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the talk--for we do talk, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d Still his guest left him without relief, only fixing him and his\r\nsuggestion with a suspended judgement. Whatever the old man was on the\r\npoint of saying, however, he disposed of in a curtailed murmur; he had\r\nalready turned afresh to the series of portraits, and as he glanced at\r\nanother Vanderbank spoke afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very interesting to me to hear from you there, when the ladies\r\nhad left us, how many old threads you were prepared to pick up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had paused. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an old boy who remembers the mothers,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nat last replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you told me how well you remember Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d--and he arrived at a new subject. \xe2\x80\x9cThis must be your sister\r\nMary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it\xe2\x80\x99s very bad, but as she\xe2\x80\x99s dead--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead? Dear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh long ago\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank eased him off. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s delightful of you,\xe2\x80\x9d this\r\ninformant went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto have known also such a lot of MY people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon turned from his contemplation with a visible effort. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfeel obliged to you for taking it so; it mightn\xe2\x80\x99t--one never knows--have\r\namused you. As I told you there, the first thing I did was to ask\r\nFernanda about the company; and when she mentioned your name I\r\nimmediately said: \xe2\x80\x98Would he like me to speak to him?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did Fernanda say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon stared. \xe2\x80\x9cDo YOU call her Fernanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank felt ever so much more guilty than he would have expected.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think it too much in the manner we just mentioned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend hesitated; then with a smile a trifle strange: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me;\r\n_I_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t; and your scruple was magnificent. In point of fact,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI DON\xe2\x80\x99T call Mrs. Brookenham by her Christian\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s clear eyes were searching. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless in speaking of her to\r\nothers?\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed really to wish to know.\r\n\r\nVanderbank was but too ready to satisfy him. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say we seem to\r\nyou a vulgar lot of people. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the way, I can see, you speak of\r\nladies at Beccles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if you laugh at me--!\xe2\x80\x9d And his visitor turned off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t threaten me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cor I WILL send away the cab. Of\r\ncourse I know what you mean. It will be tremendously interesting to hear\r\nhow the sort of thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen into--oh we HAVE fallen in!--strikes\r\nyour fresh, your uncorrupted ear. Do have another cigarette. Sunk as I\r\nmust appear to you it sometimes strikes even mine. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure as\r\nregards Mrs. Brookenham, whom I\xe2\x80\x99ve known a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon again took him up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you people call a long time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank considered. \xe2\x80\x9cAh there you are! And now we\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x98we people\xe2\x80\x99!\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s right--give it to us. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that in one way or another it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall earned. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve known her ten years. But awfully well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call awfully well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe people?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s enquirer, with his continued restless\r\nobservation, moving nearer, the young man had laid on his shoulder the\r\nlightest of friendly hands. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you perhaps ask too much? But no,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he added quickly and gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cof course you don\xe2\x80\x99t: if I don\xe2\x80\x99t look out\r\nI shall have exactly the effect on you I don\xe2\x80\x99t want. I dare say I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow HOW well I know Mrs. Brookenham. Mustn\xe2\x80\x99t that sort of thing be\r\nput in a manner to the proof? What I meant to say just now was that I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t--at least I hope I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t--have named her as I did save to\r\nan old friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked promptly satisfied and reassured. \xe2\x80\x9cYou probably heard\r\nme address her myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve your rights, and that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t excuse me. The only\r\nthing is that I go to see her every Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon pondered and then, a little to Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, at any\r\nrate to his deeper amusement, candidly asked: \xe2\x80\x9cOnly Fernanda? No other\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, several other ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon appeared to hear this with pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite right. We\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t make enough of Sunday at Beccles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh we make plenty of it in London!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrather in my interest I should mention that Mrs. Brookenham calls ME--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis visitor covered him now with an attention that just operated as a\r\ncheck. \xe2\x80\x9cBy your Christian name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Vanderbank could in any degree attenuate \xe2\x80\x9cWhat IS your Christian\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon asked.\r\n\r\nVanderbank felt of a sudden almost guilty--as if his answer could only\r\nimpute extravagance to the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Christian name\xe2\x80\x9d--he blushed it\r\nout--\xe2\x80\x9cis Gustavus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend took a droll conscious leap. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she calls you Gussy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not even Gussy. But I scarcely think I ought to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cif she herself gave you no glimpse of the fact. Any\r\nimplication that she consciously avoided it might make you see deeper\r\ndepths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with pointed levity, but his companion showed him after an\r\ninstant a face just covered--and a little painfully--with the vision of\r\nthe possibility brushed away by the joke. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m not so bad as that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mr. Longdon modestly ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do it always,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nmoreover to what some people are called. Why, there was a fellow\r\nthere--\xe2\x80\x9d He pulled up, however, and, thinking better of it, selected\r\nanother instance. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Duchess--weren\xe2\x80\x99t you introduced to the\r\nDuchess?--never calls me anything but \xe2\x80\x98Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99 unless she calls me\r\n\xe2\x80\x98caro mio.\xe2\x80\x99 It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken much to make her appeal to YOU with\r\nan \xe2\x80\x98I say, Longdon!\xe2\x80\x99 I can quite hear her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, focussing the effect of the sketch, pointed its moral\r\nwith an indulgent: \xe2\x80\x9cOh well, a FOREIGN duchess!\xe2\x80\x9d He could make his\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s invidiously, cruelly foreign,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank agreed: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever indeed seen a woman avail herself so cleverly, to make up for the\r\nobloquy of that state, of the benefits and immunities it brings with it.\r\nShe has bloomed in the hot-house of her widowhood--she\xe2\x80\x99s a Neapolitan\r\nhatched by an incubator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Neapolitan?\xe2\x80\x9d--Mr. Longdon seemed all civilly to wish he had only\r\nknown it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer husband was one; but I believe that dukes at Naples are as thick\r\nas princes at Petersburg. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead, at any rate, poor man, and she has\r\ncome back here to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGloomily, I should think--after Naples?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon threw out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it would take more than even a Neapolitan past--! However\xe2\x80\x9d--and the\r\nyoung man caught himself up--\xe2\x80\x9cshe lives not in what\xe2\x80\x99s behind her, but in\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s before--she lives in her precious little Aggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Aggie?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon risked a cautious interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take a liberty there,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank smiled: \xe2\x80\x9cI speak only of the\r\nyoung Agnesina, a little girl, the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s niece, or rather I believe\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s, whom she has adopted--in the place of a daughter early\r\nlost--and has brought to England to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh to some great man of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave a vague but expressive sigh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s rather lovely, little Aggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked conspicuously subtle. \xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE the man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I look like a \xe2\x80\x98great\xe2\x80\x99 one?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank broke in.\r\n\r\nHis visitor, turning away from him, again embraced the room. \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear,\r\nyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, to show how right you are, there\xe2\x80\x99s the young lady.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npointed to an object on one of the tables, a small photograph with a\r\nvery wide border of something that looked like crimson fur.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon took up the picture; he was serious now. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nbeautiful--but she\xe2\x80\x99s not a little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Naples they develop early. She\xe2\x80\x99s only seventeen or eighteen, I\r\nsuppose; but I never know how old--or at least how young--girls are, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. An aunt, at any rate, has of course nothing to conceal.\r\nShe IS extremely pretty--with extraordinary red hair and a complexion to\r\nmatch; great rarities I believe, in that race and latitude. She gave me\r\nthe portrait--frame and all. The frame is Neapolitan enough and little\r\nAggie\xe2\x80\x99s charming.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Vanderbank subjoined: \xe2\x80\x9cBut not so charming as\r\nlittle Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Nanda?--have you got HER?\xe2\x80\x9d The old man was all eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s over there beside the lamp--also a present from the original.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had gone to the place--little Nanda was in glazed white\r\nwood. He took her up and held her out; for a moment he said nothing,\r\nbut presently, over his glasses, rested on his host a look intenser\r\neven than his scrutiny of the faded image. \xe2\x80\x9cDo they give their portraits\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle girls--innocent lambs? Surely--to old friends. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t they in\r\nyour time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon studied the portrait again; after which, with an exhalation\r\nof something between superiority and regret, \xe2\x80\x9cThey never did to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can have all you want now!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed.\r\n\r\nHis friend gave a slow droll headshake. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want them \xe2\x80\x98now\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could do with them, my dear sir, still,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank continued in\r\nthe same manner, \xe2\x80\x9cevery bit _I_ do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you do nothing you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon kept the photograph\r\nand continued to look at it. \xe2\x80\x9cHer mother told me about her--promised me\r\nI should see her next time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must--she\xe2\x80\x99s a great friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon was really deep in it. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she clever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me if you think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh with a child of seventeen--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon murmured it as if in dread\r\nof having to pronounce. \xe2\x80\x9cThis one too IS seventeen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank again considered. \xe2\x80\x9cEighteen.\xe2\x80\x9d He just hung fire once\r\nmore, then brought out: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, call it nearly nineteen. I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept her\r\nbirthdays,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\nHis companion caught at the idea. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour _I_ should like to!\r\nWhen is the next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty of time--the fifteenth of June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only too sorry to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d Laying down the object he had been\r\nexamining Mr. Longdon took another turn about the room, and his manner\r\nwas such an appeal to his host to accept his restlessness that as he\r\ncirculated the latter watched him with encouragement. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to you\r\njust now that I knew the mothers, but it would have been more to the\r\npoint to say the grandmothers.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped before his young friend,\r\nthen nodded at the image of Nanda. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew HERS. She put it at something\r\nless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank rather failed to understand. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old lady? Put what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s face showed him as for a moment feeling his way. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nspeaking of Mrs. Brookenham. She spoke of her daughter as only sixteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s amusement at the tone of this broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cShe usually does!\r\nShe has done so, I think, for the last year or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis visitor dropped upon his sofa as with the weight of something sudden\r\nand fresh; then from this place, with a sharp little movement, tossed\r\ninto the fire the end of a cigarette. Vanderbank offered him another,\r\nand as he accepted it and took a light he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re doing with me--I never at home smoke so much!\xe2\x80\x9d But he puffed away\r\nand, seated near, laid his hand on Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s arm as to help himself\r\nto utter something too delicate not to be guarded and yet too important\r\nnot to be risked. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of thing I did mean--as one of\r\nmy impressions.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank continued at a loss and he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nrefer--if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying so--to what you said just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank was conscious of a deep desire to draw from him whatever\r\nmight come; so sensible was it somehow that whatever in him was good was\r\nalso thoroughly personal. But our young friend had to think a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsee, I see. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s more probable than that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said something nasty;\r\nbut which of my particular horrors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, your conveying that she makes her daughter out younger--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make herself out the same?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank took him straight up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nnasty my doing that? I see, I see. Yes, yes: I rather gave her away, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re struck by it--as is most delightful you SHOULD be--because you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nin every way of a better tradition and, knowing Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nfriend, can\xe2\x80\x99t conceive of one\xe2\x80\x99s playing on a friend a trick so vulgar\r\nand odious. It strikes you also probably as the kind of thing we must be\r\nconstantly doing; it strikes you that right and left, probably, we keep\r\ngiving each other away. Well, I dare say we do. Yes, \xe2\x80\x98come to think\r\nof it,\xe2\x80\x99 as they say in America, we do. But what shall I tell you?\r\nPractically we all know it and allow for it and it\xe2\x80\x99s as broad as it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlong. What\xe2\x80\x99s London life after all? It\xe2\x80\x99s tit for tat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but what becomes of friendship?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon earnestly and\r\npleadingly asked, while he still held Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s arm as if under the\r\nspell of the vivid explanation supplied him.\r\n\r\nThe young man met his eyes only the more sociably. \xe2\x80\x9cFriendship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriendship.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon maintained the full value of the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion risked, \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say it isn\xe2\x80\x99t in London by any\r\nmeans what it is at Beccles. I quite literally mean that,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nreassuringly added; \xe2\x80\x9cI never really have believed in the existence of\r\nfriendship in big societies--in great towns and great crowds. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nplant that takes time and space and air; and London society is a huge\r\n\xe2\x80\x98squash,\xe2\x80\x99 as we elegantly call it--an elbowing pushing perspiring\r\nchattering mob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I don\xe2\x80\x99t say THAT of you!\xe2\x80\x9d the visitor murmured with a withdrawal\r\nof his hand and a visible scruple for the sweeping concession he had\r\nevoked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo say it then--for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake; let some one say it, so that something\r\nor other, whatever it may be, may come of it! It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to say too\r\nmuch--it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to say enough. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything any one can\r\nsay that I won\xe2\x80\x99t agree to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shows you really don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man returned with acuteness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh we\xe2\x80\x99re past saving, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care, you don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x9d his guest repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cand--if I may be\r\nfrank with you--I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if it were rather a pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pity I don\xe2\x80\x99t care?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to, you ought to.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr. Longdon paused. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I say all I\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you _I_ shall! You\xe2\x80\x99re awfully interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo are you, if you come to that. It\xe2\x80\x99s just what I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in my head.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s something I seem to make out in you--!\xe2\x80\x9d He abruptly dropped\r\nthis, however, going on in another way. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember the rest of you, but\r\nwhy did I never see YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have been at school--at college. Perhaps you did know my\r\nbrothers, elder and younger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a boy with your mother at Malvern. I was near her there for\r\nthree months in--what WAS the year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank replied while his guest tried to fix the date.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my brother Miles. He was awfully clever, but had no health,\r\npoor chap, and we lost him at seventeen. She used to take houses at such\r\nplaces with him--it was supposed to be for his benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon listened with a visible recovery. \xe2\x80\x9cHe used to talk to me--I\r\nremember he asked me questions I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer and made me dreadfully\r\nashamed. But I lent him books--partly, upon my honour, to make him think\r\nthat as I had them I did know something. He read everything and had a\r\nlot to say about it. I used to tell your mother he had a great future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank shook his head sadly and kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cSo he had. And you remember\r\nNancy, who was handsome and who was usually with them?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked so uncertain that he explained he meant his other\r\nsister; on which his companion said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh her? Yes, she was charming--she\r\nevidently had a future too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s in the midst of her future now. She\xe2\x80\x99s married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whom did she marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fellow called Toovey. A man in the City.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon a little blankly. Then as if to retrieve his\r\nblankness: \xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you call her Nancy? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her name Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly--Blanche Bertha Vanderbank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked half-mystified and half-distressed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nNancy Toovey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank broke into laughter at his dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what every one\r\ncalls her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows. You see you were right about her future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon gave another of his soft smothered sighs; he had turned back\r\nagain to the first photograph, which he looked at for a longer time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t HER way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s? No indeed. Oh my mother\xe2\x80\x99s way--!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank waited, then\r\nadded gravely: \xe2\x80\x9cShe was taken in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon turned half-round as to reply to this, but instead of\r\nreplying proceeded afresh to an examination of the expressive oval in\r\nthe red plush frame. He took up little Aggie, who appeared to interest\r\nhim, and abruptly observed: \xe2\x80\x9cNanda isn\xe2\x80\x99t so pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not nearly. There\xe2\x80\x99s a great question whether Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s pretty at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon continued to inspect her more favoured friend; which led him\r\nafter a moment to bring out: \xe2\x80\x9cShe ought to be, you know. Her grandmother\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh and her mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank threw in. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think Mrs.\r\nBrookenham lovely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon kept him waiting a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNot so lovely as Lady Julia.\r\nLady Julia had--!\xe2\x80\x9d He faltered; then, as if there were too much to say,\r\ndisposed of the question. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Julia had everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank gathered hence an impression that determined him more and\r\nmore to diplomacy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just what Mrs. Brookenham has?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time the old man was prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s very brilliant, but it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na totally different thing.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid little Aggie down and moved away as\r\nwithout a purpose; but his friend presently perceived his purpose to\r\nbe another glance at the other young lady. As if all accidentally and\r\nabsently he bent again over the portrait of Nanda. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Julia was\r\nexquisite and this child\xe2\x80\x99s exactly like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, more and more conscious of something working in him,\r\nwas more and more interested. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s so like her, WAS she so\r\nexquisite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; every one was agreed about that.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon kept his eyes on\r\nthe face, trying a little, Vanderbank even thought, to conceal his own.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was one of the greatest beauties of her day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen IS Nanda so like her?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank persisted, amused at his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s transparency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtraordinarily. Her mother told me all about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTold you she\xe2\x80\x99s as beautiful as her grandmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that she has just Lady Julia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpression. She absolutely HAS it--I see it here.\xe2\x80\x9d He was delightfully\r\npositive. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s much more like the dead than like the living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank saw in this too many deep things not to follow them up.\r\nOne of these was, to begin with, that his guest had not more than\r\nhalf-succumbed to Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s attraction, if indeed he had by\r\na fine originality not resisted it altogether. That in itself, for\r\nan observer deeply versed in this lady, was attaching and beguiling.\r\nAnother indication was that he found himself, in spite of such a break\r\nin the chain, distinctly predisposed to Nanda. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she reproduces then\r\nso vividly Lady Julia,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man threw out, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy does she strike\r\nyou as so much less pretty than her foreign friend there, who is after\r\nall by no means a prodigy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe subject of this address, with one of the photographs in his hand,\r\nglanced, while he reflected, at the other. Then with a subtlety that\r\nmatched itself for the moment with Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s: \xe2\x80\x9cYou just told me\r\nyourself that the little foreign person--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs ever so much the lovelier of the two? So I did. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve promptly\r\nrecognised it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank went on, to let him\r\ndown more gently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Mrs. Brookenham admit the girl\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nlooks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer own girl\xe2\x80\x99s? \xe2\x80\x98Admit\xe2\x80\x99 them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean grant them to be even as good as they are. I myself, I must\r\ntell you, extremely like Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. I think Lady Julia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngranddaughter has in her face, in spite of everything--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by everything?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon broke in with such an\r\napproach to resentment that his host\xe2\x80\x99s gaiety overflowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see--when you do see. She has no features. No, not one,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank inexorably pursued; \xe2\x80\x9cunless indeed you put it that she has\r\ntwo or three too many. What I was going to say was that she has in\r\nher expression all that\xe2\x80\x99s charming in her nature. But beauty, in\r\nLondon\xe2\x80\x9d--and feeling that he held his visitor\xe2\x80\x99s attention he gave\r\nhimself the pleasure of freely presenting his idea--\xe2\x80\x9cstaring glaring\r\nobvious knock-down beauty, as plain as a poster on a wall, an\r\nadvertisement of soap or whiskey, something that speaks to the crowd\r\nand crosses the footlights, fetches such a price in the market that\r\nthe absence of it, for a woman with a girl to marry, inspires endless\r\nterrors and constitutes for the wretched pair (to speak of mother and\r\ndaughter alone) a sort of social bankruptcy. London doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love the\r\nlatent or the lurking, has neither time nor taste nor sense for anything\r\nless discernible than the red flag in front of the steam-roller. It\r\nwants cash over the counter and letters ten feet high. Therefore you see\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all as yet rather a dark question for poor Nanda--a question that\r\nin a way quite occupies the foreground of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s earnest little\r\nlife. How WILL she look, what will be thought of her and what will\r\nshe be able to do for herself? She\xe2\x80\x99s at the age when the whole\r\nthing--speaking of her \xe2\x80\x98attractions,\xe2\x80\x99 her possible share of good\r\nlooks--is still to a degree in a fog. But everything depends on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had by this time come back to him. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my asking\r\nit again--for you take such jumps: what, once more, do you mean by\r\neverything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy naturally her marrying. Above all her marrying early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon stood before the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by early?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we do doubtless get up later than at Beccles; but that gives\r\nus, you see, shorter days. I mean in a couple of seasons. Soon enough,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank developed, \xe2\x80\x9cto limit the strain--!\xe2\x80\x9d He was moved to higher\r\ngaiety by his friend\xe2\x80\x99s expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by the strain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the complication of her being there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do put one through!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed. But he showed himself\r\nperfectly prepared. \xe2\x80\x9cOut of the school-room and where she is now. In her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room. At her mother\xe2\x80\x99s fireside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon stared. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where else should she be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt her husband\xe2\x80\x99s, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked as if he quite saw, yet was nevertheless not to be put off\r\nfrom his original challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cAh certainly; but not as if she had been\r\npushed down the chimney. All in good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call good time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy time to make herself loved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the men who come to the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon slightly attenuated this way of putting it. \xe2\x80\x9cYes--and in the\r\nhome circle. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x98strain\xe2\x80\x99 of her being suffered to be a member\r\nof it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nVanderbank at this left his corner of the sofa and, with his hands\r\nin his pockets and a manner so amused that it might have passed for\r\nexcited, took several paces about the room while his interlocutor,\r\nwatching him, waited for his response. That gentleman, as this response\r\nfor a minute hung fire, took his turn at sitting down, and then\r\nVanderbank stopped before him with a face in which something had been\r\nstill more brightly kindled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ask me more things than I can tell\r\nyou. You ask me more than I think you suspect. You must come and see me\r\nagain--you must let me come and see you. You raise the most interesting\r\nquestions and we must sooner or later have them all out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked happy in such a prospect, but once more took out his\r\nwatch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wants five minutes to midnight. Which means that I must go\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least. There are satisfactions you too must give.\xe2\x80\x9d His host,\r\nwith an irresistible hand, confirmed him in his position and pressed\r\nupon him another cigarette. His resistance rang hollow--it was clearly,\r\nhe judged, such an occasion for sacrifices. Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s view of it\r\nmeanwhile was quite as marked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see there\xe2\x80\x99s ever so much more you\r\nmust in common kindness tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon sat there like a shy singer invited to strike up. \xe2\x80\x9cI told\r\nyou everything at Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s. It comes over me now how I dropped\r\non you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you told me,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank returned, \xe2\x80\x9cwas excellent so far as it\r\nwent; but it was only after all that, having caught my name, you had\r\nasked of our friend if I belonged to people you had known years before,\r\nand then, from what she had said, had--with what you were so good as to\r\ncall great pleasure--made out that I did. You came round to me on this,\r\nafter dinner, and gave me a pleasure still greater. But that only takes\r\nus part of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon said nothing, but there was something\r\nappreciative in his conscious lapses; they were a tribute to his young\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s frequent felicity. This personage indeed appeared more and more\r\nto take them for that--which was not without its effect on his spirits.\r\nAt last, with a flight of some freedom, he brought their pause to a\r\nclose. \xe2\x80\x9cYou loved Lady Julia.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as the attitude of his guest, who\r\nserenely met his eyes, was practically a contribution to the subject,\r\nhe went on with a feeling that he had positively pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cYou lost\r\nher--and you\xe2\x80\x99re unmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s smile was beautiful--it supplied so many meanings that\r\nwhen presently he spoke he seemed already to have told half his story.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my life took a form. It had to, or I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what would have\r\nbecome of me, and several things that all happened at once helped me\r\nout. My father died--I came into the little place in Suffolk. My sister,\r\nmy only one, who had married and was older than I, lost within a year or\r\ntwo both her husband and her little boy. I offered her, in the country,\r\na home, for her trouble was greater than any trouble of mine. She came,\r\nshe stayed; it went on and on and we lived there together. We were sorry\r\nfor each other and it somehow suited us. But she died two years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank took all this in, only wishing to show--wishing by this time\r\nquite tenderly--that he even read into it deeply enough all the unsaid.\r\nHe filled out another of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s gaps. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here you are.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\r\ninvited Mr. Longdon himself to make the stride. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a great\r\nsuccess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that we shall be so infatuated with you that we shall make your\r\nlife a burden to you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see soon enough what I mean by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said; \xe2\x80\x9cto understand you I shall have to. You\r\nspeak of something that as yet--with my race practically run--I know\r\nnothing about. I was no success as a young man. I mean of the sort that\r\nwould have made most difference. People wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, WE shall look at you,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank declared. Then he added: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\npeople do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d And before his friend could reply: \xe2\x80\x9cLady Julia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s assent was mute. \xe2\x80\x9cAh she was not the worst! I mean that\r\nwhat made it so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwas that they all really liked\r\nme. Your mother, I think--as to THAT, the dreadful consolatory\r\n\xe2\x80\x98liking\xe2\x80\x99--even more than the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank was surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean there was a\r\nquestion--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh for but half a minute! It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take her long. It was five years\r\nafter your father\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis explanation was very delicately made. \xe2\x80\x9cShe COULD marry again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I suppose you know she did,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it soon enough!\xe2\x80\x9d With this, abruptly, Mr. Longdon pulled himself\r\nforward. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank. \xe2\x80\x9cBut wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that AFTER Lady Julia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the edge of the sofa, his hands supporting him, Mr. Longdon looked\r\nstraight. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was nothing after Lady Julia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d His companion smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother was earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was extremely good to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not speaking of that time at\r\nMalvern--that came later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely--I understand. You\xe2\x80\x99re speaking of the first years of her\r\nwidowhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon just faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cI should call them rather the last. Six\r\nmonths later came her second marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s interest visibly improved. \xe2\x80\x9cAh it was THEN? That was about\r\nmy seventh year.\xe2\x80\x9d He called things back and pieced them together. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nshe must have been older than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--a little. She was kindness itself to me at all events, then and\r\nafterwards. That was the charm of the weeks at Malvern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe charm was that you had recovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon, rather to his mystification, exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t recovered at all--hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean, got\r\nover my misery and my melancholy. She knew I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t--and that was what\r\nwas nice of her. She was a person with whom I could talk about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank took a moment to clear up the ambiguity. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you mean you\r\ncould talk about the OTHER. You hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got over Lady Julia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon sadly smiled at him. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got over her yet!\xe2\x80\x9d Then,\r\nhowever, as if not to look morbid, he took pains to be clear. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first\r\nwound was bad--but from that one always comes round. Your mother,\r\ndear woman, had known how to help me. Lady Julia was at that time her\r\nintimate friend--it was she who introduced me there. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nwhat happened--she did her best. What I meant just now was that in the\r\naftertime, when opportunity occurred, she was the one person with whom I\r\ncould always talk and who always understood.\xe2\x80\x9d He lost himself an instant\r\nin the deep memories to attest which he had survived alone; then he\r\nsighed out as if the taste of it all came back to him with a faint\r\nsweetness: \xe2\x80\x9cI think they must both have been good to me. At the Malvern\r\ntime, the particular time I just mentioned to you, Lady Julia was\r\nalready married, and during those first years she had been whirled out\r\nof my ken. Then her own life took a quieter turn; we met again; I went\r\nfor a good while often to her house. I think she rather liked the state\r\nto which she had reduced me, though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t, you know, in the least\r\npresume on it. The better a woman is--it has often struck me--the more\r\nshe enjoys in a quiet way some fellow\xe2\x80\x99s having been rather bad, rather\r\ndark and desperate, about her--for her. I dare say, I mean, that though\r\nLady Julia insisted I ought to marry she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really have liked it\r\nmuch if I had. At any rate it was in those years I saw her daughter just\r\ncease to be a child--the little girl who was to be transformed by time\r\ninto the so different person with whom we dined to-night. That comes\r\nback to me when I hear you speak of the growing up, in turn, of that\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s own daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI follow you with a sympathy--!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThe situation\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreproduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh partly--not altogether. The things that are unlike--well, are so\r\nVERY unlike.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon for a moment, on this, fixed his companion\r\nwith eyes that betrayed one of the restless little jumps of his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntold you just now that there\xe2\x80\x99s something I seem to make out in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that was meant for better things?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank frankly took him\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cThere IS something, I really believe--meant for ever so much better\r\nones. Those are just the sort I like to be supposed to have a real\r\naffinity with. Help me to them, Mr. Longdon; help me to them, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what I won\xe2\x80\x99t do for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen after all\xe2\x80\x9d--and his friend made the point with innocent\r\nsharpness--\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re NOT past saving!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I individually--how shall I put it to you? If I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve that sort of fulcrum for salvation which\r\nconsists at least in a deep consciousness and the absence of a rag of\r\nillusion, I shall appear to say I\xe2\x80\x99m wholly different from the world I\r\nlive in and to that extent present myself as superior and fatuous. Try\r\nme at any rate. Let me try myself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t abandon me. See what can be\r\ndone with me. Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m after all a case. I shall certainly cling to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too clever--you\xe2\x80\x99re too clever: that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith us ALL?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Longdon, it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it. If you should say the matter with ME in particular, why\r\nthere might be something in it. What you mean at any rate--I see where\r\nyou come out--is that we\xe2\x80\x99re cold and sarcastic and cynical, without the\r\nsoft human spot. I think you flatter us even while you attempt to warn;\r\nbut what\xe2\x80\x99s extremely interesting at all events is that, as I gather,\r\nwe made on you this evening, in a particular way, a collective\r\nimpression--something in which our trifling varieties are merged.\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s face, at this, appeared to acknowledge his putting the case\r\nin perfection, so that he was encouraged to go on. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was something\r\nparticular with which you weren\xe2\x80\x99t altogether pleasantly struck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, who decidedly changed colour easily, showed in his clear\r\ncheek the effect at once of feeling a finger on his fault and of\r\nadmiring his companion\xe2\x80\x99s insight. But he accepted the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help noticing your tone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean its being so low?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had smiled at first but looked grave now. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really want to\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust how you were affected? I assure you there\xe2\x80\x99s at this moment nothing\r\nI desire nearly so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no judge then,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon began; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no critic; I\xe2\x80\x99m no talker\r\nmyself. I\xe2\x80\x99m old-fashioned and narrow and ignorant. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived for years\r\nin a hole. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a man of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank considered him with a benevolence, a geniality of approval,\r\nthat he literally had to hold in check for fear of seeming to patronise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not one of us who can touch you. You\xe2\x80\x99re delightful, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwonderful, and I\xe2\x80\x99m intensely curious to hear you,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man\r\npursued. \xe2\x80\x9cWere we absolutely odious?\xe2\x80\x9d Before his guest\xe2\x80\x99s puzzled,\r\nfinally almost pained face, such an air of appreciating so much candour,\r\nyet of looking askance at so much freedom, he could only try to smooth\r\nthe way and light the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see we don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least know where\r\nwe are. We\xe2\x80\x99re lost--and you find us.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon, as he spoke, had\r\nprepared at last really to go, reaching the door with a manner that\r\ndenoted, however, by no means so much satiety as an attention that felt\r\nitself positively too agitated. Vanderbank had helped him on with the\r\nInverness cape and for an instant detained him by it. \xe2\x80\x9cJust tell me as a\r\nkindness. DO we talk--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo freely?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon, with his clear eyes so untouched by time,\r\nspeculatively murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo outrageously. I want the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe truth evidently for Mr. Longdon was difficult to tell. \xe2\x80\x9cWell--it was\r\ncertainly different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom you and Lady Julia? I see. Well, of course with time SOME change\r\nis natural, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But so different,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank pressed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nwere really shocked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis visitor smiled at this, but the smile somehow made the face graver.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I was rather frightened. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SECOND. LITTLE AGGIE\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham stopped on the threshold with the sharp surprise of the\r\nsight of her son, and there was disappointment, though rather of the\r\nafflicted than of the irritated sort, in the question that, slowly\r\nadvancing, she launched at him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re still lolling about why did\r\nyou tell me two hours ago that you were leaving immediately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeep in a large brocaded chair with his little legs stuck out to the\r\nfire, he was so much at his ease that he was almost flat on his back.\r\nShe had evidently roused him from sleep, and it took him a couple\r\nof minutes--during which, without again looking at him, she directly\r\napproached a beautiful old French secretary, a fine piece of the period\r\nof Louis Seize--to justify his presence. \xe2\x80\x9cI changed my mind. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99re not going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking it over. What\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow to do?\xe2\x80\x9d He sat up a little,\r\nstaring with conscious solemnity at the fire, and if it had been--as\r\nit was not--one of the annoyances she in general expected from him,\r\nshe might have received the impression that his flush was the heat of\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s to keep out of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned--\xe2\x80\x9cwhen he has led one so\r\ndeeply to hope it.\xe2\x80\x9d There had been a bunch of keys dangling from\r\nthe secretary, of which as she said these words Mrs. Brookenham took\r\npossession. Her air on observing them had promptly become that of having\r\nbeen in search of them, and a moment after she had passed across the\r\nroom they were in her pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t go what excuse will you\r\ngive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to YOU, mummy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood before him and now dismally looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter\r\nwith you? What an extraordinary time to take a nap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had fallen back in the chair, from the depths of which he met her\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s just THE time, mummy. I did it on purpose. I can always\r\ngo to sleep when I like. I assure you it sees one through things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away with impatience and, glancing about the room, perceived\r\non a small table of the same type as the secretary a somewhat massive\r\nbook with the label of a circulating library, which she proceeded to\r\npick up as for refuge from the impression made on her by her boy. He\r\nwatched her do this and watched her then slightly pause at the wide\r\nwindow that, in Buckingham Crescent, commanded the prospect they had\r\nramified rearward to enjoy; a medley of smoky brick and spotty stucco,\r\nof other undressed backs, of glass invidiously opaque, of roofs and\r\nchimney-pots and stables unnaturally near--one of the private pictures\r\nthat in London, in select situations, run up, as the phrase is, the\r\nrent. There was no indication of value now, however, in the character\r\nconferred on the scene by a cold spring rain. The place had moreover\r\na confessed out-of-season vacancy. She appeared to have determined on\r\nsilence for the present mark of her relation with Harold, yet she soon\r\nfailed to resist a sufficiently poor reason for breaking it. \xe2\x80\x9cBe so good\r\nas to get out of my chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cif I oblige you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe never moved--but as if only the more directly and intimately to meet\r\nher--and she stood again before the fire and sounded his strange little\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is, but you give me sometimes a kind of\r\nterror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA terror, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe found another place, sinking sadly down and opening her book, and\r\nthe next moment he got up and came over to kiss her, on which she drew\r\nher cheek wearily aside. \xe2\x80\x9cYou bore me quite to death,\xe2\x80\x9d she coldly said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I give you up to your fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call my fate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh something dreadful--if only by its being publicly ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She turned vaguely the pages of her book. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too selfish--too\r\nsickening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d he wonderingly whistled while he wandered back to the\r\nhearth-rug, on which, with his hands behind him, he lingered a while.\r\nHe was small and had a slight stoop which somehow gave him\r\ncharacter--character of the insidious sort carried out in the acuteness,\r\ndifficult to trace to a source, of his smooth fair face, where the lines\r\nwere all curves and the expression all needles. He had the voice of a\r\nman of forty and was dressed--as if markedly not for London--with an\r\nair of experience that seemed to match it. He pulled down his waistcoat,\r\nsmoothing himself, feeling his neat hair and looking at his shoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took your five pounds. Also two of the sovereigns,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nleft you two pound ten.\xe2\x80\x9d His mother jerked up her head at this,\r\nfacing him in dismay, and, immediately on her feet, passed back to the\r\nsecretary. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite as I say,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted; \xe2\x80\x9cyou should have locked\r\nit BEFORE, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? It grinned at me there with all its charming\r\nbrasses, and what was I to do? Darling mummy, I COULDN\xe2\x80\x99T start--that was\r\nthe truth. I thought I should find something--I had noticed; and I do\r\nhope you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me keep it, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x99s all up with me. I\r\nstopped over on purpose--on purpose, I mean, to tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you call that a sense of honour? And now you only stand and glower\r\nat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham was, in her forty-first year, still charmingly pretty,\r\nand the nearest approach she made at this moment to meeting her son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndescription of her was by looking beautifully desperate. She had about\r\nher the pure light of youth--would always have it; her head, her figure,\r\nher flexibility, her flickering colour, her lovely silly eyes, her\r\nnatural quavering tone, all played together toward this effect by\r\nsome trick that had never yet been exposed. It was at the same time\r\nremarkable that--at least in the bosom of her family--she rarely wore\r\nan appearance of gaiety less qualified than at the present juncture;\r\nshe suggested for the most part the luxury, the novelty of woe, the\r\nexcitement of strange sorrows and the cultivation of fine indifferences.\r\nThis was her special sign--an innocence dimly tragic. It gave immense\r\neffect to her other resources. She opened the secretary with the key\r\nshe had quickly found, then with the aid of another rattled out a small\r\ndrawer; after which she pushed the drawer back, closing the whole thing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou terrify me--you terrify me,\xe2\x80\x9d she again said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you say that when you showed me just now how well you know me?\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it just on account of what you thought I might do that you took\r\nout the keys as soon as you came in?\xe2\x80\x9d Harold\xe2\x80\x99s manner had a way of\r\nclearing up whenever he could talk of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too utterly disgusting--I shall speak to your father,\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\nwhich, going to the chair he had given up, his mother sank down again\r\nwith her heavy book. There was no anger, however, in her voice, and\r\nnot even a harsh plaint; only a detached accepted disenchantment. Mrs.\r\nBrookenham\xe2\x80\x99s supreme rebellion against fate was just to show with the\r\nlast frankness how much she was bored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, darling mummy, you won\xe2\x80\x99t speak to my father--you\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything in\r\nthe world rather than that,\xe2\x80\x9d Harold replied, quite as if he were kindly\r\nexplaining her to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you immensely for the charming way\r\nyou take what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done; it was because I had a conviction of that that\r\nI waited for you to know it. It was all very well to tell you I\xe2\x80\x99d start\r\non my visit--but how the deuce was I to start without a penny in the\r\nworld? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that if you want me to go about you must really\r\nenter into my needs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to heaven you\xe2\x80\x99d leave me--I wish to heaven you\xe2\x80\x99d get out of the\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham went on without looking up.\r\n\r\nHarold took out his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, mamma, now I AM ready: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\nthe least before. But it will be going forth, you know, quite to seek\r\nmy fortune. For do you really think--I must have from you what you do\r\nthink--that it will be all right for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fixed him at last with her pretty pathos. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean for you to go to\r\nBrander?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with his manner as of letting her see her own\r\nattitude, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know you try to make me do things you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at all do\r\nyourself. At least I hope you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that if I so\r\nfar oblige you I must at least be paid for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother leaned back in her chair, gazed for a moment at the ceiling\r\nand then closed her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE frightful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nappalling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always wanting to get me out of the house,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink you want to get us ALL out, for you manage to keep Nanda from\r\nshowing even more than you do me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think your children good\r\nENOUGH, mummy dear? At any rate it\xe2\x80\x99s as plain as possible that if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t keep us at home you must keep us in other places. One can\xe2\x80\x99t live\r\nanywhere for nothing--it\xe2\x80\x99s all bosh that a fellow saves by staying with\r\npeople. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it is for a lady, but a man\xe2\x80\x99s practically let\r\nin--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know you kill me, Harold?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham woefully interposed.\r\nBut it was with the same remote melancholy that she asked in the next\r\nbreath: \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an INVITATION--to Brander?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as I told you. She said she\xe2\x80\x99d write, fixing a time; but she never\r\ndid write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if YOU wrote--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes to the same thing? DOES it?--that\xe2\x80\x99s the question. If on my\r\nnote she didn\xe2\x80\x99t write--that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean. Should one simply take it\r\nthat one\xe2\x80\x99s wanted? I like to have these things FROM you, mother. I do, I\r\nbelieve, everything you say; but to feel safe and right I must just HAVE\r\nthem. Any one WOULD want me, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham had opened her eyes, but she still attached them to the\r\ncornice. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted you she\xe2\x80\x99d have written to keep you off.\r\nIn a great house like that there\xe2\x80\x99s always room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man watched her a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHow you DO like to tuck us in and\r\nthen sit up yourself! What do you want to do, anyway? What ARE you up\r\nto, mummy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose at this, turning her eyes about the room as if from the\r\nextremity of martyrdom or the wistfulness of some deep thought. Yet when\r\nshe spoke it was with a different expression, an expression that\r\nwould have served for an observer as a marked illustration of that\r\ndisconnectedness of her parts which frequently was laughable even to the\r\ndegree of contributing to her social success. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve spent then more\r\nthan four pounds in five days. It was on Friday I gave them to you. What\r\nin the world do you suppose is going to become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold continued to look at her as if the question demanded some answer\r\nreally helpful. \xe2\x80\x9cDo we live beyond our means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe now moved her gaze to the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you PLEASE get away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything to assist you. Only, if I SHOULD find I\xe2\x80\x99m not wanted--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe met his look after an instant, and the wan loveliness and vagueness\r\nof her own had never been greater. \xe2\x80\x9cBE wanted, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t find it.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re odious, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his arms about her now for farewell, and she submitted as if it\r\nwas absolutely indifferent to her to whose bosom she was pressed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndo, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9csay such sweet things!\xe2\x80\x9d And with that he\r\nreached the door, on opening which he pulled up at a sound from below.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duchess! She\xe2\x80\x99s coming up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham looked quickly round the room, but she spoke with utter\r\ndetachment. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let her come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I\xe2\x80\x99d let her go. I take it as a happy sign SHE won\xe2\x80\x99t be at Brander.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He stood with his hand on the knob; he had another quick appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nafter Tuesday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham had passed half round the room with the glide that\r\nlooked languid but that was really a remarkable form of activity, and\r\nhad given a transforming touch, on sofa and chairs, to three or four\r\ncrushed cushions. It was all with the hanging head of a broken lily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re to stay till the twelfth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I AM kicked out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as a broken lily that she considered it. \xe2\x80\x9cThen go to the\r\nMangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy thought! And shall I write?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother raised a little more a window-blind. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelicious mummy!\xe2\x80\x9d And Harold blew her a kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, rather\xe2\x80\x9d--she corrected herself. \xe2\x80\x9cDo write--from Brander. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsort of thing for the Mangers. Or even wire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you duck!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd from where\r\nwill YOU let them have it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Pewbury,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied without wincing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write on Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, Duchess?\xe2\x80\x9d--and Harold, before he disappeared,\r\ngreeted with a rapid concentration of all the shades of familiarity a\r\nlarge high lady, the visitor he had announced, who rose in the doorway\r\nwith the manner of a person used to arriving on thresholds very much as\r\npeople arrive at stations--with the expectation of being \xe2\x80\x9cmet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye. He\xe2\x80\x99s off,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham, who had remained quite on her own\r\nside of the room, explained to her friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s he off to?\xe2\x80\x9d this friend enquired with a casual advance and a\r\nlook not so much at her hostess as at the cushions just rearranged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh to some places. To Brander to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow he does run about!\xe2\x80\x9d And the Duchess, still with a glance hither\r\nand yon, sank upon the sofa to which she had made her way unaided. Mrs.\r\nBrookenham knew perfectly the meaning of this glance: she had but three\r\nor four comparatively good pieces, whereas the Duchess, rich with the\r\nspoils of Italy, had but three or four comparatively bad. This was\r\nthe relation, as between intimate friends, that the Duchess visibly\r\npreferred, and it was quite groundless, in Buckingham Crescent, ever to\r\nenter the drawing-room with an expression suspicious of disloyalty. The\r\nDuchess was a woman who so cultivated her passions that she would have\r\nregarded it as disloyal to introduce there a new piece of furniture in\r\nan underhand way--that is without a full appeal to herself, the highest\r\nauthority, and the consequent bestowal of opportunity to nip the mistake\r\nin the bud. Mrs. Brookenham had repeatedly asked herself where in the\r\nworld she might have found the money to be disloyal. The Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstandard was of a height--! It matched for that matter her other\r\nelements, which were wontedly conspicuous as usual as she sat there\r\nsuggestive of early tea. She always suggested tea before the hour, and\r\nher friend always, but with so different a wistfulness, rang for it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s to be at Brander?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea--he didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. But they\xe2\x80\x99ve always a lot\r\nof people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know--extraordinary mixtures. Has he been there before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham thought. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--if I remember--more than once. In\r\nfact her note--which he showed me, but which only mentioned \xe2\x80\x98some\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x99--was a sort of appeal on the ground of something or other that\r\nhad happened the last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess dealt with it. \xe2\x80\x9cShe writes the most extraordinary notes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this was nice, I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham said--\xe2\x80\x9cfrom a woman of\r\nher age and her immense position to so young a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the Duchess reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, she\xe2\x80\x99s not an American and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot on the stage. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t those what you call positions in this country?\r\nAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s also not a hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but Harold\xe2\x80\x99s a mere baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want for nurses!\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess replied. She\r\nsmiled at her hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cYour children are like their mother--they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\neternally young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99M not a hundred!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Mrs. Brookenham as if she wished with\r\ndim perversity she were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one\xe2\x80\x99s at any rate awfully kind to Harold.\xe2\x80\x9d She waited a moment to\r\ngive her visitor the chance to pronounce that eminently natural, but no\r\npronouncement came--nothing but the footman who had answered her ring\r\nand of whom she ordered tea. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did you say YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE going?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nenquired after this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Easter?\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess achieved a direct encounter with her charming\r\neyes--which was not in general an easy feat. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say I was going\r\nanywhere. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t of a sudden changed my habits. You know whether I\r\nleave my child--except in the sense of having left her an hour ago at\r\nMr. Garlick\xe2\x80\x99s class in Modern Light Literature. I confess I\xe2\x80\x99m a little\r\nnervous about the subjects and am going for her at five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then where do you take her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome to her tea. Where should you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham declined, in connexion with the matter, any\r\nresponsibility of thought; she did indeed much better by saying after a\r\nmoment: \xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE devoted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Merriman has her afternoon--I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what they do with\r\ntheir afternoons,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s to be back in the\r\nschool-room at seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have Aggie till then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re off for Easter\r\nto--where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham had received with no flush of betrayal the various\r\ndiscriminations thus conveyed by her visitor, and her only revenge for\r\nthe moment was to look as sweetly resigned as if she really saw what was\r\nin them. Where were they going for Easter? She had to think an instant,\r\nbut she brought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cOh to Pewbury--we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged so long that\r\nI had forgotten. We go once a year--one does it for Edward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you spoil him!\xe2\x80\x9d smiled the Duchess. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s to be there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the usual thing, I suppose. A lot of my lord\xe2\x80\x99s tiresome supporters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo pay his debt? Then why are you poor things asked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham looked, on this, quite adorably--that is most\r\nwonderingly--grave. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know, my dear Jane, why in the world we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\never asked anywhere? Fancy people wanting Edward!\xe2\x80\x9d she exhaled with\r\nstupefaction. \xe2\x80\x9cYet we can never get off Pewbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re better for getting on, cara mia, than for getting off!\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nDuchess blandly returned. She was a person of no small presence, filling\r\nher place, however, without ponderosity, with a massiveness indeed\r\nrather artfully kept in bounds. Her head, her chin, her shoulders were\r\nwell aloft, but she had not abandoned the cultivation of a \xe2\x80\x9cfigure\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\nany of the distinctively finer reasons for passing as a handsome woman.\r\nShe was secretly at war moreover, in this endeavour, with a lurking no\r\nless than with a public foe, and thoroughly aware that if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook well she might at times only, and quite dreadfully, look good.\r\nThere were definite ways of escape, none of which she neglected and from\r\nthe total of which, as she flattered herself, the air of distinction\r\nalmost mathematically resulted. This air corresponded superficially with\r\nher acquired Calabrian sonorities, from her voluminous title down, but\r\nthe colourless hair, the passionless forehead, the mild cheek and\r\nlong lip of the British matron, the type that had set its trap for her\r\nearlier than any other, were elements difficult to deal with and were\r\nat moments all a sharp observer saw. The battle-ground then was the\r\nhaunting danger of the bourgeois. She gave Mrs. Brookenham no time to\r\nresent her last note before enquiring if Nanda were to accompany the\r\ncouple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy mercy, no--she\xe2\x80\x99s not asked.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham, on Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s behalf,\r\nfairly radiated obscurity. \xe2\x80\x9cMy children don\xe2\x80\x99t go where they\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nasked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never said they did, love,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess returned. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what then do\r\nyou do with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean socially\xe2\x80\x9d--Mrs. Brookenham looked as if there might be\r\nin some distant sphere, for which she almost yearned, a maternal\r\nopportunity very different from that--\xe2\x80\x9cif you mean socially, I don\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nanything at all. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never pretended to do anything. You know as well\r\nas I do, dear Jane, that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t begun yet.\xe2\x80\x9d Jane\xe2\x80\x99s hostess now spoke\r\nas simply as an earnest anxious child. She gave a vague patient sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose I must begin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess remained for a little rather grimly silent. \xe2\x80\x9cHow old is\r\nshe--twenty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brookenham with distilled sweetness. Then with no\r\ntransition of tone: \xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone for a few days to Tishy Grendon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe stays with her to-night in Hill Street. They go down together\r\nto-morrow. Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Aggie been?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham went on.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess handsomely stared. \xe2\x80\x9cBeen where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy here, to see Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere?\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess echoed, fairly looking again about the room. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nis Nanda ever here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve given her a room of her own--the sweetest little room\r\nin the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham never looked so comparatively hopeful as\r\nwhen obliged to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has everything there a girl can want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear woman,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9chas she sometimes her own mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men had now come in to place the tea-table, and it was the movements\r\nof the red-haired footman that Mrs. Brookenham followed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better\r\nask my child herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was frank and jovial. \xe2\x80\x9cI would, I promise you, if I could\r\nget at her! But isn\xe2\x80\x99t that woman always with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham smoothed the little embroidered tea-cloth. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call\r\nTishy Grendon a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the Duchess had one of her pauses, which were indeed so frequent\r\nin her talks with this intimate that an auditor could sometimes wonder\r\nwhat particular form of relief they represented. They might have been a\r\nhabit proceeding from the fear of undue impatience. If the Duchess had\r\nbeen as impatient with Mrs. Brookenham as she would possibly have seemed\r\nwithout them her frequent visits in the face of irritation would have\r\nhad to be accounted for. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do YOU call her?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s best friend--if not her only one. That\xe2\x80\x99s the place I SHOULD\r\nhave liked for Aggie,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham ever so graciously smiled.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess hereupon, going beyond her, gave way to free mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndear thing, you\xe2\x80\x99re delightful. Aggie OR Tishy is a sweet thought. Since\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re so good as to ask why Aggie has fallen off you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my\r\ntelling you that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just named the reason. You\xe2\x80\x99ve known ever since\r\nwe came to England what I feel about the proper persons--and the most\r\nimproper--for her to meet. The Tishy Grendons are not a bit the proper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham continued to assist a little in the preparations for\r\ntea. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not say at once, Jane\xe2\x80\x9d--and her tone, in its appeal, was\r\nalmost infantine--\xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ve come at last to placing even poor Nanda,\r\nfor Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful purpose, in the same impossible class?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess took her time, but at last she accepted her duty. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if\r\nyou will have it. You know my ideas. If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my notion of the way to\r\nbring up a girl to give her up, in extreme youth, to an intimacy with a\r\nyoung married woman who\xe2\x80\x99s both unhappy and silly, whose conversation has\r\nabsolutely no limits, who says everything that comes into her head and\r\ntalks to the poor child about God only knows what--if I should never\r\ndream of such an arrangement for my niece I can almost as little face\r\nthe prospect of throwing her MUCH, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? with any young\r\nperson exposed to such an association. It would be in the natural order\r\ncertainly\xe2\x80\x9d--in spite of which natural order the Duchess made the point\r\nwith but moderate emphasis--\xe2\x80\x9cthat, since dear Edward is my cousin, Aggie\r\nshould see at least as much of Nanda as of any other girl of their age.\r\nBut what will you have? I must recognise the predicament I\xe2\x80\x99m placed in\r\nby the more and more extraordinary development of English manners.\r\nMany things have altered, goodness knows, since I was Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s age, but\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x99s so different as what you all do with your girls. It\xe2\x80\x99s all a\r\nmuddle, a compromise, a monstrosity, like everything else you produce;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in it that goes on all-fours. _I_ see but one consistent\r\nway, which is our fine old foreign way and which makes--in the upper\r\nclasses, mind you, for it\xe2\x80\x99s with them only I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned--des femmes\r\nbien gracieuses. I allude to the immemorial custom of my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrace, which was good enough for his mother and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s mother, for\r\nAggie\xe2\x80\x99s own, for his other sisters, for toutes ces dames. It would have\r\nbeen good enough for my child, as I call her--my dear husband called her\r\nHIS--if, not losing her parents, she had remained in her own country.\r\nShe would have been brought up there under an anxious eye--that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ngreat point; privately, carefully, tenderly, and with what she was NOT\r\nto learn--till the proper time--looked after quite as much as the\r\nrest. I can only go on with her in that spirit and make of her, under\r\nProvidence, what I consider any young person of her condition, of her\r\nname, of her particular traditions, should be. Voila, ma chere. Should\r\nyou put it to me whether I think you\xe2\x80\x99re surrounding Nanda with any such\r\nsecurity as that--well, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to help it if I offended you\r\nby an honest answer. What it comes to, simply stated, is that really she\r\nmust choose between Aggie and Tishy. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I should shock you were\r\nI to tell you what I should think of myself for packing MY child, all\r\nalone, off for a week with Mrs. Grendon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham, who had many talents, had none perhaps that she oftener\r\nfound useful than that of listening with the appearance of being fairly\r\nhypnotised. It was the way she listened to her housekeeper at their\r\nregular morning conference, and if the rejoinder ensuing upon it\r\nfrequently appeared to have nothing to do with her manner this was a\r\npuzzle for her interlocutor alone. \xe2\x80\x9cOh of course I know your theory,\r\ndear Jane, and I dare say it\xe2\x80\x99s very charming and old-fashioned and, if\r\nyou like, aristocratic, in a frowsy foolish old way--though even upon\r\nthat, at the same time, there would be something too to be said. But I\r\ncan only congratulate you on finding it more workable than there can be\r\nany question of MY finding it. If you\xe2\x80\x99re all armed for the sacrifices\r\nyou speak of I simply am not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m quite a monster, but\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be a saint. I\xe2\x80\x99m an English wife and an English\r\nmother--I live in the mixed English world. My daughter, at any rate,\r\nis just my daughter, I thank my stars, and one of a good English bunch:\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s not the unique niece of my dead Italian husband, nor doubtless\r\neither, in spite of her excellent birth, of a lineage, like Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s, so\r\nvery tremendous. I\xe2\x80\x99ve my life to lead and she\xe2\x80\x99s a part of it. Sugar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she wound up on a still softer note as she handed the cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! Well, with ME\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess with spirit, \xe2\x80\x9cshe would be all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98All\xe2\x80\x99 is soon said! Life is composed of many things,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham\r\ngently rang out--\xe2\x80\x9cof such mingled intertwisted strands!\xe2\x80\x9d Then still with\r\nthe silver bell, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you really think Tishy nice?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think little girls should live with little girls and young femmes du\r\nmonde so immensely initiated should--well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess with a\r\ntoss of her head, \xe2\x80\x9clet them alone. What do they want of them \xe2\x80\x98at all at\r\nall\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, if Tishy strikes you as \xe2\x80\x98initiated\xe2\x80\x99 all one can ask is\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Initiated into what?\xe2\x80\x99 I should as soon think of applying such a term\r\nto a little shivering shorn lamb. Is it your theory,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham\r\npursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our unfortunate unmarried daughters are to have no\r\nintelligent friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunate indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely BECAUSE they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nunmarried, and unmarried, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying so, a good deal\r\nbecause they\xe2\x80\x99re unmarriageable. Men, after all, the nice ones--by which\r\nI mean the possible ones--are not on the lookout for little brides whose\r\nusual associates are so up to snuff. It\xe2\x80\x99s not their idea that the girls\r\nthey marry shall already have been pitchforked--by talk and contacts and\r\nvisits and newspapers and by the way the poor creatures rush about and\r\nall the extraordinary things they do--quite into EVERYTHING. A girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmost intelligent friend is her mother--or the relative acting as such.\r\nPerhaps you consider that Tishy takes your place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham waited so long to say what she considered that before\r\nshe next spoke the question appeared to have dropped. Then she\r\nonly replied as if suddenly remembering her manners: \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you eat\r\nsomething?\xe2\x80\x9d She indicated a particular plate. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the nice little\r\nround ones?\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess appropriated a nice little round one and her\r\nhostess presently went on: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget--don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet us eat them ALL. I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re what Lord Petherton really comes\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess finished her mouthful imperturbably before she took this up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he come so often?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham might have been, for judicious candour, the Muse of\r\nHistory. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he calls it; but he said yesterday that he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome today. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had tea earlier for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on with her most\r\nmelancholy kindness--\xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99s always late. But we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t, between us,\r\nlick the platter clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess entered very sufficiently into her companion\xe2\x80\x99s tone. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel at all obliged to consider him, for he has not of late\r\nparticularly put himself out for me. He has not been to see me since I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know when, and the last time he did come he brought Mr. Mitchett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it was the other way round. It was Mr. Mitchett, the other year,\r\nwho first brought Lord Petherton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9chad first brought Mr. Mitchett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham, meeting her friend\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, looked for an instant as if\r\ntrying to recall. \xe2\x80\x9cI give it up. I muddle beginnings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you only MAKE them,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d To which Mrs. Brookenham added: \xe2\x80\x9cDid he bring Mr.\r\nMitchett for Aggie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he did they\xe2\x80\x99ll have been disappointed. Neither of them has seen, in\r\nmy house, the tip of her nose.\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess announced it with a pomp of\r\npride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but with your ideas that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrevent what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy what I suppose you call the pourparlers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s hand? My dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you do me the\r\njustice of feeling that I\xe2\x80\x99m a person to take time by the forelock. It\r\nwas not, as you seem to remember, with the sight of Mr. Mitchett that\r\nthe question of Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s hand began to occupy me. I should be ashamed of\r\nmyself if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t constantly before me and if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t my feelers\r\nout in more quarters than one. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve not so much as thought of\r\nMr. Mitchett--who, rich as he may be, is the son of a shoemaker and\r\nsuperlatively hideous--for a reason I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all mind telling you.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be outraged if I say that I\xe2\x80\x99ve for a long time hoped you yourself\r\nwould find the right use for him.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused--at present with a\r\nmomentary failure of assurance, from which she rallied, however, to\r\nproceed with a burst of earnestness that was fairly noble. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me\r\nif I just tell you once for all how it strikes me, I\xe2\x80\x99m stupefied at your\r\nnot seeming to recognise either your interest or your duty. Oh I\r\nknow you want to, but you appear to me--in your perfect good faith of\r\ncourse--utterly at sea. They\xe2\x80\x99re one and the same thing, don\xe2\x80\x99t you make\r\nout? your interest and your duty. Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t it convincingly plain to you\r\nthat the thing to do with Nanda is just to marry her--and to marry her\r\nsoon? That\xe2\x80\x99s the great thing--do it while you CAN. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nher downstairs--at which, let me say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least wonder--your\r\nremedy is to take the right alternative. Don\xe2\x80\x99t send her to Tishy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend her to Mr. Mitchett?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham unresentfully quavered. Her\r\ncolour, during her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s address had distinctly risen, but there was\r\nno irritation in her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know, Jane, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nher downstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess looked at her with an audacity confirmed by the absence\r\nfrom her face of everything but the plaintive. \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are, with your\r\neternal English false positions! J\xe2\x80\x99aime, moi, les situations nettes--je\r\nrien comprends pas d\xe2\x80\x99autres. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be to your honour--to that of\r\nyour delicacy--that with your impossible house you SHOULD wish to plant\r\nyour girl in your drawing-room. But such a way of keeping her out of it\r\nas throwing her into a worse--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Jane, you do say things to me!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham blandly broke\r\nin. She had sunk back into her chair; her hands, in her lap pressed\r\nthemselves together and her wan smile brought a tear into each of her\r\neyes by the very effort to be brighter. It might have been guessed of\r\nher that she hated to seem to care, but that she had other dislikes too.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf one were to take up, you know, some of the things you say--!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nshe positively sighed for the wealth of amusement at them of which her\r\ntears were the sign. Her friend could quite match her indifference.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my child, TAKE them up; if you were to do that with them\r\ncandidly, one by one, you would do really very much what I should like\r\nto bring you to. Do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s failure to repudiate the\r\nvision appeared to suffice, and her visitor cheerfully took a further\r\njump. \xe2\x80\x9cAs much of Tishy as she wants--AFTER. But not before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--say after Mr. Mitchett. Mr. Mitchett won\xe2\x80\x99t take her after Mrs.\r\nGrendon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are your grounds for assuming that he\xe2\x80\x99ll take her at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then as the Duchess hung fire a moment: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got it by chance from\r\nLord Petherton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the two women met for a little on this, and there might have\r\nbeen a consequence of it in the manner of what came. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got it from\r\nnot being a fool. Men, I repeat, like the girls they marry--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I already know your old song! The way they like the girls they\r\nDON\xe2\x80\x99T marry seems to be,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham mused, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat more immediately\r\nconcerns us. You had better wait till you HAVE made Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s fortune\r\nperhaps--to be so sure of the working of your system. Pardon me,\r\ndarling, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t take you for an example until you\xe2\x80\x99ve a little more\r\nsuccessfully become one. I know what the sort of men worth speaking of\r\nare not looking for. They ARE looking for smart safe sensible English\r\ngirls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess glanced at the clock. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Vanderbank looking for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion appeared to oblige her by anxiously thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, HE, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid, poor dear--for nothing at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess had taken off a glove to appease her appetite, and now,\r\ndrawing it on, she smoothed it down. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he has his ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same as yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, more like them than like yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh perhaps then--for he and I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brookenham, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t agree, I\r\nfeel, on two things in the world. So you think poor Mitchy,\xe2\x80\x9d she went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x99s the son of a shoemaker and who might be the grandson of a\r\ngrasshopper, good enough for my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess appreciated for a moment the superior fit of her glove. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlook facts in the face. It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing for Aggie.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she\r\ngrew easy to extravagance. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you giving her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Brookenham took without wincing whatever, as between a\r\nmasterful relative and an exposed frivolity, might have been the sting\r\nof it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat you must ask Edward. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are again--the virtuous English mother! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle fortune in an old stocking and I count it over every night. If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve no old stocking for Nanda there are worse fates than shoemakers\r\nand grasshoppers. Even WITH one, you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all say that I\r\nshould sniff at poor Mitchy. We must take what we can get and I shall be\r\nthe first to take it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have everything for ninepence.\xe2\x80\x9d And the\r\nDuchess got up--shining, however, with a confessed light of fantasy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to him, my dear--speak to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean offer him my child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed at the intonation. \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are once more--vous autres! If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re shocked at the idea you place drolement your delicacy. I\xe2\x80\x99d offer\r\nmine to the son of a chimney-sweep if the principal guarantees were\r\nthere. Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s charming--you don\xe2\x80\x99t do her justice. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say Mr.\r\nMitchett\xe2\x80\x99s either beautiful or noble, and he certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t as much\r\ndistinction as would cover the point of a pin. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind moreover\r\nwhat he says--the lengths he sometimes goes to!--but that,\xe2\x80\x9d added the\r\nDuchess with decision, \xe2\x80\x9cis no doubt much a matter of how he finds you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake it. And after marriage what does it signify? He has forty\r\nthousand a year, an excellent idea of how to take care of it and a good\r\ndisposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham sat still; she only looked up at her friend. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it by\r\nLord Petherton that you know of his excellent idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess showed she was challenged, but also that she made\r\nallowances. \xe2\x80\x9cI go by my impression. But Lord Petherton HAS spoken for\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brookenham--\xe2\x80\x9csince he wholly lives on\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Petherton--on Mr. Mitchett?\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess stared, but rather in\r\namusement than in horror. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he a--property?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe loveliest. Mr. Mitchett\xe2\x80\x99s his property. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you KNOW?\xe2\x80\x9d There was\r\nan artless wail in Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know--still a stranger as I\xe2\x80\x99m often rather happy to feel\r\nmyself here and choosing my friends and picking my steps very much, I\r\ncan assure you--how should I know about all your social scandals and\r\nthings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh we don\xe2\x80\x99t call THAT a social scandal!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham inimitably\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you should wish to you\xe2\x80\x99d have the way I tell you of to stop\r\nit. Divert the stream of Mr. Mitchett\xe2\x80\x99s wealth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty for every one!\xe2\x80\x9d--Mrs. Brookenham kept up her tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s always giving us things--bonbons and dinners and opera-boxes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has never given ME any,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess contentedly declared.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham waited a little. \xe2\x80\x9cLord Petherton has the giving of some.\r\nHe has never in his life before, I imagine, made so many presents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame one has nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d On which before reaching the\r\ndoor, the Duchess changed the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say I never bring Aggie. If\r\nyou like I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring her back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve picked her up. It will be something to do with her till\r\nMiss Merriman can take her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelighted, dearest; do bring her. And I think she should SEE Mr.\r\nMitchett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I find him here too then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh take the chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two women, on this, exchanged, tacitly and across the room--the\r\nDuchess at the door, which a servant had arrived to open for her, and\r\nMrs. Brookenham still at her tea-table--a further stroke of intercourse,\r\nover which the latter was not on this occasion the first to lower her\r\nlids. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve shown high scruples,\xe2\x80\x9d the departing guest said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nI understand then that I\xe2\x80\x99m free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree as air, dear Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood.\xe2\x80\x9d Then just as she was off, \xe2\x80\x9cAh dear old Edward!\xe2\x80\x9d the guest\r\nexclaimed. Her kinsman, as she was fond of calling him, had reached the\r\ntop of the staircase, and Mrs. Brookenham, by the fire, heard them meet\r\non the landing--heard also the Duchess protest against his turning to\r\nsee her down. Mrs. Brookenham, listening to them, hoped Edward would\r\naccept the protest and think it sufficient to leave her with the\r\nfootman. Their common consciousness that she was a kind of cousin, a\r\nconsciousness not devoid of satisfaction, was quite consistent with a\r\nview, early arrived at, of the absurdity of any fuss about her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Brookenham appeared his wife was prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s coming back for\r\nLord Petherton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he simply said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something between them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he merely repeated. And it would have taken many such sounds on\r\nhis part to represent a spirit of response discernible to any one but\r\nhis mate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been things before,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t felt sure.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know how one has sometimes a flash?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be said of Edward Brookenham, who seemed to bend for sitting\r\ndown more hinges than most men, that he looked as if he knew either this\r\nor anything else. He had a pale cold face, marked and made regular, made\r\neven in a manner handsome, by a hardness of line in which, oddly,\r\nthere was no significance, no accent. Clean-shaven, slightly bald, with\r\nunlighted grey eyes and a mouth that gave the impression of not working\r\neasily, he suggested a stippled drawing by an inferior master. Lean\r\nmoreover and stiff, and with the air of having here and there in his\r\nperson a bone or two more than his share, he had once or twice, at\r\nfancy-balls, been thought striking in a dress copied from one of\r\nHolbein\xe2\x80\x99s English portraits. But when once some such meaning as that had\r\nbeen put into him it took a long time to put another, a longer time than\r\neven his extreme exposure or anybody\xe2\x80\x99s study of the problem had yet made\r\npossible. If anything particular had finally been expected from him it\r\nmight have been a summary or an explanation of the things he had always\r\nnot said; but there was something in him that had long since pacified\r\nall impatience, drugged all curiosity. He had never in his life answered\r\nsuch a question as his wife had just put him and which she would\r\nnot have put had she feared a reply. So dry and decent and even\r\ndistinguished did he look, as if he had positively been created to\r\nmeet a propriety and match some other piece, that lady, with her famous\r\nperceptions, would no more have appealed to him seriously on a\r\ngeneral proposition than she would, for such a response, have rung the\r\ndrawing-room bell. He was none the less held to have a great promiscuous\r\nwisdom. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that\xe2\x80\x99s between them?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s between any woman and the man she\xe2\x80\x99s making up to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy there may often be nothing. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she even particularly\r\nknew him,\xe2\x80\x9d Brookenham added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what she would like to prevent any one\xe2\x80\x99s knowing, and her\r\ncoming here to be with him when she knows I know SHE knows--don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee?--that he\xe2\x80\x99s to be here, is just one of those calculations that ARE\r\nsubtle enough to put off the scent a woman who has but half a\r\nnose.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham as she spoke appeared to attest by the pretty\r\nstar-gazing way she thrust it into the air her own possession of the\r\ntotality of such a feature. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet quite what I think, but\r\none wakes up to such things soon enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s her idea that he\xe2\x80\x99ll marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d Brookenham asked in\r\nhis colourless way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Edward!\xe2\x80\x9d his wife murmured for all answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if she can see him in other places why should she want to see him\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d Edward persisted in a voice destitute of expression.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham now had plenty of that. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean if she can see him\r\nin his own house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo cream, please,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband said. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t she a house too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but so pervaded all over by Aggie and Miss Merriman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Brookenham commented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has always been some man--I\xe2\x80\x99ve always known there has. And now\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s Petherton,\xe2\x80\x9d said his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where\xe2\x80\x99s the attraction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn HIM? Why lots of women could tell you. Petherton has had a career.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I mean in old Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I dare say lots of men could tell you. She\xe2\x80\x99s no older than any\r\none else. She has also such great elements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I dare say she\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Brookenham returned as if his interest\r\nin the case had dropped. You might have felt you got a little nearer to\r\nhim on guessing that in so peopled a circle satiety was never far from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean for instance she has such a grand idea of duty. She thinks we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnowhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith our children--with our home life. She\xe2\x80\x99s awfully down on Tishy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTishy?\xe2\x80\x9d--Edward appeared for a moment at a loss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTishy Grendon--and her craze for Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she a craze for Nanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely I told you Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s to be with her for Easter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you did,\xe2\x80\x9d he bethought himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything\r\nabout a craze. And where\xe2\x80\x99s Harold?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s at Brander. That is he will be by dinner. He has just gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how does he get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy by the South-Western. They\xe2\x80\x99ll send to meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrookenham appeared for a moment to view this statement in the dry light\r\nof experience. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll only send if there are others too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course then there\xe2\x80\x99ll be others--lots. The more the better for\r\nHarold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis young man\xe2\x80\x99s father was silent a little. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps--if they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nplay high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, \xe2\x80\x9chowever Harold plays he has a way of winning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a way too of being a hopeless ass. What I meant was how he comes\r\nthere at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Edward explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy as any one comes--by being invited. She wrote to him--weeks ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrookenham just traceably took this in, but to what profit was not\r\ncalculable. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Harold? Very good-natured.\xe2\x80\x9d He had another short\r\nreflexion, after which he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIf they don\xe2\x80\x99t send he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in for\r\nfive miles in a fly--and the man will see that he gets his money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey WILL send--after her note.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid it say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer melancholy eyes seemed, from afar, to run over the page. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember--but it was so cordial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he meditated. \xe2\x80\x9cThat often doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent one\xe2\x80\x99s being let in for\r\nten shillings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was more gloom in this forecast than his wife had desired to\r\nproduce. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear Edward, what do you want me to do? Whatever a\r\nyoung man does, it seems to me, he\xe2\x80\x99s let in for ten shillings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but he needn\xe2\x80\x99t be--that\xe2\x80\x99s my point. _I_ wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at his age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold\xe2\x80\x99s mother took up her book again. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you weren\xe2\x80\x99t the same\r\nsuccess! I mean at such places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t borrow money to make me one--as I\xe2\x80\x99ve a sharp idea our\r\nyoung scamp does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom whom do you mean--the Jews?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her as if her vagueness might be assumed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. They, I take\r\nit, are not quite so cordial to him, since you call it so, as the old\r\nladies. He gets it from Mitchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brookenham. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you very sure?\xe2\x80\x9d she then demanded.\r\n\r\nHe had got up and put his empty cup back on the tea-table, wandering\r\nafterwards a little about the room and looking out, as his wife had done\r\nhalf an hour before, at the dreary rain and the now duskier ugliness. He\r\nreverted in this attitude, with a complete unconsciousness of making for\r\nirritation, to an issue they might be supposed to have dropped. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave a lovely drive for his money!\xe2\x80\x9d His companion, however, said nothing\r\nand he presently came round again. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not absolutely sure--of his\r\nhaving had it from Mitchy. If I were I should do something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d She put it as if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly imagine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d speak to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Harold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--that might just put it into his head.\xe2\x80\x9d Brookenham walked up\r\nand down a little with his hands in his pockets, after which, with\r\na complete concealment of the steps of the transition, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we\r\ndining to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d he brought out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere, thank heaven. We grace our own board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--with those fellows, as you said, and Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not for dinner. The Baggers and Mary Pinthorpe and--upon my word\r\nI forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see when she comes,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Brookenham, who was again at the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a she--it\xe2\x80\x99s two or three he\xe2\x80\x99s, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife replied\r\nwith her indifferent anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what dinner it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nbethought herself; \xe2\x80\x9cit may be the one that\xe2\x80\x99s after Easter. Then that\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s this one,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with her eyes once more on her book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s a relief to dine at home\xe2\x80\x9d--and Brookenham faced about.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind finding out?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with some abruptness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean who\xe2\x80\x99s to dine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. But whether Mitchy HAS come down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only find out by asking him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh _I_ could ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed disappointed at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s want of\r\nresource.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked coldly, from before the fire, over the prettiness of her brown\r\nbent head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be such a beastly bore if he admits it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you think poor I can make him not admit it?\xe2\x80\x9d She put the question\r\nas if it were really her own thought too, but they were a couple who\r\ncould, even face to face and unlike the augurs behind the altar, think\r\nthese things without laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he SHOULD admit it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham\r\nthrew in, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you give me the money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo pay Mitchy back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had now raised her eyes to her husband, but, turning away, he failed\r\nto meet them. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll deny it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if they all deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a simple\r\nenough matter. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to come down on us! But\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d she almost prattled on, \xe2\x80\x9cof having so many such\r\ncharming friends. They DON\xe2\x80\x99T come down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis again was a remark of a sweep that there appeared to be nothing in\r\nBrookenham\xe2\x80\x99s mind to match; so that, scarcely pausing in the walk he had\r\nresumed, he only said: \xe2\x80\x9cWho do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98all\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy if he has had anything from Mitchy I dare say he has had something\r\nfrom Van.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Brookenham returned as if with a still deeper drop of interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared; \xe2\x80\x9cthey ought to tell us, and when\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t it serves them right.\xe2\x80\x9d Even this observation, however, failed\r\nto rouse in her husband a response, and, as she had quite formed the\r\nhabit of doing, she philosophically answered herself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuppose they do it on spec.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was less apparent than ever what Edward supposed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Van hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmoney to chuck about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I only mean a sovereign here and there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Brookenham threw out after another turn, \xe2\x80\x9cI think Van, you know,\r\nis your affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ALL seems to be my affair!\xe2\x80\x9d she lamented too woefully to have other\r\nthan a comic effect. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course then it will be still more so if he\r\nshould begin to apply to Mr. Longdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must stop that in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean by warning Mr. Longdon and requesting him immediately to\r\ntell us? That won\xe2\x80\x99t be very pleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham noted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then wait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited only a minute--it might have appeared she already saw. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant him to be kind to Harold and can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking he will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I fancy that that will be his notion of it--keeping him from\r\nmaking debts. I dare say one needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble about him,\xe2\x80\x9d Brookenham\r\nadded. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can take care of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe appears to have done so pretty well all these years,\xe2\x80\x9d she mused. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nI saw him in my childhood I see him now, and I see now that I saw\r\nthen even how awfully in love he was with mamma. He\xe2\x80\x99s too lovely about\r\nmamma,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham pursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d her husband replied.\r\n\r\nThe vivid past held her a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI see now I must have known a lot as\r\na child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d her companion repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want him to take an interest in us. Above all in the children. He\r\nought to like us\xe2\x80\x9d--she followed it up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a sort of \xe2\x80\x98poetic\r\njustice.\xe2\x80\x99 He sees the reasons for himself and we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She turned the possibilities over, but they produced a reserve. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nthing is I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how he CAN like Harold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he won\xe2\x80\x99t lend him money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brookenham with all his grimness.\r\n\r\nThis contingency too she considered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou make me feel as if I wished he\r\nwould--which is too dreadful. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he really likes ME!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d her husband again ejaculated. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean not utterly REALLY. He has\r\nto try to. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference,\xe2\x80\x9d she next remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nmean his trying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I mean his not succeeding. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d She saw it\r\nsteadily and saw it whole. \xe2\x80\x9cOn account of mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrookenham also, with his perfect propriety, put it before himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwill he--on account of your mother--also like ME?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe weighed it. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Edward.\xe2\x80\x9d She covered him with her loveliest\r\nexpression. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not really either. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n This time she had pulled him up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like Harold or like you or like me?\xe2\x80\x9d Edward clearly\r\nfound himself able to accept only the premise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be perfectly loyal. It will be the advantage of mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBrookenham cried. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma, Edward,\xe2\x80\x9d she brought out with a flash of\r\nsolemnity--\xe2\x80\x9cmamma WAS wonderful. There have been times when I\xe2\x80\x99ve always\r\nfelt her still with us, but Mr. Longdon makes it somehow so real.\r\nWhether she\xe2\x80\x99s with me or not, at any rate, she\xe2\x80\x99s with HIM; so that when\r\nHE\xe2\x80\x99S with me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes to the same thing?\xe2\x80\x9d her husband intelligently asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI see.\r\nAnd when was he with you last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot since the day he dined--but that was only last week. He\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nsoon--I know from Van.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does Van know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh all sorts of things. He has taken the greatest fancy to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old boy--to Van?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVan to Mr. Longdon. And the other way too. Mr. Longdon has been most\r\nkind to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrookenham still moved about. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he likes Van and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nUS, what good will that do us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d understand soon enough if you felt Van\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the things you expect me to feel, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d Edward Brookenham\r\nlightly moaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. But he IS as loyal to me as Mr. Longdon to\r\nmamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe statement produced on his part an unusual vision of the comedy\r\nof things. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery Jenny has her Jockey!\xe2\x80\x9d Yet perhaps--remarkably\r\nenough--there was even more imagination in his next words. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\r\nsort of means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon? Oh very good. Mamma wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been the loser. Not that\r\nshe cared. He MUST like Nanda,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham wound up.\r\n\r\nHer companion appeared to look at the idea and then meet it. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nto see her first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he shall see her!\xe2\x80\x9d she rang out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time for her at any rate to\r\nsit downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was time, you know, _I_ thought, a year ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know what you thought. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had spoken with decision, but he seemed unwilling to concede the\r\npoint. \xe2\x80\x9cYou allowed yourself she was all ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSHE was all ready--yes. But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. I am now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham, with\r\na fine emphasis on her adverb, proclaimed as she turned to meet\r\nthe opening of the door and the appearance of the butler, whose\r\nannouncement--\xe2\x80\x9cLord Petherton and Mr. Mitchett\xe2\x80\x9d--might for an observer\r\nhave seemed immediately to offer support to her changed state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLord Petherton, a man of five-and-thirty, whose robust but symmetrical\r\nproportions gave to his dark blue double-breasted coat an air of\r\ntightness that just failed of compromising his tailor, had for his main\r\nfacial sign a certain pleasant brutality, the effect partly of a bold\r\nhandsome parade of carnivorous teeth, partly of an expression of nose\r\nsuggesting that this feature had paid a little, in the heat of youth,\r\nfor some aggression at the time admired and even publicly commemorated.\r\nHe would have been ugly, he substantively granted, had he not been\r\nhappy; he would have been dangerous had he not been warranted. Many\r\nthings doubtless performed for him this last service, but none so much\r\nas the delightful sound of his voice, the voice, as it were, of another\r\nman, a nature reclaimed, supercivilised, adjusted to the perpetual\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cchaff\xe2\x80\x9d which kept him smiling in a way that would have been a mistake\r\nand indeed an impossibility if he had really been witty. His bright\r\nfamiliarity was that of a young prince whose confidence had never had to\r\nfalter, and the only thing that at all qualified the resemblance was the\r\nequal familiarity excited in his subjects.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchett had so little intrinsic appearance that an observer would\r\nhave felt indebted for help in placing him to the rare prominence of\r\nhis colourless eyes and the positive attention drawn to his chin by the\r\nprecipitation of its retreat from discovery. Dressed on the other hand\r\nnot as gentlemen dress in London to pay their respects to the fair, he\r\nexcited by the exhibition of garments that had nothing in common save\r\nthe violence and the independence of their pattern a belief that in the\r\ndesperation of humility he wished to render public his having thrown to\r\nthe winds the effort to please. It was written all over him that he\r\nhad judged once for all his personal case and that, as his character,\r\nsuperficially disposed to gaiety, deprived him of the resource of\r\nshyness and shade, the effect of comedy might not escape him if secured\r\nby a real plunge. There was comedy therefore in the form of his pot-hat\r\nand the colour of his spotted shirt, in the systematic disagreement,\r\nabove all, of his coat, waistcoat and trousers. It was only on long\r\nacquaintance that his so many ingenious ways of showing he appreciated\r\nhis commonness could present him as secretly rare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s the child this time?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of his hostess as soon as he\r\nwas seated near her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say \xe2\x80\x98this time\xe2\x80\x99 as if it were different from any other\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied as she gave him his tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly because, as the months and the years elapse, it\xe2\x80\x99s more and more\r\nof a wonder, whenever I don\xe2\x80\x99t see her, to think what she does with\r\nherself--or what you do with her. What it does show, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nMitchett went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis that she takes no trouble to meet me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mitchy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brookenham, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do YOU know about\r\n\xe2\x80\x98trouble\xe2\x80\x99--either poor Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s or mine or anybody\xe2\x80\x99s else? You\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nhad to take any in your life, you\xe2\x80\x99re the spoiled child of fortune\r\nand you skim over the surface of things in a way that seems often to\r\nrepresent you as supposing everybody else has wings. Most other people\r\nare sticking fast in their native mud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMud, Mrs. Brook--mud, mud!\xe2\x80\x9d he protestingly cried as, while he watched\r\nhis fellow visitor move to a distance with their host, he glanced about\r\nthe room, taking in afresh the Louis Seize secretary which looked better\r\nclosed than open and for which he always had a knowing eye. \xe2\x80\x9cRemarkably\r\ncharming--mud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s what a great deal of the element really appears to-day to\r\nbe thought; and precisely as a specimen, Mitchy dear, those two French\r\nbooks you were so good as to send me and which--really this time, you\r\nextraordinary man!\xe2\x80\x9d She fell back, intimately reproachful, from the\r\neffect produced on her, renouncing all expression save that of the\r\nrolled eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, were they particularly dreadful?\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy was honestly surprised.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather liked the one in the pink cover--what\xe2\x80\x99s the confounded thing\r\ncalled?--I thought it had a sort of a something-or-other.\xe2\x80\x9d He had cast\r\nhis eye about as if for a glimpse of the forgotten title, and she caught\r\nthe question as he vaguely and good-humouredly dropped it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA kind of a morbid modernity? There IS that,\xe2\x80\x9d she dimly conceded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what they call it? Awfully good name. You must have got it from\r\nold Van!\xe2\x80\x9d he gaily declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I did. I get the good things from him and the bad ones from\r\nyou. But you\xe2\x80\x99re not to suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndiscussed your horrible book with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett protested; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you with books from\r\nVanderbank which if you HAVE discussed them with him--well,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have been there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen me with anything like yours--no, no, never, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She was particularly positive. \xe2\x80\x9cVan on the contrary gives tremendous\r\nwarnings, makes apologies, in advance, for things that--well, after all,\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t killed one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat have even perhaps a little, after the warnings, let one down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took no notice of this coarse pleasantry, she simply adhered to her\r\nthesis. \xe2\x80\x9cOne has taken one\xe2\x80\x99s dose and one isn\xe2\x80\x99t such a fool as to be\r\ndeaf to some fresh true note if it happens to turn up. But for abject\r\nhorrid unredeemed vileness from beginning to end--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you read to the end?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read to see what you could possibly have sent such things to me for,\r\nand because so long as they were in my hands they were not in the hands\r\nof others. Please to remember in future that the children are all over\r\nthe place and that Harold and Nanda have their nose in everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise to remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett returned, \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as you make old\r\nVan do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do make old Van--I pull old Van up much oftener than I succeed in\r\npulling you. I must say,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re all getting\r\nto require among you in general an amount of what one may call editing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She gave one of her droll universal sighs. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got your books at any\r\nrate locked up and I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d send for them quickly again; one\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nnervous about anything happening and their being perhaps found among\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s relics. Charming literary remains!\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed.\r\n\r\nThe friendly Mitchy was also much amused. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, the most awful\r\nthings ARE found! Have you heard about old Randage and what his\r\nexecutors have just come across? The most abominable--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to; but you give me\r\na shudder and I beg you\xe2\x80\x99ll have your offerings removed, since I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of confiding them for the purpose to any one in this house. I\r\nmight burn them up in the dead of night, but even then I should be\r\nfearfully nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send then my usual messenger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9ca person I keep\r\nfor such jobs, thoroughly seasoned, as you may imagine, and of a\r\ndiscretion--what do you call it?--a toute epreuve. Only you must let\r\nme say that I like your terror about Harold! Do you think he spends his\r\ntime over Dr. Watts\xe2\x80\x99s hymns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham just hesitated, and nothing, in general, was so becoming\r\nto her as the act of hesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Mitchy, do you know I want\r\nawfully to talk to you about Harold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout his French reading, Mrs. Brook?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy responded with interest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worse things are, let me just mention to you about that, the better\r\nthey seem positively to be for one\xe2\x80\x99s feeling up in the language. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmore difficult, the bad ones--and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in that. All the young\r\nmen know it--those who are going up for exams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had her eyes for a little on Lord Petherton and her husband; then\r\nas if she had not heard what her interlocutor had just said she overcame\r\nher last scruple. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Mitchy, has he had money from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared with his good goggle eyes--he laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth--?\r\nBut do you suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d tell you if he had?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really borrowed the most dreadful sums?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy was highly diverted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he? For what, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it--for what? What does he do with it all? What in the\r\nworld becomes of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy suggested, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s saving up to start a business. Harold\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nirreproachable--hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a vice. Who knows in these days what may happen?\r\nHe sees further than any young man I know. Do let him save.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked far away with her sweet world-weariness. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nan angel it would be a horror to be talking to you. But I insist on\r\nknowing.\xe2\x80\x9d She insisted now with her absurdly pathetic eyes on him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nkind of sums?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall never, never find out--not if you were never to speak to me\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett replied with extravagant firmness. \xe2\x80\x9cHarold\xe2\x80\x99s one of\r\nmy great amusements--I really have awfully few; and if you deprive me of\r\nhim you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a fiend. There are only one or two things I want to live\r\nfor, but one of them is to see how far Harold will go. Please give me\r\nsome more tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you positively swear?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with intensity as she helped him.\r\nThen without waiting for his answer: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have the common charity to US,\r\nI suppose, to see the position you\xe2\x80\x99d put us in. Fancy Edward!\xe2\x80\x9d she quite\r\nausterely threw off.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchett, at this, had on his side a wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Edward\r\nimagine--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man, Edward never \xe2\x80\x98imagined\xe2\x80\x99 anything in life.\xe2\x80\x9d She still had\r\nher eyes on him. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore if he SEES a thing, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? it must\r\nexist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy for a little fixed the person mentioned as he sat with his other\r\nguest, but whatever this person saw he failed just then to see his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s companion, whose eyes he never met. His face only offered itself\r\nafter the fashion of a clean domestic vessel, a receptacle with the\r\npeculiar property of constantly serving yet never filling, to Lord\r\nPetherton\xe2\x80\x99s talkative splash. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, only don\xe2\x80\x99t let him take it up.\r\nLet it be only between you and me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett pleaded; \xe2\x80\x9ckeep him\r\nquiet--don\xe2\x80\x99t let him speak to me.\xe2\x80\x9d He appeared to convey with his\r\npleasant extravagance that Edward looked dangerous, and he went on with\r\na rigour of levity: \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be OUR little quarrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were different ways of meeting such a tone, but Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchoice was remarkably prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I quite understand what\r\ndreadful joke you may be making, but I dare say if you HAD let Harold\r\nborrow you\xe2\x80\x99d have another manner, and I was at any rate determined to\r\nhave the question out with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us always have everything out--that\xe2\x80\x99s quite my own idea. It\xe2\x80\x99s you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mr. Mitchett, \xe2\x80\x9cwho are by no means always so frank with me as I\r\nrecognise--oh, I do THAT!--what it must have cost you to be over this\r\nlittle question of Harold. There\xe2\x80\x99s one thing, Mrs. Brook, you do dodge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I ever dodge, dear Mitchy?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook quite tenderly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, when I ask you about your other child you\xe2\x80\x99re off like a frightened\r\nfawn. When have you ever, on my doing so, said \xe2\x80\x98my darling Mitchy,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll ring for her to be asked to come down so that you can see her for\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x99--when have you ever said anything like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham mused; \xe2\x80\x9cyou think I sacrifice her. You\xe2\x80\x99re very\r\ninteresting among you all, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly a delightful circle. The\r\nDuchess has just been letting me have it most remarkably hot, and as\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s presently coming back you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to join forces with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy looked a little at a loss. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the subject of your sacrifice--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf my innocent and helpless, yet somehow at the same time, as a\r\nconsequence of my cynicism, dreadfully damaged and depraved daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She took in for an instant the slight bewilderment against which, as a\r\nresult of her speech, even so expert an intelligence as Mr. Mitchett\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhad not been proof; then with a small jerk of her head at the other side\r\nof the room made the quickest of transitions. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat IS there between her\r\nand him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy wondered at the other two. \xe2\x80\x9cBetween Edward and the girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense. Between Petherton and Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy could only stare, and the wide noonday light of his regard was at\r\nsuch moments really the redemption of his ugliness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat \xe2\x80\x98is\xe2\x80\x99 there? Is\r\nthere anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham appreciatively sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nrelation with him! You won\xe2\x80\x99t compromise him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be nicer of me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to want to compromise\r\nHER!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham dropped. \xe2\x80\x9cDOES he like her?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh it\xe2\x80\x99s just my knowing that constitutes the beauty of my loyalty--of\r\nmy delicacy.\xe2\x80\x9d He had his quick jumps too. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I never, never to see the\r\nchild?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis enquiry appeared only to confirm his friend in the view of what was\r\ntouching in him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the most delicate thing I know, and it crops up\r\nwith effect the oddest in the intervals of your corruption. Your talk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhalf the time impossible; you respect neither age nor sex nor condition;\r\none doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ll say or do next; and one has to return your\r\nbooks--c\xe2\x80\x99est tout dire--under cover of darkness. Yet there\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nmidst of all this and in the general abyss of you a little deepdown\r\ndelicious niceness, a sweet sensibility, that one has actually one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself, shocked as one perpetually is at you, quite to hold one\xe2\x80\x99s breath\r\nand stay one\xe2\x80\x99s hand for fear of ruffling or bruising. There\xe2\x80\x99s no one\r\nin talk with whom,\xe2\x80\x9d she balmily continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI find myself half so\r\noften suddenly moved to pull up short. You\xe2\x80\x99ve more little toes to tread\r\non--though you pretend you haven\xe2\x80\x99t: I mean morally speaking, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow?--than even I have myself, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve so many that I could wish most\r\nof them cut off. You never spare me a shock--no, you don\xe2\x80\x99t do that: it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t the form your delicacy takes. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll know what I mean, all the\r\nsame, I think, when I tell you that there are lots I spare YOU!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchett fairly glowed with the candour of his attention. \xe2\x80\x9cKnow what\r\nyou mean, dearest lady? How can a man handicapped to death, a man of\r\nmy origin, my appearance, my general weaknesses, drawbacks, immense\r\nindebtedness, all round, for the start, as it were, that I feel my\r\nfriends have been so good as to allow me: how can such a man not be\r\nconscious every moment that every one about him goes on tiptoe and winks\r\nat every one else? What CAN you all mention in my presence, poor things,\r\nthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t personal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s face covered him for an instant as no painted\r\nMadonna\xe2\x80\x99s had ever covered the little charge at the breast beneath it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the finest thing of all in you is your beautiful, beautiful pride!\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re prouder than all of us put together.\xe2\x80\x9d She checked a motion that\r\nhe had apparently meant as a protest--she went on with her muffled\r\nwisdom. \xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a man but YOU whom Petherton wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made\r\nvulgar. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t vulgar himself--at least not exceptionally; but he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust one of those people, a class one knows well, who are so fearfully,\r\nin this country, the cause of it in others. For all I know he\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ncause of it in me--the cause of it even in poor Edward. For I\xe2\x80\x99m vulgar,\r\nMitchy dear--very often; and the marvel of you is that you never are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for everything. Thank you above all for \xe2\x80\x98marvel\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy\r\ngrinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know what I say!\xe2\x80\x9d--she didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least blush. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nsomething,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued with the same gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll promise\r\nto tell no one on earth. If you\xe2\x80\x99re proud I\xe2\x80\x99m not. There! It\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\nextraordinary and I try to conceal it even to myself; but there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndoubt whatever about it--I\xe2\x80\x99m not proud pour deux sous. And some day, on\r\nsome awful occasion, I shall show it. So--I notify you. Shall you love\r\nme still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the bitter end,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy loyally responded. \xe2\x80\x9cFor how CAN, how need,\r\na woman be \xe2\x80\x98proud\xe2\x80\x99 who\xe2\x80\x99s so preternaturally clever? Pride\xe2\x80\x99s only for use\r\nwhen wit breaks down--it\xe2\x80\x99s the train the cyclist takes when his tire\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeflated. When that happens to YOUR tire, Mrs. Brook, you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me\r\nknow. And you do make me wonder just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntaking such particular precautions and throwing out such a cloud of\r\nskirmishers. If you want to shoot me dead a single bullet will do.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nfaltered but an instant before completing his sense. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere you really\r\nwant to come out is at the fact that Nanda loathes me and that I might\r\nas well give up asking for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite serious?\xe2\x80\x9d his companion after a moment resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nreally and truly like her, Mitchy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like her as much as I dare to--as much as a man can like a girl when\r\nfrom the very first of his seeing her and judging her he has also seen,\r\nand seen with all the reasons, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance for him whatever.\r\nOf course, with all that, he has done his best not to let himself go.\r\nBut there are moments,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett ruefully added, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it would\r\nrelieve him awfully to feel free for a good spin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you exaggerate,\xe2\x80\x9d his hostess replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthe difficulties in your\r\nway. What do you mean by all the \xe2\x80\x98reasons\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy one of them I\xe2\x80\x99ve already mentioned. I make her flesh creep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own Mitchy!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham protestingly moaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other is that--very naturally--she\xe2\x80\x99s in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith whom under the sun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham had, with her startled stare, met his eyes long enough\r\nto have taken something from him before he next spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really have never suspected? With whom conceivably but old Van?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNanda\xe2\x80\x99s in love with old Van?\xe2\x80\x9d--the degree to which she had never\r\nsuspected was scarce to be expressed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy he\xe2\x80\x99s twice her age--he has\r\nseen her in a pinafore with a dirty face and well slapped for it: he has\r\nnever thought of her in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can a person of your acuteness, my dear woman,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmention such trifles as having the least to do with the case? How\r\ncan you possibly have such a fellow about, so beastly good-looking, so\r\ninfernally well turned out in the way of \xe2\x80\x98culture,\xe2\x80\x99 and so bringing them\r\ndown in short on every side, and expect in the bosom of your family the\r\nabsence of history of the reigns of the good kings? If YOU were a girl\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t YOU turn purple? If I were a girl shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I--unless, as is\r\nmore likely, I turned green?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham was deeply affected. \xe2\x80\x9cNanda does turn purple--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe loveliest shade you ever saw. It\xe2\x80\x99s too absurd that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnoticed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s amiability that, with her\r\nsudden sense of the importance of this new light, she should be quite\r\nready to abase herself. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many things in one\xe2\x80\x99s life. One\r\nfollows false scents. One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make out everything at once. If you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nright you must help me. We must see more of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what good will that do me?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy appealed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you care enough for her to want to help HER?\xe2\x80\x9d Then before\r\nhe could speak, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little darling dear!\xe2\x80\x9d his hostess tenderly\r\nejaculated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she think or dream? Truly she\xe2\x80\x99s laying up\r\ntreasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he likes her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe likes her in fact extremely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean he has told you so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no--we never mention it! But he likes her,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett stubbornly\r\nrepeated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s thoroughly straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham for a moment turned these things over; after which she\r\ncame out in a manner that visibly surprised him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if you\r\nwished to be nasty about him, is it?--because I know you like him\r\nyourself. You\xe2\x80\x99re so wonderful to your friends\xe2\x80\x9d--oh she could let him\r\nsee that she knew!--\xe2\x80\x9cand in such different and exquisite ways. There are\r\nthose like HIM\xe2\x80\x9d--she signified her other visitor--\xe2\x80\x9cwho get everything\r\nout of you and whom you really appear fond of, or at least to put up\r\nwith, just FOR that. Then there are those who ask nothing--and whom\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re fond of in spite of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy leaned back from this, fist within fist, watching her with\r\na certain disguised emotion. He grinned almost too much for mere\r\namusement. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the class to which YOU belong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the best one,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m careful to remain in it. You\r\ntry to get us, by bribery, into the inferior place, because, proud as\r\nyou are, it bores you a little that you like us so much. But we won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo--at least I won\xe2\x80\x99t. You may make Van,\xe2\x80\x9d she wonderfully continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for him or give him.\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy admired\r\nher from his position, slowly shaking his head with it. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nman--with no fortune and just as he is, to the smallest particular--whom\r\nyou would have liked to be, whom you intensely envy, and yet to whom\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re magnanimous enough for almost any sacrifice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation had fairly deepened to a flush. \xe2\x80\x9cMagnificent,\r\nmagnificent Mrs. Brook! What ARE you in thunder up to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, as I say,\xe2\x80\x9d she imperturbably went on, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not to do him an\r\nill turn that you make a point of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve just told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchett for a minute gave no sign but his high colour and his queer\r\nglare. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could it do him an ill turn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it WOULD be a way, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? to put before me the need of\r\ngetting rid of him. For he may \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99 Nanda as much as you please: he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever, never,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham resolutely quavered--\xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll never come to\r\nthe scratch. And to feel that as _I_ do,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, \xe2\x80\x9ccan only be,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you also see? to want to save her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would have appeared at last that poor Mitchy did see. \xe2\x80\x9cBy taking it\r\nin time? By forbidding him the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed to stand with little nipping scissors in a garden of\r\nalternatives. \xe2\x80\x9cOr by shipping HER off. Will you help me to save her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she broke out again after a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t true,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat she has any aversion to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you charged her with it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy demanded with a courage that\r\namounted to high gallantry.\r\n\r\nIt inspired on the spot his interlocutress, and her own pluck, of as\r\nfine a quality now as her diplomacy, which was saying much, fell but\r\nlittle below. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear friend--frankly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Then I know what she said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe absolutely denied it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--they always do, because they pity me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nsaid what they always say--that the effect I produce is, though at first\r\nupsetting, one that little by little they find it possible to get used\r\nto. The world\xe2\x80\x99s full of people who are getting used to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ shall never do, for you\xe2\x80\x99re quite too great a luxury!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mrs. Brookenham declared. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I haven\xe2\x80\x99t threshed you out really MORE\r\nwith Nanda,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit has been from a scruple of a sort you\r\npeople never do a woman the justice to impute. You\xe2\x80\x99re the object of\r\nviews that have so much more to set them off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchett on this jumped up; he was clearly conscious of his nerves;\r\nhe fidgeted away a few steps and then, his hands in his pockets, fixed\r\non his hostess a countenance more controlled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does the Duchess\r\nmean by your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s being--as I understood you to quote her just\r\nnow--\xe2\x80\x98damaged and depraved\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham came up--she literally rose--smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou fit the cap.\r\nYou know how she\xe2\x80\x99d like you for little Aggie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she mean, what does she mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy repeated.\r\n\r\nThe door, as he spoke, was thrown open; Mrs. Brookenham glanced round.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve the chance to find out from herself!\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess had come back\r\nand little Aggie was in her wake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThat young lady, in this relation, was certainly a figure to have\r\noffered a foundation for the highest hopes. As slight and white, as\r\ndelicately lovely, as a gathered garden lily, her admirable training\r\nappeared to hold her out to them all as with precautionary finger-tips.\r\nShe presumed, however, so little on any introduction that, shyly and\r\nsubmissively, waiting for the word of direction, she stopped short\r\nin the centre of the general friendliness till Mrs. Brookenham fairly\r\nbecame, to meet her, also a shy little girl--put out a timid hand with\r\nwonder-struck innocent eyes that hesitated whether a kiss of greeting\r\nmight be dared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy you dear good strange \xe2\x80\x98ickle\xe2\x80\x99 thing, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen here for ages, but it IS a joy to see you and I do hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbrought your doll!\xe2\x80\x9d--such might have been the sense of our friend\xe2\x80\x99s fond\r\nmurmur while, looking at her up and down with pure pleasure, she drew\r\nthe rare creature to a sofa. Little Aggie presented, up and down, an\r\narrangement of dress exactly in the key of her age, her complexion, her\r\nemphasised virginity. She might have been prepared for her visit by\r\na cluster of doting nuns, cloistered daughters of ancient houses and\r\neducators of similar products, whose taste, hereditarily good, had\r\ngrown, out of the world and most delightfully, so queer as to leave on\r\neverything they touched a particular shade of distinction. The Duchess\r\nhad brought in with the child an air of added confidence for which an\r\nobserver would in a moment have seen the grounds, the association of the\r\npair being so markedly favourable to each. Its younger member carried\r\nout the style of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s presence quite as one of the accessory\r\nfigures effectively thrown into old portraits. The Duchess on the other\r\nhand seemed, with becoming blandness, to draw from her niece the dignity\r\nof a kind of office of state--hereditary governess of the children of\r\nthe blood. Little Aggie had a smile as softly bright as a Southern dawn,\r\nand the friends of her relative looked at each other, according to a\r\nfashion frequent in Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room, in free exchange of\r\ntheir happy impression. Mr. Mitchett was none the less scantly diverted\r\nfrom his estimate of the occasion Mrs. Brookenham had just named to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d he promptly asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you mind explaining to me an\r\nopinion I\xe2\x80\x99ve just heard of your--with marked originality--holding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess, her head all in the air, considered an instant her little\r\nivory princess. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always ready, Mr. Mitchett, to defend my opinions;\r\nbut if it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of going much into the things that are the\r\nsubjects of some of them perhaps we had better, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\r\nchoose our time and our place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo \xe2\x80\x98time,\xe2\x80\x99 gracious lady, for my impatience,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccould be better than the present--but if you\xe2\x80\x99ve reasons for wanting a\r\nbetter place why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we go on the spot into another room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Petherton, at this enquiry, broke into instant mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, of all\r\nthe coolness, Mitchy!--he does go at it, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Mrs. Brook? What\r\ndo you want to do in another room?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded of his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my\r\nword, Duchess, under the nose of those--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess, on the first blush, lent herself to the humour of the case.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Petherton, of \xe2\x80\x98those\xe2\x80\x99?--I defy him to finish his sentence!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsmiled to the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf those,\xe2\x80\x9d said his lordship, \xe2\x80\x9cwho flatter themselves that when you do\r\nhappen to find them somewhere your first idea is not quite to jump at\r\na pretext for getting off somewhere else. Especially,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued to\r\njest, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a man of Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s vile reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Edward Brookenham exclaimed at this, but only as with quiet\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s offer is perfectly safe, I may let him know,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife\r\nremarked, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I happen to be sure that nothing would really induce Jane\r\nto leave Aggie five minutes among us here without remaining herself to\r\nsee that we don\xe2\x80\x99t become improper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then if we\xe2\x80\x99re already pretty far on the way to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Petherton\r\nresumed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat on earth MIGHT we arrive at in the absence of your\r\ncontrol? I warn you, Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d he joyously pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you go out\r\nof the room with Mitchy I shall rapidly become quite awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess during this brief passage never took her eyes from her\r\nniece, who rewarded her attention with the sweetness of consenting\r\ndependence. The child\xe2\x80\x99s foreign origin was so delicately but\r\nunmistakeably written in all her exquisite lines that her look might\r\nhave expressed the modest detachment of a person to whom the language\r\nof her companions was unknown. Her protectress then glanced round the\r\ncircle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very odd people all of you, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you quite\r\nknow how ridiculous you are. Aggie and I are simple stranger-folk;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal we don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, yet we\xe2\x80\x99re none the less not\r\neasily frightened. In what is it, Mr. Mitchett,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve wounded your susceptibilities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchett cast about; he had apparently found time to reflect on his\r\nprecipitation. \xe2\x80\x9cI see what Petherton\xe2\x80\x99s up to, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t, by drawing\r\nyou aside just now, expose your niece to anything that might immediately\r\noblige Mrs. Brook to catch her up and flee with her. But the first\r\ntime I find you more isolated--well,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, though not with the\r\nclearest ring, \xe2\x80\x9call I can say is Mind your eyes dear Duchess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about your thinking, Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham placidly explained,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Nanda suffers--in her morals, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?--by my neglect.\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about you that I can\xe2\x80\x99t bravely say TO you;\r\ntherefore since he has plumped out with it I do confess that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nappealed to him on what, as so good an old friend, HE thinks of your\r\ncontention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world IS Jane\xe2\x80\x99s contention?\xe2\x80\x9d Edward Brookenham put the\r\nquestion as if they were \xe2\x80\x9cstuck\xe2\x80\x9d at cards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really all of you,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess replied with excellent coolness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cchoose extraordinary conditions for the discussion of delicate matters.\r\nThere are decidedly too many things on which we don\xe2\x80\x99t feel alike. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall inconceivable just now. Je ne peux pourtant pas la mettre a la\r\nporte, cette cherie\xe2\x80\x9d--whom she covered again with the gay solicitude\r\nthat seemed to have in it a vibration of private entreaty: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand, my own darling--don\xe2\x80\x99t understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Aggie looked about with an impartial politeness that, as\r\nan expression of the general blind sense of her being as to every\r\nparticular in hands at full liberty either to spot or to spare her, was\r\ntouching enough to bring tears to all eyes. It perhaps had to do with\r\nthe sudden emotion with which--using now quite a different manner--Mrs.\r\nBrookenham again embraced her, and even with this lady\xe2\x80\x99s equally abrupt\r\nand altogether wonderful address to her: \xe2\x80\x9cBetween you and me straight,\r\nmy dear, and as from friend to friend, I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll never doubt that\r\neverything must be all right!--What I spoke of to poor Mitchy,\xe2\x80\x9d she went\r\non to the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cis the dreadful view you take of my letting Nanda go\r\nto Tishy--and indeed of the general question of any acquaintance between\r\nyoung unmarried and young married females. Mr. Mitchett\xe2\x80\x99s sufficiently\r\ninterested in us, Jane, to make it natural of me to take him into our\r\nconfidence in one of our difficulties. On the other hand we feel your\r\nsolicitude, and I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you at this time of day what weight\r\nin every respect we attach to your judgement. Therefore it WILL be a\r\ndifficulty for us, cara mia, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? if we decide suddenly,\r\nunder the spell of your influence, that our daughter must break off a\r\nfriendship--it WILL be a difficulty for us to put the thing to Nanda\r\nherself in such a way as that she shall have some sort of notion of what\r\nsuddenly possesses us. Then there\xe2\x80\x99ll be the much stiffer job of putting\r\nit to poor Tishy. Yet if her house IS an impossible place what else is\r\none to do? Carrie Donner\xe2\x80\x99s to be there, and Carrie Donner\xe2\x80\x99s a nature\r\napart; but how can we ask even a little lamb like Tishy to give up her\r\nown sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question had been launched with an argumentative sharpness that\r\nmade it for a moment keep possession of the air, and during this moment,\r\nbefore a single member of the circle could rally, Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neffect was superseded by that of the reappearance of the butler. \xe2\x80\x9cI say,\r\nmy dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t shriek!\xe2\x80\x9d--Edward Brookenham had only time to sound this\r\nwarning before a lady, presenting herself in the open doorway, followed\r\nclose on the announcement of her name. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Beach Donner!\xe2\x80\x9d--the\r\nimpression was naturally marked. Every one betrayed it a little but\r\nMrs. Brookenham, who, more than the others, appeared to have the help\r\nof seeing that by a merciful stroke her visitor had just failed to hear.\r\nThis visitor, a young woman of striking, of startling appearance, who,\r\nin the manner of certain shiny house-doors and railings, instantly\r\ncreated a presumption of the lurking label \xe2\x80\x9cFresh paint,\xe2\x80\x9d found herself,\r\nwith an embarrassment oddly opposed to the positive pitch of her\r\ncomplexion, in the presence of a group in which it was yet immediately\r\nevident that every one was a friend. Every one, to show no one had been\r\ncaught, said something extremely easy; so that it was after a moment\r\nonly poor Mrs. Donner who, seated close to her hostess, seemed to be\r\nin any degree in the wrong. This moreover was essentially her fault, so\r\nextreme was the anomaly of her having, without the means to back it\r\nup, committed herself to a \xe2\x80\x9cscheme of colour\xe2\x80\x9d that was practically an\r\nadvertisement of courage. Irregularly pretty and painfully shy, she was\r\nretouched from brow to chin like a suburban photograph--the moral of\r\nwhich was simply that she should either have left more to nature or\r\ntaken more from art. The Duchess had quickly reached her kinsman with a\r\nsmothered hiss, an \xe2\x80\x9cEdward dear, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake take Aggie!\xe2\x80\x9d and at the\r\nend of a few minutes had formed for herself in one of Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmirable \xe2\x80\x9ccorners\xe2\x80\x9d a society consisting of Lord Petherton and Mr.\r\nMitchett, the latter of whom regarded Mrs. Donner across the room with\r\narticulate wonder and compassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right--she\xe2\x80\x99s frightened only at herself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess watched her as from a box at the play, comfortably shut\r\nin, as in the old operatic days at Naples, with a pair of entertainers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the most interesting nation in the world. One never gets to the\r\nend of your hatred of the nuance. The sense of the suitable, the harmony\r\nof parts--what on earth were you doomed to do that, to be punished\r\nsufficiently in advance, you had to be deprived of it in your very\r\ncradles? Look at her little black dress--rather good, but not so good\r\nas it ought to be, and, mixed up with all the rest, see her type, her\r\nbeauty, her timidity, her wickedness, her notoriety and her impudeur.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s only in this country that a woman is both so shocking and so\r\nshaky.\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure overflowed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nto be good--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her at least know how to be bad? Ah,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy replied, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nirritation testifies more than anything else could do to our peculiar\r\ngenius or our peculiar want of it. Our vice is intolerably clumsy--if it\r\ncan possibly be a question of vice in regard to that charming child, who\r\nlooks like one of the new-fashioned bill-posters, only, in the way of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98morbid modernity,\xe2\x80\x99 as Mrs. Brook would say, more extravagant and funny\r\nthan any that have yet been risked. I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nBrook\xe2\x80\x99s having spoken of her to me lately as \xe2\x80\x98wild.\xe2\x80\x99 Wild?--why, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsimply tameness run to seed. Such an expression shows the state of\r\ntraining to which Mrs. Brook has reduced the rest of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent at any rate, Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s training, some of the rest\r\nof you from being horrible,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess declared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you mean\r\njust now, really, by asking me to explain before Aggie this so serious\r\nmatter of Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s exposure?\xe2\x80\x9d Then instantly taking herself up before Mr.\r\nMitchett could answer: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth do you suppose Edward\xe2\x80\x99s saying to\r\nmy darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrookenham had placed himself, side by side with the child, on a distant\r\nlittle settee, but it was impossible to make out from the countenance of\r\neither if a sound had passed between them. Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s little manner was too\r\ndeveloped to show, and her host\xe2\x80\x99s not developed enough. \xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99s awfully\r\ncareful,\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Petherton reassuringly observed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you or I or\r\nMitchy say anything bad it\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be before we know it and without\r\nparticularly meaning it. But old Edward means it--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much that as a general thing he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to say it?\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty picture of him, inasmuch as for the most part he\r\nnever speaks. What therefore must he mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an abyss--he\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\na man of an understanding more profound, and he\xe2\x80\x99s equally incapable of\r\nuttering and of wincing. If by the same token I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x98horrible,\xe2\x80\x99 as you\r\ncall me,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s only because I\xe2\x80\x99m in everyway so beastly\r\nsuperficial. All the same I do sometimes go into things, and I insist\r\non knowing,\xe2\x80\x9d he again broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it exactly was you had in mind in\r\nsaying to Mrs. Brook the things about Nanda and myself that she repeated\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou \xe2\x80\x98insist,\xe2\x80\x99 you silly man?\xe2\x80\x9d--the Duchess had veered a little to\r\nindulgence. \xe2\x80\x9cPray on what ground of right, in such a connexion, do you\r\ndo anything of the sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mitchy showed but for a moment that he felt pulled up. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean\r\nthat when a girl liked by a fellow likes him so little in return--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat may provoke you to\r\nsuppose me vulgar and odious enough to try to put you out of conceit of\r\na most interesting and unfortunate creature; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite as yet\r\nsee--though I dare say I shall soon make out!--what our friend has\r\nin her head in tattling to you on these matters as soon as my back\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nturned. Petherton will tell you--I wonder he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told you before--why\r\nMrs. Grendon, though not perhaps herself quite the rose, is decidedly in\r\nthese days too near it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Petherton never tells me anything!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s answer was brisk and\r\nimpatient, but evidently quite as sincere as if the person alluded to\r\nhad not been there.\r\n\r\nThe person alluded to meanwhile, fidgeting frankly in his chair,\r\nalternately stretching his legs and resting his elbows on his knees,\r\nhad reckoned as small the profit he might derive from this colloquy. His\r\nbored state indeed--if he was bored--prompted in him the honest impulse\r\nto clear, as he would have perhaps considered it, the atmosphere. He\r\nindicated Mrs. Donner with a remarkable absence of precautions.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what the Duchess alludes to is my poor sister Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s stupid\r\ngrievance--surely you know about that.\xe2\x80\x9d He made oddly vivid for a moment\r\nthe nature of his relative\xe2\x80\x99s allegation, his somewhat cynical treatment\r\nof which became peculiarly derisive in the light of the attitude\r\nand expression, at that minute, of the figure incriminated. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nbrother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s too thick with her. But Cashmore\xe2\x80\x99s such a fine old ass.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s excessively unpleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cfor affairs are just in that\r\nposition in which, from one day to another, there may be something that\r\npeople will get hold of. Fancy a man,\xe2\x80\x9d he robustly reflected while\r\nthe three took in more completely the subject of Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention--\xe2\x80\x9cfancy a man with THAT odd piece on his hands! The beauty of\r\nit is that the two women seem never to have broken off. Blest if they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t still keep seeing each other!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess, as on everything else, passed succinctly on this. \xe2\x80\x9cAh how\r\ncan hatreds comfortably flourish without the nourishment of such regular\r\n\xe2\x80\x98seeing\xe2\x80\x99 as what you call here bosom friendship alone supplies? What are\r\nparties given for in London but--that enemies may meet? I grant you it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninconceivable that the husband of a superb creature like your sister\r\nshould find his requirements better met by an object comme cette petite,\r\nwho looks like a pen-wiper--an actress\xe2\x80\x99s idea of one--made up for a\r\ntheatrical bazaar. At the same time, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me to say so, it\r\nscarcely strikes one that your sister\xe2\x80\x99s prudence is such as to have\r\nplaced all the cards in her hands. She\xe2\x80\x99s the most beautiful woman in\r\nEngland, but her esprit de conduite isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite on a level. One can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave everything!\xe2\x80\x9d she philosophically sighed.\r\n\r\nLord Petherton met her comfortably enough on this assumption of his\r\ndetachments. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean by that her being the biggest fool alive I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nquite ready to agree with you. It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what makes me afraid. Yet\r\nhow can I decently say in especial,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cof what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess still perched on her critical height. \xe2\x80\x9cOf what but one of\r\nyour amazing English periodical public washings of dirty linen? There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot the least necessity to \xe2\x80\x98say\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s anything\r\nmore remarkable than these purifications it\xe2\x80\x99s the domestic comfort with\r\nwhich, when all has come and gone, you sport the articles purified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes back, in all that sphere,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett instructively opined,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto our national, our fatal want of style. We can never, dear Duchess,\r\ntake too many lessons, and there\xe2\x80\x99s probably at the present time no more\r\nuseful function to be performed among us than that dissemination of\r\nneater methods to which you\xe2\x80\x99re so good as to contribute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had had another idea, but before he reached it his companion had\r\ngaily broken in. \xe2\x80\x9cAwfully good one for you, Duchess--and I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to\r\nsay that, for a clever woman, you exposed yourself! I\xe2\x80\x99ve at any rate a\r\nsense of comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Petherton pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cin the good relations\r\nnow more and more established between poor Fanny and Mrs. Brook. Mrs.\r\nBrook\xe2\x80\x99s awfully kind to her and awfully sharp, and Fanny will take\r\nthings from her that she won\xe2\x80\x99t take from me. I keep saying to Mrs.\r\nBrook--don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?--\xe2\x80\x98Do keep hold of her and let her have it\r\nstrong.\xe2\x80\x99 She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, upon my honour, any one in the world but me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we know the extent of THAT resource!\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess freely commented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Fanny says--that SHE knows it,\xe2\x80\x9d Petherton\r\ngood-humouredly agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says my beastly hypocrisy makes her sick.\r\nThere are people,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleasantly rambled on, \xe2\x80\x9cwho are awfully free with\r\ntheir advice, but it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly fearful rot. Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s isn\xe2\x80\x99t, upon my\r\nword--I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried some myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk as if it were something nasty and homemade--gooseberry wine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the Duchess laughed; \xe2\x80\x9cbut one can\xe2\x80\x99t know the dear soul, of course,\r\nwithout knowing that she has set up, for the convenience of her friends,\r\na little office for consultations. She listens to the case, she strokes\r\nher chin and prescribes--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the beauty of it is,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lord Petherton, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she makes no\r\ncharge whatever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take a guinea at the time, but you may still get your\r\naccount,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess returned. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we know that the great\r\nbusiness she does is in husbands and wives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis then seems the day of the wives!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett interposed as he\r\nbecame aware, the first, of the illustration the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s image was in\r\nthe act of receiving. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Fanny Cashmore!\xe2\x80\x9d--the butler was already\r\nin the field, and the company, with the exception of Mrs. Donner, who\r\nremained seated, was apparently conscious of a vibration that brought it\r\nafresh, but still more nimbly than on Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s advent, to its feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to her straight--be nice to her: you must have plenty to say. YOU\r\nstay with me--we have our affair.\xe2\x80\x9d The latter of these commands the\r\nDuchess addressed to Mr. Mitchett, while their companion, in obedience\r\nto the former and affected, as it seemed, by an unrepressed familiar\r\naccent that stirred a fresh flicker of Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s grin, met the new\r\narrival in the middle of the room before Mrs. Brookenham had had time\r\nto reach her. The Duchess, quickly reseated, watched an instant the\r\ninexpressive concussion of the tall brother and sister; then while\r\nMitchy again subsided into his place, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not, as a race,\r\nclever, you\xe2\x80\x99re not delicate, you\xe2\x80\x99re not sane, but you\xe2\x80\x99re capable of\r\nextraordinary good looks,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cVous avez parfois la grande\r\nbeaute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy was much amused. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think Petherton has?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess withstood it. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got, both outside and in, the same\r\ngreat general things, only turned, in each, rather different ways, a\r\nway safer for him as a man, and more triumphant for her as--whatever you\r\nchoose to call her! What CAN a woman do,\xe2\x80\x9d she richly mused, \xe2\x80\x9cwith such\r\nbeauty as that--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept come desperately to advise with Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy undertook to\r\ncomplete her question--\xe2\x80\x9cas to the highest use to make of it? But see,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he immediately added, \xe2\x80\x9chow perfectly competent to instruct her our\r\nfriend now looks.\xe2\x80\x9d Their hostess had advanced to Lady Fanny with an\r\noutstretched hand but with an eagerness of greeting merged a little\r\nin the sweet predominance of wonder as well as in the habit, at such\r\nmoments most perceptible, of the languid lily-bend. Nothing in general\r\ncould have been less conventionally poor than the kind of reception\r\ngiven in Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room to the particular element--the\r\nelement of physical splendour void of those disparities that make the\r\nquestion of others tiresome--comprised in Lady Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s presence. It\r\nwas a place in which, at all times, before interesting objects, the\r\nunanimous occupants, almost more concerned for each other\xe2\x80\x99s vibrations\r\nthan for anything else, were apt rather more to exchange sharp and\r\nsilent searchings than to fix their eyes on the object itself. In the\r\ncase of Lady Fanny, however, the object itself--and quite by the same\r\nlaw that had worked, though less profoundly, on the entrance of little\r\nAggie--superseded the usual rapt communion very much in the manner of\r\nsome beautiful tame tigress who might really coerce attention. There\r\nwas in Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s way of looking up at her a dim despairing\r\nabandonment of the idea of any common personal ground. Lady Fanny,\r\nmagnificent, simple, stupid, had almost the stature of her brother,\r\na forehead unsurpassably low and an air of sombre concentration just\r\nsufficiently corrected by something in her movements that failed to give\r\nit a point. Her blue eyes were heavy in spite of being perhaps a couple\r\nof shades too clear, and the wealth of her black hair, the disposition\r\nof the massive coils of which was all her own, had possibly a satin\r\nsheen depreciated by the current fashion. But the great thing in her\r\nwas that she was, with unconscious heroism, thoroughly herself; and\r\nwhat were Mrs. Brook and Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s intimates after all, in their free\r\nsurrender to the play of perception, but a happy association for keeping\r\nher so? The Duchess was moved to the liveliest admiration by the grand\r\nsimple sweetness of her encounter with Mrs. Donner, a combination indeed\r\nin which it was a question if she or Mrs. Brook appeared to the higher\r\nadvantage. It was poor Mrs. Donner--not, like Mrs. Brook, subtle in\r\nsufficiency, nor, like Lady Fanny, almost too simple--who made the\r\npoorest show. The Duchess immediately marked it to Mitchy as infinitely\r\ncharacteristic that their hostess, instead of letting one of her\r\nvisitors go, kept them together by some sweet ingenuity and while Lord\r\nPetherton, dropping his sister, joined Edward and Aggie in the other\r\nangle, sat there between them as if, in pursuance of some awfully clever\r\nline of her own, she were holding a hand of each. Mr. Mitchett of course\r\ndid justice all round, or at least, as would have seemed from an enquiry\r\nhe presently made, wished not to fail of it. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it your real impression\r\nthen that Lady Fanny has serious grounds--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor jealousy of that preposterous little person? My dear Mitchett,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nDuchess resumed after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflexion, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99re so rash as to\r\nask me in any of these connexions for my \xe2\x80\x98real\xe2\x80\x99 impression you deserve\r\nwhatever you may get.\xe2\x80\x9d The penalty Mitchy had incurred was apparently\r\ngrave enough to make his companion just falter in the infliction of it;\r\nwhich gave him the opportunity of replying that the little person\r\nwas perhaps not more preposterous than any one else, that there was\r\nsomething in her he rather liked, and that there were many different\r\nways in which a woman could be interesting. This further levity it was\r\ntherefore that laid him fully open. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen living with Petherton so long without becoming aware that he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshockingly worried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cPetherton carries his worries with a\r\nbravery! They\xe2\x80\x99re so many that I\xe2\x80\x99ve long since ceased to count them; and\r\nin general I\xe2\x80\x99ve been disposed to let those pass that I can\xe2\x80\x99t help him to\r\nmeet. YOU\xe2\x80\x99VE made, I judge,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9ca better use of opportunities\r\nperhaps not so good--such as at any rate enables you to see further than\r\nI into the meaning of the impatience he just now expressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was admirable, in conversation, for neglecting everything\r\nnot essential to her present plausibility. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman like Lady Fanny can\r\nhave no \xe2\x80\x98grounds\xe2\x80\x99 for anything--for any indignation, I mean, or for any\r\nrevenge worth twopence. In this particular case at all events they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen sacrificed with such extravagance that, as an injured wife, she\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t had the gumption to keep back an inch or two to stand on. She can\r\ndo absolutely nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you take the view--?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy, who had, after all, his delicacies,\r\npulled up as at sight of a name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take the view,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know exactly why. Elle se\r\nles passe--her little fancies! She\xe2\x80\x99s a phenomenon, poor dear. And all\r\nwith--what shall I call it?--the absence of haunting remorse of a good\r\nhouse-mother who makes the family accounts balance. She looks--and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat they love her for here when they say \xe2\x80\x98Watch her now!\xe2\x80\x99--like an\r\nangry saint; but she\xe2\x80\x99s neither a saint nor, to be perfectly fair to her,\r\nreally angry at all. She has only just enough reflexion to make out that\r\nit may some day be a little better for her that her husband shall, on\r\nhis side too, have committed himself; and she\xe2\x80\x99s only, in secret, too\r\npleased to be sure whom it has been with. All the same I must tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the Duchess still more crisply added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our little friend Nanda is\r\nof the opinion--which I gather her to be quite ready to defend--that\r\nLady Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mitchy found himself staring. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what has our little friend Nanda\r\nto do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat indeed, bless her heart? If you WILL ask questions, however, you\r\nmust take, as I say, your risks. There are days when between you all you\r\nstupefy me. One of them was when I happened about a month ago to make\r\nsome allusion to the charming example of Mr. Cashmore\xe2\x80\x99s fine taste that\r\nwe have there before us: what was my surprise at the tone taken by Mrs.\r\nBrook to deny on this little lady\xe2\x80\x99s behalf the soft impeachment? It\r\nwas quite a mistake that anything had happened--Mrs. Donner had pulled\r\nthrough unscathed. She had been but a day or two at the most in danger,\r\nfor her family and friends--the best influences--had rallied to her\r\nsupport: the flurry was all over. She was now perfectly safe. Do you\r\nthink she looks so?\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess asked.\r\n\r\nThis was not a point that Mitchy was conscious of freedom of mind to\r\nexamine. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I understand you that Nanda was her mother\xe2\x80\x99s authority--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the exact shade of the intimacy of the two friends and the state of\r\nMrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s information? Precisely--it was \xe2\x80\x98the latest before going to\r\npress.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Our own correspondent\xe2\x80\x99! Her mother quoted her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchett visibly wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how should Nanda know--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything about the matter? How should she NOT know everything? You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnot, I suppose, lost sight of the fact that this lady and Mrs. Grendon\r\nare sisters. Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s situation and Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s perils are naturally very\r\npresent to the extremely unoccupied Tishy, who is unhappily married into\r\nthe bargain, who has no children, and whose house, as you may imagine,\r\nhas a good thick atmosphere of partisanship. So, as with Nanda, on HER\r\nside, there\xe2\x80\x99s no more absorbing interest than her dear friend Tishy,\r\nwith whom she\xe2\x80\x99s at present staying and under whose roof she perpetually\r\nmeets this victim of unjust aspersions--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see the whole thing from here, you imply?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mitchett, under the\r\ninfluence of this rapid evocation, had already taken his line. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said bravely, \xe2\x80\x9cNanda\xe2\x80\x99s not a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA momentary silence on the part of the Duchess might have been her\r\ntribute to his courage. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with her, as it happens,\r\nhere; but that there are matters as to which she\xe2\x80\x99s not in general at\r\nall befogged is exactly the worst I ever said of her. And I hold that in\r\nputting it so--on the basis of my little anecdote--you clearly give out\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99re answered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cAnswered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the quarrel that a while back you sought to pick with me. What I\r\ntouched on to her mother was the peculiar range of aspects and interests\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s compelled to cultivate by the special intimacies that Mrs. Brook\r\npermits her. There they are--and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I said. Judge them for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess had risen as she spoke, which was also what Mrs. Donner and\r\nMrs. Brookenham had done; and Mr. Mitchett was on his feet as well, to\r\nact on this last admonition. Mrs. Donner was taking leave, and there\r\noccurred among the three ladies in connexion with the circumstance a\r\nsomewhat striking exchange of endearments. Mr. Mitchett, observing this,\r\nexpressed himself suddenly as diverted. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, they\xe2\x80\x99re kissing--she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin Lady Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s arms!\xe2\x80\x9d But his hilarity was still to deepen. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Lady\r\nFanny, by Jove, is in Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s all beyond ME!\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess cried; and the little wail of her\r\nbaffled imagination had almost the austerity of a complaint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit--they\xe2\x80\x99re all right. Mrs. Brook has acted!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98act\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d his interlocutress ejaculated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Donner\xe2\x80\x99s face presented, as she now crossed the room, something\r\nthat resembled the ravage of a death-struggle between its artificial\r\nand its natural elegance. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy said with decision as he caught\r\nit--\xe2\x80\x9cI back Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d And while a whiff of derision reached him from the\r\nDuchess, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing HAS happened!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nAs to reward him for an indulgence that she must much more have divined\r\nthan overheard the visitor approached him with her sweet bravery of\r\nalarm. \xe2\x80\x9cI go on Thursday to my sister\xe2\x80\x99s, where I shall find Nanda\r\nBrookenham. Can I take her any message from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchett showed a rosiness that might positively have been\r\nreflected. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you dream of her expecting one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess with a cheer that but half carried off her\r\nasperity, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Brook must have told Mrs. Donner to ask you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe latter lady, at this, rested strange eyes on the speaker, and they\r\nhad perhaps something to do with a quick flare of Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s wit. \xe2\x80\x9cTell\r\nher, please--if, as I suppose, you came here to ask the same of her\r\nmother--that I adore her still more for keeping in such happy relations\r\nwith you as enable me thus to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Donner, overwhelmed, took flight with a nervous laugh, leaving Mr.\r\nMitchett and the Duchess still confronted. Nothing had passed between\r\nthe two ladies, yet it was as if there were a trace of something in\r\nthe eyes of the elder, which, during a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, moved from\r\nthe retreating visitor, now formally taken over at the door by Edward\r\nBrookenham, to Lady Fanny and her hostess, who, in spite of the embraces\r\njust performed, had again subsided together while Mrs. Brook gazed up\r\nin exalted intelligence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a funny house,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess at last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe makes me such a scene over my not bringing Aggie, and still\r\nmore over my very faint hint of my reasons for it, that I fly off,\r\nin compunction, to do what I can, on the spot, to repair my excess of\r\nprudence. I reappear, panting, with my niece--and it\xe2\x80\x99s to THIS company I\r\nintroduce her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion looked at the charming child, to whom Lord Petherton was\r\ntalking with evident kindness and gaiety--a conjunction that evidently\r\nexcited Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s interest. \xe2\x80\x9cMay WE then know her?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with an\r\neffect of drollery. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I--if HE may?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, turned to him, had taken another light. He even\r\ngaped a little at their expression, which was in a manner carried out by\r\nher tone. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and talk to her, you perverse creature, and send him over\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Petherton, a minute later, had joined her; old Edward had\r\nleft the room with Mrs. Donner; his wife and Lady Fanny were still more\r\nclosely engaged; and the young Agnesina, though visibly a little scared\r\nat Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s queer countenance, had begun, after the fashion he had\r\ntouched on to Mrs. Brook, politely to invoke the aid of the idea of\r\nhabit. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here--you must help me,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess said to Petherton.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can, perfectly--and it\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve yet asked of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d her interlocutor laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have Mitchy,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on without noticing his particular shade\r\nof humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMitchy too?\xe2\x80\x9d--he appeared to wish to leave her in no doubt of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow low you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she simply said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are times when I despair of\r\nyou. He\xe2\x80\x99s in every way your superior, and I like him so that--well, he\r\nmust like HER. Make him feel that he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Petherton turned it over as something put to him practically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncould wish for him that he would. I see in her possibilities--!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you do. I see them in Mitchett, and I trust you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nunderstand me when I say I appeal to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAppeal to HIM straight. That\xe2\x80\x99s much better,\xe2\x80\x9d Petherton lucidly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess wore for a moment her proudest air, which made her, in the\r\nconnexion, exceptionally gentle. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer interlocutor looked at her with all his bright brutality. \xe2\x80\x9cOh my\r\ndear, I can speak for you--if THAT\xe2\x80\x99S what you want!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess met his eyes, and so for an instant they sounded each other.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so abysmally coarse that I often wonder--!\xe2\x80\x9d But as the door\r\nreopened she caught herself. It was the effect of a face apparently\r\ndirected at her. \xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet. Here\xe2\x80\x99s old Edward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THIRD. MR. LONGDON\r\n\r\nIf Mitchy arrived exactly at the hour it was quite by design and on a\r\ncalculation--over and above the prized little pleasure it might give\r\nhim--of ten minutes clear with his host, whom it rarely befell him to\r\nsee alone. He had a theory of something special to go into, of a\r\nplummet to sink or a feeler to put forth; his state of mind in short\r\nwas diplomatic and anxious. But his hopes had a drop as he crossed\r\nthe threshold. His precaution had only assured him the company of a\r\nstranger, for the person in the room to whom the servant announced\r\nhim was not old Van. On the other hand this gentleman would clearly be\r\nold--what was it? the fellow Vanderbank had made it a matter of such\r\nimportance he should \xe2\x80\x9creally know.\xe2\x80\x9d But were they then simply to have\r\ntea there together? No; the candidate for Mr. Mitchett\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance,\r\nas if quickly guessing his apprehension, mentioned on the spot that\r\ntheir entertainer would be with them: he had just come home in a\r\nhurry, fearing he was late, and then had rushed off to make a change.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d said the speaker, who offered his explanation as if he\r\nhad had it on his mind--\xe2\x80\x9cfortunately the ladies haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh there ARE to be ladies?\xe2\x80\x9d--Mr. Mitchett was all response. His fellow\r\nguest, who was shy and apparently nervous, sidled about a little,\r\nswinging an eye-glass, yet glancing in a manner a trifle birdlike from\r\nobject to object. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Edward Brookenham I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy himself felt, as soon as this comment had quitted his lips,\r\nthat it might sound even to a stranger like a sign, such as the votaries\r\nof Mrs. Edward Brookenham had fallen into the way of constantly throwing\r\noff, that he recognised her hand in the matter. There was, however,\r\nsomething in his entertainer\xe2\x80\x99s face that somehow encouraged frankness;\r\nit had the sociability of surprise--it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the chill. Mitchy saw\r\nat the same time that this friend of old Van\xe2\x80\x99s would never really\r\nunderstand him; though that was a thing he at times liked people as much\r\nfor as he liked them little for it at others. It was in fact when he\r\nmost liked that he was on the whole most tempted to mystify. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly Mrs.\r\nBrook?--no others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d his elder echoed; staring an instant as if literally\r\nmissing the connexion; but quickly after, to show he was not stupid--and\r\nindeed it seemed to show he was delightful--smiling with extravagant\r\nintelligence. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the right thing to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy gave the kindest of laughs. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I dare say I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to correct you,\xe2\x80\x9d his interlocutor hastened to profess;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant on the contrary, will it be right for me too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s great goggle attentively fixed him. \xe2\x80\x9cTry it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo HER?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo every one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo her husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh to Edward,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed again, \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd must I call him \xe2\x80\x98Edward\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you do will be right,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy returned--\xe2\x80\x9ceven though it should\r\nhappen to be sometimes what I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion, as if to look at him with a due appreciation of this,\r\nstopped swinging the nippers and put them on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou people here have a\r\npleasant way--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh we HAVE!\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy, taking him up, was gaily emphatic. He began,\r\nhowever, already to perceive the mystification which in this case was to\r\nbe his happy effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanderbank,\xe2\x80\x9d his victim remarked with perhaps a shade more of\r\nreserve, \xe2\x80\x9chas told me a good deal about you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as if, in a finer\r\nmanner, to keep the talk off themselves: \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows a great many ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, poor chap, he can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. He finds a lady wherever he\r\nturns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger took this in, but seemed a little to challenge it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s reassuring, if one sometimes fancies there are fewer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFewer than there used to be?--I see what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nif it has struck you so, that\xe2\x80\x99s awfully interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d He glared and\r\ngrinned and mused. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d His friend seemed to wish not to dogmatise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSHALL we?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy considered it again in its high suggestive light.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will--but how shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d Then he caught himself up with a blush.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beastly thing to say--as if it were mere years that make you see\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion this time gave way to the joke. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat else can it be--if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s the facts themselves, and the fine taste, and above all\r\nsomething qui ne court pas les rues, an approach to some experience of\r\nwhat a lady IS.\xe2\x80\x9d The young man\xe2\x80\x99s acute reflexion appeared suddenly to\r\nflower into a vision of opportunity that swept everything else away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my insisting on your time of life--but you HAVE seen some?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nquestion was of such interest that he had already begun to follow it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the charm of talk with some one who can fill out one\xe2\x80\x99s idea of\r\nthe really distinguished women of the past! If I could get you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cto be so awfully valuable as to fill out mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis fellow visitor, on this, made, in a pause, a nearer approach to\r\ntaking visibly his measure. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve got an idea?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nMitchett brightly thought. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. That must be just why I appeal to you.\r\nAnd it can\xe2\x80\x99t therefore be for confirmation, can it?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmust be for the beautiful primary hint altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis interlocutor began, with a shake of the eyeglass, to shift and sidle\r\nagain, as if distinctly excited by the subject. But it was as if his\r\nvery excitement made the poor gentleman a trifle coy. \xe2\x80\x9cAre there no nice\r\nones now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, there must be lots. In fact I know quantities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis had the effect of pulling the stranger up. \xe2\x80\x9cAh \xe2\x80\x98quantities\xe2\x80\x99! There\r\nit is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cfancy the \xe2\x80\x98lady\xe2\x80\x99 in her millions. Have you come\r\nup to London, wondering, as you must, about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening--for\r\nVanderbank mentioned, I think, that you HAVE come up--in pursuit of\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the subject of Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s information, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\n\xe2\x80\x98pursuit,\xe2\x80\x99 with me, is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re at the age,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy returned, \xe2\x80\x9cof--the most exquisite form\r\nof it. Observation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet it\xe2\x80\x99s a form, I seem to see, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve not waited for my age\r\nto cultivate.\xe2\x80\x9d This was followed by a decisive headshake. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not an\r\nobserver. I\xe2\x80\x99m a hater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat only means,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you keep your observation for\r\nyour likes--which is more admirable than prudent. But between my fear\r\nin the one direction and my desire in the other,\xe2\x80\x9d he lightly added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nscarcely know how to present myself. I must study the ground. Meanwhile\r\nHAS old Van told you much about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Van\xe2\x80\x99s possible confidant, instead of immediately answering, again\r\nassumed the pince-nez. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you call him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn general, I think--for shortness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd also\xe2\x80\x9d--the speaker hesitated--\xe2\x80\x9cfor esteem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cFor veneration! Our disrespects, I think, are\r\nall tender, and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the world do to a person we don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nanything so nice as to call him, or even to call her, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis questioner had quickly looked as if he knew. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething pleasant and\r\nvulgar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s gaiety deepened. \xe2\x80\x9cThat discrimination\xe2\x80\x99s our only austerity. You\r\nmust fall in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what will you call ME?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we?\xe2\x80\x9d After which, sustainingly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x98Mitchy,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d our friend\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nHis interlocutor looked slightly queer. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can quite\r\nbegin. I\xe2\x80\x99m Mr. Longdon,\xe2\x80\x9d he almost blushed to articulate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely and essentially--that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I recognise. I defy any\r\none to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy declared, \xe2\x80\x9cas anything else, and on that footing\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be, among us, unique.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon appeared to accept his prospect of isolation with a\r\ncertain gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cI gather from you--I\xe2\x80\x99ve gathered indeed from Mr.\r\nVanderbank--that you\xe2\x80\x99re a little sort of a set that hang very much\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; not a formal association nor a secret society--still less a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98dangerous gang\xe2\x80\x99 or an organisation for any definite end. We\xe2\x80\x99re simply\r\na collection of natural affinities,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy explained; \xe2\x80\x9cmeeting perhaps\r\nprincipally in Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room--though sometimes also in old\r\nVan\xe2\x80\x99s, as you see, sometimes even in mine--and governed at any rate\r\neverywhere by Mrs. Brook, in our mysterious ebbs and flows, very much as\r\nthe tides are governed by the moon. As I say,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must\r\njoin. But if Van has got hold of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cor you\xe2\x80\x99ve got hold of\r\nhim, you HAVE joined. We\xe2\x80\x99re not quite so numerous as I could wish, and\r\nwe want variety; we want just what I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll bring us--a fresh\r\neye, an outside mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon wore for a minute the air of a man knowing but too well what\r\nit was to be asked to put down his name. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend Vanderbank swaggers\r\nso little that it\xe2\x80\x99s rather from you than from himself that I seem to\r\ncatch the idea--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf his being a great figure among us? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he may have\r\nsaid to you or have suppressed; but you can take it from me--as between\r\nourselves, you know--that he\xe2\x80\x99s very much the best of us. Old Van in\r\nfact--if you really want a candid opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mitchy shone still\r\nbrighter as he talked, \xe2\x80\x9cis formed for a distinctly higher sphere. I\r\nshould go so far as to say that on our level he\xe2\x80\x99s positively wasted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you very sure you\xe2\x80\x99re not?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon asked with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear no--I\xe2\x80\x99m in my element. My element\xe2\x80\x99s to grovel before Van. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nonly to look at me, as you must already have made out, to see I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\neverything dreadful that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him for yourself--I\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy sighed.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, as under the coercion of so much confidence, had stood in\r\nplace longer than for any previous moment, and the spell continued for\r\na minute after Mitchy had paused. Then nervously and abruptly he turned\r\naway, his friend watching him rather aimlessly wander. \xe2\x80\x9cOur host has\r\nspoken of you to me in high terms,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he came back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nno fault to find with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy took it with his highest light. \xe2\x80\x9cI know from your taking the\r\ntrouble to remember that, how much what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said of him pleases and\r\ntouches you. We\xe2\x80\x99re a little sort of religion then, you and I; we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nan organisation of two, at any rate, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t help ourselves.\r\nThere--that\xe2\x80\x99s settled.\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced at the clock on the chimney. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gentlemen dress so much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\nMitchy met the explanation quite halfway. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ try to look funny--but\r\nwhy should Apollo in person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon weighed it. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think him like Apollo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very image. Ask any of the women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do _I_ know--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow Apollo must look?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy considered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the way it works is that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s just from Van\xe2\x80\x99s appearance they get the tip, and that then, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see? they\xe2\x80\x99ve their term of comparison. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it what you call a\r\nvicious circle? I borrow a little their vice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, who had once more been arrested, once more sidled away.\r\nThen he spoke from the other side of the expanse of a table covered with\r\nbooks for which the shelves had no space--covered with portfolios, with\r\nwell-worn leather-cased boxes, with documents in neat piles. The place\r\nwas a miscellany, yet not a litter, the picture of an admirable order.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re a fond association of two, you and I, let me, accepting your\r\nidea, do what, this way, under a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s roof and while enjoying his\r\nhospitality, I should in ordinary circumstances think perhaps something\r\nof a breach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh strike out!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed. It possibly chilled his interlocutor,\r\nwho again hung fire so long that he himself at last adopted his image.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he marry, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon fairly flushed with recognition. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very deep, but with\r\nwhat we perceive--why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy continued visibly to have his amusement, which might have been,\r\nthis time and in spite of the amalgamation he had pictured, for what\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d perceived. But he threw off after an instant an answer clearly\r\nintended to meet the case. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the means. He has great\r\nideas of what a fellow must offer a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes travelled a while over the amenities about him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a view of himself alone--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to make him think he\xe2\x80\x99s enough as he stands? No,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t fancy he has a very awful view of himself alone. And since we ARE\r\nburning this incense under his nose,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s also my impression\r\nthat he has no private means. Women in London cost so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cThey come very high, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh tremendously. They want so much--they want everything. I mean the\r\nsort of women he lives with. A modest man--who\xe2\x80\x99s also poor--isn\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\nit. I give you that at any rate as his view. There are lots of them that\r\nwould---and only too glad--\xe2\x80\x98love him for himself\xe2\x80\x99; but things are much\r\nmixed, and these not necessarily the right ones, and at all events he\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t see it. The result of which is that he\xe2\x80\x99s waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiting to feel himself in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking of marriage. Of course\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll say there are women with money. There ARE\xe2\x80\x9d--he seemed for a\r\nmoment to meditate--\xe2\x80\x9cdreadful ones!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men, on this, exchanged a long regard. \xe2\x80\x9cHe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy again hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had also a silence, which he presently terminated by one of\r\nhis jerks into motion. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shan\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more Mitchy watched him revolve a little, but now, familiarly yet\r\nwith a sharp emphasis, he himself resumed their colloquy. \xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Mr.\r\nLongdon. Are you seriously taking him up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet again, at the tone of this appeal, the old man perceptibly coloured.\r\nIt was as if his friend had brought to the surface an inward excitement,\r\nand he laughed for embarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see things with a freedom--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s so I express them. I see them, I know, with a raccourci;\r\nbut time after all rather presses, and at any rate we understand\r\neach other. What I want now is just to say\xe2\x80\x9d--and Mitchy spoke with a\r\nsimplicity and a gravity he had not yet used--\xe2\x80\x9cthat if your interest in\r\nhim should at any time reach the point of your wishing to do something\r\nor other (no matter what, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?) FOR him--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, as he faltered, appeared to wonder, but emitted a sound of\r\ngentleness. \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stimulated Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cdo, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, just let me have\r\na finger in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s momentary mystification was perhaps partly but the natural\r\neffect of constitutional prudence. \xe2\x80\x9cA finger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean--let me help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d breathed the old man thoughtfully and without meeting his eyes.\r\n\r\nMitchy, as if with more to say, watched him an instant, then before\r\nspeaking caught himself up. \xe2\x80\x9cLook out--here he comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing the stir of the door by which he had entered he looked round;\r\nbut it opened at first only to admit Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s servant. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nBrookenham!\xe2\x80\x9d the man announced; on which the two gentlemen in the room\r\nwere--audibly, almost violently--precipitated into a union of surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHowever she might have been discussed Nanda was not one to shrink, for,\r\nthough she drew up an instant on failing to find in the room the person\r\nwhose invitation she had obeyed, she advanced the next moment as if\r\neither of the gentlemen before her would answer as well. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you\r\ndo, Mr. Mitchy? How do you do, Mr. Longdon?\xe2\x80\x9d She made no difference for\r\nthem, speaking to the elder, whom she had not yet seen, as if they were\r\nalready acquainted. There was moreover in the air of that personage at\r\nthis juncture little to invite such a confidence: he appeared to have\r\nbeen startled, in the oddest manner, into stillness and, holding out\r\nno hand to meet her, only stared rather stiffly and without a smile. An\r\nobserver disposed to interpret the scene might have fancied him a trifle\r\nput off by the girl\xe2\x80\x99s familiarity, or even, as by a singular effect\r\nof her self-possession, stricken into deeper diffidence. This\r\nself-possession, however, took on her own part no account of any\r\nawkwardness: it seemed the greater from the fact that she was almost\r\nunnaturally grave, and it overflowed in the immediate challenge: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nmean to say Van isn\xe2\x80\x99t here? I\xe2\x80\x99ve come without mother--she said I could,\r\nto see HIM,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, addressing herself more particularly to\r\nMitchy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she didn\xe2\x80\x99t say I might do anything of that sort to see\r\nYOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf there was something serious in Nanda and something blank in their\r\ncompanion, there was, superficially at least, nothing in Mr. Mitchett\r\nbut his usual flush of gaiety. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she really send you off this way\r\nalone?\xe2\x80\x9d Then while the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face met his own with the clear confession\r\nof it: \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she too splendid for anything?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with immense\r\nenjoyment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you suppose is her idea?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had now\r\nturned to Mr. Longdon, whom she fixed with her mild straightness; which\r\nled to Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s carrying on and repeating the appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs. Brook\r\ncharming? What do you suppose is her idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a bound into the mystery, a bound of which his fellow visitor\r\nstood quite unconscious, only looking at Nanda still with the same\r\ncoldness of wonder. All expression had for the minute been arrested\r\nin Mr. Longdon, but he at last began to show that it had merely been\r\nretarded. Yet it was almost with solemnity that he put forth his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do? How do you do? I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda shook hands with him as if she had done so already, though it\r\nmight have been just her look of curiosity that detracted from her air\r\nof amusing herself. \xe2\x80\x9cMother has wanted me awfully to see you. She told\r\nme to give you her love,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Then she added with odd irrelevance:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come in the carriage, nor in a cab nor an omnibus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came on a bicycle?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I walked.\xe2\x80\x9d She still spoke without a gleam. \xe2\x80\x9cMother wants me to do\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven to walk!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, we must in these times keep up\r\nour walking!\xe2\x80\x9d The ingenious observer just now suggested might even have\r\ndetected in the still higher rise of this visitor\xe2\x80\x99s spirits a want of\r\nmere inward ease.\r\n\r\nShe had taken no notice of the effect upon him of her mention of her\r\nmother, and she took none, visibly, of Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s manner or of his\r\nwords. What she did while the two men, without offering her, either, a\r\nseat, practically lost themselves in their deepening vision, was to give\r\nher attention all to the place, looking at the books, pictures and other\r\nsignificant objects, and especially at the small table set out for tea,\r\nto which the servant who had admitted her now returned with a steaming\r\nkettle. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it charming here? Will there be any one else? Where IS\r\nMr. Van? Shall I make tea?\xe2\x80\x9d There was just a faint quaver, showing a\r\ncommand of the situation more desired perhaps than achieved, in the very\r\nrapid sequence of these ejaculations. The servant meanwhile had placed\r\nthe hot water above the little silver lamp and left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s anything the matter? Oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t the man--or do you\r\nknow our host\xe2\x80\x99s room?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon, addressing Mitchy with solicitude,\r\nyet began to show in a countenance less blank a return of his sense of\r\nrelations. It was as if something had happened to him and he were in\r\nhaste to convert the signs of it into an appearance of care for the\r\nproprieties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cVan\xe2\x80\x99s only making himself beautiful\xe2\x80\x9d--which account\r\nof their absent entertainer gained a point from his appearance at the\r\nmoment in the doorway furthest removed from the place where the three\r\nwere gathered.\r\n\r\nVanderbank came in with friendly haste and with something of the\r\nlook indeed--refreshed, almost rosy, brightly brushed and quickly\r\nbuttoned--of emerging, out of breath, from pleasant ablutions and\r\nrenewals. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a brute to have kept you waiting! I came back from work\r\nquite begrimed. How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, how d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, how d\xe2\x80\x99ye do? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter\r\nwith you, huddled there as if you were on a street-crossing? I want you\r\nto think this a refuge--but not of that kind!\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cSit\r\ndown, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake; lie down--be happy! Of course you\xe2\x80\x99ve made\r\nacquaintance all--except that Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s so modest! Tea, tea!\xe2\x80\x9d--and he\r\nbustled to the table, where the next minute he appeared rather helpless.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNanda, you blessed child, do YOU mind making it? How jolly of you!--are\r\nyou all right?\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed, with this, for the first time, to be aware of\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s absence. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming? She let you come alone?\r\nHow jolly of her!\xe2\x80\x9d Pulling off her gloves Nanda had come immediately\r\nto his assistance; on which, quitting the table and laying hands on Mr.\r\nLongdon\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder to push him toward a sofa, he continued to talk, to\r\nsound a note of which the humour was the exaggeration of his flurry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow jolly of you to be willing to come--most awfully kind! I hope she\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t ill? Do, Mitchy, lie down. Down, Mitchy, down!--that\xe2\x80\x99s the only\r\nway to keep you.\xe2\x80\x9d He had waited for no account of Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhealth, and it might have been apparent--still to our sharp\r\nspectator--that he found nothing wonderful in her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s unsupported\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make tea beautifully,\xe2\x80\x9d she said from behind her table. \xe2\x80\x9cMother\r\nshowed me how this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning?\xe2\x80\x9d--and Mitchy, who, before the fire and still erect,\r\nhad declined to be laid low, greeted the simple remark with uproarious\r\nmirth. \xe2\x80\x9cDear young lady, you\xe2\x80\x99re the most delicious family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe showed me at breakfast about the little things to do. She thought\r\nI might have to make it here and told me to offer,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet done it this way at home--I usually have my tea upstairs.\r\nThey bring it up in a cup, all made and very weak, with a piece of\r\nbread-and-butter in the saucer. That\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99m so young. Tishy never\r\nlets me touch hers either; so we had to make up for lost time. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat mother said\xe2\x80\x9d--she followed up her story, and her young distinctness\r\nhad clearly something to do with a certain pale concentration in Mr.\r\nLongdon\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cMother isn\xe2\x80\x99t ill, but she told me already yesterday\r\nshe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come. She said it\xe2\x80\x99s really all for ME. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I hope it\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d--with which there flickered in her eyes, dimly but perhaps all\r\nthe more prettily, the first intimation they had given of the light of\r\nlaughter. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me you\xe2\x80\x99d understand, Mr. Van--from something you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nsaid to her. It\xe2\x80\x99s for my seeing Mr. Longdon without--she thinks--her\r\nspoiling it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my dear child, \xe2\x80\x98spoiling it\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank protested as he took a\r\ncup of tea from her to carry to their friend. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did your mother ever\r\nspoil anything? I told her Mr. Longdon wanted to see you, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay anything of his not yearning also for the rest of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sound of protest rather formless escaped from the gentleman named, but\r\nNanda continued to carry out her duty. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me to ask why he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen again to see her. Mr. Mitchy, sugar?--isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the way to say it?\r\nThree lumps? You\xe2\x80\x99re like me, only that I more often take five.\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy\r\nhad dashed forward for his tea; she gave it to him; then she added with\r\nher eyes on Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s, which she had had no difficulty in catching:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me to ask you all sorts of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis acquaintance had got up to take his cup from Vanderbank, whose\r\nhand, however, dealt with him on the question of his sitting down again.\r\nMr. Longdon, resisting, kept erect with a low gasp that his host\r\nonly was near enough to catch. This suddenly appeared to confirm an\r\nimpression gathered by Vanderbank in their contact, a strange sense that\r\nhis visitor was so agitated as to be trembling in every limb. It brought\r\nto his own lips a kind of ejaculation--\xe2\x80\x9cI SAY!\xe2\x80\x9d But even as he spoke\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s face, still white, but with a smile that was not all pain,\r\nseemed to supplicate him not to notice; and he was not a man to require\r\nmore than this to achieve a divination as deep as it was rapid. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve all been scattered for Easter, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of Nanda.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon has been at home, your mother and father have been paying\r\nvisits, I myself have been out of London, Mitchy has been to Paris, and\r\nyou--oh yes, I know where you\xe2\x80\x99ve been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh we all know that--there has been such a row made about it!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of the feeling there is,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be awful, my knowing Tishy--quite too awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, with Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s covert aid, had begun to appear to have\r\npulled himself together, dropping back on his sofa and attending in a\r\nmanner to his tea. It might have been with the notion of showing himself\r\nat ease that he turned, on this, a benevolent smile to the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhat, my dear, is the objection--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked gravely from him to Vanderbank and to Mitchy, and then back\r\nagain from one of these to the other. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I ought to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both laughed and they both just appeared uncertain, but Vanderbank\r\nspoke first. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine, Nanda, that you really know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--as a family, you\xe2\x80\x99re perfection!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy broke out. Before the fire\r\nagain, with his cup, he addressed his hilarity to Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cI told\r\nyou a tremendous lot, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis elder maintained, yet with a certain vagueness, the attitude of\r\namiable enquiry. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout the--a--family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cabout its ramifications. This young lady has a\r\ntremendous friendship--and in short it\xe2\x80\x99s all very complicated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Nanda,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all very simple. Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a\r\nword of anything of the sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had spoken as with the intention of a large vague optimism; but there\r\nwas plainly something in the girl that would always make for lucidity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean about Carrie Donner? I DON\xe2\x80\x99T believe it, and at any rate\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s any one\xe2\x80\x99s business. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a very high\r\nopinion of a person who would give up a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped short with\r\nthe sense apparent that she was saying more than she meant, though,\r\nstrangely, as if it had been an effect of her type and of her voice,\r\nthere was neither pertness nor passion in the profession she had just\r\nmade. Curiously wanting as she seemed both in timidity and in levity,\r\nshe was to a certainty not self-conscious--she was extraordinarily\r\nsimple. Mr. Longdon looked at her now with an evident surrender to his\r\nextreme interest, and it might well have perplexed him to see her at\r\nonce so downright as from experience and yet of so fresh and sweet a\r\ntenderness of youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, my dear young lady: never, never give up a\r\nfriend for anything any one says!\xe2\x80\x9d It was Mitchy who rang out with this\r\nlively wisdom, the action of which on Mr. Longdon--unless indeed it was\r\nthe action of something else--was to make that personage, in a manner\r\nthat held the others watching him in slight suspense, suddenly spring to\r\nhis feet again, put down his teacup carefully on a table near and then\r\nwithout a word, as if no one had been present, quietly wander away and\r\ndisappear through the door left open on Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s entrance. It\r\nopened into a second, a smaller sitting-room, into which the eyes of his\r\ncompanions followed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he been taken ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe IS \xe2\x80\x98rum,\xe2\x80\x99 my dear Van,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\xe2\x80\x99re right--of a charm,\r\na distinction! In short just the sort of thing we want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sort of thing we \xe2\x80\x98want\xe2\x80\x99--I dare say!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot the sort of thing that\xe2\x80\x99s to be had for the asking--it\xe2\x80\x99s a sort we\r\nshall be mighty lucky if we can get!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy turned with amusement to Nanda. \xe2\x80\x9cVan has invented him and, with\r\nthe natural greed of the inventor, won\xe2\x80\x99t let us have him cheap. Well,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x98stand\xe2\x80\x99 my share.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty is that he\xe2\x80\x99s so much too good for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUngrateful wretch,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ntelling him that YOU are! Let the return you make not be to deprive\r\nme--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Van\xe2\x80\x99s not at all too good for ME, if you mean that,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda broke\r\nin. She had finished her tea-making and leaned back in her chair with\r\nher hands folded on the edge of the tray.\r\n\r\nVanderbank only smiled at her in silence, but Mitchy took it up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody too good for you, of course; only you\xe2\x80\x99re not quite,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you know? IN our set. You\xe2\x80\x99re in Mrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s. I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing to say--that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any set, that she\xe2\x80\x99s just a loose\r\nlittle white flower dropped on the indifferent bosom of the world. But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re the small sprig of tender green that, added to her, makes her\r\nimmediately \xe2\x80\x98compose.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda looked at him with her cold kindness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense you do talk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour tone\xe2\x80\x99s sweet to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cas showing that you don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nME, either, too good for you. No one, remember, will take that for your\r\nexcuse when the world some day sees me annihilated by your having put an\r\nend to our so harmless relations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl appeared to lose herself a moment in the--abysmal humanity over\r\nwhich his fairly fascinating ugliness played like the whirl of an eddy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartyr!\xe2\x80\x9d she gently exclaimed. But there was no smile with it. She\r\nturned to Vanderbank, who, during the previous minute, had moved toward\r\nthe neighbouring room, then faltering, taking counsel of discretion, had\r\ncome back on a scruple. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat IS the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to get out of him, you wretch?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy went on as\r\ntheir host for an instant said nothing.\r\n\r\nVanderbank, whose handsome face had a fine thought in it, looked a\r\ntrifle absently from one of them to the other; but it was to Nanda he\r\nspoke. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you like him, Nanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed surprise at the question. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I know so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHE knows already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, with his eyes on her, became radiant to interpret. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows\r\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99s pierced to the heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter with him, as you call it,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank brought out, \xe2\x80\x9cis one\r\nof the most beautiful things I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her as with a\r\nhope she\xe2\x80\x99d understand. \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy continued; \xe2\x80\x9cthe victim done for by one glance of the\r\ngoddess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda, motionless in her chair, fixed her other friend with clear\r\ncuriosity. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Beautiful\xe2\x80\x99? Why beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, about to speak, checked himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t spoil it. Have it from HIM!\xe2\x80\x9d--and, returning to their friend,\r\nhe this time went out.\r\n\r\nMitchy and Nanda looked at each other. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it rather awful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mitchy demanded.\r\n\r\nShe got up without answering; she slowly came away from the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink I do know if I like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell you may,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cafter his putting before you\r\nprobably, on the whole, the greatest of your triumphs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I also know, I think, Mr. Mitchy, that I like YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke\r\nwithout attention to this hyperbole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of my ineffectual attempts to be brilliant? That\xe2\x80\x99s a joy,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cif it\xe2\x80\x99s not drawn out by the mere clumsiness of my flattery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She had turned away from him, kindly enough, as if time for his talk in\r\nthe air were always to be allowed him: she took in vaguely Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooks and prints. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t your mother come?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy then enquired.\r\n\r\nAt this she again looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mention her as a way of\r\nalluding to something you guess she must have told me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I\xe2\x80\x99ve always supposed I make your flesh creep? Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy\r\nadmitted; \xe2\x80\x9cI see she must have said to you: \xe2\x80\x98Be nice to him, to show him\r\nit isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so bad as that!\xe2\x80\x99 So you ARE nice--so you always WILL be\r\nnice. But I adore you, all the same, without illusions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had opened at one of the tables, unperceivingly, a big volume of\r\nwhich she turned the leaves. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98adore\xe2\x80\x99 a girl, Mr. Mitchy--just\r\nhelp her. That\xe2\x80\x99s more to the purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp you?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou bring tears to my eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t a girl have friends?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of anything\r\nso idiotic.\xe2\x80\x9d Giving him, however, no chance to take her up on this, she\r\nmade a quick transition. \xe2\x80\x9cMother didn\xe2\x80\x99t come because she wants me now,\r\nas she says, more to share her own life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy looked at it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut is this the way for her to share yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s another matter--about which you must talk to HER. She wants\r\nme no longer to keep seeing only with her eyes. She\xe2\x80\x99s throwing me into\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy had listened with the liveliest interest, but he presently broke\r\ninto a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a good thing then that I\xe2\x80\x99m there to catch you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout--it might have been seen--having gathered the smallest\r\nimpression of what they enclosed, she carefully drew together again the\r\ncovers of her folio. There was deliberation in her movements. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nalways be glad when you\xe2\x80\x99re there. But where do you suppose they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngone?\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes were on what was visible of the other room, from which\r\nthere arrived no sound of voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re off there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cbut just looking unutterable things\r\nabout you. The impression\xe2\x80\x99s too deep. Let them look, and tell me\r\nmeanwhile if Mrs. Donner gave you my message.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, she told me some humbug.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe humbug then was in the tone my perfectly sincere speech took from\r\nherself. She gives things, I recognise, rather that sound. It\xe2\x80\x99s her\r\nweakness,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand perhaps even one may say her danger. All\r\nthe more reason you should help her, as I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be\r\ndoing, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? I hope you feel you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he earnestly added.\r\n\r\nHe had spoken this time gravely enough, and with magnificent gravity\r\nNanda replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI HAVE helped her. Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s sure I have. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nTishy wants me for. She says that to be with some nice girl\xe2\x80\x99s really the\r\nbest thing for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s face hereupon would have been interesting, would have been\r\ndistinctly touching to other eyes; but Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s were not heedful of it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned after an instant and without profane mirth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nseems to me the best thing for any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, however, might have caught his expression, for Vanderbank\r\nnow reappeared, smiling on the pair as if struck by their intimacy. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nyou ARE keeping it up!\xe2\x80\x9d Then to Nanda persuasively: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind going\r\nto him in there? I want him so really to see you. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite, you know,\r\nwhat he came for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda seemed to wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will he do to me? Anything dreadful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I meant just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cif he\xe2\x80\x99s a person who can tell me sometimes what you\r\nmean--!\xe2\x80\x9d With which she went quickly off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can\xe2\x80\x99t _I_ hear?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy asked of his host while they looked after\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but only from me.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank had pushed him to a seat again and\r\nwas casting about for cigarettes. \xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet and smoke, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, on the sofa, received with meditation a light. \xe2\x80\x9cWill she\r\nunderstand? She has everything in the world but one,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, before him, lighted for himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sense of humour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy smoked a little. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s tragic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend, at the fire, watched a moment the empty portion of the other\r\nroom, then walked across to give the door a light push that all but\r\nclosed it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather odd,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked as he came back--\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nwhat I just said to him. But he won\xe2\x80\x99t treat her to comedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it the shock of the resemblance to her grandmother?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank had\r\nasked of Mr. Longdon on rejoining him in his retreat. This victim of\r\nmemory, with his back turned, was gazing out of the window, and when in\r\nanswer he showed his face there were tears in his eyes. His answer\r\nin fact was just these tears, the significance of which Vanderbank\r\nimmediately recognised. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still greater then than you gathered from\r\nher photograph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the most extraordinary thing in the world. I\xe2\x80\x99m too absurd to be so\r\nupset\xe2\x80\x9d--Mr. Longdon smiled through his tears--\xe2\x80\x9cbut if you had known\r\nLady Julia you\xe2\x80\x99d understand. It\xe2\x80\x99s SHE again, as I first knew her, to the\r\nlife; and not only in feature, in stature, in colour, in movement, but\r\nin every bodily mark and sign, in every look of the eyes above all--oh\r\nto a degree!--in the sound, in the charm of the voice.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke low and\r\nconfidentially, but with an intensity that now relieved him--he was as\r\nrestless as with a discovery. He moved about as with a sacred awe--he\r\nmight a few steps away have been in the very presence. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s ALL Lady\r\nJulia. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a touch of her mother. It\xe2\x80\x99s unique--an absolute\r\nrevival. I see nothing of her father, I see nothing of any one else.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it thought wonderful by every one?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ntell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have prepared you a little?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank felt almost guilty. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsee--I should have liked to make more of it; though,\xe2\x80\x9d he added all\r\nlucidly, \xe2\x80\x9cI might so, by putting you on your guard, have caused myself\r\nto lose what, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me to say it, strikes me as one of the\r\nmost touching tributes I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen rendered to a woman. In fact,\r\nhowever, how could I know? I never saw Lady Julia, and you had in\r\nadvance all the evidence I could have: the portrait--pretty bad, in the\r\ntaste of the time, I admit--and the three or four photographs you must\r\nhave noticed with it at Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s. These things must have compared\r\nthemselves for you with my photograph in there of the granddaughter.\r\nThe similarity of course we had all observed, but it has taken your\r\nwonderful memory and your happy vision to put into it all the detail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon thought a moment, giving a dab with his pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true--you\xe2\x80\x99re quite right. It\xe2\x80\x99s far beyond any identity in the\r\npictures. But why did you tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added more sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve deprived me,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cof the power of expressing\r\ncivilly any surprise at your finding her so. But I said to you, please\r\nremember, nothing that qualified a jot my sense of the special stamp of\r\nher face. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always positively found in it a recall of the type of the\r\nperiod you must be thinking of. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit modern. It\xe2\x80\x99s a face of\r\nSir Thomas Lawrence--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a face of Gainsborough!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon returned with spirit. \xe2\x80\x9cLady\r\nJulia herself harked back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, clearly, was equally touched and amused. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us say at once\r\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s a face of Raphael.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis old friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand was instantly on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\r\noften said to myself of Lady Julia\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe forehead\xe2\x80\x99s a little too high,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s just that excess that, with the exquisite eyes and the\r\nparticular disposition round it of the fair hair, makes the individual\r\ngrace, makes the beauty of the resemblance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReleased by Lady Julia\xe2\x80\x99s lover, the young man in turn grasped him as\r\nan encouragement to confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a face that should have the\r\nlong side-ringlets of 1830. It should have the rest of the personal\r\narrangement, the pelisse, the shape of bonnet, the sprigged muslin\r\ndress and the cross-laced sandals. It should have arrived in a pea-green\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tilbury\xe2\x80\x99 and be a reader of Mrs. Radcliffe. And all this to complete\r\nthe Raphael!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, who, his discovery proclaimed, had begun, as might have\r\nbeen said, to live with it, looked hard a moment at his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve observed her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank met it without confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom haven\xe2\x80\x99t I observed? Do you\r\nlike her?\xe2\x80\x9d he then rather oddly and abruptly asked.\r\n\r\nThe old man broke away again. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell--with such disparities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manner must be different,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the things\r\nshe says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis visitor was before him again. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of them.\r\nThey don\xe2\x80\x99t go with the rest of her. Lady Julia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nrather shy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this too his host could meet him. \xe2\x80\x9cShe must have been. And\r\nNanda--yes, certainly--doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give that impression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary. But Lady Julia was gay!\xe2\x80\x9d he added with an eagerness\r\nthat made Vanderbank smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can also see that. Nanda doesn\xe2\x80\x99t joke. And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank continued\r\nwith his exemplary candour, \xe2\x80\x9cwe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of her, must we? as if she\r\nwere bold and grim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon fixed him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she\xe2\x80\x99s sad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had preserved their lowered tone and might, with their heads\r\ntogether, have been conferring as the party \xe2\x80\x9cout\xe2\x80\x9d in some game with the\r\ncouple in the other room. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Sad.\xe2\x80\x9d But Vanderbank broke off. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsend her to you.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus it was he had come back to her.\r\n\r\nNanda, on joining the elder man, went straight to the point. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful--what you feel on seeing me: if that IS what he\r\nmeant.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon kept silent again at first, only smiling at her, but\r\nless strangely now, and then appeared to look about him for some place\r\nwhere she could sit near him. There was a sofa in this room too, on\r\nwhich, observing it, she quickly sank down, so that they were presently\r\ntogether, placed a little sideways and face to face. She had shown\r\nperhaps that she supposed him to have wished to take her hand, but he\r\nforbore to touch her, though letting her feel all the kindness of his\r\neyes and their long backward vision. These things she evidently felt\r\nsoon enough; she went on before he had spoken. \xe2\x80\x9cI know how well you knew\r\nmy grandmother. Mother has told me--and I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad. She told me to say\r\nto you that she wants YOU to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d Just a shade, at this, might have\r\nappeared to drop over his face, but who was there to know if the girl\r\nobserved it? It didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent at any rate her completing her statement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why she wished me to-day to come alone. She said she wished you\r\nto have me all to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, decidedly, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t shy: that mute reflexion was in the air an\r\ninstant. \xe2\x80\x9cThat, no doubt, is the best way. I thank her very much. I\r\ncalled, after having had the honour of dining--I called, I think, three\r\ntimes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with a sudden displacement of the question; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nhad the misfortune each time to miss her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept looking at him with her crude young clearness. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nabout that. Mother thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s more at home than almost any one.\r\nShe does it on purpose: she knows what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda pursued with her\r\nperfect gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cfor people to be disappointed of finding her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I shall find her yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I hope I shall\r\nalso find YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe appeared simply to consider the possibility and after an instant to\r\nthink well of it. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you will now, for now I shall be down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion just blinked. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the drawing-room, you mean--always?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite what she meant. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways. I shall see all the people who\r\ncome. It will be a great thing for me. I want to hear all the talk. Mr.\r\nMitchett says I ought to--that it helps to form the young mind. I hoped,\r\nfor that reason,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on with the directness that made her honesty\r\nalmost violent--\xe2\x80\x9cI hoped there would be more people here to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad there are not!\xe2\x80\x9d--the old man rang equally clear. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nVanderbank kindly arranged the matter for me just this way. I met him at\r\ndinner, at your mother\xe2\x80\x99s, three weeks ago, and he brought me home here\r\nthat night, when, as knowing you so differently, we took the liberty of\r\ntalking you all over. It naturally had the effect of making me want to\r\nbegin with you afresh--only that seemed difficult too without further\r\nhelp. This he good-naturedly offered me; he said\xe2\x80\x9d--and Mr. Longdon\r\nrecovered his spirits to repeat it--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hang it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have \xe2\x80\x98em here for\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see--he knew we\xe2\x80\x99d come.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she caught herself up. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome, have we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s all right--it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. To me the occasion\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant and\r\nthe affluence great. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had such talk with those young men--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x9d--she was again prompt, but beyond any young person he had ever\r\nmet she might have struck him as literal. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not used to such talk.\r\nNeither am I. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather wonderful, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? They\xe2\x80\x99re thought awfully\r\nclever, Mr. Van and Mr. Mitchy. Do you like them?\xe2\x80\x9d she pushed on.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, who, as compared with her, might have struck a spectator\r\nas infernally subtle, took an instant to think. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never met Mr.\r\nMitchett before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he always thinks one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like him,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut one\r\ndoes. One ought to,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nHer companion had another pause. \xe2\x80\x9cHe likes YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh Mr. Longdon needn\xe2\x80\x99t have hesitated! \xe2\x80\x9cI know he does. He has told\r\nmother. He has told lots of people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has told even you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s a bit dreadful,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npursued. Still, there was a greater interest. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you like Mr. Van?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time her interlocutor indeed hung fire. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell? He dazzles\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you like that?\xe2\x80\x9d Then before he could really say: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nafraid he may be false?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this he fairly laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go to the point!\xe2\x80\x9d She just coloured to\r\nhave amused him so, but he quickly went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI think one has a little\r\nnatural nervousness at being carried off one\xe2\x80\x99s feet. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalways liked too much to see where I\xe2\x80\x99m going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t with him?\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with her curious hard interest. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand. But I think I like to be dazzled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99ve got time--you can come round again; you\xe2\x80\x99ve a margin for\r\naccidents, for disappointments and recoveries: you can take one thing\r\nwith another. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve only my last little scrap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you want to make no mistakes--I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m too easily upset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh so am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you that in spite of what you say\r\nI want to make no mistakes either. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a great many--though you\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t think it,\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted; \xe2\x80\x9cI really know what they may be. Do\r\nyou like ME?\xe2\x80\x9d she brought forth. But even on this she spared him too; a\r\nlook appeared to have been enough for her. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you say, of course,\r\nalready?--if you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for Mr. Van. I mean as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him so\r\nmuch. When he asked me just now if I liked YOU I told him it was too\r\nsoon. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t now; you see it goes fast. I DO like you.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave\r\nhim no time to acknowledge this tribute, but--as if it were a matter of\r\ncourse--tried him quickly with something else. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you say if you like\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could meet it pretty well now. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are immense reasons why I\r\nshould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--I know about them, as I mentioned: mother has told me.\xe2\x80\x9d But what\r\nshe had to put to him kept up his surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cHave reasons anything to\r\ndo with it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you like her!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cSHE doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink so,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s face at last, partly bewildered, partly reassured, showed\r\nsomething finer still in the effect she produced. \xe2\x80\x9cInto what mysteries\r\nyou plunge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh we do; that\xe2\x80\x99s what every one says of us. We discuss everything and\r\nevery one--we\xe2\x80\x99re always discussing each other. I think we must be rather\r\ncelebrated for it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of trick--isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?--that\xe2\x80\x99s catching.\r\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s the most interesting sort of talk? Mother says\r\nwe haven\xe2\x80\x99t any prejudices. YOU have, probably, quantities--and beautiful\r\nones: so perhaps I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to tell you. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll find out for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--I\xe2\x80\x99m rather slow; but I generally end by finding out. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\r\nthank heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9cquite prejudices enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me some of them,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda replied in a tone\r\nevidently marking how much he pleased her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you must do as _I_ do--you must find out for yourself. Your\r\nresemblance to your grandmother is quite prodigious,\xe2\x80\x9d he immediately\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d tell me about--your recollection of her and\r\nyour wonderful feeling about her. Mother has told me things, but that I\r\nshould have something straight from you is exactly what she also wants.\r\nMy grandmother must have been awfully nice,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl rambled on, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nsomehow don\xe2\x80\x99t see myself at all as the same sort of person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t say you\xe2\x80\x99re in the least the same sort: all I allude to,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mr. Longdon returned, \xe2\x80\x9cis the miracle of the physical heredity. Nothing\r\ncould be less like her than your manner and your talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda looked at him with all her honesty. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not so good, you must\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hung fire an instant, but was as honest as she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re separated\r\nfrom her by a gulf--and not only of time. Personally, you see, you\r\nbreathe a different air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought--she quite took it in. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course. And you breathe the\r\nsame--the same old one, I mean, as my grandmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same old one,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cas much as possible. Some day\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you more of what you\xe2\x80\x99re curious of. I can\xe2\x80\x99t go into it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve upset you so?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda frankly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can see another too,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed after a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot sure how much I shall understand. But I shall understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x9cmore, perhaps, than you think. In fact,\xe2\x80\x9d she said earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nPROMISE to understand. I\xe2\x80\x99ve some imagination. Had my grandmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she asked. Her actual sequences were not rapid, but she had already\r\nanticipated him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of that before, because I put the same\r\nquestion to mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did your mother say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Imagination--dear mamma? Not a grain!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man showed a faint flush. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother then has a supply that\r\nmakes up for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl fixed him on this with a deeper attention. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like her\r\nhaving said that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis colour came stronger, though a slightly strained smile did what it\r\ncould to diffuse coolness. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a single scrap, my dear, in\r\nrespect to the friend I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of, for any judgement but my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even for her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even for her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon had not spoken loud, but he\r\nrang as clear as a bell.\r\n\r\nNanda, for admiration of it, broke almost for the first time into the\r\nsemblance of a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou feel as if my grandmother were quite YOUR\r\nproperty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say--that\xe2\x80\x99s splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you like it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered kindly.\r\n\r\nThe very kindness pulled her up. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon my speaking so, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nyou know what I mean. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d she eagerly continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nmother won\xe2\x80\x99t also want to hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the subject of Lady Julia?\xe2\x80\x9d He gently, but very effectively, shook\r\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother shall never hear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda appeared to wonder at it an instant, and it made her completely\r\ngrave again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be all for ME?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever there may be of it, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I shall get it all out of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned without hesitation.\r\nHer mixture of free familiarity and of the vividness of evocation of\r\nsomething, whatever it was, sharply opposed--the little worry of\r\nthis contradiction, not altogether unpleasant, continued to fill\r\nhis consciousness more discernibly than anything else. It was really\r\nreflected in his quick brown eyes that she alternately drew him on and\r\nwarned him off, but also that what they were beginning more and more to\r\nmake out was an emotion of her own trembling there beneath her tension.\r\nHis glimpse of it widened--his glimpse of it fairly triumphed when\r\nsuddenly, after this last declaration, she threw off with quite the\r\nsame accent but quite another effect: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to be like any one the\r\nthought of whom makes you so good! You ARE good,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nalready how I shall feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d She stared at him with tears, the sight of\r\nwhich brought his own straight back; so that thus for a moment they sat\r\nthere together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child!\xe2\x80\x9d he at last simply murmured. But he laid his hand on her\r\nnow, and her own immediately met it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get used to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with the same gentleness that the\r\nresponse of her touch had tried to express; \xe2\x80\x9cand I shall be so careful\r\nwith you that--well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see!\xe2\x80\x9d She broke short off with a quaver and\r\nthe next instant she turned--there was some one at the door. Vanderbank,\r\nstill not quite at his ease, had come back to smile upon them. Detaching\r\nherself from Mr. Longdon she got straight up to meet him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were\r\nright, Mr. Van. It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FOURTH. MR. CASHMORE\r\n\r\nHarold Brookenham, whom Mr. Cashmore, ushered in and announced, had\r\nfound in the act of helping himself to a cup of tea at the table\r\napparently just prepared--Harold Brookenham arrived at the point with\r\na dash so direct as to leave the visitor an option between but two\r\nsuppositions: that of a desperate plunge, to have his shame soon over,\r\nor that of the acquired habit of such appeals, which had taught him the\r\neasiest way. There was no great sharpness in the face of Mr. Cashmore,\r\nwho was somehow massive without majesty; yet he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have been proof\r\nagainst the suspicion that his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassment was an\r\neasy precaution, a conscious corrective to the danger of audacity. It\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been impossible to divine that if Harold shut his eyes and\r\njumped it was mainly for the appearance of doing so. Experience was to\r\nbe taken as showing that one might get a five-pound note as one got a\r\nlight for a cigarette; but one had to check the friendly impulse to ask\r\nfor it in the same way. Mr. Cashmore had in fact looked surprised, yet\r\nnot on the whole so surprised as the young man seemed to have expected\r\nof him. There was almost a quiet grace in the combination of promptitude\r\nand diffidence with which Harold took over the responsibility of all\r\nproprietorship of the crisp morsel of paper that he slipped with slow\r\nfirmness into the pocket of his waistcoat, rubbing it gently in its\r\npassage against the delicately buff-coloured duck of which that garment\r\nwas composed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo quite too awfully kind of you that I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to say\xe2\x80\x9d--there was a marked recall, in the manner of this speech,\r\nof the sweetness of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s droop and the tenderness of her wail.\r\nIt was as if he had been moved for the moment to moralise, but the\r\neyes he raised to his benefactor had the oddest effect of marking that\r\npersonage himself as a theme for the moralist.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore, who would have been very red-haired if he had not been\r\nvery bald, showed a single eye-glass and a long upper lip; he was large\r\nand jaunty, with little petulant movements and intense ejaculations that\r\nwere not in the line of his type. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may say anything you like if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say you\xe2\x80\x99ll repay it. That\xe2\x80\x99s always nonsense--I hate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold remained sad, but showed himself really superior. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay it.\xe2\x80\x9d Pensively, a minute, he appeared to figure the words, in their\r\nabsurdity, on the lips of some young man not, like himself, tactful. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow just what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think, you know, that you ought to tell your father,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nCashmore said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him I\xe2\x80\x99ve borrowed of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore good-humouredly demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would serve me right--it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso wretched my having listened to you. Tell him, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on\r\nafter an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what I mean is that if you\xe2\x80\x99re in such straits you\r\nshould speak to him like a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold smiled at the innocence of a friend who could suppose him not to\r\nhave exhausted that resource. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ALWAYS speaking to him like a man,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s just what puts him so awfully out. He denies to my face that\r\nI AM one. One would suppose, to hear him, not only that I\xe2\x80\x99m a small\r\nobjectionable child, but that I\xe2\x80\x99m scarcely even human. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconceive me as with human wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve all--you youngsters--as many wants,\r\nI know, as an advertisement page of the Times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold showed an admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awfully good. If you think you\r\nought to speak of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cdo it rather to mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d He noted\r\nthe hour. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, to give you the chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitor referred to his own watch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your mother herself who\r\ngives the chances--the chances YOU take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold looked kind and simple. \xe2\x80\x9cShe HAS come in, I know. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be with\r\nyou in a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was halfway to the door, but Mr. Cashmore, though so easy, had not\r\ndone with him. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you mean that if it\xe2\x80\x99s only your mother who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntold, you may depend on her to shield you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold turned this over as if it were a questionable sovereign, but on\r\nsecond thoughts he wonderfully smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that after you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlet me have it you can tell? You could, of course, if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nappeared to work it out for Mr. Cashmore\xe2\x80\x99s benefit. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he added, \xe2\x80\x9cyour telling mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind, you mean really, its annoying her so awfully?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe invitation to repent thrown off in this could only strike the young\r\nman as absurd--it was so previous to any enjoyment. Harold liked things\r\nin their proper order; but at the same time his evolutions were quick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I AM selfish, but what I was thinking was that the terrific\r\nwigging, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?--well, I\xe2\x80\x99d take it from HER. She knows about\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s life--about our having to go on, by no fault of our own, as\r\nour parents start us. She knows all about wants--no one has more than\r\nmamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore soundlessly glared his amusement. \xe2\x80\x9cSo she\xe2\x80\x99ll say it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; she\xe2\x80\x99ll let me have it hot. But she\xe2\x80\x99ll recognise that at such\r\na pass more must be done for a fellow, and that may lead to\r\nsomething--indirectly, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? for she won\xe2\x80\x99t TELL my father,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll only, in her own way, work on him--that will put me on a better\r\nfooting and for which therefore at bottom I shall have to thank YOU!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eye assisted by Mr. Cashmore\xe2\x80\x99s glass had with a discernible growth\r\nof something like alarm fixed during this address the subject of his\r\nbeneficence. The thread of their relations somehow lost itself in the\r\nsubtler twist, and he fell back on mere stature, position and property,\r\nthings always convenient in the presence of crookedness. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall say\r\nnothing to your mother, but I think I shall be rather glad you\xe2\x80\x99re not a\r\nson of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold wondered at this new element in their talk. \xe2\x80\x9cDo your sons\r\nnever--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBorrow money of their mother\xe2\x80\x99s visitors?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore had taken him\r\nup, eager, evidently, quite to satisfy him; but the question was caught\r\non the wing by Mrs. Brookenham herself, who had opened the door as her\r\nfriend spoke and who quickly advanced with an echo of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s visitors?\xe2\x80\x9d--and, though her eyes rather avoided than met\r\nhis own, she seemed to cover her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s husband with a vague but\r\npractised sympathy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth are you saying to Harold about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Thus it was that at the end of a few minutes Mr. Cashmore, on the sofa\r\nface to face with her, found his consciousness quite purged of its\r\nactual sense of his weakness and a new turn given to the idea of what,\r\nin one\xe2\x80\x99s very drawing-room, might go on behind one\xe2\x80\x99s back. Harold had\r\nquickly vanished--had been tacitly disposed of, and Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s caller\r\nhad moved even in the short space of time so far in another direction as\r\nto have drawn from her the little cold question: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Presents\xe2\x80\x99? You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clearly felt the importance of expressing at least by his silence and\r\nhis eye-glass what he meant. \xe2\x80\x9cHer extravagance is beyond everything, and\r\nthough there are bills enough, God knows, that do come in to me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee how she pulls through unless there are others that go elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham had given him his tea--her own she had placed on a small\r\ntable near her; and she could now respond freely to the impulse felt,\r\non this, of settling herself to something of real interest. Except to\r\nHarold she was incapable of reproach, though there were of course shades\r\nin her resignation, and her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s report of her to Mr. Longdon as\r\nconscious of an absence of prejudice would have been justified for a\r\nspectator by the particular feeling that Mr. Cashmore\xe2\x80\x99s speech caused\r\nher to disclose. What did this feeling wonderfully appear unless\r\nstrangely irrelevant? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no patience when I hear you talk as if you\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t horribly rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her an instant as if guessing she might have derived that\r\nimpression from Harold. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has that to do with it? Does a rich man\r\nenjoy any more than a poor his wife\xe2\x80\x99s making a fool of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes opened wider: it was one of her very few ways of betraying\r\namusement. There was little indeed to be amused at here except his\r\nchoice of the particular invidious name. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a\r\nword you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore drank his tea, then rose to carry the cup somewhere and put\r\nit down, declining with a motion any assistance. When he was on the sofa\r\nagain he resumed their intimate talk. \xe2\x80\x9cI like tremendously to be with\r\nyou, but you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve come here to let you say to me such\r\ndreadful things as that.\xe2\x80\x9d He was an odd compound, Mr. Cashmore, and the\r\nair of personal good health, the untarnished bloom which sometimes lent\r\na monstrous serenity to his mention of the barely mentionable, was on\r\noccasion balanced or matched by his playful application of extravagant\r\nterms to matters of much less moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I come to you\r\nfor, Mrs. Brook: I won\xe2\x80\x99t come any more if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be horrid and\r\nimpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come to me, I suppose, because--for my deep misfortune, I assure\r\nyou--I\xe2\x80\x99ve a kind of vision of things, of the wretched miseries in which\r\nyou all knot yourselves up, which you yourselves are as little blessed\r\nwith as if, tumbling about together in your heap, you were a litter of\r\nblind kittens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully good that--you do lift the burden of my trouble!\xe2\x80\x9d He had\r\nlaughed out in the manner of the man who made notes for platform use of\r\nthings that might serve; but the next moment he was grave again, as if\r\nhis observation had reminded him of Harold\xe2\x80\x99s praise of his wit. It was\r\nin this spirit that he abruptly brought out: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere, by the way, is your\r\ndaughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea. I do all I can to enter into her life, but\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t get into a railway train while it\xe2\x80\x99s on the rush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore swung back to hilarity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou give me lots of things. Do you\r\nmean she\xe2\x80\x99s so \xe2\x80\x98fast\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d He could keep the ball going.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham obliged him with what she meant. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; she\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous\r\ndear, and we\xe2\x80\x99re great friends. But she has her free young life, which,\r\nby that law of our time that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I only want, like all other laws,\r\nonce I know what they ARE, to accept--she has her precious freshness of\r\nfeeling which I say to myself that, so far as control is concerned, I\r\nought to respect. I try to get her to sit with me, and she does so a\r\nlittle, because she\xe2\x80\x99s kind. But before I know it she leaves me again:\r\nshe feels what a difference her presence makes in one\xe2\x80\x99s liberty of\r\ntalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore was struck by this picture. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awfully charming of\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it too dear?\xe2\x80\x9d The thought of it, for Mrs. Brook, seemed fairly to\r\nopen out vistas. \xe2\x80\x9cThe modern daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not the ancient mother!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore smiled.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with a world of accepted woe. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Give me back, give me\r\nback one hour of my youth\xe2\x80\x99! Oh I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a single thrill left to answer\r\na compliment. I sit here now face to face with things as they are. They\r\ncome in their turn, I assure you--and they find me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook sighed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cready. Nanda has stepped on the stage and I give her up the house.\r\nBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on musingly, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s awfully interesting. It IS the\r\nmodern daughter--we\xe2\x80\x99re really \xe2\x80\x98doing\xe2\x80\x99 her, the child and I; and as the\r\nmodern has always been my own note--I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone in, I mean, frankly for my\r\nvery own Time--who is one, after all, that one should pretend to decline\r\nto go where it may lead?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore was unprepared with an answer\r\nto this question, and his hostess continued in a different tone: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsweet her sparing one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, for the visitor, was firmer ground. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean about talking\r\nbefore her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s assent was positively tender. \xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t have a difference\r\nin my freedom. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if the dear thing KNEW, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? what we\r\nmust keep back. She wants us not to have to think. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite maternal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she mused again. Then as if with the pleasure of presenting it to him\r\nafresh: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the modern daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Cashmore, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help wishing she were a trifle less\r\nconsiderate. In that case I might find her with you, and I may tell you\r\nfrankly that I get more from her than I do from you. She has the great\r\nmerit for me, in the first place, of not being such an admirer of my\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham took this up with interest. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--you\xe2\x80\x99re right; she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t, as I do, SEE Lady Fanny, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are then, you inconsistent creature,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried with a laugh:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cafter all you DO believe me! You recognise how benighted it would be\r\nfor your daughter not to feel that Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too tiresome, my dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook returned, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your\r\nridiculous simplifications. Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s NOT \xe2\x80\x98bad\xe2\x80\x99; she\xe2\x80\x99s magnificently\r\ngood--in the sense of being generous and simple and true, too adorably\r\nunaffected and without the least mesquinerie. She\xe2\x80\x99s a great calm silver\r\nstatue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore showed, on this, something of the strength that comes from\r\nthe practice of public debate. \xe2\x80\x9cThen why are you glad your daughter\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t like her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook smiled as with the sadness of having too much to triumph.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99m not, like Fanny, without mesquinerie. I\xe2\x80\x99m not generous\r\nand simple. I\xe2\x80\x99m exaggeratedly anxious about Nanda. I care, in spite of\r\nmyself, for what people may say. Your wife doesn\xe2\x80\x99t--she towers above\r\nthem. I can be a shade less brave through the chance of my girl\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nhappening to feel her as the rest of us do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore too heavily followed. \xe2\x80\x9cTo \xe2\x80\x98feel\xe2\x80\x99 her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook floated over. \xe2\x80\x9cThere would be in that case perhaps something\r\nto hint to her not to shriek on the house-tops. When you say,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one admits, as regards Fanny, anything wrong, you\r\npervert dreadfully what one does freely grant--that she\xe2\x80\x99s a great\r\nglorious pagan. It\xe2\x80\x99s a real relief to know such a type--it\xe2\x80\x99s like a\r\nflash of insight into history. None the less if you ask me why then it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t all right for young things to \xe2\x80\x98shriek\xe2\x80\x99 as I say, I have my answer\r\nperfectly ready.\xe2\x80\x9d After which, as her visitor seemed not only too\r\nreduced to doubt it, but too baffled to distinguish audibly, for his\r\ncredit, between resignation and admiration, she produced: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurely instinctive. Her instincts are splendid--but it\xe2\x80\x99s terrific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all I ever maintained it to be!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt IS\r\nterrific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m watching her. We\xe2\x80\x99re all watching her.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like some great natural poetic thing--an Alpine sunrise or a big\r\nhigh tide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re amazing!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m watching her too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m also watching YOU!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook lucidly continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor a moment believe is that her bills are paid by any one. It\xe2\x80\x99s MUCH\r\nmore probable,\xe2\x80\x9d she sagaciously observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they\xe2\x80\x99re not paid at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well, if she can get on that way--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can\xe2\x80\x99t be a place in London,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot delighted to dress such a woman. She shows things, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\r\nas some fine tourist region shows the placards in the fields and the\r\nposters on the rocks. And what proof can you adduce?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore had grown restless; he picked a stray thread off the knee\r\nof his trousers. \xe2\x80\x9cAh when you talk about \xe2\x80\x98adducing\xe2\x80\x99--!\xe2\x80\x9d He appeared to\r\nintimate--as with the hint that if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t take care she might bore\r\nhim--that it was the kind of word he used only in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I talk about it you can\xe2\x80\x99t meet me,\xe2\x80\x9d she placidly returned. But she\r\nfixed him with her weary penetration. \xe2\x80\x9cYou try to believe what you CAN\xe2\x80\x99T\r\nbelieve, in order to give yourself excuses. And she does the same--only\r\nless, for she recognises less in general the need of them. She\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ngrand and simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Cashmore stared. \xe2\x80\x9cGrander and simpler than I, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham thought. \xe2\x80\x9cNot simpler--no; but very much grander. She\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, in the case you conceive, recognise really the need of WHAT\r\nyou conceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore wondered--it was almost mystic. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, seeing it all from dim depths, tracked it further and\r\nfurther. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve talked her over so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore groaned as if too conscious of it. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed we have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean WE\xe2\x80\x9d--and it was wonderful how her accent discriminated. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntalked you too--but of course we talk to every one.\xe2\x80\x9d She had a pause\r\nthrough which there glimmered a ray from luminous hours, the inner\r\nintimacy which, privileged as he was, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to share; then\r\nshe broke out almost impatiently: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re looking after her--leave her to\r\nUS!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis envy of this nearer approach to what so touched him than he could\r\nhimself achieve was in his face, but he tried to throw it off. \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt\r\nif after all you\xe2\x80\x99re good for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Brookenham knew. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s just the sort of person we ARE good\r\nfor, and the thing for her is to be with us as much as possible--just\r\nlive with us naturally and easily, listen to our talk, feel our\r\nconfidence in her, be kept up, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? by the sense of what we\r\nexpect of her splendid type, and so, little by little, let our influence\r\nact. What I meant to say just now is that I do perfectly see her taking\r\nwhat you call presents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you want more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook hung fire an instant--she seemed on the point of telling him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI DON\xe2\x80\x99T see her, as I said, recognising the obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe obligation--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo give anything back. Anything at all.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook was positive. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ncomprehension of petty calculations? Never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say the calculations are petty,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s a great creature. If she does fall--!\xe2\x80\x9d His hostess lost\r\nherself in the view, which was at last all before her. \xe2\x80\x9cBe sure we shall\r\nall know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid till we do. She would fall, as it were, on US,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you see? and,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, with decision this time in\r\nher headshake, \xe2\x80\x9cthat couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. We MUST keep her up--that\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nguarantee. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather too much,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with the same increase of\r\nbriskness, \xe2\x80\x9cto have to keep YOU up too. Be very sure that if Carrie\r\nreally wavers--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarrie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis interruption was clearly too vague to be sincere, and it was as such\r\nthat, going straight on, she treated it. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never again give\r\nher three minutes\xe2\x80\x99 attention. To answer to you for Fanny without being\r\nable--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo answer to Fanny for me, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d He had flushed quickly as if\r\nhe awaited her there. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suit you, you contend? Well then,\r\nI hope it will ease you off,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with spirit, \xe2\x80\x9cto know that I\r\nwholly LOATHE Mrs. Donner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, staring, met the announcement with an absolute change of\r\ncolour. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd since when, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if a fabric had crumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nwas here but the other day, and as full of you, poor thing, as an egg of\r\nmeat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore could only blush for her. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. My\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s a burden from her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing, for a spectator, could have been so odd as Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisappointment unless it had been her determination. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you done with\r\nher already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne has never done with a buzzing insect--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil one has literally killed it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham wailed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t take that from you, my dear man: it was yourself who originally\r\ndistilled the poison that courses through her veins.\xe2\x80\x9d He jumped up at\r\nthis as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear it, presenting as he walked across the room,\r\nhowever, a large foolish fugitive back on which her eyes rested as on a\r\nproof of her penetration. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you spoil everything by trying to deceive\r\nme, how can I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had looked, in his restlessness, at a picture or two, but he finally\r\nturned round. \xe2\x80\x9cWith whom is it you talk us over? With Petherton and his\r\nfriend Mitchy? With your adored Vanderbank? With your awful Duchess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know my little circle, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve not always despised it.\xe2\x80\x9d She met\r\nhim on his return with a figure that had visibly flashed out for her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t foul your own nest! Remember that after all we\xe2\x80\x99ve more or less\r\nproduced you.\xe2\x80\x9d She had a smile that attenuated a little her image, for\r\nthere were things that on a second thought he appeared ready to take\r\nfrom her. She patted the sofa as if to invite him again to be seated,\r\nand though he still stood before her it was with a face that seemed to\r\nshow how her touch went home. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I\xe2\x80\x99ve never quite thought you\r\ndo us full honour, but it was because SHE took you for one of us that\r\nCarrie first--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, to stop her, he dropped straight into the seat. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you\r\nthere has really been nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d With a continuation of his fidget he\r\npulled out his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t she come in at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Nanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk me over with HER!\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cif you like. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nMrs. Donner is dust and ashes to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do little\r\njustice to your daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to break it to me that you\xe2\x80\x99re in love with Nanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, but only as if to give weight to his reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAwfully. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how I like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray how will THAT help me? Help me, I mean, to help\r\nyou. Is it what I\xe2\x80\x99m to tell your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat looking away, but he evidently had his idea, which he at last\r\nproduced. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be just the thing? It would exactly prove my\r\npurity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere might have been in her momentary silence a hint of acceptance of\r\nit as a practical contribution to their problem, and there were indeed\r\nseveral lights in which it could be considered. Mrs. Brook, on a quick\r\nsurvey, selected the ironic. \xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see. I might by the same law\r\narrange somehow that Lady Fanny should find herself in love with Edward.\r\nThat would \xe2\x80\x98prove\xe2\x80\x99 HER purity. And you could be quite at ease,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nlaughed--\xe2\x80\x9che wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make any presents!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Cashmore regarded her with a candour that was almost a reproach to\r\nher mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cI like your daughter better than I like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it only amused her more. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that perhaps because _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t prove\r\nyour purity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat he might have replied remained in the air, for the door opened so\r\nexactly at the moment she spoke that he rose again with a start and\r\nthe butler, coming in, received her enquiry full in the face. This\r\nfunctionary\xe2\x80\x99s answer to it, however, had no more than the usual\r\nausterity. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanderbank and Mr. Longdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese visitors took a minute to appear, and Mrs. Brook, not\r\nstirring--still only looking from the sofa calmly up at Mr.\r\nCashmore--used the time, it might have seemed, for correcting any\r\nimpression of undue levity made by her recent question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you\r\nlast meet Nanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the door to see if he were heard. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the Grendons\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you do go there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went over from Hicks the other day for an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Carrie was there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It was a dreadful horrid bore. But I talked only to your\r\ndaughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up--the others were at hand--and offered Mr. Cashmore an\r\nexpression that might have struck him as strange. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSerious?\xe2\x80\x9d--he had no eyes for the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a sound, controlled by discretion, which sufficed none the less\r\nto make Mr. Longdon--beholding him for the first time--receive it with a\r\nlittle of the stiffness of a person greeted with a guffaw. Mr. Cashmore\r\nvisibly liked this silence of Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s about their meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham, who had introduced him to the elder of her visitors,\r\nhad also found in serving these gentlemen with tea, a chance to edge at\r\nhim with an intensity not to be resisted: \xe2\x80\x9cTalk to Mr. Longdon--take him\r\noff THERE.\xe2\x80\x9d She had indicated the sofa at the opposite end of the room\r\nand had set him an example by possessing herself, in the place she\r\nalready occupied, of her \xe2\x80\x9cadored\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank. This arrangement, however,\r\nconstituted for her, in her own corner, as soon as she had made it, the\r\nground of an appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cWill he hate me any worse for doing that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank glanced at the others. \xe2\x80\x9cWill Cashmore, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear no--I don\xe2\x80\x99t care whom HE hates. But with Mr. Longdon I want to\r\navoid mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t try quite so hard!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that your reason\r\nfor throwing him into Cashmore\xe2\x80\x99s arms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, precisely--so that I shall have these few moments to ask you for\r\ndirections: you must know him by this time so well. I only want, heaven\r\nhelp me, to be as nice to him as I possibly can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite the best thing for you and altogether why, this afternoon,\r\nI brought him: he might have better luck in finding you--it was he\r\nwho suggested it--than he has had by himself. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a general way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank added, \xe2\x80\x9cwatching over him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see--and he\xe2\x80\x99s watching over you.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s sweet vacancy had\r\nalready taken in so much. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to judge of what I may be doing to\r\nyou--he wants to save you from me. He quite detests me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, with the interest as well as the amusement, fairly threw\r\nhimself back. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody like you--you\xe2\x80\x99re too magnificent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI AM; and that I can look the truth in the face and not be angry or\r\nsilly about it is, as you know, the one thing in the world for which I\r\nthink a bit well of myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I know--I know; you\xe2\x80\x99re too wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham, in a brief pause, completed her covert consciousness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re doing beautifully--he\xe2\x80\x99s taking Cashmore with a seriousness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd with what is Cashmore taking him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the hope that from one moment to another Nanda may come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how on earth does that concern him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough an extraordinary fancy he has suddenly taken to her.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBrook had been swift to master the facts. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been meeting her at\r\nTishy\xe2\x80\x99s, and she has talked to him so effectually about his behaviour\r\nthat she has quite made him cease to care for Carrie. He prefers HER\r\nnow--and of course she\xe2\x80\x99s much nicer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s attention, it was clear, had now been fully seized. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmuch nicer. Rather! What you mean is,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the next moment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nNanda, this afternoon, has been the object of his call?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--really; though he tried to keep it from me. She makes him feel,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cso innocent and good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion for a moment said nothing; but then at last: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd WILL she\r\ncome in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know where she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she\xe2\x80\x99s with Tishy, who has returned to town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank turned this over. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that your system now--to ask no\r\nquestions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy SHOULD I ask any--when I want her life to be as much as possible\r\nlike my own? It\xe2\x80\x99s simply that the hour has struck, as you know. From the\r\nmoment she IS down the only thing for us is to live as friends. I think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s so vulgar,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to have the same good manners\r\nwith one\xe2\x80\x99s children as one has with other people. She asks ME nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused again; after which, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very disgusting!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. Then\r\nwhile she took it up as he had taken her word of a moment before, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery preposterous,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook appeared at a loss. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean her helping him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not of Nanda I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking--it\xe2\x80\x99s of him.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank spoke with a\r\ncertain impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cHis being with her in any sort of direct relation\r\nat all. His mixing her up with his other beastly affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook looked intelligent and wan about it, but also perfectly\r\ngood-humoured. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man, he and his affairs ARE such twaddle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank laughed in spite of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd does that make it any\r\nbetter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook thought, but presently had a light--she almost smiled with\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cFor US!\xe2\x80\x9d Then more woefully, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want Carrie to be saved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I? Not a jot. Carrie be hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s for Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook protested. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Carrie IS rescued it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na pretext the less for Fanny.\xe2\x80\x9d As the young man looked for an instant\r\nrather gloomily vague she softly quavered: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npositively WANT Fanny to bolt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo bolt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely I\xe2\x80\x99ve not to remind you at this time of day how Captain\r\nDent-Douglas is always round the corner with the post-chaise, and how\r\ntight, on our side, we\xe2\x80\x99re all clutching her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not let her go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, at this, showed real resentment. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go\xe2\x80\x99? Then what would\r\nbecome of us?\xe2\x80\x9d She recalled his wandering fancy. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the delight of\r\nour life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank sceptically murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the ornament of our circle,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will,\r\nshe won\xe2\x80\x99t--she won\xe2\x80\x99t, she will! It\xe2\x80\x99s the excitement, every day, of\r\nplucking the daisy over.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s attention, as she spoke, had\r\nattached itself across the room to Mr. Longdon; it gave her thus an\r\nimage of the way his imagination had just seemed to her to stray, and\r\nshe saw a reason in it moreover for her coming up in another place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he rather rich?\xe2\x80\x9d She allowed the question all its effect of\r\nabruptness.\r\n\r\nVanderbank looked round at her. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot after becoming so intimate? It\xe2\x80\x99s usually, with people, the very\r\nfirst thing I get my impression of.\xe2\x80\x9d There came into her face for\r\nanother glance at their friend no crudity of curiosity, but an\r\nexpression more tenderly wistful. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must have some mysterious box\r\nunder his bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown in Suffolk?--a miser\xe2\x80\x99s hoard? Who knows? I dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t a miser, but he strikes me as careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook meanwhile had thought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cThen he has something to be\r\ncareful of; it would take something really handsome to inspire in a man\r\nlike him that sort of interest. With his small expenses all these years\r\nhis savings must be immense. And how could he have proposed to mamma\r\nunless he had originally had money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Vanderbank a little helplessly wondered he also laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nremember your mother refused him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but not because there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--I imagine the force of the blow for him was just in the other\r\nreason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it would have been in that one just as much if that one had been\r\nthe other.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook was sagacious, though a trifle obscure, and she\r\npursued the next moment: \xe2\x80\x9cMamma was so sincere. The fortune was nothing\r\nto her. That shows it was immense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been as great as your logic,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank smiled; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nof course if it has been growing ever since--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see it grow while he sits there,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook declared. But her\r\nlogic had in fact its own law, and her next transition was an equal\r\njump. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was too lovely, the frankness of your admission a minute ago\r\nthat I affect him uncannily. Ah don\xe2\x80\x99t spoil it by explanations!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nbeautifully pleaded: \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s not the first and he won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last with\r\nwhom I shall not have been what they call a combination. The only thing\r\nthat matters is that I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t, if possible, make the case worse. So you\r\nmust guide me. What IS one to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, now amused again, looked at her kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cBe yourself, my\r\ndear woman. Obey your fine instincts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be,\xe2\x80\x9d she sweetly asked, \xe2\x80\x9cso hideously hypocritical? You\r\nknow as well as you sit there that my fine instincts are the thing in\r\nthe world you\xe2\x80\x99re most in terror of. \xe2\x80\x98Be myself?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d LIKE to say is: \xe2\x80\x98Be somebody else--that\xe2\x80\x99s your only chance.\xe2\x80\x99 Well,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll try--I\xe2\x80\x99ll try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed again, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t--don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean it\xe2\x80\x99s too hopeless? There\xe2\x80\x99s no way of effacing the bad\r\nimpression or of starting a good one?\xe2\x80\x9d On this, with a drop of his\r\nmirth, he met her eyes, and for an instant, through the superficial\r\nlevity of their talk, they might have appeared to sound each other. It\r\nlasted till Mrs. Brook went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI should really like not to lose him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank seemed to understand and at last said: \xe2\x80\x9cI think you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlose him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean you\xe2\x80\x99ll help me, Van, you WILL?\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice had at moments\r\nthe most touching tones of any in England, and humble, helpless,\r\naffectionate, she spoke with a familiarity of friendship. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for the\r\nsense of the link with mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s simply full of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know. He\xe2\x80\x99s prodigious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has told you more--he comes back to it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook eagerly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man replied a trifle evasively, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve had a great\r\ndeal of talk, and he\xe2\x80\x99s the jolliest old boy possible, and in short I\r\nlike him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook blandly, \xe2\x80\x9cand he likes you in return as much as\r\nhe despises me. That makes it all right--makes me somehow so happy for\r\nyou. There\xe2\x80\x99s something in him--what is it?--that suggests the oncle\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Amerique, the eccentric benefactor, the fairy godmother. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlittle of an old woman--but all the better for it.\xe2\x80\x9d She hung fire but an\r\ninstant before she pursued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we make him do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank at this was very blank. \xe2\x80\x9cDo for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can any one love you,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout wanting to show it in\r\nsome way? You know all the ways, dear Van,\xe2\x80\x9d she breathed, \xe2\x80\x9cin which I\r\nwant to show it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe might have known them, something suddenly fixed in his face appeared\r\nto say, but they were not what was, on this speech of hers, most\r\nimmediately present to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThat for instance is the tone not to take\r\nwith him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed with discouragement. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, only TELL me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then as he said nothing: \xe2\x80\x9cI must be more like mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis expression confessed to his feeling an awkwardness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re perhaps\r\nnot quite enough like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know that if he deplores me as I am now she would have done so\r\nquite as much; in fact probably, as seeing it nearer, a good deal more.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d have despised me even more than he. But if it\xe2\x80\x99s a question,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBrook went on, \xe2\x80\x9cof not saying what mamma wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, how can I know, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see, what she WOULD have said?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook became as wonderful as if\r\nshe saw in her friend\xe2\x80\x99s face some admiring reflexion of the fine freedom\r\nof mind that--in such a connexion quite as much as in any other--she\r\ncould always show. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I revere mamma just as much as he does,\r\nand there was everything in her to revere. But she was none the less in\r\nevery way a charming woman too, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, after all, do I? what\r\neven she--in their peculiar relation--may not have said to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s laugh came back. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good--very good. I return to my\r\nfirst idea. Try with him whatever comes into your head. You\xe2\x80\x99re a woman\r\nof genius after all, and genius mostly justifies itself. To make you\r\nright,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on pleasantly and inexorably, \xe2\x80\x9cmight perhaps be to make\r\nyou wrong. Since you HAVE so great a charm trust it not at all or all in\r\nall. That, I dare say, is all you can do. Therefore--yes--be yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese remarks were followed on either side by the repetition of a\r\nsomewhat intenser mutual gaze, though indeed the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had more\r\nthe air of meeting his friend\xe2\x80\x99s than of seeking them. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be YOU\r\ncertainly, Van,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook sadly brought forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you mean by that,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined in a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhypocritical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHypocritical?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m diplomatic and calculating--I don\xe2\x80\x99t show him how bad I am; whereas\r\nwith you he knows the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf this observation Mrs. Brook, whose eyes attached themselves again\r\nto Mr. Longdon, took at first no further notice than might have been\r\nindicated by the way it set her musing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Calculating\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d--she at last took him up. \xe2\x80\x9cOn what is there to\r\ncalculate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cif, as you just hinted, he\xe2\x80\x99s a blessing\r\nin disguise--! I perfectly admit,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m capable of\r\nsacrifices to keep on good terms with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid he\xe2\x80\x99ll bore you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--distinctly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99ll be worth it? Then,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook said as he appeared to assent,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll be worth a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d She continued to watch Mr. Longdon, who,\r\nwithout his glasses, stared straight at the floor while Mr. Cashmore\r\ntalked to him. She pursued, however, dispassionately enough: \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be\r\nof a narrowness--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent again. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall broaden him. YOU won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank heartily concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cBut none the less, as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve said, I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer attention was still fixed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be him you\xe2\x80\x99ll help. If you\xe2\x80\x99re to\r\nmake sacrifices to keep on good terms with him the first sacrifice will\r\nbe of me.\xe2\x80\x9d Then on his leaving this remark so long unanswered that she\r\nhad finally looked at him again: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly prepared for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if, jocosely enough, he had had time to make up his mind how\r\nto meet her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you have--when he loved my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing could have been droller than the gloom of her surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cYours\r\ntoo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the other day--out of delicacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham darkly thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHE didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same consideration deterred him. But if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I arranged with you, after meeting him here\r\nat dinner, that you should come to tea with him at my rooms--if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmention it then it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t learnt it early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook more deeply sounded this affair, but she spoke with the\r\nexaggerated mildness that was the form mostly taken by her gaiety. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas because of course it makes him out such a wretch! What becomes in\r\nthat case of his loyalty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo YOUR mother\xe2\x80\x99s memory? Oh it\xe2\x80\x99s all right--he has it quite straight.\r\nShe came later. Mine, after my father\xe2\x80\x99s death, had refused him. But you\r\nsee he might have been my stepfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham took it in, but she had suddenly a brighter light. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nmight have been my OWN father! Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cif his line is to\r\nlove the mothers why on earth doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he love ME? I\xe2\x80\x99m in all conscience\r\nenough of one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but isn\xe2\x80\x99t there in your case the fact of a daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nasked with a slight embarrassment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good does that do me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNanda? She told me he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like her any better than he likes me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank in his turn showed surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s really what she said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had on her return from your rooms a most unusual fit of frankness,\r\nfor she generally tells me nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9chow did she put it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook reflected--recovered it. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I like him awfully, but I am not\r\nin the least HIS idea.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis idea of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I asked her. Of the proper grandchild for mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Then after another pause: \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion gave him a deep look. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll make her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up, and on seeing him move Mr. Longdon also rose, so that, facing\r\neach other across the room, they exchanged a friendly signal or two.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTheir hostess\xe2\x80\x99s account of Mr. Cashmore\xe2\x80\x99s motive for his staying on was\r\nso far justified as that Vanderbank, while Mr. Longdon came over to Mrs.\r\nBrook, appeared without difficulty further to engage him. The lady in\r\nquestion meanwhile had drawn her old friend down, and her present method\r\nof approach would have interested an observer aware of the unhappy\r\nconviction she had just privately expressed. Some trace indeed of the\r\nglimpse of it enjoyed by Mr. Cashmere\xe2\x80\x99s present interlocutor might have\r\nbeen detected in the restlessness that Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s desire to keep the\r\nother pair uninterrupted was still not able to banish from his attitude.\r\nNot, however, that Mrs. Brook took the smallest account of it as she\r\nquickly broke out: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can we thank you enough, my dear man, for your\r\nextraordinary kindness?\xe2\x80\x9d The reference was vivid, yet Mr. Longdon looked\r\nso blank about it that she had immediately to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to dear\r\nVan, who has told us of your giving him the great happiness--unless he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo dreadfully mistaken--of letting him really know you. He\xe2\x80\x99s such a\r\ntremendous friend of ours that nothing so delightful can befall him\r\nwithout its affecting us in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d She had proceeded with\r\nconfidence, but suddenly she pulled up. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me he IS mistaken--I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d She challenged the pale old man with\r\na loveliness that was for the moment absolutely juvenile. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nletting him--really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s smile was queer. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent him. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a great\r\nhouse--to give orders to go over me. The kindness is Mr. Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken up, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, a great deal of his precious time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook was undiscouraged. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been talking\r\nwith me just now of nothing else. You may say,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nI who have kept him at it. So I have, for his pleasure\xe2\x80\x99s a joy to us. If\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent what he feels, you know, you can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent either what\r\nWE feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s face reflected for a minute something he could scarcely\r\nhave supposed her acute enough to make out, the struggle between his\r\nreal mistrust of her, founded on the unconscious violence offered by\r\nher nature to his every memory of her mother, and his sense on the other\r\nhand of the high propriety of his liking her; to which latter force his\r\ninterest in Vanderbank was a contribution, inasmuch as he was obliged\r\nto recognise on the part of the pair an alliance it would have been\r\ndifficult to explain at Beccles. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see the value of\r\nwhat your husband and you and I are in a position to do for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean because he\xe2\x80\x99s himself so clever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say that\xe2\x80\x99s at the bottom of my feeling\r\nso proud to be taken up by him. I think of the young men of MY time\r\nand see that he takes in more. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what you all do,\xe2\x80\x9d he rather\r\nhelplessly sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very, very wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe met him with an almost extravagant eagerness that the meeting should\r\nbe just where he wished. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take in everything, but I take in all\r\nI can. That\xe2\x80\x99s a great affair in London to-day, and I often feel as if\r\nI were a circus-woman, in pink tights and no particular skirts, riding\r\nhalf a dozen horses at once. We\xe2\x80\x99re all in the troupe now, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cand we must travel with the show. But when you say we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndifferent,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cthink, after all, of mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon stared. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s from her you ARE different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but she had an awfully fine mind. We\xe2\x80\x99re not cleverer than she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis conscious honest eyes looked away an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps enough\r\nfor the present that you\xe2\x80\x99re cleverer than I! I was very glad the other\r\nday,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cto make the acquaintance of your daughter. I hoped\r\nI should find her with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Brook cast about it was but for a few seconds. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she had known\r\nyou were coming she would certainly have been here. She wanted so to\r\nplease you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as her visitor took no further notice of this speech\r\nthan to ask if Nanda were out of the house she had to admit it as an\r\naggravation of failure; but she pursued in the next breath: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t care, but she raves about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared indeed at first not to care. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she eighteen?\xe2\x80\x9d--it was\r\noddly abrupt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to think. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be nearer twenty?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook audaciously\r\nreturned. She tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me all about your interview. I\r\nstayed away on purpose--I had my idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what WAS your idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought she\xe2\x80\x99d remind you more of mamma if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there. But she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlittle person who sees. Perhaps you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it, but she knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did she know?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Longdon, who was unable, however, to\r\nkeep from his tone a certain coldness which really deprived the question\r\nof its proper curiosity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook just showed the chill of it, but she had always her courage.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that you don\xe2\x80\x99t like her.\xe2\x80\x9d She had the courage of carrying off\r\nas well as of backing out. \xe2\x80\x9cShe too has her little place with the\r\ncircus--it\xe2\x80\x99s the way we earn our living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon said nothing for a moment and when he at last spoke it was\r\nalmost with an air of contradiction. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s your mother to the life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hostess, for three seconds, looked at him hard. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but with such\r\ndifferences! You\xe2\x80\x99ll lose it,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a headshake of pity.\r\n\r\nHe had his eyes only on Vanderbank. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my losses are my own affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then his face came back. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she tell you I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe indulgence in Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s view of his simplicity was marked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nthought you succeeded so in hiding it? No matter--she bears up. I think\r\nshe really feels a great deal as I do--that it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter how many of\r\nus you hate if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only go on feeling as you do about mamma. Show us\r\nTHAT--that\xe2\x80\x99s what we want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing could have expressed more the balm of reassurance, but the mild\r\ndrops had fallen short of the spot to which they were directed. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Show\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh how he had sounded the word! \xe2\x80\x9cI see--you DON\xe2\x80\x99T show. That\xe2\x80\x99s just what\r\nNanda saw you thought! But you can\xe2\x80\x99t keep us from knowing it--can\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nit in fact, I think, from affecting your own behaviour. You\xe2\x80\x99d be much\r\nworse to us if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for the still warm ashes of your old passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n It was an immense pity for Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s amusement that he was at this\r\nmoment too far off to fit to the expression of his old friend\xe2\x80\x99s face so\r\nmuch of the cause of it as had sprung from the deeply informed tone\r\nof Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s allusion. To what degree the speaker herself made the\r\nconnexion will never be known to history, nor whether as she went on she\r\nthought she bettered her case or she simply lost her head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe great\r\nthing for us is that we can never be for you quite like other ordinary\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the great thing for ME?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh for you, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, but small things--so small\r\nthat they can scarcely be worth the trouble of your making them out. Our\r\nbeing so happy that you\xe2\x80\x99ve come back to us--if only just for a glimpse\r\nand to leave us again, in no matter what horror, for ever; our positive\r\ndelight in your being exactly so different; the pleasure we have in\r\ntalking about you, and shall still have--or indeed all the more--even\r\nif we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you only to lose you: whatever all this represents for\r\nourselves it\xe2\x80\x99s for none of us to pretend to say how much or how little\r\nYOU may pick out of it. And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook wandered on, \xe2\x80\x9chowever much\r\nwe may disappoint you some little spark of the past can\xe2\x80\x99t help being\r\nin us--for the past is the one thing beyond all spoiling: there it is,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you think?--to speak for itself and, if need be, only OF itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She pulled up, but she appeared to have destroyed all power of speech in\r\nhim, so that while she waited she had time for a fresh inspiration. It\r\nmight perhaps frankly have been mentioned as on the whole her finest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it possible that if you once get the point of view of\r\nrealising that I KNOW--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held the note so long that he at last supplied a sound. \xe2\x80\x9cThat you\r\nknow what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that compared with her I\xe2\x80\x99m a poor creeping thing. I mean\xe2\x80\x9d--she\r\nhastened to forestall any protest of mere decency that would spoil her\r\nidea--\xe2\x80\x9cthat of course I ache in every limb with the certainty of my\r\ndreadful difference. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if I DIDN\xe2\x80\x99T know it, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\r\nThere it is as a matter of course: I\xe2\x80\x99ve helplessly but finally and\r\ncompletely accepted it. Won\xe2\x80\x99t THAT help you?\xe2\x80\x9d she so ingeniously\r\npleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if I tormented you with any recall of her\r\nwhatever. I can quite see how awful it would be for you if, with the\r\neffect I produce on you, I did have her lovely eyes or her distinguished\r\nnose or the shape of her forehead or the colour of her hair. Strange as\r\nit is in a daughter I\xe2\x80\x99m disconnected altogether, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nI MAY be a little saved for you by becoming thus simply out of\r\nthe question? Of course,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cyour real trial is poor\r\nNanda--she\xe2\x80\x99s likewise so fearfully out of it and yet she\xe2\x80\x99s so fearfully\r\nin it. And she,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook for a climax--\xe2\x80\x9cSHE doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA strange faint flush, while she talked, had come into Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, and, whatever effect, as she put it, she produced on him, it was\r\nclearly not that of causing his attention to wander. She held him at\r\nleast for weal or woe; his bright eyes grew brighter and opened into a\r\nstare that finally seemed to offer him as submerged in mere wonder. At\r\nlast, however, he rose to the surface, and he appeared to have lighted\r\nat the bottom of the sea on the pearl of the particular wisdom\r\nhe needed. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say there may be something in what you so\r\nextraordinarily suggest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe jumped at it as if in pleasant pain. \xe2\x80\x9cIn just letting me go--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at this he dropped. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt renewed her fear. \xe2\x80\x9cNot just for what I AM?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose from his place beside her, but looking away from her and with\r\nhis colour marked. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never let you go,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you angel!\xe2\x80\x9d She sprang up more quickly and the others were by this\r\ntime on their feet. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it!\xe2\x80\x9d she joyously cried to\r\nVanderbank; \xe2\x80\x9che likes me, or at least he can bear me--I\xe2\x80\x99ve found him the\r\nway; and now I don\xe2\x80\x99t care even if he SAYS I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she turned\r\nagain to her old friend. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can manage about Nanda--you needn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nsee her. She\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98down\xe2\x80\x99 now, but she can go up again. We can arrange it at\r\nany rate--c\xe2\x80\x99est la moindre des choses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour I protest,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cagainst anything\r\nof the sort! I defy you to \xe2\x80\x98arrange\xe2\x80\x99 that young lady in any such manner\r\nwithout also arranging ME. I\xe2\x80\x99m one of her greatest admirers,\xe2\x80\x9d he gaily\r\nannounced to Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\nVanderbank said nothing, and Mr. Longdon seemed to show he would have\r\npreferred to do the same: that visitor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes might have represented\r\nan appeal to him somehow to intervene, to show the due acquaintance,\r\nspringing from practice and wanting in himself, with the art of\r\nconversation developed to the point at which it could thus sustain a\r\nlady in the upper air. Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s silence might, without his mere kind\r\npacific look, have seemed almost inhuman. Poor Mr. Longdon had finally\r\nto do his own simple best. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you bring your daughter to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked of Mrs. Brookenham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh--that\xe2\x80\x99s an idea: will you bring her to see ME?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore\r\nagain broke out.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had only fixed Mr. Longdon with the air of unutterable\r\nthings. \xe2\x80\x9cYou angel, you angel!\xe2\x80\x9d--they found expression but in that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t need to ask you to bring her, do I?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank now said to his\r\nhostess. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my bragging all over the place of the\r\ngreat honour she did me the other day in appearing quite by herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite by herself? I say, Mrs. Brook!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore flourished on.\r\n\r\nIt was only now that she noticed him; which she did indeed but by\r\nanswering Vanderbank. \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t go for YOU I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid--though of\r\ncourse she might: she went because you had promised her Mr. Longdon. But\r\nI should have no more feeling about her going to you--and should expect\r\nher to have no more--than about her taking a pound of tea, as she\r\nsometimes does, to her old nurse, or her going to read to the old women\r\nat the workhouse. May you never have less to brag of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish she\xe2\x80\x99d bring ME a pound of tea!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cOr ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI enough of an old woman for her to come and read to me at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she habitually visit the workhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon enquired of Mrs.\r\nBrook.\r\n\r\nThis lady kept him in a moment\xe2\x80\x99s suspense, which another contemplation\r\nmight moreover have detected that Vanderbank in some degree shared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery Friday at three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, with a sudden turn, moved straight to one of the windows,\r\nand Mr. Cashmore had a happy remembrance. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is Friday--she must\r\nhave gone to-day. But does she stay so late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was to go afterwards to little Aggie: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying so, in spite of\r\ndifficulties,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook explained, \xe2\x80\x9cto keep them on together.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\naddressed herself with a new thought to Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know\r\nlittle Aggie--the niece of the Duchess: I forget if you\xe2\x80\x99ve met the\r\nDuchess, but you must know HER too--there are so many things on which\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99ll feel with you. Little Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s the one,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll delight in her; SHE ought to have been mamma\xe2\x80\x99s grandchild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest lady, how can you pretend or for a moment compare her--?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nCashmore broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says nothing to me at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says nothing to any one,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook serenely replied; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nher type and her charm--just above all her education.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she appealed\r\nto Vanderbank. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Longdon be struck with little Aggie and won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe find it interesting to talk about all that sort of thing with the\r\nDuchess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank came back laughing, but Mr. Longdon anticipated his reply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of thing do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole question, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? of bringing\r\ngirls forward or not. The question of--well, what do you call it?--their\r\nexposure. It\xe2\x80\x99s THE question, it appears--the question--of the future;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s awfully interesting and the Duchess at any rate is great on it.\r\nNanda of course is exposed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook pursued--\xe2\x80\x9cfearfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what on earth is she exposed to?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore gaily demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s exposed to YOU, it would seem, my dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nspoke with a certain discernible impatience not so much of the fact he\r\nmentioned as of the turn of their talk.\r\n\r\nIt might have been in almost compassionate deprecation of this weak\r\nnote that Mrs. Brookenham looked at him. Her own reply to Mr. Cashmere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestion, however, was uttered at Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s exposed--it\xe2\x80\x99s much\r\nworse--to ME. But Aggie isn\xe2\x80\x99t exposed to anything--never has been and\r\nnever is to be; and we\xe2\x80\x99re watching to see if the Duchess can carry it\r\nthrough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Cashmore, \xe2\x80\x9cif there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing she CAN be exposed to\r\nbut the Duchess herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had appealed to his companions impartially, but Mr. Longdon, whose\r\nattention was now all for his hostess, appeared unconscious. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall watching is it your idea that I should watch WITH you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe enquiry, on his lips, was a waft of cold air, the sense of which\r\nclearly led Mrs. Brook to put her invitation on the right ground. \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\nof course on the chance of anything\xe2\x80\x99s happening to the dear child--to\r\nwhom nothing obviously CAN happen but that her aunt will marry her off\r\nin the shortest possible time and in the best possible conditions. No,\r\nthe interest is much more in the way the Duchess herself steers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she\xe2\x80\x99s in a boat,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore fully concurred, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will take a\r\ngood bit of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is not for Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s historian to overlook that if he was, not\r\nunnaturally, mystified he was yet also visibly interested. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat boat is\r\nshe in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had addressed his curiosity, with politeness, to Mr. Cashmore, but\r\nthey were all arrested by the wonderful way in which Mrs. Brook managed\r\nto smile at once very dimly, very darkly, and yet make it take them all\r\nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI think YOU must tell him, Van.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d--and Van again retreated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99LL tell him like a shot--if you really give me leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nCashmore, for whom any scruple referred itself manifestly not to the\r\nsubject of the information but to the presence of a lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI DON\xe2\x80\x99T give you leave and I beg you\xe2\x80\x99ll hold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBrookenham returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou handle such matters with a minuteness--! In\r\nshort,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke off to Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9che would tell you a good\r\ndeal more than you\xe2\x80\x99ll care to know. She IS in a boat--but she\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nexperienced mariner. Basta, as she would say. Do you know Mitchy?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBrook suddenly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, he knows Mitchy\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank had approached again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen make HIM tell him\xe2\x80\x9d--she put it before the young man as a charming\r\nturn for them all. \xe2\x80\x9cMitchy CAN be refined when he tries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear--when Mitchy \xe2\x80\x98tries\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I should\r\nrather, for the job, offer him to Mr. Longdon abandoned to his native\r\nwild impulse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI LIKE Mr. Mitchett,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said, endeavouring to look his\r\nhostess straight in the eye and speaking as if somewhat to defy her to\r\nconvict him, even from the point of view of Beccles, of a mistake.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brookenham took it with a wonderful bright emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nfriend, vous me rendez la vie! If you can stand Mitchy you can stand any\r\nof us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour I should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore was eager to remark.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth do you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded of Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cby saying that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m more \xe2\x80\x98minute\xe2\x80\x99 than he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her beauty an instant on this critic. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmore minute--I say he\xe2\x80\x99s more brilliant. Besides, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you\r\nbefore, you\xe2\x80\x99re not one of us.\xe2\x80\x9d With which, as a check to further\r\ndiscussion, she went straight on to Mr. Longdon: \xe2\x80\x9cThe point about\r\nAggie\xe2\x80\x99s conservative education is the wonderful sincerity with which\r\nthe Duchess feels that one\xe2\x80\x99s girl may so perfectly and consistently be\r\nhedged in without one\xe2\x80\x99s really ever (for it comes to that) depriving\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s own self--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of what?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon boldly demanded while his hostess appeared\r\nthoughtfully to falter.\r\n\r\nShe addressed herself mutely to Vanderbank, in whom the movement\r\nproduced a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI defy you,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cto say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you don\xe2\x80\x99t defy ME!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore cried as Mrs. Brook failed to\r\ntake up the challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you know Mitchy,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on to Mr. Longdon,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou must know Petherton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder man remained vague and not imperceptibly cold. \xe2\x80\x9cPetherton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother-in-law--whom, God knows why, Mitchy runs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuns?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon again echoed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook appealed afresh to Vanderbank. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we ought to spare\r\nhim. I may not remind you of mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued to their companion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying how much you remind me.\r\nExplanations, after all, spoil things, and if you CAN make anything of\r\nus and will sometimes come back you\xe2\x80\x99ll find everything in its native\r\nfreshness. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see, you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon stood before her and raised to Vanderbank, when she had\r\nceased, the eyes he had attached to the carpet while she talked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nmust I go now?\xe2\x80\x9d Explanations, she had said, spoiled things, but he might\r\nhave been a stranger at an Eastern court--comically helpless without his\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mrs. Brook desires to \xe2\x80\x98spare\xe2\x80\x99 you,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank kindly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nbest way to make sure of it would perhaps indeed be to remove you. But\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t we a hope of Nanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be of use for us to wait for her?\xe2\x80\x9d--it was still to his young\r\nfriend that Mr. Longdon put it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh when she\xe2\x80\x99s once on the loose--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brookenham sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless la voila,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as a hand was heard at the door-latch. It\r\nwas only, however, a footman who entered with a little tray that, on\r\nhis approaching his mistress, offered to sight the brown envelope of\r\na telegram. She immediately took leave to open this missive, after\r\nthe quick perusal of which she had another vision of them all. \xe2\x80\x9cIt IS\r\nshe--the modern daughter. \xe2\x80\x98Tishy keeps me dinner and opera; clothes\r\nall right; return uncertain, but if before morning have latch-key.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t come home till morning!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think of the comfort of the latch-key!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmight go to the opera,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHanged if _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon appeared to have caught from Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s message an obscure\r\nagitation; he met his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion at all events with a\r\nvisible intensity. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you go with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank had just debated, recalling engagements; which gave Mrs.\r\nBrook time to intervene. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you live without him?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked of her\r\nelder friend.\r\n\r\nVanderbank had looked at her an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I can get there late,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he then replied to Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think _I_ can get there early,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore declared. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Grendon\r\nmust have a box; in fact I know which, and THEY don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he jocosely\r\ncontinued to his hostess.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook meanwhile had given Mr. Longdon her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, in any case\r\nthe child SHALL soon come to you. And oh alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted: \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t make phrases--I know too well what I\xe2\x80\x99m about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hopes really you do,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the unquenched Mr. Cashmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s what one gets by having known your mother--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have helped YOU\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd won\xe2\x80\x99t you have\r\nto say it\xe2\x80\x99s ALL you were to get?\xe2\x80\x9d she pityingly murmured to her other\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Vanderbank with a strange gasp, and that comforter said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIFTH. THE DUCHESS\r\n\r\nThe lower windows of the great white house, which stood high and\r\nsquare, opened to a wide flagged terrace, the parapet of which, an old\r\nbalustrade of stone, was broken in the middle of its course by a flight\r\nof stone steps that descended to a wonderful garden. The terrace had the\r\nafternoon shade and fairly hung over the prospect that dropped away and\r\ncircled it--the prospect, beyond the series of gardens, of scattered\r\nsplendid trees and green glades, an horizon mainly of woods. Nanda\r\nBrookenham, one day at the end of July, coming out to find the place\r\nunoccupied as yet by other visitors, stood there a while with an air\r\nof happy possession. She moved from end to end of the terrace, pausing,\r\ngazing about her, taking in with a face that showed the pleasure of a\r\nbrief independence the combination of delightful things--of old rooms\r\nwith old decorations that gleamed and gloomed through the high windows,\r\nof old gardens that squared themselves in the wide angles of old walls,\r\nof wood-walks rustling in the afternoon breeze and stretching away\r\nto further reaches of solitude and summer. The scene had an expectant\r\nstillness that she was too charmed to desire to break; she watched it,\r\nlistened to it, followed with her eyes the white butterflies among the\r\nflowers below her, then gave a start as the cry of a peacock came to\r\nher from an unseen alley. It set her after a minute into less difficult\r\nmotion; she passed slowly down the steps, wandering further, looking\r\nback at the big bright house but pleased again to see no one else\r\nappear. If the sun was still high enough she had a pink parasol. She\r\nwent through the gardens one by one, skirting the high walls that were\r\nso like \xe2\x80\x9ccollections\xe2\x80\x9d and thinking how, later on, the nectarines and\r\nplums would flush there. She exchanged a friendly greeting with a man\r\nat work, passed through an open door and, turning this way and that,\r\nfinally found herself in the park, at some distance from the house. It\r\nwas a point she had had to take another rise to reach, a place marked\r\nby an old green bench for a larger sweep of the view, which, in the\r\ndistance where the woods stopped, showed in the most English way in the\r\nworld the colour-spot of an old red village and the tower of an old\r\ngrey church. She had sunk down upon the bench almost with a sense of\r\nadventure, yet not too fluttered to wonder if it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been\r\nhappy to bring a book; the charm of which precisely would have been in\r\nfeeling everything about her too beautiful to let her read.\r\n\r\nThe sense of adventure grew in her, presently becoming aware of a stir\r\nin the thicket below, followed by the coming into sight, on a path that,\r\nmounting, passed near her seat, of a wanderer whom, had his particular,\r\nhis exceptional identity not quickly appeared, it might have\r\ndisappointed her a trifle to have to recognise as a friend. He saw her\r\nimmediately, stopped, laughed, waved his hat, then bounded up the slope\r\nand, brushing his forehead with his handkerchief, confessing as to a\r\nred face, was rejoicingly there before her. Her own ejaculation on first\r\nseeing him--\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Van!\xe2\x80\x9d--had had an ambiguous sharpness that was\r\nrather for herself than for her visitor. She made room for him on\r\nthe bench, where in a moment he was cooling off and they were both\r\nexplaining. The great thing was that he had walked from the station to\r\nstretch his legs, coming far round, for the lovely hour and the pleasure\r\nof it, by a way he had learnt on some previous occasion of being at\r\nMertle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve already stayed here then?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda, who had arrived but half\r\nan hour before, spoke as if she had lost the chance to give him a new\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed here--yes, but not with Mitchy; with some people or\r\nother--who the deuce can they have been?--who had the place for a few\r\nmonths a year or two ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you even remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank wondered and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will come to me. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncharming sign of London relations, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?--that one CAN come down to\r\npeople this way and be awfully well \xe2\x80\x98done for\xe2\x80\x99 and all that, and then\r\ngo away and lose the whole thing, quite forget to whom one has been\r\nbeholden. It\xe2\x80\x99s a queer life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda seemed for an instant to wish to say that one might deny the\r\nqueerness, but she said something else instead. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose a man\r\nlike you doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite feel that he IS beholden. It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully good of\r\nhim--it\xe2\x80\x99s doing a great deal for anybody--that he should come down at\r\nall; so that it would add immensely to his burden if anybody had to be\r\nremembered for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by a man \xe2\x80\x98like me,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank returned.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not any particular kind of a man.\xe2\x80\x9d She had been looking at him, but\r\nshe looked away on this, and he continued good-humoured and explanatory.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean that I go about such a lot, how do you know it but by the\r\nfact that you\xe2\x80\x99re everywhere now yourself?--so that, whatever I am, in\r\nshort, you\xe2\x80\x99re just as bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou admit then that you ARE everywhere. I may be just as bad,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the point is that I\xe2\x80\x99m not nearly so good. Girls are such\r\nnatural hacks--they can\xe2\x80\x99t be anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray what are fellows who are in the beastly grind of fearfully\r\nbusy offices? There isn\xe2\x80\x99t an old cabhorse in London that\xe2\x80\x99s kept at it,\r\nI assure you, as I am. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man added, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\xe2\x80\x99m out every\r\nnight and off somewhere like this for Sunday, can\xe2\x80\x99t you understand, my\r\ndear child, the fundamental reason of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda, with her eyes on him again, studied an instant this mystery.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to infer with delight that it\xe2\x80\x99s the sweet hope of meeting ME? It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cas if there were any necessity\r\nfor your saying that. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use?\xe2\x80\x9d But all impatiently she stopped\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nHe was eminently gay even if his companion was not. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause we\xe2\x80\x99re such\r\njolly old friends that we really needn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as speak at all? Yes,\r\nthank goodness--thank goodness.\xe2\x80\x9d He had been looking round him, taking\r\nin the scene; he had dropped his hat on the ground and, completely at\r\nhis ease, though still more wishing to show it, had crossed his legs and\r\nclosely folded his arms. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a tremendously jolly place! If I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor the life of me recall who they were--the other people--I\xe2\x80\x99ve the\r\ncomfort of being sure their minds are an equal blank. Do they even\r\nremember the place they had? \xe2\x80\x98We had some fellows down at--where was it,\r\nthe big white house last November?--and there was one of them, out of\r\nthe What-do-you-call-it?--YOU know--who might have been a decent enough\r\nchap if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t presumed so on his gifts.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank paused a\r\nminute, but his companion said nothing, and he pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does show,\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?--the fact that we do meet this way--the tremendous change\r\nthat has taken place in your life in the last three months. I mean, if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m everywhere as you said just now, your being just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--you see what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, what I\xe2\x80\x99VE done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou plunge into the woods for change, for solitude,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the first thing you do is to find me waylaying you in the depths of\r\nthe forest. But I really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t--if you\xe2\x80\x99ll reflect upon it--know you\r\nwere coming this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat there with his position unchanged but with a constant little\r\nshake in the foot that hung down, as if everything--and what she now put\r\nbefore him not least--was much too pleasant to be reflected on. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I\r\nsmoke a cigarette?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda waited a little; her friend had taken out his silver case, which\r\nwas of ample form, and as he extracted a cigarette she put forth her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cMay _I_?\xe2\x80\x9d She turned the case over with admiration.\r\n\r\nVanderbank demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you smoke with Mr. Longdon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmensely. But what has that to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, everything.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke with a faint ring of impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant you to do with me exactly as you do with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s soon said!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl replied in a peculiar tone. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you\r\nmean, to \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then to BE. What shall I say?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank pleasantly wondered\r\nwhile his foot kept up its motion. \xe2\x80\x9cTo feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued to handle the cigarette-case, without, however, having\r\nprofited by its contents. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that as regards Mr. Longdon and\r\nme you know quite so much as you suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank laughed and smoked. \xe2\x80\x9cI take for granted he tells me\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but you scarcely take for granted _I_ do!\xe2\x80\x9d She rubbed her cheek an\r\ninstant with the polished silver and again the next moment turned over\r\nthe case. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the kind of one I should like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion glanced down at it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy it holds twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I want one that holds twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank only threw out his smoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI want so to give you something,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, in my relief at lighting on an object that will\r\ndo, I will, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t look out, give you either that or a pipe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean this particular one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had it for years--but even that one if you like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept it--continued to finger it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd by whom was it given you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this he turned to her smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten that too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly you must have forgotten, to be willing to give it away\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you know it was a present?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch things always are--people don\xe2\x80\x99t buy them for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had now relinquished the object, laying it upon the bench, and\r\nVanderbank took it up. \xe2\x80\x9cIts origin\xe2\x80\x99s lost in the night of time--it has\r\nno history except that I\xe2\x80\x99ve used it. But I assure you that I do want to\r\ngive you something. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never given you anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent a little. \xe2\x80\x9cThe exhibition you\xe2\x80\x99re making,\xe2\x80\x9d she seriously\r\nsighed at last, \xe2\x80\x9cof your inconstancy and superficiality! All the relics\r\nof you that I\xe2\x80\x99ve treasured and that I supposed at the time to have meant\r\nsomething!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98relics\xe2\x80\x99? Have you a lock of my hair?\xe2\x80\x9d Then as her meaning came to\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x9cOh little Christmas things? Have you really kept them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaid away in a drawer of their own--done up in pink paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you\xe2\x80\x99re coming to,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve given ME\r\nthings, and you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to convict me of having lost the sweet sense\r\nof them. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. Where my heart\xe2\x80\x99s concerned I\xe2\x80\x99m a walking\r\nreliquary. Pink paper? _I_ use gold paper--and the finest of all,\r\nthe gold paper of the mind.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave a flip with a fingernail to his\r\ncigarette and looked at its quickened fire; after which he pursued very\r\nfamiliarly, but with a kindness that of itself qualified the mere humour\r\nof the thing: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk, my dear child, as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know\r\nme for the best friend you have in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d As soon as he had spoken\r\nhe pulled out his watch, so that if his words had led to something of a\r\npause this movement offered a pretext for breaking it. Nanda asked the\r\nhour and, on his replying \xe2\x80\x9cFive-fifteen,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked that there would now\r\nbe tea on the terrace with every one gathered at it. \xe2\x80\x9cThen shall we go\r\nand join them?\xe2\x80\x9d her companion demanded.\r\n\r\nHe had made, however, no other motion, and when after hesitating she\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cYes, with pleasure\xe2\x80\x9d it was also without a change of position. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlike this,\xe2\x80\x9d she inconsequently added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I awfully. Tea on the terrace,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank went on, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98in\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit. But who\xe2\x80\x99s here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh every one. All your set.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine? Have I still a set--with the universal vagabondism you accuse me\r\nof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s--whoever they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd nobody of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda said, \xe2\x80\x9call mine. He must at least have arrived by this\r\ntime. My set\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Longdon,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s all of it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where in the world am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99re an extra. There are always extras.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA complete set and one over?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere then\xe2\x80\x99s Tishy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharming and grave, the girl thought a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s in Paris with\r\nher mother--on their way to Aix-les-Bains.\xe2\x80\x9d Then with impatience she\r\ncontinued: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal to say--what you said just\r\nnow? I mean about your being the best friend I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why I said it. You see I\xe2\x80\x99m not in\r\nthe least delicate or graceful or shy about it--I just come out with\r\nit and defy you to contradict me. Who, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not the best, is a better\r\none?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel since I\xe2\x80\x99ve known Mr. Longdon that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalmost the sort of friend who makes every one else not count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen at the end of three months he has arrived at a value for you that\r\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached in all these years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned--\xe2\x80\x9cthe value of my not being afraid of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, on the bench, shifted his position, turning more to her and\r\nthrowing an arm over the back. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of ME?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorribly--hideously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen our long, our happy relations--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re just what makes my terror,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly abject.\r\nHappy relations don\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I always think of you with fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis elbow rested on the back and his hand supported his head. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nawfully curious--if it be true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had been looking away to the sweet English distance, but at this she\r\nmade a movement. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Mr. Van, I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x98true\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Van himself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have expressed at any subsequent time to any\r\ninterested friend the particular effect upon him of the tone of these\r\nwords his chronicler takes advantage of the fact not to pretend to a\r\ngreater intelligence--to limit himself on the contrary to the\r\nsimple statement that they produced in Mr. Van\xe2\x80\x99s cheek a flush just\r\ndiscernible. \xe2\x80\x9cFear of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Fear is fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes--I see.\xe2\x80\x9d He took out another cigarette and occupied a moment\r\nin lighting it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, kindness is kindness too--that\xe2\x80\x99s all one can\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had smoked again a while before she turned to him. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I wounded\r\nyou by saying that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA certain effect of his flush was still in his smile. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me\r\nI should like you to wound me. I did what I wanted a moment ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued with some precipitation: \xe2\x80\x9cI brought you out handsomely on the\r\nsubject of Mr. Longdon. That was my idea--just to draw you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, looking away again, \xe2\x80\x9che has come into my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come into a place where it gives me more pleasure to\r\nsee him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like, the other day when I used it to him, that\r\nexpression,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl returned. \xe2\x80\x9cHe called it \xe2\x80\x98mannered modern slang\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand came back again to the extraordinary difference between my speech\r\nand my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man understandingly assented. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I rather like\r\nyour speech. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he by this time, with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9ccrossed the\r\ngulf? He has with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh with you there was no gulf. He liked you from the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean I managed him so well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you managed him, but liking me has been for him a\r\npainful gradual process. I think he does now,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda declared. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\naccepts me at last as different--he\xe2\x80\x99s trying with me on that basis. He\r\nhas ended by understanding that when he talks to me of Granny I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven imagine her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank puffed away. \xe2\x80\x9cI can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Mitchy says too. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve both probably got her wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve gone into it a good deal. But\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s too late. We can\xe2\x80\x99t be Greeks if we would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven for this Nanda had no laugh, though she had a quick attention. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou call Granny a Greek?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion slowly rose. \xe2\x80\x9cYes--to finish her off handsomely and have\r\ndone with her.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked again at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we go? I want to\r\nsee if my man and my things have turned up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept her seat; there was something to revert to. \xe2\x80\x9cMy fear of you\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t superficial. I mean it isn\xe2\x80\x99t immediate--not of you just as you\r\nstand,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of some dreadfully possible future you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, smiling down at her, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t forget that\r\nif there\xe2\x80\x99s to be such a monster there\xe2\x80\x99ll also be a future you,\r\nproportionately developed, to deal with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had closed her parasol in the shade and her eyes attached themselves\r\nto the small hole she had dug in the ground with its point. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall\r\nboth have moved, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s charming to feel we shall probably have moved together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh if moving\xe2\x80\x99s changing,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthere won\xe2\x80\x99t be much for me in\r\nthat. I shall never change--I shall be always just the same. The same\r\nold mannered modern slangy hack,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued quite gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nLongdon has made me feel that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank laughed aloud, and it was especially at her seriousness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, upon my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I am I must remain. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t what\xe2\x80\x99s called\r\na principle of growth.\xe2\x80\x9d Making marks in the earth with her umbrella she\r\nappeared to cipher it out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m about as good as I can be--and about as\r\nbad. If Mr. Longdon can\xe2\x80\x99t make me different nobody can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank could only speak in the tone of high amusement. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he has\r\ngiven up the hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--though not ME altogether. He has given up the hope he originally\r\nhad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gives up quickly--in three months!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh these three months,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9chave been a long time: the\r\nfullest, the most important, for what has happened in them, of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She still poked at the ground; then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all thanks to YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fancy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, for what we were speaking of just now--my being to-day so in\r\neverything and squeezing up and down no matter whose staircase. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\none crowded hour of glorious life?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat preceded it was an\r\nage, no doubt--but an age without a name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank watched her a little in silence, then spoke quite beside\r\nthe question. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing how at moments you remind me of your\r\nmother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this she got up. \xe2\x80\x9cAh there it is! It\xe2\x80\x99s what I shall never shake off.\r\nThat, I imagine, is what Mr. Longdon feels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth on their feet now, as if ready for the others, they yet--and even\r\na trifle awkwardly--lingered. It might in fact have appeared to a\r\nspectator that some climax had come, on the young man\xe2\x80\x99s part, to some\r\nstate of irresolution about the utterance of something. What were the\r\nwords so repeatedly on his lips, yet so repeatedly not sounded? It would\r\nhave struck our observer that they were probably not those his lips\r\neven now actually formed. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t he perhaps talk to you too much about\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda gave him a dim smile, and he might indeed then have exclaimed on a\r\ncertain resemblance, a resemblance of expression that had nothing to\r\ndo with form. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been diminished for him moreover by her\r\nsuccessful suppression of every sign that she felt his question a little\r\nof a snub. The recall he had previously mentioned could, however, as she\r\nanswered him, only have been brushed away by a supervening sense of his\r\nroughness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much that as my own way of going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She spoke with a mildness that could scarce have been so full without\r\nbeing an effort. \xe2\x80\x9cBetween his patience and my egotism anything\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossible. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t his talking--it\xe2\x80\x99s his listening.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave up the\r\npoint, at any rate, as if from softness to her actual companion. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit you who spoke to mamma about my sitting with her? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean\r\nby my debt to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s through you that I\xe2\x80\x99m always there--through you\r\nand perhaps a little through Mitchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh through Mitchy--it MUST have been--more than through me.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nspoke with the manner of humouring her about a trifle. \xe2\x80\x9cMitchy,\r\ndelightful man, felt on the subject of your eternal exile, I think,\r\nstill more strongly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey quitted their place together and at the end of a few steps became\r\naware of the approach of one of the others, a figure but a few yards\r\noff, arriving from the quarter from which Nanda had come. \xe2\x80\x9cAh Mr.\r\nLongdon!\xe2\x80\x9d--she spoke with eagerness now.\r\n\r\nVanderbank instantly waved his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cDear old boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween you all, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said more gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve brought me\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank made no answer till they met their friend, when, by way of\r\ngreeting, he simply echoed her words. \xe2\x80\x9cBetween us all, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to\r\nknow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve brought her down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked from one of them to the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been\r\ntogether?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda was the first to respond. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly talking--on a bench.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _I_ want to talk on a bench!\xe2\x80\x9d Their friend showed a spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith me, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank met it with encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe girl said nothing, but Mr. Longdon sought her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--with Nanda.\r\nYou must mingle in the crowd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d the their companion laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou two are the crowd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--have your tea first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank on this, giving it up with the air of amused accommodation\r\nthat was never--certainly for these two--at fault in him, offered to\r\nMr. Longdon before departing the handshake of greeting he had omitted; a\r\ndemonstration really the warmer for the tone of the joke that went with\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cIntrigant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNanda praised to the satellite so fantastically described the charming\r\nspot she had quitted, with the effect that they presently took fresh\r\npossession of it, finding the beauty of the view deepened as the\r\nafternoon grew old and the shadows long. They were of a comfortable\r\nagreement on these matters, by which moreover they were but little\r\ndelayed, one of the pair at least being too conscious, for the hour, of\r\nstill other phenomena than the natural and peaceful process that filled\r\nthe air. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must tell me about these things,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon\r\nsociably said: he had joined his young friend with a budget of\r\nimpressions rapidly gathered at the house; as to which his appeal to\r\nher for a light or two may be taken as the measure of the confidence now\r\nruling their relations. He had come to feel at last, he mentioned, that\r\nhe could allow for most differences; yet in such a situation as the\r\npresent bewilderment could only come back. There were no differences in\r\nthe world--so it had all ended for him--but those that marked at every\r\nturn the manners he had for three months been observing in good society.\r\nThe general wide deviation of this body occupied his mind to the\r\nexclusion of almost everything else, and he had finally been brought to\r\nbelieve that even in his slow-paced prime he must have hung behind his\r\ncontemporaries. He had not supposed at the moment--in the fifties and\r\nthe sixties--that he passed for old-fashioned, but life couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nleft him so far in the rear had the start between them originally been\r\nfair. This was the way he had more than once put the matter to the girl;\r\nwhich gives a sufficient hint, it is hoped, of the range of some\r\nof their talk. It had always wound up indeed, their talk, with some\r\nassumption of the growth of his actual understanding; but it was just\r\nthese pauses in the fray that seemed to lead from time to time to a\r\nsharper clash. It was apt to be when he felt as if he had exhausted\r\nsurprises that he really received his greatest shocks. There were no\r\nsuch queer-tasting draughts as some of those yielded by the bucket that\r\nhad repeatedly, as he imagined, touched the bottom of the well. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nthis sudden invasion of somebody\xe2\x80\x99s--heaven knows whose--house, and our\r\ndropping down on it like a swarm of locusts: I dare say it isn\xe2\x80\x99t civil\r\nto criticise it when one\xe2\x80\x99s going too, so almost culpably, with the\r\nstream; but what are people made of that they consent, just for money,\r\nto the violation of their homes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda wondered; she cultivated the sense of his making her intensely\r\nreflect, \xe2\x80\x9cBut haven\xe2\x80\x99t people in England always let their places?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re a nation of shopkeepers, you mean, it can\xe2\x80\x99t date, on the scale\r\non which we show it, only from last week? No doubt, no doubt, and the\r\nmore one thinks of it the more one seems to see that society--for we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nIN society, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we, and that\xe2\x80\x99s our horizon?--can never have been\r\nanything but increasingly vulgar. The point is that in the twilight of\r\ntime--and I belong, you see, to the twilight--it had made out much less\r\nhow vulgar it COULD be. It did its best very probably, but there were\r\ntoo many superstitions it had to get rid of. It has been throwing them\r\noverboard one by one, so that now the ship sails uncommonly light.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way\xe2\x80\x9d--and with his eyes on the golden distance he ingeniously\r\nfollowed it out--\xe2\x80\x9cI come to feel so the lurching and pitching. If I\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t a pretty fair sailor--well, as it is, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted\r\nhimself with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI show you often enough what grabs I make for\r\nsupport.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave a faint gasp, half amusement, half anguish, then\r\nabruptly relieved himself by a question. \xe2\x80\x9cTo whom in point of fact does\r\nthe place belong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully ashamed, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. That just came up\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl went on, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Mr. Van.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon seemed to think an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cOh it came up, did it? And Mr.\r\nVan couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has quite forgotten--though he has been here before. Of course it\r\nmay have been with other people,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in extenuation. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean it\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t have been theirs then any more than it\xe2\x80\x99s Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. They too had just bundled in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda completed the simple history. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day it\xe2\x80\x99s Mitchy who bundles, and\r\nI believe that really he bundled only yesterday. He turned in his people\r\nand here we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are, here we are!\xe2\x80\x9d her friend more gravely echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsplendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if at a note in his voice her eyes, while his own still strayed\r\naway, just fixed him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s really rather exciting?\r\nEverything\xe2\x80\x99s ready, the feast all spread, and with nothing to blunt\r\nour curiosity but the general knowledge that there will be people\r\nand things--with nothing but that we comfortably take our places.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nanswered nothing, though her picture apparently reached him. \xe2\x80\x9cThere ARE\r\npeople, there ARE things, and all in a plenty. Had every one, when you\r\ncame away, turned up?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked as he was still silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say. There were some ladies and gentlemen on the terrace whom\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. But I looked only for you and came this way on an\r\nindication of your mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did she ask that if you should find me with Mr. Van you\xe2\x80\x99d make him\r\ncome to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon replied to this with some delay and without movement. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ncould she have supposed he was here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince he had not yet been to the house? Oh it has always been a wonder\r\nto me, the things that mamma supposes! I see she asked you,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\nAt this her old friend turned to her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because of that I\r\ngot rid of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind everything mamma says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind \xe2\x80\x98everything\xe2\x80\x99 anybody says: not even, my dear, when the\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she waited an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cNot even when it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Van?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon candidly considered. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I take him up on all sorts of\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shows then the importance they have for you. Is HE like his\r\ngrandmother?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl pursued. Then as her companion looked vague:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it his grandmother too you knew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had an extraordinary smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHis mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed, colouring, on her mistake, and he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so bad\r\nas that. But you\xe2\x80\x99re none of you like them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t she pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery handsome. But it makes no difference. She herself to-day wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a small gasp. \xe2\x80\x9cHis own mother wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis headshake just failed of sharpness. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, nor he her. There\xe2\x80\x99s a link\r\nmissing.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as if after all she might take him too seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse it\xe2\x80\x99s I,\xe2\x80\x9d he more gently moralised, \xe2\x80\x9cwho have lost the link in my\r\nsleep. I\xe2\x80\x99ve slept half the century--I\xe2\x80\x99m Rip Van Winkle.\xe2\x80\x9d He went back\r\nafter a moment to her question. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not at any rate like his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think so much of her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. At all events my snatching you from Mr. Vanderbank was my\r\nown idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda said, \xe2\x80\x9cof your snatching me. I was thinking\r\nof your snatching yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have sent YOU to the house? Well,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI find\r\nI take more and more the economical view of my pleasures. I run them\r\nless and less together. I get all I can out of each.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo now you\xe2\x80\x99re getting all you can out of ME?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can, my dear--all I can.\xe2\x80\x9d He watched a little the flushed\r\ndistance, then mildly broke out: \xe2\x80\x9cIt IS, as you said just now, exciting!\r\nBut it makes me\xe2\x80\x9d--and he became abrupt again--\xe2\x80\x9cwant you, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve already\r\ntold you, to come to MY place. Not, however, that we may be still more\r\nmad together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl shared from the bench his contemplation. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call THIS\r\nmadness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, he rather stuck to it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke of it yourself as excitement.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll make of course one of your fine distinctions, but I take it in my\r\nrough way as a whirl. We\xe2\x80\x99re going round and round.\xe2\x80\x9d In a minute he had\r\nfolded his arms with the same closeness Vanderbank had used--in a minute\r\nhe too was nervously shaking his foot. \xe2\x80\x9cSteady, steady; if we sit close\r\nwe shall see it through. But come down to Suffolk for sanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do mean then that I may come alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t receive you, I assure you, on any other terms. I want to show\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat life CAN give. Not of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he subjoined,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cof this sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--you\xe2\x80\x99ve told me. Of peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf peace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you don\xe2\x80\x99t know--you haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least\r\nidea. That\xe2\x80\x99s just why I want to show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda looked as if already she saw it in the distance. \xe2\x80\x9cBut will it be\r\npeace if I\xe2\x80\x99m there? I mean for YOU,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a question of \xe2\x80\x98me.\xe2\x80\x99 Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s omelet is made of somebody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neggs. Besides, I think that when we\xe2\x80\x99re alone together--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had dropped for so long that she wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, when we are--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it will be all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he simply concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cTemples of peace, the\r\nancients used to call them. We\xe2\x80\x99ll set up one, and I shall be at least\r\ndoorkeeper. You\xe2\x80\x99ll come down whenever you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave herself to him in her silence more than she could have done in\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you arranged it with mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, however, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSHE won\xe2\x80\x99t want to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friend\xe2\x80\x99s laugh turned him to her. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be nervous. There are\r\nthings as to which your mother trusts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut others as to which not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met for some time on this, and it ended in his saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nyou must help me.\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda, but without shrinking, looked away again, and\r\nMr. Longdon, as if to consecrate their understanding by the air of ease,\r\npassed to another subject. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mitchett\xe2\x80\x99s the most princely host.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he too kind for anything? Do you know what he pretends?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says in the most extraordinary way that he does it all for\r\nME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTakes this great place and fills it with servants and company--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just so that I may come down for a Sunday or two. Of course he\r\nhas only taken it for three or four weeks, but even for that time it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na handsome compliment. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care what he does. It\xe2\x80\x99s his way of\r\namusing himself. He amuses himself at our expense,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope that makes up, my dear, for the rate at which we\xe2\x80\x99re doing\r\nso at his!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis amusement,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cis to see us believe what he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon thought a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, my child, you\xe2\x80\x99re most acute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I haven\xe2\x80\x99t watched life for nothing! Mitchy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nHer companion seemed divided between a desire to draw and a certain fear\r\nto encourage her. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe considered an instant, all coherently, and it might have added to\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s impression of her depth. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, for himself. I mean for\r\nhis money. For anything any one may think. For Lord Petherton,\r\nfor instance, really at all. Lord Petherton thinks he has helped\r\nhim--thinks, that is, that Mitchy thinks he has. But Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\namused at HIM than at anybody else. He takes every one in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one but you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor child, you\xe2\x80\x99re of a profundity!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon murmured.\r\n\r\nHe spoke almost uneasily, but she was not too much alarmed to continue\r\nlucid. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he likes me, and I know just how much--and just how little.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s the most generous man in the world. It pleases him to feel that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s indifferent and splendid--there are so many things it makes up\r\nto him for.\xe2\x80\x9d The old man listened with attention, and his young friend\r\nconscious of it, proceeded as on ground of which she knew every inch.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the son, as you know, of a great bootmaker--\xe2\x80\x98to all the Courts of\r\nEurope\xe2\x80\x99--who left him a large fortune, which had been made, I believe,\r\nin the most extraordinary way, by building-speculations as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d her companion sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he should be of such extraction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, everything. That you should be talking as you are--that you\r\nshould have \xe2\x80\x98watched life,\xe2\x80\x99 as you say, to such purpose. That we should\r\nany of us be here--most of all that Mr. Mitchett himself should. That\r\nyour grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s daughter should have brought HER daughter--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo stay with a person\xe2\x80\x9d--Nanda took it up as, apparently out of\r\ndelicacy, he fairly failed--\xe2\x80\x9cwhose father used to take the measure,\r\ndown on his knees on a little mat, as mamma says, of my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nremarkably large foot? Yes, we none of us mind. Do you think we should?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Nanda asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll answer you by a question. Would you\r\nmarry him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as if to show there was no weakness in her mildness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never, never,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I dare say you know--?\xe2\x80\x9d But Mr. Longdon once more faltered; his\r\nscruple came uppermost. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my speaking of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf his thinking he wants to marry me? Not a bit. I positively enjoy\r\ntelling you there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even for HIM?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda considered. \xe2\x80\x9cNot more than is made up to him by his having\r\nfound out through talks and things--which mightn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise have\r\noccurred--that I do like him. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come down here if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nliked him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for any other reason?\xe2\x80\x9d--Mr. Longdon put it gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for YOUR being here, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe delayed. \xe2\x80\x9cMe and other persons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed somehow that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t flinch. \xe2\x80\x9cYou weren\xe2\x80\x99t asked till\r\nafter he had made sure I\xe2\x80\x99d come. We\xe2\x80\x99ve become, you and I,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cone of the couples who are invited together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese were couples, his speculative eye seemed to show, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nyet know about, and if he mentally took them up a moment it was all\r\npromptly to drop them. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you state it quite strongly\r\nenough, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Mitchy IS hard hit? He states it so strongly himself that it\r\nwill surely do for both of us. I\xe2\x80\x99m a part of what I just spoke of--his\r\nindifference and magnificence. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if he could only afford to do\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s not vulgar. He might perfectly marry a duke\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, but that\r\nWOULD be vulgar--would be the absolute necessity and ideal of nine out\r\nof ten of the sons of shoemakers made ambitious by riches. Mitchy says\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; I take my own line; I go in for a beggar-maid.\xe2\x80\x99 And it\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m a beggar-maid that he wants me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are plenty of other beggar-maids,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I admit I\xe2\x80\x99m the one he least dislikes. But if I had any money,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Nanda went on, \xe2\x80\x9cor if I were really good-looking--for that to-day, the\r\nreal thing, will do as well as being a duke\xe2\x80\x99s daughter--he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nnear me. And I think that ought to settle it. Besides, he must marry\r\nAggie. She\xe2\x80\x99s a beggar-maid too--as well as an angel. So there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nagainst it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon stared, but even in his surprise seemed to take from\r\nthe swiftness with which she made him move over the ground a certain\r\nagreeable glow. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes \xe2\x80\x98Aggie\xe2\x80\x99 like him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe likes every one. As I say, she\xe2\x80\x99s an angel--but a real, real, real\r\none. The kindest man in the world\xe2\x80\x99s therefore the proper husband for\r\nher. If Mitchy wants to do something thoroughly nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared with\r\nthe same high competence, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll take her out of her situation, which is\r\nawful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked graver. \xe2\x80\x9cIn what way awful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d His eye was now cold enough to give her, in her\r\nchill, a flurried sense that she might displease him least by a graceful\r\nlightness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Duchess and Lord Petherton are like you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a conundrum?\xe2\x80\x9d He was serious indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re one of the couples who are invited together.\xe2\x80\x9d But his face\r\nreflected so little success for her levity that it was in another tone\r\nshe presently added: \xe2\x80\x9cMitchy really oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Her friend, in silence,\r\nfixed his eyes on the ground; an attitude in which there was something\r\nto make her strike rather wild. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course, kind as he is, he can\r\nscarcely be called particular. He has his ideas--he thinks nothing\r\nmatters. He says we\xe2\x80\x99ve all come to a pass that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon remained mute a while, and when he at last, raised his eyes\r\nit was without meeting Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s and with some dryness of manner. \xe2\x80\x9cThe end\r\nof everything? One might easily receive that impression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe again became mute, and there was a pause between them of some length,\r\naccepted by Nanda with an anxious stillness that it might have touched a\r\nspectator to observe. She sat there as if waiting for some further sign,\r\nonly wanting not to displease her friend, yet unable to pretend to play\r\nany part and with something in her really that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take back\r\nnow, something involved in her original assumption that there was to\r\nbe a kind of intelligence in their relation. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at\r\nlast, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I make allusions you don\xe2\x80\x99t like. But I keep forgetting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited a moment longer, then turned to her with a look rendered a\r\ntrifle strange by the way it happened to reach over his glasses. It was\r\neven austerer than before. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep forgetting what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave after an instant a faint feeble smile which seemed to speak of\r\nhelplessness and which, when at rare moments it played in her face, was\r\nexpressive from her positive lack of personal, superficial diffidence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if appearances became at times\r\nso complicated that--so far as helping others to understand was\r\nconcerned--she could only give up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want you to be with me as you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be--so\r\nto speak--with yourself. I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to\r\nbe frank. If you were to try to APPEAR to me anything--!\xe2\x80\x9d He ended in\r\nsimple sadness: that, for instance, would be so little what he should\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything different, you mean, from what I am? That\xe2\x80\x99s just what I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nthought from the first. One\xe2\x80\x99s just what one IS--isn\xe2\x80\x99t one? I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nso much,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cin one\xe2\x80\x99s character or temper--for they have,\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t they? to be what\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x98properly controlled\xe2\x80\x99--as in one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind and what one sees and feels and the sort of thing one notices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Nanda paused an instant; then \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she simply but rather\r\ndesperately brought out.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon considered this with visible intensity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you suggest is\r\nthat the things you speak of depend on other people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, every one isn\xe2\x80\x99t so beautiful as you.\xe2\x80\x9d She had met him with\r\npromptitude, yet no sooner had she spoken than she appeared again to\r\nencounter a difficulty. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there it is--my just saying even that. Oh\r\nhow I always know--as I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you before--whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m different!\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to tell me the things Granny WOULD have said, because\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s simply arranging to keep myself back from you, and so being\r\nnasty and underhand, which you naturally don\xe2\x80\x99t want, nor I either.\r\nNevertheless when I say the things she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, then I put before you\r\ntoo much--too much for your liking it--what I know and see and feel. If\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re both partly the result of other people, HER other people were\r\nso different.\xe2\x80\x9d The girl\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive boldness kept it up, but there was\r\nsomething in her that pleaded for patience. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet if she had YOU, so\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got you too. It\xe2\x80\x99s the flattery of that, or the sound of it, I know,\r\nthat must be so unlike her. Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully like mother; yet it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t as if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t already let me see--is it?--that you don\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\nthink me the same.\xe2\x80\x9d Again she stopped a minute, as to find her scarce\r\npossible way with him, and again for the time he gave no sign. She\r\nstruck out once more with her strange cool limpidity. \xe2\x80\x9cGranny wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nkind of girl she COULDN\xe2\x80\x99t be--and so neither am I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had fallen while she talked into something that might have\r\nbeen taken for a conscious temporary submission to her; he had uncrossed\r\nhis fidgety legs and, thrusting them out with the feet together, sat\r\nlooking very hard before him, his chin sunk on his breast and his hands,\r\nclasped as they met, rapidly twirling their thumbs. So he remained for\r\na time that might have given his young friend the sense of having made\r\nherself right for him so far as she had been wrong. He still had all her\r\nattention, just as previously she had had his, but, while he now simply\r\ngazed and thought, she watched him with a discreet solicitude that would\r\nalmost have represented him as a near relative whom she supposed unwell.\r\nAt the end he looked round, and then, obeying some impulse that had\r\ngathered in her while they sat mute, she put out to him the tender hand\r\nshe might have offered to a sick child. They had been talking about\r\nfrankness, but she showed a frankness in this instance that made him\r\nperceptibly colour. To that in turn, however, he responded only the more\r\ncompletely, taking her hand and holding it, keeping it a long minute\r\nduring which their eyes met and something seemed to clear up that had\r\nbeen too obscure to be dispelled by words. Finally he brought out as\r\nif, though it was what he had been thinking of, her gesture had most\r\ndetermined him: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish immensely you\xe2\x80\x99d get married!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis tone betrayed so special a meaning that the words had a sound of\r\nsuddenness; yet there was always in Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s face that odd preparedness\r\nof the young person who has unlearned surprise through the habit, in\r\ncompany, of studiously not compromising her innocence by blinking at\r\nthings said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow CAN I?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, but appearing rather to take up the\r\nproposal than to put it by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you, CAN\xe2\x80\x99T you?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke pressingly and kept her hand. She shook\r\nher head slowly, markedly; on which he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t do justice\r\nto Mr. Mitchy.\xe2\x80\x9d She said nothing, but her look was there and it made him\r\nresume: \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d At this, letting her go, Mr. Longden got up; he pulled out\r\nhis watch. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must go back.\xe2\x80\x9d She had risen with him and they stood face\r\nto face in the faded light while he slipped the watch away. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me wish it any less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lovely of you to wish it, but I shall be one of the people who\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t. I shall be at the end,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cone of those who haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned gravely--\xe2\x80\x9cyou shall never be anything so\r\nsad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not--if YOU\xe2\x80\x99VE been?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her a little, quietly, and then,\r\nputting out his hand, passed her own into his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cExactly because I\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess said to him the next day, \xe2\x80\x9cbe for five minutes\r\nawfully kind to my poor little niece?\xe2\x80\x9d The words were spoken in charming\r\nentreaty as he issued from the house late on the Sunday afternoon--the\r\nsecond evening of his stay, which the next morning was to bring to an\r\nend--and on his meeting the speaker at one of the extremities of the\r\nwide cool terrace. There was at this point a subsidiary flight of steps\r\nby which she had just mounted from the grounds, one of her purposes\r\nbeing apparently to testify afresh to the anxious supervision of little\r\nAggie she had momentarily suffered herself to be diverted from. This\r\nyoung lady, established in the pleasant shade on a sofa of light\r\nconstruction designed for the open air, offered the image of a patience\r\nof which it was a questionable kindness to break the spell. It was that\r\nbeautiful hour when, toward the close of the happiest days of summer,\r\nsuch places as the great terrace at Mertle present to the fancy a recall\r\nof the banquet-hall deserted--deserted by the company lately gathered at\r\ntea and now dispersed, according to affinities and combinations promptly\r\nfelt and perhaps quite as promptly criticised, either in quieter\r\nchambers where intimacy might deepen or in gardens and under trees where\r\nthe stillness knew the click of balls and the good humour of games.\r\nThere had been chairs, on the terrace, pushed about; there were\r\nungathered teacups on the level top of the parapet; the servants in\r\nfact, in the manner of \xe2\x80\x9chands\xe2\x80\x9d mustered by a whistle on the deck of a\r\nship, had just arrived to restore things to an order soon again to be\r\nbroken. There were scattered couples in sight below and an idle group\r\non the lawn, out of the midst of which, in spite of its detachment,\r\nsomebody was sharp enough sometimes to cry \xe2\x80\x9cOut!\xe2\x80\x9d The high daylight was\r\nstill in the sky, but with just the foreknowledge already of the long\r\ngolden glow in which the many-voiced caw of the rooks would sound at\r\nonce sociable and sad. There was a great deal all about to be aware of\r\nand to look at, but little Aggie had her eyes on a book over which her\r\npretty head was bent with a docility visible even from afar. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nfriend--down there by the lake--to go back to,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m on my way to my room to get a letter that I\xe2\x80\x99ve promised to show\r\nhim. I shall immediately bring it down and then in a few minutes be\r\nable to relieve you,--I don\xe2\x80\x99t leave her alone too much--one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, you\r\nknow, in a house full of people, a child of that age. Besides\xe2\x80\x9d--and Mr.\r\nLongdon\xe2\x80\x99s interlocutress was even more confiding--\xe2\x80\x9cI do want you so very\r\nintensely to know her. You, par exemple, you\xe2\x80\x99re what I SHOULD like to\r\ngive her.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon looked the noble lady, in acknowledgement of her\r\nappeal, straight in the face, and who can tell whether or no she acutely\r\nguessed from his expression that he recognised this particular juncture\r\nas written on the page of his doom?--whether she heard him inaudibly\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cAh here it is: I knew it would have to come!\xe2\x80\x9d She would at any rate\r\nhave been astute enough, had this miracle occurred, quite to complete\r\nhis sense for her own understanding and suffer it to make no difference\r\nin the tone in which she still confronted him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I take the bull by\r\nthe horns--I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to know me. If you had you\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\ncalled on me--I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you plenty of hints and little coughs. Now, you\r\nsee, I don\xe2\x80\x99t cough any more--I just rush at you and grab you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncall on me--so I call on YOU. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t any indecency moreover that I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t commit for my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s impenetrability crashed like glass at the elbow-touch\r\nof this large handsome practised woman, who walked for him, like some\r\nbrazen pagan goddess, in a cloud of queer legend. He looked off at her\r\nchild, who, at a distance and not hearing them, had not moved. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s a great friend of Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Nanda told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften--taking such an interest in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad she thinks so then--though really her interests are so\r\nvarious. But come to my baby. I don\xe2\x80\x99t make HER come,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained as\r\nshe swept him along, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I want you just to sit down by her there\r\nand keep the place, as one may say--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, for whom?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded as she stopped. It was her step that had\r\nchecked itself as well as her tongue, and again, suddenly, they stood\r\nquite consciously and vividly opposed. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I trust you?\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess\r\nbrought out. Again then she took herself up. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as if I weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalready doing it! It\xe2\x80\x99s because I do trust you so utterly that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen able any longer to keep my hands off you. The person I want the\r\nplace for is none other than Mitchy himself, and half my occupation now\r\nis to get it properly kept for him. Lord Petherton\xe2\x80\x99s immensely kind, but\r\nLord Petherton can\xe2\x80\x99t do everything. I know you really like our host--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, at this, interrupted her with a certain coldness. \xe2\x80\x9cHow, may\r\nI ask, do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut with a brazen goddess to deal with--! This personage had to fix him\r\nbut an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause, you dear honest man, you\xe2\x80\x99re here. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe if you hated him, for you don\xe2\x80\x99t practically condone--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time he broke in with his eyes on the child. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel on the\r\ncontrary, I assure you, that I condone a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t boast of your cynicism,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, \xe2\x80\x9ctill you\xe2\x80\x99re sure of\r\nall it covers. Let the right thing for you be,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Nanda\r\nherself wants it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNanda herself?\xe2\x80\x9d He continued to watch little Aggie, who had never yet\r\nturned her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe swept him on again. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come to you presently and explain. I MUST\r\nget my letter for Petherton; after which I\xe2\x80\x99ll give up Mitchy, whom I was\r\ngoing to find, and since I\xe2\x80\x99ve broken the ice--if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too much to\r\nsay to such a polar bear!--I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you le fond de ma pensee. Baby\r\ndarling,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her niece, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep Mr. Longdon. Show him,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nbenevolently suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading.\xe2\x80\x9d Then again to her\r\nfellow guest, as arrested by this very question: \xe2\x80\x9cCaro signore, have YOU\r\na possible book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Aggie had got straight up and was holding out her volume, which\r\nMr. Longdon, all courtesy for her, glanced at. \xe2\x80\x9cStories from English\r\nHistory. Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis ejaculation, though vague, was not such as to prevent the girl from\r\nventuring gently: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, receiving her pure little smile, showed he felt he had\r\nnever so taken her in as at this moment, as well as also that she was a\r\nperson with whom he should surely get on. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I must have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Aggie was still more encouraged, but not to the point of keeping\r\nanything back. \xe2\x80\x9cIt hasn\xe2\x80\x99t any author. It\xe2\x80\x99s anonymous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess borrowed, for another question to Mr. Longdon, not a little\r\nof her gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x9d--his answer was to Aggie. \xe2\x80\x9cThere have been some horrid\r\nthings in English history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh horrid--HAVEN\xe2\x80\x99T there?\xe2\x80\x9d Aggie, whose speech had the prettiest\r\nfaintest foreignness, sweetly and eagerly quavered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, darling, Mr. Longdon will recommend to you some nice historical\r\nwork--for we love history, don\xe2\x80\x99t we?--that leaves the horrors out. We\r\nlike to know,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess explained to the authority she invoked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ncheerful happy RIGHT things. There are so many, after all, and this is\r\nthe place to remember them. A tantot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she passed into the house by the nearest of the long windows that\r\nstood open Mr. Longdon placed himself beside her little charge, whom he\r\ntreated, for the next ten minutes, with an exquisite courtesy. A person\r\nwho knew him well would, if present at the scene, have found occasion\r\nin it to be freshly aware that he was in his quiet way master of two\r\ndistinct kinds of urbanity, the kind that added to distance and the kind\r\nthat diminished it. Such an analyst would furthermore have noted, in\r\nrespect to the aunt and the niece, of which kind each had the benefit,\r\nand might even have gone so far as to detect in him some absolute\r\nbetrayal of the impression produced on him by his actual companion, some\r\nirradiation of his certitude that, from the point of view under which\r\nshe had been formed, she was a remarkable, a rare success. Since to\r\ncreate a particular little rounded and tinted innocence had been aimed\r\nat, the fruit had been grown to the perfection of a peach on a sheltered\r\nwall, and this quality of the object resulting from a process might well\r\nmake him feel himself in contact with something wholly new. Little Aggie\r\ndiffered from any young person he had ever met in that she had been\r\ndeliberately prepared for consumption and in that furthermore the\r\ngentleness of her spirit had immensely helped the preparation. Nanda,\r\nbeside her, was a Northern savage, and the reason was partly that the\r\nelements of that young lady\xe2\x80\x99s nature were already, were publicly, were\r\nalmost indecorously active. They were practically there for good or for\r\nill; experience was still to come and what they might work out to still\r\na mystery; but the sum would get itself done with the figures now on the\r\nslate. On little Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s slate the figures were yet to be written; which\r\nsufficiently accounted for the difference of the two surfaces. Both\r\nthe girls struck him as lambs with the great shambles of life in\r\ntheir future; but while one, with its neck in a pink ribbon, had no\r\nconsciousness but that of being fed from the hand with the small sweet\r\nbiscuit of unobjectionable knowledge, the other struggled with instincts\r\nand forebodings, with the suspicion of its doom and the far-borne scent,\r\nin the flowery fields, of blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Nanda, she\xe2\x80\x99s my best friend after three or four others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter so many?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think that\xe2\x80\x99s rather a\r\nback seat, as they say, for one\xe2\x80\x99s best?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA back seat?\xe2\x80\x9d--she wondered with a purity!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion, \xe2\x80\x9cit serves me right, as\r\nyour aunt didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me with you to teach you the slang of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98slang\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d--she again spotlessly speculated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never even heard the expression? I should think that a great\r\ncompliment to our time if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t that I fear it may have been only\r\nthe name that has been kept from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe light of ignorance in the child\xe2\x80\x99s smile was positively golden. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d she again echoed.\r\n\r\nShe understood too little--he gave it up. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who are all the other\r\nbest friends whom poor Nanda comes after?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s my aunt, and Miss Merriman, and Gelsomina, and Dr.\r\nBeltram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who, please, is Miss Merriman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s my governess, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?--but such a deliciously easy\r\ngoverness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, I suppose, is because she has such a deliciously easy pupil. And\r\nwho is Gelsomina?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s my old nurse--my old maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. Well, one must always be kind to old maids. But who\xe2\x80\x99s Dr.\r\nBeltram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the most intimate friend of all. We tell him everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was for Mr. Longdon in this, with a slight incertitude, an effect\r\nof drollery. \xe2\x80\x9cYour little troubles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh they\xe2\x80\x99re not always so little! And he takes them all away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways?--on the spot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSooner or later,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Aggie with serenity. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be very plain sailing.\xe2\x80\x9d Decidedly\r\nshe was, as Nanda had said, an angel, and there was a wonder in her\r\npossession on this footing of one of the most expressive little faces\r\nthat even her expressive race had ever shown him. Formed to express\r\neverything, it scarce expressed as yet even a consciousness. All the\r\nelements of play were in it, but they had nothing to play with. It was a\r\nrest moreover, after so much that he had lately been through, to be with\r\na person for whom questions were so simple. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he sounds all the same\r\nlike the kind of doctor whom, as soon as one hears of him, one wants to\r\nsend for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl had at this a small light of confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor for medicine. He\xe2\x80\x99s a clergyman--and my aunt says he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsaint. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ve many in England,\xe2\x80\x9d little Aggie continued to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany saints? I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not. Your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s very happy to know one. We\r\nshould call Dr. Beltram in England a priest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but he\xe2\x80\x99s English. And he knows everything we do--and everything we\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99--your aunt, your governess and your nurse? What a varied wealth of\r\nknowledge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh Miss Merriman and Gelsomina tell him only what they like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you and the Duchess tell him what you DON\xe2\x80\x99T like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh often--but we always like HIM--no matter what we tell him. And we\r\nknow that just the same he always likes us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see then of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon, very gravely now, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a\r\nfriend he must be. So it\xe2\x80\x99s after all this,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued in a moment,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Nanda comes in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion had to consider, but suddenly she caught assistance. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\none, I think, comes before.\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Petherton, arriving apparently from\r\nthe garden, had drawn near unobserved by Mr. Longdon and the next moment\r\nwas within hail. \xe2\x80\x9cI see him very often,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued--\xe2\x80\x9coftener\r\nthan Nanda. Oh but THEN Nanda. And then,\xe2\x80\x9d little Aggie wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nMitchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m glad HE comes in,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthough rather far down\r\nin the list.\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Petherton was now before them, there being no one\r\nelse on the terrace to speak to, and, with the odd look of an excess of\r\nphysical power that almost blocked the way, he seemed to give them in\r\nthe flare of his big teeth the benefit of a kind of brutal geniality.\r\nIt was always to be remembered for him that he could scarce show without\r\nsurprising you an adjustment to the smaller conveniences; so that when\r\nhe took up a trifle it was not perforce in every case the sign of an\r\nuncanny calculation. When the elephant in the show plays the fiddle it\r\nmust be mainly with the presumption of consequent apples; which was\r\nwhy, doubtless, this personage had half the time the air of assuring\r\nyou that, really civilised as his type had now become, no apples were\r\nrequired. Mr. Longdon viewed him with a vague apprehension and as if\r\nquite unable to meet the question of what he would have called for such\r\na personage the social responsibility. Did this specimen of his class\r\npull the tradition down or did he just take it where he found it--in the\r\nvery different place from that in which, on ceasing so long ago to \xe2\x80\x9cgo\r\nout,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon had left it? Our friend doubtless averted himself\r\nfrom the possibility of a mental dilemma; if the man didn\xe2\x80\x99t lower the\r\nposition was it the position then that let down the man? Somehow he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t positively up. More evidence would be needed to decide; yet\r\nit was just of more evidence that one remained rather in dread. Lord\r\nPetherton was kind to little Aggie, kind to her companion, kind to\r\nevery one, after Mr. Longdon had explained that she was so good as to be\r\ngiving him the list of her dear friends. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only a little dismayed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the elder man said, \xe2\x80\x9cto find Mr. Mitchett at the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but it\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully short list, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? If it consists only of\r\nme and Mitchy he\xe2\x80\x99s not so very low down. We don\xe2\x80\x99t allow her very MANY\r\nfriends; we look out too well for ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d He addressed the child\r\nas on an easy jocose understanding. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the question, Aggie, whether we\r\nshall allow you Mr. Longdon? Won\xe2\x80\x99t that rather \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99 for us--for Mitchy\r\nand me? I say, Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on as this lady reappeared, \xe2\x80\x9cARE we\r\ngoing to allow her Mr. Longdon and do we quite realise what we\xe2\x80\x99re about?\r\nWe mount guard awfully, you know\xe2\x80\x9d--he carried the joke back to the\r\nperson he had named. \xe2\x80\x9cWe sift and we sort, we pick the candidates over,\r\nand I should like to hear any one say that in this case at least I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nkeep a watch on my taste. Oh we close in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess, the object of her quest in her hand, had come back. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\r\nthen Mr. Longdon will close WITH us--you\xe2\x80\x99ll consider henceforth that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s as safe as yourself. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the letter I wanted you to read--with\r\nwhich you\xe2\x80\x99ll please take a turn, in strict charge of the child, and then\r\nrestore her to us. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t come I shall know you\xe2\x80\x99ve found Mitchy\r\nand shall be at peace. Go, little heart,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued to the child,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut leave me your book to look over again. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99m quite\r\nsure!\xe2\x80\x9d She sent them off together, but had a grave protest as her friend\r\nput out his hand for the volume. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Petherton--not for books; for her\r\nreading I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I do trust you. But for everything else--quite!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndeclared to Mr. Longdon with a look of conscientious courage as their\r\ncompanion withdrew. \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued in the same spirit, \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\na certain amount of intelligent confidence. Really nice men are steadied\r\nby the sense of your having had it. But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she added gaily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrust him all round!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMany things at Mertle were strange for her interlocutor, but nothing\r\nperhaps as yet had been so strange as the sight of this arrangement for\r\nlittle Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s protection; an arrangement made in the interest of her\r\nremaining as a young person of her age and her monde--so her aunt would\r\nhave put it--should remain. The strangest part of the impression too\r\nwas that the provision might really have its happy side and his lordship\r\nunderstand definitely better than any one else his noble friend\xe2\x80\x99s whole\r\ntheory of perils and precautions. The child herself, the spectator of\r\nthe incident was sure enough, understood nothing; but the understandings\r\nthat surrounded her, filling all the air, made it a heavier compound to\r\nbreathe than any Mr. Longdon had yet tasted. This heaviness had grown\r\nfor him through the long sweet summer day, and there was something in\r\nhis at last finding himself ensconced with the Duchess that made it\r\nsupremely oppressive. The contact was one that, none the less, he would\r\nnot have availed himself of a decent pretext to avoid. With so many\r\nfine mysteries playing about him there was relief, at the point he had\r\nreached, rather than alarm, in the thought of knowing the worst; which\r\nit pressed upon him somehow that the Duchess must not only altogether\r\nknow but must in any relation quite naturally communicate. It fluttered\r\nhim rather that a person who had an understanding with Lord Petherton\r\nshould so single him out as to wish for one also with himself; such a\r\nperson must either have great variety of mind or have a wonderful idea\r\nof HIS variety. It was true indeed that Mr. Mitchett must have the most\r\nextraordinary understanding, and yet with Mr. Mitchett he now found\r\nhimself quite pleasantly at his ease. Their host, however, was a person\r\nsui generis, whom he had accepted, once for all, the inconsequence of\r\nliking in conformity with the need he occasionally felt to put it on\r\nrecord that he was not narrow-minded. Perhaps at bottom he most liked\r\nMitchy because Mitchy most liked Nanda; there hung about him still\r\nmoreover the faded fragrance of the superstition that hospitality not\r\ndeclined is one of the things that \xe2\x80\x9coblige.\xe2\x80\x9d It obliged the thoughts,\r\nfor Mr. Longdon, as well as the manners, and in the especial form in\r\nwhich he was now committed to it would have made him, had he really\r\nthought any ill, ask himself what the deuce then he was doing in\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s house. All of which didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent some of Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s queer\r\ncondonations--if condonations in fact they were--from not wholly, by\r\nthemselves, soothing his vague unrest, an unrest which never had been so\r\ngreat as at the moment he heard the Duchess abruptly say to him: \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou know my idea about Nanda? It\xe2\x80\x99s my particular desire you should--the\r\nreason, really, why I\xe2\x80\x99ve thus laid violent hands on you. Nanda, my dear\r\nman, should marry at the very first moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was more interesting than he had expected, and the effect produced\r\nby his interlocutress, as well as doubtless not lost on her, was\r\nshown in his suppressed start. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has been no reason why I should\r\nattribute to you any judgement of the matter; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve had one myself,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say frankly that it\xe2\x80\x99s very much the one\r\nyou express. It would be a very good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very good thing, but none of my business?\xe2\x80\x9d--the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s vivacity\r\nwas not unamiable.\r\n\r\nIt was on this circumstance that her companion for an instant perhaps\r\nmeditated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s probably not in my interest to say that. I should give\r\nyou too easy a retort. It would strike any one as quite as much your\r\nbusiness as mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it ought to be somebody\xe2\x80\x99s, you know. One would suppose it to be\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s--her father\xe2\x80\x99s; but in this country the parents are even\r\nmore emancipated than the children. Suppose, really, since it appears to\r\nbe nobody\xe2\x80\x99s affair, that you and I do make it ours. We needn\xe2\x80\x99t either\r\nof us,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbe concerned for the other\xe2\x80\x99s reasons, though I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nperfectly ready, I assure you, to put my cards on the table. You\xe2\x80\x99ve your\r\nfeelings--we know they\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful. I, on my side, have mine--for which\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend anything but that they\xe2\x80\x99re strong. They can dispense\r\nwith being beautiful when they\xe2\x80\x99re so perfectly settled. Besides, I\r\nmay mention, they\xe2\x80\x99re rather nice than otherwise. Edward and I have a\r\ncousinage, though for all he does to keep it up--! If he leaves his\r\nchildren to play in the street I take it seriously enough to make an\r\noccasional dash for them before they\xe2\x80\x99re run over. And I want for Nanda\r\nsimply the man she herself wants--it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if I wanted for her a\r\ndwarf or a hunchback or a coureur or a drunkard. Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s a man whom\r\nany woman, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? might be--whom more than one woman IS--glad\r\nof for herself: beau comme le jour, awfully conceited and awfully\r\npatronising, but clever and successful and yet liked, and without, so\r\nfar as I know, any of the terrific appendages which in this country so\r\noften diminish the value of even the pleasantest people. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t five\r\nhorrible unmarried sisters for his wife to have always on a visit. The\r\nway your women don\xe2\x80\x99t marry is the ruin here of society, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nassured in good quarters--though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know so much about that--the\r\nruin also of conversation and of literature. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it precisely just a\r\nlittle to keep Nanda herself from becoming that kind of appendage--say\r\nto poor Harold, say, one of these days, to her younger brother and\r\nsister--that friends like you and me feel the importance of bestirring\r\nourselves in time? Of course she\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly young, but she\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nany age you like: your London world so fearfully batters and bruises\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d She had gone fast and far, but it had given Mr. Longdon time to\r\nfeel himself well afloat. There were so many things in it all to take up\r\nthat he laid his hand--of which, he was not unconscious, the feebleness\r\nexposed him--on the nearest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy I\xe2\x80\x99m sure her mother--after twenty\r\nyears of it--is fresh enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFresh? You find Mrs. Brook fresh?\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess had a manner that, in\r\nits all-knowingness, rather humiliated than encouraged; but he was all\r\nthe more resolute for being conscious of his own reserves. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to\r\nme it\xe2\x80\x99s fresh to look about thirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat indeed would be perfect. But she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t--she looks about three.\r\nShe simply looks a baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Duchess, you\xe2\x80\x99re really too particular!\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, feeling that,\r\nas the trodden worm will turn, anxiety itself may sometimes tend to wit.\r\n\r\nShe met him in her own way. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what I mean. My niece is a person\r\n_I_ call fresh. It\xe2\x80\x99s warranted, as they say in the shops. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cif a married woman has been knocked about that\xe2\x80\x99s only a part\r\nof her condition. Elle l\xe2\x80\x99a lien voulu, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re married you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmarried; it\xe2\x80\x99s the smoke--or call it the soot!--of the fire. You know,\r\nyourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she roundly pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s situation appals you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x98appals\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d he restrictively murmured.\r\n\r\nIt even tried a little his companion\xe2\x80\x99s patience. \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are, you\r\nEnglish--you\xe2\x80\x99ll never face your own music. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing what you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather do with a thing--anything not to shoot at or to make money\r\nwith--than look at its meaning. If I wished to save the girl as YOU wish\r\nit I should know exactly from what. But why differ about reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we\xe2\x80\x99re at one about the fact? I don\xe2\x80\x99t mention the greatest\r\nof Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s merits,\xe2\x80\x9d she added--\xe2\x80\x9chis having so delicious a friend.\r\nBy whom, let me hasten to assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nleast mean Mrs. Brook! She IS delicious if you like, but believe me when\r\nI tell you, caro mio--if you need to be told--that for effective action\r\non him you\xe2\x80\x99re worth twenty of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was most visible in Mr. Longdon was that, however it came to him,\r\nhe had rarely before, all at once, had so much given him to think\r\nabout. Again the only way to manage was to take what came uppermost.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy effective action you mean action on the matter of his proposing for\r\nNanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s assent was noble. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can make him propose--you can make,\r\nI mean, a sure thing of it. You can doter the bride.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as with\r\nthe impulse to meet benevolently and more than halfway her companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimperfect apprehension: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can settle on her something that will make\r\nher a parti.\xe2\x80\x9d His apprehension was perhaps imperfect, but it could\r\nstill lead somehow to his flushing all over, and this demonstration the\r\nDuchess as quickly took into account. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Edward, you know, won\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nher a penny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDecidedly she went fast, but Mr. Longdon in a moment had caught up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanderbank--your idea is--would require on the part of his wife\r\nsomething of that sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t--in the world we all move in--require it quite as\r\nmuch? Mr. Vanderbank, I\xe2\x80\x99m assured, has no means of his own at all, and\r\nif he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in impecunious marriages it\xe2\x80\x99s not I who shall be\r\nshocked at him. For myself I simply despise them. He has nothing but a\r\npoor official salary. If it\xe2\x80\x99s enough for one it would be little for two,\r\nand would be still less for half a dozen. They\xe2\x80\x99re just the people to\r\nhave, that blessed pair, a fine old English family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon was now fairly abreast of it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat it comes to then, the\r\nidea you\xe2\x80\x99re so good as to put before me, is to bribe him to take her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess remained bland, but she fixed him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say that as if you\r\nwere scandalised, but if you try Mr. Van with it I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe. And you won\xe2\x80\x99t persuade me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on finely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyourself thought of it.\xe2\x80\x9d She kept her eyes on him, and the effect of\r\nthem, soon enough visible in his face, was such as presently to make her\r\nexult at her felicity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re of a limpidity, dear man--you\xe2\x80\x99ve only\r\nto be said \xe2\x80\x98bo!\xe2\x80\x99 to and you confess. Consciously or unconsciously--the\r\nformer, really, I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to think--you\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted him for her.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\npaused an instant to enjoy her triumph, after which she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted her for him. I make you out, you\xe2\x80\x99ll say--for I see you\r\ncoming--one of those horrible benevolent busy-bodies who are the worst\r\nof the class, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve only to think a little--if I may go so far--to\r\nsee that no \xe2\x80\x98making\xe2\x80\x99 at all is required. You\xe2\x80\x99ve only one link with the\r\nBrooks, but that link is golden. How can we, all of us, by this time,\r\nnot have grasped and admired the beauty of your feeling for Lady Julia?\r\nThere it is--I make you wince: to speak of it is to profane it. Let us\r\nby all means not speak of it then, but let us act on it.\xe2\x80\x9d He had at last\r\nturned his face from her, and it now took in, from the vantage of his\r\nhigh position, only the loveliness of the place and the hour, which\r\nincluded a glimpse of Lord Petherton and little Aggie, who, down in\r\nthe garden, slowly strolled in familiar union. Each had a hand in the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s, swinging easily as they went; their talk was evidently of\r\nflowers and fruits and birds; it was quite like father and daughter.\r\nOne could see half a mile off in short that THEY weren\xe2\x80\x99t flirting. Our\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s bewilderment came in odd cold gusts: these were unreasoned and\r\ncapricious; one of them, at all events, during his companion\xe2\x80\x99s pause,\r\nmust have roared in his ears. Was it not therefore through some\r\ncontinuance of the sound that he heard her go on speaking? \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nyou know the poor child\xe2\x80\x99s own condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt took him a good while to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cDo YOU know it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with his\r\neyes still away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your question\xe2\x80\x99s ironical,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cyour irony\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly\r\nwasted. I should be ashamed of myself if, with my relationship and my\r\ninterest, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made sure. Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s fairly sick--as sick as a little\r\ncat--with her passion.\xe2\x80\x9d It was with an intensity of silence that he\r\nappeared to accept this; he was even so dumb for a minute that the\r\noddity of the image could draw from him no natural sound. The Duchess\r\nonce more, accordingly, recognised an occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has doubtless\r\nalready occurred to you that, since your sentiment for the living is\r\nthe charming fruit of your sentiment for the dead, there would be a\r\nsacrifice to Lady Julia\xe2\x80\x99s memory more exquisite than any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this finally Mr. Longdon turned. \xe2\x80\x9cThe effort--on the lines you speak\r\nof--for Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s happiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fairly glowed with hope. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd by the same token such a piece of\r\npoetic justice! Quite the loveliest it would be, I think, one had ever\r\nheard of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, for some time more, they sat confronted. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see your\r\ndifficulty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI do happen to know, I confess, that\r\nNanda herself extremely desires the execution of your project.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend\xe2\x80\x99s smile betrayed no surprise at this effect of her eloquence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re bad at dodging. Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s desire is inevitably to stop off for\r\nherself every question of any one but Vanderbank. If she wants me to\r\nsucceed in arranging with Mr. Mitchett can you ask for a plainer sign\r\nof her private predicament? But you\xe2\x80\x99ve signs enough, I see\xe2\x80\x9d--she caught\r\nherself up: \xe2\x80\x9cwe may take them all for granted. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known perfectly from\r\nthe first that the only difficulty would come from her mother--but also\r\nthat that would be stiff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe movement with which Mr. Longdon removed his glasses might have\r\ndenoted a certain fear to participate in too much of what the Duchess\r\nhad known. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not been ignorant that Mrs. Brookenham favours Mr.\r\nMitchett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was not to be let off with that. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ve not been blind, I\r\nsuppose, to her reason for doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d He might not have been blind, but\r\nhis vision, at this, scarce showed sharpness, and it determined in his\r\ninterlocutress the shortest of short cuts. \xe2\x80\x9cShe favours Mr. Mitchett\r\nbecause she wants \xe2\x80\x98old Van\xe2\x80\x99 herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was evidently conscious of looking at her hard. \xe2\x80\x9cIn what\r\nsense--herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you must supply the sense; I can give you only the fact--and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe fact that concerns us. Voyons\xe2\x80\x9d she almost impatiently broke out;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t try to create unnecessary obscurities by being unnecessarily\r\nmodest. Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99m not touching your modesty. Supply any sense\r\nwhatever that may miraculously satisfy your fond English imagination:\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t insist in the least on a bad one. She does want him\r\nherself--that\xe2\x80\x99s all I say. \xe2\x80\x98Pourquoi faires\xe2\x80\x99 you ask--or rather, being\r\ntoo shy, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask, but would like to if you dared or didn\xe2\x80\x99t fear I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe shocked. I CAN\xe2\x80\x99T be shocked, but frankly I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you either. The\r\nsituation belongs, I think, to an order I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I understand\r\neither one thing or the other--I understand taking a man up or letting\r\nhim alone. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t really get at Mrs. Brook. You must judge at any\r\nrate for yourself. Vanderbank could of course tell you if he would--but\r\nit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be right that he should. So the one thing we have to do\r\nwith is that she\xe2\x80\x99s in fact against us. I can only work Mitchy through\r\nPetherton, but Mrs. Brook can work him straight. On the other hand\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way you, my dear man, can work Vanderbank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne thing evidently beyond the rest, as a result of this vivid\r\ndemonstration, disengaged itself to our old friend\xe2\x80\x99s undismayed sense,\r\nbut his consternation needed a minute or two to produce it. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nabsolutely assure you that Mr. Vanderbank entertains no sentiment for\r\nMrs. Brookenham--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he may not keep under by just setting his teeth and holding on?\r\nI never dreamed he does, and have nothing so alarming in store for\r\nyou--rassurez-vous bien!--as to propose that he shall be invited to sink\r\na feeling for the mother in order to take one up for the child. Don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nplease, flutter out of the whole question by a premature scare. I never\r\nsupposed it\xe2\x80\x99s he who wants to keep HER. He\xe2\x80\x99s not in love with her--be\r\ncomforted! But she\xe2\x80\x99s amusing--highly amusing. I do her perfect justice.\r\nAs your women go she\xe2\x80\x99s rare. If she were French she\xe2\x80\x99d be a femme\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99esprit. She has invented a nuance of her own and she has done it all\r\nby herself, for Edward figures in her drawing-room only as one of those\r\nqueer extinguishers of fire in the corridors of hotels. He\xe2\x80\x99s just a\r\nbucket on a peg. The men, the young and the clever ones, find it a\r\nhouse--and heaven knows they\xe2\x80\x99re right--with intellectual elbow-room,\r\nwith freedom of talk. Most English talk is a quadrille in a sentry-box.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me we go further in Italy, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, but in Italy\r\nwe have the common sense not to have little girls in the room. The\r\nyoung men hang about Mrs. Brook, and the clever ones ply her with\r\nthe uproarious appreciation that keeps her up to the mark. She\xe2\x80\x99s in a\r\nprodigious fix--she must sacrifice either her daughter or what she once\r\ncalled to me her intellectual habits. Mr. Vanderbank, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen for\r\nyourself, is of these one of the most cherished, the most confirmed.\r\nThree months ago--it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any longer kept off--Nanda began\r\ndefinitely to \xe2\x80\x98sit\xe2\x80\x99; to be there and look, by the tea-table, modestly\r\nand conveniently abstracted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon--I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she looks that, Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon\r\nlucidly broke in. How much she had carried him with her in spite of\r\nhimself was betrayed by the very terms of his dissent. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\r\nwould strike any one that she looks \xe2\x80\x98convenient.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion, laughing, gave a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cTry her and perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nher so!\xe2\x80\x9d But his objection had none the less pulled her up a little. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say she\xe2\x80\x99s a hypocrite, for it would certainly be less decent for\r\nher to giggle and wink. It\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s theory moreover, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nthat she has, from five to seven at least, lowered the pitch. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe pretend that she bears in mind every moment the tiresome difference\r\nmade by the presence of sweet virginal eighteen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, a notion of what she pretends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had spoken with a curtness to which his friend\xe2\x80\x99s particular\r\nmanner of overlooking it only added significance. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve become,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npursued, \xe2\x80\x9csuperficial or insincere or frivolous, but at least they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbecome, with the way the drag\xe2\x80\x99s put on, quite as dull as other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe showed no sign of taking this up; instead of it he said abruptly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Mitchett\xe2\x80\x99s own idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis fellow visitor barely hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be his own if he were\r\nfree--and it would be Lord Petherton\xe2\x80\x99s FOR him. I mean by his being free\r\nNanda\xe2\x80\x99s becoming definitely lost to him. Then it would be impossible\r\nfor Mrs. Brook to continue to persuade him, as she does now, that by a\r\nwaiting game he\xe2\x80\x99ll come to his chance. His chance will cease to exist,\r\nand he wants so, poor darling, to marry. You\xe2\x80\x99ve really now seen my\r\nniece,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another reason why I hold you can help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there she is.\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if in the pause that followed this they\r\nsat looking at little absent Aggie with a wonder that was almost equal.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good God has given her to me,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me then that she herself is, in her remarkable loveliness,\r\nreally your help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be doubly so if you give me proofs that you believe in her.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthe Duchess, appearing to consider that with this she had made herself\r\nclear and her interlocutor plastic, rose in confident majesty. \xe2\x80\x9cI leave\r\nit to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon did the same, but with more consideration now. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it your\r\nexpectation that I shall speak to Mr. Mitchett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t flatter yourself he won\xe2\x80\x99t speak to YOU!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon made it out. \xe2\x80\x9cAs supposing me, you mean, an interested\r\nparty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clapped her gloved hands for joy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a delight to hear you\r\npractically admit that you ARE one! Mr. Mitchett will take anything from\r\nyou--above all perfect candour. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t every day one meets YOUR kind,\r\nand he\xe2\x80\x99s a connoisseur. I leave it to you--I leave it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke as if it were something she had thrust bodily into his\r\nhands and wished to hurry away from. He put his hands behind\r\nhim--straightening himself a little, half-kindled, still half-confused.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re all extraordinary people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a toss of her head that showed her as not so dazzled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthe best of us, caro mio--you and Aggie: for Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s as good as you.\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s good too, however--Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. You see it\xe2\x80\x99s not only\r\nhis money. He\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman. So are you. There aren\xe2\x80\x99t so many. But we\r\nmust move fast,\xe2\x80\x9d she added more sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by fast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I mean but what I say? If Nanda doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a husband early\r\nin the business--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon, as she appeared to pause with the weight of\r\nher idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy she won\xe2\x80\x99t get one late--she won\xe2\x80\x99t get one at all. One, I mean, of\r\nthe kind she\xe2\x80\x99ll take. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have been in it over-long for THEIR taste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had moved, looking off and about her--little Aggie always on her\r\nmind--to the flight of steps, where she again hung fire; and had really\r\nended by producing in him the manner of keeping up with her to challenge\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cBeen in what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went down a few steps while he stood with his face full of\r\nperceptions strained and scattered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy in the air they themselves have\r\ninfected for her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nLate that night, in the smoking room, when the smokers--talkers and\r\nlisteners alike--were about to disperse, Mr. Longdon asked Vanderbank to\r\nstay, and then it was that the young man, to whom all the evening he had\r\nnot addressed a word, could make out why, a little unnaturally, he had\r\nprolonged his vigil. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve something particular to say to you and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen waiting. I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather important.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nexpressed on the spot the liveliest desire to oblige him and, quickly\r\nlighting another cigarette, mounted again to the deep divan with which\r\na part of the place was furnished. The smoking-room at Mertle was not\r\nunworthy of the general nobleness, and the fastidious spectator had\r\nclearly been reckoned on in the great leather-covered lounge that,\r\nraised by a step or two above the floor, applied its back to two\r\nquarters of the wall and enjoyed most immediately a view of the\r\nbilliard-table. Mr. Longdon continued for a minute to roam with the air\r\nof dissimulated absence that, during the previous hour and among the\r\nother men, his companion\xe2\x80\x99s eye had not lost; he pushed a ball or two\r\nabout, examined the form of an ash-stand, swung his glasses almost\r\nwith violence and declined either to smoke or to sit down. Vanderbank,\r\nperched aloft on the bench and awaiting developments, had a little the\r\nlook of some prepossessing criminal who, in court, should have changed\r\nplaces with the judge. He was unlike many a man of marked good looks\r\nin that the effect of evening dress was not, with a perversity often\r\nobserved in such cases, to over-emphasise his fineness. His type was\r\nrather chastened than heightened, and he sat there moreover with a\r\nprimary discretion quite in the note of the deference that from the\r\nfirst, with his friend of the elder fashion, he had taken as imposed.\r\nHe had a strong sense for shades of respect and was now careful to\r\nloll scarcely more than with an official superior. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nLongdon presently continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy at this hour of the night--after a day\r\nat best too heterogeneous--I don\xe2\x80\x99t keep over till to-morrow whatever I\r\nmay have to say, I can only tell you that I appeal to you now because\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve something on my mind that I shall sleep the better for being rid\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was space to circulate in front of the haut-pas, where he had\r\nstill paced and still swung his glasses; but with these words he had\r\npaused, leaning against the billiard-table, to meet the interested\r\nurbanity of the answer they produced. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you very sure that having\r\ngot rid of it you WILL sleep? Is it a pure confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat you do me the honour to make me? Is it something terrific that\r\nrequires a reply, so that I shall have to take account on my side of the\r\nrest I may deprive you of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take account of anything--I\xe2\x80\x99m myself a man who always takes too\r\nmuch. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a matter about which I press you for an immediate answer.\r\nYou can give me no answer probably without a good deal of thought. I\xe2\x80\x99VE\r\nthought a good deal--otherwise I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak. I only want to put\r\nsomething before you and leave it there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t put something before\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend returned, \xe2\x80\x9cas if I rather overloaded--what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe sort of thing you fellows nowadays say?--your intellectual board.\r\nIf there\xe2\x80\x99s a congestion of dishes sweep everything without scruple away.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never put before you anything like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a weight that in the great space, where it resounded a\r\nlittle, made an impression--an impression marked by the momentary pause\r\nthat fell between them. He partly broke the silence first by beginning\r\nto walk again, and then Vanderbank broke it as through the apprehension\r\nof their becoming perhaps too solemn. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you immensely interest\r\nme and you really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have chosen a better time. A secret--for we\r\nshall make it that of course, shan\xe2\x80\x99t we?--at this witching hour, in this\r\ngreat old house, is all my visit here will have required to make the\r\nwhole thing a rare remembrance. So I assure you the more you put before\r\nme the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon took up another ash-tray, but with the air of doing so as\r\na direct consequence of Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s tone. After he had laid it down he\r\nput on his glasses; then fixing his companion he brought out: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nno idea at all--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what you have in your head? Dear Mr. Longdon, how SHOULD I have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps have a little in your place.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that in the circumstances occurs to you as likely I\r\nshould want to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank gave a laugh that might have struck an auditor as a\r\ntrifle uneasy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you speak of \xe2\x80\x98the circumstances\xe2\x80\x99 you do a thing\r\nthat--unless you mean the simple thrilling ones of this particular\r\nmoment--always of course opens the door of the lurid for a man of\r\nany imagination. To such a man you\xe2\x80\x99ve only to give a nudge for his\r\nconscience to jump. That\xe2\x80\x99s at any rate the case with mine. It\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nquite on its feet--so it\xe2\x80\x99s now already on its back.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped a\r\nlittle--his smile was even strained. \xe2\x80\x9cIs what you want to put before me\r\nsomething awful I\xe2\x80\x99ve done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me if I press this point.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon spoke kindly, but if\r\nhis friend\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety grew his own thereby diminished. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you think of\r\nnothing at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but that--whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it or not--I may have become aware\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere could have been no better proof than Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s expression, on\r\nthis, of his having mastered the secret of humouring without appearing\r\nto patronise. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you ought to give me a little more of a clue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon took off his glasses. \xe2\x80\x9cWell--the clue\xe2\x80\x99s Nanda Brookenham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I see.\xe2\x80\x9d His friend had responded quickly, but for a minute said\r\nnothing more, and the great marble clock that gave the place the air\r\nof a club ticked louder in the stillness. Mr. Longdon waited with a\r\nbenevolent want of mercy, yet with a look in his face that spoke of what\r\ndepended for him--though indeed very far within--on the upshot of his\r\npatience. The hush between them, for that matter, became a conscious\r\npublic measure of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s honesty. He evidently at last felt\r\nit as such, and there would have been for an observer of his handsome\r\ncontrolled face a study of some sharp things. \xe2\x80\x9cI judge that you ask me\r\nfor such an utterance,\xe2\x80\x9d he finally said, \xe2\x80\x9cas very few persons at any\r\ntime have the right to expect of a man. Think of the people--and very\r\ndecent ones--to whom on so many a question one must only reply that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnone of their business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you know what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you know also the distinguished exception I make of you. There\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t another man with whom I\xe2\x80\x99d talk of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even to me you don\xe2\x80\x99t! But I\xe2\x80\x99m none the less obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nLongdon added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t only the gravity,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion went on; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the ridicule\r\nthat inevitably attaches--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Mr. Longdon indicated the empty room was in itself\r\nan interruption. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I sufficiently spare you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, it\xe2\x80\x99s not for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man returned, though with a look of noting\r\nthe next moment a certain awkwardness in his concurrence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspare me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon had his back to the table again, on which\r\nhe rested with each hand on the rim. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nHis victim gave a laugh that betrayed at least the drop of a tension.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see what you can do to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just what for some time past I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at last you\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--it has finally glimmered out a little in this extraordinary\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank frankly wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIn consequence of anything particular that\r\nhas happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cFor an old idiot who notices as much as\r\nI something particular\xe2\x80\x99s always happening. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a man of\r\nimagination--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cI know how much more in that case you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\none! It only makes me regret,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve not attended\r\nmore since yesterday to what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been about nothing but what among you people I\xe2\x80\x99m always about.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing, feeling, thinking. That makes no show, of course I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\naware, for any one but myself, and it\xe2\x80\x99s wholly my own affair. Except\r\nindeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cso far as I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken into my head to make, on it\r\nall, this special appeal. There are things that have come home to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I see, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank showed the friendliest alertness. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m to\r\ntake it from you then, with all the avidity of my vanity, that I strike\r\nyou as the person best able to understand what they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon appeared to wonder an instant if his intelligence now had\r\nnot almost too much of a glitter: he kept the same position, his back\r\nagainst the table, and while Vanderbank, on the settee, pressed upright\r\nagainst the wall, they recognised in silence that they were trying each\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re much the best of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ve my ideas about you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngreat gifts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, we\xe2\x80\x99re worthy of each other. When Greek meets Greek--!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe young man laughed while, a little with the air of bracing himself,\r\nhe folded his arms. \xe2\x80\x9cHere we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion looked at him a moment longer, then, turning away, went\r\nslowly round the table. On the further side of it he stopped again and,\r\nafter a minute, with a nervous movement, set a ball or two in motion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful--but it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d he finally murmured. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t his\r\neyes on Vanderbank, who for a minute said nothing, and he presently went\r\non: \xe2\x80\x9cTo see it and not to want to try to help--well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank, still neither speaking nor moving, remained as if he might\r\ninterrupt something of high importance, and his friend, passing along\r\nthe opposite edge of the table, continued to produce in the stillness,\r\nwithout the cue, the small click of the ivory. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long--if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind my asking--have you known it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven for this at first Vanderbank had no answer--none but to rise from\r\nhis place, come down to the floor and, standing there, look at Mr.\r\nLongdon across the table. He was serious now, but without being solemn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can one tell? One can never be sure. A man may fancy, may wonder;\r\nbut about a girl, a person so much younger than himself and so much more\r\nhelpless, he feels a--what shall I call it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA delicacy?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that; the name doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter; at all events he\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassed. He wants not to be an ass on the\r\none side and yet not some other kind of brute on the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon listened with consideration--with a beautiful little air\r\nindeed of being, in his all but finally benighted state, earnestly open\r\nto information on such points from a magnificent young man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant, you mean, to be a coxcomb?--and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be cruel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, visibly preoccupied, produced a faint kind smile. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you\r\nKNOW!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I should know less than any one.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon had turned away from\r\nthe table on this, and the eyes of his companion, who after an instant\r\nhad caught his meaning, watched him move along the room and approach\r\nanother part of the divan. The consequence of the passage was that\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s only rejoinder was presently to say: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\r\nhow long I\xe2\x80\x99ve imagined--have asked myself. She\xe2\x80\x99s so charming, so\r\ninteresting, and I feel as if I had known her always. I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of\r\none thing and another to do--and then, on purpose, haven\xe2\x80\x99t thought at\r\nall. That has mostly seemed to me best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I gather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your interest in her--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t the same character as her interest in ME?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank had taken\r\nhim up responsively, but after speaking looked about for a match and\r\nlighted a new cigarette. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nan extreme effort it is to me to talk of such things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. But it\xe2\x80\x99s just effort only? It gives you no pleasure? I mean\r\nthe fact of her condition,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon explained.\r\n\r\nVanderbank had really to think a little. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever much it might give me\r\nI should probably not be a fellow to gush. I\xe2\x80\x99m a self-conscious stick of\r\na Briton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut even a stick of a Briton--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon faltered and hovered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve gushed in short to YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Lady Julia?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man frankly asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIs gushing what you\r\ncall what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay then we\xe2\x80\x99re sticks of Britons. You\xe2\x80\x99re not in any degree at all in\r\nlove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere fell between them, before Vanderbank replied, another pause, of\r\nwhich he took advantage to move once more round the table. Mr. Longdon\r\nmeanwhile had mounted to the high bench and sat there as if the judge\r\nwere now in his proper place. At last his companion spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncoming to is of course that you\xe2\x80\x99ve conceived a desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it--strange as it may seem. But believe me, it has not been\r\nprecipitate. I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched you both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I knew you were watching HER,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo such a tune that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind. I want her so to marry--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n But on the odd little quaver of longing with which he brought it out the\r\nelder man fairly hung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so that on the day she does she\xe2\x80\x99ll come into the interest of a\r\nconsiderable sum of money--already very decently invested--that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndetermined to settle on her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s instant admiration flushed across the room. \xe2\x80\x9cHow awfully\r\njolly of you--how beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to show practically your appreciation of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Vanderbank, for enthusiasm, scarcely heard him. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\r\nhow admirable I think you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Nanda know it?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, after a wait, spoke with comparative dryness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy idea has\r\nbeen that for the present you alone shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank took it in. \xe2\x80\x9cNo other man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion looked still graver. \xe2\x80\x9cI need scarcely say that I depend on\r\nyou to keep the fact to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely then and utterly. But that won\xe2\x80\x99t prevent what I think of it.\r\nNothing for a long time has given me such joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShining and sincere, he had held for a minute Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\nyou do care for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmensely. Never, I think, so much as now. That sounds of a grossness,\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut your announcement really lights\r\nup the mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend for a moment almost glowed with his pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sum I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nfixed upon would be, I may mention, substantial, and I should of course\r\nbe prepared with a clear statement--a very definite pledge--of my\r\nintentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better! Only\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank suddenly pulled himself up--\xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nget it she MUST marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not in my interest to allow you to suppose she needn\xe2\x80\x99t, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly because of my intensely wanting her marriage that I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on the ground also with it\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank so far concurred--\xe2\x80\x9cof your\r\nquite taking for granted my only having to put myself forward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf his friend seemed to cast about it proved but to be for the fullest\r\nexpression. Nothing in fact could have been more charged than the quiet\r\nway in which he presently said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, I back you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank clearly was touched by it. \xe2\x80\x9cHow extraordinarily kind you are\r\nto me!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s silence appeared to reply that he was willing to\r\nlet it go for that, and the young man next went on: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat it comes to\r\nthen--as you put it--is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a way for me to add something handsome\r\nto my income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon sat for a little with his eyes attached to the green field\r\nof the billiard-table, vivid in the spreading suspended lamplight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink I ought to tell you the figure I have in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother person present might have felt rather taxed either to determine\r\nthe degree of provocation represented by Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s considerate smile,\r\nor to say if there was an appreciable interval before he rang out:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, you know, you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to do anything of the sort. Let that\r\nalone, please. The great thing is the interest--the great thing is the\r\nwish you express. It represents a view of me, an attitude toward me--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He pulled up, dropping his arms and turning away before the complete\r\nimage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in those things that need overwhelm you. It would be\r\nodd if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yourself, about your value and your future a feeling\r\nquite as lively as any feeling of mine. There IS mine at all events. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help it. Accept it. Then of the other feeling--how SHE moves me--I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sufficiently show it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon continued to watch the bright circle on the table, lost in\r\nwhich a moment he let his friend\xe2\x80\x99s answer pass. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t begin to you on\r\nNanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank. But in the pause that ensued each, in one way\r\nor another, might have been thinking of her for himself.\r\n\r\nIt was broken by Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s presently going on: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course what it\r\nsuperficially has the air of is my offering to pay you for taking a\r\ncertain step. It\xe2\x80\x99s open to you to be grand and proud--to wrap yourself\r\nin your majesty and ask if I suppose you bribeable. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken\r\nwithout having thought of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank all responsively, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if you\r\nproposed to me, is it, anything dreadful? If one cares for a girl one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeucedly glad she has money. The more of anything good she has the\r\nbetter. I may assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with the brightness of his friendly\r\nintelligence and quite as if to show his companion the way to be least\r\nconcerned--\xe2\x80\x9cI may assure you that once I were disposed to act on your\r\nsuggestion I\xe2\x80\x99d make short work of any vulgar interpretation of my\r\nmotive. I should simply try to be as fine as yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d He smoked, he\r\nmoved about, then came up in another place. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you know that\r\ndear old Mitchy, under whose blessed roof we\xe2\x80\x99re plotting this midnight\r\ntreason, would marry her like a shot and without a penny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know everything--I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of everything. Mr.\r\nMitchett,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon added, \xe2\x80\x9cis impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank appeared for an instant to wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cWholly then through HER\r\nattitude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAltogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve asked her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more Vanderbank faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s how you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout YOUR chance? That\xe2\x80\x99s how I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man, consuming his cigarette with concentration, took again\r\nseveral turns. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd your idea IS to give one time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had for a minute to turn his idea over. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much time do\r\nyou want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank gave a headshake that was both restrictive and indulgent. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust live into it a little. Your offer has been before me only these few\r\nminutes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s too soon for me to commit myself to anything whatever.\r\nExcept,\xe2\x80\x9d he added gallantly, \xe2\x80\x9cto my gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, at this, on the divan, got up, as Vanderbank had previously\r\ndone, under the spring of emotion; only, unlike Vanderbank, he still\r\nstood there, his hands in his pockets and his face, a little paler,\r\ndirected straight. There was disappointment in him even before he spoke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no strong enough impulse--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend met him with admirable candour. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem that if I\r\nhad I would by this time have taken the jump?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout waiting, you mean, for anybody\xe2\x80\x99s money?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon\r\ncultivated for a little a doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course she has struck one as--till\r\nnow--tremendously young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank looked about once more for matches and occupied a time with\r\nrelighting. \xe2\x80\x9cTill now--yes. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9conly because\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s so young that--for each of us, and for dear old Mitchy too--she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon had restlessly stepped down, and\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed him till he stopped again. \xe2\x80\x9cI make out that\r\nin spite of what you said to begin with you\xe2\x80\x99re conscious of a certain\r\npressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the matter of time? Oh yes, I do want it DONE. That,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s patron\r\nsimply explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis why I myself put on the screw.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke with the\r\nring of impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cI want her got out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Out\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank laughed though--more immediately--he had coloured. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s house is just where I see her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely; and if it only weren\xe2\x80\x99t we might get on faster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, for all his kindness, looked still more amused. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if it\r\nonly weren\xe2\x80\x99t, as you say, I seem to understand you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have your\r\nparticular vision of urgency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, through adjusted glasses, took him in with a look that\r\nwas sad as well as sharp, then jerked the glasses off. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you do\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a mass of corruption!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may perfectly be, but you shall not,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon returned with\r\ndecision, \xe2\x80\x9cget off on any such plea. If you\xe2\x80\x99re good enough for me you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngood enough, as you thoroughly know, on whatever head, for any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d But Vanderbank, for all his happy appreciation, thought\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought at any rate to remember, oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t we? that we should\r\nhave Mrs. Brook against us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion faltered but an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s another thing I know.\r\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s also exactly why. Why I want Nanda away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe response had been prompt, yet Mr. Longdon seemed suddenly to show\r\nthat he suspected the superficial. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless it\xe2\x80\x99s with Mrs. Brook you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nin love.\xe2\x80\x9d Then on his friend\xe2\x80\x99s taking the idea with a mere headshake of\r\nnegation, a repudiation that might even have astonished by its own lack\r\nof surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cOr unless Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s in love with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he amended.\r\n\r\nVanderbank had for this any decent gaiety. \xe2\x80\x9cAh that of course may\r\nperfectly be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut IS it? That\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued light. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she had declared her passion shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I rather\r\ncompromise her--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy letting me know?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t say--it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na sort of thing for which I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a measure or a precedent. In my time\r\nwomen didn\xe2\x80\x99t declare their passion. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of what the meaning is\r\nof Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s wanting you--as I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it called--herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, still with his smile, smoked a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheard it called?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you must excuse me from telling you by whom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was amused at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s discretion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unimaginable. But it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. We all call everything--anything. The meaning of it, if\r\nyou and I put it so, is--well, a modern shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must deal then yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your modern\r\nshades.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke now as if the case simply awaited such dealing.\r\n\r\nBut at this his young friend was more grave. \xe2\x80\x9cYOU could do nothing?--to\r\nbring, I mean, Mrs. Brook round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon fairly started. \xe2\x80\x9cPropose on your behalf for her daughter?\r\nWith your authority--tomorrow. Authorise me and I instantly act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s colour again rose--his flush was complete. \xe2\x80\x9cHow awfully you\r\nwant it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, after a look at him, turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cHow awfully YOU don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man continued to blush. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--you must do me justice. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnot made a mistake about me--I see in your proposal, I think, all you\r\ncan desire I should. Only YOU see it much more simply--and yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\njust now explain. If it WERE so simple I should say to you in a moment\r\n\xe2\x80\x98do speak to them for me\xe2\x80\x99--I should leave the matter with delight in\r\nyour hands. But I require time, let me remind you, and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet\r\ntold me how much I may take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeal had brought them again face to face, and Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nreply to it was a look at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I require\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank had recovered his pleasant humour--\xe2\x80\x9cmore than\r\nto-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon went off to the smaller table that still offered to view\r\ntwo bedroom candles. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must take of course the time you need. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrouble you--I won\xe2\x80\x99t hurry you. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, overtaking him, lighted his candle for him; after which,\r\nhanding it and smiling: \xe2\x80\x9cShall we have conduced to your rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked at the other candle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not coming to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo MY rest we shall not have conduced. I stay up a while longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon was pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t forget then, as we promised,\r\nto put out the lights?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you trust me for the greater you can trust me for the less.\r\nGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank had offered his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d But Mr. Longdon kept him\r\na moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou DON\xe2\x80\x99T care for my figure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet--not yet. PLEASE.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank seemed really to fear it, but on\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s releasing him with a little drop of disappointment they\r\nwent together to the door of the room, where they had another pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s to come down to me--alone--in September.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank appeared to debate and conclude. \xe2\x80\x9cThen may I come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend, on this footing, had to consider. \xe2\x80\x9cShall you know by that\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t promise--if you must regard my coming as a pledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon thought on; then raising his eyes: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see why\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t suffer me to tell you--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe detail of your intention? I do then. You\xe2\x80\x99ve said quite enough. If\r\nmy visit must commit me,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, who had passed into the corridor, gave a dry sad little\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cCome then--as the ladies say--\xe2\x80\x98as you are\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn which, rather softly closing the door, the young man remained alone\r\nin the great emptily lighted billiard-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SIXTH. MRS. BROOK\r\n\r\n\r\nPresenting himself at Buckingham Crescent three days after the Sunday\r\nspent at Mertle, Vanderbank found Lady Fanny Cashmore in the act of\r\ntaking leave of Mrs. Brook and found Mrs. Brook herself in the state of\r\nmuffled exaltation that was the mark of all her intercourse--and most\r\nof all perhaps of her farewells--with Lady Fanny. This splendid creature\r\ngave out, as it were, so little that Vanderbank was freshly struck\r\nwith all Mrs. Brook could take in, though nothing, for that matter, in\r\nBuckingham Crescent, had been more fully formulated on behalf of the\r\nfamous beauty than the imperturbable grandeur of her almost total\r\nabsence of articulation. Every aspect of the phenomenon had been freely\r\ndiscussed there and endless ingenuity lavished on the question of how\r\nexactly it was that so much of what the world would in another case have\r\ncalled complete stupidity could be kept by a mere wonderful face from\r\nboring one to death. It was Mrs. Brook who, in this relation as in many\r\nothers, had arrived at the supreme expression of the law, had thrown\r\noff, happily enough, to whomever it might have concerned: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nthing, it all comes back, as everything always does, simply to personal\r\npluck. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a question, no matter when or where, of having enough.\r\nLady Fanny has the courage of all her silence--so much therefore that\r\nit sees her completely through and is what really makes her interesting.\r\nNot to be afraid of what may happen to you when you\xe2\x80\x99ve no more to say\r\nfor yourself than a steamer without a light--that truly is the highest\r\nheroism, and Lady Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s greatness is that she\xe2\x80\x99s never afraid. She\r\ntakes the risk every time she goes out--takes, as you may say, her life\r\nin her hand. She just turns that glorious mask upon you and practically\r\nsays: \xe2\x80\x98No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t open my lips--to call it really open--for the forty\r\nminutes I shall stay; but I calmly defy you, all the same, to kill me\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x99 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t kill her--we delight in her; though when either of\r\nus watches her in a circle of others it\xe2\x80\x99s like seeing a very large blind\r\nperson in the middle of Oxford Street. One fairly looks about for the\r\npolice.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank, before his fellow visitor withdrew it, had the\r\nbenefit of the glorious mask and could scarce have failed to be amused\r\nat the manner in which Mrs. Brook alone showed the stress of thought.\r\nLady Fanny, in the other scale, sat aloft and Olympian, so that though\r\nvisibly much had happened between the two ladies it had all happened\r\nonly to the hostess. The sense in the air in short was just of Lady\r\nFanny herself, who came to an end like a banquet or a procession.\r\nMrs. Brook left the room with her and, on coming back, was full of it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll go, she\xe2\x80\x99ll go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo where?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank appeared to have for the question less attention\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to the place her companion will propose. Probably--like Anna\r\nKarenine--to one of the smaller Italian towns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenine? She isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit like Anna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she isn\xe2\x80\x99t so clever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that would spoil\r\nher. So it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I dare say we shall\r\nstill have her with us a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall do that, I trust, whatever happens. She\xe2\x80\x99ll come up\r\nagain--she\xe2\x80\x99ll remain, I feel, one of those enormous things that fate\r\nseems somehow to have given me as the occupation of my odd moments. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook added, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat still keeps her on the edge, which\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t an inch wide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank looked this time as if he only tried to wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nYOU?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook mused more deeply. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I think so. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, how CAN you of course know, since she can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if I depended on her telling--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook shook out with this\r\na sofa-cushion or two and sank into the corner she had arranged. The\r\nAugust afternoon was hot and the London air heavy; the room moreover,\r\nthough agreeably bedimmed, gave out the staleness of the season\xe2\x80\x99s end.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d have missed me till I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know when, for we\xe2\x80\x99ve let the Hovel again--wretchedly, but still\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve let it--and I go down on Friday to see that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too filthy.\r\nEdward, who\xe2\x80\x99s furious at what I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken for it, had his idea that we\r\nshould go there this year ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank took her up--\xe2\x80\x9cthat fond fancy has become simply\r\nthe ghost of a dead thought, a ghost that, in company with a thousand\r\npredecessors, haunts the house in the twilight and pops at you out of\r\nodd corners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Edward\xe2\x80\x99s dead thoughts are indeed a cheerful company and worthy of\r\nthe perpetual mental mourning we seem to go about in. They\xe2\x80\x99re worse than\r\nthe relations we\xe2\x80\x99re always losing without seeming to have any fewer,\r\nand I expect every day to hear that the Morning Post regrets to have\r\nto announce in that line too some new bereavement. The apparitions\r\nfollowing the deaths of so many thoughts ARE particularly awful in the\r\ntwilight, so that at this season, while the day drags and drags, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nglad to have any one with me who may keep them at a distance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank had not sat down; slowly, familiarly he turned about. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwhere\xe2\x80\x99s Nanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh SHE doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help--she attracts rather the worst of the bogies.\r\nEdward and Nanda and Harold and I seated together are fairly a case for\r\nthat--what do you call it?--investigating Society. Deprived of the sweet\r\nresource of the Hovel,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall each, from about\r\nthe tenth on, forage somehow or other for ourselves. Mitchy perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she added, \xe2\x80\x9cwill insist on taking us to Baireuth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be the form, you mean, of his own forage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless you should prefer to take it as the\r\nform of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank appeared for a moment obligingly enough to turn this over,\r\nbut with the effect of noting an objection. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I shall have\r\nto grind straight through the month and that by the time I\xe2\x80\x99m free every\r\nRing at Baireuth will certainly have been rung. Is it your idea to take\r\nNanda?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe reached out for another cushion. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for you to\r\nmanage what I suggest why should that question interest you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear woman\xe2\x80\x9d--and her visitor dropped into a chair--\xe2\x80\x9cdo you suppose\r\nmy interest depends on such poverties as what I can \xe2\x80\x98manage\xe2\x80\x99? You know\r\nwell enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in another tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy I care for Nanda and\r\nenquire about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was perfectly ready. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it, but only as a bad reason. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ntoo sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment they looked at each other. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so sure, you mean,\r\nthat the elation of it may go to my head? Are you really warning me\r\nagainst vanity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour \xe2\x80\x98reallys,\xe2\x80\x99 my dear Van, are a little formidable, but it strikes\r\nme that before I tell you there\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to ask. Are you\r\n\xe2\x80\x98really\xe2\x80\x99 what they call thinking of my daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour asking,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank returned, \xe2\x80\x9cexactly shows the state of your\r\nknowledge of the matter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see moreover why you speak as if\r\nI were paying an abrupt and unnatural attention. What have I done the\r\nlast three months but talk to you about her? What have you done but talk\r\nto ME about her? From the moment you first spoke to me--\xe2\x80\x98monstrously,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI remember you called it--of the difference made in your social life by\r\nher finally established, her perpetual, her inexorable participation:\r\nfrom that moment what have we both done but put our heads together over\r\nthe question of keeping the place tidy, as you called it--or as _I_\r\ncalled it, was it?--for the young female mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook faced serenely enough the directness of this challenge.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what are you coming to? I spoke of the change in my life of\r\ncourse; I happen to be so constituted that my life has something to do\r\nwith my mind and my mind something to do with my talk. Good talk: you\r\nknow--no one, dear Van, should know better--what part for me that plays.\r\nTherefore when one has deliberately to make one\xe2\x80\x99s talk bad--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Bad\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank, in his amusement, fell back in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cDear\r\nMrs. Brook, you\xe2\x80\x99re too delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I mean--stupid, flat, fourth-rate. When one has to haul\r\nin sail to that degree--and for a perfectly outside reason--there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing strange in one\xe2\x80\x99s taking a friend sometimes into the confidence\r\nof one\xe2\x80\x99s irritation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank protested, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do yourself injustice. Irritation\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t been for you the only consequence of the affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook gloomily thought. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no--I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my calmness: the calmness\r\nof deep despair. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seemed to see everything go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh how can you say that,\xe2\x80\x9d her visitor demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen just what we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmost been agreed upon so often is the practical impossibility of\r\nmaking any change? Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it seemed as if we really can\xe2\x80\x99t overcome\r\nconversational habits so thoroughly formed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs. Brook reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if our way of looking at things were too\r\nserious to be trifled with? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--I think it\xe2\x80\x99s only you who have\r\ndenied our sacrifices, our compromises and concessions. I myself have\r\nconstantly felt smothered in them. But there it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she impatiently\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I don\xe2\x80\x99t admit is that you\xe2\x80\x99ve given me ground to take for\r\na proof of your \xe2\x80\x98intentions\xe2\x80\x99--to use the odious term--your association\r\nwith me on behalf of the preposterous fiction, as it after all is, of\r\nNanda\xe2\x80\x99s blankness of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s head, in his chair, was thrown back; his eyes ranged over\r\nthe top of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cThere never has been any mystery about my thinking\r\nher--all in her own way--the nicest girl in London. She IS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion was silent a little. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is, by all means. Well,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthen added, \xe2\x80\x9cso far as I may have been alive to the fact of any one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthinking her so, it\xe2\x80\x99s not out of place I should mention to you the\r\ndifference made in my appreciation of it by our delightful little stay\r\nat Mertle. My views for Nanda,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9chave somehow gone up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank was prompt to show how he could understand it. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consider even Mitchy now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his friend took no notice of the question. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way Mr. Longdon\r\ndistinguishes her is quite the sort of thing that gives a girl, as\r\nHarold says, a \xe2\x80\x98leg up.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully curious and has made me think:\r\nhe isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything whatever, as London estimates go, in himself--so that\r\nwhat is it, pray, that makes him, when \xe2\x80\x98added on\xe2\x80\x99 to her, so double\r\nNanda\xe2\x80\x99s value? I somehow or other see, through his being known to back\r\nher and through the pretty story of his loyalty to mamma and all the\r\nrest of it (oh if one chose to WORK that!) ever so much more of a chance\r\nfor her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were on the ceiling. \xe2\x80\x9cIt IS curious, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?--though\r\nI think he\xe2\x80\x99s rather more \xe2\x80\x98in himself,\xe2\x80\x99 even for the London estimate,\r\nthan you quite understand.\xe2\x80\x9d He appeared to give her time to take this\r\nup, but as she said nothing he pursued: \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say that if even I now\r\nWERE to enter myself it would strike you as too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer attention to this was but indirect. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully vulgar to be\r\ntalking about it, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling that something possibly\r\nrather big will come of Mr. Longdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh we\xe2\x80\x99ve touched on that before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cand you know you\r\ndid think something might come even for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued however, as if she scarce heard him, to work out her own\r\nvision. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very true that up to now--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, up to now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked as she faltered.\r\n\r\nShe faltered still a little. \xe2\x80\x9cI do say the most hideous things. But\r\nwe HAVE said worse, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we? Up to now, I mean, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t given her\r\nanything. Unless indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she mused, \xe2\x80\x9cshe may have had something without\r\ntelling me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank went much straighter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of thing have you in mind?\r\nAre you thinking of money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it awful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you should think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I should talk this way.\xe2\x80\x9d Her friend was apparently not prepared\r\nwith an assent, and she quickly enough pursued: \xe2\x80\x9cIf he HAD given her any\r\nit would come out somehow in her expenditure. She has tremendous liberty\r\nand is very secretive, but still it would come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give her any without letting you know. Nor would she,\r\nwithout doing so,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank added, \xe2\x80\x9ctake it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook quietly said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe hates me enough for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s only your romantic theory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more she appeared not to hear him; she gave the discussion another\r\nturn. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he given YOU anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer visitor smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cNot so much as a cigarette. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always my pockets\r\nfull of them, and HE never: so he only takes mine. Oh Mrs. Brook,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cwith me too--though I\xe2\x80\x99ve also tremendous liberty!--it would\r\ncome out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d let me know,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99d let you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilence, upon this, fell between them a little; which she was the\r\nfirst to break. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone with him this afternoon--by solemn\r\nappointment--to the South Kensington Museum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s dolorous drop that yet presented the\r\nnews as a portent so great that he was moved again to mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhere she is? Then I confess she has scored. He has never taken ME to\r\nthe South Kensington Museum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were asking what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I meant\r\nwas--about Baireuth--that the question for Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s simplified. He has\r\npressed her so to pay him a visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s assent was marked. \xe2\x80\x9cI see: so that if you do go abroad\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll be provided for by that engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by lots of other invitations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese were such things as, for the most part, the young man could turn\r\nover. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean you\xe2\x80\x99d let her go alone--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wherever she\xe2\x80\x99s asked?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like\r\nthe Duchess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank seemed for a moment to try not to. \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Longdon take\r\nher? Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend looked really struck with it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat WOULD be working him. But\r\nto a beautiful end!\xe2\x80\x9d she meditated. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing would be to get him\r\nalso asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but there you are, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? Fancy \xe2\x80\x98getting\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Longdon\r\nanything or anywhere whatever! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank threw out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow the impossibility of exerting that sort of patronage for him\r\nimmediately places him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook gave her companion one of those fitful glances of almost\r\ngrateful appreciation with which their intercourse was even at its\r\ndarkest hours frequently illumined. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if he were the Primate or the\r\nFrench Ambassador? Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re right--one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it; though it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery odd and one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite see why. It does place him. But he\r\nbecomes thereby exactly the very sort of person with whom it would\r\nbe most of an advantage for her to go about. What a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook\r\nsighed, \xe2\x80\x9che doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know more people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, we ARE, in our way, bringing that to pass. Only we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrush it. Leave it to Nanda herself,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank presently added; on\r\nwhich his companion so manifestly left it that she touched after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s silence on quite a different matter. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say he\xe2\x80\x99d tell\r\nYOU--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?--if he were to give her any considerable sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had only obeyed his injunction, but he stared at the length of her\r\njump. \xe2\x80\x9cHe might attempt to do so, but I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at all like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He was moved immediately to dismiss this branch of the subject\r\nand, apparently to help himself, take up another. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean she\r\nunderstands he has asked her down for a regular long stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook barely hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cShe understands, I think, that what I\r\nexpect of her is to make it as long as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank laughed out--as it was even after ten years still possible to\r\nlaugh--at the childlike innocence with which her voice could invest the\r\nhardest teachings of life; then with something a trifle nervous in the\r\nwhole sound and manner he sprang up from his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a blessing he\r\nis to us all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but think what we must be to HIM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn immense interest, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d He took a few aimless steps and,\r\nstooping over a basket of flowers, inhaled it with violence, almost\r\nburied his face. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say we ARE interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d He had spoken rather\r\nvaguely, but Mrs. Brook knew exactly why. \xe2\x80\x9cWe render him no end of a\r\nservice. We keep him in touch with old memories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank had reached one of the windows, shaded from without by a\r\ngreat striped sun-blind beneath which and between the flower-pots of the\r\nbalcony he could see a stretch of hot relaxed street. He looked a minute\r\nat these things. \xe2\x80\x9cI do so like your phrases!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had a pause that challenged his tone. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call mamma a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98phrase\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went off again, quite with extravagance, but quickly, leaving the\r\nwindow, pulled himself up. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say we MUST put things for him--he\r\ndoes it, cares or is able to do it, so little himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. He just quietly acts. That\xe2\x80\x99s his nature, dear thing. We must\r\nLET him act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank seemed to stifle again too vivid a sense of her particular\r\nemphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes--we must let him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough it won\xe2\x80\x99t prevent Nanda, I imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d his hostess pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom\r\nfinding the fun of a whole month at Beccles--or whatever she puts\r\nin--not exactly fast and furious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank had the look of measuring what the girl might \xe2\x80\x9cput in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe place will be quiet, of course, but when a person\xe2\x80\x99s so fond of a\r\nperson--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs she is of him, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe IS fond of him, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook.\r\n\r\nHe was before her now with the air of a man who had suddenly determined\r\non a great blind leap. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what he has done? He wants me so to\r\nmarry her that he has proposed a definite basis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook got straight up. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Proposed\xe2\x80\x99? To HER?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has said a word to Nanda--in fact I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that,\r\nvery properly, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to. But he spoke to me on Sunday night\r\nat Mertle--I had a big talk with him there alone, very late, in the\r\nsmoking-room.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s stare was serious, and Vanderbank now went\r\non as if the sound of his voice helped him to meet it. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had things\r\nout very much and his kindness was extraordinary--he\xe2\x80\x99s the most\r\nbeautiful old boy that ever lived. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, now that I come to\r\nthink of it, if I\xe2\x80\x99m within my rights in telling you--and of course I\r\nshall immediately let him know that I HAVE told you; but I feel I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\narrive at any respectable sort of attitude in the matter without taking\r\nyou into my confidence. Which is really what I came here to-day to do,\r\nthough till this moment I\xe2\x80\x99ve funked it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was either, as her friends chose to think it, an advantage or a\r\ndrawback of intercourse with Mrs. Brook that, her face being at any\r\nmoment charged with the woe of the world, it was unavoidable to remain\r\nrather in the dark as to the effect there of particular strokes.\r\nSomething in Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s present study of the signs accordingly showed\r\nhe had had to learn to feel his way and had more or less mastered the\r\ntrick. That she had turned a little pale was really the one fresh\r\nmark. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Funked\xe2\x80\x99 it? Why in the world--?\xe2\x80\x9d His own colour deepened at her\r\naccent, which was a sufficient light on his having been stupid. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nmean you\xe2\x80\x99ve declined the arrangement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only, with a smile somewhat strained, continued for a moment to look\r\nat her; clearly, however, at last feeling, and not much caring, that he\r\ngot in still deeper. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re magnificent. You\xe2\x80\x99re magnificent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer lovely gaze widened out. \xe2\x80\x9cComment donc? Where--why? You HAVE\r\ndeclined her?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. After which, as he replied only with a slow\r\nhead-shake that seemed to say it was not for the moment all so simple as\r\nthat, she had one of the inspirations to which she was constitutionally\r\nsubject. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you imagine I want you myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mrs. Brook, you\xe2\x80\x99re so admirable,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned with gaiety, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nif by any chance you did, upon my honour, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I should be\r\nable not to say \xe2\x80\x98All right.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d But he spoke too more responsibly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nshy of really bringing out to you what has happened to me, for a reason\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve of course to look in the face. Whatever you want yourself, for\r\nNanda you want Mitchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d She did full justice to his explanation. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did\r\nyou say about a \xe2\x80\x98basis\xe2\x80\x99? The blessed man offers to settle--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a real prodigy,\xe2\x80\x9d her visitor answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand your imagination\r\ntakes its fences in a way that, when I\xe2\x80\x99m out with you, quite puts mine\r\nto shame. When he mentioned it to me I was quite surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook asked, \xe2\x80\x9cam not surprised a bit? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it only,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmodestly suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken him in more than you? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow he WOULD?\xe2\x80\x9d she quavered.\r\n\r\nVanderbank thought or at least pretended to. \xe2\x80\x9cMake ME the condition? How\r\ncould I be sure of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the point of his question was lost for her in the growing light. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nthen the condition\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99 only--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, at any rate, is all I have to do with. He\xe2\x80\x99s ready to settle if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to do the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo propose to her straight, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d She waited, but as he said\r\nnothing she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready. Is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m taking my time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\xe2\x80\x99d jump at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away from her now, but after some steps came back. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\r\ndo admit it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cTo YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a strange faint smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--only to me. What is it he settles?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary I stopped him off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh then,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I call declining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words appeared for an instant to strike her companion. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it? Is\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d he almost musingly repeated. But he shook himself the next moment\r\nfree of his wonder, was more what would have been called in Buckingham\r\nCrescent on the spot. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there rather something in my having thus\r\nthought it my duty to warn you that I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely his candidate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook turned impatiently away. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly--with your talk\r\nabout \xe2\x80\x98warning\xe2\x80\x99--the happiest expressions!\xe2\x80\x9d She put her face into the\r\nflowers as he had done just before; then as she raised it: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of\r\na monster are you trying to make me out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lady\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank was prompt--\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t think I say\r\nanything but what\xe2\x80\x99s fair. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it just my loyalty to you in fact that\r\nhas in this case positively strained my discretion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head in mere mild despair. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Loyalty\xe2\x80\x99 again is exquisite.\r\nThe tact of men has a charm quite its own. And you\xe2\x80\x99re rather good,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cas men go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis laugh was now a little awkward, as if she had already succeeded\r\nin making him uncomfortable. \xe2\x80\x9cI always become aware with you sooner or\r\nlater that they don\xe2\x80\x99t go at all--in your sense: but how am I, after all,\r\nso far out if you HAVE put your money on another man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou keep coming back to that?\xe2\x80\x9d she wearily sighed.\r\n\r\nHe thought a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, then. You\xe2\x80\x99ve only to tell me not to, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever speak of it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be in an odd position for speaking of it if you do really go in.\r\nYou deny that you\xe2\x80\x99ve declined,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich means then that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed our friend to hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank met it bravely. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think he hopes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd communicates his hope to my child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis arrested the young man, but only for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve the most\r\nperfect faith in his wisdom with her. I trust his particular delicacy.\r\nHe cares more for her,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently added, \xe2\x80\x9ceven than we do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook gazed away at the infinite of space. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We,\xe2\x80\x99 my dear Van,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she at last returned, \xe2\x80\x9cis one of your own real, wonderful touches. But\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s something in what you say: I HAVE, as between ourselves--between\r\nme and him--been backing Mitchy. That is I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying to him \xe2\x80\x98Wait,\r\nwait: don\xe2\x80\x99t at any rate do anything else.\xe2\x80\x99 Only it\xe2\x80\x99s just from the\r\ndepth of my thought for my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that I\xe2\x80\x99ve clung to this\r\nresource. He would so absolutely, so unreservedly do anything for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She had reached now, with her extraordinary self-control, the pitch of\r\nquiet bland demonstration. \xe2\x80\x9cI want the poor thing, que diable, to have\r\nanother string to her bow and another loaf, for her desolate old age, on\r\nthe shelf. When everything else is gone Mitchy will still be there. Then\r\nit will be at least her own fault--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can\r\nrelieve me of the primary duty of taking precautions,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound up,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen I know as well as that I stand here and look at you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, what?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked as she just paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that so far as they count on you they count, my dear Van, on a\r\nblank.\xe2\x80\x9d Holding him a minute as with the soft low voice of his fate, she\r\nsadly but firmly shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he almost too loudly protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI SAY!\xe2\x80\x9d--he made a joke of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nIt was as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t at last but show himself really struck; yet\r\nwhat he exclaimed on was what might in truth most have impressed him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE magnificent, really!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mitchett!\xe2\x80\x9d the butler, appearing at the door, almost familiarly\r\ndropped; after which Vanderbank turned straight to the person announced.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchett was there, and, anticipating Mrs. Brook in receiving him,\r\nher companion passed it straighten. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy was already all interest. \xe2\x80\x9cRather! But what\xe2\x80\x99s her last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been, though so great, so subtle, as they said in Buckingham\r\nCrescent, that Vanderbank scarce knew how to put it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nthoroughly superior.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh to whom do you say it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy cried as he greeted her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe subject of this eulogy had meanwhile returned to her sofa, where she\r\nreceived the homage of her new visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not I who am magnificent\r\na bit--it\xe2\x80\x99s dear Mr. Longdon. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just had from Van the most wonderful\r\npiece of news about him--his announcement of his wish to make it worth\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s while to marry my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Make it\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy stared. \xe2\x80\x9cBut ISN\xe2\x80\x99T it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, you must ask Van. Of course you\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought\r\nso. But I must tell you all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ndelighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy had seated himself, but Vanderbank remained erect and became\r\nperhaps even slightly stiff. He was not angry--no member of the inner\r\ncircle at Buckingham Crescent was ever angry--but he looked grave\r\nand rather troubled. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if it IS decidedly fine\xe2\x80\x9d--he addressed his\r\nhostess straight--\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make out quite why you\xe2\x80\x99re doing THIS--I mean\r\nimmediately making it known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but what do we keep from Mitchy?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat CAN you keep? It comes to the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy said. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\r\nhere we are together, share and share alike--one beautiful intelligence.\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98somebody\xe2\x80\x99 is of course Van. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to treat me as an\r\noutsider.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank looked a little foolishly, though it was but the shade of a\r\nshade, from one of them to the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been rather an ass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then by the terms of our friendship--just as Mitchy says--can he\r\nand I have a better right to know and to feel with you about? You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwant, Mitchy, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto hear all about THAT?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I only mean,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank explained, \xe2\x80\x9cin having just now blurted my\r\ntale out to you. However, I of course do know,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued to Mitchy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat whatever\xe2\x80\x99s really between us will remain between us. Let me then\r\ntell you myself exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d The length of his pause\r\nafter these words showed at last that he had stopped short; on which his\r\ncompanions, as they waited, exchanged a sympathetic look. They waited\r\nanother minute, and then he dropped into a chair where, leaning forward,\r\nhis elbows on the arms and his gaze attached to the carpet, he drew out\r\nthe silence. Finally he looked at Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cYOU make it clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe appeal called up for some reason her most infantine manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I CAN, dear Van--really CLEAR. You know however yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued to Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cenough by this time about Mr. Longdon and mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh rather!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd about mamma and Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh perfectly: the way Nanda reminds him, and the \xe2\x80\x98beautiful loyalty\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat has made him take such a fancy to her. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve already embraced\r\nthe facts--you needn\xe2\x80\x99t dot any i\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d With another glance at his fellow\r\nvisitor Mitchy jumped up and stood there florid. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has offered you\r\nmoney to marry her.\xe2\x80\x9d He said this to Vanderbank as if it were the most\r\nnatural thing in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh NO\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook interposed with promptitude: \xe2\x80\x9che has simply let him\r\nknow before any one else that the money\xe2\x80\x99s there FOR Nanda, and that\r\ntherefore--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst come first served?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy had already taken her up. \xe2\x80\x9cI see, I\r\nsee. Then to make her sure of the money,\xe2\x80\x9d he put to Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nMUST marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it depends upon that she\xe2\x80\x99ll never get it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook returned.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Van will think conscientiously a lot about it, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you, Van, really?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy asked from the hearth-rug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never. We shall be very kind to him, we shall help him, hope and\r\npray for him, but we shall be at the end,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cjust where\r\nwe are now. Dear Van will have done his best, and we shall have done\r\nours. Mr. Longdon will have done his--poor Nanda even will have done\r\nhers. But it will all have been in vain. However,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook continued\r\nto expound, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have the money. Mr. Longdon will surely\r\nconsider that she\xe2\x80\x99ll want it if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t marry still more than if she\r\ndoes. So we shall be SO much at least,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound up--\xe2\x80\x9cI mean Edward and\r\nI and the child will be--to the good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, for an equal certainty, required but an instant\xe2\x80\x99s thought. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nthere can be no doubt about THAT. The things about which your mind may\r\nnow be at ease--!\xe2\x80\x9d he cheerfully exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does make a great difference!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook comfortably sighed. Then\r\nin a different tone: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat dear Van will find at the end that he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t face will be, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? just this fact of appearing to have\r\naccepted a bribe. He won\xe2\x80\x99t want, on the one hand--out of kindness for\r\nNanda--to have the money suppressed; and yet he won\xe2\x80\x99t want to have the\r\npecuniary question mixed up with the matter: to look in short as if he\r\nhad had to be paid. He\xe2\x80\x99s like you, you know--he\xe2\x80\x99s proud; and it will be\r\nthere we shall break down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy had been watching his friend, who, a few minutes before\r\nperceptibly embarrassed, had quite recovered himself and, at his ease,\r\nthough still perhaps with a smile a trifle strained, leaned back and let\r\nhis eyes play everywhere but over the faces of the others. Vanderbank\r\nevidently wished now to show a good-humoured detachment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cI remember your once submitting to me a\r\ncase of some delicacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99ll submit it to you--he\xe2\x80\x99ll submit it even to ME\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook broke\r\nin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be charming, touching, confiding--above all he\xe2\x80\x99ll be awfully\r\nINTERESTING about it. But he\xe2\x80\x99ll make up his mind in his own way, and his\r\nown way won\xe2\x80\x99t be to accommodate Mr. Longdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy continued to study their companion in the light of these remarks,\r\nthen turned upon his hostess his sociable glare. \xe2\x80\x9cSplendid, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nthe old boy\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook just delayed. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the point of view of the immense interest\r\nit--just now, for instance--makes for you and me? Oh yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of\r\nour best things yet. It places him a little with Lady Fanny--\xe2\x80\x98He will,\r\nhe won\xe2\x80\x99t; he won\xe2\x80\x99t, he will!\xe2\x80\x99 Only, to be perfect, it lacks, as I say,\r\nthe element of real suspense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy frankly wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does, you think? Not for me--not wholly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He turned again quite pleadingly to their friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nyourself totally either?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, cultivating his detachment, made at first no more reply\r\nthan if he had not heard, and the others meanwhile showed faces that\r\ntestified perhaps less than their respective speeches had done to the\r\nabsence of anxiety. The only token he immediately gave was to get up and\r\napproach Mitchy, before whom he stood a minute laughing kindly enough,\r\nthough not altogether gaily. As if then for a better proof of gaiety\r\nhe presently seized him by the shoulders and, still without speaking,\r\npushed him backward into the chair he himself had just quitted. Mrs.\r\nBrook\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, from the sofa, while this went on, attached themselves to\r\nher visitors. It took Vanderbank, as he moved about and his companions\r\nwaited, a minute longer to produce what he had in mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat IS\r\nsplendid, as we call it, is this extraordinary freedom and good humour\r\nof our intercourse and the fact that we do care--so independently of our\r\npersonal interests, with so little selfishness or other vulgarity--to\r\nget at the idea of things. The beautiful specimen Mrs. Brook had just\r\ngiven me of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued to Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cwas what made me break\r\nout to you about her when you came in.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke to one friend, but he\r\nlooked at the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s really \xe2\x80\x98superior\xe2\x80\x99 in her is that, though\r\nI suddenly show her an interference with a favourite plan, her personal\r\nresentment\xe2\x80\x99s nothing--all she wants is to see what may really happen, to\r\ntake in the truth of the case and make the best of that. She offers me\r\nthe truth, as she sees it, about myself, and with no nasty elation if\r\nit does chance to be the truth that suits her best. It was a charming,\r\ncharming stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation was no bar to his amusement. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wonderfully\r\nright about us. But still it was a stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Brook was less diverted she followed perhaps more closely. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou do me so much justice then, why did you put to me such a cold cruel\r\nquestion?--I mean when you so oddly challenged me on my handing on your\r\nnews to Mitchy. If the principal beauty of our effort to live together\r\nis--and quite according to your own eloquence--in our sincerity, I\r\nsimply obeyed the impulse to do the sincere thing. If we\xe2\x80\x99re not sincere\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d--it was Mitchy who first responded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we ARE sincere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we ARE sincere,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank presently said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great chance\r\nfor us not to fall below ourselves: no doubt therefore we shall continue\r\nto soar and sing. We pay for it, people who don\xe2\x80\x99t like us say, in our\r\nself-consciousness--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut people who don\xe2\x80\x99t like us,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Besides,\r\nhow can we be properly conscious of each other--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank completed his idea: \xe2\x80\x9cwithout my finding myself\r\nfor instance in you and Mrs. Brook? We see ourselves reflected--we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nconscious of the charming whole. I thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued after an\r\ninstant to Mrs. Brook--\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you for your sincerity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a business sometimes really to hold her eyes, but they had,\r\nit must be said for her, their steady moments. She exchanged with\r\nVanderbank a somewhat remarkable look, then, with an art of her own,\r\nbroke short off without appearing to drop him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d--she appealed to Mitchy--\xe2\x80\x9cfor us not to be so awfully clever\r\nas to make it believed that we can never be simple. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t see TOO\r\ntremendous things--even in each other.\xe2\x80\x9d She quite lost patience with the\r\ndanger she glanced at. \xe2\x80\x9cWe CAN be simple!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe CAN, by God!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we are now--and it\xe2\x80\x99s a great comfort to have it settled,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nVanderbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you see,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook returned, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a mistake you\xe2\x80\x99d make to see\r\nabysses of subtlety in my having been merely natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe CAN be natural,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can, by God!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had turned to Mitchy. \xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted you to know. So I spoke.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not more complicated than that. As for WHY I wanted you to know--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat better reason could there be,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cthan your\r\nbeing filled to the finger-tips with the sense of how I would want it\r\nmyself, and of the misery, the absolute pathos, of my being left out?\r\nFancy, my dear chap\xe2\x80\x9d--he had only to put it to Van--\xe2\x80\x9cmy NOT knowing!\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nVanderbank evidently couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fancy it, but he said quietly enough: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould have told you myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh there IS a difference,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook loyally said. Then she opened\r\nan inch or two, for Vanderbank, the door of her dim radiance. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\nI should have thought it a difference for the better. Of course,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cit remains absolutely with us three alone, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you already\r\nfeel from it the fresh charm--with it here between us--of our being\r\ntogether?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if each of the men had waited for the other to assent better\r\nthan he himself could and Mitchy then, as Vanderbank failed, had\r\ngracefully, to cover him, changed the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t Nanda, the\r\nperson most interested, to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank gave on this a strange sound of hilarity. \xe2\x80\x9cAh that would\r\nfinish it off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt produced for a few seconds something like a chill, a chill that had\r\nfor consequence a momentary pause which in its turn added weight to the\r\nwords next uttered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not I who shall tell her,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook said\r\ngently and gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cThere!--you may be sure. If you want a promise,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a promise. So that if Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s silent,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nare, Mitchy, and I am, how in the world shall she have a suspicion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean of course except by Van\xe2\x80\x99s deciding to mention it himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan might have been, from the way they looked at him, some beautiful\r\nunconscious object; but Mrs. Brook was quite ready to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cOh poor\r\nman, HE\xe2\x80\x99LL never breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. So there we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this discussion the subject of it had for the time nothing to\r\ncontribute, even when Mitchy, rising with the words he had last uttered\r\nfrom the chair in which he had been placed, took sociably as well, on\r\nthe hearth-rug, a position before their hostess. This move ministered\r\napparently to Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s mere silence, for it was still without\r\nspeaking that, after a little, he turned away from his friend and\r\ndropped once more into the same seat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve shown you already, you of\r\ncourse remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank presently said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly\r\naware of how much better Mrs. Brook would like YOU for the position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks I want him myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook blandly explained.\r\n\r\nShe was indeed, as they always thought her, \xe2\x80\x9cwonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d but she was\r\nperhaps not even now so much so as Mitchy found himself able to be. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nhow would you lose old Van--even at the worst?\xe2\x80\x9d he earnestly asked of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by the worst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen even at the best,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the event of his falsifying\r\nyour prediction; which, by the way, has the danger, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?--I mean\r\nfor your intellectual credit--of making him, as we all used to be called\r\nby our nursemaids, \xe2\x80\x98contrairy.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook returned. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he won\xe2\x80\x99t do, on the\r\nwhole, even for the sweetness of spiting me, what he won\xe2\x80\x99t want to do.\r\n_I_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t said I should lose him,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s only the view\r\nhe himself takes--or, to do him perfect justice, the idea he candidly\r\nimputes to me; though without, I imagine--for I don\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as\r\nthat--attributing to me anything so unutterably bete as a feeling of\r\njealousy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of my supposing anything inept of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nsaid on this, \xe2\x80\x9cif you understood to the full how I keep on admiring you.\r\nOnly what stupefies me a little,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis the extraordinary\r\ncritical freedom--or we may call it if we like the high intellectual\r\ndetachment--with which we discuss a question touching you, dear\r\nMrs. Brook, so nearly and engaging so your private and most sacred\r\nsentiments. What are we playing with, after all, but the idea of Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m not playing!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook declared with a little rattle of\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not playing\xe2\x80\x9d--Mr. Mitchett gravely confirmed it. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nfeel in the very air the vibration of the passion that she\xe2\x80\x99s simply too\r\ncharming to shake at the window as the housemaid shakes the tablecloth\r\nor the jingo the flag?\xe2\x80\x9d Then he took up what Vanderbank had previously\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, my dear man, I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x98aware,\xe2\x80\x99 as you just now put it, of\r\neverything, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not indiscreet, am I, Mrs. Brook? in admitting for\r\nyou as well as for myself that there WAS an impossibility you and I used\r\nsometimes to turn over together. Only--Lord bless us all!--it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\nif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t long ago seen that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing at all FOR me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh wait, wait!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook put in. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has a theory\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank, from\r\nhis chair, lighted it up for Mitchy, who hovered before them--\xe2\x80\x9cthat your\r\nchance WILL come, later on, after I\xe2\x80\x99ve given my measure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy was quick to respond, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\ndo! You won\xe2\x80\x99t give your measure the least little bit. You\xe2\x80\x99ll walk in\r\nmagnificent mystery \xe2\x80\x98later on\xe2\x80\x99 not a bit less than you do today;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have the benefit of everything that our imagination,\r\nperpetually engaged, often baffled and never fatigued, will continue\r\nto bedeck you with. Nanda, in the same way, to the end of all her time,\r\nwill simply remain exquisite, or genuine, or generous--whatever we\r\nchoose to call it. It may make a difference to us, who are comparatively\r\nvulgar, but what difference will it make to HER whether you do or you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t decide for her? You can\xe2\x80\x99t belong to her more, for herself, than\r\nyou do already--and that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely so much that there\xe2\x80\x99s no room for\r\nany one else. Where therefore, without that room, do I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank seemed obligingly to muse.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had followed Mitchy with marked admiration, but she gave on\r\nthis a glance at Van that was like the toss of a blossom from the same\r\nbranch. \xe2\x80\x9cOh then shall I just go on with you BOTH? That WILL be joy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She had, however, the next thing, a sudden drop which shaded the\r\npicture. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so divine, Mitchy, that how can you not in the long-run\r\nbreak ANY woman down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not as if Mitchy was struck--it was only that he was courteous.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call the long-run? Taking about till I\xe2\x80\x99m eighty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh your genius is of a kind to which middle life will be particularly\r\nfavourable. You\xe2\x80\x99ll reap then somehow, one feels, everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nsown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy still accepted the prophecy only to control it. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call\r\neighty middle life? Why, my moral beauty, my dear woman--if that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nyou mean by my genius--is precisely my curse. What on earth--is left for\r\na man just rotten with goodness? It renders necessary the kind of liking\r\nthat renders unnecessary anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that IS cheap paradox!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank patiently sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re down\r\nfor a fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was with less of the patience perhaps that Mrs. Brook took this up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, on that we ARE stiff. Five pounds, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy drew out his pocket-book even though he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean\r\nis that I don\xe2\x80\x99t give out the great thing.\xe2\x80\x9d With which he produced a\r\ncrisp banknote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDON\xe2\x80\x99T you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Vanderbank, who, having taken it from him to hand to\r\nMrs. Brook, held it a moment, delicately, to accentuate the doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great thing\xe2\x80\x99s the sacred terror. It\xe2\x80\x99s you who give THAT out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d--and Vanderbank laid the money on the small stand at Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t I right, Mrs. Brook?--doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he, tremendously, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nmore than anything else what does it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two again, as if they understood each other, gazed in a unity\r\nof interest at their companion, who sustained it with an air clearly\r\nintended as the happy mean between embarrassment and triumph. Then Mrs.\r\nBrook showed she liked the phrase. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sacred terror! Yes, one feels\r\nit. It IS that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe finest case of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met. So my\r\nmoral\xe2\x80\x99s sufficiently pointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it can be said to be that,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank returned, \xe2\x80\x9ctill\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve put the whole thing into a box by doing for Nanda what she does\r\nmost want you to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy caught on without a shade of wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cOh by proposing to the\r\nDuchess for little Aggie?\xe2\x80\x9d He took but an instant to turn it over.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I WOULD propose--to please Nanda. Only I\xe2\x80\x99ve never yet quite made\r\nout the reason of her wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason is largely,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, being very fond of\r\nAggie and in fact extremely admiring her, she wants to do something\r\ngood for her and to keep her from anything bad. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know--it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo charming--she regularly believes in her?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy, with all his\r\nrecognition, vibrated to the touch. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it too charming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank went on, \xe2\x80\x9cshe secures for her friend a phoenix\r\nlike you, and secures for you a phoenix like her friend. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to\r\nsay for which of you she desires most to do the handsome thing. She\r\nloves you both in short\xe2\x80\x9d--he followed it up--\xe2\x80\x9cthough perhaps when one\r\nthinks of it the price she puts on you, Mitchy, in the arrangement, is\r\na little the higher. Awfully fine at any rate--and yet awfully odd\r\ntoo--her feeling for Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s type, which is divided by such abysses from\r\nher own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cbut think then of her feeling for mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, still more at his ease now and with his head back, had\r\nhis eyes aloft and far. \xe2\x80\x9cOh there are things in Nanda--!\xe2\x80\x9d The others\r\nexchanged a glance at this, while their companion added: \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreally the sort of creature she would have liked to be able to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have adored her even if she HAD been\r\nable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had for some minutes played no audible part, but the acute\r\nobserver we are constantly taking for granted would perhaps have\r\ndetected in her, as one of the effects of the special complexion to-day\r\nof Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s presence, a certain smothered irritation. \xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npossibly have been able,\xe2\x80\x9d she now interposed, \xe2\x80\x9cwith so loose--or rather,\r\nto express it more properly, with so perverse--a mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, my dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy promptly qualified, \xe2\x80\x9chow if in little\r\nAggie\xe2\x80\x99s case the Duchess hasn\xe2\x80\x99t prevented--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook was full of wisdom. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s a different thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m not,\r\nas a mother--am I, Van?--bad ENOUGH. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me.\r\nAggie, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? is the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s morality, her virtue; which, by\r\nhaving it that way outside of you, as one may say, you can make a much\r\nbetter thing of. The child has been for Jane, I admit, a capital little\r\nsubject, but Jane has kept her on hand and finished her like some\r\nwonderful piece of stitching. Oh as work it\xe2\x80\x99s of a soigne! There it\r\nis--to show. A woman like me has to be HERSELF, poor thing, her virtue\r\nand her morality. What will you have? It\xe2\x80\x99s our lumbering English plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that her daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy sympathised, \xe2\x80\x9ccan only, by the\r\narrangement, hope to become at the best her immorality and her vice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Brook, without an answer for the question, appeared suddenly to\r\nhave plunged into a sea of thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way for Nanda to have been\r\nREALLY nice--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould have been for YOU to be like Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy and his hostess seemed for a minute, on this, to gaze together\r\nat the tragic truth. Then she shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cWe see our mistakes\r\ntoo late.\xe2\x80\x9d She repeated the movement, but as if to let it all go, and\r\nVanderbank meanwhile, pulling out his watch, had got up with a laugh\r\nthat showed some inattention and made to Mitchy a remark about their\r\nwalking away together. Mitchy, engaged for the instant with Mrs. Brook,\r\nhad assented only with a nod, but the attitude of the two men had become\r\nthat of departure. Their friend looked at them as if she would like to\r\nkeep one of them, and for a purpose connected somehow with the other,\r\nbut was oddly, almost ludicrously, embarrassed to choose. What was in\r\nher face indeed during this short passage might prove to have been,\r\nshould we penetrate, the flicker of a sense that in spite of all\r\nintimacy and amiability they could, at bottom and as things commonly\r\nturned out, only be united against her. Yet she made at the end a sort\r\nof choice in going on to Mitchy: \xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all told you the real\r\nreason of Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s idea that you should go in for Aggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I draw the line there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, he understands\r\nthat too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, on the spot, did himself and every one justice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy it just\r\ndisposes of me, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made Vanderbank, restless now and turning about the room, stop with a\r\nsmile at Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cWe understand too well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied after a moment while she\r\nturned to Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat his real \xe2\x80\x98combination\xe2\x80\x99 can in the nature of the\r\ncase only be--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy took her straight up--\xe2\x80\x9cwith the young thing who is, as\r\nyou say, positively and helplessly modern and the pious fraud of whose\r\nclassic identity with a sheet of white paper has been--ah tacitly\r\nof course, but none the less practically!--dropped. You\xe2\x80\x99ve so often\r\nreminded me. I do understand. If I were to go in for Aggie it would only\r\nbe to oblige. The modern girl, the product of our hard London facts and\r\nof her inevitable consciousness of them just as they are--she, wonderful\r\nbeing, IS, I fully recognise, my real affair, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not ashamed to say\r\nthat when I like the individual I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of the type. She knows\r\ntoo much--I don\xe2\x80\x99t say; but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know after all a millionth part\r\nof what _I_ do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook earnestly exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe had rung out and he kept it up with a limpidity unusual. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd product\r\nfor product, when you come to that, I\xe2\x80\x99m a queerer one myself than any\r\nother. The traditions _I_ smash!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had got up and Vanderbank had gone again to the window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a pair of monsters and your\r\nmonstrosity fits. She does know too much,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy with resolution, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot ALL--unless,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s only a sweet way of\r\nsaying that it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yours too--immensely; in fact every one\xe2\x80\x99s. Even Edward\xe2\x80\x99s, I dare\r\nsay; and certainly, unmistakably, Harold\xe2\x80\x99s. Ah and Van\xe2\x80\x99s own--rather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mitchy continued; \xe2\x80\x9cfor all he turns his back and will have nothing to\r\nsay to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was on the back Vanderbank turned that Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s eyes now rested.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe faced straight about. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny my part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shone at them brightly enough, and Mrs. Brook, thoughtful, wistful,\r\ncandid, took in for a moment the radiance. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet to think that after\r\nall it has been mere TALK!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in her tone again made her hearers laugh out; so it was still\r\nwith the air of good humour that Vanderbank answered: \xe2\x80\x9cMere, mere, mere.\r\nBut perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the \xe2\x80\x98mere\xe2\x80\x99 that has made us range so wide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence abounded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the\r\nexcuse of passion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companions once more gave way to mirth, but \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank said after an instant less sociably. With it too he held out\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered as she gave him her own; on which, as\r\nhe made no rejoinder, she held him before her. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean you REALLY\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know if she gets it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe money, if he DOESN\xe2\x80\x99T go in?\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy broke almost with an air\r\nof responsibility into Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s silence. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but, as we said,\r\nsurely--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes that Vanderbank met. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I should suppose she\r\ngets it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps then, as a compensation, she\xe2\x80\x99ll even get MORE--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t go in? Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank. And he changed colour.\r\n\r\nHe was by this time off, but Mrs. Brook kept Mitchy a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNow--by\r\nthat suggestion--he has something to show. He won\xe2\x80\x99t go in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHer visitors had been gone half an hour, but she was still in the\r\ndrawing-room when Nanda came back. The girl found her, on the sofa, in a\r\nposture that might have represented restful oblivion, but that, after\r\na glance, our young lady appeared to interpret as mere intensity of\r\nthought. It was a condition from which at all events Mrs. Brook was\r\nquickly roused by her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s presence: she opened her eyes and put\r\ndown her feet, so that the two were confronted as closely as persons\r\nmay be when it is only one of them who looks at the other. Nanda, gazing\r\nvaguely about and not seeking a seat, slowly drew off her gloves while\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s sad eyes considered her from top to toe. \xe2\x80\x9cTea\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mrs. Brook then said as if there were something in the loss peculiarly\r\nirretrievable. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9che gave you all you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear yes, thank you--I\xe2\x80\x99ve had lots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda hovered there slim and charming, feathered and ribboned, dressed\r\nin thin fresh fabrics and faint colours, with something in the effect\r\nof it all to which the sweeter deeper melancholy in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nseemed happily to testify. \xe2\x80\x9cJust turn round, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d The girl immediately\r\nobeyed, and Mrs. Brook once more took everything in. \xe2\x80\x9cThe back\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbest--only she didn\xe2\x80\x99t do what she said she would. How they do lie!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ngently quavered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but we lie so to THEM.\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda had swung round again, producing\r\nevidently on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s part, by the admirable \xe2\x80\x9chang\xe2\x80\x9d of her light\r\nskirts, a still deeper peace. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean the middle fold?--I knew she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my back to be best--I don\xe2\x80\x99t walk backward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook resignedly mused; \xe2\x80\x9cyou dress for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh how can you say that,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I never stick in a pin\r\nbut what I think of YOU!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook moralised, \xe2\x80\x9cone must always, I consider, think, as a\r\nsort of point de repere, of some one good person. Only it\xe2\x80\x99s best if it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na person one\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of. You do very well, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not enough. What\r\none really requires is a kind of salutary terror. I never stick in a pin\r\nwithout thinking of your Cousin Jane. What is it that some one quotes\r\nsomewhere about some one\xe2\x80\x99s having said that \xe2\x80\x98Our antagonist is our\r\nhelper--he prevents our being superficial\xe2\x80\x99? The extent to which with\r\nmy poor clothes the Duchess prevents ME--!\xe2\x80\x9d It was a measure Mrs. Brook\r\ncould give only by the general soft wail of her submission to fate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Duchess isn\xe2\x80\x99t a woman, is she? She\xe2\x80\x99s a standard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speech had for Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s companion, however, no effect of pleasantry\r\nor irony, and it was a mark of the special intercourse of these good\r\nfriends that though they showed each other, in manner and tone, such\r\nsustained consideration as might almost have given it the stamp of\r\ndiplomacy, there was yet in it also something of that economy of\r\nexpression which is the result of a common experience. The recurrence\r\nof opportunity to observe them together would have taught a spectator\r\nthat--on Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s side doubtless more particularly--their relation\r\nwas governed by two or three remarkably established and, as might have\r\nbeen said, refined laws, the spirit of which was to guard against the\r\nvulgarity so often coming to the surface between parent and child. That\r\nthey WERE as good friends as if Nanda had not been her daughter was a\r\ntruth that no passage between them might fail in one way or another to\r\nillustrate. Nanda had gathered up, for that matter, early in life, a\r\nflower of maternal wisdom: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople talk about conscience, but it seems\r\nto me one must just bring it up to a certain point and leave it\r\nthere. You can let your conscience alone if you\xe2\x80\x99re nice to the second\r\nhousemaid.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook was as \xe2\x80\x9cnice\xe2\x80\x9d to Nanda as she was to Sarah\r\nCurd--which involved, as may easily be imagined, the happiest conditions\r\nfor Sarah. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, reverting to the Duchess on a final\r\nappraisement of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s air, \xe2\x80\x9cI really think I do well by you and\r\nthat Jane wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say to-day. You look awfully like\r\nmamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she then threw off as if for the first time of mentioning it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Cousin Jane doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for that,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda returned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook like is Aggie, for all I try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try--you can do nothing with it. One must be what one\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook was almost sententious, but Nanda, with civility, let it\r\npass. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one in London touches her. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite by herself. When one\r\nsees her one feels her to be the real thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, without harshness, wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by the real\r\nthing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Nanda, however, had to think a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the real young one. That\xe2\x80\x99s what Lord Petherton calls her,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmildly joked--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98the young \xe2\x80\x98un\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mother\xe2\x80\x99s echo was not for the joke, but for something else. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nwhat you mean. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of being good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, isn\xe2\x80\x99t Aggie of a\r\ngoodness--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking of her. I was asking myself what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of MY\r\nbeing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help it any more than the Duchess can help--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but she could if she would!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook broke in with a sharper\r\nring than she had yet given. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t help being good perhaps, if that\r\nburden\xe2\x80\x99s laid on us--but there are lengths in other directions we\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nabsolutely obliged to go. And what I think of when I stick in the pins,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis that Jane seems to me really never to have had to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She appeared for a minute to brood on this till she could no longer\r\nbear it; after which she jerked out: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy she has never had to pay for\r\nANYthing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda had by this time seated herself, taking her place, under the\r\ninterest of their talk, on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s sofa, where, except for the\r\nremoval of her long soft gloves, which one of her hands again and again\r\ndrew caressingly through the other, she remained very much as if she\r\nwere some friendly yet circumspect young visitor to whom Mrs. Brook had\r\non some occasion dropped \xe2\x80\x9cDO come.\xe2\x80\x9d But there was something perhaps more\r\nexpressly conciliatory in the way she had kept everything on: as if, in\r\nparticular serenity and to confirm kindly Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s sense of what had\r\nbeen done for her, she had neither taken off her great feathered hat nor\r\nlaid down her parasol of pale green silk, the \xe2\x80\x9cmatch\xe2\x80\x9d of hat and ribbons\r\nand which had an expensive precious knob. Our spectator would possibly\r\nhave found too much earnestness in her face to be sure if there was also\r\ncandour. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you mean that YOU have had to pay--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--all the while.\xe2\x80\x9d With this Mrs. Brook was a little short, and\r\nalso as she added as if to banish a slight awkwardness: \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nit discourage you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda seemed an instant to weigh the advice, and the whole thing would\r\nhave been striking as another touch in the picture of the odd want, on\r\nthe part of each, of any sense of levity in the other. Whatever escape,\r\nface to face, mother or daughter might ever seek would never be the\r\nhumorous one--a circumstance, notwithstanding, that would not in every\r\ncase have failed to make their interviews droll for a third person. It\r\nwould always indeed for such a person have produced an impression of\r\ntension beneath the surface. \xe2\x80\x9cI could have done much better at the start\r\nand have lost less time,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl at last said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the\r\ndrawback of not really remembering Granny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well, _I_ remember her!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook moaned with an accent that\r\nevidently struck her the next moment as so much out of place that she\r\nslightly deflected. She took Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s parasol and held it as if--a more\r\ndelicate thing much than any one of hers--she simply liked to have it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer clothes--at your age at least--must have been hideous. Was it at\r\nthe place he took you to that he gave you tea?\xe2\x80\x9d she then went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, at the Museum. We had an orgy in the refreshment-room. But he took\r\nme afterwards to Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s, where we had another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went IN with you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook had suddenly flashed into eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--I made him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary--very much. But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do everything he wants,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Nanda.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook seemed to wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you\xe2\x80\x99ve also to want it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no--THAT isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. What I suppose I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthat he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want. But he does quite enough,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who then was at Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh poor old Tish herself, naturally, and Carrie Donner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no one else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl just waited. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Cashmore came in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mother gave a groan of impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cAh AGAIN?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda thought an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean, \xe2\x80\x98again\xe2\x80\x99? He just lives there\r\nas much as he ever did, and Tishy can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of Mr. Longdon--of THEIR meeting. When he met him here\r\nthat time he liked it so little. Did he like it any more to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBrook quavered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, he hated it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he--if he should go in--known he WOULD?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perfectly. But he wanted to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see--?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook just threw out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, where I go so much. And he knew I wished it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see why,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook mildly observed. And then as her\r\ndaughter said nothing to help her: \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate he did loathe it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda, for a reply, simply after an instant put a question. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how\r\ncan he understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, like me, why you do go there so much? How can he indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl returned--\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s just that he understands\r\nperfectly, because he saw them all, in such an extraordinary way--well,\r\nwhat can I ever call it?--clutch me and cling to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, with full gravity, considered this picture. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd was Mr.\r\nCashmore to-day so ridiculous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh he\xe2\x80\x99s not ridiculous, mamma--he\xe2\x80\x99s very unhappy. He thinks now Lady\r\nFanny probably won\xe2\x80\x99t go, but he feels that may be after all only the\r\nworse for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe WILL go,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook answered with one of her roundabout approaches\r\nto decision. \xe2\x80\x9cHe IS too great an idiot. She was here an hour ago, and if\r\never a woman was packed--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda objected, \xe2\x80\x9cbut doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she spend her time in packing and\r\nunpacking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis enquiry, however, scarce pulled up her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--though she HAS,\r\nno doubt, hitherto wasted plenty of labour. She has now a dozen boxes--I\r\ncould see them there in her wonderful eyes--just waiting to be called\r\nfor. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re counting on her not going, my dear--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook gave\r\na head-shake that was the warning of wisdom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what she does!\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I meant just now\r\nwas that Mr. Longdon couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why, with so much to make them\r\nso, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be decently happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he wish you to explain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it any better. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like them. He\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t even care for Tish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told you so--right out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda said, \xe2\x80\x9cof course I asked him. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t press him, because I\r\nnever do--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never do?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook broke in as with the glimpse of a new light.\r\n\r\nThe girl showed an indulgence for this interest that was for a moment\r\nalmost elderly. \xe2\x80\x9cI enjoy awfully with him seeing just how to take him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tone and her face evidently put forth for her companion at this\r\njuncture something freshly, even quite supremely suggestive; and yet the\r\neffect of them on Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s part was only a question so off-hand that\r\nit might already often have been asked. The mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, to ask it,\r\nwe may none the less add, attached themselves closely to the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand her face just glowed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou like him so very awfully?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if the next instant Nanda felt herself on her guard. Yet she\r\nspoke with a certain surrender. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather intoxicating to be\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self--!\xe2\x80\x9d She had only a drop over the choice of her term.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo tremendously made up to, you mean--even by a little fussy ancient\r\nman? But DOESN\xe2\x80\x99T he, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook continued with encouragement,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmake up to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA supposititious spectator would certainly on this have imagined in the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s face the delicate dawn of a sense that her mother had suddenly\r\nbecome vulgar, together with a general consciousness that the way\r\nto meet vulgarity was always to be frank and simple and above all to\r\nignore. \xe2\x80\x9cHe makes one enjoy being liked so much--liked better, I do\r\nthink, than I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been liked by any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Brook hesitated it was, however, clearly not because she had\r\nnoticed. \xe2\x80\x9cNot better surely than by dear Mitchy? Or even if you come to\r\nthat by Tishy herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda\xe2\x80\x99s simplicity maintained itself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s different from\r\nTishy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mother again hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean of course he knows more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl considered it. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know MORE. But he knows other\r\nthings. And he\xe2\x80\x99s pleasanter than Mitchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if she had not heard that Nanda continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\nbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO-oh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Brook, with a drawn-out extravagance of comment that\r\namounted to an impugnment of her taste even by herself.\r\n\r\nIt contributed to Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s quietness. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most beautiful\r\npeople in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion at this, with a quick wonder, fixed her. \xe2\x80\x9cDOES he, my\r\ndear, want to marry you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--to all sorts of ridiculous people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I mean--would you take HIM?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda, rising, met the question with a short ironic \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d that showed\r\nher first impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so charming being liked without being\r\napproved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Brook only wanted to know. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t approve--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but it makes no difference. It\xe2\x80\x99s all exactly right--it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook seemed to wonder, however, exactly how these things could\r\nbe. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to give up anything?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked as if swiftly\r\nthinking what Nanda MIGHT give up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if for an instant she found her daughter inscrutable; then she\r\nhad a strange smile. \xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl was perfectly prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything. But he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like me\r\nnearly so much if I really did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mother had a further pause. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he want to ADOPT you?\xe2\x80\x9d Then more\r\nquickly and sadly, though also a little as if lacking nerve to push the\r\nresearch: \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give you up, Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you so much, mamma. But we shan\xe2\x80\x99t be very much tried,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause what it comes to seems to be that I\xe2\x80\x99m really what you may\r\ncall adopting HIM. I mean I\xe2\x80\x99m little by little changing him--gradually\r\nshowing him that, as I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have been different, and as\r\nalso of course one can\xe2\x80\x99t keep giving up, the only way is for him not to\r\nmind, and to take me just as I am. That, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? is what he would\r\nnever have expected to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook recognised in a manner the explanation, but still had her\r\nwistfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut--a--to take you, \xe2\x80\x98as you are,\xe2\x80\x99 WHERE?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to the South Kensington Museum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook. Then, however, in a more exemplary tone: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nenjoy so very much your long hours with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda appeared for an instant to think how to express it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngreat friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd always talking about Granny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no--really almost never now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think so awfully much of her?\xe2\x80\x9d There was an oddity of\r\neagerness in the question--a hope, a kind of dash, for something that\r\nmight have been in Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\r\n\r\nThe girl met these things only with obliging gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlosing any sense of my likeness. He\xe2\x80\x99s too used to it--or too many things\r\nthat are too different now cover it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook as she took this in, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully\r\nclever of you to get only the good of him and have none of the worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe worry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou leave that all to ME,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother went on, but quite forgivingly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope at any rate that the good, for you, will be real.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReal?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl, remaining vague, again echoed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook showed for this not perhaps an irritation, but a flicker of\r\nausterity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must remember we\xe2\x80\x99ve a great many things to think about.\r\nThere are things we must take for granted in each other--we must all\r\nhelp in our way to pull the coach. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean by worry, and if\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t have any so much the better for you. For me it\xe2\x80\x99s in the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork. Your father and I have most to think about always at this time, as\r\nyou perfectly know--when we have to turn things round and manage somehow\r\nor other to get out of town, have to provide and pinch, to meet all the\r\nnecessities, with money, money, money at every turn running away like\r\nwater. The children this year seem to fit into nothing, into nowhere,\r\nand Harold\xe2\x80\x99s more dreadful than he has ever been, doing nothing at all\r\nfor himself and requiring everything to be done for him. He talks about\r\nhis American girl, with millions, who\xe2\x80\x99s so awfully taken with him, but\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t find out anything about her: the only one, just now, that people\r\nseem to have heard of is the one Booby Manger\xe2\x80\x99s engaged to. The Mangers\r\nliterally snap up everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook quite wailingly now continued:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Jew man, so gigantically rich--who is he? Baron Schack or\r\nSchmack--who has just taken Cumberland House and who has the awful\r\nstammer--or what is it? no roof to his mouth--is to give that horrid\r\nlittle Algie, to do his conversation for him, four hundred a year, which\r\nHarold pretended to me that, of all the rush of young men--dozens!--HE\r\nwas most in the running for. Your father\xe2\x80\x99s settled gloom is terrible,\r\nand I bear all the brunt of it; we get literally nothing this year for\r\nthe Hovel, yet have to spend on it heaven knows what; and everybody, for\r\nthe next three months, in Scotland and everywhere, has asked us for the\r\nwrong time and nobody for the right: so that I assure you I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere to turn--which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t however in the least prevent every one\r\ncoming to me with their own selfish troubles.\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if Mrs. Brook\r\nhad found the cup of her secret sorrows suddenly jostled by some touch\r\nof which the perversity, though not completely noted at the moment,\r\nproved, as she a little let herself go, sufficient to make it flow over;\r\nbut she drew, the next thing, from her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s stillness a reflexion\r\nof the vanity of such heat and speedily recovered herself as if in order\r\nwith more dignity to point the moral. \xe2\x80\x9cI can carry my burden and shall\r\ndo so to the end; but we must each remember that we shall fall to pieces\r\nif we don\xe2\x80\x99t manage to keep hold of some little idea of responsibility. I\r\npositively can\xe2\x80\x99t arrange without knowing when it is you go to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mr. Longdon? Oh whenever I like,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda replied very gently and\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when shall you be so good as to like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he goes himself on Saturday, and if I want I can go a few days\r\nlater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what day can you go if I want?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook spoke as with a small\r\nsharpness--just softened indeed in time--produced by the sight of a\r\nfreedom in her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s life that suddenly loomed larger than any\r\nfreedom of her own. It was still a part of the unsteadiness of the\r\nvessel of her anxieties; but she never after all remained publicly long\r\nsubject to the influence she often comprehensively designated to others\r\nas well as to herself as \xe2\x80\x9cnastiness.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean is that you might go\r\nthe same day, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith him--in the train? I should think so if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut would HE wish it? I mean would he hate it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so at all, but I can easily ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s head inclined to the chimney and her eyes to the window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda looked for a moment mystified by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s insistence. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nat any rate perfectly try it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemembering even that mamma would never have pushed so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda\xe2\x80\x99s face seemed to concede even that condition. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she at all\r\nevents serenely replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI really think we\xe2\x80\x99re good friends enough for\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt might have been, for the light it quickly produced, exactly what her\r\nmother had been working to make her say. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call that then, I\r\nshould like to know, but his adopting you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it matters much what it\xe2\x80\x99s called.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as it brings with it, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook asked, \xe2\x80\x9call the\r\nadvantages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, who had now begun dimly to smile--\xe2\x80\x9ccall them\r\nadvantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cOne would be quite ready to do that if one only\r\nknew a little more exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re to consist of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the great advantage, I feel, is doing something for HIM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda\xe2\x80\x99s companion, at this, hesitated afresh. \xe2\x80\x9cBut doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that, my\r\ndear, put the extravagance of your surrender to him on rather an odd\r\nfooting? Charity, love, begins at home, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of merely\r\nGIVING, you\xe2\x80\x99ve objects enough for your bounty without going so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl, as her stare showed, was held a moment by her surprise, which\r\npresently broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought you wanted me so to be nice to\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t think me very vulgar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\ntell you that I want you still more to have some idea of what you\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nby it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no wish,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cto keep on boring you with Mitchy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda pleaded.\r\n\r\nHer mother stopped as short as if there had been something in her tone\r\nto set the limit the more utterly for being unstudied. Yet poor Mrs.\r\nBrook couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave it there. \xe2\x80\x9cThen what do you get instead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of Mitchy? Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook at this turned away, moving over to the window with quickened\r\nweariness. Nanda, on her side, as if their talk had ended, went across\r\nto the sofa to take up her parasol before leaving the room, an impulse\r\nrather favoured than arrested by the arrival of her brother Harold, who\r\ncame in at the moment both his relatives had turned a back to the door\r\nand who gave his sister, as she faced him, a greeting that made their\r\nmother look round. \xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Nan--you ARE lovely! Ain\xe2\x80\x99t she lovely,\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook answered, not, however, otherwise noticing him. Her\r\ndomestic despair centred at this instant all in her daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\r\nthen, we shall consider--your father and I--that he must take the\r\nconsequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda had now her hand on the door, while Harold had dropped on the\r\nsofa. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d she just sounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean Mr. Longdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you mean by the consequence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it will do for the beginning of it that you\xe2\x80\x99ll please go down\r\nWITH him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Saturday then? Thanks, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl returned.\r\n\r\nShe was instantly gone, on which Mrs. Brook had more attention for her\r\nson. This, after an instant, as she approached the sofa and raised her\r\neyes from the little table beside it, came straight out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere in the\r\nworld is that five-pound note?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold looked vacantly about him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat five-pound note?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SEVENTH. MITCHY\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s garden took in three acres and, full of charming features,\r\nhad for its greatest wonder the extent and colour of its old brick wall,\r\nin which the pink and purple surface was the fruit of the mild ages\r\nand the protective function, for a visitor strolling, sitting, talking,\r\nreading, that of a nurse of reverie. The air of the place, in the August\r\ntime, thrilled all the while with the bliss of birds, the hum of little\r\nlives unseen and the flicker of white butterflies. It was on the large\r\nflat enclosed lawn that Nanda spoke to Vanderbank of the three weeks she\r\nwould have completed there on the morrow--weeks that had been--she made\r\nno secret of it--the happiest she had yet spent anywhere. The greyish\r\nday was soft and still and the sky faintly marbled, while the more newly\r\narrived of the visitors from London, who had come late on the Friday\r\nafternoon, lounged away the morning in an attitude every relaxed line\r\nof which referred to the holiday he had, as it were--at first merely\r\nlooking about and victualling--sat down in front of as a captain before\r\na city. There were sitting-places, just there, out of the full light,\r\ncushioned benches in the thick wide spread of old mulberry-boughs. A\r\nlarge book of facts lay in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s lap, and Nanda had come out\r\nto him, half an hour before luncheon, somewhat as Beatrice came out to\r\nBenedick: not to call him immediately indeed to the meal, but mentioning\r\npromptly that she had come at a bidding. Mr. Longdon had rebuked her, it\r\nappeared, for her want of attention to their guest, showing her in\r\nthis way, to her pleasure, how far he had gone toward taking her, as he\r\ncalled it, into the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking of yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank asked, \xe2\x80\x9cas a mere clerk\r\nat a salary, and you now find that you\xe2\x80\x99re a partner and have a share in\r\nthe concern?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to be something like that. But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t a partner put in\r\nsomething? What have I put in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--ME, for one thing. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it your being here that has brought me\r\ndown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come for him alone? Then don\xe2\x80\x99t you make\r\nanything of his attraction? You ought to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he likes\r\nyou so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, longing for a river, was in white flannels, and he took\r\nher question with a happy laugh, a handsome face of good humour that\r\ncompleted the effect of his long, cool fairness. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind my just\r\nsitting still, do you mind letting me smoke and staying with me a while?\r\nPerhaps after a little we\xe2\x80\x99ll walk about--shan\xe2\x80\x99t we? But face to face\r\nwith this dear old house, in this jolly old nook, one\xe2\x80\x99s too contented\r\nto move, lest raising a finger even should break the spell. What WILL be\r\nperfect will be your just sitting down--DO sit down--and scolding me a\r\nlittle. That, my dear Nanda, will deepen the peace.\xe2\x80\x9d Some minutes later,\r\nwhile, near him but in another chair, she fingered the impossible book,\r\nas she pronounced it, that she had taken from him, he came back to what\r\nshe had last said. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he talked to you much about his \xe2\x80\x98liking\xe2\x80\x99 me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda waited a minute, turning over the book. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how are you just now so struck with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not struck only with what I\xe2\x80\x99m talked to about. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9conly what people tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh no--you\xe2\x80\x99re too much your mother\xe2\x80\x99s daughter for that!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nleaned back and smoked, and though all his air seemed to say that when\r\none was so at ease for gossip almost any subject would do, he kept\r\njogging his foot with the same small nervous motion as during the\r\nhalf-hour at Mertle that this record has commemorated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too\r\nmuch one of us all,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve tremendous perceptions,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I SHOULD have come for him. But after all,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, as if all sorts of nonsense would equally serve, \xe2\x80\x9che mightn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nexcept for you, you know, have asked me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda so far accepted this view as to reply: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awfully weak. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso modest that he might have been afraid of your boring yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you do,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthe explanation\xe2\x80\x99s a little\r\nconceited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I only made it,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank said, \xe2\x80\x9cin reference to his modesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Beyond the lawn the house was before him, old, square, red-roofed, well\r\nassured of its right to the place it took up in the world. This was a\r\nconsiderable space--in the little world at least of Suffolk--and the\r\nlook of possession had everywhere mixed with it, in the form of old\r\nwindows and doors, the tone of old red surfaces, the style of old white\r\nfacings, the age of old high creepers, the long confirmation of time.\r\nSuggestive of panelled rooms, of precious mahogany, of portraits\r\nof women dead, of coloured china glimmering through glass doors and\r\ndelicate silver reflected on bared tables, the thing was one of those\r\nimpressions of a particular period that it takes two centuries to\r\nproduce. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man incoherently exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9chis caring to\r\nleave anything so loveable as all this to come up and live with US!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl also for a little lost herself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\r\nis--the charm comes out so as one stays. Little by little it grows and\r\ngrows. There are old things everywhere that are too delightful. He\r\nlets me explore so--he lets me rummage and rifle. Every day I make\r\ndiscoveries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank wondered as he smoked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean he lets you take things--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--up to my room, to study or to copy. There are old patterns that\r\nare too dear for anything. It\xe2\x80\x99s when you live with them, you see, that\r\nyou know. Everything in the place is such good company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother ought to be here,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank presently suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso fond of good company.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as Nanda answered nothing he went on:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas your grandmother ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl promptly said. \xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated in a tone quite\r\ndifferent. After which she added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the only one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, and I \xe2\x80\x98me and you,\xe2\x80\x99 as they say,\xe2\x80\x9d her companion amended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and Mr. Mitchy, who\xe2\x80\x99s to come down--please don\xe2\x80\x99t forget--this\r\nafternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank had another of his contemplative pauses. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for\r\nreminding me. I shall spread myself as much as possible before he\r\ncomes--try to produce so much of my effect that I shall be safe. But\r\nwhat did Mr. Longdon ask him for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat did he ask YOU for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, for the reason you just now mentioned--that his interest in me is\r\nso uncontrollable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen isn\xe2\x80\x99t his interest in Mitchy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the same general order?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He seemed to look for a way to express the distinction--which suddenly\r\noccurred to him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in love with Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d--Nanda turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s mother, it appears, was awful. Mr.\r\nCashmore knew her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s smoke-puffs were profuse and his pauses frequent. \xe2\x80\x9cAwful\r\nto Mr. Cashmore? I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear it--he must have deserved it. But I\r\nbelieve in her all the same. Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s often awful himself,\xe2\x80\x9d the young\r\nman rambled on. \xe2\x80\x9cJust so I believe in HIM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda--\xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s why I asked him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYOU asked him, my dear child? Have you the inviting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes he turned on her seemed really to try if she jested or were\r\nserious. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you arranged for me too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned over again a few leaves of his book and, closing it with\r\nsomething of a clap, transferred it to the bench beside him--a movement\r\nin which, as if through a drop into thought, he rendered her no\r\nassistance. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean is that I proposed it to Mr. Longdon, I\r\nsuggested he should be asked. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a reason for seeing him--I want\r\nto talk to him. And do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat Mr. Longdon\r\nsaid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething splendid of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps dislike his being here with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, throwing back his head, laughed, smoked, jogged his foot\r\nmore than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cAwfully nice. Dear old Mitch! How little afraid of him\r\nyou are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cOf Mitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of the tremendous pull he really has. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well to\r\ntalk--he HAS it. But of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x9d--and as\r\nwith the effect of his nervous sociability he shifted his position. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nperfectly see that you\xe2\x80\x99re NOT afraid. I perfectly know what you have in\r\nyour head. I should never in the least dream of accusing you--as far as\r\nHE is concerned--of the least disposition to flirt; any more indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank pleasantly pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthan even of any general tendency of\r\nthat sort. No, my dear Nanda\xe2\x80\x9d--he kindly kept it up--\xe2\x80\x9cI WILL say for\r\nyou that, though a girl, thank heaven, and awfully MUCH a girl, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nreally not on the whole more of a flirt than a respectable social ideal\r\nprescribes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you most tremendously,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion quietly replied.\r\n\r\nSomething in the tone of it made him laugh out, and the particular sound\r\nwent well with all the rest, with the August day and the charming spot\r\nand the young man\xe2\x80\x99s lounging figure and Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s own little hovering\r\nhospitality. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I strike you as patronising you with unconscious\r\nsublimity. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right, for what\xe2\x80\x99s the most natural thing to\r\ndo in these conditions but the most luxurious? Won\xe2\x80\x99t Mitchy be wonderful\r\nfor feeling and enjoying them? I assure you I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted he\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then in a different tone a moment later, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you expect to be here\r\nlong?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nIt took Nanda some time to say. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as Mr. Longdon will keep me, I\r\nsuppose--if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound very horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you! Only won\xe2\x80\x99t he himself,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbe\r\ncoming up to town in the course of the autumn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in that case I\xe2\x80\x99d perfectly stay here without him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd leave him in London without YOU? Ah that\xe2\x80\x99s not what we want:\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at all the same thing without you. Least of all for\r\nhimself!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank declared.\r\n\r\nNanda again thought. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes him funny, I suppose--his\r\ncurious infatuation. I set him off--what do you call it?--show him\r\noff: by his going round and round me as the acrobat on the horse in\r\nthe circus goes round the clown. He has said a great deal to me of your\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x9d she irrelevantly added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOk everything that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of course, or you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see--most charming of him.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank kept his high head\r\nthrown back as for the view, with a bright equal general interest, of\r\neverything that was before them, whether talked of or seen. \xe2\x80\x9cWho do you\r\nthink I yesterday had a letter from? An extraordinary funny one from\r\nHarold. He gave me all the family news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what IS the family news?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl after a minute enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the first great item is that he himself--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanted,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cto borrow five pounds of you? I say that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she added, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause if he wrote to you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been in such a case for the simple pleasure of the\r\nintercourse?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank hesitated, but continued not to look at her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know, pray, of poor Harold\xe2\x80\x99s borrowings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know as I know other things. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I know everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDO you? I should rather ask,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man gaily enough replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I not? How should I not? You know what I know.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as to\r\nexplain herself and attenuate a little the sudden emphasis with which\r\nshe had spoken: \xe2\x80\x9cI remember your once telling me that I must take in\r\nthings at my pores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion stared, but with his laugh again changed his posture.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you\xe2\x80\x99 must--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I do--and you were quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when did I make this extraordinary charge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cyou admit it IS a charge. It was a long time\r\nago--when I was a little girl. Which made it worse!\xe2\x80\x9d she dropped.\r\n\r\nIt made it at all events now for Vanderbank more amusing. \xe2\x80\x9cAh not\r\nworse--better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause in that case I mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have understood?\r\nBut that I do understand is just what you\xe2\x80\x99ve always meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Always,\xe2\x80\x99 my dear Nanda? I feel somehow,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined very kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nif you overwhelmed me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou \xe2\x80\x98feel\xe2\x80\x99 as if I did--but the reality is just that I don\xe2\x80\x99t. The day\r\nI overwhelm you, Mr. Van--!\xe2\x80\x9d She let that pass, however; there was too\r\nmuch to say about it and there was something else much simpler. \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\r\nunderstand now. It has got to be faced, as Tishy says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t require Tishy to point that out\r\nto us. What are we all doing most of the time but trying to face it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoing? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you doing rather something very different? You\xe2\x80\x99re just\r\ntrying to dodge it. You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make believe--not perhaps to\r\nyourselves but to US--that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you don\xe2\x80\x99t want us to be any worse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with brisk gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t care really what you\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis amusement now dropped to her straighter. \xe2\x80\x9cYour \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99 is awfully\r\nbeautiful. It\xe2\x80\x99s charming to hear you speak for the whole lovely lot.\r\nOnly you speak, you know, as if you were just the class apart that you\r\nyet complain of our--by our scruples--implying you to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe considered this objection with her eyes on his face. \xe2\x80\x9cWell then we\r\ndo care. Only--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly it\xe2\x80\x99s a big subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--no doubt; it\xe2\x80\x99s a big subject.\xe2\x80\x9d She appeared to wish to meet him\r\non everything reasonable. \xe2\x80\x9cEven Mr. Longdon admits that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you talk over with him--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe subject of girls? Why we scarcely discuss anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no wonder then you\xe2\x80\x99re not bored. But you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\r\nrecognises the inevitable change--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t shut his eyes to the facts. He sees we\xe2\x80\x99re quite a different\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say\xe2\x80\x9d--her friend was fully appreciative. \xe2\x80\x9cYet the old\r\nthing--what do YOU know of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI personally? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some change even in MY short life. And\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t the old books full of us? Then Mr. Longdon himself has told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank smoked and smoked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve gone into it with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as a man and a woman can together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he took her in at this with a turn of his eye he might have had in\r\nhis ears the echo of all the times it had been dropped in Buckingham\r\nCrescent that Nanda was \xe2\x80\x9cwonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d She WAS indeed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99s of course\r\non certain sides shy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully--too beautifully. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s Aggie,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmean for the real old thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, no doubt--if she BE the real old thing. But what the deuce really\r\nIS Aggie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda with the frankest interest, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a miracle. If\r\none could be her exactly, absolutely, without the least little mite of\r\nchange, one would probably be wise to close with it. Otherwise--except\r\nfor anything BUT that--I\xe2\x80\x99d rather brazen it out as myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere fell between them on this a silence of some minutes, after which\r\nit would probably not have been possible for either to say if their eyes\r\nhad met while it lasted. This was at any rate not the case as Vanderbank\r\nat last remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cYour brass, my dear young lady, is pure gold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s of me, I think, that Harold ought to borrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean therefore that mine isn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you really haven\xe2\x80\x99t any natural \xe2\x80\x98cheek\xe2\x80\x99--not like SOME of them.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re in yourself as uneasy, if anything\xe2\x80\x99s said and every one giggles\r\nor makes some face, as Mr. Longdon, and if Lord Petherton hadn\xe2\x80\x99t once\r\ntold me that a man hates almost as much to be called modest as a woman\r\ndoes, I\xe2\x80\x99d say that very often in London now you must pass some bad\r\nmoments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe present might precisely have been one of them, we should doubtless\r\nhave gathered, had we seen fully recorded in Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s face the\r\ndegree to which this prompt response embarrassed or at least stupefied\r\nhim. But he could always provisionally laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI like your \xe2\x80\x98in London\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the tone and the current and the effect of all the others that\r\npush you along,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on as if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf such things\r\nare contagious, as every one says, you prove it perhaps as much as any\r\none. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t begin\xe2\x80\x9d--she continued blandly enough to work it out\r\nfor him; \xe2\x80\x9cor you can\xe2\x80\x99t at least originally have begun. Any one would\r\nknow that now--from the terrific effect I see I produce on you--by\r\ntalking this way. There it is--it\xe2\x80\x99s all out before one knows it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it any more than you can, can I?\xe2\x80\x9d So she appeared\r\nto put it to him, with something in her lucidity that would have been\r\ninfinitely touching; a strange grave calm consciousness of their common\r\ndoom and of what in especial in it would be worst for herself. He sprang\r\nup indeed after an instant as if he had been infinitely touched; he\r\nturned away, taking just near her a few steps to and fro, gazed about\r\nthe place again, but this time without the air of particularly seeing\r\nit, and then came back to her as if from a greater distance. An observer\r\nat all initiated would, at the juncture, fairly have hung on his\r\nlips, and there was in fact on Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s part quite the look of the\r\nman--though it lasted but just while we seize it--in suspense about\r\nhimself. The most initiated observer of all would have been poor Mr.\r\nLongdon, in that case destined, however, to be also the most defeated,\r\nwith the sign of his tension a smothered \xe2\x80\x9cAh if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do it NOW!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Well, Vanderbank didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it \xe2\x80\x9cnow,\xe2\x80\x9d and the odd slow irrelevant sigh he\r\ngave out might have sufficed as the record of his recovery from a peril\r\nlasting just long enough to be measured. Had there been any measure of\r\nit meanwhile for Nanda? There was nothing at least to show either the\r\npresence or the relief of anxiety in the way in which, by a prompt\r\ntransition, she left her last appeal to him simply to take care of\r\nitself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t denied that Harold does borrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a sound as of cheer for this luckily firmer ground. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nchild, I never lent the silly boy five pounds in my life. In fact I like\r\nthe way you talk of that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know quite for what you take me, but\r\nthe number of persons to whom I HAVE lent five pounds--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs so awfully small\xe2\x80\x9d--she took him up on it--\xe2\x80\x9cas not to look so very\r\nwell for you?\xe2\x80\x9d She held him an instant as with the fine intelligence\r\nof his meaning in this, and then, though not with sharpness, broke out:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you trying to make out that you\xe2\x80\x99re nasty and stingy? Why do you\r\nmisrepresent--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy natural generosity? I don\xe2\x80\x99t misrepresent anything, but I take, I\r\nthink, rather markedly good care of money.\xe2\x80\x9d She had remained in her\r\nplace and he was before her on the grass, his hands in his pockets and\r\nhis manner perhaps a little awkward. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way you young things talk of\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarold talks of it--but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think _I_ do. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit\r\nexpensive--ask mother, or even ask father. I do with awfully little--for\r\nclothes and things, and I could easily do with still less. Harold\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nborn consumer, as Mitchy says; he says also he\xe2\x80\x99s one of those people who\r\nwill never really want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh for that, Mitchy himself will never let him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, with every one helping us all round, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we a lovely\r\nfamily? I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it to tell tales, but when you mention hearing\r\nfrom Harold all sorts of things immediately come over me. We seem to be\r\nall living more or less on other people, all immensely \xe2\x80\x98beholden.\xe2\x80\x99 You\r\ncan easily say of course that I\xe2\x80\x99m worst of all. The children and their\r\npeople, at Bognor, are in borrowed quarters--mother got them lent\r\nher--as to which, no doubt, I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly aware that I ought to be there\r\nsharing them, taking care of my little brother and sister, instead\r\nof sitting here at Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s expense to expose everything and\r\ncriticise. Father and mother, in Scotland, are on a grand campaign.\r\nWell\xe2\x80\x9d--she pulled herself up--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not in THAT at any rate. Say you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlent Harold only five shillings,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\r\nVanderbank stood smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, say I have. I never lend any one\r\nwhatever more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt only adds to my conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he writes to Mr.\r\nLongdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if Mr. Longdon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say so--?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that proves nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d She got up as she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cHarold also works\r\nGranny.\xe2\x80\x9d He only laughed out at first for this, while she went on:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll think I make myself out fearfully deep--I mean in the way of\r\nknowing everything without having to be told. That IS, as you say,\r\nmamma\xe2\x80\x99s great accomplishment, so it must be hereditary. Besides, there\r\nseem to me only too many things one IS told. Only Mr. Longdon has in\r\nfact said nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had looked about responsibly--not to leave in disorder the\r\ngarden-nook they had occupied; picking up a newspaper and changing\r\nthe place of a cushion. \xe2\x80\x9cI do think that with him you\xe2\x80\x99re remarkable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank observed--\xe2\x80\x9cputting on one side all you seem to know and on\r\nthe other all he holds his tongue about. What then DOES he say?\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nyoung man asked after a slight pause and perhaps even with a slight\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nNanda glanced round again--she was folding, rather carefully, her paper.\r\nPresently her glance met their friend, who, having come out of one of\r\nthe long windows that opened to the lawn, had stopped there to watch\r\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says just now that luncheon\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in the drawing-room to Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cmake Mr. Van\r\ngo with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, in the rain, which had come on since the morning, had\r\nbetaken himself to church, and his other guest, with sufficiently marked\r\ngood humour, had borne him company. The windows of the drawing-room\r\nlooked at the wet garden, all vivid and rich in the summer shower, and\r\nMitchy, after seeing Vanderbank turn up his trousers and fling back\r\na last answer to the not quite sincere chaff his submission had\r\nengendered, adopted freely and familiarly the prospect not only of a\r\ngrateful freshened lawn, but of a good hour in the very pick, as he\r\ncalled it, of his actual happy conditions. The favouring rain, the dear\r\nold place, the charming serious house, the large inimitable room, the\r\nabsence of the others, the present vision of what his young friend had\r\ngiven him to count on--the sense of these delights was expressed in his\r\nfixed generous glare. He was at first too pleased even to sit down; he\r\nmeasured the great space from end to end, admiring again everything he\r\nhad admired before and protesting afresh that no modern ingenuity--not\r\neven his own, to which he did justice--could create effects of such\r\npurity. The final touch in the picture before them was just the\r\ncomposer\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance. Mr. Longdon had not made his house, he had simply\r\nlived it, and the \xe2\x80\x9ctaste\xe2\x80\x9d of the place--Mitchy in certain connexions\r\nabominated the word--was just nothing more than the beauty of his life.\r\nEverything on every side had dropped straight from heaven, with nowhere\r\na bargaining thumb-mark, a single sign of the shop. All this would have\r\nbeen a wonderful theme for discourse in Buckingham Crescent--so happy an\r\nexercise for the votaries of that temple of analysis that he repeatedly\r\nspoke of their experience of it as crying aloud for Mrs. Brook. The\r\nquestions it set in motion for the perceptive mind were exactly those\r\nthat, as he said, most made them feel themselves. Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s plea for\r\nhis morning had been a pile of letters to work off, and Mitchy--then\r\ncoming down, as he announced from the first, ready for anything--had\r\ngone to church with Mr. Longdon and Nanda in the finest spirit of\r\ncuriosity. He now--after the girl\xe2\x80\x99s remark--turned away from his view\r\nof the rain, which he found different somehow from other rain, as\r\neverything else was different, and replied that he knew well enough what\r\nshe could make Mr. Longdon do, but only wondered at Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s secret\r\nfor acting on their friend. He was there before her with his hands in\r\nhis pockets and appreciation winking from every yellow spot in his red\r\nnecktie. \xe2\x80\x9cAfternoon service of a wet Sunday in a small country town is a\r\nlarge order. Does Van do everything the governor wants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may perhaps have had a suspicion of what I want,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda explained.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I want particularly to talk to you--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has got out of the way to give me a chance? Well then he\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nusual simply magnificent. How can I express the bliss of finding myself\r\nenclosed with you in this sweet old security, this really unimagined\r\nsanctity? Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s more charming than suddenly to come across something\r\nsharp and fresh after we\xe2\x80\x99ve thought there was nothing more that could\r\ndraw from us a groan. We\xe2\x80\x99ve supposed we\xe2\x80\x99ve had it all, have squeezed the\r\nlast impression out of the last disappointment, penetrated to the last\r\nfamiliarity in the last surprise; then some fine day we find that we\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t done justice to life. There are little things that pop up and\r\nmake us feel again. What MAY happen is after all incalculable. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust a little chuck of the dice, and for three minutes we win. These,\r\nmy dear young lady, are my three minutes. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the\r\namusement I get from them, and how can I possibly tell you? There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfaint divine old fragrance here in the room--or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it perhaps reach\r\nyou? I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have lived without it, but I see now I had been afraid\r\nI should. You, on your side, won\xe2\x80\x99t have lived without some touch of\r\ngreatness. This moment\xe2\x80\x99s great and you\xe2\x80\x99ve produced it. You were great\r\nwhen you felt all you COULD produce. Therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy went on, pausing\r\nonce more, as he walked, before a picture, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t pull the whole thing\r\ndown by the vulgarity of wishing I too only had a first-rate Cotman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you given up some VERY big thing to come?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda replied to this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world is very big, my child, but the beauty of this hour?\r\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea WHAT, when I got Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s note, I gave\r\nup. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me for an account of anything; everything went--became\r\nimperceptible. I WILL say that for myself: I shed my badness, I do\r\nforget people, with a facility that makes me, for bits, for little\r\npatches, so far as they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned, cease to BE; so that my life is\r\nspotted all over with momentary states in which I\xe2\x80\x99m as the dead of whom\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x99s said but good.\xe2\x80\x9d He had strolled toward her again while she\r\nsmiled at him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve died for this, Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only difficulty I see,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently replied, \xe2\x80\x9cis that you ought\r\nto marry a woman really clever and that I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure what there\r\nmay be of that in Aggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Aggie?\xe2\x80\x9d her friend echoed very gently. \xe2\x80\x9cIs THAT what you\xe2\x80\x99ve sent for\r\nme for--to talk about Aggie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t it occur to you it might be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly, you mean, be anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked about\r\nfor the place in which it would express the deepest surrender to the\r\nscene to sit--then sank down with a beautiful prompt submission. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nno idea of what occurred to me--nothing at least but the sense that I\r\nhad occurred to YOU. The occurrence is clay in the hands of the potter.\r\nDo with me what you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appreciate everything so wonderfully,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be hard for you to appreciate HER. I do dream so you may\r\nsave her. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I haven\xe2\x80\x99t waited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing that remains to me in life,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cis a certain\r\naccessibility to the thought of what I may still do to figure a little\r\nin your eye; but that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely a thought you may assist to become\r\nclearer. You may for instance give me some pledge or sign that if I do\r\nfigure--prance and caracole and sufficiently kick up the dust--your\r\neye won\xe2\x80\x99t suffer itself to be distracted from me. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nadventure I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready to undertake for you; yet my passion--chastened,\r\nthrough all this, purified, austere--is still enough of this world not\r\nwholly to have renounced the fancy of some small reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow small?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl asked.\r\n\r\nShe spoke as if feeling she must take from him in common kindness\r\nat least as much as she would make him take, and the serious anxious\r\npatience such a consciousness gave her tone was met by Mitchy with\r\na charmed reasonableness that his habit of hyperbole did nothing to\r\nmisrepresent. He glowed at her with the fullest recognition that there\r\nwas something he was there to discuss with her, but with the assurance\r\nin every soft sound of him that no height to which she might lift the\r\ndiscussion would be too great for him to reach. His every cadence\r\nand every motion was an implication, as from one to the other, of the\r\nexquisite. Oh he could sustain it! \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean the establishment of\r\nsomething between us. I mean your arranging somehow that we shall be\r\ndrawn more together--know together something nobody else knows. I should\r\nlike so terrifically to have a RELATION that is a secret, with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if that\xe2\x80\x99s all you want you can be easily gratified. Rien de plus\r\nfacile, as mamma says. I\xe2\x80\x99m full of secrets--I think I\xe2\x80\x99m really most\r\nsecretive. I\xe2\x80\x99ll share almost any one of them with you--if it\xe2\x80\x99s only a\r\ngood one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy debated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you\xe2\x80\x99ll choose it yourself? You won\xe2\x80\x99t let it be\r\none of mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion jumped up again and for a moment pervaded the place. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nyou say such things as that, you\xe2\x80\x99re of a beauty--! MAY it,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked as\r\nhe stopped before her, \xe2\x80\x9cbe one of mine--a perfectly awful one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed her clearest interest. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I suppose the most awful secrets\r\nare the best--yes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hideously tempted.\xe2\x80\x9d But he hung fire; then dropping into his chair\r\nagain: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be too bad. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why won\xe2\x80\x99t THIS do, just as it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98This\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked over the big bland room. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy what you\xe2\x80\x99re here for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child I\xe2\x80\x99m here--most of all--to love you more than ever; and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s an absence of favouring mystery about THAT--!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at\r\nhim as if seeing what he meant and only asking to remedy it. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncertain amount of mystery we can now MAKE--that it strikes me in fact we\r\nMUST make. Dear Mitchy,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued almost with eagerness, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink we CAN really tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had fallen back in his chair, not looking at her now, and with his\r\nhands, from his supported elbows, clasped to keep himself more quiet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you still talking about Aggie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I\xe2\x80\x99ve scarcely begun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d It was not irritation he appeared to express, but the slight\r\nstrain of an effort to get into relation with the subject. Better to\r\nfocus the image he closed his eyes a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak of something that may draw us together, and I simply reply\r\nthat if you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel how near together we are--in this I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimagine you ever would. You must have wonderful notions,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cof the ideal state of union. I pack every one off for you--I\r\nbanish everything that can interfere, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least mind your\r\nknowing that I find the consequence delightful. YOU may talk, if you\r\nlike, of what will have passed between us, but I shall never mention\r\nit to a soul; literally not to a living creature. What do you want more\r\nthan that?\xe2\x80\x9d He opened his eyes in deference to the question, but replied\r\nonly with a gaze as unassisted as if it had come through a hole in\r\na curtain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for an adventure, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just an\r\nadventure that I propose. If I can make you feel for yourself as I feel\r\nfor you the beauty of your chance to go in and save her--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you can--?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy at last broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think, you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find it easy to make your two\r\nends meet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought a little longer. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the ends is yours, so that you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nact WITH me. If I wind you up so that you go--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll just happily sit and watch me spin? Thank you! THAT will be my\r\nreward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda rose on this from her chair as with the impulse of protest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShan\xe2\x80\x99t you care for my gratitude, my admiration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy seemed to muse. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall care for THEM. Yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquite see, you know, what you OWE to Aggie. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if--!\xe2\x80\x9d But with\r\nthis he faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if she cared particularly for ME? Ah that has nothing to do with\r\nit; that\xe2\x80\x99s a thing without which surely it\xe2\x80\x99s but too possible to be\r\nexquisite. There are beautiful, quite beautiful people who don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nfor me. The thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important to one is the thing one sees one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself, and it\xe2\x80\x99s quite enough if _I_ see what can be made of that child.\r\nMarry her, Mitchy, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see who she\xe2\x80\x99ll care for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy kept his position; he was for the moment--his image of shortly\r\nbefore reversed--the one who appeared to sit happily and watch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo awfully pleasant your asking of me anything whatever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, as I say, beautifully, grandly save her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you say, yes\xe2\x80\x9d--he sympathetically inclined his head. \xe2\x80\x9cBut without\r\nmaking me feel exactly what you mean by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep her,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda returned, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom becoming like the Duchess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit like the Duchess in any of her elements. She\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ntotally different thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was only for an instant, however, that this objection seemed to\r\ntell. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why she\xe2\x80\x99ll be so perfect for you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get her\r\naway--take her out of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy met it all now in a sort of spellbound stillness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nknow about her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know everything!\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with her first faint shade of\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nIt produced for a little a hush between them, at the end of which her\r\ncompanion said with extraordinary gentleness and tenderness: \xe2\x80\x9cDear\r\nold Nanda!\xe2\x80\x9d Her own silence appeared consciously to continue, and the\r\nsuggestion of it might have been that for intelligent ears there was\r\nnothing to add to the declaration she had just made and which Mitchy\r\nsat there taking in as with a new light. What he drew from it indeed\r\nhe presently went on to show. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too awfully interesting. Of\r\ncourse--you know a lot. How shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you--and why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why\xe2\x80\x99? Oh that\xe2\x80\x99s another affair! But you don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what I know; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure it\xe2\x80\x99s much more than you\xe2\x80\x99ve a notion of. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing\r\nnow one IS--just except the little marvel of Aggie. What on earth,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ngirl pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you take us for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d breathed Mitchy, divinely pacific.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it is; I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if it were in\r\nfact all wrong. But what at least is certainly right is for one not to\r\npretend anything else. There I am for you at any rate. Now the beauty of\r\nAggie is that she knows nothing--but absolutely, utterly: not the least\r\nlittle tittle of anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was barely visible that Mitchy hesitated, and he spoke quite gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you tried her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. And Tishy has.\xe2\x80\x9d His gravity had been less than Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d The memory of some scene or some passage might have\r\ncome back to her with a charm. \xe2\x80\x9cAh say what you will--it IS the way we\r\nought to be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, after a minute of much intensity, had stopped watching her;\r\nchanging his posture and with his elbows on his knees he dropped for\r\na while his face into his hands. Then he jerked himself to his feet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something I wish awfully I could say to you. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda, after a slow headshake, covered him with one of the dimmest of\r\nher smiles. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t say it. I know perfectly which it is.\xe2\x80\x9d She held\r\nhim an instant, after which she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s simply that you wish me\r\nfully to understand that you\xe2\x80\x99re one who, in perfect sincerity, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind one straw how awful--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, how awful?\xe2\x80\x9d He had kindled, as he paused, with his new eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, one\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge may be. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shock in you a single\r\nhereditary prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x98hereditary\xe2\x80\x99--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy ecstatically murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou even rather like me the better for it; so that one of the reasons\r\nwhy you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told me--though not of course, I know, the only\r\none--is that you would have been literally almost ashamed. Because, you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cit IS strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lack of hereditary--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, discomfort in presence of the fact I speak of. There\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of\r\nsense you don\xe2\x80\x99t possess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis appreciation again fairly goggled at her. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you do know\r\neverything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so good that nothing shocks you,\xe2\x80\x9d she lucidly persisted.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of delicacy you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was more and more struck. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only that--as it were--of the skin\r\nand the fingers?\xe2\x80\x9d he appealed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh and that of the mind. And that of the soul. And some other kinds\r\ncertainly. But not THE kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d--he wondered--\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way one can name it.\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nappeared to rise there before him. \xe2\x80\x9cTHE kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe kind that would make me painful to you. Or rather not me perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she added as if to create between them the fullest possible light; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nmy situation, my exposure--all the results of them I show. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t one\r\nbecome a sort of a little drain-pipe with everything flowing through?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you call it more gracefully,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy asked, freshly struck,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca little aeolian-harp set in the drawing-room window and vibrating in\r\nthe breeze of conversation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh because the harp gives out a sound, and WE--at least we try to--give\r\nout none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you take, you mean, you keep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it sticks to us. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met long on it. \xe2\x80\x9cYes--I see. I DON\xe2\x80\x99T mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ve the most\r\nextraordinary lacunae.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about others,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed them.\r\nBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve that one, and it\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to face her with his queer mixture of assent and\r\nspeculation. \xe2\x80\x9cEnough for what, my dear? To have made me impossible for\r\nyou because the only man you could, as they say, have \xe2\x80\x98respected\xe2\x80\x99 would\r\nbe a man who WOULD have minded?\xe2\x80\x9d Then as under the cool soft pressure of\r\nthe question she looked at last away from him: \xe2\x80\x9cThe man with \xe2\x80\x98THE kind,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas you call it, happens to be just the type you CAN love? But what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nuse,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted as she answered nothing, \xe2\x80\x9cin loving a person with the\r\nprejudice--hereditary or other--to which you\xe2\x80\x99re precisely obnoxious? Do\r\nyou positively LIKE to love in vain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a question, the way she turned back to him seemed to say, that\r\ndeserved a responsible answer. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had moved off after speaking, and Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed her to\r\ndifferent parts of the room as, with small pretexts of present attention\r\nto it, small bestowed touches for symmetry, she slowly measured it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary then is your idea of my finding any charm in\r\nAggie\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe immediately put down an old snuff-box. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy--it\xe2\x80\x99s the one sort of\r\nthing you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she returned to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cthe effect it will produce on you. You must get really near it and\r\nsee it all come out to feel all its beauty. You\xe2\x80\x99ll like it, Mitchy\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nNanda\xe2\x80\x99s gravity was wonderful--\xe2\x80\x9cbetter than anything you HAVE known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clear sincerity of this, even had there been nothing else, imposed\r\na consideration that Mitchy now flagrantly could give, and the deference\r\nof his suggestion of difficulty only grew more deep. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m to do then,\r\nwith this happy condition of hers, what you say YOU\xe2\x80\x99VE done--to \xe2\x80\x98try\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d And then as her assent, so directly challenged, failed an instant:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t my approach to it, however cautious, be just what will break\r\nit up and spoil it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy so--if mine wasn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99re not me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m just as bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy rang out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing as good.\xe2\x80\x9d She had on this, in a\r\ndifferent key, her own sudden explosion. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Mitchy\r\ndear--for the very heart of it all--how good I BELIEVE you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had spoken as with a flare of impatience at some justice he failed\r\nto do her, and this brought him after a startled instant close enough\r\nto her to take up her hand. She let him have it, and in mute solemn\r\nreassurance he raised it to his lips, saying to her thus more things\r\nthan he could say in any other way; which yet just after, when he had\r\nreleased it and a motionless pause had ensued, didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent his adding\r\nthree words. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Nanda, Nanda!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone of them made her again extraordinarily gentle. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98try\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanything then. Take everything for granted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had turned away from her and walked mechanically, with his air of\r\nblind emotion, to the window, where for a minute he looked out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has\r\nstopped raining,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s going to brighten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe place had three windows, and Nanda went to the next. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite\r\nyet--but I think it will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy soon faced back into the room, where after a brief hesitation he\r\nmoved, as quietly, almost as cautiously, as if on tiptoe, to the seat\r\noccupied by his companion at the beginning of their talk. Here he sank\r\ndown watching the girl, who stood a while longer with her eyes on the\r\ngarden. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want me, you say, to take her out of the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife; but where am I myself, if we come to that, but even more IN the\r\nDuchess\xe2\x80\x99s life than Aggie is? I\xe2\x80\x99m in it by my contacts, my associations,\r\nmy indifferences--all my acceptances, knowledges, amusements. I\xe2\x80\x99m in it\r\nby my cynicisms--those that circumstances somehow from the first, when\r\nI began for myself to look at life and the world, committed me to and\r\nsteeped me in; I\xe2\x80\x99m in it by a kind of desperation that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nfelt perhaps if you had got hold of me sooner with just this touch with\r\nwhich you\xe2\x80\x99ve got hold of me to-day; and I\xe2\x80\x99m in it more than all--you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nyourself admit--by the very fact that her aunt desires, as you know,\r\nmuch more even than you do, to bring the thing about. Then we SHOULD\r\nbe--the Duchess and I--shoulder to shoulder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda heard him motionless to the end, taking also another minute to\r\nturn over what he had said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you like so in Lord Petherton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she asked as she came to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, if you only could tell me! It would be, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?--it\r\nmust have been--the subject of some fairy-tale, if fairy-tales were made\r\nnow, or better still of some Christmas pantomime: \xe2\x80\x98The Gnome and the\r\nGiant.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda appeared to try--not with much success--to see it. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you find\r\nLord Petherton a Gnome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy at first, for all reward, only glared at her. \xe2\x80\x9cCharming,\r\nNanda--charming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man\xe2\x80\x99s giant enough for Lord Petherton,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen his\r\nfortune\xe2\x80\x99s gigantic. He preys upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hands in his pockets and his legs much apart, Mitchy sat there as in\r\na posture adapted to her simplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re adorable. YOU don\xe2\x80\x99t. But it\r\nIS rather horrid, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he presently went on.\r\n\r\nHer momentary silence would have been by itself enough of an answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing--of all you speak of,\xe2\x80\x9d she nevertheless returned, \xe2\x80\x9cwill matter\r\nthen. She\xe2\x80\x99ll so simplify your life.\xe2\x80\x9d He remained just as he was, only\r\nwith his eyes on her; and meanwhile she had turned again to her window,\r\nthrough which a faint sun-streak began to glimmer and play. At sight of\r\nit she opened the casement to let in the warm freshness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rain HAS\r\nstopped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you want me to save her. But what you really mean,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy\r\nresumed from the sofa, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t at all exactly that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda, without heeding the remark, took in the sunshine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be\r\ncharming now in the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friend got up, found his wonderful crossbarred cap, after a glance,\r\non a neighbouring chair, and with it came toward her. \xe2\x80\x9cYour hope is\r\nthat--as I\xe2\x80\x99m good enough to be worth it--she\xe2\x80\x99ll save ME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda looked at him now. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will, Mitchy--she WILL!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood a moment in the recovered brightness; after which he\r\nmechanically--as with the pressure of quite another consciousness--put\r\non his cap. \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, shall that hope between us be the thing--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing?\xe2\x80\x9d--she just wondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that will have drawn us together--to hold us so, you know--this\r\nafternoon. I mean the secret we spoke of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put out to him on this the hand he had taken a few minutes before,\r\nand he clasped it now only with the firmness it seemed to give and to\r\nask for. \xe2\x80\x9cOh it will do for that!\xe2\x80\x9d she said as they went out together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt had been understood that he was to take his leave on the morrow,\r\nthough Vanderbank was to stay another day. Mr. Longdon had for the\r\nSunday dinner invited three or four of his neighbours to \xe2\x80\x9cmeet\xe2\x80\x9d the two\r\ngentlemen from town, so that it was not till the company had departed,\r\nor in other words till near bedtime, that our four friends could again\r\nhave become aware, as between themselves, of that directness of mutual\r\nrelation which forms the subject of our picture. It had not, however,\r\nprevented Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s slipping upstairs as soon as the doctor and his wife\r\nhad gone, and the manner indeed in which, on the stroke of eleven, Mr.\r\nLongdon conformed to his tradition of appropriating a particular candle\r\nwas as positive an expression of it as any other. Nothing in him\r\nwas more amiable than the terms maintained between the rigour of his\r\npersonal habits and his free imagination of the habits of others. He\r\ndeprecated as regards the former, it might have been seen, most signs of\r\nlikeness, and no one had ever dared to learn how he would have handled\r\na show of imitation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way to flatter him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy threw off five\r\nminutes later, \xe2\x80\x9cis not to make him think you resemble or agree with him,\r\nbut to let him see how different you perceive he can bear to think you.\r\nI mean of course without hating you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what interest have YOU,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank asked, \xe2\x80\x9cin the way to flatter\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, more interest than you. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been here all day\r\nwithout arriving at conclusions on the credit he has opened to you--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean the amount he\xe2\x80\x99ll settle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have it in your power,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cto make it anything you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is he then--so bloated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy was on his feet in the apartment in which their host had left\r\nthem, and he had at first for this question but an expressive motion of\r\nthe shoulders in respect to everything in the room. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, judge, guess,\r\nfeel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was as if Vanderbank, before the fire, consciously controlled his\r\nown attention. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a hang!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis passage took place in the library and as a consequence of their\r\nhaving confessed, as their friend faced them with his bedroom light,\r\nthat a brief discreet vigil and a box of cigars would fix better than\r\nanything else the fine impression of the day. Mitchy might at that\r\nmoment, on the evidence of the eyes Mr. Longdon turned to them and of\r\nwhich his innocent candle-flame betrayed the secret, have found matter\r\nfor a measure of the almost extreme allowances he wanted them to want of\r\nhim. They had only to see that the greater window was fast and to turn\r\nout the library lamp. It might really have amused them to stand a moment\r\nat the open door that, apart from this, was to testify to his conception\r\nof those who were not, in the smaller hours, as HE was. He had in fact\r\nby his retreat--and but too sensibly--left them there with a deal of\r\nmidnight company. If one of these presences was the mystery he had\r\nhimself mixed the manner of our young men showed a due expectation of\r\nthe others. Mitchy, on hearing how little Vanderbank \xe2\x80\x9ccared,\xe2\x80\x9d only kept\r\nup a while longer that observant revolution in which he had spent much\r\nof his day, to which any fresh sense of any exhibition always promptly\r\ncommitted him, and which, had it not been controlled by infinite tact,\r\nmight have affected the nerves of those in whom enjoyment was less\r\nrotary. He was silent long enough to suggest his fearing that almost\r\nanything he might say would appear too allusive; then at last once more\r\nhe took his risk. \xe2\x80\x9cAwfully jolly old place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Van only said; but his posture in the large chair he\r\nhad pushed toward the open window was of itself almost an opinion.\r\nThe August night was hot and the air that came in charged and sweet.\r\nVanderbank smoked with his face to the dusky garden and the dim stars;\r\nat the end of a few moments more of which he glanced round. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think it rather stuffy with that big lamp? As those candles on the\r\nchimney are going we might put it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike this?\xe2\x80\x9d The amiable Mitchy had straightway obliged his companion\r\nand he as promptly took in the effect of the diminished light on the\r\ncharacter of the room, which he commended as if the depth of shadow\r\nproduced were all this companion had sought. He might freshly have\r\nbrought home to Vanderbank that a man sensitive to so many different\r\nthings, and thereby always sure of something or other, could never\r\nreally be incommoded; though that personage presently indeed showed\r\nhimself occupied with another thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I ought to mention to you that I\xe2\x80\x99ve told him how you and\r\nMrs. Brook now both know. I did so this afternoon on our way back from\r\nchurch--I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done it before. He took me a walk round to show me\r\nmore of the place, and that gave me my chance. But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing is that I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it may\r\npossibly make him speak to you, so that it\xe2\x80\x99s better you should know he\r\nknows. But he told me definitely Nanda doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy took this in with an attention that spoke of his already\r\nrecognising how the less tempered darkness favoured talk. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that\r\nall that passed between you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, practically; except of course that I made him understand, I\r\nthink, how it happened that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t kept my own counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but you HAVE--didn\xe2\x80\x99t he at least feel?--or perhaps even have done\r\nbetter, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve two such excellent persons to keep it FOR you. Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe easily believe how we feel with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank appeared for a minute to leave this appeal unheeded; he\r\ncontinued to stare into the garden while he smoked and swung the long\r\nleg he had thrown over the arm of the chair. When he at last spoke,\r\nhowever, it was with some emphasis--perhaps even with some vulgarity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh rot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy hovered without an arrest. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean he CAN\xe2\x80\x99T feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no illusions about you. I know how you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nboth affected, though I of course perfectly trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy had a short silence. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust us not to speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to speak to Nanda herself--though of course too if you spoke to\r\nothers,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99d immediately rush and tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to no one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it. And neither has\r\nMrs. Brook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re sure of that also,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy returned, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\ndoing her justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m quite confident of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd without asking\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re equally sure, without asking, that _I_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t betrayed\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d After which, while, as if to let the question lie there in its\r\nfolly, Vanderbank said nothing, his friend pursued: \xe2\x80\x9cI came, I must tell\r\nyou, terribly near it to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy must you tell me? Your coming \xe2\x80\x98near\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern me, and I take\r\nit you don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m watching or sounding you. Mrs. Brook will have\r\ncome terribly near,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank continued as if to make the matter\r\nfree; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she won\xe2\x80\x99t have done it either. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have been distinctly\r\ntempted--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she won\xe2\x80\x99t have fallen?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cExactly--there we are.\r\n_I_ was distinctly tempted and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t fall. I think your certainty\r\nabout Mrs. Brook,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cshows you do know her. She\xe2\x80\x99s incapable of\r\nanything deliberately nasty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh of anything nasty in any way,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank said musingly and kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; one knows on the whole what she WON\xe2\x80\x99T do.\xe2\x80\x9d After which, for a\r\nperiod, Mitchy roamed and reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in spite of the assurance\r\ngiven you by Mr. Longdon--or perhaps indeed just because of your having\r\ntaken it--I think I ought to mention to you my belief that Nanda does\r\nknow of his offer to you. I mean by having guessed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s in fact more still,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion pursued--\xe2\x80\x9cthat I feel I\r\nshould like to mention to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank at first only repeated. But after a moment he said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndear fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing I speak of is something I should at any rate have said, and\r\nI should have looked out for some chance if we had not had this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mitchy spoke as if his friend\xe2\x80\x99s last words were not of consequence, and\r\nhe continued as Vanderbank got up and, moving rather aimlessly, came and\r\nstood with his back to the chimney. \xe2\x80\x9cMy only hesitation would have been\r\ncaused by its entailing our going down into things in a way that, face\r\nto face--given the private nature of the things--I dare say most men\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t particularly enjoy. But if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. In fact, as I tell you, I recognise an obligation to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank, with his shoulders against the high mantel, uttered\r\nthis without a direct look; he smoked and smoked, then considered the\r\ntip of his cigar. \xe2\x80\x9cYou feel convinced she knows?\xe2\x80\x9d he threw out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s my impression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh any impression of yours--of that sort--is sure to be right. If you\r\nthink I ought to have it from you I\xe2\x80\x99m really grateful. Is that--a--what\r\nyou wanted to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank after a slight pause demanded.\r\n\r\nMitchy, watching him more than he watched Mitchy, shook a mildly\r\ndecisive head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, his eyes on his smoke-puffs, seemed to wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you\r\nwanted is--something else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank for the third time.\r\n\r\nThe ejaculation had been vague, but the movement that followed it was\r\ndefinite; the young man, turning away, found himself again near the\r\nchair he had quitted, and resumed possession of it as a sign of being\r\nat his friend\xe2\x80\x99s service. This friend, however, not only hung fire but\r\nfinally went back to take a shot from a quarter they might have been\r\nsupposed to have left. \xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes me as odd his imagining--awfully\r\nacute as he is--that she has NOT guessed. One wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought he\r\ncould live with her here in such an intimacy--seeing her every day and\r\npretty much all day--and make such a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, his great length all of a lounge again, turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyet I do thoroughly feel the mistake\xe2\x80\x99s not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy had a new serenity of affirmation. \xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps then\xe2\x80\x9d--it occurred to his friend--\xe2\x80\x9che doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really believe\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd only says so to make you feel more easy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that one may--in fairness to one\xe2\x80\x99s self--keep one\xe2\x80\x99s head, as it\r\nwere, and decide quite on one\xe2\x80\x99s own grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you HAVE still to decide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank took time to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve still to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy became\r\nagain on this, in the sociable dusk, a slow-circling vaguely-agitated\r\nelement, and his companion continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIs your idea very generously and\r\nhandsomely to help that by letting me know--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I do definitely renounce\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy took him up--\xe2\x80\x9cany pretension and\r\nany hope? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready with a proof of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve passed my word that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll apply elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank turned more round to him. \xe2\x80\x9cApply to the Duchess for her\r\nniece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s practically settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut since when?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy barely faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cSince this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then not with the Duchess herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Nanda--whose plan from the first, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have forgotten, the\r\nthing has so charmingly been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank could show that his not having in the least forgotten was yet\r\nnot a bar to his being now mystified. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear man, what can Nanda\r\n\xe2\x80\x98settle\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy fate,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy said, pausing well before him.\r\n\r\nVanderbank sat now a minute with raised eyes, catching the\r\nindistinctness of the other\xe2\x80\x99s strange expression. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re both beyond\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what you in particular gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t either till she made it all out to me. One sees then, in such\r\na matter, for one\xe2\x80\x99s self. And as everything\xe2\x80\x99s gain that isn\xe2\x80\x99t loss,\r\nthere was nothing I COULD lose. It gets me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy further explained,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cout of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the way of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, Mitchy frankly showed, was more difficult to say, but he in time\r\nbrought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, of appearing to suggest to you that my existence,\r\nin a prolonged state of singleness, may ever represent for her any real\r\nalternative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut alternative to what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy to being YOUR wife, damn you!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy, on these words turned away\r\nagain, and his companion, in the presence of his renewed dim gyrations,\r\nsat for a minute dumb. Before Van had spoken indeed he was back again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my violence, but of course you really see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not pretending anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank said--\xe2\x80\x9cbut a man MUST\r\nunderstand. What I catch hold of is that you offer me--in the fact that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re thus at any rate disposed of--a proof that I, by the same token,\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t, if I hesitate to \xe2\x80\x98go in,\xe2\x80\x99 have a pretext for saying to myself\r\nthat I MAY deprive her--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, precisely,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy now urbanely assented: \xe2\x80\x9cof something--in the\r\nshape of a man with MY amount of money--that she may live to regret\r\nand to languish for. My amount of money, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d he very simply\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cis nothing to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you want me to be sure that--so far as I may ever have had a\r\nscruple--she has had her chance and got rid of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompletely,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank with the aid of his cigar thoughtfully pieced it\r\nout--\xe2\x80\x9cthat may possibly bring me to the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed.\r\n\r\nHe had stood a moment longer, almost as if to see the possibility\r\ndevelop before his eyes, and had even started at the next sound of his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s voice. What Vanderbank in fact brought out, however, only made\r\nhim turn his back. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you like so very much little Aggie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cNanda does. And I like Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too amazing,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank mused. His musing had presently the\r\neffect of making him rise; meditation indeed beset him after he was\r\non his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help its coming over me then that on such an\r\nextraordinary system you must also rather like ME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you have, my dear Van?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy frankly asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsort of thing you must be most used to. For at the present\r\nmoment--look!--aren\xe2\x80\x99t we all at you at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if his dear Van had managed to appear to wonder. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98All\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNanda, Mrs. Brook, Mr. Longdon--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you. I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNames of distinction. And all the others,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99re the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the best,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank simply repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s at all events most\r\nextraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I make you out on the whole better\r\nthan I do Mr. Longdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh aren\xe2\x80\x99t we very much the same--simple lovers of life? That is of that\r\nfiner essence of it which appeals to the consciousness--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe consciousness?\xe2\x80\x9d--his companion took up his hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, enlarged and improved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words had made on Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s lips an image by which his friend\r\nappeared for a moment held. \xe2\x80\x9cOne doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really know quite what to say\r\nor to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you must take it all quietly. You\xe2\x80\x99re of a special class; one of\r\nthose who, as we said the other day--don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?--are a\r\nsource of the sacred terror. People made in such a way must take the\r\nconsequences; just as people must take them,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwho are\r\nmade as _I_ am. So cheer up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, uttering this incitement, had moved to the empty chair by\r\nthe window, in which he presently was sunk; and it might have been in\r\nemulation of his previous strolling and straying that Vanderbank himself\r\nnow began to revolve. The meditation he next threw out, however, showed\r\na certain resistance to Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s advice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad at any rate I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeprive her of a fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t deprive her of mine of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy answered from the\r\nchair; \xe2\x80\x9cbut isn\xe2\x80\x99t her enjoyment of Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s at least a good deal\r\nstaked after all on your action?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank stopped short. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s his idea to settle it ALL?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy gave out his glare. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98care a hang.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t been here so long,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on as his companion at first\r\nretorted nothing, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout making up my mind for myself about his means.\r\nHe IS distinctly bloated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt sent Vanderbank off again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh well, she\xe2\x80\x99ll no more get all in the\r\none event than she\xe2\x80\x99ll get nothing in the other. She\xe2\x80\x99ll only get a sort\r\nof provision. But she\xe2\x80\x99ll get that whatever happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if you\xe2\x80\x99re sure--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy simply commented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, confound it!\xe2\x80\x9d Then--for his voice had been irritated--Van\r\nspoke more quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I see her here--though on his wish of\r\ncourse--handling things quite as if they were her own and paying him a\r\nvisit without, apparently, any calculable end. What\xe2\x80\x99s that on HIS part\r\nbut a pledge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh Mitchy could show off-hand that he knew what it was. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pledge,\r\nquite as much, to you. He shows you the whole thing. He likes you not a\r\nwhit less than he likes her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh thunder!\xe2\x80\x9d Van impatiently sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as \xe2\x80\x98rum\xe2\x80\x99 as you please, but there it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the inexorable\r\nMitchy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen does he think I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it for THIS?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor \xe2\x80\x98this\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the place, the whole thing, as you call it, that he shows me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy had a short silence that might have represented a change of\r\ncolour. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough?\xe2\x80\x9d But he instantly took himself up. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse he wants--as I do--to treat you with tact!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank immediately said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour \xe2\x80\x98tact\xe2\x80\x99--yours\r\nand his--is marvellous, and Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s greatest of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s momentary renewal of stillness was addressed, he somehow\r\nmanaged not obscurely to convey, to the last clause of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspeech. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nfrankly ask him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank again, as the phrase is, \xe2\x80\x9cmooned\xe2\x80\x9d about a little. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know that it would do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that it would be exactly--what do you call it?--\xe2\x80\x98square.\xe2\x80\x99 Or even\r\nquite delicate or decent. To take from him, in the way of an assurance\r\nso handsomely offered, so much, and then to ask for more: I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel I\r\ncan do it. Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99ve my little conviction. To the question itself he\r\nmight easily reply that it\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy dropped. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch pressure might suggest to him moreover\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99re hesitating more than you perhaps really are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh as to THAT\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cI think he practically knows how\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how little?\xe2\x80\x9d He met this, however, with no more form than if it had\r\nbeen a poor joke, so that Mitchy also smoked for a moment in silence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your coming down here, you mean, for these three or four days,\r\nthat will have fixed it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question this time was one to which the speaker might have expected\r\nan answer, but Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s only immediate answer was to walk and walk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want so awfully to be kind to her,\xe2\x80\x9d he at last said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d Then with irrelevance Mitchy harked back. \xe2\x80\x9cShall\r\n_I_ find out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Vanderbank, with another thought, had lost the thread. \xe2\x80\x9cFind out\r\nwhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy if she does get anything--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m not kind ENOUGH?\xe2\x80\x9d--Van had caught up again. \xe2\x80\x9cDear no; I\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\nyou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak unless first spoken to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, HE may speak--since he knows we know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely, for he can\xe2\x80\x99t make out why I told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell ME, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou told Mrs. Brook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, SHE told you, and her talking about it is the unpleasant idea. He\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get her down anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mrs. Brook!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy meditated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mrs. Brook!\xe2\x80\x9d his companion echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you said,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYOUR knowing? Well, I dare say he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want a lot of\r\ngossip and chatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy with meekness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may absolutely take it from you then,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank presently resumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Nanda has her idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh she didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me so. But it\xe2\x80\x99s none the less my belief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank at last threw off, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel it for myself. If only\r\nbecause she always knows everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued without looking at\r\nMitchy. \xe2\x80\x9cShe always knows everything, everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me so herself yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she told ME so to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation might have shown he was struck with this. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s information that either of us required. But of course\r\nshe--can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything, literally everything, in\r\nLondon, in the world she lives in, is in the air she breathes--so that\r\nthe longer SHE\xe2\x80\x99S in it the more she\xe2\x80\x99ll know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more she\xe2\x80\x99ll know, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy acknowledged. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nin it, you see, down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Only she appears to have come down with such accumulations. And she\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be here for ever,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank hastened to mention. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not\r\nif you marry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t that at the same time,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank asked, \xe2\x80\x9cjust the\r\ndifficulty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy looked vague. \xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy as a married woman she\xe2\x80\x99ll be steeped in it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely\xe2\x80\x9d--oh Mitchy could be candid! \xe2\x80\x9cBut the difference will be that\r\nfor a married woman it won\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It only matters for girls,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nplausibly continued--\xe2\x80\x9cand then only for those on whom no one takes\r\npity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trouble is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank--but quite as if uttering only a\r\ngeneral truth--\xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xe2\x80\x99s just a thing that may sometimes operate as\r\na bar to pity. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it for the non-marrying girls that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nparticularly matter? For the others it\xe2\x80\x99s such an odd preparation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy declared.\r\n\r\nVanderbank visibly demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but your choice--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs such a different sort of thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy, for the half-hour, in the\r\nambiguous dusk, had never looked more droll. \xe2\x80\x9cThe young lady I named\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t my CHOICE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, that\xe2\x80\x99s only a sign the more that you do these things more\r\neasily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x98easily\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t at any rate to keep it up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, who had looked\r\nat his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cTwelve twenty-five--good-night. Shall I blow out the\r\ncandles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo, please. I\xe2\x80\x99ll close the window\xe2\x80\x9d--and Mitchy went to it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll follow\r\nyou--good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d The candles after a minute were out and his friend\r\nhad gone, but Mitchy, left in darkness face to face with the vague quiet\r\ngarden, still stood there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK EIGHTH. TISHY GRENDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe footman, opening the door, mumbled his name without sincerity,\r\nand Vanderbank, passing in, found in fact--for he had caught the\r\nsymptom--the chairs and tables, the lighted lamps and the flowers alone\r\nin possession. He looked at his watch, which exactly marked eight, then\r\nturned to speak again to the servant, who had, however, without another\r\nsound and as if blushing for the house, already closed him in. There was\r\nnothing indeed but Mrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s want of promptness that failed of a\r\nwelcome: her drawing-room, on the January night, showed its elegance\r\nthrough a suffusion of pink electricity which melted, at the end of\r\nthe vista, into the faintly golden glow of a retreat still more sacred.\r\nVanderbank walked after a moment into the second room, which also proved\r\nempty and which had its little globes of white fire--discreetly limited\r\nin number--coated with lemon-coloured silk. The walls, covered with\r\ndelicate French mouldings, were so fair that they seemed vaguely\r\nsilvered; the low French chimney had a French fire. There was a\r\nlemon-coloured stuff on the sofa and chairs, a wonderful polish on the\r\nfloor that was largely exposed, and a copy of a French novel in blue\r\npaper on one of the spindle-legged tables. Vanderbank looked about him\r\nan instant as if generally struck, then gave himself to something that\r\nhad particularly caught his eye. This was simply his own name written\r\nrather large on the cover of the French book and endowed, after he\r\nhad taken the volume up, with the power to hold his attention the\r\nmore closely the longer he looked at it. He uttered, for a private\r\nsatisfaction, before letting the matter pass, a low confused sound;\r\nafter which, flinging the book down with some emphasis in another place,\r\nhe moved to the chimney-piece, where his eyes for a little intently\r\nfixed the small ashy wood-fire. When he raised them again it was, on the\r\nobservation that the beautiful clock on the mantel was wrong, to consult\r\nonce more his watch and then give a glance, in the chimney-glass, at the\r\nstate of his moustache, the ends of which he twisted for a moment\r\nwith due care. While so engaged he became aware of something else and,\r\nquickly facing about, recognised in the doorway of the room the other\r\nfigure the glass had just reflected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a quick handshake. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s down?\xe2\x80\x9d But he\r\nhad already passed with Nanda, on their greeting, back into the first\r\nroom, which contained only themselves, and she had mentioned that she\r\nbelieved Tishy to have said 8.15, which meant of course anything people\r\nliked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh then there\xe2\x80\x99ll be nobody till nine. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, I suppose, sufficiently\r\nstudy my note; which didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention to me, by the way,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were to be here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but why SHOULD it?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda spoke again, however, before he could\r\nreply. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say that when she wrote to you she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow you\xe2\x80\x99d come bang up to meet me?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cJolly at any\r\nrate, thanks to my mistake, to have in this way a quiet moment with you.\r\nYou came on ahead of your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no--I\xe2\x80\x99m staying here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon came up with me--I came here, Friday last, straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou parted at the door?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with marked gaiety.\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment--she was more serious. \xe2\x80\x9cYes--but only for a day or\r\ntwo. He\xe2\x80\x99s coming tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. How delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda said, looking at the flowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully kind of him when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been such a brute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow--a brute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean not writing--nor going back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I see,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda simply returned.\r\n\r\nIt was a simplicity that, clearly enough, made her friend a little\r\nawkward. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he--a--minded? Hut he can\xe2\x80\x99t have complained!\xe2\x80\x9d he quickly\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he never complains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no--it isn\xe2\x80\x99t in him. But it\xe2\x80\x99s just that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nmakes one feel so base. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been ferociously busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows that--he likes it,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda returned. \xe2\x80\x9cHe delights in your work.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve done what I can for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve evidently brought him round. I mean to\r\nthis lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Tishy? Oh of course I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave her--with nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank became jocose again--\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a London necessity. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t leave anybody with nobody--exposed to everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMild as it was, however, Nanda missed the pleasantry. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYachting--but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she and you are just doing this together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s dreadfully frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh she mustn\xe2\x80\x99t allow herself,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cto be too much carried\r\naway by it. But we\xe2\x80\x99re to have your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and papa. It\xe2\x80\x99s really for Mitchy and Aggie,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl went\r\non--\xe2\x80\x9cbefore they go abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then I see what you\xe2\x80\x99ve come up for! Tishy and I aren\xe2\x80\x99t in it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall for Mitchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for him you\xe2\x80\x99re quite right.\r\nHe has always been of a kindness to me--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat culminated in marrying your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\ncharming certainly, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to diminish the merit of it. But\r\nAggie herself, I gather, is of a charm now--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d--Nanda was eager. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t she come out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a bound--into the arena. But when a young person\xe2\x80\x99s out with\r\nMitchy--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything against that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out with him\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but my dear child--!\xe2\x80\x9d Van frankly argued.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, a thing to notice. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it would be just so. It\r\nalways is when they\xe2\x80\x99ve been like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean as she apparently WAS? But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it make one wonder a\r\nlittle IF she was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh she was--I know she was. And we\xe2\x80\x99re also to have Harold,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda\r\ncontinued--\xe2\x80\x9canother of Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiaries. It WOULD be a banquet,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it? if we were to have them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank hesitated, and the look he fixed on the door might have\r\nsuggested a certain open attention to the arrival of their hostess or\r\nthe announcement of other guests. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got them all, the\r\nbeneficiaries, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got, in having me, I should suppose, about the\r\nbiggest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh what has he done for you?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda asked.\r\n\r\nAgain her friend hung fire. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember something you said to me\r\ndown there in August?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked vague but quite unembarrassed. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember but too well that\r\nI chattered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou declared to me that you knew everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--and I said so to Mitchy too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear child, you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, what makes ME the victim of his insatiable benevolence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt of it yourself that\xe2\x80\x99s all that\xe2\x80\x99s required.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m quite GLAD to hear of something I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re to have Harold too,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a beneficiary? Then we SHALL fill up! Harold will give us a stamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t he? I hear of nothing but his success. Mother wrote me that\r\npeople are frantic for him; and,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl after an instant, \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nyou know what Cousin Jane wrote me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat WOULD she now? I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda relieved him of this effort. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy that mother has transferred to\r\nhim all the scruples she felt--\xe2\x80\x98even to excess\xe2\x80\x99--in MY time, about what\r\nwe might pick up among you all that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a neat one for ME!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank declared. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I like your talk\r\nabout your antediluvian \xe2\x80\x98time.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat exactly is it,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank presently demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you describe\r\nin that manner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my little hour. And the danger of picking up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s none of it here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda appeared frankly to judge. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--because, really, Tishy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee? is natural. We just talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank showed his interest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhereas at your mother\xe2\x80\x99s--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you were all afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank laughed straight out. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind my telling her that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh she knows it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard her say herself you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh _I_ was,\xe2\x80\x9d he concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken of that before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m speaking now of all of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was she who was\r\nmost so, for she tried--I know she did, she told me so--to control you.\r\nAnd it was when, you were most controlled--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan\xe2\x80\x99s amusement took it up. \xe2\x80\x9cThat we were most detrimental?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, because of course what\xe2\x80\x99s so awfully unutterable is just what we\r\nmost notice. Tishy knows that,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda wonderfully observed.\r\n\r\nAs the reflexion of her tone might have been caught by an observer\r\nin Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s face it was in all probability caught by his\r\ninterlocutress, who superficially, however, need have recognised\r\nthere--what was all she showed--but the right manner of waiting for\r\ndinner. \xe2\x80\x9cThe better way then is to dash right in? That\xe2\x80\x99s what our friend\r\nhere does?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you know what she does!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl replied as with a sudden drop of\r\ninterest in the question. She turned at the moment to the opening of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nIt was Tishy who at last appeared, and her guest had his greeting ready.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking of the delicate matters as to which you think it\xe2\x80\x99s better\r\nto dash right in; but I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say your inviting a hungry man to\r\ndinner doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sign of Tishy Grendon--as it had been often called in a society in\r\nwhich variety of reference had brought to high perfection, for usual\r\nsafety, the sense of signs--was a retarded facial glimmer that, in\r\nrespect to any subject, closed up the rear of the procession. It had\r\nbeen said of her indeed that when processions were at all rapid she was\r\nusually to be found, on a false impression of her whereabouts, mixed up\r\nwith the next; so that now, for instance, by the time she had reached\r\nthe point of saying to Vanderbank \xe2\x80\x9cAre you REALLY hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda had\r\nbegun to appeal to him for some praise of their hostess\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.\r\nThis was of course with soft looks up and down at her clothes. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe too nice? Did you ever see anything so lovely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so faint with inanition,\xe2\x80\x9d Van replied to Mrs. Grendon, \xe2\x80\x9cthat--like\r\nthe traveller in the desert, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?--I only make out, as an oasis or\r\na mirage, a sweet green rustling blur. I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t trust YOU,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda said on her friend\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. \xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x98green\xe2\x80\x99--men are amazing: they don\xe2\x80\x99t know the dearest old blue that ever\r\nwas seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIS it your \xe2\x80\x98OLD blue\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank, monocular, very earnestly asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan imagine it was \xe2\x80\x98dear,\xe2\x80\x99 but I should have thought--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was yellow\xe2\x80\x9d--Nanda helped him out--\xe2\x80\x9cif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t kindly told\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s figure showed the confidence of objects consecrated by\r\npublicity; bodily speaking a beautiful human plant, it might have taken\r\nthe last November gale to account for the completeness with which,\r\nin some quarters, she had shed her leaves. Her companions could\r\nonly emphasise by the direction of their eyes the nature of the\r\nresponsibility with which a spectator would have seen them saddled--a\r\nchoice, as to consciousness, between the effect of her being and the\r\neffect of her not being dressed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m hideous--of course I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Tishy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only just clean. Here\xe2\x80\x99s Nanda now, who\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she vaguely continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand Nanda--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but, darling, Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s clean too!\xe2\x80\x9d the young lady in question\r\ninterrupted; on which her fellow guest could only laugh with her as in\r\nrelief from the antithesis of which her presence of mind had averted\r\nthe completion, little indeed as in Mrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s talk that element of\r\nstyle was usually involved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in such a matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank observed as if it were\r\nthe least he could decently say, \xe2\x80\x9clike challenging enquiry; and here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHarold, precisely,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in the next breath, \xe2\x80\x9cas clear and crisp\r\nand undefiled as a fresh five-pound note.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fresh one?\xe2\x80\x9d--Harold had passed in a flash from his hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cA man\r\nwho like me hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen one for six months could perfectly do, I assure\r\nyou, with one that has lost its what-do-you-call it.\xe2\x80\x9d He kissed Nanda\r\nwith a friendly peck, then, more completely aware, had a straighter\r\napprehension for Tishy. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, YOU seem to have lost something,\r\nthough I\xe2\x80\x99ll say for you that one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t miss it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grendon looked from him to Nanda. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he mean anything very\r\nnasty? I can only understand you when Nanda explains,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned\r\nto Harold. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact there\xe2\x80\x99s scarcely anything I understand except\r\nwhen Nanda explains. It\xe2\x80\x99s too dreadful her being away so much now with\r\nstrange people, whom I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she can\xe2\x80\x99t begin to do for what she does\r\nfor me; it makes me miss her all round. And the only thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nacross that she CAN\xe2\x80\x99T explain,\xe2\x80\x9d Tishy bunched straight at her friend,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis what on earth she\xe2\x80\x99s doing there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy she\xe2\x80\x99s working Mr. Longdon, like a good fine girl,\xe2\x80\x9d Harold said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clike a good true daughter and even, though she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love me nearly\r\nso much as I love HER, I will say, like a good true sister. I\xe2\x80\x99m bound\r\nto tell you, my dear Tishy,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I think it awfully happy,\r\nwith the trend of manners, for any really nice young thing to be a bit\r\nlost to sight. London, upon my honour, is quite too awful for girls, and\r\nany big house in the country is as much worse--with the promiscuities\r\nand opportunities and all that--as you know for yourselves. _I_ know\r\nsome places,\xe2\x80\x9d Harold declared, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere, if I had any girls, I\xe2\x80\x99d see \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nshot before I\xe2\x80\x99d take \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you know too much, my dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank remarked with\r\ncommiseration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh my brave old Van,\xe2\x80\x9d the youth returned, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t speak as if YOU had\r\nillusions. I know,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued to the ladies, \xe2\x80\x9cjust where some of Van\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmust have perished, and some of the places I\xe2\x80\x99ve in mind are just where\r\nhe has left his tracks. A man must be wedded to sweet superstitions\r\nnot nowadays to HAVE to open his eyes. Nanda love,\xe2\x80\x9d he benevolently\r\nconcluded, \xe2\x80\x9cstay where you are. So at least I shan\xe2\x80\x99t blush for you. That\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve the good fortune to have reached your time of life with so little\r\ninjury to your innocence makes you a case by yourself, of which we\r\nmust recognise the claims. If Tishy can\xe2\x80\x99t make you gasp, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nagainst you nor against HER--Tishy comes of one of the few innocent\r\nEnglish families that are left. Yes, you may all cry \xe2\x80\x98Oho!\xe2\x80\x99--but I defy\r\nyou to name me say five, or at most seven, in which some awful thing or\r\nother hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened. Of course ours is one, and Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s is one, and\r\nVan\xe2\x80\x99s is one, and Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s is one, and that makes you, bang off,\r\nfour. So there you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Harold gaily wound up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see now why he\xe2\x80\x99s the rage!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank observed to Nanda.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Grendon expressed to their young friend a lingering wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou mean you go in for the adoption--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Tishy!\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda mildly murmured.\r\n\r\nHarold, however, had his own tact. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dear man\xe2\x80\x99s taking her quite\r\nover? Not altogether unreservedly. I\xe2\x80\x99m with the governor: I think we\r\nought to GET something. \xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, dear man, but what do you GIVE us for\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x99--that\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ should say to him. I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s making quite the bargain she might. If he were to\r\nwant ME I don\xe2\x80\x99t say he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have me, but I should have it on my\r\nconscience to make it in one way or another a good thing for my parents.\r\nYou ARE nice, old woman\xe2\x80\x9d--he turned to his sister--\xe2\x80\x9cand one can still\r\nfeel for the flower of your youth something of the wonderful \xe2\x80\x98reverence\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat we were all brought up on. For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake therefore--all the\r\nmore--don\xe2\x80\x99t really close with him till you\xe2\x80\x99ve had another word or two\r\nwith me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged\xe2\x80\x9d--he appealed to the company again--\xe2\x80\x9cif he shall\r\nhave her for nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee rather,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank said to Mrs. Grendon, \xe2\x80\x9chow little it\xe2\x80\x99s like\r\nyour really losing her that she should be able this evening fairly to\r\nbring the dear man to you. At this rate we don\xe2\x80\x99t lose her--we simply get\r\nhim as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but is it quite the dear man\xe2\x80\x99s COMPANY we want?\xe2\x80\x9d--and Harold looked\r\nanxious and acute. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s the best arrangement Nanda can make--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he hears us talking in this way, which strikes me as very horrible,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Nanda interposed very simply and gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to\r\nget anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Harold\xe2\x80\x99s talk,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank protested, \xe2\x80\x9coffers, I think, an\r\nextraordinary interest; only I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say it crushes me to the\r\nearth. I\xe2\x80\x99ve to make at least, as I listen to him, a big effort to bear\r\nup. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued to his young friend, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nI used to feel I was in it; but the way you bring home to me, dreadful\r\nyouth, that I\xe2\x80\x99m already NOT--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold looked earnest to understand. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hungry generations tread you\r\ndown--is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank gave a pleasant tragic headshake. \xe2\x80\x9cWe speak a different\r\nlanguage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but I think I perfectly understand yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just my anguish--and your advantage. It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully curious,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Vanderbank went on to Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I feel as if I must figure to him,\r\nyou know, very much as Mr. Longdon figures to me. Mr. Longdon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsomehow get into me. Yet I do, I think, into him. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t matter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d--Nanda, with her eyes on him, echoed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon and I. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, for\r\nTishy, with sociable sadness, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it IS short innings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grendon, who was clearly credulous, looked positively frightened.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but, my dear, thank you! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t begun to LIVE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _I_ have--that\xe2\x80\x99s just where it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harold. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you all\r\nthe more, old Van, for the tip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an announcement just now at the door, and Tishy turned to meet\r\nthe Duchess, with Harold, almost as if he had been master of the house,\r\nfiguring but a step behind her. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind HER,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank immediately\r\nsaid to the companion with whom he was left, \xe2\x80\x9cbut tell me, while I still\r\nhave hold of you, who wrote my name on the French novel that I noticed a\r\nfew minutes since in the other room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda at first only wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s there--didn\xe2\x80\x99t YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were here you\xe2\x80\x99d see if it\xe2\x80\x99s my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda faltered, and for somewhat longer. \xe2\x80\x9cHow should I see? What do I\r\nknow of your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her hard. \xe2\x80\x9cYou HAVE seen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--so little!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean I\xe2\x80\x99ve not written to you for so long? Surely I did in--when\r\nwas it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when? But why SHOULD you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in quite a different tone.\r\n\r\nHe was not prepared on this with the right statement, and what he did\r\nafter a moment bring out had for the occasion a little the sound of the\r\nwrong. \xe2\x80\x9cThe beauty of YOU is that you\xe2\x80\x99re too good; which for me is but\r\nanother way of saying you\xe2\x80\x99re too clever. You make no demands. You let\r\nthings go. You don\xe2\x80\x99t allow in particular for the human weakness that\r\nenjoys an occasional glimpse of the weakness of others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had deeply attended to him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean perhaps one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show\r\nenough what one wants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that must be it. You\xe2\x80\x99re so fiendishly proud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe appeared again to wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cNot too much so, at any rate, only to\r\nwant from YOU--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant for yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she simply said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, that\xe2\x80\x99s poor bliss!\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does it come then,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nnext said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat with this barrenness of our intercourse I know so well\r\nYOUR hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA series of announcements had meanwhile been made, with guests arriving\r\nto match them, and Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s eyes at this moment engaged themselves with\r\nMr. Longdon and her mother, who entered the room together. When she\r\nlooked back to her companion she had had time to drop a consciousness\r\nof his question. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m proud, to you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not good,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m good--always to you--I\xe2\x80\x99m not proud. I know at all events perfectly\r\nhow immensely you\xe2\x80\x99re occupied, what a quantity of work you get through\r\nand how every minute counts for you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make it a crime to me that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that would show, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it? that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much else. But how it\r\nall comes back--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to what?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the old story. You know how I\xe2\x80\x99m occupied. You know how I work. You\r\nknow how I manage my time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda. \xe2\x80\x9cIt IS my knowing, after all, everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything. The book I just mentioned is one that, months ago---I\r\nremember now--I lent your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh a thing in a blue cover? I remember then too.\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s face cleared\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten it was lying about here, but I must have brought\r\nit--in fact I remember I did--for Tishy. And I wrote your name on it so\r\nthat we might know--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t lent it to either of you? It didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur to you to write\r\nyour own?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t mine? It ISN\xe2\x80\x99T mine, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore also if it can\xe2\x80\x99t be Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing\xe2\x80\x99s simple enough--it\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Simple\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI like you! And may I ask if you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nread the remarkable work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she wonderfully said: \xe2\x80\x9cFor Tishy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see if it would do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often done that,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she takes your word?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally. I think I remember she did that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd read the confounded thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her a moment longer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too particular!\xe2\x80\x9d he rather\r\noddly sounded, turning away with it to meet Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen after dinner the company was restored to the upper rooms the\r\nDuchess was on her feet as soon as the door opened for the entrance of\r\nthe gentlemen. Then it might have been seen that she had a purpose,\r\nfor as soon as the elements had again, with a due amount of the usual\r\nshuffling and mismatching, been mixed, her case proved the first to have\r\nbeen settled. She had got Mr. Longdon beside her on a sofa that was just\r\nright for two. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seized you without a scruple,\xe2\x80\x9d she frankly said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor there are things I want to say to you as well as very particularly\r\nto ask. More than anything else of course I want again to thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo collapse of Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s was ever incompatible with his sitting well\r\nforward. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Again\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you look so blank,\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you\xe2\x80\x99ve really forgotten\r\nthe gratitude I expressed to you when you were so good as to bring\r\nNanda up for Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s marriage?--or because you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it a matter\r\nI should trouble myself to return to? How can I help it,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on\r\nwithout waiting for his answer, \xe2\x80\x9cif I see your hand in everything that\r\nhas happened since the so interesting talk I had with you last summer\r\nat Mertle? There have been times when I\xe2\x80\x99ve really thought of writing\r\nto you; I\xe2\x80\x99ve even had a bold bad idea of proposing myself to you for a\r\nSunday. Then the crisis, my momentary alarm, has struck me as blowing\r\nover, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt I could wait for some luck like this, which would\r\nsooner or later come.\xe2\x80\x9d Her companion, however, appeared to leave the\r\nluck so on her hands that she could only snatch up, to cover its nudity,\r\nthe next handsomest assumption. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you cleverly guess that what I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen worried about is the effect on Mrs. Brook of the loss of her dear\r\nMitchy. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve not at all events had your own impression of this\r\neffect, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that only because these last months you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so little\r\nof her? I\xe2\x80\x99VE seen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cenough and to spare.\xe2\x80\x9d She waited\r\nas if for her vision, on this, to be flashed back at her, but the only\r\nresult of her speech was that her friend looked hard at somebody else.\r\nIt was just this symptom indeed that perhaps sufficed her, for in a\r\nminute she was again afloat. \xe2\x80\x9cThings have turned out so much as I\r\ndesire them that I should really feel wicked not to have a humble heart.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a quarter indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a noble unction, \xe2\x80\x9cto which I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t fear to say for myself that no day and no night pass without my\r\nshowing it. However, you English, I know, don\xe2\x80\x99t like one to speak of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s religion. I\xe2\x80\x99m just as simply thankful for mine--I mean with as\r\nlittle sense of indecency or agony about it--as I am for my health or\r\nmy carriage. My point is at any rate that I say in no cruel spirit of\r\ntriumph, yet do none the less very distinctly say, that the person Mr.\r\nMitchett\xe2\x80\x99s marriage has inevitably pleased least may be now rather to be\r\nfeared.\xe2\x80\x9d These words had the sound of a climax, and she had brought them\r\nout as if, with her duty done, to leave them; but something that took\r\nplace, for her eye, in the face Mr. Longdon had half-averted gave her\r\nafter an instant what he might have called her second wind. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I know\r\nyou think she always HAS been! But you\xe2\x80\x99ve exaggerated--as to that; and\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t say that even at present it\xe2\x80\x99s anything we shan\xe2\x80\x99t get the better\r\nof. Only we must keep our heads. We must remember that from her own\r\npoint of view she has her grievance, and we must at least look as if we\r\ntrusted her. That, you know, is what you\xe2\x80\x99ve never quite done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave out a murmur of discomfort which produced in him a change of\r\nposition, and the sequel to the change was that he presently accepted\r\nfrom his cushioned angle of the sofa the definite support it could\r\noffer. If his eyes moreover had not met his companion\xe2\x80\x99s they had been\r\nbrought by the hand he repeatedly and somewhat distressfully passed over\r\nthem closer to the question of which of the alien objects presented to\r\nhis choice it would cost him least to profess to handle. What he had\r\nalready paid, a spectator would easily have gathered from the long,\r\nthe suppressed wriggle that had ended in his falling back, was some\r\nsacrifice of his habit of not privately depreciating those to whom he\r\nwas publicly civil. It was plain, however, that when he presently spoke\r\nhis thought had taken a stretch. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve fully intended to be\r\neverything that\xe2\x80\x99s proper. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mr. Vanderbank cares for\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt kindled in the Duchess an immediate light. \xe2\x80\x9cVous avez bien de\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99esprit. You put one at one\xe2\x80\x99s ease. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been vaguely groping while\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re already there. It\xe2\x80\x99s really only for Nanda he cares?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--really.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess debated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet exactly how much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had another, a briefer pause. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it about time you\r\nSHOULD?\xe2\x80\x9d Once more she waited, then seemed to feel her opportunity\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve worked a bit together, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t take me into your\r\nconfidence. I dare say you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m quite straight. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nreally see how I MUST be?\xe2\x80\x9d She had a pleading note which made him at\r\nlast more consentingly face her. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on with the\r\nadvantage of it, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, having got all I want for myself, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nmotive in the world for spoiling the fun of another? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want in the\r\nleast, I assure you, to spoil even Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s; for how will she get a\r\nbit less out of him--I mean than she does now--if what you desire SHOULD\r\ntake place? Honestly, my dear man, that\xe2\x80\x99s quite what _I_ desire, and I\r\nonly want, over and above, to help you. What I feel for Nanda, believe\r\nme, is pure pity. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99m frantically grateful to her, because\r\nin the long run--one way or another--she\xe2\x80\x99ll have found her account. It\r\nnevertheless worries me to see her; and all the more because of this\r\nvery certitude, which you\xe2\x80\x99ve so kindly just settled for me, that our\r\nyoung man hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really with her mother--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever the certitude Mr. Longdon had kindly settled, it was in another\r\ninterest that he at this moment broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he YOUR young man too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was not too much amused to cast about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t such marked ornaments of life a little the property of all who\r\nadmire and enjoy them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou \xe2\x80\x98enjoy\xe2\x80\x99 him?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon asked in the same straightforward way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmensely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis silence for a little seemed the sign of a plan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t done with Mrs. Brook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the thing that WOULD be the complication. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone beyond\r\na certain point. You may ask how one knows such matters, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve not quite a receipt for it. A woman knows, but she can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. They\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t done, as it\xe2\x80\x99s called, anything wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be extremely horrid if they had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but, for you and me who know life, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t THAT that--if other\r\nthings had made for it--would have prevented! As it happens, however,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got off easily. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to him--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had forms he could only take up. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Speak\xe2\x80\x99 to him--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy as much as she would have liked to be able to believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where\xe2\x80\x99s the danger of which you appear to wish to warn me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust in her feeling in the case as most women would feel. You see she\r\ndid what she could for her daughter. She did, I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say, as that\r\nsort of thing goes among you people, a good deal. She treasured up, she\r\nnursed along Mitchy, whom she would also, though of course not so much,\r\nhave liked herself. Nanda could have kept him on with a word, becoming\r\nthereby so much the less accessible for YOUR plan. That would have\r\nthoroughly obliged her mother, but your little English girls, in\r\nthese altered times--oh I know how you feel them!--don\xe2\x80\x99t stand on such\r\ntrifles; and--even if you think it odd of me--I can\xe2\x80\x99t defend myself,\r\nthough I\xe2\x80\x99ve so directly profited, against a certain compassion also for\r\nMrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s upset. As a good-natured woman I feel in short for both of\r\nthem. I deplore all round what\xe2\x80\x99s after all a rather sad relation. Only,\r\nas I tell you, Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s the one, I naturally say to myself, for me now\r\nmost to think of; if I don\xe2\x80\x99t assume too much, that is, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuffer by my freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon put by with a mere drop of his eyes the question of his\r\nsuffering: there was so clearly for him an issue more relevant. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou know of my \xe2\x80\x98plan\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear man, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you that ever since Mertle I\xe2\x80\x99ve made\r\nout your hand? What on earth for other people can your action look like\r\nbut an adoption?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf--a--HIM?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re delightful. Of--a--HER! If it does come to the same thing for\r\nyou, so much the better. That at any rate is what we\xe2\x80\x99re all taking\r\nit for, and Mrs. Brook herself en tete. She sees--through your\r\ngenerosity--Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s life more or less, at the worst, arranged for, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s just what gives her a good conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Longdon breathed rather hard it seemed to show at least that he\r\nfollowed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she want of a good conscience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom under her high tiara an instant she almost looked down at him. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\r\nyou do hate her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe coloured, but held his ground. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me yourself she\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nbe feared?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and watched. But--if possible--with amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmusement?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon faintly gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at her now,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend went on with an indication that was indeed\r\neasy to embrace. Separated from them by the width of the room, Mrs.\r\nBrook was, though placed in profile, fully presented; the satisfaction\r\nwith which she had lately sunk upon a light gilt chair marked itself\r\nas superficial and was moreover visibly not confirmed by the fact that\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s high-perched head, arrested before her in a general survey\r\nof opportunity, kept her eyes too far above the level of talk. Their\r\ncompanions were dispersed, some in the other room, and for the occupants\r\nof the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s sofa they made, as a couple in communion, a picture,\r\nframed and detached, vaguely reduplicated in the high polish of the\r\nFrench floor. \xe2\x80\x9cShe IS tremendously pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess appeared to\r\ndrop this as a plea for indulgence and to be impelled in fact by the\r\ninterlocutor\xe2\x80\x99s silence to carry it further. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never at all thought,\r\nyou know, that Nanda touches her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean for beauty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend, for his simplicity, discriminated. \xe2\x80\x9cAh they\xe2\x80\x99ve neither of\r\nthem \xe2\x80\x98beauty.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a word to make free with. But the mother has\r\ngrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the daughter hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a line. You answer me of course, when I say THAT, you answer me\r\nwith your adored Lady Julia, and will want to know what then becomes of\r\nthe lucky resemblance. I quite grant you that Lady Julia must have had\r\nthe thing we speak of. But that dear sweet blessed thing is very much\r\nthe same lost secret as the dear sweet blessed OTHER thing that went\r\naway with it--the decent leisure that, for the most part, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also\r\nseen the last of. It\xe2\x80\x99s the thing at any rate that poor Nanda and all\r\nher kind have most effectually got rid of. Oh if you\xe2\x80\x99d trust me a little\r\nmore you\xe2\x80\x99d see that I\xe2\x80\x99m quite at one with you on all the changes for the\r\nworse. I bear up, but I\xe2\x80\x99m old enough to have known. All the same Mrs.\r\nBrook has something--say what you like--when she bends that little brown\r\nhead. Dieu sait comme elle se coiffe, but what she gets out of it! Only\r\nlook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon conveyed in an indescribable manner that he had retired to\r\na great distance; yet even from this position he must have launched a\r\nglance that arrived at a middle way. \xe2\x80\x9cThey both know you\xe2\x80\x99re watching\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t they know YOU are? Poor Mr. Van has a consciousness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo should I if two terrible women--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere admiring you both at once?\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess folded the big feathered\r\nfan that had partly protected their vision. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, SHE, poor dear, can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it. She wants him herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the drop of the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s fan he restored his nippers. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t--not a bit--want HER!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is. She has put down her money, as it were, without a return.\r\nShe has given Mitchy up and got nothing instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was delicacy, yet there was distinctness, in Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreserve. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call ME nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess, at this, fairly swelled with her happy stare. \xe2\x80\x9cThen it IS\r\nan adoption?\xe2\x80\x9d She forbore to press, however; she only went on: \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na question, my dear man, of what _I_ call it. YOU don\xe2\x80\x99t make love to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would she have had?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat could be more charming, you mean, than your famous \xe2\x80\x98loyalty\xe2\x80\x99?\r\nOh, caro mio, she wants it straighter! But I shock you,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion\r\nquickly added.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which he firmly rose was scarce a denial; yet he stood for\r\na moment in place. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat after all can she do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can KEEP Mr. Van.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean till it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. She can work on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCovertly again the Duchess had followed the effect of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperceived movement on Mrs. Brook, who also got up. She gave a rap with\r\nher fan on his leg. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down--you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHe mechanically obeyed her although it happened to lend him the air of\r\ntaking Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s approach for a signal to resume his seat. She came\r\nover to them, Vanderbank followed, and it was without again moving, with\r\na vague upward gape in fact from his place, that Mr. Longdon received\r\nas she stood before him a challenge of a sort to flash a point into what\r\nthe Duchess had just said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you hate me so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, who, beside Mrs. Brook, looked at him with attention, might\r\nhave suspected him of turning a trifle pale; though even Vanderbank,\r\nwith reasons of his own for an observation of the sharpest, could scarce\r\nhave read into the matter the particular dim vision that would have\r\naccounted for it--the flicker of fear of what Mrs. Brook, whether as\r\ndaughter or as mother, was at last so strangely and differently to show\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should warn you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man threw off, \xe2\x80\x9chow little we\r\nconsider that--in Buckingham Crescent certainly--a fair question. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t playing the game--it\xe2\x80\x99s hitting below the belt. We hate and we\r\nlove--the latter especially; but to tell each other why is to break that\r\nlittle tacit rule of finding out for ourselves which is the delight of\r\nour lives and the source of our triumphs. You can say, you know, if you\r\nlike, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not obliged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon transferred to him something of the same colder\r\napprehension, looking at him manifestly harder than ever before and\r\nfinding in his eyes also no doubt a consciousness more charged. He\r\npresently got up, but, without answering Vanderbank, fixed again Mrs.\r\nBrook, to whom he echoed without expression: \xe2\x80\x9cHate you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next moment, while he remained in presence with Vanderbank, Mrs.\r\nBrook was pointing out her meaning to him from the cushioned corner he\r\nhad quitted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, when you come back to town you come straight, as it\r\nwere, here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh what\xe2\x80\x99s that,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess asked in his interest, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to follow\r\nNanda as closely as possible, or at any rate to keep well with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, however, had no ear for this plea. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I, coming here\r\ntoo and thinking only of my chance to \xe2\x80\x98meet\xe2\x80\x99 you, do my very sweetest to\r\ncatch your eye, you\xe2\x80\x99re entirely given up--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo trying of course,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess broke in afresh, \xe2\x80\x9cto keep well with\r\nME!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook now had a smile for her. \xe2\x80\x9cAh that takes precautions then that\r\nI shall perhaps fail of if I too much interrupt your conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she nice to me,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess asked of Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I was in\r\nthe very act of praising her to the skies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir interlocutor\xe2\x80\x99s reply was not too rapid to anticipate Mrs. Brook\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Jane, that only proves his having reached some\r\nextravagance in the other sense that you had in mere decency to\r\nmatch. The truth is probably in the \xe2\x80\x98mean\xe2\x80\x99--isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what they\r\ncall it?--between you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t YOU now take him away,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on to\r\nVanderbank, who had glanced about for some better accommodation.\r\n\r\nHe immediately pushed forward the nearest chair, which happened to be by\r\nthe Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s side of the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you sit here, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay to protect me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was really what I brought him over to you for,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook said\r\nwhile Mr. Longdon took his place and Vanderbank looked out for another\r\nseat. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed with her sweet free curiosity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat he called you \xe2\x80\x98sir.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d She often made discoveries that were fairly\r\nchildlike. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has done it twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that only your inevitable English surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess\r\ndemanded, \xe2\x80\x9cat the civility quite the commonest in other societies?--so\r\nthat one has to come here to find it regarded, in the way of ceremony,\r\nas the very end of the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a word I rather like myself even to\r\nemploy to others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always ask here,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess continued to him, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat word they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot instead. And do you know what they tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook wondered, then again, before he was ready, charmingly\r\nsuggested: \xe2\x80\x9cOur pretty manner?\xe2\x80\x9d Quickly too she appealed to Mr. Longdon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs THAT what you miss from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered, however, more than Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cYour \xe2\x80\x98pretty manner\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, these grand old forms that the Duchess is such a mistress of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mrs. Brook had with this one of her eagerest visions. \xe2\x80\x9cDid mamma say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98sir\xe2\x80\x99 to you? Ought _I_? Do you really get it, in private, out of Nanda?\r\nSHE has such depths of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained to the Duchess and to\r\nVanderbank, who had come back with his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xe2\x80\x99s just the kind\r\nof racy anecdote she never in the world gives me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon looked across at Van, placed now, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s talk\r\nwith Tishy in sight of them all, by Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s arm of the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t protected--you\xe2\x80\x99ve only exposed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh there\xe2\x80\x99s no joy without danger\xe2\x80\x9d--Mrs. Brook took it up with spirit.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps one should even say there\xe2\x80\x99s no danger without joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had followed Mrs. Grendon after his brief passage with\r\nher, terminated by some need of her listless presence on the other side\r\nof the room. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say then, on that theory, to the extraordinary\r\ngloom of our hostess? Her safety, by such a rule, must be deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was this time the first to know what they said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nexpression of Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s face comes precisely from our comparing it so\r\nunfavourably with that of her poor sister Carrie, who, though she isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhere to-night with the Cashmores--amazing enough even as coming WITHOUT\r\nthat!--has so often shown us that an ame en peine, constantly tottering,\r\nbut, as Nanda guarantees us, usually recovering, may look after all as\r\nbeatific as a Dutch doll.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had, on Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s passing away, taken the same course as\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s, whom she had visibly not neglected moreover while the pair\r\nstood there. \xe2\x80\x9cI give you Carrie, as you know, and I throw Mr. Cashmore\r\nin; but I\xe2\x80\x99m lost in admiration to-night, as I always have been, of\r\nthe way Tishy makes her ugliness serve. I should call it, if the word\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t so for ladies\xe2\x80\x99-maids, the most \xe2\x80\x98elegant\xe2\x80\x99 thing I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess objected, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you describe as making\r\nher ugliness serve is what I should describe as concealing none of her\r\nbeauty. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the matter surely with \xe2\x80\x98elegant\xe2\x80\x99 as applied\r\nto Tishy save that as commonly used it refers rather to a charm that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nartificial than to a state of pure nature. There should be for elegance\r\na basis of clothing. Nanda rather stints her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, perhaps more than usually thoughtful, just discriminated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere IS, I think, one little place. I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Tishy?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh THAT would do no good. To Nanda. All the same,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan awfully superficial thing of you not to see that her dreariness--on\r\nwhich moreover I\xe2\x80\x99ve set you right before--is a mere facial accident and\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t correspond or, as they say, \xe2\x80\x98rhyme\xe2\x80\x99 to anything within her that\r\nmight make it a little interesting. What I like it for is just that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso funny in itself. Her low spirits are nothing more than her features.\r\nHer gloom, as you call it, is merely her broken nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHAS she a broken nose?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon demanded with an accent that for\r\nsome reason touched in the others the spring of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Nanda never mentioned it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook profited by this gaiety to\r\nask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the discretion you just spoke of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\nI should have expected from the cause you refer to rather the comic\r\neffect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s broken nose, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank explained to Mr. Longdon,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis only the kinder way taken by these ladies to speak of Mrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbroken heart. You must know all about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--ALL.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon spoke very simply, with the consequence this\r\ntime, on the part of his companions, of a silence of some minutes, which\r\nhe himself had at last to break. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Grendon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like her.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\naddition of these words apparently made the difference--as if they\r\nconstituted a fresh link with the irresistible comedy of things. That\r\nhe was unexpectedly diverting was, however, no check to Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelivering his full thought. \xe2\x80\x9cVery horrid of two sisters to be both, in\r\ntheir marriages, so wretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but Tishy, I maintain,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook returned, \xe2\x80\x9cISN\xe2\x80\x99T wretched at all.\r\nIf I were satisfied that she\xe2\x80\x99s really so I\xe2\x80\x99d never let Nanda come to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the most extraordinary doctrine, love,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess interposed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied a woman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98really\xe2\x80\x99 poor you never give her a\r\ncrust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you call Nanda a crust, Duchess?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank amusedly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s all at any rate, apparently, just now, that poor Tishy has to\r\nlive on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re severe then,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man said, \xe2\x80\x9con our dinner of to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook declared, \xe2\x80\x9cis never severe: she\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nuncontrollably witty. It\xe2\x80\x99s only Tishy moreover who gives out that her\r\nhusband doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like her. HE, poor man, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything of the\r\nsort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but, after all, you know\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank just put it to her--\xe2\x80\x9cwhere\r\nthe deuce, all the while, IS he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we should too rashly\r\nascertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is--exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon subjoined.\r\n\r\nHe had once more his success of hilarity, though not indeed to the\r\ninjury of the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s next word. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Nanda, you know, who speaks,\r\nand loud enough, for Harry Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s dislikes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s easy for her,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook declared, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she herself isn\xe2\x80\x99t one\r\nof them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t surely one of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon gravely observed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook gazed across at him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE too dear! But I\xe2\x80\x99ve none the\r\nless a crow to pick with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon returned her look, but returned it somehow to Van. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nfrighten me, you know, out of my wits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be the sacred terror,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook suggested to Van, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nMitchy so often speaks of. I\xe2\x80\x99M not trying with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on to Mr.\r\nLongdon, \xe2\x80\x9cfor anything of that kind, but only for the short half-hour\r\nin private that I think you won\xe2\x80\x99t for the world grant me. Nothing will\r\ninduce you to find yourself alone with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy what on earth,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you suspect him of supposing\r\nyou want to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it isn\xe2\x80\x99t THAT,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook sadly said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t what?\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he fears I may want in any way to--what do you call it?--make up\r\nto him.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke as if she only wished it had been. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a deeper\r\nthought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then what in goodness is it?\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess pressed.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had said nothing more, but Mrs. Brook preferred none the\r\nless to treat the question as between themselves. She WAS, as the\r\nothers said, wonderful. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking me\xe2\x80\x9d--she spoke to him\r\nstraight--\xe2\x80\x9crather tortuous.\xe2\x80\x9d The pause she thus momentarily produced was\r\nso intense as to give a sharpness that was almost vulgar to the little\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d by which it was presently broken and the source of which neither\r\nof her three companions could afterwards in the least have named.\r\nNeither would have endeavoured to fix an infelicity of which each\r\ndoubtless had been but too capable. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only as a mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I want my chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Duchess was at this again in the breach. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it, for mercy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake then, my dear, over Harold, who\xe2\x80\x99s an example to Nanda herself\r\nin the way that, behind the piano there, he\xe2\x80\x99s keeping it up with Lady\r\nFanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf this had been a herring that, in the interest of peace, the Duchess\r\nhad wished to draw across the scent, it could scarce have been more\r\neffective. Mrs. Brook, whose position had made just the difference that\r\nshe lost the view of the other side of the piano, took a slight but\r\nimmediate stretch. \xe2\x80\x9cIS Harold with Lady Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask it, my dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cas if it were too\r\ngrand to be believed. It\xe2\x80\x99s the note of eagerness,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on for Mr.\r\nLongdon\xe2\x80\x99s benefit--\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s almost the note of hope: one of those that ces\r\nmessieurs, that we all in fact delight in and find so matchless. She\r\ndesires for Harold the highest advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Vanderbank, who had achieved a glimpse, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclearly having them. It brings home to one his success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis success is true,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cHow he does it I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh DON\xe2\x80\x99T you?\xe2\x80\x9d trumpeted the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s amazing,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cI watch--I hold my breath. But I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nbound to say also I rather admire. He somehow amuses them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s as pleased as Punch,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose great calm women--they like slighter creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great calm whales,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cswallow the little\r\nfishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook returned, \xe2\x80\x9cHarold can be tasted, if you like--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf _I_ like?\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess parenthetically jeered. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he can\xe2\x80\x99t, I think, be eaten. It all works out,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook\r\nexpounded, \xe2\x80\x9cto the highest end. If Lady Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s amused she\xe2\x80\x99ll be quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cof all the immoral speeches--! I put it\r\nto you, Longdon. Does she mean\xe2\x80\x9d--she appealed to their friend--\xe2\x80\x9cthat if\r\nshe commits murder she won\xe2\x80\x99t commit anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it won\xe2\x80\x99t be murder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean that if Harold, in one\r\nway and another, keeps her along, she won\xe2\x80\x99t get off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOff where?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon risked.\r\n\r\nVanderbank immediately informed him. \xe2\x80\x9cTo one of the smaller Italian\r\ntowns. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. Like--who is it? I forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenine? You know about Anna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNanda,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9chas told him. But I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on to\r\nMrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Lady Fanny, by this time, MUST have gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPetherton then,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook returned, \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep you au courant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess blandly wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cI seem to remember he had positively said\r\nso. And that she had come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause this looks so like a fresh start? No. WE know. You assume\r\nbesides,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Cashmore would have received her\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess fixed a little that gentleman and his actual companion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you have? He mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have noticed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99re out of step, Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe used all to march\r\nabreast, but we\xe2\x80\x99re falling to pieces. It\xe2\x80\x99s all, saving your presence,\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook concurred, \xe2\x80\x9chow thoroughly I feel that! Oh I knew. The\r\nspell\xe2\x80\x99s broken; the harp has lost a string. We\xe2\x80\x99re not the same thing.\r\nHE\xe2\x80\x99S not the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrankly, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that you\r\npersonally are either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh as for that--which is what matters least--we shall perhaps see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n With which Mrs. Brook turned again to Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t explained\r\nto you what I meant just now. We want Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon stared. \xe2\x80\x9cAt home again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn her little old nook. You must give her back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean altogether?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that will be for you in a manner to arrange. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve had her\r\npractically these five months, and with no desire to be unreasonable we\r\nyet have our natural feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis interchange, to which circumstances somehow gave a high effect of\r\nsuddenness and strangeness, was listened to by the others in a quick\r\nsilence that was like the sense of a blast of cold air, though with the\r\ndifference between the spectators that Vanderbank attached his eyes hard\r\nto Mrs. Brook and that the Duchess looked as straight at Mr. Longdon, to\r\nwhom clearly she wished to convey that if he had wondered a short time\r\nbefore how Mrs. Brook would do it he must now be quite at his ease. He\r\nindulged in fact, after this lady\xe2\x80\x99s last words, in a pause that might\r\nhave signified some of the fulness of a new light. He only said very\r\nquietly: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you liked it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this his neighbour broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cThe care you take of the child? They\r\nDO!\xe2\x80\x9d The Duchess, as she spoke, became aware of the nearer presence of\r\nEdward Brookenham, who within a minute had come in from the other room;\r\nand her decision of character leaped forth in her quick signal to him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdward will tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d He was already before their semicircle. \xe2\x80\x9cDO you,\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x9d she appealed, \xe2\x80\x9cwant Nanda back from Mr. Longdon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward plainly could be trusted to feel in his quiet way that the oracle\r\nmust be a match for the priestess. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Want\xe2\x80\x99 her, Jane? We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t TAKE\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d And as if knowing quite what he was about he looked at his wife\r\nonly after he had spoken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nHis reply had complete success, to which there could scarce have\r\nafterwards been a positive denial that some sound of amusement even from\r\nMr. Longdon himself had in its degree contributed. Certain it was\r\nthat Mrs. Brook found, as she exclaimed that her husband was always so\r\nawfully civil, just the right note of resigned understanding; whereupon\r\nhe for a minute presented to them blankly enough his fine dead face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Civil\xe2\x80\x99 is just what I was afraid I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. I mean, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued to Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you really mustn\xe2\x80\x99t look to us to let you\r\noff--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom a week or a day\xe2\x80\x9d--Mr. Longdon took him up--\xe2\x80\x9cof the time to which\r\nyou consider I\xe2\x80\x99ve pledged myself? My dear sir, please don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor ME the Duchess appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s from your wife, you delicious dull man,\xe2\x80\x9d that lady elucidated. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou wished to be stiff with our friend here you\xe2\x80\x99ve really been so with\r\nHER; which comes, no doubt, from the absence between you of proper\r\npreconcerted action. You spoke without your cue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Edward Brookenham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, Jane\xe2\x80\x9d--Mrs. Brook continued to take it beautifully. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\ndressed to-day in a hurry and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time for our usual rehearsal.\r\nEdward, when we dine out, generally brings three pocket-handkerchiefs\r\nand six jokes. I leave the management of the handkerchiefs to his own\r\ntaste, but we mostly try together in advance to arrange a career for the\r\nother things. It\xe2\x80\x99s some charming light thing of my own that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed\r\nto give him the sign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly sometimes he confounds\xe2\x80\x9d--Vanderbank helped her out--\xe2\x80\x9cyour light\r\nand your heavy!\xe2\x80\x9d He had got up to make room for his host of so many\r\noccasions and, having forced him into the empty chair, now moved vaguely\r\noff to the quarter of the room occupied by Nanda and Mr. Cashmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very well,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t at all clear\r\nyou, cara mia, of the misdemeanour of setting up as a felt domestic\r\nneed something of which Edward proves deeply unconscious. He has put his\r\nfinger on Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s true interest. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit how it would LOOK\r\nfor you to want her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you mean rather, Jane, how it looks for us NOT to want her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mrs. Brook amended with a detachment now complete. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, dear old\r\nfriend,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued to Mr. Longdon, \xe2\x80\x9cshe quite puts me with my back\r\nto the wall when she helps you to see--what you otherwise mightn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nguess--that Edward and I work it out between us to show off as tender\r\nparents and yet to get from you everything you\xe2\x80\x99ll give. I do the\r\nsentimental and he the practical; so that we, after one fashion and\r\nanother, deck ourselves in the glory of our sacrifice without forfeiting\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98keep\xe2\x80\x99 of our daughter. This must appeal to you as another useful\r\nillustration of what London manners have come to; unless indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBrook prattled on, \xe2\x80\x9cit only strikes you still more--and to a degree that\r\nblinds you to its other possible bearings--as the last proof that I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntoo tortuous for you to know what I\xe2\x80\x99d be at!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon faced her, across his interval, with his original terror\r\nrepresented now only by such a lingering flush as might have formed a\r\nnatural tribute to a brilliant scene. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the glimmering of an\r\nidea of what you\xe2\x80\x99d be at. But please understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t at all refuse you the private half-hour you referred to a while\r\nsince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really willing to put the child up for the rest of the year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Edward placidly demanded, speaking as if quite unaware that anything\r\nelse had taken place.\r\n\r\nHis wife fixed her eyes on him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ingenuity of your companions, love,\r\nplays in the air like the lightning, but flashes round your head only,\r\nby good fortune, to leave it unscathed. Still, you have after all your\r\nown strange wit, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that any of ours ever compares with\r\nit. Only, confronted also with ours, how can poor Mr. Longdon really\r\nchoose which of the two he\xe2\x80\x99ll meet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Longdon now looked hard at Edward. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Mr. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s, I\r\nfeel, any day. It\xe2\x80\x99s even with YOU, I confess,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather have that private half-hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send him to you. But we HAVE, you\r\nknow, as Van says, gone to pieces,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, twisting her pretty\r\nhead and tossing it back over her shoulder to an auditor of whose\r\napproach to her from behind, though it was impossible she should have\r\nseen him, she had visibly within a minute become aware. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nmarriage, Mitchy, that has darkened our old bright air, changed us\r\nmore than we even yet know, and most grossly and horribly, my dear man,\r\nchanged YOU. You steal up in a way that gives one the creeps, whereas\r\nin the good time that\xe2\x80\x99s gone you always burst in with music and song.\r\nGo round where I can see you: I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t love you now, but at least, I\r\nsuppose, I may look at you. Direct your energies,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued while\r\nMitchy obeyed her, \xe2\x80\x9cas much as possible, please, against our uncanny\r\nchill. Pile on the fire and close up the ranks; this WAS our best hour,\r\nyou know--and all the more that Tishy, I see, is getting rid of her\r\nsuperfluities. Here comes back old Van,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cvanquished, I\r\njudge, in the attempt to divert Nanda from her prey. Won\xe2\x80\x99t Nanda sit\r\nwith poor US?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked of Vanderbank, who now, meeting Mitchy in range\r\nof the others, remained standing with him and as at her commands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t of course ask her,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only took a little walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, on this, was woeful at Mitchy. \xe2\x80\x9cSee then what we\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nto. When did we ever \xe2\x80\x98walk\xe2\x80\x99 in YOUR time save as a distinct part of\r\nthe effect of our good things? Please return to Nanda,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to\r\nVanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell her I particularly wish her to come in for this\r\ndelightful evening\xe2\x80\x99s end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s joining us of herself now,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess noted, \xe2\x80\x9cand so\xe2\x80\x99s Mr.\r\nCashmore and so\xe2\x80\x99s Tishy--VOYEZ!--who has kept on--(bless her little bare\r\nback!)--no one she oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to keep. As nobody else will now arrive it\r\nwould be quite cosey if she locked the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what on earth, my dear Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook plaintively wondered, \xe2\x80\x9care\r\nyou proposing we should do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, in her apprehension, had looked expressively at their\r\nfriends, but the eye of the Duchess wandered no further than Harold and\r\nLady Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would perhaps serve to keep that pair a little longer\r\nfrom escaping together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook took a pause no greater. \xe2\x80\x9cBut wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be, as regards\r\nanother pair, locking the stable-door after--what do you call it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nPetherton and Aggie appear already to have escaped together? Mitchy,\r\nman, where in the world\xe2\x80\x99s your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite grant you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my niece is wherever\r\nPetherton is. This I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of, for THERE\xe2\x80\x99S a friendship, if you please,\r\nthat has not been interrupted. Petherton\xe2\x80\x99s not gone, is he?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nin her turn of Mitchy.\r\n\r\nBut again before he could speak it was taken up. \xe2\x80\x9cMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s silent,\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s altered, Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s queer!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook proclaimed, while the new\r\nrecruits to the circle, Tishy and Nanda and Mr. Cashmore, Lady Fanny and\r\nHarold too after a minute and on perceiving the movement of the others,\r\nended by enlarging it, with mutual accommodation and aid, to a pleasant\r\ntalkative ring in which the subject of their companion\xe2\x80\x99s demonstration,\r\non a low ottoman and glaring in his odd way in almost all directions at\r\nonce, formed the conspicuous attractive centre. Tishy was nearest\r\nMr. Longdon, and Nanda, still flanked by Mr. Cashmore, between that\r\ngentleman and his wife, who had Harold on her other side. Edward\r\nBrookenham was neighboured by his son and by Vanderbank, who might\r\neasily have felt himself, in spite of their separation and given, as it\r\nhappened, their places in the group, rather publicly confronted with Mr.\r\nLongdon. \xe2\x80\x9cIs his wife in the other room?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook now put to Tishy.\r\n\r\nTishy, after a stare about, recovered the acuter consciousness to\r\naccount for this guest. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--she\xe2\x80\x99s playing with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with whom, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, with Petherton. I thought you knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnew they\xe2\x80\x99re playing---?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook was almost Socratic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Missus is regularly wound up,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband meanwhile, without\r\nresonance, observed to Vanderbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrilliant indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s rather naughty, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Edward after a pause continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh fiendish!\xe2\x80\x9d his interlocutor said with a short smothered laugh that\r\nmight have represented for a spectator a sudden start at such a flash of\r\nanalysis from such a quarter.\r\n\r\nWhen Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s attention at any rate was free again their hostess,\r\nassisted to the transition, was describing the play, as she had called\r\nit, of the absentees. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has hidden a book and he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to find\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHide and seek? Why, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it innocent, Mitch!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMitchy, speaking for the first time, faced her with extravagant gloom.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s HER innocence!\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess laughed to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose he has found it YET?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook pursued\r\nearnestly to Tishy. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it something we might ALL play at if--?\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nwhich however, abruptly checking herself, she changed her note. \xe2\x80\x9cNanda\r\nlove, please go and invite them to join us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, at this, on his ottoman, wheeled straight round to the girl, who\r\nlooked at him before speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go if Mitchy tells me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he does fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there may be something in\r\nit--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy jerked back to Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give\r\nway to my fear. Suppose there SHOULD be something! Let me not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dealt with him tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t--so soon--bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but, savez-vous,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess interposed with some majesty, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhorrid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want at all events a\r\ngeneral romp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I thought just that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cwas what the Duchess wished\r\nthe door locked for! Perhaps moreover\xe2\x80\x9d--she returned to Tishy--\xe2\x80\x9che\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet found the book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Tishy said with simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why in the world--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see she\xe2\x80\x99s sitting on it\xe2\x80\x9d--Tishy felt, it was plain, the\r\nresponsibility of explanation. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that unless he pulls her off--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t compass his desperate end? Ah I hope he won\xe2\x80\x99t pull her off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mrs. Brook wonderfully murmured. It was said in a manner that stirred\r\nthe circle, and unanimous laughter seemed already to have crowned her\r\ninvocation, lately uttered, to the social spirit. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what in the\r\nworld,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cis the book selected for such a position? I hope\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not a very big one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh aren\xe2\x80\x99t the books that are sat upon,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cashmore freely speculated,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of course the bad ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit as a matter of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Harold as freely replied to him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey sit, all round, nowadays--I mean in the papers and places--on some\r\nawfully good stuff. Why I myself read books that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t--upon my\r\nhonour I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t risk it!--read out to you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d his father dropped with the special shade of dryness\r\nthat was all Edward\xe2\x80\x99s own, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a pity you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got one of your\r\nfavourites to try on us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarold looked about as if it might have been after all a happy thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s the only girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd one\xe2\x80\x99s sister doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just because the thing\xe2\x80\x99s bad,\xe2\x80\x9d Tishy resumed for Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\nparticular benefit, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Lord Petherton\xe2\x80\x99s trying to wrest it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s pale interest deepened. \xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s a real hand-to-hand\r\nstruggle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says she shan\xe2\x80\x99t read it--she says she will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s because--isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook appealed--\xe2\x80\x9che so long\r\noverlooked and advised her in those matters. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he feel by this\r\ntime--so awfully clever as he is--the extraordinary way she has come\r\nout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98By this time\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Harold echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cDearest mummy, you\xe2\x80\x99re too sweet. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly about ten weeks--isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Mitch? You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying that, I\r\nhope,\xe2\x80\x9d he solicitously added.\r\n\r\nMitchy had his back to him and, bending it a little, sat with head\r\ndropped and knees pressing his hands together. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind any one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaying anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, are you already past that?\xe2\x80\x9d Harold sociably laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe used to vibrate to everything. My dear man, what IS the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mrs. Brook demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it all move too fast for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on us, what ARE you talking about? That\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ want to know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mr. Cashmore vivaciously declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she HAS gone at a pace--if Mitchy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Harold\r\ninterposed in the tone of tact and taste. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then don\xe2\x80\x99t they always--I\r\nmean when they\xe2\x80\x99re like Aggie and they once get loose--go at a pace?\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ want to know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose mother did, nor Tishy, nor\r\nthe Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d he communicated to the rest; \xe2\x80\x9cbut mother and Tishy and the\r\nDuchess, it strikes me, must either have been of the school that knew,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you know? a deuce of a deal before, or of the type that takes it\r\nall more quietly after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think a woman can only speak for herself. I took it all quietly\r\nenough both before and after,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook. Then she addressed to\r\nMr. Cashmore with a small formal nod one of her lovely wan smiles. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, s\xe2\x80\x99il vous plait, is marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you know,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess broke out on this, \xe2\x80\x9chow silly you\r\nall sound! When did it ever, in any society that could call itself\r\ndecently \xe2\x80\x98good,\xe2\x80\x99 NOT make a difference that an innocent young creature,\r\na flower tended and guarded, should find from one day to the other her\r\nwhole consciousness changed? People pull long faces and look wonderful\r\nlooks and punch each other, in your English fashion, in the sides, and\r\nsay to each other in corners that my poor darling has \xe2\x80\x98come out.\xe2\x80\x99 Je\r\ncrois bien, she has come out! I married her--I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind saying it\r\nnow--exactly that she SHOULD come out, and I should be mightily ashamed\r\nof every one concerned if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t marry her, I give you to\r\nbelieve, that she should stay \xe2\x80\x98in,\xe2\x80\x99 and if any of you think to frighten\r\nMitchy with it I imagine you\xe2\x80\x99ll do so as little as you frighten ME. If\r\nit has taken her a very short time--as Harold so vividly puts it--to\r\nwhich of you did I ever pretend, I should like to know, that it would\r\ntake her a very long one? I dare say there are girls it would have taken\r\nlonger, just as there are certainly others who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have required so\r\nmuch as an hour. It surely isn\xe2\x80\x99t news to you that if some young persons\r\namong us all are very stupid and others very wise, MY dear child\r\nwas never either, but only perfectly bred and deliciously clever. Ah\r\nTHAT--rather! If she\xe2\x80\x99s so clever that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with her\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s scarcely HER fault. But add to it that Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s very kind, and you\r\nhave the whole thing. What more do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, who looked immensely struck, replied with the promptest\r\nsympathy, yet as if there might have been an alternative. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x9d--and her eyes appealed to the others--\xe2\x80\x9cthat we want ANY more, do\r\nwe? than the whole thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious, I should hope not!\xe2\x80\x9d her husband remarked as privately as\r\nbefore to Vanderbank. \xe2\x80\x9cJane--for a mixed company--does go into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, for a minute and with a special short arrest, took in the\r\ncircle. \xe2\x80\x9cShould you call us \xe2\x80\x98mixed\xe2\x80\x99? There\xe2\x80\x99s only ONE girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward Brookenham glanced at his daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I wish there were\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDO you?\xe2\x80\x9d And Vanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s laugh at this odd view covered, for a little,\r\nthe rest of the talk. But when he again began to follow no victory had\r\nyet been snatched.\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Brook naturally who rattled the standard. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you say,\r\ndearest, that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99 with Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s cleverness, do you\r\nquite allow for the way we bow down before it and worship it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquite see what else we--in here--can do with it, even though we HAVE\r\ngathered that, just over there, Petherton\xe2\x80\x99s finding for it a different\r\napplication. We can only each in our way do our best. Don\xe2\x80\x99t therefore\r\nsuccumb, Jane, to the delusive harm of a grievance. There would be\r\nnothing in it. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t got one. The beauty of the life that so many\r\nof us have so long led together\xe2\x80\x9d--and she showed that it was for Mr.\r\nLongdon she more particularly brought this out--\xe2\x80\x9cis precisely that\r\nnobody has ever had one. Nobody has dreamed of it--it would have been\r\nsuch a rough false note, a note of violence out of all keeping. Did\r\nYOU ever hear of one, Van? Did you, my poor Mitchy? But you see for\r\nyourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound up with a sigh and before either could answer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow inferior we\xe2\x80\x99ve become when we have even in our defence to assert\r\nsuch things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, who for a while past had sat gazing at the floor, now raised his\r\ngood natural goggles and stretched his closed mouth to its widest. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I\r\nthink we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty good still!\xe2\x80\x9d he then replied.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook indeed appeared, after a pause and addressing herself again\r\nto Tishy, to give a reluctant illustration of it, coming back as from\r\nan excursion of the shortest to the question momentarily dropped. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nbound to say--all the more you know--that I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see what Aggie\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t now read.\xe2\x80\x9d Suddenly, however, her look at their informant took on\r\nan anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the book you speak of something VERY awful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grendon, with so much these past minutes to have made her so, was\r\nat last visibly more present. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Lord Petherton says of it.\r\nFrom what he knows of the author.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that he wants to keep her--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, from trying it first. I think he wants to see if it\xe2\x80\x99s good for\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most charming soins, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duchess said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat a gentleman may render a young woman to whom he desires to be\r\nuseful. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say that Petherton always knows how good a book may be,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99d trust him any day to say how bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, who had sat throughout silent and still, quitted his seat\r\nat this and evidently in so doing gave Mrs. Brook as much occasion as\r\nshe required. She also got up and her movement brought to her view\r\nat the door of the further room something that drew from her a quick\r\nexclamation. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can tell us now then--for here they come!\xe2\x80\x9d Lord\r\nPetherton, arriving with animation and followed so swiftly by his young\r\ncompanion that she presented herself as pursuing him, shook triumphantly\r\nover his head a small volume in blue paper. There was a general movement\r\nat the sight of them, and by the time they had rejoined their friends\r\nthe company, pushing back seats and causing a variety of mute expression\r\nsmoothly to circulate, was pretty well on its feet. \xe2\x80\x9cSee--he HAS pulled\r\nher off!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Aggie, to whom plenty of pearls were\r\nsingularly becoming, met it as pleasant sympathy. Yes, and it was a REAL\r\npull. But of course,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued with the prettiest humour and as if\r\nMrs. Brook would quite understand, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the moment one has a person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnails, and almost his teeth, in one\xe2\x80\x99s flesh--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy passed, however, with no great ease from Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npearls to her other charms; fixing the former indeed so markedly that\r\nHarold had a quick word about it for Lady Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen poor mummy\r\nthinks, you know, that Nanda might have had them--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s attention, for that matter, had resisted them as little.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I dare say that if I had wanted _I_ might!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord--COULD you have stood him?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man returned. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nbelieve women can stand anything!\xe2\x80\x9d he profoundly concluded. His mother\r\nmeanwhile, recovering herself, had begun to ejaculate on the prints\r\nin Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and he was then diverted from the sense of what he\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpersonally,\xe2\x80\x9d as he would have said, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stood, by a glance at\r\nLord Petherton\xe2\x80\x99s trophy, for which he made a prompt grab. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bone of\r\ncontention?\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Petherton had let it go and Harold remained arrested\r\nby the cover. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy blest if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Van\xe2\x80\x99s name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVan\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d--his mother was near enough to effect her own snatch, after\r\nwhich she swiftly faced the proprietor of the volume. \xe2\x80\x9cDear man, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe last thing you lent me! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning to\r\nTishy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I ever passed such a production on to YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just seeing Mr. Van\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\xe2\x80\x9d Aggie conscientiously explained,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat made me think one was free--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Van\xe2\x80\x99s hand!\xe2\x80\x9d--Mrs. Brook quite smiled at the error.\r\nShe thrust the book straight at Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cIS that Mr. Van\xe2\x80\x99s hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolding the disputed object, which he had put on his nippers to glance\r\nat, he presently, without speaking, looked over these aids straight at\r\nNanda, who looked as straight back at him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was I who wrote Mr. Van\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d The girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were on Mr. Longdon, but her words as for the\r\ncompany. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought the book here from Buckingham Crescent and left it\r\nby accident in the other room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy accident, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI do quite hope. But what\r\non earth did you bring it for? It\xe2\x80\x99s too hideous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda seemed to wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you haven\xe2\x80\x99t read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cOne hardly knows now, I think, what is and what\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe brought it only for ME to read,\xe2\x80\x9d Tishy gravely interposed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook looked strange. \xe2\x80\x9cNanda RECOMMENDED it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no--the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d Tishy, as if scared by so much publicity,\r\nfloundered a little. \xe2\x80\x9cShe only told me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe awful subject?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook wailed.\r\n\r\nThere was so deepening an echo of the drollery of this last passage\r\nthat it was a minute before Vanderbank could be heard saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nresponsibility\xe2\x80\x99s wholly mine for setting the beastly thing in motion.\r\nStill,\xe2\x80\x9d he added good-humouredly and as to minimise if not the cause at\r\nleast the consequence, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I agree with Nanda that it\xe2\x80\x99s no worse\r\nthan anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had recovered the volume from Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s relaxed hand and\r\nnow, without another glance at it, held it behind her with an unusual\r\nair of firmness. \xe2\x80\x9cOh how can you say that, my dear man, of anything so\r\nrevolting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe discussion kept them for the instant well face to face. \xe2\x80\x9cThen did\r\nYOU read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe debated, jerking the book into the nearest empty chair, where Mr.\r\nCashmore quickly pounced on it. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it for that you brought it me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she demanded. Yet before he could answer she again challenged her child.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you read this work, Nanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I say!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Cashmore, hilarious and turning the leaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had by this time ceremoniously approached Tishy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK NINTH. VANDERBANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better wait,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook said, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I see if he has\r\ngone;\xe2\x80\x9d and on the arrival the next moment of the servants with the\r\ntea she was able to put her question. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Cashmore still with Miss\r\nBrookenham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d the footman replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI let Mr. Cashmore out five minutes\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank showed for the next short time by his behaviour what he felt\r\nat not yet being free to act on this; moving pointlessly about the room\r\nwhile the servants arranged the tea-table and taking no trouble to make,\r\nfor appearance, any other talk. Mrs. Brook, on her side, took so little\r\nthat the silence--which their temporary companions had all the effect of\r\nkeeping up by conscious dawdling--became precisely one of those precious\r\nlights for the circle belowstairs which people fondly fancy they have\r\nnot kindled when they have not spoken. But Vanderbank spoke again as\r\nsoon as the door was closed. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he run in and out that way without\r\neven speaking to YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook turned away from the fire that, late in May, was the only\r\ncharm of the crude cold afternoon. \xe2\x80\x9cOne would like to draw the curtains,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one? and gossip in the glow of the hearth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x98gossip\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank wearily said as he came to her pretty table.\r\n\r\nIn the act of serving him she checked herself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rather have\r\nit with HER?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe balanced a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes she have a tea of her own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you don\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d--Mrs. Brook asked it with surprise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch ignorance of what I do for her does tell, I think, the tale of how\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve lately treated us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn not coming for so long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor more weeks, for more months than I can count. Scarcely since--when\r\nwas it?--the end of January, that night of Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that awful night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwful, you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the time without you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook returned, \xe2\x80\x9chas been so bad\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost the impression of anything before.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she\r\noffered the tea to his choice. \xe2\x80\x9cWILL you have it upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe received the cup. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and here too.\xe2\x80\x9d After which he said nothing\r\nagain till, first pouring in milk to cool it, he had drunk his tea down.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not literally true, you know. I HAVE been in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but always with other people--you managed it somehow; the wrong\r\nones. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t counted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh in one way and another I think everything counts. And you forget\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve dined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--for once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe once you asked me. So don\xe2\x80\x99t spoil the beauty of your own behaviour\r\nby mistimed reflexions. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been, as usual, superior.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but there has been no beauty in it. There has been nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBrook went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbut bare bleak recognition, the curse of my hideous\r\nintelligence. We\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen to pieces, and at least I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a fool\r\nas not to have felt it in time. From the moment one did feel it why\r\nshould one insist on vain forms? If YOU felt it, and were so ready\r\nto drop them, my part was what it has always been--to accept the\r\ninevitable. We shall never grow together again. The smash was too\r\ngreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank for a little said nothing; then at last: \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to know\r\nhow great!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever had happened her lovely look here survived it. \xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe smash,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwas indeed as complete, I think, as your\r\nintention. Each of the \xe2\x80\x98pieces\xe2\x80\x99 testifies to your success. Five minutes\r\ndid it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe appeared to wonder where he was going. \xe2\x80\x9cBut surely not MY minutes.\r\nWhere have you discovered that I made Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s marriage has nothing to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d She had the old interest at least still at their service.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think we might have survived that.\xe2\x80\x9d A new thought of it seemed to\r\nglimmer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s marriage promises elements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did it that night at Mrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke as if he had not\r\nheard her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a wonderful performance. You pulled us down--just\r\nclosing with each of the great columns in its turn--as Samson pulled\r\ndown the temple. I was at the time more or less bruised and buried\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the agitation and confusion fully understand what had\r\nhappened. But I understand now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very sure?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook earnestly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m stupid compared with you, but you see I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken my time.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve puzzled it out. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lain awake on it: all the more that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nto do it all myself--with the Mitchys in Italy and Greece. I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed\r\nhis aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have it now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook kindly said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re coming back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when do they arrive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny day, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he written you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook--\xe2\x80\x9cthere it is. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen to\r\npieces. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll of course have heard something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then it\xe2\x80\x99s complete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank thought a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite, is it?--I mean it won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\naltogether unless he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t written to Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen HAS he?\xe2\x80\x9d--she was keen again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming. Don\xe2\x80\x99t YOU know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis too he turned over. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as a consequence of your having, at\r\nTishy\xe2\x80\x99s, so abruptly and wonderfully tackled the question that a few\r\ndays later, as I afterwards gathered, was to be crowned with a measure\r\nof success not yet exhausted. Why, in other words--if it was to know\r\nso little about her and to get no nearer to her--did you bring about\r\nNanda\xe2\x80\x99s return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a clear reason, her face said, if she could only remember it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did I--?\xe2\x80\x9d Then as catching a light: \xe2\x80\x9cFancy your asking me--at this\r\ntime of day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you HAVE noticed that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked before? However,\xe2\x80\x9d Van promptly\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cI know well enough what you notice. Nanda hasn\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned to\r\nyou whether or no she has heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely not. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose, I take it, that it was to pry\r\ninto her affairs I called her in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, on this, lighted for the first time with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Called\r\nher in\xe2\x80\x99? How I like your expressions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do then, in spite of all,\xe2\x80\x9d she eagerly asked, \xe2\x80\x9cremind you a little of\r\nthe bon temps? Ah,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything good now. But of\r\ncourse I see Jane--though not so often either. It\xe2\x80\x99s from Jane I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\r\nof what she calls her \xe2\x80\x98young things.\xe2\x80\x99 It seems so odd to think of Mitchy\r\nas a young thing. He\xe2\x80\x99s as old as all time, and his wife, who the other\r\nday was about six, is now practically about forty. And I also saw\r\nPetherton,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook added, \xe2\x80\x9con his return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis return from where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy he was with them at Corfu, Malta, Cyprus--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where;\r\nyachting, spending Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s money, \xe2\x80\x98larking,\xe2\x80\x99 he called it--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat. He was with them for weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill Jane, you mean, called him in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it must have been that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van, \xe2\x80\x9cthan if Mitchy had had to call him\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Mitchy--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook comprehensively sounded.\r\n\r\nHer visitor quite assented. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he amazing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnique.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a short pause. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s she up to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was apparently for Mrs. Brook a question of such variety of\r\napplication that she brought out experimentally: \xe2\x80\x9cJane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear no. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve fathomed \xe2\x80\x98Jane,\xe2\x80\x99 haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d mused Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m by no means sure I have. Just of late\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a new sense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of what now?\xe2\x80\x9d Van amusedly put it as she held the note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh of depths below depths. But poor Jane--of course after all she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhuman. She\xe2\x80\x99s beside herself with one thing and another, but she can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nin any consistency show it. She took her stand so on having with\r\nPetherton\xe2\x80\x99s aid formed Aggie for a femme charmante--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it\xe2\x80\x99s too late to cry out that Petherton\xe2\x80\x99s aid can now be dispensed\r\nwith? Do you mean then that he IS such a brute that after all Mitchy\r\nhas done for him--?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank, at the rising image, pulled up in easy\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think him quite capable of considering with a magnificent insolence\r\nof selfishness that what Mitchy has MOST done will have been to make\r\nAggie accessible in a way that--for decency and delicacy of course,\r\nthings on which Petherton highly prides himself--she could naturally not\r\nbe as a girl. Her marriage has simplified it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank took it all in. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Accessible\xe2\x80\x99 is good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen--which was what I intended just now--Aggie has already become\r\nso--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, however, could as yet in fairness only wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m dying to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion smiled at it. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Even in our ashes live their wonted\r\nfires\xe2\x80\x99! But what do you make, in such a box, of poor Mitchy himself? His\r\nmarriage can scarcely to such an extent have simplified HIM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was something, none the less, that Mrs. Brook had to weigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. I give it up. The thing was of a strangeness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friend also paused, and it was as if for a little, on either side of\r\na gate on which they might have had their elbows, they remained looking\r\nat each other over it and over what was unsaid between them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt WAS\r\n\xe2\x80\x98rum\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d he at last merely dropped.\r\n\r\nIt was scarce for Mrs. Brook, all the same--she seemed to feel after a\r\nmoment--to surround the matter with an excess of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did what a man does--especially in that business--when he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nwhat he wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean what somebody else wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what he himself DIDN\xe2\x80\x99T. And if he\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nknow whom to pitch into.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if he is he won\xe2\x80\x99t be the man to what you\r\nmight call \xe2\x80\x98vent\xe2\x80\x99 it on her. He\xe2\x80\x99ll seek compensations elsewhere and\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t mind any ridicule--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom are you speaking of as \xe2\x80\x98her\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook asked as on feeling\r\nthat something in her face had made him stop. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t referring,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexplained, \xe2\x80\x9cto his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAggie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou meant the Duchess?\xe2\x80\x9d he then threw off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly!\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cHe MAY not become unhappy--God grant\r\nNOT!\xe2\x80\x9d she developed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if he does he\xe2\x80\x99ll take it out of Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan appeared to challenge this. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Take it out\xe2\x80\x99 of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, want to know, as some American asked me the other day of\r\nsomebody, what she\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98going to do\xe2\x80\x99 about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, who had remained on his feet, stood still at this for a\r\nlonger time than at anything yet. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what CAN she \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s again just what I\xe2\x80\x99m curious to see.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook then spoke with\r\na glance at the clock. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go up to her--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy notion of seeing her alone may be defeated by her coming down on\r\nlearning that I\xe2\x80\x99m here?\xe2\x80\x9d He had taken out his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go in a\r\nmoment. But, as a light on that danger, would YOU, in the circumstances,\r\ncome down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, however, could for light only look darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlove ME!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, still with his watch, stared then as an alternative at the\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet told me you know, if Mr. Cashmore now comes EVERY\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man, how can I say? You\xe2\x80\x99ve just your occasion to find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom HER, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless you prefer the footman. Must I again\r\nremind you that, with her own sitting-room and one of the men, in\r\naddition to her maid, wholly at her orders, her independence is ideal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, who appeared to have been timing himself, put up his watch.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say then that with separations so established I understand\r\nless than ever your unforgettable explosion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you come back to that?\xe2\x80\x9d she wearily asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you find it, with\r\nall you\xe2\x80\x99ve to think about, unforgettable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but there was a wild light in your eye--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see it now quite gone out.\xe2\x80\x9d She had\r\nspoken more sadly than sharply, but her impatience had the next moment a\r\nflicker. \xe2\x80\x9cI called Nanda in because I wanted to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely; but what I don\xe2\x80\x99t make out, you see, is what you\xe2\x80\x99ve since\r\ngained by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean she only hates me the more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan\xe2\x80\x99s impatience, in the movement with which he turned from her, had a\r\nflare still sharper. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I\xe2\x80\x99m incapable of meaning anything of the\r\nsort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a minute while his back was presented. \xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think in\r\neffect that you\xe2\x80\x99re incapable of anything straightforward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank\xe2\x80\x99s movement had not been to the door, but he almost reached it\r\nafter giving her, on this, a hard look. He then stopped short, however,\r\nto stare an instant still more fixedly into the hat he held in his hand;\r\nthe consequence of which in turn was that he the next minute stood again\r\nbefore her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you call it straightforward of me just not to\r\nhave come for so long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had again to take time to say. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that an allusion to what--by the\r\nloss of your beautiful presence--I\xe2\x80\x99ve failed to \xe2\x80\x98gain\xe2\x80\x99? I dare say at\r\nany rate\xe2\x80\x9d--she gave him no time to reply--\xe2\x80\x9cthat you feel you\xe2\x80\x99re quite as\r\nstraightforward as I and that we\xe2\x80\x99re neither of us creatures of mere rash\r\nimpulse. There was a time in fact, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there? when we rather enjoyed\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s dim depths. If I wanted to fawn on you,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmight say that, with such a comrade in obliquity to wind and double\r\nabout with, I\xe2\x80\x99d risk losing myself in the mine. But why retort or\r\nrecriminate? Let us not, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, be vulgar--we haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet, bad\r\nas it is, come to THAT. I CAN be, no doubt--I some day MUST be: I feel\r\nit looming at me out of the awful future as an inevitable fate. But let\r\nit be for when I\xe2\x80\x99m old and horrible; not an hour before. I do want to\r\nlive a little even yet. So you ought to let me off easily--even as I let\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vanderbank handsomely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there are things you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t put to me! You show a tact!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is. And I like much better,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook went on, \xe2\x80\x9cour speaking\r\nof it as delicacy than as duplicity. If you understand, it\xe2\x80\x99s so much\r\nsaved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I always understand more than anything else,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cis the\r\ngeneral truth that you\xe2\x80\x99re prodigious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps a little as relapse from tension that she had nothing\r\nagainst that. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for instance when it WOULD be so easy--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to take up what lies there, you yet so splendidly abstain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou literally press upon me my opportunity? It\xe2\x80\x99s YOU who are splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she rather strangely laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you at least want to say,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with a slight flush, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nyou MOST obviously and naturally might?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAppealed to on the question of underlying desire, Mrs. Brook went\r\nthrough the decent form of appearing to try to give it the benefit of\r\nany doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I want, you mean, to find out before you go up what\r\nYOU want? Shall you be too disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cif I say that,\r\nsince I shall probably learn, as we used to be told as children, \xe2\x80\x98all in\r\ngood time,\xe2\x80\x99 I can wait till the light comes out of itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank still lingered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE deep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve only to be deeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid at any rate you won\xe2\x80\x99t think I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npursued after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cif I ask you what in the world--since Harold\r\ndoes keep Lady Fanny so quiet--Cashmore still requires Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s direction\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh find out!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs. Donner quite shelved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind out,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nVanderbank had reached the door and had his hand on the latch, but there\r\nwas still something else. \xe2\x80\x9cYou scarce suppose, I imagine, that she has\r\ncome to like him \xe2\x80\x98for himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind out!\xe2\x80\x9d And Mrs. Brook, who was now on her feet, turned away. He\r\nwatched her a moment more, then checked himself and left her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nShe remained alone ten minutes, at the end of which her reflexions\r\nwould have been seen to be deep--were interrupted by the entrance of her\r\nhusband. The interruption was indeed not so great as if the couple had\r\nnot met, as they almost invariably met, in silence: she took at all\r\nevents, to begin with, no more account of his presence than to hand him\r\na cup of tea accompanied with nothing but cream and sugar. Her having\r\nno word for him, however, committed her no more to implying that he had\r\ncome in only for his refreshment than it would have committed her to\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, Edward dear--just as you like it; so take it and sit\r\ndown and be quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d No spectator worth his salt could have seen them\r\nmore than a little together without feeling how everything that,\r\nunder his eyes or not, she either did or omitted, rested on a profound\r\nacquaintance with his ways. They formed, Edward\xe2\x80\x99s ways, a chapter by\r\nthemselves, of which Mrs. Brook was completely mistress and in respect\r\nto which the only drawback was that a part of her credit was by the\r\nnature of the case predestined to remain obscure. So many of them were\r\nso queer that no one but she COULD know them, and know thereby into what\r\ncrannies her reckoning had to penetrate. It was one of them for instance\r\nthat if he was often most silent when most primed with matter, so\r\nwhen he had nothing to say he was always silent too--a peculiarity\r\nmisleading, until mastered, for a lady who could have allowed in the\r\nlatter case for almost any variety of remark. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid at last, \xe2\x80\x9cof his turning up to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf old Van\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh has HE turned up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour ago, and asking almost in his first breath for Nanda. I\r\nsent him up to her and he\xe2\x80\x99s with her now.\xe2\x80\x9d If Edward had his ways she\r\nhad also some of her own; one of which, in talk with him, if talk it\r\ncould be called, was never to produce anything till the need was marked.\r\nShe had thus a card or two always in reserve, for it was her theory\r\nthat she never knew what might happen. It nevertheless did occur that he\r\nsometimes went, as she would have called it, one better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not with her now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go up?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook was immensely interested. \xe2\x80\x9cHe left\r\nme, you know, to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow--how should I know? I left her five minutes ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he went out without seeing her.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook took it in. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nchanged his mind out there on the stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edward, \xe2\x80\x9cit won\xe2\x80\x99t be the first mind that has been changed\r\nthere. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the only thing a man can change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you refer particularly to MY stairs?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with her whimsical\r\nwoe. But meanwhile she had taken it in. \xe2\x80\x9cThen whom were you speaking\r\nof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s coming to tea with her. She has had a note.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when did he come to town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast night, I believe. The note, an hour or two ago, announced\r\nhim--brought by hand and hoping she\xe2\x80\x99d be at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook thought again. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad she is. He\xe2\x80\x99s too sweet. By hand!--it\r\nmust have been so he sent them to mamma. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the world\r\nwire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Nanda has often wired to HIM,\xe2\x80\x9d her father returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she ought to be ashamed of herself. But how,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nyou know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know when we\xe2\x80\x99re in a thing like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you complain of her want of intimacy with you! It turns out that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re as thick as thieves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward looked at this charge as he looked at all old friends, without\r\na sign--to call a sign--of recognition. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know of whose want of\r\nintimacy with me I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever complained. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t much more of it, that\r\nI can see, that any of them could put on. What do you suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nthem do? If I on my side don\xe2\x80\x99t get very far I may have alluded to THAT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but you do,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook declared. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think you don\xe2\x80\x99t, but you\r\nget very far indeed. You\xe2\x80\x99re always, as I said just now, bringing out\r\nsomething that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and seeing you flare up at it. What I bring out is only what they\r\ntell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis limitation offered, however, for Mrs. Brook no difficulty. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but\r\nit seems to me that with the things people nowadays tell one--! What\r\nmore do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x9d--and Edward from his chair regarded the fire a while--\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ndifference must be in what they tell YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings that are better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--worse. I dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I give them--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad as what I do? Oh we must each do our best. But when I hear\r\nfrom you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Nanda had ever permitted herself\r\nanything so dreadful as to wire to him, it comes over me afresh that _I_\r\nwould have been the perfect one to deal with him if his detestation of\r\nme hadn\xe2\x80\x99t prevented.\xe2\x80\x9d She was by this time also--but on her feet--before\r\nthe fire, into which, like her husband, she gazed. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ would never have\r\nwired. I\xe2\x80\x99d have gone in for little delicacies and odd things she has\r\nnever thought of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go in for what you do,\xe2\x80\x9d Edward assented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s as bleak as a chimney-top when the fire\xe2\x80\x99s out, and if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen after all for mamma--!\xe2\x80\x9d And she lost herself again in the reasons\r\nof things.\r\n\r\nHer husband\xe2\x80\x99s silence seemed to mark for an instant a deference to her\r\nallusion, but there was a limit even to this combination. \xe2\x80\x9cYou make your\r\nmother, I think, keep it up pretty well. But if she HADN\xe2\x80\x99T as you say,\r\ndone so--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, where are we now? That\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFollowing her own train she had at first no heed for his question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout his hatred he would have liked me.\xe2\x80\x9d But she came back with a\r\nsigh to the actual. \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter. We must deal with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat HAVE we got?\xe2\x80\x9d Edward continued.\r\n\r\nAgain with no ear for his question his wife turned away, only however,\r\nafter taking a few vague steps, to approach him with new decision.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s due will you do me a favour? Will you go back to\r\nNanda--before he arrives--and let her know, though not of course as from\r\nME, that Van has been here half an hour, has had it put well before\r\nhim that she\xe2\x80\x99s up there and at liberty, and has left the house without\r\nseeing her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward Brookenham made no motion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like better to do it\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I liked better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have already done it. The\r\nway to make it not come from me is surely not for me to give it to her.\r\nBesides, I want to be here to receive him first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen can\xe2\x80\x99t she know it afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter Mr. Longdon has gone? The whole point is that she should know it\r\nin time to let HIM know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward still communed with the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of THAT?\xe2\x80\x9d Her\r\nimpatience, which visibly increased, carried her away again, and by the\r\ntime she reached the window he had launched another question. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\nin such a hurry she should know that Van doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call a hurry when I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited nearly a year? Nanda may know\r\nor not as she likes--may know whenever: if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know pretty well\r\nby this time she\xe2\x80\x99s too stupid for it to matter. My only pressure\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\nMr. Longdon. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have it there for him when he arrives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean she\xe2\x80\x99ll make haste to tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook raised her eyes a moment to some upper immensity. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer husband on the other hand, his legs outstretched, looked straight at\r\nthe toes of his boots. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you very sure?\xe2\x80\x9d Then as he remained without\r\nan answer: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should she if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told HER?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the way I so long ago let you know that he had put the matter to\r\nVan? It\xe2\x80\x99s not out between them in words, no doubt; but I fancy that for\r\nthings to pass they\xe2\x80\x99ve not to dot their i\xe2\x80\x99s quite so much, my dear, as\r\nwe two. Without a syllable said to her she\xe2\x80\x99s yet aware in every fibre of\r\nher little being of what has taken place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward gave a still longer space to taking this in. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she strike you as so poor,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwith so awfully\r\nmuch done for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone by whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if she had not heard the question that she spoke again. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nhas got what every woman, young or old, wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward\xe2\x80\x99s tone was of wonder, but she simply went on: \xe2\x80\x9cShe has got a man\r\nof her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but if he\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you call Mr. Longdon so very wrong? I wish,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared with a\r\nstrange sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cthat _I_ had had a Mr. Longdon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish very much you had. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken it like Van.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it took Van,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook replied, \xe2\x80\x9cto put THEM where they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where ARE they? That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly it. In these three months, for\r\ninstance,\xe2\x80\x9d Edward demanded, \xe2\x80\x9chow has their connexion profited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cProfited which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, one cares most for one\xe2\x80\x99s child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she has become for him what we\xe2\x80\x99ve most hoped her to be--an object\r\nof compassion still more marked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you\xe2\x80\x99ve hoped her to be?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook was obviously so lucid\r\nfor herself that her renewed expression of impatience had plenty of\r\npoint. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask after seeing what I did--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat night at Mrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s? Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time I HAVE asked\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had a silence more pregnant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for being with US that he\r\npities her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWith me too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much--but still you help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you thought I didn\xe2\x80\x99t--that night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s? Oh you didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything, every\r\none helps. Harold distinctly\xe2\x80\x9d--she seemed to figure it all out--\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\neven the poor children, I dare say, a little. Oh but every one\xe2\x80\x9d--she\r\nwarmed to the vision--\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. Jane immensely, par example.\r\nAlmost all the others who come to the house. Cashmore, Carrie, Tishy,\r\nFanny--bless their hearts all!--each in their degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward Brookenham had under the influence of this demonstration\r\ngradually risen from his seat, and as his wife approached that part\r\nof her process which might be expected to furnish the proof he placed\r\nhimself before her with his back to the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mitchy, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was out. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cDifferent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a help. Quite a drawback.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as his face told how these WERE\r\ninvolutions, \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, but you can believe me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one who does most is of course Van himself.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a\r\nstatement by which his failure to apprehend was not diminished, and she\r\ncompleted her operation. \xe2\x80\x9cBy not liking her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward\xe2\x80\x99s gloom, on this, was not quite blankness, yet it was dense. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou like his not liking her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear no. No better than HE does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he hates it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him,\xe2\x80\x9d Edward appeared to say more to himself\r\nthan to his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned--not at all in this case,\r\nplainly, for herself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know it. He\xe2\x80\x99d like her if he could, but he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. That,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cis what makes it sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was at last in Edward\xe2\x80\x99s gravity a positive pathos. \xe2\x80\x9cSure he won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npropose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure Mr. Longdon won\xe2\x80\x99t now throw her over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course if it IS sure--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is. But of course if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she won\xe2\x80\x99t have anything. Anything but US,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued to\r\nreflect. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless, you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re working it on a certainty--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I AM working it on. I did nothing till I knew I was\r\nsafe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Safe\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he ambiguously echoed while on this their eyes met longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafe. I knew he\xe2\x80\x99d stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did you know Van wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter \xe2\x80\x98how\xe2\x80\x99--but better still. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stuck.\xe2\x80\x9d She said it very\r\nsimply, but she turned away from him.\r\n\r\nHis eyes for a little followed her. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t KNOW, after all, the old\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t. Nanda does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where\xe2\x80\x99s the support if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, who had faced about, again turned from him. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t forget,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked with superiority, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we don\xe2\x80\x99t ask her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYOU don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d Edward gloomed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever. But I trust her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused afresh, \xe2\x80\x9cone must trust one\xe2\x80\x99s child. Does Van?\xe2\x80\x9d he then\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he trust her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he know anything of the general figure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything. It\xe2\x80\x99s high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has told you so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, supremely impatient now, seemed to demur even to the\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ask HIM even less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how do we know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was weary of explaining. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause that\xe2\x80\x99s just why he hates it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no end however, apparently, to what Edward could take. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nhates what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, not liking her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward kept his back to the fire and his dead eyes on the cornice and\r\nthe ceiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be so difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Mr. Longdon can manage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what the devil\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with her,\xe2\x80\x9d he coldly continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that may not prevent--! It\xe2\x80\x99s fortunately the source at any rate of\r\nhalf Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what the hell IS it?\xe2\x80\x9d he drearily demanded.\r\n\r\nShe faltered a little, but she brought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made, at this, a movement that drew his eyes to her own, and for a\r\nmoment she dimly smiled at him. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the nicest thing you ever said\r\nto me. But ever, EVER, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d She had her hand on his sleeve, and he looked almost awkward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the very nicest. Consider that fact well and even if you only\r\nsaid it by accident don\xe2\x80\x99t be funny--as you know you sometimes CAN\r\nbe--and take it back. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. It\xe2\x80\x99s charming, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? when our\r\ntroubles bring us more together. Now go up to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward kept a queer face, into which this succession of remarks\r\nintroduced no light, but he finally moved, and it was only when he had\r\nalmost reached the door that he stopped again. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you know he\r\nhas sent her no end of books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon--of late? Oh yes, a deluge, so that her room looks like\r\na bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s back shop; and all, in the loveliest bindings, the most\r\nstandard English works. I not only know it, naturally, but I know--what\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t--why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Edward echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy but that--unless he should send her\r\nmoney--it\xe2\x80\x99s about the only kindness he can show her at a distance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook hesitated; then with a little suppressed sigh: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it still held him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd perhaps he does send her money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdward lingered. \xe2\x80\x9cThen is he taking it out--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn books only?\xe2\x80\x9d It was wonderful--with its effect on him now\r\nvisible--how she possessed her subject. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s his delicacy--for\r\nthe present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid for the future--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf his considering that the books will have worked it off? No. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthrown in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust perceptibly cheered he reached the door, where, however, he had\r\nanother pause. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think I had better see Van?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to ask what the devil he means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you should do anything so hideously vulgar,\xe2\x80\x9d she instantly replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d leave your house the next hour. Do you expect,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto be\r\nable to force your child down his throat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was clearly not prepared with an account of his expectations, but he\r\nhad a general memory that imposed itself. \xe2\x80\x9cThen why in the world did he\r\nmake up to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t. We made up to HIM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why in the world--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, really to finish, \xe2\x80\x9cwe were in love with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Edward jerked. He had by this time opened the door, and the\r\nsound was partly the effect of the disclosure of a servant preceding a\r\nvisitor. His greeting of the visitor before edging past and away was,\r\nhowever, of the briefest; it might have implied that they had met but\r\nyesterday. \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, Mitchy?--At home? Oh rather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nVery different was Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s welcome of the restored wanderer to\r\nwhom, in a brief space, she addressed every expression of surprise and\r\ndelight, though marking indeed at last, as a qualification of these\r\nthings, her regret that he declined to partake of her tea or to allow\r\nher to make him what she called \xe2\x80\x9csnug for a talk\xe2\x80\x9d in his customary\r\ncorner of her sofa. He pleaded frankly agitation and embarrassment,\r\nreminded her even that he was awfully shy and that after separations,\r\ncomplications, whatever might at any time happen, he was conscious of\r\nthe dust that had settled on intercourse and that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t blow away\r\nin a single breath. She was only, according to her nature, to indulge\r\nhim if, while he walked about and changed his place, he came to the\r\nsurface but in patches and pieces. There was so much he wanted to know\r\nthat--well, as they had arrived only the night before, she could judge.\r\nThere was knowledge, it became clear, that Mrs. Brook almost equally\r\ncraved, so that it even looked at first as if, on either side,\r\nconfidence might be choked by curiosity. This disaster was finally\r\nbarred by the fact that the spirit of enquiry found for Mitchy material\r\nthat was comparatively plastic. That was after all apparent enough when\r\nat the end of a few vain passes he brought out sociably: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, has he\r\ndone it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill indeed there was something in Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s face that seemed to\r\nreply \xe2\x80\x9cOh come--don\xe2\x80\x99t rush it, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d and something in the movement\r\nwith which she turned away that described the state of their question\r\nas by no means so simple as that. On his refusal of tea she had rung for\r\nthe removal of the table, and the bell was at this moment answered by\r\nthe two men. Little ensued then, for some minutes, while the servants\r\nwere present; she spoke only as the butler was about to close the door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Longdon presently comes show him into Mr. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s room if\r\nMr. Brookenham isn\xe2\x80\x99t there. If he is show him into the dining-room and\r\nin either case let me immediately know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man waited expressionless. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in case of his asking for Miss\r\nBrookenham--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with a sharpness before which her interlocutor\r\nretired. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will!\xe2\x80\x9d she then added in quite another tone to Mitchy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, you know, he perfectly MAY. But oh the subtlety of servants!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she sighed.\r\n\r\nMitchy was now all there. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s in town then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the first time since you went away. He\xe2\x80\x99s to call this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you want to see him alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want to see him at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your keeping him below--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs so that he shan\xe2\x80\x99t burst in till I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s YOU, my dear, I want to\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy glared about. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t take it ill if, in return for that, I\r\nsay I myself want to see every one. I could have done even just now with\r\na little more of Edward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, in her own manner and with a slow headshake, looked lovely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she puzzled it out with a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cIt even does come\r\nover me that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my dear woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy encouragingly, \xe2\x80\x9cdid I EVER mind? I\r\nassure you,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t come back to begin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, suddenly dropping everything else, she laid her hand on him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMitchy love, ARE you happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo for a moment they stood confronted. \xe2\x80\x9cNot perhaps as YOU would have\r\ntried to make me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve still GOT me, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a great deal. How, if I really look at it,\r\ncan a man of my peculiar nature--it IS, you know, awfully peculiar--NOT\r\nbe happy? Think, if one is driven to it for instance, of the breadth of\r\nmy sympathies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, as a result of thinking, appeared for a little to demur.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--but one mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be too much driven to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s by one\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies\r\nthat one suffers. If you should do that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clearly evoked for Mitchy a definite image. \xe2\x80\x9cIt WOULD be funny,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to. I\xe2\x80\x99d go off and do it alone\r\nsomewhere--in a dark room, I think, or on a desert island; at any rate\r\nwhere nobody should see. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the harm moreover,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cof\r\nany suffering that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bore one, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, however much its outer\r\naspect might amuse some others, mine wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bore me? What I should\r\ndo in my desert island or my dark room, I feel, would be just to\r\ndance about with the thrill of it--which is exactly the exhibition of\r\nludicrous gambols that I would fain have arranged to spare you. I assure\r\nyou, dear Mrs. Brook,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the least bored\r\nnow. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s so interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d she vaguely interposed.\r\n\r\nBut he pursued without heeding: \xe2\x80\x9cWas perhaps what you had in your head\r\nthat _I_ should see him--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came back but slowly, however, to the moment. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon? Well,\r\nyes. You know he can\xe2\x80\x99t bear ME--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy was almost eager.\r\n\r\nIt had already sent her off again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too lovely. You HAVE come\r\nback the same. It seemed to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she after an instant explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nwanted him to be seen--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout inconvenience, as it were, either to himself or to you? Then,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mitchy, who visibly felt that he had taken her up successfully, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nstrikes me that I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely your man. It\xe2\x80\x99s delicious to come back to\r\na use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she was much more dim about it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh what you\xe2\x80\x99ve come back to--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at. Van is still then where I left\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was just silent. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you really believe he would move?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy took a few turns, speaking almost with his back presented. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nwith all the reasons--!\xe2\x80\x9d After which, while she watched him, he was\r\nbefore her again with a question. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s utterly off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was it ever really on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know your view, and that, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cis the most\r\nextraordinary part of it. I can tell you it would have put ME on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy view?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you forgotten that I had for you\r\ntoo a view that didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t differ, you and I. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a defiance and a\r\nprophecy. You wanted ME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him. For HER, I mean. So you risked showing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cDID I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain they were face to face. \xe2\x80\x9cYour candour\xe2\x80\x99s divine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean it was even then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy smiled at her till he was red. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew my Van!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ thought I knew \xe2\x80\x98yours\xe2\x80\x99 too,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy said. Their eyes met a minute\r\nand he added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cHow you\xe2\x80\x99ve worked it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked barely conscious. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Worked it\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d After which, with a slightly\r\nsharper note: \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know--while you\xe2\x80\x99ve been amusing yourself in\r\nplaces that I\xe2\x80\x99d give my head to see again but never shall--what I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I saw, you know, that night at Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s, just before we left\r\nEngland, your wonderful start. I got a look at your attitude, as it\r\nwere, and your system.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes were now far away, and she spoke after an instant without\r\nmoving them. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd didn\xe2\x80\x99t I by the same token get a look at yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy thought, but seemed to doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nany then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that it has formed itself--your system--since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with decision. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you I\xe2\x80\x99m quite at sea. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever had, and I have as little as ever now, anything but my general\r\nphilosophy, which I won\xe2\x80\x99t attempt at present to go into and of which\r\nmoreover I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve had first and last your glimpses. What I made\r\nout in you that night was a perfect policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had another of her infantine stares. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one that night\r\nseems to have made out something! All I can say is at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in that case you were all far deeper than I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just a blind instinct, without a programme or a scheme? Perhaps\r\nthen, since it has so perfectly succeeded, the name doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nlost, as I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy declared, \xe2\x80\x9cin admiration of its success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked, as before, so young, yet so grave. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call its\r\nsuccess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me ask you rather--mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I?--what YOU call its failure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, who had been standing for some minutes, seated herself at\r\nthis as if to respond to his idea. But the next moment she had fallen\r\nback into thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you often heard from him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you written?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word either. I left it, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy smiled, \xe2\x80\x9call, to YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n After which he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cHas he been with you much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cAs little as possible. But as it happens he was\r\nhere just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer visitor fairly flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve only missed him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer pause again was of the briefest. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if he HAD gone up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Gone up\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Nanda, who has now her own sitting-room, as you know; for whom he\r\nimmediately asked and for whose benefit, whatever you may think, I was\r\nat the end of a quarter of an hour, I assure you, perfectly ready to\r\nrelease him. He changed his mind, however, and went away without seeing\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy showed the deepest interest. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what made him change his mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared to watch this labour. \xe2\x80\x9cBut with no light yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hung fire once more but an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t yourself work the\r\nthing again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose at this in strange sincerity. \xe2\x80\x9cI think, you know, you go very\r\nfar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we just now settle,\xe2\x80\x9d he promptly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\ninstinctive and unconscious? If it was so that night at Tishy\xe2\x80\x99s--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, voyons, voyons,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat did I do even then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He laughed out at something in her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d like it again all\r\npictured--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you just simply--publicly--took her back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where was the monstrosity of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the one little right place. In your removal of every doubt--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of what?\xe2\x80\x9d He had appeared not quite to know how to put it. But\r\nhe saw at last. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of what we may still hope to do for her. Thanks\r\nto your care there were specimens.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as she had the look of trying\r\nvainly to focus a few, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t recover them one by one,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut the whole thing was quite lurid enough to do us all credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe met him after a little, but at such an odd point. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me if I\r\nscarcely see how much of the credit was yours. For the first time since\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve known you, you went in for decency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s surprise showed as real. \xe2\x80\x9cIt struck you as decency--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince he wished she thought it over. \xe2\x80\x9cOh your behaviour--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy behaviour was--my condition. Do you call THAT decent? No, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nquite out.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke, in his good nature, with an approach to reproof.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I ever--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it had already brought her quite round, and to a firmer earth that\r\nshe clearly preferred to tread. \xe2\x80\x9cAre things really bad with you, Mitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how they are. But not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome other time?--on your honour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dimly smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be like old times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rather demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cFor you perhaps. But not for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of what he said it did hold her, and her hand again almost\r\ncaressed him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut--till you do tell me--is it very very dreadful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just perhaps what I may have to get you to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen shall I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d she eagerly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it will be quite in your line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the thought of her line--it sounded somehow so general--she released\r\nhim a little with a sigh, yet still looking round, as it were, for\r\npossibilities. \xe2\x80\x9cJane, you know, is in a state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Jane\xe2\x80\x99s in a state. That\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued in a manner to cling to him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut is it your only one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was very kind and patient. \xe2\x80\x9cNot perhaps quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99M a little of one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, as you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, she saw, but was still on the wing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall you have\r\nrecourse--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked as she appeared to falter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to anything violent. But shall you tell Nanda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, everything. I think, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook musingly observed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat it would really serve her right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s silence, which lasted a minute, seemed to take the idea, but\r\nnot perhaps quite to know what to do with it. \xe2\x80\x9cAh I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I shall\r\nnever really serve her right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke the butler reappeared; at sight of whom Mrs. Brook\r\nimmediately guessed. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Mr. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s room, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Mr. Brookenham has gone out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where has he gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, only for some evening papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had an intense look for Mitchy; then she said to the man: \xe2\x80\x9cAsk him\r\nto wait three minutes--I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring;\xe2\x80\x9d turning again to her visitor as soon\r\nas they were alone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\xe2\x80\x99m trusting you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrusting me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if he comes up to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t I better go down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--you may have Edward back. If you see him you must see him here. If\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t myself it\xe2\x80\x99s for a reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy again just sounded her. \xe2\x80\x9cHis not, as you a while ago hinted--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, caring for what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d She had a pause, but she brought it out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what you tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy was splendid. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. And you want\r\nsomething said to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll take from YOU. Only it\xe2\x80\x99s for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9creally and honestly, and as I trust you, to give it. But the comfort of\r\nyou is that you\xe2\x80\x99ll do so if you promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy was infinitely struck. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t promised, eh? Of course I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t till I know what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s to put before him--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I see: the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened here to-day. Van\xe2\x80\x99s marked retreat and how, with the\r\ntime that has passed, it makes us at last know where we are. You of\r\ncourse for yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook wound up, \xe2\x80\x9csee that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere we are?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy took a turn and came back. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what then did Van\r\ncome for? If you speak of a retreat there must have been an advance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook, \xe2\x80\x9che simply wanted not to look too brutal. After\r\nso much absence he COULD come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he established that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t brutal, where was the retreat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his not going up to Nanda. He came--frankly--to do that, but made\r\nup his mind on second thoughts that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t risk even being civil to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy had visibly warmed to his work. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what made the\r\ndifference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat difference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of the effect, as you say, of his second thoughts. Thoughts of\r\nwhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brook suddenly and as if it were quite simple--\xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nTHAT! Suspicions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of YOU, you goose. Of your not having done--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted as she paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I say it? The best thing for yourself. And of Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s feeling\r\nthat. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the effort of seeing, or perhaps indeed in the full act of it, poor\r\nMitchy glared as never before. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Van\xe2\x80\x99s JEALOUS of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPressed as she was, there was something in his face that momentarily\r\nhushed her. \xe2\x80\x9cThere it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she achieved however at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf ME?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy went on.\r\n\r\nWhat was in his face so suddenly and strangely--was the look of rising\r\ntears--at sight of which, as from a compunction as prompt, she showed a\r\nlovely flush. \xe2\x80\x9cThere it is, there it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ask me for\r\na reason, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the only one I see. Of course if you don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9che needn\xe2\x80\x99t come up. He can go straight to Nanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy had turned away again as with the impulse of hiding the tears\r\nthat had risen and that had not wholly disappeared even by the time he\r\nfaced about. \xe2\x80\x9cDid Nanda know he was to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Was she expecting Van--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook mildly wailed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen can she have NOT been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy looked hard for an instant at the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean does she know he\r\nhas been and gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, from where she stood and through the window, looked rather\r\nat the sky. \xe2\x80\x9cHer father will have told her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer father?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy frankly wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIs HE in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook had at this a longer pause. \xe2\x80\x9cYou assume, I suppose, Mitchy\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x9d she then quavered \xe2\x80\x9cthat I put him up--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut Edward up?\xe2\x80\x9d he broke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--that of course. Put Van up to ideas--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe caught it again. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout ME--what you call his suspicions?\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed\r\nto weigh the charge, but it ended, while he passed his hand hard over\r\nhis eyes, in weariness and in the nearest approach to coldness he had\r\never shown Mrs. Brook. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It\xe2\x80\x99s every one\xe2\x80\x99s fate to be\r\nin one way or another the subject of ideas. Do then,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9clet\r\nMr. Longdon come up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe instantly rang the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Nanda. But don\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nfrightened,\xe2\x80\x9d she added as she came back, \xe2\x80\x9cas to what we may--Edward or\r\nI--do next. It\xe2\x80\x99s only to tell her that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Tatton,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy replied.\r\n\r\nStill, however, she lingered. \xe2\x80\x9cShall you ever care for me more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had almost the air, as he waited for her to go, of the master of the\r\nhouse, for she had made herself before him, as he stood with his back\r\nto the fire, as humble as a tolerated visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cOh just as much. Where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe difference? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t our ties in fact rather multiplied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way _I_ want to feel it. And from the moment you recognise\r\nwith me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that he never, you know, really WOULD--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her mercifully up. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no harm done?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy thought of it.\r\n\r\nIt made her still hover. \xe2\x80\x9cNanda will be rich. Toward that you CAN help,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s really, I may now tell you, what it came into my head you\r\nshould see our friend here FOR.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe maintained his waiting attitude. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re our guardian angel!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAt this he laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till you see what Mr. Longdon does!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she took no notice. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to see before I go that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\nnothing for myself. Van, after all--!\xe2\x80\x9d she mused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly hates me. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t as with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve really lost him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy for an instant, with the eyes that had shown his tears, glared\r\naway into space. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t very positively, you know, now like ANY of\r\nus. He misses a fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Brook once more observed. Then she had a comparative\r\nbrightness. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad YOU don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d He gave another laugh, but she was\r\nalready facing Mr. Tatton, who had again answered the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cShow Mr.\r\nLongdon up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m to tell him then it\xe2\x80\x99s at your request?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy asked when the\r\nbutler had gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you receive him? Oh yes. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be the last to quarrel with that.\r\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one more thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was something over which of a sudden she had one of her returns of\r\nanxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying for months and months to remember to find out\r\nfrom you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired, as she looked odd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy if Harold ever gave back to you, as he swore to me on his honour he\r\nwould, that five-pound note--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut which, dear lady?\xe2\x80\x9d The sense of other incongruities than those they\r\nhad been dealing with seemed to arrive now for Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s aid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one that, ages ago, one day when you and Van were here, we had the\r\njoke about. You produced it, in sport, as a \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99 for something, and\r\nput it on that table; after which, before I knew what you were about,\r\nbefore I could run after you, you had gone off and ridiculously left it.\r\nOf course the next minute--and again before I could turn round--Harold\r\nhad pounced on it, and I tried in vain to recover it from him. But all I\r\ncould get him to do--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas to promise to restore it straight to its owner?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy had\r\nlistened so much less in surprise than in amusement that he had\r\napparently after a moment re-established the scene. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I recollect--he\r\ndid settle with me. THAT\xe2\x80\x99S all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fixed him from the door of the next room. \xe2\x80\x9cYou got every penny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery penny. But fancy your bringing it up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I always do, you know--SOME day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re of a rigour--! But be at peace. Harold\xe2\x80\x99s quite square,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cand I quite meant to have asked you about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Brook, promptly, was all for this. \xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy came nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Fanny--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--HAS stayed for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you\xe2\x80\x99d do it! But hush--they\xe2\x80\x99re coming!\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nwhich, while she whisked away, he went back to the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTen minutes of talk with Mr. Longdon by Mrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s hearth elapsed\r\nfor him without his arriving at the right moment to take up the business\r\nso richly put before him in his previous interview. No less time indeed\r\ncould have sufficed to bring him into closer relation with this affair,\r\nand nothing at first could have been more marked than the earnestness\r\nof his care not to show impatience of appeals that were, for a person of\r\nhis old friend\xe2\x80\x99s general style, simple recognitions and decencies. There\r\nwas a limit to the mere allusiveness with which, in Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s school\r\nof manners, a foreign tour might be treated, and Mitchy, no doubt,\r\nplentifully showed that none of his frequent returns had encountered a\r\ncuriosity at once so explicit and so discreet. To belong to a circle in\r\nwhich most of the members might be at any moment on the other side of\r\nthe globe was inevitably to fall into the habit of few questions, as\r\nwell as into that of making up for their fewness by their freedom.\r\nThis interlocutor in short, while Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s representative\r\nprivately thought over all he had in hand, went at some length and very\r\ncharmingly--since it was but a tribute to common courtesy--into the\r\nVirgilian associations of the Bay of Naples. Finally, however, he\r\nstarted, his eye having turned to the clock. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that, though\r\nour hostess doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear, I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget myself. I too came back but\r\nyesterday and I\xe2\x80\x99ve an engagement--for which I\xe2\x80\x99m already late--with Miss\r\nBrookenham, who has been so good as to ask me to tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe divided mind, the express civility, the decent \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Brookenham,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the escape from their hostess--these were all things Mitchy could\r\nquickly take in, and they gave him in a moment his light for not missing\r\nhis occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see--I shall make you keep Nanda waiting. But\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s something I shall ask you to take from me quite as a sufficient\r\nbasis for that: which is simply that after all, you know--for I think\r\nyou do know, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?--I\xe2\x80\x99m nearly as much attached to her as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had looked suddenly apprehensive and even a trifle\r\nembarrassed, but he spoke with due presence of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\r\nunderstand that perfectly. If you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t liked her so much--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy as he checked himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would never, last year, have gone to stay with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough I like you also--and extremely,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon gravely pursued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy made a sign of acknowledgement. \xe2\x80\x9cYou like me better for HER than\r\nyou do for anybody else BUT myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou put it, I think, correctly. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen so much\r\nof Nanda--if between my age and hers, that is, any real contact is\r\npossible--without knowing that she now regards you as one of the very\r\nbest of her friends, treating you, I find myself suspecting, with a\r\ndegree of confidence--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy gave a laugh of interruption. \xe2\x80\x9cThat she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show even to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s poised glasses faced him. \xe2\x80\x9cEven! I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, as the\r\nopportunity has come up, telling you frankly--and as from my time of\r\nlife to your own--all the comfort I take in the sense that in any case\r\nof need or trouble she might look to you for whatever advice or support\r\nthe crisis should demand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has told you she feels I\xe2\x80\x99d be there?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy after an instant\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I ought quite to mention\r\nanything she has \xe2\x80\x98told\xe2\x80\x99 me. I speak of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve made out myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I thank you more than I can say for your penetration. Her mother,\r\nI should let you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis with her just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon took off his glasses with a jerk. \xe2\x80\x9cHas anything happened to\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo account for the fact I refer to?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy said in amusement at his\r\nstart. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not ill, that I know of, thank goodness, and she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbroken her leg. But something, none the less, has happened to her--that\r\nI think I may say. To tell you all in a word, it\xe2\x80\x99s the reason, such as\r\nit is, of my being here to meet you. Mrs. Brook asked me to wait. She\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee you herself some other time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Nanda too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that must be between yourselves. Only, while I keep you here--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe understands my delay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy thought. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Brook must have explained.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as his companion\r\ntook this in silence, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt only comes to me that Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s explanations--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre often so odd? Oh yes; but Nanda, you know, allows for that oddity.\r\nAnd Mrs. Brook, by the same token,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy developed, \xe2\x80\x9cknows herself--no\r\none better--what may frequently be thought of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s precisely the\r\nreason of her desire that you should have on this occasion explanations\r\nfrom a source that she\xe2\x80\x99s so good as to pronounce, for the immediate\r\npurpose, superior. As for Nanda,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cto be aware that we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhere together won\xe2\x80\x99t strike her as so bad a sign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon attentively assented; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly fear we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nplotting her ruin. But what then has happened to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s you, I think, who will have to give it a\r\nname. I know you know what I\xe2\x80\x99ve known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, his nippers again in place, hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I help it? To reckon with such cleverness--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas beyond you? Ah it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my cleverness,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngreater than mine. There\xe2\x80\x99s a greater even than Van\xe2\x80\x99s. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole\r\npoint,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on while his friend looked at him hard. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nlike it just a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe existence of such an element--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the existence simply of my knowledge of your idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to keep in mind in fairness the existence of my own\r\nknowledge of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mitchy gave that the go-by. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99ve so many \xe2\x80\x98ideas\xe2\x80\x99! I\xe2\x80\x99m always\r\ngetting hold of some new one and for the most part trying it--generally\r\nto let it go as a failure. Yes, I had one six months ago. I tried that.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m trying it still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon with a gaiety slightly strained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat,\r\ncontrary to your usual rule, it\xe2\x80\x99s a success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a gaiety, for that matter, that Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s could match. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does\r\npromise well! But I\xe2\x80\x99ve another idea even now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nagain trying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn me?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon still somewhat extravagantly smiled.\r\n\r\nMitchy thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, on two or three persons, of whom you ARE the\r\nfirst for me to tackle. But what I must begin with is having from you\r\nthat you recognise she trusts us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s idea after an instant had visibly gone further. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth of\r\nthem--the two women up there at present so strangely together. Mrs.\r\nBrook must too; immensely. But for that you won\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had relapsed into an anxiety more natural than his\r\nexpression of a moment before. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about time! But if Nanda didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrust us,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cher case would indeed be a sorry one. She has\r\nnobody else to trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence was grave. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the two men met over it in a pause terminated at last by\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWe must make it all up to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy gently, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend\xe2\x80\x99s grey gloom again covered him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what CAN--?\xe2\x80\x9d Then as\r\nMitchy showed a face that seemed to wince with a silent \xe2\x80\x9cWhat COULD?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the old man completed his objection. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of the magnitude of the\r\nloss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t for a moment suggest,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy hastened to reply, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t immense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does care for him, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\nMitchy, at this, gave a wide, prolonged glare. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Know\xe2\x80\x99--?\xe2\x80\x9d he ever so\r\ndelicately murmured.\r\n\r\nHis irony had quite touched. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course you know! You know\r\neverything--Nanda and you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a tone in it that moved a spring, and Mitchy laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlike your putting me with her! But we\xe2\x80\x99re all together. With Nanda,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nnext added, \xe2\x80\x9cit IS deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion took it from him. \xe2\x80\x9cDeep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet somehow it isn\xe2\x80\x99t abject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man wondered. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Abject\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean it isn\xe2\x80\x99t pitiful. In its way,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy developed, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis too, though rather ruefully, Mr. Longdon could take from him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--in its way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny passion so great, so complete,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis--satisfied or\r\nunsatisfied--a life.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon looked so interested that his fellow\r\nvisitor, evidently stirred by what was now an appeal and a dependence,\r\ngrew still more bland, or at least more assured, for affirmation. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot TOO sorry for herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh she\xe2\x80\x99s so proud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--not for US!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt arrested Mitchy, but his ingenuity could only rebound. \xe2\x80\x9cIn ONE\r\nway: that of reducing us to feel that the desire to \xe2\x80\x98make up\xe2\x80\x99 to her\r\nis--well, mainly for OUR relief. If she \xe2\x80\x98trusts\xe2\x80\x99 us, as I said just now,\r\nit isn\xe2\x80\x99t for THAT she does so.\xe2\x80\x9d As his friend appeared to wait then to\r\nhear, it was presently with positive joy that he showed he could meet\r\nthe last difficulty. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat she trusts us to do\xe2\x80\x9d--oh Mitchy had worked it\r\nout!--\xe2\x80\x9cis to let HIM off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him off?\xe2\x80\x9d It still left Mr. Longdon dim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasily. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what would letting him off hard be? It seems to me he\xe2\x80\x99s--on any\r\nterms--already beyond us. He IS off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had given it a sound that suddenly made Mitchy appear to\r\ncollapse under a sharper sense of the matter. \xe2\x80\x9cHe IS off,\xe2\x80\x9d he moodily\r\nechoed.\r\n\r\nHis companion, again a little bewildered, watched him; then with\r\nimpatience: \xe2\x80\x9cDo, please, tell me what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe quickly pulled himself round. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he was, after a long absence,\r\nhere a while since as if expressly to see her. But after spending half\r\nan hour he went away without it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s watch continued. \xe2\x80\x9cHe spent the half-hour with her mother\r\ninstead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x98instead\xe2\x80\x99--it was hardly that. He at all events dropped his idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what had it been, his idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak as if he had as many as I!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a manner\r\nindeed he has,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued as if for himself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99re of a\r\ndifferent kind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat had it been, his idea?\xe2\x80\x9d the old man, however, simply repeated.\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s confession at this seemed to explain his previous evasion. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nshall never know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t tell YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cLess than any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany things they had not spoken had already passed between them, and\r\nsomething evidently, to the sense of each, passed during the moment that\r\nfollowed this. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile you were abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon presently asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdid you hear from him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever. And I wrote nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve neither written nor heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but with you it will be different.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon, as if with the\r\noutbreak of an agitation hitherto controlled, had turned abruptly away\r\nand, with the usual swing of his glass, begun almost wildly to wander.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou WILL hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but what Nanda wants, you know, is that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too much\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon thoughtfully rambled. \xe2\x80\x9cToo much--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo let him off, as we were saying, easily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder man for a while said nothing more, but he at last came back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d like me actually to give him something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cA handsome present.\xe2\x80\x9d They were face to face again\r\nwith more mute interchange. \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want HIM to have lost--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mr. Longdon, however, on this, once more broke off while Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes followed him. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it give a sort of measure of what she may\r\nfeel--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had paused, working it out again with the effect of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturning afresh to be fed with his light. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t what give it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the fact that we still like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon stared. \xe2\x80\x9cDo YOU still like him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I didn\xe2\x80\x99t how should I mind--?\xe2\x80\x9d But on the utterance of it Mitchy\r\nfairly pulled up.\r\n\r\nHis companion, after another look, laid a mild hand on his shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom HIM? Oh nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d He could trust himself again. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are people\r\nlike that--great cases of privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe IS one!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon mused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is. They go through life somehow guaranteed. They can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\npleasing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cif it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for that--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey hold, they keep every one,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the sacred\r\nterror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe companions for a little seemed to stand together in this element;\r\nafter which the elder turned once more away and appeared to continue to\r\nwalk in it. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Nanda!\xe2\x80\x9d then, in a far-off sigh, came across from him\r\nto Mitchy. Mitchy on this turned vaguely round to the fire, into which\r\nhe remained gazing till he heard again Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew\r\nit of course after all. It was what I came up to town for. That night,\r\nbefore you went abroad, at Mrs. Grendon\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy was with him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, made me see the future. It was then already too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy assented with emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cToo late. She was spoiled for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Longdon had to take it he took it at least quietly, only saying\r\nafter a time: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd her mother ISN\xe2\x80\x99T?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. Quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does Mrs. Brook know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. She resembles you and me. She \xe2\x80\x98still likes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what good will that do her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy sketched a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good does it do US?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can at least respect ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCAN we?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd HE can respect us,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend, as if not hearing him, went on.\r\n\r\nMitchy seemed almost to demur. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must think we\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x98rum.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s worse than rum. He can\xe2\x80\x99t respect HER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that will be perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat she\xe2\x80\x99ll get just most\r\nout of!\xe2\x80\x9d It was the first time of Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s showing that even after\r\na minute he had not understood him; so that as quickly as possible he\r\npassed to another point. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do anything may I be in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can I do? If it\xe2\x80\x99s over it\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor HIM, yes. But not for her or for you or for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m not for long!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man wearily said, turning the next moment\r\nto the door, at which one of the footmen had appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Brookenham\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, please sir,\xe2\x80\x9d this messenger articulated,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand Miss Brookenham is now alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks--I\xe2\x80\x99ll come up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant withdrew, and the eyes of the two visitors again met for\r\na minute, after which Mitchy looked about for his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon watched him while, having found his hat, he looked about for\r\nhis stick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to be in EVERYTHING?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, without answering, smoothed his hat down; then he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsay you\xe2\x80\x99re not for long, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t abandon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I mean I shan\xe2\x80\x99t last for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, since you so expressed it yourself, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean too. I\r\nassure you _I_ shan\xe2\x80\x99t desert her. And if I can help you--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon interrupted, looking at him hard.\r\n\r\nIt made him a little awkward. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp you to help her, you know--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon presently returned. \xe2\x80\x9cA year and a\r\nhalf ago you wanted to help me to help Mr. Vanderbank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t quite say I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your ideas of help are of a splendour--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you about my ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy was almost apologetic. Mr.\r\nLongdon had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m not indiscreet then in recognising\r\nyour marriage as one of them. And that, with a responsibility so great\r\nalready assumed, you appear fairly eager for another--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMakes me out a kind of monster of benevolence?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy looked at it\r\nwith a flushed face. \xe2\x80\x9cThe two responsibilities are very much one and the\r\nsame. My marriage has brought me, as it were, only nearer to Nanda. My\r\nwife and she, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? are particular friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, on his side, turned a trifle pale; he looked rather hard\r\nat the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cI see--I see.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he raised his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut--to an old\r\nfellow like me--it\xe2\x80\x99s all so strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt IS strange.\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy spoke very kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon gave a headshake that was both sad and sharp. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nwrong. But YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE all right!\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a different tone as he walked\r\nhastily away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK TENTH. NANDA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nNanda Brookenham, for a fortnight after Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s return, had found\r\nmuch to think of; but the bustle of business became, visibly for us,\r\nparticularly great with her on a certain Friday afternoon in June. She\r\nwas in unusual possession of that chamber of comfort in which so much\r\nof her life had lately been passed, the redecorated and rededicated room\r\nupstairs in which she had enjoyed a due measure both of solitude and\r\nof society. Passing the objects about her in review she gave especial\r\nattention to her rather marked wealth of books; changed repeatedly, for\r\nfive minutes, the position of various volumes, transferred to tables\r\nthose that were on shelves and rearranged shelves with an eye to the\r\neffect of backs. She was flagrantly engaged throughout indeed in the\r\nstudy of effect, which moreover, had the law of an extreme freshness not\r\ninveterately prevailed there, might have been observed to be traceable\r\nin the very detail of her own appearance. \xe2\x80\x9cCompany\xe2\x80\x9d in short was in the\r\nair and expectation in the picture. The flowers on the little tables\r\nbloomed with a consciousness sharply taken up by the glitter of\r\nnick-nacks and reproduced in turn in the light exuberance of cushions\r\non sofas and the measured drop of blinds in windows. The numerous\r\nphotographed friends in particular were highly prepared, with small\r\nintense faces, each, that happened in every case to be turned to the\r\ndoor. The pair of eyes most dilated perhaps was that of old Van, present\r\nunder a polished glass and in a frame of gilt-edged morocco that spoke\r\nout, across the room, of Piccadilly and Christmas, and visibly widening\r\nhis gaze at the opening of the door, at the announcement of a name by a\r\nfootman and at the entrance of a gentleman remarkably like him save as\r\nthe resemblance was on the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s part flattered. Vanderbank had\r\nnot been in the room ten seconds before he showed ever so markedly that\r\nhe had arrived to be kind. Kindness therefore becomes for us, by a quick\r\nturn of the glass that reflects the whole scene, the high pitch of the\r\nconcert--a kindness that almost immediately filled the place, to\r\nthe exclusion of everything else, with a familiar friendly voice, a\r\nbrightness of good looks and good intentions, a constant though perhaps\r\nsometimes misapplied laugh, a superabundance almost of interest,\r\ninattention and movement.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the young man said was that he was tremendously glad she\r\nhad written. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it was most particularly nice of you.\xe2\x80\x9d And this\r\nthought precisely seemed, as he spoke, a flower of the general bloom--as\r\nif the niceness he had brought in was so great that it straightway\r\nconverted everything to its image. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing that upset me a\r\nlittle,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwas your saying that before writing it you had so\r\nhesitated and waited. I hope very much, you know, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll never do\r\nanything of that kind again. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever the slightest desire to see\r\nme--for no matter what reason, if there\xe2\x80\x99s ever the smallest thing of any\r\nsort that I can do for you, I promise you I shan\xe2\x80\x99t easily forgive you if\r\nyou stand on ceremony. It seems to me that when people have known each\r\nother as long as you and I there\xe2\x80\x99s one comfort at least they may treat\r\nthemselves to. I mean of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Van developed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat of being easy and\r\nfrank and natural. There are such a lot of relations in which one isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nin which it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay, in which \xe2\x80\x98ease\xe2\x80\x99 in fact would be the greatest\r\nof troubles and \xe2\x80\x98nature\xe2\x80\x99 the greatest of falsities. However,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued while he suddenly got up to change the place in which he had\r\nput his hat, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t really know why I\xe2\x80\x99m preaching at such a rate, for\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve a perfect consciousness of not myself requiring it. One does half\r\nthe time preach more or less for one\xe2\x80\x99s self, eh? I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken at all\r\nevents, I think, about the right thing with YOU. And a hint\xe2\x80\x99s enough\r\nfor you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, on the right thing with me.\xe2\x80\x9d He had been looking all\r\nround while he talked and had twice shifted his seat; so that it was\r\nquite in consonance with his general admiring notice that the next\r\nimpression he broke out with should have achieved some air of relevance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat extraordinarily lovely flowers you have and how charming you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmade everything! You\xe2\x80\x99re always doing something--women are always\r\nchanging the position of their furniture. If one happens to come in in\r\nthe dark, no matter how well one knows the place, one sits down on a\r\nhat or a puppy-dog. But of course you\xe2\x80\x99ll say one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come in in the\r\ndark, or at least, if one does, deserves what one gets. Only you know\r\nthe way some women keep their rooms. I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say YOU don\xe2\x80\x99t, do\r\nyou?--you don\xe2\x80\x99t go in for flower-pots in the windows and half a dozen\r\nblinds. Why SHOULD you? You HAVE got a lot to show!\xe2\x80\x9d He rose with this\r\nfor the third time, as the better to command the scene. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean is\r\nthat sofa--which by the way is awfully good: you do, my dear Nanda, go\r\nit! It certainly was HERE the last time, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? and this thing was\r\nthere. The last time--I mean the last time I was up here--was fearfully\r\nlong ago: when, by the way, WAS it? But you see I HAVE been and that\r\nI remember it. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve a lot more things now. You\xe2\x80\x99re laying up\r\ntreasure. Really the increase of luxury--! What an awfully jolly lot\r\nof books--have you read them all? Where did you learn so much about\r\nbindings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to talk; he took things up and put them down; Nanda sat in\r\nher place, where her stillness, fixed and colourless, contrasted with\r\nhis rather flushed freedom, and appeared only to wait, half in surprise,\r\nhalf in surrender, for the flow of his suggestiveness to run its course,\r\nso that, having herself provoked the occasion, she might do a little\r\nmore to meet it. It was by no means, however, that his presence in any\r\ndegree ceased to prevail; for there were minutes during which her face,\r\nthe only thing in her that moved, turning with his turns and following\r\nhis glances, actually had a look inconsistent with anything but\r\nsubmission to almost any accident. It might have expressed a desire for\r\nhis talk to last and last, an acceptance of any treatment of the hour\r\nor any version, or want of version, of her act that would best suit his\r\nease, even in fact a resigned prevision of the occurrence of something\r\nthat would leave her, quenched and blank, with the appearance of having\r\nmade him come simply that she might look at him. She might indeed well\r\nhave been aware of an inability to look at him little enough to make\r\nit flagrant that she had appealed to him for something quite different.\r\nKeeping the situation meanwhile thus in his hands he recognised over the\r\nchimney a new alteration. \xe2\x80\x9cThere used to be a big print--wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\r\na thing of the fifties--we had lots of them at home; some place or other\r\n\xe2\x80\x98in the olden time.\xe2\x80\x99 And now there\xe2\x80\x99s that lovely French glass. So you\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke as if she had in some way gainsaid him, whereas he had\r\nnot left her time even to answer a question. But he broke out anew on\r\nthe beauty of her flowers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have awfully good ones--where do you get\r\nthem? Flowers and pictures and--what are the other things people have\r\nwhen they\xe2\x80\x99re happy and superior?--books and birds. You ought to have a\r\nbird or two, though I dare say you think that by the noise I make I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nas good myself as a dozen. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there some girl in some story--it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nScott; what is it?--who had domestic difficulties and a cage in her\r\nwindow and whom one associates with chickweed and virtue? It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nEsmeralda--Esmeralda had a poodle, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she?--or have I got my\r\nheroines mixed? You\xe2\x80\x99re up here yourself like a heroine; you\xe2\x80\x99re perched\r\nin your tower or what do you call it?--your bower. You quite hang over\r\nthe place, you know--the great wicked city, the wonderful London sky and\r\nthe monuments looming through: or am I again only muddling up my Zola?\r\nYou must have the sunsets--haven\xe2\x80\x99t you? No--what am I talking about? Of\r\ncourse you look north. Well, they strike me as about the only thing you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t. At the same time it\xe2\x80\x99s not only because I envy you that I feel\r\nhumiliated. I ought to have sent you some flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d He smote himself\r\nwith horror, throwing back his head with a sudden thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy in\r\ngoodness when I got your note didn\xe2\x80\x99t I for once in my life do something\r\nreally graceful? I simply liked it and answered it. Here I am. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbrought nothing. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t even brought a box of sweets. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a man\r\nof the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost of the flowers here,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda at last said, \xe2\x80\x9ccome from Mr. Longdon.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember his garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank, in quick response, called it up. \xe2\x80\x9cDear yes--wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\ncharming? And that morning you and I spent there\xe2\x80\x9d--he was so careful to\r\nbe easy about it--\xe2\x80\x9ctalking under the trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had gone out to be quiet and read--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you came out to look after me. Well, I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Van went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat we had some good talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe talk, Nanda\xe2\x80\x99s face implied, had become dim to her; but there were\r\nother things. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know he\xe2\x80\x99s a great gardener--I mean really one of the\r\ngreatest. His garden\xe2\x80\x99s like a dinner in a house where the person--the\r\nperson of the house--thoroughly knows and cares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. And he sends you dishes from the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften--every week. It comes to the same thing--now that he\xe2\x80\x99s in town\r\nhis gardener does it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming of them both!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut his gardener--that\r\nextraordinarily tall fellow with the long red beard--was almost as nice\r\nas himself. I had talks with HIM too and remember every word he said. I\r\nremember he told me you asked questions that showed \xe2\x80\x98a deal of study.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut I thought I had never seen all round such a charming lot of\r\npeople--I mean as those down there that our friend has got about him.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully good note for a man, pleasant servants, I always think,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you? Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s--and quite without their saying anything; just\r\nfrom the sort of type and manner they had--struck me as a kind of chorus\r\nof praise. The same with Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s at Mertle, I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Van rambled\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of chap who might have awful ones, but I\r\nrecollect telling him that one quite felt as if it were with THEM one\r\nhad come to stay. Good note, good note,\xe2\x80\x9d he cheerfully repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nbound to say, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued in this key, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ve a jolly\r\nsense for getting in with people who make you comfortable. Then, by the\r\nway, he\xe2\x80\x99s still in town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda waited. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Mr. Mitchy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh HE is, I know--I met them two nights ago; and by the way\r\nagain--don\xe2\x80\x99t let me forget--I want to speak to you about his wife. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen, do you know? Mr. Longdon--which is really too awful.\r\nTwice, thrice I think, have I at moments like this one snatched myself\r\nfrom pressure; but there\xe2\x80\x99s no finding the old demon at any earthly hour.\r\nWhen do YOU go--or does he only come here? Of course I see you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nthe place arranged for him. When I asked at his hotel at what hour he\r\never IS in, blest if the fellow didn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98very often, sir, about ten!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd when I said \xe2\x80\x98Ten P. M.?\xe2\x80\x99 he quite laughed at my innocence over a\r\nperson of such habits. What ARE his habits then now, and what are you\r\nputting him up to? Seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI AM awfully sorry\r\nand I wonder if, the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve a chance, you\xe2\x80\x99d kindly tell him\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say so and that I mean yet to run him to earth. The same\r\nreally with the dear Mitchys. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t somehow, the other night, in such\r\na lot of people, get at them. But I sat opposite to Aggie all through\r\ndinner, and that puts me in mind. I should like volumes from you about\r\nAggie, please. It\xe2\x80\x99s too revolting of me not to go to see her. But every\r\none knows I\xe2\x80\x99m busy. We\xe2\x80\x99re up to our necks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9chow kind I think it of you to have\r\nfound, with all you have to do, a moment for THIS. But please, without\r\ndelay, let me tell you--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPractically, however, he would let her tell him nothing; his almost\r\naggressive friendly optimism clung so to references of short range.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, please. It\xe2\x80\x99s too charming of you to squeeze me in. To\r\nsee YOU moreover does me good. Quite distinct good. And your writing me\r\ntouched me--oh but really. There were all sorts of old things in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then he broke out once more on her books, one of which for some minutes\r\npast he had held in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you go in for sets--and, my dear\r\nchild, upon my word, I see, BIG sets. What\xe2\x80\x99s this?--\xe2\x80\x98Vol. 23: The\r\nBritish Poets.\xe2\x80\x99 Vol. 23 is delightful--do tell me about Vol. 23. Are\r\nyou doing much in the British Poets? But when the deuce, you wonderful\r\nbeing, do you find time to read? _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t find any--it\xe2\x80\x99s too hideous.\r\nOne relapses in London into such illiteracy and barbarism. I have to\r\nkeep up a false glitter to hide in conversation my rapidly increasing\r\nignorance: I should be so ashamed after all to see other people NOT\r\nshocked by it. But teach me, teach me!\xe2\x80\x9d he gaily went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe British Poets,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda immediately answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwere given me by Mr.\r\nLongdon, who has given me all the good books I have except a few--those\r\nin that top row--that have been given me at different times by Mr.\r\nMitchy. Mr. Mitchy has sent me flowers too, as well as Mr. Longdon.\r\nAnd they\xe2\x80\x99re both--since we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken of my seeing them--coming by\r\nappointment this afternoon; not together, but Mr. Mitchy at 5.30 and Mr.\r\nLongdon at 6.30.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had spoken as with conscious promptitude, making up for what she had\r\nnot yet succeeded in saying by a quick, complete statement of her case.\r\nShe was evidently also going on with more, but her actual visitor had\r\nalready taken her up with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE making a day of it and you\r\nrun us like railway-trains!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cHave _I_ then\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me I should say \xe2\x80\x98Have _I_?\xe2\x80\x99 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not half-past four,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Nanda went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand though I\xe2\x80\x99ve something very particular of course to\r\nsay to you it won\xe2\x80\x99t take long. They don\xe2\x80\x99t bring tea till five, and you\r\nmust surely stay till that. I had already written to you when they\r\neach, for the same reason, proposed this afternoon. They go out of town\r\nto-morrow for Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I see--and they have to see you first. What an influence you exert,\r\nyou know, on people\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued as literal as her friend was facetious. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it just\r\nhappened so, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, since, on my asking you, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow? to choose your time, you had taken, as suiting you best, this\r\ncomparatively early hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d But he again had his watch out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a job,\r\nperversely--that was my reason--on the other side of the world; which,\r\nby the way, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, won\xe2\x80\x99t permit me to wait for tea. My tea doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d The watch went back to his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say I must be\r\noff before five. It has been delightful at all events to see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was on his feet as he spoke, and though he had been half the time on\r\nhis feet his last words gave the effect of his moving almost immediately\r\nto the door. It appeared to come out with them rather clearer than\r\nbefore that he was embarrassed enough really to need help, and it was\r\ndoubtless the measure she after an instant took of this that enabled\r\nNanda, with a quietness all her own, to draw to herself a little more of\r\nthe situation. The quietness was plainly determined for her by a quick\r\nvision of its being the best assistance she could show. Had he an inward\r\nterror that explained his superficial nervousness, the incoherence of\r\na loquacity designed, it would seem, to check in each direction her\r\nadvance? He only fed it in that case by allowing his precautionary\r\nbenevolence to put him in so much deeper. Where indeed could he have\r\nsupposed she wanted to come out, and what that she could ever do for\r\nhim would really be so beautiful as this present chance to smooth his\r\nconfusion and add as much as possible to that refined satisfaction with\r\nhimself which would proceed from his having dealt with a difficult hour\r\nin a gallant and delicate way? To force upon him an awkwardness was\r\nlike forcing a disfigurement or a hurt, so that at the end of a minute,\r\nduring which the expression of her face became a kind of uplifted view\r\nof her opportunity, she arrived at the appearance of having changed\r\nplaces with him and of their being together precisely in order that\r\nhe--not she--should be let down easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you\xe2\x80\x99re not going already?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy in the world then\r\ndo you suppose I appealed to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless me, no; I\xe2\x80\x99ve lots of time.\xe2\x80\x9d He dropped, laughing for very\r\neagerness, straight into another chair. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too awfully interesting.\r\nIs it really an \xe2\x80\x98appeal\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Putting the question indeed he could scarce\r\neven yet allow her a chance to answer it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only that you make me\r\na little nervous with your account of all the people who are going to\r\ntumble in. And there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing more,\xe2\x80\x9d he quickly went on; \xe2\x80\x9cI just want\r\nto make the point in case we should be interrupted. The whole fun is in\r\nseeing you this way alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs THAT the point?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda, as he took breath, gravely asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a part of it--I feel it, I assure you, to be charming. But what\r\nI meant--if you\xe2\x80\x99d only give me time, you know, to put in a word--is what\r\nfor that matter I\xe2\x80\x99ve already told you: that it almost spoils my pleasure\r\nfor you to keep reminding me that a bit of luck like this--luck for ME:\r\nI see you coming!--is after all for you but a question of business. Hang\r\nbusiness! Good--don\xe2\x80\x99t stab me with that paper-knife. I listen. What IS\r\nthe great affair?\xe2\x80\x9d Then as it looked for an instant as if the words she\r\nhad prepared were just, in the supreme pinch of her need, falling apart,\r\nhe once more tried his advantage. \xe2\x80\x9cOh if there\xe2\x80\x99s any difficulty about it\r\nlet it go--we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it for granted. There\xe2\x80\x99s one thing at any rate--do\r\nlet me say this--that I SHOULD like you to keep before me: I want before\r\nI go to make you light up for me the question of little Aggie. Oh there\r\nare other questions too as to which I regard you as a perfect fountain\r\nof curious knowledge! However, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take them one by one--the next some\r\nother time. You always seem to me to hold the strings of such a lot of\r\nqueer little dramas. Have something on the shelf for me when we meet\r\nagain. THE thing just now is the outlook for Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s affair. One cares\r\nenough for old Mitch to fancy one may feel safer for a lead or two. In\r\nfact I want regularly to turn you on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but the thing I happen to have taken it into my head to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Nanda now securely enough replied, \xe2\x80\x9chasn\xe2\x80\x99t the least bit to do, I assure\r\nyou, either with Aggie or with \xe2\x80\x98old Mitch.\xe2\x80\x99 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear\r\nit--want some way of getting off--please believe THEY won\xe2\x80\x99t help you a\r\nbit.\xe2\x80\x9d It was quite in fact that she felt herself at last to have found\r\nthe right tone. Nothing less than a conviction of this could have made\r\nher after an instant add: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world, Mr. Van, are you afraid\r\nof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, that it WAS the right tone a single little minute was sufficient\r\nto prove--a minute, I must yet haste to say, big enough in spite of its\r\nsmallness to contain the longest look on any occasion exchanged between\r\nthese friends. It was one of those looks--not so frequent, it must be\r\nadmitted, as the muse of history, dealing at best in short cuts, is\r\noften by the conditions of her trade reduced to representing them--which\r\nafter they have come and gone are felt not only to have changed\r\nrelations but absolutely to have cleared the air. It certainly helped\r\nVanderbank to find his answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only afraid, I think, of your\r\nconscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been indeed for the space more helped than she. \xe2\x80\x9cMy conscience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink it over--quite at your leisure--and some day you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued--\xe2\x80\x9cno hurry. And when you do understand,\r\nit needn\xe2\x80\x99t make your existence a burden to you to fancy you must tell\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh he was so kind--kinder than ever now. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is, you see,\r\nthat _I_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t a conscience. I only want my fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had on this a second look, also decidedly comfortable, though\r\ndiscounted, as the phrase is, by the other, which had really in its\r\nway exhausted the possibilities of looks. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I want MY fun too,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNanda, \xe2\x80\x9cand little as it may strike you in some ways as looking like it,\r\njust this, I beg you to believe, is the real thing. What\xe2\x80\x99s at the bottom\r\nof it,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis a talk I had not long ago with mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Van returned with brightly blushing interest. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fun,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nlaughed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s to be got out of \xe2\x80\x98mother\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking so much of that. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of any that she\r\nherself may be still in a position to pick up. Mine now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee? is in making out how I can manage for this. Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\ndifficult,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cfor me to tell you exactly what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit difficult for me to understand you!\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank\r\nspoke, in his geniality, as if this were in fact the veriest trifle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got your mother on your mind. That\xe2\x80\x99s very much what I mean by\r\nyour conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda had a fresh hesitation, but evidently unaccompanied at present\r\nby any pain. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you still LIKE mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d she at any rate quite\r\nsuccessfully brought out. \xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she quickly subjoined,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat though I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned my talk with her as having finally led to my\r\nwriting to you, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least that she then suggested my putting\r\nyou the question. I put it,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, \xe2\x80\x9cquite off my own bat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe explanation, as an effect immediately produced, did proportionately\r\nmuch for the visitor, who sat back in his chair with a pleased--a\r\ndistinctly exhilarated--sense both of what he himself and what Nanda had\r\ndone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re an adorable family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then if mother\xe2\x80\x99s adorable why give her up? This I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nadmitting she did, the day I speak of, let me see that she feels you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone; but without suggesting either--not a scrap, please believe--that I\r\nshould make you any sort of scene about it. Of course in the first place\r\nshe knows perfectly that anything like a scene would be no use. You\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out even if you wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat THIS is one.\r\nShe won\xe2\x80\x99t hear us--will she?--smashing the furniture. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think for\r\na while that I could do anything at all, and I worried myself with that\r\nidea half to death. Then suddenly it came to me that I could do just\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m doing now. You said a while ago that we must never be--you\r\nand I--anything but frank and natural. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I said to myself\r\nalso--why not? Here I am for you therefore as natural as a cold in\r\nyour head. I just ask you--I even press you. It\xe2\x80\x99s because, as she said,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve practically ceased coming. Of course I know everything changes.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the law--what is it?--\xe2\x80\x98the great law\xe2\x80\x99 of something or other. All\r\nsorts of things happen--things come to an end. She has more or less--by\r\nhis marriage--lost Mitchy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to lose everything. Do stick\r\nto her. What I really wanted to say to you--to bring it straight out--is\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you thoroughly know how awfully she likes you. I\r\nhope my saying such a thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect you as \xe2\x80\x98immodest.\xe2\x80\x99 One never\r\nknows--but I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care if it does. I suppose it WOULD be immodest\r\nif I were to say that I verily believe she\xe2\x80\x99s in love with you. Not, for\r\nthat matter, that father would mind--he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, as he says, a\r\ntuppenny rap. So\xe2\x80\x9d--she extraordinarily kept it up--\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to\r\nany good the information may have for you: though that, I dare say, does\r\nsound hideous. No matter--if I produce any effect on you. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe only thing I want. When I think of her downstairs there so often\r\nnowadays practically alone I feel as if I could scarcely bear it. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso fearfully young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time at least her speech, while she went from point to point,\r\ncompletely hushed him, though after a full glimpse of the direction it\r\nwas taking he ceased to meet her eyes and only sat staring hard at the\r\npattern of the rug. Even when at last he spoke it was without looking\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re indeed, as she herself used to say, the modern daughter! It\r\ntakes that type to wish to make a career for her parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda very simply, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x98career\xe2\x80\x99 exactly, is\r\nit--keeping hold of an old friend? but it may console a little, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit, for the absence of one? At all events I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want not to have\r\nspoken before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. Of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter\r\nbetween you, or if anything\xe2\x80\x99s really the matter at all. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nat any rate WHAT is--it can\xe2\x80\x99t be anything very bad. Make it up, make it\r\nup--forget it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that\xe2\x80\x99s a career for YOU any more than for\r\nher; but there it is. I know how I sound--most patronising and pushing;\r\nbut nothing venture nothing have. You CAN\xe2\x80\x99T know how much you are to\r\nher. You\xe2\x80\x99re more to her, I verily believe, than any one EVER was. I hate\r\nto have the appearance of plotting anything about her behind her back;\r\nso I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say it once for all. She said once, in speaking of it to\r\na person who repeated it to me, that you had done more for her than any\r\none, because it was you who had really brought her out. It WAS. You\r\ndid. I saw it at the time myself. I was very small, but I COULD see it.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll say I must have been a most uncanny little wretch, and I dare\r\nsay I was and am keeping now the pleasant promise. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s feeling that when a person has brought a person out--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA person should take the consequences,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cand see a\r\nperson through?\xe2\x80\x9d He could meet her now perfectly and proceeded admirably\r\nto do it. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an immense deal in that, I admit--I admit. I\xe2\x80\x99m bound\r\nto say I don\xe2\x80\x99t know quite what I did--one does those things, no doubt,\r\nwith a fine unconsciousness: I should have thought indeed it was the\r\nother way round. But I assure you I accept all consequences and all\r\nresponsibilities. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter between us I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t either. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be much--we\xe2\x80\x99ll look into it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean you and I--YOU mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be any more worried; but she and her\r\nso unwittingly faithless one. I HAVEN\xe2\x80\x99T been as often, I know\xe2\x80\x9d--Van\r\npleasantly kept his course. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a tide in the affairs of\r\nmen--and of women too, and of girls and of every one. You know what I\r\nmean--you know it for yourself. The great thing is that--bless both your\r\nhearts!--one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, one simply CAN\xe2\x80\x99T if one would, give your mother\r\nup. It\xe2\x80\x99s absurd to talk about it. Nobody ever did such a thing in his\r\nlife. There she is, like the moon or the Marble Arch. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say, mind\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he candidly explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat every one LIKES her equally: that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother affair. But no one who ever HAS liked her can afford ever\r\nagain for any long period to do without her. There are too many stupid\r\npeople--there\xe2\x80\x99s too much dull company. That, in London, is to be had by\r\nthe ton; your mother\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence, on the other hand, will always have\r\nits price. One can talk with her for a change. She\xe2\x80\x99s fine, fine, fine.\r\nSo, my dear child, be quiet. She\xe2\x80\x99s a fixed star.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know she is,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s YOU--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho may be only the flashing meteor?\xe2\x80\x9d He sat and smiled at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\npromise you then that your words have stayed me in my course. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmade me stand as still as Joshua made the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d With which he got\r\nstraight up. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Young,\xe2\x80\x99 you say she is?\xe2\x80\x9d--for as if to make up for it\r\nhe all the more sociably continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like anything else. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyouth. She\xe2\x80\x99s MY youth--she WAS mine. And if you ever have a chance,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cdo put in for me that if she wants REALLY to know she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooked for my old age. She\xe2\x80\x99s clever enough, you know\xe2\x80\x9d--and Vanderbank,\r\nlaughing, went over for his hat--\xe2\x80\x9cto understand what you tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda took this in with due attention; she was also now on her feet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then she\xe2\x80\x99s so lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say it, as they say, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl continued, \xe2\x80\x9cBECAUSE\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s mother, but I often think when we\xe2\x80\x99re out that wherever she is--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no one that all round really touches her?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank took it\r\nup with zeal. \xe2\x80\x9cOh so every one thinks, and in fact one\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation\r\nof the charming things in that way so intensely her own can scarcely\r\nbreathe on them all lightly enough. And then, hang it, she has\r\nperceptions--which are not things that run about the streets. She has\r\nsurprises.\xe2\x80\x9d He almost broke down for vividness. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has little ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you do like her,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda gravely replied.\r\n\r\nAt this again he fairly faced her, his momentary silence making it still\r\nmore direct. \xe2\x80\x9cI like, you know, about as well as I ever liked anything,\r\nthis wonderful idea of yours of putting in a plea for her solitude\r\nand her youth. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I do it injustice if I say--which is saying\r\nmuch--that it\xe2\x80\x99s quite as charming as it\xe2\x80\x99s amusing. And now good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had put out his hand, but Nanda hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t wait for tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed to feel, however, that something\r\nmore must be said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall meet again. But it\xe2\x80\x99s getting on, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\ntoward the general scatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I hope that this year,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a good\r\nholiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh we shall meet before that. I shall do what I can, but upon my word\r\nI feel, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat such a tuning-up as YOU\xe2\x80\x99VE given me\r\nwill last me a long time. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the high Alps.\xe2\x80\x9d Then with his hand\r\nout again he added: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any plans yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo many, it might have seemed, that she had no time to take for thinking\r\nof them. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I shall be away a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe candidly wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Mr. Longdon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--with him most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had another pause. \xe2\x80\x9cReally for a long time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA long long one, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother\xe2\x80\x99s willing again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh perfectly. And you see that\xe2\x80\x99s why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d She had said nothing more, and he failed to understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t too much leave her alone. DON\xe2\x80\x99T!\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda brought out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t. But,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently added, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are one or two things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe produced in some seriousness the first. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t she after all see the\r\nMitchys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much either. That of course is now very different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanderbank demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not for YOU, I gather--is it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you expect\r\nto see them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--I hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll come down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved away a little--not straight to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Beccles? Funny\r\nplace for them, a little though, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had put the question as if for amusement, but Nanda took it\r\nliterally. \xe2\x80\x9cAh not when they\xe2\x80\x99re invited so very very charmingly. Not\r\nwhen he wants them so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon? Then that keeps up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d--she was at a loss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean his intimacy--with Mitchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far as it IS an intimacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, by the way\xe2\x80\x9d--and he looked again at his watch--\xe2\x80\x9ctell me\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re just about to turn up together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh not so very particularly together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMitchy first alone?\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderbank asked.\r\n\r\nShe had a smile that was dim, that was slightly strange. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstay for company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks--impossible. And then Mr. Longdon alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless Mitchy stays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had another pause. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t after all told me about the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98evolution\xe2\x80\x99--or the evolutions--of his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I if you don\xe2\x80\x99t give me time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see--of course not.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed to feel for an instant the return of\r\nhis curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cYet it won\xe2\x80\x99t do, will it? to have her out before HIM?\r\nNo, I must go.\xe2\x80\x9d He came back to her and at present she gave him a hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you do see Mr. Longdon alone will you do me a service? I mean\r\nindeed not simply today, but with all other good chances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited. \xe2\x80\x9cAny service whatever. But which first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9clet us call it a bargain. I look after\r\nyour mother--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I--?\xe2\x80\x9d She had had to wait again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook after my good name. I mean for common decency to HIM. He has been\r\nof a kindness to me that, when I think of my failure to return it,\r\nmakes me blush from head to foot. I\xe2\x80\x99ve odiously neglected him--by a\r\ncomplication of accidents. There are things I ought to have done that I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t. There\xe2\x80\x99s one in particular--but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven explained about THAT. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a brute and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it and\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. But there it is. Say a good word for me. Make out\r\nsomehow or other that I\xe2\x80\x99m NOT a beast. In short,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man said,\r\nquite flushed once more with the intensity of his thought, \xe2\x80\x9clet us have\r\nit that you may quite trust ME if you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me a little--just for my\r\ncharacter as a gentleman--trust YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you may trust me,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda replied with her handshake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye then!\xe2\x80\x9d he called from the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d she said after he had closed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was half-past five when Mitchy turned up; and her relapse had in the\r\nmean time known no arrest but the arrival of tea, which, however, she\r\nhad left unnoticed. He expressed on entering the fear that he failed\r\nof exactitude, to which she replied by the assurance that he was on\r\nthe contrary remarkably near it and by the mention of all the aid\r\nto patience she had drawn from the pleasure of half an hour with Mr.\r\nVan--an allusion that of course immediately provoked on Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s part\r\nthe liveliest interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe HAS risked it at last then? How tremendously exciting! And your\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on; after which, as she said nothing: \xe2\x80\x9cDid SHE see him,\r\nI mean, and is he perhaps with her now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she won\xe2\x80\x99t have come in--unless you asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask. I asked only for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda thought an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll still sometimes come to see her,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t you? I mean you won\xe2\x80\x99t ever give her up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy at this laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, you\xe2\x80\x99re an adorable family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it placidly enough. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Mr. Van said. He said I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntrying to make a career for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he?\xe2\x80\x9d Her visitor, though without prejudice to his amusement,\r\nappeared struck. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have got in with him rather deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe again considered. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I did rather. He was awfully\r\nbeautiful and kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy concurred, \xe2\x80\x9ctrust him always for that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wrote me, on my note,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda pursued, \xe2\x80\x9ca tremendously good answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy was struck afresh. \xe2\x80\x9cYour note? What note?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo ask him to come. I wrote at the beginning of the week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--I see\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy observed as if this were rather different. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t then of course have done less than come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet his companion again thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh come--I say: You do know,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see\r\nhim--or you either!\xe2\x80\x9d There would have been for a continuous spectator\r\nof these episodes an odd resemblance between the manner and all the\r\nmovements that had followed his entrance and those that had accompanied\r\nthe installation of his predecessor. He laid his hat, as Vanderbank had\r\ndone, in three places in succession and appeared to question scarcely\r\nless the safety, somewhere, of his umbrella and the grace of retaining\r\nin his hand his gloves. He postponed the final selection of a seat and\r\nhe looked at the objects about him while he spoke of other matters.\r\nQuite in the same fashion indeed at last these objects impressed him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow charming you\xe2\x80\x99ve made your room and what a lot of nice things you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what Mr. Van said too. He seemed immensely struck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mitchy hereupon once more had a drop to extravagance. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I do\r\nnothing then but repeat him? I came, you know, to be original.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be original for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda promptly returned, \xe2\x80\x9cto be at all\r\nlike him. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she went back, \xe2\x80\x9cnot sometimes come for mother\r\nonly? You\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of chances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis he took up with more gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by chances? That\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re going away? That WILL add to the attraction!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed as she\r\nkept silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered at last, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell you definitely\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s all in the air--yet I think I shall know to-day.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m to see Mr. Longdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming at half-past six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you\xe2\x80\x99ll know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--HE will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant Mr. Longdon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said after a moment.\r\n\r\nMitchy had his watch out. \xe2\x80\x9cThen shall I interfere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are quantities of time. You must have your tea. You see at any\r\nrate,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I mean by your chances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had made him his tea, which he had taken. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do squeeze us in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s an accident your coming together--except of course that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re NOT together. I simply took the time that you each independently\r\nproposed. But it would have been all right even if you HAD met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if you and Mr. Longdon do. Mr.\r\nVan, I confess, I did want alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy had been glaring at her over his tea. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re more and more\r\nremarkable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then if I improve so give me your promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy, as he partook of refreshment, kept up his thoughtful gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall presently want some more, please. But do you mind my asking if Van\r\nknew--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s to come? Oh yes, I told him, and he left with me a\r\nmessage for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA message? How awfully interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIt WILL be awfully--to Mr. Longdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome more NOW, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy while she took his cup. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to\r\nMr. Longdon only, eh? Is that a way of saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s none of MY\r\nbusiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact of her attending--and with a happy show of particular care--to\r\nhis immediate material want added somehow, as she replied, to her effect\r\nof sincerity. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mr. Mitchy, the business of mine that has not by this\r\ntime ever so naturally become a business of yours--well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nof any just now, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, you know, if I could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can promise you then that there\xe2\x80\x99s none of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy declared,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made by the same token quite the same shift. Keep it well\r\nbefore you, please, that if ever a young woman had a grave lookout--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cby a grave lookout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the certainty of finding herself saddled for all time to come\r\nwith the affairs of a gentleman whom she can never get rid of on the\r\nspecious plea that he\xe2\x80\x99s only her husband or her lover or her father or\r\nher son or her brother or her uncle or her cousin. There, as none of\r\nthese characters, he just stands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda kindly mused, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s simply her Mitchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. And a Mitchy, you see, is--what do you call it?--simply\r\nindissoluble. He\xe2\x80\x99s moreover inordinately inquisitive. He goes to the\r\nlength of wondering whether Van also learned that you were expecting\r\nME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes--I told him everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him--I told him,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with impatience.\r\n\r\nMitchy hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he then leave me also a message?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing. What I\xe2\x80\x99m to do for him with Mr. Longdon,\xe2\x80\x9d she immediately\r\nexplained, \xe2\x80\x9cis to make practically a kind of apology.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh and for me\xe2\x80\x9d--Mitchy quickly took it up--\xe2\x80\x9cthere can be no question of\r\nanything of that kind. I see. He has done me no wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda, with her eyes now on the window, turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t much\r\nthink he would know even if he had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see. And we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned with some abruptness from the outer view. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nhim. But he was beautiful all round,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one could have\r\nbeen nicer about having for so long, for instance, come so little to the\r\nhouse. As if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t only too many other things to do! He didn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nmake them out nearly the good reasons he might. But fancy, with his\r\nimportant duties--all the great affairs on his hands--our making vulgar\r\nlittle rows about being \xe2\x80\x98neglected\xe2\x80\x99! He actually made so little of what\r\nhe might easily plead--speaking so, I mean, as if he were all in the\r\nwrong--that one had almost positively to SHOW him his excuses. As\r\nif\xe2\x80\x9d--she really kept it up--\xe2\x80\x9che hasn\xe2\x80\x99t plenty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only people like me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy threw out, \xe2\x80\x9cwho have none?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--people like you. People of no use, of no occupation and no\r\nimportance. Like you, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are so many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then it was with no transition of tone that she added: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re bad,\r\nMitchy, I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I\xe2\x80\x99m good what will you tell me? What I want really most to KNOW\r\nis why he should be, as you said just now, \xe2\x80\x98apologetic\xe2\x80\x99 to Mr. Longdon.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong he allows he has done HIM?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he has \xe2\x80\x98neglected\xe2\x80\x99 him--if that\xe2\x80\x99s any comfort to us--quite as much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t looked him up and that sort of thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--and he mentioned some other matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy wondered. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mentioned\xe2\x80\x99 it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn which,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9che hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pleased him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy after an instant risked it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what other matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he says that when I speak to him Mr. Longdon will know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy gravely took this in. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall you speak to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Mr. Van?\xe2\x80\x9d How, she seemed to ask, could he doubt it? \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the very\r\nfirst thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then will Mr. Longdon tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Mr. Van means?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWell--I hope not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy followed it up. \xe2\x80\x9cYou \xe2\x80\x98hope\xe2\x80\x99--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy if it\xe2\x80\x99s anything that could possibly make any one like him any\r\nless. I mean I shan\xe2\x80\x99t in that case in the least want to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy looked as if he could understand that and yet could also imagine\r\nsomething of a conflict. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if Mr. Longdon insists--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn making me know? I shan\xe2\x80\x99t let him insist. Would YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d she put to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m not in question!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she quite rang out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed. After which he added: \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, I might\r\noverbear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she as positively declared again, \xe2\x80\x9cand you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nat any rate desire to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis he finally showed he could take from her--showed it in the silence\r\nin which for a minute their eyes met; then showed it perhaps even more\r\nin his deep exclamation: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re complete!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor such a proposition as well she had the same detached sense. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I am in anything but the wish to keep YOU so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--keep me, keep me! It strikes me that I\xe2\x80\x99m not at all now on a\r\nfooting, you know, of keeping myself. I quite give you notice in\r\nfact,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m going to come to you henceforth for\r\neverything. But you\xe2\x80\x99re too wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up as she at first said\r\nnothing to this. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even frighten you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--fortunately for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but I distinctly warn you that I mean to do my very best for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda viewed it all with as near an approach to gaiety as she often\r\nachieved. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you should ever succeed it would be a dark day for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bristle with your own guns,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the ingenuity of\r\na lifetime shall be devoted to my taking you on some quarter on which\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what quarter, pray, will that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a fool as to begin by giving you a tip!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy on this\r\nturned off with an ambiguous but unmistakeably natural sigh; he looked\r\nat photographs, he took up a book or two as Vanderbank had done, and for\r\na couple of minutes there was silence between them. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does stretch\r\nbefore me,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed after an interval during which clearly, in spite\r\nof his movements, he had looked at nothing--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat does stretch before me\r\nis the happy prospect of my feeling that I\xe2\x80\x99ve found in you a friend\r\nwith whom, so utterly and unreservedly, I can always go to the bottom\r\nof things. This luxury, you see now, of our freedom to look facts in the\r\nface is one of which, I promise you, I mean fully to avail myself.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nstopped before her again, and again she was silent. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so awfully\r\njolly, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? that there\xe2\x80\x99s not at last a single thing that we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t take our ease about. I mean that we can\xe2\x80\x99t intelligibly name and\r\ncomfortably tackle. We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked through the long tunnel of artificial\r\nreserves and superstitious mysteries, and I at least shall have only to\r\nfeel that in showing every confidence and dotting every \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99 I follow the\r\nexample you so admirably set. You go down to the roots? Good. It\xe2\x80\x99s all I\r\nask!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had dropped into a chair as he talked, and so long as she remained\r\nin her own they were confronted; but she presently got up and, the next\r\nmoment, while he kept his place, was busy restoring order to the objects\r\nboth her visitors had disarranged. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you weren\xe2\x80\x99t delightful you\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\ndreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere we are! I could easily, in other words, frighten you if I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took no notice of the remark, only, after a few more scattered\r\ntouches, producing an observation of her own. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s going, all the same,\r\nMr. Van, to be charming to mother. We\xe2\x80\x99ve settled that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then he CAN make time--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe judged it. \xe2\x80\x9cFor as much as THAT, yes. For as much, I mean, as\r\nmay sufficiently show her that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t given her up. So don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nrecognise how much more time YOU can make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--see precisely--there we are again!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy promptly ejaculated.\r\n\r\nYet he had gone, it seemed, further than she followed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, as I say, at the roots and in the depths of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d She dropped to an indifference that was but part of her general\r\npatience for all his irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s needless to go into the question of not giving your mother up. One\r\nsimply DOESN\xe2\x80\x99T give her up. One can\xe2\x80\x99t. There she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what HE says. There she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say nothing but what \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99 says!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy laughed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t at all events have mentioned to you any such link as the one\r\nthat in my case is now almost the most palpable. I\xe2\x80\x99VE got a wife, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Mitchy!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl protestingly though vaguely murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my wife--did you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis positively getting\r\nthick with your mother. Of course it isn\xe2\x80\x99t new to you that she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwonderful for wives. Now that our marriage is an accomplished fact she\r\ntakes the greatest interest in it--or bids fair to if her attention can\r\nonly be thoroughly secured--and more particularly in what I believe is\r\ngenerally called our peculiar situation: for it appears, you know, that\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re to the most conspicuous degree possible IN a peculiar situation.\r\nAggie\xe2\x80\x99s therefore already, and is likely to be still more, in what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuniversally recognised as your mother\xe2\x80\x99s regular line. Your mother will\r\nattract her, study her, finally \xe2\x80\x98understand\xe2\x80\x99 her. In fact she\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x98help\xe2\x80\x99\r\nher as she has \xe2\x80\x98helped\xe2\x80\x99 so many before and will \xe2\x80\x98help\xe2\x80\x99 so many still to\r\ncome. With Aggie thus as a satellite and a frequenter--in a degree in\r\nwhich she never yet HAS been,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will the whole thing\r\nbe but a practical multiplication of our points of contact? You may\r\nremind me of Mrs. Brook\xe2\x80\x99s contention that if she did in her time keep\r\nsomething of a saloon the saloon is now, in consequence of events, but\r\na collection of fortuitous atoms; but that, my dear Nanda, will become\r\nnone the less, to your clearer sense, but a pious echo of her momentary\r\nmodesty or--call it at the worst--her momentary despair. The generations\r\nwill come and go, and the PERSONNEL, as the newspapers say, of the\r\nsaloon will shift and change, but the institution itself, as resting on\r\na deep human need, has a long course yet to run and a good work yet to\r\ndo. WE shan\xe2\x80\x99t last, but your mother will, and as Aggie is happily very\r\nyoung she\xe2\x80\x99s therefore provided for, in the time to come, on a scale\r\nsufficiently considerable to leave us just now at peace. Meanwhile,\r\nas you\xe2\x80\x99re almost as good for husbands as Mrs. Brook is for wives, why\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t we, as a couple, we Mitchys, quite ideally arranged for, and why\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t I speak to you of my future as sufficiently guaranteed? The only\r\nappreciable shadow I make out comes, for me, from the question of what\r\nmay to-day be between you and Mr. Longdon. Do I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\xe2\x80\x99s presently to arrive for an answer to something he has\r\nput to you?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda looked at him a while with a sort of solemnity of\r\ntenderness, and her voice, when she at last spoke, trembled with a\r\nfeeling that clearly had grown in her as she listened to the string of\r\nwhimsicalities, bitter and sweet, that he had just unrolled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwild,\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply--\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re wild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wonderfully glared. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I then already frightening you?\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his\r\nhead rather sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not in the least trying yet. There\xe2\x80\x99s something,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he added after an instant, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I do want too awfully to ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then--!\xe2\x80\x9d If she had not eagerness she had at least charity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but you see I reflect that though you show all the courage to go\r\nto the roots and depths with ME, I\xe2\x80\x99m not--I never have been--fully\r\nconscious of the nerve for doing as much with you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mitchy explained, \xe2\x80\x9cof how much--of a particular matter--you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued ever so kindly to face him. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t it come out all round\r\nnow that I know everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer reply, in this form, took a minute or two to operate, but when it\r\nbegan to do so it fairly diffused a light. Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s face turned of a\r\ncolour that might have been produced by her holding close to it some\r\nlantern wonderfully glazed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d he then rang out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything,\xe2\x80\x9d she imperturbably went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent a little, his eyes on her. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I kiss your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered: \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I call wild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had risen with his question and after her reply he remained a moment\r\non the spot. \xe2\x80\x9cSee--I\xe2\x80\x99ve frightened you. It proves as easy as that. But\r\nI only wanted to show you and to be sure for myself. Now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve the\r\nmental certitude I shall never wish otherwise to use it.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned away\r\nto begin again one of his absorbed revolutions. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon has asked\r\nyou this time for a grand public adhesion, and what he turns up for now\r\nis to receive your ultimatum? A final irrevocable flight with him is\r\nthe line he advises, so that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready for it on the spot with the\r\npost-chaise and the pistols?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe image appeared really to have for Nanda a certain vividness, and\r\nshe looked at it a space without a hint of a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shan\xe2\x80\x99t need any\r\npistols, whatever may be decided about the post-chaise; and any flight\r\nwe may undertake together will need no cover of secrecy or night.\r\nMother, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t fling herself across your reckless path? I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMitchy--\xe2\x80\x9cyou alluded to her magnificent resignation. But father?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\noddly demanded.\r\n\r\nNanda thought for this a moment longer. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Longdon has--off in\r\nthe country--a good deal of shooting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that Edward can sometimes come down with his old gun? Good then\r\ntoo--if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, as he takes you by the way, to shoot YOU. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nit all shipshape and arranged, in other words, and have only, if the\r\nfancy does move you, to clear out. You clear out--you make all sorts of\r\nroom. It IS interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9carriving thus with you at\r\nthe depths! I look all round and see every one squared and every one but\r\none or two suited. Why then reflexion and delay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t, dear Mr. Mitchy,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda took her time to return, \xe2\x80\x9cknow\r\nnearly as much as you think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t my question absolutely a confession of ignorance and a\r\nrenunciation of thought? I put myself from this moment forth with you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mitchy declared, \xe2\x80\x9con the footing of knowing nothing whatever and of\r\nreceiving literally from your hands all information and all life. Let my\r\ncontinued attitude of dependence, my dear Nanda, show it. Any hesitation\r\nyou may yet feel, you imply, proceeds from a sense of duties in London\r\nnot to be lightly renounced? Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d he thoughtfully said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do at least\r\nknow you HAVE them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe watched him with the same mildness while he vaguely circled about.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wild, you\xe2\x80\x99re wild,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least\r\nmatter. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t abandon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped short. \xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s what I wanted from you in so many clear-cut\r\ngolden words--though I won\xe2\x80\x99t in the least of course pretend that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nfelt I literally need it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t literally need the big turquoise in\r\nmy neck-tie; which incidentally means, by the way, that if you should\r\nadmire it you\xe2\x80\x99re quite welcome to it. Such words--that\xe2\x80\x99s my point--are\r\nlike such jewels: the pride, you see, of one\xe2\x80\x99s heart. They\xe2\x80\x99re mere\r\nvanity, but they help along. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got of course always poor Tishy,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you leave it all to ME?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda said as if she had not heard him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got poor Carrie,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthough HER of course you\r\nrather divide with your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you leave it all to ME?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo say nothing of poor Cashmore,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhom you take ALL, I\r\nbelieve, yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you leave it all to ME?\xe2\x80\x9d she once more repeated.\r\n\r\nThis time he pulled up, suddenly and expressively wondering. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\ngoing to do anything about it at present?--I mean with our friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe appeared to have a scruple of saying, but at last she produced it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy again laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE, as a family--!\xe2\x80\x9d But he had already\r\nchecked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Longdon will at any rate, you imply, be somehow\r\ninterested--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn MY interests? Of course--since he has gone so far. You expressed\r\nsurprise at my wanting to wait and think; but how can I not wait and not\r\nthink when so much depends on the question--now so definite--of how much\r\nfurther he WILL go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchy, profoundly impressed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much does that\r\ndepend on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had to reflect. \xe2\x80\x9cOn how much further I, for my part, MUST!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy\xe2\x80\x99s grasp was already complete. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s coming then to learn from\r\nyou how far this is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy looked about for his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that of course I see my time\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabout up, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to be quite alone together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda glanced at the clock. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99ve a margin yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t want an interval for your thinking--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda was already very obviously thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean if you\xe2\x80\x99ve an important decision to take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cseeing you HAS helped me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but at the same time worried you. Therefore--\xe2\x80\x9d And he picked up his\r\numbrella.\r\n\r\nHer eyes rested on its curious handle. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you cling to your idea that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m frightened you\xe2\x80\x99ll be disappointed. It will never be given you to\r\nreassure me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean by that that I\xe2\x80\x99m primarily so solid--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that till I see you yourself afraid--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t admit that anything isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly what I was prepared\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy looked with interest into his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cThen what is it I\xe2\x80\x99m to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98leave\xe2\x80\x99 to you?\xe2\x80\x9d After which, as she turned away from him with a\r\nsuppressed sound and said, while he watched her, nothing else, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndoubt natural for you to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do make you nervous.\r\nGood-bye--good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had stayed him, by a fresh movement, however, as he reached the\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cAggie\xe2\x80\x99s only trying to find out--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--what?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy what sort of a person she is. How can she ever have known? It was\r\ncarefully, elaborately hidden from her--kept so obscure that she could\r\nmake out nothing. She isn\xe2\x80\x99t now like ME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wonderingly attended. \xe2\x80\x9cLike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I get the benefit of the fact that there was never a time when I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know SOMETHING or other, and that I became more and more aware,\r\nas I grew older, of a hundred little chinks of daylight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy stared. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re stupendous, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nAh but she kept it up. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ had my idea about Aggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t I know you had? And how you were positive about the sort of\r\nperson--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even suspect herself,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cto be? I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nequally positive now. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite what I believed, only there\xe2\x80\x99s ever so\r\nmuch more of it. More HAS come--and more will yet. You see, when there\r\nhas been nothing before, it all has to come with a rush. So that if even\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised of course she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course _I_ am!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy\xe2\x80\x99s interest, though even now not wholly\r\nunqualified with amusement, had visibly deepened. \xe2\x80\x9cYou admit then,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99re surprised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the mere scale of it. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s splendid.\r\nThe only person whose astonishment I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis Cousin Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Cousin Jane\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment serves her right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she held so,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat marriage should do everything--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a funk at finding what it IS doing? Oh no,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s the last one!\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI vow I enjoy her scare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s very bad, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh too awful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl appeared assentingly to muse, \xe2\x80\x9cshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nafter all have dreamed--!\xe2\x80\x9d But she took herself up. \xe2\x80\x9cThe great thing is\r\nto be helpful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in what way--?\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchy asked with his wonderful air of inviting\r\ncompetitive suggestions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s finding herself. Do you think,\xe2\x80\x9d she immediately\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Lord Petherton really is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMitchy frankly considered. \xe2\x80\x9cHelpful? Oh he does his best, I gather.\r\nYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently added--\xe2\x80\x9cPetherton\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you yourself, naturally,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion threw off, \xe2\x80\x9cwho can help\r\nmost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, and I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my best too. So that with such good\r\nassistance\xe2\x80\x9d--he seemed at last to have taken it all from her--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat is\r\nit, I again ask, that, as you request, I\xe2\x80\x99m to \xe2\x80\x98leave\xe2\x80\x99 to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda required, while he still waited, some time to reply. \xe2\x80\x9cTo keep my\r\npromise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to abandon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mitchy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d But he came a few steps forward. \xe2\x80\x9cI MAYN\xe2\x80\x99T kiss your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he oddly sounded as he quickly went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe interval he had represented as likely to be useful to her was in\r\nfact, however, not a little abbreviated by a punctuality of arrival\r\non Mr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s part so extreme as to lead the first thing to a word\r\nalmost of apology. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d her new visitor immediately began,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I haven\xe2\x80\x99t left you alone, these many days, as much as I promised\r\non coming up to you that afternoon when after my return to town I found\r\nMr. Mitchett instead of your mother awaiting me in the drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve really done quite as I asked you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI felt half an hour ago that, near as I was to\r\nrelief, I could keep it up no longer; so that though I knew it would\r\nbring me much too soon I started at six sharp for our trysting-place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve no tea, after all, to reward you!\xe2\x80\x9d It was but now clearly that\r\nshe noticed it. \xe2\x80\x9cThey must have removed the things without my heeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer old friend looked at her with some intensity. \xe2\x80\x9cWere you in the\r\nroom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the man come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then were you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda thought; her smile was as usual the faintest discernible outward\r\nsign. \xe2\x80\x9cThinking of YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo tremendously hard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of other things too and of other persons. Of everything really\r\nthat in our last talk I told you I felt I must have out with myself\r\nbefore meeting you for what I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve now in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had kept his eyes on her, but at this he turned away; not,\r\nhowever, for an alternative, embracing her material situation with the\r\nembarrassed optimism of Vanderbank or the mitigated gloom of Mitchy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x9d--he took her up with some dryness--\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been having things out\r\nwith yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d But he went on before she answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any\r\ntea, thank you. I found myself, after five, in such a fidget that I\r\nwent three times in the course of the hour to my club, where I\xe2\x80\x99ve the\r\nimpression I each time had it. I dare say it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, though, I\r\ndid have it,\xe2\x80\x9d he after an instant pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99ve somehow a confused\r\nimage of a shop in Oxford Street--or was it rather in Regent?--into\r\nwhich I gloomily wandered to beguile the moments with a mixture that if\r\nI strike you as upset I beg you to set it all down to. Do you know in\r\nfact what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing for the last ten minutes? Roaming hither and\r\nthither in your beautiful Crescent till I could venture to come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen did you see Mitchy go out? But no, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d--Nanda corrected\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been gone longer than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer visitor had dropped on a sofa where, propped by the back, he sat\r\nrather upright, his glasses on his nose, his hands in his pockets and\r\nhis elbows much turned out. \xe2\x80\x9cMitchy left you more than ten minutes ago,\r\nand yet your state on his departure remains such that there could be a\r\nbustle of servants in the room without your being aware? Kindly give me\r\na lead then as to what it is he has done to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hovered before him with her obscure smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see it for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with decision. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything for myself, and\r\nI beg you to understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s not what I\xe2\x80\x99ve come here to-day to do.\r\nAnything I may yet see which I don\xe2\x80\x99t already see will be only, I warn\r\nyou, so far as you shall make it very clear. There--you\xe2\x80\x99ve work cut\r\nout. And is it with Mr. Mitchett, may I ask, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been, as you\r\nmention, cutting it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda looked about her as if weighing many things; after which her eyes\r\ncame back to him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind if I don\xe2\x80\x99t sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if you stand on your head--at the pass we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not try your patience,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl good-humouredly replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cso far as that. I only want you not to be worried if I walk about a\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, without a movement, kept his posture. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I can\xe2\x80\x99t oblige\r\nyou there. I SHALL be worried. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come on purpose to be worried, and\r\nthe more I surrender myself to the rack the more, I seem to feel, we\r\nshall have threshed our business out. So you may dance, you may stamp,\r\nif you like, on the absolutely passive thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve made of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what I HAVE had from Mitchy,\xe2\x80\x9d she cheerfully responded, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\npractically a lesson in dancing: by which I perhaps mean rather a lesson\r\nin sitting, myself, as I want you to do while _I_ talk, as still as\r\na mouse. They take,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile THEY talk, an amount of\r\nexercise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cWas his wife with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear no--he and Mr. Van.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Mr. Van with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no--before, alone. All over the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon had a pause so rich in appeal that when he at last spoke his\r\nquestion was itself like an answer. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Van has been to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I wrote and asked him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t get up.\xe2\x80\x9d She raised her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I?\xe2\x80\x9d He had never budged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was most kind; stayed half an hour and, when I told him you were\r\ncoming, left a good message for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon appeared to wait for this tribute, which was not immediately\r\nproduced. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call a \xe2\x80\x98good\xe2\x80\x99 message?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m to make it all right with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that he has not, for so long, been to see you or written to you.\r\nThat he has seemed to neglect you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda\xe2\x80\x99s visitor looked so far about as to take the neighbourhood in\r\ngeneral into the confidence of his surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cTo neglect ME?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, others too, I believe--with whom we\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned. He has been\r\nso taken up. But you above all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon showed on this a coldness that somehow spoke for itself as\r\nthe greatest with which he had ever in his life met an act of reparation\r\nand that was infinitely confirmed by his sustained immobility. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of\r\nwhat have I complained?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he fancies you\xe2\x80\x99ve complained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how could he have come to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen for so many\r\nmonths past I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so little in town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not more ready with objections, however, than his companion had\r\nby this time become with answers. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been thinking of the\r\ntime of your present stay. He evidently has you much on his mind--he\r\nspoke of not having seen you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has quite sufficiently tried--he has left cards,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon\r\nreturned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat more does he want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda looked at him with her long grave straight-ness, which had often a\r\nplay of light beyond any smile. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know, he does want more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it was open to him--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he so strongly feels\xe2\x80\x9d--she quickly took him up--\xe2\x80\x9cthat you must have\r\nfelt. And therefore it is I speak for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I promised him I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d her friend repeated as in stifled pain.\r\n\r\nShe had kept for the time all her fine clearness turned to him; but\r\nshe might on this have been taken as giving him up with a movement of\r\nobedience and a strange soft sigh. The smothered sound might even have\r\nrepresented to a listener at all initiated a consenting retreat before\r\nan effort greater than her reckoning--a retreat that was in so far the\r\nsnap of a sharp tension. The next minute, none the less, she evidently\r\nfound a fresh provocation in the sight of the pale and positively\r\nexcessive rigour she had imposed, so that, though her friend was only\r\naccommodating himself to her wish she had a sudden impulse of criticism.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re proud about it--too proud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what if I am?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her with a complexity of\r\ncommunication that no words could have meddled with. \xe2\x80\x9cPride\xe2\x80\x99s all right\r\nwhen it helps one to bear things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s only when one wants to take the least from\r\nthem. When one wants to take the most--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d--he spoke, as she faltered, with a certain small hardness of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nShe faltered, however, indeed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to say it.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nfairly coloured with the attempt. \xe2\x80\x9cOne must let the sense of all that I\r\nspeak of--well, all come. One must rather like it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--but I\r\nsuppose one must rather grovel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon, though with visible reluctance, turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery fine--but you\xe2\x80\x99re a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--that must make a difference. But being a woman, in such a case,\r\nhas then,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda went on, \xe2\x80\x9cits advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this point perhaps her friend might presently have been taken as\r\nrelaxing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes me that even at that the advantages are mainly for\r\nothers. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad, God knows, that you\xe2\x80\x99re not also a young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99re suited all round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had spoken with a promptitude that appeared again to act on him\r\nslightly as an irritant, for he met it--with more delay--by a long and\r\nderisive murmur. \xe2\x80\x9cOh MY pride--!\xe2\x80\x9d But this she in no manner took up;\r\nso that he was left for a little to his thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you were\r\nplotting when you told me the other day that you wanted time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t plotting--though I was, I confess, trying to work things\r\nout. That particular idea of simply asking Mr. Van by letter to present\r\nhimself--that particular flight of fancy hadn\xe2\x80\x99t in fact then at all\r\noccurred to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt never occurred, I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say, to ME,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever thought of writing to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. But you haven\xe2\x80\x99t the reasons. I wanted to attack him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot about me, I hope to God!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longdon, distinctly a little paler,\r\nrejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. I think I had an instinct of how you would have taken\r\nTHAT. It was about mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said her visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been worse to her than to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nit all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon\xe2\x80\x99s attention retained its grimness. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he has such a remedy\r\nfor the more then, what has he for the less?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNanda, however, was but for an instant checked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s I who make it up to YOU. To mother, you see, there\xe2\x80\x99s no one\r\notherwise to make it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis at first unmistakeably sounded to him too complicated for\r\nacceptance. But his face changed as light dawned. \xe2\x80\x9cThat puts it then\r\nthat you WILL come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come if you\xe2\x80\x99ll take me as I am--which is what I must previously\r\nexplain to you: I mean more than I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done before. But what HE\r\nmeans by what you call his remedy is my making you feel better about\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man gazed at her. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Your\xe2\x80\x99 doing it is too beautiful! And he\r\ncould really come to you for the purpose of asking you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl briskly, \xe2\x80\x9che came simply for the purpose of doing\r\nwhat he HAD to do. After my letter how could he not come? Then he met\r\nmost kindly what I said to him for mother and what he quite understood\r\nto be all my business with him; so that his appeal to me to plead with\r\nyou for--well, for his credit--was only thrown in because he had so good\r\na chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech brought Mr. Longdon abruptly to his feet, but before she\r\ncould warn him again of the patience she continued to need he had\r\nalready, as if what she evoked for him left him too stupefied, dropped\r\nback into submission. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man stood there for you to render him a\r\nservice?--for you to help him and praise him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to go out of my way, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? He knew you were\r\npresently to be here.\xe2\x80\x9d Her anxiety that he should understand gave her a\r\nrare strained smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t make--as a request from him--too much of\r\nit, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve not a doubt that, rather than that you should think any\r\nill of him for wishing me to say a word, he would gladly be left with\r\nwhatever bad appearance he may actually happen to have.\xe2\x80\x9d She pulled\r\nup on these words as with a quick sense of their really, by their mere\r\nsound, putting her in deeper; and could only give her friend one of the\r\nlooks that expressed: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could trust you not to assent even more than\r\nI want, I should say \xe2\x80\x98You know what I mean!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d She allowed him at all\r\nevents--or tried to allow him--no time for uttered irony before going\r\non: \xe2\x80\x9cHe was everything you could have wished; quite as beautiful about\r\nYOU--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs about you?\xe2\x80\x9d--Mr. Longdon took her up.\r\n\r\nShe demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cAs about mother.\xe2\x80\x9d With which she turned away as if it\r\nhandsomely settled the question.\r\n\r\nBut it only left him, as she went to the window, sitting there sombre.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he brought out as his eyes followed her, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nsaying you\xe2\x80\x99re not proud! Thank God you ARE, my dear. Yes--it\xe2\x80\x99s better\r\nfor us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, after a moment, in her place, she turned round to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nglad I\xe2\x80\x99m anything--whatever you may call it and though I can\xe2\x80\x99t call it\r\nthe same--that\xe2\x80\x99s good for YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said nothing more for a little, as if by such a speech something in\r\nhim were simplified and softened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be good for me--by which I\r\nmean it would be easier for me--if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so immensely care\r\nfor him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d came from Nanda with an accent of attenuation at once so\r\nprecipitate and so vague that it only made her attitude at first rather\r\nawkward. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she immediately repeated, but with an increase of the\r\nsame effect. After which, conscious, she made, as if to save herself, a\r\nquick addition. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Longdon, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it rather yourself most--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be easier for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, heedless, \xe2\x80\x9cif you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, my\r\npoor child, so wonderfully love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but I don\xe2\x80\x99t--please believe me when I assure you I DON\xe2\x80\x99T!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke\r\nout. It burst from her, flaring up, in a queer quaver that ended in\r\nsomething queerer still--in her abrupt collapse, on the spot, into the\r\nnearest chair, where she choked with a torrent of tears. Her buried face\r\ncould only after a moment give way to the flood, and she sobbed in a\r\npassion as sharp and brief as the flurry of a wild thing for an instant\r\nuncaged; her old friend meantime keeping his place in the silence broken\r\nby her sound and distantly--across the room--closing his eyes to his\r\nhelplessness and her shame. Thus they sat together while their trouble\r\nboth conjoined and divided them. She recovered herself, however, with an\r\neffort worthy of her fall and was on her feet again as she stammeringly\r\nspoke and angrily brushed at her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat difference in the world\r\ndoes it make--what difference ever?\xe2\x80\x9d Then clearly, even with the words,\r\nher checked tears suffered her to see how it made the difference that he\r\ntoo had been crying; so that \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you mind!\xe2\x80\x9d she thereupon\r\nwailed with extravagance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I would have done for him. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated--while she looked as if she naturally\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t--as with a renewal of his dream of beneficence and of the\r\nsoreness of his personal wound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but HE does you justice--he knows. So it shows, so it shows--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut in this direction too, unable to say what it showed, she had again\r\nbroken down and again could only hold herself and let her companion sit\r\nthere. \xe2\x80\x9cAh Nanda, Nanda!\xe2\x80\x9d he deeply murmured; and the depth of the pity\r\nwas, vainly and blindly, as the depth of a reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s I--it\xe2\x80\x99s I, therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as if she must then so look at it\r\nwith him; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s I who am the horrible impossible and who have covered\r\neverything else with my own impossibility. For some different person you\r\nCOULD have done what you speak of, and for some different person you can\r\ndo it still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared at her with his barren sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cA person different from him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA person different from ME!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what interest have I in any such person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your interest in me--you see well enough where THAT lands us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Longdon now got to his feet and somewhat stiffly remained; after\r\nwhich, for all answer, \xe2\x80\x9cYou say you WILL come then?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. Then\r\nas--seemingly with her last thought--she kept silent: \xe2\x80\x9cYou understand\r\nclearly, I take it, that this time it\xe2\x80\x99s never again to leave me--or to\r\nBE left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently replied. \xe2\x80\x9cNever again. That,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cis why I asked you for these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken them--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but have YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda. They were close to each other now, and\r\nwith a tenderness of warning that was helped by their almost equal\r\nstature she laid her hand on his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I did more than\r\nanything else write to him for,\xe2\x80\x9d she had now regained her clearness\r\nenough to explain, \xe2\x80\x9cwas that--with whatever idea you had--you should see\r\nfor yourself how he could come and go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what good was that to do me? HADN\xe2\x80\x99T I seen for myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen once more. Here he was. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care what he\r\nthought. Here I brought him. And his reasons remain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept her eyes on her companion\xe2\x80\x99s face, but his own now and\r\nafterwards seemed to wander far. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care for his reasons so long\r\nas they\xe2\x80\x99re not mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought an instant, still holding him gently and as if for\r\nsuccessful argument. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t altogether understand them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why the devil, altogether, SHOULD I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh because you distinctly want to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda ever so kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nadmitted as much when we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but when HAVE we talked?\xe2\x80\x9d he sharply interrupted.\r\n\r\nThis time he had challenged her so straight that it was her own look\r\nthat strayed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen HAVEN\xe2\x80\x99T we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, YOU may have: if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you call talking--never saying a\r\nword. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only to do at any rate, in the way of reasons,\r\nwith my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yours too then remain? Because, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI AM\r\nlike that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike what he thinks.\xe2\x80\x9d Then so gravely that it was almost a\r\nsupplication, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t KNOW what he\r\nthinks. You do know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes, on that strange ground, could meet at last, and the effect\r\nof it was presently for Mr. Longdon. \xe2\x80\x9cI do know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d He raised his hands and took her face, which he drew so close to\r\nhis own that, as she gently let him, he could kiss her with solemnity\r\non the forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d he then very firmly said--quite indeed as if it\r\nwere a question of their moving on the spot.\r\n\r\nIt literally made her smile, which, with a certain compunction, she\r\nimmediately corrected by doing for him in the pressure of her lips\r\nto his cheek what he had just done for herself. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day?\xe2\x80\x9d she more\r\nseriously asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, but clearly for assent. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean by your taking\r\nme as I am. It IS, you know, for a girl--extraordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know what it is!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed with an odd fatigue in his\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\nBut she continued, with the shadow of her scruple, to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmany of us, we\xe2\x80\x99re most of us--as you long ago saw and showed you\r\nfelt--extraordinary now. We can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t really our fault.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s so much else that\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary that if we\xe2\x80\x99re in it all so\r\nmuch we must naturally be.\xe2\x80\x9d It was all obviously clearer to her than\r\never yet, and her sense of it found renewed expression; so that she\r\nmight have been, as she wound up, a very much older person than her\r\nfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s different from what it used to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned with an air of final indoctrination.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what he ought to have recognised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs YOU have?\xe2\x80\x9d Nanda was once more--and completely now--enthroned in\r\nhigh justice. \xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99s more old-fashioned than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon with a queer face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe tried,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl went on--\xe2\x80\x9che did his best. But he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s so right--for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer visitor, before meeting this, gathered in his hat and stick, which\r\nfor a minute occupied his attention. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to have married--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Aggie? Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nanda.\r\n\r\nThey had gained the door, where Mr. Longdon again met her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthen Mitchy--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she checked him with a quick gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--not even then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo again before he went they were for a minute confronted. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\nanxious about Mitchy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe faltered, but at last brought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Do you see? There I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. There we are. Well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Longdon--\xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Awkward Age, by Henry James\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AWKWARD AGE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 7433-0.txt or 7433-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/7/4/3/7433/\r\n\r\nProduced by Eve Sobol\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
